New Best Friend evolves around the college life of Alicia Campbell, a student whose murder attempt baffles a private investigator, played by Taye Diggs. As shots of Alicia are shown while she lies in a hospital bed, watchers also get to see how Alicia's college life went from being an obscure, financial aid supported girl in a rich people's law college to a hospital patient in a comatose state.

Alicia meets Hadley when they are paired for a project. Hadley introduces Alicia into a world of drugs, partying, sex and alcohol. Then Alicia meets Hadley's friends, Sidney and Julianne, and Alicia becomes a member of their girl's club. Alicia seduces Sidney into a lesbian relationship but soon dumps her. It was suggested, in an interview between Sidney and the detective, that Sidney and Julianne are also involved in a lesbian relationship.

Alicia had also begun to flirt with Hadley's boyfriend, and they ended up having sex. This infuriated Hadley, who starts to resent Alicia. When Alicia got a job from Hadley's father, Hadley, who was supposed to get the job before Alicia did, raises her hatred of Alicia.

The private investigator's findings lead him to much confusion and different theories, until near the end he learns it was Hadley who tried to kill Alicia. Hadley gets arrested after her class' graduation.
