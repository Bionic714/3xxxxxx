Jethro Tull: Beasties 1982


Source: NTSC VHS (Unknown Gen) > DVD-R (2nd Gen)


An attempt has been made to create a representative Broadsword And The Beast Tour concert from 1982.

Tracks were compiled from free-to-air German and Italian TV broadcasts and edited into the correct sequential order.
 
For fans of the classic album this will be a rare chance to see the band perform many songs from it live on stage.  Much maligned on initial release Ian Anderson now considers this album to contain some of Tulls finest music.  (see the liner notes on the remaster CD).

The first track is the worst quality, it only gets better from there and personally I just wish Flying Colours and Slow Marching Band could have been included and weaker songs like Sweet Dream and Pibroch dropped.
