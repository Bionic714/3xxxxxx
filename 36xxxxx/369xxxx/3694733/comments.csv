""The communist was high on High End"" - couldnt get it..are you referring to any of the songs?

any other things from that bygone era of Romania..movies,songs -- would be highly delighted if you could point me to any link."

And don't forget communism was imposed on Romania by the Russians/Soviets after WWII - nobody actually wanted it. Gypsy and traditional folk music (muzica lautareasca si populara) have existed long before and flow naturally from Romanian history."
