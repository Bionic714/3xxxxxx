about latest Patch V1.2  (download here) 
http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/legostarwarstheoriginaltrilogy/downloads.html

(the game works great on several systems, without patch!, use it only if game doesnt work or something similar!, i never used or either needed a patch!, 
probably no one needs!, but we never know!, right?).

any questions concerning the game wont start or work, will be totally ignored this time.
