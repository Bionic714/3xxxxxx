,shoggoth,2007-05-22T10:14Z,Nice one!! Like the cars honkin horn when it's angry :P
,Pbay4ever,2007-05-22T18:34Z,"What u use to burn to DVD 
nero 6 doesnt recognize .mkv"
,piratepete14,2007-05-23T03:12Z,"Be careful about downloading this file as it is .MKV which is difficult enough to find a decent media player but it is encoded as a H.264 codec which will need a modern processor.

I dont understand why you simply couldnt use dvix or xvid like everybody else. I spent hours downloading and I will simply delete this stupid file."
,mtamimi,2007-05-23T03:57Z,"piratepete14: you are so damn stupid.

If you read my comments clearly, you will see that I tested this file on my xbox...and FYI the processor in the old xbox is celeron 700MHZ and the RAM is only 64 MB only, yet it was able to run the file smoothly...so if your PC specs are lower than that, then you should not download anything from the web.

Now you are asking why I used X264?Clearly you are thick and you will not understand a word but I will explain for the others?This movie ~1:40 mins long?and I wanted a good quality picture and small file so everyone can download enjoy it?If I wanted to get the same quality from xvid/divx, then the file will be at least 1GB instead of 700M.

Again, if anyone is expecting to run this file on a P2?then forget it :)"
,mtamimi,2007-05-23T04:03Z,"And before downloading a file next time, read its name...I said .X264. And I said that again in the description, so you should not download it if your 15 years old PC can not handle it!!!"
,mtamimi,2007-05-23T04:07Z,If you want to watch MKV w/o installing codecs and splitters then use VLC http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
,dvlchlddlx,2007-05-27T16:29Z,KICK ASS MOVIE!! HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SINCE EARLY 80'S! to those bitching about not being able to see the movie. use ConvertX to DVD. works great on my puter and my home theater. use Nero7Ultra to watch.
,NeedMachine,2007-06-19T20:07Z,Cool movie! Thx
,sergios_santos,2007-06-20T21:06Z,"I saw this movie in 1978 when it was released here in Brazil and later on TV. But it was never released in VHS or DVD around here. I simply loved it and always wished to see it again. Now I was luck to got it from Torrent. The problem is: I could not find any brazilian-portuguese subtitle, so if anybody has the portuguese or english (so that I can translate it into portuguese) or even the movie script, please let me know. I will be very thankful."
