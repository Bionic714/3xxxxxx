Get ALL the updates for XP that you want.
There is an ebook on it that you can manually remove, I did. Im not a Moslem so I dont need it or want it.

Anyways, I had to reseed this cus ""someone"" reported my torrent as a dupe and it was deleted.
If it gets deleted again just do a search for it and you will find it. Cus Im tracking this externally.

You guys know the drill. After your dl finishes, keep it seeded!

Thanx
