,b&gii,2008-05-18T19:45Z,"In VLC, the audio goes dead about (I think) 12 mins. into the film, and doesn't recover for a while.  If I fool with the output jack plug (which is going to the stereo) then it seems like bits of audio are still playing... somewhere.  Almost like the audio goes way out of phase?  Anyone else have this problem?  Thanks~"
