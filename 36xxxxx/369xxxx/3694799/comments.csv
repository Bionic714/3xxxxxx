First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

I've viewed HDTV China's releases before so I don't think they are MPAA fakes, but every tool I've used says there is no MPEG2 Stream like an MPAA fake.  I've tried 2k, XP, OSX, media player classic, vlc, wmp11+sdk, video Redo, NOTHING plays any video.  The link for codec downloads fails to complete.  
IF the codec works, please include it in the torrent.  Thanks."
