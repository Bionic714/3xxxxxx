,Ghengis-Khan,2007-09-25T19:10Z,"This is just the studio albums... what about they're 6 live albums and 7 compilations, or even the solo albums of Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee?  I would have included those in something I was going to label a Discography."
,retadedmonkey,2008-01-08T15:33Z,"this khan guys a fucking moron!killer collection,and khan the live albums  and solos are extras dumb dick!"
,Polysaturatedfat,2008-01-15T07:57Z,"Bobv, you could also use Wikipedia if you're never sure. :)

In this case, I think you're right though."
,floppy58j,2008-01-24T12:31Z,i dont know why tha hell i need 19 rush albums but by god im gonna download them 
,Ayashi90,2008-01-29T21:18Z,"Great stuff, still downloading at top speed. Remember guys, Rush is an under-appreciated band, so BUY THEIR ALBUMS!"
,extralars,2008-01-30T21:03Z,I've got most of them on vinyl. This is a great way of updating and reviving my youth! Many of these songs were the first I struggled to learn on the guitar. Not the most suitable for a beginner...
,hockeyhead,2008-02-22T05:57Z,Amen floppy. Amen.
,Honesteagle,2008-02-25T18:36Z,"IF you really like the band Rush, u shouldn't download it and buy it in the store, fucking lozers! Its like the best band ever and you retards are downloading it, sadly..."
,winphreak,2008-03-10T01:10Z,"Great torrent, and Floppy is right. Only complaint is the lack of tagging. As soon as I tag it though, uTorrent will freak out."
,funkyman50,2008-03-11T02:36Z,"Incase no one noticed there are two number 8's, thus resulting in 20 albums. This torrent has all 19 studio albums and the live album R30."
,Zell65,2008-03-25T11:50Z,"@Honesteagle
It's not that I don't want Rush to be successful, but I don't buy albums at all. I don't see the point in throwing yet more money at an industry already filled with greed, drugs, and excess."
,Zell65,2008-03-25T11:51Z,Anyone know the bitrate of these files?
,Mac_MAN12,2008-04-25T18:03Z,Seed plz i am stuck at 85.6%

,candylord,2008-06-20T02:23Z,"Downloading atm. Hope this one works..
Nice seed guys! Keep up the good work :D"
,Polysaturatedfat,2008-06-25T19:08Z,"GREAT TORRENT.

All albums have a bitrate of 192 EXCEPT Snakes and Arrows, which is all over the place.

Great torrent, guys, but I got Snakes and Arrows somewhere else."
,Polysaturatedfat,2008-06-26T10:45Z,"BOBV

Dude, seriously, this is a great torrent, and I'm not calling you out, but I gotta say that you need to fucking learn how to properly title each file and embed art into each album, especially with huge torrents like this. 

You do not know how long it fucking took me to re-label each track and add art work, by fucking hand."
,pppoopirate,2008-07-19T23:22Z,"Polysaturatedfat

you should re-post your fixed version of this so we all don't have to do same"
,Markelis,2008-08-06T03:19Z,"@Honesteagle

Rush will only gets a fraction of the actual money made by there albums 

The ones that produced are geting all the cash "
,shawesh,2008-08-16T03:20Z,"Thanks,for this collection >>>>> please seed"
,comixfan65,2008-09-05T02:02Z,Thanx for the download
,Damage_Control187,2008-09-28T06:49Z,"Not even close to all the songs, dude..."
,CrimsonKing94,2008-10-27T23:18Z,Awesome torrent. Looses points though for the lack of titles and not including artwork.
,EbilPhish,2008-10-28T18:46Z,"@Polysaturatedfat

You really shouldn't be doing that by hand. Look up MusicBrainz and download the pircard music tagger. It takes fingerprints or tags and looks up a large database for correct tag information.

It even does coverart but there needs to be an Amazon entry for it (Or another source of album art that has agreed to MusicBrainz  linking them, I don't think Wikipedia even does yet though ?

Otherwise if you have the correct tags, you can generally use another program to scrape the album art in (iTunes does it for you Window/Mac people, for Linux there is Album Cover Art Downloader, Amarok has some stuff too, not sure if it embeds it into the mp3 though)."
,EbilPhish,2008-10-29T00:15Z,"@Polysaturatedfat
Snakes and Ladders is VBR (Variable bit rate). You get higher quality for size, but with the possibility of incompatibility with older players (most work fine though). This is generally the preferred method of mp3 compression. The NFO also lists it as being compressed with LAME which is the preferred encoder.

http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=VBR

I just ran this disography through MusicBrainz Picard and it worked fairly well. Since there seem to be no tags whatsoever on anything audio fingerprinting was needed and some of the songs where detected as belonging to ""best of"" style albums so there is some human intervention required. There seems to be album art for everything though ?"
,Dahnch,2008-11-02T06:41Z,"Exit, stage left"
,quigg,2009-01-10T11:43Z,"If you want a crapload of rush tunes, then this'll do fine, but if you really care about organizing your library or having the live albums, get another torrent.  Seriously, the tags are all mixed up or missing so that it takes hours to fix, and the torrent is missing Vapor Trails, All the World's a Stage, Exit...Stage Left, A Show of Hands, Different Stages, and Rush in Rio.  Thanks for the torrent bobv, the music's great, but it should be MUCH better organized..."
,enragingchaos,2009-04-10T06:12Z,"Just uploaded this discography properly tagged and organized so all you guys don't have to go through the trouble. It took about an hour but they're fixed and nice and neat, now. 

Comment and tell me what you guys think!"
,zorome,2009-06-29T07:22Z,"Is this really their full discography? I DO believe they have at least 32, not 19 albums."
,D7maj,2009-07-09T18:13Z,"corrupteddevil, you're the one who sucks. This torrent works smoothly. You're a n00b that never handled a torrent before. stfugtfo"
,Linuxus,2009-12-27T07:05Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4836661/Rush_Discography_%28bobv_FIXED_version%29

thats the fixed version so you don't have to update the tags... it also skips the singles that are included in albums and stupid jpgs... and skipps R30 Live."
,kirk_88,2010-08-20T15:51Z,"These are the Rush remaster's.Sounds very good,but the songs isn't tagged.
But almost,a great torrent.
Cheers."
,xSICKSx,2011-01-02T02:24Z,"Hey man, good torrent. But for real next time you do something like this. Make the tracks right. It's gonna take me an hour to get this right."
