,briefy,2007-11-01T03:40Z,Doesn't seem to work on my tomtom go 510. Is this maybe because I have the latest software for the device (7.160)? Or have I done something wrong? Thanks.
,nightcat711,2007-11-23T15:51Z,WARNING! Seems that if you upgrade your GO510 to v7.161 the crack is no longer working! Check with author before doing it!
,clayud,2007-12-13T01:33Z,Any news on a crack for the latest firmware version?
,garyonthenet,2008-01-18T15:11Z,"I have applied the hack to my TomTom 510, and it seemed like it would work; however it gets to the part where I am able to select the mp3 song I want to play, but then just goes to the main map display page, ignoring my selection and certainly not playing it.

Any ideas? I am using the same memory card that came with it, with about 30megs left, but other than that I can't think of anything I did wrong.
The fact that everything seems to work right up until that point is promissing, but its the last mile that doesn't gel. Something simple no doubt, unfortunately I am not a Linux wiz."

,piratebay-vpn-user,2009-09-04T17:13Z,"Similiar problem: 
To get the latest maps running on a GO 710 doesnÂ´t work, it is obviously the navcore/ttsystem

Anybody knows how to patch that so GO 710 behaves like a GO 910?
