,shiftwalker,2007-06-05T16:11Z,I wish someone would actually seed.alot of us have been stuck @ 71% for ever.....please
,Meppi,2007-06-06T13:47Z,"Yes it really would be nice if someone could seed, if I just got on my drive I'd be moore than happy to seed.... !"
,ljpedaah74,2007-06-12T06:39Z,"Please seed. I´m also stuck at 71% and I´ve been so for ages. = (

I would be more than willing to seed if I download it. ; )"
,myback12000,2007-06-14T21:36Z,"Stuck at 71.4% for ages. Connected to 70 peers and I see other peers, barring a few, completing the download. Pls rectify, seems to be some problem with the tracker."
,myback12000,2007-06-19T15:34Z,I think I got the problem. It has something to do with the client. Azureus 2.5.x.x are haveng problems as also newer versions of other clients. Downloading with another client. It's slow but happening.
,JoeBlobb,2007-07-08T11:39Z,"pls seed people. I´ve been stuck at 2,83 GiB for ages. Really looking forward to seing this flick..."
,Drakulakun,2007-07-14T14:09Z,"I also ask to somebody seed this, or someone with a full copy re-release this one. For some weird reason, everybody is stuck at 70% or so (including me) for a month already. I can see some seeds, and peers that have a copy at 95%, but can't connect to none. And everytime I reconnect to this torrent (ie, if I reboot my machine), my % drops. Argh. 
Like someone previously said, this must be a torrent error, so I ask again to please someone at least re-release it, since some countries like mine got raped by the publisher of the movie and got a single dvd -- only the movie, no extras (instead of double-dvd, like it was suppose to be). Thanks."
,007ace,2008-04-25T23:14Z,"Sorry everyone, its been so long, I dont have this on my computer anymore.
TPB Still says 1 seeder, but if there are this many problems, I suggest finding another torrent.
If there isnt one for the second disc, 
just post back here and if Ive got some spare bandwidth Ill re-release this one."
,t_s_perera,2008-09-29T17:40Z,I know this is long gone...but is there someone who could re-seed this.I love this movie and I would love to see the second disk..
,187murk,2011-06-20T22:43Z,can you please upload this copy again i been trying to get a hold on the disc 2 and i cant find it elsewhere thanks
