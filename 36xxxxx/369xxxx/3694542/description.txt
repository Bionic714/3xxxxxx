Pans Labyrinth Disc 2 DVD ISO
Ripped from the Special 2 Disc Platinum Edition.
Contains:
English, Spanish, and French Subtitles
English Audio (Stereo and 5.1 Audio)
All extras

Removed:
Nothing

Video compressed to 68% quality, There is less of it so I was able to keep everything in this one. As stated above, Audio is strictly English, and I believe there are subtitles in each language. 

Im Glad to see so many people taking a chance on a release with so few seeders off the start. It just goes to show people are willing to wait for quality.

Again I put the image (actual picture) of the DVD in JPG and PNG formats, (PNG is bigger but handles transparency so well). If u need the cover of the case its in the first torrent, found here:
