,catchow58,2007-07-20T05:50Z,"I'll never forget the first time I saw this.  Mifune is the greatest movie star ever!  He's Shwarzenegger, Brando and Marilyn Monroe all rolled into one!   If I get this, I promise to take a special interest in keeping it seeded. "
,fredoune,2007-09-30T00:15Z,"Same here,

have not seen this movie yet but can't wait and I think such movies being available is one reason why torrents are so great. Will wait till share ratio is at least 3 or 4..."
,Bavzor,2007-12-02T02:08Z,"Dude, this has some guy talking over the whole movie.  

Didn't want the director's commentary voiceover >"
,goverthana,2008-02-21T11:15Z,"Hi guys, need help here, I disabled FFD show Filter instead im using Matroskas Haali Splitter on Media Player Classic, tried using WMP also no picture only sound, then I tried downloading standalone Xvid codec and playing still no picture, what is the problem? should I switch to FFD Show Instead?"
,Lord_Palmerston,2008-06-04T07:38Z,I find it odd that Bavzor was the only one who brought up the issue of the freakishly annoying commentary. Can that be fixed? I'd appreciate some help. I've been excited to see this movie for ages.
,sparky415,2008-07-26T02:24Z,"Nicely done, ty."
,rogerpP,2008-09-25T20:48Z,"Many thanks, d/l now."
,seiryu,2008-10-20T08:02Z,"You can count on me, I will seed like there is no tomorrow... I mean, I will seed a lot! "
,LezDawson,2008-11-19T00:51Z,Seed like the wind!
,LezDawson,2008-11-19T19:45Z,"The subs appear to be badly written with 'I's instead of 'L's, so it's really annoying to read!  I have corrected the subs and posted them here:

,LezDawson,2008-11-19T22:57Z,"I don't get it.  A few people have mentioned the dual audio (film soundtrack + commentary) but I cannot get the commentary.  I've tried with VLC, MPClassic, DivX, I've examined the file properties, and I can only see one audio track.  Has this torrent been changed since the original post?"
,LezDawson,2008-11-19T23:02Z,"Actually ignore my last comment - I'm guessing that when I joined the 2 files (CD1 + CD2) the commentary audio must have been lost.  Strange, cos I used direct stream copying, no further encoding.  Oh well, nevermind.  Thanks for the up. :)"
,Gosu27,2009-12-30T17:07Z,Thank you for the upload. Good stuff.
,Rabbi_Marshak,2010-02-16T02:03Z,"Fantastic quality! As the description says, it's the digitally remastered Criterion Edition: http://www.criterion.com/films/597"
,Rabbi_Marshak,2010-02-20T20:39Z,"If you play it with VLC media player, you can chose between Audio Track 1 (the original Japanese sound track), and Audio Track 2 (Criterion commentary in English)."
,3nipples,2011-11-18T09:30Z,thanks you
,spara666,2012-05-14T03:16Z,"Awesome, great to see the early japanese films available, thank you."
,croakerbc,2012-08-20T02:02Z,Thanks kegir!! Great to see you're sharing great movies with the public.
