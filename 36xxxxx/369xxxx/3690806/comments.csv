,xkexkexke,2008-02-02T10:02Z,"In this movie Jet Li,who is Huo Yuanjia, became famous fighter (martial 
artist) in all China.
Huo Yuanjia's father did not wish for his child to follow in his 
footsteps,but Huo Yuanjia resolves to teach himself how to fight - and 
finally win. Daily training enable him to ace match after match in his 
home region of Tianjin. After an ill-advised fight leads to another 
master's death, members of Huo's family are slain in revenge. Grieving 
and ashamed, Huo wanders the country in shock. Near death, he is 
rescued by women from an idyllic village, and is offered simple 
kindness and generosity that help him heal and regain his equilibrium 
over a period of several years. Huo realizes that the future of martial 
arts lies in sportsmanship and not brutality, and he rejoins society to 
apply what he has learned. Huo Yuanjia returns to Tianjin, takes steps 
to come to terms with his past and finally restores his family's 
name............For more information go to
