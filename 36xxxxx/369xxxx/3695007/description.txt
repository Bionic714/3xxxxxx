Kenneth Branagh\'s Film Version of Hamlet

This is a VHS rip I got some time ago and since I\'ve busted my ass trying to get it from somewere, I gues another one or two of you might just be looking for it as well.

This is the full unedited version and the only full context version of the play ever shown in theaters (the other is Sir Derek Jacobi\'s version made for the BBC a loong time ago!!!).

The film is beeing seeded as I got it divided into sections matching the acts of the original play. 

Included is a rather enjoyable making-of mini documentary and the whole play.

AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS OUT THE FACT THAT MY UPLOAD CAPACITY SUCKS SO I WILL TRY SEEDING UNTILL A COUPLE OF YOU GET THE FILE AND THEN IT IS OFF MY HANDS!!!!
(In some countries we still have crappy broadband connections dear sirs...)

Well, in any case enjoy!!!
