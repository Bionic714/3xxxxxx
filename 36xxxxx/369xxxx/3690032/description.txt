Release Notes:

Sarah, Hannah, and Leah Peasall made their debut as the preternatural voices of George Clooney's wee daughters in O Brother, Where Art Thou? The precocious trio, now in their teens, have assembled a talented behind-the-scenes crew (Randy Scruggs, Jamie Hartford, and producer John Carter Cash) on their second full-length recording -- and first for the Dualtone label -- Home to You. What sets the project apart from similar forays is the talent that emanates from the girls themselves. This is old-timey music in the tradition of the Carter Family, not some flash-in-the-pan quota filler for Nashville's studio elite. Old-fashioned country themes of family and faith dominate, but there's a breeziness to the whole affair that renders it effortlessly listenable. Carter's lazy, front-porch production lends itself well to the girls' refreshingly plain vocals and ample instrumental skills, resulting in a collection of tunes both self-penned ("Logtown," "Gray County Line") and traditional ("Angel Band," "Fair and Tender Ladies") that exudes quality, not commodity.
