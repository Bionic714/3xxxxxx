It would be really good if you could use the IMDB link to actually link to the relevant IMDB page.

When I 1st saw that all your links were to bitvn.com I thought for sure this was some kind of shit where I would have to go to that site in order to download the torrent or the file would be corrupt or something.  

If you want people to distrust your torrents, then fine.  If you want people to download what seem to be a large # of very fine movies then give us a link so we know which movie you're providing.

Thanks bud"
