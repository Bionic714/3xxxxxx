,Uncle_Ian,2007-07-05T11:02Z,"The music files sound just fine, and the whole thing flew in very quickly just now- speeds of 200-300 kbps.  I didn't bother downloading the ""how to get a Playstation 3 for free"" file, what ever that bullshit may have been. 

I'll be seeding for a while, doing my filesharing bit.  It's a habit I developed back in the day of the original Napster, something today's leeches are ignorant of."
