,Kjeitulf,2007-05-25T07:27Z,subs?
,Guilba,2007-05-25T16:20Z,"Sounds interesting. Would you be seeding part 2 as well?
Thanks"
,Pyatin,2007-05-26T18:16Z,"This doesn't have subtitles, but yes, both parts are seeded.  "
,Pyatin,2007-05-27T04:07Z,"Glad I could be of help.  I would be most appreciative if others will help continue to seed this so I can bring more extremely rare gems.  My upload speed is limited with all I have available, so having multi-seeders will allow me to reduce bandwidth for files already uploaded to others and allow me to possibly add 1 or 2 extremely rare items a month."
,Pyatin,2007-05-27T04:08Z,Part 2 related to this file can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3696664/Earth_Star_Voyager_Part_2_DVDR_ISO
,Pyatin,2007-05-28T23:42Z,I've been working on getting it setup as such.  I will not release my connection of seeding these movies unless I see at least 5-10 more seeders.  I don't care if it takes 6 months.  This will make it to all who desire it. (hopefully sooner though) ;)
,Pyatin,2007-05-29T21:38Z,"I also monitor all my seeds, so if I see it's not seeding by anyone, I'll open up bandwidth to seed it again."
,Pyatin,2007-05-30T08:42Z,"I noticed that the trackers showed offline for a bit today. I am seeding this and as long as others seed, you will get the file. It just means ""temporarily"" people might not be able to start the torrent if it's not already seeding to them.

I'll keep an eye on this, and if it fixes itself, don't expect a reply. If it doesn't I'll reseed and will post all pertinent info.

Hint: The Secret World of Og ; The Blue Yonder (aka: Time Flyer) ; Nate & Hayes ; Combat Academy (aka: Combat High)    Just to name a few on the slate. ;)"
,Pyatin,2007-06-05T08:05Z,"These are in ISO format.  If you have a DVD burner, the format will automatically be recognized by the burning software you use and create a usable disc.  There is also software to read iso files as video.

www.videohelp.com has tons of useful programs.  "
,Pyatin,2007-06-15T22:19Z,I'm redoing some of my storage disks and adding another 2TB of space for upcoming uploading.  I apologize if you see holdups now and again.  Please be patient.  I have not stopped seeding.
,unperfectx,2007-08-13T20:26Z,"Please Reseed! I've been searching for this movie off and on, I just barely found this torrent."
,Pyatin,2007-08-14T06:31Z,"I haven't stopped seeding. There are other seeders and leechers connected right now.  Run the torrent, I'm sure you'll get it.  The # of seeders & leechers listed on TPB isn't very accurate."
,unperfectx,2007-08-16T09:05Z,"ok, whoever is on alicia.demon.nl server using client -tr080z-zdk1tdi977bq. I've been uploading what i have to you for the last day, and considering that you're at 54.8% completed, and I'm only at 35.6%, theoretically you should also be seeding to me. Well, you're not, you haven't sent me 1kb. Right now I sit at 0 b downloaded from you. WTF?

and cable-87-116-136-125.dynamic.sbb.co.yu using uTorrent 1.7.2.0.  You're at 100% and all I've gotten from you is 384 kbs in the last day. I'm assuming you're using most of your bandwidth to send to the first guy I mentioned, but as I said before, he isn't reseeding so I think we're all screwed, except for him, of course."
,toasteroven2001,2007-09-17T07:38Z,"Been looking for this FOREVER! Pyatin - I thank you very much for seeding this. A lot of people have been waiting for Disney to start releasing a lot of the gems stored in their vaults, so it falls to people like you to keep us happy!

As soon as I get enough, I'll seed this for as long as I can as well. Let's get it out there."
,Pyatin,2007-09-17T08:34Z,"I have a bunch of rare movies, but few people help seed.  When few people seed, all of my bandwidth is consumed, and I have a Nice FIOS connection, over 14Mbps.  Router ports open and everything full on.  This is for a dedicated line for torrent uploading.  When people don't seed, everyone else gets held up.  Thank you for everyone who's seeded well over 3."
,Pyatin,2007-11-02T08:21Z,"I still have not stopped seeding, though at times my bandwidth is cut pretty low for several other uploads.  I wish I could say there were tons of other people seeding rare shows like these.  I've been forced not to release some because not enough seeders for my existing uploads.  My apologies to all.  If you are patient you will get it.  I've even had to deal with my network connection going out on me recently because a neighbor didn't check for buried lines when redoing a septic leech line. :extreme anger:  In an effort to keep uploading, I quickly used a few External HDD cases via FireWire, and seeded the files at a friends house from a laptop and a 256kbps upload speed.  "
,e-liska,2009-03-12T10:49Z,"Jeez, I loved this when I was younger, I'm so surprised I found it and soo glad it is here -Thank you!"
