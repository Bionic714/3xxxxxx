The Twin Dragons (Jackie Chan, 1992)

HKFlix Says:  	3 Stars

Though there are plenty of great action scenes and comedy, we feel that Teddy Robin's character is a constant source of annoyance throughout the film.

Avg. Rating: 	
  3.6 / 5 (based on 4 ratings).

Plot:	Starring in dual roles, Jackie plays total-opposite identical brothers who become unwittingly mixed up in a hilarious case of mistaken identity!

Overview:	It's the Comedy of Errors Hong Kong style as Jackie Chan does his take on Van Damme's Double Impact. Chan plays both Boomer and John Ma, twins seprarated at birth. The former is a streetwise HK race car driver, the latter a classical pianist and conductor. Boomer is in trouble with Boss Wing's triad. If he doesn't do them a favor they'll off his diminuitive friend Tyson. John has returned to Hong Kong for the first time to conduct a symphony. Can you see where this one is going? At first they aren't aware each other even exist, which causes no end of confusion, especially amongst prospective girlfriends Barbara (Maggie Cheung) and Tammy (Nina Li Chi). Even after they find out the truth things don't get any better. In a hilarious scene Boomer ends up having to conduct the symphony while John gets stuck driving in a plan to spring Boss Wing's boss from police custody. The two finally manage to get it together and go to deal with the bad guys in typical Chan-esque fashion, this time in a spectacular battle in a car testing plant.
