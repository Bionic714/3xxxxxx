Oceanbase is a netlabel devoted to crazy, varied, and above all interesting electronic music.

Here's our latest release, the lean, mean "and" EP by Scrap Heap, in high quality MP3 format. Cover art is included at 300 dpi for printing, should you feel inclined. Here's the skinny on this release:


1. Bad Vibrations   [2:03]
2. and   [2:26]
3. Fight Your Instinct   [2:51]


It wouldn't be entirely correct to say that we value quality over quantity here at Oceanbase, but we can see where you might get that idea after listening to this short but salty EP from Scrap Heap.

The title track "and" provides slow, smooth ambient techno, and it's sandwiched between two of the most driven, in-your-face beat assaults we've released to date.

This EP may be brief, but it's guaranteed to leave an impression, if not an impact crater: Crank up your volume and enjoy.
