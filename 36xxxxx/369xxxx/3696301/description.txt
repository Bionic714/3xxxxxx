Zoom Tour Live was filmed at CBS Television City in Los Angeles in May 2001 and was originally intended to be a dress rehearsal for a follow on tour to promote the Zoom album. This never really materialized due to poor ticket sales, so that makes this recording all the more important to all of the disappointed ELO fans. The show kicks off in a grand fashion as the giant pod-like spaceship, that has enveloped the stage, begins to pulsate radiant blue and white light while individual branches of the pod all start to open and rise upward revealing the band and the fog shrouded stage below. The opening sound effects soon fade into the famous opening guitar riff to "Do Ya" being hammered out by a black suited Lynne, whose trademark dark sunglasses, giant semi-afro, and scruffy beard make him look more like a Muppet character than ever.
