1) After I deleted the two files in english.rar/options the game continued to run in Spanish. Anything I did wrong?
2) The biggest problem is with the engine. It fails after 2 laps!!! Tell me, how can i solve these 2 anoying problems..."

,BC1987,2007-05-31T18:45Z,Thank you very much! 
,BC1987,2007-06-01T15:30Z,"I found a mistake in the game. In the qualifying section, that lasts only 15 minutes, often Alonso and Raikkonen have only one lap that can be counted, while others have 2, so often Heidfeld, Kubica, Fisichella are better than Raikkonen and Alonso at the end of the qualifying. It's obvious that if all drivers have 2 'flying' laps(that can be counted), Ferrari and McLaren will always be the best, but now it's mixed up. For example, Raikkonen was 6th and Alonso 7th in the qualifyling today! Is this fixible?"
,titanic12,2007-06-01T17:43Z,how do i run the game?? 
,titanic12,2007-06-01T17:55Z,anyone?? please!!!!!
,BC1987,2007-06-01T18:49Z,"Read the instructions on this page. And, I'm waiting for the solution for the qualifying. In my opinion, if the qualifying lasts 30 minutes, everyone will have at least 2 counted laps, so there won't be any problems..."
,BC1987,2007-06-01T20:36Z,"In F1 99-02, the qualifying lasts 60 minutes, so there were no problems. Every driver has, at least, 4 counted laps, so they 'know' that there is enough time. What a pitty such a good version, but only one, but very big problem..."
,BC1987,2007-06-02T18:29Z,"OMG, this isn't fair from you, you have to answer me!!! This bad qualifying ruins the whole race! You have to answer me! I had a proposal, just make the qualifying section 30 minutes. I'm 100% that Kimi, Alonso and others won't be at the middle on the start!!!!"
