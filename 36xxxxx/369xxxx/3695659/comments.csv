,diesel_ninja,2008-02-08T04:12Z,Is this an NTSC version?
,drgmdp,2008-06-24T08:26Z,this movie sucks...
,Summersky,2008-06-26T23:46Z,"Says that the audio contains both Spanish and English. Not true. This is Spanish only!!

What good is uploading a DVD if you're only gonna offer it in Spanish?

So...unless you speak espanol...don't bother with this one.

And no, It's not NTSC. It's PAL."
,Summersky,2008-06-27T02:09Z,"My apologies. This film does indeed include and English audio stream. I had overlooked this before and was looking at the wrong video folder. Therefore, yes, you can enjoy this film in English or Spanish.
However, you'll still need to convert the video fro PAL to NTSC. I personally use 'ConvertXtoDVD' for this. It does the job just fine.
Sorry once again for any confusion. "
