Virgin School follows the emotional and physical journey of 26-year-old virgin James as he embarks on a unique four month course for sexually inexperienced men, in Amsterdam. Situated at Aquarion, an established 'school for love and leadership', the course is designed by experienced professionals to boost his self confidence ? both socially and sexually, and concludes with the opportunity for him to lose his virginity to one of the sex therapist coaches.

According to a recent study (by Radio 1, MTV and Durex) the vast majority of people lose their virginity between the ages of 16 and 18. However, there is a small section of society who remain virgins well into middle age. Around 4% of people haven't had sex by the time they hit 25.

James is one of them. He's 'never even got to first base.' He says that 'Being a Virgin you get judged, you're isolated, an outcast. For me losing my virginity is a rite of passage, it's about becoming a man and feeling like everyone else, feeling that you're not abnormal'.

James had previously given up all hope of ever having sex or having a meaningful relationship with a woman but that could all be about to change as he heads off to Virgin School.
