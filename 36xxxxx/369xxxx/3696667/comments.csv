,Astralia,2007-05-25T17:57Z,Why not split up the videos in separate files?
,Pyatin,2007-05-26T18:13Z,This was a straight rip of the main feature from the DVD.  Removed menus and commentary to make the file smaller as it is but also try to keep the bitrate quality fairly high.  Having multiple people seed would be greatly appreciated.
,Pyatin,2007-05-28T00:09Z,"Thank you to all who help seed this.  Because so many have helped, I think I can reduce the bandwidth on my end enough to bring out another rare and/or hard to find file.  Please continue to help seed.  You are helping me help everyone."
,Pyatin,2007-05-30T03:41Z,"I noticed that the trackers showed offline for a bit today.  I am seeding this and as long as others seed, you will get the file.  It just means ""temporarily"" people might not be able to start the torrent if it's not already seeding to them.

I'll keep an eye on this, and if it fixes itself, don't expect a reply.  If it doesn't I'll reseed and will post all pertinent info."

The second track, ""Evening Falls"" is my favourite. I didn't give much thought to it before, but once I saw the video, I sat up and took notice.

Thanks for the share."
