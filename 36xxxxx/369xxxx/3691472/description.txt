Around the world, by every measure, America's reputation and image has never been

problem between the US and the Islamic world

In this first of two programmes, journalist, broadcaster and American, Michael 

Goldfarb, looks at the rise of global anti-Americanism and tries to gauge the scale 

of the mood shift and understand why feelings are running high.
In Venezuela, Michael looks at the tortured history of the US and Latin America, 

from the Nixon era to the present day.
He also attempts to unravel the complex politics driving Venezuela's president Hugo 

Chavez's stand against US president George W Bush.

In this second programme, journalist and broadcaster, Michael Goldfarb, travels to 

Istanbul to continue his investigations.
Here he finds a marked downturn in attitudes.
Turkey is a secular democracy and Muslim nation. It sits geographically and 

politically between East and West and as recently as 2000, Turks had a 

comparatively favourable view of the US.
A more recent survey showed that now just 12% of Turks see the US in a positive 

light.
As popular culture, cinema and books begin to reflect this change, Goldfarb asks 

what can be done to restore trust.
