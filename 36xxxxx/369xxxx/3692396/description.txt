This is the bonkers GTi W12, a heavily tweaked Golf that can churn out 641bhp and 530lb ft of torque. It goes without saying then that the performance will be exceptional; Volkswagen reckons this beast will do 0-62mph in a blurry 3.7 seconds, while the top speed is a supercar-defining 202mph. Providing this power is a 6.0-litre 12-cylinder engine as used in the Phaeton luxury cruiser, which has been tuned to give an extra 200bhp. Like any true exotic, the W12 engine is also mid-mounted to improve road holding, and the drive is channelled to the rear wheels via a six-speed automatic gearbox.
