,parquedematt,2007-12-12T05:36Z,"you're welcome.  the more I listen to Sigur Ros, the more I like them.  I just recently got Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do and was just mesmerized by the beauty of it.  Not to mention, Takk is an album you can practically listen to from start to finish again and again and love it every time.  Agaetis Byuren definitely has some great tracks as well.  So far I've been a little disappointed with Hauf-Heim since any hardcore fan already has most of these tracks from one place or another but still some gems there as well.

I would honestly argue that Sigur Ros is probably one of the most forward-thinking music groups at the moment.  I love how you look at their live shows and there's no distinction of age, race, class, gender, etc. - just people who love good music."
,eruiluvatar,2008-02-27T04:30Z,"hey
thanks for this torrent!
i only have one or two more hard to find EPs before i have the complete Sigur Ros discography.
I will upload the complete discography soon once I finish, because I am a freak with ID3 tags and correct everything because other Sigur Ros torents are slack on that.
Thanks again.
Also, on Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do, you can fuse the 3 tracks together playing simultaneously and they make a beautiful fused song. I have done it and it sounds awesome. It will be in my upcoming torrent if you want to wait, or you can mix it yourself - I suggest listening to the fusion of the tracks as it sounds great."
