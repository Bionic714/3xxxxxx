Rik Mayal and Adrian Edmondson are back - even bigger and more Bottomly
than ever - with Bottom Live 3 Hooligan┬┤s Island. Filmed during their sell-out 
1997 tour we find Richie and Eddie marooned on a desert Island in the
middle of the pacific.

Will they build a raft and escape? Grasp the opportunity to embrace the
earthly paradise around them? Or will they simply bicker and fart, fight, puke,
poke and masturbate their way trough 100 minutes of the most hilareously
outrageous live situation comedy on offer in Britain today?
