Full Avantasia discography

Avantasia (The Metal Opera) is a symphonic metal project created by Tobias Sammet, vocalist and frontman of the power metal group Edguy. The project's title is a portmanteau of the words "avalon" and "fantasia" ("fantasy") and describes "a world beyond human imagination" (a quotation from the booklet). The project consists of two CDs containing 23 pieces, which tell a fictional story about a Dominican monk, Gabriel, in the early 17th century. On December 28, 2006 Tobias Sammet announced to be working on another conceptual album with different musicians and singers.
