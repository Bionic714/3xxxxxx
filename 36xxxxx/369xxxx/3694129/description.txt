Sonic_Design represents a strong statement in Rock Fusion guitar world. This CD can be described as an eclectic but cohesive mix of songs. The styles swings comfortably between heady Jazz Fusion and lighter Rock Fusion with extremely catchy melodies.
Benvenuti' s guitar style is best described as effortless. Every track on Sonic Design is crammed with imaginative and super smooth legato lines, contrasted to wonderful effect by a highly percussive and advanced hybridfinger picking style. It' s clear within Benvenuti' s world technical ability never overshadows the melody or direction of the song. It' s also worth mentioning Benvenuti' s masterful touch, he always sounds musical and in total control.
In addition to Benvenuti' s incredible technical skill and energy, the CD features high-powered guest guitarists, such as the world-renowned Frank Gambale (Chick Corea, Vital Information) on two tracks and the amazing Prashant Aswani (Greg Howe, Herbie Hancock) on one track.
