- Release Notes
* 592x336 vs 624x352 from disc ch source
really makes no difference.
* As explained last week the motion in this
rip is much more fluid then that of others that
have been deinterlaced to 29.97fps. this makes
29.97fps look choppy.
* Still compatible with interlaced tv since the 
output device will interlace it with no motion
loss. if watching on pc set display to 60Hz or 120Hz
* any later rips of the show will be under 350.00MB
* Enjoy
