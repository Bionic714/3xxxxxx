,thehun,2007-05-23T17:08Z,"Thanks,  But Ihope  you can use TPB as
the primary tracker  since  Demonoid
is a private site  ALMOST and the tracker
does not function at 100% sometimes.

either way nice encodes

CHEERS"
,death734,2007-05-23T18:35Z,"TPB tracker is still being used in the tracker list.
i normally don't use it but just wanted to get a little more accurate stats at that site"
,thehun,2007-05-23T19:21Z,"Thankyou very  much sir TPB should be the
primary tracker.....


I like TPB  traker vs. Demonoids seems more stable
 happy  that you  shared 

THKS....so much..."
,archdude,2007-05-24T05:34Z,ya TPB's downloaded count is always half of what it really is
