Dutch and his group of commandos are hired by the CIA to rescue downed 
airmen from guerillas in a South American jungle. The mission goes well
but as they return they find that something is hunting them. Nearly 
invisible, it blends in with the forest, taking trophies from the 
bodies of it's victims as it goes along. Occasionally seeing through 
it's eyes, the audience sees it is an intelligent alien hunter, 
hunting them for sport, killing them off one at a time.
