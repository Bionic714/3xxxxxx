1999, Claremont, California. Middle-class kids, in their 20s, talk trash, wave guns, hang out in a pack. Johnny Truelove, drug dealer and son of a underworld figure, threatens Jake Mazursky, an explosive head case who owes Johnny money; Jake responds by breaking into Johnny\'s house. On impulse, Johnny and a couple pals kidnap Jake\'s 15-year-old brother, Zach. Zach\'s okay with it, figuring his brother will pay the debt soon. Johnny assigns his buddy Frankie to be Zach\'s minder, and they develop a brotherly friendship. Zach parties with his captors as things begin to spin out of control. Group think, amorality, and fear of prison assert a hold on the pack. Is Zach in danger?
