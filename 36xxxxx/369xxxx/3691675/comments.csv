,rogerd,2007-05-20T09:57Z,"I have only tested with XP and it works fine. From other user's responses it indeed seems that it does not work with Vista. 

If somebody gets it to work with Vista, please post a comment."
,Faust_xx,2007-05-20T14:41Z,"Finally we got this crack, but i can't run any of the episodes anymore now that i upgraded to Vista, tried disabling DEP and UAC but no luck... anyone got a solution to get em working on Vista? =("
,DanMUFT,2007-05-20T16:39Z,"The games already has some issues with Vista, and apparently they are supposed to be fixed in bugfixes that will come with the CD/DVD when it's released retail and when it is shipped out to season 1 customers."
,Bukkaneeri,2007-05-22T15:38Z,"Thanks for cracking me up, little buddy."
,Sture_Ture,2007-05-22T17:39Z,"Verily, verily many thanks!



(I'm gonna buy at least one episode from Telltale, I think they really deserve support)"
,cjval,2007-06-02T17:26Z,"I'm very disappointed, that the crack does not
work under Windows Vista 32-bit, although the
demo version of Episode 4: Abe Lincoln Must Die
works just fine, but after copying the cracked
file, the ""Program Stopped Working..."" issue
displays...
Too sad, I'd say, but thanks anyway for the
torrent.
//the cracks for the other episodes works 
perfectly with Vista//"
