This 4 CD-box contains the world\'s first complete musical interpretation of all the poems in the J.R. Tolkien\'s masterpiece \'The Lord of the Rings\' set to music by Caspar Reiff & Peter Hall. 14 soloists, among these the world-famous actor Christopher Lee, and more that 150 professional musicians, have taken part in the ambitious project, which took 10 years to complete.

The songs help one relive \'The Lord of the Rings\' in an entirely new way, as they range from happy and funny hobbit folk-songs in the beginning of the book, to evocative and dramatic highlights towards the end.
