,rvec,2007-05-26T15:59Z,I think I'll wait for some dvd rip or even better HD. This way I don't think it's as good as it should be.
,Murky6,2007-05-26T16:09Z,whats the quality like???
,Leeeeroy,2007-05-26T16:35Z,SEED! only 2-4 Kb/sec...
,losts3raph,2007-05-26T16:58Z,i can't get a seed D=
,mikethejones,2007-05-26T17:04Z,"    Wow.  This is the worst download speed I've seen here.  It seems to me that there are people out there under the impression that they might be tracked if they allow their bittorrent client to share the file.  It doesn't matter if someone shares or just downloads.  If the seeder has Azureus,  then they already know EVERYONE'S IP.  If the leechers allow their client to share while downloading,  everyone's speed increases.  This will allow everyone to reach their 1.000 ratio,  though I don't think most people even care about that like they should,  much faster and remove themselves from the swarm sooner.  The network can't be completely reliant on seeders."
,grizzly2,2007-05-26T17:53Z,thx for the movie...

,p2pkiddies,2007-05-27T00:34Z,"The problem is that if you dont seed yourself no one will seed to you, thats how the torrent-system works. I seeded in 200kb/s and downloaded at 200kb/s, no problem there. It always goes slow in the beginning, but if you seed as much as you download you WILL get better speed."
,Leeeeroy,2007-05-27T01:19Z,"oh my fucking god!!!
the qualtity is bullshit!

can't belive why people upload movies that's filmed on a cinema.. seriously, don't waste your time -.-"

,RaDoNix,2007-05-27T02:59Z,"just a tip from me ;) This movie should be viewed at the cinema, its a big difference of your impression youll get if u view a cam instead of viewing it at the cinema.. I understand that you download the cam version instead but I got a much better impression of the movie when i viewed it at the cinema...and i thought it ROCKED! ...but thanks to those who risk being caught to let us have the movie...but trust me go to the cinema and view it there..but anyway enjoy the movie :)"
,mongoose84,2007-05-27T09:37Z,watch the movie in the cinema you cheap morons!!!!

thx for this upload, now i´m just missing a swesub :)"
,sewe,2007-05-27T11:46Z,"its not a screener u r-tard..
its a TS (tele sync) 
it means they use a cam to rip the video, but the audio is ripped directly from the source. 
a screener is like a pre release the studio sends to those who rate the movie or something like that.

so this is not DVD quality, but it is free! whiners      "

,Vampyre_Byte,2007-05-29T15:20Z,"Downloaded this and been seeding for about 20 hours now.  Great up, OK quality (watchable, like a shitty VHS tape).  Nice job on getting it up so DAMN QUICK, too!  

note to the people having trouble watching/burning downloaded stuff:

There's like hundreds of sites with all sorts of FAQ and forums on the problems yer havin.  If you wanna COMMENT on the torrent, fine.  But this is the pirate bay, not tech help central.  Every second damn torrent on this site has someone saying ""It won't play!"".  Surf a bit and you'll find the fix in no time, and won't look like a dork."

(If this is your very first time downloading a film you´ll need a good player to watch it.  I and most people here recommend the ""VLC media player"" which you can download here on the site.)  Hope this helps. /Lixifer"
,Lixifer,2007-06-04T14:03Z,"Forgot..  First you´ll need to uncompress it using ""winrar"".  Then u can watch it with VLC.  If u still want to burn it you can use ""nero"".    Sounds messy i know but it´s easier than it sounds. :)"
