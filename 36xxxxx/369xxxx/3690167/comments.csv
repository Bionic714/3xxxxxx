Looks like it's recorded using a digitalcamera.
Honestly, you can't even look at it without passing out.

Don't know if it was this release but one atleast had 5 minutes missing at the beginning and the end.

The best quality I've seen so far (It still sucks) would be 28.Weeks.Later.TS.XViD-FuZe  Atleast it's not all orange."

,lunatune,2007-05-26T13:38Z,I was able to play the whole movie using Windows Media Player 11 with AVI Codec Plus Pack 2 installed. Surprisingly I could only get 10 minutes of it to play using either the latest VLC media player or GOM player.
