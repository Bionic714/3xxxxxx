I got this message which said i needed to ""Download Free playon.play3w.com to watch this movie.""

There is no such site, and no such program, and from what i've read it's some sort of Trojan. Spare yourself the time and check out one of the two other torrents for this episode.  Core if you have a good explanation on how i can watch it, plz tell me!"
