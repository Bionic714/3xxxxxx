,zeobo,2008-05-11T02:00Z,i get a dirty disc error when trying to play. all files where copied to hard drive. anyone else having same prob?
,ro_obin@msn.com,2008-12-23T00:14Z,ReinieR89 i have the same problem as you. I think everybody else has it too. Tried to download it again from scratch and still the same problem.. 
,unsec,2008-12-31T23:49Z,Well ... the real problem is with source nrg file that is faked. When you burn this file the xbox dvd is half empty - without warning files. And now the solution - use UltraISO to rebuild the source file from nrg to iso. Next use standard xFER202 to extract iso and transver all to xbox. The game is working - now I will play with my lovelly wife... Happy New Year 2009 for all good people. Heil for The Pirate Bay :)
,unsec,2008-12-31T23:51Z,"transfer all to xbox hdd or burn the dvd, off course :)"
,x.elion,2009-08-28T20:14Z,"Hi there. [I've constructed this fail-safe guide for you guys out there having trouble getting it to work correctly.]

1. After 'converting' the *.nrg file to *.iso using MagicISO, I extracted the contents to a folder on my desktop with xFER (ver. 2.02). 
(xFER would for some apparent reason not let me transfer the archive!) 

2. Then I used FlashFXP to tranfer the extracted ISO to my xbox

3. Then I played the game:)

Best regards,
