,Sergios5,2007-07-01T11:58Z,Whooooa! You are the king!
,psyclone1982,2007-10-06T04:59Z,Obviously not! HAHAHA!!!
,Gianni_Carlo,2007-11-05T16:04Z,"Interpolice, why exactly do you go around bitching on everyone else's torrents and telling them how to do their stuff while you do not even upload any files yourself?"
,3vilSheep,2007-11-11T00:32Z,"Thanks for the torrent, and it is true that a 7GB download with only superficiall info is rather risky. However, you can see what files are included in the torrent file, using your bittorent client (@ least in Azuerus u can) so you can check the torrent from there, and choose to download only a small fraction of it to check it's contents :)"
,dochanks,2007-11-11T19:33Z,I've. got some Fansadox Collection pdf. files which are p/w protected...any help would be greatly appreciated...Thanks for all the good stuff...
,george_james68,2007-12-24T09:35Z,"Hate to say this guys, but most of us don't have access to a t1 or better line, so smaller bundles would be a help to us. Here in the Philippines a decent connection is a luxury, but even when in USA, smaller would be better for most of us  Thanks IMHO George"
[T],CaptOmerta,2008-04-23T17:30Z,"One of the best packs of this genre.

Let's keep this one alive you leechers...give back 1:1 and open the bandwidth above 10 kbs "
,longheel,2008-10-23T07:36Z,Thanks for the upload!
,Joopa81,2008-10-31T07:16Z,"bzucino,

This torrent contains childpornographic material from da Silva. I'd suggest that you remove da Silva's comics please."
,JAR_1,2008-11-10T18:04Z,"Great upload!

Btw, Yo Joopa81: Also go ahead and ask to remove the angels from paintings in the Sixtine Chapel..!

Assuming that you've had 13 months of agony with this, simply download Passware (check on this site), download it and there you go.  There's also loads of other appz to 'unprotect' PDF files.  Good luck!"
,Piox92,2009-01-23T02:44Z,"If you have uTorrent or anything like it, you sould just pick and choose what you want to download."
,curlykale,2009-06-04T18:33Z,"Please get rid of de silva's work, it really does show child pornography and is extremely sickening!"
,curlykale,2009-06-04T18:37Z,"Hey jar_1, religious paintings don't show a young girl being raped in both holes and mouth including the bloody mess that causes????"
,Doodlepieguy,2009-06-07T01:36Z,"de Salva is covering The 120 Days of Sodom. If there is a classic of Sadistic literature, that's it.

I understand that might not change the opinion of anyone offended -- knowing that it has offended people for years and will continue to, but perhaps it might explain how Sade's influence isn't going anywhere ..."
,spikke90,2009-06-08T04:46Z,just do a virus check yourself
,qmilk,2009-07-16T20:08Z,"Hi guys!

Please seed I'm stuck on 80%+"
,qmilk,2009-07-29T08:31Z,"Yesterday I was up on 98%, now I'm down to 82% again. Why is that?"
,rising.force,2009-11-28T13:09Z,"Tryed to download it but found out that it is full of heurisitc viruses and trojans.
DONT BOTHER WITH IT!"
,labassistant,2010-06-21T23:23Z,This appears to be all images. I don't see anything that could carry a virus. I'm guessing Rising's virus software is configured improperly or the virus was already resident on his system.
