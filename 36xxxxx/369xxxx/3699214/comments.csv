,buzz_uk,2007-05-28T13:44Z,"so basically this is a full version, but uncracked so only the first level will be playable until a crack is released.
still worth grabbing i guess if you haven't already got the version that was uploaded a week or so ago."

Play the single player campaign without activation

I'm not going to take credit for this, but people seem to be missing the posts where it's explained more briefly. Beware, this method takes up 2.5 gb of HD space.

(alternatively, if you're low on HD space, you can only have backups of the three maps you're playing at the moment, plus the maps 00a, 01a and 01b. This should limit the ammount of required space to about 1gb)

Also, if you're wondering why there is are no 02a_something or 02b_somethingelse. That's normal, nobody has those.



0. Install Halo2, use the ""Instal first"" option.

1. Go to the folder Halo 2/maps

2. Make a backup copy of the maps starting with a number/letter. Thus, make a backup of ""00a_introduction.map"" all the way to ""08b_deltacontrol.map""

3. rename the map you want to play to ""00a_introduction.map""
3a. Rename the next map ""01a_tutorial.map"" and the one after that ""01b_spacestation.map"" to play 3 maps in a row.

4. Start the game

5. Go to campaign -> Click ""Yes"" for not being connected to Live (they're sorry ) -> Select mission -> Another ""Yes""

6. Select the mission ""The Heretic""

7. Select Legendary, or a more wimpy difficulty.

8. Play the three missions

9. When you finish the missions, you will be prompted to activate. Click through it

10. When back in the main menu, Alt-tab out of halo2.

11. Delete the following files:
""01a_tutorial.map"" & ""00a_introduction.map"" & ""01b_spacestation.map""

12. Go to step 3.

Greet GIjs keep it up(till the crack)"
,buzz_uk,2007-05-28T21:33Z,"so by using this workaround, are all the cut scenes and plot developments played out as they should be?
being a highly story driven game, without the cut scenes were probably better off waiting for the crack."
,Espionage724,2007-05-29T02:40Z,OMG! Seed this plz! I REALLY want to play this lol. I put vista back on my computer just for this game.
,GatorTex,2007-06-02T06:37Z,I've played through the Campaign using the renaming the maps workaround and can confirm that there ARE cutscenes and playing time missing.  I know the Halo story very well and found myself on more than one occasion almost confused.
