Review:

I've always been drawn to the romantic side of rock 'n' roll (Buddy Holly, the Everlys, the Fleetwoods, the Beatles). The allusive (and elusive) "Please Panic," by the Vulgar Boatmen, seems to carry echoes of them all. Like Buddy Holly's "I'm Gonna Love You Too," the Boatmen's "You Don't Love Me Yet" is an expression of faith in a love the singer is convinced will come someday (the word "yet" is the giveaway). But Holly's buoyancy has been replaced here by a measured patience. "Please Panic.," a collection of simple, infinitely listenable and mysterious pop melodies, suggests what it means to reach adulthood and still believe in the idealism of those songs, still believe that love is around the next corner, that a pop song can bear the weight of your world and, more important, change it. The Boatmen don't see the romantic idealism of pop as youthful folly; they see it as the Grail.
