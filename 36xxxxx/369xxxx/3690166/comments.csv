CAN ANY1 SAY IF THIS IS CORRECT, PLEASE?

Thanx"
,manborn,2007-05-19T18:50Z,pls confirm if english subs are not included
,russell1nash,2007-05-19T22:07Z,"c'mon, 37 seeders and none can say anything about the english subtitles??"
,peter4381,2007-05-20T14:22Z,"For those who are not able to read the description, i'll write an extract here: Subtitles DK NO SE FI

As you can read (?) the're danish, norwegian, swedish and finnish subtitles!"
,ZAPPEN,2007-05-20T21:14Z,"Nice comment ""peter4381""

Sometimes you can wonder if ppl cant read or have some problem with their reading skill.

You can allways read ppls comment talking about subs. Even when the subs are stated in the movie info :D"
,erival,2007-05-21T21:01Z,Not possible to unrar  (pkg 91 damaged
,russell1nash,2007-05-22T03:37Z,"i think some people missed my point!

It makes little sense to post torrents without english subs, simply cause not every1 who can get them and then SEED them too can understand any of the Nordic specs. So it's not a question is being able to read, but of being surprized that people don't see their own interest, i.e., post torrents that will be longer seeded by more people! Not the case with this one, with plenty of seeders, but this is a logical general thing. 
Obviously, this is more of a math thing, then of reading... But i guess its easier to bitch then to think... "
,russell1nash,2007-05-22T03:40Z,"ps: above comments should in no way reflect badly on the upper, that must be always encouraged!  Sadly, i can;t say thanx, since i'm not gonna get this one: danish, norwegian, swedish and finnish are not familiar to me at all! "
,beyondish,2007-05-23T21:31Z,"God damnit, Viggo looks super funny in that BIG hat!!! Crappy movie though. Really crappy."
,ephioz,2007-05-24T14:23Z,"One reason that English subs are not included is that this is a NORDIC release (see the name of the torrent), aimed at people in the nordic countries. There are rarely any English subs included in these releases. Too bad for all you non-nordic people, but then again there are other torrents of the same movie you can enjoy.."
,tinkerbell1960,2007-05-25T08:59Z,It would be nice if some posting torrents remember that sometimes there are deaf people whose first language is English who would love to watch films that contain English subs. How often do they get the chance to do so though?
,Oobrother,2007-05-25T09:04Z,Why would you even need english subtitles when the spoken language in the movie are in english?
,Oobrother,2007-05-25T09:09Z,"PS. My misstake, wrong movie.."
,tinkerbell1960,2007-05-26T16:04Z,Sorry I thought I had explained but deaf and hard of hearing people use subs to follow the storyline. Not all scenes have the actors facing to camera so that they can lip read....
,Mr Blue,2007-05-27T21:38Z,"

,FireWaia,2007-05-29T20:00Z,"And for the love of god, you are on a swedish tracker with mainly swedish people seeding and leeching... Read info, if its not for you... MOVE ON! "
,Uncle Dixon,2007-06-02T14:00Z,"Thanks for sharing. However, I must deliver a warining about the movie itself: The worst crap I have seen in a long time! Horrible story line, incomprehensive intrigues, in total, just a mess. Anyway, this is my opinion..."
,Ullibob,2007-07-27T09:32Z,What program do I use to open the resor.ca file and see the movie?
