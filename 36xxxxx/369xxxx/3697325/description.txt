Eric Draven (Brandon Lee), a rock musician, and his fianc√©e Shelly are brutally murdered by thugs representing depraved master criminal Top Dollar (Michael Wincott). One year later, Eric is brought back to life - and guided by a crow - so that he can seek vengeance on these scummy lowlifes.

Although the idea of revenge has been overdone for years in a variety of films, this film does have its bonuses; it's done with style, it looks great, it has entertaining heroes and villains, and has a decent rock soundtrack. The death of Brandon Lee during filming gives an added sense of tragedy to the whole film. It's so sad, thinking of what happened to him...

I can also tell this was based on a comic book series; it does have that sort of look and feel to it.

I think it deserves at least an eight out of ten.
