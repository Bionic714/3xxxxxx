,peti_k,2007-07-14T09:21Z,"Can any one of you save the game?
When I want to save it it gives me the message:
Save unsuccessful

Does any one get this message to?"
,messor_austerus,2007-07-21T09:36Z,"To save game you need:
1. user name (windows login) contains no language specific characters.
2. ""My Documents"" must be called ""My Documents"" (for Windows 2000/XP) or ""Documents"" (for Windows Vista), any localized name will not be accepted.

What to say.... this part of game made by lamer =)"
