.divx - smallest size but quality blows
.mpg - largest size, quality is ok
.avi - mid size, quality is best

Ive never seen avi go wrong and all other formats have yet to trump it. Given the ridiculously low $/Gb costs of current HD's it would be quite stupid to opt for lower quality just to save a few Mb's.  Would be nice if you would re-release the entire season in avi when the season is over (is there even a season or are they just releasing these at random?). 

As for requests, do you have anything with girls and tentacles? lol, just kidding.

Thanks, keep posting!"

And if you wish to put your logo in, do you mind watermarking it instead of having it solidly colored? Or at least show it for a minute and take it off. "
