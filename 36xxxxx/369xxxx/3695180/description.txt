Shin Chan Encoded into divx for quicker download, compatible with stand alone divx players (burn tested) Episodes - The house is officially unblown, can\'t elope, white face charcoal pants. Plus there is a bonus track this time. The Shin Chan ending theme Encoding is 112 kps into Mp3 format. 

Personally I would like to hear your comments and get a few votes.

First off I have shin chan encoded into .3gp format (cell phone) and would like to know, should it be uploaded? It is near high def. 50mb per episode (average) 19 total episodes. Total size is under 1gig.

Second I would like to know... what else would you like to see uploaded that you can\'t find on torrent sites? (Tv Related or Anime)

Third what is the overall format that you think should be of Sakura7? PSP, Ipod, Mpeg 1,2,4, Divx, Xvid, 3ivx, Avi, 3gp, wmv,  etc.

If you post your comment post it on this torrent. Any other suggestions/questions are gladly accepted.

As always i would like to thank the seeders who upload 1.000 and \"many times over\"
