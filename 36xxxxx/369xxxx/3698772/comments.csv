,cfghyt,2007-05-27T20:39Z,Why does i have to be cracked?
,Todde@Swe,2007-05-27T20:39Z,Is this the pre released one on Winupdate or is it a new one? 
,UndeadDevi,2007-05-27T20:42Z,"Its the latest.

cfghyt: It had to be cracked because Microsoft Decided only owners of Ultimate could use it."
,sondela,2007-05-27T20:43Z,"get you shit together todde & cfg,  dreamscene is only meant for vista ultimate....if anyone wants it to run on other vista versions exampel home premium it needs to be cracked..."
,cfghyt,2007-05-27T20:49Z,"But I've got Window Vsta Ultimate, why can't I get it from Windows Update?

Btw: I have Norwegian Windows Vista!

Therefore I'am downloading this!"
,Todde@Swe,2007-05-27T21:10Z,I was just asking if it was a new one that i don't had. Nothing else so please dont tell me to get my shit together!!
,cfghyt,2007-05-27T22:25Z,How do I know if it workes? And how do I use it?
,cfghyt,2007-05-27T22:27Z,"Stardock Desk Scapes does not work together with this, why?"
,UndeadDevi,2007-05-27T22:29Z,"Deskscapes doesn't work for the same reason DreamScene needed to be cracked for versions of Vista other than Ultimate.

Wait for a cracked DeskScapes."
,cfghyt,2007-05-27T22:36Z,"Okay!.. thanks!

But, I can't make DreamScene to work, what should i DO?"
,UndeadDevi,2007-05-27T22:39Z,"Have you restarted your PC? If you right Click on your Desktop is there a grey ""Play Windows DreamScene""?

Did you get any install errors?"
,cfghyt,2007-05-27T23:16Z,"I have restarted my machine & there is not ""Play Windows DreamScene"" when i right-click my desktop!"
,UndeadDevi,2007-05-27T23:36Z,"Are you using a non-english version of Windows? DreamScene only works on English Versions as far as I know and this version install's its files in C:\Windows\System32\en-US\ so will only work on English Vista. Also apparently this will not run on 64-bit Vista, can anyone confirm that?"
,cfghyt,2007-05-27T23:38Z,"ohh, you see I've got Norwegian Vista!!

Is it possible to get it to work on that version?"
,cfghyt,2007-05-27T23:47Z,"After som tweaking i got it to work on my Vista!

Man It's cooool!!!! :P"
,UndeadDevi,2007-05-28T00:32Z,How did you get it working? I'll pass your method on to the DXM group
,cfghyt,2007-05-28T01:23Z,"The only thing i did was 2 run the patch that you had built into your setup, but i changed the en-US\ to my language!

Simple, and DescScapes does also work now!"
,tramho,2007-05-28T13:28Z,"I don't understand your method.
wich patch do you mean, how to change te language.
And how I run it.

Thanks in advance
"
,larsendata,2007-05-28T20:35Z,"Yes, same problem with swedish.
So how did you make it work?
Did you extract the setup file,if so with what?
Can´t see annything amongst the temp files when you run setup."
,larsendata,2007-05-28T20:36Z,If you uppload the patch whoud be greate.
,ad011i6510,2007-05-28T22:11Z,omg its so easy
,larsendata,2007-05-29T14:23Z,"ad011i6510.

Do you think that everybody knows the things that you know.
I believed that people help't eath other here but, it seams that i was wrong about that, just som bad remarks."
,UndeadDevi,2007-05-30T02:12Z,"Theres a bug in the installer, sometimes it will not set up the registry properly. If it does this simply download and import this into your registy:

,arleybarleyfuture,2007-06-03T13:46Z,"I installed the program and got no right click 'play dream scene' thing. Then I installed the patch and got the right click thing. However, there are no backgrounds installed under personalize. I slowed the installation down and on each wallpaper it says skipped. Please help!"
,halo84748,2007-06-05T20:09Z,Didnt work for me. I have a legit 32bit vista business version. But I have no aero (old video card). Maybe thats my problem?
,juggz143,2007-06-09T20:30Z,yeah you need to be able to run aero to run dreamscene + deskscapes
,vannfitte,2007-06-26T14:42Z,"---cfghyt---

Hei du! jeg kjører oxo Norsk Vista 
hva gjorde du får å få til DreamScene? 
skjønte ikke hva du mente med inlegget ditt.
er jo kun ei fil i downloaden, hva gjorde du for å bytte språk.???"
,habbaba,2007-07-23T16:16Z,"så här gör du om du har en svensk version av windows vista. byt språk till engelska de gör du genom att gå in på kontrollpanelen/klockaspråkochnationella inställningar/nationellainställnigar/tangentbord och språk sen ändra till engelska. sen kommer du kunna installera dreamscene på windows update, sen efter byter du bara tillbaka till svenska
myktlätt :)"
,wingtip9875,2007-08-09T00:06Z,"You must have a Aero compliant video card to use dreamscene as i understand it.

also, please seeed...  4 in swarm and 1 connected=2k/s download...   come on peeps."
,wingtip9875,2007-08-09T03:23Z,"well after taking 3+ hours to download it doesnt work.. i rebooted... i have a gforce 8800, amd5200 dual core cpu, vista enterprise 64 bit version ..... so im wondering if this works in 64 bit...

,wingtip9875,2007-08-09T03:43Z,"woo hoo ive got it working partially...  and yes in VISTA ENTERPRISE 64BIT.  downloaded the deskscapes and several showed in the list for me to choose but some work and some dont...

,wingtip9875,2007-08-09T03:59Z,keeps saying dreamscene needs to be installed which i have so there is a registry problem and the link posted earlier to fix is a dead link.. so off to the net...
,dslyon,2007-09-08T01:09Z,"How exactly did you get this to work in x64 Vista?

I've run the executable, and have so far noticed the Personalization applet being screwed up, and random changes to the system registry, including a reference to a transparent icon that removes shortcut arrows.

What's the deal with this?"
,Taddey,2007-09-30T23:51Z,"Hvordan fiksa du det på norsk vista??
PLS svar =D"
,nocode99,2008-01-05T17:51Z,Is this easy to uninstall?
,terrydandan,2008-07-09T10:46Z,"Confirmed working on Vista Ultimate Edition (Cracked). Enough said... Oh and about the guy crying over three hours, seriously, grow the fuck up, i bet you didn't even upload, did you? Leach. "
,Acesifda,2008-07-15T02:23Z,"hi- i downloaded and ran install- but then when i R-click desktop, personalize- at no point can I find anything that looks like dreamscenes backgrounds... what directory should it auto-install into ? thanks "

,jozex,2009-02-03T21:35Z,Is it true that if you install this... microsoft will somehow find out when you download new updates and block your serial for windows? idk I just saw some guy write that down on other torrent
