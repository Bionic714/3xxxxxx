Overview:	Fans thought that Chang Cheh couldn't out-do his previous star-making box office hits, but once this landmark saga hit the screen, they had to raise their expectations once again. The story was simplicity itself: Shaolin renegades fight against their Manchu oppressors and traitorous collaborators. But the finest martial arts actors, led by revered choreographers Liu Chia-Liang (Lau Kar Leung) and his brother Liu Chia-Yung (Lau Kar Wing), created emotionally involving action sequences of unparalleled effect.
