Album Description

John Shuttleworth is a character created by musician Graham Fellows. John Shuttleworth is a fifty-something unemployed D.I.Y fan living in Sheffield with his wife, Mary, his two teenage children, Karen and Darren and his next-door neighbour and sole agent, Ken Worthington. With the help of his Yamaha portable synthesiser, John Shuttleworth writes fabulous pop songs inspired by his daily life. He belongs to Ken Worthington\'s \'stable of stars\'. When John is not writing songs and playing his synth, John likes nothing more than to go to the Garden Centre for his tea. Through his beautiful music, John Shuttleworth bares his sole, revealing the more poignant moments of his personal life. Vacuum Cleaner tells the upsetting story of the occasion when Mary left him. This album collects twenty of his best tunes to punch the air and stage dive to. From the lows of \'My Wife Died in 1970\', \'From a father to a Son,\' to the highs of \'Pigeons in Flight\' and \'Y-Reg\' this record has the lot. \"A national institution\" The Times 
\"Comic genius\" Metro 2001 

\"Punch the air to character comedy in a class of its own\" The Sunday Times 

\"The Godfather of character comedy\" Evening Standard
