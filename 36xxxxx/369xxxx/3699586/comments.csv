I've viewed HDTV China's releases before so I don't think they are MPAA fakes, but every tool I've used says there is no MPEG2 Stream like an MPAA fake.  I've tried 2k, XP, OSX, media player classic, vlc, wmp11+sdk, video Redo, NOTHING plays any video.  The link for codec downloads fails to complete.  
IF the codec works, please include it in the torrent.  Thanks."

Reinstall a few hundred times and it DOES work.
A nice little write up with the needed software
would probably be a good idea. It would speed
up the torrent too as more people share it.

Instructions to make it work.

1) Reinstall KMPlayer

2) Reinstall Windows media Player 11

3) Reinstall MatroskaSplitter

I also had CCCP and KLCodec paks installed,
but I don't know if they are essential for this."
