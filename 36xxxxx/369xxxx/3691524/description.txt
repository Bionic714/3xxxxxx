Marten Toonder, the father of Tom Puss, was more important to me as a child than even Walt Disney, if you can believe that :-)

The following episodes are all from the Dutch Donald Duck. 

Tom Poes en de Boemel Naar Doezel ("The Sleepy Bumble" 1959 # 9-21)
Tom Poes en de H-H-Handschoenen ("The Gloves" 1964 # 31-48)
Tom Poes en de Waggelgedachten ("The Waggle Thoughts" 1964 #14-30)
Tom Poes en de Weerbrouwers ("The Weather Brewers" 1966 #2-18)
Tom Poes en de Zonnebril ("The Sunglasses" 1963 # 11-21)

My beaten up, torn out pages from those magazines are in a bad condition, so the scan isn't really the best looking you have come across, but as long as no one else cares to scan and share Tom Puss for the benefit of the rest of the world, I guess I have to go with what I have, and that ain't much :-)

Anyway, if you like the magic of Marten Toonder as much as I do, you will rather have a crappy scan than no scan at all.

So ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy a piece of fine comic art...
