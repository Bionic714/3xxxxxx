,420dopeman,2007-05-21T18:05Z,"not-4-you

It may be a security feature, just as in Battlefield 2142, you have to actually buy the game, or search for a weapons unlocker perhaps, or weapons mod pac, dunno, search the net, see what ya come up wit.
 I dont make the games, I just rip-em. 
cheers."

,VirtualSpooky,2010-12-24T12:43Z,"Hey! All works well for the most part. I'm experiencing a few issues though.

1) No into movie? Why is that?
2) Absolutely no music, it is all contained within the C:\Users\00000\Downloads\[PC] Battlefield Vietnam [dopeman]\Battlefield Vietnam\Mods\BFVietnam\music but WILL NOT PLAY. 
3)Seem to be missing some maps! Including: Saigon and Operation Cedar Falls. They are also included inside of the C:\Users\00000\Downloads\[PC] Battlefield Vietnam [dopeman]\Battlefield Vietnam/Mods/BFVietnam/Archives/BFVietnam/Levels


Overall I rate this torrent a 7/10 unless these issues can be addressed."
,VirtualSpooky,2010-12-24T12:45Z,Anyone else found a solution to these problems? T
,RaminRDicksin,2011-01-29T21:50Z,"It is pretty funny to read these comments and people stressing out and no one answers them.
Learn to be resourceful and finger it out, you'll get it to work, lol"
,KyleTheJew,2011-02-25T22:39Z,"For all you noobs wondering if this works, it does and it's pretty epic too because you don't have to install it. It works."
,Chris98999,2011-02-28T03:23Z,"Thanks Dopeman, for this and the many, many other torrents I've gotten from you. Out of all the torrents I've gotten from you, I've had absolutely no problems."

,snoopy9,2011-07-05T00:19Z,"This is not the expansion for BF Bad Company 2. This is the game released in 2004. So I was a little surprised by what I saw, but my bad.

Game works fine though."
,diakosiryann,2011-07-12T05:15Z,seeeeeeeed!! PLEASE
,Wanted4246,2011-08-08T08:18Z,"Now, this is unusual.

When i start the game, there's a ""Black Screen"", and the game doesn't run, then after few times trying, it crashes. Me and my friend share this, he ran the BfVietnam.exe as administrator, it worked. Our computers even have the same specs"
,Cerebral222,2011-08-20T13:08Z,"Perfect; thanx Dopeman, very clean torrent."
,mynameisshu,2011-09-04T14:40Z,WICKED FILE! works perfect
,zingmars,2011-09-28T14:33Z,"FreddieBa -
I really doubt that you have an internet connection capable of downloading something at the speed of 800 mb/s. As of right now that's physically impossible. What you mean is that you download stuff at 800kb/s, and it takes you 25 mins to download 1.26 GBs. "
,Demetriowar,2011-10-04T02:23Z,"I downloaded, tried to play multiplayer, but it sais that the CD-Key is invalid.
Is it possible to play multiplayer with it? If yes... what should I do?
Ty"

,Huubske,2012-01-08T14:07Z,"Please help me! Ive downloaded it, unzipped it, and i get two .exe files. One just doesnt open, and the other gives a black screen for about half a second. @Wanted4246 Open as administrator doesnt work for me, i just get the black screen again. You maybe know what to do?
Please i wanna play this so bad..."
,Tjurbo,2012-02-06T16:26Z,"2,5MB/s, works"
,9twix,2012-02-18T01:03Z,"Hey Dopeman. My only other torrent of yours was Sniper Elite and that works perfectly, so I'll give this a download and seeding - I'll comment again if its utter shite, so if theres no more comments then assume all was well. Cheers"

,XTC19,2012-04-11T21:23Z,"Hey Dopeman, last time i  downloaded this, it required a password, could you tell me the password. :)"
,MrPipa94,2012-04-15T18:56Z,"For those who want to play online:

1. Install TUNNGLE (Hamachi only allows 4+ yourself to the network, so that doesnt work any more for larger networks)

2. Make the account for tunngle (obviously...)

3. Join the Battlefield Vietnam network

4. Go to the game and search in LAN for a game,

5. DONE!


TESTED AND WORKING, only problem is that its just me and my friend there, so we need some players (tired of bots)"
,Concorde1,2012-06-01T21:11Z,"Is it just me or does the radio not work in vehicles? so you can't piss yourself off with Bird is the Word

Other than that it works 100%, thanks."

,antiemp,2012-06-26T05:00Z,"If you want to play online, you need to add your CD key to your registry. This is the only step I needed in order to play via online servers (non-punkbuster servers). Add the following key to your registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREElectronic ArtsEA GamesBattlefield Vietnamergc and set the (Default) data to the CD key without the dashes. Here you can see a picture with a fake CD key: http://i.imgur.com/OsSJh.png"
