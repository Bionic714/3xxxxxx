,vesper8,2007-07-22T00:36Z,"thanks but has anyone figured out how to get passed the ""Freya"" track ? Whenever I hover above it it just freezes the game.. I have all the tracks unlocked but ever since I unlocked the 8th group I can't get passed the 3rd song in the 5th group anymore (freya) it just crashes if I try... "
,smurphyzeke,2007-08-15T20:41Z,"Looks good, thanks."
,skunkyg420,2007-08-18T00:41Z,"Some songs are sorta outta sink, and no matter how I burn it, the game only plays in black and white.
My swap disk works fine, but as soon as the game is in it goes black and white.
Not to mention Alot of the songs are really hard since most of them are only expert level.
Not really a bad try for the hackers guitar world ."
,007ace,2007-10-23T05:04Z,"Its Black and White cause its not the right region for you (its probly PAL)
And if you really want the fun of GH, just play Frets on Fire, its just as good, (Better graphics actually) and you can play any song from GH1 2 or 3 (soon)"
