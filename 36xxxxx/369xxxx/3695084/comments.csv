BTW, this codec really requiers a fast computer.  My 1.2 ghz celron, (which is what I use on my TV), just isn't powerful enough to decode the video in realtime."
,markelos,2007-05-28T13:01Z,Indeed a fast cpu is required but the quality is superb compared to the small size of the files. If you want to burn it on a dvd and watch it on your standalone dvd player use Nero Vision or the latest version of ConvertXtoDvd which supports the x264 codec!
