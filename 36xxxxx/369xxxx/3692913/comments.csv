,putte.b,2007-05-21T07:43Z,actually video ts files are better
,headtoy,2007-05-21T08:30Z,video ts is better
,cropsy,2007-05-21T13:55Z,VIDEO_TS is superior to the other formats. Because it is now ready to edit with vobblanker etc. instead og mounting it in daemontool i.e to extract the files first. Saving time.
,socratesx,2007-05-22T02:30Z,Go with .ISO next time....1 file and that's it...easy to keep track of and if you rip an ISO there won't be any problems with it. I have seen too many problems with Video_ts folders. And who cares about extracting? You got a dvd5 go and burn it...and if you must extract then it takes what? 1 minute? seriously....get a grip.
,El Jafar,2007-05-23T00:09Z,socratesx: I don't know what problems you see with video_ts that you don't see with iso? Both are easy to create again. video_ts has the advantage that they could be stored on FAT32 and ext2.
