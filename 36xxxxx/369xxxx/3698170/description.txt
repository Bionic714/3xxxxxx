READ ME and Sound Issues

However you look at the Dan Burisch case it's intriguing. It is provided here 
for people to draw their own conclusions about how the story interweaves 
with the wider exopolitical and disclosure narratives.

A microbiologist was was allegedly sought out by a more recent MAJestic 12 group he 
claims to have worked on various projects at S4/Area51 involving a J-Rod, 
a 'looking glass' technology and the Ganesh particle.

This video features background and interviews. 

***** It is best combined with the 3 hours of footage from the Project Camelot [see last torrent: 'Serpo, Dan Burisch and Interplanetary Exchange'] *****

This is a conversion from the proper Eagles Disobey DVD part 1. Part 2 
is due out in late summer 2007. Please note that the original disc had 
some sound issues and came out of one speaker. We have re-encoded 
this in mono and split this into a pseudo stereo. This is the 
best that could be done.
