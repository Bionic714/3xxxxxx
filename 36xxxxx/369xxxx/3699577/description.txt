Union Of Knives are a balance of youth and experience, brutality and compassion, dirt and clinical cleanliness. On stage Craig Grant and Chris Gordon play dual frontman roles, supported, like a see-saw on an axis, by Dave McClean. In the studio each member is autonomous, lyrics, beats, melodies and ideas come from everywhere.

The music they make is steely hard, yet cut through with raw, emotive longing and power. Their guitars are loud, but they have no room or need for a drummer.
