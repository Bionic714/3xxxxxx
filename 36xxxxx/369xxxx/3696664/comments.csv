It would be most appreciated if others will continue to seed this file so I can bring more extremely rare gems.  Thanks."
,Guilba,2007-05-30T22:17Z,"I appreciate your effort and really don't like to complain, but I don't think you have enough bandwidth to seed both at the same time. It seems everybody is stuck at 95% on the 1st part.
Thanks"
,Pyatin,2007-05-31T20:35Z,"Many people already have it. You'll probably see it seeding a lot faster now.  The 2nd part is a bit longer than the first.

These are in NTSC format."
,Pyatin,2007-06-15T22:19Z,I'm redoing some of my storage disks and adding another 2TB of space for upcoming uploading.  I apologize if you see holdups now and again.  Please be patient.  I have not stopped seeding.
,unperfectx,2007-08-13T20:24Z,Please reseed! I just barely found this torrent. :( 
,Pyatin,2007-08-14T06:32Z,"I haven't stopped seeding.  Run it, and you'll get it."
,unperfectx,2007-08-15T05:06Z,"I've been trying to download this for the last 3 days, getting close to 0/kps, i've got someone downloading from me that has more % than i do, and I'm not getting anything back from him."
,unperfectx,2007-08-15T05:32Z,I dont think I'm getting anything from you Pyatin.
,Pyatin,2007-09-17T08:37Z,"My bandwidth has been drained pretty bad since few people have been seeding.  Nice connection does nothing when I'm the only one hosting or others allow small amounts of bandwidth.  Sorry if at times it's quite low.  It just means, my uploads are popular again and few people helping seed."
,Pyatin,2007-11-02T08:21Z,"I still have not stopped seeding, though at times my bandwidth is cut pretty low for several other uploads.  I wish I could say there were tons of other people seeding rare shows like these.  I've been forced not to release some because not enough seeders for my existing uploads.  My apologies to all.  If you are patient you will get it.  I've even had to deal with my network connection going out on me recently because a neighbor didn't check for buried lines when redoing a septic leech line. :extreme anger:  In an effort to keep uploading, I quickly used a few External HDD cases via FireWire, and seeded the files at a friends house from a laptop and a 256kbps upload speed.

,usmcdomke,2008-03-29T21:23Z,"Pyatin, you are the best for having this.  I used to watch this as a kid on VHS, but part 2 got destroyed.  For some reason I was thinking about it recently.  Thanks for making it easy to obtain.  I'll keep my seed up for quite some time to help others out.  Later."
,zuckus,2012-04-15T02:22Z,SEED PLEASE!
