,dredog346,2008-12-21T23:37Z,ya any anti virus software will call application programs  ...a trojan...like hey..um..keygens
,Chaos1234,2009-06-08T22:57Z,My Norton Internet Security didn't detect anything and it works. Thanks
,Dantethedvl,2009-08-13T06:38Z,"There are always conflicting reports about whether a program has a virus or not, and a note for all of you, not all keygens are picked up as virus'. I've had PLENTY of keygens for games and they were never picked up as virus'. All I can say is SCAN BEFORE YOU CLICK. When a torrent finishes downloading, SCAN IT IMMEDIATELY. I don't care how excited you are to crack Spore or w/e it is, it isn't worth your comp being bugged up. If you're not sure about what people say on forums, trust what you see for yourself."

,DarthSailor,2010-02-26T22:46Z,"If I got the old 'packed fsg' virus message I wouldn't be worried, but I'm getting ""Trojan hourse Agent2.ZWO"" so screw it. I'll get MagicDisc(MagicISO) instead. It's free and works with the Alcohol 120 files."
