by himself in some other language(i cant guess what it is!) making it very frustrating experience.Thus 2 sounds plays at the same time.But we wont get anything. This happened to me .Anybody who downloaded this earlier may also comment on this.Thanks.."

impersonates a guy whose master is killed by a rival kung fu master. 
Jackie travels with mother and sister to get revenge. Find bad guy, bad 
guy has cut his leg off. Mother gets ill, Jackie works for really bad 
guys to get medicine for mother. Boy gets killed, Jackie blamed. Jackie 
changes side in final battle, mother dies. Bad Guy double crossed by 
even badder guy, Jackie kills the baddest guys and the 'not too bad' 
people are saved...For more information go to

,trntdwn15,2008-07-23T01:44Z,I want to thank JamesKees for wasting my 3 hours of my life downloading this....

I've downloaded several kung fu movies from jameskees and they've all been excellent movies with no complaints at all, I wonder why he'd upload this movie at all if it was as bad as you say, or he should have atleast told us this was how it was, instead of letting people waste their time."
