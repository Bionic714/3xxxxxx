Fortunately there are converters to convert it to ISO.  And the damn poweriso has size restrictions unless you pay to register it.

You can use Acetone ISO or DAA2ISO to convert to ISO format.

Lets stick with Open Standards so everyone can use them without having to install crappy proprietery software.

Thanks for the upload beez"
