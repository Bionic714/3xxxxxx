Overview:	Jet Li stars in The Kung Fu Cult Master, a sword clashing, people flying, kung fu fighting, grandiose epic that will leave you in a bewildered daze. You won't be able to figure out all the characters, much less follow the plot of this truly over-the-top film. Roughly speaking, the movie centers around the conflict for posession of two magical swords which will give their controller supreme power - or at least that's how it begins. A young Chang Mo-Kei (Jet Li) sees his parents forced to commit suicide by the various warring factions, and is himself infected with the "Jinx's Palm" which makes him sickly and weak. This all changes when Mo-Kei learns the invincible solar stance, which gives him invincible martial arts powers. Accompanied by his companion Siu Chiu (Chingmy Yau) he sets off to stop the fighting among the very clans upon whom he's sworn vengeance. However, he can only halt the fighting temporarily, and then a new round of treachery, double-crossing, and deception begins as the various factions seem to turn on each other. This leads Mo-Kei to cross paths with the princess Chao-Min (Cheung Man, who also plays Mo-Kei's mother), who seems to be at the center of it all. Confused yet? Mind you, this is only the barest bones of the story, and it doesn't even begin to describe what this film is really all about.
