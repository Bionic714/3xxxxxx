This movie is a docu-drama based on the work of a British journalist, Antony Thomas, who investigated the 1977 execution of Saudi princess Misha\'al bint Fahd al Saud.

As Thomas conducted his investigation in London, Paris, Beirut, Riyadh, and Jeddah, almost all of those he interviewed off-the-record declined to appear on camera.

\"And so we made this crucial decision to dramatize the interviews,\" says co-writer and executive producer David Fanning. \"That way, we would be able to hide or to mask the people\'s identities to protect them. But we were also able to preserve the journalistic integrity of the investigation.\"

Although the identities of most of the interviewees were disguised, the dialogue spoken by the actors in the film was based on the transcripts of the interviews with the film\'s sources.

When \"Death of a Princess\" was first broadcast in Great Britain in April 1980, the Saudi government\'s reaction to the film touched off a diplomatic firestorm that reportedly included threats to impose sanctions on British business interests in Saudi Arabia and to break formal ties with the United Kingdom. Amid the furor, the British Ambassador to Saudi Arabia was sent home.

The Saudis also protested the U.S. broadcast in May 1980. Mobil Oil, which had extensive interests in Saudi Arabia and was also a significant PBS funder, ran ads criticizing the film in The New York Times and other newspapers. Members of Congress concerned about oil supplies and U.S.- Saudi relations spoke out against the broadcast, while others supported PBS\'s right to broadcast the film. Acting Secretary of State Warren Christopher sent a letter to PBS president Larry Grossman relaying the concerns.
