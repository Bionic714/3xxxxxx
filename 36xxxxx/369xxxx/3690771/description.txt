BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE FACTS

Disguise is the limit. "Martin Lawrence brings down the house" as crafty FBI agent Malcolm Turner who's willing to go through thick and thin in order to catch an escaped prisoner. "Nia Long is captivating" as Sherry, the con's sexy former flame - she might have the skinny on millions in stolen loot, and she's headed for Georgia to lay low for a while. That's enough to send Malcolm deep undercover as Big Momma, an oversized, overbearing Southern granny with an attitude as tough as her pork chops. The result is an outrageous comedy of epic proportions, filled with nonstop laughs and plenty of action!
