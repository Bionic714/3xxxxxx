It WILL be back up around 8:00 PT and on through the night, however.  Like I said, I'm sorry about this inconvenience."
,thantik,2007-05-22T03:59Z,"Thanks for hosting this, if you end up hosting it over the next couple days.  Looking forward to it, lost my CDs a long time ago and I'll be able to listen to these awesome soundtracks again."
,Doc Lithius,2007-05-22T09:25Z,"I sort of lost track of time, folks.  Four hours late, but hey!  It's back up.  ^_^;  And so it shall remain overnight and partly into the morning.  Unless another freaking brown-out occurs..."
,Dead-Inside,2007-06-02T03:16Z,"Hehe, I had the original C&C Soundtrack CD but lost it somehow a few years ago. It's teh sux but the music remains and Klepacki's the best."
,Kumpis,2007-06-16T23:16Z,More seeds would be nice.
,metsapeikko,2007-09-16T09:37Z,"Thanks for the torrent. (But imo, these are pretty low quality mono tracks.)"
,Doc Lithius,2007-09-23T09:51Z,"Re: metsapeikko
Everything before Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 were actually Mono tracks to begin with.  Everything including and past that, however, should be in Stereo.  ^_^"
,zooka,2008-02-03T15:22Z,"thanks man !
I LOVE YOUUU !"
,Doc Lithius,2008-02-26T01:49Z,"Unplayable?  Can you tell me which tracks were unplayable and what player you were trying to use?  All Red Alert 2+, Tiberian Sun+, and Renegade tracks were encoded in Cool Edit Pro 2.0 as MPEG Layer 3 at 128 Kbps, 44100 Hz frequency, 16-bit quality, stereo sound.  They should be playable in any MP3 player program and more than likely any portable MP3 player, though I confess I generally use only WinAMP, Cool Edit Pro 2.0, or my little generic MP3 players."
,VoodooRoller,2008-06-20T03:02Z,"Thank you! The ones from Red Alert and Tiberium Dawn bring back so many memories! As for the Red Alert 2 tracks, I found all of them unplayable in crappy WMP 9, but playable in awesome Media Player Classic :D Then I simply converted them into a playable codec with Switch in order to play them on WMP 9; the only problem is they have no tags. Hope this helps ;]"
,ToadKills,2008-06-30T03:53Z,"So this shit has ""im a mechanical man!"" n shit right!? Cuz the trax on original C&C were the shit!"
[T],Mincan,2008-12-04T02:51Z,Thanks.
,Doc Lithius,2009-01-19T09:17Z,"Now here's something funny.  I recently suffered a formatting accident and kind of LOST all this music, so here I am, re-downloading it!

Keep up the decent seeding, folks!  It's greatly appreciated by me and I assume those interested!  :D"
,Cobbe354,2009-02-06T23:53Z,Wow!! Thank you so much Doc Lithius i've been looking everywhere for these soundtracks! Amazing Torrent. Will continue to Seed :)
,jottabr,2009-02-26T01:29Z,"Oh c'mon.
All Red Alert 1 was 56kbps.
Poor quality.

Blurgh ;/"
,sp4r,2009-07-18T19:20Z,"Oh well, it isn't part of the classic series of Command & Conquer, but Hell March 3, from Red Alert 3, is needed imo.
Just to have all three of them.
But oh well, it shouldn't be impossible to find external.

Thanks for an excellent torrent anyway."
