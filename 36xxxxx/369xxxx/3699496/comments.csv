,Rillian_Zo,2008-04-04T19:42Z,"I know this is not the place to ask this.. but after some googling i got tired of getting diffrent answers ^^and thought i should ask people who acctualy got the program..(sorry for long comment)

I got a good old WD external hard drive.. and it is in  NAF32 format... and when i have over 50-60 files that is over 4gb...(.iso mostly) i need it to be ntfs...

 ive heard many places that this program can make me change the format of the drive to ntfs but can it do so without me loosing all my files?

 it is a 500gb WD Mybook Essential and i have a bunch of files there that i CANNOT! loose.. and i do not have any other drives or hardrives with more space at the time:P

Help would be appreciated^^
and please no silly piratebay whining reply..."
,Rillian_Zo,2008-04-05T02:29Z,"Nvm that last question there ^^  i took the chance to convert the harddrive to ntfs... and it worked ^^ all files there.. works perfect.. ^^

,michalisnik,2008-04-23T18:25Z,This is the real thing. Thanx man.
,yadayadaya,2008-05-08T17:22Z,Uh Windows can convert a drive to NTFS without losing data.  You don't need any 3rd party apps such as this to do it.
,seanm31,2008-05-17T04:09Z,does this work on vista
,renss78,2008-05-22T15:42Z,"the filesystem u got is  FAT32 now Not NAF32, if u want to use ntfs u got much more speed BUT if u want to use ntfs instead of FAT32 u need first to format ur hd(this can with windows, in diskmanager you dont need partition magic for this)than u format it again with windows then u choose the option format as ntfs.
so if u want ntfs u should backup all data on ur harddisk cus everything will be erased."
,richard0474,2008-06-12T03:02Z,"Wouldn't let me make rescue discs.

Told me there were no removable drives available, but there should be at least the CD drive, and my external USB HD, so don't know what's wrong here."
,obytrice313,2008-06-17T20:25Z,"Concerning the question on passing from Fat32 to NTFS without loosing your files (or formating) it's POSSIBLE !

there is a command called ""convert"" in dos (start/execute => type ""cmd"")

This is used particularly for external hard drives which are sold in Fat32 format, when the user wants to put files which are over 4Go, windows sends a message saying that the volume is full, the user gets confused because he has enough place on his hard drive to fit an elephant, so he then reads this comment and finds the answer. So where was I... yes, since Fat32 won't let you put files over 4 Go you need to pass to NTFS, but you don't want too loose your files or don't wnt to do a backup, so you use this Dos command: 

convert e:/fs:ntfs 

(of course you need to click on ""start"" then execute, then type ""cmd"" there...)

""e"" being the letter of the drive which you want to change from Fat32 to NTFS (I'm precising cause some people may have the letter F: or the letter Z: attributed to their external hard drive)

Then the ""convert"" command will prompt you to type the actual name of the drive. Type there the actual name of the hard drive.
! Make sure your external hard drive isn't running (just plugged in) !

,tonyt10,2008-07-15T02:23Z,"This dosnt seem to work on my PC, not sure what advent done to it when they built this in about 2002 i think, but it does not seem to be possible to partition this 80g HD. The OS, windows XP home, is bundled in with the rest of the crap on 3 setup/recovery discs. The app installs fine, i tried 2 ways. first just created a logial drive out of the 1 and only primary C drive supplied with the PC, worked fine in the programme, it listed the operations in the box down there and i preformed them. I then got the message to restart my PC. Just after windows loaded and just before the GUI was up, i got a message on the blue background saying something about its making the changes, it comes and goes to fast for me to be able to read it properly. When the GUI is up i check the Drives and there is only the orginal one there. I reapeated this trying it as another primary, and then tried resizing the C drive and using the unallaocated space. All worked fine within the programm but when pc restarts, it just seems to not have it and reverts back to 1 80h c dirve.   Sigh."

Don't sue me if I'm wrong, but have a look at Acronis Disk Director Suite. I think it works with Vista. If it doesn't it probably will soon. It's more reliable and better maintained than PartitionMagic, which has been left to gather dust since Norton *spit!* bought the program."

A friend of mine said to put it in an computer where there's already another drive and then access the files, but I can access a few files ONLY, the rest I cannot get to, so he said to me to convert it into FAT32 to override all access obstacles, is this the way to go?"
,yadayadaya,2008-09-07T04:16Z,"IronMaskUSA just because you are a tool box, don't get mad at this program.  I've been using it for YEARS, like almost 10 of them, without issue.  As for the error you mentioned, I've seen it before.  Chkdsk fixed it.  And even so, that just made it readable for partition magic.  It still didn't prevent the OS from booting."
