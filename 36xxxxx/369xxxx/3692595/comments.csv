,shadow_ghost,2007-05-20T18:46Z,Sry for my bad upload speed :(
,phunkbot,2007-05-22T00:15Z,"does this thing work ok ? i hope it does, cant wait to get home : )"
,Kian2,2007-05-25T17:14Z,"Can you upload the crack alone? I can download the patch itself from any other place a lot faster than my azureus does, it's the crack that's a problem."
,..rikki,2007-05-27T14:39Z,"to Kian2:
Depending on your torrent application, it's possible to download only the crack. Personally I have Azureus, which allowes me to select the files I wish to d-load.

----------------

I did donwload only the 5MB crack, took only a minute. I just tested it, but no luck: Game crashed due to an ""unspesific error"" right after the loading screen had been visible for 2 sec.

It might be because I had a mod installed (lands to conquer) but I dunno... Right now I'm d-loading the whole package and I'm going to install the patch and apply the ck to an untouched copy of ME II which I saved before modding - thank god.

I'll let you guys know if it works or what.

Hopefully someone else would also post here and let us know if this works on his PC."
,..rikki,2007-05-28T10:37Z,"Well well... I really hoped that this would work, because the game is so unbelievably buggy and unfixed on version 1.0 or 1.1

I patched and applied the crack, then that goddamn ""unspesific error"" and the game crashed after a few seconds of the loading-screen.

Hopefully someone ups a working 1.2 crack soon."
,Karasaz,2007-06-05T19:51Z,"Thanks! =) Works fine! If you want to only download the crack, just desellect the other things since the patch and crack are packed seperatly =)"
,..rikki,2007-06-09T22:29Z,"After tweaking the crack for hours I finally got it to work. I had to reinstall the ME II game, since I found out from the syslogs that some of the files were missing.

I guess I cocked up the mod installing or whatever the hell.

Anyway, it works. Thank god. And shadow_ghost also :D"
,synchro_w,2007-07-05T19:19Z,"i can get 1.0 working but cant install 1.1 update. and the 1.2 update crashes the game. it could be the 1.2 crack that causes the problem. or the 1.2 update got corrupted during dload.
but 1.0 seems to work well enough [apart frm odd crash]"
,Dillethor,2007-08-01T13:51Z,Do you have to instal version 1.1 before this works ?
,murph6290,2007-08-15T19:51Z,i downloaded the torrent. i am unsure of what to do next. how do i unpack it?
,shadow_ghost,2007-08-20T22:23Z,get winrar to unpack it.

,Devirune,2007-12-02T02:20Z,If you got a Mod installed its recommended that you Re-Install the game if it doesnt work with the new patch.
,Devirune,2007-12-04T14:45Z,"Is it just my crappy comp, or does anyone have this prob: When i try to go to battlemode, my screen dies :(  thx in advance for any info"
,StarfishTrooper,2008-02-02T22:34Z,"Downloaded Torrent and used Winrar to unpack, when the set up menu starts it is looking for a previous version of Medieval install. Do I have to download something else?"
,iT-RemeN,2008-06-01T17:39Z,"Ok for everyone who dosent get this to work, just dl the 1.3 patch and the crack and eveything will work.

atleast it did for me"
,danneman91,2009-01-21T22:14Z,"Would be nice if anyone could seed for a while. I really want to get this, so i  finally can play the game. "
,Gunthor,2009-03-11T04:13Z,So anyone KNows If You need to Install 1.1 First From a Fresh Install? Or can go straight to patching it with this? 
,smokeimixgod,2009-07-22T22:58Z,where to copy the crack to?
,Sithun,2009-08-03T07:05Z,"I sure hope the patch file itself isn't modified... Some of us actually like to play the original game ""of the shelf"" and not ""of the bay"". :)"
,mark-b82,2010-01-28T01:08Z,works great for me download in 1 hour took a couple hours to install been playing for a while no problems yet thanks shadow_ghost
,kverse,2010-01-28T05:00Z,"lol i just made an account so i can comment on this i works fine all you have to do is reinstall the game just in case u have any missing files or you have mods installed than after u reinstall the game install the patch and copy and paste the crack then ur all done.
thnx to ..rikki"
,ismellfunny67,2010-03-16T00:40Z,"Works fine, thanks mate. For those of you have trouble with shortcuts, just make the .exe file itself into a desktop shortcut."
,Muzikants,2010-04-28T16:56Z,when I apply the crack and run the game it gives an error! 0/10 
,adityajuneja7,2010-07-26T08:38Z,"when you right click on the crack exe then click on properties then go to details it says 

file version 1.1
product version 1.1"
,hairlija,2010-09-14T23:06Z,"i have a russian version of the game and i dont understand the russian language,so if i install this patch will it convert it to the english language???"
