Synopsis: A modern nightmare nearly becomes reality in this tension-filled story about an "incident" at a nuclear power plant. Jane Fonda stars as Kimberly Wells, an ambitious TV reporter covering a story on energy sources, who is present at the nuclear plant when a startling accident occurs that nearly causes the meltdown of the reactor. A newsreel cameraman accompanying Wells (Michael Douglas) captures the incident on film ?but the television station won?t air the footage. Though the plant?s corporate heads are quick to deny the possibility of any real danger, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon), the plant?s veteran engineer, discovers faulty equipment at the plant.
