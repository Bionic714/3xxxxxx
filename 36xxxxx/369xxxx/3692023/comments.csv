fucking asshole! there is a virus in this package and its not the 1.2 - 1.3, but the 1.1 to 1.2 patch!"
,mathiash,2007-05-20T14:58Z,Weres the activation code?? 
,mathiash,2007-05-20T15:23Z,"Edit* How do u ""remake"" everything so that u are asked to write Serial no, agian, *unistall doesnt work,  ?"
,hb5gq316ab,2007-05-20T17:46Z,"Trojan inside.

The actual keygen is in the package, however together with: winudxFW.exe which installs at least one remote access server: ServUFTP.

I used Sandboxie to trap the processes and gather the *actual* Razor keygen.exe (packages in the other keygen.exe)"
,orion70,2007-05-21T03:26Z,"sorinpiratebay, you def talking 2 much! my comment, about the virus or trojan, should have been the last one on assholes torrent here. got it?"
,Nien,2007-05-22T02:21Z,"Yes, same here.  Noticed a suspicious command prompt window pop up and run things in the background.  Found that it had installed a new service ""Ms-java"" running the ServU server.  Disabled and deleted the source dir it installed to."
,blatter,2007-05-22T09:39Z,"Got this game working sweetly by doing the following.

Installed from first DVD of the Razor1911 (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3685595/Two_Worlds-Razor1911).  Then apply the official 1.3 patch from 2-worlds.com.

Downloaded this file which does indeed contain a virus.  Open keygen.exe in an archiver program such as 7zip or winrar (DO NOT open keygen.exe directly).  Extract the files then open the extracted .sfv file in 7zip or winrar, from here you can extract the genuine keygen.exe.  Once that's done delete the rest of the files.  Run the keygen file to get the serial, start the game and enter the serial when asked, then choose activate by phone, you'll get an activation code, alt-tab back to keygen.exe and enter this into the activation code box and you'll then get an access code, alt-tab back to the game and enter this access code."
,sand80man,2007-05-28T09:36Z,"the keygen.exe is highly suspicious, over 2mb in size for just a keygen program. open keygen.exe with winrar and ull find that its actually an compressed archive and inside it theres 2 files.

the real keygen.exe and another file named windudxFW.exe"
,krimzon27,2007-07-24T05:02Z,Well other than the whole WinREG trojan I see that the number you have to use to register this is in another country and my phone doesnt support it. I dont even know what the deal is with the + in the number. So if you live in USa and you cant call to other countries then dont worry about this and download dopeman's version and his updates instead.
,Royalelements,2009-01-21T02:55Z,"well, almost every Anti-virus program have a habit of going all nuts when you use a Keygen, no matter if it's clean or not. I'm no expert in the subject, but there isn't really much of a thing to worry about."
