Dick Strawbridge and his son James venture out from New House 
Farm in Cornwall to meet individuals and families in cities and 
countryside around Britain who are trying to make their lives greener. 

This week, a primary school in St Albans calls in Dick to cut their 
water bills 

In Cambridgeshire, mechanic Gary gets used cooking oil from his local 
take-away and a visit from Dick and Jim. The result - his own 
bio-diesel production to run his four-wheel drive. 

And on the Wirral, Dick sees the Keenan family get their massive wind 
turbine that'll give them all the electricity they'll ever need.
