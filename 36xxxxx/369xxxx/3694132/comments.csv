,1929,2007-05-23T00:07Z,This is super...
,miguelcampana,2007-05-29T04:10Z,"to do this, i used this great opensource/free app called fontparade:

http://www.brightpebbles.org/fontparade

using the app, i made pdfs of all the UFCforMacOSX sets. 

i made the silly mistake of installing ALL of the sets, and then had to go through the painfully slow process of uninstalling them cuz it slowed my lappy down so much, with many hangs and tears... ;-)

anyway, that taught me that it's better to SEE and then SELECT the fonts before hand and install only the ones you really like or need.

good to know that people are diggin' it!"
