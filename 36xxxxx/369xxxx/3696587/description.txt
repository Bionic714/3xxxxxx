Hello all...

Since the latest Antrix WoW emu has been released...
I thought i would throw together a quick repack..
This repack is using Antrix rev42 + scripts + maps...
And the database is NOW a Project Silvermoon DB Antirx Port...
all of which is freely available online if you know where to look...

Also i have included a PHP web reg pack... Antrix [RegPage].rar...
Very easy to setup... Just follow the included README.TXT...

Kudos to everyone at the antrix project and all associated groups...
Without all their hard pioneering work.. redesigning.. and dedication...
There would not be a wow emulation scene as diverse as we have today...
