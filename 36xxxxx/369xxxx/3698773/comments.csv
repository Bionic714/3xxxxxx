,Mr. Marbles,2007-06-01T01:44Z,"This program kicks butt.  I spent many hours trying to figure out how to convert my mkv files to a watchable DVD.  I was told many different things by many people but in the end I decided to try this on a whim and presto!  MKV files right to DVD, quality maintained and everything!"
