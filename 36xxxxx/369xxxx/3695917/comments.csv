Both episodes are playable and don't want any external crap.

jamesblond11, what the hell are you saying??? "
,entrecote,2007-05-24T10:44Z,When you extract the .rar archive you get a .zix file  and a document. The .zix file can not be opened through a conventional moveplayer such as vlc or WMP. The document urges you to visit a homepage to download a .zix extraction program and some mediaplayer called 3wplayer.
,jamesblond11,2007-05-24T10:55Z,"look to the filelist, there are no rarÂ´s
no rars >> no zix >> no trojan
