Legendary fight master Yuen Biao (Project A) stars as Peacock, a Buddhist priest endowed with magical skills, who must descend through one of the gates of hell (underneath a Tokyo department store!) and stop the emergence of the horrific Hell King. Battling everything from little gremlins to massive dinosaurs Peacock has to resort to some serious kung fu if he's to stop Armageddon!

The combined talents of Takashige Ichise (The Grudge, Dark Water) Shinji Higuchi (Neon Genesis Evangelion) and Keita Amemiya (Cashan: Robot Hunter) bring to life a blaze of special effects that sear the screen with excitement as action legend Yuen Biao cranks up his breathtaking fight skills like never before.
