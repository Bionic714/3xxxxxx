Now you probably asks yourselves - why?

The answer is simple: Since your computer has its own serial number, it'll be different from user to user, so if dbuster has serial number 12312321123 and then etc oyvindgjerde has 4565345345, you cant use the same enable key for both computers, and the gauge checks the validation too, so no need to upload a RIP ;)"

,Private-Cowboy,2007-06-02T13:09Z,"Jesus, what is wring with you people??? Do you take even 1 single second to look at things???

When the install completed on my Vista Ultimate setup I started the Maddog manager as in admin (with extended rights) and when it popped up it went right away to the register section. There I was given the serial!!! I copied it and pasted it into the keygen and that gave me the key. I copied that and pasted it into the key field of the manager et voila the Maddog was registered.

You don't need and proof of purchase email so something like that. The Maddog manager will give you the serial relevant to your machine. Think of it less as a serial but more of a hardware-id. Every single system has a different one so one from the friendly folks here that provided that great addon won't help you anything. You can't even change the serial in the manager. It only allows you to put in the key that fits to the serial it gives you.

I already took that bay out and man do I love it. The best thing is, that there is no fps drop at all compared to the standard FSX planes. But the system depth is frightning. It took me ages to get the eninges running alone ;-)

One of the greates addon ever! I'd say together with the Level-D 767 (when will that come for FSX???) and the PMDG 747 (right around the corner for FSX!!!) this is the top3 of addon planes. The lack of liveries is a bit sad. Only two north american ones yet."
,Private-Cowboy,2007-06-02T13:11Z,"Just remember to start the manager AND FSX as an admin, otherwise all kind of problems will pop up because the plane will no be properly regged and crashes will occur."

,dbuster,2007-06-03T07:21Z,You can copy then some files (don't know which!) and send them to us! By that way we would all be satisfied!
,Private-Cowboy,2007-06-03T09:35Z,"I don't think that would work. The panel gauges are regged specifically to a system with a serial that refelcts that system. Just copying them over to a different systen that obviously has a differen serial would invalidate them.

It's basically the same as with those Adobe apps. Just copying over a regged Photoshop does shit. It will not work. It has to be activated on the system it is meant to run.

Differnt thing though. I bought the Maddog (those 5min were more fun than I had with every other addon in years) and found that when I ran the manager with admin rights under Vista it popped up a reg window I had to fill out before I could change any settings. Before that, starting the manager normally, I could change settings and the reg page showed my reg date.

It seems though, that without admin rights, the manager is not able/allowed to do the changes needed in order to fully reg the plane. After starting with admin rights, the reg date sticks.

Tried that??? Well anyway, ints onto flying for me..."

,N537JB,2007-06-11T22:31Z,"Okay guys, thanks to CANUCK for making it work (atleast for me). Here's his original post:

Hi guys,
Tried again after work again tonight. And it loaded black with a frozen windshield. I had to remove the registration info completely from all the boxes, then enter in the email. (I used abcdefg@microsoft.com) and a random 6 number order mail. Then I had it start flight simulator from the load manager, and all worked well.


Works in FS9 aswell :)"
,jpascuas,2007-06-12T21:30Z,"Finally I made it to work! It seems that the Maddog saved in the windows registry the registration information from the v1.0 so when I installed v2.1 it detected a registration data mismatch, blocking so the gauges after a while...

What I did is:

1st: uninstalled present Maddog from windows
2nd: deleted by hand all ""maddog"" entries in the windows registry and the folders of  the Maddog under the MSFS folder, restart the PC and then install
3rd: restart windows and follow the instructions explained by N537JB in the post above

This way I've been flying this bird for 10 minutes with no gauges block. I'll make an entire flight this night to try it properly.

Cheers."
