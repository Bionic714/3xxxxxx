I have no problems burning the dvd, but i cant get it work with swapmagic. Anyone know about a new security system so the copy wont work with swapmagic 3.6?"
,alexlarsson,2007-06-20T08:16Z,"but how do you change to a PS2 format??
i have burnt it down on a dvd-rw but it won't play it!!!"
,Reggeaton,2007-07-30T13:11Z,"blir det samma grafik som orginalet?

Same grafik or a bit worst?"
,Reggeaton,2007-07-30T13:12Z,you have to burn the iso files and so on......
,starphish17th,2007-07-31T04:48Z,Swap magic has problems with many ISO's that fill up the whole dvd. The orginal game was probably shrunk from a dvd 9 to fit to dvd 5. These ISO's work for modded ps2 but usually not with swap magic. Mabye you can rebuild it but to me that's a huge mess I avoid for now. DVDRW doesn't work for ps2. You have to use DVDR.
