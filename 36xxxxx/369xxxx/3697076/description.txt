Hi.

Windows xp pro sp2 incl drivers, software and updates (may2007).

This release has been made with the average computer user in mind. There are plenty of images that contain gigs of applications that just increase download time and that most people don't really want.
This is a nice and sicure release of xp that will find drivers for neally anything due to the driver intergration.
It comes with applications that you will actually use like anty virus, anty spyware and compression utillities.

This release consists of:

Windows xp pro, fully unattended install - with vlk that passed wga in late march
Selection of intergreated drivers - (Chipset, graphics, lan, sound, sata and wlan) (aka dp chipset, dp graphics b, dp sound a/b, dp mass storage, dp lan and dp wlan)
All post sp2 updates intergreated as of 13th may
Unattended install of some handy programs - (Avast, spybot, ccleaner, dtemp, winrar and sygate personal firewall pro); winrar and sygate are automaticly cracked.

Notes:

The following features of xp have been removed:

Every language except for english.
Updating function - means that you can't update from an older os, clean installs only.
directories - support, docs, valueadd, all of which do not make any difference to the finel install.

All the applications are freeware except for winrar and sygate, which have been automaticly cracked.
You will need to register avast your self, there is really no point in providing a key as they are free anyway.
Ccleaner comes with the yahoo toolbar, because ccleaner installs unattendidly there is no way of telling it not to install it. Feel free to uninstall from add and remove.

This is my first torrent, so just say if i'm doing anything wrong.

Thanks.
