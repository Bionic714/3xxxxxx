,kevin1980,2007-05-25T17:43Z,hi i have vista can i change vista to xp on my computer if so how do i do it ??? me a complete noob lol
,ddelta,2007-05-25T17:52Z,You'll have to change the boot options to boot up on CD. Have the cd in and it should take care of the rest. Make sure you select clean install. Usually you hit F2 or del button during boot up. If you don't know what you're doing only change the boot options. After you're done the install change it back to your master harddrive
,mu57i11,2007-05-25T18:48Z,"Ok, bit about the seeding situation:
Basicly, i've got 2 comps seeding this torrent, one is on 256 up and another has 512. Thats 2 seeders and 21 leachers atm, so i really need people to seed this for a bit once its done; tbh i didn't really expect to have that many leachers.

To kev, just do what delter said, but i'll go into a bit more detail:

Put the disk in and restart your computer.
The next bit vairies depending on the make of your computer, but your best bet is probably to keep on pressing f12 untill you get a thingy about booting from cd, once its booting, stop pressing it lol.
All you'll have to do then is select the partition that you want to install xp on and format it, you do this by deleeting the vista partition and then installing it on unpartitioned space. Once you've done that, have a shower come back and you should be just in time to here the xp startup sound.
To avoid any miss understandings, i would advise everyone to read the readme.txt included with the dl; it covers things like what the administrator password is and what happens if you try and install with 256mb of ram.

Chears!"

,mu57i11,2007-05-27T02:15Z,"Ok, a seader is someone that has the complete file.
So when i first released this torrent, i had 2 computers seading it and they were the only ones on the tracker that had the complete file. After a couple of minutes, some leachers came along and started taking the file from me.
Once a leacher has finished taking the file from me, they will show up as a seader and will start to give back what they have taken; hence people are always asking people to sead things!
I'll try and sead this on and off sunday and maybe monday; i've only put about 4.5 gigs into this, but its a bit hard seading on 256 up when other people have to use it; which is why at first i just did the seading for this on someone elses network."
,samtheman11,2007-05-27T02:19Z,"@xtrra - WOW..... lemme guess. You're in middle school and some kid told you that could get all the shit you wanted for free right? Nothing personal - I JUST HATE NOOBS! I just get pissed off at people asking such stupid questions. But a very long time ago I was a noob too - so I'll help u out: A seeder is is an uploader and a leecher is a downloader. In case you dont know what an uploader is its a guy that provides you with the files and a downloader is you - just remember to  seed after you finish downloading. That just means leaving your bittorrent client running after you download - after all, if everybody just downloaded and didnt upload how would anybody get what they're after? I'm working on an ""introduction to the world of piracy"" package that'll explain all the details of what you need to do and how to do it - It'll be put on as many websites that'll let me post it when its done - which should be in about a month ;)"

,SioxerNic,2007-06-07T12:19Z,I'll seed this when i am done . :) I only have 512 but i rarely use 100 kb/s of my connection :)
,mu57i11,2007-08-01T01:26Z,"Sadly, this key does not pass wga anymore.
I have uploaded a xp key changer that will let it validate, you can find it at:

,gratefulstoner,2007-08-27T07:41Z,"First off, thank you mu57i11 and anyone seeding 
for this. I am currently downloading at a good speed, so I'm very happy, and I really needed
an authentic version, saved my laptop =)

Now, once I download this, I'm going to reformat the drive so is there a way to seed without downloading the file again?"
,gratefulstoner,2007-08-28T00:00Z,"so all we have to do is burn the ISO file on a CD, put it in the computer and then boot it ?
my computer will not detect it, even after pressing F12 and booting from CD, it wont detect it so it loads from the hard drive.

any idea what could be goin wrong? 
much thanks"
,mu57i11,2007-08-31T20:46Z,"Yeah this should work on the provision that:
1: You used a cd burning program to burn the cd and not the xp one - you can't just copy / paste the .iso onto the dsik.
2: your bios should be set to boot from your cd drive before your harddrive, although I have seen bioses that have booted from cd's if you keep on pressing f12.
Changing this will vairy depending on the make / model of your bios, but as a guide you want to keep on pressing f2 or deleet at the START of bootup, like when you first turn it on. This should give some options, you will be able to change your boot sequence there.
hth."
,tancients,2007-09-02T07:03Z,"Ah...just noticed the language limitation. ><

Oh well, back to looking for a raw XP Pro disc without being modified. ><

Looked good otherwise."
,tancients,2007-09-02T07:10Z,I don't suppose you'd know where I could get just a vanilla windows xp pro cd rip from?  You seem to be one of the few people who pays attention to their file and has enough real care into it.
,tru2037z,2007-09-13T00:52Z,"uhh not to waste anybodies time any more but isn't the comment area for comments on the file like GOOD, THANK YOU or BAD, VIRUS and not a ""how to"" area? sorry noobs but google your question... its been answered a billion times out there. "
,mu57i11,2007-09-15T03:20Z,"comment 24 - I'd rather get feedback about the release yes, but if i dont give tech support i'll get a shit rep, that just seems to be how it is.
Tancient: Sorry i took the languages out.
If you download it then bare with me, this time next week i'll be releasing something for people like you that will take any english only xp and make it multylanguage."
,mu57i11,2007-09-16T21:55Z,"New rel coming soon - including more up to date version of this (+ multy lang), my xp untuched and probably dsl or puppy linux.
All in a multyboot cd - depends when I can torrent stuff though."
,mu57i11,2007-09-22T02:04Z,"Tancients and everyone else:
You can now easerly add multi language support to any version of xp by downloading my latist release which can be found at
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3814780/Convert_english_xp_to_multi_lang_-_mu57i11
Hope you find it usefull."
,Alup,2008-03-04T03:34Z,"edition is how you spell it not addition
unless you ment to say addition and not edition in that case then i downloaded the wrong torrent"
,flipper17,2008-09-11T22:37Z,"looks pretty good i just need to know if the network drivers come with it too and is there a key?

please SEED"
