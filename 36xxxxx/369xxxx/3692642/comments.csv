,MikeDecipher,2009-01-29T02:40Z,I heard the reputation of this book. If I'm able to get -- then will seed to 2000%. I hope that brings life to this torrent.

Thanks"
,halofubar,2009-09-15T07:02Z,"This PDF is incomplete. It's missing pages, such as 170 and 171. It's the same incomplete torrent found all over the internet.

BTW it *is* an interesting read. I'm neither a believer nor a skeptic, but a very open-minded realist, and some of this makes a lot more sense than the goofy-as-hell religions we're taught as kids.

It even seems Buddhism may be the path to realizing the evolution of the soul/spirit as put forth by this book and by others."
,halofubar,2009-09-15T07:04Z,"(Theravada Buddhism that is, the original teachings of the Buddha before China, Japan and Tibet for instance ""melded"" it with their own religions and customs/traditions. The original Buddhism is an entirely scientific method without any faith/beliefs or mysticism bullshit.)"
