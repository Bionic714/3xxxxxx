,rikoothekoop,2009-10-09T23:14Z,"beware when downloading this, you cannot uninstall the app it I even tried an Your Uninstaller! 2008 but it was still there! I had to delete all the files from my hard disk and then scan it with trojan remover to get rid of any leftovers.

It does work but you have to copy the link individually(I prefer Jdownloader)"
,macsabina,2009-11-07T23:50Z,"i did what the readme file says and all my file are corrupted, any advice???


alguien que me explique porke todo los file estan corruptos, instale el programa como dice el  archivo de leer."
,tasseli,2010-01-23T20:34Z,"It doesn't actually work for shit.
What it does is install alright and start downloading the looks of files you ask, but they're corrupted and if you view them with notepad for example you can see it's just downloaded code from RS or some shit. Has nothing to do with what it says.

Also impossible to uninstall, malware.
Stop sharing."

follow the readme..

THANX!"
