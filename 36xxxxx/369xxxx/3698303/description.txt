The acknex engine
_________________

The engine is the core of the development system - it generates the 3D image and controls the behavior of the virtual world. GameStudio's A6 virtual reality engine was developed in 2003. Due to its combined BSP-Tree and terrain renderer, it handles indoor and outdoor sceneries equally well. Its lighting engine supports static and dynamic shadows cast from moving light sources. The threefold culling algorithm renders huge worlds extremely fast even on old hardware. Programmers can use plugins for adding new effects and features.

You can use this acknex engine (WHICH IS IN-BUILT, you can find it in Bin Folder of installation dir.) to code in C++ (Microsoft VC++ or Borland C++ or whatever you like) instead of C-Script. But that is for very advanced users, for beginners C-Script is recommended.

THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL QUALITY ENGINE.. so if you can master the language, you will be able to make professional quality games!
