Plot:	Seventh-degree black belt, former chief hand-to-hand combat instructor in the Korean Army's "Tiger Division", and film star Hwang Jang Lee demonstrates here every aspect of almost every kicking technique in existence.

Overview:	Seventh-degree black belt Korean Tae Kwon Do master Hwang Jang Lee has been accepted by leaders in the World Tae Kwon Do Federation as the one man whose kicking ability is without equal anywhere on the globe. Hwang, a former chief hand-to-hand combat instructor in the Korean Army's fierce "Tiger Division" and well-known kung fu film actor ("Drunken Master"), demonstrates here, in detail, every aspect of almost every leg weaponry, beginning with eight elementary techniques which, when multiplied by the spinning motion of the body, form the sixteen basic kicks. Each of these fundamental moves are furthermore divided into forward and rear leg attacks, advancing and retreating motions, and then expanded within the four primary footwork patterns: stepping, sliding, skipping, and jumping.
