,sparklysparks,2008-06-27T01:25Z,Any other comments about this torrent that are objective enough? 'cause the one from kuino isn't telling much...
,NilsNL,2008-11-23T00:15Z,"Well I wouldn't say 'mischief'. It's just not tagged at all. Songtitles_are_tagged_like_this and only the 'title' field is tagged. 

Plus, the torrent contains 16 songs while Sketches should contain 22 or 23 depending on the release.

Music is ok though."
,ikaro,2008-12-11T12:06Z,"its ripped from the double CD, so all tracks should be there.
i don't remember which app i used to rip, but apparently the settings weren't the best.
sorry about that."
,cerozero1,2009-05-20T09:54Z,"All the tracks are in order of track #.... Just click the blue number 16 at the top of this page next to files and you get a list of the track names in the order of track#...ppl shouldn't be so lazy-add the tags yourself! ikaro did basically everything for you already. The torrent is fine, virus free, and greatly appreciated. Keep it up ikaro."
