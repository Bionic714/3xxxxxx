Utility to extract the contents of ZIX archives.

Use this instead of installing the spyware-infested WinZix software.

This release contains a bugfix. The previous version (0.0.5) got confused if the ZIX archive contained unrecognized metainformation, such as folder structure information.
This should work okay now.

If you come across anything UnZixWin can\'t handle, then use the e-mail address in the contact_info.txt file to let me know. I\'ll take a look.

<strong>Warning!</strong> Don\'t extract anything executable from a ZIX archive. It is highly likely to contain a virus or a trojan.

Also, don\'t be tricked into installing any \'codec patch\' or any special player software to play the AVI inside. This is a trick to get you to compromise your system, much like WinZix does.
