,zarooch,2007-05-24T09:48Z,"alright people! for those who are having problem with msvcrt.dll file, I figured out a solution to that problem, either you can google it yourself or... 

look here for a difficult way to solve the problem

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324762

or do it the easy way, as:
copy msvcrt.dll from C:\Windows\System32\

and paste it [Drive_Where_You_Installed_Sierra]:\Sierra\

and that's it! happy drawing :)"
,zarooch,2007-05-24T09:51Z,"********** IMPORTANT CORRECTION **********

,dragon433,2007-05-24T13:04Z,"thanks mate works a treat 
i was wondering how i can put the 3 iso images to 1 dvd and boot from there any ideas"
,zarooch,2007-05-24T17:12Z,"well... you can use Nero and select its option to not to finalize disc after burning ISO image, then burn cd1.iso cd2.iso and finally cd3.iso (I haven't tried it, but it should work). Otherwise just burn cd1.iso cd2.iso and cd3.iso on the dvd (Data DVD) and use either Nero ImageDrive to mount the image or any of your preferred tool, hope this helps."

,Felicienne,2008-02-20T06:34Z,"Thank you so much Chris.
In return a valuable tip:
If after updatind msvcrt.dll your program works a while and then passes out, oleaut32.dll also needs updating. You might also consider retiring all the grand papa dlls if your program faints.
Cheers"
