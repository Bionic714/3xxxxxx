Can anyone comfirm that?"
,noz,2007-05-21T16:06Z,Well i can confirm that Trauma Center didnt work on my pal console. Not even after i region patched it.
,glericus,2007-05-21T23:09Z,tnx m8. did you try golf aswell?
,noz,2007-05-22T16:54Z,nope didnt try the golf game. I took trauma center down long time ago from another torrent site. If i where you i could trust that list you linked to...if it say it wont work then it most likely wont.
,noz,2007-05-22T16:55Z,could=would
