,god_is_great,2010-10-20T07:56Z,"Hey Guys,

Needed this software badly so thanks yog512. 
People using Windows 7 attention.

I am using windows 7 64 bit. So after you download it and open the folder, you see the file MDAC_TYP. Run this file and save the installation whereever you want. Now when you try to open the Kundli 5.0 software it gives an error something like   "" DBLIST32.OCX file missing ....""

Now if you see your download you would see a folder named dblist in it. It would have 4 files with one of them matching the above name. So what you do is that you copy them and paste them in the folder where you have the installation of Kundli. 

You do not copy the whole folder but only the 4 files in the folder dblist. Make sure that the files are at the same place as where there are other files as swastik, om, Plain etc..

now that you have done that try opening the Kundli software. But Alas it shows the same message/error again.

Now here is the solution. After doing all this i.e. copying the 4 files, you need to permanently delete the file ""unins000"" in your installation folder. There are 2 of them. Delete the one with the smaller size around 8 kb. The file to be deleted is a DAT file. 

After this you are almost done. Now go back to your download folder and run the file named MDAC_TYP again and install the software in the same place as the first one.

That's it. The software works like a charm. When  you open the Kundli 5.0 folder you would see 2 new files named unins001 each. You are done and Enjoy the software."
,way2heaven,2011-06-15T23:21Z,"@god_is_great : thanks friend for your excellent & precise tutorial to run this program.Its working fine.
One more thing i would like to add here that if it gives runtime overflow error to anyone then please install any registry cleaner software.Then fix registry issues by running it, restart your system 7 you are done now. I did the same,  So happy matchmaking guys !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,way2heaven,2011-06-15T23:23Z,@yog512 : thanks buddy for this wonderful software. I will be seeding it for a long time now :)
,tpbadrien,2011-08-06T15:36Z,"If you get the DBLIST32.OCX error on windows 7 follow these steps
1. Goto Start->All Programs->Accessories and right click on command prompt icon and click on ""Run as Administrator""
2. Goto the folder where you have downloaded the torrent using the cd command eg. 
cd ""e:\Downloads\Kundli 5 pro full installation\dblist""
3. Type the following command 
regsvr32 DBLIST32.OCX
Thats it. You should now be able to run kundli without any issues."
