Concived by Rik Mayall and Ben Elton as a natural successor to The Young Ones,
Filthy, Rich & Catflap is a difficult series to describe.
The words sublime and ridicolous do spring to mind, but the word that probably
sums it up best is: FUNNY!

Filthy, Rich & Catflap is a tale of Richie Rich, talentless and unheard of 
television personality along with Ralph Filthy, his useless, sponging agent 
and Eddie Catflap, his alcoholic minder, who are both involved in helping 
(hindering)Richie┬┤s quest for TV fame and glory.

Unforunately, Filthy never gets him work, and his minder Eddie is more than
willing to administer extreme physical violemce should any be visited upon his
boss. So, probably not the most stable basis from witch yo launch a career in
television.

Filthy, Rich & Catflap┬┤s lagacy lasted for years however, in the form of the 
brilliantly funnt, if just a little more vilolent, Bottom.



Starring:

Nigel Planner as Ralph Filthy
Rik Mayall as Richie Rich
Adrian Edmondson as Eddie Catflap



Hope you enjoy it!



Cheers!
