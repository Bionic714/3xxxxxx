,adamkatt,2007-05-23T16:12Z,LOL still no fucking seeds..
,GenPollux,2007-05-24T08:42Z,"Hey man, I'm trying here...  Shitty computers lead to shitty uploads, leading to shitty seeding abilities.  "
,adamkatt,2007-05-25T01:59Z,Well i have shared at least 4 times the amount dloaded so far..
,GenPollux,2007-05-25T06:30Z,Congrats to you.  Go to your local bakery and pick yourself up a cookie.
,adamkatt,2007-05-25T20:40Z,sry for being a dick before just impatient.. ill keep seeding this for a while anyways
,GenPollux,2007-05-26T00:51Z,"I try to seed as much as possible, but I only get about 8 hours at home to do anything, and most of that is sleep.  I usually just leave my computer running seeding, but when I wake up it has mysteriously turned itself off, so I don't know how long it was on, etc."
,SneakySis,2007-06-12T14:03Z,"Another example of an older science fiction ""cult movie"" being chopped and hacked to bits to allow enough time for inane commercials.  About 1/3 of the original movie is missing (on the cutting room floor no doubt).  Audio and video is not bad, but if you are looking for the total movie, this ain't it ... "
,GenPollux,2007-07-19T02:30Z,"Sneaky, I don't think you understand the point of the MST3K series.
"
,Multo_Destructo,2008-04-26T01:15Z,No he clearly missed the point more than Michael Bay when he did Pearl Harbor
,mrchrisb,2010-06-22T19:30Z,No seeds again...I've been trying to dl for a full day :(
,canoli99,2011-06-01T23:51Z,"5 years later and this torrent is still active - yay! Glad I caught up with it...

Imagine d/l this and being pissed off because there are these robot-looking things and some guy talking during the movie! Clearly for MST3K fans only! Enjoy - and thanks for seeding!!!"
,Primon9,2012-04-12T17:29Z,"SneakySis You've written that same comment for multiple uploads of MST3K. I can't help but think you're simply a fucking idiot. Of course this isn't the real movie, who the fuck would want to watch This Island Earth? This is a comedy show involving Joel (Or mitchell/mike in later seasons) and his two robot pals, Crow and Tom Serv-O, who are exiled in space, forced to watch horrible movies forever. It's not about honoring older, B-rated movies, it's about laughing at their expense. Get a life, and stop pestering the MST3K fans, or we'll exile you into space and force you to watch MST3K forever.
