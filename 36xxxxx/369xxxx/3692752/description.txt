Info2MIS is free. It's the app's that I used to create 
the .MIS. It can also extract information from imdb.com
(with picture), tv.com, amazon.com(with picture), 
dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a few seconds with an episode on tv.com(find page)
and only 2 clicks for a movie from imdb.com(with picture)
