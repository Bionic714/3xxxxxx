,xghoulx,2007-05-24T11:34Z,why is this only 350mb for a 2 hour show?
,nightsongz2,2007-05-24T11:36Z,It's the second part...but it's still episode 23...the first part was episode 22 which is right here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3695775/Lost.S03E22.HDTV.XViD-Caph
,nightsongz2,2007-05-24T11:38Z,"So basically, episode 22 and episode 23 were shown back to back and it was called a 2 hour season finale."
,nightsongz2,2007-05-24T11:46Z,"Grava, I don't know what program you're using but in my utorrent 1.6.1, it's showing a little over 700 seeders."
,made-of-technetium,2007-05-24T12:38Z,Please keep this seeded for at least a good few days as because of the lies & total incompetence of Orange.co.uk I am currently stuck with a dialup connection.
,georgvou,2007-05-24T13:02Z,thanks...!
,nightsongz2,2007-05-24T13:25Z,Mania...you're obviously a retard & have no clue.
,nightsongz2,2007-05-24T13:30Z,"Episode 22 and 23 are 2 totally different episodes that were shown back to back last night (May 23). I'm sure others will post and back me up. Download episode 22 & 23...watch them and you'll see. Or look here dumbass http://www.tv.com/lost/show/24313/episode_listings.html?season=3&tag=season_dropdown;dropdown;2 and it says Episode 322 ""Throught The Looking Glass (1) & Episode 323 ""Throught The Looking Glass (2). Next time be sure you know what you are talking about before running your mouth, moron."
