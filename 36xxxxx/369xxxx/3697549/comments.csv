it is so much crap, it is more fun to cut your own head of with a needle than watching this shit
I think that the people that made this movie should be excecuted for crimes against humanity
DO NOT DOWNLOAD"

Do not DL this mutilated & crushed into 4gb rip when there is a perfectly good unmolested DVD9 full rip right here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3505424/"
,maxgrande,2009-03-04T02:35Z,"Wow.  Whence the harsh commentary by mike18xx and hobbitinn?  What did Esminteo do to deserve such treatment?  

I have not yet seen this film, but it comes highly recommended by my friends and by ALL of the IMDb commentators.  Plus, Esminteo has made the extra effort of giving us the VOBs instead of just the .AVI.

Bottom line, if you don't like what's on offer, go elsewhere.  But don't denigrate someone who's providing a free and respectable service to our community.

Thanks, Esminteo.  I look forward to enjoying this film and I appreciate the work you've done to make it available.

Regards, M."

Which seem to be true, because when you compare this upload to the link you provided, the main movie of this upload is only 200mb smaller (probably removed menus).

I will download one .vob-file from each upload, that way I can decide for sure if anyone is better that the other."
