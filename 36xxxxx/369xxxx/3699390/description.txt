SYNOPSIS: Archeology professor Robert Burns (Seagal) is on location leading an
important dig in the ancient ruins on the Far Eastern China border.
He accidentally discovers that the Chinese Mafia, the Tong, is using his newly discovered ancient Chinese artifacts to smuggle narcotics across the border. Trying to escape, his loyal assistant is killed and he is framed with the evidence at the Chinese border by the military and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and sent to prison. Once eventually released, Burns would rather enjoy his freedom back in the U.S. and keep his past behind him, but The Tong catches up to him and threatens not only his life but that of his wife. Vowing to avenge the lives of his loved ones, Burns hunts down and pursues each of The Tong members.
