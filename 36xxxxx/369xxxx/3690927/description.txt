CD Catalog Expert is nice program created to help you organize and maintain a catalog of your computer media collection, including CDROMs, harddrives, audio CDs, MP3s, removable disks... 

Allows you to convert catalog files into TXT/HTM. So you can share your catalogs with your friends who don't have this software. 

CD Catalog Expert uses Windows Shell technology. In other words, when you rightclick on your CDROM icon, there is a "Add to Catalogs" menu command, just like Winzip. 

Click the command and you can create your catalogs by a shortcut even the CD Catalog Expert isn't running! This is useful if you want to keep track of a vast CD collection.
