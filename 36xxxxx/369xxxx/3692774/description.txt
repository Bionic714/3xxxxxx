access to a 6 year to your movies(horror, action, pr0n).

It's a front end/player. but If you don't like the

Info2MIS is free. It's the app's that I used to create 
the .MIS. It can also extract information from imdb.com
(with picture), tv.com, amazon.com(with picture), 
dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a few seconds with an episode on tv.com(find page)
and only 2 clicks for a movie from imdb.com(with picture)

To give you an ideal of how a .MIS will be used with 
MIS Info Video (for those new to the .MIS)
