Fire_Emblem - Working (patch + WiiKey)
Naruto_Shippuuden - Not playable, ok in menu
One_Piece_Unlimited_Adventure - Not working
Pokemon_Battle_Revolution - Not playable, ok in menu (Update to firmware 2.2E before testing)
SD_Gundam_Scad_Hammers - Not working

This is only what others have reported, I will test ""One Piece Unlimited Adventure"" and ""Pokemon"" when I get home. teser verified in the pack 11 torrent comments that this info is still valid. An upgrade to the WiiKey firmware could fix it."
