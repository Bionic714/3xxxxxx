,Raul_Anakin,2007-05-31T22:56Z,"Get the program called WinRAR. Install it. Then, double-click one of the rar-files and you'll get one big .iso-file. Burn it in a program like Nero. Done."
,junkitman2002,2007-06-13T18:13Z,"Had some problems with the iso, needed to re-save it with magiciso to get it to play in vlc.  seems to work fine now."

,Boonaki,2007-06-23T18:51Z,"I was wondering why my torrents were only downloading
at 30-40k a sec when they had 2000+ seeds, after a few
hours of research and playing with peer guardian 2, I
found 100's of connections per seconds comming from
two sources. media defender and some other (forget).

I added this to my firewall ACL.

Deny All Protocol ANY 216.73.85.0-216.73.88.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 209.62.175.0-209.62.177.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 38.99.252.0-38.99.253.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 64.93.88.0-64.93.93.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 38.102.233.0-38.102.233.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 64.93.0.0-64.93.255.255 ANY Any

Boom, 400k a sec downloads once again.

As soon as I started peer guardian I noticed the
download speed going up, but it topped out when I
added those to the ACL. 

Beware mediadefender.com"
,Qeenix,2007-06-24T08:57Z,Seed ppl!
,CapnJazzPony,2007-07-25T07:11Z,"the download is fine, but this is pretty softcore stuff.  its a series of 8 scenes of chrissy moran stripping for about 6 minutes each scene.  thanks for the upload though!"
,Seferine,2007-07-25T21:54Z,Thanx for the extra info!
,Raul_Anakin,2007-07-28T18:36Z,"Yeah, thanks for repeating what I wrote myself when uploading this torrent.

,brownhornet1972,2007-10-22T18:23Z,I'm new to this game.  Can someone tell me how to seed as I'd really like to help the next dude.  thanx
,Raul_Anakin,2007-11-21T19:57Z,"brownhornet: As long as you dont remove the torrent after downloading something, you are seeding. The moment you remove it, you stop seeding. It is that easy. :)"
,Flicker,2007-12-16T20:42Z,"Thanks for this great up Raul_Anakin,all works fine . "
,hiroprotagonist2005,2007-12-23T19:48Z,"im using zipreader and its not extracting the file, im trying to extract the 1st one and its not finishing, when i close it it leaves me a roxio file, what gives?`"
