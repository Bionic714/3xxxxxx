This is a script to easily create a burnable and bootable full ISO-CD/DVD Image for OpenBSD, any Version (current is 4.1), any architecture. Runs on OSX, comes with binaries of wget and mkisofs to help you get going. Included is also a A4-PDF CheatSheet for installation and setup. OpenBSD is the most secure Unix operating systems and is perfectly suited to run as a web or email-server. Also runs Ruby on Rails :P ( http://openbsd.org )
