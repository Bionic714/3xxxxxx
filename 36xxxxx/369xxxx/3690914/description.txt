Do you find Randy intolerable? Is Paula's irreverently effusive praise draining? Does Simon's "realism" just annoy you? Does the "fighting" between Ryan/Simon, Paula/Simon, everyone/Simon make you yearn for even the worst singer to drown them out?

Well yearn no more!

Enter American Idol - Just the Music!

This series will follow the episodes of American Idol, eliminating the CGI intros, the "last night on...", the "this is how so-and-so came to Hollywood, Listen to the inspirational music in the background!", and, of course, the judging. All that will be left is the singing itself - for better or worse!
