I know a lot of these can easily be found, but I had some trouble finding the Ripit4me installer, luckily I had it backed up on another computer.

I hope this is useful to some out there.  If anything burn this to a CD and give it to a friend.


Note: for those that like portable applications I have included also the single exe for those that don\\\'t want the installer.  

     Also, most of these can be installed/used under Linux via the wine package.
