You are Sir Dan, a recently reincarnated knight who has lost all that unsightly flesh i.e., you're a skeleton and you must battle the evil sorcerer Zarok and his battalions of undead monsters. To combat these baddies, you have your trusty sword, an axe, and a bow that shoots flaming arrows at the ready. But this game is more than just hack-and-slash action; each level has unique puzzles that differ from stage to stage, giving a nice degree of variety to the title. Also, once a certain number of enemies are dispatched, you can gather up a chalice that gives you access to the Hall of Heroes, a place where heroic ghosts distribute special weapons or items with each visit. Of course, these visits are usually accompanied by a verbal chastising at your unworthy status as the champion of Gallowmere. And while this game has plenty of action, it is also filled with bright and colorful graphics, and has a light feel that will appeal to younger gamers.
