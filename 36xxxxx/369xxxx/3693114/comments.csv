These comments totally inspired by nightsongz2's oh so quality point of view expressed in various aXXo torrents."
,nightsongz2,2007-05-24T00:45Z,Candp tried to hit on my 14 yr old daughter and is upset that I informed authorities.
,nightsongz2,2007-05-24T00:50Z,ALso he hasn't even downloaded this file and is sticking up for a comment I made on the quality of an axxo release (they're always small resolutions on his rips). Over 600 people have downloaded this and know it is PERFECT quality! lol Axxo's little followers are psycho and not too bright...they always go for his tiny resolution rips when there are ALWAYS better higher quality rips out a week before his...they're just too lazy to search.
