A virus means your computer is now infected with a program that uses it as a bot, steals your credit card #, steals your user accounts for websites, uses you as a proxy, etc.

Viruses very VERY rarely are about sabotage. KILLA-CONNI, format your computer, and if you used a credit card to buy something online after running the keygen, then call your CC and say its been compromised and get new ones."
