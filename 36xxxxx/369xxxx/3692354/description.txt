Death Piggy are generally referred to as GWAR before the costumes. Comprising of several members of GWAR, they merged with another local band, The Slave Pit. They formed in 1982 and were a small-time punk band in the Richmond, Virginia.

They flourished briefly and were then fully absorbed by GWAR in 1985/1986. They put out a few '45s (some limited to 301 copies) and had a small yet loyal following. They were also known to have played alongside the Butthole Surfers and the Dead Kennedys in their earlier years.


Included in this torrent is the Death Piggy track "Boner" + a music video of the same song (Hentai style), I found this video on the net a while ago and I don't know who created it. The audio track was downloaded with WinMX a looong time ago.


I don't like to beg, but if anybody have albums by Death Piggy or X-Cops, could you please consider uploading them to a torrent site like Demonoid or TPB? I have looked for music by those two bands for a looong time now.
