,stinkydj,2008-02-02T15:13Z,"Deathmule,
Did you get the 3 hour special S03E22?

-- I would love to see the ""special edition"" re-broadcast of season 3's cliff hanger of ""Through The Looking Glass"". It would be interesting to see the cheesy scrolling tidbits of pop-up video style info, but where can you find it? I haven't seen the torrent posted anywhere on the Bay, and not even on EZ-TV, which is usually such a godsend for TV eps...

Any clues?"
,stevieb,2008-02-25T01:28Z,Nice 1 dood :D
