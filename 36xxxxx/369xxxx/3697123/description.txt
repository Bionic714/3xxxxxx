We all hate RealPlayer, but sometimes there is a file you want to see/watch that
is only available in RealPlayer format. This is the BBC Ad-Free version of the 
application for Mac OS X, that lets you play RealMedia without all the extra 
worthless add-ons and advertising. Simply Unzip the file and copy it to your
Applications folder. Enjoy!!
