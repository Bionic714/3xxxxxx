Thanks for the feedback"

Im waiting until my ratio gets to .500 before I upload the next disc. For bandwidth reasons.
As it is, Im only uploading at 40kB/s steady, so just be patient I figure Ill get to .5 by noon or so tomorrow (today) may 22"

From 1 to 15 seeders in about 20 mins.
Now all I need is for some people to finish downloading the second DVD."
