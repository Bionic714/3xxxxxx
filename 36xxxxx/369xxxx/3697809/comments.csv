,boriszorg,2007-05-27T15:00Z,"Thanks for the correction. It's sure, my english is
not perfect, but to draw means ""dessiner"" ?   :-)"
,dingbatty,2007-05-28T22:49Z,"Yes.  ""Dessiner"" is the same as ""to draw.""  English defies logic, often.  A person who bakes bread is called a ""baker,"" and a person who runs is called a ""runner,"" yet a person who draws is called a ""penciller"" (un crayon) an ""artist"" or an ""illustrator"", but never a ""draw-er.""  ;-)  I can see how the inconsistency would be confusing."
