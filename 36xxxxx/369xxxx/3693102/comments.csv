,koleny,2007-10-30T21:59Z,The reason there are no movies is because the movies are messed up... if you enter the movies folder all .bik files are 1kb :P so there's your answer why there are no cinematics ingame

,DCPTKON,2008-01-31T18:48Z,"I didn't understand what cloonwars said until I played it, It works but the framerate is all weird, its moving in fast forward, I even set it to max graphic capability to try and slow it down, didn't work. Yet Skullptura's PK Overdose works fine.  o.O"
,DCPTKON,2008-01-31T19:06Z,"Yaa I fixed :D
If you have a Dual Core AMD processer, just turn one off for Painkiller

this is how I fixed the problem:
after starting, Windows key[or Alt-Tab] out [but don't close] goto Windows Task Manager [Ctrl-Alt-Del], to the Processes tab, find ""Painkiller.exe"" right-click. Goto ""Set Affinity..."" and uncheck either CPU 0 or CPU 1 [ just one of them ] then go back in and it should be fine, it was for me. "

,dirkzen,2008-05-25T16:59Z,"Gahh... downloaded fast, but got some DirectX 9 rendering problem...   Updated it to 9.0c an all that, but...  I think it might just be a  ""your graphics card sucks ass""   type of problem.   >.<   Anyone know anything about it?"
,digituch,2008-05-26T17:52Z,I am only able to play single-player; multi-play does not work--just gives errors like 'invalid cd-key' and such! Is there something I am doing wrong to enable multi-player? All of the game-downloads I'm trying are single-play only. I've also tried several keys from a key-generator--with no luck. Anyone know? (maybe I should just PURCHASE the game? lol ;-)
,wildcat.nl,2008-05-31T12:39Z,"digituch, it's normal for downloaded games. When you buy a game you get an unique serial. But you can only play with 1 serial online. So if you buy the game you get an unique serial you can play online with but if you download a game more then thousand people have that serial and you must be very lucky if you can play online then! :P"

,ojackson,2009-03-26T16:09Z,"@ those having problems with that direct x error, you probably have a graphic card that dont have a TnL support, get a little prog called ""3d Analyze"" and tick ""emulate HW TnL caps"". Worked for me as well as the game did as well as all dopeman releases :)"
,Shiny-15,2009-04-05T02:31Z,"I'm not sure what it is, maybe it's just my PC, but every single fucking Dopeman release doesn't work. With the exception of Indigo Prophecy and Sniper Elite.

But I'm using WinRAR 3.80 Professional and everything is corrupted, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Any help would be much appreciated!"
