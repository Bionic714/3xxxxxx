,AkronSire,2007-05-22T01:12Z,You should put up the torrent in the folder where you have all books. That will solve one problem by listing all available books and people can choose which books to download and which ones to don't. :)

I'm new at this so maybe it's me, but I haven't had any problems with other torrents on other sites..."
