Requested by several folks at UK Nova, but as an American production it is ineligible for uploading there, hence the upload here at Demonoid.

For comparison of the surviving partial episode of Out Of The Unknown recently uploaded at UKN featuring their version of The Little Black Bag. Here is how Rod Serling & company handled the same classic golden-age sci-fi story about 5 years later.  I've chosen to use the seldom seen original hour-long episode as broadcast in 1971 with three individual stories rather than the more commonly re-run half-hour episode of just The Little Black Bag, as the shorter re-run version cuts out about 5 minutes worth of the original story that is still all there in this version.  Consider the two additional stories a bonus.

First torrent I've ever uploaded anywhere, so I hope it all works OK...
