Fast paced go-kart racing has come to the PlayStation with STREET RACER. You can race with or against eight different drivers, each with unique vehicles and weapons. For example, Frank Instein has a Big Monster Mash punch to force the other drivers off of the road, and Surf Sister uses beach balls as weapons. You must navigate through 24 tracks and earn points through a system that is similar to those used in many real-world racing circuits. You earn a certain amount of points depending on what place you finish in, and bonuses can be won for fastest lap and laps in the lead. In addition to the standard racing fare, you can participate in a Rumble where the goal is to eliminate the competition by knocking them off of the track. If you like a little combat with your racing, STREET RACER is for you.
