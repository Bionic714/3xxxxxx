,NisseP,2007-05-19T07:24Z,IMDB URL should be the URL to the page on IMDB where you can read about the movie  and not to end up at the index-page on bitvn.com. Who cares about the bitvn.com place..

Five very boring characters take off for a weekend in the forest. Once there, strange things start to happen: one of the girls is having visions where she sees her friends die in the most horrible ways. Soon her visions are becoming true. Really, really bad horror film with many long, melodramatic scenes. There's a lot of blood, many bad actors and little logic. The only thing this turkey is reminiscent of is the unbelievably bad Thai movie ""Diecovery"". The only really good film in this four-part horror ""series"" (the others being ""Roommates"", ""February 29"" and ""Forbidden Floor"") is ""February 29"", imho. ""Dark Forest"", on the other hand, is purely bottom-of-the-barrel stuff.

,Schwein,2007-05-20T06:31Z,"Thank you, NisseP for that link to IMDB. The movie is asian. That's all I need to know about a horror movie to reject it. Damn, do the asian horror movies suck? The american remakes suck too, but not quite as much because at least they have better effects.
Asian movies...If it's not some Jet Li round- kicking for 90 minutes it's a  pale-faced kid who you'd just love come crawl out of the screen so you could spank his pale ass, follow him when he crawls back in as he tries to escape back to Japan so you could kill every living soul you meet.
Horror my ass. 
I hate asian movies."
