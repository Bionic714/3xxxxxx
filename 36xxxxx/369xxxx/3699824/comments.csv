[T],jotun_82,2007-06-12T17:59Z,"Bad soundquality. This sounds like it it 64 kbit mp3 files...I recoment not downloading, whait for the real thing!!!"
,BrnmccO1,2007-06-16T21:12Z,"Whatever jotun_82.  It sounds fine to me.  All 192 kbps like he says.  I have a 128 kbps track from the Vanilla Sky Album that sounds worse than this.

By the way, Labiosus, and jotun, I see you haven't uploaded any .torrents at all... so whyncha just..... stfu l33cher n00bs... lรถl."
,WaltDog,2007-06-19T08:11Z,"Forget the comments about the quality being bad, it's 192 kbps and it sounds perfect.  They're probably fake posters from the RIAA trying to get you not to dl this, never mind them."
