Im baaaaaaaaaaacckkkkkkkkkk!!!!

Ive brought you the first 2 seasons in HRHD, and now here is season 3 complete in 720p HDTV H.264 encoded with the x264 encoder. All episodes are in crisp untouched 384kbps 5.1 Dolby Digital (AC3) sound. These encodes are done be me, ctu, and saints. Ive taken only the best releases from each and combined them into this complete season 3 torrent. This is a big one, but well worth it as this was a hell of a season.
