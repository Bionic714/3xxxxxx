I'm Going To Seed This Indefinately Once I'm Completed Because It's Pretty Much The Best Torrent I've Ever Seen.

HD Is The Way Everything Should Be."
,storm-p1,2007-05-29T12:21Z,"You are a bloody legend mate!!

I don't have my own computer and the folks telll me to turn it off constantly to save money, but I will definetely try to keep this one running and running and running.

This is truely a GREAT torrent!!"
,OneStepAhead,2007-05-30T03:21Z,dont worry guys ill seed for a while and after its done ill check in on it frequently... thx for the comments
,bullepep,2007-05-30T05:18Z,Can these files be burned on DVD ?
,OneStepAhead,2007-06-01T02:03Z,"Files are 1/4 of a DVD size, so 4 fit on a DVD. If you mean can these files PLAYBACK on a DVD player, then you will need to covert them using a software program such as Nero Vision. Nero Vision makes the process really simple and you can make a menu with it and everything. If you do convert them to DVD-Video I recommend putting them no more then 3 or 4 episodes per disc. -OSA"
,storm-p1,2007-06-03T16:01Z,"How about subtitles for this release?

Would kill for DANISH subs, but English would also do...

Is it possible to download any subs for this release?
Would be tanfastic!"
,OneStepAhead,2007-06-06T01:00Z,"well some subtitles from this season are available here: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-eng/idmovie-213

but someone could make a subtitle pack for this release if they are feeling giving.. i've already done my part i think :) if you do make one please message me and let me know -OSA

by the way, this is now fully seeded.. YAY!"
,lostfanatic815,2007-06-25T09:58Z,Wow! Thanks a lot! I started downloading episode by episode in HD before I found this. Cool...
,storm-p1,2007-07-17T17:52Z,"What about subs for this brilliant torrent?

Still waiting for some legend to write danish subs :-) then I can persuade my girlfriend to watch the third season with me...!

And I don't want to watch it without her (we got the first two on DVD)

Danish sub would be awesome...

Can't explain how much I love ""lost"" and I will 110% buy the DVD when it is released..but unfortunately we will have to wait till september comes.

The lost-crew if fucking legendary, sorry for downloading...but hurry up with the DVD release!

Danish Subs!
Danish Subs!"
,axdavis06,2007-07-28T05:11Z,"Please help - I am new to this.  I downloaded the torrent and downloaded VLC player.  When I try to open with VLC by File, Open File and then I browse to the torrent, VLC just sits there and doesn't open anything...
So I downloaded the K-lite Codec Pack Full, I open the Media Player Classic and then browse to open the torrent and it says ""cannot render the file""
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!"
,overzicht,2007-10-10T15:31Z,"@Misbeliever

I have the best results with VLC player.
I always change the priority of VLC.exe to high in the processes tab of Task Manager.
That way there shouldnt be any lagging audio or skipping of frames.
I use XP"
