,Triggie,2007-05-30T21:45Z,This movie is missing 10 minutes! Everything between the 9th and 19th minute is gone.
,Qlown,2007-06-01T02:33Z,"Seems to be a great movie, nice quality, HOWEVER its missing VITAL parts as Triggie said.. Everything between 9th and 19 min is gone. "
,matt3man,2007-06-05T22:12Z,Triggie and Qlown are right. Just started watching it and some serious gaps appeared. DonÂ´t waste time or bandwith downloading / seeding this one.
,forza82,2007-06-14T01:27Z,"This movie stinks! DonÂ´t download it, you will just be dissapointed. Read the book instead. I repeat: Do not waste any of your time on this extremly sucky B-movie."

You can find it here at good ol' loder:

The film itself is ...well....soso."
