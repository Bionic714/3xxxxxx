,zozoo_jb,2007-10-21T14:44Z,"I have downloaded this file. It's all VOB, BUP and IFO files that need converting. I have used WinAVI to convert it into avi.file unfortunately though I can only see the movie NO sound! Any advice anyone??? Please!!! Thanks in advance!"
,zozoo_jb,2007-10-21T15:12Z,"ok, I have seemed to kind of figured this out. If you ok the files to convert into seperate avi.files instead of one avi.file. You'll get the sound aswell. But is it suppose to convert in seperate movies? And I thought you could choose if you wanted subtitles and in what language...but that doesn't seem to work, right? Anyone who've had more success??? PLZ Let me know! "
,zozoo_jb,2007-10-24T22:14Z,"when the ""making of"" or ""behind the scene"" is showing there is this spanish talking guy that ruins everything. I would much rather just here the actual directors talking? Is that possible? What is the best way to convert these files?"
,artylandia,2007-10-25T07:32Z,"hey zozoo_jb, just open NERO, select DVD Video, place all the files in the ""Four Rooms"" folder into the ""Video TS"" folder, and burn.  "
,zozoo_jb,2007-10-25T22:24Z,"Thanks artylandia for your advice...so I need to burn it to a DVD? I have to get does. I converted it with ""DivX Converter"" and saved it on my hardware. Which worked kind of OK apart from the fact that in some scenes the audio wasn't really sync'd with the movie.
If I use ""Nero"" do I get rid off the dubbing at the end when the extras are showing (directors and actors are speaking)?"
