I, Videogame Episode 2

In the late 1970s and 1980s, instead of controlling ?things? like spaceships and tennis rackets, videogame technology let players command recognizable characters with real faces and back stories. 
Game developers were liberated to create more complex videogames with heroic journeys ? and Japanese creators like Shigeru Miyamoto rose to prominence with star characters Mario, Donkey Kong and Zelda. 
But in the 1990s, Generation X emerged and the games of their childhood couldn?t satisfy the new teen angst that now permeated pop culture. 
With Sega?s Genesis and Sony?s PlayStation, gamers dismissed cutesy cartoon characters in favour of grittier heroes like Sonic the Hedgehog and anti-heroes in games like Grand Theft Auto III. 
As players grew up, their youthful idealism was replaced with a warier view of the world and a yearning for photorealistic, angry anti-heroes. 
This episode features interviews with Trip Hawkins (Silicon Valley entrepreneur and co-founder of Electronic Arts), Al Lowe (creator of Leisure Suit Larry), Tim Schafer (creator of Full Throttle) and other notable figures in the gaming industry.
