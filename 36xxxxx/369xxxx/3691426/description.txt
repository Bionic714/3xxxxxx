Chavez Venezuela and The New Latin America

In February 2004 ALEIDA GUEVARA conducted an extended,
exclusive interview with HUGO CHAVEZ, president of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, exploring Venezuela's
explosive revolutionary terrain post-April 2002 when
Chavez survived a coup attempt instigated by the
United States.

Featuring a dramatic interveiw with Jorge Garcia Carneiro,
newly appointed head of Venezuelan Armed Forces, and
vox-pops with Venezuelans involved in the country's
many social programs, this film affords a rare opportunity
to glimpse through the blockade of information imposed by
the United States and into a country rich with hope,
dreams and... oil.
