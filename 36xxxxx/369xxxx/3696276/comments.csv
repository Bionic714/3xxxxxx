,kaloian0193,2007-06-29T12:04Z,hmm yeah naabs right..... but this crap isos arent really something...... they just install the game for skirmish/multiplay game (crack) omg cant you just make a perfect iso???? like that it will run fine.... whitout crack o tell me DOES IT HAVE SECUROM OR SAFE DISK OR SOMETHING?
,kaloian0193,2007-06-29T12:07Z,"yeah inserted the disk then what it shows you?....... (insert proper disk in cd drive) this isos arent the original theyt are copy cats....... whitch means only crap will work..... we need original ISOS from DVD!!!! coz

4 isos isnt good.... they usualy make 1 DVD or 2 CD max..... -.-"
,kaloian0193,2007-06-29T12:07Z,crack* sory xD
,plinxie,2007-07-05T21:52Z,This game is made of 4 CDs. They actually made games of 4 CD after all. I don't remember if it had securom or safe disk but I just remember it would take ages to rip em.
,aljinn99,2007-08-10T03:33Z,"So case and point does this game work, can you play this game?"
,GrayMare,2007-08-15T23:55Z,"Ugh, they're ISOs, just emulate them with DAEMON Tools or something.

Install the game, then look in the contents of the first ""CD."" There is a folder called ""Crack."" This does NOT mean that you can play the game without the CD. It's actually more there so that the game will actually work. Just copy and paste the file ""Emperor"" and replace it with the one in the folder that you installed the game in, and *WHAM* the game works. The other three CDs are as follows:

Atreides Disk - Disk 2
Harkonnen Disk - Disk 3
Ordos Disk - Disk 4

Enjoy."
,GrayMare,2007-08-15T23:56Z,I'm amazed no one figured this out yet =/
,ksmlody,2007-09-02T18:04Z,"1. Install latest daemon tools (now is 4.10).
2. Enable Securom protection.
3. Mount cd1 and install the game with 036666-666666-666666-2921 serial.
4. Download from emule file ed2k://|file|Emperor%20-%20Battle%20For%20Dune%20-%201%2009%20Patch%20Crack%20Keygen%20(By%20Pdor).zip|7834141|701F27D87B3359C38553C4494CF4B64E|/ unzip them, install patch and at last copy crack from this archive.

,kabs,2008-04-21T14:30Z,"Wow, you people. You sicken me. These people just asked for a little help is all, just because they're newbs to all of this doesn't make you some fort of fucking god send. i think that you need to leave your mother's basements, go out into the real world and try speaking to people like that. It's really fucking easy to be so fucking rude when its out over the fucking internet and not face to face isn't it. Go out, grow the fuck up, get laid, whatever the fuck you need to become an actual human fucking being. Peace."

What I noticed: Power ISO can't mount these images, I tried with Daemon Tools Pro and managed to mount 1st CD and install it, then I browse CD1 and copied crack file to installation directory and finally I can play only skirmish missions. I can't play any campaigns, game asks to put Atreides disc or Harkonen or Ordos whichever house you wanna play and all Images are mounted and SecureRom is enabled in Daemon so I don't really understand why missions not work! I was looking fro this game so long........
Please anybody help. Advice, Guide.
Thanks in advance"

,Kite4444,2010-05-21T04:06Z,I read some comments and almost all of you are wondering how to open the ISO or your program says it can't find it. I used 7-Zip to open the ISO and extract the files in a folder. The results: CDs on my computer and no problem running them.

Not so... it was very easy :D Thank s balark, may the Nordic Gods smile upon you \o/ I just mounted disc 1, installed, then copy d  the crack into the install dir. It works like vodka on girls. I have no idea what the other 3 disk's are for?!? Wish someone could tell por hen...
ps: game looks sweet >:)"
,mihaihen,2011-04-10T15:49Z,"Ok... the disc's are for playing the campaigns and you have to have one mounted to play the skirmish. Yey, because i found out stuff!"
,BlazedWithPower,2011-06-09T17:00Z,"It works some people are just dumb. This one is a little tricky because you have to switch ISOs in game but if you know how to use deamon tools you should be fine. 

Awesome game!"
,that1dude0092,2011-07-03T05:38Z,"if some of you are wondering what the other discs are then i will tell you
disc 1 is the normal one but no campaign only skirmish and tutorial 
disc 2 is the Atreides campaign 
disc3 is the harkonen campaign
disc4 is the ordos campaign
you dont need to install the other 3 discs you just put them in the disc tray and open up games go to single player and then etc..."
,Axiomaticstatic,2011-07-04T03:54Z,"okay I have gone through all the steps...

Install disc 1
serial number.. 
install crack

But when i launch it using the new exe I get the following error.

The Application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click ok the close the application.

So what am I doing wrong? Must be something, but i uninstalled and reinstalled twice now, same thing. Any advice would be great."
,that1dude0092,2011-07-04T06:56Z,"how to install
step 1. mount or burn Emperordisc1 (the other disc are optional unless you want to play single player)
step 2. Install the game 
if you need a key here is one 036642-256734-246754-5204 or go to this site http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090610210142AAazArs
step 3. After installing the game go to windows desktop DO NOT PLAY GAME YET!
step 4. open up Emperordisc 1 with 7-zip or winrar
step 5. once its open open up the folder ""Crack""
you will see an application called ""Emperor"" (The original was all in caps)
step 6. Extract Emperor.exe to the directory of the game which will be at
C:\Westwood\Emperor
 or in another location (Depending on where you installed the game) 
step 7. YOU ALL DONE!!!
tip: Do not install game by extracting the disc files to (Location) it wont install properly it needs to be installed by burnable disc or mounting it with deamon tools "
,that1dude0092,2011-07-04T06:59Z,"MOAR TIPS
to play the other campaign 
you need to burn or mount 
Emperordisc2
Emperordisc3
Emperordisc4
after that play the first disc click on single player then to campaign then to the selected faction it will ask you to put in disc for that faction after that your done"
