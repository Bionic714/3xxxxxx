Synopsis.....:
After her daughter Julie is brutally raped and murdered, Karen McCaan (Sally Field) is turned down by the LAPD after she requests they keep suspect Robert Doob (Keifer Sutherland) in jail for good instead of paroling him. Nevertheless, the LAPD and the courts do decide to parole him and Karen turns to a group of hit man trainers for help. They teach her how to manage a gun, etc. Eventually, Karen's husband, Mack (Ed Harris), finds out and tries to stop her. Karen backs off. Robert Doob tracks Karen down at the McCaan home and breaks in, hoping to kill her.
