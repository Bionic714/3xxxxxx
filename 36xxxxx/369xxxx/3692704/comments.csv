,Kirksie,2008-09-21T20:45Z,The keygen is a trojan. Download program from microsoft and use serial: S/N: uuxk9-fb78j-ddig2-wiyyy-3m7d7-wcw2b
,FuckFCC,2009-12-31T15:42Z,"Can't verify that the keygen is a trojan, but more than likely it isn't. If you are new to keygen's they will show up as a virus in almost every anti virus software out there, but 99% of the time it's only a false positive. If anyone is worried about it containing anything malicious then just open it in a quarantined area thorough software like kaspersky or sandboxie and you'll be fine. Generate a few keys, save them in a notepad file, and then delete the keygen. 

Thanks for the excellent upload! "
