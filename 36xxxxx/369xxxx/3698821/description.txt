City Life is a modern city building simulation in a detailed real-time 3D view. 
The game allows building and managing 21st century cities in animate 
environments full of special effects. 

At the same time, the interests of six different Population groups must be considered. 

"City Life's" 3D engine even allows zooming right into the heart of the 
 city to watch life in the city from the perspective of its inhabitants.
