,valentino1,2007-06-28T19:08Z,"this is pretty interesting, Matisyn posted a few of these a while back but most of it's new.

I particularly like the song 'Beautiful' by Ariel's Dream. 

you were in these bands you say?"
,KrS14,2007-08-12T03:34Z,ya i was the drummer in Ariel's Dream ( i don't claim to be a good drummer lol ) and lead guitar in tcheshire
,valentino1,2007-08-18T20:57Z,"oh, very cool. i love the guitar work on 'Father' and the rerecorded version of it.

,KrS14,2007-08-30T03:38Z,"Thanx Valentino! heh ya the first version was when we were just starting to figure out the ins and outs of recording. The re-recorded one i used my 7 string. I envisioned it.. nice and low like that.  The main song was written by Joe and Josh Pitter (Brothers) and i think ""Kevin Matisyn"" reworked the original lyrics to suit his style.  I really should re-record some of these tunes now that i actually have access to a recording studio lol.. but that would require me to play the drums good... not sure about that, i'm slightly out of practice hahah"
,KrS14,2007-08-30T03:40Z,The originals of all the Tcheshire songs were recorded in Joe's hangout/apartment shack type thing behind his house hahah... talk about low-fi :) i remembered we smoked my UPS there trying to filter the bad AC we had lol Good times!
