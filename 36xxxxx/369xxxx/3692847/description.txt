                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week we broadcast from Montreal and feature Brian's conversation with 
philosopher Charles Taylor on the need to build spiritual bridges to avoid a 
global clash of cultures, and a report by Nick Spicer from Moscow about why a 
small but vocal opposition movement is rising again in Russia.We'll meet its 
unlikely hero.

We begin by visiting one of the most respected philosophers in the world today, 
Charles Taylor, whose writings over the past forty years have been translated 
around the world.  Since the 1960's, Charles Taylor has written, in books such 
as "The Malaise of Modernity", about the earthshaking transformations in 
culture and spirituality that define our modern era. In recent years he has 
been increasingly concerned with escalating bigotry and the violence it 
produces. Taylor is also known as a political activist and theorist as well as 
a Roman Catholic thinker. He has just been awarded the $1.5 million Templeton 
Prize to promote research into how spiritual aspirations shape society and 
politics.We met at the University of McGill in Montreal, where at 76, Taylor 
still lectures and is Professor Emeritus.

Charles Taylor argues the need for citizens everywhere to engage fully in 
politics. Our second subject exemplifies such commitment, regardless of cost. 
In Russia today, one of the big questions is how much oxygen remains in its 
democracy.  Former Grand Chess Master Garry Kasparov, one of the greatest 
players ever, has decided that preserving freedom is a contest he has to be 
involved in and he's prepared to risk his own liberty to do so. Kasparov is 
looking ahead to the much anticipated Presidential elections in Russia in 2008. 
Vladimir Putin is scheduled to step down, because the Constitution prevents him 
from seeking a third term. That opens the race to the liberal opposition. 
Kasparov could run in those elections. He's now  part of a broad coalition of 
opposition parties called THE OTHER RUSSIA. The liberal oppsition in Russia 
used to be a lively part of the political scene. But under Putin it has been 
sidelined. That is now changing. This spring there have been anti Kremlin 
protests, the like of which hasn't been seen in years. The CBC's Moscow 
reporter Nick Spicer is tracking the liberal oppostion's tentative steps 
forward with Kasparov as its most charismatic leader.
