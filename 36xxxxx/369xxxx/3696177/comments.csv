,Cheiz,2007-05-26T01:07Z,"Yeah I'm also stuck ay 7.7% and when i look at my peers list i see a lot of people have the same problem. But t'he weird thing is i AM connected to 4 seeds, all with the ip 38.10something, but they seem to be uploading only to other people in that IP range, maybe they're building some kind of seeding army?"
,msiegy,2007-05-26T01:19Z,"damn, im also stuck at 7.6%, although i show no seeders in the swarm. come on seeders!!! :)"
,Cheiz,2007-05-26T16:53Z,"ok can someone tell me wt... is this supposed to mean... there are about 10 peers with IP 38.103.x.x/38.105.x.x among them are the only seeders. But they only seem to be connected with eachother, the rest of us cant get any further than 7.7%"
,it6uru,2007-05-27T01:00Z,OK common simen_90 please (re)seed. It shows that there are 3 seeders but im not connecting to anyone. It would be much appreciated.

,simen_90,2007-05-30T14:56Z,"I might add that some of the episodes doesn't work in windows media player.. But then again, windows media player isn't a good media player for HD videos. I recommend, Nero showtime or VLC media player..."
