,FaderAbraham,2007-05-21T21:33Z,"Thanks for this one! :)

Although I'm not 100% sure of what a gatefold is, can you scan it? It surely would help if there was some art present when making a standard format custom cover."
,mondo,2007-05-21T21:39Z,"Faderabraham >>
A gatefold = a papercover.. same as may boxsets have, but just for one disc... The thing is that I borrowed this movie from a friend and he sold it on a auction, so I can´t scan the cover... Although I should lookaround for it.."
,FaderAbraham,2007-05-22T08:35Z,"Ok. I found a fairly good resolution cover front(that yellow X) so I'll make a cover for myself, and if it's good I'll even dare to share it.

Btw, I heard there is/there has been problems with the english subtitles of a release of Johnny Hamlet, but this one's ok?"
,mondo,2007-05-22T08:50Z,"Faderabraham >>

I watched it in VLC-player and the subtitlerows overlapped eachother sometimes.. Maybe three or four times.. But VLC has done that to several other movies so..... I did´n think of something else that was a problem.. But it was a pretty long time sience i saw it.. Well, when it was released

What problems have you heard of?

Puh... Jobbigt o skriva på engelska. Antar att du är svensk? Men det är ju inte fel om alla fattar... :P"
,FaderAbraham,2007-05-22T09:08Z,"I read this over at spaghetti-western.net, but I suppose the only ""problem"" that's been is that the sub options weren't reachable through the menu.(""On previous Koch Media DVDs the English subtitles existed, but were only available by picking them on your remote control."")

But, who cares!? It works! :)

Ja, jag är svensk, men, som sagt, det är inte fel om alla fattar. :P"
,mondo,2007-05-22T09:41Z,"I see... Hmm.. I havn´t burnt out the DVD and tried it on my DVD-player, but in VLC the subitles works just fine through the menus. I even mounted the disc with Daemontools and tried it thatway through Mediacenter and it worked fine there to..

,mondo,2007-05-22T15:28Z,"For all of you that wanted a cover fo thisone I´ve put together a custom one that can be found here:
