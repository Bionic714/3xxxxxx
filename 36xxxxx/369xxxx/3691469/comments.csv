,karinaerkul,2008-04-16T20:47Z,seed please! 
,babypower,2010-09-08T17:50Z,Please seed. I'm trying to download this torrent for a week now and the best download speed is around 20 kb/s and that only happened in the first day. Most of the episodes are around 70% done thus I can't see any of them. If you decide to upload something then stick around for others to download as well and seed on their own. Thanks.
