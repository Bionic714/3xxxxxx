Overview:
Based on a manga by Chika Umino.

Takemoto Yuuta, Mayama Takumi and Morita Shinobu are three art school students, friends and flat-mates. Yuuta, the freshman, lives in terror of Morita, a very erratic sculptor.

Their routine is disrupted when their teacher, Hanamoto, introduces them to his cousin`s daughter, Hagumi Hanamoto. Even though she`s entered college, she looks like a middle school student. Yet despite her appearance, she`s a talented sculptor and painter with several gallery showings already in her portfolio. Naturally, all the men around her fall in love with her.
