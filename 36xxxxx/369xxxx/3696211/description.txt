Today is the 24th of May, the Slavic Alphabet Day according to the official Bulgarian holidays and we all celebrate the act of inventing it. 
The great men connected with this are the Holy brothers Kiril and Metodii, and their student Climent Ohridski, who actually arranged the original letters still used by the nations of Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia, Russia, Ukraine, Belorus and even Mongolia... 

Those are all the wonderfull classic choral songs from the times of Bulgarian national Revival and soon after, including the national anthem and battle hymns. 

DA JIVEY !!!
