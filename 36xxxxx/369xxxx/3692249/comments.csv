get-password.html
&
heroes.S1E23.preview.rar

don't bother with this 'get password' bollocks, it's probably going to give you a virus, spyware, or some other shit you don't want."
,Anonymousftw,2007-05-20T17:14Z,Has somebody bothered getting the password for the .rar file?
,Analwart,2007-05-20T21:31Z,"Holy crap ... they need to ban the idiots still using password protection on the files.  No viable reason for making folks jump through a bunch of extra hoops.

Unless you are prepared to play a RMVB file type don't even waste your time for a preview file when the new show is only a few days away."
