Director Spike Lee and Roger Guenveur Smith collaborate for the 7th time to bring Newton's thoughts, philosophies, history and flavour to life. Adapted from Robert Guenveur Smith's Obie Award winning off- Broadway solo performance of the same name, Spike Lee brings the play from the stage to the screen as only he could. Shot before a live audience, Spike Lee uses his signature mixture of film and archival footage, to capture Newton's ""inner mind.""

Accompanied by an outstanding performance, starring and written by Roger Guenveur Smith, Nominated for two NAACP Image Awards and for winning the Peabody Award.
