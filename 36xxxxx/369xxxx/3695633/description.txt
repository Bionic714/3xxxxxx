Ian Hislop's Scouting for Boys

Sunday 20 May
11:30pm - 12:30am

Ian Hislop uncovers the story behind the book which kick-started the Scout movement - Robert Baden-Powell's handbook, Scouting for Boys, written in 1908 and one of the bestselling books ever. Despite it being very eccentric, very Edwardian and very British, Ian discovers that the book is actually very radical and addresses many issues that we think of as modern, such as citizenship, disaffected youth and social responsibility. Contributors include Baden-Powell's grandson and biographer Tim Jeal.
