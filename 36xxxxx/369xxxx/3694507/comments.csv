,duhprane,2007-05-26T16:26Z,"Karl is Goebbels, but the movie isn't that great."
,Laej,2007-05-26T16:47Z,have those emails been leaked if so where the fork are they? :`(
,duhprane,2007-06-08T05:09Z,"Goto gregpalast.com for 500 of the missing emails, it wasnt about Rove and the US atty firings, it was about Rove's vote caging military votes during the 2004 presidential election. The truth is the Bush admin doesn't trust the military and hates blacks so they threw out thier votes and recently Conyers has made a specific request from BBC to have all this info turned over to Congress. (Palast reports for BBC)

Oh and it gets worse, but you have to read...."
