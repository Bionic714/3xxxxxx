Java 2 Platform Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK). The JDK is a development environment for building applications, applets, and components using the Java programming language. 

The JDK includes tools useful for developing and testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used from the command line. Except for the appletviewer, these tools do not provide a graphical user interface.
