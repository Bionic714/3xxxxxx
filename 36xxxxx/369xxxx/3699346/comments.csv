Back when it was released, the violence of Polanki''s Macbeth seemed radical and extreme, and it was widely criticized.   Thirty years later, the shock value has abated enough that we can see Polanski''s Macbeth as nothing more than a faithful elaboration on the gruesome imagery that was already present in Shakespeare's text.

 Polanski made this film not long after his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, had been murdered by the Manson family, and the murder of Lady Macduff seems to recall that still-fresh horror.

The scene of Macbeth's prophetic vision in the presense of the weird sisters is brilliant.  The reading of Shakespeare's text by the actors is excellent.  However, the editing of the text may make it confusing to anyone encountering Macbeth for the first time,  Bring Cliff notes."
