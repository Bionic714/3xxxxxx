,Hej med dig,2007-05-26T22:37Z,is this real.... 
,Walter_092,2007-05-30T17:00Z,depends on what you call real. Probably the right songs by the right artist but not the final studio release.
,Logical_Choice,2007-06-02T22:34Z,"Jesus, if this is what the album will be like when it gets released, its no wonder Axl has sat on it for the last 15 years!!!! Music has moved on since Guns n Roses meant anything, I hope they don't ruin their legend by releasing shite like thsi."
,Gizle,2007-07-21T03:09Z,"No, this is NOT the new Gn'R album. Not even a ""release"" .This must be compilation of demostuff and livestuff...it's all a mess-don't you hear?...I'll bet the new REAL DEAL's gonna be 200 tmes better!"
