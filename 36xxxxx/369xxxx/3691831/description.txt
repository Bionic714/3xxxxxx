It's hard, maybe impossible to categorize what kind of movie "Wasabi" is. First, it starts off as a kind of parody of Dirty Harry movies. Then it becomes a pretty serious look at the sadness and inability to let go the main character has had for almost 2 decades. Then it becomes a kind of goofy "buddy" movie once in Japan. Then a murder mystery. Then a shoot-up action movie.
