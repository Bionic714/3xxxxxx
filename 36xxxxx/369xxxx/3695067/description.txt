Not wellknown but extremely talented hungarian pianist Mark Farago plays works by Scriabin and Chopin. He is now 31 years old and studied with the great russian pianist Leonid Brumberg (student of Heinrich Neuhaus) in Vienna. This is a live recording of a recital he was giving at the Ceremonial Hall of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest in 2006.

Please enjoy his very personal and emotional playing. Strongly recommended for all piano lovers.
