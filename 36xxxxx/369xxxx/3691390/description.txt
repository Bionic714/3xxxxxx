Medieval music with Dominique Vellard and Ensemble Gilles Binchois:

Ecole de Notre Dame
Guillaume de Machaut: Messe de Notre Dame
Les premieres polyphonies francaises
Les Tons de la Musique
Les trois Maries
Le vray remede d'amor
Mon souverain desir
Nova cantica

This i the same as the other one, http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3691386, except for the record "Musique et poesie", that was some problems with downloading. Now when I try to upload this one, I get this message from Pirate Bay:

"We're doing an upgrade to the server park, we are sorry for the inconvenience, but this is needed to cope with the growing number of users. Our database is above file systems limits now..."

So please forgive me if it doesn't work, I will try once more.
