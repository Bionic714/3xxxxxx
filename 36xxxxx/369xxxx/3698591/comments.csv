,Hobbish,2007-07-24T20:25Z,"Uhm, i need some help!

When i've installed and copied the crack, i tried to start it, and then some graphic card tester came up for checking the best resolution or something. I pressed ""ok"" then it said:

""The resolution test has failed. Please make sure you have the latest drivers for your videocard and run the test again.""

What the hell? Help please, and I do have the latest drivers."
,Hobbish,2007-07-24T20:36Z,"Sorry, forget what I said. I fixed it. Now i can't understand why i cannot play ""Single player"" I cant press the damn button! :S Help please :) Thanks in advance!

/Hobbe"
,Hobbish,2007-07-24T20:39Z,"Forget what I said, i've fixed it all! xD

Btw just keep in mind that you have to:

1. install
2. Crack (explore the cd)
3. open the right file (dfbhd)
4. Check if you got new drivers installed and that you have DirectX installed.

Then you should be fine! GLHF!"

,DamnBush,2007-10-10T11:36Z,"also, sorry for the double post, if you have problems with the keys, you are probably entering the code for the wrong installation, remember, theres black hawk down CD keys, and then theres BHD- team sabre CD keys, both programs are difrent, i was entering the team sabre codes for BHD :P till i scrolled up that is. they all work."
