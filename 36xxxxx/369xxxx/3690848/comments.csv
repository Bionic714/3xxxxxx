,friendly,2007-05-19T11:04Z,"teser76, again, great torrent !"

,teser76,2007-05-21T00:45Z,"rbt1   Update wiikey....
                +  use Regionfrii"
,rbt1,2007-05-21T15:50Z,"Ok, just entered what the compatibility database has on these games. Haven't tested."
,rbt1,2007-05-21T18:33Z,"BTW. teser could upload the WiiKey upgrade if you have it, and it enables games that's marked as incompatible on the compat-list? A lot of people would appreciate it.

I guess it doesn't matter if you patch to PAL, UK-PAL or any other? I use RegionFrii 1.20, so if the older version you have or any other region code starts these games on PAL, please tell."
,teser76,2007-05-21T22:40Z,"rbt1  Sorry, test PAL console and incompatible moment.....
Mea culpa."

,rotravi,2007-05-23T11:04Z,"i downloaded Bust a move bash,and it works :-)"
,rbt1,2007-05-23T20:23Z,rotravi: it's in PAL so if you have a PAL machine it should work. Theres no info if this PAL game works on NTSC so please update http://wiki.gbatemp.net/index.php/Wii_Region_Patcher_Compatibility_List if you find it working.

,ctrlaltde1337,2007-07-05T14:07Z,"pretty poor seeding, folks... I'm downloading at ~30-40 kbps and uploading ~500kbps on my 10/10mbit connection. currently at 50% (of the 2 games I want). I'm sensing a lot of leechers with upload speed limit activated. :("
,ctrlaltde1337,2007-07-06T12:16Z,"alright, if all of you ""fellow peers"" are going to limit your upload, so will I. 

this sucks."
