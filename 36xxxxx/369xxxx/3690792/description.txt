Overview:	Internationally lauded as one of the greatest, this magnificent martial arts masterpiece marked the titanic, one-time only, teaming of renowned champion Jet Li ("Romeo Must Die") with legendary director Lau Kar Leung. The two mount unforgettable battles in the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and even on the Yangtze River with a kung fu cast of hundreds. If the brilliant American musical director Busby Berkeley knew kung fu, this spectacular, eye-filling epic might be the movie he would have made.
