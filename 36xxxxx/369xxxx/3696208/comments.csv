,rperron,2007-06-05T04:54Z,"Thank you for the u/l.  I have it installed on my palm 700wx and it works great.  But I can't get it to recognize my USA and Canada map (6.75)  How do you get it to recognize new maps?  I have tried the following with no luck:
1. Copied new map to SD card root directory, Navigated to ""Switch Map"" in TT but the map wasn't available.
2. Edited the ""Current Map"" file to point to the new map directory on the SD Card.  Still doesn't see it.
3. Researched everythere I could fine information to see if this version of TT was compatible with 6.75 maps and they ALL say it is.

So I am obviously doing something wrong and I need someone smarter than I am to help me.  Please help.  I leave on vacation in 4 days and really want this to work.  Thanks in advance."
