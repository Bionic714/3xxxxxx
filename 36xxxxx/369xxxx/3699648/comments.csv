It seems that you are hell of a physician when you need this crap.

Cheers !!! "
,docfirestein,2007-05-28T21:41Z,"Unfortunately it seems that I'm not quite as bright as you holevinsky. Because of this, I find it quite helpfull to have instant access to a stack of texts equivalent to a five story building in the palm of my hand. Some, like yourself, might be able to easily digest and memorize all this information during the short span of medical school. However, others aren't quite as intellectually gifted..."

Holevinsky, when you get your fucking nobel prize for medicine maybe you can come back and post on how you did it, jerkoff.
