the good:
video on this is quite nice.
one file for subs- vietnamese and english -easily edited to remove the vietnamese if you like.

the bad:
the entire movie is voiced over in vietnamese... not dubbed, original voice track is still there, just muted... the ONE voice actor talks over everyones lines with no inflection, as if hes reading a dull article from the newspaper, or choking on some soup... very annoying."

will see about it.... since I can't watch this ""voiced over"" movie... I would feel like I'm in spain...  can't do"
,sy1234,2009-12-30T00:39Z,"Confirmed that it has bad voiceover.

I'd consider watching this if I could get English subs.  They are not included / not working.  There is one .smi which is riddled with Korean, and is NOT ""easily edited""."
,horrorbilly,2010-09-20T19:55Z,"Works fine nice quality, don't mind the voice over, edited the subs. problem is I stuck at 99.8% but the move plays through fine; but would like that last 10mb of code?. would anyone like to quickly seed the rest of this movie for 30 seconds?"
