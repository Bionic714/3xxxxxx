,ac0de,2007-06-24T23:00Z,"Each plugin file is bound to a specific serial number found on the archos. Unless a crack is provided(and its not in this torrent file) then it simply wont work - regardless of this being the correct model or not.

,gomzi,2007-08-18T22:42Z,"listen to the guy/girl above me, what he/she says makes full sense, the ppl at archos have made sure that you pay for whatever service you use.
Archos have gerat devices.

anyway update your firmware of Aug2007."
,ksaravanakumar,2008-01-13T07:27Z,Plugins are specific to a device ... I don't think any crack has been found so far. If anyone finds a crack let me know too. :D
,heavensrevenge,2008-04-02T12:03Z,"Please, weould you tell me your *product key* in he system info so I may find a way to modify the plugin in order to get it working.  Basically it relies on the product key, so if the plugin and the product key are both releavled together in a binary editor/viewer, the plugin should be able to be modafied to suit any Archos of the same model (604 WiFi) :P

,Xris22,2008-09-22T06:40Z,"Archos pulled once of the shittiest tricks I've ever experienced buying white-goods/hardware ever... in selling a nice piece of multimedia hardware with full audio/video compatibility... but asking for MORE money (the gadget is not cheap to begin with) to switch on it's full functionality (MPEG, AVI etc.)

THAT is a totally greedy/shitty trick Archos!!!!!  Frickin money-grabbers.  Why not just be fair and put the price of the BIOS/pre-loaded renderers in the final package? Oh yeah... it's looks cheaper without the added price of the missing drivers.... 

They did pretty much the same shitty trick with the actual hardware capability too...  you need to pay a (not so small) fortune to buy the interfaces to access the (already built-in) recording and socket functionality.  SHAME ON YOU Archos!!!

Anywoot... beefing aside, as ac0de mentioned, the drivers are indeed bound to your own unique  Product Key.  And as gomzi suggests, you need to first update your firmware to minimum Firmware Update v1.6.23 for the newly bought codecs to work.

Greaaaaaaat device... but the hidden costs should be taken to the obudsman...  It's like selling a car with the (personally keyed) heating switch removed and the trunk key withheld until you cough up more money.  I can almost understanding them asking more for the hardware interfacing (most corporate bullies have been doing that for a long time) but actually omitting a part of the OS/BIOS to charge extra for it is worse than even the likes of Sony have ever come up with). 

Beef and double-beef over.  Peace all ^^

I've never heard of any available cracks for this, and I'm not sure if I would be happy applying cracks to this BIOS... even their own Firmware Update v1.6.23 is non-reversible.  So BE CAREFUL people..."
,edd707,2009-01-11T07:15Z,can you tell me ur product  key and your serial number? tnk in advance
