Genesis are an English progressive rock band formed in 1967. 
With approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide, 
Genesis are one of the top 30 highest-selling recording 
artists of all time.  In 1988, the band won a Grammy 
Award for Best Concept Music Video. Genesis's members have 
included Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett and 
Phil Collins, all of whom have achieved success as solo 
artists.

Genesis began as a 1960s pop band, playing moody, simple 
guitar-driven melodies. During the 1970s, they evolved into 
a progressive rock band, and began to incorporate complex 
song structures and elaborate instrumentation, while their 
concerts took on a more theatrical tone. This second phase 
was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 
twenty-three minute "Supper's Ready", and 1974's concept 
album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The 1980s saw the 
band produce more accessible pop music based on melodic 
hooks; this change of direction gave them their first 
number one-charting album in the United Kingdom, Duke, 
and their only number one single in the United States, 
"Invisible Touch".


Genesis have changed personnel several times. Collins 
-previously the band's drummer- replaced Gabriel as 
lead singer in 1975, and was replaced by former Stiltskin 
singer Ray Wilson for the 1997 album Calling All Stations. 
Due to the commercial failure of that album, the band 
announced an indefinite hiatus. In October 2006, Collins, 
Rutherford and Tony Banks reunited for a world tour
