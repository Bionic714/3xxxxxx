,jonn_jonz,2007-11-09T04:56Z,Downloaded and installed.  Is there an executable for this or did I screw up?
,hashishin666,2008-01-21T01:21Z,A 10 DVD set and it's 231 kilobytes? WTF?
,hashishin666,2008-01-21T01:22Z,Okay so you made a torrent with a torrent in it. Why?
,fu_manchu,2008-01-23T17:43Z,"you didn't screw up fawk!. I wasn't able to upload the torrent from the other fucking tracker ok!. 

So its better to have this shit than nothing. And there are plenty of seeders so I thought sure why not make those on the piratebay happy right.  So don't give me shit. "
,yeerum,2008-01-31T17:40Z,"Someone seed please (not the .torrent, but the actual file).

Note: The torrent is 231 KiB because it downloads the actual torrent ""Synthogy Ivory 1.5 with keygen.torrent"", so make sure you open the downloaded torrent after it finishes..."
,bekok,2008-02-14T23:09Z,Does anyone know how to surpass that terrible thing called iLok? I'm running Logic Pro 8 on Mac Os X Leopard and I think I need to have the iLok thing to use Ivory... Hope someone knows how to deal with this.
,macvid46,2008-06-10T20:27Z,you can buy the iLok all you want but you need to have a valid Synthogy Product Serial Number
,imgriff,2008-06-15T00:22Z,"Oke Thanx!

,cactusleaf,2009-09-02T23:21Z,"Here's a strange phenomenon: As I'm downloading the torrent that this torrent leads to, the real torrent, all seems to be downloading fine.. about 100 mb/s, 700 mb downloaded.

BUT, as I'm watching the folder it's downloading to, the size of it is already at like 16 GIGS. And it's growing by like a gig a minute!! WHAAAT?? I mean, literally.. I can verify in Activity Monitor, Disk Inventory X, the ""get info"" pane for my HD and the file itself.. this file, which I've apparently only downloaded 700mb of, weighs 16..no 17gb and climbing. Each file in the torrent weighs 50mb and each one is arriving every like 10 seconds. This is impossible.. and at this rate, this 32.1gb torrent will end up being over 600gb.

Somebody please explain this. What am I missing? Obviously I'm going to stop the DL until someone can verify/correct me on this. Holy shit."
,cactusleaf,2009-09-02T23:26Z,"Oops. Change 100mb/s to 100kb/s. Typo.

,DarkEchoo,2009-11-18T23:08Z,"Well luckly, you don't have to use iLok when you have an older version of Synthology (lower than 1.7) - so yeah, no iLok problem here.

,maxximilan,2011-02-25T19:40Z,"here's the good advice..I also have Win7 64 bit:

""Hereâ€˜s how I installed it in Windows 7 64 bit: 
-Unrar the iso files when the download completes. 
-Mount or Burn each iso. 
-Copy over all of the instrument files from each CD to a new folder you create called Ivory Items. 
-Run the setup program from Disk 1 
-When the program says it cannot locate the library and asks for the path, go to the install location and locate the Ivory Items folder that it created. (not the one you created to manually copy over the instrument files) 
-It will not find the files and youll have to quite (dont sweat it) ""  ...continued->>>"
,maxximilan,2011-02-25T19:46Z,"-->>continuation..
""-Copy all of the items from the ivory items folder you created to the ivory items folder that was created by the install. 
-When copying over is complete, open the tools folder that is also listed in Ivory Items and run Ivory Library Tools 
-Choose convert and it should start converting the files from Mac to PC. 
-If it still cannot find the library files, you may have to quit and delete a file called LibraryPath and try the conversion a second time, specifying the location of the instrument files you copied again. 
-At this point you should be able to start up the VST in your host program. 
-To authorize, move Authorize Ivory.exe to the tools folder and run the program. (it wont run correctly unless its in the tools folder). 
-Use the keygen to authorize. 
I dont think this download has the standalone version of Ivory. Couldnt find it anywhere with what I downloaded. ""

AVG is flagging the keygen (which is in two separate RARs for some reason???) as a trojan and removing it, when i extract it.

so has anyone else had this? is it AVG being useless, or is the keygen actually a virus? if not, is there a work-around? because AVG wont even let me touch the darn file :/

When I run it on Cubase 5, there appears this:
Ivory has detected incorrect sample data

Library files have either been installed improperly or data on the disk has been corrupted.
So I'm not sure, but is it possible that it's because I copied the filed to the wrong folder? Here's how I did it:

 - from Bosendorfer 1 to Synth 2 (all the samples)
 - Documentation
 - Presets
 - RTAS
 - Tools
 - VST
 - .DS_store
 - .VolumeIcon.icns
