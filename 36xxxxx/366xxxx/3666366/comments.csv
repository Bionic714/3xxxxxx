,exco,2007-04-19T11:44Z,"Still waiting for TranceDude 2 seed.. Stuck at 12,7%"
,marfan,2007-04-21T01:06Z,"Och hur i hela glödheta har TranceDude tänkt sig detta? Du måste seeda så att åtminstone någon, eller allra helst några, av oss kan ta över!"
,marfan,2007-04-21T01:10Z,"TranceDude - you got to seed until at least one, or preferrably a few, of us may take over from you and continue seeding."
,TranceDude,2007-04-22T20:16Z,"Hello guys, im very sorry.. but my graph-cards fan just broke:s and i wont get my pc back in a while ( 2 weeks - a month) Its very sad=/ but ill promise to start seeding the torrent then:)!"
,TranceDude,2007-04-22T20:18Z,beklager på det sterkeste! Men viften på Skjerm/grafikk-kortet røk:( Får pcen tilbake om ca 2 uker- 1 måned kansje tidligere:) Håper det.. Lover dere at jeg kommer til å seede som bare F! da;):)
,TranceDude,2007-04-22T20:27Z,"The reason why i have to wait that long, and not just buy a new graph card, is becouse my dad wants to use the guarantee(garanti) we have on our comp. and we have to send the whole comp:s why not just send the graphs card:s its just dumb!:p Then i could just borrow a graph card from someone:p but when i get my comp back i promise to seed:) and i will put up new torrents like this;) like: NCP, Neo Cortex, Lasgo, PVD, etc:) just be patient:):)"
