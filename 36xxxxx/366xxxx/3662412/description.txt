Overview:	This period-fantasy piece from Producer Tsui Hark features his continuing trademarks of Wu'xia, flying people, wild characters and duels in the sky. On his way to a congress of kung fu masters, an initiate falls from a high cliff, only to be rescued by the lovely Tien Lam (Anita Mui), who rides a huge crane. When Tien Lam learns of the growing discord between the kung fu masters, she must intervene to prevent an all-out war between rival martial arts clans.
