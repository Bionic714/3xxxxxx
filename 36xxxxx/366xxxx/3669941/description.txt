       Keaton stars as Daphne Wilder, a mother whose love knows no 
       bounds or boundaries. She is the proud mom of three daughters: 
       stable psychologist Maggie (Lauren Graham), sexy and irreverent 
       Mae (Piper Perabo) and insecure, adorable Milly (Mandy Moore) - 
       who, when it comes to men, is like psychotic flypaper. In order 
       to prevent her youngest from making the same mistakes she did, 
       Daphne decides to set Milly up with the perfect man. Little 
       does Milly know, however, that her mom placed an ad in the 
       online personals to find him. Comic mayhem unfolds as Daphne 
       continues to do the wrong thing for the right reasons...all 
       in the name of love. In a hilarious battle of strong wills, 
       the mother-daughter dynamic is tested in all its fierce, 
       wacky complexity. The girls help Daphne finally discover the 
       truths and impossibilities of motherly love, all while trying 
       to answer the questions: where does it begin and where should it 
       end?
