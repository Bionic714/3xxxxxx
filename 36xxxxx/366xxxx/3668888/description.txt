Bone Thugs' new album will be released on May 8, 2007;
producers include Akon, Jermaine Dupri. Guest appearances
include The Game, Mariah Carey, Akon, Twista, and Chris
Leeper. According to the group they have recorded nearly
100 tracks and are in the process of deciding which tracks
will appear on the album. Although producer DJ-Uneek
helped to launch the band to stardom, he does not appear
on the album. According to the official track list issued
by Interscope, imprisoned member Flesh-n-Bone will not be
featured on the main track list, even though "Into the
Future" (the song on which he is featured) will be
available on certain editions of the album in the form of
a bonus track (three versions of the album are rumored to
be released, all with the same fourteen main tracks, with
the variations occuring in the two bonus tracks on each
version of the album).

A promotional single, "Just Vibe", has been released on
the radio in Southern California. Bone says Bizzy Bone
will not be on the album. Also says that this album will
be their best ever. Swizz Beatz will produce one track,
"Candy Paint", as the group signed in 2005 to Swizz Beatz'
Full Surface Records, and in 2006 to Interscope Records.
In March, the single "I Tried" featuring Akon was
released. It is currently being played in many radio
stations along with "Just Vibe" ,but "I Tried" is the
official single and is also currently charting.

From 2006 to the present, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, especially
Krayzie Bone, have continued their strong track record of
collaborations and appearances on compilation albums.
Krayzie appeared on Duets: The Final Chapter by The
Notorious B.I.G, the soundtrack from the Antonio Banderas
film Take the Lead, and on DJ Khaled's new album
Listennn... The Album (all of these appearances were
credited as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony on the track listings to
show the loyalty of the group). Bone Thugs appeared with
Lil Eazy-E on the soundtrack to The Game's acting debut in
the film Waist Deep, and on The Source Presents Fat Tape
Vol. 1. The most successful was Krayzie Bone's appearance
on Chamillionaire's number-one single "Ridin'" which they
won a grammy for. Krayzie Bone is featured on the new 2Pac
album Pac's Life on the song "Untouchable" (Swizz Beatz
remix), credited as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Bone's new video
"I Tried" was launched on March 7, 2007.
