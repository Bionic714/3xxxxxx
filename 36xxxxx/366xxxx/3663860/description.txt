Two Australian suburban families - the Edwards and the Shepherd's - find out what
life would be like when their energy and water supplies are suddenly turned off;
their rubbish bins locked and their vehicles clamped. After twenty-four hours,
one eco hotspot will be returned to each family and a consumption level will be
set, based on what scientists say will help save the planet. Once that level is
maintained another hotspot will be returned. The families will not get their
lives back until they drastically reduce their eco consumption, have all the
hotspots balanced and learn to live a sustainable lifestyle. For the two
families this could take weeks.
