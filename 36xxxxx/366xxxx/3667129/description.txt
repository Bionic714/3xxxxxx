"Childhood" was a song written, produced and sung by Michael Jackson. 
It became the theme song for Free Willy 2. Michael Jackson has said 
that if one should want to know him, they should listen to "Childhood", 
 saying, "It's the most honest song I've ever written". In the song 
 Jackson expresses the pain he feels from his early memories. He asks 
 not to be judged and shows us why he is trying to recapture his childhood. 
 
Music video 
 
The video for "Childhood", directed by Nick Brant, is of Michael in a 
forest as ships full of children float up in the air. The video is well 
remembered for its Peter Pan theme[citation needed]. The video was shot 
in 1995 Sequoia National Park where Jackson and many children reenacted 
scenes from Peter Pan. The video was a short shoot and Michael Jackson s 
appearance seemed youthful and for the first time, Jackson s hair was short 
in a music video.[1] The video never caught on like its partner single 
"Scream" and was not in the track line-up of the HIStory World Tour. Jackson 
was supposed to perform the song at the 1996 Grammys where he was nominated 
for Album of the Year. However, the performance was canceled.
