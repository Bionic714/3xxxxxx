,Cmama,2009-06-29T07:16Z,"Video and audio are in separate files. they both play with windows media player.

My question is how do I included the music to the video to listen to both at the same time.
The video plays with no sound and the audio plays with no video.
How do I put both together.
Can anyone help me."
