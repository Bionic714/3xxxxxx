Overview:	In a time of great danger, the Monks of Dunhuang hid the Sharira -- a Relic purported to contain the pure essence of a Holy Man in the Buddhist religion. To protect this greatest of treasures, it was placed where no ordinary human being would ever be able to reach. However, it is destined to happen that someday the Sharira will be recovered. To ensure that it could be retrieved when such time came, the Monks turned to a family of acrobats. For hundreds of years this family has trained, passing on the skills required to perform the ultimate leap when the time is at hand.

In modern Qingdao, Yin (Michelle Yeoh) and her brother Tong are the last heirs in this long lineage of acrobats. Being circus performers, they travel throughout the world, entrancing audiences with their stunningly beautiful gymnastic performance. One day, Eric, a man from Yin's past, shows up with a Medallion - the Heart of Dunhuang - a key to unlock the secrets, a clue to unveil the legend of the Sharira. Together they embark on a hazardous journey to rediscover what her ancestors once protected. Following closely on their trail is Karl, a merciless, unscrupulous rich man who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the valuable treasures.
