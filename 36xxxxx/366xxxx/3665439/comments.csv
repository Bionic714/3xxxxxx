,wfgovie,2007-04-16T20:13Z,"@ senson as well! If you took the time to notice, which Im sure you didn't the patch is custom work of mine and the torrent and setup are also. So If you've seen this elsewhere then its stolen. Not that I'm upset after all that's the nature of the beast. Save your ignorant rants for the Bible belt noob"
,gerryn,2007-04-17T06:44Z,haha i love your comments sensons ;)
,bionaire,2007-04-18T10:49Z,AVG tells me the setup.exe contains a virus.
,wfgovie,2007-04-22T16:47Z,^^ not true! lies all lies
,jayrock1977,2007-04-26T22:41Z,It's true. infected shit. I was up half the night gettin this bullshit out of my fucking system. 
,gbemi,2007-05-31T02:26Z,this antivirus is usless ..fucked up my pals machine 
,Makke3,2007-06-25T13:27Z,"@coolM: I think u forgot one thing. After u installed nod32 u DON'T open the program or re-start the comp. until after u patched. I have used Nod for 2,5 years now and when I had that trouble I missed that thing. good luck."
,IHWHI,2007-06-25T19:12Z,does this work for vista??
,IHWHI,2007-06-25T20:20Z,"I have the same problem as coolm.. When ever I try to update it has a error :(

any ideas??

ohh by the way, I didnt start the program or restart"
,torrentstorm,2007-07-03T19:17Z,"It works and updates with no problems at all (did as instructed)
My trail has 45795.5years remaining (hope not to live that much 8o)

Thanks upper

@IHWHI It must work in Vista because its stated by eset."
,torrentstorm,2007-07-03T19:21Z,"sry I've forgot

scaned at virustotal and jotti (~20 anti-viruses each) and they all state thats clean."
,WeXaztor,2007-08-01T18:03Z,anyone knows why updates wierd? when i try to update it says NOD is uptodate but when i start it or search for viruses it says that it is outofdate :S
,mikemc1,2007-08-06T10:06Z,is this working can anybody tell is it english
,Rebellious,2007-08-08T15:19Z,This download worked fine at first but then it caused some problems with my computer. Kaspersky showed no viruses. Regardless I'd rather be safe than sorry.
,$ilver01,2007-08-13T13:02Z,This is full of ad & spyware. If you do install it just run spybot after and you will see what I mean. Total shit
,eNJay,2007-08-25T15:09Z,great job seeding :) thanks
,wfgovie,2007-09-27T16:40Z,To the faggots who like to post shit about virsuses EVERYONE LOOK AT THOSE USERS and LAUGH AT THE FUCKS FROM MICROSOFT and ESET trying to stop the download of my torrent. For the Record I'm about to release Nod v3 already broke the security too.. So this is my big fuck you to the lamers. This file is clean and fully working STILL! FTW and your moms.
,boydaplis,2007-09-28T19:06Z,wexzastor same problem here. i followed d simple instructions carefully but same result. i had to revert my drive to nod pre-installation time using goback just to make sure i got rid of all d bundled trojans viruses & all craps that wfgovie the asshole wants us to download
,dnp_ReleaseTeam,2007-09-29T08:53Z,more microsux ppl

,-siri-,2008-03-24T15:56Z,"WARNING!
This file is not good at all."
,Destructingvision,2008-04-06T08:26Z,This works for sure http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3971316/Nod_32_3.0.621.0_finally_cracked
,Neone,2008-04-15T02:48Z,"Didn't work for me. No .reg file in installed directory after running the fix. Followed instructions. Using Vista thou, maybe I'm still oversecured by all installed ""security"" systems?"
,bander49,2008-05-19T11:44Z,"I don't trust wfgovie, I don't even trust myself sometimes!
Am I beeing paranoid?"
