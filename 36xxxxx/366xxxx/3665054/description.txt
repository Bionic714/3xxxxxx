You know its awesome when you can be an Irish guy named Gren and uppercut a Chocobo in the beak. In addition to having the absolute best fighting system of its time, the absolute best grappling system, high resolution graphics, a constant 60fps clip and over 200 playable characters, Tobal 2 also incorporates a full-fledged RPG! Too bad few ever had the chance to play it since Tobal 2 was released in Japan and only in Japan. Regardless, the sheer depth, polish, fluidity, complexity and general awesomeness of this 3D fighter gone way too deep for its own good made it a classic, even if your neighbor doesnt even know what the hell it is.
