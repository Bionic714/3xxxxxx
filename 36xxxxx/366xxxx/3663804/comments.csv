,Shortcut_Keys,2007-04-16T23:21Z,Yep. It aired in Canada on CTV on Saturday night.
,plamib,2007-04-16T23:41Z,looks intresting
,savox,2007-04-26T07:12Z,Another FOX series: Yes it looks interesting but no use to make a commitment to a series that will be canceled within a season anyway. I bet Nathan Fillion will be the victim of yet another FOX cancel.
