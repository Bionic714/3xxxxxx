THX for the upload, but do you have the missing eps too?
Thank you in advance."
,tristanthorn,2007-04-21T23:12Z,"I'm trying to find the missing ones. I've found one (31), and once i have the other five I'll redo the torrent. If anyone has them, please let me know."
,Eimell,2007-05-11T17:23Z,You can find the missing episodes on #ila @ irc.rizon.net! And dont forget to !rules. RIVA rules with an iron fist! :)
,tristanthorn,2007-05-12T11:02Z,"I was under the impression that ILA had taken all their orguss eps down due to legal action, even on irc. Please help get them if they're not!"
,goodluckfox,2007-06-08T07:09Z,"Um, isn't this supposed to be subtitled?"
,goodluckfox,2007-06-08T07:34Z,"Ug, nevermind. It's softcoded subtitles. Had to press ""S"" in Media Player Classic and they came up fine. Duh."
,tristanthorn,2007-07-07T23:59Z,"eps 26-31 can be found on tokyotosho
