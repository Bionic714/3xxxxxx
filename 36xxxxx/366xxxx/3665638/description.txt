Gangbangin' Fo' Life

Gangbangin Fo' Life (GFL) is a collection of interviews of Los Angeles based gang members from various Bloods sets including the Blood Stone Pirus, Blood Stone Villians, 151 Pirus in Compton, Blood Stone Villians, 92 Bishops from Watts, Pueblo Bishops, Fruit Town Pirus in Compton, and Athens Park Bloods

The camera crew takes you to Compton and Watts where bangin' is a way of life. They show how pervasive crack cocaine is and you see how the drug is rocked up and how it is consumed. They show a couple of one-on-one fights that gang members often engage in to settle small disputes. They do several interviews with young gang members but they interview O/G Pop Lock Capone from Blood Stone Villian and O/G Bruce Dog from Fruit Town Piru.

Gang members talk about the escalating conflict between Mexicans and Blacks in Los Angeles, how they make money, why they started bangin' and how long they have been at it. The Original Valley Gangster Crips and Front Hood Crips are briefly featured in the mostly Blood documentary.
