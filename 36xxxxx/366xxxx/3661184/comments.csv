Or maybe I'm just missing them somewhere or a crack?  Either way, I put 'em to DVD to get off the HD, and it still asks me for 3 different keys :("
,Sasori,2007-05-27T14:25Z,"played this game alittle some years ago  think it was good :P will try it out again

Neverwinter nights 2 sucked tho worst gameplay ever :/"
,sorcgsdf,2007-08-21T12:12Z,"Yes i agree with goldanthrowolf it would be really good if you could just post the cdkeys as a commentary here or something like that^^

Sorry for my bad spelling"
,dax12,2007-09-18T01:10Z,Can't display the key's unless you do not want to play on-line only one key will work for multi-player if you had the game and registered on bioware's web site you can use the same keys
,kerin,2007-09-25T22:33Z,"I actually bought the game, I just managed to destroy my CDs way back in 2004.  :/

Quit your bitching and go buy it."
,thantik,2007-10-27T03:46Z,"I lost my CD's quite some time ago, just finished the download and it will not work unless you have the ""play cd"".  Any workaround for this?

The installation went perfectly, I had my own CD key from back when I had bought the game.  The 3rd CD key obtained from a tpb torrent didn't work (hence why I used my own)

Any help on making a 'play cd'?"
,thantik,2007-10-30T03:29Z,"Fixed issue with having to have ""play CD"" by doing the update.  Update errored but gave a link to a ""full patch"".

Update this to 1.68 and you can play without the ""play CD"""
,Methylene,2007-12-09T09:47Z,"Ha greedy people and their keys... Single Player in this game is okay if you like a real D&D feel, slow progression etc.

The multiplayer servers allow DMs to create a whole world and make specially scripted NPCs that can sell just about any aspect of a good character.  It's fun, and I agree with the rest of ya...

Quit yer' bitchin' and buy the game if you want to play it online... it's like the unsaid rule to multiplayer these days.

Thankfully I have an account and I can recall the keys off of Bioware's website... Mmmm good job Bioware."

,Roria,2011-07-14T22:13Z,"SEEEEEEEEED!
I don't need a CD key, all I lost was my disks.
But I do need someone, at least one person, to SEEEEEEEEED!"
