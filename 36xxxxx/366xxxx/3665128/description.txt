The forgotten Hendrix album, December 18, 2004
Reviewer: Darth Kommissar (Las Vegas, NV (USA))
Axis: Bold As Love (1968.) Jimi Hendrix Experience's second album. 

The Jimi Hendrix Experience took the world by storm with their 1967 debut, 
Are You Experienced. Hendrix had earlier worked as a session musician for 
artists like Little Richard, but it quickly became obvious that he now had the 
potental to become a rock legend in his own right. The hard-rocking 
psychedelia of his first album was something masterful in its own right, so it 
was only proper that the band release a follow-up album. And in 1968, Axis: 
Bold As Love was released. Read on for my review of Hendrix's sophomore 
effort. 

This album is another excellent release from Hendrix. It's not as good as Are 
You Experienced (in my opinion, anyway), but it's still a solid album as only 
Hendrix could put out. The album spawned Hendrix classics like Little Wing, If 
6 Was 9, and Castles Made Of Sand. It's not surprising that so many fans of 
his praise these songs - they're nothing short of excellent. But once again, 
Jimi manages to serve up more than just rockers that would become catchy 
hit singles. Spanish Castle Magic, You Got Me Floatin', and the title track go to 
show that an artist's hits are not necessarily their finest compositions. Even 
though Jimi's guitar playing is the highlight of this or any Jimi Hendrix 
recording, his backing musicians also do an excellent job. Another excellent 
thing about this recording is that it's not nearly as raw as the debut in terms 
of the tracks and production. Although I personally prefer the debut, Axis still 
stands as a solid album that blows away the work of many of the other artists 
of the day. 

The most common version of this album available in America (as of December 
17, 2004) is the remaster. These remasters are great because they improve 
the sound quality and even give us greatly expanded liner notes. 
Unfortunately, unlike the Are You Experienced reissue, this one doesn't 
feature any bonus tracks! Why not? Hendrix has a ton of rare and hard to 
find stuff that would have been great to use as bonus material. Oh, well. 

To put it simply, Axis is an album that every Jimi Hendrix fan needs to add to 
their collection. If you're new to Hendrix, though, start with a hits compilation 
or the Are You Experienced album. By listening to one of those first, you'll be 
able to appreciate the work on Axis all the more. Final verdict? Buy this 
album.
