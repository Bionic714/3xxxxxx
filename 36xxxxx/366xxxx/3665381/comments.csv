,lawson_jl,2007-06-19T00:04Z,Pretty funny.  Too bad it's says Ravenstake.com on the screen is big letters the whole time.  If you don't mind that then it's golden.
,Truvbay,2007-08-27T02:10Z,"Pure garbage. Not funny in the least. It really just isn't funny. Robot Chicken, South Park, these shows can be funny without high production values. Because they feature good writing.

This crap show has lousy production, and is just not funny. Thankfully, I DL'd just the first episode, so I didn't waste too much bandwidth."
,Pirate_Kings_Cometh,2008-03-25T08:36Z,seed for me if you re pirates
,smd999,2008-04-04T14:27Z,"Yeah, this show is pretty crap.  Glad I only downloaded the 1st episode (and couldn't even get through all of it).
Robot Chicken is way better."
,zombix12,2008-09-30T08:56Z,"It's not even Robot Chicken you tards. It's from the guys at ravenstake.com. They received a cease and desist from Hasbro because Hasbro got their panties in a bunch about their products being featured in an adult-oriented spoof.

FYI, this series is actually really funny. It's supposed to be stupid...that's what a spoof is."
,zombix12,2008-09-30T08:58Z,"Also, it's called GI Joe: The Epic Saga."
,walterfive,2008-10-22T00:26Z,"This is the stupidest f***ing piece of sh!t I've ever wasted my time on.

Zombix12? A ""spoof"" is not supposed to be stupid, it's supposed to be funny... stupid. Grab a f***in' dictionary, for crying out loud.

So the rest of you guys, don't take my word for it, waste your time on this piece of garbage, too. :-)"
,sniperman1,2009-08-03T15:41Z,"walterfive, read a dictionary?? You sound like the kind of person that needed to read ""The Joy of Sex"" to figure out if you liked it or not...."
,rrpostal,2010-12-21T18:04Z,"I don't think a ""spoof"" means it is supposed to be stupid necessarily. But humor (and butt humor, now that I think about it) is such a subjective thing. It's really hard to know whether or not I'd like this without watching it. I'll give it a shot I suppose."
