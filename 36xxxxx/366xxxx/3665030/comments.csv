,Aggroholic,2007-06-07T21:02Z,"Hey Dopeman
First of all thx for uploading this, with that said, i'm new to this, so be gentle :D
I got it down, unzipped it, and then when i open the ""setup.reg"" no ""program"" opened, instead a normal window opened with a yes no mesage about me wanting to add the information in C:\Shadow Wars\Setup.reg to the regestration database.
A part from that i tried to just open SpellForce 2.exe but the screen goes black, and the it enters in windows again...

Any suggestions??"
