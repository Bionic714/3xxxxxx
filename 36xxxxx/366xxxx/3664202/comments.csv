I thought it would be like ""Grass - War on Drugs"" but it's actualy interesting, talking more about the industrial uses for hemp rather then drug use. It's the best hemp documentary I've ever seen. The video quality was not the best though, but defenatly watchable.

Nice upload

And for those that want to see Hemp for Victory witch was mentioned near the end, it's public domain and can be downloaded from the following site:
