This is an interactive tour of the "Year Zero" web phenomenon surrounding Nine Inch Nails' album of the same name.  I have tried to replicate the puzzles involved in discovering the various websites as accurately as possible, without being too difficult to navigate.  This does NOT contain any of the leaked tracks or the album itself in any form; it is simply a guide to the world Reznor and company have created, downloadable in a form that is viewable offline.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.
