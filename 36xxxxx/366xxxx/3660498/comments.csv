,Morlok8k,2007-04-10T08:13Z,My Upload speed might be a little slow for a couple of days - sorry.
,Hexorius,2007-04-10T16:13Z,Thanks!
,chuck4,2007-04-10T17:14Z,"How do you get it in the Xbox 360?
Thank you for a great torrent!!"
,deadmikey,2007-04-10T17:16Z,Ye.. how does this work... do u burn them or what ?
,deadmikey,2007-04-10T17:36Z,Hmm... are the games FULL version or TRIAL ?
,Hexorius,2007-04-10T19:30Z,"I suspect trial since the notes for the torrent says: NOTE: ALL (or most - Not sure about Hexic HD and Totemball) OF THESE GAMES WILL SHOW UP AS A TRIAL GAME!!!,  if they got full functionality that would be great, but i doubt it."
,deadmikey,2007-04-10T21:38Z,Then i really dont see the point of this torrent.
,Morlok8k,2007-04-11T05:33Z,"you can burn them onto a DVD or CD (wont all fit on one)

or put them on directly on your HDD or mem card.

they will show up as trial unless you purchased them.

if you want full games, you should download the xbox live arcade unplugged vol 1 disk. (but thats only a few games.)  i might incorporate this disk into a future version.

the point of this is for people who don't have a hard drive (core edition) or want to save space on their HDD.

the readme.txt has more info.

I have Uploaded previous versions of this torrent (with less games)  the last one i did was 31 games.   this time i decided to zip each game so its easier to pick and choose, and simplify future versions of this torrent, as i wont change the current zip files."
,Morlok8k,2007-04-11T05:54Z,another reason for this torrent is for people who dont have Xbox Live (for whatever reason)
,KING91SIX,2007-04-14T20:25Z,"thanks alot, works just like you said its cool to have these games for the fun of it, works on usa, 51 games"
,shinnster,2007-04-20T17:24Z,"Cheers for thisdude, works like you said it would :-)
As for the people that can't see the point of it, it saves space on the hard drive that could be used for videos or other demo downloads.

thanks again Morlok8k"
,shinnster,2007-04-20T17:25Z,Should have really said this worked on my Pal machine :-)
,bladenr1,2007-04-25T17:08Z,Do u have 2 unzip them or what.
,bladenr1,2007-04-25T18:10Z,"i cant find the 31 games in here.

,Jackass Jimm,2007-05-23T03:26Z,"So now that the BAN hammer has been brought down on people...I am thinking...

Can I 
1. purchase XBLA games through online website on my pc (xbox.com).

2. put these games into my xbox 360

3. the purchased game (from xbox.com) can then be played in a nontrial version (COMPLETE)?


???  Anyone know????  Anyone care to find out?

,Fanciful,2007-09-16T20:58Z,"There is no ""banhammer"" for this type of thing. That's strictly for Halo 2."
,stratman71,2008-02-12T23:27Z,XBLA games (even these demo's) are always welcome!  Those of us who are banned and cant even download the demo's can always use these.
,FreeNLegal,2008-03-03T07:56Z,http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4059390/LiveArcade.rar   I made 2 disc with all 118 game bionic isnt a game
,reizo7,2008-03-24T14:00Z,Anyone knows where I am able to obtain Assault Heroes full version? This is an excellent game and unfortunately I have a modded xbox360 so I'm not taking chances to log into Xbox Live to download the full version.
,chupo28,2008-05-18T22:24Z,"Is there any way to unlock these games without being connected to Live?
Anyway, this is is a great torrent. Thanks for uploading."
,demonicmetal,2008-08-03T15:04Z,"it's a graet torrent

i had alraedy downloaded it on my xboxs

thanx "
,Jackass Jimm,2008-08-26T04:56Z,"Now that I think about it, it is kind of dumb what I said back in 2007.  Even if you were able to buy the game online (which you can't unless it is a game that you can buy a prepaid code for), you'll still need to go online at least once to so the full retail version is unlocked on your console.

I also don't want to go online with my console since it is modded BUT still has full warranty (sent it in to MS and they fixed my modded console and sent it back to me with a brand new warranty sticker :) ).

,joeyumyum,2008-08-29T21:30Z,"@Jackass Jimm

How did you get Microsoft to repair your modded console?? I mean what kind of modding did you use?? did you just flash the DVD-Rom firmware??

Thanks"
