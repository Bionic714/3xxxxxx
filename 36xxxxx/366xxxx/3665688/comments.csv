,neorip,2007-12-24T15:28Z,"thanks for this, but a word of caution: you are using a very similar drive to the one I am using, and NECs are notoriously unreliable when it comes to accurate ripping. even in secure mode, the drive will return a rip without reporting any errors, but there will be a CRC discrepancy with the AccurateRip database.

for the most accurate rips, you should use the latest version of EAC with AccurateRip. good luck."
,neorip,2007-12-24T15:30Z,"sorry, I made an error above. what I meant to say was, ""even in secure mode, SOMETIMES the drive will return a rip ... etc."""
