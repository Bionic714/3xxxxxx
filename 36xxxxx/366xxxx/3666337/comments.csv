,Raging_Bull63,2008-07-05T21:18Z,"It's a waste of time trying to download this torrent, the same with Subspecies 4. No one is seeding those torrents.
I'd been stuck at 99,8% for months. Finaly downloaded an other torrent with both Subspecies 2 and 4 (AVI-files).
I'm seeding all the Subspecies movies since March 2008 (when I'm downloading torrents). It's better than nothing for these hard-to-get movies.

Subspecies 2 and 4 (AVI-files): http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3842899/Subspecies_2__amp__4

,techken,2008-11-27T19:57Z,Could someone PLEASE seed this? There are a whole bunch of us stuck at 99.5%. There has GOT to be someone out there with the dvdr version of this movie!
