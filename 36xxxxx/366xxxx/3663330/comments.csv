,busta69873,2008-04-06T04:10Z,"Hasn't worked for me yet, but the audacity way off downloading works fairly well. Plus it's probably a bit more legal :up:"
,VoodooRoller,2008-04-19T23:41Z,"Just get SoundTap (crack available on TPB), it will record audio straight from the soundcard, thus being able to 'download' music from MySpace."
,AnarchyOnline77,2008-05-05T02:53Z,"It works. Only simpletons can't figure it out. If you have any trouble just click the help button. Basically all you have to do is enter the MySpace ID of what band you want to download, play and download."
