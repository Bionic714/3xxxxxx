,DannOrly,2007-04-13T04:37Z,"Sorry guys, not a PS2 emulator. Mislabeled that.

It works by either using an ISO file of a PS1 game or having the PS1 game in the CD-Rom and running it through that.

55wow, uhh, read the title again."
,anol18,2007-04-13T20:35Z,"Prefer to play PS1 games on my old PS1 =).
Why do I have one of those anyway? I don't use it!"

,tonto23,2008-01-10T07:43Z,"Hi, I've unpacked epsxe. Could you please tell me what I do with each of the files within? I'm a novice with all this. Thanks for uploading :)"
,tonto23,2008-01-10T07:46Z,ggpp you're a fucking tosser
,eventariku,2008-02-25T20:02Z,Wear is the game ?
,DannOrly,2008-02-26T21:23Z,What do you mean exactly? You open the emulator (the .exe file) and use it to open the games (the .rom files) and thats that
,DannOrly,2008-02-26T21:24Z,"er wait. scratch that, wrong file i uploaded LOL

this is just an emulator, you have to download your own playstation games or if you pop a playstation game into your computer you can play it on there."
,DannOrly,2008-04-23T00:16Z,"For the record, HMT doesn't own anything nowadays.

Carry on."
,mew4mikkel,2008-06-01T12:42Z,"Hey.. Great download.. But I've got a little problem.. A ps CD-Rom game, Digimon World.. When i run this game, it's like it's in super high speed.. Everything is going to quick, and this makes the game very hard to play..

What can I do to make it run in normal speed?"
,Amberrrr,2008-11-13T01:38Z,This is the best comment spot ever...You guys are hilarious. I guess I'll give this emu a try :-( None seem to work all that well.
