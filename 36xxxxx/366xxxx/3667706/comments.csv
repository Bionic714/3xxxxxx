,Oblivion_4,2007-04-20T00:21Z,"this works great I was able to install the program using the serial key and Anitivir didn't find any viruses, unfortunatley I had to uninstall my anitvir to fully complete the installation, but otherwise it works great! Lol now I am going to have to get more ram, because this program is taking up so around 100mbs(estimate) of my system memory"
,downerasd,2007-04-24T21:52Z,lol it detects the zip file with this download as a virus just because its a keygen inside :P
,Jokks,2007-04-29T13:01Z,Is t safe to register? Or could you get caught?
,Soduka,2007-04-30T06:00Z,">.<

That's all I have to say to the above comment."
,mikegarston,2007-06-16T14:58Z,Install instructions are incorrect (asks for serial code at start of installation) and prog is an update version and once installed requires registration by submitting an email address for previously registered version
,johnarsenault17,2007-06-22T01:34Z,"it says that keygen.exe is password protected, what is the password?"
,halocog,2007-11-18T22:18Z,"great torrent, but one small fixable flaw.

the keygen works but has spyware. 

the ironic thing is, trend micro actually notices and
removes it so its ok lol"
,Riddick84,2007-12-07T10:13Z,When does this expire?
,Riddick84,2007-12-07T10:20Z,I only get like three months why is that?
[T],ooStevo,2008-01-18T01:00Z,"its because there are loads of people using the same keygens.u get somethung like 3 comps to register your copy of trend micro.each time you do it,ur time goes down(or something like that!)"
