,Lashmush,2007-04-26T17:30Z,"sypper: because rared files are used if one or more of them are broken when an SFV check is done. that way when giant ISO files and such are involved, it is easy to pick up the missing data and complete the download. this is however not necessary for modern bittorrent clients as they chop up the download in packets so if one is broken, its deleted and redownloaded. however, for reseeding on P2P clients like Direct Connect programs, RARing is essential for maximum user comfort when dowloading, both in file integrity and in optimizing download speed. One big file from one user wont ever go as fast as 50 smaller ones from 4-5 users at any given time.

Thats your answer. Now shut up and enjoy the beautiful electronic art this nice guy is seeding."

Besides, I don't remember .jpeg commonly beeing files too large to send over directconnect without loosing packets? :)"
,sho666,2008-07-25T15:15Z,"dunno about you but when it comes to picture's ect id prefer to get the same quality and quantity in one .rar file (or even split) at say 50 megs than un-rared as you wanted at possibly 100- 120mb

it means less seeding less downloading and more other shit i can download"
