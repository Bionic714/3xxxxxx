,hauntedtapedeck,2008-02-02T12:01Z,"Great documentary, but the source material is pretty horrible."
,hauntedtapedeck,2008-02-02T12:02Z,"Just to clarify, by ""source"" I don't mean the subject matter, rather the recording this has been capped from: washed out, poor quality, wrong ratio."

,octopus44,2010-03-19T17:12Z,Great (but depressing) documentary. Unfortunately the video quality is pretty bad. 
,netrek,2010-08-07T06:42Z,Some of you talk as if you expected this to be in 1080p HD or something! Hello people this was shot nearly 40 years ago and recorded onto crappy magnetic tape that was way below film quality.
