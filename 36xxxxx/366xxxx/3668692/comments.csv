,Ezerbeth,2007-04-20T22:28Z,"Kuthumi.. hence why the link does not work.. it's not listed there. 

See http://www.amazon.com/Close-Encounters-Proof-Alien-Contact/dp/B00004WMFS

This was a TV special released to DVD in april 2000."
,stardude,2007-04-21T04:05Z,"ffs...the clip they said was filmed in Sweden and which they say shows a ""beam ship"" or ""mother ship"" is a frigging boat!

Check the clip and you'll see that it's filmed from atop a cliff looking down at the water and the boat."
