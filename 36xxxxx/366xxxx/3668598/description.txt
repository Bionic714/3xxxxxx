You don't see games like The Italian Job every day. The game itself isn't particularly extraordinary--it's a lighthearted mission-based driving game that takes you through the streets of London, to Turin, and finally to the Swiss Alps. Of further note, it's brought to you by the makers of the notoriously gory Carmageddon series (no signs of any gore here, though), it's based on a 1969 heist film starring Michael Caine and the late Benny Hill, and it was originally released some months ago for the Sony PlayStation. Actually, the PC version of The Italian Job shows its roots in all these respects, and despite some rough edges, it makes for a fun ride that justifies the budget price.
Help Charlie Croker steal a cool 4 mil from under the Mob's nose.
The Italian Job stars cockney wise guy Charlie Croker, who is fresh out of prison and is already looking to get into more trouble--trouble, in the form of $4 million that the Mafia already has its eyes on. The plan is to cause a major pileup in the streets of Turin and make off with the loot while the authorities and the Mob are scrambling to figure out what happened. In the game, you'll take on 16 different missions, first gearing up for the heist, then pulling it off, and then getting away scot-free. Along the way, you'll get to drive eight different vehicles, including everything from a nimble Mini Cooper to a bus filled with explosives. The missions are all short, but they'll often require you to try them a number of times before you get them right. This isn't really frustrating, because the missions are quite fun, requiring you to pull off some outrageous driving moves in densely packed urban settings, and failing a mission never sets you back more than a few minutes.
