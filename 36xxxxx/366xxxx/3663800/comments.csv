the file I found and am uploading right now seems to have some (very) minor blocking artifacts (block like fuzziness) during playback - 

maybe
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3663812/Mythbusters_S04E07_DSR_XviD-WPi_-_CT_-
woud be worth to heck out as well.

They just put their file up when I did and they seem to have a fast upload.

I will check that out as soon as I finished uploading this to a sufficient audience ...

Greetings

it' the same episode - but without blocking artifacts and even the last 30 sec (final talk between Jamie and Adam) that this file is missing.

I'm sorry to have distributed this, but it was the only one that I had found until that time of starting it.

Sorry for the inconvinience - I hope I can do it better next time ...."
