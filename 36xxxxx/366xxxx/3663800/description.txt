Hi there!

I've been looking for this several days but it did't show up on bittorrents ...

So I took action, "organized" it - and now try to upload it ....



Please be patient: it's my first upload and the first time I'm seeding original data into bittorent-network at all.

I'll use superseeding but I only have a very small DSL-upload connection.

So please be patient and enjoy the newest Mythbusters episode as quick as I can supply it ;)
