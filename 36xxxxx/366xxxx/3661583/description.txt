Plot:	A band of young warriors from different areas join forces to save a kidnapped bride and destroy the powerful white-haired witch who has vowed to bring about the clan's destruction.

Overview:	The Bride With White Hair II picks up where the first one began, with the solitary hero ChoYi-hang (Leslie Cheung) atop a snow-covered mountain. He's been waiting ten years for a magic flower to bloom that will restore his true love Lien Ni-chang (Brigitte Lin) to sanity. Meanwhile, Ni-Chang has assembled an army of psychotic, man-hating women, and with them and her lethal white hair she's been cutting a swathe through the 8 clans (and if you're already confused, go check out The Bride With White Hair first). Yi-Hang's nephew Kit is set to marry his sweetheart Lyre, but on their wedding night they are attacked by Li-chang, who takes Lyre back to her mountain hideout. Kit gathers the youngest heroes of the 8 clans to resuce Lyre, who is being indoctrinated with rituals, drugs, and radical feminist theory. Despite a heroic effort it all proves to be for naught, forcing Kit to seek out his uncle for help. When this too fails, Kit falls back on the old adage that "there are very few personal problems which can't be solved with a suitable application of high explosives."
