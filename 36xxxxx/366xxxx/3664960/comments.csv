,AIMBOT,2007-04-27T18:54Z,"I've got VLC 0.8.6b and K-lite 2.01 installed but it doesn't work good: all stop and go,  JERKY video. Sound is really good though compared to OTA program..."
,Cucamonga,2007-05-01T04:08Z,"Uninstall your codec pack, restart your computer and install the most recent FULL pack of KL Codec. Try the Classic Media Player instead VLC player. CMP comes with KL codec pack. 

The video is fine. Try the player and tell me.

Good luck."
,JThrawn2000,2007-06-25T00:11Z,Shit codec... i dont use fucking crap MS OS... why fix something that aint broken? If you cant play it in VLC keep it!
,modrak1,2007-08-18T14:40Z,"The video codec used on this one is VP7 from On2 Technologies, not playable anywhere else than Windows. So yeah, fuck you, whoever put his time into making a crap like this.

Again, this will NOT PLAY on MacOS X or Linux. Idiot!"
,Cucamonga,2007-09-10T01:48Z,"As you are so polite, I can tell FUCK YOU TOO, IDIOTS. If VP2 only works in Windows this is your problem, not mine. There are other versions of House here. Go get it and don't bother me."
