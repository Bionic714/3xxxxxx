,heeman1119,2007-05-27T19:52Z,Alrigt nice torrent! but do you have an advice so the shit dosen't give failures from windows in it?
,pixie1966,2007-07-08T16:16Z,"Actually mestrec, when I downloaded this the last time there were no problem with not being able to load saved games... Sadly the only thing I could suggest would be to download the game again."
,pixie1966,2007-07-08T16:26Z,"Frankly I never had one single problem with this download. And you don't need any other programs to make the game run. Just run it like you usually would.

Although I'm sure 18july already got his answer somewhere else, I'm gonna answer it anway. To download this you need a program like uTorrent or Azureus, which is specifically made to download and upload torrents.
Once you have it, you just need to push the ""Download this torrent"" button."

the only thing you have to do is
create a directory in the game directory named
random_maps
then it shuld work!"

,GustavHansen,2008-06-08T00:55Z,"It playes perfect for the first ten minutes, but then suddenly it shuts down because windows finds an arror? What shall I do? "
,hansen333,2008-10-15T19:51Z,can more ppl seed? Plz!:)
,SlimT,2009-02-10T02:11Z,"to reinstall the game, just delete the whole map with the game in it, the map you downloaded, and probably, maybe moved to programs map, but if you dont know anything about that, you havent moved the map =P oh and then you download it all again =P hahaha but i think its the only way, but its very much seed anyway =)


---------

if you can't save or the game shuts down, try goggling the errors message youre getting, that is if you are getting any.... else i donno what to do"
,SlimT,2009-02-10T02:20Z,"i recommend you to move the the map with the game to (Drive):\Program or (Drive):\Program Files, the one that is your default ofc. eeh, with (Drive) i meant like C:\ or D:\, whatever your drive has for letter, most people would want it on C:\.... ow, crap my comments get a bit of a mess... =( and if it doesnt work, maybe you should try downloading it somewhere else... =)"
