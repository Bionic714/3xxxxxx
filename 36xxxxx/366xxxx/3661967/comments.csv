,milsorgen,2008-03-28T03:31Z,"Yeah I know stuff isn't tagged right and what have you, I started collecting Nickatina back when Napster was still kicking, alot of stuff just wasn't available in stores. It's gotten better now and I'm trying to get the older stuff updated and recoded. I'll upload an HQ collection when it comes together!"
