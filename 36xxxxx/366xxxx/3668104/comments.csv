,evilal,2007-04-21T23:03Z,Same as the other i guess. First the intro sequence and then just a black screen and a application error.
,GeneralBleak,2007-04-22T07:08Z,Not meant for WindowsXP. However you should download this. Not for the game but for the awesome videos that are on the image. Actors in space marine suits for the win.
,ZuBRich,2007-04-22T13:34Z,Use VMware for this game (Create Virtual Computer - then install win 95\98\ME on it - then use this ISO)
,evilal,2007-04-23T14:12Z,Oohhhh..
,all1abuut,2008-12-13T10:57Z,"Hi - 

Is there any way to get this game to run on Vista without having to install a virtual computer?  I don't have an old Windows disc andd am desperate to try this game."
