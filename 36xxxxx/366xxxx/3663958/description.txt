Album Description
Favourite Worst Nightmare is everything you hoped Arctic Monkeys would do next. Not so much a sequel as an upgrade, a breakneck technicolour journey through screwball punk and guitar-fuelled dancefloor heroics, it's very, very fast and very, very loud; a brilliant racket that proves there's infinitely more to Arctic Monkeys than
writing pretty little ditties, yet at the same time boasting some of the strongest
songs they've ever written.
