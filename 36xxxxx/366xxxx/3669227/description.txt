Plot:	The fists and cards really fly in "Notorious Eight" as hero Chen Kuan Tai takes on villain Lo Lieh in a poker standoff, proving once again that "flushing" out the bad guys makes great box office sense!

Overview:	Old style kung fu films always had brothel, restaurant, and of course gambling scenes. Gambling films became popular in the early 80s, so it made sense to have an intense poker game standoff between early good guy, kung fu star Chen Kuan Tai, and early villain, kung fu star Lo Lieh. The fists and cards really fly in "Notorious Eight" as Chen proves once again that "flushing" out the bad guys makes great box office sense.
