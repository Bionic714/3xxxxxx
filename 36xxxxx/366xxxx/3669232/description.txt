When Shao Hai finds that he has killed a member of his own family on behalf of Tsoi, he realigns himself with the Ming cause. The grandfather, knowing that Shao Hai is no match for Tsoi, teaches him the Five Elements Buddhist Palm so that he canmatch Tsoi blow-for-blow. After defeating the best of Tsoi's men, the young avenger must face the might of the Buddhist Fist in an epic showdown from which only one will emerge.
