Merry christmas."

PhXAnarchy, why would you come into a thread sharing a file of which you are so repulsed. Those who want the file will download and those, who are mature & not f*ked mentally like yourself, will bypass like so many files that don't call to them.
I wouldn't go into a thread sharing a Brit Spears file because I have no interest in her. So why would I bother even to comment on that thread.
It shows not only your immaturity and your twisted head that you would not only comment once, but indulge in a running commentary about your feelings on the matter.
It amazes me the number of immature and idiotic souls unashamed to let the internet community know how out-of-focus they are. Simply amazing.
Here's an idea: when you see a file you don't stroll on by and focus on what interests you and allow those who want the file to discuss it positiely amongst themselves. Your critiques matters not except to say to others the degree of rudeness, ineptitude when it comes to matters you KNOW nothing. Nothing."
