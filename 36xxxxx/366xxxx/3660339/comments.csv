,johnnyfacker2,2007-06-24T18:20Z,"Thanks, works on vista 64!"
,Robin_1987,2007-07-01T19:50Z,"When I'm trying to enter the activation key that the keygen gave me, the ""OK"" button is greyed out and I can't click on it.
Does anyone know how to fix this?"
,hessajee,2007-07-02T06:20Z,"Hi.

Just to let you know, this program works perfectly with the keygen provided.

Robin_1987 - You may not have copied the full code from the Keygen into the appropriate area, thus resulting in the OK button not being active. Ensure you copy the whole code and paste the whole code, and the OK button should become active immediately, and then you can press OK. The software will now be registered.

Thanks uploader!"
,Robin_1987,2007-07-07T18:33Z,I got it to work now! Must have done something wrong the first time.
,privatepastry,2007-07-30T18:51Z,"I'm having the same problem that Robin_1987 was having.  I copy the full code and paste the full code in the box and the ""Ok"" button is still unclickable.  Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?"
,privatepastry,2007-07-30T19:03Z,"Nevermind my last comment, I downloaded another CD key and it worked fine."
