,Throwed,2007-04-20T18:46Z,I just joined this place. It seems alot of people here refuse to seed for some reason. I have been stuck at 95 percent for the last 12 hours. Seeding is not that hard.

We know where you are you wanker... your IP address is 87.117.251.66

I very seriously suspect this wanker is working for the enemy... trying to keep users connected as long as possible to collect copyright infringement evidence for prosecution. "
,deadrising2day,2007-04-21T02:51Z,"It's good quality, but it just shows the same 10 second clip over and over. It's like a preview or something. Not worth anything"
,h4ns0l0,2007-04-21T03:05Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD!
Made to appear somewhat authentic but in the end it's a fake."
,beardown50,2007-04-21T03:15Z,Thanks guys when its a fake......its a fake
,chevelletm,2007-04-21T03:23Z,"to farscape256

Should I be worried some anti-piracy group will be contacting my ISP?"
,farscape256,2007-04-21T03:32Z,Just as I thought CD1 is nothing more than the sample plus padding.... What a friggin' wanker. He'd better get another isp and ip address and move is all I gotta say...
,farscape256,2007-04-21T03:43Z,"Just install peer guardian 2 and you can watch the stupid wankers attempting to connect ... hahaha. If you don't have PG2 then you can expect a letter to your service provider in the near future as I logged quite a few failed connection attempts from MPAA and its cohorts... like this wanker. Getting paid to upload crap and collect ip addresses... Hope you got mine you prick, cause I sure got yours and your port access... "
,farscape256,2007-04-21T04:02Z,"Just contact his ISP [which I listed above] and report this wanker for distributing copyrighted material... give the the exact name of the file, its exact size and the dates of infringement occurred from 04-18 and ongoing.  Oh yeah don't forget to mention the IP address as this will totally isolate  him from any other user.... and demand that he erase the file and cease and desist..."
,farscape256,2007-04-21T04:06Z,I suggest the rest of you downloaders should eradicate these files and disassociate it with your bit torrent client... otherwise you are waltzing into the pack of wolves with your eyes wide open... don't say I didn't warn you.
,chevelletm,2007-04-21T04:18Z,Wahoo! I'm guessing it was not a good idea to complete the entire file with no protection! :D
,farscape256,2007-04-21T04:23Z,If your ISP issues an email about this file and illegal downloading... Vehemently deny any knowledge of such activity and declare that someone must be stealing your wireless bandwidth [this has been the only legit defense so far...]
,subecku,2007-04-21T15:40Z,Big brother muthr fcker needs to find something better to do
,chynawhite,2007-04-21T18:41Z,bad file do not download the smple is the only good thing and it takes three day to download wow you suck
,farscape256,2007-04-22T10:56Z,I can't believe so many people are continuing to seed this crap... and someone even gave it 4 stars. How stupid can you get! THE FILE IS NO GOOD AND IT'S BEING MONITORED BY ANTI-PIRACY GROUPS.
,necrocide,2008-08-19T20:16Z,Nice what software you using to track ip data farscape?
