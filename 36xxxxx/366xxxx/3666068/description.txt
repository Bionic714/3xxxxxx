About the Game:

The year is 2456 A.D. and Alien elite forces have invaded our space colonies.
In a bold offensive move, the intergalactic military defense fleet tried to defeat
them but was completely wiped out.Now the alien threat is about to strike planet
Earth itself!, Is all mankind lost?

Hell no! As the STORM ANGEL, the most powerful ship ever designed, 
is ready to be unleashed on our enemies! But a great ship requires a
great pilot and it's up to YOU to save the human race!



*Release Note:

*Now these arcade type games have recently made a reappearance, 
*especially with the release of R-Type Final due that year.
*Storm Angel however is slightly different from these retro arcade games, 
*it?s still a frantic blaster though, with you piloting a space ship attempting 
*to save the universe from hostile aliens that attack in waves of varying ships, 
*with a end of level boss every once in a while.
