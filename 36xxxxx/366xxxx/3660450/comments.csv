Why?
Well: vlc-0.9.0-svn-20070407-0001-win32.exe
is the latest bleeding edge nightly trunk unfinished
 so called alpha build of the next versionn of Vlc...
And this is info obtained from the developer part of Vlc´s own website....
There´s no such thing as a Vlc 1.o.o beta yet, there´s even no such thing as Vlc 0.9 betas yet, just alphas....
So probably some kind of fake, or joke or...
Wanna get Vlc?
For own piece of mind:
It´s free open source software so why download a suspicious version of it from any other place than the official website?
It´located at
http://www.videolan.org 
and if you for some reason wanna try not yet finished nightly builds you can find them there to if browsing around a while in the developer section"
