In 1997, neoprogressive rockers John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater joined with keyboardist Jordan Rudess and veteran bass master Tony Levin to create an adventurous and joyously unrestrained musical environment. On volume 2, surging technical brilliance is abundant--and as provocative as it is impressive. These tracks were largely the result of extemporaneous jamming; each piece comes across as a finely crafted and flawlessly executed composition. Also striking are the enjoyably drastic changes of style. "When the Water Breaks" and "Another Dimension" are eclectic journeys, happily unpredictable. Quieter, more atmospheric moments unfold in tracks such as "Hourglass" and "Chewbacca." Petrucci, Portnoy, and Rudess effortlessly master intricately explosive rhythms and unleash astounding solos. Levin displays his wonderful eccentricities, particularly on the playfully wicked grooves of "914" and "Liquid Dreams."
