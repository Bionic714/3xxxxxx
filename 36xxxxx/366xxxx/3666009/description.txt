This is a Lecture Given by Stanley Meyer at the 1993 International Symposium on New Energy in Colorado.

He spends the first 30 mins or so giving background information on the development of the Water Fuel Cell, including, but not limited to such topics as: Oil Company's, CFR, NWO.

The last hour is spent giving a technical description on the operation of the Water Fuel Cell. Unfortunately due to time constraints, he was unable to finish the full Lecture.

This is a must for everyone interested in learning about Stanley Meyers Water Fuel Cell Technology, especially for those people trying to develope there own WFC based on his Technology,but are constantly hindered by the mis-information crowd out and about on the Internet.

As they say: "Straight from the Horses Mouth"
