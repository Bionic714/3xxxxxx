,vanio_inn,2007-04-18T17:31Z,I uploaded this torrent because it works not because it is tiny.If you check for other 3d desktops for XP like Madotate (works also with windows 9X and 2000 free here: http://www.softlookup.com/display.asp?id=26041) you'll see that thay also are very small.
,WiNsUrFeR,2007-04-18T19:37Z,Works Well !!! Thanks vanio_inn
,vitorvious,2007-04-19T10:45Z,for you any noobs that dont know this is a 3d form of alt tabbing and it works wonderfully.
