Alright, I made this myself, and it took forever to do. It's set to use the Vista explorer.exe, but it didn't work so well in tests I did, so you might want to use Litestep (it has a menu to let you pick the shell).

This torrent contains a file named VistaPE.ISO. You need a CD burning program, such as Nero, to OPEN this file (not burn to a disc, but OPEN it). If you simply burn this file to a disc, it WILL NOT WORK. You must OPEN the file in a burning program, and THEN burn it.
