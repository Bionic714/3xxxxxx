The game was made by the former lead programmer of Microsoft Flight Simulator. At its launch, the game's all-digital soundtrack, great frame rates, external environments, and ability to fly through tunnels and into underground caverns set it apart from the rest of its genre.

Terminal Velocity was released as both a floppy disk and a CD-ROM version. The CD-ROM version improved upon the floppy version with 70 MB of extended pre-rendered 3D cut scenes, higher image resolution (including more detailed textures) and support for 8-player network multiplay. As of 2006, 3D Realms sells the game on CD-ROM only.

Terminal Reality also developed another extremely similar game, Fury3, published that same year by Microsoft. It used the same game engine and basic game mechanics, but was designed to run natively on the new Windows 95 operating system. It was considered a weaker game than Terminal Velocity, but Fury3 spawned an add-on pack F-Zone as well as a sequel, Microsoft Hellbender.

Warning: Will not run under Windows XP. Try DOSBox.
