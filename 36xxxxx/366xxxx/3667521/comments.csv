,petewills,2011-07-23T18:11Z,"If you're still reading.  Great download, works brilliantly in DosBOX .74, hidden Planet and everything.

The included 7 shareware programs (plus the TV shareware version) bring back memories.
(ROTT, Wolfenstein3D, Blake Stone, Wacky Wheels, Raptor, Hocus Pocus, Duke Nukem II,
in case anyone wants to know).

I've tried demos of Fury3 and Hellbender and thought they were awful. TV rocks!

Had to reactivate my account to post this.  Thanks.............

Could someone please explain how to utilize these files?  I have XP, got dosbox, got WinRar and extracted the first rar files, but I'm not sure what to do next."
,forkinyou,2012-04-19T03:56Z,"Okay, so after using WinRar to extract the files from part1, I mounted the bigger sx-terminal_velocity.mdf file with DAEMON Tools Lite, went into it and clicked on INSTALL.EXE.  There, it showed me some games to choose from.  I installed TV.  Then, I went and installed and ran DosBox, mounted the C drive, guided myself to the TV installation, and tried to run TV.EXE.  It said I had to do the Set-up first, so I ran SETUP.EXE and it started asking me about my soundcard, which I think is Vinyl 97, or something.  Oh girl, now what?"
,forkinyou,2012-04-19T04:49Z,"...Tried the different soundcard drivers they had to choose from, except for the SoundBlaster stuff as it started asking me about HEX and I haven't a clue.  So ultimately, I appear to have the game running, but no sound."
