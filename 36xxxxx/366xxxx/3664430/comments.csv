,>VSP<,2007-04-15T15:34Z,"Wait a minute, its doesn't load guys, can somebody help me..?

The scenery is installed but if i load FS9, im standing on the grass....... "
,Sky-bird,2007-04-15T15:43Z,"Did you choose for the option to write it in your Scenery.cfg.

Else go to Settings --> Scene Libery --> Add xxx

Select the map then, i would advice to reinstall and tune the option to write it to you Scenery.cfg

Mind this scenery upped here is only for FS2004 / FS9. For FS-X press on the link above.

Goodluck"
