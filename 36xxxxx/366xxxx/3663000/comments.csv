,DrPhishHat,2008-11-14T23:14Z,"Ok, i unzipped and tried both TOED.exe and Freedom.exe and what happens is screen goes blank. i can hear ""EA Games, challenge evrything"" and then it just stays blank and nothing else happens, anybody have any idea what's going on?

Note: i tried this a while back and i got the same thing, and when i quit i got nero telling me its missing advrcntr2.dll. i fixed the whole nero thing now and i got another game working that wasnt working because of the same problem (shogun: total war) i dont get the message anymore but thought i'd mention it incase it helps

Thanks"

,neokyja13,2009-03-15T18:22Z,i had the black screen problem also but i had read in another torrent that if you go to the movies file and delete them it fixes it and guess what it worked so just delete the 2 movies there and start. it should work just fine.
,neokyja13,2009-03-15T18:23Z,is it supposed to run really fast.  like the person is in a dead sprint and all the enemies are just as fast how can you fix this?

,ixXbeefXxi,2010-01-22T08:25Z,Wow thanks man works mint. unzipped the files with winrar and clicked on freedom and was perfect. Been my favourite game since it came out :))
,gregg2110,2010-02-25T15:59Z,For those of you having the problem with the black screen and EA Logo;- Go to freedom figther folder and change 'Movies' folder to 'Movies 2'. 
,wil2k,2010-05-08T20:17Z,"Thanks for the virus, you faggot. 
Toed.exe tried to open itself with a virus called ""runtime pack upack"""
,asimbiju,2010-06-06T11:46Z,It has a virus...  Toed.exe  
,louist44,2011-02-27T07:15Z,"Never played this before and heard great things about it so decided to try it.

Seems to be working perfectly, noticed a few sounds out of sync and the odd bug (guessing its down to the game being old rather than the torrent)

Great torrent, great file, easy to run. highlight all the rars and extract then run the exe is all

no virus (toed.exe was removed after i extracted the files and game runs fine) but im sure it is safe
vista home premium 32bit"
,ejyas,2011-03-31T15:43Z,THIS TORRENT INCLUDES A VIRUS IN THE .EXE NAMED TOED.EXE AND YOU JUST DELETE IT AND EVERYTHING IS OK! OR U CAN JUST NOT DOWNLOAD IT FOR YOUR SAFETY!
,GarwinPasseleur,2011-05-09T15:31Z,"It is running really fast on my computer, I mean the gameplay.. How can I fix this? anwser please!"
