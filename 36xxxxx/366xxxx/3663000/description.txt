About:

Take to the streets of New York City and fight for your freedom!

In a world where the Soviet Union won the Cold War, a fierce 
conflict is unfolding in the streets of America. Taking on the 
role of Christopher Stone, players evolve from an average 
New Yorker into a fearless patriot who recruits and leads an 
army of freedom fighters in the streets of New York City. 
Freedom Fighters? combines the depth of a squad-based 
game with the intensity of an action-packed war game that 
unfolds in the streets, subways, and buildings of the city.
