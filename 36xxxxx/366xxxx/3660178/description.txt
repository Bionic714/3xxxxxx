PhotoZoom Pro (formerly known as S-Spline Pro) is based on S-Spline XL, a renewed and improved version of our patented self-adjusting, many times awarded S-Spline interpolation technology. As we did with S-Spline, our S-Spline XL technology again introduces a revolutionary breakthrough in digital image enlargement. It is able to render sharp and crisp clear image magnifications perfectly focused, yet without the jagged edges, loss of detail, or lack of photorealism that normally come with enlarging images. 

Many professionals are familiar with the problem; quality loss caused by digital image magnification. In many cases a great deal of time is spent on achieving only a fairly acceptable enlargement result, however there are familiar side effects including out-of-focus images and serrated edges which is illustrative for the lack of professional magnification software. 

The software is perfectly suited for digital photography, large printing, DTP, web design and online publishing, but also for industrial image processing such as space technology, security, medical, and forensic applications.
