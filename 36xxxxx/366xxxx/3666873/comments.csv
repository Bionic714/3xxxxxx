,Iceburgslim,2007-05-06T03:42Z,What is that Toed.exe?  I let it run for a few minutes and it's just a screen saver type thing.
[V],Subzero!,2007-05-09T00:02Z,this is an intro you should always start otherwise your registry entries wont  be written correctly and you can be sure the game doesnt start correctly nor will crash sooner or later!. you can also use it as screensafer... if you wish... but i wouldnt!...
