Warblade 

From Norway comes an outstanding 2D shooter...
Warblade, presenting the simple goal of using your CryTech Delta Fighter
to eradicate all the aliens in sight. To upgrade, you collect bonus items
dropped by certain aliens when they are destroyed. 
This offering contains 100 levels, and every fourth level there is a
shop where you can buy ship upgrades, power-ups, or new weapons.
You have at your disposal both single-player and two-player modes 
(two players either take turns to play or compete for the most points), 
as well as a time trial mode (where you have three minutes to get the
highest score). Two sub-games appear inside Warblade: Memory Station, 
where you match tiles with the aim of increasing the total grid size and your
bonus points; and Meteor Storm, where you navigate through a field of floating
rocks and can pick up extra bonus points and extra cash from bonus items. 
There are four levels of difficulty, lots of user-controllable options, and wonderful
visuals and sound.
