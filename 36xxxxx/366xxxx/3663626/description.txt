DarkBASIC - The Ultimate 3D Games Creator


DarkBASIC allows you to create your own games, demos, slideshows, even business applications using the easy to understand BASIC programming language. Even if you\'ve never coded before, just follow the in-depth tutorials and you\'ll be generating results in minutes! Harness the power of Direct X and make 3D objects come to life in just a few simple commands.



What Makes DarkBASIC So Special?

For the first time ever, the power of the PC and Microsoft\'s game engine Direct X can now be controlled by everyday PC users. It\'s no longer the sole domain of the expert \'C\' programmer. Anyone with a PC can now make 3D objects move around the screen interacting with other game objects and taking live responses from the game player\'s inputs.
 


WHY CLASSIC WHEN PRO IS AVAILABLE?

1. Because you can find that 80% of online resources & tutorials available are made for DarkBASIC Classic. There\'s not Much (FREE) help & resource available for the PRO version.
2. There are differences in commands of both languages. So if you find a good source and try to run it on DBPro you\'ll get an error if the commands are not supported.

SO IT SHOULD BE THE BEST CHOICE FOR BEGINNER GAME PROGRAMMER
