"In the Closet" is a song by American pop and R&B singer Michael Jackson from 
his 1991 album Dangerous. The song became that album's second number one R&B 
single and its third top ten pop single, hitting number six on the Billboard 
Hot 100. 
 
Song information 
 
The song, written by Jackson and Teddy Riley, is about keeping a relationship 
between secret lovers. The video, directed by Herb Ritts, features Jackson 
dancing suggestively with model Naomi Campbell. The song's female vocal was 
originally labeled "Mystery Girl" but was later revealed to be Princess 
St phanie of Monaco, though the vocal was originally meant for Madonna. 
 
The song, with its heavy industrial sounding percussion and uptempo arrangement, 
is typical of producer Teddy Riley's New Jack Swing style. The unique, 
Eastern-influenced backing vocals, sexually-charged lyrics, and crescendoing 
middle eight imbue the song with an erotic edge usually missing from Jackson's 
music. His vocals are whispered and subdued for most of the song, embellished 
with gasps and shudders. Only in the chorus is his typically soulful falsetto 
given free reign. 
 
In keeping with the trend in the early 1990s, several remixes were commissioned by Jackson and released on a maxi-CD. The most prolific of these remixes was "The Promise" remix by UK DJ Frankie Knuckles, which made its way into the club circuit.
