                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following their ancestors' foosteps

Between 1914 and 1918, when Canada was scarcely more than a British colony, 
and less than eight million people, she dispatched an army overseas of 325,000 
soldiers and nurses. The chance of returning home unscathed was one of three. 
In short,two thirds of our army was killed or wounded, with 60,000 dead on the 
battlefield. A generation was annihilated.   Across the country, stories of 
bravery, close calls, broken hearts and patriotism have been passed down from 
generation to generation.

In 2005, CBC-TV and Galafilm put out a call to descendants of Canadian First 
World War soldiers to participate in the living history component of the Great 
War project. Over 6,500 Canadians applied and 150 made the final cut to take 
part in vivid battle recreations, and to experience what their ancestors went 
through in the killing grounds of Europe. Of the 150, 14 descendants were 
chosen for a special mission?to travel to the battlefields of England, France 
and Belgium where their ancestors fought and sometimes gave their lives.

In documentary style, THE GREAT WAR follows the 14 young men and women?
representing a cross-section of Canada?as they voyage through time to 
understand their ancestors? experience as soldiers and nurses at the front. 
Viewers will watch as the great-grandchildren relive the horror of that time 
and how they are transformed by it.

THE GREAT WAR also dramatizes the poignant stories of the war?s greatest heroes 
for Canada: Talbot Mercer Papineau (played by Justin Trudeau), who died a hero 
at Passchendaele, one of the deadliest battles of the war for Canada; Chaplain 
Canon Scott (played by Michael Rudder), who had to bury his own son killed in 
battle; Ernest Lamarche (played by Maxime Cournoyer), who fought with the Van 
Doos, the only French speaking regiment in the British army.

The epic battle re-enactments of THE GREAT WAR, filmed in rural Quebec, would 
never have happened without the participation of the 150 descendants. As with 
real war, the young volunteers lived in an encampment and marched into the 
trenches to fight the battles their ancestors fought. Their living history 
experience brings to life the five major Canadian battles of the war: St. 
Julien, Beaumont-Hamel, Courcelette, Vimy and Passchaendale.

THE GREAT WAR is a new concept in historical storytelling. It weaves together 
a tapestry of perspectives, and will give audiences a deeper sense of this 
defining event in Canada?s past.
