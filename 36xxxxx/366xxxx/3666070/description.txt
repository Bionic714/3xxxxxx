About the Game:

    The sky is blackened by dark clouds and planet Earth is 
    nearing its sad end. Human, a creature so inventive, has 
    already tried all the possibilities to avoid his doom. 
    Unsuccessfully. Only one way still remains - a time tunnel
    leading back to the year 1958. Contingent, the new world's
    government, didn't hesitate and jumps into the tunnel with
    a great army to fight against their own ancestors. Gain the
    planet at any cost. The primacy of the contingent's modern
    units is extensive but the situation changes rapidly and
