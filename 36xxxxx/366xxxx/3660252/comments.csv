Run -> cmd , cd to the directory with the .zip files then at the command prompt:  
""C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe"" e *.zip *.ttf  
This will pull all the font files out into the same directory."
,jimonastick,2007-04-11T05:15Z,"good upload, some interesting fonts, although it will take forever to go through. Glad you uploaded though, or else i would have to go through and download all 500 one-by-one"

,KiSCiX,2007-04-21T05:38Z,"Nice upload.

A lot of fonts. It has a lot of other file types too, if you want to clear your dir, just sort it by .tff then delete the rest.

Thanks for the upload, fast seeding."
