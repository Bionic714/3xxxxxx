,cwid99,2007-12-26T20:24Z,seed plz!!
,Dennizzzzz,2008-02-26T20:15Z,I don't understand a thing... it's so messy.
,zeinabqureshi,2008-02-27T08:31Z,"I just needed one book from the torrent. Was pleased when I saw it, but I'm not going to download 850 MB for that single book.
Very bad idea making a zip out of so many books. I don't understand what's the damn advantage.
A good collection, though... must be very useful to those who program in all three languages (very rare to find such a creature)."
,krankelibrankelfnatt,2008-03-23T13:13Z,"Hey! the .chm files doesn't work for me. I can open them but where the page (any page, I've checked) should be there is just a the-page-could-not-be-found-page. The pages are visible in the chapter browser to the left. Does anybody else got this problem or is it just me? And what can I do about it? 

Thanks for a otherwise great upload!! :)"
,DarkCrow,2008-04-19T22:02Z,"Sorry, but I am just fed up of people complaining about my uploads... Too large files. This one has been split up from a larger collection, as have many of my uploads. I admit though that the text is messy, but hey, many don't even provide any text to their torrents. I just want to share my books, and it seems that I cannot please everybody.. If you like what you see, please download, if you don't like what you see... Well, don't download it.. I've tried to split up my collection, but people what maybe one or two books, and thats simply too much work for me. Sorry but thats the way it's gonna be.. I've uploaded a one large collection, and then uploaded the collection in smaller chunks.. That's all I am willing to do for now.."
,urbaneve,2008-04-27T01:45Z,"actually if you use a program called ABC Amber CHM Converter -- it will convert your chm files to whatever you want  (i usually use the PDF choice)

p.s.  nice collection of books"

,magus1011,2010-03-17T00:30Z,"@DarkCrow Abe Lincoln said it best: You can please some of the people all of the time. You can please all of the people some of the time. But you can't please all of the people all of the time.

Ignore the morons that don't like what you do and continue to do what you like. Thank you for the upload even though I only wanted two of the books. Perhaps I'll get around to reading some of the others and learn something new.
