Overview:	The Bride With White Hair tells the story, in flashback, of swordsmaster Yi-hang (Leslie Cheung). Raised from an early age to assume leadership of the Chung Yuan, a coalition of eight martial arts clans, Yi-hang displays little interest in fufilling this role. Despite this, he is called upon to lead the forces of the eight clans against the depredations of a murderous death cult. In doing so, he crosses paths with a beautiful, nameless assassin swathed in white (Brigitte Lin) who weilds a deadly whip in the service of the cult. Despite their opposing backgrounds, the two fall in love, and Yi-hang gives her the name of Lien Ni-chang. Sadly, this happiness cannot last, for the monsterous Chi Wu-shuang, leader of the death cult, also lusts after Ni-Chang. Her attempt to leave the cult sets a series of events in motion that climaxes in tragedy, bloodshed, and madness.
