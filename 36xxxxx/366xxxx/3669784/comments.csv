,morph3x,2007-04-24T09:44Z,I think its better to use psx version and emulator. It works 100% and graphic is better then in PC version where is crappy resolution and u cant change it

,richhie,2008-01-17T06:57Z,it does work on XP there is a patch out there google FF8 sqeapatch and download that and install it after installing FF8 I got an error when I installed it and used a patch to fix it and you don't need DOSbox to run it on XP it was made for WinME so because WinME and WinXP use the same hard drive format it can be run on XP so no worries just download the patch and use it so now I can finally play some good ol' Final Fantasy VIII
