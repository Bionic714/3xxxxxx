,tekz73,2007-04-19T19:26Z,"aye - it's much appreciated - but did you seed to a small number of peers first, or, as I suspect, is everyone of the 70 or so connects I see all trying to grab at your bandwidth? "
,*Criminal*,2007-04-19T19:53Z,Yeah you're right i didn't seed to a small number of peers first. But don't worry i will seed as long as it takes :) just be patient. 
,tekz73,2007-04-20T01:00Z,"works for me, no worries dude, and cheers"
,petterhot,2007-05-07T00:21Z,Oh thanks! I seed so much i can! Thanks a lot!
,tekz73,2007-05-08T12:51Z,"FYI - there's no use clicking on this - its been going for about 3 weeks now and nobody has more than 45%. Im sorry *Criminal*, but this really has been seeded badly"
,*Criminal*,2007-05-09T09:41Z,"Yeah i'm sorry you feel that way, but it took me a very long time to get all these episodes and now i'm giving them to you in one package. Just because it's slow doesn't mean that it's not gonna finish eventually. 

tekz73 you can cancel the download and come back when i have a few seeders. And BTW FYI i didn't have to release this so maybe i won't be releasing the third season."
,tekz73,2007-05-10T11:51Z,"If you want to throw your teddy out the pram just because I've questioned your seeding policy, that's entirely your perogative. Alternatively, you could take it as it was intended, constructive commentary, and use it as a learning curve. I think the fact that you've been seeding for a month now and nobody has more than 50% is a sign that it could've been done better. You still get full marks for making this available."
,cal_singh,2007-05-12T00:20Z,"Yeah, it has taken quite some time now, but at least it's moving forward :-) Thanks for keeping it up.
Let's hope it's worth the wait. Looking forward to season 3 when it's time for that..."
,RADHAZ73,2007-05-18T18:31Z,Do ratios even count on this site? I'd have to say that the only reason uploading is so slow it to get  a good ratio. Please just leave it running to 100%.
,cal_singh,2007-05-22T21:32Z,"Finally :) After 27 days 24/7, and a ratio of more than 20...
Will seed for a while, though."
,petterhot,2007-06-23T22:54Z,"Yep, its done here, a bit time ago, but anyway :p
This series is great. But why its take so long time to get the episodes? Looking for the 3th season. Thanks!"
,Psychomania,2008-01-22T00:24Z,gr8 uploads criminal thnx...do you have any more seasons of it?
,anujpathania,2008-03-02T15:37Z,"Man where is the season 3!!! 

Hey Criminal upload Season 3.

You Rock!!!"
,mshariff,2008-04-21T14:02Z,"Criminal, Could you please upload the next season. This is a great show but not too many torrents on this. Would be great if you could upload.

Thanks a million"
,captainwest,2008-07-08T12:31Z,"Thanks a lot criminal, When you go to the effort of uploading your torrents to the Torrent Community they can seem to be a very ungrateful bunch. Indeed some of them are. Most of the people out there are only Leechers & have no appreciation for the time, effort & indeed risk that we go to too upload something to them.
So thanks for your efforts even though I have not yet even started the download of your 2 My Family torrents I for one appreciate your efforts.
To all those of you who are still keen to get more seasons of this great show there is a site called  which has at least 6 Seasons of the show there, but be warned they police the site vigilantly [regarding upload ratio's etc etc ]. Here is the link to the correct page at the box, however it may not open to you until you have managed to attain a membership & I am not recommending those torrents at thebox.bz, I am just making you all aware that they are there. http://www.thebox.bz/browse.php?nonboolean=0&search=Zoe+Wanamaker&page=1"
,elextro,2008-08-28T19:53Z,"Looking forward to watching these but please upload Season 3 if you get hold of it :)

Thanks dude."
,Ane13,2008-12-31T11:10Z,"It's sloow, I'm going away in two days to a place with no internett, can U plz seed faster?
