Lyrics and composition 
 
The songs starts with a prelude of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D Minor 
performed by the Cleveland Orchestra. The lyrics depict the general struggle 
of living, but in the context of Jackson's life, one might presume they focus 
on fame and the burden that it brings: "But they told me a man should be 
faithful and walk when unable and fight til the end, but I'm only human."

and Jackson's performance of the song at MTV's 10th anniversary show in 1991.

"Will You Be There" won the MTV Movie Awards for "Best Song in a Movie" in 1994.
