,kylesbeaver,2007-04-25T04:29Z,Excellent music...but please somebody seed!
,kylesbeaver,2007-04-25T05:12Z,Excellent!  Thanks so much!
,chalkitdown,2007-08-06T00:59Z,"Great soundtrack, however, the opening theme tune(from episode Two onwards)  is nowhere to be found on the soundtrack, which is just......odd. You'd think would be the first thing they'd include."
,DLDS,2007-08-13T15:34Z,"The titles seem to match the Jeff Lindsays second book ""Darkly devoted Dexter"" not the tv series."
,DLDS,2007-08-13T15:39Z,"""Dearly Devoted Dexter"" of course "
,candy87,2007-10-13T18:07Z,"The opening theme is found here:

,Docoptik,2008-06-02T14:30Z,"Thanx, but i agree with chalkitdown.

,weasel5i2,2008-09-30T04:29Z,"Why are the torrent versions missing tracks 23-25? I know that tracks 26-30 are iTunes exclusives (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4410967/Dexter_Soundtrack_Bonus_Tracks) but these OST torrents seem to be missing those three tracks.. Are they also only available through other channels? Just curious, trying to track them down (no pun intended)"
,weasel5i2,2008-09-30T04:31Z,"Nevermind, I found a torrent which appears to include those 3 missing tracks! ^_^
