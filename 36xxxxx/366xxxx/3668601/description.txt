Ace Combat 2 is an action packed flight action/simulator game that allows a player to take control of some of the most powerful military jets in the world. One of them is the F-14, but Stealth Bombers are sure to please as well. When it comes to graphics, Namco has gone for a complete overhaul over the predecessor. Ace Combat 2 possesses some of the cleanest polygons ever to grace the PlayStation. This game possesses fully rendered levels ranging from submarine infested oceans, to anti-aircraft plastered canyon trenches. Namco promises that flight physics are true to the sky and the enemy AI has been tuned to a new a level.
