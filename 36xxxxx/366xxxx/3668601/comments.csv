como eu gravo esse arquivo para jogar no psx?"
,HEXiFY,2007-08-22T02:44Z,"jardelmandel: You need to burn it as a bootable image disc. You can use UltraISO for this. To be able to play it on a PSX console, you'll need to have a modchip installed on your console. Or, you can just play it with an emulator."
,gnom3,2008-04-30T18:30Z,19.5MB for a psx game? seems too good to be true..

 Unpacked this file is it's nearly 600 mb."

,petar4o0o94,2011-10-08T20:17Z,"The torrent is ok!
It works if you mount the file with PS1 Emulator (PERFECT)   you can google it its downloadable.

But there are a few bugs in the game:
1.Several misssions are missing
2.There is no music and audio from rocket lock
3.There is no mission choose option when u pass the game"
