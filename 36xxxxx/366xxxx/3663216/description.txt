OK Here is a very rare treat for all fans of the comic genius
that was Bill Hicks. I got this from a friend of Bills and
never thought about ripping and posting it, mainly due to
the fact that its filmed from the back of the club on a tripod.

There isn't any zooming in or out, its just stationary and
is shot over peoples heads. The occasional waitress walks by
serving drinks etc. But the sound is excellent and even though
its not digital quality. I think its still a cool thing to have,
especially considering that out of the 34 full video shows(bootlegs)
i know exist the only ones to have surfaced are the ones i originally
ripped over 4 years ago. So be warned...this is for fans only.
I just thought that some people would want it, i know i would.

Nothing else to say but enjoy!
