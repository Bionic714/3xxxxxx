,SPARTACVS,2007-04-19T16:08Z,"Some people actually like the original full 720p video on their computer to use in a home theater. Not everyone is content with some 360p, artifacty, 350mb piece of shit, dumbass."
,Metsy,2007-04-19T17:31Z,Is there something wrong at my end or is this missing the subwoofer-track? I'm only getting 5.0 sound.
,Undersky,2007-04-19T18:20Z,Since I got my HDTV I can't watch the 300 mb versions anymore =) 720p and x264 ftw!
,barryco,2007-04-20T22:41Z,The bigger the better in my opinion.  But this version is out of sinc - loads of lip syn probs at start.  Where is CTU they usually have the best - with ABC LOGO on screen NOT CTV
,barryco,2007-04-20T22:42Z,Go for the one on search that's by TFF its in sync but has a slight pixelation when BROTHER is loading the 4x4 with booze - shame!
