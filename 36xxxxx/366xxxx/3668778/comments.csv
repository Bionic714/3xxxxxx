This is because the release provided here is an rpm (red hat based) build. You'd have to go through some unnecessary converting in order to install an rpm on Ubuntu (which is Debian based) :P

For future reference, if you run a debian based system, you want to look for .deb files. If you run a red hat based system, you want to look for .rpm files."
