This is one of the DVDs with every episode ever made (except for the first three KTMA episodes of which no fan copy is known to exist)

Codec is DivX. The size of each episode is between 600~700 MB.

Each DVD comes with a nice high-res cover:        

Warning! Under New Management!

Since the other guy that was doing these is having computer problems, I thought I would give it a shot. This is in no way meant as disrespect to him, I just loved what he was doing by making these episodes available and I want to try to continue this to honor what he has done.

I have made a few changes though:

1. Most episodes from now on will be wide-screen with a slightly smaller file size.

2. I have tried to make the covers a little more accurate by using the correct fonts that I purchased just for this project. They will be closer to the individual Rhino release covers.

3. I am going to try to work out a way to make each season fit onto four discs, so the seasons will not be split between discs. (I do not know if this will work or not)if it does it might end up being less than 35 discs!

Let me know what you think hopefully I have done an adequate job.

ENJOY! ----Dave Servo
