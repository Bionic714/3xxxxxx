,Dave Servo,2007-04-19T07:52Z,"I've got some bad source material, and I hate black bars on my wide-screen t.v.! So, {lousy source + big size = so-so picture quality}, just a warning people, so don't judge too harshly, its my first attempt after all. Oh and thanks for the blessing kshipper, its good to know the lack of sleep from encoding episodes is appreciated :P"

,Bowch,2007-04-22T11:43Z,"My eternal thanks.

I've got a load of episodes spread about in a very higgledy-piggledy manner.

UMe2's releases came along and I thought ""excellent, can get as complete a set as possible, and in order"".

Nice to see somebody take up the reins and provide us with some more of this great show.

Once again, thank you, thank you, thank you..."
,jas722,2007-04-24T18:07Z,"Thanks for this. Could someone upload the Special features soon ? I think its dvd 34 and 35.

Thanks"
,nemuitomato,2007-04-25T12:39Z,"Will these also be in the same video format as UME2's? His all played correctly on my stand alone DIVX DVD player.

Thanks for doing the uploading!"
,mad_bunny,2007-04-28T03:09Z,Black bars be damned!  Kudos for the upload!
,Dave Servo,2007-04-28T06:26Z,"Thanks for the kind words folks, the next volume will be ready verrrrrry soon. This volume will have 7 episodes, the next will also have 7 and then 6 each after that! This means a season will fit nicely on 4 discs! Oh by the way, this next volume will be the start of disc labels too! It will have a label for 9 and 10! Yeah, I know, calm down, you're welcome :P"
,Dave Servo,2007-04-28T07:01Z,"Okay MSTies, the next one is ready! http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3675040/MST3K_-_Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_-_DVD_10_of_35-ish"
,woodpusher69,2007-04-30T03:08Z,Nice covers but episodes are only 350-650MB. I was hoping for better resolution. Sacrificing file size to fit a DVD isn't what I'd think UMe2 was thinking when he started this collection. I only put mine out to fill the gap until he comes back. As his quality is better than mine. Nice first try with this but remember...Gamera is friend to all children.:o)
,peanutbutterjedi,2007-09-24T07:58Z,thanks for these! i've been looking for the MST3K eps for years...you're a gem
