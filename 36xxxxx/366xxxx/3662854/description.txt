Neoclassical Compilation Vol. 3

The Genealogy of Metal

Metal as a musical and social phenomena arose out of the uncertainty and dischord of the cold war period. A time when, if you weren't looking over your shoulder for signs of an impending nuclear strike, you were getting on with a life that was growing increasingly isolated and increasingly meaningless. People, particularly the youth, lost faith in western politics and gave up on the naivety of its decrepit religions. The future looked bleak and metal echoed the hopelessness people felt.

As the cold war capitulated at the turn of the 1990's metal peaked as an artform, going into a frenzy of idealism, fatalism and fury that resulted in countless acts of violence and it's most clear artistic statements to date.

Burzum represented the outermost reaches of what metal could achieve and, in effect, transcended metal by staking its presence outside of the soulless rotten world that metal had hitherto been a reaction towards.

We now look back through time tracing the lineage of Burzum and of metal music through Western European Folk, Classical, Medieval, Hardcore Punk, Industrial and many more musical forms.
