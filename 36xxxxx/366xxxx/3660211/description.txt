Gregory Boehnlein, et. al.
How the ILECs Have F**ked Up the ISP Industry

Synopsis

An hour long rant about anti-competitive practices by ILECS and RBOCS in the ISP industry and how this has totally screwed the end-user and turned what should be $8 / month DSL into a $50 / month profit whore for Ma-Bell. A dissection of why the entire Telcom Deregulation act of 1996 was a complete fraud. Anger. Frustration. Hatred. Death!
