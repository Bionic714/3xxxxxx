POINTLESS..."
,opposite,2007-04-10T22:13Z,Seems like a cool movie... lets just hope it's as good as the trailer says!
,merkery,2007-04-25T20:58Z,"yeah this is definitely not worth downloading. really dodgy colour that you can't sort out with saturation/contrast, awful cougher/popcorn eating bastard and the focus thing (which I thought was what it was supposed to be for about 15mins until it happened every scene!)

not only that but the first 45 mins of it didnt grab me. I wont give up and will get a dvdrip give it a fair chance..."
