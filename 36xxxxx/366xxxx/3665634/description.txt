One of the greatest sagas in movie history continues! In this thrid film epic Corleone trilogy, Al Pacino reprises the role of powerful family leader Micheal Corleone. Now in his sixties, Micheal is dominated by two passions: freeing his family from crime and finding a suitable sucessor. That sucessor could be fiery Vincent (Andy Garcia), but he may also be the spark that turns Michael's hopes of business legitimacy into an inferno of mob violence. Francis Ford Coppola directs Pacino, Gracia, Diana Keaton, Talia Shire, Eli Wallach, Sofia Coppola, Joe Mantegna and others in this final chapter of the Godfather saga that masterfully explores the themes of power, tradition, revenge and love.
