Overview:	In "Lion Vs. Lion", a teacher comes across a secret list of anti-Ching rebel names and quickly becomes a target for Ching loyalists.

The amazing lion dance sequences alone give this film major historical significance where it's the first time Northern and Southern lion dancing skills are compared.
