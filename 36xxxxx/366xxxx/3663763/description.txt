The original title of this documentary is : "Heavy Watergate : The War Against Cold Fusion".

On March 23rd 1989, two respected chemists makes an announcement that rocks the world of science. Heavy water, readily available in the oceans, is used in tabletop experiments that yield enormous amounts of heat energy.

Appropriately named "cold fusion", this purported breakthrough challenges many basic scientific concepts. 

In response, the gatekeepers of "official science", heavily reliant upon government funding for their hot fusion research, level an unprecedented smear campaign against the entire field of cold fusion science. 

Was their discovery of "fire from water" too good to be true ?. Or was it the discovery of the millennium ?.
