About:

Futuristic real-time strategy game based on a *Movie* of the same name. 
The game is premised on a conflict between a human group (NORAD) 
and a group of mechanized warriors (WOPR). 

The single player game offers two campaigns consisting of 15 missions, 
one for each of the two sides. There is also a good multi-player mode 
for games via modem or serial connection, LAN or on-line.
