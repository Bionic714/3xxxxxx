,silentthunder,2007-04-22T02:00Z,any1 know how 2 get this 2 work in windows xp?
,IcySon55,2007-04-22T09:20Z,"How to get Hellbender running in XP:

1. Find the demo version online. (3DGamers etc)
2. Install the demo.
3. Create a new folder manually for the full version.
4. Check the files the demo has installed.
5. Copy the same files from the CD to the folder you created. (The full version files are missing an ""X"" in every filename, it is normal.)
6. Set the properties for the copied Hellbender.exe to ""Windows 98 Compatibility"" and turn on ""Disable andvanced text services.""
7. Play the game!

From what I tested, I believe you should keep the demo installed so that CD music will work properly in the full version.

Hope this works for you, it worked for me, tell me if it doesn't."

,al1984,2008-01-17T13:49Z,thanks
,daveone983,2009-01-03T09:40Z,"I would LOVE to know exactly where the ""CD"" comes from if we are downloading the file from you. The demo is impossible to install on my comp for the same reason I can't run the full version."

,jimbails,2009-02-05T17:17Z,Does this work for Vista too?
,gostkillr,2009-03-26T23:20Z,"I can't get it to work on Vista, even trying to run it in compatibility mode (ok, that thing is a joke but it might have worked) for Windows 95.  Anyone have any tips?"
,gostkillr,2009-03-26T23:23Z,"holy crap, i did it, when you mount the cd image you right click on the cd, click explore and run hellbender.exe not setup.exe or auto.exe, worked for me!"
,IcySon55,2010-02-01T23:48Z,"For everyone having trouble. If you are running any version of Windows that is 64 bit, this game will never run as 64 bit Windows does not support running 16 bit applications which Hellbender is one of."
,Thirras,2010-12-26T17:12Z,"Exactly ! It worked with me too, just mount the image and run the HELLBEND file inside it. Worked fine, doesnÂ´t need even to install. Muito Obrigado."
,Thirras,2010-12-26T17:14Z,Worked fine with me too ! Just mount the image and run the hellbend file inside it. Muito Obrigado !
