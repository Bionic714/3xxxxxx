,JBNyen,2008-11-25T12:17Z,"""Two or three of the major STDs have come from animals,"" says Alonso Aguirre, a veterinarian and vice president for conservation medicine at Wildlife Trust. ""We know, for example, that gonorrhea came from cattle to humans. Syphilis also came to humans from cattle or sheep many centuries ago, possibly sexually."" The most recent, as well as the deadliest, STD to migrate to humans is HIV, which hunters acquired from the blood of chimpanzees, says Aguirre. The disease became transmissible from one person to another through semen and other bodily fluids after it had spread to the human population."
