this is such an excellent flick! The original version, not the new one.
Ripped from original VHS, I do not have the DVD.. would love it though!
encoded on XVID. divx was horrible on this probably because of the soft VHS.

***
I have a slow UL rate, but will keep it seeded for 'awhile'!
(please contact me if you have the real DVD, or even the NEW masterpiece-theatre version!)

*go read the book too!*
