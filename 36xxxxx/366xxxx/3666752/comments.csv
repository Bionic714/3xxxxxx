Cracked?? PLEASE ADVICE....."
,sayres,2007-04-29T07:27Z,"Terminal Services is a suite that allows you to remote into the computer running is using Remote Connection and work off of it as though you were sitting at the computer.  It's a really cool thing.  There's more to it than that, but that's the most visible piece of it."

I have an Server 2003 RC2 (german) which looks totally different than this release here. The one I have consists out of 5 CD's, and has everythink right were it belongs in Windows.

With this release here however I cant even find where to configure the network, like local IP, Gateway etc...
In addition it doesn't recognize any CD other than the Installation CD itself. Not even the Mainboard Driver CD.

Is there anything I have to unlock first to get it to work properly? Its kind of useless the way it is now..."
,coolboi,2009-01-03T15:45Z,"hi, unfortunately your windows doesnt work on Compaq Presario CQ40-107AU.

What should I do? Or can you direct me to one that will work on CQ40-107AU? 

Thanks"
,how_weird,2009-01-03T22:27Z,"Coolboi, 0x0000007b is a SATA driver error. you need to download the SATA driver for that machine, put them on a floppy and when you are installing windows hit f6 (if i remember right) when it asks if you would liek to install any third party driver (I.E. raid, SATA, ect) it should be the first thing you see when installing. after that it should work fine"

,zappaz123,2012-02-07T23:47Z,"The install CD1 has the filename : CRMEVOL_EN.ISO - this is the CD LABEL name of the volume license version.

And when You mount the .ISO (with deamon or similar) You get the CD LABEL name: CRMEEVL in explorer, which is an evaluation version.

so mr. ""bearsoft"" - You apparently knew what the correct CD Label for the VOL version was, and gave the .ISO file of a EVAL version this name, in the hope that it by magic would turn into a VOL.

how bout rename yourself to ""Monkeysoft"""
