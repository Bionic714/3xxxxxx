Overview:	Lo Wei remains internationally famous for directing Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan's first major movies. Cheng Pei-Pei is now internationally famous for her superlative villainous role in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". But both were superstars in Hong Kong for decades prior, so any teaming of the superlative "swordswoman supreme" and the vaunted director/writer/actor is cause for celebration.
