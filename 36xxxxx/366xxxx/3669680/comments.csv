You need a torrent downloader..something like bitTorrent.  That will download the files onto your computer ( usually as an .rar file).  Use Winrar to unzip them and you should have a .nds file.  Put that onto your R4 disk and it should work."

,AnastasiaScreamed,2008-11-24T02:52Z,"Hey guys you need to down load a free emulator off PB or a place like Romulation. Search-HANDHELD EMULATOR PACK > off of Pirate Bay and DL it to your desktop and open it(unpack files here) with WinZip,Winrar or 7z. you can play most DS games right on your computer, rather than busting your ass trying to convert it to your actual DS! The file above comes with a GBA Emulator as well as the DS Emulator and both have a few cool games in the folder. The Folder has everything you need except you need to get the rom for Mario Luigi Partners in Time>YOU CAN Get this at ROMULATION as a free download.Hope this helps you guys."
