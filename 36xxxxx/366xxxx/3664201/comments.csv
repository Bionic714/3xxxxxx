I don't know about the rest of the community, but I am contributing a good 40KB of my neighbor's bandwidth to the revival of this torrent. IMHO it would be in the best interest of these trackers to enact a ratio system so that leechers are denied the last few chunks of their download until such ratio is satisfied. This is pathetic, people. If you can download it, you can share it. Don't cut the rest of us short on grounds of your greed. SEED.

By the way, if you haven't already seen Sweeney Todd... you MUST indulge in the wonders of Tim Burton.

My 2 cents. Take it and SEED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
