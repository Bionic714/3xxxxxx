Overview:	For 3000 years, the flying deity Na Cha has been a household name in China; and, while there have been other adaptations, this version is remembered the most fondly. Reincarnated, his spirit embodied in a lotus flower, Na Cha is armed with the Fire Point Lance and Wind Fire Wheel to save the people from their despotic emperor. Or, as a Shaw homage website said: "Lots of crazy action and some comedy make this a must-see for true fans."
