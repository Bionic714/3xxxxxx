This documentary about a female-to-male transsexual who is dying of ovarian cancer caused a sensation at this year's Sundance festival.

Robert was born female and Lola was born male. Transgendered, they fall in love. Set in the backwoods of Georgia, SOUTHERN COMFORT tells the real-life story of Robert Eads, a warm and gregarious cowboy who as a woman married and raised two sons, then transitioned to living as a man. Fifteen years later Kate Davis follows Robert during the extraordinary last year of his life as he copes with ovarian cancer (after 20 doctors have refused him medical treatment) and falls headlong into a passionate romance with Lola, a transgendered male-to-female. It's a world of contradictions in which good old boys who drive pick-up trucks and shoot the breeze around the barbecue are also 21st century pioneers - courageously forging a new world for themselves, and for us.
