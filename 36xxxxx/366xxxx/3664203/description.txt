Fear of a Blank Planet is an upcoming studio album by
British progressive rock band Porcupine Tree. It is their
ninth studio album. All of the tracks (except "Way Out Of
Here") were debuted live during Porcupine Tree's
promotional tour for the Arriving Somewhere DVD from
September to November 2006. The album will be released on
the 16th April 2007 in the UK and Europe, and the 24th
April in the USA. The album tracks flow into each other,
forming one 50-minute piece. On the 12th January 2007 page
of his journal, Robert Fripp mentions that one of the
songs recorded is called "Nil Recurring", which is not
included on the album but will likely be released as a
bonus track in a special edition, as Porcupine Tree
outtakes generally are.

On February 21st, a preview was posted on the band's
MySpace page, which contains samples of each track. The
title track of the album was released on March 6th in the
US iTunes Store as a bonus track with the album Blackfield
II.

Also, a dedicated mini-site is being developed. Currently,
it contains a stream of the album preview and various
downloads including wallpapers, banners and icons.

Since 31st March, all the tracks have been available on
the internet but only as radio rips.

Though receiving no public mention, the album's title
bears a striking similarity to the Public Enemy album,
Fear of a Black Planet and the Third Eye Foundation single
Fear of a Whack Planet.
