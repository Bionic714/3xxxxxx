,KÃ¥ggel,2007-05-25T14:07Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!
The ""winzix"" is nothing but adware, the file you're downloading aren't at all compressed. They've just changed to "".zix.""
If you install it you will have ""invisible"" running programs, 5 pop-up ads a day and the program will delete complete folders etc.
For more information visit www.wikipedia.org/wiki/winzix"
,KÃ¥ggel,2007-05-25T14:08Z,"(""winzix"" format is hidden inside the rar-files instead of other compilations)"
