i download this file thinking that what the other guys said was just newbie alerts (sorry guys)

this malicious code give me a lot of work to remove.

if some1 download this file and infect your own machine accidentally, try to delete c:\windows\svchost.exe. It is renamed copy of the virus created by itself.
Note that the original svchost.exe file is located at c:\windows\system32 folder, not just at the windows folder.

the problem is that there r many svchost.exe process running at the same time on the machine, and NO ONE is the virus (don't try to ctrl+alt+del them).
The virus runs injected in the explorer.exe and iexplore.exe processes, so you have to kill them both before delete the virus file.

in the registry it is installed in a subkey inside ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components""


see ya. and stop sharing this file."
