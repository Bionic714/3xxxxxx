,Kapusky,2008-11-12T23:01Z,"Please seed. I used to have this game before my old pc got trashed. I have 50kB/s up, so i'll gladly seed after and when the seeds get too low. (My overall ratio is 1.4 and over 194 GB total up over 63 days)"
,Kapusky,2008-11-13T14:59Z,"Lol, what I am trying to say through that random BS is that I will seed. ^.^"
,metallium,2009-01-30T20:36Z,"sorry, but can somebody help seeding the torrent??
tnx"
,IcySon55,2010-02-01T23:44Z,"I'm trying to recover the files in this torrent to continue seeding it for a long time. We're getting an intermittent seeder every once in a while. Hey there Mr. seeder, if you happen to read this, you mind staying on long enough to let at least one of us finish?"
,IcySon55,2010-02-03T03:18Z,There we go. Seeding is now online again!
