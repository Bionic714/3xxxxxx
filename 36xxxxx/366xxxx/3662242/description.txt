The title pretty  much says it all. If you haven't heard about Daniel Dennett it's time you did. This lecture basically sums up the key points in the book in an eloquent and witty manner. The lecture is hosted by the Skeptics Society, who also sells the DVD, which is very nice to own. See www.skeptic.com for more info.

The format is XviD. I'm on a slow connection (1Mbps), so please be patient. :-)
