,55578,2007-06-02T11:25Z,"Thanks a lot mena_mon.

I would have preferred if it had aero glass but I guess that would take up tons of space...

I can only run this in 640x480 because they haven't made a vista driver for my onboard graphics."

,SecretDrummer,2008-01-22T04:41Z,"The AERO Glass theme was probably cut because it sucks up A LOT of space. If you download all the updates you can turn it into the retail version of Ultimate! =) This will give you the AERO Glass back, but will need tons of memory to function!"
