,raginggrace,2007-04-17T07:16Z,Is the point to a) express our opinion of your choices or b) to share the torrent?  IF b) Seeding promotes sharing.

,BREAMMUMMY,2007-05-31T14:37Z,Please!!! More seeds!!! There is 0 seeds in this moment. Those songs are so good. I want them. Please seed.
,hoochie_masta,2007-06-05T07:57Z,"Either some of the artist names are wrong, you're putting in just the singer/writer of the band; or there are better versions than listed; of a pretty large amount of these. (Over The Hills and Far Away - check out Nightwish's version; like Rammstein + Evinescence with a pinch of Metallica; but before Evinescence existed)

Still, nice selection."
