,nightsongz2,2007-04-15T15:52Z,My rips rule big time! :-)
,lozory,2007-04-16T09:50Z,but your resolution is smaller than aXXo's who you are always criticizing!? whats with that?
,nightsongz2,2007-04-16T09:55Z,"If you weren't such a retard, you'd notice that this is NOT a widescreen ratio...it's 4:3...if it was widescreen, it would have been a little over 640 pixels wide...don't run your mouth if you don't know what you are talking about. That just proves my point...that axxo's little sheep are clueless. :-))"
,lozory,2007-04-16T21:11Z,"well if you weren't such a... you'd know its not the width that matters anyway, the height determines the picture quality, its just how it works, so your constant winging about the with is only showing your ignorance. If you REALLY want to criticize you should be saying how the height is only 250 or whatever. Anything under 300 is gunna be a bit dodgy no matter how wide it is."
,nightsongz2,2007-04-22T02:27Z,Lol! You're so clueless that it's hilarious and a bit sad at the same time.
,lozory,2007-04-23T09:14Z,"look dude you must at least know the encoding/compression and video bitrate determine the picture quality, whether its 640 wide or 532 wide is nearly meaningless because if its encoded well you can blow a 532 wide rip up to full screen with excellent quality"
,lozory,2007-04-23T09:15Z,or are you one of these increadibly proud americans who 'knows everything aready'
,ariwen,2008-09-11T22:25Z,why don't you both take this outside...

,MsCyandra,2010-03-20T00:55Z,Lord I wish someone would just seed this! It was downloading fine up until it hit 73.9%. Now it's stuck with no seeds.
