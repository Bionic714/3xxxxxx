Here are rare and unusal news films, TV appearances and interviews featuring the greatest group ever, including a Shakespearean comedy sketch, long thought lost, with Paul and John as Pyramus and Thisbe. This exciting compilation from the sensational Sixties also features outrageously funny press conferences as well as clips of both their original drummer, Pete Best, and Ringo's temporary replacement, Jimmy Nicol. You'll see on-location footage of the Beatles shooting "A Hard Day's Night" at London's Paddington Station and their characteristically off-the-wall reactions to being made Members of the Order of the British Empire. Follow the controversy surrounding John's remark that the Beatles were "more popular than Jesus" and the boycott that resulted and hear about their run-in with the law for violating curfew at a Minneapolis motel.
