Plot:	Kung fu legend John "North Leg" Liu stars as a boot fighting lawman who's on the hunt for a notorious Shaolin ex-monk wanted for untold heinous crimes.

Overview:	The shaolin Monastery--well known for both its courageous monks and the fierce superiority of its martial artists--has somehow spawned a renegade monk whose taste for criminal pursuits of every kind has sparked a martial arts manhunt north of the Yangtze River, eventually involving the terrifying expertise of the "Seven Immovable Limbs" kung fu master, Ling Chu-Fei.

When a young orphan nicknamed "Small Mid-Fish" becomes the talented disciple of Master Ling, the renegade monk begins to plot their demise in a number of ingenious ways, but to no avail.

The deadly trio meet at last in a gut-wrenching duel that'll kick up enough dust and blood to cover just about anyone's living room floor.
