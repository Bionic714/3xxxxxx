Featuring fantastical puppet flora and fauna from Muppet man Jim Henson, this dark but wonderful children's movie follows Jen and Kira, two young Gelflings who are the last of their kind, as they try to fulfill the prophecy of the Dark Crystal. Jen?s wise master reveals on his deathbed that only a Gelfling will mend the crystal that cracked 1,000 years ago and placed the land under the dark rule of the evil, selfish Skeksis. To break the prophecy, the Skeksis killed all the Gelflings, and only Jen and Kira escaped their wrath. Now, though, Jen and Kira must journey into the heart of the Skeksis castle to reach the crystal and return the land to its former goodness.
