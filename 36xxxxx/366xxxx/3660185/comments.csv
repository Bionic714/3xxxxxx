,stylesonic,2007-04-10T08:22Z,The extracted file is corrupt. After doing a avi index with vlc I can only watch the first 6min then it stops. Any ideas?
,CpX,2007-04-13T15:37Z,"Jesus ;)
Just use winrar, and choose open in the application and open the file!!!

Or usually when winrar is installed, if u right click the 001 file, u can click the first choice, and it opens in winrar!
