,DadoR10,2007-05-25T21:11Z,"help please!
i have downloaded this game and i can't install.
some error showed to me.
something is wrong in Addons > signs.pbo.bi document"
,Staeld,2007-05-28T18:49Z,"The installation freezes up once it gets to the uninstall file at the end. I closed out the program and tried starting it up, it loaded and said something about the serial key not being valid. I reinstalled it, 4 times with 2 serials from the internet, the one in the nfo file, and another one from a keygen I downloaded here. none of them worked so I'm sure that the serial key isint the problem. 

Halp?"
,C.Kenny-,2007-06-01T17:15Z,"Ok, so i installed the game... but when i try to run it, it says that i have the wrong DvD inserted...

Help?"
,Robertz28,2007-06-03T02:12Z,"C.Kenny. Open the largest file (the one you mounted or burned) with Winrar. If you don't know which it is right click the white part of the folder and choose arrange icons by size. The largest file will be at the bottom. Open that one with Winrar. Inside you will find a Vitality folder with instructions. 
Basically install the patch to update from the games original version to 1.05 then replace the .exe file in the program file with the .exe file in the vitality forder. This is called a No CD fix or crack. what they do is allow you play a game without using the CD. That's why you're getting the error. 

The simplest way to go about it without updating (I would update) would be to search on google for ""Arma no cd"" and you will get a result from GameCopyWorld. They are a great source for no cd fixes. GameBurnWorld is another. Good luck.

"
,Robertz28,2007-06-03T02:16Z,Another tip. Games usually start out (when unpatched) at 1.0. For a No CD or a trainer (cheat program) to work you have to use the No CD or trainer specifically made for that version of the game. Say if you got a version 1.0 of a game called cocknballs you would need to find a Version 1.0 no cd  for it. If it were 1.3 the no cd would need to be for 1.3. So on and so forth same thing for trainers. So if you update the game to 1.05 you will need the no cd for 1.05. Unupdated you would need to get the 1.0 version.
,Robertz28,2007-06-03T02:19Z,If a 1.0 crack don't work try 1.04 this may be a 1.04 version.

OR:
I successfully updated my game by patching the patch itself. (these are the instructions only for ArmA_InternationalUpdate105_108.exe (972.517.376 bytes)):
open the file with any HEX editor (search google if you don't have) and set the 6 bytes starting at offset 0x000369EE all to 0x90. I.E.:

they are 0F 84 EF 02 00 00, but after editing become 90 90 90 90 90 90.

this will disable the cd key check in the patch."

any suggestions?"
,Rycon,2008-06-25T20:09Z," The problem is if you want to patch to 1.14. The only thing you can do is keep reinstalling the game with different keys using the keygen by razor and hope you get a good one, I have yet to find one after 3 reinstalls (Which take a very long time due to the patches). Plus I havent found a easy way to see if fade is activated so that takes even longer, the quickest way (Which isnt all that quick) is to play the shooting range and near the end you will turn into a bird. 

We need a 1.14 crack that gets rid of fade (NO-CD is not required since 1.14 removes that) or someone needs to post a key that works with 1.14. The patch is a significant update and is very much worth it.

You can play online as long as you dont join a server that someone has the same key as you (I think) because one server I joined rejected me for cd key and another I didnt have a problem with."

Offcourse you cant play this online.
Its Pirated Software!

The only chance you have is to find a cracked server for cracked ArmA gamers :S search for a website containing those servers and their IP, select ""connect to IP"" in ArmA.

This game is beautifull though, and deserves to be bought - especially online gaming is nice, the SP missions are not that good; the enemy AI is lethal and your teammates cant do anything right.

I recently bought this game on Ebay for EUR 11,40 ex shipping. You can also buy it from armedassault.com for EUR 20. Since ArmA 2 is coming out expect the prices to go down.

And just to burst your little bubble. Those ""50 little winzip files"" are actually RAR files, which you've obviously associated with Winzip, and the ""rar file that's really big"" inside, is a fucking iso file, which can be opened using winrar, which, you've obviously chosen to associate with iso files.

I doubt you've any fucking idea what I'm talking about, but the bottom line is that you've fucked up the way files are associated with programs. You don't even NEED winzip. Who the fuck uses winzip anymore? Winrar and 7z is all anyone will ever need to do any file compression.

Now take your head out of your ass and learn how to do this shit before you go talkin' shit."

,expose13,2010-02-18T03:57Z,"Works fine Thanks MAZO. 

Once DLed, select all .rar .r# files, 
right click - extract to single folder.

Burn or mount the .ISO with daemon tools. 
Click on autorun.exe to install game.
CD key:  8HPG-ZY2YZ-XE0HS-CXLBK-649SZ

Make sure your graphics card has most recent update.
Explore the disc and open Vitality folder.
Run the update from the disc.
Copy & paste the arma.exe file from Vitality folder to the folder where you installed the game. (Copy and replace).
Start game and have fun.

Thats exactly what I did and it works perfectly.
Thanks again -=MAZO=-"

,rayyan_legal,2011-01-22T22:08Z,no one can download this without wating!
,sylar951,2012-08-01T03:03Z,"the game is great but terribly optimized...
It's 2012. and I have a high end machine and still not able to play with everything very high with max 10 000m distance...

luckily, 1.18 patch changes the textures of flora and buildings giving an amazing boost to the performance...

before I had avg. 30 FPS, with the patch I got about 58 FPS... you can download this version, it's better optimized:
