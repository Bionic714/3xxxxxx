Notes from pjnola24:
I don't know if this is a PRE-FM SBD or an FM Broadcast show.  The Hard to Imagine Website claims that this show is available only as FM Broadcast.  This is probably accurate; however it seems that the sound quality is just as good as some PRE-FM SBD shows that I've heard.  The left/right separation on the guitars is fairly good and the clarity and separation of the individual instruments is pretty good as well.

Also note, that this IS the complete show.  Pearl Jam was apparently an opening band for Alice and Chains and Soundgarden for this particular show.
