Jeff Goeke-Smith
A Re-Introduction to Photography
Synopsis
Last year, I spent an hour trying to convey some basics of terminology and technique about photography. I'll be back to revisit the same topics again, and cover a bit more this time. Jargon laden concepts such as ISO, F-stop, exposure, focal length, and sensor size will be covered. I will present examples of picture framing, lighting, and use of flash. Finally, another round of 'questions about photography' will be included.
