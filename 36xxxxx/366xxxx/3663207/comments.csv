,VikingZombi,2007-04-15T14:24Z,"Guess it has been somekind of shutdown, haven't I already downloaded TNG S7D1-3 from Mr_Fear?
BTW Mr_Fear, you rock my world with your uploads."
,Sweden(We Try Harder),2007-04-15T17:51Z,"Thanks! This is a little bit confusing. If this is the right S07D01, what was the other one then?"
,Haldor_D,2007-04-15T23:23Z,The first S7D1 was in fact S7D2. Which then got seeded again as S7D2. This is the real S7D1
,VikingZombi,2007-04-16T01:10Z,"OK, thanx :)
So S7D2 is D3 and D3 is D4 then......I think, hehe"

,einstein56,2007-04-16T14:51Z,"Thanks again to MR Fear, you're great!
So does anybody have old Dark Shadows episodes to upload? I loved that show too. If not, can anybody give me an invite to Demonoid, they have some there?
ANyway, thanks again to Mr Fear, and if I can help with other trek stuff, let me know."
