This is a beutiful documentary on the story of islam and why the message of islam is still being carried on today: 

On the tenth day of the first month, in the year 61 AH of the Islamic Calendar ? on the hot, desert plains of Kerbala, a small group of noble individuals were massacred by an army of thousands. 

The victims were devout followers of the religion of Islam. The perpetrators, led by Yazeed, son of Muawiyah, claimed to follow that very same religion. 

It was a day ?When Skies Wept Blood?. 

The sacrifice is unrivalled from the dawn of time ? yet the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (AS) and his companions is neglected by many. 

''Karbala: When Skies Wept Blood'' examines the final days of the life of Imam Hussain (AS), the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and sets out to establish the reasons behind the tragedies that took place at Karbala in the year 61 of the Islamic Calendar. Using unique footage, and talks by leading scholars, the viewer is presented with an excellent presentation for followers of the Ahlul Bayt (AS), and as an introduction to followers of other faiths.
