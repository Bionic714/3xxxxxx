Thanks!"
,bigdane545,2008-06-22T15:38Z,"Well it worked great for about 5 days then for some reason the combined files would come out with the audio/video all distorted.  I tried uninstall all the codecs on my computer/reinstalling/reinstall the cracked program yet the same issue occurred.  Then, I used the legit version and voila.. it worked.  I'm not sure why it stopped working but it sucks cause now I have to use boilsoft video joiner.. which isn't as nice I don't think but o'well."
