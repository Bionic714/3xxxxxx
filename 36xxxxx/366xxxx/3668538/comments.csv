,steve99999,2008-04-14T14:28Z,"for anyone out there who downloads these subs and don't know how to add them, Before converting to dvd put the SRT subtitle file in with the avi file (in same folder) then you must make sure the base name's the same. Example =avi file is called                  wrd-ghosts  So the SRT file must be renamed wrd-ghosts.SRT Then when coverted the subs will be added."
