Here is some more of Tricia Devereaux from "University Co-eds volume #7"  Tricia is left stranded when her truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere. with no one around and time to kill she passes the time entertaining herself.  A good samaritan passing by fixes her ass then her truck.  I "assume" he fixes her truck.  Or at least gives her a ride.

Take care,
Enjoy,
