,see_me_move,2007-04-13T22:08Z,"Dude I've got one server running, and I've let it run for a week.... I'm seeding as fast as I can, if you know of anyway that I could do it faster tell me. I'll do it."
,yooohooo,2007-08-26T12:08Z,"what is this for programs, i'm a beginner so don't judge me :)"
,IHWHI,2007-09-15T19:01Z,"its basically for wep hacking..most of the programs search for routers with low securty such as net stumbler ( which finds 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g)

So you can go around with your labtop and hack your idiot next door neighbor that never cuts his grass and has his dog shit in your yard.. :)"

,Djsanz,2008-11-25T14:52Z,"Hi everyone, i'm not interested in hacking other peoples computers, all i want to do is identify other people on the same channel frequency as me so that i can choose a more isolated channel and therefore get a better broadband signal.  
I have netstumbler and it looks kinder dated and i've got vista, so any help on how I can use it or if there is something better; please someone fill me in.  My mum has XP and i've followed instructions using hers fine, you just need to disable auto configuration on something in services, which I did and still nothing, I checked compatibility with livebox at their forum and all is ok.
Netstumbler just says no network adapter found which is obvious to me because I don't need one its built in.
GPS says disabled whatever that means. I just have a wireless ready HP laptop that connects by signal via a router upstairs and i'm on vista, so does anyone know what I need to do?

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to respond, much appreciated.  "
,Djsanz,2008-11-25T15:02Z,"ryankopite09, 
usually you get a file called a NFO file with every download, open this with notepad by default, then every time you double cick it will open.  These files have all the info like serials, directions to patching, if your downloading a movie one of these will have notes on the film, actors, genre or maybe links to subtitles etc. If there is no directions to what you do with the password, usually register is located in ""help"" or ""about"". 
Sometimes software automatically asks you upon installation wether you want to search the web for updates, just ignore this sort of stuff at least until you've registered the software, otherwise it might automatically stop your key from working. Just remember always open the NFO file first and follow instructions carefully.  If it asks you not to start the program upon installation then uncheck the box which enables this when your about to click on finish for install. 

Hope this helps pal."
,Djsanz,2008-11-25T15:08Z,"Sorry if you already new that stuff and felt patronising, i've not downloaded the file because i'm still researching my options.  
But again, if there's multiple software icons which you haven't a clue what they're for or do then; open the NFO and it SHOULD have everything you need informational wise.  If not I usually do a google search or something on the software and just research its uses etc. You never know what your installing and how they may conflict with other similar programs."

Vistumblers a great program that uses the netsh command built into vista. It shows channels etc and is free. Nice gui too. It'll even beep at you if your wardriving and it comes across an unsecure network.
Wifi hopper is another one, but is shareware and i dont like it as much.
Ignore anything that says GPS its usually for people who drive around locating wireless hotspots or easy-to-hack-into-spots, so they can plug a gps in and save where they found them.
I found netstumbler didnt support much wireless hardware or you need to install special drivers. Either way your probably only need vistumbler"
