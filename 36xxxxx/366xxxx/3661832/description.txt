Plot Summary 

From AllMovie: Released shortly after Luciano Emmer's documentary Picasso, H. G. Clouzot's Le Mystère Picasso managed to attain better international bookings than the earlier film, largely on the strength of Clouzot's worldwide hit Les Diaboliques. Like Emmer before him, Clouzot offers rare and precious glimpses of Pablo Picasso at work. The film traces two of the artist's paintings, from inception to pencil sketch to final product. The director comes as close as humanly possible to defining the genius of Picasso within the parameters of the camera lens. Oddly, Le Mystère Picasso does not appear on many of the 'official' lists of Clouzot's films, even though it won a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.

From IMDB: Using a specially designed transparent 'canvas' to provide an unobstructed view, Picasso creates as the camera rolls. He begins with simple works that take shape after only a single brush stroke. He then progresses to more complex paintings, in which he repeatedly adds and removes elements, transforming the entire scene at will, until at last the work is complete.
