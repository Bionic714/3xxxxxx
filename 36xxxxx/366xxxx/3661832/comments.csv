As this is hidden and modified as needed, chances are poor that anyone would be able to reseed this torrent once they had opened the directory and viewed the movie. Better torrent clients have the option to ignore this and similar files when creating a torrent, and it is good to also set Windows to view hidden files and to not cache thumbnails. "

I wanted to seed this for you, and have just worked out how to create a torrent file.  If i haven't done it right, can someone please tell me?"
