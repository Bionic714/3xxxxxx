How about some more of Candy Apples?  She plays a blonde cheerleader in "Pappa Don't Bitch", from Nineteen Video Magazine volume #13.  It seems Candy has missed curfew yet again.  She has got her dad wondering and worrying.  Where is she?  What is she doing?  And, who is she doing it with?  It's four-thirty in the morning! Well, dad, lets cut to the tape.  We have it right here.  To answer your question, sir.  Candy is alone in someone's living room with two boys from school.  Sir, she seems to be letting these boys use every one of her orifices to their liking.  Why don't you have a look here?

Take care,
Enjoy,

Sir?  You look a little pale.
