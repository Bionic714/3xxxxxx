The Data could not be read please turn off the power, then remove and reinsert the game card
What should I do?:S"
,foreverfallout,2007-07-07T09:20Z,"For those of you having trouble getting this rom to work in no$gb do this:

open no$gb
load the rom, it will give you the error
go to options > emulation setup
Make GBA Mode ""Nintendo DS (in GBA mode)""
and make NDS Cartridge Backup Media ""Flash 512kbytes""
Then click file > reset cartridge

It should work then"
