,rgraham,2007-04-13T10:46Z,"For noobs (equals anyone who gets scared of going to google and looking up winrar, and then learning how to use it) go to google, look up winrar, learn to use it (its pretty simple), use it on the first file you've downloaded, and presto.
For people who know what they're talking about - why are they in rar format anyway?  Is the person who told me that it doesn't really compress it that much anyway, wrong?"
,jlh_,2007-04-16T12:37Z,"^^ correct, they don't compress well, if at all (because they're compressed already).  People do this, because this provides a way to split a huge file into smaller units, which might be handier for some tasks.  But don't ask me for what exactly.  (Sending via email?  IRC?)

I'd rather like one big file too, that makes it easier to spot fakes, as you can watch them before the download completes."
,diku,2007-04-16T21:04Z,"Oh, btw, you don't have to unrar it, if u use bsplayer. 
 And thanks to you LOL."
,AdRaste,2007-04-17T08:29Z,"the reason for .rar format is that u can watch a movie/tvshow while you download it. u just set the first folders on priority one some later folders on 2 , 3 and so on.
it does compress it a little bit, and for people with a normal ADSL cable which dont have the greates DL speed this is useful takes away about 20 minutes of DL"
,jlh_,2007-04-25T17:02Z,"In other words: Putting large files in RAR archives is a very ugly work-around for a missing feature in most BT clients (to prioritize parts of a single file).

Not to mention that for seeding *and* watching, you always need twice the disk space (unless you have a suitable player, as mentioned above)."
,johanponken,2007-06-15T22:04Z,"Yes. Rar-span is like candy in prepacked bags when you so easly can get it in any amount by the gram with BT. Notice how I didn't use the word ""buy""? :). Would someone please register by the name ""Repack"" and live up to it?!"
