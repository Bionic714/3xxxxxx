Hope you all enjoy, because I noticed it was not easy to find all the seasons right away, so I made it easier  and now I can't wait for season 5. You can either burn them to DVD or mount them with a virtual drive to play them. If you computer can't play DVDs you can google VLC player to play the iso straight from you computer.

Files:
-Red vs Blue season 1.iso
-Red vs Blue season 2.iso
-Red vs Blue season 3.iso
-Red vs Blue season 4.iso

This is my first torrent and I will seed as much as possible.
