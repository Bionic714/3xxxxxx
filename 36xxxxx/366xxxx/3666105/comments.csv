,jester45,2007-04-20T01:02Z,yea i forgot to mention but on that only season 4 dvd i uploaded over 60GB so M-Crow have fun getting all these seasons going thanks tho
,M-Crow,2007-04-20T04:20Z,"I agree with Jester. If you people would like, download season 4 from him and 1-3 from me, I just put these here recently to be easy to find but its not as old as Jester's so his would be faster, I just want you guys to get these as fast as possible! :)"

,M-Crow,2007-08-29T06:05Z,"Hey of course I know, I havent seen you since the week before graduation. I seriously think you should get an exturnal hard drive for more room.  I don't seed this thing anymore and to all this is just the four seasons plus the dvd extras which come on the retail dvds. 

Alright later Ricardo."

,Tha-man,2007-10-06T18:46Z,well i can just say SEED because download speed is only on 40 kb/s
,M-Crow,2007-10-07T14:43Z,"I might just slpit this torrent into 4 different ones, it will go faster and it would be easier to seed."
,jman1423,2007-10-12T20:09Z,I'm stuck at 99.9% of season 4.  Can someone please seed this so I can finish everything?  Thanks!
,lordspamelot,2007-11-24T10:09Z,Help me! My iso's aren't opening... any tips?
,mjolnir037,2007-12-14T22:29Z,"If I'm wrong, I have no clue.... If not, here; go download and install daemon tools. After you open it, it will appear in your toolbar, right click and select Virtual CD/DVD-ROM, select whatever drive appears, click Mount Image then locate the iso, click open then enjoy."
,markforu99,2007-12-18T21:07Z,Anybody know if this is NTSC or PAL?
,isxaari,2007-12-19T19:50Z,I have 17.1GB of the file @ 23% on bit comet. Does this mean that no one is seeding the full torrent? If so that blows. This happen on my other computer too. It gets to the last 1% and no matter how long i seed it never finish. Hmmm Maybe I need another torrent program?
,eovnu87435ds,2007-12-24T02:01Z,"This is awesome! I hope these are ripped DVDs and not just the vids DL'ed off RVB. If they are, then they have to be the NTSC version, because there is only PAL versions of season 1"
,jamedo,2007-12-29T02:07Z,"hey, will u be making any of these seasons into divx/xvid(?) format any time soon because if i understand right AVI's are smaller than ISO's.
if not im a twonk so sue me lol "
,eovnu87435ds,2008-01-03T03:38Z,Took forever to dl but finally i got it! nice one M-Crow! u think u can get a season 5 iso up anytime soon? i cant find one anywhere
,LinkinM,2008-01-31T00:57Z,"HUGE filesize, but thanks! Currently downloading."
,rmerl,2008-03-07T14:52Z,Does it have spanish subtitles? THXS
,eovnu87435ds,2008-04-14T05:31Z,this is great. seeding... can someone put a season 5 iso up? i cant find one ANYWHERE
,Li1Chief,2008-04-21T06:59Z,How pissed would all the downloaders be if I only downloaded the 4th season?
,silver40mm,2008-06-24T21:17Z,Seed faster please! i've been downloading at 100kbps today but the past few days its only been at 50. i've been seeding what i have at 50.
,goodyme,2008-08-02T22:25Z,trying to download separately is hard
,MFCrow,2008-12-03T10:42Z,"Hey everyone glad to see my torrent is still up and not dead since its been over a year since I put it up.

I havent been able to recover my old account hence the new one but to answer some questions

Its NTSC the files r sepreate and I had gathered them from other torrent sites a year ago and yes they r all DVD rips so they r perfect quality, 

the fourth season actually has an option to be watched in HD 

If you are loking for Divx versions or something, i dont sorry

And last I dont have season 5 I just picked these up from other places and if I find a good season 5 iso ill link here

If you have download all the isos here congrats on the wait i know it took long, took me months but with the current seeding ratio this torrent wont last long. So if you have the chance please just leave ur computer to seed a lil longer after you download for others to download and take over to seed
