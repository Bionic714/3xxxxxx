Recorded at Bochum Planetarium, Germany on April 29th 2006 and The National Space Centre, England on May 27th 2006 
Composed, performed, arranged and produced by David Wright 

Dave Massey - additional sequencing on track 5 & 6 

The Tenth Planet is taken from David Wright's 2006 Planetarium concerts in Germany and the UK, and continues to build on the artists success since his superb 2002 "Walking Walking with Ghosts" and the recent "Continuum" and "Deeper" offerings. 
This is top notch melodic keyboard synth music, imaginatively rhythmic with great sequences and some stonking solos. There are some quiter atmospheric and reflective moments as well, which include a quite beautiful piano section during "Odyssey" and a delightful, impromptu version of the 1994 track "Glass Mountains".
The album lists 13 tracks, although the seven part "Odyssey" is one epic 40 minute musical voyage on the grandest of scales. There are also masterful reworkings of 3 previously released DW pieces, Sea of Dreams (4 parts), Sound of Waves and the afforementioned Glass Mountains. But these are sufficiently different to their original versions so as to make the album an essential addition to any fans collection.
The Tenth Planet is also likely to appeal to those who enjoy the music of Tangerine Dream, Vangelis or Jean Michel Jarre.
