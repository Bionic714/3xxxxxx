,ECELonghorn,2008-07-02T07:48Z,"Noticed this torrent when browsing. I own the paperback version of this book, and I must say I honestly think it's one of the best programming related books I've ever read. The text assumes you know the basics of Java (and principles of object oriented programming) but really focuses on strategy and concepts of ""good"" programming and how to _best_ design your objects. I didn't really expect much from the book just figured it'd be average but I'm so glad I came across it.

Another comment below has a summary of the book, but just to highlight the best part:

At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others..."

scanned = crappy.  

Anyway, you can save 30$ from buying the real book though."
