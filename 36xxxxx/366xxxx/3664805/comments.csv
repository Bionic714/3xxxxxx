,gdavej,2007-04-15T22:49Z,"According to FlyTampa website, there isn't a version available at the moment for FSX. There are 2 versions currently on sale, the complete FS2004 version with all 3 airports (size 58Mb), and the TNCM FS2004 version with only TNCM (size 23 Mb). So I guess (and hope) that this is the FS2004 version with all 3 airports."
,Sky-bird,2007-04-15T23:55Z,"I don't know where you saw that?

http://www.flytampa.com/order_tncm_iframe.html"
,gdavej,2007-04-16T00:38Z,"That's exactly where I saw it. That page says that the 2 released versions (Complete and TNCM) are both for FS2004, and that a FSX version is TBA (to be announced). It does say that the Complete version is  Preliminary St. Maarten (TNCM) for FSX, but then it says that this is a FS2004 Addon product. It's all very confusing since the installer claims that it's for FSX, and the website says that only the 58Mb version includes all 3 files for FS2004."
,Sky-bird,2007-04-16T15:23Z,"Hmm,

I don't have FS-X, so i can't test it. However the other Flytampa scenery ; search for Flytampa TNCM and then my version. That's for FS2004 with all three airports included. Can you let me know if it works in FS-X?

Thanks"
,torom,2007-04-17T06:24Z,Yes it works in FSX. What about those serials...
,OlaNordmann7,2007-04-18T17:54Z,"Torom: please! give Sky-Bird a break! Rome was not built in one day you know! Patience, patience!"
