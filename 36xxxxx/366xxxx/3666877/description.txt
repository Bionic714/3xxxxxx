This is a one of a kind release by the one
and only l33t Kings. It sends messages to the
MTGO servers to confuse them into sending you
cards for free.

If your logged into magic online, log out.
Start the program provided. Start magic online.
log in like normal. Don't go into the marketplace or
any of the regular MTGO rooms.
Leave the computer alone for about 5 minutes.
After that you should start receiving new cards into your
account from random sets. if you receive boosters, do not
open them or draft with them (they carry special code that checks
if you bought or traded for them when they are opened,
as it may cause the server to crash and get your acct deleted, just trade them to someone
else (once traded they are fine).
If you do not receive new cards after 5-10 minutes,
logout and do not login until after 1 hour and the new cards
should be there, if not you did something wrong, do it again.

Worked everytime we tried it, last tested April 5th 2007.
