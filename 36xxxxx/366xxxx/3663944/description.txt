These movies ARE in Anaglyph 3D! You WILL need the red/blue glasses for watching them!

I listed these as "other quality" as these were originally ripped from the Japanese VHD video disc system from 1990. I didn't see a listing that specific so I just listed it as more "general".

They are encoded with XviD with 2 passes. English. NO Subtitles as there were none. NTSC. All three movies have MP3 Stereo sound.

NOTE 1: These were made from a video system with resolution equal to laser disc at the time. These movies are NOT DVD quality resolution! Laser disc/ Japanese VHD resolution falls in between VHS tapes and DVD.

NOTE 2: These ARE Anaglyph 3D movies. If watching Anaglyph movies and wearing red/blue glasses aren't your "thing", then PLEASE don't download and then turn around and complain. You are only making yourself look like a fool! You have been warned!

These movies were made in the early 1980's as "gimmick" films as there was a "3D film revival" taking place at the time. These movies weren't meant to be intellectual, just fun to watch. So just have fun and enjoy them!
