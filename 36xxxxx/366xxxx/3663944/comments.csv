I found posters not only in English but also in Japanese, Italian, and Spanish for these movies. I thought you guys could use these to help make DVD disc lables and DVD-ROM covers for your cases."
,tangled,2007-05-05T23:33Z,Insanely cool! Thanks alot!
,bobamedina2005,2007-07-18T08:46Z,"This is awesome. The quailty is maybe 5/10 on Friday, the other two movies wouldbe a 7.

Ripped from VHS.

The 3-d effect is still amazing. I have 3-d glasses from the Nightmare On Elm St box set, a pair comes in the box.

Any fan of 3-d, it's worth a download. i wish they released these on DVD, or better yet Blu-Ray. "
,JesusEatsBabies,2007-08-31T00:02Z,"GREAT! Thanks, love ffriday the 13th and its great to see it in 3D, the qualitys not that great but they still work with the glasses, my only problem is with all the extra black space, couldnt you have cropped the videos or something?"

Thanks Again"
,wrecche,2007-12-17T04:26Z,"Ohhh I wish you'd made seperate torrents for the movies and just linked them each in each ones notes - I guess 4.05 gig isnt a lot, but larger torrents end up with less seeders over a shorter time.

Also people may not want all 3 and only select parts of a torrent, effectively killing a proper torrent. 

I will get this, may have to do it off peak, as Im almost busting my cap now, but when I do, I may re-release them individually also, crediting you here and linking to this one, coz stuff like this is damn hard to find on the net, and I'd love to help spread it !!!

Excellet job mate !!"

,movieguy,2008-08-07T09:45Z,"The video quality is DAMN horrible, almost impossible to see the 3D

It looks like a blind man was doing the encoding"
,captnSlaughter,2008-08-28T04:11Z,if i burn these will they still be in 3D

I've never seen bad video quality like this before!
I don't know how are the other movies but the Jaws is Wasting time..."
,LORDLORD,2010-01-12T23:40Z,"Where i can find other anaglyph 3d movies ?

Thx"
,ProphetZarquon,2010-03-02T20:39Z,"READ THE DESCRIPTION!  This is NOT a VHS rip.  It's clearly Laserdisc quality.  VHS would look more washed out.  That said, don't expect it to look like a DVD.

Read the description!  He told you exactly what you were getting.  Yes, you will need red/blue glasses, no you don't need anything else.

Seeding for 3 days, or until I hit 3:1.

Sadly, I'll never watch these again, since the movies themselves bore me to tears."
,Mart726,2010-08-23T11:04Z,Ugly 2D to 3D coversion.
