David Tennant is back again as the adventurous time lord with a new companion to kick off the new season. This disc contains the following:

The Christmas Invasion
The Runaway Bride

The title sequence has been totaly revamped and looks professionally produced. The menus have also been completely redone from the first set of DVDs and look realy cool now. And I also included as a bonus a hidden easter egg!. Happy hunting!
