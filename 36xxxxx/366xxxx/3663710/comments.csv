,Blacknoon,2007-04-23T23:00Z,"Oops, your right, I meant The Runaway Bride."
,Phyxsius88,2007-04-26T17:02Z,"Dude, you listed both of them as part of season 3."
,Blacknoon,2007-04-28T17:01Z,"I included the Runaway bride as part of season 3 to make a complete set of all the episodes. The BBC did release The Runaway Bride as a separate DVD but did you really want to burn a dvd, print labels, etc. for just one episode?"
,Blacknoon,2007-04-28T17:08Z,"Cover and DVD label has been uploaded to Cdcover.cc

Does anybody care?
Do you want more like this on a future release?

Please leave feedback"

I did get an average of 20 Some MB on the Season 2 and 3 Downloads From Blacknoon here (The ones that downloaded any at all), then they all just kinda stopped.  And I notice Season 2 disk 2 both have comments that their not being seeded anymore.  Makes me a Sad Panda, Blacknoon does great work."
