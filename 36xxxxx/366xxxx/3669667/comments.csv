Not many new titles in (E) or (U) though. How often should we expect these uploads? When do you think 1000-1100 is here?"

Depends on the scene. The list I'm following is at 1019 atm. Shouldn't take too long tho."

It signifies releaselocation. E = Europe, U = the US, J = Japan. Some other variations for Korea, Germany, China, France, Spain is also sometimes occuring."

The european ones are always in at least english, but often french, german, and such as well. Those without english are normally labeled (F) for french and such."
