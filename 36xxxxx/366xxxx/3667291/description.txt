If you cried when Bambi's mom died, or wish you could even the odds for doe-eyed game animals, or just relish irony, Deer Avenger 4 could be for you. This hunting game parody once again puts you in the hooves of Bambo, a rebellious buck who turns the tables on the hunters. Gun down some rednecks in the forest or seek them out where they live (the trailer park). The fourth installment of this humorous series features new jokes, locations, weapons, and scopes, as well as two new hunters named Agent X and El Nacho. There's also a scene where Bambo drives an SUV to catch his prey.
