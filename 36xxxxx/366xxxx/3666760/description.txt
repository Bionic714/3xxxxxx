Well written, brilliantly cast and with the best premise of any series for the 1995-1996 season, the pilot of Nowhere Man had a smashing premiere with great ratings and glittering reviews.
Bruce Greenwood plays Thomas Veil, a journalistic photographer whose whole life is erased by some giant master plan. In the opening episode Veil - quite literally - loses his identity one night over dinner and begins to mentally unravel when he discovers his wife is part of whatever\\\\\\\'s happening. In the sanitarium where he\\\\\\\'s forcefully placed he slowly realizes that he\\\\\\\'s actually the victim of some massive conspiracy. He manages to break out, only to find that both his best friend and his Mother have been coldly eliminated. The episode ends chillingly -- with Thomas Veil alone in the desert, unable to trust the one man who offers him a ride.

The premiere was stunning -- subtly written and delicately acted to create with uneasy momentum the frightening concept that this everyman - just like you or me - could simply be erased. Tobe Hooper\\\\\\\'s consummate direction used eerie effects that would become themes as the series progressed and Bruce Greenwood reached a heightened level of acting as the strong but vulnerably \\\\\\\"veiled\\\\\\\" hero.
