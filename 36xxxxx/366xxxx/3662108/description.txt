Notes:

The Four-Eyed Freak proudly presents :
Led Zeppelin - The Dragon Snake Upgraded

2 versions of this show are circulating. The first one, "Dragon Snake" probably comes from a raw transfert of a (x-generation ?) cassette. The second one, "Drums & Bass Show", is obviously remastered from the same source. Typicaly the kind of brutal remaster i can't stand : harsh equalisation removing all medium frequency, incredible noise reduction untill all hiss (and a lot of music) is definitively removed, compression to death untill all dynamics is reduced to zero. The resulting music sounds very unnatural to my ears, but it's of course a personal opinion.

Though, it's sure the "Dragon Snake" had to, and could be improved in a less destructive way, that's what i tried to do. Some mp3 snippets will let you hear the "before and after" comparison between "Dragon Snake" and this remaster. Some other ones will let you compare "Drums and Bass" with it. Listen to them, make your own opinion, and don't download this torrent if you think it is a bad or an non interesting job done. Otherwise, please trade it freely for non connected people. Please always join this text and the new artwork so people will clearly know that it is a modified (and possibly to-avoid) version, not the original one.

Thousand thanks to Markybhoy who uploaded the wonderful original "Dragon Snakes" from the silver discs on DIME, and to Shoestunes who uploaded the "Drum and Bass" version from where i took  the bonus track d3t7 and added it to this torrent.
