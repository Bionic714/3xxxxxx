[b]Synopsis[/b]
Herbert West has a very good head on his shoulders... and another one in a dish on his desk! Deep within the morgue at Miskatonic University, arrogant madman West (Jeffrey Combs) introduces fellow graduate student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) to his startling formula for the re-animation of fresh corpses. But the secret of life and death has some very messy consequences. Get ready to re-experience one of the most outrageously inventive horror films of all time, the over-the-top classic that The New York Times hails as ?ingenious?it has as much originality as it has gore, and that?s really saying something!??
