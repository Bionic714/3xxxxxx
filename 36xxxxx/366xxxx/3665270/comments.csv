,RogerPersson,2007-06-13T03:45Z,"Does anyone have the full theme music? You see, I am a cheap fuck and therefore I dont like the idea of paying 99 cents for it if I could get it for free by request it on Piratebay and wait for a month or so before someone sees my question and decides to upload it. In that case Ive save the most part of a dollar and thats a good thing. :D"
