,mmm_2000,2007-04-29T04:20Z,"I just uploaded the torrent a few hours ago ! (see date/time in the corner).

This has the original english soundtrack and has no subs. Its a vido file using matroska codec (google matroska or mkv for codec info).

If you want subs you can try some subtitle websites like:

There are plenty out there.

Enjoy"
