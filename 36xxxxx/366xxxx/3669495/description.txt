In fog-dripping, barren and sometimes macabre settings,
 11th-century Scottish nobleman Macbeth is led by an evil prophecy 
and his ruthless yet desirable wife to the treasonous act that makes him king. 
But he does not enjoy his newfound, dearly-won kingship... 
Restructured, but all the dialogue is Shakespeare's.
