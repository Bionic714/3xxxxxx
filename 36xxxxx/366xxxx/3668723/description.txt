Who Is It" is a song by Michael Jackson from his 1991 album Dangerous. 
The song is, like several of Jackson's most famous songs, about rumors. 
The song peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 when released. Michael Jackson 
sang it a cappella during his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. 
 
Music video 
The music video for "Who Is It" was directed by David Fincher ('Alien 3', 
'Panic Room', 'Fight Club' and 'Seven'). The video is set in a neo-chrome 
blade-runner-like landscape, where surfaces reflect light and denote luxury 
in all it's splendor. We see Michael Jackson as a suffering recluse who has 
come to the conclusion that his girlfriend is cheating. He finds a platinum 
business card with the name 'Alex' seemingly confirming that she is cheating 
with this person who's name is on the card. As the video progresses, we learn 
that the girlfriend is working for a secret exclusive billionaire-boys-club 
escort agency. Her identity and visual appearence is changed regularly, confirmed 
by the platinum business cards she presents to each client as the nights go on. 
This reveals that the name 'Alex' on the card found by Jackson is one of her 
aliases and is not a secret lover. When she senses that something is wrong and 
defies her employees to run back to Jacksons home to find him, she finds Jackson's 
assistant at the door who reveals that Jackson has left and probably for good. 
The assistant hands her a collection of her alias business cards revealing that 
her secret is out and that she has been exposed. Devastated, she is forced to 
return submissively back to her ruthless employees and continue on as a high 
class prostitite. The video ends with a broken Michael Jackson flying off in 
his private jet.
