,far_isle,2008-01-14T19:34Z,"we all seem to be stuck at 28% :(  if anyone can reseed one of us, we can keep this torrent alive.  Some of us run 24/7 so this will be easy to spread it through the people who enjoy these types of informative videos.  Thnx.  "

,far_isle,2008-02-17T01:42Z,"Nukert, please if you would.  It has been months, literally, hanging on.  We are now mostly up to 38.8% but that is a long way off.  I would be more than happy to restart, if I knew it could finish."
,agrouse,2008-07-03T02:05Z,"Can anyone please upload the Just Planes World Air Routes Wideroe Dash 8 DVD ( http://www.worldairroutes.com/Wideroe.html ) as it is out of stock everywhere and there seem no plans to produce another run.

Also can anyone upload the other Dash Just Planes DVD - Intersky ( http://www.worldairroutes.com/Intersky.html ).

Thanks ... "
