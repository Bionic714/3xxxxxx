    #    This three-part documentary series traces the unique and volatile history         #
    #    of coffee. Episode one explores the origins of coffee in Ethiopia and its         #
    #    triumphant spread over five continents. It's journey that sparked not only        #
    #    controversy, creativity, business and slavery, but also revolution. This first    #
    #    installment traces the transformation and evolution of humble coffee traditions   #
    #    - that first began on dirt floors - through to modern practises we recognise      #
    #    today.                                                                            #
