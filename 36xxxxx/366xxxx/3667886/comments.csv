Thank you Dopeman for rippin' an awesome game.

However, the training videos don't appear when I press them...it's just a black screen that pops up?!

Anyone has any tips on what that is about?"
,Tibob,2007-06-10T18:53Z,Dopeman removed all movies so that must include training videos too.
,Tibob,2007-06-10T20:57Z,I found a fix for the saving problem. What I did is extract the game in a different folder and applied the newest reloaded crack. Hope it helps ^^.
,ksuju,2007-06-12T01:02Z,what's the new reloaded crack?
,SG-MG21,2007-06-12T01:50Z,Where can you download this crack?

,Lilleeen,2007-08-09T11:46Z,"Hello. I got a problem. I can properly start the game, get the info for the first mission and choose gadgets/weapons. But when i click load out, my computer says there has been a system error and it urges me to restart the computer to reset settings. I doubted it would be able to cope with the demands of Chaos Theory but the computer test (detectionui_r.exe.) said it should work just fine. Got any suggestions ?"

,stinki,2008-01-04T08:45Z,"not sure why no-one else has had this problem, it's well documented on the ubisoft support forum...

there was a windows xp security update released in 2006 which prevents chaos theory from running. i've been unable to get it to load (mouse pointer changes to ""loading"" icon for a few seconds, then nada happens..program crashes silently), and finally found the solution today. 

if you are having this problem, you must go to add/remove programs in control panel, click ""show updates"", and remove windows xp security update kb917422. there was actually a patch released by microsoft that is supposed to remedy this problem -- but it didn't work for me, only uninstalling kb917422 produced success.

hope that helps some other frustrated folks."
,trustno1fox,2008-01-04T10:44Z,"AHHHH MOTHER ****** DOPEMAN , you must have been high when you made this !!!!!!

hhahaha i figured it out!!!! 

ok Do what that guy tibob did with fixing the crack and everthing and this is EXACTLY what you do. 

1) Download the EURO 1.5 crack (2 RAR archives) from gamecopyworld. 

2) DO NOT TAKE the archives and Extract them into the game folder, extract them into a different folder and then take the individual files in EACH folder and put them into your directory (otherwise you will overwrite ALL of the old stuff). 

3) Once you have applied both RAR archives to the game folder. CUT and PASTE the Chaos THeory game folder (the one that you just put all that stuff into) and copy that to your C:Program files: UBISOFT folder. now saving works. Don't ask how. but it does.

,flatmongoose,2009-06-15T08:53Z,"Thanks very much for the upload! Looking forward to playing it again, it works perfectly on XP (sp3) with an older graphics card with SM 2.0 only! I used to play this game excessively on my Xbox before the big lummox died. There are no cinematics, so people new to the series (and in fact, new to this game) should probably download the original SC game first, or look for another torrent with the movie files intact to transplant them into Dopeman's folders.

It should be noted that PIRATED GAMES ARE -ALMOST NEVER- ONLINE COMPATIBLE! If you want to play this in multiplayer mode, you MUST have a valid copy of the game. HOWEVER, I can confirm that CO-OP MODE is in FULL WORKING ORDER! Yay! Just use LAN, or a program that simulates a LAN connection, such as Hamachi.

Anyway, thanks again for the upload! Good luck spying! :p"
,Roberts_The_Vile,2009-06-23T07:35Z,"This is yet another poor rip courtesy of 'dopeman.'

This time around the game is crippled by an resolvable save error. 

Whenever you attempt to save a game (or quicksave a game) you will receive the following error:

""Buffer overrun detected!

A buffer overrun has been detected which has corrupted the program's internal state. This program cannot safely continue execution and must now be terminated.""

Dopeman, you could really use some friendly advice here. Please stop compressing pre-cracked, fully installed games into .zip and .rar files. This is the cause of about 98% of the problems that people run into with these games. It would be best for you to just rip and export .iso and .cue files like everyone else. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't just ship out the DVD image files directly. It's faster, almost error-free, and infinitely more convenient.

i had no problems whatsoever even when it saved no prblem thanks again dopeman for another great torrent/rip"
,sveilleux32,2009-07-18T20:35Z,hey I solved the save error!!!  Just create a new profile (one that isnt DEFAULT).  It saves perfectly and loads without the dumb load error!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Foleri,2009-07-27T14:40Z,Reseed please. Can't get this one downloaded.
,0-LSD-0,2009-08-08T03:52Z,"Never insult the dopeman you ignorant cunt scabs. Especially you roberts_de_ville

Firstly, you'll notice the game is as bugged as a...fucking bug i guess.

I bought it on steam and it's seriously not worth shit. There's errors with saving, game play, a dead multiplayer scene, more bugs with general gameplay, multiple crashes, unlocking bugs, everything. Ubisoft are a bunch of wankers who made a half-arsed game."
,dsesin,2009-08-14T01:06Z,seed please..... only 35 kb/s

,evinaeva,2009-09-14T10:41Z,"All who have problem with SAVE
Just do that:

trustno1fox ? 2008-01-04 10:44 CET: 
ok Do what that guy tibob did with fixing the crack and everthing and this is EXACTLY what you do. 

1) Download the EURO 1.5 crack (2 RAR archives) from gamecopyworld. 

2) DO NOT TAKE the archives and Extract them into the game folder, extract them into a different folder and then take the individual files in EACH folder and put them into your directory (otherwise you will overwrite ALL of the old stuff). 

3) Once you have applied both RAR archives to the game folder. CUT and PASTE the Chaos THeory game folder (the one that you just put all that stuff into) and copy that to your C:Program files: UBISOFT folder. now saving works. Don't ask how. but it does. 

:)


Cheers $)"
,dusty122,2009-10-28T19:34Z,"very good took me 4hrs to download 
and the game is excellent!!!!!!"
,mightymilk,2009-11-01T00:26Z,"Great upload, installer is so easy to use and works.  Splinter Cell is the best series of video games, maybe ever.  Story lines are awesome, voice acting from Michael Ironside is badass and hilarious.  The whole stealth system is top notch, you'll go back and play it many times just to improve your techniques.  This and Part One are my favorite games of all time."

,TheNp42,2010-02-01T21:35Z,"Yet another amazing upload from Dopeman.  
Now I know a lot of you are having trouble with saving/loading.  This should solve it:
Go here on your comp:
Computer/OS/Program Files (x86 Program files if you have a 64-bit computer)
Create a new folder called ""Ubisoft"" and extract or copy/paste your Chaos Theory folder into said ""Ubisoft"" folder.  And it should work.  If not, get a crack from gamecopyworld.com"
