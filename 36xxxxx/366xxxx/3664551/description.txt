Format: CD, Unofficial Release

Notes: An infamous bootleg, this album
 is actually a repackaging of Mandalay's
 'Empathy' album, expertly repackaged
 and credited to Portishead.
 Even the production and songwriting
 credits are attributed to Geoff Barrow
 and Beth Gibbons, though the credits
 belong to Mandalay. The track 'Opposites'
 from Empathy has been renamed 'Pearl' here.
