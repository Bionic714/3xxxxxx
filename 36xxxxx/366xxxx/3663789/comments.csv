,vampire101,2007-06-29T16:36Z,thank you for uploading this.  i have been searching for this for a long time
[V],Kuthumi,2008-04-30T20:32Z,"I have been frustrated with the poor quality of the torrent rips of this historic film, because my old vhs recording from a TV channel dated April, 2000 is so much better. Therefore, I just bought a DVD claiming to be 'digitally remastered' from the U.S. -- only to find that it has the same bad quality. 

What sometimes happened with old films was that fresh copies were distributed to the TV channels when the film was new, and then the original decayed or was damaged, which obviously happened in this case. 

If someone of you out there discovers a good rerun of this film from a TV channel and record it unto a harddisc and rip it, you will make us all a great favour!"
