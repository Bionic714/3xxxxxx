Overview:	A remake of the Shaw Brothers' "Pursuit." Tony Leung plays Lin Chung a leader of the troops who befriends a monk Ru Chi-Shen (played by Tsui Kam-Kong) and they become brothers. General Kao's son lusts after and even tries to rape Lin's wife (Joey Wong).

On the way to trial, they try to kill him again, but the monk saves him. Lu Chien makes Kao's son kill Lin's wife. Then its all out bloodshed and revenge. Great flying Kung Fu fighting and a good plot.
