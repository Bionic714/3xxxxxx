The Commitments (book 1987, film 1991)
The Snapper (book 1990, film 1993)
The Van (book 1991, film 1997). 

I can only find the first film on TPB."

Full DVD with nordisc subs. Let's see if somebody is still seeding."
,jegg,2009-01-01T16:33Z,"I actually found The Van too:

But the torrent seems to be dead and there are no subs, possibly english."

That's a bit harsh. I can watch this movie just fine without Finnish subs, thank you very much. However, I can't say the same for my soon to turn 68 mom, for whom I sometimes seek subtitled movies. Teaching English was not a big hit when she attended elementary school."
