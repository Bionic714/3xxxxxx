,Panodilo,2007-04-10T13:07Z,"ligolas, thanks so much for the upload. I have a question. After I feed my bank's clearing number and my authorization code for the money transfer (100 euros like you said in the e-mail) the money doesn't appear to transfer. I get a pop up window telling me to resend. I've been punching it like ten times. Are you sure you gave me the right account number. Also, Norton flagged the software. Help please. :("
