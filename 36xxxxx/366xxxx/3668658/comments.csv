,Tomee114,2007-08-23T15:58Z,This game looks like Pariah :-\
,SonicComKid,2008-02-22T17:21Z,"humm.. seems that it's useing the Unreal Tournament engion, either it's the UT original or UT2004 one I'm not sure. The game is very much just a simple ripoff if UT too it seems which is dissappointing.

Something I noticed is 'very high' quality for textures and whatnot does not work, but 'high' does if anyone finds when they get in battle they can't see anything.

If curious here's the game's homepage: http://www.lighthouse-interactive.com/index.php?main=game&gid=14&chk=gCYyjVGEiA"
