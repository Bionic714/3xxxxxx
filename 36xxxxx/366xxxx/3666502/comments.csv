,Panodilo,2007-04-18T06:25Z,"Mr Keyno, I would like to thank you for this addon. I admire the speed at which you deliver this to our little fold. While I can't give you a hug in the proper sense I would like to offer a standing invitation. If you should find yourself in my part of Europe I would be honored if you would call upon me in my humble abode and piss in my mouth while my wife watches. Thank you for this incredible gift. I can't wait to get home from work (I'm a drug mule for a Russian casino entrepreneur here . At any given time I have two or three cocaine filled condoms in my stomach, but anyways...) and install this beauty. Thank you, Mr Keyno."
