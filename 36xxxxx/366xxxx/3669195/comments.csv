This is a great look into the intensity.
Also notice how the one pilot keeps asking to fire his missle. He knows when he fires it... thats all she wrote...
The lead (lead plane/pilot) almost has to kick  his wingman in the ass for him to fire the missle. That must have been one scary engagement.
Enjoy."

,Emohawk,2007-04-21T08:17Z,"Just finished listening too it now, and had to write a comment. I wish it was video as well, and not just audio, but damn, it was worht the time!

Got more of these clips ? if so, id love to hear them!

Quite funny how they talk over the com's... angels = 1000ft, and when they say ""Angels approximately 8,000"", it sounds like their chasing a space-shuttle :p

Loved it!"
,Odotoh,2007-04-22T01:52Z,"American Planes dont get shot down or engage as they did in that. That is a rare look into an engagement and is played throughout all the worlds air forces as what to do and what not to do... Like... Do not question your pilot when he says to fire a missle
/The only other flight i might be able to get audio for is a F16 that got shot down in the 80s by a SAM missle over Bosnia...
Ill go search and redeploy...
