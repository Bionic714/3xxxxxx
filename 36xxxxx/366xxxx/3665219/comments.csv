,d20knights,2009-03-14T00:07Z,"For those considering downloading this (I'm sure as a precursor to buying it) here is a little review:

This book contains updated magic items and many, many new magic items used with Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition.

It is a supplement (or ""splatbook"") that only covers non-mundane equipment in all the normal forms, and several new ones (such as weapon crystals).

This is a must-have book for anyone who plays 3.5, as I can't think of anyone who only plays non-magic campaigns.

As for the file itself, it is scanned-book quality (not a company issued e-book) but gets the job done.
