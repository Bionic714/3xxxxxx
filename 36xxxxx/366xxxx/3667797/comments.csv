,Hamurabi,2007-04-19T19:25Z,"Because this time it's not compressed. Yes you heard me right it's NOT compressed.

This clearly illustrates how retarded it is to make multipart rar archives out of video files.

1. Sometimes they become bigger (especially if a sample is included). Anyway they don't become much smaller because the videoformats are already compressed.
2. If something happens to one bit of data the multipart rar refuses to decompress whereas a small error in a videofile is usually not even noticed or at the very least can be easily repaired.
3. People who wants to keep the video file a while don't want double copies so they delete the rar files after they have downloaded and thus stops seeding wheras those who get one file often just leave it seeding since it's not using any extra space for that."

It makes sense for scene releases. Once it hits TPB I agree it makes little sense to include a sample or keep video inside the RAR archive.

> 1. Sometimes they become bigger (especially if a sample is included). Anyway they don't become much smaller because the videoformats are already compressed.

The goal isn't to reduce the size, it's to split the file into smaller chunks.

We're using the BitTorrent protocol... chunks are hashed. Unless you use a bug-ridden client you should never have problems with corrupt downloads.

You're 100% correct on this. Sadly people are not going to change... this is an old discussion."
