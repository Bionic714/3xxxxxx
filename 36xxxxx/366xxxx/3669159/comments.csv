,hurrafor,2007-07-19T19:12Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.


Install those and report back!
