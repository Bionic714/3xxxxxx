,zcorvine9,2007-04-16T10:57Z,Hello mark33.  Got seed?
,mark33,2007-04-16T20:46Z,"A swedish proverb says: Those who wait on something good will not wait in vain. So, sorry for last time, but this time I guess you and some other disappointed fellows will be pleased. Smaler size and expectations finally mett will do the job.

Behind all this lies a need to give something back for all the downloads. So I decided to upload a film and to get Tolle strait. Quite a job to find programs that worked and to find out how to seed. 
So take care everybody and be present."
,danyulx,2007-04-18T03:00Z,"Thanks a lot for this mark, x"
,zcorvine9,2007-04-18T23:48Z,"Thank you mark33, for the proverb and thank you for The Simple Truth.  The interview has a close-up/documentary quality to it.  I'll now join you and others in seeding this.

For Tolle fans who've already read his books..."
,eusuntsiva,2007-10-28T02:43Z,Sure hope that some one is still seeding this one too. Thank's!
,Farbrorvattenmelon,2007-12-11T11:56Z,"If you liked this, you?ll enjoy A New Earth, also by Tolle.

Extended recommendations, Marshall Rosenberg and Daniel Quinn."
,areare,2007-12-22T10:54Z,"Hey guys.
I don't know why I can't find any seeders while I'm downloading from this torrent, I assume?!
Please keep on seeding.
Thanks."
