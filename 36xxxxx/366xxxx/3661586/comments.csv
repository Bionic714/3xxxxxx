,neslesman,2007-04-11T19:26Z,"Thank you.

I have a question on the install.  When it says ""apply the .reg file"" does that mean to execute the file, place it in C: or Windows or just what.  I'm sure others won't be too clear on that too.

Thanks again, much appreciated."
,N537JB,2007-04-11T19:37Z,Just execute the file and click 'Yes' and then 'OK'...
,neslesman,2007-04-11T20:23Z,Thanks N53 it thought that was the case but I didnt' want to do something I may not be able to revers.
