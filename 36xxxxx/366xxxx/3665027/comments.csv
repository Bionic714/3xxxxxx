,vitamink3,2007-08-14T20:53Z,Thanks Ervonia for this great software. I think its one of the best how-to guitar software/videos for beginners I have used so far.
,double_b26,2007-09-02T05:38Z,"i need some help with this program.  i downloaded it and burnt the .iso's onto cd-r (nero verified that data was written to discs).  the problem is that i can not get it to install past the first disc.  

i put the first disc in, and ran the installation.  it worked fine.  then it prompted me to insert the 2nd disc, i did so.  the drive spins it up, but then the dialog box that asking for disc 2 comes back up.  i can open the 2nd disc and view the files in windows.  but the installation will not recognize the 2nd disc.  i tried to install the software several times.  but it always does the same thing.  

any ideas?  i was thinking that i could try to re-burn the 2nd disc.  it seems fine, but may be corrupt or a bad burn, i guess.  thanks in advance."
,Kerkku,2007-09-29T13:40Z,Same problem like double_b26. This doesent work. Stops when have to change cd2.
,Rudiandre,2007-10-01T16:47Z,"Cant get past first disc, anyone have the answer? I use d-tools"
,kungul,2007-10-19T20:31Z,"this is a great torrent.

Does anybody has a serial for blues guitar foundation ???

Thanks"
,kungul,2007-10-19T20:35Z,"I didn't burn the image to cd, just mounted with dtools and everything was fine. no problems with instalation"
,DolphWulff,2007-11-06T10:24Z,"The reason some of you guys have problems is that Ervonia is a fucking retard. These aren't ISO images of the installation discs, these are homemade ISOs where Ervonia simple threw each folder from the other ""release"" (the one with a hell of a lot of files) into each ISO. 

And, he didn't bother to put the stuff INSIDE each folder into the root of each ISO, he puts each FOLDER into the root of each ISO, meaning there's a ""Disc 1"" or ""Disc 2"" folder at the root of each disc you burn, respectively. This is a gigantic error, as the installer now expects to find the contents of disc 2 at ""[Your_CD_Drive_Letter]:\Disc 1\"", which of course it won't. Also, autorun won't work, as autorun files need to be at the root of the CD, not in some retarded ""Disc 1"" folder.

Just check the data on these ISOs: Both have creation dates that match the day of Ervonia's upload date to thepiratebay, he didn't even bother to change the volume labels on the ISOs, so for instance disc 1's label is ""20070415_1755"", i.e. the date and time! Also, the Publisher and Data Preparer strings in the ISO header say ""MagicISO v5.2 COPYRIGHT (C) 2001-2006 MagicISO, Inc."".

I don't know where this monkey got these files in the first place, but to call it ""A Proud Release by Ervonia"" makes my fists itch. It should say ""A Gay Release Stolen from Somewhere Undisclosed and Mangled by Some Einstein Would-be Releaser with an IQ of Ten"""
,DolphWulff,2007-11-06T10:48Z,"Oh, it gets even better: it seems Ervonia missed one file when creating these ISOs:

Disc 1\program files\Music Coach\Instant Play Guitar 2 CD-ROM\First Lessons For Guitar\gca022\i\4\gca022i4AGSa25a32gfWSML4AmGDuet-1.DAT

Now where did that go?"
,coolkumpel,2008-01-03T01:06Z,"Hi Dolphblaaabla,

STOP abusing pple who have done thier best to upload..prove your IQ is not 12 by posting a better ISO.
Myself got the same installation problem too but don talk bullshit"
,OblivionGlove,2008-01-11T03:57Z,"This program has completely screwed up my computer.  I tried to run it and every time I turn on my computer it asks me to insert the disk that has Chord Miner, as well as when I start some programs, despite the fact that I completely deleted the program from my computer! Can anyone tell me how to delete this completely?"
,Daker9,2008-05-19T13:38Z,"Same problem here. Opened both Disc 1 and 2 in Power ISO and then burned each onto CDs with Nero and verified. Half way through intallation it asked for Disc 2 but would not recognize it when I inserted it into the drive. 
Seems there mut be some missing files or incorrect paths on disc 2.
I spend some time trying to work around this but finally gave up"
,jv_kenshin416,2010-01-23T01:45Z,"i've had the same issues/problems that you guys were having: (when installer asks for disk 2, I insert disk 2. But then it does not auto-run). DolphWulff's assertion is correct. Ervonia should have directly copied and burned the contents (or files) from DISK 1 and Disk 2 so it would presumably autorun, instead of plainly copying the respective folders and burning it as an ISO. please do a better job next time ervonia. Thank you for your effort anyway. If it's not too much to ask, try fixing this ""minor"" issue. Best of luck. Cheers"
