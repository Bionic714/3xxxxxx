,sarapacman99,2007-06-22T12:48Z,"same question, how do we install this game? i see
the different folders but they can't run."
,slaugepua,2007-07-17T02:36Z,"I haven't d/ld the files yet. But it would appear that you need to mount the bin-images with a tool such as Daemon or so. From there on, you may install the game from an artificial CD-drive as you would a purchased game."
,slaugepua,2007-07-17T03:39Z,"Furthermore, you may need an application like lets say powerarchiver to unpack the bin-files."
,doba3,2007-08-15T01:20Z,How can I change the language
,Deadman360,2007-08-19T14:25Z,"You need 4 cds. Put cd1 in 1cd and label it. Then put cd2 folder in another cd and label it cd2. Keep doing it till it's gone.

Then, put in cd 1. And watch the installation begin. And follow the nice instruction.


Really, sad eh. HA! I got like 800 spare dvds and like 1000 spare cds that are rewirtable."

,hclivess,2008-03-29T12:39Z,"RISE OF LEGENDS PATCHING GUIDE
------------------------------

The way I did it. It may be possible some other way as well.

1. Run the game.
2. Click ""check for updates""
3. Let them download
4. Error comes up while it tries to install
5. Exit the game
6. Copy ""patch_control.xml"" and file ""transfers.xml"" patches folder in your game installation directory (""\Rise Of Legends\patches"")
7. Run patch.exe in your Rise of Legends directory
8. Let it install
9. Run the game and enjoy"

2.42 GB fucking waste of download!!!"
,KOSTAS-,2009-04-14T20:44Z,Downloads very slow
,SinningSaint,2009-04-28T07:59Z,"how do u change the language???
plz let me no..."
,arthurude,2009-09-07T03:55Z,how the fuck do you change the language?
,shuriken_619,2010-10-02T05:32Z,"I already knew it was Czech lol.But for those having problems installing follow the steps below.
1.When ur done downloading the game u will see the data which says cd1 to 4 but it can not be run.To do so u have to first download a software called WinRar.
2.It will let u extract the files to a different place(Any place will work)
3.Then u need to download a software called Daemon Tools.this will let u mount the extracted data on to a virtual drive so,that when u explore the virtual drive the setup will appear as if u had a real CD drive(Saves u 4 discs also lol).
4.I havent downloaded the game since it Czech,but since it has data that goes through Cd 1-4,its extremely recommended that u make 4 virtual drives.That way,u dont have to mount and unmount all the time.
5.When setups done just play!:)
Hope ive been helpful!"
