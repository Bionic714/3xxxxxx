,Minapa,2007-05-02T10:58Z,please seed
,Herforder_Pils,2007-05-29T15:46Z,"This is an excellent idea to put a 100% All-in-one-torrent BUT it's far too big (my Laptop has only 100GB!).
Besides, why couldn't we just upload all the episodes in a decent quality on youtube; using the same tags, information, etc.? That would be far more efficient instead of waiting a good month or longer to get the 33GB down..."
,tavisjohn,2007-07-16T06:04Z,"I would reccommend getting a REAL BitTorrent client, such as Azures.  That way you can pick and choose the exact files you want to download.

I would also reccommend getting an external HD.

I personally prefer the ALL IN ONE torrents, that way I know I have the WHOLE series.  And I have no problems sorting the files into 8 gig groups to be burnt onto dual layer DVD's."
,gringr775,2008-01-28T06:41Z,I have got it complete in two hours or so. will seed it for 2 weeks at least;-)
,LandraBlaze,2008-02-28T08:23Z,"If anyone else has this to seed, please do so. I would really like to have this anime. Thanks!"

,dork5002002,2008-05-21T08:46Z,I'm gonna download the episodes I need and then I will comment on quality.  Thanks for the torrent.
,dork5002002,2008-05-21T23:09Z,what I have downloaded so far looks good.  I'll continue to seed this after I finish it.
,dork5002002,2008-05-25T04:00Z,look like no one who actually has all of this is seeding.  WTF I wish someone would see this.
,Fantasy_Vamp,2008-06-16T21:22Z,Is there someone who wants to seed? Because I really want to see this anime... Or is there someone who knows how to seed?

,inunotaisho,2010-02-04T07:00Z,"SEED please :D
I want this one so badly x))"
,ms-dos7,2010-04-01T20:57Z,for crying out loud seed already  
,otaku_madness,2010-09-13T20:00Z,"wow, i'm guessing this is the only link to the full inuyasha set. :O from my point of view, the whole seeding problem could be from the fact that this torrent is 30gbs huge. So, it could be forever before anyone could seed this, since it takes like a month to finish downloading. I propose that people who are downloading this revise how much they take. For example, you could only download a few episodes, then let the rest seed. If you want to download it all, you should keep up this process so that everyone would get a chance. It will take longer this way, but i garentee that more people will seed this way. :) "
,Savvok,2011-01-28T20:26Z,Can someone please seed!? I really need this torrent for my girlfriend. I am stuck at 2.8% 0kbs download speed. Please seed if you have this.
,Savvok,2011-01-28T20:30Z,and before anyone asks I have tried what otaku_madness suggested. just wanted to let you know before you ask :)
,kochanneo,2011-01-29T11:04Z,Also stuck at 2.8% but if I can get this I'll seed it for a couple of months.
,Savvok,2011-01-29T19:11Z,"thank you kochanneo, I also will seed this for a while if I get it downloaded."
