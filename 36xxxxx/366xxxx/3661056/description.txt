InuYasha episode 001 - 167 + Movie 1, 2, 3 and 4
Including an extra movie 2 with attached sound in the epilogue, and movie 4 epilogue.


ALL IN JAPANESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES


Some of the episodes are mkv files, which will require a codecpack to be played. Personally I recommend CCCP (Combined Community Codec Pack).
