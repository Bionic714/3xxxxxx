,--livin--high--,2008-09-29T08:29Z,"This may sound stupid and obvious but well, i guess its not because everybody on all pokemon torrents seems to compain about speed and length time to download... Well simple solution to that people; and as i said, sounds stupid but has greatly improved my time to download... What ive done is gone www dot torrentz dot com and searched for pokemon. There are two uploaders, well 3 actually, but 2 that have uploaded the exact same files but diferent torrents. So basicly ive been downloading all my odd number3ed episodes from one torrent and my evens from the other. Ontop of this ive alos selected only the next 3 odd and next 3 even episodes for download at priority low, medium and high (i use utorrent) and as one is completed i add the next and upgrade priority for each eps. 

Sounds like alot of work, but it isnt really and when your downloading several hundred GBs you want best speeds you can and well, doing whats outlined above has cut my average download times down by more than half, and this way i can also watch the episodes as they download.

Sounds stupid i know but hey, whatever works :)"
,--livin--high--,2008-09-29T08:32Z,"oh and in adtion to my above comment, torrentz dot com is a search engine & links back to thepiratebay to actually download (only if its avalible on thepiratebay, which all pokemon just about are) and the search site also lists every tacker for the torrent, most times there are around 8-10 active trackers you can get off there in adition to whatever comes from the site you decide to download, hopfully right here on the best one in the world :)"
