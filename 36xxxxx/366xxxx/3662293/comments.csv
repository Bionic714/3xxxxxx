,timura,2007-09-09T01:14Z,I'm a newbie here and I love this show...  Can someone please seed it again??  Please?
,histumness,2007-10-07T21:15Z,FYI - It looks like what is labeled episode 14 is actually ep 15. I'm not sure if the real episode 14 is actually included but if you watch the one from this torrent and look at any episode guide you'll see that it's really number 15...
,las2312,2007-10-16T13:57Z,Will someone seed the first season?? I have the others but not the first and I want the begining...
,Sylar_66,2007-10-23T06:19Z,"Thank you Night--Lord, I´ve downloaded and watched all files. Great quality!

Except for s03e05 because of the edition of comercial breaks that cutted initial parts of following scenes. Not a big deal, but it caused some difficulties to subtitles.

I´d suggest new downloaders to deselect that file and download battlestar.galactica.s03e05.ws.dsr.xvid-crimson.3547039.TPB.torrent

Please keep seeding!"
,Flokker,2008-02-28T19:49Z,"Awesome show, when/if I complete the initial download I'll seed it indefinitely."
