This is ripped from the 2 dvd Phish: IT collection. This is disc 1 (my fav). It 

has highlights of the activities, performances and the Phish members talking about 

their music and that weekend in Limestone, Maine, August 2 & 3, 2003. I was there 

and the experience can never be totally described in words but this dvd came 

close! I will upload the rip of disc 2, which is almost entirely Phish performing, 

although there is alot of the live show on this rip, also. You'll love this 

download! It is 1.22 GB 

because I wanted it to be the best quality in video & sound. It has the original 

AC3 5.1 soundtrack and sounds awesome as long as you have a decent player where 

you can switch the audio to the 5.1. I highly recommend VLC Media Player...it 

gives you so much more control over your video:

Resolution is 672x384 which will look awesome if you burn to a dvd. Enjoy! Seed & 

I will upload the disc 2 rip within a day or so.
