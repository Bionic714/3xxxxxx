				TESTED AND WORKS
				================


Thank you alot, Emkay, for bringing us the installer :-)

This is a re-made installer created by me, when the installation is done, simply add the scenery into FS9 ;-)


Enjoy, and have some happy landings @ TNCM ;-) (Btw, don't bother asking if it's okay to share it here, because I already asked him, and he said yes!)
