,astratwin,2007-04-30T11:07Z,"Im presuming no one else has had problems with this after 292 downloads and no comments.

For some reason after extracting the file will not play on any players on my computer.

I usually test a film before burning but it shows up as an error.

Any ideas what the problem may be ?

Thank's"

My computer has lost its audio driver which is stopping any kind of cd/dvd playing"
