,somestuff,2007-04-10T18:58Z,It's M$ Student with Encarta Premium.  Been around for long time.  There IS no NON-STUDENT Encarta 2007 anywhere on the net.  Been looking for months.
,Acookie,2007-04-16T03:28Z,Can Someone plz seed
,jim83pun,2007-04-16T04:54Z,could somebody please seed...
,olav66,2007-04-17T22:39Z,"Most people have access to more than one computer, so if his breaks down every uploader have every chance to come back and tell us why we're stranded, why he does not seed his own upload.
Come on, every one knows they should not abandon their own once they've given birth to them... don't be so extremely ignorant!"
,olav66,2007-04-17T22:41Z,"Btw, my own share ratio is now more than 3:1"
,Winterpirate,2007-04-18T19:00Z,why upload a torrent if you aint gonna seed it?

,high.5,2007-04-25T00:01Z,"Checked your h33t link but only found this
http://www.h33t.com/details.php?id=df0be7bdd8a29dec24a517bf2dbf73f64608848f
which seems to be the same ""Student"" version as all the others"
,jim83pun,2007-04-25T05:29Z,"Since the sole seeder seems to have run away, dont worry..You can download the remaining part of the file by simply downloading any torrent containing the same iso(same size)...just add the new torrent and replace the new iso image with the one that you have partly downloaded..A checking will be performed and the downloading will continue from where you were stuck...I have followed this technique and it is working...In any case as soon as i finish downloading the iso, i will seed it to the this tracker...So dont worry.."
,mistic dragon,2007-04-28T05:33Z,I dont know if the torrent will install but i found a link with 9+ seeders http://www.h33t.com/torrents.php?search=Encarta&category=7&active=1
,omkleem,2007-05-02T10:56Z,"Download is quite fast. I had 56 seeders.
This one is in English. Just mount and install."
,astra12,2007-05-02T15:30Z,"There is a NON student version of 2007 but it's 25 Rapidshare links. I have them if anyone wants to download it and the make it available here.

,Kjellemann1980,2007-07-02T23:25Z,"How do I make it run?
When I try to start it it just starts up a program for burning cd's and dvd's. What's up with that?"
