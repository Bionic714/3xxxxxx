,DarkKnight2007,2007-07-07T19:53Z,"It's about time that Fucktoon Network released this on DVD, but this torrent is an excellent second best option."
,loveSilverfang,2007-08-05T20:45Z,vad krävs för att ladda ner detta då ? \ BitComet and BitLord are banned \\

,saisumimen,2008-05-31T17:06Z,"@Alarik88:

The better question is: What fucked up retarded son of a bitch uses an outdated piece of shit bittorrent client that doesn't follow the rules and breaks the specs?"
,TorrentMonster,2008-06-02T22:24Z,is this all the series?
,TorrentMonster,2008-06-02T22:26Z,or is this a movie?
,gameric3,2008-07-09T04:25Z,"Thank god, I have looked everywhere for this!"
,MageHeart,2008-10-10T23:36Z,"Daaamn. This show was actually pretty cool. It was funny as hell sometimes. Thanks, dude. That's ANOTHER 4-5GB I have to download. That leaves me with around 30-40 I have queued. This'll take ages."
,markopalma,2008-10-20T21:53Z,Please seed more people...i really want this ;) 
,iamkid,2008-11-02T04:55Z,"thank you so much, i was just talking about this on a bus with a friend while we were having an hour long conversation about childhood memories, and i just had to get this show"
,AceSe3don,2008-12-04T17:36Z,Good upload but they don't work after like 10 days!!!!
,RougeNetNavi,2009-01-20T05:53Z,"I'd follow through with your request, but I have no idea how to kick peers with uTorrent."
,emiliux,2009-01-28T13:56Z,"Hey thanks 4 the episod3s, they rock !!! If anyon3 is l00king 4 som3 fun they should r333aly download this stuff.. ;D"
,bizzybody,2009-03-20T07:27Z,"Made of coolness. :) Now if only someone could find all of season 1 in 640x480 resolution.

Hmmm, I wonder if the torrent with the non-English verbiage in the title and no description is all the same resolution and higher quality, without hard subs?

I could do some demux/mux action and swap the audio tracks if the other pack has Spanish or something else. ;)"
,Harlequin_Felis,2009-04-24T20:25Z,"@BizzyBody
I thought this torrent had season 1? Makes sense - the season one torrent is approx. 2 GB, this one says S1&2, and is about 4 1/2GB.... I'd take a gamble and say Mike here has all the episodes you need - even the ones with Bruce Campbell :P"
,mr.hagen,2009-06-16T23:18Z,why do you request all seeders to ban bitcom/bitlord? it doesnt make any sense to me...
,fallout11,2010-04-30T20:47Z,Thank you for uploading these.
,XxSTICH666xX,2010-05-18T15:22Z,I've seeded 141gigs so far. I'm going to keep this seeding as long as possible or until CartoonNetwork gets their heads out of their asses and releases this on DVD.
,epic420,2010-12-29T13:53Z,hey mike just wanted to ask why do you hate bitcomet?
,Maniac379,2011-04-20T02:13Z,"I don't usually comment but I have to say major thanks for this, I rememebered this show from toonami years back and decided to look for a torrent and here it is so =D"
,kiill123,2011-07-23T19:44Z,getting this cuz chicks dig giant robots
