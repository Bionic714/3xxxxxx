A gamer gearhead and his slacker buddy find a giant robot and, of course, customize the purple-snotted crap out of it. I mean, wouldn't you? Trouble is, a "space chick" from the future had originally stole the thing from a bunch of green-tentacled aliens and then sent it back into the past to avert a war humanity lost, and overshot the destination date by about a thousand years. The M.E.G.A.S. lost its mech-head along the way, which naturally meant that the only suitable replacement was a 70's muscle car with game-controllers running all the widgets. 

Let the wacky hijinks and complete devastation ensue.
