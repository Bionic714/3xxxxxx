,StingZ,2007-10-09T22:31Z,"Sogat_, Why do people continue to post uneducated comments. Look things up - Research, before posting.

.bat files (or Batch files) are little files normally hovering around 5-300kb depending on the amount of text/scripts that it contains. These files can be dangerous - But that doesn't mean they're not safe some of the time.

For example - Dopemans .bat files unpack the .uha's which are compressed files using Uharc, and then adds the needed information to the registry. So, you see, you accused someone wrongly.

To check what the .bat file does, all you have to do is open notepad, drag the .bat file to the notepad window, and the scripts in there pop up."
,StingZ,2007-10-09T22:34Z,"Ahh. Sorry, I got carried away in the last comment and forgot to thank dopeman for giving us this fix.

I downloaded your NFSMW a while ago, and got frustrated because it kept spanking the monkey and exiting. Finally, I searched for more of your rips on here and found the fix :D.

Just need some more seeders is all."
