,divingfinatic,2007-10-07T02:51Z,"You guys asked for it, so you got it: DVD 2 of Mr. Ed is ON!  "
,missjenniferd,2007-11-04T23:45Z,"this only has episodes 9-13, do you have episodes 1-8? it must be on the other side of the disc?"
,divingfinatic,2007-11-12T04:55Z,"Missjenniferd, I had no idea there was an issue with this disk. Let me ask other downloaders:  has anyone else had a problem burning or watching Episodes 1-8 of Mr. Ed disk One?
If I can get some feedback on whether the problem is mine or with Missjenniferd, I can fix it if the problem is on my end."
,kbl247,2007-11-15T20:32Z,"hi divingfinatic.

first of all, thx a lot for your effort.
unfortunately i have to confirm missjenniferds statement.
i ran the files from my notebook and i also burned a dvd.....

but i could only find episodes 9-13.
"
,divingfinatic,2007-12-29T11:55Z,"I'm gonna take a cue from those two comments that only episodes 9-13 can be found. Probably my screw-up. For Ed-heads, you just gotta see the first eight episodes!
So I will use DVD Decrypter to re-do this first Mr. Ed disk.
Sorry for messing it up and cheating you guys out of Mr. Ed talking to Wilbur for the first time."
,steve442,2008-04-11T22:29Z,"divingfinatic, are we ever going to see episodes 1-8?"
,critters30,2008-06-24T02:03Z,"Did you ever get around to redoing disk 1? I downloaded this one, and thanks, great download, but would love to have the full dvd."
,Notorious_DIE,2008-07-27T18:41Z,"If at all possible, could you please add the first half.  My daughter has absolutely fallen in love with Mr. Ed, and she's the worlds biggest skeptic!  I had only watched a few episodes previously, but have been in stitches waiting for more!  Thanks for the last part but could you finish the first part!?  Just flip the disk!  Thakns in Advance,"
,Notorious_DIE,2008-07-27T18:43Z,"P.S. I've been helping to re-seed this specific torrent for thanks, so that others could enjoy.  Could we get the first part so my family and I could enjoy as well?!"
,MissTrisBliss,2010-02-09T23:41Z,"Hi there,

Huge horse freak here! Love Mr. Ed!

Got this torrent, but can only find 9-13, as the others mentioned...anyone know where to get the first 8 episodes (or how to get them to work, if it's just a glitch)? Also, I think it would definitely be better with DVDDecrypter (IMO); VOB formats are kind of confusing to utilize, even using VLC Media Player.

It did take a long time to download, but I'm happy to seed for awhile - I always seed at least to 400% minimum; I'll be happy to seed for longer if I can see the first episodes! Pretty please....  ^.^"
,MissTrisBliss,2010-02-09T23:45Z,"PS: I notice this is a 'best of' collection...does anyone have a lead on where to find the *complete* series?

Thanks!"
,Sysop62,2010-11-30T04:13Z,"Hi,
Yes also many thanks from me in name of my daughter who is a very dear horse fan, and from me who whatched this series with much pleasure when I was a little kid  .. and now again, i hope, if I'm able to download this torrent ...
Thanks once again !"
,bellarmine,2011-06-15T10:43Z,"Hi folks,

Guess what?  I've found torrents for Complete Mr Ed Seasons 1 and 2 on D-e-m-o-n-o-i-d.me (remove the dashes.....:^)
'Mister Ed Season 1 (1961)'
'Mister Ed Season 2 (1961-1962)'

Search for     Mister Ed


And 1 episode of Season 4:
'Mr. Ed S04E21 Mae West Meets Mr. Ed'

Search for     Mr Ed mae west


If anyone downloads these, maybe they could upload the torrent files to TPB, so everyone else can get at them.............:^)

Cheers!"
,gbcx,2011-07-10T17:36Z,Still no eps 1-8!!!  Anyone have a source for the corrected torrent? (divingfinatic said he'd fix it in Dec 2007....)
