,neuroPuff,2007-04-21T23:09Z,"Little Fingers, I think the greater good of humanity/TPB would benefit from you sharing this educational VLK with other users. Since Microsoft looks the other way with colleges, like you point out in your torrent's notes, I'd assume this wouldn't be a problem. Right, bud?"
,johnroberts,2007-04-26T03:41Z,a.k.a. MSDN AA :-) I had a look and there is even legit Vista Business to download...Pitty I don't have the bandwidth...:-(
,neuroPuff,2007-04-26T14:58Z,"Vista is a steaming pile of shit anyway, John. You're better off waiting for service pack 1 to come out later this fall."
,bevestallmer,2007-04-29T05:05Z,"I tried this on my friend's laptop yesterday and it installed without problems. :-) IE7 didn't get autoinstalled though for some reason, but it's okay since she prefers Firefox anyway.

Everything else was just as advertised. The extra media players were a nice touch, we watch many videos here.

Excellent torrent, A++ will seed again"
,rafoody,2007-05-09T21:44Z,"HI evry1 , guys can anybody tell me how to SEED after the download is complete? cuz many people say (SEED after download) , and im new in here , so can anybody please tell me? 
thanx "
,neuroPuff,2007-05-10T00:13Z,Most torrent clients automatically seed the torrent after the file is done downloading -- doing this is the generous and cool thing to do. :P
,rafoody,2007-05-11T01:39Z,"Oh , thanx neuro , and thanx again for this version , i've tried it , and its doin great , great job. "
,strokeny,2007-05-27T06:07Z,"This has got to be one of the best XP installs out there! I almost need to do no configs at all! I was a fan of TinyXP but no more! Im gonna check your edition 2.
