Mercenaries! A Train! Psycho with a Swastika! Rod Taylor machinegunning machismo! Yvette in a torn shirt! Mandingo stud Jim Brown at his ovulate-when-I-smile best! Assorted pasty-faced victims and disaster movie cliches who telegraph their eventual demise! Millions in diamonds behind a time-lock that won't open as genocide-minded rebels close in!
