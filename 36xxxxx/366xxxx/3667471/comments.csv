,relais,2007-04-18T23:57Z,Thanks mike18xx. Haven't seen this in years.
,mellimou,2007-05-02T01:24Z,Thanks for this! Have not seen since the 60s. Does anyone know of there is an original theatrical release available out there? (100+ mins)?
,mike18xx,2008-02-04T08:37Z,"100m PAL 25fps or 100min NTSC 23.976fps?

""Cheap"" PAL transfers just speed up the track, and the film is shorter. (I forget what's in this torrent.)"
,Deputy276,2008-05-06T17:59Z,Video 7/audio 9. Great merc movie!!!! Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux teamed together again after The Time Machine. Hard to find an original version. When released to VHS they were edited for violence. I think this is an edited one. But still worth downloading.
