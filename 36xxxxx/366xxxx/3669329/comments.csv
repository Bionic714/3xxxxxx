,piook,2007-07-09T02:45Z,"I am sorry Lost my computer and had to restor the original. As soon as I can I will reseed this.
To that end. as long as I have the original .torrent file and all of the episodes I can reseed it, right?"
,piook,2007-07-09T05:41Z,I have reseeded it and hope to keep it up for a long time to come.
,Bntyhntr,2007-08-01T09:16Z,"Baka-Anime subbed Gundam Wing in much higher quality.  I don't know if it's still around anywhere, I have them all though, so I know it exists.   In case anyone was wondering about the existence of a sub.
Still, this one works and it's in a playable format."
,angeskog,2007-08-26T02:25Z,"Thanks alot piook!
I have already downloaded 11.4 gig of this serie but in Jap lang. and i do think i like it in eng dub more......but who knows.
Thanks!!!"
,angeskog,2007-08-26T02:35Z,"Besides u just helped me to not spend 140$ on discshop, so thanks buddy."
,Physical_Specimen,2007-08-30T18:47Z,I am having trouble playing these files on Windows Media Player. I get the audio portion but I cant figure out how to get any video. any suggestions?
,Hyperpolysyllabic,2007-08-31T07:11Z,"Do you have all the proper codecs? DiVx specifically. Also, try not using WMP, as it tends to be leary of movies it's not familiar with. VLC or Winamp is fine, though."
,Arsanic,2007-09-04T05:39Z,Seeds please!!! there are about 12 people connected and all but one is seeding
,Cinematic7,2007-10-29T03:42Z,Is it possible to obtain more seeds? It would really be a great help! Thanks! ^_^
,netfoo,2007-11-18T01:02Z,"Could some more people with completed downloads have some mercy and for the love of god seed this already?!?

six hours into it and no seeds.

Please, I'm trying to find some old favorites of mine and since no one here is complaining about his torrent I assume it's good quality. My sister and I really liked the show and  this is a perfect opertunity to get it while saving movie that we probubly couldn't spend in order to get these episodes.

Thnx."
,tolsyoy,2007-11-20T00:12Z,would someone please seed
,netfoo,2007-11-20T07:36Z,"Ya...Every single one of these episodes is either corrupted or spazzes out with really weird colored cubes that litterally make it impossible to watch. I think, however, that this was because something in the downloading prossess got messed up and I'll repost when I've redownloaded the files."
,Boottleg,2008-01-10T18:30Z,"More seeders please? anybody?

Thx"
,General_Shuda,2008-02-24T17:00Z,"Calling all Gundam Wing fans! We need seeders badly!
