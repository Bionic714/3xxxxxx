"Despite this title,this 1981 album was never actually released to
the public for a fast buck..Andre Jacquiem,who put together much of
the Python's album work,cobbled this album together from material
which had been recorded for other albums (mostly The Contractual Obligation
Album)but not used..It was given by Michael Palin to the band Motorhead as a gift,
and found its was,unofficially,into the hands of fans,but has never been sold
in stores."

Highlights for me are the "Otto" segment & "Psychopath",both written
for Life Of Brian but not used...and also "Memory Training",an older
skit with a new ending - Graham Chapman rattling off names of towns
where Life Of Brian was banned!
