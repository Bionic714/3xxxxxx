,tallviking,2007-04-11T22:06Z,Program is asking for activation code !!!???
,420dopeman,2007-04-11T22:23Z,"Not sure why, but here's a couple.
As with all pirate releases, you should not allow it to connect to the net.

Some codes:

4HUR-56AS-7JND-F3AH 
1HQG-HMTD-M3X2-6W1H"
,granib,2007-04-13T14:58Z,cool game
,lani27,2007-04-13T21:18Z,mine is asking for an activation key? :S anyone help?
,Bluepowder,2007-04-14T11:05Z,"Seriously guys, does this work? 
ps. SEED PLEASE"
,Baz70,2007-04-14T14:02Z,"only get CTD :(
anyone know why??????"
,Baz70,2007-04-14T14:46Z,"Is there any particular path or drive this needs to be unzipped too???
I only get CTD...."
,420dopeman,2007-04-14T15:11Z,"No, I actually run mine from an external drive.

What's your system specs?

Also do you have april version of DX9?"
,Baz70,2007-04-14T17:18Z,"No I, my directX was obsolete, updated it, and now it works....Yeeeehaaa...THANX Man :)"
,bukan4sli,2007-04-15T00:28Z,"CTD, downloaded dx9c, any idea dopeman? "
,Baz70,2007-04-15T02:39Z,"Well...Adam wasnt, as we all know, in paradise for long......TDU worked 1 time after the directX update, but now...only CTD.
I also re-started the machine a gazillion times, with the same result..CTD

PC Spec. P4 3.2MHz Geforce6800GT 1.5 Gb RAM"
,420dopeman,2007-04-15T02:57Z,"Ok, anyone with CTD try go here below:

http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest

select this game in the drop-down menu, do the test.

I'm not doubting anyones system, but ya never know. Its alway worh a shot. This is a good site to test your system for games.

Also, be sure to not adjust TDU's default settings, the game sets GFX and configs automaticly to your system. If you try to change it will not run properly, if anyone has done this, unrar again and start over, also delete the Test Drive Unlimited folder in you my documents. The folder is put there after the running of the game once. Try delete that, and start over.

good luck.

also a good thread on this rip on mininova website. Search for the torrent there, and you may find some other troubleshooting ideas in the comments sections where persons that had trouble were able to get it going.

cheers.
-dopeman

cheers."
,420dopeman,2007-04-15T03:04Z,"btw Baz70,

we needs to get adam back to paradise for sure, must better there for him then CTD.
Cheers mate,
I like your sense of humour. Gave me good laugh, thanks.

Hope ya get it going."

,Baz70,2007-04-17T16:44Z,"I dunno what I`ve done, I cant find my way back to paradise.
If I delete everything, including the folders in my documents, it works again, but only till I exit the game, then it is the same shit all over again..CTD...and I havent touched the options menu either....anyone else xperience the same prob.?  "

My system specifications is way above the recommended ones, so I didn't expect anything else.

BUT, I got one major problem though.
I get the message ""TDU servers is unavailable"".
They was available for like a few hours, after that they haven't been available any more.

As this is a copied version, I didn't expect the online function to work. But as it worked in the start, why did it suddenly not work any more?

Is this download supposed to work online?"

,monstert,2008-03-17T11:31Z,"Thankyou for sharing dopeman!

This game does work guys so stop screaming that it doesnt! Fix up and use your brains.

All it needs to polish things off is Dopeman's 1.66a update which you can get here.
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3748943/[PC]_Test_Drive_Unlimited_v.1.66_UPDATE_PATCH_[dopeman]

For the noobs with shit computers, stop asking stupid questions if it will work or not or do a fecking google search.

Below is how shit my computer is and i can still run it on max settings minus the HDR tick box!

AMD Athlon 64 3200+ (standard clock rate), 2 Gig Corsair DD400 , Nvidia Nforce 3 mobo, Nvidia 6600GT 256mb AGP, 2 x 200Gb Maxtor IDE HDDs.

exactly my system is old school and it still runs this pretty sweet!

LOL i cant believe how much dudes struggle to unzip, make a directory ""Atari/Test Drive Unlimted"" in program files, cut and past the TDU shiznits, run the game and input a password. Seriously if u find that difficult i'd be giving up with computing ROFL..wtf who let you dudes loose on a computer anyway?!

Oh and for the noobs that are screaming ""where's the CD key?"" ..did you ever think to read the very first page sherlock?"

It's a great game but like GTA4, it is a bad port to PC.

1. Shut off Game Port in Device Manager:
press ""Windows"" key + ""Pause"" (Break) key together. Go to ""Hardware"" tab. Click ""Device Manager"". Expand ""Sound, Video, and Game Controllers"". Look for something with ""Game Port"" in the name. Right click it, select ""Disable"" and confirm.

2. Set OS resolution to 800 x 600 x 32.
Right click desktop, select ""Properties"", go to ""Settings"" tab, set resolution to 800 x 600 @ 32-bit.

3. Start with ""TestDriveUnlimited.exe"" and you will probably CTD, but the game is still running in the taskbar. Click it, enter 4HUR-56AS-7JND-F3AH and everything should work.

A quick question to the Dopeheads: what file could I edit to prevent having to fix resolution every time? Your work is appreciated, youre welcome for a smoke.

,2007excalibur2007,2011-02-14T13:24Z,"@black22 Oh yeah, it's a virus alright, just like every other freaking RAR torrents that you find in this site. /sarcasm >_>;

Seriously, you need to learn when NOT to trust your own antivirus. Nowadays even clean torrents like this one are considered malwares/viruses by almost every antiviruses that exist, due to how strict their virus-detecting policies are."

,skulldragon,2011-06-12T01:52Z,"Thanks!
Works, but with minor lag on P4HT, 3GB DDR1 RAM, 512MB NVIDIA 8400GS.

To people, who don't bother themselves with reading the previous comments:

* No Radio, since no MP3 files included.
* You can get the Auth Key from Serials.ws
* To fix audio, get a Registry fixer or add TDU entry to registry manually.
Then update to 1.66, also install Mega car pack - you can use TDU's Auth Key.
Finally, go to GameCopyWorld and download the fixed 1.66 no-CD EXE.

Now you should have up to date and working TDU, without radio of course.
Sorry, I can't be more detailed, since TPB doesn't support some input."

,likeabossD111,2011-07-21T12:57Z,Works great on Win 7 64 bit
,Drkpl8,2011-08-08T15:27Z,"Dont hope for anything..

Just download, and extract the shit!

I've done it now FOUR FUCKING TIMES :

WinRAR - works

latest 7zip - works

Peazip - Works

WinACE - Works..

You guys are real morons, if you CANT get it work :)

This is how to get the Patch 1.66 working PLUS the Carpack..

(well THIS is how I did it!)

1) Extract it to C:\Program Files\Atari\Test Drive unlimited

2) Run a Registry Fixer (or add TDU manually to the reg, if you know how to handle things with regedit)

The reg fixer will scan for registry problems etc. and will ad TDU to the registry (which you can access by : Start --> run ---> regedit)

3) Apply the 1.66 patch and afterwards run the megapack.exe.. I first installed the megapack, and THEN i applied the 1.66 patch (since its the human logic, that it must work, because if a legit player dlles the megapack and after 2 months a patch is out, the patch would have to be applyable after the megapack)


Even though some user here already explained it, i wanted to push it, and be more detailed..."
