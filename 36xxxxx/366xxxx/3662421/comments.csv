,420dopeman,2007-04-16T23:52Z,"all you need to do is first unrar.

Then you will see a file caleed setup.bat
double-click it. Sit back for a bit as the game will dcompress and appear before your eyes in the folder.

Dont 'touch' anything while this is happening.

After that, simply double-click Xenus.exe
and game will start.

If you recieve error, game most likely did not decompress properly.

Delete anything in the folder and start over from the original .7z file.

hope that helps."
,420dopeman,2007-04-16T23:55Z,"sorry I meant start over from rar. not .7z file .

just click on one of the .rar files to unrar in to a folder of your choice.

Game never actually needs to be ""installed"""

,heavenzmovi3,2008-07-19T10:12Z,"excellent upload; everything works as promised, BUT.. a word of warning to others. don't D/L this game unless you're SURE your PC can handle it. despite the fact that it was released in 05', it still has steep system requirements; i'm not able to max it out with my 7800GT."
,Nummer,2008-07-29T18:44Z,I can't find the Setup.bat
,ViggoB,2008-08-14T20:00Z,"thank you for the warning heavenz, but I'll trust my 8800 to do the job."
,Wormicle,2008-08-28T01:57Z,Heh
,Wormicle,2008-08-28T01:58Z,"Remember, kiddies, www.systemrequirementslab.com is your friend."
,Vadigor,2008-09-12T14:29Z,"Make sure you modify the installation .bat so you get rid of the ""del x"" lines otherwise it'll get rid off the install files, which is quite fucking annoying. Who the hell creates a one-use rip in the first place? ..."

,haws1290,2012-03-06T20:48Z,sorry aint fake i didnt extract the 7z.exe so files couldnt extract and it just ended
,DjChrisEvis,2012-05-03T20:27Z,FUCK YOU.... WHY THA FUCK ARE YOU DOING THIS AT THE HARD WAY. MOTHERFUCKER
,skulldragon,2012-07-21T07:25Z,"Well it works fine. Tho the excess extracting sure was pointless. Could have just packed the whole game into one 7z instead rather than waste time on pointless BAT file and custom 7z extraction?

Game is retarded and has many many many bugs.
Even dopeman.exe is retarded."
