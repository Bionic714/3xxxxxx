Robin Lane had sang in Neil Young's backup band and worked as a session singer/musician before putting together this Boston-based band in the late 70's. They enjoyed a mild amount of success, especially in New England, and they had two videos in rotation during the early days of MTV, including airplay during the first day of broadcasting.
I remember seeing this band live at my college shortly after this album came out. Guitarist Asa Brebner collapsed on stage and was carried off. They continued the show, with Robin stating that "he had a pinched nerve in his hand". A fine example of rock excess in the early 80's.
If there's any interest, I'll rip their follow up (and final) album. They also released a live EP as well during their tenure on Warner Bros.
This is a vinyl rip at 320 kpbs, as none of their material was ever released on CD. I did my best to get the pops and cracks out.
Enjoy and seed.
