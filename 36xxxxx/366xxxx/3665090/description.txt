Up until now, the workouts I have uploaded have been more for intermediate and advanced users. I wanted to begin sharing the workouts I used when I first began working out--workouts many other people swear by--Leslie Sansone's Walk Away The Pounds series. 

This DVD contains two workouts. The first is a 1-mile walk called Get Up and Get Started. The second is called High Calorie Burn 2 Miles. 

Here is an excellent description/review I found of the DVD on Amazon: 

Leslie Sansone won herself a whole new audience with the Walk Away the Pounds DVDs. These workouts are a wonderful way to get fit for people of all ages and fitness levels. This DVD features the 1-mile walk and the 2-mile walk. This DVD is the perfect introduction to Leslie's walking workouts. 

The moves are very simple: 
- knee lifts 
- kick backs 
- side steps 
- kicks 
- and of course, walking 

The 1-mile walk runs 20 minutes. The 2-mile walk runs 31 minutes. If you're just getting started, these workouts will fit into anyone's schedule! 

Once you've mastered the basic steps, she helps to create more intensity by stepping out further, squatting into the moves, and using light weights. While she promotes the "Walk Away Weights" in the DVD, light hand weights (2 - 3 pounds) can be substituted, just be sure to watch your form. 

A helpful meter appears along the way, to show you just far you've walked. Leslie's warm demeanor and encouragement really keep you motivated to make it to that 1 mile or 2 mile marker. The other outstanding motivator in these workouts is her walking group: real people! Deb is in her 50's, Randy is an older man, a new mother, and women in their 20's and 30's round out the walkers. 

The workout can be customized to fit your lifestyle, and that is one of it's greatest features. When you're looking to work harder, squat down, push yourself, and use the weights. On days that you're just not feeling 100%, skip the weights and still get a great cardio workout. 

If you enjoy working out at home, this is a must-have workout. Thank you Leslie! 

I have six Leslie Sansone DVDs I plan on uploading. Enjoy!
