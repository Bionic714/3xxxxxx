I am not chinese, so I ask for more information from the uploader."

,hurrafor,2007-05-26T17:41Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

I don't know why HDTV China switched from MPG2 to VC-1, but VC-1 is a PAIN in the ASS!"
