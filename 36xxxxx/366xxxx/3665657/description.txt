FairUse4WM - a WM/DRM removal program and FairUse Commander, an improved front end.

FairUse4WM is a GUI version of drmdbg that supports individualization version .3930 and some WM11 versions.

FairUse Commander is an improved  FU4WM front-end.  
*It will save your path settings
*It will batch up calls to FairUse so it will call it 1 time for X files (in some cases it may have to make multiple calls to FairUse)
*It allows you to specify a separate output path
*It allows you to delete the original encrypted files (assuming you use the seperate output path)
*It has the option to keep or remove the NoDRM prefix.

Although the program will strip the DRM from any PlaysForSure file, whether you've purchased or just rented the song, it's your responsibility to ensure fair use of this program and your music. While there isn't support for license expiration/rental detection, please don't use this to abuse rental licenses.
