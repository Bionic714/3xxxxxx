,W1Ck3dYoungMan,2008-06-14T09:39Z,"This is a brilliant game. I have no idea what language it is in but it isn't Russian. That is not any form of Cyrillic i recognise.

Anyone know how to change the language by any chance?

,W1Ck3dYoungMan,2008-08-12T00:46Z,"I take back my earlier comment, The loader/installer is in some very odd language. Likely computer babble, The rest of the game is largely in Russian, with a few ingame voices in english, some of the russian is close enough to english to be recognisable, but on the other hand it's very annoying when you accidently click delete profile as opposed to continue...

I have no idea if it's possible to change the language in game, anyone else discovered anything like this?"
