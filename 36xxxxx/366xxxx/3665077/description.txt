Robert Wise - The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951 Pro-Globalisation Propaganda Movie)

The Day the Earth Stood Still is a 1951 science fiction film that tells the story of a humanoid alien who comes to Earth to warn its leaders not to take their conflicts into space, or they will face lethal consequences.

Produced in the aftermath of World War II, the start of the Cold War, the first atomic bombs and the competitive development of the hydrogen bomb, and the dawning of the Space Age, it strongly and iconically reflected the cultural fears of the time related to violence, politics, and possible global annihilation, if the trend of humanity towards weapons of war and conflict continued.

It stars Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe, Billy Gray, Frances Bavier, and Lock Martin. Supporting cast includes journalist Drew Pearson. The movie was adapted by Edmund H. North from the story "Farewell to the Master" by Harry Bates, and directed by Robert Wise. The score was written by Bernard Herrmann and is notable for its use of two theremins.
