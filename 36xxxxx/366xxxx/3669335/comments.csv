,Demonsoul98,2008-06-20T19:21Z,"Sorry for being such a neat freak, but I like all my music as just  -  and all the info in the Right-click details part. Why does no one upload discographies like this? It's awfully annoying looking at the song name."
,Demonsoul98,2008-06-20T19:22Z,"And...of course it screwed up my last comment. I meant to say Band - Song. And also, the torrent is great, just needs some renaming. Looks like I'll be doing it myself. Thanks though."
