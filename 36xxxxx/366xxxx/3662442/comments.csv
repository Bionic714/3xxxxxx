,55xmax,2007-04-15T06:42Z,"Sound is good, The movie too (if you are blind)even this copy."
,Toyfreek,2007-04-15T11:49Z,"while I know that cams are not great quality, I watch them anyway if I cant wait to see the film.
This release has a very big problem...
not the quality its ok for a cam... not the sound again ok for a cam....
but the guy that recorded it zoomed in so far that much of the movie is cut out around the edges making it really hard to figure what is going on and his focus is way off.
so you see about 35% of the film and it is really blury especially on my lcd projector. wait for another release this one is just not worth it at all.
Thanx TF"

""So, why are YOU on here mr fancy pants?"" you ask?

Cause having to wait X months before a movie comes out on a plastic disc I dont want bugs me. 

I dont mind the money - I can pay. 

To would be downloaders: this recording blows. The cam-person blocks the lens - the WHOLE lens - like a total of 4-5 minutes... on (what I can only presume are) the good parts.

Free shit... is still shit."
,j35p3r,2007-04-23T20:53Z,"DO NOT download this torrent!

The quality is bad

And the idiot with the cam is blocking the lens like 10 times... "
,DrChandra,2007-04-26T21:27Z,"speaking of balls, would be fun is some of these bootleggers were more creative in the way they rip the video than simply a crappy handicam in a theatre. perhaps sneaking in and installing some kind of telecine device on a projector somewhere and a wireless tv transmitter on it so they could fully automatically rip all movies as they come out. even go beyond that to have more sources and compare the data to look for watermarks in the video and remove it so they  can't be pinpointed"
