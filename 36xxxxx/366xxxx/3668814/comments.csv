Fortinet	2.85.0.0	04.21.2007	suspicious
eSafe	7.0.15.0	04.19.2007	suspicious Trojan/Worm

Now when I tested it. But that doesn't even mean that it's containing a virus. I Have no problem with it anyway and antivirus can just react on the program itself and not a virus.

,crypto2000,2007-05-01T21:06Z,"This torrent is bullshit.
Only a couple of teams have worked on a ""fix"" for AnyDVD: CRUDE (CRD), Black Riders (BRD), RESURRECTiON (by rESin), Dr.Pc Putte and a couple of others.
ZWT has *NEVER* cracked/patched/keygenned AnyDVD.

And the text in the NFO is clearly from the BRD release.
Basically, don't download this fake crap.
This torrent should be deleted."
