The Maids is a 1949 play by the French writer Jean Genet.
 The story can be read as an absurdist exposition on the intricate power dynamic
 that exists between unequals.
 Solange and Claire are two housemaids who construct elaborate sadomasochistic
 rituals when their mistress (Madame) is away.
