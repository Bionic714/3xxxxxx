,Kimmel,2008-01-23T22:54Z,"This game works just fine, if you have a Mac.. Just download it and place it in the Application-folder - and double click.. Voi-fucking-lรก.. 

It works in Mac OS Tiger + Leopard.. And ffs, it's an old game, every laptop made in this millenium will drive it flawless.. 

The controls are a bit tricky, though.. ;) "
