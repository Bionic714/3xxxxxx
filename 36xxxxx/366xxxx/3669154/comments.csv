,emiliotuur,2007-12-09T19:58Z,"I don't know why, but today I wanted to play a game. Guess what, no audio. So I tried a few things, played a differend movie and a few MP3's. But with those, audio worked fine. 

So I tried Stargate again, and audio worked. 

I guess it was some kind of glitch yesterday and this morning."
