,bigmoggy,2007-04-13T20:22Z,"Hi there
A question about the image (mds), it's 5.14 GB and then do I need a DL DVD for the burning of that or does it fit by some magic trick to a normal 4.7 GB DVD?
/Moggis"
,bigmoggy,2007-04-13T20:24Z,"OOPS it's the mdf not mds
/M"
,xXxRessurecTxXx,2007-04-13T21:13Z,"bigmoggy 
You will need a DL DVD to burn it, thats if you dont want to just mount it with Daemon Tools or PowerISO or something. Yes the retail game is a DVD DL no matter what version you get."
,bigmoggy,2007-04-13T21:42Z,"OK 
It's that way I believed it was.
The question is mostly a backup issue so it may be done by som winrar actions.
THX for upload and quick response for my Q.

4. Apply crack by copying the ""RetailExe"" folder to the game's directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Command & Conquer 3\ YOU COPY RetailExe Folder HERE and press OK/Yes to all/Continue WHATEVER)

,raiden395,2007-06-25T08:31Z,"to DarnBoy, just use winrar to ""package"" the file.  winzip can be used also.  Just select all the files and select send to (insert anything) archive."
,DarnBoy,2007-06-25T10:10Z,raiden. I think you will need to re-install the auzeures. And by the way you can find the file in the my documents and then the azureus downloads. that's at least where i keep my files.

,raiden395,2007-06-25T14:58Z,"Thanks for the suggestion DarnBoy, but I'm afraid it's far less simple than that.  I'm getting this overwhelming suspicion that my Azureus now contains a virus.  I've uninstalled it several times now, as well as java.  It's still having the same problem.  Oh well, time to fuck with it for a while and see what happens."
,raiden395,2007-06-25T15:01Z,"to m4ddog, it's probably not your connection settings as I've never altered mine when downloading, yet I get an average of around 80Kb/s.  If you're using Azureus it could be that your internet or connection (hardware-wise) isn't fast enough, as Azureus does tend to take as much as it can to download files.  Try setting your upload settings to a little lower and leaving your download as unlimited.  If that doesn't work, I'd suggest getting new hardware or a new internet provider."
,DarnBoy,2007-06-25T22:39Z,Raiden. Dude I tried that whatever u told me and then i started to upload it but it's like taking forever and eventually it just comes to a page where it says cannot find the webpage or smth like that.

,togo,2007-07-16T20:02Z,"LOL Goz 1212 you are funny man. are you from espain? Ke? Ok this game works fine but not online. There is no virus, if your worried just get AVG antivirus and scan it before you install. And luciolaro, could be your on board sound or sound card is crappy or system not up to handling the game. try updating your sound card and video card drivers. "
,togo,2007-07-16T20:07Z,"Goz 1212 to seed just leave the torrent running after you have finished downloading. Dont remove the game folder which is the torrent file. Leave it where it is and keep the torrent open. You can adjust the speed at which you upload in your bitorrent client (bitlord, utorrent etc) options menu. just make sure you are uploading as well as downloading. the download amount, in this case 5.2 gigs should be uploaded to the same amount and a bit extra just in case."

Just double-click the patch included. That golden 'bird-like'-thing you find in the downloaded folder."

I'm sure i could figure it out without further instruction, but it would probably take hours of fiddling around with stuff.  ~thanks"

1. When i go to start a mission the bald headed dude's lips do not match with what is being said is there a way to fix that?

2. Gameplay is awsome but it's really slow, like the game is in slow motion any work around that also?..

Thank you Resurrect for a wsome game, and any who can help me with these problems."
,patrioticparadox,2008-01-24T04:56Z,"This torrent works 100%. Great upload. Amazing game. On of the best RTS games ever. one suggestion is to download only the image (.mdf and .mds) and not the patch or crack.
Mount with daemon (or other) and install the game. Then open Command and Conquer 3 Control Center (START>>All Programs>>Electronic Arts>>Command and Conquer 3>>Command and Conquer 3 Control Center)
Click the update button and allow to update. once its finished updating go to gamecopyworld .com (obviously remove the space) and search for Command and Conquer 3 download the 1.9 patch. extract the .dat file and place it in the proper directory. Now instead of having a cracked 1.4 version you have a cracked 1.9 version that works perfectly. to those of you knew to our community Game Copy World is a great resource. Once again this torrrent works perfectly either using the patch and crack provided or using my method to update it. Have fun and thanks to ReSSuReCtEd for a great upload."

1. most cracks are very old like 2 or 3 years, and wont work with the latest OS.
2. some games require you to emulate cd images, using virtual cd porgram, like alcohol 120% or deamon tools.

,Kulde,2011-01-23T04:47Z,"Comment # 666, me like...

Well. After one botched attempt at installing (I fucked up somewhere along the way, since I'm an idiot and didn't follow the Readme 110%), I removed the whole thing, downloaded it again in 2-3 hours time and followed the instructions to the letter. Even though I have an old and outdated version of Daemon, it worked like a charm, and now I'm happy as a pig in shit and playing my ass off. God, this game gives me a hardon.

If you have any problems running the game, as I did the first time, chances are you have done SOMETHING wrong. Truth be told, for a noob like me it would have been better with a more detailed and complex readme-file, but since me being a moron could do it, then so can you. For those that keep trying to either download or install the fucker, don't give up. It's fucking worth it. "
,Kulde,2011-01-23T04:56Z,"Shah:

Same thing happened to me. Not quite sure what I did wrong, but I'll try and explain what I did when I made it work.

1: If shit doesn't work, accept failure and uninstall the entire thing, delete everything and download it again, starting fresh. Just to be on the safe side.

2: Once downloaded, open the folder and then unpack the files from the CNC3.mdf-file (I use WinRAR, guess it doesn't matter what you use.)

3: Mount the CNC3.mds-file - I used DaemonLite. Note - I did NOT do anything when asked to either autorun it or explore the disc/files, I simply mounted it and let it wait.

4: Open your now unpacked CNC3-folder, find the installation program called cnc3std, double-click it and it installs. When prompted, type in one of the keys listed in the README-file (I used the first one).

5:When installation finishes, doubleclick CNC3_patch104 in the main folder and let it do its work.

6: Then, apply the crack as described in the README-file; I can't explain it one hair better than it's said there. Do as it says and you can't go wrong.

7: NOW, go back to your mounted CD, and hit Autorun.

8: Play and enjoy. Well, at least that's what I did. =)"
,Kulde,2011-01-23T04:59Z,"Shah - Same thing happened to me. When following the instructions in the README-file, be sure to follow them perfectly.

Also, what I specifically did when I got it working, was that when I mounted the CD, I mounted the .mds-file, and instead of choosing either autorun or explore files, I just left it hanging until I had completing all the remaining steps.

Once everything was done, I hit Autorun (I used DaemonLite) on the mounted .mds-file and I was home free; worked perfectly."
,RichieBlackheart,2011-01-24T14:02Z,"Infected with Sasser worm.

Within seconds of attempting to install, computer became slow and unresponsive. Anti-virus pop up said process was blocked. Looked on process list to find a list of Lsass.exe and system.exe processes running. 

Have just done a system restore and am running several anti-virus and spyware programs to fully get rid of it."

So after you Unzip the Rar file you...

1. Mount/Burn with Daemon Tools/PowerISO/Alcohol Etc (Either MDF or MDS File doesnt matter)""

My problem is with the ""So after you Unzip the .rar file you..."" my torrent doesn't have a .rar file...

The entirety of my torrent is this-
1. Cracked by HATRED folder
2. CNC3.mdf
3. CNC3.mds
4. CNC3_patch104_english
5. ReSSuReCtEd READ FIRST ReadMe file

There's nothing to unzip!!!! I can mount the .mdf and .mds, and when I browse the ""CD"" there are a few .rar files like: ""_Retai~1"" ""Retail1"" ""Core"" ""Launch~1"" etc. etc. 

But even then when I try to unzip those all I get are error messages from winzip!
