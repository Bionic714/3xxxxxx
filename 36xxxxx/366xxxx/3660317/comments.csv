,ClipperCigars,2011-12-14T04:22Z,"@ allodcarllo: Yeah, the dvd releases were fairly sub-par on quality. StudioCanal must have spent alot of time in looking for the worst quality masters to source the dvd's from. 

Also, to ""Adrian Edmondson"". Thanks for ruining many of the episodes by reediting them for the dvd releases, asshole. You should have been stripped of all credit for every single thing you've ever done and then cast into a pit of vipers and tigers.

That said, it's still a nice set to have.

On to more serious issues. What the hell is up with the seeders. The other 8 discs are all well seeded (despite the seeder #'s listed), but everyone seems to want to be f--king dickhead with this last one. "
