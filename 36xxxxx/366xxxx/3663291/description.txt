The hieroglyphics to the left are taken from an Egyptian tomb. Note the craft on the right 

that looks like a flying saucer or modern jet aircraft, the picture on the left resembles a 

helicopter with astonishing likeness, surprising since this artwork is more than 5,000 years 

old. How did these pictures end up there? Easy these crafts no doubt existed back then, a 

statue of a small craft resembling a modern day aircraft was also found in Egypt. It is in a 

museum today, when analyzed it showed symetry in the design of the statue signalling 

knowledge of flight way back in Egypt. Forget the Wright Brothers, the Egyptian brothers 

were way before them.  Some people think I am naive for believing in this stuff. The reason 

why they think that is because modern society has taught them that believing in this sort of 

thing is a sign of being naive or a little thick. But after reviewing the evidence in this 

case, and several ufo and alien documented cases any intelligent judge would rule in favor 

of alien existance as crazy as that may sound. In any other case with so much evidence the 

ruling would be clear, but in this case, the judges are impartial unfortunately

In 1994, José and Karen Escamilla accidentally caught on tape strange flying rods with 

undulating appendages. They continue their quest to find out what they are. 
José Escamilla, explorer and filmmaker, discovered strange flying rods while investigating 

UFOs with his wife Karen in New Mexico in 1994. A satisfactory explanation for these 

enigmatic things is still being sought. Are they alive? Are they dangerous? Where do they 

come from and where do they go?
