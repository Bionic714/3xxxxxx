,sonicj484,2007-09-04T14:53Z,"Hi, I am downloading this with no problems thus far. I was wondering why this torrent size was 3.24GB, does the additional 10 minutes and soundtrack really add up to this? Just curious. Thanks again. 

Oh and will you be doing the same thing with Halloween 2 in terms of adding television footage with the film?"
