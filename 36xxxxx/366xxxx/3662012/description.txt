The One Eyed Dude strikes back with...

Title:	Manhattan Chase 

About:	

Manhattan Chase will let you choose between Angel, 
a brave and proud member of the NYPD, and Yasmin, 
a cold-hearted and sadistic criminal. Reveal the exciting
story about these two completely different girls by finishing 
all episodes from both sides of the law!

As if these action-packed story-episodes are not enough
to guarantee a long lifetime of this game, there is also a 
multi-play mode. Team6 did their best to make this their 
most challenging game ever: The car-chases are more 
intense, agressive and addictive then showed in any other
game ever before, and the 3rd person action makes sure 
there is plenty of variation in gameplay terms.

In 3rd person the girls carry effective but 'ordinary' weapons 
such as a machinegun, grenadelauncher or sniper: But once
inside one of the dozen available cars the mass-destruction 
weapons become available! Vulcan-cannons, Multi-missiles,
homing rockets, mines and even airstrikes are yours to use 
or abuse.

1) Unrar... and mount iso!
2) Launch TOED.EXE or demo-no.id.cum.exe its up to you!
3) Enjoy... and have Fun...
