If you never heard of this band listen to this a few times you might like it very much if not love it.
Listen to The Killing Moon. Echo and the bunnymen were rumored to have String Quartets on the stage during the live concerts. It wass all keyboards that I know of. I have seen them at leat 8 times in the States and have never seen stringged instruments on stage.




Remastered.
This is truly one of the greatest bands from the 80s.
Very rarely heard on US radio until the hit Lips Like Sugar came out.
