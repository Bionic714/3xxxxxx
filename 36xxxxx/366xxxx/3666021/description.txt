This is a VCR Rip into mpg, converted to DivX 5, joining the 2 original videos into one.

This is a lecture given by Stanley A. Meyer at The Safe Free Energy Conference in Einsiedeln Switzerland, 1989.

As with his previous video's, Stanley Meyer goes into a complete run down on the develope and implimentation of his Water Fuel Cell Technology.
This is a must for all those people trying to understand and build a replication of his Water Fuel Cell.

This cuts through the horse manure spread by the mis-information crowd out and about on the Internet perpetuating Myth, Uncertainty and Doubt regarding his technology.

As they say: "Straight from the Horses Mouth"
