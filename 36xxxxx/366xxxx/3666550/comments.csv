,Arcani76,2009-01-09T21:55Z,"This game REQUIRES ""Hardware Transform & Lighting"". So, if you're running it on older cards or integrated chips, then you can't play it. BUT there's a woraround which is called ""3D Analyzer"". Using this tool you can at least get into the game, and possibly play it normally like you have HTnL."
,TrexiZ,2009-02-17T15:55Z,"dopemans games are pretty good, but there always bad seeded. Just unrar, i expect that u have winrar. then play it! its 35 kb/s in downloading speed. Am sending a new comment if it works :) ty dopeman"

,pikamau5,2009-12-03T19:13Z,"hm, i tried to execute the file but nothing happens, anyone else having the same problem?"
,catwoman111980,2010-02-08T02:02Z,"@StitchTheChi:

For anyone having problems with in-game voices (sped up and squeaky like Alvin and Chipmunks or Smurfs), you need to turn off audio hardware acceleration on your PC.

Go to Start->Run and type in ""dxdiag""

Then Click on the ""Sound"" tab and move the slider for ""Hardware Sound Acceleration Level"" all the way to the left, so it's set to ""No Acceleration.""

That should solve your audio problems."
