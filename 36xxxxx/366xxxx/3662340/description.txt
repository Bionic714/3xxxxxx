Overview:	Wong Fei Hung and his once-rival, now friend, find themselves and their martial arts schools pitted against a rival school which uses a kung fu expert from the north to do their dirty work, although the expert doesn't realize he is being evil (they lie to him).

This may be the only role in which Wang Lung Wei as the hero from the north isn't a villain. He fights Wong Fei Hung, sure, but as one martial artists to another, and once he discovers that he has been tricked by the bad school, he refuses to help them anymore. Although he beats Wong in the end, they respect one another. Lots of great fights and interesting stuff.
