,fulcifreak,2007-04-21T22:18Z,"can you tell me is it pal or ntsc?
thanks"
,FaderAbraham,2007-04-22T00:01Z,"It's PAL, and it's probably 4:3 like the version I have. But I think that's how it was filmed and it's the WS versions that are cropped at the top and bottom."

,strangelove9,2007-10-16T06:42Z,"OMG, OMG!

I've just discovered that this great movie is available on TPB!

PLEASE keep on seeding!!!!!"
,strangelove9,2007-10-25T00:34Z,"There seems to be a problem... after the 20-minute mark, the film stutters and skips every minute or tw, up until the end.

Maybe the DVD was improperly ripped?

In any case, I am downloading it again... please seed, folks!"
,strangelove9,2007-10-27T10:20Z,"OK...

Many thanks to those who continued to seed.
The second download was flawless.

As a way to show my gratitude, I will seed until I get a ration of at least 2.0 on this movie - so that others can enjoy it as well. 

Thanks to all, again!"
,gba_1967,2007-11-24T04:26Z,"Currently only 3.6 % of the movie is available. I have been trying to find this movie for ages. Please seed lads!

Thank you very much in advance for your help and cooperation!"
,jiahua,2011-01-15T05:40Z,"At 99.7% and 0 seeders! Will someone please hop on and help us out? I'll keep seeding after, but it sucks to be this close finishing the d/l but still not complete."
