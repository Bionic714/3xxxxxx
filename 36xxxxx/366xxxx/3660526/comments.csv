,Dequlynn,2007-06-29T22:31Z,"Thanks a lot, I've been looking for this forever. Works perfectly."
,bgtip,2007-10-20T20:32Z,"yo, how do i open this file? do i have to burn it into a cd?"
,Verwandlung-,2007-11-16T11:59Z,"Thank you!

hope they will run in xp.."
,vickei,2007-11-19T04:29Z,"You do not have to burn this to a CD.

You can download DAEMON Tools for free and ""mount"" the images.

The way I do it is by right clicking the red DAEMON Tools icon in the taskbar, setting it to 1 devices and then mounting the image making sure all file types are selected in the browse window.

It should run exactly like a CD.

Either that or you can burn it using Nero's Burning ROM."

You should be able to find updates to run this game on 2k/XP/Vista

I havent downloaded it yet, but you may have to run the game in 256 colours by right clicking on the game.exe file and going into properties."

By the way, current download speed - 215kbps, max I saw - 243kbps, average - 188kbps.  I've only been going 5 minutes, and I already have 4% of the game!  Rare good seeders!"

,Mysfarbror,2008-08-31T10:45Z,"im pretty sure i have these games lying around somewhere, but now i wont have to go look for them (:"
,Necro-File,2008-09-01T00:52Z,Best fucking platformers in the WORLD. I am glad I go bargin bin diving or I'd have never discovered what a gem this game is.
,Zayla,2008-09-03T07:55Z,"I can confirm they both work fine under Vista 64 bit.

 Used Alcohol to mount and install .. no troubles.

 Was no need for any updates .. or to change any color settings either.  "
,dartb,2008-09-11T14:47Z,"If anybody is having troubles with the sound files, make sure that during install you chose custom installation and select the option to copy the level files onto your hard drive.

Works great."

,NeoEndymnion,2009-04-14T17:03Z,"Install on the first game isn't working... not from the autorun, or from inside the CD itself... you click it, and it just runs and runs... any reason why this isn't installing? Using Windows XP"

,BasicKiller,2009-06-25T09:46Z,"Thanks Dude

@Synnista: Learn PC & Internet before u come to the pirate bay"
,atsibo,2009-06-25T16:49Z,"works just fine!The only thing you have to do so u can see the videos is that after install u have to play the game from the second cd.
Big thnks to the uploader cause is one my favorites games!Its a shame that u cant play it with gamepad..."
,elmator,2009-09-06T21:47Z,"THX for this brilliant high-quality upload..., everything works like a charm !!!

@ atsibo :
I'm still downloading the ""Exodus""-part, but I can say for the ""Oddysee""-part that gamepad-control works very well; you may configure it to suit your gaming habits !

Once I'm done downloading this, I'll keep seeding until I have reached a ratio of 3 #, ok ?

Thx again, mlody00843 !!!"
,flames_of_mordor,2009-10-02T18:57Z,While you all complain about installing when it is A ISO file. just use the Daemon tool. Move the ISO-file to the program and it will automaticly install just like a regualary CD. simple!!!
,tonttu13,2010-02-19T22:44Z,"Crappy conn, DL 35kB
Just wanna thank everybody! for seeding!

,Ben.Ks,2010-10-15T17:40Z,"Awesome Game, Great download, Thanks! I'm playing it on my PSP and occasionally Oddysee freezes. Is there a certain pops that prevents this? I'm on CFW 5.00 M33-6, and through iRShell (if that makes a difference?)"
