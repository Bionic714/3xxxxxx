about:

Future Cop: LAPD puts you in the center of futuristic urban conflicts, 
where you must use all your firepower to accomplish your objectives. 
The game features two modes: Crime War, in which you reclaim eight 
sections of crime-ridden L.A., and Precinct Assault, in which you battle 
against a friend or the computer-controlled "Sky Captain." You won't be 
patrolling the streets unassisted, however; you use the revolutionary 
TAC X-1 Alpha--durable, armed to the teeth, and capable of handling 
the worst the crime lords have to offer. This powerfully equipped walking 
vehicle can be transformed into a fast hovercraft-like machine in certain 
situations. Fifteen different weapons are at your disposal, each with two 
different types of power-ups and its own special effects.
