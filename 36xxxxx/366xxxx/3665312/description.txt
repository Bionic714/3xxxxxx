This is the first of two documentaries on the murders of three 2nd graders in West Memphis, Arkansas and documents the railroading of three teenagers for that crime. Whether or not they were the perpetrators it is clear that the prejudice and incompetence of the justice system and media prevent us from knowing if the actual killers are behind bars or if even more innocent kids have been victimized both by "the system" and the actual perpetrators.
