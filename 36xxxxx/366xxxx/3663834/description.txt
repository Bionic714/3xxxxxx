World Racing 2 is the follow-up to Mercedes-Benz World Racing, first released on PS2, GameCube, Xbox and PC back in 2003. Now, two years later, Playlogic publishes World Racing 2. A significant increase in cars and car manufacturers has led to the dropping of ?Mercedes-Benz? from the title, and in World Racing 2 players can race with more than 90 cars from 17 well-known manufacturers, including Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volkswagen and Alfa Romeo.
