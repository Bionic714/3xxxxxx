,zkalos,2007-04-22T12:17Z,"I think this is only for FSX, because in the boxed version are 6 dvd-s, 3 for fsx and 3 for FS 2004(Upgraded Global2005SE) and I think this not requared for FS9 because not a lare improvent over GlobalMesh2005, wich is in TPB. This too large download for a little improvement . See:

,eNuffSaid,2007-05-20T11:04Z,"IF the seeder had any plans on seeding this till the end, he certainly won't have them anymore. Some of the comments here are downright outrageous. If people want something so bad, either buy it or stfu.  Some people really need to get a life. 

I mean... taking on a name ""MadAtUzule"" and then posting that kind of shiz. Man, that's really sad. Get some help, dude."

,DaftHonk,2007-06-23T20:07Z,"@eNuffSaid - hopefully you are not referring to the torrent on demonoid, as it is for FS9 and not FSX.  If you have managed to find the FSX version somewhere else, could you point us in the right direction?  Your help would be greatly appreciated :)"
,eNuffSaid,2007-06-27T17:05Z,"Sorry guys,....  I am an idiot. Downloaded the whole shabang from demonoid, burnt it, installed it and then found out it was FS2004...

aaaargh! :(

I've asked somebody to check the news groups for me. It has been uploaded there but got deleted due to retention time. Bugger!"
,zhabcde5,2007-06-27T18:36Z,Not what don't spread is the seed directly and up?
