,ThaiWhip,2007-04-19T12:25Z,"Well, files are still fucked up.."
,eccles,2007-04-20T17:41Z,"The files are screwed but recoverable, albeit without menus. Run it through DVD Shrink with the reauthor function and that will rebuild the missing video_ts files to enable it to be played on a standard DVD player. Subs are Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Nordic and Finnish. There are no English or other subs. Format is PAL 16x9 WS, and quality seems ok."
