,ratty2,2007-04-20T23:46Z,The movie must have really sucked for nobody to have a CAM release here. I know it sucks but I still want to see it too.
,fanmasterman,2007-04-21T01:14Z,"Hell no. Move was great. The thing is, they had the best fucking thing to stop people from video taping it. If you watched it, you'd see."
,Kaksikasvoinen,2007-04-22T01:09Z,"how about a DVD, when does it come out, or is there also some copyright secure? I WANNA SEE IT!"

 I will break into your house
 and tear your wife in half."""
