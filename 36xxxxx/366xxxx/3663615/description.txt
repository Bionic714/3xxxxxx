REVIEW: Pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard has earned a considerable reputation as a champion of contemporary music, most notably through his close association with the composers Pierre Boulez, Olivier Messiaen, and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. His stated preference is to apply his extraordinary abilities to the service of works with little or no representation on disc. So it's surprising to think that this adventurous musician would partner with old-school conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt and record the five piano concertos of Beethoven, no less. But Aimard jumped at the opportunity, and the result is a set that merits attention. Both Aimard and Harnoncourt leave behind any preconceived notions, and their open-minded approach to these war horses is a breath of fresh air. Aimard's formidable technique allows him to nimbly maneuver through Beethoven's most treacherous passages with fleet-fingered precision, but his acumen and musical intellect are the guiding forces behind these incisive performances. The Chamber Orchestra of Europe responds beautifully to Harnoncourt's crisp baton work, producing a vibrant sound that blends perfectly with Aimard's dynamic pianism. The efforts of these exceptional artists prove that, in the right hands, core repertoire remains compelling and vital.
