,Das Wampir,2008-12-06T21:16Z,Thanks for this!! In order to make this work on xp you have to do a full install. Select custom install and check all options. If you only do a standard install the game will crash. (it did for me anyways...)
,Heathen12,2009-08-02T22:40Z,"Problem. Game installed and seems to run ok, but can't access anything - keep on getting the message that it requires the rites of war CD in drive. Have downloaded patch but it seems to be for a different version and can't find anything else. Any ideas?"
