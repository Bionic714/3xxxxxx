"The Blade" is a sweeping epic which highlights the incredible fighting talent of Chiu Man-Cheuk, Hong Kong's latest action star. When a master sword-maker adopts the son of a murdered friend (Chiu Man-Cheuk), the boy learns the master's craft well. As a young man he learns about his father's death at the hands of a mysterious tattooed killer (Hung Yan Yan). He takes his father's broken blade and sets out to seek vengeance. The daughter, Ling, follows but is caught in a bloody ambush. When he tries to rescue her, his arm is hacked off in the battle and he is believed dead by all except Ling and his friend who set out in search of him.

But he is saved by a hermit girl who nurses him back to health where he finds an old kung fu manual and practices with the broken blade to perfect the art of one-armed sword fighting.
