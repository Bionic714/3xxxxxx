,SuperArnt,2007-04-14T20:42Z,"Yeah, I like Battery, but I think Master, Sanitarium and Orion are better from Master Of Puppets... But you're probably right, it should be here... ;)"
,Kreese,2007-04-15T03:59Z,You have to make it a doubble CD =)
,SuperArnt,2007-04-16T00:26Z,"I've put out ""Part 2"" now (With Battery... hehe) I probably won't be on Lars Ulrich's christmas card-list now but what the hell... ;)"

,mrbb,2007-09-24T21:52Z,"Dude....good stuff but how can you add stuff from Load onwards? That's uber faggety Metallica....You know the ""I have to leave the studio at 4pm"" James and the ""i want more money cos i'm a greedy ass fucking jizz bomb"" Lars...."
,SuperArnt,2007-09-26T14:46Z,"Yeah, I know. But I've tried to put the best songs from each album out here, not the best songs overall, so I guess the title is a bit misleading. Sorry about that. If I were to name my 18 all-time favourites, no songs from Load, Reload or St.Anger would be here..."
