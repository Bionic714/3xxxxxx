,BigEarnie69,2008-12-22T07:08Z,"A .uha file is an archive file, but I'm not entirely sure why it has .exe on the end. I'm not overly familiar with .uha, because it's rarely used. Anyone know if this is a bad upload or not?"
,truthofyore,2009-01-05T13:20Z,Does this work on ePSXe? and is it ISO!?
,cltgra005,2009-03-10T21:07Z,"Okay. The game is working fine on my ps1. What I did was: 

1) I extracted the AzureDreams.bin.uha file using WinUHA.

2) I mounted the AzureDreams.bin file using Daemon Tools. This program creates a virtual disk drive on your pc (eg. E:, F: or G:), so when the bin file was mounted, the game appeared on this drive.

3) I used CloneCD to burn a copy of the mounted game from this virtual drive to a blank CD in my actual DVD-rewriter. When I tried to copy the contents from the mounted bin file to my PC, I found out that the files were copy protected, so that's why I had to use CloneCD.

I haven't had any problems with the game. The video clips do stutter (skip) a little, but not that much."
