Release Notes:

Miosis was founded in the late summer of 2005. It sprung from the group "Soma soul transfusion" who had recorded two EP:s; "Songs of passion" in 2003 and "Albedo adaptation" in 2004. It was felt at the time that a new start was needed. A clean sheet, a new hand.

The music of Miosis is creating moods for the somewhat depressive and often self-reflecting poetry, it is about finding a way to create images of the darker corners of the souls, minds and hearts that are explored, contemplated upon and poured out in interesting, tasteful musical arrangements.
