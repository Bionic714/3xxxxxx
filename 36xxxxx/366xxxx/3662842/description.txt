The files are a little pain in the butt to get and the "How To" is a little confusing.
So i include both the 32bit and 64bit patches in this package.

You Can Use Either the Manual Version or the Auto Patcher. Your Choice
Both Are Included in Package

And i edited the "how to" so it is easier to understand If you choose to go the manual patch method.
