Though Vista sucks generally, one area where it excels is its networking. 

Its far more optimised than any other Microsoft OS, and without the patch here you will see greater throughput than ever before.

Fiddling with it in any way is likely to only actually slow throughput DOWN.

Dont believe everything you read people. Yes the errors in event viewer as described, but theyre more informative than errors..... "
,Donnydad,2007-04-14T00:36Z,"This patch will not affect your throughput in any way, positively or negatively.
This patch will allow you to adjust your half open connections from the default (25 in ultimate). 
This allows your operating system to make more simultaneous connection attempts. This does not increase overall connection numbers.
I myself use this fix to help stabilize my connection as my P2P half open connection limit causes my Http to drop out until i reboot."
,BuckShot1974,2009-12-03T00:17Z,"If you use this patch to increase half open connections, then configure your browser to make use of them, surfing (especially if you use multiple pages) should be increased slightly.

Thanks u/loader."
