Overview:	The plot is convoluted in the extreme, but revolves around a national hero being forced into exile for marrying a woman from the wrong family. When fleeing the emperor's palace, he strategically kidnaps the crown prince... who unfortunately dies in transit. He therefore brings up an orphan in the prince's place, who ends up being trained by two feuding magicians to help defeat the villainous Sorcerer Bat, who turns out to be pulling virtually every string behind the scenes.
