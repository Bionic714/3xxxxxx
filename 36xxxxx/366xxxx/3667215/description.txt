NEED FOR SPEED 3 offers five different modes including Single Race, Tournament, Knockout, Practice, and Hot Pursuit. Hot Pursuit is one of the more fun modes you're likely to see in a racing game, as it gives you the chance to go on the lam and lead the cops on a wild goose chase. Pay attention, though, because the police have some tricks up their sleeves, namely tire spikes and roadblocks. Tournament is the deepest mode, as it lets you enter a series of racing tours in order to prove your dominance. There are eight cars and eight tracks in the game, although not all of them are available from the get-go. But you can unlock the new cars and tracks by performing well with the initial cars and tracks. Some of the well-known cars you can expect to drive are Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Chevrolet.
