,AppleXPan,2007-04-18T08:33Z,"Renders previous CS2 useless (if you had it installed) - you probably have to reinstall the whole package of Adobe apps whether CS2 or CS3 etc. 

So  be aware that all your previous Adobe apps may not work anymore (it says att your serial number is wrong). Photoshop CS2 starts with a different logo ""SpaceMonkey"". "
,AppleXPan,2007-04-18T08:38Z,"(...) Many users do however need to get rid of all previous CS3 files (pre-release) - where Adobe's uninstaller didn't managed it completely (i couldn't get it to work either)- but in order to get the final CS3 working, you have to get rid of all older CS3 files. 

The question is, if this uninstaller app is a friend or foe... I can't tell right now..."
,AppleXPan,2007-04-18T21:03Z,"(later...) The app is a friend (not foe), does as told (removing everything that has to do with CS3, although makes CS2 stop working as well) - but then makes re-installation of CS3+other apps etc work like a charm."
,ryapeter,2007-04-19T04:49Z,Btw until yesterday there's a CS3 torrent up. Just right ontop of this one. Anyone know where it went?
,merryrobinhood,2007-04-19T16:13Z,"I used it. Works great to get new CS3 to install. Old CS3 still worked though I deleted it now that I have the new one.

But I've noticed that since the installation process, somewhere along the line my system is hanging for long stretches when I highlight an item in open dialog boxes, or when getting info on files... maybe had something to do with this file?

Anyone else having similar issues after using this?"

,alberteinstein6969,2007-04-24T18:09Z,"You may have seen my posts on other CS3 torrents, but...

I ran this and it totally screwed the pouch.  No CS2 re-installs and no CS3.  

If this happened to anyone else and they fixed it please post the solution.  I've spent many hours cleaning registry entries with no luck.  "
,jahkarma,2007-12-03T22:07Z,Worked like a charm Unistalled and reinstalled CS3 complete no problems thanks for posting...
