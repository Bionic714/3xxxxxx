I did that on this one and it wont work at all on any player for me, just like u-571 and a few  other of these new ones."
,oswald1234,2007-04-21T11:46Z,"This shit dont work.Dollar store stuff,complete garbage.You get this movie and it plays right,sound off like you a got a pair. MAGGOT"
,rc71,2007-04-23T15:14Z,"I have to agree.  With Oswald1234.   I looked at it with everything I  have including .ts tools and nothing.  My software claims there is no MPEG transport stream.  Sound is fine though.  :(

If this isn't a fake, it needs some more info.  Other HDTV China stuff looked great."
,alpher,2007-04-30T21:42Z,"A lot of the ""no MPEG transport stream"" going around lately....

Makes you wonder...if some a*holes are planting these...to discourage people from downloading HD-material..."
,oswald1234,2007-05-02T08:02Z,"Just take the smallest  video file and download on high priority,,, dont work, shit can it. IF it works,You still have to join it...dont forget.I hate video that wont make a fluid movie(unless its porn) but they dont count cause I dont show them to my relatives.HEHE"
,oswald1234,2007-05-08T08:43Z,"THis shit no works,,,GET IT. Some maggotts never learn..."
,rc71,2007-05-30T17:31Z,"I've installed the VC-1 Codec and still nothing.  Like before, if it's real and it just needs a codec, include it in the torrent.  At XXgb's, a couple of MB's for a codec won't anything.
I have a strong feeling those people who say it works are either speaking in general terms or griefers that enjoy bugging people.
If you say it works with X, don't just say google it or codec that, post a link.  A WORKING LINK."
,Pippin,2007-07-29T01:58Z,I thought Kubrick specifically ordered that his film wasnt to be changed in any way?
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-08-24T19:19Z,any multi audio  and multi subs?
