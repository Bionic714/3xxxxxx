This one is good quality audio and video, with obviously no censors. 
These files all work, i've watched it all. 

NB: subtitles were found later and were not checked.

Don't whine about getting free things like ppl onif u don't like it, don't download it. go find a different copy and share it with everybody else. just like I have. 

Nobody owes you anything on the scene.

The Wire is basically a cops and robbers series, but definitely one of the best i've seen. its not JUST any old cops and robbers!
