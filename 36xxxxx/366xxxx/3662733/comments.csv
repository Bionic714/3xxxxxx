Thanks a lot. I got to 93% with the two-CD rip from demonoid before the site was closed down. I would've preferred to complete it, but it was impossible (still have the partial files). Thanks a lot to modality. 
The film is a classic. Mikhalkov is the best known living Russian filmmaker. "

,roddydc5,2009-12-16T04:37Z,"Great film! Seen it before. When downloaded this file and made a copy, the screen looked zoomed in to the point I could only see the top of the subtitles. Could I be having a problem with ConvertXtoDVD?"

Nice quality for a classic movie;
but I'd like to have divx or dvd version
of such a magnificent film"
,penisfuck,2010-03-22T00:50Z,"Great movie! Quality is like VHS, but watchable.  There is also a 2CD version out there, which is only slightly better in quality. But for those who prefer small file size, this torrent is a good choice. Don't know of any better rips so far. Thank you very much for uploading this!"
