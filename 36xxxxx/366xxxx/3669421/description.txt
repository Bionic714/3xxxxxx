Bomberman Hardball, PS2 (Euro PAL to USA NTSC patched)

Very few Bomberman games have been released outside of Japan since the days
of cartridge based consoles, which is really a shame because the games became
popular in the first place from their wonderful gameplay.

This is the latest PS2 Bomberman game at the time this torrent was created.
Fortunately, it's one of the few Bomberman games lately that was given an
English PAL release so I was able to patch it to run on American NTSC systems.

If your PS2 has trouble with the Swap Magic CD (like mine does!), maybe you'd
be interested in converting this to run from DVD media.  If enough people show
interest, I'll convert it myself and upload another torrent in DVD format.
Skip to the bottom for current info on reaching me regarding this.

Please be patient while downloading, and please stay online until this gets a
few distributed copies.  My upload bandwidth is terrible at the moment
compared to my downstream.  Thank you, and enjoy the game!


[===== What to Do Next =====]

Run the EXE file to extract.

Burn to CD at the slowest speed your burner supports, or at 4x, using GOOD
quality media.

Plays perfectly on properly modded PS2, including fliptop/Slim Kit with Swap
Magic CD.  I've verified this on my own system.

If your PS2 has trouble reading a Swap Magic CD, your PS2 is the problem (like
mine).  If it reads the SM CD but has problems with this or other game backups,
it's probably the quality of the media you're using.


[===== Bit Twiddling =====]

Packaged as a self-extracting UHArc archive, better than ZIP and RAR all
around, faster than 7zip and usually the same compression as well.
