,Tam Vu,2007-04-30T13:40Z,Game (installed on HDD) flickers and is interlaced on my PS2 running ToxicOS. 
,FieroGT42,2007-05-01T04:38Z,"I used UHArc because it gave much better compression that RAR or 7zip.  LOL, omg, you can't unzip it because it's an EXE??  If you take a minute to READ, you'll see that it's a SELF-EXTRACTING archive.  You just run it, and it extracts itself.  No need to even have additional software.  And if you happen to be on *Nix or Mac, you can STILL open with a UHArc utility.  WTF? oO"
,FieroGT42,2007-05-01T04:43Z,"Tam Vu, are you using an NTSC system?  I patched this for NTSC/USA and verified it on my own console. =)"

Can you convert this cd-based game to dvd?
And can you do another games as well? This might be a very big help.

I've already tried lots of methods but I think it has a very hard checking-system.

Bye!"
,rodrigoann,2009-09-08T00:53Z,"Yes! Works OK but...

The screen was a little cut in top and botton with this modified version of a PAL!

It was a good initiative by the uploader, but I prefer to get the PAL version even!

Well, Thank You anyway! :)"
