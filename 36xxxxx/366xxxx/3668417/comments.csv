,deadroleguy,2008-02-28T19:17Z,"Awesome video quality and bilingual selection,what more can i ask for? this is great!

thank you mike18xx"
,Callius,2008-03-15T11:30Z,Thank you very much!
,whiteorc,2008-04-03T14:04Z,"great upload, ghibli movies are always welcome"
,yrah,2008-05-27T03:20Z,"Superb work on the files and the write-up. I now know that I can use the audio button on my remote and I can load subtitles onto a flash drive with the movie. 
Greatest children's movie ever?"
,Songhj,2008-06-08T10:19Z,"How do I change the file so I can have it on my Ipod with jap language and eng sub?

BTW the file is really good. Sweet quality and stuff just a little bit anoying for people like me who use Windows media player."
,zanthosxanquel,2008-07-20T18:05Z,ya i was just watching the movie and the scripted is not the same as the original if you have a real copy of the movie go back and listen tot eh words and you will know what i an taking about
,supersqueak,2008-09-07T01:50Z, The 1998 dub my fox?  I really want this hope it works.
,supersqueak,2008-09-07T04:03Z, I hate you so much this is the Disney dub. I dunno if this was a typo but the original my neighbor Totoro came out in 1988.  The date 1998 made me think this was the fox dub.
,Duckbaker,2008-11-11T15:52Z,"Dude? he totally mentioned it in his incredibly good description. ""OMG i hate you so much cry cry this dub sucks"" Real fanboys watch it in japanese, the english dubs suck either way."
,LezDawson,2008-11-14T21:00Z,"I don't believe this uploader, and all the leachers who failed to mention that the PICTURE IS SURROUNDED BY BLACK BARS ALL AROUND!!!  Call me picky, but I would have thought that someone might like to have mentioned this small point.
Mike18xx: Learn how to use your FairUse encoder, or at least WARN US when you produce something like this.
Great film, but there are better rips than this available, but not with English dubs (which would be better for young English-speaking kids).  Shame, but thanks anyway."
,teh8thdeadlysin,2008-12-15T00:35Z,Thanks Man =D
,triskuit,2008-12-28T05:51Z,"The seed on this is amazing, but the black bars are irritating. The worst thing about this torrent is that it's the dakota fanning version, which is just terrible compared to the original. But that's no uploaders fault, it's that horrible little girl, dakota fanning's fault."
,LeShok,2009-01-19T17:19Z,Your awesome man!
,Supar78,2009-08-08T10:24Z,Many thnks to you!

,sunshine420,2010-01-13T03:02Z,"Does anyone have any idea where to download the first english dub version, the troma version as the poster of this torrent calls it? I have it on VHS and I'm totally in love with it and I NEED it. Thanks for indulging me"
,sunshine420,2010-01-14T06:14Z,"Not trying to spam

Seriously, I watched this one with the 2005 english with dakota fanning. she wasn't even born when I was watching this. No ideas where the original enlgish version is?"
