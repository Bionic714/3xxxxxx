I am looking for a movie that I saw when I was young, around 1980-82.
From what I can remember it contained the styles ""The Rooster"" and the Flying Chicken among the usual Tiger, snake and so on -styles.

I only can remember my freind back then telling me it was called Kung Fu Man. But after seeing Instant Kung Fu Man, I am sure thatÂ´s not the one.

Would you have any Idea what I am talking about? I would be so glad to know what the name of it is, and even better, if you have it.

Thanx for all the sharing.
