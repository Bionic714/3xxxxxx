,truemmer,2007-07-31T12:18Z,"Ending movies are missing!
If you want to go through hell playing this game and not getting the reward of seeing the ending...go ahead  and download this shit.

Dopeman sucks ass!
I can't believe this one is still up."
,LoveMeTender,2007-08-02T21:28Z,"I am confused. I have just finished Downloading the game, and there are Several parts that I need to unrar. do I put them all in the same folder? And there are folders within the folders that need to be unrar, do I unrar thoes too?

some one wanna tell meh, what to do thanks. "
,LoveMeTender,2007-08-02T23:51Z,"So if I unrar Part 1, will it unrar it all?"
,LoveMeTender,2007-08-03T02:14Z,"ok, never mind i got it to work, great job. Everything seems to work fine."
,ice_cream,2007-08-07T23:17Z,I cant get it to work. I extracted it already and after click yes for the registry shit. it gave me error message!
,SDWILLIA,2007-09-29T18:45Z,"I d/led the game and installed it as per instructions and clicked on the .exe.  I got the game working, but when I get control, I just keep spinning around in the room.  How do I stop this so that I can walk around normally???  "
,LoDiZ,2007-10-04T18:33Z,"double-click setup.bat   -relax as game decompresses

Be sure to click yes when asked to enter registry entries.

start with SILENT HILL 4.exe


tycker det  ser ut som en trojan ... :/"
,AbbaJ,2007-10-20T15:22Z,"C mon baby, seed that damn games and let me dling :P

im at 95% :("
,1ghz,2007-12-16T22:09Z,Thanks for UL
,t2BeDLaM,2008-01-02T19:54Z,"HAving Problems with Game, Read This!!!!

You will find a file in the game folder called ""CheckSpec.dll""
Delete that file. 
Then when you run the game you will be able to set your screen resolution to whatever you wish.

So for those complaining about the 640 or 400 crap. and the ones having probs running it. REMOVE that file and restart and all is good!
That file is made the first time the game runs and tacks the machine. So when the game is run on another machine that info is incorrect and the game will cause all kinds of grief. Something Dopeman overlooked in this release.
So just delete that file and I would delete the file in your save directory also, Start the game from the beginning again and wala! Plays wonderfull."
,tcpuser,2008-01-05T05:32Z,"Hi, please I'd like to download this one, but there's a comment that says the final movies are deleted. Is that true? What are those ""bonus movies"" that are ripped? Thank you. "
,Ewanko,2008-02-10T17:12Z,the bonus movies that are ripped are some alternate intro vids and the trailers from the previous silent hill games that are added bonuses to silent hill 4. 
,Ewanko,2008-02-10T17:13Z,btw i hate stupid people blaming dopeman for their stupidity on not being able to make the game work for their machines. ungrateful bastards. 
,L0rd_Luke,2008-02-18T11:06Z,"Everything appears to install properly, I remember to click yes on the add to registry.
However, upon running silent hill 4.exe, I get an error that the game is not installed properly.  The other executables run just fine, and I have all the correct system specs."
,juissiman,2008-02-25T17:55Z,plz seed!                                               
,breaker253,2008-02-25T21:28Z,"After extracting and running the exe. I'm getting an error that hte games not isntalled properly. Only thing i can figure is becuase im running a 64 bit os (Vista x64). Anyone have any idea why I'm getting this error or how I should go about installing it? Seems to be the smae error as ""L0rd_Luke"""
,xsadame,2008-03-03T12:12Z,seed please? :D
,Evangelist_A,2008-03-18T12:48Z,"Vista and x64 doesn't sound like ""correct system specs"". Maybe there is a vista patch for that (as for a lot of games), but probably not for that rip. Play original games, or use xp. :-]"
,sd1712,2008-04-13T19:36Z,"This works for me, but none of the cutscenes work at all, including the in-game graphic ones. They are just skipped.

Is it supposed to be like this?

Thanks."
,JanZ,2008-04-13T22:53Z,"Hmm, I'm having the same problem as lord_luke and evangelist_a, I'm running XP x64 and the game says it is not installed properly. Does anyone know a solution?"
,sd1712,2008-04-14T00:39Z,"Have you double clicked the registry icon? I had to do that manually.

Also, I solved my cutscene problem, I think it was a disk space issue while decompressing."
,JanZ,2008-04-14T21:19Z,"Yup, I even corrected the installdirectory in the registry file AND in my registry. I also tried another crack... still the same problem..."
,mythbuster420,2008-04-27T14:05Z,"ATTENTION VISTA 64 USERS !>>

If it says ""game not installed correctly"" then do this >>


SOLUTION:

1) Open the setup.reg file with Notepad
2) Replace the line [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Konami\SILENT HILL 4\1.00.000] with [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Konami\SILENT HILL 4\1.00.000]
3) Save
4) Double click the setup.reg file again.

BAM!!! Game Fixed and Working !"
,JanZ,2008-05-01T23:29Z,I confirm: this solution also works for XP x64.

,Anoschkin,2008-08-10T09:52Z,"Thank you soo much, awsome!"
,gardenseed,2008-08-16T11:11Z,"***--SOLUTION--***

1. unrar the ""SH4.part01"" etc.

2. once done this just double click on the ""setup"" (this will be an MS-Dos file) DO NOT UNRAR THE FOLDERS YOURSELF.

OH and make sure to click yes on the registry.

3. go ahead and play the game

hope that helps for all those who want this game and stuff (i mean dopeman already said how to but not intirely well enough obviously, BUT THANK YOU DOPEMAN FOR THE AWESOME GAMES :D)"
,gardenseed,2008-08-16T11:12Z,"oh and you dont have to delete the checkspec.dll file, just play the game and it should be fine :)"

,Tyrram999,2008-09-20T20:06Z,never mind i got it. I had to extract ALL the rars and then run setup.bat then run SILENT HILL 4.exe which was inside the_rest archieve
,D3M0N1NMYH34D,2008-09-25T17:44Z,"You may be an excellent ripper, but this copy of Silent Hill 4 is totally fucked up. Teture errors, resolution bugs, and crashes galore. Not to mention that this is one of the worst games ever published. (and this is coming from a hardcore silent hill fan) I know the quality of the game is not your fault, but what it comes down to is; people should avoid this copy of SH4, unless dopeman starts offering a patch.
Such a shame too, as SH5 is due out in a week and I so wanted to play some of the old games before it hits the shelves."

I can see pictures on the wall in my apartment but everything else is black. Reloading the game doesn't help, even starting a new game didn't work. What should I do?"

The screen goes through about 2 black and 2 white screens...then eventually stays at a white screen...with the music playing and looping, like it is skipping.
