DB are fast subbers, but I can't say much for their video encoding.

Video: Changed from Xvid to x264, which is *much* better for anime. Cleared up a lot of macroblocking.
Audio: Changed from two redundant 64kbps channels to one 80kbps channel. It's not stereo to begin with, why waste the bytes?
Container: AVI

Re-release of Bleach 122 from Dattebayo (http://yhbt.mine.nu). They release on Thursday mornings (GMT) every week there's a show.
