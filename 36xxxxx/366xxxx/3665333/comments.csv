,Zoracic,2007-04-16T10:40Z,v2.1.8.191 and it's already cracked but don't update (and change the setting in the options so it doesn't).
,b4de4nden,2007-04-16T12:22Z,thx m8 will try this one out for sure... :D
,Zoracic,2007-04-17T08:22Z,I'm sharing another great convertor WinAVI Video Converter http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3666144 It does more types of files. I prefer ConvertXtoDVD but it's nice to have more choice with some files.
,Zoracic,2007-05-18T16:13Z,Maybe best to try some DVD-R discs to see how you get on or use Nero to burn the discs and stop Convert from doing it (in the options).

Works fine if you follow all the instructions."

,NoobToast,2008-11-02T18:09Z,this program will create dvd's that are playable on any dvd player right?
,jonxjquee,2008-12-12T18:39Z,"i haven't ran into a video that this won't convert even weird asian formats
i love it thank you"
,river00,2009-12-08T01:48Z,it dont work   all sorts of red warnings
,Equalyzer,2009-12-21T00:42Z,"This kind of thing is great, but I find it's much easier to just use a DivX DVD player. All you do is burn your downloaded videos to a disc and it will play them. It works with around 98% of what you'll find on torrent sites (they don't play MKVs, unfortunately)."
,padda99,2010-04-10T13:49Z,please can some body tell me the serial number for convertxtodvd 4?
,mafiapirate54,2010-11-11T18:33Z,works great thanks
