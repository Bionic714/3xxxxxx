I´m asking since your earlier release of Norton Internet Security 2007 for Vista was merely a trial version that was useless.
If anyone have links for the full retail versions or have tried this release on Vista, please comment."
,Nallen_M,2007-04-16T16:40Z,"Hi.
well the other torrent I uploaded her the NIS 2007 wasnt a trial. It was the retail version. I'm using it myself with Vista, and this version here is the same. And yes the phone trick works."
,sia,2007-04-16T17:43Z,Länge leve telefontricket !
,greybigtop,2007-04-16T18:49Z,"Maybe my memory is bad and it was the XP version, that was the trial version.
I immidiately noticed it when it did not asked for a serial and when it refused to switch to phone activation option after repeately trying to activate while disconnedted from the net."
,asko84,2007-04-16T18:53Z,Is this version for XP or Vista? And..what is the phone trick and how to do this??
,Nallen_M,2007-04-16T19:01Z,"Some are for just XP and some for both XP and Vista. There are instructions to every program on how to install it.
And yep I remember that the NIS for XP was abit strange....But it works under Vista."
,greybigtop,2007-04-16T20:46Z,"Just tried your ""GOLDEN EDITION"" ON 4!!! DIFFERENT VISTA MACHINES.
Install FAILED on every single one.!"
,Nallen_M,2007-04-16T21:51Z,What prog did fail?
,Nallen_M,2007-04-16T21:53Z,And BTW it's not mine.....just found this on another site.....
,greybigtop,2007-04-16T23:25Z,"NIS failed with the same error message on all machines.
I have reason to believe that the keygen works great as I have tried keygens from the same ""producer"" with NAV on Vista and it worked perfectly.
ALL we really need is a genuine copy of the retail versions of Norton Internet Security for XP & VISTA.
Any links or uploads? "
,Nallen_M,2007-04-17T08:43Z,Well well seems that it works for some and dont work for some...
,Bardal,2007-04-20T18:40Z,"I just want to share my personal opinion.
Noton Antivirus and Internet Security is _bad_.
It sucks your memory and wont do you any good really.

Norton 360 is the way to go.
Its an superb antivirus, firewall and spyware remover.
It got it all, as well as a option to backup your private folders like pictures, music, videos etc.
and it takes allmost nothing of your memory (RAM).

Symantec has done a MAJOR upgrade from previous firewalls, antivirus' and internet security's.

If you download this, install the 360, it works on XP and Vista. Personally tried both.
Just read the instructions first :)"

,NoMecy,2007-09-09T10:26Z,"hi, i have problems with the activation. it seems that it only wants to activate by internett, how do i force it to avtivate by phone?"
,Grid2007,2007-12-19T20:59Z,"Norton 360 installed and worked.
But later, after updates, it crashed.
The Uninstall was long and annoying."
