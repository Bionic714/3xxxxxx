,nightsongz2,2007-04-30T04:39Z,"Quality was very watchable...good movie, too. Thanks!"
,StraatRat,2007-05-01T13:19Z,"please don't tell me this is another pitch black cam....that is even not worth downloading

...please, anyone?? quality picture/sound?"
,StraatRat,2007-05-01T21:04Z,"dear nightsongz2....

you must be as blind as Stevie Wonder once was...

this is a cam; dark, and relatively bad sound quality

movie must be good; i'll wait for another release"

So when you talk about quality it is quite relative. Here we have af cam version, so if someone says it is good, he probably means ""it's good for a cam version""."
,Solaba,2007-06-22T12:02Z,"Sorry.. It is ALMOST the same as a cam-version, when you say telesync. Though telesync is supposed to be better, but that's not always true."
