Nine Inch Nails playing "The Hand That Feeds" live at Vega in Copenhagen, Denmark on April 6 2007.

Coming up soon: Gave Up and Eraser. Also some still pictures.

I sadly didn't have enough memory card to record the whole show, but I spotted alot of others in the crowd filming, so I urge you all to share your stuff too.

Thank you.
