1. Open the RAR file with Winrar or whatever you use. Go into the opened folder and install the program & restart your computer before applying anything.
2. Go to the ""Crack"" folder and right-click and copy the ""TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.exe"" file.
3. Go to C:/Program Files/Pegasys Inc/TMPGEnc DVD Author 3 with DivX Authoring and right-click on an empty space and click ""paste""...a pop-up will ask you if you want to replace the other file with the newer one...click ""YES"" and then you can close that folder.
4. Go back to the ""Crack"" folder and right-click & copy the ""TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.en.lic"" file and then go to C:/Documents and Setting/User/Application Data/Pegasys Inc/TMPGEncDVDAuthor3 folder and paste and replace the other file with the new one the same way you did with the other file...close the folder and you're good to go.
Windows, by default, hides the ""Application Data"" folder so if you cannot see it, then go to ""Tools"" at the top of the folder & on the drop down menu click ""Folder Options"" then click on the ""View"" tab...go down and check the ""Show hidden files and folders"" option...click ""Apply"" and then ""Ok""...you should now be able to see the ""Application Data"" folder. 
Another thing that you may find is that when you go to C:/Documents and Setting/user/Apllication Data/Pegasus Inc you may not see the ""TMPGEncDVDAuthor3"" folder which happened to me...all I did was start the TMPGEnc program and it will pop up wanting a serial number...after it pops up just exit the program and go back to the C:/Documents and Settings/user/Application Data/Pegusus Inc folder and you should now see the ""TMPGEncDVDAuthor3"" folder where you need to paste the ""TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.en.lic"" file...do that now and close the folder and you're all set. Also when I say C:/Documents and Settings/User "

,nightsongz2,2007-04-12T19:07Z,"""User"" is the name you gave your pc when you installed Windows...it's NOT the ""All Users"" or ""Default User"" folder."
,Nautic,2007-04-15T12:50Z,"Thanks a lot !!!  Works like a charm.   :)
I followed your instructions to the tiniest detail. Worked right away.  And what a program !
I use it for authoring m2p files (raw DVD data) ...it's the best and easiest i have ever tried. Gonna buy it at a later time :)            Thanks again  :)"
,photoreporter,2007-04-21T23:26Z,thanks
,cooter75,2007-04-29T06:26Z,"Great instructions. Followed and program worked great. Had a little trouble finding the place to put the license file, but opened the program as explained, and the directory showed up. Currently encoding DVD of .avi files. Only cons is that it re-encodes all the files and it is taking about 4hrs. Also, it only lets you burn 4GB instead of a full 4.7GB. Confused by that considering it only let me fit 3 - 700MB files on one disc. It must take a lot of space to make a DIVX Ultra disc, or I am doing something wrong. Any suggestions from experienced users?  Thanks for the great upload!"
,will_ecc,2007-06-17T17:45Z,"Followed nightsongz2's comments and it worked perfectly.
I use this to combine two ~700MB divx/xvid into one ~700 MB dixv, which works well but...
I had to use VirtualDUB (free) to remove the audio from the source divx's/xvid's and then add it back in with TMPG."
