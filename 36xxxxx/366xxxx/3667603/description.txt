These live recordings capture the classic John Coltrane Quartet at full strength in what would prove to be its last years of existence. The 1965 Half Note recordings, taken from late-night radio broadcasts and until now available only as inferior-quality bootlegs, have long had legendary status among afficionados -- especially the extended performance of "One Down, One Up," regarded by many as one of Coltrane's greatest record improvisations. Newly transferred from Coltrane's personal master tapes, these remarkable performance can at last be heard with the fidelity they deserve.
