,castiboy,2012-01-21T13:02Z,"You can verify a FLAC rip is lossless and not encoded from lossy mp3s with Audiochecker (google it), or Tau Analyzer (but it only works on burned CDs)."
,rovus,2012-08-16T04:52Z,"Audiochecker results are MPEG 95%

Basically upconverted from mp3 to FLAC.

Do not download"
