IMDb......: http://imdblight.com/id/a0UOM3pcPgRifXQE-Grindhouse
Genres...: Action, Horror, Sci, Thriller
Year.....: 2007
Rating...: 8.3/10 with 23,305 ratings
Plot.....: From cult movie directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez comes a unique film experience: a double-bill of thrillers that recall both filmmakers' favorite exploitation films. ""Grindhouse"" (a downtown movie theater in disrepair since its glory days as a movie palace known for ""grinding out"" non-stop double-bill programs of B-movies) is presented as one full-length feature comprised of two individual films helmed separately by each director. Tarantino's film, ""Death Proof,"" is a rip-roaring slasher flick where the killer pursues his victims with a car rather than a knife, while Rodriguez's film ""Planet Terror"" shows us a view of the world in the midst of a zombie outbreak. The films are joined together by clever faux trailers that recall the '50s exploitation drive-in classics.
Filmed in: USA
Languages: English, Spanish"

,Widget:,2007-05-09T19:30Z,"Unfortunately not really much better quality then the cam releases out there.

In my personal rating (10 dvd quality)  it gets 5/10 video 5/10 audio.

I refuse to go through that torture watching obviously great movies with such hurting bad quality.

So there is no way other then to wait for a good rip in a few... months *cry* "

Well, you can always go to the cinema and watch it. It's probably even more of an thrill that way... ;-)"
,deckyg53,2007-05-24T08:20Z,"I'm extremely new to this. Five minutes, actually. Would anyone out there kindly tell me how to download movies? I clicked on ""Download This Torrent"" and it went to my desktop, but then the computer said ""There was an error in opening this movie."" So would anyone be kind enough to give me a step-by-step description of how to do it. Or at the least the bare basics. It would be greatly appreciated, and I promise I'll find someway to thank you. Thanks in advance!"

If you click the pirate ship in the upper left corner of the page, you'll get back to the frontpage. There you will find a link: ""How do I download?"". That's what you're looking for."
