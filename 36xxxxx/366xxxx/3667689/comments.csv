Otherwise thank you very much to the uploader. I am a fan of the Practice and even a bigger fan of Boston Legal, and this season is a must have to see where Alan Shore comes from."
,kenzo69,2008-10-29T01:16Z,"Does anyone know where to find skandinavian or english subs for this series?

Thnks to the uploader for sharing this for all of us that loved Boston Legal and didn't have the chance to watch The Practice.

And...where is season 5???? It's the only season not on the tracker..."

,toonman361,2010-01-02T06:18Z,"For some odd reason, starting with ep. 6 (wide screen), all the file sizes appear correct for a program of this length but each contain only 2-3 seconds of video. I've tried several playback apps but it's the same."
,groumly,2010-01-15T06:22Z,"toonman361: indeed, quicktime chokes on the video starting at episode 6.
However, VLC 1.0.0 on mac plays the video fine, I just tested with a few episode, and there is no reason it won't work on windows or linux.

I guess the encoding is somehow bad, causing QT to fail after 5 seconds."
,toonman361,2010-01-16T07:09Z,"Thanks Groumly, I'm using Mac OS 10.4.11. VLC 10.0 won't work on 10.4. I may have to upgrade at least one partition. Thanks again."
,Harvard531,2010-01-27T04:49Z,"Why is there only 5 seconds of video, even though I downloaded the entire file? 

I have downloaded other shows/movies and everything works fine, so it has to be this particular file. I've also tried downloading this onto another computer and the same thing happens.

Can somebody PLEASE HELP ME. I really want to see the last four episodes. Thanks."
