,jackregan,2007-04-15T10:31Z,"This is the first comment i write and i´m very impressed that there is so much interest in these old films. Oh i know they are great but i thought  films of this sort where a bit too old for people
nowdays,luckily i was wrong. So please do keep up the good work and let all the goodness from
Italian film flow into the eagerly waiting computers of the world. Thank you all who makes this happend. A small question anybody
got Keooma witch is in my humble opinion the best spaggetiwestern of all time i got it on vhs
but i haven´t found any good dvd edition.
Let it flow and once again thanks"
