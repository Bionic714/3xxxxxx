,tr0ma,2007-04-17T15:41Z,"I AM seeding, as far as I can tell :-)"
,Flabbergast_the_White,2007-05-20T20:33Z,Any ideas about how I can fix the IFO so that Nero can burn this?  It says its missing a VOB file...
,thommed,2007-06-02T01:22Z,The same for me
,ektakrome,2007-06-02T03:36Z,"Same for me, hey troma, you wanna help us fix this please."
,ektakrome,2007-06-02T04:00Z,"I just went and burned it using nero. There was the warning before burning, but I went ahead and burned it, it works just fine in my Toshiba SD3990 DVD player. So thank you tr0ma."
,thommed,2007-06-02T12:51Z,I ignored the warnings and it seems that it worked out OK.
