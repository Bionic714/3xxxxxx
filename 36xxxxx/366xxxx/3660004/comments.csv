,jengiscan,2009-10-19T17:53Z,"I love Seinfeld, I love Curb.....this movie however is reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeal bad .
I actually stopped watching about half way through and deleted it.
For me not to watch a film through to the end it has to be very very very bad.
Keep the love for Larry alive and do not download this lame weak cliche ridden crap."
