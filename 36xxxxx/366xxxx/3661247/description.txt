In Undeveloped tech, Dennis Lee shows off some sterling engines, one as big as a 1800's steam engine (cool) he also demonstrates the EV Gray motor, the principle of back-EMf, and wireless transmission of electricity with tesla coils. he also shows off a little device made of two small rods which makes 120volts @ 18W (not easy to fake) also shown is a ramjet tornado engine this is a very exciting invention, It synthesizes a tornado inside of itself, and uses it to compress fuel, and turn a turbine (huge amount of horsepower) he also shows the many uses of brown's gas, and even has some rare videos of Yull Brown operating the torch, and generator. They prove that brown's gas implodes, and prove that a generator can make a car engine idle. He shows off plastic (lego like assembly) houses which look just as if they were made of wood. he shows a motor which puts out three times the power going in, and an apperatice to make car engines run on solid biofuel. he also shows a bouy which generates power from the wave action. then the whole show starts to get just a little silly. he starts talking about a fourth law of motion, that is if you hook the motor stator to one gear, and the armature to another gear, the motor will be more powerful, but since the armature, and stator are moving, the bearings are turning twice as fast and it will do nothing but melt lots of bearings. and he caps it all of with a mechanical device which is supposed to amplify torque, and leave rpm's static. either I or they have some learning to do! This Movie Shows Valuable clips of among other things, the EV Gray motor working, with occiliscope shots! 

An indispensable piece for any free energy experimenter's library
