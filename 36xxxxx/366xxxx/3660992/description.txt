Rippers Notes:

Happy Easter :) Here the new Album of Assemblage23.

Work has wrapped up on the new Assemblage 23 album,
entitled "Meta". The ten track album has turned out
to be A23's most varied-sounding release to date
containing everything from hard-hitting EBM to
smooth, lush ballads, and many surprises in between.
The album will be preceded by the 5-track maxi-single
"Binary", which will be released at the end of March
on Metropolis Records in the US, and Accession
Records in Europe and elsewhere.
