Det här problemet kanske kan rättas till genom att du installerar om programmet"" å det är ju jävligt lätt i detta fallet. Vill bara varna er andra att det saknas filer så glöm att det går att spela. Tack för ingenting."
,Dumdidump,2007-04-14T19:10Z,"Works fine after dowloading  the file d3dx9_32.dll. Just go to this link "" http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_32 "" and unzip to into the ""Silent Hunter 4 -directory"".

Dada...the game starts!

Lätt fixat, lycka till!"
,420dopeman,2007-04-14T21:08Z,"Dumdidump 
that is an excellent temporary fix, however that files belongs in your windows/system32 folder and is part of DIRECTX.

My advice is simply to download and install the LATEST april version of DIRECTX. Otherwise other NEW games will not work without it.

Cheers."
,420dopeman,2007-04-14T21:13Z,"Here guys, I advise EVERYONE to pick up the latest DX9 below:

,corleonedk,2007-07-15T22:51Z,"Any chance you will make a 1,3 patch doperman? or does the game security prevent you from doing that.Its a great game but seriusly bugged,and alot of them is corrected in the 1,3 patch."

Please seed!!

Thanks"
,Angerfist2,2008-02-17T16:51Z,"The reason why the characters are flat and that they just call some numbers is because of the security of the game.

When you have installed a no-dvd crack, the game see it, and activate the security mode of the game. That the one, where characters are flat, en people call all numbers."
,buuqq,2008-02-22T21:10Z,how do you upgrade this game ie add the patches as it will not be in the installed games list (add/remove programs) and when I try to add the patch it will not upgrade
,SweGrizz,2008-02-23T21:41Z,"Its not working for me ingame, its no tutorial or training, and when i first play it im just crashing..."

,Orozar,2008-04-16T12:05Z,"how can i start th downloading? All i see is ""download this torrent"" what makes me download a 20kB file?? So what should i do?"
,DoctorMe,2008-05-10T04:40Z,"Orozar, you need to learn before you come onto a site like this. Either you're a kid or a moron- don't ask me which is worse. Because I'm feeling nice I'll give you some hints: GOOGLE, WIKIPEDIA, TORRENT."

,little_horn_is_born,2008-09-03T23:01Z,i am not saying any one is stupid but you cant in stall the game if you are seeding it with the same folder files will go missing in the install
,Learjetmech,2008-12-02T01:03Z,"Game works great..!! but you need to do a virus scan first. I found a key logger in mine. other then that, it works grat."
,Learjetmech,2008-12-02T01:12Z,"By the way, is there a ""CD"" code so you can go on line to play..? that would be super. thanks for the download man."
,Ockonal,2008-12-20T23:45Z,"Seed, pls."
,sniffytoe,2008-12-29T03:08Z,*NOT FOR ONLINE PLAY* This works great but Silent Hunter 3 is much much more stable and has better gameplay in my opinion. Check out the dopeman rip for silent hunter 3! It works great online too
,talamos,2009-02-14T18:05Z,"I just want to say thanks to dopeman. I only started downloading games a little while ago (for trial purposes of course). It took me ages to undersatnd how it all worked, mounting, cracks, cd-keys etc etc. But this is the easiest rip I've ever encountered. The game works great but some codecs will cause it to function incorrectly (2d, and men keep saying random numbers) delete the codecs or use a seperate partition for playing games (as I do) and it works perfectly. The only negative thing I have to say has nothing to do with Dopeman's rip (because that just rocks so bloody much) it's about the game. The game looks gorgeous, graphics are great but the game itself just isn't. If you want a good sub sim, you have to get Silent Hunter 3, the graphics are no where near as good, but it's such a brilliant game, much better than this.
 Thanks a lot Dopeman, I can't wait to see what your other games are like... For trial purporses you understand ;)"
,Axe_79,2009-04-12T14:41Z,"hey dopeman i put in already one request for subzero but i will ask you to, because you two are uploading good stuff so i hope that it will be possibel, i have one game in particular that i lie to play but i cant find it any where any more to buy... OFP - Operation flashpoint cold war crisis, if you can find out and post a direct play of the goty edition of the game it will be great  the game is from codemasters thanks any how.. O yeah this game is a great upload "
,tyko20,2009-07-07T16:50Z,"hey dopeman i'm having a problem with some of your games like silent hunter 3 and 4..when i start playing its all normal,but out of nowhere my computer shuts down completly and restarts...it get kinda annoying..u know whats this all about??? stay cool"
