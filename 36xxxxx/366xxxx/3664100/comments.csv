,QuidamPhoenix,2007-04-14T19:14Z,"Also, in case anyone was wondering, the files are LAME 3.92 mp3, using VBR 0. They've all been taken from their respective albums, except The Bridge School Collection, which I had to download from iTunes. The protected files were then converted to mp3, which sucks, but with very little quality loss. Better than nothing!:)"

,Call-Me-Kenneth,2009-03-19T22:46Z,"For Dlers, there's one album missing (2007- ""The con"") and many eps. but thats ok since the album came after this torrent. :) just remember to pick it up from somewhere else. (buying it might help)

there's a new Ep btw, ""Ill take the blame"". from late 2008.

PS: buy some of their stuff, they deserve your hard earned money. :3 (as most of the other artists do.)"
