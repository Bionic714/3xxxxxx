Finally, here is the first audio recording of a full-length,live de Mello conference, the tapes which his audiences have requested for years. Even though de Mello gave
innumberable workshops around the world, he never allowed any of his talks to be recorded. In 1986 at Fordham University in New York, he allowed this conference to be videotaped by a professional television company. On these tapes, you will hear Tony de Mello at his best, just himself, completely at home with a responsive audience.
