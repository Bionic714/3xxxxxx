,Sarre,2007-04-15T05:30Z,"Some tips: You'll want to run with the software renderer, or the game will likely crash on start (run MM7Setup as necessary). Also, in the game first thing, enter options and set turning rate to ""Smooth"" or you won't be able to navigate (the game runs super fast on modern computers).

As far as I can tell the game is unprotected, although old safedisc files are included upon install. I believe these have been disabled in the re-issue.

Enjoy and don't forget to comment/rate."
,Sarre,2007-04-15T05:45Z,"Okay, it seems to run under XP with the Direct3D renderer _if_ you set the MM7.exe to ""Windows 98"" compatibility mode. This allows control of ""Blood splats"", ""Colored lights"" and ""Tinting"" under graphics options in-game, and give the game some filtering for a somewhat smoother look."
,Sarre,2007-04-15T16:20Z,"The game as an built-in no-cd option. Copy the ""Magic7.vid"" from the second CD to your installation Anims directory, and then create in the game root a file ""mm6.ini"" containing the lines:

[settings]
use_cd = 0"
,Sarre,2007-04-15T22:19Z,"I was tipped to an unofficial 1.2-patch available at the URL below. I recommend it for increased stability under XP and some bugfixes.

,martinlol,2007-05-02T18:41Z,how do you make the game run properly on XP? mine crashes on start. Could anybody be so nice to give a explanation on how to make the game work on a XP?
,martinlol,2007-05-02T19:12Z,"Nvm, found out... Sarre, could you please explain (with more details) how im gonna do the thing with the no-cd use?"

,Garfielder,2007-09-30T00:52Z,"Thanks alot, I've been wanting to play this game for so long, ever since I smashed the play CD in my old computer after installing it....

And ofc. even moreafter I just finished M&M2 on my Mobile :P"
,Dxan,2007-12-09T01:09Z,"thanks for uploading this Sarre :)

But i also stumble across the same problems as the others here and your tips are hard to understand. Could you please post a detailed walk through on how to fix it?"
,du_reject,2008-01-20T06:25Z,"TO GET MM7 TO WORK ON WINXP

DOWNLOAD UNOFFICIAL PATCH to 1.2 (check sarre's posts)

on mm7-rel.exe, right click it then go under the compatibility tab. Click the box for ""run this program in compatibility mode"" and select Windows 98/ME under it.

Should work then, even if you select hardware accel and whatnot."

,Brodan155,2008-06-02T07:51Z,How do I install this? I am not the best with this stuff help?
,celardweller,2008-06-08T11:32Z,"Luum, you need to download and install the latest version of Daemon tools. Once thats done mount the image of the CD1 to install the game. Then unmount CD1 and mount CD2 to play the game."
,celardweller,2008-06-08T11:33Z,My game freezes after I make my party and click begin. Does anyone know a solution for this?
,SevenSinsXxX,2008-06-30T09:04Z,Hey yeah i have the same problem as the guy above me. i got the patch working and i got in running in windows 98 comp. but everytime i try to make a party it says Direct Draw Error...anyone has an answer for this?
,Rijzerlo,2008-07-04T19:38Z,"Hey I got the same problem as zzzxxxyyy, as soon as I try to start te game i get a windows error report, and also the grey screen...

My brother also downloaded MM7 and he gets it to run, mostly because at some point in the installation program, it asks to insert CD2, mine installs entirly on CD1, in the windows error it claims that i have lost files, which maybe is logical for some reason.

Has anyone encountered this problem does somebody have a solution??? "
,szro,2008-07-12T18:23Z,"sorry, but i need help.. im kinda noob at everything. ilove this game and also DLed the files but somehow i dont know how to install it. coz in disk1&2 has only *.bin files.

,Ayrios,2008-07-14T18:50Z,downloads daemon tools an mount the image an it installs but the only problem im having is when im playin and i set a spell sometimes it will be fine an cast then when im playin for few hours it will just keep goin to the book which i dont get is i already set the spell an it was workin for hours before
,Lyrazel,2008-07-24T08:51Z,"Ok, I actually have the disks, and the detailed info on making it run in Win98 was VERY helpful.  Only problem now, is that everything is shifted to the right once the game comes up.  I'm sure there is a way to make it centered on the screen properly, but I don't know it.  Can I possibly get some more detailed help?  Thanks!  :D"
,Vashxux,2008-08-12T00:58Z,"I have the game Dled and it works fine accept for a rather annoying white flash ever second or so and it gives me a headach. Anyone know how to fix it or what to change to fix it cause it makes game kinda unplayable.
Thanks Sarre :P"
,cypherdtraitor,2008-08-13T01:42Z,"Ok, I guess I'm kinda new at this.

I downloaded the files, and I have Daemon Tools, but I still can't figure out how to load up the game. I have tried mounting the .RAR files, and even the .BIN files, but I can't get the thing to run. I click on the virtual disk and all I get is that the file is not in a readable format.

Help?"
,astropheonix,2008-08-13T05:47Z,"i'm getting the same exact problem as cypherdtraitor
is there any way to fix it? please help if there is! "
,zorrask,2008-09-23T05:23Z,Vashxux ive noticed that if u turn off/disble the accelerated 3D audio in the configuration utility it should solve the flashing problem. as for you others getting the .bin file to show whats inside of it and then creating an image of all those items should allow you to mount the data itself to a vdrive. then u just have to go in and find the setup in the setup folder to get it to install. the unofficial patch mentioned earlier is a good way to get it to play without needing to have the things mounted still.
,cefacialtfel,2008-09-30T17:46Z,"thanks for uploading this,but i just can't manage to run the installer. i tried running it in compatibility mode for win95 and win98, but it simply does nothing (it stays open under Processes, but it does nothing)"

,Nihogz,2010-06-04T03:45Z,"Downloaded this today, and I am sorry to say, it seems very hard to install with Vista 64bit. Not sure it can be done. I got to the Macromedia install menu, but the rest will not launch. And I only got that far, as I used over 2 hours trying different combinations of compatibility, colors and such. If anyone should be succsessful installing it on Vista (64b) Please comment. (Seeing as most of the comments are old and about XP problems, I thought I would let you know it's even harder with Vista....) :( A truly great game this though. Considering making a partition with Windows 95 or 98 solely for this game! :P"

,letteralex,2012-01-30T20:33Z,"Can someone comment on the ""cant install problem"" cause ppl (aswell as myself) have this problem and cant seem to find an answer not by googling nor in the comment section.

What happens is i run the autorun ans select install; nothing happens. When i manually open the disc and select setup; nothing happens."
,FlameKoRn,2012-02-06T23:13Z,My installs goes like this: Installshield gets to 99% and then it closes and no install.. does that to all types of compability. any help pls?
,Fyffetimesbetter,2012-02-15T17:03Z,"Oh my, I finally made it work!

I'm using Windows 7 and had a hard time making it work, but now all of a sudden it works without any problems. Weird.

Anyway, so here's what I did to make it work:
1. Unzipped both rar-files that came along with the torrent.
2. Mounted CD1 (not the .bin file) with Daemon tools, and it told me to install macromedia flash. So I did. After that, a new program installed and in this, I could choose if I wanted to install MM7. I clicked on the install button.
3. The installation seemed to work pretty well, but it pointed out that I don't have directX6, Win 98/ME or something else I don't remember. When i pressed on the shortcut to open the game, the little box where you choose how to play it (with which graphic card and so on) came up, and after choosing to play the game, a gray screen came up, and then the game ended and it says that Windows found and error and couldn't figure out how to solve the problem. Plan B!
4. After trying many ways to open, like editing how to open the program by choosing ""open with compability with windows XP"" and so on, I came here to look out for a solution.
5. I found some guys talking about that one patch, and that it would solve my problem: 

http://www.celestialheavens.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=10078&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0

I downloaded the patch for the english version, and then I tried the program again. And it works! Why? No idea, but it works!"
,begal.segoro,2012-08-27T13:43Z,"Works like a charm. Just download Disc 1 if you don't need the audio tracks, do a complete install, and patch with GreyFace patch 1.62 here:
http://www.celestialheavens.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=10078

Works in Win7 32bit."
