Does someone have a working CD key for this program? Or a Key gen?? PLEASE post!"
,fedrik,2007-06-30T08:18Z,What is a 'Portable'?
,daxecutioner,2007-07-13T16:52Z,"TroNi, the last name in the serial.txt file worked for me, just copy and paste.

fedrik, a ""portable"" is a file that does not need to be installed to run, thus can be easily run off a ""portable"" device such as a flash drive. Very useful!

Thanks for this, persianwarez."

,Capt_Tripod,2007-12-20T05:51Z,I can't get any of the PW to work. Does it require a net connection to resolve?
,Capt_Tripod,2007-12-20T06:10Z,"Nevermind, I just answered my own question. The registration requires a net connection, decline the update, use the last Name/Serial combo  in the Text file."
