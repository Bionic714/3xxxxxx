,Enthol,2007-04-21T01:00Z,"Eller köra spelet med Win 95 compatabilety mode?

Höger klicka exe filen, välj egenskaper, andra fliken sen välj Win 95. Jag vet inte vad fanskapet heter på svenska, så du får lista ut det själv"

,ZuBRich,2007-04-22T13:32Z,"well, i don't undestand what u wrote here...
But if you wand to start this game, u have to install WinME at least... or 95 or 98...

Is that a program that allows you to play the game even though you use XP?"
,Tanis.Z.Saori,2007-06-03T08:54Z,"Oh yeah btw ZuBRich, do you know of any other warhammer games, that isn't warhammer 40k?"
,ZuBRich,2007-06-08T20:24Z,"sure =)

Dark Omen
Mark of Chaos
Battle for Atluma"
,Tanis.Z.Saori,2007-06-09T20:35Z,"Nice. But what about that VMWare, is it a game that allows you to play the game, even though using XP?"
,ZuBRich,2007-06-10T21:52Z,"VMware = Virtual PC

You can install win98\Me\95 etc inside this programm... 
And use it in the Window, so there is no problem to start old games."

,CakeMonster,2007-12-28T12:22Z,"Go to www.vmware.com and downloaded the WORKSTATION by doing this

First when you click to download workstation it asks you to register so I filled in a correct email address

After that I clicked on the button resend mail because the first mail didn?t reach me. In the mail I got a link to click and from that link I downloaded the 314mb ?version 6? exe file. On that link you also get a code, the program is free to try for 30 days you can probably find a cracked version somewhere. I got version 6 but maybe when you are reading this there is a version 7 8 9 10 11 who knows but the procedure will be the same first register then get the mail then click the link then download from that link and copy the code unless of course you get a cracked version.


"
,CakeMonster,2007-12-28T12:22Z,"After I installed the program I selected and clicked the button ?New virtual machine?, then I picked windows 95 and gave it 2 GB of space.  And the program gave itself 64mb of ram, you can change this if you want.
You NEED to get a win 95cd or download it"
,CakeMonster,2007-12-28T12:25Z,"Start the virtual machine program and there should be a tab just above the 3 icons, next to home called ?windows 95? if you have done the steps above 
In Edit select options and choose in that the CD drive should be where you have the daemon tools file of win95 or directly choose the iso, I chose to call my fake daemon tools driver E as cd file

Then I selected start this virtual machine and it directly went to install window of windows 95
"
,CakeMonster,2007-12-28T12:25Z,"I pressed enter then enter again under the long option then when it said please in boot disk I did NOT and just pressed enter again and everything went fine, the windows install program came up and everything was cake

If it bugs for you then get a boot disk and put it in when the windows install program says put it in then if vmware bugs and says can?t find the boot disk bla bla bla just take the disk out and press enter and it should work also
To type inside the virtual machine program you must click on the window and to go out you must press ctrl+alt"
,CakeMonster,2007-12-28T12:26Z,"If you have a Swedish keypad then the ? ? ? button is the same button that gives this sign ? ? ? which you need to enter in between the numbers in the serial code for the windows 95 disk
When Windows has been installed it might say setup has discovered a floppy disk in your drive even when you do not have a disk in your drive, just press ok 
When the windows restarts it told me it can?t find the buslogic.mpd file or something like that I just clicked skip file and it worked fine"
,CakeMonster,2007-12-28T12:26Z,"When windows 95 is up in your virtual machine window click the VM button in the upper menu and select install vm tools and then select install and it should do everything automatically
After I installed VM tools the svga did not install automatically so I need to go to the control panel dubble click on display select settings folder then change display and in the upper level select have disk look under C vmware vmware drivers video svga ok ok restart when I restarted I selected 256 colors from right clicking on desktop and then finally after 1 million years could I install the game"

Double-click the Add New Hardware icon in the Windows Control Panel (Start > Settings > Control Panel). Click Next. 
Select Yes for Do you want Windows to search for new hardware? 
Click Next. 
Click Next again. Windows runs the autodetection and says it is ready to finish. 
If prompted to do so, insert the Windows CD-ROM into the drive and click OK. 
Click Finish. "

,CannabisKing,2011-07-03T01:00Z,"1 seed? Are you fucking serious?? What type of prick downloads and doesn't seed?
Thanks ZuBRich, it's nice to see people still appreciating Warhammer fantasy. 40k is still fun and all but it's so overdone in comparison to fantasy. Although I will admit my miniatures collection are mostly based around 40k (Eldar and Space marines)"
