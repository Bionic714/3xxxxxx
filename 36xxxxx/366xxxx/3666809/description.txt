ALL YOU NEED TO START 3D MODELLING IN BLENDER 3D


What is Blender?


Blender is a free 3D animation program. It can be used for modelling,
uv unwrapping, texturing, rigging, skinning, animating, rendering,
particle and other simulating, non-linear editing, compositing, and
creating interactive 3D applications.

Blender has a robust feature set similar in scope and depth to other high-end
3D software such as Softimage|XSI, Cinema 4D, 3D Studio Max and Maya. These
features include advanced simulation tools such as rigid body dynamics, fluid
dynamics, and softbody dynamics, modifier based modeling tools, powerful
character animation tools, a node based material and compositing system
and an embedded scripting engine based on Python.

Blender is available for several operating systems, including Microsoft
Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, IRIX, Solaris, FreeBSD, SkyOS, MorphOS and
Pocket PC.

This package includes:


1) Blender 2.43 for Windows, Linux
2) The Excellent video "Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain" by Betty Edwards
If you like it (and you will) consider supporting the author by buying
a hardcopy.
3) 60+ Video tutorials (more than 10 hours in total) were taken from different internet sources - all the credit
goes to their authors. Most of the videos contain the source website information.
Visit them for more great tutorials and tips.
4) Some official blender demos
5) Materials libraries
