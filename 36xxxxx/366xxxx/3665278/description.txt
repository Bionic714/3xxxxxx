Super Bowl XLI - 2007 - Indianapolis Colts Vs Chicago Bears (Ripped from HDTV)

Audio: English 5.1 (AC3)

Resolution: 640x352 (XviD)

This is a very high quality widescreen avi with 5.1 stereo...I highly recommend 

using VLC media player so you can change the audio channel to 5.1 and it sounds so 

much better even if you only have 2.1 speakers. VLC player gives you alot more 

control over your video and audio. Get it here:

Remember, this has an AC3 audio file, so if you hear no sound then you don't have 

the AC3 audio filter installed which is available here:
