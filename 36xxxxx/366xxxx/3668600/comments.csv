,jacanarch57,2007-04-22T10:19Z,i've been waiting forever for someone to upload some old stephi-model pics; why is no one seeding?
,trobins,2007-04-24T21:57Z,"I'd seed if I could DL the file, but I'm stalled at 7.8%"
,trobins,2007-04-24T21:58Z,"Sorry. That's 7.38%

I'll keep trying for a few more hours, then I'll give up."
