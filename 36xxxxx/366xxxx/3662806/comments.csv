,who_am_I_123,2007-04-14T04:55Z,"I only found this and uploaded it. It was subbed by a fan not by a subbing group. If you can't wait to see it download this. If you want it for a collection wait for a subbing group to sub it.

Quality isn't that bad. It was done in mpg so it has all the usual problems anything in mpg has."
