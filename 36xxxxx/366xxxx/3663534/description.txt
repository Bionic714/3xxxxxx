This is the real Razor 1911 keygen.  caros2005, uploaded it here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3641450/Warcraft_III_Reign_of_Chaos_and_The_Frozen_Throne___Crack__Patch and the fucking cocksucker included it in a file called warcraft3keygen.exe that was 1,220,336 KB in size.  Unfortunately, Nod32 Anti-virus, AVG Anti-spyware, and a2 Anti-malware do not detect anything in this.  When you open it, these files are extracted 'warcraft3keygen.exe' (61,440 KB, the actual Keygen) and 'Blizzard .exe' (662,476 KB) to a temp directory.  Then 'Blizzard .exe' creates 2 files in c:\Program Files\Intel called SVCH0ST.exe (662,476 KB, it is a zero, not the letter O) and SVCH0ST.DLL (611,328 KB) and runs SVCH0ST.exe that tries to "phone home".  Then SVCH0ST.exe starts Internet Explorer in a hidden window.  I don't know what it accesses cause I denied everything network access using Jetico firewall.

So here is the actual Keygen for Warcraft III Reign of Chaos.  The file is an .exe so I understand if your cautious about it.  But I have run it 3 or 4 times, and it has not tried to "phone home" or anything other than just give a key for Warcraft III.  So enjoy.
