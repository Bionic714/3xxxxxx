,russin666,2008-03-30T14:05Z,"ok, got it now. donno why didn't work at first"
,sonofbrundleflypod,2008-03-31T00:52Z,Downloaded both Season 1 and 3 from Thachinky and they're both excellent quality rips.  Strange how there doesn't seem to be any dvdrips of Season 4 anywhere.  Any chance Thachinky?  The best I could find is a collection of pre-air review rips with an annoying number in the top right of the screen.

It's a shame ppl write such stupid shit cause it affects how many seeders there are.  How come I didn't get a letter for season 1 and 2?  And what about all my Sopranos DVDs from Cambodia.  HBO are slacking off with my paperwork.  

Cheers again for the great torrents.  The wire is a fantastic series.  Not as good as Breaking Bad thou.  That series is the best.  If you download the first episode and are not impressed you can send me a letter as well."

,zergoose,2008-11-23T03:24Z,"you fucking morons who say HBO isnt really on this torrent. what the fuck do you know, really. I have gotten two letters from my cable company so far to cease and desist dl'ing and they were both from HBO shows. I dont think you morons realize HBO has no commercials so they make all the money for their shows off DVD sales and HBO subscription fees. Not every HBO show torrent will get you caught, but this one will

Also to the guy who said the people saying this work for HBO................ are you a retarded person? If your not in the US maybe your safe but people that say HBO is on this torrent are helping you you fucking morons, Fuck this torrent and fuck Thachinky

,usarsenal,2009-06-23T13:41Z,"Folks, those who say they were contacted by either HBO or their cable company ARE NOT LYING.  In fact, I have DL'ed many thngs from Pirate Bay, and I have never ever received anything from my Cable Company (Cablevision) about DL'ing anything.  However, I DID receive an email from them just yesterday titles ""WARNING: Copyright Infringement Notification""..   It is not a joke that people are getting letters or contacted by their cable companies for DL'ing The Wire.  I don't really care about the email, but I just thought you should know that those who are claiming to have been contacted are REALLY being contacted..  Cheers for the upload though..  quality show"
,ardyroy,2009-07-21T03:32Z,"I got a call today from David Simon, the creator of the wire! He said, it is soo not cool to download his series for free. He also mentioned: Limiting your uploadrate does NOT make filesharing more legal!

,BigDaddyAddy,2009-08-27T23:14Z,"Has anyone in Canada been contacted by HBO or recieved any kind of letter after downloading this? I'm well aware of many people in the states but have no clue about ""up here""."
,ghostofmccleve,2009-09-08T07:54Z,"God people can be morons.

No, the people who said they have been contacted by HBO or their ISP are not lying. Obviously, Media Sentry (or whomever HBO hired to track the IPs of the people downloading this) is downloading/sharing this torrent as well, so they can compile a list of IP addresses who are sharing it. They then contact the ISP who owns that address and lets them know that one of their subscribers is downloading a copyrighted material.

Folks, it is imperative that you use PeerGuardian. The last time I got a cease/desist letter from anyone was three years ago. It was the one and only time it happened, because after that, I got PeerGuardian and have been downloading safely since.

And don't be a noob and say ""DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!1111;3lke"" You have no idea what you're talking about: HBO didn't upload this file, they're not about to break down your door, etc. They're just sharing this file, same as everyone else to get your information...that's why PeerGuardian is so necessary.

Stop shitting your pants and stop being ass hats to each other. Some people just don't know so you need to tell them, but you don't have to be dicks about it."

HBO can lick my taint.. they kept the wire off the air for like 2 years after season 3, and guess what? nobody bothered to watch seasons 4 & 5, HBO you really know how to kill off great tv shows"

,Moops420,2012-07-30T10:50Z,"Hey Thachinky, thank you for a good download! No b.s. on this, just good ole .avi files. So thank the Thachinky!"
,Moops420,2012-07-30T11:58Z,"Guess I should have read the comments before downloading, but I have to agree: I don't think HBO has the lawyers, money and time to sue everyone, but it is still possible that they could pick a few downloaders  at random and sue them to scare everyone else, but I doubt the pirates on this site would give a damn anyway. So, I guess I'll wait for my letter. Funny thing is, my ISP is a tiny one run by an old friend of mine, and he could give a shit if HBO contacted him about me, and he might have a good laugh about it since I've known him for forty years, but he could care less what I download. One thing I wonder: If you don't sign up so you can make comments, and just download anonymously, would HBO detect you? Anyone know? If however, HBO contacts me, I won't tell them to go fuck themselves, I'll tell them thank you for the download because I'm too broke to pay 60 bucks a month (for cable) to watch one T.V. show. Ditto with Breaking Bad. At the end of the day, anyway you want to sugar coat it, we are stealing copyrighted material, But I don't make copies and go downtown and sell them on the street. If I was running a network, when a t.v. season ended for a show, I would build a company web site that would distribute torrents of that show WITH THE COMMERCIALS. Then when people download the show and watch the commercials, the Network would be paid by advertisers. Then the Network has two ways to distribute its product and make even more money, and we get a free download, and everybody wins. The networks probably prefer to put the shows in boxed sets, but they could do that as well and also distribute the re-runs from their own torrent site and as said, make a profit off the commercials that are left on. Look at the benefits: The company can beat the pirates at their own game and make money off of their own torrents. That way we would get downloads of perfect quality, with no guilt. Of course this would not work for HBO since they don't have commercials, but this makes sense for dozens of other cable providers. Feel free to comment on this idea, I think a network that is first to do this could make big money from this, and it allows a wider audience for the commercials that pay the bills. And you're probably thinking right now that people will just speed thru the commercials and ignore them, and a few will, but think about it: how many people turn off the sound for every commercial on the show they watch on television? Few do. So this network torrents idea could have wings. Feel free to comment on this idea. In a way, Pirate Bay is ahead of the curve, since it has been predicted for years now that t.v. will morph into an interface like this one where you download each week's new show, and watch it at a convenient time, with commercials included. Maybe if the uploaders left the commercials in the t.v. shows, the networks wouldn't try to crack down on illegal downloads, and just ignore them."
