,Smurfmannen,2007-04-25T12:22Z,Could someone with a fast upload start seeding? Its been downloading for 10kb/s 3 days in a row now. Thx
,oreee,2007-04-25T13:34Z,10 kb i got in 400 kb~ im on 60 % ^^
,pettson,2007-04-25T14:20Z,"I have been seeding since I uploaded the torrent, and I will continue to do that until everyone's got the hole thing. But it seems like everyone else that has got 100% has just left."
,Smurfmannen,2007-04-26T12:57Z,"This sucks it will take me 11 days from now, and im up in 30%. Fucking connection"
,pettson,2007-04-26T16:36Z,That sucks. To bad that you haven't got a connection to me yet. And it sucks even more that everyone that's downloaded everything just leaves that quick. I have as of now uploaded 320 GB. And no one else that has 100% is still seeding.
,oreee,2007-04-29T01:40Z,what happend to the seeding i get only -30-60 kbs/seks now and it will take me 24 h to finish
