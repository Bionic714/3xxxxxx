The first three series of Stargate Atlantis, in English without any text.

Most of them are ~350MiB. I have no clue of what they are encoded with, but I assume it\'s Xvid with AC3 sound. Anyways, I use VLC for playing them, so I don\'t have to worry about all those different codecs that are out there :P

Please seed for a very long time after you have got it down(it\'s quite a bunch of files), and remember that you shouldn\'t reduce your upload rate to speed up download, \'cause it will get your download to go slower too!

If you already have seen the first season or something like that and don\'t want that one, just unselected for your download, you can do that by using for example utorrent(windows) or ktorrent(linux).

So, have fun watching!
