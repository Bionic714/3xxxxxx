The debut album by one of the new generation of swedish metal up and coming bands. Maitreya has a beautiful blend of hard growling vocals and sweet clean vocals. The songs are perfectly arranged and the riffs well written. 
Bands like opeth comes to mind i a way but its in no way a rip-off. It feels like the band has it's own style.

Enjoy!
