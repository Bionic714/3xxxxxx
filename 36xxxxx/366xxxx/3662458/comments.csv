,BritneysOrifice,2007-04-12T22:51Z,"Yeah, PMDG released the 744 for FSX already. And FSXI and FSXII, too. It's compatible with all of them. And X-Plane, too. It's all here! Download and enjoy! (geezus)"
[V],captainahmed,2007-04-12T23:01Z,"There is nothing on PMDG website that says it works on FSX
All PMDG and PSS products are for FS9 untill patches available"
,BritneysOrifice,2007-04-12T23:49Z,Wow. Who would have guessed? :)
,PopArt,2007-04-13T01:23Z,"No really, I went to their website and....wait, I don't even have FSX. LOL."

,Dreamz84,2010-02-25T19:01Z,"Do not download this file if you're looking for the updated 1.2 version. This is the original 1.0 version and when it installs, it says v1.2 but when you open it up in FS9, it shows up as v1.0."
