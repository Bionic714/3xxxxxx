""""""""AMD 10.4.9 SSE3 Delta Update with netkas 10.4.9 autofsb kernel

Nvidia kexts aren't installed by default , they are in a separate package that you can install later. Device id supported are:

0x004010de 0x00f010de 0x022010de 0x014010de 0x016010de 0x009010de 0x01d010de 0x039010de 0x029010de 0x02e010de 0x032610de 0x016710de 0x016110de 0x039110de 0x032210de 0x032210de 0x039210de 0x004110de 0x039110de 0x016710de 0x00c310de 0x01df10de 0x004510de 0x00F610de 0x032610de 0x02e010de 0x014010de 0x02e110de

if your card insn't listed there don't install them unless you know how to recover.

During the first reboot you need to wait atleast 2mins because the rosetta cache and prebinding are rebuilt. Don't reset if you see any hd activity .

Ati kexts are in extensions 10.4.9 disabled , feel free to try them if you know what you are doing, i haven't messed with them because i don't have an ati card and i also hate ati :P"""""""""""

I too hate ati and their lack of support. Funny thing that AMD bought ati and are now the owners. lol AMD 1900XT."
