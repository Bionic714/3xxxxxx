,Boog_er,2007-09-07T23:54Z,will this work on vista?
,angelbabeok,2007-09-18T16:59Z,YES This works in Vista!!!
,agentshags,2007-09-25T20:49Z,"zomg thank you! Reflexive must have updated their shit cause my old crack didnt work any more, this on the other hand works GREAT!"
,evejenz,2007-12-08T03:43Z,God ! This WORKS ! Reflexive just recently starting from December change their system code so the old keygen I was using could not generate any code anymore. I tried downloading all kind of crack and THIS ACTUALLY DOES WORK ! Thanks GUYS FOR THIS ! 
,vacantenigma,2007-12-14T21:23Z,"Was working for me for a few of the December games, but not on Santa's Super Friends (on 12-14)"
,djtdon,2008-01-17T20:24Z,wow this worked great for me =]
,djtdon,2008-01-20T17:51Z,"thanks to this iv got like 8 new games =] 


cheers fish (Y)"
,sd1936,2008-04-10T05:47Z,anyone know how to get something like this for MAC?
,pornici,2008-04-17T17:19Z,"Great job, thanks for this it's really works"
,Snuffy63,2008-05-04T18:36Z,"Fish Tycoon stopped working.  does a stutter at the screen startup advertising for big fish and game...
I assume that the crack failed after 24 hrs.?  any help??? Thanks...
Has worked great on many games.  So glad I didnt buy them, some were crap after a day or two..."
,Snuffy63,2008-05-04T19:20Z,DAmn indie shut down listgame.  I hope they rot in shit.  They write a bunch of crap games and then get all high and mighty when someone takes the games for more than 24 hrs.  I've never enjoyed their games for more than a few days at best.  They suck.  IMHO why not get hosted on the same server as piratebay?  If not just keep dl on here...  We love you Anon!  thanks for the hard work...
,Snuffy63,2008-05-04T19:56Z,"ok. update... use http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/4012780/Fish.Tycoon.Crack.4012780.TPB.torrent for the fish tycoon old version, then use this patch to get full version.  The new version has been updated to block the crack  (for now.  U go Anon.)"
,patty157,2008-05-29T16:08Z,i cant get mine to work can some1 help my code is EAWK-QCCV-5BE4-JVXN-N61
,Lovalin,2008-07-08T05:18Z,The only problem is with games that are supplied as demos with Reflexive's time limit. The only game I have found that this doesn't really work with is Evil Invasion.
,HellRace,2008-10-03T14:14Z,"Doesn't work at Risk II :(
But other games works fine, strongly recommended torrent!"
,edetech,2008-11-10T06:26Z,"I can't get it to work on Skip-Bo Castaway Caper, but so far that's the only one does anyone have a patch for this game?"
,Petar30,2008-12-16T19:58Z,"hey people,i want to post reflexorator 2 to download,but piratebay says ""that is not a  torrent file""?"
,saitoshinya,2008-12-30T14:10Z,does anyone know where/if new patch is for reflexorator??? Most games made more recent can no longer be patched. ^^
,RavenX1957,2009-01-09T08:08Z,"Hi
  Can you create a new reflexorator for the new games please."
,auroraborelis,2009-01-18T11:41Z,I have been using it for about 6 months and now it no longer patches any of Reflexive Arcades games. Worked great for 6 months though.  I was really happy with it.  Thanks fish1976.
