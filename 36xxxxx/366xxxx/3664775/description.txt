PLOT...........: OLD JOY is the story of two old friends,
Kurt (Will Oldham) and Mark (Daniel London), who reunite
for a weekend camping trip in the Cascade mountain range
east of Portland, Oregon. OLD JOY is a minimalist story of
friendship, loss and alienation in the Bush era. For Mark,
the weekend outing offers a respite from the pressure of his
imminent fatherhood; for Kurt, it is part of a long series of
carefree adventures. As the hours progress and the landscape
evolves, the twin seekers move through a range of subtle
emotions, enacting a pilgrimage of mutual confusion, sudden
insight, and recurring intimations of spiritual battle. When
they arrive at their final destination, a hot spring in an
old growth forest, they must either confront the divergent
paths they have taken, or somehow transcend their growing
tensions in an act of forgiveness and mourning.
