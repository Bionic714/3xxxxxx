Overview:	Forget what you think you know about over the top Hong Kong action films, you ain't seen nothing yet. If you loved Chinese Super Ninja but thought it moved a little slow, or you liked Story Of Ricky but there wasn't enough action, the Ninja The Final Duel is for you. Packed with intense and bloody fight scenes, whirling ninja swords, Shaolin kung fu, flying assassins, and enough outrageous ninja weapons to make even a shogun jealous, this film sets the new standard for outrageous action. After the failure to destroy the Shaolin Temple, hand-picked fighters are gathered together for a massacre of great honor. Nothing less than the destruction of Shaolin is at stake as Japanese ninjas prepare for the final duel with the Shaolin monks.
