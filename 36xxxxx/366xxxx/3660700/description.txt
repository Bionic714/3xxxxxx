Greenhouse gases have hit a new record in the atmosphere and the 
build-up is accelerating, apparently because of industrial growth 
in Asia, . China is opening coal-fired power plants at the rate of 
almost one a week. "Levels are at a new high," said Kim Holmen, 
research director of the Norwegian Polar Institute which oversees 
the Zeppelin measuring station on the Arctic archipelago of 
Svalbard about 1,200 km (750 miles) from the North Pole.

Concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas emitted 
largely by burning fossil fuels in power plants, factories and cars, 
had risen to 390 parts per million (ppm) from 388 a year ago. 400 
parts per million is considered the critical threshhold beyond which 
warming effects may be beyond the point of no return. At the present 
rate of increase, we will reach the critical level in five years.

Meanwhile, on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at an 
all time high. There is actually a relationship between the CO2 
numbers and the Dow Jones. Governments are maintaining the Dow Jones 
numbers which reflect a toxic brew of overproduction and excessive 
consumption - all fueled by the burning of hydrocarbons, at the 
expense of focussing on the CO2 numbers and the capacity of the 
planet to sustain our sort of life form.
