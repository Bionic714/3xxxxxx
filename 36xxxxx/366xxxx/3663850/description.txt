The Best Damn Thing is the third album by pop rock
singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne and is currently scheduled
to be released in April, 2007. The album is said to be
less mellow than previous Lavigne albums, and more upbeat.
Lavigne described the record as: \"fast, fun, young,
bratty, aggressive, confident, cocky in a playful
way...all the good stuff.\"[cite this quote]

On February 18, 2007, AOL posted previews of three songs
on the album: \"Everything Back but You\", \"I Can Do
Better\", and \"When You\'re Gone\".

The album will bear the Parental Advisory label because of
instances of profanity; for example, the term
\"motherfucking\" is used in the track \"Girlfriend\". It will
be Lavigne\'s first album in the U.S. to bear the label; in
some markets the label was used on her second album, Under
My Skin (2004).[1]

On March 21, 2007, the album became available for
pre-order on the Irish and United Kingdom iTunes Stores
with release dates of April 13 and April 16, respectively.

On March 8, 2007, \"Girlfriend\" debuted at number one on
the Swedish Singles Chart Hitlistan on downloads alone.

\"Alone\" was made available for download on the iTunes
Store in New Zealand and Australia on March 29.

On April 1, 2007, \"Girlfriend\" went to number two on the
UK Singles Chart on downloads alone, rising twenty-one
places from the last time it appeared in the UK Top 75.
This is her highest chart position in the UK so far, even
ahead of her first single, \"Complicated\" (number three).

On April 5, 2007, The album was leaked onto the internet
in its entirety and was made available to download on many
file sharing sites.

According to MTV Asia, The Best Damn Thing is the fourth
most anticipated album of 2007, behind Linkin Park\'s
Minutes to Midnight and Britney Spears\' next album.
