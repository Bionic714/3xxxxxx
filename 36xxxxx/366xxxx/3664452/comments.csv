,svensk_huvudverk,2007-04-17T02:07Z,"any one more then me who got problem with the Live Update???? 
Nice upload by the way!!!"
,markxing,2007-04-18T06:06Z,"@NinjaManiac1515

Since the release of Norton 360, I personally think Symantec has lowered the ""Memory Hogging"" of Norton products.  360 on my PC always uses only about 25MB of RAM.  I definitely agree Norton Internet Security Suite and Norton Antivirus slows down your computer and are complete memory hogs.  Thanks for commenting though!"
,markxing,2007-04-18T06:06Z,"O yeah,

@sven_huvudverk

Nope, no LiveUpdate problems."

,Harry Q Hammer,2008-03-14T18:16Z,"Thank you very much, markxing.

This worked perfectly for me on WinXP Pro SP2.  I got 11 years subscription and the Live Update is working fine.

This method of installation is basically the same as previous years and versions of Norton Antivirus, Firewall, Internet Security, etc.

Advice to installers:
Do the steps very slowly and carefully because if you don't get it right the first time it is very hard to make it work again.

Also, if you can't get the ""Phone Activation"" to come up even though you have tried to connect to the internet many, many  times (while your internet is disconnected, of course), the keygen prog that is already running in the background (as per the instructions) has a button that forces the Phone Activation to start.

HQH.

For those of you that are having trouble and errors - it would be easier if you would just buy the damn software, instead of wasting your time on pointless torrents like these. It doesn't cost much you know, cheap asses. Besides, don't you have to purchase the subcriptions? In any case, it's kind of fishy that there's alot of updating and registrations from a single keygen that isn't even registered as business. I don't know, I'm just speaking the obvious and making things more convenient for you. Purchase the damn software. >_>"
,.:Wormtongue:.,2008-03-20T11:57Z,"Vista Users Please Read

I have used this in many computers running vista and i have come across this unable to activate by phone problem there is a simple solution. 

1 when opening the keygen from the edge directory (Right click and open the disc and find the edge directory right there)
2 right click on the keygen and press run as administrator
3 follow the instructions supplied in the .nfo in the edge folder 

you must run it with administrator to allow the program to be able to affect norton, 

Its that simple ppl :D"

,Ziltrox,2008-12-02T10:49Z,"I just wanna start by saying: Thank you markxing, great torrent.

Adn now introducing: The Windows Vista guide to Norton 360 step-by-step!

The VERY first thing you do (and this is vital if you want your cracked version of Norton 360) is: Shut off your internet connection!

1) Download the torrent
2) Mount the torrent with Daemon Tools (or use Winrar to browse)
3) Get the ""EDGE"" folder copied to your desktop
4) Run the installer
5) Open your ""EDGE"" folder from your desktop and run the keygen (You might wanna refresh the key a few times, and remember to crank up the speakers so you can listen to a nice little tune while you install)
6) Fill in the blanks when the installer prompts you for a product key
7) Let the installer do it's thing untill it prompts you for an activation
8) Let the installer try to connect to the internet server twice
9) In the keygen you hit the ""Phone activation"" button
10) Turn your attention back to the installer and hit the next button, this will bring forth the phone activation
11) Copy the digits and letters from the grey boxes into the keygen
12) Select number of years for activation
13) Hit the big fat generate button
14) enter your newly acquiered code into the installer
15) Enjoy you fantastic new software

Don't attempt to create an account for this product
You can use the LiveUpdate feature

This guide was made 1 month after my last install so i may have made a few mistakes
If it doesn't work or you have any questions regarding the guide IM me on msn messenger: jazz_jackrabbit@sol.dk

Sorry if i made to many grammatic mistakes etc. I'm just a teen from Denmark

,glenjamindle,2009-01-11T21:49Z,Use Magic ISO or another ISO mounting software to extract the files and run it sandboxed if you're worried about if being loaded with viruses (which all keygens are).

,enok1976,2009-09-13T23:00Z,If u install nortons u have no idea about computers. Norton is the most bloated program u could ever run on a computer. put free avg on your computer you can find that at download dot com and if u have xp make sure to download windows free windows defender. vista and 7 already comes with defender. these two programs will run fabulous on your system and wont slow ur computer down. nortons will. plus these two programs will give you all the protection u need. 
,Hks1994,2009-09-19T04:56Z,"For people who got windows vista, here are your edited instructions:
1. Unrar, Burn or mount with Daemon Tools.

2. DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET! THIS IS IMPORTANT!

3. Run the installer, and run the keygen located in the EDGE dir. (Run the Keygen as administator).

4. Copy the Product Key from the keygen to the Norton Setup then press the I Agree button.

5. Complete installation and finally you will get to the activation, it's important that you are NOT connected to the Internet! Press the Next button.

6. A message box will come up telling you that you need Internet connectivity to continue, just press the OK Button, and then press the Next button.

7. You will get to a part where it's trying to connect to the Internet for online activation, after a while it will fail, this is fine, repeat this step again.

8. After attempting to do online activation two times, it will fail and open a browser window, close the browser window and press that big fat button in the keygen that says ""Click Here to Enable Phone Activation!"".

9. After Pressing that button click next, you'll see the phone activation.

10. Now copy the 36 digit Request Code into the Request Code field in the keygen, no dashes or spaces just one long 36 digit string. Select how many years you want to license the software for, and press the Generate button to get your Unlock Code.

11. Copy the generated Unlock Code to the Norton activation screen, then press the Next button.

12. Enjoy a fully unlocked copy, and naturally DO NOT register this software with Norton, you can now reconnect to the Internet."

,persianknight,2009-12-09T21:09Z,"hi guys,first let me say thx to the uploader
but i got 2 issues. lol, I'm using windows 7 and when i tried to install Norton i had two issues, if anyone could help be very appreciated.

1st when it gets to the activation page and it tried to connect to the internet and it failed twice like the info has said, after words i pressed the big black button in keygen for the magic phone activation button to show  but it never did so i tryed pressing next on norton and it keeps going to internet page. i also never go the unlock codes .

2nd issue is I uninstalled norton and tryed again but this time i dosnt ask me for a cd key it just goes straight to installing folder. i did uninstall fully and also removed the folder in regedit. 

thx in advance"

,aznplayer28,2010-03-03T03:04Z,"I have Windows 7 and when Norton gets to step ""7. You will get to a part where it's trying to connect to the Internet for online activation, after a while it will fail, this is fine, repeat this step again."" Norton takes a long time to try to fail and when it is trying to fail Norton freezes up and stops responding."
