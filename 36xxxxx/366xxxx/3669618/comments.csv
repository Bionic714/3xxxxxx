,blindchicken,2007-06-02T10:33Z,"Is he seeding again? In the overview it shows 1 seeder but in utorrent peers only...
@arrrh: do you KNOW he'll seed again or are you just hoping?"
,arrrh,2007-06-04T04:45Z,"my comment was in reply to the person who posted above me guess i should of quoted him but .when I wrote ""he will"" it was in connection to
""There are 50 of us here on the waiting list.
Do not leave all 50 of us in the darkness""

this guy has waisted my time your time and everyones time and if you have a isp that gives you a limmited ammount of bandwith and anything above that cost you money then he's cost you money also.

do i think he will seed again... NO but I keep hopeing"
,blindchicken,2007-06-04T08:56Z,">do i think he will seed again... NO but I keep hopeing

so do I. 
Is's really a shame but OK that's the point when looking for ""free"" software - is it not?
Maybe he's an employeeof FSGlobal..."
,eNuffSaid,2007-06-19T18:22Z,"Look no further. I managed to find this on another torrent site and it has plenty seeders! Only bad news is you can't continue this download as the files for download are rar'ed 

Works like a charm.

,Blockkey,2007-06-20T10:34Z,"You ain't have to upload it, just give a link to the torrent site, where I can download it from!"
