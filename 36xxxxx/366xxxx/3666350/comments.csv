,T0nT0n,2007-04-19T13:19Z,"Actually, do not be surprised JoakimLj if you are forced to download a side-loaded version of DX9 to run many things.

DX10 currently has issues showing as backwards compatible to a lot of games."

,AR5T7,2008-08-27T12:26Z,"i have vista and dx10, but it isnt worth at all to buy vista for it, maybe a few years ago, becuz dx10 is just a bit nicer than dx9.. i got 8800gtx x2 -.- "
,alienMOAC,2008-12-04T21:22Z,so for all of you bashing XP or Vista: why not get both? is it really that hard? operating systems are like 8 gigs. partition your drive and voila! so you just start up your pc in a different version of microsoft each time. big deal. i used to do that all the time. no i got it so i don't have to. my little secret. ;)
,Solpk,2008-12-27T20:34Z,"Didn't work for me (Pentium 4 HT 3ghz, 2 gb ram, 6800xtreme). Again black screen and binkw32.dll error.
