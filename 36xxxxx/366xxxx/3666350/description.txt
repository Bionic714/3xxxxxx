Well guys I have put this in the game section because this version is vital for the playing of most of my new games.

I lie not, I would be a rich man as of now have I recieve a penny for everytime I recieve a PM concerning a dx9 error and my comment sections across the web are filled with them.

SOME GAMING ADVICE you ALL SHOULD KNOW.

I f upon launch of any game, not just mine, you recieve an error stating a missing file which happens to have an x in the name and extension .dll
100% of the time this is a DX9 file not contained in the game but in your windows/system32 floder. Most of the errors will say, 're-installing this application may fix the problem" WELL they mean re-installing DIRECTX 9. NOT THE GAME.

Also, some games will not show you a missing file error, but just seem to do nothing. THIS TOO is a DX9 error 99% of the time.
You must always keep this up to date and I RECOMMEND re-installing DX9 every so often depending upon your use of it. THESE FILES can often get corrupted, overwritten, or mispalced easily.

Please read this carefully.
Install, and game.

cheers.

And if your saying to yourself 'why torrent this when we can get elsewhere?'

It means you already understand and dont need this torrent. MANY DO!
trust me.


happy gaming
