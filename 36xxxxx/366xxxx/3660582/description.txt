This is the cd Directory from the installation cd that came with my asus EN6200TC512 Graphics card it includes the following......

. Game Live Show :- This program allows you to broad cast your game play to the inter     net live as your playing. It also allows you to record game play in to mpeg-2 so it can be watched on most pc video players.

. Game Face messenger :- Easy IM and live game conference in any pc game.

. Video security online :- Allows you to keep an eye on your home at all times and receive warnings when unusual things happen. I think a web came might be needed. 

It also includes Direct X 9.0c and additional drivers for web cams and game pads.
