,president_Bob,2007-06-19T20:53Z,err. as i was going to say* anything that you know of that i should REALLY try and add in? :P
,purplepants35,2007-06-19T22:28Z,Thanks for this
,killmonkeys,2007-06-20T03:34Z,how did you rip the broken movie into an avi file? i can't figure out how to watch the damn thing. thanks for this torrent!
,runkill.com,2007-07-12T04:49Z,"president_Bob: I dont care but its not me you should be asking. NIN also uploads torrents to this site themselves. 

kill_monkeys: Acutally the link i posted is not as good as i thought it was. I reencoded it but havent had the chance to upload it yet, http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2005/12/26/how-to-rip-a-dvd-a-tutorial/ is a really good guide, its slow but great quality"
,runkill.com,2007-07-12T04:50Z,To play the original iso you will need alcohol 120 or daemon tools to mount the dvd image
,runkill.com,2007-07-12T04:51Z,"i dont know what you should add though, maybe find some interviews with trent and the band"

,PdotDiscoCreep,2012-07-18T05:35Z,"Hey, thank you for this upload, and please everyone support Trent's work by buying his stuff as well. I mean we know he is cool with torrents of his own stuff to a degree, at least apparently with never released items. And I'm not preaching to the choir, so to speak, but it's easy to see that if we never buy his CDs and DVDs, well he won't release new material. I know this falls on deaf ears for those who are apathetic.

One quick question about this torrent, are all of these videos uncut and uncensored? While I appreciate the upload, I personally have a gigantic, vehement distaste for censored and edited music videos, of any kind. To me there is nothing worse than tarnishing an artists original vision and intention, by having it edited or censored in any way, shape, or form. Vevo is notorious for pissing all over videos, and most YouTube videos are sadly edited. So I'm just wondering did you collect these from different places on the Web, or are they direct from DVD rips? Even though I appreciate this torrent, if they are censored I'll just continue my quest to find them all in their original form, thanks.

Pdot"
