,deke1111,2007-04-21T20:34Z,"I don't know why some people think that it's funny to post a torrent, seed it until it's almost finished, then stop, because it isn't funny. In fact, I think I'll just delete the damn thing right now...there. No more torrents from you."

,k.t.t.,2007-04-27T14:50Z,Hey man! Check your upload rate or something like that. For now it might be at 0 kb at all. May be you've just disabled an ability to download pieces from your machine((

,TheWalkingDead,2009-06-18T21:35Z,"I just created a way bigger Linkin Park discography torrent. It's on 2,8 GB!!!! Not kidding... the only thing I think is missing on that one is Splitting The DNA (because most of them are Grey Daze and HT EP that are included in the torrent already) as well as Live at SoHo (iTunes Exclusive) EP. The last one is bought on iTunes and is protected. Don't think it'll work on other computers.
