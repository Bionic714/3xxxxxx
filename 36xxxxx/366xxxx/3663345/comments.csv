,lol1444,2008-07-06T14:26Z,"Dopeman, can you upload a savegame for this game?
Cause we can't just DL savegame if we don't have the folder to put it in (cause the game doesn't need installation)

And btw a tip for everyone, who has crappy graphics:
Open SBRC folder, then open config file and change MultisampleQuality to 1.The graphics will be waay better.
You can change HDRQuality to 1 too, if you want. 
I don't see diff, but i guess it enables HDR."

1; Yz must be extracted(with WinRAR for example)
2 if it asks for a serial, enter one."
,praveenbh,2010-09-16T23:08Z,just use 7zip software morons to extract and play.works fine.
,Ascorta,2011-09-13T20:21Z,DOES NOT WORK FOR ME
,potprinc3,2012-07-06T11:09Z,Its a fantastic game and works just fine. Use 7z To unzip the file SBRC.7z. Then extract the file Super-Bikes Riding Challenge.7z   Go inside the extracted folder and click on SBike.exe and play. Do not bother with starter .exe and installation.
