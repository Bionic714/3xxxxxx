John Huston - The Man Who Would Be King (1975 Masonic Whistleblowing Movie)

A grandly entertaining, old-fashioned adventure based on the Rudyard Kipling short story, The Man Who Would Be King is the kind of rousing epic about which people said, even in 1975, "Wow! They don't make 'em like that anymore!" When director John Huston (The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen) first started trying to make the film, with Gable and Bogart, the project was derailed by the latter's death. It was a few decades before Huston was able to finally realize his dream movie--and with an unimprovable cast. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are, respectively, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, a pair of lovably roguish British soldiers who set out to make their fortunes by conning the priests of remote Kafiristan into making them kings. It's a rollicking tale, an epic satire of imperialism, and the good-natured repartee shared by Caine and Connery is pure gold. In today's screen adventures, humor is usually imposed on the material by a writer or director trying to make some kind of cleverly self-aware comment ("Hey, we know it's a movie!"), but that sort of jokiness can create so much ironic distance that it pushes the audience right out of the picture. Huston lets the humor emerge naturally from the characters, for whom we wind up caring more deeply than we ever expected. The digital video disc includes a wonderful documentary on the making of the film. --Jim Emerson

Review
The Man Who Would Be King is writer-director John Huston's enjoyably tongue-in-cheek paean to action-adventure movies of the Douglas Fairbanks variety. For the most part, it's good, old-fashioned fun, but it's also an incisive commentary on English imperialism and the quest for imaginary power. Huston first attempted to make Man in the mid-1950s, with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart as the leads; over the years, other pairs were considered, including Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, and Robert Redford and Paul Newman. But it's hard to imagine anyone more appropriate than Michael Caine and Sean Connery for the slyly goofy roles. Both actors had previously played archetypically cool British action heroes: Caine as Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File and other films; Connery as James Bond. ~ Brendon Hanley, All Movie Guide
