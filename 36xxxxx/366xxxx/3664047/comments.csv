,RichiTheKiller,2009-01-12T16:45Z,"""hmm.. Just one thing - Where's ""Satch Boogie""? It's a crime to call a Satch collection ""best of"" if his best piece isn't even included. Otherwise, thumbs up""

i just listened satch boogie, n phuck no it aint the no 1 satriani tune...it kinda sucked ass
the only tune im looking for is ""surfing with the alien"" and its on here...tnx "
