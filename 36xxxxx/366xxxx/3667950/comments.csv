,vinylking,2007-04-19T16:29Z,It would be nice if someone appreciate my upload...
,affekopp,2007-04-20T09:04Z,CD 4 was downloaded more than 1200 times. This alone shows how many people enjoy your uploads. Highly appreciated. Thanks again and have a nice weekend.

But thank U anyway:-)
Love those flac files"
,affekopp,2007-04-24T12:50Z,"Hm, so many seeders but I can't connect to any of them. Download is VERY slow. Haven't had this problem with the first 4 CDs. They loaded fast as hell."
,vinylking,2007-04-26T06:39Z,Please continue seeding when it's downloaded! I'lll be starting seeding again for a while!
,Earcandy,2007-12-08T00:11Z,Thanks for the 5 cd set. Got them all ok and will seed them as I do with ALL the torrents I download. Hopefully the seeders will stick around so I can get the remaining single albums [non box set]. Will seed them also if I can get em completed.
