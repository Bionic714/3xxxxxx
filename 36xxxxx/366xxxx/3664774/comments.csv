,kpsalidas,2008-01-22T10:43Z,In this movie Bruce Lee is a mystic agent and goes to a tournament of martial arts and find out that the commander is criminal...Very good movie by the master of martial arts Bruce Lee. For more information go to http://www.wing-chun.ws/Enter%20the%20dragon.html
,funkysoul,2009-12-01T17:15Z,"this movie explains why Bruce Lee is still the best martial artist the world has ever seen. the martial arts choreography is mindblowing. the opening scene (Lee & Samo Hung) fight in a shaolin temple is my favourite along with Lee's fight with Bob Wall.

wish Bruce Lee had lived long to see the success of Enter The Dragon. he passed away weeks before the film got released :("
