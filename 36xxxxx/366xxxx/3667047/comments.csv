,The Aceman,2007-04-19T06:23Z,"Yeah, there's quite a bit of house too, I figured Techno & EDM would kind of cover it all, this has a little bit of everything."

,phobos258,2007-05-18T15:47Z,"I should delete the whole thing purely on its poor file naming. that and yea, most of it is benassi. ""Ultimate""??? not even close. dont bother. better torrents out there if you need a dance party in a torrent"

,minimaxa,2007-05-28T04:28Z,"man this has got to be the largest collection of glow stick trance cheese on a torrent, and how many weak benny benassi remixes of satisfaction do you have? sorry the track was not that great and to have this many remixes is sad. only dl if you like cheese....."
,Rabiah596,2007-05-31T08:33Z,"Says its gonna tak a day to download it all its been 12 hours since i started this and it's only at 20% and still says a day to download....Unless you can jump the download speed up this shit will never get done

On average my download speed is about 100 kb/s but with this it dropped to 10b/s at 13% and stayed there for a good 30 mins."

,Pink Lady 77,2007-06-14T23:23Z,"What´s happing? Can´t download this!!! Please help!
says trouble accessing the file!! No such file or directory"
,ka_sick,2007-06-25T19:40Z,"omg. This is one of the worst compilation ive ever downloaded. There are 30 Remixes of Satisfaction. The Quality of the songs  varys from 128 to 423kbps. 
Most of the Songs are either by Bennais Bros. DJ Tiesto. VNV Nation.

You are better of Downloading something else, for example just Bennasi CDs. Better QUality and u know what u get. Not always the same song for 30 times.

Second thing. Everything at one. Dance/Trance/Techno etc. Would be nice to sort the a littlebit.

In all. There are hundreds of better torrents with the same Songs but in much better quality an sorted at all. So before dling 3GBs, look which songs u like and either Download whole CDs or just dl the songs u like through other better Music p2p software.

1/5"
,marker_m,2007-07-06T18:57Z,thanks
,DaleCJay,2007-08-25T12:40Z,"Firstly thankyou for your time uploading this!
If you are thinking about downloading this i would say yes, you will delete most of it as its garbage, i recommend to help the job along (save hours of time consuming searching like i did!) deleting all and every benni badassi or what ever hes called, they all sound the same and he is crap and also any tracks by freeze pop they are completly shite! So you have now deleted about 35% of the album and saved yourself hours of time you will never get back!
the rest is up to you....
god bless. "

,HellRace,2008-11-14T16:26Z,"The problem is that this torrent is labeled wrong.
Nothing here is Techno... Just Euro Trance - which most techno lovers hate.

Anyway, that's what I've seen :P
but otherwise these are great songs. So stob bithing around everyone! Sorry for the hard words, but you gotta live with it you whiners!

I also agree that the NFO could've been better. 
But that doesn't mean that the music is bad, right?
Yea, thought so. 
Enjoy this torrent if you rly like Euro Trance Music! ;)

Thanks for the upload Aceman!"
