What this means is that they tweaked the EQ and added a short but loud reverb that creates a brassy ring when Jay-Z speaks (I hesitate to say ""sings"") certain tones.

If you have a shitty pair of ""hollow sounding"" speakers that are missing their middle and upper-mid range tones, download this torrent. Otherwise leave it alone, it sucks.

Where did bannedmusic dot org go? :C"
