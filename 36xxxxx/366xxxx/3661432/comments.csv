,JK76,2007-04-11T23:11Z,Oh man! I could almost taste the blood and grit in the dvd-version... You may want to brush your teeth after a HD-session.
,Deihmos,2007-04-16T05:05Z,Can't believe people actually waste their time putting these up. No one wants to download 16 gigs just for a movie.

Any ideas? "
,oswald1234,2007-04-21T09:44Z,"Whats bills media player? A piece of shit? Get ALL players, maybe you have a  hope in hell.Maybe you get nothin,JK76 you get this? join it and watch it? Brush your yellow teeth and tell us if it works,otherwise drool  somewhere else."
,hansolos,2007-04-24T21:25Z,this doesn't work don't dl
,adam7,2007-05-09T12:01Z,bill's player = the vole's last player v.10
,hurrafor,2007-05-26T17:32Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
,the_switcher,2008-05-06T18:10Z,"Hi Guys

I downloaded like 93% in about 8 hours, and then BOOM for the last two days I've just been sitting on 93.1%, occasionally getting the odd 0.01Kbps for a download that last for about 20 seconds.

Was hoping someone could seed a little longer or if I've got much chance of ever finishing it. I promise as soon as I get it I'll leave it up for download for at least a good few months.

Thanks

,the_switcher,2008-05-24T17:49Z,"Been 18 days since i last posted and I've made it too 97.2%.... I want this film badly.
