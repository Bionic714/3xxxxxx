,efelohimself,2007-04-19T07:37Z,"could anyone please explain to me, how to connect the 27 parts into one movie? and why it is split up like that in the first place and not made into an .avi?
thx :)"
,n@rcissist,2007-04-19T07:42Z,Thanks brother
,marcus_ivo,2007-04-19T07:44Z,"There's arguments both for and against dividing a release like this into several rar files.  Apparently it doesn't lend any real advantages but it isn't really all that inconvenient.  You simply use a program called WinRAR, which is free to use.

Thanks for the upload!"
,Energy5075,2007-04-19T07:45Z,thanks for this one catchupp!!

,umbrabellator,2007-04-20T00:19Z,"Downloaded: 166 times

How come 1333 are seeding this when its only got 166 downloads?"
,Smyth1,2007-04-20T00:55Z,"stop wining about speeds, 70kb/s isint bad, and it says downloaded less than seeders because this isint the only site that the torrent is on, its on many. Its basically how many seeders from the tracker."
,eKi100,2007-04-21T14:10Z,"WARNING!! THIS IS BULLSHIT!!

I myself thinked i dont care about those comments that says this is including trojan etc, just putted it into dl & after finished, scanned with avg antivirus, says its clean.. 

Then i unpacked it into movies folder, thats when probs started! Every time i open that movies folder, windows explorer crashed, before had time to do anything! 

I had to use ms-dos promt to get into that movies folder & inside it lost folder, from there i deleted this episode of lost wich just downloaded, & all works fine again! 
Downloaded & tryed it again in different folder, & same thing!! SO THIS IS BULLSHIT!! som of ya might get it working for while etc, but im sure u get much probs at later time if not right at beginning!

So, i STRONGLY recommend u completely remove this torrent.. Or use it completedly at ur own risk, u have been warned though..!"

,Rastapopolus,2007-04-22T03:37Z,"eKi100:

Your explorer might crash if you have ""Show Previews"" on or whatever it's called instead of icons/list..."
,eKi100,2007-04-22T13:36Z,"Rastapopoulos:
Yeh it might, but the thing is i havent got those ""preview icons"" on ;) I tryed everything & doesnt work.. So, dl at ur own risk & ull see probs later at least i bet ;)"
,eKi100,2007-04-24T00:15Z,"LOL mod..

Its not trying to create any F****ng thumbnails, just someone asked if thats causing it & i already aswered thats not the reason..
& crappy explorer, u got same one if ya got winxp!

If theres something crappy, its this ;) Cos all other vids i dl works fine, every single lost episode before this worked & still working fine.. Its just this file.."
,eKi100,2007-04-24T00:23Z,"Now i did unregister those dll's.. 
If u mod are happy, ill give this one more change, gonna dl this 4th time now.. 

But if it does same thing, something is gonna happen.. Think urself, if theres so many peeps whining about it, could there maybe be something behind it? 
Dont mean virus etc, cos i know most noobs begin to whine about viruses/trojans if they see something weird, like explorer crashing & error report..
But may i wonder, how in hell they (Dll's) would cause probs with just this video file?? everything else works JUST FINE the way my pc is now.. I installed all codecs again etc & same shit continues.. SO ANNOYING!

Ill post here again if it doesnt work.. if it does, it must be a f****ng miracle & then i will thank u mod :)"
,eKi100,2007-04-24T00:39Z,"Mod:

Ok, i downloaded it 4th time now after unregistering those dll's u said.. And 1 thing changed.. 
Dont get jumping & yelling yee, not just yet.. 

Now windows explorer didnt crash, but Bsplayer gaved same error report as it did before.. So what changed, was that explorer dont crash, but bsplayer will still do, & it doesnt work..!! Reinstalling bsplayer wont help a thing, either doesnt reinstalling codecs etc..

& now i cannot thank u for help yet, cos u actually didnt solved anything by that dll tip..
So i might aswell register those dll's back, at least everything else works then just fine like it used to..

So, W T F ! ! !"
,eKi100,2007-04-24T01:12Z,"Ok, so retarded those ""unregister dll's"", if ya mind me saying.. 
reason: Now got more probs cos did that what u said!! 
example: when im in folder, for example Downloads, if i dl something, the icon of file doesnt change at all, just shows ""not finished bitcomet file"", even if its 100% finished, bitcomet runned antivirus checking & all that if i look into bitcomet for status of file.. 
So now i have to open bitcomet everytime, those icons used to change to look like rar, if file im downloading is rar, & so on.. 
Only probs by uninstalling those dll's, nothing good..."
,damek25,2007-04-24T10:36Z,"Well I don't get same problems as eKi100 does (he must have really fucked up win, it's always m$ fault) but the sound is not decoded, although wmp downloads the codec (as it says). Any ideas what should I install to make it working?"
,eKi100,2007-04-24T17:23Z,"Yeh i did register those dll's back, im not so retarded ;) & now files shows in real time, if dl completes, it changes icon to rar etc.. got newest bsplayer now too, it crashes also.. :(

& my system if working just fine with EVERYTHING else.. dont really want to install xp again just cos 1 lost episode... ;) Too much trouble.. 

& what ive learned, utorrent is much more worse than bitcomet ;) With all my dl's bitcomet is kicking ass & never had probs with it :) heard more complainments of utorrent than good things.. 
I think i just gotta pass this episode & dl it again when sometime i have time & energy to install xp & all other stuff again.. already saw that episode online, but gotta dl it sometime cos have all other lost's on disk too.. ty for ur will to trying to help though :)"
,eKi100,2007-04-24T17:25Z,"damek25:
My win is working just fine, just this 1 file has probs.. it might be my win, might not..
But there u are right, Microsoft bullshit always has probs :) BS = bullshit, would be better name than MS=microsoft :)"
,eKi100,2007-04-26T16:36Z,"Ok, now ive got confirmation to it, its not my pc that is fucked up, its this file !!!

Downloaded lost episode 18, caph release, & works just fine, just like all previous ones do too.. 
Only this 1 goddamn file doesnt work & im not only whos having probs with this.. So wtf, where are all other releases?? Only this goddamn sorny/edited-from-sorny shit everywhere..
U cant open this with any players, all crashes & gives error report, in worst case winexplorer crashes if u even go to folder where this file is located.. No matter what u do it doesnt work..

Plz if someone has different release of this episode, NOT THIS SORNY/MADE FROM IT, plz upload it..

This file is the only one ever had probs with, so there isnt all alright with this.. & im not the only one thinking it.. :)"
,maxie2007,2007-04-30T09:55Z,"eKi100, I had the same prob with this file...but there is a quick fix...search for the file 'mpeg2dmx.ax' and rename 'mpeg2dmx.ax.bak'

Hope this works for u.
Cheers"
,eKi100,2007-05-01T21:35Z,"Maxie2007:

Thank You m8, lots of thanks!
I gave it one more try & dl'ed it, renamed that file, & now it works.. 
Got collection complete again, thnx to u :) 
I never would have quessed to do that, where u get idea how to fix it?"
,maxie2007,2007-05-02T12:41Z,"eKi100...ur welcome.
GSpot didn't work for me so I dl'ed AVIcodec... when scaning the Lost file using AVIcodec an error message re 'mpeg2dmx.ax' came up...didn't have a clue what this was so I googled it...to cut a long story short I basically followed what other ppl did and added '.bak' to the end of it or u could have used '.old'

Glad it worked 4 u"
