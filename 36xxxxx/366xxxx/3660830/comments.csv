Thank U topmonster it comes!

,Hades_rules,2007-10-01T10:31Z,"S'il vous plaits mes concitoyens, seed s'il vous plait, parce que je veux cette torrent aussi. Il faut le seed, encore le seed et toujour le seed :-) "
,umamylove,2007-10-01T21:03Z,"mais il se seed it self! c'est fou, je ne comprend pas comment citoyen hades but till yesterday il est toujours a 0 seed et j'ai quand même get 51% of it! so what???"
,Hades_rules,2007-10-02T08:49Z,"No, that's because I am seeding (leeching) you. I am stuck at 85% and so you can leech from that until you've reached that percentage as well. We still need somebody who seeds the entire movie, or we will be stuck at the highest rate of the leechers (which is probably me with 85%). Comprendez-vous?  "
