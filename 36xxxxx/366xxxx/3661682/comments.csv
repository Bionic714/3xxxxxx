,skowfritt,2007-04-14T20:18Z,Terrific version of xp and well worth the DL.
,skowfritt,2007-04-15T22:11Z,very fast and responsive and still so after programs are installed.
,skowfritt,2007-04-15T22:14Z,and not just the programs I chose upon install but my own programs as well which I intalled later which are quite a few.
,vipdishx,2007-04-16T17:02Z,I'm on a sony laptop and did clean install.  Everything looks awesome and is very quick.  But I am having problem with almost every driver.  Can't get on the net yet either.  When I try to install the VAIO drivers I got from the net it says the software doesn't match the model of the computer.  Anybody know what I'm doing wrong ?

,Bardal,2007-04-21T02:13Z,"Might be just my comp.
But I installed this on a HP Pavilion Laptop,
and my Windows Installer is corrupt.
Also, its in Arabic.
If you are a scandinavian. æøå wont show at all,
and on some installations it will be in arabic.
I give this one 1\10 (wasted like 7hrs on this with install) :\"
,Bardal,2007-04-21T02:34Z,"okey, I belive I managed to fix most of it.
But I had to use hours to download Windows Installer 3.1 from microsofts' site (baaaad speed).
and I had to use an original XP CD to get it to be english.
after all, 5\10 due to all of the trouble. :)"
,hatemf90,2007-09-05T21:25Z,So is it possible to change it to english?
