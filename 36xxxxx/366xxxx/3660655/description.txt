This is a collection of Ron Paul videos in a DVD iso for distribution to disenfranchised voters who are sick and tired of the way the United States Constitution has been trampled on by politicians, but may not have any way of hearing about Congressman Paul. It is also a challenge for everyone who values liberty to start their own brushfires by creating DVD images of Ron Paul content and distributing them via P2P networks! It's not terribly difficult. I used Windows Movie Maker and Roxio MyDVD and it took about 12 hours of my time. You can use CDBurnerXP Pro to burn it.

"It does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people's minds."
