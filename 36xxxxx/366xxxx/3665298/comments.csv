,einstein56,2007-04-16T14:53Z,"Thanks again to MR Fear, you're great!
So does anybody have old Dark Shadows episodes to upload? I loved that show too. If not, can anybody give me an invite to Demonoid, they have some there?
Anyway, thanks again to Mr Fear, and if I can help with other trek stuff, let me know."

As the TNG is coming to an end, maybe it's time to ask if you are willing to take more credit in the community and upload Voyager next ;-) ;-)"

but won't play in vlc or nero showtime when i want to play from folder
same with S7D1
after i burn't it with nero it wont autostart, i have to press playbutton on remote"
,Haldor_D,2007-04-20T18:26Z,"I had some problems as well when trying to play these discs either from hd or burnt on disk. The solution was posted at  STNG S5D7, but i'll paste it here as well. Worked good enough for me   :)

How to fix the ""PROBLEM"":

1. Get PGCEdit (it's free)

2. Backup your VIDEO_TS folder (for paranoics!)

3. In pgcedit open DVD (File->Open DVD)

4. Click Yes To ALL questions and let it do its job (scan VOBs). After that, click Close

5. Double click on ""(JumpSS) Jump to VMGM Title menu"". A new window pops up.

6. Choose from menu ""Jump and Call->From VMGM menu->to VTSM Menu->JumpSS-VTSM""

7. Be sure both Text boxes that appear are set on ""1""

8. Close the program and when asked, save.

9. Play.

You might want to remove the backup foldet in VIDEO_TS before burning to disk though"
,Mqq,2007-05-15T15:01Z,"It would be easier if you just provide the files that were fixed. Namely the VIDEO_TS.BUP and VIDEO_TS.IFO.

Im going to upload the fixed files for the ones ive got so far. If anyone here decides to released the fixed files, make sure you make a SFV/MD5 before editing the DVD to be sure that only these two files have been changed."
