I shamefully regret I had a cracked version of this software, but I am BUYING this software because I have learnt what a brilliant man Steve Gibson (the creator) truly is (and that goes for his product too). Spinrite saves reputations and businesses, it deserves its fee and more. YOU CAN CHOOSE the right thing and purchase SpinRite here: http://www.grc.com/spinrite.htm

You can also listen to Steve Gibson's superb free security podcast here:

,Nightwalker05,2007-04-20T22:22Z,This tiny application is a mini-operating system on its own. You can boot spinrite from a floppy or CD that you make and it will run/work on any of your hard drives regardless of what filesystem they have installed. It works physically with the sectors of the drive deeply anaylising them and seeing if it can recover raw data or actually fix sectors.
,ShadowScythe,2008-06-05T16:58Z,"Little Fingers -- You are correct :D

Once you boot the image (floppy or CD), you will be given a series of screens that will walk you through the data recovery. 

SpinRite does not care about the Filesystem, drive type or OS, (if I remember correctly). All of the work its doing is at a very low level. 

E.g. if the BIOS sees it, SpinRite should see it :D."
,tylerme,2008-08-11T09:08Z,"SpinRite is a great product, and it's saved me many times. It works on just about everything (even flash drives, though the creator does not recommend that because of limited write cycles to flash drives). I have nothing but respect for the author, Steve Gibson, as he wrote this entire program in assembler and managed to get it down to less than 2MiB!

If this program works for you, I urge you to actually buy it. I have no personal relation to the creator, I listen to his podcast, but that's about it. Still, the fact that he gives away everything but this program and his stance against DRM makes me think that this is the sort of person we should support, one who only sells enough to make a living, and gives everything else away. Also, don't be fooled by the name, this ""Corporation"" is really just three people.

As for the technical stuff: This runs on all PCs and I believe Intel Macs. USB drives, compact flash drives, etc. are all recognized. It is platform/format independent, you could use it with some strange filesystem you've written yourself. As well as recovering destroyed information, it can also run preventative maintenance.

In conclusion, if you have any problems with your hard drive (or even Windows bluescreening and the such) this will probably fix it. Torrent it, and if you like it, you really should support the author, though this is ultimately up to you."
[T],FaeGiN,2008-10-22T10:02Z,"Just had to write a comment here to recommend this amazing program to anyone considering it here!
This has saved my HDD many many times and there is no other program out there that does what it can!
Anyway great to see it being shared, nice  :)"
,drummer67,2009-01-14T23:25Z,not work moron
,DXMage,2009-06-25T16:43Z,Will it look for drives that the BIOS doesn't want to register? 
,DogNo7,2009-07-14T06:49Z,"Sod off.

Gibson doesn't know diddle about security.

Spinrite is the only product he has ever worked on that is worthwhile.

That being said, Spinrite's days of usefulness are mostly over.

Modern SCSI and IDE drives are self healing through the sector spares and the automatic relocation and detection of bad sectors by the drive itself.

By the time you see problems that are visible to the operating system, the hard drive has already done its best to repair the problems.

If you don't have a backup, that is your own sodding fault.

If you bought a poor quality hard drive, that is also your fault.

By the time you think you need Spinrite, it is already game over.

If you have a Seagate ST225 20 meg hard drive, ok, maybe this might be useful...  But then again, why are you still trying to use a 25 year old hard disk?

The program no longer has a reason to exist.

The author, insofar as security is concerned, is a complete git."

Thank you very much.

I'll repeat here the comment I posted in 
justagamer's Torrent:
""
What you all wrote in the previous comments makes sense. You are right!

This software is worth buying, IF you have the cash available...

Best regards to all

The real and ORIGINAL product is good though. REALLY good. If you're in a pinch and think the torrent is faster than buying it, just try to buy it. You will have it within minutes. Support is cool too. 
And to DogNo7, I'd really like to see you get sued for stealing and promoting stealing of this smart piece of work and to top it off, you're also kicking against the guy. 
Also, Steve wouldn't know about security? LOL, dude... can you spell CRYPTO?"
