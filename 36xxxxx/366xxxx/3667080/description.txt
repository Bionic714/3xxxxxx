VectorWorks Fundamentals (formerly VectorWorks) is a straightforward, yet professional, CAD program. But unlike ?lite? CAD programs, it goes way beyond 2D. In addition to precision drafting, you?ll find powerful tools for 3D modeling that can help you create, present and even manufacture your designs. Built-in database and worksheet capabilities help track costs and materials. A host of import/export features makes sharing files easy. You also get free object libraries, as well as a built-in scripting environment that automates routine tasks. No other CAD software offers so much for so much less.

     


 

RenderWorks seamlessly integrates into all VectorWorks solutions to provide you with sophisticated photorealistic and hand-rendered effects. Whatever your objective?realistic or artistic, you can create stunning presentation materials to help you sell your ideas.

Here?s just some of what RenderWorks 12 has to offer:

Radiosity 
New area and line lights 
Volumetric lighting 
Define lights with real-world physical lighting attributes 
Easier light aiming 
New camera object 
Texture compression 
Drag and drop texture improvements 
Quicker access to rendering modes 
 

 

Landscape design software doesn?t have to be too expensive or too difficult to use. A short learning curve, advanced 2D and 3D site design capabilities, automatic schedules and reports, a vast plant database, a suite of architectural building tools, free landscape and site object libraries, plus DXF/DWG and GIS compatibility will help you become more productive, more competitive and more profitable.
