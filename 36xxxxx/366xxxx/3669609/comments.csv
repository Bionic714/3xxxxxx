Thanks blandreth!"
,theaetetus,2011-02-18T01:55Z,"Thanks so much for this! I still have the Warp 4 installation media, but I have never been able to get OS/2 to install under VirtualBox using them. But these CDs install without a hitch, and OS/2 runs fine inside VirtualBox on Solaris.

It's nice to be able to revisit OS/2, which still has a strong user community, as it turns out. OS/2 was what turned me on to various Gnu programs."
