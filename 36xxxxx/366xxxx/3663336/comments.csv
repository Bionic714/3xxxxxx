,einremix,2007-09-09T01:54Z,"I might be overly paranoid, but I noticed while running Maple it has to connect to some server. What are the chances Maple is actually monitoring our IPs and potentially acting upon the fact that many different connections are using the same license.dat. Thanks for answering."

Download this if you you use Vista:

,downcastrelic,2007-10-31T23:33Z,"you people are crazy maple says it connects to a server but it actually doesn't. not a remote one at least if you don't belive me try running maple without a internet connection. 

As for not being able to run on vista i don't know. Maple runs on java which should give it the ability to run on any platform that has the java ide/runtime"
