,Timmah603,2008-12-28T16:33Z,"So I burned this the way I was told, AND installed it, but no matter what resolution I use, when I start a race the tires dont appear on the cars, and the road is gliched out.  What a waste of time.  Dont bother installing this game......"
,Draelren,2009-03-16T10:34Z,"Game works perfect, but the quality of game play is VERY lacking, worst racing game I think I've played since 2000."
,METACORTEX4200,2009-06-22T18:53Z,"Nice upload Subzero!

Although, why did TOED include an unselectable 23.9MB PDF? And why did he split the ISO into 2 RAR files? It's a bit inconvenient on the user's part.

The game, however, installs fine on my XP system. You can mount the *bootable* ISO through PowerISO if you don't want to burn it. The file ""Autorun.exe"" is reported by VirusTotal.com/ as being a packer but it's probably best to run it through a sandbox software (try Sandboxie).

The game is quite simple, the graphics is below average, and drifting a car is quite difficult but, what did you expect from a 149MB ISO? Still, for a hard-core Initial D fan, this game is plenty entertaining."
,Kismeture,2010-08-30T22:02Z,"Can anyone help me with this?:

So just about everything seems to be working fine, the only problem I have is, when I click ""New"" on ""Profiles"", & enter a name thingy, it doesn't save, it still shows blank, would anyone know the solution to this problem?"
