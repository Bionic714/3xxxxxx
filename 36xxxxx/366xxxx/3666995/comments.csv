,samanor,2011-02-21T07:17Z,"Im having an issue.  Everything works fantastic, although there is one weird bug.  Ive installed the patch, and ive messed with a few graphical issues in the game and in my ATI CCC options, but i cant fix it. Most textures only reach halfway down the object before turning into a blank solid tan color. This was no problem, until  i got to the water cave with the hatching spiders. At this point, i descended into the blank tan  cave, and cant see walls or anything else. i can see wooden textures, rock textures (not rock walls mind you) and stalagtites textures. Even the spiders and their eggs are visible. Anyone have a fix?"
,Phaladin,2011-03-07T09:43Z,Great game again dopeman. The game works great.

i ran it on 64 bit windows 7 and i seemed to have a LOT of problems with textures. for example when having to get to the small room to create the potion thing near the end. i could not see a thing i was standing on, it was all invisible making it near impossible to complete. well just about every time you go below the average ground level the textures become invisible.
dunno if its just me or what but it was a pain :S."
