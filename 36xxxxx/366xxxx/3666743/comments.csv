,sharpnel_man,2007-06-13T13:27Z,Would it hurt you people to seed? Stop downloading without uploading!
,onitake,2007-09-10T19:45Z,"woot another update to my sharpnel collection :3

i bought some albums, but since not all were easy to obtain, i'm glad that someone always ups the latest rips when they come out :)

thanks a lot, sharpnel_man!

i'll seed for at least a week when i'm done."
,onitake,2007-09-10T19:53Z,"btw, does anyone know where i can buy sharpnel sound apparel? aside from knowing lemmy/jea personally or flying over to tokyo?
