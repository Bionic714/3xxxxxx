,butanebobb,2008-01-25T06:29Z,"Audio seems to be slightly out of sync on this. Tried it in VLC, Winamp and Media Player."
,bleaF,2008-03-31T12:13Z,"I dont know if its Cantonese or Mandarin and its not out of sync, it's dubbed, but if you'd buy the DVD here in Sweden it says that they speak cantonese so im guessing its mandarin they speak in this version"
,mpa324,2010-06-07T20:41Z,"Yeah at first i thought It was out of sync..And then I watched a trailer to compare parts,the dialect is different.hong Kong movies are usually cantonese ,so this is Mandarin,watching a lot of chinese movies,I been able to tell them apart.mandarin,you;ll hear alot of ""sh"" words,like shi meaning yes i think"
