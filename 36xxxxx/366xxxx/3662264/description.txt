When Larry Daley, a divorced father who can't seem to keep a job for more than a week, applies for a job at the Museum of Natural History, he is assigned as a night guard. However, a seemingly easy job turns out to be a wild ride when he finds that an ancient curse has caused the "inhabitants" of the museum to come to life.
