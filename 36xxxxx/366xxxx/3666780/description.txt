Softspace
Room With A View
Musictrade release MT012
Released: April 18, 2007
Lame HVBR, including hi-res cover artwork.


Welcome again to the imaginative and intriquing soundworld of Softspace, the experimental electronica artist from Gravesend, England.

This is the third full album from Softspace, and to give an idea of these audio journeys, imagine Paris in 1890's, looked through a reflection from a cracked mirror. Soft synths mixing into cyclic sound collages built from speech samples and other found sounds, with occasional rhythmic backgrounds, forming strange but beautiful impressionistic paintings of sound - each one an adventure on its own.
