H.G. Wells - Things to Come (1936 War & Pro-Globalisation Propaganda Movie)

Things to Come is a 1936 British Science-Fiction film written by H. G. Wells and is a loose adaptation of his own 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come. The film is notable for predicting World War II and the devastation of strategic bombing on civilian populations. Christopher Frayling of the British Film Institute calls Things to Come "a landmark in cinematic design."

Things to Come opens with a near-future forecast of Christmas 1940 in the metropolis of Everytown, a city threatened by world war. Pacifist intellectuals try to turn the tide but their efforts go unheeded, and war arrives with tanks and aeroplanes and gas bombs.

The war lasts for decades, long enough for the remaining survivors to have forgotten the reasons for it in the first place. Strategic bombing is so successful that civilization on both sides are totally devastated. Humanity falls into a new dark age where the technology level is reduced to that of medieval times and a medieval-type plague sweeps through the land known as "the wandering sickness." In 1970, Everytown is run by a local warlord called Rudolf who consolidated his power over Everytown after having eradicated disease by shooting all those infected.

One day a strange craft appears and the pilot John Cabal (played by Raymond Massey) proclaims that the last surviving band of scientists have formed a society known as 'Wings Over the World', based in Basra, Iraq. This is an enlightened society that has renounced war and has outlawed independent nation-states.  Cabal promises the people a new, superior civilization "of law and sanity" but only if the people put their faith in Science rather than in the Boss and his kind.

Naturally this doesn't sit well with the Boss who takes Cabal prisoner. It is not long before mammoth flying fortresses from 'Wings Over the World' appear over Everytown, defeat the Boss's forces, and drop Peace Gas which knocks out the populace. The people of Everytown awaken to the birth of a new planned society of reason. In an impressive sequence, we witness the next 70 years pass in a montage as Mankind's immense machines rebuild the world from the ashes of ruination.

By 2036, mankind lives in gigantic underground cities and the first flight to the Moon is about to be launched from a space gun nearby. However, Luddites among the population fear this new technology, lead by a sculptor who claims mankind needs a "rest" from further technological development. They start a riot, flocking to the Space Gun with metal clubs like villagers from a Frankenstein film.  But just in time the head scientist (Cabals Grandson) launches the space ship with his daughter and the daughter's boyfriend as the crew, and the blast from the launch knocks the crowd back
