Great thing to do for ""a landmark in cinematic design.""

@sshats!"
,lilwoodenboy,2007-04-19T14:46Z,"thanks for this! much appreciated! ..but true the URL is a bit distracting ~however it seems like during encoding, it dropped frames maybe -so this is very very choppy!"

,duhprane,2007-07-11T07:32Z,"Hey Mr KNOWITALL ""KRUGE"" - you need to watch this piece of shit before you definitively declare with an authoritative voice this crap ISN'T propaganda. 

In high school in 1987, I was told that Globalization was a racist conspiracy theory, just like the newspapers said it was..... FU"
,the-chojin,2008-05-03T21:48Z,"its an anti war film like all quiet on the western front 
it shows you  how pointless war is.
war propaganda movies show war as  being on winning sides and glory in war.this film is completly difrent to that.
its just like calling battleship potemkin an anti comie movie.
and just for the record things to come has now been digitaly remasterd restored with more lost  footage which brings it closer to its original runn time of 1hr 57min  i think the new run time is 105min"
