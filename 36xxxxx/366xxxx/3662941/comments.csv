,Nallen_M,2007-04-13T09:41Z,Stanna gärna och seeda när ni är klara.
,Nallen_M,2007-04-13T11:07Z,"Den är Engelsk, Keygen finns med."
,Nallen_M,2007-04-13T11:08Z,Startar du programmet så är det väldigt självförklarande hur du skall installera det. Följ bara instruktionerna i readMe filen som dyker upp.

,Nallen_M,2007-04-13T21:51Z,"Har kört denna versionen ca 1 månad nu under Vista o funka klockrent med uppdateringar o allt.
Men vet att 2006 kom det aldrig nån vettig keygen som funka ordentligt...."

,pubis,2007-04-20T14:45Z,Thx! Works perfect! (I'm using vista) 
,kneale,2007-04-23T22:19Z,Some times with norton you have to disconnect your internet connection to get the Phone Activation Page to appear as the installation program tries to register on line with what is actually a bogus serial number and as such it is rejected
,JimboL,2007-04-28T00:47Z,This worked for me fine but on the install I always use the Vista option even if installing on XP as the other option doesnt give you the phone activation at all.  The Vista option WORKS on XP so just use that and disconnect from the internet and you will be asked for phone activation - forget the big button bollox - there isnt one
,JimboL,2007-04-28T00:49Z,This worked for me fine following the instructions that pop up when you install the product but on the install I always use the Vista option even if installing on XP as the other option (that doesnt say Vista) does NOT give you the phone activation at all.  The Vista option WORKS on XP so just use that and disconnect from the internet and you will be asked for phone activation - forget the big button bullshit on the keygen - there isnt one.  Got 4051 days working subscription and liveupdate works a treat - nice program - thanks galedo and thanks team edge
,jit2006,2007-05-04T15:15Z,"well for me its working fine on XP and Vista,so thanks Nallen_M.I don't understand all the crap peeps here on torrents who don't understand anythink about pc's so go and pay for it instade to give stupit comments.read the comment from jilbol .... so i don't need to repaet it."
,jit2006,2007-05-04T15:19Z,"well for me its working fine on XP and Vista,so thanks Nallen_M.

,Mattz0,2007-05-12T13:19Z,"jag fattar inte vad som är problemet, när jag trycker install norton internet security så startas inte installationen utan det kommer upp en ruta där det står:
Setup cannot be installed because there was a problem authenticating your Microsoft Windows Installer.

http://www.symantec.com/2007LCV1

Setup will now exit.


Någon som vet hur jag kan fixa detta? :/"
,jp_aligator,2007-06-12T23:59Z,"Gött Nallen, tack ska du ha... (^_^)"
,malc12,2008-03-13T22:30Z,"Works fine for me too! (I installed the Vista version on XP) got myself 11 years of subscription! The only slight confusion appears in the read me when they talk about pressing the big blue button in the Keygen....what they meant was choose the phone installation in the program set up dialogue, not the Keygen - the rest is straight forward. Thanks! Nice one!"
,Artur_Spider,2008-09-19T21:37Z,please give more seeds because i want to download this Norton xD
