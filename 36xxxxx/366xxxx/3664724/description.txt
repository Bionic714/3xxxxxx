Fans of the television show will probably die laughing, but some others may enjoy it also. The film focuses on Beavis and Butt-Head as they go on a cross country road trip to recover their stolen television, but unknowingly fall deep into a plot involving the theft of a man-made biological weapon. The cast of voices are a real treat, especially Robert Stack as an ATF agent. Tune in if you're in the mood for a few laughs.
