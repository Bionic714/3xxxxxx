Plot:	A woman blinds a martial arts master and his pupil vows revenge on her. She is forced to abandon her loved ones without explanation in order to protect them from her ill-intentioned pursuer.

Overview:	A blend of action, martial arts, comedy, drama, fantasy, and romance, "Saviour Of The Soul" leaves no emotional stone unturned during its 100 minutes of screen-time. Anita Mui plays two sisters--twice the Mui of any other film!--one somber and dramatic, the other farcical and accident-prone. Somber Mui blinds a martial arts master in a brawl, and his pupil (Silver Fox) vows revenge on her. Unaware of this baggage, Andy Lau falls in love with somber Mui and propses to her; but she is forced to say no and abandon him without explanation, to protect him. What ensues is basically that Andy Lau searches for and eventually finds somber Mui (with the unintentional help of her sister, the farcical Mui); and then they must battle Silver Fox several times, since he's so persistent and refuses to die. Many viewers have fallen in love with the irresistible blend of slapstick comedy, dry humor, tearful romantic drama, and awesome martial arts sequences. This film is one of a kind--or rather, one of many kinds.
