,Cultivated,2008-02-21T01:28Z,"StylishAlastor - You need the AC3Filter because it uses AC3 audio. Just google it and install it and there you go!
As far as the torrent goes - I love this season, it's just great. My favorite cartoon/anime of all time."
,Cultivated,2008-02-21T01:29Z,"And the torrent is great, works 100%."
