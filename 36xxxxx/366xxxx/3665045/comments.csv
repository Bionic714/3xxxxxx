,Dasaan,2007-04-30T08:08Z,seed please stuck at 97.8% with loads of others
,JeanHup,2007-04-30T23:13Z,"Don't worry: I'm seeding (already for 2 weeks now!) and will keep on seeding until a few have downloaded the whole torrent.
What annoys me is that there were a few leechers who made it to the 100% mark, but they obviously stop seeding when they reach 100%. This way it will take ages on my 64kb upstream connection..."

,DannyBoy734,2008-06-21T13:11Z,"Hey shskalman,
If nothing is said in the title then it will be more than likely in the original language (english if its American or Brittish.
If it's in French it will have something like VOSTFR (wich means version original sub titles French), or maybe subSwed for swedish sub titles.
Read the title...
long live the web"
,giggedyguy,2008-07-14T10:30Z,Superb acting. Too bad the GIANT THICK BLATANTLY OBVIOUS black wire tugging at the back of his jacket ruined the suspense of him jumping off the building at the end of the first episode.
,Feanie,2008-08-14T16:40Z,Thanks for this. I am enjoying it very much. You can't buy this series in Canada.
