,sinjun,2007-04-16T18:10Z,"Just checked the Fly Tampa website and it says it is for FS2004 only at the moment.  An FSX version will come after the SP1.

So use at your own risk I guess, would be curious to know if does work though"
,rikardolajos,2007-04-16T18:54Z,It doesn't work with FSX. You can see the new scenery flash through the old scenery from some angels.
