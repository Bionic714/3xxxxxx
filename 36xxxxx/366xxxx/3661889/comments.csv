could you make torrent only with

eventually with another ebooks with DSP, please.

,banfrog,2007-04-26T17:36Z,as nstn said it will be difficult to download entire 7Gb for 1 or 2 books...........could you please make a separate torrent for just all books in DSP sub folder
,banfrog,2007-04-26T17:39Z,"I just want 

Prentice-Hall - 2001 - Spoken Language Processing, A Guide to Theory, Algorithm and System Development -.pdf

It will be great if you could put this book on a separate torrent

thanks in advance
"
,CrazyTerabyte,2007-04-28T04:37Z,"I agree with the other guys. It would be A LOT better to make a torrent with all those files separated (instead of one big RAR file).

I right now would like to get the Bluetooth book, but someday I might want other books, so a torrent with all books (or all books ZIPped or RARred one-by-one, which is easy to do in one line of shell script) would be the best."
