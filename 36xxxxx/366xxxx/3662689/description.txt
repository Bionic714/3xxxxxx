The Planet attempts to find answers about the truths and untruths 
of the alarming global changes that many claim are already in motion. 
It is the most extensive documentary project ever produced in Scandinavia. 
The filmmakers have worked for more than two years on the program and 
visited over 25 countries around the world. The Planet is about much more 
than climate change, it\'s about the Earth as a whole - about the overall 
changes we are experiencing right now.
