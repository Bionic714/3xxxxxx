,deanimator,2007-06-14T23:18Z,Anyone see 37+ on the net yet?
,Abstrakt_85,2007-06-15T15:33Z,"ok, now issue 37 is out on like every other torrent site, what happened here? And yeah, I know, instead of whining i could upload it myself, but i'm sitting on a 0,3kBit/s connection.. I could E-mail issue 37 to someone with a faster connection so he/she could upload it though.. just let me know.. and it'd be nice to see issue 38 and up soon too.."

I know it's reporting as 0 seeds right now, but I'm assuming it's because the site is slow to update."
