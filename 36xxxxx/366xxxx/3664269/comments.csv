,dj_nix_poliatevska,2011-05-24T02:13Z,"to Sabine.W 

There is no Crack Folder.
When I downloaded the game
All i got was rld-csi3.
When I opened it up after
placing it in my daemon to
put the crack in. I got 2 folders
One showed Disc 1 and Disc 2
The other folder had all the information
for what I just Downloaded.
There was registration
A notepad note and 
Uninstalling the game. 
Please if you are smart at all,
tell me where the hell you saw
a ""crack"" folder in any of that?"
