,svenhaa,2007-04-20T08:43Z,Good picture quality but there is a really annoying voice over.
,alfulf,2007-04-29T12:44Z,Riktigt dåligt med polskt tal. Usch!
,mitgarand,2007-04-30T05:33Z,The polish overdubbing is horrendous.  You can still hear the german language.  It's like trying to listen to two people of different languages talking to you at the same time while you're trying to read the subtitles.
,chrisar,2007-06-02T23:27Z,Any other comments on this torrent? Worthwhile to get?
,yingjai,2007-06-09T03:15Z,good if you can stand 2 different languages speaking to you while you read the english subtitles
,hassemos,2007-06-25T18:54Z,Polsk översättning. Ööh.
,g1g,2007-07-23T15:57Z,English? - My arse!  Who the hell can watch a film with Polish commentary?
,MrFingers,2007-08-25T03:33Z,"absolutely awful.  How can you possibly expect us to watch a film in German, with a Polish commentary over the top, and English subtitles?  Is this a joke?"
,vidursingal,2007-08-26T20:45Z,"terrible. dont bother downloading. 
i could not watch the movie for more than 5 minutes.
picture quality is good but the polish dubbing kills it. "
,ratbag,2007-09-02T14:22Z,Idiot.
,noodleman,2007-09-30T15:20Z,this is awefull. a complete waste of time for a download. !
[T],MrLore,2008-01-09T21:26Z,"Don't download this and stop seeding it, unless you speak polish but still want english subtitles this will be of no use to you."
,seasores,2008-06-01T07:08Z,can u pls tell me how to make the subtitle works?? tnx
,generalfunny007,2008-07-11T17:33Z,how does the subtitle work??
,oskiewicz,2008-11-02T22:18Z,"You know, it's not that difficult to watch a movie with polish reader and original sountrack in the background. Some 30 million people do it every day... just a matter of getting used to. 
And it's better to have such film than not to have a film at all."
,kissing_hitler,2008-11-11T18:33Z,Filthy polish. 
,b4dger,2009-07-08T10:03Z,This torrent is the pits! Do yourself a favor and don't bother wasting your time downloading or seeding this garbage. 
,numediaweb,2010-02-12T22:35Z,"STOP SEEDING THIS RUBICSH!!!!
u got to be psycho to watch this upload; polisch robot speaking mixed with original German with english subz!!!"
,DIVXHacker,2010-08-27T12:58Z,"Aww, yuck! that's it! I'd rather buy the english DVD. The German language is left alone on that. There's no such thing as English dub - too much is lost in translation, as there are a lot of German idioms that don't translate well without sounding complicated.

Good movie, though. Trying to get the original German Constantin DVD with the color subtitles."
,given2flye,2010-11-10T03:01Z,"U STUPID ASSHOLE, PUT IN THE FUCKING TITLE THAT ITS DUBBED U FUCKING DICKHEAD!"
,durian555,2011-01-04T01:24Z,"BEWARE!      Look ahead!      ACHTUNG!     VORSICHT!
