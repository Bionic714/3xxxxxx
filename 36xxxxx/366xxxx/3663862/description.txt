Plot:	Hsu Shao-Chiang stars as a put-upon illegitimate son of a "Martial Arts World" master, who nearly sacrifices all to learn the "Silkworm Style"--making him a veritable "Spider-Swordsman"!

Overview:	Actor Lu Chun-ku really hit his stride as a director of mystical kung-fu epics, like Holy Flame Of The Martial World, and this -- truly one of the best of its kind. Hsu Shao-chiang stars as a put-upon illegitimate son of a "Martial Arts World" master, who nearly sacrifices all to learn the "Silkworm Style" -- making him a veritable "Spider-Swordsman"! That's just the pay-off to this eye-filling, mind-bending kung-fu phantasmagorical which elicited cries of joyous disbelief in virtually all the cinemas where it was shown. Featuring a top notch cast including "Venoms" Lo Meng, Sun Chien, and Wang Li, this extravaganza truly warrants the description: "unforgettable."

Followed by "Return Of Bastard Swordsman".
