Bro Town Season 2

These have been encoded in .mp4 format for the psp custom firmware 3.30 

I believe that this is the first time Bro\' Town episodes have been put onto the internet. So I hope you like these New Zealand cartoon episodes.

Included are:

Episode 1 - Zeelander
Brief: It\'s Morningside Fashion Week, and one of the world\'s top fashion designers discovers Jeff da Maori and catapults him to international catwalk fame.

Episode 2 - Survival of The Fattest
Brief: The class sets out on their annual day trip, but when the boys are taken out of their enviroment, strange things start to happen!

I will try and upload more of season 2 and start season 1.

Thanks,
