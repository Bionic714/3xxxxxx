,Bbrit1776,2008-09-05T22:51Z,"I sent u an email thepirateboy 
and my email address 
was moneisbw@aol.com 
and i havent go a responds
from u yet about the 
chicago hope on 
megaupload."
,Bbrit1776,2008-09-07T19:49Z,"honestly i dont know y he is giving
out his email address because
he doesnt come on the internet
and he is not a realibe source 
if he can not answer his emails.
it will probably take a year or a few
months for him to answer this website,
the megvideo messages, and his own
email messages. we might as 
well go onto some other
website and buy it off of them."
,Bbrit1776,2008-09-29T02:20Z,"thefishmaster, if your saying
that you are going to upload
the rest of the seasons, then
why does it take you months
into years to upload them
and also u dont answer ur 
emails nor ur megavideos
concerning Chicago Hope."
,thefishmaster,2008-10-29T00:32Z,its so nice to be labeled an unreliable source from someone like bbrit1776 who shares no videos at all here
,thefishmaster,2008-10-29T00:33Z,"IMPORTANT NEWS

visit www.chepisodes.tk
there i setup a site with links to every season on megaupload as i am getting too many emails(Bbrit1776 i banned ur IP btw)"
,thefishmaster,2008-10-29T00:35Z,"IMPORTANT NEWS

,VicVega,2008-11-08T14:06Z,There's only 4 episodes there. Why don't you make them all available? I want the one with Jessica Alba in it.
,Bbrit1776,2008-11-09T04:36Z,"if you are saying to email u
what havent u responded back.
So how do we know if you 
are going to upload them or not
if you are not going to answer anyone.
You could at least be senseable and say
hey i am getting so many emails
that i will not get anywhere and respond
back instead of ignoreing 
everyone and i bet that half
of us are asking someone else for
the episodes since it is taking u 
more than a month or so to upload
something."
