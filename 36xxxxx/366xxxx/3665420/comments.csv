,Yadott,2007-04-16T23:14Z,Has someone try this? Is this working or some damn joke?
,wfgovie,2007-04-17T00:42Z,"No joke my friend, Microsoft has failed to fix the leak, and we all get to benefit from it. I assure you there will be no false torrents from GoveyDesigns."
,wfgovie,2007-04-18T05:23Z,Sorry for the slight lapse in seeding... Had some serious OS problems and needed to reinstall windows. Problem fixed and seeding resumed. Stay Strong my leechers we will over come broadband and her bitch ass upload speeds!

,torsol,2007-04-21T12:36Z,"This seems ok, and the links work too!  But is this 32, 64 or 86 bit version?"
,torsol,2007-04-21T18:17Z,"I got all the files from the links, but the last one I had to try twice.  Now it's 2.3GB allright.  Try again!"
,Dragon.76,2007-04-21T22:40Z,How do I create a bootable DVD with these files?
,wfgovie,2007-04-22T16:47Z,"Making a booable cd is as easy as running the .exe and burning all the files (including the 3 in the torrent) using Nero burning rom!

And yes I told you all its legit, sorry again for the seeding problems.. Im only one man XD"
,Yadott,2007-04-22T21:48Z,"Do you mean the extracted dir VISTA + torrent files or what...be more exactly how to burn bootable DVD that really work. Nobody has too much DVD's to waste and throw in garbage. Tell how, so we understand it. Thanks!"
,Yadott,2007-04-22T21:54Z,"BTW. Has anyone get this installed, and it is working correctly, tell us?"
,thesorr,2007-04-23T07:45Z,"Also going on what Yadott said should we use a dual layer dvd disk. and should we first extract all the files so there is only the three (two wmi files and one exe file), but are we suppose to execute the X13-49120.exe file which will give us a full directory of the vista program. If we are suppose to do this how did you burn it with nero as a bootable disk or an iso or an udf or what because I have tried three different ways and still haven't had any success in making a bootable disk. So I would appreciate it if you got back to us. Thanks"
,Tendersound,2007-04-23T18:16Z,I have installed it. The activation doesn't work.
,Yadott,2007-04-23T21:16Z,"wfgovie, where are you hiding, come and tell us how to do now when nobody knows nothing!"
,Yadott,2007-04-24T11:04Z,"Tell us how did you burn it? Which files to burn on dvd? Bootable...and so on...?

Can you lead us to the working activation file?"
,Yadott,2007-04-24T11:48Z,"Here you find instructions how to burn it!

,Yadott,2007-04-26T21:51Z,"It worked for me with Orbit crack, no problems after used burning instructions above!"
,dacke_77,2007-05-06T12:05Z,"Where can I find orbits, crack that you are talking about?
