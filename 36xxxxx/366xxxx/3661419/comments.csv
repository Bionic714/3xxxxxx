And I know this might not be the place for my question, but I`ll ask it anyway.
I do not doubt the releasers skills or wisdom in this mather, I just wish to be elightened.
Why are the files released in X numbers of .rar files? the % of comprimation is minimal.
I could understand it if it was a direct download, but i thought torrents removed the need for X .rar files?

Now enlighten me please O_o"

====================================================

No! *No they're not*, you dolt.
1: Split archives provide around 0.0000000001% (i.e. no) compression on Divx/Xvid, which means it would take you longer to decompress the file than to download that fraction of a the file.  
2: Torrent files come with error detection/correction, which means the files are virtually never corrupt.
3: Divx/Xvid files dont care about corruption anyway, you'll just notice a split second of disrupted video, corrupt RAR file on the other hand screws up the entire archive and you have to download that file all over again.
4: People are less likley to seed split rar torrents, because they need to keep effectivly useless RAR files on their computer forever and a day."
