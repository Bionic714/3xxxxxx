     The Ola Kvernberg Trio was established in 2000, at that time
     it consisted of violinist Ola Kvernberg together with
     bassplayer Steinar Raknes and american guitarplayer Doug
     Raney. Since then, the trio has been through a few changes,
     the latest was adding swedish drummer Erik Nylander autumn
     2004. Ola grew up in a musical family, playing in the fiddle
     folk music tradition of his mom and granddad. Studying
     classical and folk music from age 6, he discovered jazz music
     at age 16 and has since then pursued his interest in
     improvised music. The trios reportoire today consists mainly
     of Olas compositions; a mixture of bebop, folkmusic-fiddling
     and modal jazz. Focusing on the interplay, the result is quite
     a unique sound: everything from burnin to intepretating soft
     songs.
