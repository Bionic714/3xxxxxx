,Earcandy,2007-12-10T01:56Z,I appreciate everything vinylking has uploaded and have seeded the ones i've been able to complete. I wish others would appreciate this one enough to keep it seeded. This one and a couple of the others are taking a long time to upload. I'm into my 2nd week. Is this normal?
,Earcandy,2007-12-11T01:50Z,"Finally. It took a couple weeks to complete this album along with the Bitter Tears and Ragged Flag albums, but now that I got them, I will seed them for awhile."
,OzBrickie,2007-12-29T17:48Z,"Go for it mate. There are too many badly made Cash mp3's out there.
Good Stuff"
