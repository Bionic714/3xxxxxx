I don't know why.  I only traded away vol1, not vol2.  I will upload the proper cover, back tray, and cd for vol.2 shortly.   The cover i included for vol.1 is the correct one,  not the back tray though.  the difference could be that the 14 track cds were not  USA issues.  someone else may know the answer."
