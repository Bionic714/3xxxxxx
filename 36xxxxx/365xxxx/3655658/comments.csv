Need serial or activation ?"
,dbuster,2007-04-05T15:40Z,"No serial, no activation. Just once you have installed it download the  **FREE** update from    www.wilcopub.com.   "
,zkalos,2007-04-05T19:25Z,"Shit, Not working, because the installer said:""a requested file missing"". It working just for you!"
,zkalos,2007-04-05T20:07Z,"This working somebody?

Req: Wilco/Feelthere Airbus series SP2 installer,Pleeeeees!!"
,N537JB,2007-04-05T20:30Z,"zkalos ;-)

Try to install it in MAIN FS9 dir, else it won't work."
,zkalos,2007-04-05T20:40Z,"Sorry, but truly not working"
,N537JB,2007-04-05T20:43Z,Check if you have a file called 'display.cfg' in the main dir of FS9.
,zkalos,2007-04-05T20:47Z,"Not in FS9 dir such config file, as I remember never was."
,N537JB,2007-04-05T20:48Z,"Normally there should be.

Anyways, create a new file called 'Display.CFG'(not .txt, but .cfg!) and then put it in the main flight simulator 9 dir, and try to install again! :)"
,zkalos,2007-04-05T21:32Z,"Thank You !!!! Working!
Very interesting. Why this empty Display.cfg needed this install, and why this is not in my FS9 folder. I not delete it. How from You know this trick, the installer not say, what file is missing or need. The fresh FS9 intall put this config file to the FS9 directory or creat it the FS9 installer?"
,N537JB,2007-04-05T22:01Z,"lol..

As you may be see in the setup, I'm the creator of it ;-)"

,FSFan,2007-05-06T10:58Z,"Please get the FSX version - as you said, you bought the FS2004 one. Customers who have bought the FS2004 version of this product CAN FREELY DOWNLOAD THE FSX VERSION INSTALLER.
To do so, simply login to the Download Center and select the FSX installer which is now displayed along with the FS2004 installer. (Quoted from Wilcopub)"
,NGC1672,2007-06-03T12:30Z,"Thanx! However  this version has a lot of glitches. Main shortcoming is FMC cannnot 
operate with any WPT names I try to enter. 
""Not in data base"" - a usual reaction! Is there any workaround? Maybe a better way is removing the whole panel and replacing it with one from PSS-777 ?"
,secco1985,2007-06-29T23:00Z,"Not working for me... when I select the 777 I obtain this error: ""Error: unable to find registered callback"" and then there is a CTD!"
