,dervish28,2008-06-08T20:52Z,"Thank you! A very underrated album. One of the best. 'Specially the synth solo on ""politics"" and it's intro. ""Praying"" is great as well. Every track is awesome."
,Danux01,2012-02-11T04:28Z,"  Not usually a big fan of ""electronic"" sound, but this album reaches me. I've always wanted to get it on CD, but man, it's like $275US on line.
  Thanks for encoding and upping."
