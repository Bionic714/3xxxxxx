,JetClipper,2007-04-09T07:04Z,"Hi Gays, 
you need this Service Pack for the FSX only.
See this homepage: http://www.commerciallevel.com/index.php?id=63"
,JetClipper,2007-04-09T07:09Z,"SORRY MY MISTAKE... :-(

....
Customers after 5 april 2007 do NOT need to install this service pack. 

This installer features 2 options. 

1. FSX version
This will install the DC10 patch to Flight Simulator X. 

2. FS9 version
This will install the DC10 patch to Flight Simulator 2004
