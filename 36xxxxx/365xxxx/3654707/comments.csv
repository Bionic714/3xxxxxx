,de_e_najs,2007-10-24T17:38Z,will this work???
,de_e_najs,2007-10-24T17:47Z,how do you crate these files?
,3TTT5,2007-12-04T14:34Z,"where is the key.bins file, this does not work without that file, it will says file is corrupt"
,3TTT5,2007-12-04T14:36Z,"oh yea, im using 3.52 m33-4"
,bilderberg,2008-01-24T16:13Z,"I don't know how to get it working on M33 firmwares. I use 3.30 oe-? and it doesn't need a keys.bin file, just the eboot.pbp. To play, put the eboot.pbp in msROOT/PSP/GAME/SLES####, Where is SLES####, you must put in the code Sony gave the game (can also be SLUS or something else, depending what region the game is from)"
,matstaB,2008-04-27T01:45Z,"you don't need keys.bin cuz ""AutoPopstation4"" puts it in the eboot.pbp file automaticly. works fine for me"
,matstaB,2008-04-27T01:50Z,"@bilderberg

you don't need to put it in a file with the game code just any sub-folder on it's own within the ""ms0:\PSP\GAME"" folder

it's also the same on M33"
[V],lan3y,2008-06-08T11:54Z,"i've tried putting the game in its own folder in psp/game and tried it in the iso folder but it says they're corrupt.

i got 3.90 m33-3"
