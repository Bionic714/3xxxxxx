Once you download this movie open the first .TS with VLC. Right click in the middle of the screen choose fullscreen. Then right click again in middle of screen go to audio track and choose Duestch audio track 2. It should play just fine. VLC will play most of the movies you can get off torrents. For those that don't play with VLC - Google and download the latest K-Lite Codec Pack which uses Windows media player classic. Come on guys it just takes a little research and digging to get these working right ya fuckin' half wit swabs."
