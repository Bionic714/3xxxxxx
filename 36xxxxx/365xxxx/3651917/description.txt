The Dave Brockie Experience or DBX is formed of three of the current members of heavy metal band GWAR. The band is composed of David "Oderus Urungus" Brockie (Vocals/bass), Brad "Jizmak Da Gusha" Roberts (Drums), and Mike "Balsac the Jaws of Death" Derks (Guitar). DBX is a pet project of GWAR and shows some of their earlier punk roots from the "Death Piggy" era. At their shows they play some original DBX songs as well as some tunes from Death Piggy, GWAR, and X-Cops. The band enjoys a following mostly made up of GWAR fans. Dave Brockie has hinted at the possibility of the band's breakup in the past due to the exhausting nature of lower-budget touring.

Enjoy!


PS! I couldn't find any torrents containing these albums, so I had to download all tracks one by one by using Limewire, this explains the various bitrates used in the  MP3 files. It took quite some time to get absolutely all tracks too.
