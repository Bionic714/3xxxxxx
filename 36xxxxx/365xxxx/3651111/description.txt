Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix is a remix album by Michael Jackson 
released in 1997. The tracks on the album included eight remixes of songs from 
Jackson's previous album HIStory, and five original songs ("Blood on the Dance Floor", 
"Morphine", "Superfly Sister", "Ghosts" and "Is It Scary?"). Jackson dedicated the

History: 
On April 2, 1997 the debut single from the album, "Blood on the Dance Floor", was released in Europe 
The single peaked at #1 on the UK Singles Chart. The U.S. release of the single was less popular 
peaking at #42 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #19 on the R&B chart. 
The second single from the album was "Ghosts", and included the official remix of "HIStory" as a double 
a-side track. On May 8, 1997, Jackson, in collaboration with director Stephen King, made a 40 minute 
short film titled "Ghosts". The film premiered at the 50th Cannes Film Festival. The short film was 
positively received by critics who attending the premiere screening. The short film helped propel the 
single to #5 in the UK. 
"Is It Scary?" was planned as a third single but was never officially released (as of 2006 only a few

happen in the end. It was also featured in the "Ghosts" short film.

his sister LaToya Jackson and Jack Gordon.

October 2000, world-wide, the album has sold an estimated 6 million copies  It is listed as the
