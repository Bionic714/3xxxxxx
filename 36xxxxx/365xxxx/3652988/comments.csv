,saladdin76,2008-06-09T16:32Z,"Does anyone have a Scan of WHFB 3rd Edition? 

This is incredible, the first time I cannot find something on the internet.

PLEASE, if you happen to have the 3rd Edition as PDF or even the book, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make it available."
,saladdin76,2008-06-09T16:33Z,PS: The only edition of WHFB that had ANY gaming value was the third one. From there on it went downhill.
