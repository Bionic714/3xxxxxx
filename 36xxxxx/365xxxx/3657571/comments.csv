,MASK.13,2009-03-16T03:09Z,Uhh... Works fine for me. I'm using uTorrent...
,smokeywheels,2009-03-19T21:46Z,"Not sure why, but for some reason there are duplicates of the files in ...\counting crows - flying demos-1991-ksi\

To download: 
In your torrent client software (azureus), select all of the above mentioned files and move them to a different/new folder.

You'll get an error for about half of the files, click ok for each error. 

Now go to the main torrent file and select recheck or stop it and queue it.

That should do it."
,peaches760,2009-04-12T21:46Z,"Yeah it looks like the two folders have identical files EXCEPT for:
00-counting_crows-flying_demos-1991-ksi.nfo and
00-counting_crows-flying_demos-1991-ksi.sfv so you've only have to rename/retarget those, the rest you can let overwrite each other (and it saves that little bit of disk space ;-) )."
,ErOtIcMoNkEy,2009-07-16T02:19Z,"COUNTING CROWS IS THE FU*KING GREATEST GROUP EVER!
