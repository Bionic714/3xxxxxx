Cruise Ship Tycoon (PC)


Warning- people get a little weird on the water. You won't believe what your guest are up to. If you're not a sharp-eyed old sea dog, they'll torpedo your business. Throw in some umbrella drinks, choppy seas, unruly employees and anything can happen. You could be rich and famous... or the biggest schmuck on the seven seas.

Here's your chance to build, staff, promote and command your own luxury cruise ship. Keep your guests happy, the crew in line and this floating hotel on course or you could be heading for rough waters.
