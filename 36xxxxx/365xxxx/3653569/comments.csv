,mjuad,2007-04-03T05:36Z,"No problem!  Nice piece of software innit?  I can't live without it anymore :D  Keep seeding it, this one should stay alive!"
,Mikademus,2007-04-04T00:15Z,"Sorry, crack procedure followed to the letter fails totally. It won't crack. Following the instructions, after DEVENV crashes and the original .dll is replaced, it is uncracked and dead. "
,mjuad,2007-04-05T00:35Z,"Mikademus:

Give me a step by step list of what you did...NOT what the instructions say.  Just try to remember exactly what YOU did, and I'll see if I can help you.  Also, which version of MSVC, Windows, etc?  Hope I can help!"
,Mikademus,2007-05-01T19:13Z,"mjuad:

1) I installed the version of VAssist from the torrent
2) I renamed the .dll from the folder into which VA had been installed
3) I installed the registry keys from the enclosed file
4) I copied the .dll from the torrent's crack folder into the va install folder
5) I booted vstudio and entered the name/key
6) After the crash I removed the .dll from step #4 and renamed the one from step #2 back to the original name
7) VAssist is now fully uncracked and not working

Using WXPSP2 and VStudio 2005 SP1."
,zorro9k,2007-05-04T09:00Z,"crack doesn't work for me.

after copy  crack dll and import new reg value,
It doesn't show dialog for input key.

After boot MSVC6 (+sp6)  , see some girls pic popup and directly go to msvc 6  without VA toolbar.

PS: WinXP SP2   + MSVC 6"
,lbolanos,2007-08-18T18:54Z,It works fine for me.  This is a very good addon to visual studio.  Thank you very much!
,blubberfuck,2007-09-23T22:50Z,The approach to register it works fine for me as well. VAX is a great Visual Studio add-on and works fine.
,metalmidget,2008-08-14T12:35Z,"I followed the instructions to the letter up until ""6. Start Visual Studio and enter the following serial:""
When I open up VS 2008 pro, nothing happens...

Is there something else I'm meant to do in VS like load visual assist into the IDE or something?

Using vista home premium 32 bit..."
