Huun-Huur-Tu is a group of currently four male musicians/singers from Tuva, a small country located between Russia and China, northwest of Mongolia. They have devoted themselves to learning old songs and tunes, their performances reflect the values of innovation as much as tradition. They play traditional instruments like the Igil, a two-stringed fiddle. Throat singing is a technique which allows a singer to sing two or three notes at the same time. The people of Tuvan were able to develop five different ways of producing this particular type of singing.
