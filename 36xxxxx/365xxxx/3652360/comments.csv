,subzidian,2008-02-04T16:49Z,"HERE IS INFO BY ME (I DOWNLOADED AND TESTED):
Menu: Brilliant, original. Features is missing, everything else fine.

Languages: English (perfect condition) and spanish (again perfect).

Subtitles: English, Spanish, Portugese (all in perfect time, no delay!).

Video: Crystal Clear perfect picture quality.

Problems: its been compressed to much, sometimes it skips a few seconds and the subtitles get blurred (huge problem as vital conversations are har to understand).

EVERYTHING ELSE IS PERFECT!"

Because i can't find it anywhere, please. Thanks a lot kosmo ;)."
