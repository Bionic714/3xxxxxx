This is an audio review of the different types of Puresound snare wires for snare drums, by Sterghios Moschos (drummer of Pantheist, The Lost Legion and Reign of Swords) and Martin Bell (Audiogogue Studios) sponsored by Mikedlobear.com

The following models are reviewed:

Custom
Equaliser
Blasters
Metrix
Twisted

These were tested on a 1984 Sonor Phonic Plus Hitec snare drum (14"x8.5", 9 ply beech) fitted with a dotted pinstripe Remo resonant head and a standard remo snare resonant head. No tuning changes were carried out between wire replacement and wire tension was adjusted to be equal between wires.

The recording was carried out at Audiogogue studios by Martin Bell who is also contributing to the review giving a "from the desk" opinion on sound versatility. 

All thanks to Puresound for providing review stock, Mikedolbear.com for publishing the review and Audiogogue studios for hosting the recording.
