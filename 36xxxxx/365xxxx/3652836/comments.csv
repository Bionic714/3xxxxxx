Sorry, but with no instructions other than keep the file in the directory and run it, I am a bit duped.  

When you try to run the Crack it asks for a directory within the installation directory data/data that doesn't exist.  I created the directory to try and find what file it was looking for and then it came up with a read/write error!  Joy.

WMP11 extracts files elsewhere when you run the install file so I'm assuming that you need to place the crack file within the temp directory and run it from there?  It would help so much if there were some instructions!!

Anyway, I didn't test it.  I simply told my firewall not to allow the program to access the internet and it seems to be working fine.

Thanks for the upload, but please supply instructions with your next torrent!"
