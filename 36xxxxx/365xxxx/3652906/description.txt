BitLord v2 is a complete re-build of the BitLord core. It now supports downloading through the eDonkey network in addition to the traditional BitTorrent, allowing for faster downloads by dual downloading between those two networks. This beta is missing some features from the v1.1 on the BitTorrent side, but is constantly being worked on to get us out of beta.
