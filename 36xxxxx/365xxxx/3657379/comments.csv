,ShadowCrack3r,2007-06-05T20:10Z,"Hey...its not working bro, it says first that it cant find the setup.exe that is needed, so i had to activate that seperatly.  After it was installed I went to AutoRun, tried to run the game (from the menu) and now it says OREGON.EXE cannot be opened...

any help?"
,Not_1,2007-06-07T22:10Z,Use the OREGON32-file in the folder OTWIN32 to run the game. Cheers! :)

,mrsillyx11,2009-10-24T01:34Z,"The installer wont work on Win 7 x64, says something like this 32bit installer is not completable , ask the manufacture for the 64bit installer.

But you can just run the program from the OTWIN32 directory, and it works fine."
