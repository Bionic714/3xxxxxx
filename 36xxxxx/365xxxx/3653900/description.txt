Hank William has been as influential to popular music as Shakespeare has been to poetry. From Elvis and Tommy Steele to the Carpenters and The Cowboy Junkies, literally 100's of bands and singers have recorded Hanks songs.
 If you like country music, Rockabilly, Rock n Roll or are interested in the Roots of popular music then this is an essential addition to your music collection.
