It's that good.

Anyone got links to other great heli/flight-sims from yesteryear?"
,420dopeman,2007-04-08T16:54Z,"There is a link included with this download.

Go to it, you will find over 100 of my other releases containing many combat-sims and various other releases.

cheers."

,lazlo09,2007-09-10T13:53Z,"Please HELP ME DOPEMAN! Just Downloaded this, and the ""settings-screen"" that appear when you start the game first time says that i cant use AA and that it automatically will not allow highest grapics settings. But this game is from 2004, and i have a 6800GT 256Mb GDDR @ 390/1050Mhz and Core 2 Duo E2160 @ 2,7Ghz and 2Gb DDR2 667Mhz!"
,NO_BS,2007-09-14T06:05Z,"Why are people referring to this as a simulation? It's a shitty excuse for a sim. 100% arcade BS all the way...

Novalogic sold out (their sims were never that realistic anyway) to the arcade fanbase, because real simulations just don't sell very well. Further proof that the majority of the population consists of whining morons...

The no-brained arcade shooter crowd has murdered the simulation world. Microprose used to make the most realistic, amazing simulations until people OUTSIDE of the sim community started crying that they were too complicated... Right. They are supposed to be simulations, not arcade games. Go play your own games...

Naturally, Hasbro stepped in and took over the Microprose name, and immediately catered to the arcade crowd to cash in on the majority. The sequels to the best sims ever made (M1TP2, Gunship) were released as arcade shooter/simulations to please everyone, or cancelled altogether... And they were complete failures; The faithful sim community (the very people responsible for the conception and design of such games) was outraged that they were virtually fucked in the ass, and the arcade community still whined, because their tiny brains still couldn't grasp the game. Everyone lost in the end, because of greed.

Comanche 4 was marketed under a blanket of confusion, to make the simulation crowd buy it anyway, hoping it would be more like Comanche 3... That's low. I would be pissed off, but Novalogic got fined millions for using pirated software. Cool.

I end this little speech by saying FUCK YOU to the dim-witted arcade crowd. If you see a simulation that looks like fun, either learn how to appreciate simulations, or fuck off and buy something else more appropriate for your IQ level and attention span. DO NOT whine about it.

Of course, thanks, dopeman, for making it available to those interested in it. Nobody should have to buy this shit..."
,F1977,2008-02-22T22:41Z,"No_Bs please crawl back under that M$ flight simulator rock you came from.. The only one who's whining here is you, no one else. The only one without brains here seems to be you since you can't see the ""smart"" move by these game companies.. They do what the majority of the players, (end-users), wishes in order to profit the most out of the market. May not be what some of us end-users wants but sure pleases the majority of us the end-users a.k.a buyers of the final product...

Ps. I know its an reply to an very old post, just cant stand seeing this moron whine about it here.. "
,postup5,2008-05-01T23:12Z,this is still a good game and I will continue to seed it until 1:1
