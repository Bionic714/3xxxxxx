,kokofjong,2007-06-27T23:56Z,"This update f*cks up my install, Nexus is asking for license file."
,lagoona,2007-06-29T11:35Z,"someone wrote this message below. I havnÂ´t tried it yet so I donÂ´t know if it works:
""In order not to get the license issue problem, you'll need to get offline else the software will check online if the license is valid. As long you're using this software offline, you can use it"""
,DigitalCyberwave,2007-10-08T20:00Z,"Uhm, I downloaded it but it still doesn't work. It starts off fine, but literally about 2 seconds later the message comes up and the output is muted. Doesn't anyone have just a license zip?"
,DownloadingTheFile,2007-10-29T19:40Z,someone seed :( really need this now
,mmmmark,2008-04-03T22:11Z,if you are using fl studio use the 1.0.9dll and the license problem will be gone :)
,driver76,2008-10-19T15:02Z,"ATT FOR ANYONE HAVING ISSUES. THERES A LOT OF CRAP ON THE MESSAGE BOARD HERE ABOUT THIS PLUGIN. READ THIS< AND YOU WILL HAVE A FULLY WORKING NEXUS..

The most important files you will need for a successfull install is the '0TestTone'. This file is crucial for operation because its the file that all patches reference to. Without it you will still get Nexus to work but it will give constant errors loading sounds and will constantly remind you it cannot find the testtone file.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GO HERE

http://refx.com/?lang=en&page=products/nexus/downloads


Download the NEXUS CONTENT ONLY (which is actually pretty good) The '0TestTone' file is in there. WHne you have downloaded the 1.4gig of content just place it in your documents and settings folder, or where ever else you like. THEN download the 1.4 crack of Nexus from here and install. Launch your DAW/Sequencer and load nexus. At this point it will ask you where the '0TestTone' files is. It will be wherever you copied the 1.4 gig of content you downloaded and should be here inside the following folders>>>>

Presets - Nexus content -Samples - Rom - '0TestTone.nxs' CLICK THE FILE AND NEXUS SHOULDNT EVER ASK FOR THE FILES AGAIN UNLESS YOU DO A NEW INSTALL OR CHANGE THE LOCATION OF YOUR SAMPLES.


DO THAT, and I guarantee it will work.

EXPANSION PACKS: Just about all the ones here are corrupt but for the most part you will be able to use about 80% of all samples. I couldnt get the Piano and Hard style expansions to work regardless of what I did. Sample files can easily be corrupted so if you cant get some sounds or one or two expansion packs to work dont sweat it.

I must also say this is an excellent ROM sample player. Its rather inspiration and lets you get on with creating music rather than tweaking endless knobs.

I like this plugin so much that I will probably buy it when I can afford it. I actually do buy software I like so this is looking like a contender for a purchase. It may not seem it but I do support the software industry, I just do it on my terms.

Good Luc


PS
Dont download this so called fix. Just get 1.3.9 or 1.4"
,eviljunkie,2009-04-23T12:41Z,i need this else some of my expansions dont work they say i need the 1.1.0 installed!
