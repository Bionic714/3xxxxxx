,Laya,2007-04-07T19:59Z,"Dear freeforallo79
After copied the file to my laptop and follow your direction. 

The autoplay doesn't work then I went to The Rosetta Stone==> The Rosetta Stone but I cannot find TheRosettaStone.exe but there was TheRosettaStone (Macromedia Projector). Is it the same one you are talking?

After I clicked it the programe was opened but there was a message ""no language data found""
What should I do?

Thanks alot"
,freeforall079,2007-04-08T10:25Z,"In folder options --> tools --> view I have Hide extensions for known file types Unchecked so I see  the .exe extension.  

Do you have the CD mounted or in the CD drive when launching the program?  "
,Laya,2007-04-08T12:20Z,"Dear freeforall079

In which folder are you talking about?

I can see the RosettaStone.exe file in the winRAR first I tried extract the Autorun and then the Rosetta Stone file both can open the program but same thing happend ""no lanaguage data found""

Then I try to extract the whole file in winRAR but same thing happen.

Is there anything to do with the file .iso?

Sorry I have so many question but I don't have much computer knowledge."
,Laya,2007-04-08T13:17Z,"Dear freeforall079

,Mr yuck,2007-06-04T03:02Z,"Ok, so I tried making a .iso from RosettaStone.exe and mounted it on a CD-R, but it still says that there's no language data.  Did I make the .iso wrong?"
,helifiks,2007-07-04T18:53Z,Hi. I'm no sure how to mount the .iso to the cd-rom. Anyone who could help me??

,mealmarket,2007-11-13T08:10Z,Whenever I try to install I get the message it tries to find  file called blankback.dcr. Help!!!
,steve_daniel,2007-11-27T22:23Z,Great...worked no problems - thanks.
,gesangbaer,2007-12-21T09:18Z,I couldn't use this ISO either. I burned it to CD and it shows as an invalid file format. If alcohol or daemon tools will work for the ISO then burning it should work as well ...
,cray1000,2008-02-10T05:15Z,"This seems to work great, BUT, the german 1 and 2 on the torrents is 450mb+ and it still needs the program files.  So how does this with 377mb including the program files end up being less than the language files alone?  Is this possibly why the speech part doesnt work right?"
,Skoyle,2008-02-14T08:22Z,"I clicked show hidden files but my computer didn't find therosettastone.exe file anywhere, what do i do?"
