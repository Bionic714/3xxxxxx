The following instructions are also in Instructiont.txt contained in this archive

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Copy the Catalog.Live Subscribe file into the Symantec LiveSubscribe Directory..... 

Win 9X/Me : 
C:\WINDOWS\All Users\Application Data\Symantec\LiveSubscribe 

Win 2K/XP : 
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Symantec\LiveSubscribe 

Change the attribute file to Read Only (Actually the file is Read-Only, but make sure to double check it). Apply Live Update from Norton, and voila, you have the update free till 2041.

The file is made with Read Only attributes because LiveUpdate will change the expiration to the deafult value you had before.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This thing will not let your norton live update expire before 2041
enjoy!
