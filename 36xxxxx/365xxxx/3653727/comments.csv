,Trailerpromo,2007-04-06T20:35Z,"Where the h** is the original italian soundtrack ?
You put up the dumass out of sync english + french ones, such a waste.."
,bollo50,2007-04-08T16:34Z,"So what about the original italian soundtrack, did somebody else experience the same problem. Anyone ?
I would like to see this flick, but it's not worth to download without the original soundtrack. Since italian flicks from the 60/70s always have terrible english dubs. "
