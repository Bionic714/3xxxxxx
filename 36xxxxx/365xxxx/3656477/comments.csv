Before there all questions on me descend. I have used Nokia and those work very well. The most are freeware, now only what more skilful at each other. By means of Internet you can come therefore also to these programme \. However NEVER pay!! There its sites where they ask money for unlock and that is really not necessary!
Or everything well do not work weet I, but I have 1 mobile.
It is meesta, however, this way that you simlock a year old must be before you can him unlocken, but I weet also not what kind of which toestel applies.
Success people, for further questions ff googelen!!! "

Before there are fired questions upon me . I have used a Nokia and that worked very well. Most are freeware, now only put together . By Internet ,you can also obtain  these programs. However NEVER pay!! There are sites where they ask money for unlocking and that is really not necessary!
If everything works out fine for YOUR phone, i do not know, i only have 1 cellphone.
It is usually this way: Your simlock has to be a year old must be before you can unlock, but I don't know if it applies to your phone as well.
Good luck people, for further questions, just use google!!! "
