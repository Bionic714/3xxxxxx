--------------------
|   Instructions   |
--------------------

1. Install NOD32 2.x. Check \\\"Set update parameters later\\\" to get past the password screen during the commercial installation. DO NOT RESTART AFTER INSTALLING!

2. Install NOD32 FiX.

3. Now restart your computer.

4. Enjoy! ;)

Note #1: If you already have NOD32 fully installed just skip Step #1. But, you\\\'ll still need to reboot after applying the FiX to ensure the events get properly placed in the NOD32 Scheduler.

Note #2: If you already have the FiX installed you do NOT need to uninstall, new versions will auto-detect all your old installations!

|       WTF        |
--------------------

This basicly makes that 30 day trial for NOD32 last...oh...40,000 YEARS! It also changes the default update server to that of the eval signatures so you no longer need a password to update NOD32.


--------------------
|    Legal Note    |
--------------------

To my knowledge, applying a simple value to your registry is 100% LEGAL. I, nor you, have modified any of ESET\\\'s files. Meaning, this FiX is perfectly legal and you are breaking NO laws by using it. ;)
