cosmigo pro motion
pro motion is a pixel oriented drawing and animation software for Windows.

If you are looking for a tool that helps you with creating detailed graphics (logos, buttons, icons) and animations on pixel level then your search has probably ended now.

pro motion is ideal for artists working on detailed graphics for small displays like used with PDAs, handheld computers and mobile phones or to create light weight graphics for the web or Macromedia Flash applications.

Besides dozens of tools and functions there is even a special support for tile based graphics and the tile palette management (Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance etc.).
