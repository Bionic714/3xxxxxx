,Marcinowski,2007-04-01T00:19Z,"I know this has nothing to do with this torrent, but could someone post an ISO of the Xbox 360 Magazine Disc that has the TimeShift Demo on it? I really want to play it. The PC version sucks."

,Peppeisel,2007-04-02T23:20Z,why wont it unzip?
,BobSagetOwns,2007-04-03T03:42Z,"Well Peppeisel  since ur the only one who has posted this problem i suspect that it is u and or ur computer... 

Do u have winzinp or winrar???"
,Peppeisel,2007-04-03T06:26Z,"yeap I do, it comes up with a box asking if I want to add files, and I also tried unzipping with another programe and that came up with ""1 error/warnings"" so I clicked close and it comes up with: ""error, archive could not be loaded. Verify archive location and password (if encrypted) and try the unzip operation again""

I don't understand why it does this though, as I've downloaded games and unzipped them and they work perfectly fine.

sorry for being a pain =P"
