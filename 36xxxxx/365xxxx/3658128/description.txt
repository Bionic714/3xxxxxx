                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverberations from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are felt worldwide-the 
conflict is perhaps the most divisive, polarizing and documented political 
issue of our time. Encounter Point moves beyond sensational and dogmatic 
images to tell the story of four civilians who sacrifice their safety, public 
standing, communities and homes in order to press for a grassroots movement 
for non-violence and peace.

These true civic leaders-an Israeli settler, a convicted Palestinian fighter, 
a bereaved Israeli mother and a wounded Palestinian ex-prisoner-navigate 
suicide bombings and checkpoints to meet with militants on both sides. Their 
journeys lead them to the unlikeliest places, as they stem hatred among their 
people and confront the fear within themselves. Encounter Point explores what 
drives these, and thousands of other, like-minded civilians to overcome anger 
and grief to work for peace, and asks why-with the world's cameras focused on 
this conflict-the public has never heard about these courageous and vital 
efforts.

Encounter Point chronicles a movement to push Palestinian and Israeli societies 
towards a tipping point, towards a new consensus for non-violence and peace. 
Perhaps, years from now, the actions of these everyday leaders will be 
recognized as a catalyst for constructive change in the region.
