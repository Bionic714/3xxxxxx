,Fofo,2007-05-25T18:05Z,"if you heard good things about this band you gotta listen to their 2 album diabolical have good memories from that album rally set the bands standard from that album.
but please if you like the records buy them the metal bands are not britney spears and they dont earn lots of money :)
if you dont like it dont buy it simple as that :)
support youre local metal scene :)"
