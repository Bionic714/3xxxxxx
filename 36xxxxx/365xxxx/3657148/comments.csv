first of all many, many THX for your upload, too !!! Their 2nd album is a real gem of prog music ...  ;-)

I would really like to finish this download, but since days myself and several other dl'ers stuck at the same percentage when the last seed expired. So we could really need some HELP !! When someone of those who finished this album could re-open a window for this - that would be great !!!

Many, many thanks for your help in advance !!!"

Personally -  I owned this album (vinyl) some 30 years ago, lost it in the beginning of the 80's and haven't heard it since.

I can only pleed to your good heart, Heiko69. Please - let us finish this download. At least one of us, and we'll take it from there.

Thanks!"
