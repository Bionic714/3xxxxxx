,vidursingal,2007-04-02T13:31Z,is this ISO format ?
,Criten,2007-04-03T12:00Z,"Yes, this is an ISO image."
,tuppen2000,2007-04-05T11:16Z,Tackar ..jag hoppas att det funkar..Vad jag förstår så har du varit snäll och redan skapat en Iso av dom konstiga filerna och att det bara är att köra igång
,tuppen2000,2007-04-06T13:10Z,"204 nedladdningar och ingen som tackar...Bortskämda slynglar!

204 downloads and nobody says Thx...Divas Aribas!"
,lisamushroom,2007-04-07T20:41Z,Thanx! =)
,yazzz,2007-04-08T19:28Z,Do you know whats the difference between this one and the latin version?
,Criten,2007-04-11T13:24Z,"There are many differences between the Castilian and the Latin version. The biggest one must be that Spain uses ""vosotros"" for second person plural, which has its unique verb conjugation. However, Latinamerica uses ""ustedes"", with a different verb conjugation. There are also some differences between expressions, idioms and words."
,vidursingal,2007-04-15T17:41Z,"i can not figure out how to run this ISO image.
can you help ?"
,vidursingal,2007-04-15T17:46Z,"just to let u know. 
i burnt the ISO file using ImgBurn onto a CDR. 
but dont know what to do after that "
,Security718,2007-04-20T00:30Z,Thank you very much. 
,Criten,2007-04-22T11:20Z,"In this torrent you find two ISO images, one with the installation software and one with the Spanish lessons.

The Rosetta Stone v2.0.8.1.iso  -  This one contains the installation software

The Rosetta Stone - Spanish (Spain) - Level I+II.iso  -  This one contains the Spanish lessons.


You have to install the software to use the Spanish lessons. After you have installed it, you put in the Spanish lessons CD and run the software which you have installed. The software will find the lessons CD automatically and you can begin to enjoy the lessons."
,Criten,2007-04-22T11:25Z,"You can also use the DAEMON Tools which is disk image emulator that mounts images of DVD and CD media on virtual drives. Then you don't need to burn ISO image to a CD.

,Jarks,2007-06-23T14:48Z,"Critten,

Thanks so much for putting up the torrent! 

I downloaded the files just fine. I already had the 2.0.6 version of the application installed, so I burned the language iso to CD. But when I start up the program, it says - Error parsing CATMPC.TRS: Could not recognize Spanish (Spain)""

Any idea what I'm doing wrong? Does this language disc work only with version 2.0.8? Any help is greatly appreciated!"
,rugrat,2007-06-30T00:56Z,Cheers for this works great..Mucha Grasias..
,Ricshire7,2007-07-28T08:17Z,thanks a lot
,GelJel,2007-08-09T18:09Z,"Burnt the V.2.0.8.1 in CD. 
Downloaded and Burnt Spanish language
Installed V.2.0.8.1

But when I run it it shows the NO LANGUAGE DATA FOUND. 

I have two CDs now, the one with BOTH v.2.0.8.1 installer and the LANGUAGE 

the other one is just the language. 

I do not know why the both CD are not being recognized by the software. What am I missing?"
,razzjr1,2007-08-19T04:09Z,"I too would like to say thanks for the opportunity to download this torrent, but I would also like to use it. I am ahving the same problem as GelJel at 2007-08-09 18:09 CET. Is there something more that we need to do?"

,amandajm,2007-08-29T17:57Z,"I downloaded this program, and it loads up fine until it is looking for a cd-rom. I tried to ""mount image"" using the Daemon program and the Spanish (Spain) - Level I+II.iso file, but I still can't get the program to load up. Any suggestions?"

,lucidinterval,2008-02-01T16:26Z,"Hi..

I just downloaded this file Its a 697Mb iso file that says Rosetta Stone Spanish I+II, no v2.0.8.1 files. I've mounted and extracted all the files but there doesnt seem to be an application file to run it from. there are only the numerous .swa and a whole bunch of picture files. Can anyone give me instructions as to what I am supposed to do to make it work? Do I need any other application?"
,mzmonika,2008-02-01T16:55Z,"Does this work for mac Leopard? I clicked on The Rosetta Stone v2.0.8.1.iso and I get a Warning popup that says ""The following disk images failed to mount""."
,kilerbootsman,2008-02-04T21:34Z,"I have been trying to get this program for a while. Thank you!!!

tip- use poweriso to mount the program and install it. then mount the spanish packs and the program will automatically find them."
,kevceltic,2008-03-11T00:44Z,"Got this to work great but the sound doesnt work, any ideas?"

Will seed for as long as poss."

,jambodog,2010-03-21T02:24Z,I have downloaded this torrent however my knowledge on using it is extremely poor. If anyone can give me a hand please email me. greig.r@hotmail.co.uk
,jambodog,2010-03-21T23:22Z,"Ok i managed to work it using daemon tools.

However, does anyone else have the problem with any translation? I mean, it says the spanish words but it doesnt say what it means in english. Whats the point in that?"
,thelaird1,2010-06-02T00:50Z,"jambodog, that is the point of it. It does not tell you the English translations, because it leaves you to work it out for yourself. There are options for a preview though.

Does anyone know where 3, 4, and 5 can be downloaded for v2?

I had to create a virtual drive using daemon to read from the language files, but this all works perfectly for me and saved me a good few hundred quid. Thanks for the upload"
,daltron101,2010-07-18T23:15Z,thanx Criten. worked great. ive already learned a bit in just an hour. un nino encima un coche.....a child( male) above or on top of a car. : )

,dangeraus,2011-03-01T15:52Z,"worked for me perfectly! had to use daemon tools lite which i d/l for free from their site, then watched a 2 min youtube video to learn how to use it. perfect! "
,riddle57,2011-07-07T10:24Z,"i figured out the dl for just the rosetta stone just fine, but when it came to the spanish package i dont know what to do.
i extracted the spanish file to power iso what do i do with all the files that are on there?
i apoligize im new to this. smebody email me with help please. spectrum4675@yahoo.com"
,Ridonk,2011-08-29T01:31Z,For those wondering: This is a fully functioning copy of Rosetta Stone - Spanish Levels 1+2. I mounted using Daemon Tools and installed. Without any further modification I launched it and began working on the lessons. Thumbs up.
,camo12345,2011-09-02T08:13Z,"Okay, this guide is for total beginners who have never even downloaded a torrent before, but it can be used by other people (it's just very dumbed down):

Step 1: If you haven't already, download MagicISO or Daemon - these are programs that create virtual CD's and DVD's onto your hard drive... this means you do not need to waste time or money using real CD/DVD's. You can download the MagicISO from here on the pirate bay. I used MagicISO.

Step 2: Once you have your virtual CD/DVD program running, download this torrent using a bit torrent client such as uTorrent. Once it has downloaded open the file location (the place where it is downloaded to).

Step 3: Right click on the one called ""The Rosetta Stone v2.0.8.1"" and it should give you the option to ""Mount"". If you do not see ""Mount"" then you should see ""MagicISO"", click on Magic ISO and then ""Mount"". It will give you the driver letter where you want to mount it (Such as G: or E:).

Step 4: When you have mounted it, an auto-play window may appear giving you the option to ""Run autorun.exe"" or it will give you the option to ""Open folder to view files"". You want to choose the option ""Open folder to view files"".

Step 5: Once the folder is opened to view the files, leave it alone, dont click anything just yet, we will come back to it later. Go back to folder where the torrent was downloaded to and right click on the file called ""The Rosetta Stone - Spanish (Spain) - Level I+II"". 
Again, click ""MagicISO"" but this time click on ""Set number of drivers"" and then select ""2"". You need 2 drivers because you are running both of the files at the same time. Once you have selected ""2"" click ""Mount"" and this time select the empty drive (one of them will just have a letter like ""E:"" with nothing else written after it, select that one). 
The auto-play screen may pop up again, if it does just click the ""X"" and close it, we dont need it.

Step 6: Now, lets go back to the folder we opened before (when you chose to ""Open folder to view files""). In this folder you will see many items... you need to RIGHT click on the one called ""setup"", it is at the bottom of the list. When you have right-clicked this you need to select ""Run as Administrator"". 
Give the authorisation to ""Run as Administrator"", and then Rosetta Stone will begin to install perfectly, you now just need to click ""Next"" a few times.


If you have any trouble following those steps then there are 2 scenarios left for you:

1. You haven't followed the steps correctly... or
2. All hope is lost for you, nobody can help you."
,mshgreen,2011-09-03T18:58Z,Good job! Works very well. I recommend using Daemon Tools to mount rather than burn on iso.
,usedpilot,2011-10-27T13:56Z,"Can someone upload Fluenz Spanish 3, 4, and 5? Thanks!"
,pabolton,2011-12-18T00:18Z,"people having problems- 
1st instal rosetta stone itself. e.g rosetta stone 3.4.5.
then either mount the iso files onto a disc or get virtual clone drive which i recommend and mount the files virtually that way. then open rosetta stone itself and install language from the mounted iso."
,keleach89,2012-01-22T23:01Z,"Is anyone sweet enough to walk me through this step by step via skype? If so, please skype me at keleach89. Thx!"
,Fawers,2012-04-16T19:27Z,"It was already said by pabolton, but I'm gonna say it again.

You need Rosetta Stone itself to run any of the languages you found here or on the web. Just search for ""Rosetta Stone"" here on PB and you will find the application needed.

And, at last, you need either to emulate the cd image or burn it onto a real cd. If you want to emulate it, I suggest Alcohol 120% - which can as well be found here.

Cheers!"
