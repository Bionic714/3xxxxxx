,chatbleu,2007-04-07T16:55Z,"Thanks Yeyo for the response with is more than I got from Magnus Pickle
Among the programmes that can NOT convert this piece of crap are:
Nero, Total Video Converter, Allok, Ashampoo 6, 
Blaze Media Pro, Divx Author, Mov Avi Video Suite,
MovKit Batch Video Converter, Winavi Video Converter....etc.....
I've managed to download a ""proper"" VOB copy elsewhere..... avoid this  ogg-xvid-vorbis crap!"

chatbleu: you are an idiot.  Use google because it isnt magnus' job to hold your hand.  heres a vague hint... mplayer
