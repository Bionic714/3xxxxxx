,Haldor_D,2007-04-11T20:21Z,"I'm so sorry if my somewhat feeble attempt at irony slipped by unnoticed   ;)   Actually, it's the everlasting debate: quality versus complete. And i prefer complete. Call me a nerd if you like but i prefer all the original menus and also all the extras. But i'm also grateful to all the uploaders whatever they upload, be it complete or stripped."
,einstein56,2007-04-16T14:52Z,"Thanks again to MR Fear, you're great!
So does anybody have old Dark Shadows episodes to upload? I loved that show too. If not, can anybody give me an invite to Demonoid, they have some there?
ANyway, thanks again to Mr Fear, and if I can help with other trek stuff, let me know."
