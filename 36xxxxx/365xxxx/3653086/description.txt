Imagining Argentina (2003)

Buenos Aires in the 1970s was a hotbed of dictatorial political unrest marked by a rash of disappearances (read: abductions and murders). Theatre director Carlos Rueda (Antonio Banderas) and his wife, Cecilia (Emma Thompson), get caught up in the flux when she writes an inflammatory editorial. When Cecilia\\\'s jailed, Carlos develops the supernatural ability to see the future -- a future where he imagines his wife dying during an escape attempt.
