,bearcy,2007-12-21T00:32Z,"I'm seeding this torrent now. I've got a 100 % of the files downloaded, and am uploading at 200 kB/s.

This ""Windows vista all languages all versions.iso""-file is not infected by anything, and works quite well."
,bearcy,2007-12-21T00:40Z,"Try before you buy!

Only some of the files in the crack folders may be branded as to be infected by virus or malware.

The most common reason why the AntiVirus tools are branding cracks to be infected by virus, is in order to scare us; so that we will obediently pay the expensive licences. Even if we haven't tried out the programs yet. Most of these files are not infected by anything but they are branded as to be from the AntiVirus companies, because they co-operate with the manufacturers of the expencive Software we download, and get paid for the effort.

This is why you should always configure your AntiVirus tool to never search in your torrent download folders. And copy the files out from there before scan or use.

A well advice is also to download a torrent with VMware Workstation 6, and install Vista in a virtual PC directly from the .ISO-file, while you're running XP. If you're just curious; and don't want to risk fucking up your system with something you're not yet familiar with."
,bearcy,2007-12-27T12:31Z,"The VMware Workstation 6 that I've got downloaded a 100 % of, and am uploading at 200 kB/s, is this one:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3752273/VMware.Workstation.v6.0.0.45731.and.ACE.Edition.Incl.Keygen-ZWT_

I know that there are several torrents here, giving you perhaps a newer version; but this one was the first I downloaded, and it works fine with me."
,bearcy,2008-01-02T05:51Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3895342/VMware.Fusion.v1.1.0.62573.Incl.Keymaker-EMBRACE

Seamlessly run Windows, Linux and other PC operating systems on your Intel-based Mac. VMware Fusion gives you freedom. I upload this torrent as well."
,lapdog_007,2008-01-17T04:13Z,"Hi guys, is this version OEM or Retail? thanks"
,lapdog_007,2008-01-18T01:25Z,"sorry for the double post... i just downloaded this, i got to about 150kb/s after about an hour - great torrent! Trend Micro Internet Security 2008 detects a few trojans in the cracks, but the actual iso file is clean and great! it is retail version, and lives up to it's description. Thanks messned! 5 Stars!"
,Henuu,2008-01-20T21:10Z,seed plz :)
,CR-7,2008-01-24T07:11Z,is this for vista 64bit!????
,bearcy,2008-01-31T04:16Z,"This is the 32-bit version of Windows Vista.

I've got a 100 % of the files, and have started seeding this one again. Every time my PC is on. I need to sleep sometime, and haven't got it on all night; I live in Oslo in a small one-room flat."
,bearcy,2008-02-01T07:16Z,"It is when you confuse your AntiVirus tool to seem like a superior boss - that you need to wag your tail for - and obey in every way, that you fall out of reality; and start to hurt here!

Then you start paying for every crap software out there, before you've been responsible enough to familiarize yourself with the programs, in order to decide if they're worth paying for. In order to make you some money."
,bearcy,2008-02-01T07:17Z,"You can't be expected to pay for everything before you've tried it out first. There's too much expencive crap out there, that are non-intuitive and unusable for the layman. The programs that are uninteresting for most common filesharers; presuppose expencive technical education for those who don't use the same programs at work. The programs themselves often cost more than anyone can afford a licence!"

,cyberax2650,2008-05-29T12:36Z,How about updating it with the SP1 slipstreamed? That would be nice!
,Phantom15,2008-06-11T13:00Z,"Hey this is my first comment on the entire website, anyways I hope this work's. All i really need it for is to install HALO2 on it. I have tried patches for it to work on xp but none of them have work so I am going to do this. It is the longest download in my torrent history before though,,, It is at 17% and it has been 10 hours since I have started this. I really hope this is worth the waiting. I have one question though, What are they going to do with Windows Vista in the future if everyone says it is VERY  UNSTABLE? Is it even unstable? I hope it is not because for all us 1,000's of people who download this and over wright ""install"" on top of xp you can NEVER get xp back. I recommend for people to portion their hard drive(s) with partition magic or something and just install vista on that one partiton and still have the other partition being used as xp. Anothrwards just have two operating systems in one, It is a whole lot safer. Thats just my Reccomendation......
Anyways thanks for the great download!!!!!!! "
