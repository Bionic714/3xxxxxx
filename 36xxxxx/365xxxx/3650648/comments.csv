There's always a little space between. My point is that the sand niggers who were on those planes were trainees from Qatar Airways, trying on 767s for size as an agreement between the airlines. Then the towers swayed hither and thither because of the winds aloft, accidentally hitting the aircraft. It's unfortunate that the US government is using the tragedy as an excuse to erect a taco muncher-proof  wall along the border with Mexico. You didn't think we'd notice?"
