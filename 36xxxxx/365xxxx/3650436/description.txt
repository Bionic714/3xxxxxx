Good fun, plenty of killer fight sequences, and Gordon Liu with a rather naughty moustache! Can't beat that!

Plot:	The 11th prince (Chia-hui) tries to keep from getting killed by the 4th prince, who fears the 11th prince will become king instead of him. To kill the prince, he hires a ruthless general played by Lo Lieh.

Overview:	Gordon Liu teams up with Wong Yu as the 11th son of the Chinese Emperor, who whilst traveling incognito to the palace is first thwarted then helped by this roguish vagabond, Ho. Beset by tricksters, waylaid by would-be assassins, and ambushed by lethal Mongolian archers, their relationship grows amidst a welter of comic set-pieces, stunning fight scenes, and some of the finest martial arts choreography ever to grace the Jade Screen. A kung fu landmark, not to be missed!
