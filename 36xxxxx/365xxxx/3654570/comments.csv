,morghanphoenix,2007-04-05T04:26Z,"Yes, the large client is for paying players. Cheaper and better than WoW if you pay to play, and you can't beat free if you only want classic and noatum wars. Of course, there's only so many times people can walk by you in a battle mech before you decide to shell out the cash to get your own."
,Marxist,2007-04-05T08:25Z,so Notum Wars is free now?(i ve played AO 2 years ago)
,Sefus,2007-04-06T08:07Z,"Sure is.
In my opinion, it will only be a matter of time before more of the game is free."
