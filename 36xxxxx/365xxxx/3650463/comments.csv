,findmusic123,2007-04-04T16:47Z,Don't waste your time.  Uploader is obvisiously not seeding.  What a waste.
,barfotabarn,2007-04-16T00:49Z,"Yeah.
Why the fuck put up and then not seed ?
To annoy people, and show them what they are missing ???
It`s mean..."
,trixiehobbit,2007-05-13T23:16Z,I can put all this up i one torrent. But my collection is in FLAC and you have to convert it to Mp3 by yourself. About 8 times bigger. Notify me if you're interested.
,trixiehobbit,2007-05-13T23:17Z,I mean almost. I don't have the records from the 60's

,hentooth,2007-07-04T23:49Z,"BUGGER, I wanted all Golden earring did, or at least most of it, the uploader needs to decide if he's serious about this torrent thing or not"

,mad_swan,2008-04-07T16:59Z,"trixiehobbit: I'm interested! I personally prefer flac over mp3. If you can, thanks a lot!"
[T],binkerbo,2008-04-22T23:31Z,"I would interested in the FLAC torrent as well.  Since this is this uploader's only torrent, I assume he's either gone or he doesn't realize there are 25 people stuck at 73%  "

,heathcliff13,2008-04-30T02:27Z,"Help, does anybody have this...please seed!"
,mastermould2,2009-02-01T03:25Z,I have added more of missing files to this torrent hope they ok since the uploader has done a runner
,IBZSAEG,2009-02-14T09:59Z,"This really stinks! Got up to 96 % seeding and trying to download more. Suppose we better leave this and get the seperate albums, because this torrent is dead!"
,SeedGuy1001,2012-04-04T01:33Z,"Maybe if you ask politely, and also seed until complete! 

I have seeded 200+ items on my real account. most are gone! its frustrating to spend time on initial seed and no one cares! lets stop leeching. make a label for items unseeded, and let them run. you do not need to seed more than 1.0. but just keep it in a folder and let it ride until seeded!

Do you see how it only takes one person to want something? then many? its frustrating! Seed/Seed/Seed

Let it run, and it will last for others like you! 
That is how torrents work!

Don't blame 1 person for leechers!

ok.. bye..

,SeedGuy1001,2012-04-04T01:44Z,"toxsb I will ask that you seed this torrent, drop me a line, I will help seed, even until 20.0. server has 20.0 tb of space. 
I am not here to leech, but to help seed!
