,danelsan,2010-01-24T11:26Z,"Hmm...After extracting, I have 4 CDs and Illusi0n's text file. However, during installation the game is asking me for CD 5...

Does anybody knows WTF is going on? Is a disk missing from the torrent? Did I made a mistake with extraction? Or something else?

Any hint is welcome"
,Gothantic,2010-12-04T21:39Z,Danelson. If i remember correctly from when i had the original game in disc form when it asks for disk 5 you insert dist one again.... i could be wrong however. Just try changing the mounted disk at that point till it works.
