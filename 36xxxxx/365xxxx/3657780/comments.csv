,monofonik,2007-04-10T03:33Z,"I easily got my hands on a serial, in fact, it was almost effortless. All you have to do is actually buy the software.

From Microsoft or Apple, I can understand software piracy. From a guy doing this out of his apartment, that's shameful."
,antamony,2007-04-11T04:18Z,"@monofonik

This is a torrent site, not a church.

Go someplace else the next time you feel that uncontrollable urge to preach.

Either it's piracy, or it's not."

,mac_davis,2007-06-08T03:25Z,It's basically the best Mac torrent program out there and hasn't been cracked yet and serials don't seem to have been found either. :(
