You mean I can get some money out of them (I would settle for a little support) for all the misery they have put me through over the years with their buggy instable insecure shit OS software?   Vista is even worse than their last XP crap... all flash (stolen from Mac) and no substance...  read up on it from independent sources if you don't believe me. 

Thanks PhXAnarchy for letting me know this is MS software... now I can avoid it like the plague!

The problem is that those Google assholes are getting as bad as MS...

,mart9012,2008-07-31T16:52Z,"OK, this is daft.  Linux is just a version of UNIX, and is ok given its free, but remember it has a debugging dept of several millions.. lol  It should be bloody perfect, yet isn't!

Flash stuff, stolen from MAC?  No.  Both Microsoft and Apple stole the graphical interface from Xerox and their PARC research center around the same time.

Get a grip.  Microsoft really pioneered personal computers and became succesful although I agree their software is bloated and over complex.  I really hate Vista over its complexity but it is aiming itself at users not experts.

MacOS is now based on UNIX as is Linux, but Apple just as big a corporate company and very over priced as they always were. 

jeez at least get your history right people...   "
