Composed by Didymos. 


Arranged, engineered, mixed & mastered by Henry Kolari.

Synths: Kawai K5000W, Korg DW8000, Roland JV-2080, Kurzweil 
K2500 & Korg N264.


Style of the CD is more diverse.  Droning chord progression, ambient 
as well as tight synth pop arrangements all have a common factor: 
they are melodic and full of drama.


"...Rippling with nice melodies, and nowhere 
too fierce or too spectacular, but certainly not 
ambient, it sounds a bit like the tranquil work of 
Jarre or Vangelis, even with a bit of imagination 
that is as cheerful as Nattefrost. These are nice 
and calming sounds... exceedingly well-suited 
for relaxing after a busy work day." 
(E-dition magazine / Andrë de Waal)



NOTES 
The man behind the pseudonym Didymos is Tommi Haavisto, a Finn, 
who's been producing electronic music since the 80s. His music has 
many times been compared to that of Tangerine Dream, or even JM 
Jarre, eventhough the melodies and arrangements do show clear 
'fingerprints' of his own.
