,RyuMyoto,2009-03-17T23:35Z,"Thanks for the upload. 
Quick question. I am running windows XP pro and When I run the game, it doesn't play any of the videos and when I go to the new game menu it doesn't change the screen but merely adds the create character option and my mouse starts to leave a trail that only clears up when I Alt-tab. Any fix for it would be great. Thanks."
