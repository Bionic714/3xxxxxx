Plus, rate 2DVDs per month is pointless; you gonna spend ages before you reach 79/79."

How I said in the announcement of the ascent, this one series began to be sold in Spain the past month of January therefore I am raising DVD according to sends to my the company that the extraction on sale in Spain. At the outset, the intention was to raise to a film each 5 DVD of series, because therefore me they sent them to me, but the form to distribute the changed series to and now sends a film to me each 10 DVD of series. This it is the reason by which I have still not raised any film: because still I do not have."
