Wiki: Yurie is a petite, shy and otherwise ordinary middle-school girl who suddenly discovers that, overnight, she has become a kami (a god in the Shinto sense). She has no idea what kind of god she is or what her powers are. Her friends give her the nickname "kamichu" from "kami" (god) and "ch?gakusei" (middle school student). In her journey she meets many gods and learns the ways of the gods in order to become a great god herself.

At the 2005 Japan media arts festival, Kamichu! was honored with the Best Animation award.
