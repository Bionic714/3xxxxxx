2006 NEARfest Records NFR0008 (CD)

For an uninterrupted 45 minutes, Steve Roach captivated the 
NEARfest audience in 2005 with a hyper-charged set designed to 
create an exhilarating ride through the many worlds found in his sonic 
landscapes. Fire-breathing primal-voiced synths, pulsing rhythms and 
haunting didgeridoo passionately intertwine as STORM SURGE 
progresses to an emotional climax. This is a well-timed release, as 
those who are experiencing the KAIROS DVD can hear first first-hand 
one of the many concerts that helped shaped the outcome of the 
DVD. This abbreviated set was supported by visuals that were part of 
the developing KAIROS project. STORM SURGE: LIVE AT NEARFEST 
is presented just as it occurred, with no edits or post studio fixes; the 
sound of the hall and the audience is all a part of the impact of this 
powerful live document.


A review from Sonic Curiosity:
This release from 2006 offers 46 unedited minutes of Roach's live 
performance at NEARfest at the Zoellner Arts Center in Bethlehem, 
Pennsylvania, on July 9, 2005. Roach's skills at producing an intensely 
lush live performance are well-known, and this recording perpetuates 
his capabilities with astounding scope. Ethereal textures coalesce like 
gathering stormclouds, but the rainfall from these thunderheads is 
sparkling and vivacious, each droplet of sound infecting the audience 
with a dreamy clarity certain to expand consciousness. Fragile effects 
mix with synthetic rhythms to achieve a vibrant environment of thrilling 
depth. The tonalities waft with luxurious expansion, while soothing 
embellishments swell with pulsating resonance. Rhythms come and go, 
punctuating the heavenly tapestry with remote propulsion, never overt 
but still contagious in their subtle and complex motivation. The 
presence of liquid sounds only serves to give the tempos an earthy 
quality. Let us not forget the periodic presence of didjeridoo, whose 
soulful breathing injects an arid heritage to the seething mass of 
modern tuneage. This instrument's contributions are integral in 
establishing a pensive moodiness for the concert's dark finale. While 
steeped in a celestial demeanor, this music exhibits a certain terrestrial 
quality, grounding the audience while lifting them to dizzying altitudes. 
The overall tone is a dreamy one, although these ambient voyages 
exude a stern power that often commands more than it sedates. 
Blending classic compositions with new pieces, Roach seamlessly 
conjures a lavish soundscape of breathtaking mien.
