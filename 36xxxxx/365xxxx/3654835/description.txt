Following the dissolution of stoner rock icons Kyuss, singer John Garcia formed Unida with guitarist Arthur Seay, bassist Dave Dinsmore, and drummer Mike Cancino. Debuting in late 1998 with the EP The Best of Wayne-Gro, Unida resurfaced in mid-1999 with the full-length Coping With the Urban Coyote; following Dinsmore's departure, he was replaced by bassist Scott Reeder.
