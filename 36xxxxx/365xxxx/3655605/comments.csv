,cotkubt,2007-04-05T09:13Z,Thank you CRIMSON! Much Appreciated!
,schweinkopf,2007-04-05T09:45Z,"CRiMSON's release has bad red chroma on 1/4 of the frames resulting in     
blurring and somewhat jerky playback. See included samples. The release is 
120ms out of sync 6:13-11:53 and 170ms out 20:47-25:47. There are also     
various drops including at 4:00 and 13:00. Go Canada"

well why don't you then just download 350 meg release...."
,cotkubt,2007-04-05T13:48Z,Just adding that this is genuine and it is awesome. Very clear and well defined.
,cotkubt,2007-04-05T14:00Z,Just adding that I spoke too soon and yes some of the sync goes out... but only occasionally. Hardly noticeable.
