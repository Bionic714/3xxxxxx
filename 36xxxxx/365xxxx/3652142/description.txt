Ripped by chapter from DVD image using Smartripper.
DTS audio demuxed using BBDMUX.
APEv2 tags applied with foobar2000 0.9.4.3. 
This will play perfectly gapless with foobar2000, on other players [such as VLC] YMMV.

*** Seeking within these files occasionally causes fb2k to crash, possibly because it is reported as 754kbps [half-rate] DTS 
*** I created these files because no player I've seen can play the DVD-Audio portion of the ISO image they were created from
*** Before remuxing these with video to burn to DVD [DTS-capable authoring software includes DVD-Lab Pro] remove the APEv2 tags [with fb2k] or they will cause glitches between tracks / Enjoy!

*** As I am the initial seeder of this and have extremely limited upstream bandwidth, expect it to take a LONG time to download.  
*** Please *do* add this through other tracking sites and reseed as much as possible
*** Please keep the notes in this description in the description if you upload the torrent elsewhere
