,saberhagen83,2007-04-01T13:51Z,"Use files from the demo and copy over to this versions folder, and you get english language. This one is availible on emule as well and works."
,Panodilo,2007-04-01T13:52Z,No english version? This sucks pole.
,kem001,2007-04-01T14:29Z,No problem
,OlaNordmann7,2007-04-01T15:22Z,"From this Polish-version, I have made a ZIP-file - so that you can crack the Demo - and unlock it til a full-version.

Just take the two *.EXE-files from this Polish-release, and overwrite the Demo-version installed.

Or download my small ZIP-file I have this morning, where the two EXE-files are, and instructions:

either search for this file on eMule:

Bus Driver (Crack for English version) working

or use this ED2K-link directly into your eMule or
similar program:

ED2k: ed2k://|file|Bus%20Driver%20(Crack%20for%20English%20version)%20working.zip|893526|DCEAB9073723CEB28AF54B9C60953873|h=DKMKFROV2GZC2EFEIS4P3HDT7WJATQAE|/"

,szamoca69,2007-04-01T19:49Z,"Install this, install the demo in a different folder, copy the two exe (Busdriver, launcher) files from this release in the english demo folder... there you have it, cracked, english version :) "
,meytipeyti,2007-04-02T11:14Z,"So......

,Blackwing Dragon,2007-04-13T14:13Z,"ew, it's in dirty polak.
Lol. I got an english torrent ...and it sucked.
The game is horrible. Stupid, slow, clunky, ugly. Fun for maybe one minute before you get annoyed with it.
Sound errors as well. DO NOT GET, WASTE OF TIME."
,Starlord-99DC,2007-04-29T15:31Z,"Whats this? I cannot leech it, become i have allways a error-messi, that this isn't a valid torrent-file and something with "".svn"". Anyone a idea, what this can be? 

@ Blackwing Dragon

,Samuelthemad,2011-07-23T13:40Z,"Perhaps you should have mentioned it was in Polish, idiot. Not everyone speaks fluent Polish. And it's not working properly in-game either."
,Aaqilx,2012-07-22T12:20Z,"Windows 7 = Doesn't work.

There is an updated version 1.5 for Windows 7."
