,mikesmith,2007-07-18T02:32Z,Deftones Album Under A Different Band Name!!! Are you retard or what? Its a Chino solo project and not a Deftones
,michaeldraven,2008-02-10T09:28Z,"Both wrong. Its a completely new band. Not deftones, not a solo project from chino. Its a complete group from sacramento with chino singing and playing guitar. There are other members of the band that write the songs along with chino."

,Popes63,2008-09-22T09:57Z,Is this the leaked version or the released version? 
,AMCope,2008-10-05T10:58Z,I agree with Michaeldraven. But mikesmith you didn't have to smash the uploaders nuts for being ignorant of the band.
,stert,2008-12-06T23:06Z,yes you do
