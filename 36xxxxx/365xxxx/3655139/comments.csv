,BritneysOrifice,2007-04-04T21:35Z,"Also tested here and it works perfectly. I disagree with you, BaMordi. The flight model on this Fokker is really rather good. I, too, like the Project Fokker model, but unfortunately, there are those of us who really like to have a VC on their aircraft, and the OMWings version fits the bill perfectly. Not the greatest panel or VC, but it all works solidly, lots of liveries (if you can get them), and absolutely smooth on frames. Overall, a great aircraft. Thanks to the poster."
,Vijanty,2007-04-05T01:10Z,"I have to concur, this model is splendid!! No learning curve whatsoever and some pretty neat features too......thanks much for the upload.
Can't wait to get some liveries though."
,belga1,2007-04-05T01:19Z,"Thank you.
Was using the Project Fokker until I fly this one.
Both are good ."
