I found this a while ago and noticed that it wasn't up here, and just thought that this so wonderfully weird TV-show could use a seed here. And I for one prefer when shows are put up in one complete single big torrent.

You may find it weird that each season has a different amount of episodes, but I checked it up and its supposed to be so.

Please, help me seed it... and enjoy!
