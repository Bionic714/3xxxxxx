Thanks for this one."
,kabalizo,2007-05-22T10:16Z,Saw this many millennia ago... weird but kool. Thanks and will help seed.
,Tom Traubert,2007-06-01T04:17Z,"Nice to see that are some seeders now, since I can't be the only one forever. And I think this is the kind of torrent that deseves to be kept alive."
,gericko42,2007-06-02T09:52Z,How's the quality?  Is this a VHS to torrent or DVD quality?  I just hate to download something of this size without knowing I won't be frustrated when I see it. :)
,Tom Traubert,2007-06-03T07:53Z,You will not be dissapointed with the quality!
,Shaolinwind,2007-06-04T18:36Z,This is so cool.. lots of people are going to have lots of fun thanks to your generosity.  If I can figure out how it's done I'm going to seed too.
,voltaire57,2007-07-05T05:27Z,"Can anybody tell me what's the codec? It doesn't work here (with quicktime, vlc, etc.) Thanks!"
,Tom Traubert,2007-08-26T08:56Z,"It's regular .avi -files, it should work fine with vlc, or with any other player."
,kusari,2007-11-10T22:23Z,please share ... thx
,ph00x,2007-12-20T00:36Z,Props to Canadian sci-fi and you for seeding! I'll do the same.
,Azaris,2008-01-12T14:11Z,"Took me 2 weeks, but it's cool TV-show and with good quality. Thanks Tom:).

Will seed it for couple of weeks or more. Love it."
,mtpalms,2008-01-17T20:40Z,"Thanks for this. I just started to load it, but didn't want to wait until it was done to thank you."
,SiliconJaguar,2008-01-20T08:15Z,Hi Guys! I so want this! Please keep seeding! I am in Australia so it will take me some time to get the complete torrent as we are on meter'd data here. I am hoping 2 months should be enough for me to get it. But it depends on seeders. My download last night barely left 0.4k :( But I am a 10Mbit connection so we need more seeders. Also my plan is *free* unmeter'd uploads! So I can seed indefinatly! :) TNX! & May the Juice B wid U!
,marklins,2008-01-24T23:34Z,"One of the best sci fi series out there, along with farscape and sg1. I will definately seed."
,icehand,2008-01-26T17:38Z,"This is one of the best shows I've ever seen, but I need more seeders."
,mtpalms,2008-02-15T23:28Z,"Well, it took nearly a month, but it finished yesterday.

I can't seed on weekends, but I will be during the week.

Thanks again for this"
,ichbinlp,2008-03-30T10:17Z,"Nice! Really long ago I saw it, and I didn't see all episodes as it was broadcasted really, really late on like thursdays... I agree with you others - weird and cool in a way totally of it's own!"
,ValentineGil,2008-04-20T02:13Z,"I love this show,
great actors,
great settings,
amazing plot(s)


Thank you!

Season_2/Lexx-S02xE14-Patches_In_The_Sky
Season_2/Lexx-S02xE18-Brigadoom
Season_2/Lexx-S02xE17-The_Net 

I think I was not letting the computer ""compile"" them seconds after it hit %100....

In other words I was too ""impatient.""  However I re-tried those above 5 more times and now I', viewing happly.

LEXX series is now complete! :D Wish they made more like the LEXX or continued it story.

Remember too keep reseeding!!!!!!!!!!! Others want to see these too ya know!

THANK YOU, TOM TRAUBERT!!!!!! YOUR A GREAT MAN! "
,wingman187,2008-06-15T06:29Z,"Download is going good. So far only season one. But I can't seem to get it to play on my PS3 or burn it to a disk. I've only used Roxio though. 

Any suggestion or advice?"
,wingman187,2008-06-15T06:35Z,"P.s- I tried converting it using windows movie maker, but it said I need a codec. What codec and where could I find it? Help, please?"
,munkypotamus,2008-06-17T23:52Z,"Kai Rules.

Currently getting the DVDs of this through netflix.  Season 1 ( the 4 made for TV movies) isn't available anywhere, so i get it here (and will continue to seed for a while).

I started watching this a long time ago, when they actually ran it on Sci-Fi channel.  It was fantastic.  But i always get the feeling there was a lot edited out, (the room full of boobs on the heaven-like planet lol)   Fantastic show.

Thank you to the uploader, and those who seed."

,thestatutoryape,2008-09-20T03:59Z,Thanks Tom.  I never got to finish watching these when they were on TV.  I was suprised too when I looked here before and did not find any torrents for it.
,sweSUCKS,2008-09-27T14:36Z,SEED GODDAMIT. STUCK IN 99.0% for days!

,chipkidd,2008-11-09T13:24Z,"Just one question:
Are these dvdrips or tvrips?"
,ragarth,2008-11-14T02:25Z,"I'd like to know if this is the euro or US version as well. The UK version is better, LEXX was edited for the US."
,Youma,2008-12-14T21:49Z,"I'm not having problems with the s2 eps other ppl are talking about, but the 4.19 is distorted, and 4.21 is only audio."

,newguy69,2009-03-02T00:25Z,"Just thought i should add that the whole series of LEXX is available to watch streaming through joost, http://www.joost.com/ 
I thought this completely surreal show was gone for ever! Enjoy!"
,Tzaeru,2009-03-24T12:53Z,"Almost stalled now at 80% :?

Awesome series anyway! I felt so amazing shivers when watching the first episode again.. Last time I saw it was with the original running here in Finland some.. 10 years ago?

It's like.. Take the best of the actual sci-fi elements of Star Trek, Babylon 5 etc.. And cut all the unrealistic rule of rationalism, add some (realistic) violence, nudity, make it reflect REAL human mind in all it's bizarre filthyness.. And you have LEXX."
,Aidan13,2009-03-29T21:31Z,"Thw whole series downloaded fine for me...I am so stolked I get to watch this again!  What a weird show!
It took a couple of days to get but well worth it...took the time to seed as well
Thanks!"
,catgirlpink,2009-04-06T21:09Z,Aaarggh!  The 647mb copy of 1.04 Giga Shadow cuts off the Lexx's recap at the beginning!  :(  Does anyone have a full copy?
