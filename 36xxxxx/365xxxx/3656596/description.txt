The program LogonStudio (customizes the Windows XP logon) and some of my favorite skins. If you want you can also create your own inside this program, go to DeviantArt to get more logons.

If you need exact instructions for installing/uninstalling (or anything else) logons or the program. Or if you want to tell me something about one of my torrents, contact me as deadmanschest07@gmail.com.
