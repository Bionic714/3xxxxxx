I'd give you a Wikipedia link but his article was recently deleted as he's so non-notable.

However, I'm happy to see the video uploaded here as it means people can watch it without paying for it."

I just watched this entire series and I must say I was LMFAO the whole time. He does give bits of esoteric knowledge that are useful, but always mixes it in with christian doubletalk wank and typical disinformation. You have to watch it with heavy discernment and a sense of humor. This guy does MUCH better on the ""Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings"" series. 

Not recommended due to all his fantastic fictional concoctions. If someone were to take the 9 hours and cut out all the BS, you might be left with 1-3 hours of useful inside information about secret societies."
