,mealing,2007-10-21T15:44Z,"To run two copies of GW at once: http://www.guildwarsguru.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27103

To pre-decompress all maps (and files for that matter): Create a short-cut to gw.exe, go into properties of the shortcut and in the target box put ""-image"" (without the quote marks) at the end (with a space between the .exe location and ""-image"")

That way you don't have to download this shite."
