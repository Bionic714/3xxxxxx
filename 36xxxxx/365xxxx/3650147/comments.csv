SUBTiTLES fucked up their menu and it wasnt possible to get into
""scenes"" menu.
Their dvdstructure is also not the best. Some players has problems
playing their release because of their bad structure.
They should also learn how to use vobblanker!"

The first one was a low budget-film but it had a great script, the second was the other way around. And i'm pretty sure that the third one will be atleast as bad as the second."
