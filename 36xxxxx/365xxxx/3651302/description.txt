01. Thnks Fr Th Mmrs (Album Version)        3:23

Release Notes:

Produced By Babyface

This is the 2nd single released from Fall Out Boy's album "Infinity On High."
The title of the song intentionally omits all vowels, to imply it is written in
text language. One track promo, 600 dpi scans included. Too bad there wasn't a
B-Side for this :(.

I personally feel this is the 'Dance, Dance' of "Infinity On High," so if you
are going to get one single, this is it! The track has good vibe and everything.
Song is going to be huge.

I dedicate this to HTHS Of 2006; you guys truly made HS memorable.
