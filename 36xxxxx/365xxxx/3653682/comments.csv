CamStudio 2.0 to record your videotutoriales

For my big surprise, this program wants to live, and it turns out that a fastened so-called Nick the Geek has created a place for the discharge, information and update of this excellent program.
Briefly, CamStudio is Open Source, and it will allow you to record what happens on your screen to format AVI and SWF (flash), including audio (voice) and/or messages of text on screen. You have the possibility of specifying the resolution of the apprehension (to record alone report of the screen), the quantity of images per second, the type of cursor to use, etc.
The best thing of everything is that also there is available an excellent codec of compression called CSCD (CamStudio Lossless Codec v1.0), which is very similar to the TSCC used by the program Camtasia Studio. Is the quality practically the same one of the original one, but the tama? or resultant of the video is it much sin? or. The best thing of everything is that this codec is Open Source!
It notices: CamStudio was originalment"
