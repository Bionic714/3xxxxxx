,nUDiE<3,2007-06-02T23:05Z,"Thanks, just what I needed :))"
,moracca,2007-06-21T04:03Z,"try right clicking, and going to merge"
,moracca,2007-06-21T04:07Z,Ps thank you for not putting a virus in this
,enrique25493,2007-09-23T18:50Z,It works great! Scanned with Windows LiveOne Care and no virus/malicious software detected.
,Morph1234,2007-09-26T03:43Z,"The Registry File ""Crack"" contained in this download will allow you to unlock the latest version of this software (Currently 3.11). You would simply download the demo version from the site who created the software and simply double click the registry file. The registry file is harmless (I checked), it simply adds the values to the registry that tells the program it is registered. I am not sure if there is much difference betweem 3.10 and 3.11, but just thought I would mention this if someone wants the latest version. (Thanks for adding this torrent!) Cheers. :-)"
,Morph1234,2007-09-26T03:46Z,"If anyone has trouble getting the registry file to work, simply right click the "".reg"" file and click ""Open With"" then choose ""Registry Editor"". It will then ask for permission to add to the registry. "
,nedthepig,2007-12-02T09:24Z,"Shit son, you're getting a what? An iPod? Damn, sorry to hear that. Be sure to get the extended warranty."
,MegaGibbous5000,2008-01-21T16:01Z,Thank you. This is freaking awesome =D
,ektakrome,2008-02-03T06:18Z,did what morph said and it is working just fine.
,superbad1,2008-02-05T14:16Z,"works fine, but when I launch the program, the interface is all chopped up and I can't move the window around. I can just barely touch the ""X"" to close the program. anyone else seeing this?"
,superbad1,2008-02-05T14:19Z,"seems like I fixed it: run this whole thing here and then download version 3.11 from the program's website, install over the 3.10 from this torrent, and you should be fine."
,xterminatorr,2008-02-16T14:28Z,"Dont use that registry thing. I used it and i couldnt acces maps, ive been looking to find the problem and then i found out it was this reg thing. I removed it and my pc worked fine again."
[T],Heersare,2008-02-23T17:47Z,"I did the Registry thing, Pressed yes and then okay.. I still get the 

'This software can only try 15 days
Please registration' 

And it really has that broken english lol So what i do..?"
,vojax,2008-02-25T21:24Z,"Worked like a charm, with 3.11. Thanx hedkandi & morph."
