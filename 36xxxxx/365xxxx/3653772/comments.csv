,smokie76,2007-04-03T10:37Z,sooo u gonna seed this anytime soon or what??
,Sarre,2007-04-06T21:06Z,Gotta be the slowest seeder I've ever witnessed. I've seeded 3x01 and 3x10 to the swarm because I happened to have those two eps. lying around. Really only missing 3x09.
,Aircraft800,2007-04-07T23:34Z,Help please! Need seeders. 
,Aircraft800,2007-04-11T23:51Z,"Mine stopped at 90%

I repacked it and upped it here:

,DevilEST,2007-04-12T11:08Z,"The torrent is fine, it might have stopped at 90 for you because the initial seeder was slowish for a few days heh."
,Aircraft800,2007-04-12T14:34Z,"Hey Thanks DevilEST! It finished and there is now seeders. I Seed for a few also.

Thanks again for the up!"
