                               Game Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the heart of Star Trek Armada II are the most exciting elements from the Star Trek episodes and movies: leading fleets of starships into combat, exploring new planetary systems throughout the Alpha and Delta Quadrants, and carefully treading the delicate balance between peace and war among six different races. 

In 30 missions divided into three campaigns, the player experiences the excitement of the story unfolding from the perspective of the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire, and the Borg Collective. Commanding the ships and infrastructure of these very different races, the player is able to feel the excitement of exploring new sectors of space with the Federation as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the thrill of conquering worlds and crushing enemies as the Klingon Chancellor Martok, and the cold efficiency of assimilating worlds and vessels as the Borg Queen. As the commander of an armada, the player must make choices that will affect thousands of lives and the future of the galaxy.
