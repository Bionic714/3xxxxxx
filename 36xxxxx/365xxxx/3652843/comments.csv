,Iceman06,2007-04-04T20:12Z,"Can someone upload the extras-files here?

You need to log on to that 'titaniumtorrents' site :-("
,crochetmansf,2007-04-05T04:51Z," And what would be bad about that?
 I did it this way to let people know of this site that Leechers (hit and run) are not welcome.
 I do some work hunting down No CD cracks, patches (in this case it took me over an hour to find) etc. I do not do this for Leechers, I do it to share.
 So spend a few minutes, register with the site and get the Extras yourself ---. unless you are a Leecher yourself.
 Enjoy the game and seed."
,Iceman06,2007-04-07T19:04Z,"Well, I'm definatly no Leecher. I'm seeding everything I download for at least 3-4 weeks.

but If I should register for evry other site i come across...  :-(

If you can't share, what is need e to be able to play the game don't bother upload it in the first place!"
,crochetmansf,2007-04-12T16:53Z," I would not upload a game or prog that you cannot use. Trust me, I don't like being a hard ass.
 I'm sorry if you feel that I am being unfair, it's just that I feel it more unfair for leechers to benefit from other peoples work. You will note that the game does indeed works without the extras, it's just a little bit easier with them."
,lfh32,2007-04-14T23:37Z,hi hope you can help when i open the file i get a mdf file and a mds file dont know what to do tried mounting the mdf file and then try installing but nothing happens please please help thanks lfh32
,crimsonorion,2007-04-18T18:18Z,"I try installing, but get a
""Error occured during data move process -106""
error message, then the file that the error occured with.  Its different each time.  Any ideas on how to stop this?  Thanks!"
,sbeaber,2007-05-02T18:44Z,I need some help I can recognize mdf files..Im a noob
,kailador,2007-05-05T09:29Z,"I registered on Titanium Torrents to get the NoCD Crack, but I don't know where to go from there. The addresses you posted just give me a page that says ""Bad ID."" Can you help me out?"
,Paragon19,2007-06-02T19:55Z,"I'm registered on Titanium Torrents, and I'm seeding, but I can't get those files, your link doesn't work."
,newfie774,2007-06-26T00:24Z,ummmm i need some help...i'm new to downloading torrents and i have no i dea what i am doing...i downloaded star trek armada and i ended up with 3 files...but i dont no what i have to do to them to make the game work
,edea20,2007-07-30T03:24Z,Can't wait to play this.
,edea20,2007-07-30T19:24Z,What version is this 1.0 or 1.1?
,Tekspdy,2007-09-12T08:05Z,"I will be seeding for the next 2 days.  I will set my torrent to make use of my 12meg connection at night.  (Low bandwidth seeding during the day, High bandwidth seeding from 3am-12pm PST)"
,jauger,2007-10-14T17:23Z,"Hey there, just wondering, since i'm new at this whole sharing thing, what is a decent amount of time to seed after you've downloaded something. Does leeching mean someone who downloads without seeding, and is there anything else etiquette 
wise that I should know so i'm not of of the 'bad guys'."
,lefty0024,2007-10-18T07:45Z,"Here is a link to a free DL (no registration required) for the no cd crack. works just fine with this dl as I've done it myself...enjoy.

,loymo,2007-10-19T13:25Z,lefty0024 u sweet arsed bitch thanks a bunch matey works great now
,BrittonBurton,2007-11-12T04:53Z,"I will help seed it when I can, however I have 8 other torrents already being seeded so don't expect tons of speed from me. 

Can't wait to play the second one!!"
,BrittonBurton,2007-11-12T05:09Z,"MDS files are CD images, you need a virtual drive like alcohol or daemon tools to mount them in order to see whats on the cd or you can burn them to an actual cd. Some software has built in emulation detection so that makes it useless to rip a cd in this manner. I am not sure what the case is with the particular torrent but I am sure I will find out once its done. I sure hope I don't run in to a ""CD key required"" or some patch that is necessary. Based on the comments it appears a patch is in order to make this copy work. Damn it your supposed to put that in the package, but no matter I will sign up for the site that the comments seem to direct me to and hope I find what I need."
,BrittonBurton,2007-11-12T08:15Z,"It works fine on my computer with no additional patches or keys of any kind. I just used Dameon Tools virtual drive and installed the game after I finished downloading it. Watched the intro and I have to say it looks like like its going to be way more fun than the first edition. For now I will seed it though because I don't have time to set down for an all out assault on the borg collective and their ""new"" weapon. :)"
,zedman46,2007-11-21T01:50Z,"thanks for the upload, seems like a fun game, i will be seeding for as long as it takes,after all thats what its all about;) cheers to britton burton for the info on daemon ... nice one ...."
,xgamerx,2008-01-18T16:57Z,"When I mount the .mds file nothing happens, I would br grateful for any help i can get 

Thanks :)"
,tilendo,2008-02-04T22:38Z,Hey crochermansf i press install but nothing happens :(
,JediWP81,2008-02-18T07:13Z,"I don't use this service as much as I would like, but all of these forward registration requirements smack of data base building for what puropse? is unknown.  If I want other poeple to know my business, I would advertize in the newpaper.  It is not about how much time it takes to upload or research. It about free use of what we have purchased ourselves"
,airsoftmanic,2008-05-24T13:03Z,"thank you for this, ill upload for around a week starting from today but theres only 1-3 people wanting it so i can max my upload speed out for you lucky bunch of people.
@lefty0024
nice stuff, works perfect."
,Blue_shift,2008-07-01T04:06Z,Fantastic! I have been looking for the full version for quite a while now. Thanks a million!
,inAcrysis,2008-10-24T18:31Z,"The 1.1 patch & the no-cd crack are both available at

,alabarious,2008-12-05T00:05Z,ok i downloaded it but it says i cant open NFO file.  how do i open the file?
,killercan555,2008-12-23T18:15Z,"Ok so it finally finishes downloading and i open up the folder.  There is an MSI info document, a MDF and a MDS file.  Neither of these second two are recognised. Tried opening one and it couldn't find a program to run it on."
,FreeHansje,2009-01-31T12:20Z,"So, how does this run under WXP? I have installed it and get the splash screen, which disappears after a few seconds, that's it. There is some disk activity, but no recognizable process running. I have set compatibility of the .EXE to W95 AND tried W98, W2000, nada, zilch. There is no log to be found, nothing in EventViewer.
Any1?"

,termite43,2010-10-08T18:12Z,"Doesn't work at all - period, on Windows 7 x64.  Nor does Armada 1.  Getting a 'Not enough memory - needs 50 mB' error.  I have 8GB RAM.  Tried every compatability mode as well as running it inside D3D Windower.  Sometimes these old games work, and sometimes they don't.  Armada 1 - 2 don't."

,Omega2112,2011-02-01T03:38Z,"Crochetmansf, 

First of all, thanks for uploading this, i loved the Demo and, well, you saved me a tenner :P 

Second, i need your help, and apparently so do a few others. 

When i mount the program, i go to the main menu, click install, Demoshield logo comes on .... then nothing, no install, nothing. 

And i dont have a bloody clue how to add a CD Crack to a Mounted MDS File, so please, shower us with your wisdom ;)"
,black9150,2011-07-29T14:43Z,"To get this working on windows 7 x64 do and online do the following

1) mount and install 
2 patch to 1.1 http://www.fleetops.net/download/startdown/24/
3) unofficial patch http://www.fleetops.net/download/startdown/15/
4) Install fleet ops

6)download and install tunngle

,wtftpb,2012-01-31T22:31Z,the reason you have ie windows popping open is because you have spyware from those gay porn sites you visit...try fucking spybot and use firefox you newfag...also KMPlayer and SRS audiosandbox

,wtftpb,2012-02-01T05:14Z,fuck...i am stumped..maybe I can figure it out tomorrow...it wasn't this hard when I downloaded it 1 year ago
,daeloki,2012-03-28T00:11Z,"Okay, for all those with windows 7 64bit, here is how you get it to work without modding or downloading custom files, just right click on the icon and click on properties, and turn on Compatibility mode, and choose Windows XP Service Pack 2.

There now it works, this is what I did with my Windows 7 64 Bit Home Premium, and it plays perfectly."
,-Distance,2012-06-28T21:22Z,with these old games i always see comments of people having problems installing and such.. i never have any so idk what it is .. Worked fine for me Win XP sp3
,PPierce34,2012-07-06T19:32Z,"That's because you use an outdated operating system. Most people today are running Windows 7. The further away you get from the OS a game was developed for, the more problems you have installing it."
