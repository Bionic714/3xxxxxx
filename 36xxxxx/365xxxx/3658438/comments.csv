Hope you enjoy it! And please keep it alive."

,ptolerantanus,2007-11-09T01:20Z,"If it's not working then you're most likely not doing it correctly. Go here: www.i-doser.com
Go to the forums and read how to make it work 100% of the time."

,scriptX,2008-08-24T02:54Z,These doses are unplayable. Error 75 with I-Doser 4.50
,scriptX,2008-08-24T03:01Z,"Forgive me for voting this one down; I should have done research before judging so quickly.

This error can be fixed by selecting all the doses (.drg files), right clicking, ""Properties"", make sure ""Read-Only"" is UNCHECKED (NOT checked)

Again, sorry."
