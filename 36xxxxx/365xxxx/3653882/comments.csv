,zandelu,2007-07-29T22:51Z,"unfortunately, yes. it is very difficult (almost impossible) to find all the episodes unedited. if only mtv would put out a dvd or something..."

,nyiddle,2008-09-23T12:26Z,"if you're having trouble with the right codecs and stuff for these files, download the K-Lite Codec Pack (just google it). It includes everything you'll need to play these files.

I remember when I first got em only the sound would play and I was so pissed I wasted like 3 days downloading 12gb's of what i thought would be awesome. after like 2 weeks someone was like ""yeah your codecs probably aren't right"" and pointed me in the right direction.

great torrent, thanks for upping."

,sho666,2009-09-23T10:17Z,seed please im downloading so slowly
,LMB222,2009-11-01T10:10Z,"THIS IS BAD!

The quality is horrible. For 20 minutes of an episode the files are ca. 100MB (normally 180-250MB), so the color is off, and the image is bad. Some episodes are in MPEG, which is even worse. 

So don't download unless there's nothing else. "
,irvine.d,2009-11-19T02:29Z,"As a matter of fact there's nothing else, but I read on wikipedia that:
 ""In July 2009, TVShowsOnDVD.com announced that a DVD release for the series is planned for 2010"""
,MayarO,2010-01-24T13:40Z,"My friend downloaded this for me last year, all but ""Fizz Ed"" plays on my Phillips DivX player, all play with k-lite, miss this show like crazy, awaiting the DVD release, wonder how long it'll take for the bona-fide DVD rip(s) to show up here ;)

When it does, I'll lock in my seed when I'm online!"
,ntksec,2010-04-25T17:04Z,"This is for everyone that have issues about media files being played. Use VLC  media player - Open Source Multimedia Framework and Player. It is the best media player out there. It will play all kinds of files (even flash). It is also FREE! 

I hope this help anyone out there.

,forkman33,2010-09-28T08:53Z,Fucking great show. Good torrent.
,bloodmonkey87,2011-03-09T15:30Z,"MTV were too cheap to pay copyrights for the music on the soundtrack. That's why there hasn't been a DVD release.

The VHS releases and the future DVD release have been edited and don't contain the original soundtrack. Which sucks a bit but Daria is still awesome anyway.

This isn't the highest quality but it's the most comprehensive Daria torrent out.

Screw MTV... They killed the best decade.

Peace."
,SLiP2010,2011-07-05T12:11Z,"This series was way ahead of its time. Instant classic sarcasm. 

Anyone having trouble playing this should get VLC Media Player, its free. Apparently K-Lite is also another great free player, but I've never run into anything I couldn't play with VLC. 

Thanks for the up!"
,wordofsteve,2011-07-31T23:24Z,I use realplayer and this download works perfectly!!!! Thanks!!!!!!
,arsefacey,2011-10-09T15:08Z,"http://www.outpost-daria.com/daria_on_dvd.html
Full, unedited (except for ""Is It College Yet?""), if anyone wants to rip that and make it a torrent."
,Fendergirl,2012-05-29T14:06Z,thank you and all seeders! ;)
,wtfxpaigerz,2012-08-19T19:43Z,"This is some bad quality, man.. Most all are very pixelated Noggin edits. Would NOT recommend this torrent, as there are full DVD rips out there.
