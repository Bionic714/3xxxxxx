,Sukkanaama,2008-01-31T18:30Z,"What do you do with ""95 hard disk.vhd"" -file???"
,dacoach,2008-02-11T04:32Z,".vhd = virtual hard drive.  Use it with MS Virtual PC.  Its a simulated hard drive.  Having one ready made saves you time configuring one yourself.  Use Virtual PC on your existing Win XP box and run several windows OS at once.  Remember to have at least 2GB RAM, and several GB of hard drive space available to store your virtual hard drives.

Go to microsoft.com for a free download of Virtual PC.

Thanx for the download....will seed!"
