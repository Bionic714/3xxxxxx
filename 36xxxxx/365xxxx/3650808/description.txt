Overview:	Set in the days of the Ming Dynasty, Invincible Armour sees Hwang Jang Lee (Hitman In The Hand Of Buddha) play a ruthless court official who, for his own advancement, frames John Liu for murder. Liu is intent on exposing the real killer and clearing his own name. Being a master of Ying Jow Pai (Eagle Claw) and the coveted Iron Armour technique, Hwang regards himself as an unbeatable foe. Finally, Tino Wong and John Liu battle Hwang in one of the most imaginatively ruthless end fights in martial arts movie history.

Everything about Invincible Armour is first class, from great production values and cinematography to the enthralling spaghetti western soundtrack. The formidable Ng See Yuen holds the helm while stuntmen and fight choreographers of the caliber of Yuen Wai, Yuen Biao, and Yuen Shun Yi shape the splendid action.
