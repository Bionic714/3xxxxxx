,ektakrome,2007-05-20T20:49Z,"Is anyone going to see this baby. I can see there are at least 4 people that have 99.6% done. But they can only help so much. We need someone with the whole thing.

Big thanks to all those people seeding it. Please keep doing so."
,Raging_Bull,2007-07-18T13:35Z,"Can somebody please seed Subspecies 2? I'm downloading for more then a week now and I'm still stuck on 99,8%. I'm seeding Subspecies + Subspecies 3. Thanks!"
,ari.man,2007-08-05T10:55Z,"Any1 seeding this? Mistä voi suomessa ostaa tän boksin, vai pitääkö tilata Fullmoon:lta?"
,ari.man,2007-08-23T17:17Z,"Siementäkää hyvät ihmiset tämän kokoista filua!

Seed people Seed! Stuck 99.8%"
,Cyberfart,2007-08-24T16:15Z,I was stuck at 99.8% too. Very frustrating. Is there anyone who has the complete movie? Please reseed it and earn our eternal gratitude :-).

,PeterJayNovins,2008-03-17T04:48Z,Any chance anyone could reseed this?  I love Full Moon stuff.
,Grayson,2008-04-27T00:43Z,"After the VHS and the Laserdics and owning Subspecies 4 and the Vampire Journals on DVD I hate to get a boxset with these 2 available single dvd's in it. Until these (1,2,3) come out by themselves... SOMEBODY SEED... Thank you"
,TheMonkofDestiny,2008-05-11T23:02Z,Doesn't look like this has a complete seed. Disappointing.
,Raging_Bull63,2008-07-05T21:02Z,"It's a waste of time trying to download this torrent, the same with Subspecies 4. No one is seeding those torrents.
I'd been stuck at 99,8% for months. Finaly downloaded an other torrent with both Subspecies 2 and 4 (AVI-files).
This is the link: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3842899/Subspecies_2__amp__4"
,Raging_Bull63,2008-07-05T21:16Z,"I've forgotten to mention that I'm seeding all the Subspecies movies since March 2008 (when I'm downloading torrents). It's better than nothing for these hard-to-get movies.
Subspecies 1: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3657788/The_Horror_Collection___Subspecies
Subspecies 2 and 4 (AVI-files): http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3842899/Subspecies_2__amp__4

,techken,2008-11-27T19:57Z,Could someone PLEASE seed this?  There are a whole bunch of us stuck at 99.7%.  There has GOT to be someone out there with the dvdr version of this movie!
