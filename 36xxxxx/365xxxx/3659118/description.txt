                      40th anniversary celebration


The Bonzo Dog Band enjoys a unique place in the history of British popular 
music which has never been equalled. The Bonzos were a Dada inspired musical 
comedy group, which rose to fame in the sixties and is still loved by legions 
of music fans today. the Bonzos blended music, comedy, vaudeville and 
surrealism all tinged with eccentric reflections of twenties, the Edwardian 
world and the last echoes from cool Britannia's days of empire.

The year 2006 marks the 40th anniversary of the release of 'My Brother Makes
The Noises For the Talkies', the first record by The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.

On January 28th 2006 The Astoria theatre in London hosted a very special
evening celebrating the music and achievments of the legendary Bonzo Dog Doo
Dah Band. For this unique occasion Musical Director Neil Innes was joined live
on stage by former band mates Rodney Slater, Roger Ruskin Spear, 'Legs' Larry 
Smith, Sam Spoons, Vernon Dudley Bohay Nowell, Bob Kerr and red hot house
orchestra featuring Tom Fry, JJ Jones, Andy Roberts and Mickey Simmonds.

The part of the late great and sorely missed Vivian Stanshall was performed
variously by Messrs Stephen Fry, Adrian Edmondson, Phill Jupitus and Paul
Merton.

For the first time since the group broke up in the early seventies a British
stage once again resounded to the inspired flights of lunacy of the Bonzos
favourites performed live and the world was suddenly a sunnier place.
