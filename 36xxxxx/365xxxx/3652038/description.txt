The Eurofighter Typhoon Package v1.1RV (EFTP v1.1RV). The EFTP v1.1RV is a free mod for Falcon 4.0 with the Red Viper 1 Package (v. 1.0.0.2). The EFTP v1.1RV is fully compatible with the latest RV 1.0.0.4 too. Though RV1 is not fully developed yet, the recently released late beta seems already to be very mature. The EFTP modifies the Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft, some of its associated weapon systems, the eurowar campaign and adds some new weapons as well. The EFTP improves the in simulation experience and the realism when flying the Eurofighter Typhoon.
