,batman_b3gan1976,2007-04-11T06:25Z,a cam means a camera was used to shoot the film 
,Semi_Dead,2007-04-11T06:50Z,"^^ haha D335tO, didn't you know what a cam is. lol

j/k of course. lots of real dumb people here"
,ITCHY BLANKET,2007-04-12T04:29Z,What are the other ways of getting the film besides using a camera to shoot it?
,ITCHY BLANKET,2007-04-12T04:43Z,"And is there any software i can get off of here that will burn rip my dvds and keep the quality perfect as well as keep the menus and that will also keep it in ntsc format?

Thank you"
,ITCHY BLANKET,2007-04-12T23:52Z,"But anyways 
What other method besides using a camera is there to get the films?"
,avalonic,2007-05-13T14:20Z,When the source is a cam it means someone went to a cinema to tape the film with a camera. This makes the quality quite shitty most of the times. Another source for a release on this site is a dvdrip. This simple information could also be found on numerous other sites itchy blanket.
