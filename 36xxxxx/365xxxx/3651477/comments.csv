,ThWar,2007-04-01T05:51Z,"If anyone has any Ideas about how i can SPeeD UP this Torrent, PLZ Let Me know!
Cuz, I Capped my Upload Speed @ 87K, which seems to be optimal, then i Capped the UL Speed of this Torrent @ 85K, However The Fastest I've seen it UL @ is Around 8K. Now i do have about 40 Other Torrents going . . .

However, I CApped all other Torrents @ 1K MaX UL.  And for some reason, my Total UL Speed is only about 44k . . .
So, HOW CAN I MAKE THIS ONE GO SUPPERFAST!?
I'm using the latest Version of uTorrent, and it's set for Highest Priority, and Initial-Seeding and all that!... "
,ThWar,2007-04-02T06:25Z,"Well I see from about 25 to 50 LeeCHeRz, but not 2 Many Comments...

The Availability for this torrent seems pretty good @ 1.906 atm, Considering that the most anyone got so far is about 91.7% . . .
and the Ratio is not too shabby @ 1.089, which compared to most other torrents, is pretty DaMN GReaT!

Hopefully, as soon as YOU guyz get a chance to test Drive these Lessons, YOU Will post some ReVieWz & Comments on Quality & Such... (However @ 192kbps, the audio should be Fairly Excelent). ;-O

,radio_cat,2008-08-30T00:51Z,I want to read a passage in public which contains Italian accent and American accent for the characters.  I hope this will help me fake an Italian accent.  The text is in English; Hemingway.
