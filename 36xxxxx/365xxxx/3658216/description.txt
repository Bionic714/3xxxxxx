-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Kiwi drama, The Hothouse follows the complicated lives of five 
20-somethings who share a run down inner-city Wellington dwelling.

From the creators of the award-winning series The Insiders Guide To Happiness 
and The Insiders Guide To Love, The Hothouse is a contemporary drama with 
moments of black humour, that explores themes of loyalty, morality, 
friendship and, of course, love.

Cops Daniel, Ruth and Neru, and lawyer Isobel are long-term flatmates. When 
Levi Wise, a charming rogue who's secretly on the wrong side of the law, 
joins the house, the delicate balance of the flat is upset in one swoop. The 
black and white line between right and wrong becomes increasingly blurred 
with shades of grey, as the 'upholders of the law' struggle with their 
inextricably entwined professional dilemmas and personal lives.

Award-winning writer David Brechin-Smith says the series has three main 
themes - loyalty, morality and transition. "Loyalty to your friends, to 
yourself and to your partner. The show explores how these different loyalties 
are often in conflict.

"We all have a line between right and wrong. We're usually on the 'right' 
side of the line, but sometimes we cross the line. Of the five main 
characters, three are cops. What happens when someone who upholds the law 
commits a terrible crime and realises they might get away with it? How do you 
reconcile being both a good guy and a bad guy?"

He says the series has a good balance of dramatic elements. "It's funny, sad, 
poignant, uplifting, surprising. We even have some action sequences! And many 
moments of black humour."

The cast includes Ryan O'Kane, who won Best Actor at the 2006 Qantas 
Television Awards.
