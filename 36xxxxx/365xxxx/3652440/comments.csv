,byjj43,2008-05-04T08:20Z,"I will happily help to reseed this if I can just get the whole file. My IP address is 24.36.162.146 (192.168.0.100) so please allow me to finish my download, thanks. Byjj43"

,singcobb,2008-07-21T10:13Z,I am nearly finished downloading this and if it completes I'll leave it up for a few months on unlimited upload speed as there are so few seeders.
,byjj43,2008-07-23T01:27Z,"Thanks Singcobb, I have tried to download this torrent 5 times and the original seeder must have bugged out which I find very frustrating. If you get it all let me know and I will download it and seed it until we get more seeders this time."

,Torino_forever,2009-01-02T05:57Z,"Can everyone who is downloading upload at least 10kbs? There was 3 seeders, one stopped and now there's only two and 1 disappeared... I'm averaging 3 to 15kbs downloading. I just hope it doesn't fail at the end.  "
,Torino_forever,2009-01-03T02:26Z,"I couldn't open the ISO file at first and even after I installed ISObuster, I can't get the game to install. I have the XP installer, but now it won't even open the installation path. It won't even let me try to install it now:("
,Rukishou,2009-02-01T09:04Z,"I remember this game from when I was a little kid; however, I think it was my six year older brother who played and I just watched. I remembed an uncomfortable, eerie feeling as he was walking outside the house in the rain and remember being stressed when the baby is being kidnapped (is there a time limit to follow the man or something here? I don't remember). As I remember this game it was a horror game, but that might be because I was a kid and don't remember it exactly... Anyway, gonna be fun to play it again! :D

Please seed. :)"

,Blackcat123,2010-02-11T20:23Z,"Incidently, these iso's, or whatever, work about as good as my english. The first CD, when I tried to un rar' it, just turned into a perpetual unpack or something. it started spitten out chinese glyphs, or swaheli or something about an Inn. "
,Blackcat123,2010-02-12T15:04Z,"Cannon Fodder! Anyone have a version of this that actually works? I just burned one from a download, and it'sa don""ta work?#@"
,smknjoker,2011-07-29T23:48Z,I remember playing this on my old P.O.S. comp back in the day even thogh I had a PS2 sittin right across the room.
,smknjoker,2011-07-30T02:21Z,"Ok the game installed fine for me. I used Daemon Tools Lght to mount the .Iso file, went to the mounted Is in my comp. and ran Autorun.exe. But for some reason even though it installed properly the game wouldnot start. I have Windows XP and I tried running the game Wcompatibility mode "
,smknjoker,2011-07-30T02:23Z,"Whoops hit enter before I was done. Anyways in order for me to get th game to run I found a installer for XP and after that it works fine.
