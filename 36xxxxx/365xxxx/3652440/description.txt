The main character is a writer who recently moved to the Oregon Coast, and was subsequently befriended by a local scientist named Jeremiah Krick and his baby daughter Amanda. Krick was studying dimensional anomalies and managed to build a machine that crosses dimensions into the tower of his lighthouse. After using it he encounters a weird, tattooed man-creature and studies it for a while. He later learns that it is called the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dark Being\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and it is absolute evil. Krick is sceptical at first, until he learns that that Dark Being has somehow copied his dimensional travel device and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s after him and his daughter. Finding this out, Krick resolves to confront the Dark Being but not before calling the main character and imploring her to watch his daughter and make sure nothing bad happens to her. The main character finds out just what Krick was up to just in time for the Dark Being to appear in the baby\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s room and kidnap her. Now the main character is to pursue the Dark Being in a bizarre, arcane, steampunkish world to save Amanda and Jeremiah Krick, and defeat the Dark Being once and for all.
