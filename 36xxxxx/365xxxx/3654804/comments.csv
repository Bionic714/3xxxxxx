,Loki_DK,2007-04-12T10:09Z,when is episode 22 going to be on here m8?
,loobielou1,2007-07-31T22:01Z,"Hi Deathmule/Everyone, I hope you can help me!

Am new to downloading and uploading!

I have downloaded some episodes of season 2 of prison break (from deathmule).

When I try to play them a box pops up and tells me that the downloads are in a VOB format which cannot be run by the computer.

I had hoped to burn these onto a DVD to watch on TV, but the file format is not recognised by Nero or by Azeurus as a playable format.

I have downloaded codec lite and rebooted but this has not helped at all.

What have I done wrong?

Thank you :O)"
,loobielou1,2007-07-31T22:02Z,And once I know how to do that then maybe someone could help me learn how to upload too? Thanks :O)
