,trixiehobbit,2007-04-13T08:37Z,"Beautiful work bsdman64. 
And in FLAC as it always should be!
If people want other formats, let them reencode the songs by themself. 
And the files are NOT rar(ed), but that's what you meant, I guess :-)
Thx 4 ul."
,fmouse,2007-04-17T15:17Z,Thanks! Long live FLAC.
,cypherpunk2,2007-07-28T13:32Z,"FLAC, of corse, why would anyone want anything less.  Ogg?  Ugh!

,bradwjensen,2007-09-03T13:23Z,"Yeah, though i'm not downloading this.. I honestly think people should just rip cd's they upload to .iso or .nrg so we can burn them and have the full actual thing bit for bit able to be recognized by iTunes .etc and ripped to any quality."
,g8aso,2008-01-31T09:15Z,"If you want it in mp3, use Winamp to convert it to .wav, then convert to mp3...............easy"
,KrazyKaos,2008-02-29T14:49Z,FLAC is awesome. Thanks for the great torrent! Will happily seed at least 1:1
