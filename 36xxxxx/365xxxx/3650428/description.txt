Another great performance from the effortlessly charismatic Leung Kar-Yan, with some nice fights, and creative direction.

Plot:	Pu-Fun is a hit man for a power-mad Eunuch, sent out every day to assassinate "betrayers". But at the urging of his wife--and with inspiration from his young son--he starts to question his occupation, realizing he must end the Eunuch's reign of terror.

Overview:	Leung Kar Yan delivers an awesome display of screen presence and martial arts prowess in "Secret Service Of The Imperial Court", where he plays secret service agent Chao Pu-Fun, who must rise up above the odds to protect the innocent against a power-mad Eunuch (Lau Wing). It's balls to the wall action. Lau is best remembered for his first two roles, co-starring with Bruce Lee in "The Big Boss" and "Fists Of Fury".
