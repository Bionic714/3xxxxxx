,simandk,2007-04-03T16:38Z,someone knows what it's recorded in?
,JNSSWE,2007-04-03T16:41Z,Thanks :)
,Daffmeister,2007-04-03T17:16Z,"You guys who has playback problems need to download either VLC or MPC media player and a codec pack instead of buuuhuuuing.
Try to install CoreAVC for a playback boost if you're in front of a yesterday's computer and use it with MPC (Media Player Classic).
And this is the last episode in S2."
,chainsaw_killer,2007-04-03T17:49Z,"answer to: simandk

It is probably because it is recorded in 5.1 dolby surround. When that happens it usall that you have that problem if you only have a 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 sound system. But if you use VLC you can check under the ""sound""-list and there you have a couple of alternatives to use. choose Mono or stereo. now it should work. 

And to all you who dont understands what this is. dont bother downloading it then and download the right codecs before you start blaming CTU whos doing an excelent job.
Thank you for this torrent guys!"

,Matt_F,2007-04-03T22:01Z,This is bullshit. I cant even play it... the video is gone. And I cant find a damn codec for it. For  Vista
,schweinkopf,2007-04-04T18:28Z,"To make thw video smooth you can`t do anything with harddrive....it make it out of sync
Just play the series and do nothing else with the pc"
