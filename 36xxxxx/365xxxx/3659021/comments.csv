,Shylock,2007-04-09T10:54Z,"Each cartoon shows one or more white rabbits in their creative attempts to end their lives using a variety of items. Revolving doors, a toaster, a cricket ball, a boomerang, a hand-grenade, the shining sun, a magnifying glass, lots of smoking cigarettes and bowling balls are all featured as suicidal tools. The book also features a few cultural references, most notably a parody of a scene from The Wicker Man, where the rabbit is atop the burning figure.

The cartoons are often drawn in such a way that the bunny's exact method is not immediately obvious, leaving the reader to work out exactly how the bunnies plan to end their lives.

In 2004 a sequel was published, under the title Return of the Bunny Suicides

The book proved so popular that pirate scans started to circulate heavily online as ""Bunnies Suicide"" or ""Bunny Suicide"", facilitating DMCA notices of cease and desist [1]. Cartoonist Liu Gang was inspired by the book to create his Suicide Rabbit."
