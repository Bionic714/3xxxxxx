Release Notes.
==========================================================================

Woah! Jezper SÃ¶derlund does it again! This is his second release on
Intuition and he definately maintains the labels good reputation as well
as showing he is still capable of making beautiful music.
The title track is a great example of good trance following the book,
absolutely wonderful!
Rest In Peace and Medusa which have the more typical Airbase sound do
not disappoint either!

P.S.: This is (like a few previous releases) a CDR.
But "aparantly" only small labels and artists use that format.
So in fear of getting nuked we tag it as CDS :)
