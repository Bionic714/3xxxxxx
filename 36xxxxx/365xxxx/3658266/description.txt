Synopsis

Claus and Lavie deliver Alvis to airship the Silvana´s captain, Alex Row. But much to Claus´ anger, Alex Row accepts Alvis inhumanely into the Silvana and leaves the duo and their damaged ship behind. Claus and Lavie fly to the Silvana to retrieve Alvis, but the airship is savagely attacked by Guild-controlled star-shaped vessels. Claus and Lavie are forced to take on the attackers on a borrowed Silvana vanship. The Silvana is severely damaged. Dio Eraclea of the Guild flagship notices Claus´ unusual flying talents, and vows to have a duel with him. More than ever, Claus and Lavie realize they are wrapped up in the mysterious conspiracies of war controlled by the omnipotent Guild..
