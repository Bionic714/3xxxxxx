Best Antivirus made into a portable
No installation required
Used only for scanning files

Works for Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista

The other version has a huge bug in it which is fixed in this version.
This portable is an on-demand scanner only, which can be run manually on specific files or disk segments. It can also be scheduled to run during off-peak times.

You can not use for it AMON, DMON, EMON and IMON.

You need to have an internet connection in order to download the updates.

Created with thinstall, which I've recently found out has huge limitations.  It pretty much handicaps any program that requires device drivers.
The other version will find viruses but will be unable to remove them.
I fixed that problem in this version.  However i don't think this AV will be able to remove viruses located in the memory.  It can find them but u would have to manually get rid of them.  To be safe always scan files first before running them.
