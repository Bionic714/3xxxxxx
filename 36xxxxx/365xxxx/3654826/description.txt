The James Taylor Quartet are a British four-piece jazz funk band who have become renowned for their live performances. They were formed by Hammond organ player James Taylor following the break-up of his former band The Prisoners in the wake of Stiff Records' bankruptcy. The core line-up is James Taylor (Hammond organ), Nigel Price (guitar), Gary Crockett (bass) and Neil Robinson (drums) though recordings and live performances usually feature a horn section comprising John Willmott (tenor sax/flute) and Nick Smart (trumpet) and also vocalist Yvonne Yanney.
