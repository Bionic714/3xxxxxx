,YeArr,2007-07-12T23:24Z,"The content in this torrent is corrupted. Even the album art doesnt work
I tried using the mp3's on many different players to no avail (iTunes, WMP 11, nero 7, DivX..)

waste of time ... and theres too many copies of this torrent out there, lets phase it out please"
,YeArr,2007-07-13T00:16Z,"..and to add insult to injury I opened a few of the MP3 files in windows Notepad and they WERE EMPTY!!! 

no content inside ANY of these files whatsoever! WTF is this? who is so petty to try allow high speed downloads of a collection this big just to take up HDD space??

kazuhiko congratulations for winning the asshole of my day award. If you were on my ship I would throw you off the plank"
,HoodythePirate,2008-04-06T20:01Z,As soon as I get this I'll seed for a while.
