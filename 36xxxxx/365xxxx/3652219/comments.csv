,kristine0307,2007-12-27T19:45Z,does this one work????????
,kaghanyou,2008-04-13T20:26Z,Yes this works but I had to burn it to a cd first then install from that.
,u-tuber,2008-05-15T20:25Z,"""kaghanyou""  No need to burn on CD  just simply use WINRAR to extract ISO file and install. :)"
,broken-tears,2008-05-27T12:16Z,"huh, I installed it but when I try to start it, it says that I have to put a disc in the computer. Do I have to burn it to a cd first to play it? 'Cause I don't get it."
,fisherpimped,2008-08-14T00:30Z,you dont need to burn to a disc just use poweriso or similar to mount the iso to a virtual drive then install
,D1sturbance,2008-10-05T13:02Z,I got a trojan while installing this.
,D1sturbance,2008-10-05T13:16Z,"Fuck sorry. Just said ""trojan"" by default, but it's adware detected by nod32."
,Mutti-la,2008-10-11T18:19Z,"Don't bother to download. It comes with adware which is not easily removed and after acomplishing that, the program cannot be installed on the computer. Sorry for being brutal, but frankly this was a waist of time."
,yerepramo,2009-05-04T18:39Z,"what exactly does this application do?
am lookin for a program that i can use my own photo to try different hairstyle makeover. is it the one?"
,isujenk,2009-07-19T01:09Z,"Ad-ware detected during installation. Decided not to install this under Vista for that reason and because it was designed for Windows 98 and complained about my CPU ID being unrecognized. Clearly, this kind of software should not care. Try Salon Styler Pro instead."
