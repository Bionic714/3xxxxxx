,servocat,2007-04-13T02:42Z,"People, i would be leery of *any* torrents of TV shows or movies that are just one AVI instead of the usual multiple rar files..

esp anything produced by FOX/20th Century FOX

In the past year months i've received several email threats from my ISP that were forwarded from BayTsp and FOX
about me downloading/uploading copyrighted TV shows and movies.

all the content i was warned on were from torrents that were single file AVI[ versions of original multi-rar torrents.  

looking back, i also noticed they were uploaded by usernames that were not the usual people that you see uploading  rips from the honorable ripping groups. 

-nor did they have the rippers usual .NFO posted for a description.

I'm not saying that THIS particular torrent is a trap, but these 3 torrents for episodes 3,4 and 5 uploaded on the 7th all have the same look and M.O. of the torrents that got me flagged.

I no longer DL any movies or tv shows that are a single AVI that were originally posted in rars.

all i'm saying is be careful.

Hollywood and the RIAA are really going nuts lately with lawsuits lately.. dont get caught up in one.. or worse.. have your ISP drop you..

-and yes i use PG2."

I appreciate your concern, but just to explain...

I had originally d/l them from another site as the rar files, then unrar'd them and deleted the original rar.  When I was looking for later episodes and noticed several people asking for 3, 4, and 5 so I thought I'd contribute by u/l them.  Fairly new to torrents and have absolutely no idea if a single avi file is easlier to track by than a rar.  If in any doubt please don't d/l - I'm not looking to get anyone busted, esp. me ;-)

Please don't think I'm claiming to be from a group or a regular u/l'r.  Just trying to put back a bit of what I get.  My props go to the guy who originally u/l (sorry, I don't know your name to give due credit), and my gratidude to the people who do this regular.

Cheers
