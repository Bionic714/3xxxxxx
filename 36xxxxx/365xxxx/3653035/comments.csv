,dB145,2007-04-06T11:50Z,"There has been no seeders here for many days now. There is only a lot of more Leechers than earlier, and I have uploaded about 10 times more then I have downloaded. I am stuck on 72%. To bad that some of those who has 100% cant seed! I give up..."
,zimurg,2007-04-06T13:51Z,"sorry... i had a client crash .... and since i'm still the only one who's seeding there has been some delays ... and i'm seeding now!

,020085863,2007-04-09T00:45Z,Seeder hasn't been online today. At least I didn't see it.
,samachadreal,2007-04-11T10:19Z,Episodes appear to be misnumbered.  Episode 11 was episode 10.  I'm checking to see if we are missing one.
,samachadreal,2007-04-11T10:43Z,"Never Mind.  The two hour premier was split into two files.  This throws off the episode numbering, but it's all there."
,|m|,2007-04-12T01:22Z,"Starting download on this now.. seems there a lot of seeders now, but i'm running on a 100mbit unmetered.. so I'll leave it up for quite awhile as well :-)"
,zimurg,2007-04-12T15:33Z,Episodes are as they were aired on scifi channel ... 
,Hei_på-deg,2007-04-28T08:41Z,Best show on television. Love it!
,seeding lottix,2007-04-29T14:38Z,"This is the new battlestar, and not the 1976 right?

Since i'd like swedish subs, who ripped this one?"

4 seeds and I'm getting 1kbs from a guy with 0.2% completed alternating with a someone who has 72% completed. - I'm *uploading* at 21kbs tho... Is it just me?"
,moocow666,2007-05-05T03:42Z,"Will some kind soul please take pitty on this poor noob? Does this file have subtitles in it? If so, is there a way to turn them off?

Also, these are a bunch of rar files. I just use WinRAR to put them into avi files or something like that?"
,Burge0114,2007-05-05T08:43Z,what the hell. compleated dwnload but cant seem to watch in VLC media player or quicktime. ne ideas?
,AdmiralPayne,2007-05-07T00:10Z,Download new codecs.
,Torrentjesus,2007-05-30T03:32Z,"Could someone help me out.....

How do convert these using WINAVI to fit on numerous DVD's so I dont have to reduce too much of the quality

Burned plenty of movies, but usually only 700-1400MB (2.7GB when converted to DVD), so they always fit on one DVD and never had the problem.

Thanks"

The first episode of season 4 will air january!"
,blaqb0x,2007-07-15T20:15Z,"Just finished downloading...how do I view the episodes?

they are rar and srt files....."
,pili_78,2007-08-07T23:44Z,"Please seed!  Stuck at 83% for two days, been downloading for 1 week+ and still not done.  Thanks so much!"
,per1sh,2007-08-31T14:18Z,good torrent...i've watched about half the episodes with no problem.
,ultrajounin,2007-10-08T18:20Z,So what codecs are you guys using?  I've DL'd CCCP + K-Lite Standard + Xvid + AC3 Filter and I still only get audio only.  This is for XP pro.

,DFortune,2007-11-07T05:11Z,"Episode 5 and episode 6 have come up as bad or damaged rar files for me, hash check didn't find anything. Has anyone else been seeing this?"
,DFortune,2007-11-10T14:28Z,"^ Fixed
Skipping the *.en.srt and *.en.srt.srt files resulted in not all of the rars getting fully downloaded or something to that effect."
,Methylene,2007-12-27T00:20Z,"Thirdrail... it's called BSG is by and for nerdy geeks...  You know the ones that know the ins and outs of computers... I think the only reason half of people even share anymore is because they don't even understand how to turn off that feature using bit torrent....

Personally I know I have a shitty upstream, but how can I ever expect to get 350kB/s from BT if I don't at least share something myself.... So I put out 40kB/s for uploads out of respect!  More than some leecher nerd prolly would :)."
,Carpeljet,2008-01-11T02:10Z,"yeah..i can't believe how slow these are.  and it's not just this torrent.  i've downloaded seasons 1,2 and 3 this week and i've rarely got above 30kbs on any of them.  although i have uploaded about 80 gigs each on 1 and 2. and about 20 gigs of season 3."
,rct999,2008-01-13T02:54Z,download the other season 3 torrent (without rar files)!
,Noradia,2008-01-27T01:49Z,I can't play episodes 5 & 6 no matter which applications I use.  Please help!
,Rowain,2008-04-11T13:18Z,"Highly advise AGAINST downloading this rip. The quality is TERRIBLE for 350mb/ep rips and every single episode is rared which is really stupid and inexplicable. Don't let the high seeder count fool or coax you into downloading this, there are much better options. I'd rather wait a few extra days and get the HDTV rips that are on this site."
,viaduct,2008-05-28T00:03Z,"Gotta agree with rowain.  Thanks for the up, zimurg, but the .rar on compressed video files is unnecessary.  I'm gonna go with http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3909358/BattleStar_Galactica_Season_3_Episodes_1-20"
,UnrealAlex,2008-06-24T08:34Z,"Terrible download rate. Havent seen it go above 50, stays in 10-30 most of the time. And quality does suck in a lot of the episodes. Static noise in background audio too."
,mufuti9,2008-08-29T22:35Z,"For all you morons complaining about download speed: These are PUBLIC torrents.
There are dozens of people like you who want to finish the download fast then thurn it off.

If you want better speed you go to a trusted private tracking site, register there and enjoy your maximum bandwidth pushed to the limit 100% of the time.

This is no PR post so I will not post the link to the site I am using (it is the best of them all for tv torrents... hint hint hint)

I got the first 3 seasons from there, together within 24 hours (with a huge season 3 hdtv pack)

Of course you have to give something back to these sites through your upload, you are not able to leech there. A great thing :-)"
,jorje23,2008-09-01T04:39Z,"please stop the rar compressed torrents... it just wastes everyone time uncompressing the video files.

,sorenskov,2008-11-17T03:48Z,"As previously said, please don't rar torrents.
In this case it means I will only seed 1:1 or 2:1 and then delete, as opposed to my usual 200:1 - no one gains anything from rar."
,killller54,2008-12-13T14:54Z,"nice upload, but unfortunately i gotta cut the seed.

i uploaded 2.263:1"
,huggums537,2009-09-17T01:15Z,"Thanks! 
The RARS are ok with me since I can extract individual episodes as I watch them and I don't have room on my drive to expand all of them at once.

Check out my torrents: http://thepiratebay.org/user/huggums537"
,huggums537,2009-09-17T01:41Z,Please seed. Thx.
,NeutralGold,2009-10-19T01:55Z,"huggums537
Yeah but you wouldn't need to make room to unrar them if they weren't rarred in the first place :p...

Either way, most people don't realize why people rar them. Not so much as compressing but splitting the files in 15 megabyte increments. 

I hate when I have to unrar/decompress a video that isn't compressed any more than it is in the first place before it was zipped/rarred. But I do happen to know why they're zipped up like this

Files like these that show up on torrents usually come from newsgroup downloads. There is a cap on most newsgroups where you can only upload a 15 megabyte file, so hence the file split like this :P..

They show up on here like they were on the news groups.

There are also the ignorant people that don't know any better that think there is some benefit to having them put like that as well. Those people should realize that it serves no purpose other than wasting the down loader's time having to uncompress the file :P.. Hope that clears up some of the air.."
,adamlogan,2009-12-16T07:10Z,"Thanks for the upload, synced subtitles is a must for me.. Yeah, Rar is a pain but it was yet another opportunity to learn and harness the power of cli =)."
,tinny112,2010-04-14T08:19Z,good stuff. no problems
,kocko77,2010-06-21T00:32Z,Ep 15-20 bad quality on rars. Can't decompress.
,asscore,2010-07-31T00:56Z,Fuck all of you rar-haters.  RAR is the standard scene format.  If you dont like it go fucking pay for it.
,tehmadcap,2010-11-12T09:12Z,Rar compresses them from 700mb to 699mb and takes hours to extract. It's fucking pointless.
,faqqers,2011-01-15T03:53Z,All Sci Fi channel rips. 10/10 for audio and video but piss poor cutting around the adverts spoils each episode.
