The Palestinians have had their chance again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Fuck em!"

However, Isreal nor the United States are not the solution to the problem. Muslims in Palestine need to destroy the corruption and poverty in their own country. By the time they have become a first world country, they will be educated enough to not blame others for their problems."
