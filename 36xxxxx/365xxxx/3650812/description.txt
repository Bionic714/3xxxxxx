Overview:	In early 20th century China, Ti Lung plays a loner, armed only with a length of iron chain, who seeks a mysterious figure named Lan Fei. He gains an ally in the form of Shang Lin (Li Ching), who wants to learn what Lan Fei knows about the killing of her husband 15 years earlier. Jason Pai Piao plays Mr. Cho, the town boss who offers Ti $5000 to back off. A dapper man named Mr. Tu arrives with an arsenal of throwing knives and a set of questionable loyalties. In response to all this activity, Mr. Cho calls on the Heroic Seven (or Invincible Seven), a team of legendary fighters, some of whom are women, who emerge from hiding to take out Ti. The local police force gets involved also. Ti gets into lots of kung fu fights, using only his chain and his feet as weapons. The frequent fights involve kung fu, knives, and ultimately, guns. There is a dramatic twist ending.
