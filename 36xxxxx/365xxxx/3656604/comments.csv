,rooflee,2007-05-09T14:50Z,"OK, just started downing this one, looks good, thanks alot. My only question is how do I burn this onto a disk> do I just unrar and burn them as a big data file or is there some ISO somewhere? coz I couldnt see it in the file list...perhaps inside one of the RAR's? thanks again."

,offthewall2112,2008-02-15T15:52Z,"After I download this I am going to upload this permanently to a PS2 .iso download site. If you know you're methods of getting PS2 games other than using torrents or rapidshare then you will probably be able to find it, you just need to register first though.."
,bossbzz,2009-03-21T12:09Z,nice one....
,ZuboCRO,2009-10-13T22:59Z,Wellz i kno it prolly 2 late to answer on this 1 but still....: My only question is how do I burn this onto a disk (by roflee). When u get to .iso file (after extracting all of the pieces into sam folder) use Alchocol 120 to burn it (it has an option to burn in PS2 format) and the game should work.
