You own the Underground!

Get ready for a totally new breed of the Tony Hawk experience - Tony Hawk's Underground.

Play as yourself, not a pro skater, and make your way through a plot-twisting, true-to-life story that takes you from unknown local skate punk to fame and fortune as a superstar skater.

For the first time ever, you'll be able to get off your board and explore 9 expansive levels on foot or by vehicle. Enjoy unprecedented customization by designing and naming your own original tricks through the all-new Create-a-Trick. Or create bigger parks and include your own goals in the expanded Skate Park Editor.
	 	

After you're done, share your tricks and parks online with your friends. You can even download your own face into the game! And, with all-new online play - new games, stats, and online rankings - you'll have infinite expansion through downloadable content.

You're the star...you own the Underground!
