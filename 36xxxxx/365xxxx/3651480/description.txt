Building a Chopper Chassis, by Ron Covell

See a chopper frame built before your eyes! Ron Covell goes through the entire process, starting with an overview of frame design, explaining the concepts of rake, trail, and stretch.

He covers the use of chassis jigs, then goes on to show how to bend and fit tubing to create a chopper frame to match any design. Ron?s clear and detailed explanations will help any builder get on the road quickly, with a minimum amount of wasted effort.

He also shows the use of both entry-level and high-end tools for layout, cutting, and bending. With the excellent instruction found here, building a frame may be an easier project than you imagine! DVD - 70 minutes
