,kress81,2007-04-18T22:37Z,Any subs ??
,MrMansson,2007-04-23T18:23Z,Crazy Sweet
,MrMansson,2007-04-26T23:39Z,"The nfo falsly states that these are 720p. They are not.

The resolution is 960x544 which means they don't quite make it to HD, but falls in between SD and HD.
Nontheless, it's a HQ torrent with nicely organized files.

Just wanted to make the above clear as it might be a big deal to some people."
,tcooteman,2007-05-01T14:25Z,Is er ook een prison break met nederlandse ondertiteling ?
,Jonaswoll,2007-05-04T08:55Z,"Seed please.. This is a large folder.. And I'm stuck at about one gig a day with a 1mb line.. Btw, thanks for posting this torrent chiggyman!"
,Phoenix126,2007-09-06T23:21Z,Where's Series 1 Episode 8?
,derelikt,2007-10-12T11:22Z,"The quality of these vid's are excellent and much work went into them (ad's removed etc).  Thank you much for this, I have only watched 4 episodes and am hooked.  Beautifully done, thanks Chiggy.  For a download of this size, more seeds are needed.  After you get this, KEEP SEEDING IT!

Season 1 episode 8 is misnamed as Prison Break 1.018HD (extra 1 was added by mistake).   There are no subtitles, English Language."
