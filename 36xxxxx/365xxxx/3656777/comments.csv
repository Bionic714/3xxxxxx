,mikohl,2007-04-10T21:31Z,"To get the subs to work, unzip the .zip files containing the subs in the dir of the seasons. Then install subtitle program, for instance http://www.filetransit.com/view.php?id=4318"

,DonAlfrito,2009-11-27T03:06Z,"Okay.. Somebody tell me if this is legit, because I don't want to wast my time on 40GB to find out that some of them are just copies of other or whatever.  I'm seeing a lot of comments saying that."
,DonAlfrito,2009-12-06T14:52Z,"Time elapsed - 1w2d
Percentage done - 41

I'm going to have to seed the fuck out of this once it's done. I'll seed it until it's stable with good seeders.

Would still like to know if I'm wasting my time, though... I won't seed if it's fucked up."
,DonAlfrito,2009-12-14T22:49Z,Okay... People were right. This is a waste of time. mikohl obviously doesn't care about this torrent and neither do I. Some episodes are in fact copies of other. So thank you for wasting my time. I won't seed garbage.
