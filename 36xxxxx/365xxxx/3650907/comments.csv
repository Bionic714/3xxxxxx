Granted, I'm a schmo who was turned on to Mark Knopfler by hearing his music from ""The Princess Bride,"" but I was really exctied to see this torrent.  What a tease when I then saw the stats -0 dl's, 0 seeds, 0 Leechers, and 0 comments.  What a serious phreaking tease.  Bring it back delhiflats!!!"
