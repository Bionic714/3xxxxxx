I will definately check out your other uploads!"
,freebsdhost,2007-04-15T05:31Z,I use a 2-pass DivX 6.5 encoding process - takes hours but the quality is worth it.
,tanstafl,2007-04-17T07:06Z,"Thanks very much freebsdhost! The quality is excellent, not like some other releases..."
,atifdarr,2007-04-22T01:06Z,"Brilliant quality rip! Axxo's rips are great, but the 700mb size starts to show its quality limitations when watched on a 10ft projector screen. However, this encoding by freebsdhost was crystal clear even at this size! As oliver twist once said: ""Can I have some more please?"""
,Hiero101,2007-04-29T20:15Z,thnx alot nightsongs.. 
,alarik_2,2007-06-04T14:06Z,"Good quality might be good, but seeding is better..."
,freebsdhost,2007-06-20T14:45Z,I seed with a 4000kb/sec limit within europe... seeding outside of europe might not be so good however :(
,Smur-Mur,2007-06-23T20:12Z,"Seed please.
Im dying to see this movie."
,kenjah,2007-10-17T01:55Z,seed please!
,Al6e55x321,2007-11-07T01:25Z,"Paramount, who owns the copyright to this film, had their lawyers send a threatening letter to my internet service provider to try and make them give them my identity... probably not to send me flowers either. Word to the wise.

By the way, when you guys rip off your own writers, and try to put people in jail for having a torrent open-- how much sympathy do you actually expect to elicit from the public?

Everybody-- boycott Paramount. Their movies suck anyway."
,K1ck1,2007-12-20T18:47Z,seed plz
