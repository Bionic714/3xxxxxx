1st Li Gong (Gong Li is wat I call her) movie I didnt like. There was no makeup, no interesting storyline, no beautiful countryside & da clothes look like they were jus handpicked out da actor's closets (gota c ALL da actors 2 kno wat I mean). She goes thru the ""whole"" movie lookn like a run down pregnant bag-lady n da most dirt-poor sec of China from da 50s or 60s. IMBd doesnt tell u dis so I am. "
