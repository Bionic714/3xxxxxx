In series one, Dick Strawbridge and his family turned a neglected 
farm in Cornwall into a viable eco-home. Thousands of people from 
around the country were inspired to try and make their lives 
greener. Many of them contacted Dick asking for help and advice 
on their projects. 

The second series follows Dick as he and his son James venture out 
from New House Farm in Cornwall to meet these aspiring individuals 
and families in cities and countryside around Britain. 

In the first programme, Dick helped the Keenan family in Wirral 
build an eco-house, setting up a ground-source heat pump, 
wind-turbine, and rainwater harvesting system. Then Dick, helped 
by James and assistant Jim, went to the aid of the Hunts family, 
who needed to grow fresh fruit and vegetables for their son who 
has multiple allergies.
