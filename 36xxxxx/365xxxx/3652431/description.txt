This is Command & Conquer Red Alert Retaliation - Allies Disc for psx converted to psp eboot file.


I found the red alert psx disk images on this torrent(seems tpb doesnt like links to other torrent sites): http:// torrent spy dot com 

/torrent/904643/Complete_Sony_PlayStation_NTSC_U_Collection_Part_C


there are a lot of psx games on it in case anyones interested.

I converted with autopopstation:
 
dl.qj.net/AutoPopstation4-General-Tools-Utilities-PSP-Tools-Utilities-on-PC/pg/12/fid/12400/catid/193


It works fine for me on custom firmware 3.10 oe by dark alex

sometimes stutters a bit when on turbo speed, but totally playable. 

I found it easier to use the joystick than the buttons pad.

drop the folder in /PSP/GAME/ in your memory stick

i couldn't find it anywhere so here it is

hope it works 4 all of u.



please comment if it works or not.

Enjoy and seed, I wont be able to seed for that long so its up to u guys once there are a few seeders.


Cheers
