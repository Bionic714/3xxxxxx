i need a uplook code for this update"
,afx79,2007-04-03T17:29Z,is there any way to unlock this software on my GPS ?
,dr.svejk,2007-04-03T20:10Z,"You need to have a valid unlock code to upload this map to your GPS.

To get an unlock code you have to buy the original v8 DVD, and register it to your GPS.
Once you did that, you can obtain an additional unlock key to this version for free, if your CNE v8 was registered at garmin after Sep/2006. If your copy of CNE v8 was registered before Sep/2006, then you still can use this update, but you will have to pay $75 for the updated unlock key.

This is the only way to upload this map to your GPS."

go download it and use the version 1.3 keygen so you dont have to pay those assholes here to do something a kid can do.

You just need the map ID to unlock the maps depending on which map u are using."
