Garmin Mapsource City Navigator Europe v9 Deluxe update DVD
*** Online Edition ***

This is a copy of a free DVD released by Garmin to update City Navigator
Europe Deluxe v8 to version 9.

CNE v8 might be needed to install this update.
Garmin offers a free DVD (delievered by snail mail) for all v8 users.
I have ordered mine more than a month ago, but it still has not arrived.
I got this copy from a friend of mine, and made this release.

This package does not contain the "rgn" directory of the original DVD.
There are 3 large files (3 x 1.6MB) in that directory.
When I  removed that directory, I was able to successfully update my
City Navigator Europe v8, so I suspect those files are only needed for
the referred StreetPilot devices.

So I excluded that directory to make this package as small as possible.
