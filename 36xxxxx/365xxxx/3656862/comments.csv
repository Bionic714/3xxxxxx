I would prefer it, if you would seed this first, you blame it on computer problems, yet you are uploading more ?"
,the flame,2007-04-06T12:30Z,all uploads are seeding as we speak... others have download from them... sorry.. all will be as normal in next few hours
,madjock56,2007-04-06T13:22Z,"Why are we all stuck at 38 % after 2 days.

You are doing to many, make sure you seed to at least a few before starting others.

Thankks for the uploads, but I think you are doing too many at once."
,the flame,2007-04-07T22:09Z,well many are downloading with no problems.....
