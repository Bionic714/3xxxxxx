,ppltkn,2012-08-01T22:16Z,"Hey, i just downloaded this and it works fine for me. First when i tried it didn't work, and i was looking for answers on the internet, but didn't find anything..

My problem was that the Nexus could't find the license. So i tried some things and i worked for me.

Step by step:

1. Un zip the torrent
2. When un ziped go to the ""Windows setup"" folder
3. install the program
4. locate the new folder that was created under istallation, mine is called vstplugins.
5. copy/drag the Nexus.dll file into the vst plugin map in FL studio folder.
6. go to FL studio, press channel ->add new --> more, then you get a list of all your plugins.
7. Press ""refresh"", and use the ""fast scan"". nexus should turn up red at the bottom.

If you try to open nexus now fl studio will say yo miss a license file, to fix this simply go to the nexus folder that you downloaded, go to the OSX Setup folder and copy/drag the only file in this to the same folder you did earlyer. (plug in folder)

Now the license problem is fixed.
