,Paintball3325,2008-03-06T03:35Z,"Actually, the Flyleaf song entitle Cassie is about the Columbine shootings. Cassie is the girl that people say was asked if she believed in God. When she said yes they killed her. Lacey is singing that if her faith was tested she too would say yes, which is like pulling the trigger. Go listen to that song again before you go on an anti-christian rant"
,Xmaximus4X,2008-03-28T18:22Z,Thanks Paintball3325
,Roadkill01,2008-04-04T02:53Z,"lol @ 0n1n3

""And Cassie pulled the trigger""

when the singer said ""And I will pull the trigger"" she was speaking for Cassie.

And yes it was talking about Columbine, it was saying that Christians were being persecuted and Cassie stood up for her beliefs and said that yes, she believed in God."

,zoobezee,2008-08-12T20:12Z,"...I've only heard there song Breath Into Me.
But from what I have heard, this band has a lot of potential. Hope the rest of the album is just as good.
Thanks for the Torrent man, keep it up."
,AOTP1337,2008-08-25T05:07Z,"Very good upload, thanks jimeh!
Please continue your work on other artists, as I love having all of the correct labels in my iTunes, even the BPM and lyrics!
A similar collection with Breaking Benjamin would be awesome :P
Every song on this album is amazing, btw :)"

,SamZee,2009-04-14T01:53Z,"I've learned about Red in 2007 and have loved them ever since.  This is a phenomenal album, not a single song that I avoid listening to.  Great download, completely clean, and always at 320kbps, how it should be."
