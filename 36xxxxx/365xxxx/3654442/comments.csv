,vicky83,2007-04-06T10:26Z,whats the quality like? is it screener???
,gcq,2007-04-06T15:21Z,Its a fair cam grab - not a screener.  A bit dark for my liking with a slight glare from the screen in some instances.  IMHO wait for someone to seed something better.
,Mr_HASTA,2007-04-12T14:24Z,theres some problems with the audio after 1 hour but it fixes by itself quickly
,SEYKYU,2007-04-19T11:01Z,"bloody out of sync,the chopper was already shot down but the action was way way late.dark screen too...too bad ..."
,vicky83,2007-04-19T12:20Z,its a fucked up copy dnt waste u time 
,iamu,2007-04-21T14:22Z,"Something the others havn't mentioned and I believe the worst part about this copy is the screen is covered many times and a lot of those times are when there is important action. If people walking in front of the screen annoys you having a coat put over the camera on a regular basis will send you nuts.  However if you like black screens go right ahead and download it. 
Some may say don't complain its a cam and you  knew it was a cam when you down loaded it but there are good cams and bad cams. This one is right at the bottom."

If anyone want's a perfect picture either:

1) Go to the cinema
2) Wait for aXXo to upload it

It's free so stop whingeing."

Type: Documentary

Rating: NR

Running Time: 96 Minutes

Directed by: Walon Green

Soundtrack: Stevie Wonder

The thesis of this visually stunning documentary feature is that plants have feelings, too, and that they have a variety of ways of expressing them. Based on the best-selling book by Peter Topkins and Christopher Bird, the custom of talking to one's houseplants is strongly recommended by the filmmakers. Though scientific in tone, the film does not air the opposing view advocated by, perhaps, a majority of scientists. One highlight of the film is its original musical score by Stevie Wonder. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide
