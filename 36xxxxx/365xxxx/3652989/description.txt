I spent many hours several years ago digitizing a low noise copy of this amazing Moog synthesizer LP, and then digitally removing all the pops. What you have here, now, is a CD-quality copy of this rare LP. The files are in AIFF format (which iTunes will easily convert to MP3) but if you leave them in their native format, the files are a whopping 1411 kbps in quality. Enjoy!!
