A great movie with Jim Carray!

Look at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183505/ for more info.


Audio: EN DD5.1 and FR DD5.1
Subs: EN, FR and NL

This is a full-copy of a Region 2 PAL DVD.

But it\'s small enough to burn on a DVD5!

Good luck and seed enough!


By the way: ban the 38.x.x.x IP range, they are seeding fake data!
