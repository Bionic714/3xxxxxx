,marmour,2007-06-13T18:40Z,I had the same problem. You have to update your codecs. However its never easy. got to www.filehippo.com and get codec pack. Then you may have to disable the codec for your SW using the codec tweak. That should fix it. I was using Nero and had to disable their mpg1 mpg2 filter. Then the update codecs kick in
