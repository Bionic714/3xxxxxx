,]osh42O,2007-07-20T04:39Z,"OMFG the resolution is HORRIBLE.

Why in the hell did you upload this? You can plainly see it is all stretched and looks like SHIT."
,Demosthenes928,2008-02-03T08:54Z,"I'm going to have to agree with ]osh42O, the resolution is pretty horrible. And it looks like someone tried to make a wide screen movie into a full screen movie by stretching it vertically. But, since I heard great things about this movie I guess it's watchable."
