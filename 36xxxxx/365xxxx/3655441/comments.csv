,DrugSquad66,2007-04-05T10:14Z,"would not extract, using unRAR or stuffit.

fucking waste of time

get fucked dope...."
,schweinkopf,2007-04-05T10:56Z,"Nuked:

Proper notes: The SORNY release has bad red chroma on 1 of every 4 frames. See included screenshots for examples. This continues through the entire episode. Their release also has numerous drops causing loss of audio and video including at 4:02 and 12:59. A giant ""fuck you"" to CTV and Canada in general for doing such a wonderful job of screwing up American TV.
