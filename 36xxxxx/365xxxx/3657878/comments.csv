as I do not have TTHome, 
I've simply exploded the files, and, copied to existing \TomTom on my SD card, overwriting existing files, it works good on Palm T3 and Palm TX, the version has updated
thanks again,

PalmTomTomer"
,rQbinN,2007-04-29T20:13Z,I guess that my Tungsten T is way too old right?
,DellBoy1975,2007-06-13T22:12Z,"Hi.. I have a problem.. I got read the directions and got my maps installed properly, got full access to them.. but it will never save my settings, saying there is an error writing the file.  It wont; save my home, etc..  I installed this by extracting the software to an SD card via SD card reader (Tom Tom Home would not detect my Palm T3).  I copied my maps, and a series od voices I have.  I got through the installation.  My Bluetooth BPS receiver works great...  But EVERY time I esit it tells me it can not save my settings. ""Please Confirm: Unable to save your prefrences: An error occured acessing a file.. Are you sure you want to exit?""  I reinstalled it this way 3 times hoping it would fix the issue..  And suggestions woudl be great."
,DellBoy1975,2007-06-13T23:20Z,"Update : The SD card is not locked, and I went and made sure ALL the folders and files were NOT Read Only...  Still ahve this issue"

,kryckmeister,2008-01-04T21:44Z,"If you're using a Tungsten T3 and can't save, make sure you're using no more than a 1Gb SD card. Larger cards will work but the T3 won't save on them."
