,shorty_sx,2008-07-04T19:33Z,"Yep all the files are working, plenty of seeders including your truly (got 1mb/s up right now) :P so enjoy the series!

Just so there are no mistakes and peanuts who doesnt know how to use his torrent (its no sin :) this includes:
Justice League (Seasons 1 and 2)
Justice League Unlimited (Seaons 1, 2 and 3 ~ aka Justice League Seasons 3, 4 and 5)

In other words, aside from the New Frontier which just came out, this is all the Justice League seasons. (For what its worth, I enjoyed the first 2 seasons a lot more than the others, especially cuz of the 40 min runtime)

The quality could* be better, however its the best I could find so far, has plenty of seeders and the quality is just fine. "
