Feel the weight of history as you walk out to a deafening roar and onto the biggest stage 
in club football. In the cauldron-like atmosphere of a stadium alive with the dreams of 
thousands and heaving with the pressure of expectation, kick off alongside the most formidably 
talented footballers in Europe ? and outplay them. Here is the ultimate test. Here history 
is made. Write yourself into legend with the only official UEFA Champions League 2006-2007 game 
for the PlayStation 2/PC.

Test your management credentials with over 400 objectives to accomplish across all game modes. 
Take your pick from an array of gameplay options, including The Treble, where you have just 
one season in your bid to score European football?s dream hat-trick.

On the pitch, players are sharper than ever. Thanks to a fluid, pacy movement system, they can 
now release more incisive defence-splitting one-twos, first touches and through passes.

Manage your campaign home and away by transferring The Treble mode to the PSP system and back 
(PS2 Only). 

With five challenging game modes to test your managerial skill at the top level, it?s down 
to you to write yourself into UEFA Champions League history.
