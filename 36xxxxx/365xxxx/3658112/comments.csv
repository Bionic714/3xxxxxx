""The rigorous mathematical proof is a 7-part proof.""

The proof includes six of the main properties of prime numbers, including symmetry, reciprocity,  closure (using the operation of addition), and the infinite wavelike nature of prime numbers.

""There are seven pieces of the puzzle that had to be put together in an intricate, interwoven pattern and that provide the solution to directly calculate the prime numbers.""

""I've found that too many times, when people look at the rigorous (proof) there is just too much diverse information there. Only the most sophisticated mathematicians could pick up the rigorous paper and understand it on the first sitting.""

There is an overall pattern to the prime numbers. The prime numbers are not random. They are in fact extremely orderly. You just have to find that order, an order locked in the numbers.

,Kibbles5757,2007-04-13T02:22Z,"April 12, 2007 posting ... {quote from www.jmccsci.com} join me on my weekly radio show this week as i talk about the following topics ... the main science topic will be how to have some fun with the RFiD chip industry ... that is ... how to jam it and create false data ... i will be dealing more with this topic as time goes on ... of course my latest book ""Calculate Primes"" deals with among other things the breaking of one aspect of the encryption codes locked into these microchips ... can you imagine the fun all the hackers will have with those data bases once i show them how to jam the system and how to read and modify the signals coming from RFiD chips ... imagine all the money and time and effort invested in putting everything into these little human tracking devises and imagine their chagrin as thousands of hackers around the world play games with this system to crack it wide open ... i may write a book ... ""FUN WITH RFiD CHIPS ... the hackers guide to jamming the system"" ... so on tonight's show i will give the beginning of ""the top ten ways to jam the RFiD chip system data bases"" ... more to come with that in the future ... i will also enhance the topic of how these little devices are read in your home and who is behind a seemingly brilliant idea of putting radio transmitters in your home to read your water meter ... turns out that the same people who own WALMART and Home Depot (the largest purveyors of RFiD chips in products) also made an interesting purchase a number of years ago ... they made a seemingly innocuous purchase of a company called ""National Water Works"" ... it first passed hands through a company called HUGES and then was acquired by Home Depot ... and is now called  HD Water Supply ... their primary goal today is to convince your city to install a ""cost saving measure"" to read your water meter and send that information by way of radio signal to a centralized data center ... now the catch ... those small RFiD chips that are embedded in every product you will buy have a very short radio transmission range ... so WALMART and the boys needed a way to get an RFiD chip reader into your house so every time you change your underwear or open a bottle cap ... the data would be sent to the mother data base and sold to all kinds of companies as ""marketing data"" ... and it will be tracked to YOU and YOUR HOUSEHOLD ... they will be able to tell if you are home and who is home at your house and every product in your home and when you use those products ... i bet big brother would pay them too for some of this data to put into the TIA (Total Information Awareness) computer system that will track your every move and activity ... also on this show and actually very related is the ongoing saga of ""GLOBAL WARMING"" and its implications of ""eminent drought"" and water shortage ... enter again the National Water Works water metering system that can measure the water you use in your house down to the last drop ... geee aren't these guys cute ... and how about all the big stars joining Al (internet) Gore to start a series of world wide concerts to drive home ""save the planet"" on the biggest lie ever pervaded on the planet ... is the data really telling us the world is warming ??? if it is ... and we see the ice caps melting ... and 95% of all the fresh water on earth is locked into the ice caps of greenland and antarctica ... then we have a water management problem ... not a water shortage ... but watch as every governmental body from the UN to your local water control board uses this excuse to turn the screws to you and charge you huge prices for water ... remember FOTUNE magazine's statement that water will be to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th century ... the big corporations are already moving to take over every drop of water on the planet ... many more topics on this week's show ... jim mccanney

a quote from FORTUNE magazine ... 'privatization of water by large corporations' is ""one of the world's great business opportunities. It promises to be to the 21st century what oil was to t"

,Kibbles5757,2009-06-08T20:57Z,"McCanney says this about his independent website (www.jmccsci.com/):

""just a quick note to new visitors ... about 2500 new people come to this site every day ... so lots of traffic going on here ... be aware that this page with the various sub-pages has over 3 Giga-bytes (that's right ... 3 Giga-bytes) of information ... there is a lot to learn""
