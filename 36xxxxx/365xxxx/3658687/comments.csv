,meohmy1,2007-04-08T22:32Z,this is a clean version.  :(
,StEC,2007-04-09T07:33Z,Only the clean version has been leaked so far so you will have to wait for the uncut version.
,TheGrimReaper,2007-04-11T03:41Z,"What does clean version mean? Please write back to my user, or else I will fail to remember it. ^^"
,ThreeDee,2007-04-11T03:47Z,Hopefully Torrentazoz still isn't using the old and buggy LAME 3.90...
,Busker,2007-04-11T13:23Z,THESE FILES ARE CORRUPT!
,Beetlejuicexx,2007-04-12T17:57Z,"In reply to TheGrimReaper -= clean version means the expletives / swearing / rude words have been blanked, beeped or left out.

For example - Girlfriends lyrics include the words 'Mother F**ker' the version in this torrent has only 'Mother '"

Not as corrupt as you nobber
How dare you get personal on a torrent comment?
These comments are about the files we download,not for dickheads like you to insult users,so go screw yourself!and do everyone a favour."
