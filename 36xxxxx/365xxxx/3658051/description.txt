This is a DVD-rip for your cat at home!

No joke..check out http://www.kittyshow.com/birdsdvdinfo.htm for more info.

It is not a DVD, so if you want to play it on your television, you have to have a DIVXplayer, Xbox, TV-out, Mediacenter or any other machine that can playback AVI┬┤s with the DIVX codec.

Enjoy!
