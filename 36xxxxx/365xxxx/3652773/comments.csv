,smlefo,2007-04-29T00:17Z,"Good games, however I suggest adding the following:

Blaster Master, Micro Machines, Zelda 2, Chessmaster, Arkanoid, Chip n Dales Rescure Rangers 1 and 2, Duck Tales 1 and 2, Wizards and Warriors 1 and 2 (Ironsword), Kirby...

There's probably more that I'm forgetting.  Oh well."
