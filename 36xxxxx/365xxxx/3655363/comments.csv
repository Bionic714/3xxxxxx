,Anarchist_UK,2007-06-30T19:33Z,"ok, i'm trying to bind a keylogger with a program using the binder ""freshbind2"" but when i put the 2 files in the window like

the keylogger(called something else).exe-Execute(hidden)


the program.exe-Execute(Visible)

but when i run the binded program both the keylogger AND the program come up with the installation window

i'm using SC-Keylogv2.24 and if i'm using it how will the things that it records from the other computer be sent to mine?

soz bout all these questions, but i have one more
what is a trojan? and how do you go about sending and using one?

thanks so much"

well most hacking tools have viruses in them, but as you all should know hacking tools are freeware !! also with this torrent it probably does have viruses, but depending on what the line of code is within the file, because most hacking programs need viruses but will not harm ur computer that badly. 

All i can say is thanks for the upload mate an download if you want  

:) "
,Chrijosh,2009-01-17T22:34Z,"It says its  supposed to contain viruses

If you are dumb enough you can destroy your own computer with this program.
Some of the files may be dangerous, but the uploader was kind enough to point out which files he/she did not scan and put a warning in the description.

Read the description... "
