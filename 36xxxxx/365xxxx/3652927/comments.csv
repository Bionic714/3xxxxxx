,archelaus,2007-04-29T02:41Z,"It's written (I believe) in Bulgarian. The nick ""Brigada BG"" would translate to the ""Bulgarian Brigade"" in English.

Because it wasn't composed in Unicode, the text is illegible.

A reminder that the official languages of TPB are Swedish and English, although others are allowed."

,cybershaman,2008-06-10T14:37Z,"to archelaus and all others:
The nick ""Brigada BG"" would translate to the ""Bulgarian Brigade"" in English.
from the name of dl source ukrtel its clear that this mess does not come from bulgarian source: ukrtel = ukraina telecom, nichtwahr? another thing: ""brigada"" is very rare used in todays bulgarian spoken language, opposite to nowadays russian spoken language. so dont blame smart bulgarians, look after the illiterate russianspokened. everyone who thinks of war outrages commonsense far, everyone who thinks of trade is wellgrown to cutters blade.
this is written from ""bg"" but not from ""brigada"".
________________
p.s. why ""smart bulgarians"" - in the beginning of 1996 on the whole continent there were just three (3) public places for internet-access, so i contriveed here in sofia the fourth european internet-cafe. and compared to american people, i becomed my first email address twenty months earlier/before the president of the united states of america."
