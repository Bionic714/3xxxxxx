Plot Synopsis from AMG

The ugly American bullying his way through a foreign country was a subject for comedy in several films of the 1980s, most notably Bill Forsyth\\\\\\\'s Local Hero and this film from exiled Yugoslavian director Dusan Makavejev. Eric Roberts plays Becker, an aggressive marketing executive for the Coca-Cola Company; he has been assigned to figure out why sales in hot and dry Australia aren\\\\\\\'t higher. Becker comes up against a low-key but formidable adversary, T. George McDowell (Bill Kerr), whose homegrown soda has cornered the market in his little corner of the country. Complicating matters is Terri, a local woman (Greta Scacchi) Becker hires as his secretary; she\\\\\\\'s McDowell\\\\\\\'s daughter and a single mom who\\\\\\\'s romantically attracted to the brash American. Becker wants to make a deal on his (and his employer\\\\\\\'s) terms, but he finds himself falling prey to the charms of life Down Under and the ministrations of Terri.

Review from AMG

Arguably Dusan Makavejev\\\\\\\'s most accessible and entertaining film, The Coca-Cola Kid is a genial comedy with a rare light performance by Eric Roberts, whose subsequent roles devolved largely into villains and psychotics. Makavejev plays off Roberts\\\\\\\' clenched line readings to suggest that here is a man who just needs a little loosening up, and he\\\\\\\'ll be okay. In fact, Roberts\\\\\\\' Becker is a distant cousin to Susan Anspach\\\\\\\'s uptight American in Makavejev\\\\\\\'s most popular film, Montenegro. The Coca-Cola Kid also pokes fun at the Australians, too; if Becker is wound a bit too tight, they\\\\\\\'re shown as making a fetish out of being laid-back. Their \\\\\\\"no worries mate\\\\\\\" philosophy does begin to loosen up Becker, and it helps to have a sexy woman (Greta Scacchi in her second important film after a stunning debut in Heat and Dust) as the bait. The film may not be as textured and consistently entertaining as Local Hero, but it\\\\\\\'s got fizz enough.
