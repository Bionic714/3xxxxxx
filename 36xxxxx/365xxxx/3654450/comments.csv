,flamesong,2007-04-04T13:35Z,I don't speak Spanish so I had to download this to find out it is an Intel only application.
,scunky,2007-04-04T13:49Z,"Joost is a free internet TV provider
however you have to have an invte from a current member otherwise this software is useless"
,supercrisp,2007-04-04T14:39Z,"flamesong, It's Intel in Spanish too, you tard. So what the guy did is not post that it's Intel-only."
,usudekin,2007-04-04T15:25Z,"Run it through a translation program and you get:

""Joost 0,9 from the same program you can create your account of access to the main pagina of JOOST""

Not that hard a thing to do ?"
,flamesong,2007-04-04T15:28Z,"The poster wrote in Spanish, 'Joost 0.9 desde el mismo programa puedes crear tu cuenta de acceso a la pagina principal de JOOST'.

So, superclit, my sarcasm went straight over your dickhead.

For those who don't need knock-knock jokes explaining, I downloaded it and when I launched it I got the message that it was Intel only.

I made my post simply to save any other PPC users wasting their time downloading something that won't work."
,emacnuel,2007-04-05T00:57Z,Only is for Intel :-(  Damn JOOST
,sartec,2007-04-05T08:24Z,"I Speak Spanish: It say that if you don't hav a
