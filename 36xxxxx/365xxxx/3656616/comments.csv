you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!."
,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2007-10-12T08:15Z,"This game is so good.
You control your ship by mouse. This gives you an advantage and a drawback. The advantage is that you can control the ship faster the drawback that you can not use a controller. You can not move back and forth the ship just side ways.
The artwork in the game is awesome, the enemies are colorful and imaginative, your weapons are also good. This game is almost is so good as Tyranian was.
Worth downloading and playing it."

Works 100% and no bugz ;)

Awesome side-scroller similar to Galaga but a lot harder. Great graphics, sounds, lots of bonus weapons, 8 large missions with a huge Boss at the end of each one and over 100 levels to boot!
