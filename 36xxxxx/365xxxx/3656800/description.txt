[CD-RIP] - Joe Satriani - Guitar Killer - Live At San Diego Sport Arena 1988
===================================================================================
This is a unofficial (bootleg) CD recorded live at San Diego Sport Arena during
1988 USA tour. A very good chance to hear Satriani playing live in his early years.
As I said this is a bootleg, but the sound quality is pretty good. Check it out.
I decided to rip the entire CD in a single file because in the original disk the ID
track markers are written in the wrong place and cut the songs in two.
