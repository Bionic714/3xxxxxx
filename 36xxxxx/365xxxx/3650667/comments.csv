,Flaxxo,2008-02-14T00:45Z,"Born on 2nd September 1934, Allen, a Londoner, started his career as a qualified accountant in 1958. He was successful in his chosen profession, but his hundred-cigarettes-a-day addiction was driving him to despair. In 1983, after countless failed attempts to stop by using will-power, he finally discovered what the world had been waiting for ? the Easyway to Stop Smoking.

Allen Carr was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer in the summer of 2006


Before his death Allen remarked ?Since I smoked my final cigarette, 23 years ago, I have been the happiest man in the world, I still feel the same way today?.

Well Guys Its worked for me, I just finished the audio book. Not had a fag now for three weeks. And guess what, I dont miss the dirty filthy things one bit. GodBless Mr Carr."

,adontour,2008-02-29T10:21Z,"Hi guys i downloaded this torrent but can't seem to open it. i went into the rar file and clicked on launch but the when i click start course it tells me to insert the cd 
. i really wanna stop smoking HELP LOL"
,TastyCakes,2008-04-04T09:02Z,"Hey adontour i havnt finished dling this yet but if its like the 1st one i dled you have to burn it for it to work.  I had trouble opening it directly then burned and it ran fine.  

Also im downloading this just to seed it.  I went through this program in december of 07 and i thought i could never quit.  Smoked 1-2 packs/day, tried dunno how many times to quit, i even went into this thinking it wont work but this program worked for me, it doesnt make you not smoke, it makes you not want to smoke.

If you want to quit, download this, burn it and go through it."
,usedfake,2008-06-01T09:48Z,"I read that this is the most effective prgram for quitting, and my new girl doesn't like me smoking, so I'm willing to give it a try."
,utsi,2008-07-03T20:48Z,"I read the book, and it made me quit. Haven't touched the shit in 3.5 years now and I haven't missed it for a minute. I can highly recommend this!"
,octo1,2008-08-29T04:30Z,"Thanks for uploading. I'll seed this for a while. It covers the same ground as the book, but I think it helps reinforce the message. One thing though, the video clips won't play, at least not on my vista machine. Looks like a very old cd-rom with some outdated codec or something. Graphics are fairly crude.

I attended one of his clinics 9 years ago, quit for 6 years, but back on them again. Giving it another go now, maybe I missed something the first time around. Anyway, good luck everyone in getting off the evil weed. "
,splarty,2009-08-29T00:14Z,"Really nice complement to the book!! (Or the Audio book).

For those of you having problems with the video on this cd rom, you can get the correct codecs at: www.moviecodec.com/downloads/31d.html

Enjoy!"
