,7uctus,2008-08-16T04:15Z,"Just a heads up for anyone about to downlaod this.

This software is OVER 10 YEARS OLD, broken, unsupported and doesn't follow the c++ standard. Don't use it!

Microsoft has released free versions of their latest development environments at http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/"
,damncrow,2009-02-13T01:52Z,And who the f*ck cares if it's unsupported and old? People have a good reason not to f*ck with bloated .NET and get things done.
,Lonepup,2009-03-22T18:46Z,"I agree damncrow! Not everyone in the world has a Quad core processor & running vista. These older progs will still run on pretty much any computer & OS. It simply amazes me with some of the peeps on TPB... I wrote that this was a 1998 reliable image, and some clown posts a warning not to d/l because it's an older version."
,Moogly3090,2009-05-04T00:45Z,"Thanks very much, was looking for this, cause I'm sick of VC++.NET upgrading my files when I don't want them to be crapped up... Especially C projects..."
,Iamazn,2009-07-09T02:51Z,"Error executing cl.exe
How to fix?"
,Marial6,2009-11-14T08:47Z,"thanks

,stationmiek,2009-11-25T20:09Z,All of the universities in the UK use this version - a good reason to download!
,REiN67rus,2009-12-30T11:14Z,"stationmiek, All of the universities in the Russian Federation use this version - a good reason to download!"
,italianblaze,2010-02-11T18:38Z,BECAUSE RUSSIA IS POOR ! LMAO JP
,Lonepup,2010-04-02T21:22Z,(:-D
,IceyJoke,2010-04-22T10:10Z,OMG  well  visual c++6 is not good as 2008 or latest but c++ has a good non profit group of milion of programmers that tribute theyr libraries for making c++ better every day and 2008 comes with .Net and is not soo good as c++ 6.better programmers understand that c++is not a low level progrraming language but not too high its a good for programming with api and ASM The perfect langage wil be c++ standard not with framework and other curses.Read wikipedia is the last resort for noobs or try to learn Qt or VB .Net noobs fu**kers if u want a well understanding language for noobs like some above...
,IceyJoke,2010-04-22T10:15Z,and one more thing  7uctus if u like.Net or the new update you can work with visual c++ better 6  than visual c++ 2010 if u have the propper libraryes if u cannot make yourself some... find free on web noobs
,supanut2000,2010-08-16T14:00Z,"@7uctes
Fuck you...don't warn people not to dl this cause it's old...there is this thing called compatibility issues...people want to make their progs work on win95/98/nt4...it's their reasons to use this thing...I'm about to download this...
Also some collectors like me want to get this because they want to see how it develops...
Like some people says, not everyone has and amd64 pc+win7 64bit+20GB of ram...think what if that people live in a poor country where he/she only have a 486 comp with 256MB of ram with win98...?
Well for those people then this version probably works best for them...
Get some information before posting dumb stuff...grow up..."
,Echew,2010-08-28T20:09Z,Haha what does that twat 7uctus mean VC++ 6 doesn't follow the c++ standard?? Guess he means the *new* .Net standard of creating bloated managed apps. Amirite?
,Lonepup,2011-09-21T01:46Z,"(Summer '11) Well - now the US is going broke, and several countries in Europe are in financial trouble as well. Makes this little App. look more appealing now!"
,RobMarks,2011-11-23T03:52Z,">(Summer '11) Well - now the US is going broke, and several countries in Europe are in financial trouble as well. Makes this little App. look more appealing now! 

LOL"
,sujayg,2012-01-13T16:19Z,THE BEST VISUAL C++ ide ever developed by Microsoft. This comment is from a person who has used VC++ 1.5 up to Visual Studio 2010. KEEP THIS ALIVE .
