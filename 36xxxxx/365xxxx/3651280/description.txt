                              ( Disc 2 of 2 )

Teatime. 1968. In millions of homes in England something strange was happening
and TV comedy around the world would never be the same again - 'Do Not Adjust
Your Set'. Hitting audiences like a wet fish in the face it was weird,
wonderful and above all hilarious. 'Do Not Adjust Your Set' combined the
writing and performing skills of Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin,
added a dash of David Jason, a dollop of the legendary Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band
and a hint of Terry Gilliam. Feast your eyes on the madness and discover how
something completely different began....

Originally planned as a children's show 'Do Not Adjust Your Sets' soon gained
a large adult following. Featuring Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones,
David Jason and Denise Coffey with animations by Terry Gilliam and music
interludes by Neil Innes' Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, the program brought together
some of the great writers and performers who would eventually create Monty
Python.
