About The Mellow Bright Band
Myspace Layouts The Mellow Bright Band brings you pure rock n roll with a lot of energy and soul. We are five individuales with one common musical goal - to write great and memorable songs, that will grasp your conscience right from the start, and perform them like there is no tomorrow. Our influences are too many to mention. It?s a diverse mix reaching all the way back to the pop roots of the 60?s beat invasion, via the new wave and punk bands of the 70?s and 90?s Britpop to latter days bands like the Strokes, the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys. The just realesed CD with gems like Song to Mr P and City of slumber gives you a tastefull appetizer of the band. Hopefully we will also be able to bring you our music live. The best chance to get the full live experience of The Mellow Bright Band will be on the 12:th of july at The Arvika festival. See you all there... Enjoy and stay Mellow!
