This is my 109th WORKING game release.

If you have a problem, STATE IT. Leave as much detail to the problem as you can.

Simply stating 'dont work' does you or anyone else zero good.

ALL 109 of my games work. So state a problem and maybe you will get an answer.

i have an AMD 3000+, 2gb and a 6800 GT

any advice?

Try reading the comments under it. The only part that sucks is there'e like 100 comments to read and I'm not sure anyone discovered the 'true' culprit to the error.
 I will look in to it more myself and see what I come up with. For now though mate try reading the comments under the one in the top 100. I think its the one listed thee. Maybe you find something that can help. Also does the 6800gt support shader version 3.0? I think it may, I have the 7600gt, without a problem, of course drivers are up to date yeah? Anyhow, let me see whtaI come up wit. A nice request for help such as yours will always get me to help all I can, will get back to ya on it for sure mate.

,MarcusAurelius1,2008-01-20T10:19Z,"QUESTION ABOUT SOUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This game from Dopeman works, and I have 'finished' the game sort of. I have a few issues though. 

The game seems to have a lot of bugs, i heard the PC version of SCDA sucks because of this, so i assumed all the bugs came with the game, and not from Dopeman. 

However, I have played the xbox360 version of the game, and one of the biggest things i noticed is that there's a very tense and palpitating soundtrack that plays continuously, and the palpitation increases and becomes more intense whenever the player gets closer and closer to the enemy. 

Yet when i played the PC version from Dopeman, there's no such soundtrack at all, I played the whole game basically without music (except in a few cutscenes). So what the hell, i think the music is completely indispensable to this game. Is the lack of music in the PC version due to Dopeman, or just because the PC version sucks? 

Anyone else notice this?!?!?!?!?

,wscarblade,2008-01-26T08:59Z,Super excited with this game...please guys...seed..thnx
,MightyGuru,2008-01-26T11:51Z,"Another great rip, Dopeman. Game runs smoothly and no technical bugs or problems.

I do wonder however if you intentionally ripped the upgraded gadgets out of the game or ripped the wrong version or something. Like ripped some sort of equipping screen before every mission. Because even after I complete the required missions for the gadgets they seem to be unaccessable. Also this seems to lack 1680x1050 resolution, but that might be just because this is a console game ported to PC. And this is going to the side of nitpicking but I'm not allowed to change a few controls in this, like the inventory and whistling, but this one might be down to stupid devs too, though.

Other than that great rip. The game itself though is a bit too linear for my taste. Earlier Splinter Cells have been more open."

,Beatsta,2008-02-01T05:45Z,"REVIEWED: ALL CASES ARE FINAL

Status: Will work perfect on computers over 2.0Ghz.
Information: As it is a RIP, it can be simply UnRARed, and extracted to a folder. Now, to get to the game itself.
Grade: A, 90% working, or 9/10.

SPLINTER CELL DOUBLE AGENT:

Graphics: 9/10 Almost Perfect!
Sound: 10/10 From Shootout moments to sneaky moments, you will be stunned on how the sound is.
Storyline: 8/10 Great, but it is different from the PS2/Wii version.
Overall: 9/10"

,KidD34TH,2008-03-07T18:27Z,"Game is a fake, the actual game install is about 7.8 GB.  The download is 1.97GB?  Even with compression, I highly doubt you'll turn about 8GB into (my math sucks) 1/4th that.

Hammer down, your game is a fake.  It's not complete, and that's why you get all these runtime errors.  That is why you run into all these problems.

When you install the game from the -real- DVD, it installs the version of DirectX that is uses, so basically it reinstalls DirectX for you.  That's why you get more than half the errors as well.


Dopeman, your release sucks.  I'm not even downloading it because I have the real DVD."
,TraNsm3t,2008-03-13T15:08Z,"@Above, The size is becasue it is compressed using 7-Zip, and unzipped it it around 6.9GB. This is Singleplayer only, unless you know a friend with Double Agent or you find a really good keygen. So cut the crap out and stick to the real DVD's.

This game runs perfectly, me and three other friends downloaded this game, and It worked for all of us.


keep the good work up dopeman."
,slayerar,2008-03-21T20:45Z,Ok dope i have 8600GT and i dunno what shreder it has also 2.10 Athlon dual like 4200 total + 2000 ram and i run ur Chaos theory no problems on max all shit and when i start this one it does run but there's this slow like playing in slow motion any ideas cose i really dig splinter cell oO
,SoulCheese,2008-03-23T19:21Z,"So disappointing...
First of all, I get the C++ Buffer Overrun Detected! bullshit, and no ""To get ride of the must check error and every other error u must update/upgrade ur directx 0.9c "" doesn't work. Nothing so far works, the error doesn't even seem to be remotely related to DirectX anyways.    ""trust me ppl it well work a 100% after this unless u have a carpy PC ha ha lol well peace out. ""  I do not and your quite ignorant.

The Torrent is good for the people it will work for, what I'M disappointed in is that Dopeman isn't doing shit about it. I can understand using this method so he doesn't have people asking how to Mount and Install and whatnot (which he is NOT obligated to help with), BUT when you do it this way it 'causes MORE problems that HE IS obligated to help with because it's HIS torrents fault, not the user's incompatence.

Even then if anyone knew anything about DirectX it's not easy to just ""reinstall"", I bet the problem was you guys didn't even have the latest version, so installing it worked... lol please people."
,SoulCheese,2008-03-23T19:26Z,"Btw, ""KidD34TH"", you are also an ignorant fool. It's compressed as many people have already explained. 

""it installs the version of DirectX that is uses, so basically it reinstalls DirectX for you""   No it doesn't, it checks if you have the latest version, and if you don't, it COPIES the necessary files and INSTALLS them. And if you DO have the right version, NOTHING happens. NO REINSTALLING OCCURS. 

So if your not going to download it and use it, don't comment on it."
,Destroyer229,2008-04-08T02:45Z,wheres multiplayer? the description said ripped ---> movies and multiplayer!! why is it only singleplayer?! dopeman all your other uploads are amazing but this one just won't work i've updated my direct x and whenever it loads it freezes and then says something about C++ what do i do?!!! has anyone else had this problem if you were able to fix it please tell me how!
,SoulCheese,2008-04-08T19:01Z,"Lol destroyer. You don't know what ""Ripped"" means? There is NO multiplayer or movies. Theres probably no multiplayer because well... it just wouldn't work, UBI or whoever would find out. And movies maybe for the size compression but I don't know, it's his torrent."
,Destroyer229,2008-04-08T19:34Z,"oh i thought by ""ripped"" it meant thats what was uploaded from the cd. is there anyway to get rid of the C++ error? do i need pixel and vertex shader 3.0 to run it in super low settings? i can run chaos theory on almost max settings with no lag will i be able to run DA without pixel and vertex shader 3.0? i have 2.0"

Secondly, I wanted to ask if this one has multiplayer and the high res textures?
I downloaded Dopeman's Chaos Theory Rip and it didn't have multiplayer or training videos and stuff. I'm enjoying singleplayer, but I'd like multiplayer too. I know it doesn't work online, but I want it for LAN.
Does this rip have it? "
,GaMe_HaCeR,2008-07-22T11:09Z,"for u guys/girls that have a buffer overrun error and cannot fix it through options, try to replaces the folder.
1. Extract as usually.
2. Go in to C:\Program Files and make a new Fodler named ""Ubisoft""
3. Then go in to that folder and make another one name SCDA.
4. Now cut out all the files from the TCSCDA unpacked folder and place it into the SCDA.

I really hope that works because it did for me :).
all those who says that dopemans releases doesnt work are an bunch or rtards, because 90% of the times there is such a small error like this.
Happy gaming yall!

1) This torrent DOES NOT have the movies. Which basically tell you the plot, so yeah, pretty much makes it a useless torrent just cause of this exclusion. 

2) This rip CANNOT be patched. It's a 1.0 rip and the latest patch 1.02a removes the securom protection and the older patches even added Anti Aliasing option in the menu apart from fixing bugs (this game has a lot of them). So another reason to get the DVD version of this game.


Apart from all this, the game in this rip works fine. If you aren't concerned with story and shitload of uggly ass jaggies without AA, go ahead and just use this torrent. As for me, I am going back to the DVD version and installing the new patch. Have fun."

Rename the folder containing all the info to Splinter Cell Double Agent (Not sure if the name really matters, didn't test it) Create a Ubisoft folder in Program Files if there isn't one already and move the Splinter Cell folder into there.

basically a patch needs the installation directory of the game and it finds it through registry. all you have got to do is make a key for it (windows 7)it works for others too
1.enter regedit in the search bar
2.now select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE 
3.expand it
4.select SOFTWARE and expand it
5.now right-click on software and select New>key,now name the key as Ubisoft
6.make a new key by righclicking on ubisoft,name it ""Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent""
7.now right click on the blank space on the right
select New>String value.name it as InstallDir
now open it and write C:\TCSCDA where ""C""  is the drive where you have copied the game and""TCSCDA""is the name of the game folder 
8.click ok and you are done! 
you can install  both the 1.01 and 1.02 patch this way

I just get the crashes to desktop while loading randomly. Save your patience and just get the xbox version. Once again, pc owners get shitted on. And ubisoft = SHIT!!! No patch, no crack, no file fixes, no reg fixes, nothing can stop this game from fucking up so far. AND IT'S FUCKING 4 YEARS OLD!! I can't believe ubisoft never came up with a real fix for this (could have been) awesome game. 10 stars for the xbox version and a big pile of horse shit for the pc version. Don't believe me, just google it and you'll see that there are no apparent fixes for the random desktop crashes. Thanks anyway dopeman!! All the others work great from you. You never made a rip for the first splinter cell that I know of though. I really wanted to finish this game too before conviction came out.

,Sick3r,2011-04-01T15:11Z,Om du är svensk kan ja tala om att webhallen.com har splinter cell trilogin (de 3 första spelen) för bara 39 kr. Beställde den igår fick den idag. Älskar splinter cell så det var mer än värt pengarna. =D
,Killerrez,2011-04-03T01:34Z,"I have an odd one, My Vcard isn't good only 128mb (ouch) of dedicated graphic memory and for some reason (only one this game) I can't change my graphics settings it's really bugging me. I know that your stuff is good (considering I just got done with your rip of SP3) and I really want to play it with out it lagging so bad. (and with out getting a new graphics card I'm hopefully getting one soon) Anyway it would be cool if you could help and if you can't I'll have to wait until I  can get a new card. Thanks."
,insoc_cr,2011-04-06T21:45Z,"for u guys/girls that have a buffer overrun error and cannot fix it through options, try to replaces the folder.
1. Extract as usually.
2. Go in to C:\Program Files and make a new Fodler named ""Ubisoft""
3. Then go in to that folder and make another one name SCDA.
4. Now cut out all the files from the TCSCDA unpacked folder and place it into the SCDA.

I really hope that works because it did for me :).
all those who says that dopemans releases doesnt work are an bunch or rtards, because 90% of the times there is such a small error like this.
Happy gaming yall!

oh and another thing, for those who get the ****MUST CHECK**** thingy, be sure you start it with the Launcher because i get the must check error if i would try to start it with the SplinterCell4.exe file "

For those having the RUNTIME ERROR you need to install DirectX 9C which you can get from here http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35 BUT Windows 7 runs DirectX 11 by default so be warned newly released games might not work after.
