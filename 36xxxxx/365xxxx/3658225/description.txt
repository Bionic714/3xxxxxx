What is BayGenie?

Have you ever lost a bid on eBay because someone else put a
higher bid at the last seconds? Placing a bid just before the
auction ends, also known as "sniping", is a strategy a lot of
eBay bidders use to win an auction.

BayGenie automatically snipes eBay bids. It is a Windows
application that automates the process of placing bids on an eBay
item at the closing time of the auction. With its seamless eBay
integration, you can login to eBay and search for items using its
integrated internet browser. Once you've found an item that you
are interested, you can add it to your watch list and setup how
long before the end of the auction you want BayGenie to place
your bid. Then all you have to do is sit back and relax, or do
whatever you want. BayGenie will automatically place the bid for
you, even if it's 3am in the morning.

BayGenie tracks eBay auctions. It also contains an auction
tracking system that tracks all the items that you are watching,
bidding, won or lost. It shows important information for each
item, such as the current highest bidding amount, ending time,
etc. It also supports multiple users so that different eBay users
can use the same BayGenie without affecting each other.
