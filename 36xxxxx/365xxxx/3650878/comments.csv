,c.biyuan,2009-05-09T19:57Z,"I'm curious why shyatthechemist wouldn't think a discography could fit in a GB. Most albums are well under 100MB.

This is great; thanks bubostar!"
,chazoul,2009-06-16T07:36Z,"shyatthechemist is RIGHT.
The quality isn't good enough even encoded @ 202kbps.

STAY AWAY."

The quality is really poor! The person who ripped these albums is truly incompetent. I wish I had them all, then I would rip them and put them up!"
