,MIB*IZZY*SSM,2007-04-09T18:00Z,Sorry about that I am new to torrents. I accidently double posted. I don't know how to remove the other one.
,MIB*IZZY*SSM,2007-04-09T18:20Z,"If anyone downloading this needs any help with herc configurations or setting up your vehicles you can get help at www.ssmods.com. IF you join online and the servers don't seem to have many in them; There are alot of people that play at night in the CAN server. I hope all of you join us. This is truly the best game ever. I have been playing it since 1999 and never played anything else.. ever. And we are fixing to come out with a all new workover for the game. New tanks, hercs, flyers, shapes, etc... My promise to you is if you download this and play it... you will never quit playing it... IF you need training look me up in the servers. "
,MIB*IZZY*SSM,2007-04-10T18:56Z,Quick Important Note. If you have any trouble with the game running on your computer then naviate to C:\Dynamix\Starsiege and add the registry settings manually. You will see a file that says reginfo. Click on that and click yes when prompted. It just adds the registry keys for Starsiege to your computer registry. Sometimes on some computers Starsiege will crash for no reason. Follow the above directions will remedy the situation. Thanks SOO much for downloading this and helping this game stay alive. 
,MIB*IZZY*SSM,2007-04-11T18:17Z,"Ok if for any reason the desktop icon doesn't work for this download go to C:\Dynamix\Starsiege and click on starsiege.exe in that folder. I've been getting complaints the desktop icon doesn't work. 
Thanks Iz."
