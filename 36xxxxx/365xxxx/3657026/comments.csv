,Faith_less,2007-04-07T11:44Z,And what about bitrate?
,Wonderstuff,2007-07-07T11:49Z,"Bitrate is zero.one, stupidfuck. Get a life: lotr1950 offers us a beautiful torrent, which we all will get for free, but some stupid uses MUST have a certain bitrate or whatever - otherwise they'll complain. What's more important, the content/the actual albums or the bitrate? Thanks for all the great stuff you put out, lotr1950, fast downloads and good quality - no complaints from me at all."
