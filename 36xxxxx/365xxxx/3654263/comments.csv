,reichert,2007-04-04T03:27Z,"
...read, before you complain.. the man said about disk2  ""2.disc: 05/04/2007""

"
[V],Kuthumi,2007-04-04T07:45Z,It would be nice if the uploader could clarify in English if the whole film is on disc number 1.
,Para.Dics.OM,2007-04-04T08:41Z,"Kuthumi:
The Movie = 177min
Disc 1 = 87 min (first half of the movie)
Disc 2 = 90 min (second half of the movie)
Is this O.K.?
Coming soon disc 2 = 22:00 (CET) 05/04/2007

,Para.Dics.OM,2007-04-04T19:25Z,"Please Please stay in seed!!

...Very good idea Para.Dics.OM  to block the IP of those selfish guys which disconnect or stop seeding as son the have completed  just there own copy. "
,trica,2007-04-05T23:24Z,Labels for this film. Disk 1 and disk 2.
,reichert,2007-04-15T10:47Z,"

...Look, more then 20 times downloaded, but less then 4 seeders, how selfish! no wonder the seeding get so slow... Man, you got here something for free, so just give something back and seed at least for a couple of days longer....

[V],Kuthumi,2008-01-31T19:09Z,"Thank you very much for these good quality discs. However, I have never seen such a case of hit-and-runs. Please seed to 1.0 ratio. I have only an upload speed of kB/s and cannot be the only seeder for 2 full dvds."
