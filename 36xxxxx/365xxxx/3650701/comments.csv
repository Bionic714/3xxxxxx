,Griezel,2007-08-02T01:58Z,One of my favourite movies! Been looking for the soundtrack/music since ancient times!!! I hope this torrent stays active. Thank you so much!!!!!
,JZMKLZ,2008-07-22T13:54Z,Wow. I truly appreciate the upload. I owned this on cassette back when it first came out.
,TypoDemon,2008-09-14T00:34Z,":3 you're welcome.
and if all else fails and it doesn't stay active I'll just .. reupload it lol.
I really like Piratebay so I'm always around somewhere."
,blyfoten_,2009-08-12T00:15Z,It's missing the Trioxin theme!
,kissfan77,2009-11-26T23:38Z,cheers for this one...i've had it for yonks on vinyl and love the 45 Grave toon...
,Kanano,2010-01-11T08:51Z,"SERIOUSLY? I'm getting this from two people at 2 - 3 kb a second!?



That's just flat disgraceful seeding. I've had movie torrent with only four people behind it that had a speed of over 300kb! All around, it's gonna take me 6 - 7 hours to download 32 mb! 



Right now, I'm seeding a Creepshow 1 torrent at 70 kbs and a Carnosaur 2 torrent at 26 kbs. Both are on high speed so it's the downloaders fault for not going higher. Most of my torrents are always at high speeds. This is just ridiculous. 



I do however thank the uploader for uploading this, as I've been wanting to hear these songs in their entirety for awhile now. I just hate the slow speed! "
,Kanano,2010-01-11T12:44Z,"lol nvm, I found a much better torrent then this crap. Has the soundtrack AND movie. All around, it took me five minutes to download the soundtrack, whereas this one still had an hour and a half left to go. Great job keeping your torrent alive typo, we appreciate it. 



Here's the link to the other torrent:



http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4346708/Return_of_the_Living_Dead%5B1985%5D_-_Movie__amp__Soundtrack




Download that instead of this, it'll take you forever to get this, and five minutes to get the other one. Why is this even still up?"
