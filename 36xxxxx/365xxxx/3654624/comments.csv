Hoppas på denna."
,Miiqu,2007-04-04T13:58Z,"sounds, source ?

Man this movie was even better i could have ever hoped for. Every man should watch this film, this is definately not for chicks.

Leonidas: Dilios, I trust that ""scratch"" hasn't made you useless.
Dilios: Hardly, my lord, it's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare. 

after weeks of watching this, im still cracking at that."
,theaceman,2007-04-04T22:39Z,Perfect quality. Thanks Arcus.
,Miiqu,2007-04-05T12:14Z,Perfect Quality ? Far from perfect i'd say. This is one of the 300 releases (neptunes perhaps) encoded to DVD.
,arcus4451,2007-04-05T13:08Z,"I belive it says ""I encode them so you don't have to."" meaning so u dont have to encode the rls to DVD Format . = - )"
