Plot:	Chiang is an undercover agent who mistakingly murders Lung's gangster godfather at the behest of a treacherous and ambitious right hand man to the godfather, Lung must seek revenge against Chiang who acually saves Lung's life in the end.

Overview:	David Chiang is superb in this one. A kung fu expert with a bad cough who must batle the great Lueng at the end of the movie. Lueng, who was in John Woo's "A Better Tomorrow", plays a carefree streetfighter who must do batle with the establishment and of course David Chiang who was brought in to deal with Lueng. The final batle between Chiang and Lueng in the rain at the end is fantastic, very well staged. And the ladies will love the tattooed butterfly on Lueng's chest, a symbol of his love for his lovely lady. I strongly recommend this one. It's a must see.
