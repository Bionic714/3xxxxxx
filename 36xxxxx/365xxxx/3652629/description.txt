| THE MACHINIMA COLLECTION 2006 |
=================================

ABOUT THE COLLECTION
--------------------
This two Video-DVDs were part of my results of my master-thesis. They represent an overview of machinima and all its possibilities. Today they are little bit outdatet, as they were finished in early 2006, but they still contain many of the defining machinima movies.
Along with the DVDs you can find my written thesis as PDF in this torrent. Sadly only in german, but I'm working on it. This thesis also contains all the metadata for the movies.

ABOUT THE CONTENT AND FORMATS
-----------------------------
All the movies that are part of the DVDs are freely available on the internet. This DVDs are just a much more convenient way to watch them. A good start to find the originals and many more movies would be http://machinima.com and http://archive.org also hosts many machinimas.

The DVDs in this torrent are in the .iso-format, so they should be easy to burn. They are true Video-DVDs, with menus and everything, and therefore can be played in every DVD-Player.

THANKS
------
My thanks goes to all the fine people that create machinimas, so that I could write about and enjoy viewing their movies.

ABOUT SEEDING
-------------
My bandwidth is quite limited and I'm not online 24/7, so please be patient while I'm uploading. And please do your sharing part! Seed until at least 1:1. More ist highly appreciated - and the movies are worth it.
