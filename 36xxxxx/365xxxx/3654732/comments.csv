,I_QBot,2007-04-04T18:46Z,Well... Maybe not  lol
,I_QBot,2007-04-04T18:47Z,AVG shows multiple embedded Trojans in the security files.
,I_QBot,2007-04-04T23:37Z,"Yes, I did read, but AV scanners typically label these types as exploits, not a specific Trojan. AVG comes up with six different specific Trojans. HELLOOOOO...  Use at your own peril...

,RBFM,2007-04-14T21:12Z,"[Also please note that programs from the security folder will be flagged as dangerous by most antiviral programs. These are not viruses but can be dangerous if used incorrectly.]

Security software will get antivirus progs buzzing!

I have security audit software, I have to tell my antivirus prog to ignore it!

At least Nem gave you the above warning!"
,obliza,2008-08-14T15:41Z,Why do virus programs tell you to disable other virus programs? Because they detect each other as viruses. this is not a virus good torrent.
