Very funny old DOS-game. Worth to try. Buil your own machine with guns, cats, motors, robes, etc. Everything you need.

Guide:

You can use DOSBOX wich is a DOS-simulator, but i can run it without that. I have windows XP pro.
There is no need for installati
on, just doubleclick on TIM.exe. (It will look a little funny on a widescreen)
