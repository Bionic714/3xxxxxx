link to no-cd patch above
but you can keep the game mounted and play it anyway  "
,fhbwgahds,2007-04-04T22:21Z,How do I install this? what programs do I need?
,simmen6,2007-04-06T10:42Z,you need a mouning software(alcohol or DAEMON TOOLS)! Then you could just play it like an ordinary game. If you download the nocd patch and install it you can uninstall the mounting software later.
,RevoZ,2007-04-07T05:50Z,"I downloaded this, mounted The Sims.MDS/MDF with Alcohol 120%, and now when i put the CD in it freezes my disk drive and i have to restart my computer.

,drift_punk,2007-04-18T06:27Z,"Why is it so rare to find a helpful comment anywhere? People make things complicated or just write stupid garbage. 

simmen, great upload, thanks for that...

But... you can't play it mounted. You need a no-cd patch. Not sure why, but you do. 

Also people, .NFO FILES (A.K.A MSInfo Document files found in most torrents) ARE IMPORTANT!!! READ THEM BY DOING THIS!!!

Windows Vista/XP/2000 users: 

Right click on the .NFO file and scroll down to Open With >

Click on Choose Program

Find notepad and highlight it.

Click on the little white box beside ""Always use the selected program to open this kind of file.""

Click OK

Then, whenever you download a torrent, read the .NFO file by double clicking on it BEFORE POSTING STUPID QUESTIONS HERE!!!!!

For all other windows platforms, see DevilboyScooby comments below. "
,drift_punk,2007-04-18T06:34Z,"Correction: See DevilboyScooby comments above.

Didn't want anyone getting confused by my earlier comment ""see DevilboyScooby comments below.""

To many idiots here who take things way to literally. 

So go up to find his comment. 

Now some of you may think I'm mean, but I've seen more stupidity from users of this site in the last six months that I've been here then I have from my 2nd Grade students in my 9 years of teaching. "

Just mount the game in Daemon Tools, install, then open the ""INFO+serial"" in notepad when prompted by the Sims installer file. Copy paste the serial into the Sims installer. After the installation is complete you can run the program.

I just downloaded and installed and it is working great."

,-k0k0-,2011-02-05T15:47Z,"For those who have no idea how to mount an image file nor are familiar with those terms:
You can just burn the file to a CD/DVD and assuming you know how to do that, you just need to make one tiny tweak in order to play the game since it will give an error otherwise.

1. Burn and install the game. 

2. Follow this link http://www.filefront.com/904627/sims11eu.zip

3. Download that file and unzip it. Unzip it. You can do that by right-clicking on it and selecting 'Extract Here'. After extraction, a blue sims file will appear.

4. Open the folder in which you have Sims installed. 
It's usually in the C drive> Program Files> Maxis> The Sims so follow that path and go there.

5. Copy and paste the downloaded file in The Sims folder. It will ask you whether you want to replace the already existing file or not. Click 'Yes' and replace. 

You can now start playing the game. Just tried it out myself."
