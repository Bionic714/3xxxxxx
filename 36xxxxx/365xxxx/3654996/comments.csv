The mind control genre has to be sold for it to work; ten seconds of waving a pendant in front of the female detective did not sell me on her being under. As with erotic stories of this type, it takes some time to properly introduce a believable story or scene. Way too much ""mistress renee"" crap also; the two female subjects say it repeatedly even when it is not appropriate or called for.
On the positive, the women are attractive; however, the sex is pretty lacking with too much talk.
D/L if you are exploring; probably not if you are a MC fan."
