,Sarre,2007-04-04T10:53Z,Thank you so much for using a sane encoder. I'm sick and tired of 32kbit/s mp3 encodes that sound like utter shite.
,Sarre,2007-04-04T12:44Z,".. but sadly you've compressed these too hard. If you can't hear the difference from CD, either the source material is bad (unlikely), or your hearing must be questioned. That ""CELPy"" high-freq garbling is pretty marked."
,Furazela,2007-04-05T00:40Z,"My hearing has been called to question previously, but I really can't hear any difference.
As for the original it has normal CD quality, which is noticeably lower than DVD quality on high frequency sounds, and Kate Reading has a fairly high-pitched voice.
If you pick a track I can upload it as flac, so you can compare."
