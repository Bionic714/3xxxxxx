This is New Spring, the first (and so far only) prequel to Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time, read by Kate Reading and Michel Kramer.
This is the full unabridged version including a bonus interview with Robert Jordan (though that one is quite lame).

I bought the CDs because I couldn't find a download that wasn't broken in one way or another, and thought I should share. I've listened through the entire recording to make sure everything worked just fine.
The files are of better quality than any other ripped audio book I've found, I don't even hear any difference compared to the CD when listening on my high-def stereo (except the loss of the buzz from the CD drive, that is).
The small file size is due to the use of the speech optimized codec Ogg Speex rather than MP3, and is not due to compromised quality. The drawback is limited support on mobile devices. If your device doesn't support Ogg Speex you can always reencode it to MP3. File size will increase sevenfold (assuming 128kbit) but you'll still get decent audio quality, and no gaps/jumps/spikes/other disturbances.

MPlayer and VLC should work out of the box, for Windows Media Player download the Directshow Filters from http://www.illiminable.com/ogg
