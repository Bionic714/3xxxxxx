This is a game which many call Age of Empires III, but is not.
However, if you have played Age of Empires II, you will find this to be almost exactly same as it.
Innumerable similarities are there.

Most units and technologies have many parllels in age of empires II.
But there are some differences as well, which does make it a world apart, notably the presence of air units.

The game follows the theme of star wars and has some campaigns in it which are extracts of the story of star wars.

A very remarkable game
This is a must have for those fans of AOE II who are crazy about Star Wars.

And lots of fun for those who like strategy games.

A problem with my copy is that there are no sounds at all :(((((((
I am trying to get one and on finding, will upload it as soon as I get it.
