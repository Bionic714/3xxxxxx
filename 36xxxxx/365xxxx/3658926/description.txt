Xihilisk-\\\"anEP\\\"




\\\\\\\"The new EP from Xihilisk is an astounding affair. It lulls you in with its almost alien textures and then smacks you in the face with giant industrial technology waves. Superb musicianship and an almost painstakingly accurate attention to detail, the future holds no limits for this still relatively young artist. According to his website, the breathtakingly huge \\\\\\\"Gregor! the Blacksmith\\\\\\\" nearly killed his studio setup due to the sheer size of the sound. After hearing it, I find that highly believable. This is years ahead of its time, and unlike anything you\\\\\\\'ve ever heard before. 5/5 \\\\\\\"
