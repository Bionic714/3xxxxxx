Brooklyn duo Project Jenny, Project Jan, a band that Billboard called a \"shockingly dynamic, danceable and hilarious affair,\" is an undertaking that is constantly evolving. Consisting of Jeremy Haines (vocalist) and Sammy Rubin (programmer/keyboardist), the band takes the listener on an unexpected journey through genres: at times, pop-infused rock is pummeled with homespun dance beats; while quieter moments reveal the band?s thoughtful, and artful tendencies. 

Through one self-released EP, the band has managed to showcase a range of styles without ever sounding derivative. Project Jenny, Project Jan is poised to energize the indie soundscape and rearrange dance floors with its vibrant sound.
