Both the lyrics and the video generated controversy for Jackson.
The original version of the song brought accusations of Jackson being anti-Semitic because of the following lyrics:

Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me.

He responded to these allegations by insisting that he did not mean to offend any member of the Jewish community and that some of his
best friends were Jewish and that racism was never in his heart. He also explained in his letter to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)
that the song was meant to demonstrate the hatefulness of racism, anti-Semitism and stereotyping. He said: "My intention was for this song
to say 'no' to racism, anti-Semitism and stereotyping. I intend to include, in all albums that have not been shipped as of this date,
the above paragraph so that no one can listen to my music and misconstrue my intentions. Just the idea that my lyrics could offend
and hurt anyone's feelings is extremely painful to me."
Still under pressure, Jackson then tried to prove his good intentions as he withdrew HIStory from the market, altered the controversial
words and re-released it on his own expense.
The original music video for the song showed Jackson singing the song in a prison. MTV took the video off its playlist because it showed
scenes of violence. Jackson and video director Spike Lee did another version of the video set in Brazil.
Other sources claim that "The original music video, which was shot in March, on the streets of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil was reportedly
not 'entirely
satisfactory' to Michael's liking, so a second music video, the 'Prison Version', was made a week later. However ironically this new music
video was
banned in some countries due to complaints that it was too violent, and on both MTV and VH1 it was only allowed to be shown after the 9 o'clock
watershed."
