Editor Donald Kelly has probably communicated with more people involved in the "free energy" field than any other person in the world. In his classic compilation work The Manual of Free Energy Devices and Systems (1991) he describes the viability and progress of each device from Nikola Tesla to present. Also mentioned are many of the various spinoff inventions as a result of "free energy" research. The manual includes copies of patents, diagrams, illustrations and notes of the many people involved in the most critical research of our time. Contrary to the outmoded opinion of many well established physicists, these various units and systems are here and now, events which will continue to be improved upon until a "new wave" of applied energy physics is in place, and the old beliefs and views fall by the wayside. A great introduction to many new ideas, how they have developed and which might one day power the whole world. 130 pages, many pictures and drawings. A must read for everyone.
