,Bloody_Marry,2009-08-28T10:35Z,Thank you - for the upload and a BIG thanks to the makers of these programs! Can anyone upload only the music? 
,AveryWeb,2010-11-13T00:09Z,"Demonoid is still running but you need to have an account with them and registrations are currently closed.

The only way to register with them is if you have an invitation code.

This really ticks me off cause they are the only ones I can find volume 9 of this series  lol.

If anyone has an account there could you please download volume 9 and upload it here.

If I can get that file I can then upload the full 13 volumes here plus the 4 volumes in the baby signing collection!

At that point I can start to track down series 2 that has another 13 volumes."
,AveryWeb,2010-11-26T15:19Z,"The full collection is now available here!

I got into Demonoid and downloaded vol 9  woo hoo

All 13 plus the 4 for Bbay signing time are now available for download.
