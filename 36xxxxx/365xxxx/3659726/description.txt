Protecting the Earth Summit is going to be even tougher than Kwame, Wheeler, Linka, Gi, and Ma-Ti had planned.  In this two-part episode, for the only time in the entire series, all seven of the evil Eco-Villains have joined forces: Dr. Blight, Verminous Skumm, Duke Nukem, Hoggish Greedly, Looten Plunder, Sly Sludge, and Zarm.  Their goal?  Subvert the Earth Summit, weaken the environment, destroy Gaia, and conquer the world.  And not all the power of Captain Planet can stop them...but maybe, just maybe, things can be changed with the help of an old ally...
