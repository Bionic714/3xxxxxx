PLOT..............: Early  this  fall,   the  international  community   mourned  the premature loss of animal expert and conservationist Steve  Irwin, "The Crocodile Hunter." The world was stunned and the  outpouring of condolences was  immeasurable. Irwin touched  so many lives  ? adults  and  children  alike -  and  his  impact on  conservation efforts worldwide will last for years to come.

Irwin is  joined by  explorer and  adventurer Philippe  Cousteau, grandson of the famous oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, in Ocean's Deadliest as  they explore  the waters  between Australia's  Gold Coast and  the Great  Barrier Reef.  Throughout this  expedition, Philippe and  Steve come  face to  face with  venomous fish, huge great  white  sharks  and amazing  saltwater  crocodiles  as they search for the region's most dangerous animal.

Along the  way, they  will meet  the scientific  experts who work with these creatures on a regular basis, learning the reason  why they have evolved with such dangerous defenses and also  learning that, in truth, they fill a role in the overall ecosystem that is vital and cannot be overlooked.

Their  adventure  features  amazing  and  breathtaking   moments, including subduing a  giant croc in  order to attach  a satellite tracking  device; observing  the feeding  behavior of  the great white  shark while  safely tucked  away inside  a dive  cage and working with the Australian experts who capture deadly sea snakes in order to supply anti-venom to the rest of the world. Cousteau, who was aboard Croc One with Irwin during the expedition when  he was struck and killed by a stingray, narrates the documentary.
