Can you say you will ever achieve anything in your lives sn3p and drteeth? I think not."

,6IvXTscx,2008-10-13T19:00Z,"Doing a job that look to you as fool hardy doesn't mean that he/she is playing. There are many professions and scientific achievements (that benefits us all) that are at some level life treatning. And even if you do everything ""by the book"" you can still get hurt. I am sure that not me or anyone else are playing with our lives. Steve was a pro in what he did but this misfortunate event took him away. As mrmagoo2u2 said most of us will never achive anything close to what Steve had done. We Honor You Steve. R.I.P."
