Still a great game - a favourite classic 

To Play: 1. Unzip but do not install
         
         2. 2-click on \"SW1EPRCR\" icon to launch game from stored location

There are other (more complicated) ways to use this but the above method works fine and all the save files etc work.

Notes: 1. This game does not work on one of my PCs (a newer one) probably due to bios settings 

       2. Messing with the sound settings may cause a crash! (program crash)

           
Enjoy this superb game!
