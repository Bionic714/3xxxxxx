,Crusader66,2007-04-07T09:00Z,"I have been looking for this for so long Dude. They just haven't made any games like it since. I can't wait to see what it looks like on my new system. I might need to go buy a flight stick again. 
Thank you! "
,strangebru,2007-04-07T20:31Z,the game now works perfectly on newer PC - disabling the shadow option in the bios fixed it - try this if you have a problem
,riotfishy,2007-04-08T23:32Z,"could anyone give me a walk-thru comment here on how to disable the sahdow option in the bios?and yes,how to get to the bios as well ;) computers and me arent friends yet.Thanks..and thnaks for the torrent man!!!
the game works perfectly for me ..until the pod-race :P"
,Baz70,2007-04-09T14:55Z,"You`ll have to re-start your machine...and while it is re-booting, keep hitting the DEL (delete) key.
You`ll be presented with the BIOS menu then, but since most menues are ""customized"" aka different according to manufacturer (of the motherboard) I suggest you search through the menues for your shaddow...but dont change anything youre not sure of tough...lol
Sorry I couldnt be more specific than that but I hope it helps... :)"
,Olle629,2007-06-20T11:17Z,Thanks Everything is perfect

,metal_man_409e,2007-08-13T16:20Z,Doesnt work im afraid. the SWEP1RCR.exe crashes half way through the initial loading screen
,andy2000531,2007-08-16T23:39Z,"Thanks man,love this"
,Chocolate_log,2007-09-06T00:44Z,"Just like to say that this game is class when it works :]. But its not working properly so you can not actually race :[. I am getting the white screen like others described. I have gone into Bios and cannot find anything to do with shadow settings.

System spec:

AMD Athlon 64 3000+
2048Mb RAM
Gainward Bliss 6800GS 512Mb
Gigabyte SLI Mother board
Windows XP 

Can anyone help me out?

Thanks."
,Chocolate_log,2007-09-06T01:14Z,"I have looked into it and this game has issues with Windows XP and some say issues with newer graphics cards as well. Bit of a downer after I got all  excited about playing it again. If anyone finds a solution post it on here plz.

,1Door,2007-09-15T17:32Z,"I have found a solution!!! at least it works at me ;-)

You need a patch which can be downloaded from here: ftp://ftp.lucasarts.com/patches/pc/
Find SWEP1RCR.exe, download it, replace it with the original and it works!!
Maybe you need to run Racercrk, SW_NoVid, SWarPat1, SWarPat2 and Swep1crk, before launching the game.. But you only have to do that one time! Please write if it works :)

Enjoy the game!"
,jayZG,2007-09-24T10:47Z,"It works perfectly on my pc, thanks."
,kaybaz,2008-06-16T23:06Z,"this dude's solution works great.. just don't forget to double click all those files he mentions before playing:

,Lithur,2008-07-13T08:19Z,"I downloaded, unzipped, and ran the file indicated. When I try to change profile, it says ""error loading file"", and if I don't change profile, it says the same thing when the Pod Selection screen comes up.
Then I tried IDoor's solution, downloading the patch and running all the files before launching again. Didn't help at all, still the exact same problem...
Also, I can't find anything about disabling shadows in BIOS."
,hustler539,2009-02-25T06:39Z,"Don't bother with these, I have been searching for this game for awhile now. Seems all these uploaders recycle the same rip. of this game, which was never properly done to begin with.
Why can't people use iso's? If you fnid one in an iso format you should be ok, and let us know about it :D"
,thejellyjam,2009-12-18T00:35Z,"An iso wont work with this game + other old lucasarts games because there's a weird music file image stored on the disc instead of just the music files.

If you can find out how to open mdf files this is the best version -

,ato080,2010-04-27T01:55Z,"Once inside the game, you need to ""create racer,"" a new driver, you.  Be sure this is the active driver.  You CANNOT save games with Anakin as your driver.  Now, back up again and you'll find Settings.  NEVER leave this game without going there and saving ""your name 001"" sequentially.  If you don't, you'll lose any wins or funds you've just won.  You'll have to return here when you play again and load your latest file.

Also, get in the habit of stopping in to ""Buy Parts"" every time you see that screen.  Once inside the sop, press SHIFT+F4+4 and hold it till Anakin bends down, picks something up and puts it in his shirt pocket.  It's probably more money.  You'll need it to keep your racer upgraded.  Shit wears out, ya know!

That should solve your Racer mysteries.  The lucasarts patch DOES work in XP!  Fire Mountain track is a true BITCH!"
,Allyndaar,2010-05-04T17:29Z,"I've downloaded it, got the patch from http://ftp.lucasarts.com/patches/pc/, run Racercrk, SW_NoVid, SWarPat1, SWarPat2 and Swep1crk and any others I could find, and then double-clicked SWEP1RCR... and it comes up with a black screen and an error. 

UNABLE TO CONTINUE ERROR...  Unable to open display for 3D.

Can anyone help with this?"
,ato080,2012-04-08T22:14Z,"All these hackers on TPB and no one can make Racer run on XP.  Plus, Geo. Lucas being anal about upgrading the most liked program.  Sad, ain't it!"
