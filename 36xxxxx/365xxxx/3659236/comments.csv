,bengtcp,2007-04-30T17:49Z,"yeah,what is a hardware code and where to get?"
,sippeangelo,2007-05-02T17:38Z,"Yes it does relly work and this is how you get the ""hardware"" code:

When you've clicked the Next button 2 times and you choose to activate by phone you will see a loooong number in a text box. Just copy and paste all of these numbers into the hardware box in the hack. Don't add any ""-"" or spaces between the numbers."

,Delex2002,2007-06-05T20:46Z,"Okay, this may sound really stupid, but where do I go to to enter the Serial codes? I open up Norton Internet Security and I go to the Antivirus tab and select Renew Now, but it takes me to this website and it doesn't allow me to input a serial number; it just gives me a button that features its different products to buy.

Thanks for your help"

This is for all you dummies who can't figure it out:

It's very simple and similar to alot of other keygen/activation methods. 

Before you start make sure you disconnect your computer from the internet by unpluging your network cable. This is important because you will not be able to activate with the Keygen later on if you are connected to the internet.

When you are first installing NAV 2007 it asks for a serial. Open the Keygen and get it to create one by pressing the Serial ! button. Copy and paste the Serial Number into the install window but leave the Keygen open because you will need it again later. 

This gets the installation started. Follow the prompts to install and when it says to activate click on next twice. It will then ask you if you want to activate by phone etc choose activate by phone and then click next. 

You will come to a window where there will be 6 boxes  of numbers half way down the window. These are the Hardware Code. Copy and paste each set of numbers with no spaces into the hardware code section of the keygen and press Unlock !. This will create an unlock code.

Copy and paste the unlock code into the bottom set of boxes and click next its all done and you will have 3650 days of activation. 

I just installed on XP and this works 100%. 

So if you have followed my instructions and you still don't get it right then you should just buy a license because no-one else will be able to help you."
