Project History

Back in the mid 1950's, nuclear powered cruise missiles were being studied and in 1957, development was initiated as Project Pluto. The reactor for the missile was to be developed by the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, with the ramjet being built by Marquadt. Ling-Temco-Vought was awarded the contract to develop the airframe for the missile itself, which was known as SLAM (Supersonic Low-Altitude Missile).

The mission profile called for SLAM to be launched from hardened silos, propelled by solid rocket boosters up to ramjet ignition speed. SLAM would then cruise at high altitude (35,000ft/10,700m) at Mach 4, where it's range was estimated to be more than 10,000km. This meant the missile could 'loiter' at a fail safe point until it was ordered to either continue to it's target or abort its mission. Over enemy territory it would descend to low level, using TERCOM (Terrain Contour Matching) to find its way to multiple targets.
