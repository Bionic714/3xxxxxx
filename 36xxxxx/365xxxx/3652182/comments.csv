,smumdax,2007-12-02T17:01Z,"or those who think they can't play a .divx file, just do one of these many ""solutions"":

- change the extension to .avi like david1946 did
- right-click and select ""open with"" whatever program you usually use to play videos
- associate the .divx extension to the program you use so that in the future, you directly open them with that program...
- Download the DivX player.
- Ultimately use VLC because it will play virtually _anything_ from mp3 to Quicktime, with FLV and ASF in between and even iso files and EVEN recognize a DVD folder... this is hard to beat!"

It's worth noting that this is an ENGLISH version, swimming amongst a bunch of Swedish files.

Damn Swedes."
