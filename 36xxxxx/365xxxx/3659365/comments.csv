,HangLoose,2007-04-09T11:44Z,"Yeah it have to be Virus, but my Nod32 say nothing.
I came here to ask if someone have tryed to install this on another drive, my C-drive is too small i have 4 scsi-drives, and i use another drive for big progs, this take 400meg casche.
Now i uninstall and forget it, Nasa WorldWind is free and good too."
,HangLoose,2007-04-09T13:26Z,"Uninstalled it, and manually delete all maps created,
then scan c-Drive whith Anti Stealth NOD32 updated today,
 + a full-scan Spyware Doctor updated today.(find nothiong)
I still think my problem is only 1,5gig left on C-drive,
 (this prog. like to have 400-2000meg cache),
 the instruktions say ""install in default folder ,Program Files ...)""
If i installed it in any other ""bigger harddrive"" it maybe work,
 yea it work's nice and i have saved my Kitesurf-spots in jpg-format,
(but my computer turn out to be very very very slow, even after reboot)
 that's why i uninstall. "
