\"This image is a dump Radiant Silvergun for the
Sega Saturn. The region code is Japan as the
game was not released elsewhere. I have dumped
this image myself at low speed from an
original game disc in near-perfect condition
and taken great care to insure the image
file\'s integrity. Nothing is ripped or changed
and it should be a perfect 1:1 copy of the
original game disc.

From Wikipedia...
\"Radiant Silvergun is a vertically scrolling shooter video game, developed by Treasure Co. Ltd. It was released in arcades on the ST-V platform in 1998 and subsequently ported to the Sega Saturn, with added cutscenes by noted animation studio GONZO. The game was not released outside of Japan.

The game is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the \'maximalist\' school of vertical shooter design. (Contrast this with Ikaruga\'s studied minimalism.) It features a unique and innovative weapons system, with seven weapons available at any time. The player has three buttons to control the weapons; the weapon fired depends on the combination of buttons pressed.\"
