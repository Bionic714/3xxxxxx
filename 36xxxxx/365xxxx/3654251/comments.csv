,stef_u,2008-01-12T18:06Z,"Thanks but i can't get the k to work, says some files wont be patched when i drop it in, and then can only use trial mode for 8hrs.

Is it something to do with PPC not working?

Please help..."
,stef_u,2008-01-14T12:19Z,"Does anyone else have the problem with the patcher saying that it has a problem and cannot patch all the necessary files?

Then if you view the error log, it reports a ""SSA error"" or something like that - the result is that the patch simply doesn't work?

This happens on G4 PB15 (PPC) - does anyone else get this problem or know a way around?

Are there any other working patches for this app?"
