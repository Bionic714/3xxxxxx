,minapengar,2007-04-20T23:26Z,"not sure but this is high budget primetime TV HBO shit if u knowhaddaimsayin?
First season was also about 10 episodes so I think one season is just about 10-12 episodes"

,Kimlopez,2008-02-11T15:37Z,"the problem is that Rome has been booring all through season one aswell.. this is one crappy ass job of the photagrafer and director, made real by way much money.. I am convinced that this would have been an great series if other persons where behind the most meaningfull spots of making this.

Too bad, i managed to get trough season 1, I really dont know if its worth seeing this season aswell..."
,twiiiiik,2008-03-01T17:35Z,I think Rome season 1 was just an excellent show. On par with Band of Brothers and Deadwood.

too bad the advanced the episodes too fast :)

they could have made season 1-2 into 2 seasons each, with more plot developments and more character development

,joey6997,2009-01-27T20:28Z,Ok people the show wasn't canceled they just didnt ruin the show with filler episodes. that is a big reason i like it some much. No bs every episode is to the point. This is IMO hbos best show. Ilove Deadwood and Six feet Under. But I always catch myself watching this!
,thaibuddha,2009-01-29T06:22Z,"Where's all the seeding at? I need some data yo! Hook a brotha up, I'll open the pipelines if I get a good flow! Hahahaha."
,darlakk,2009-06-23T19:58Z,"Kissemisse, im pretty sure that the show wasnt doing to well at the time, they told em to wrap it up, sad face."
,hart37,2009-08-09T11:27Z,"Joey what are you on about Rome was canceled by HBO and then in a twist to make things completely final the set burnt down after the wrap party. 

Personally I like the way it ends even if did leave room for another season. As for pejy I am, gunna download this cause I'd rather only download the series once and have it for good then download it once while it streams and then again if I wanna watch it again."
,labcoat,2010-10-25T21:32Z,Thanks a lot for this.
,Simnos,2010-12-10T05:34Z,"
Thanks for this awesome show.

A - 10
V - 9"
,Bazeballl,2011-01-31T22:07Z,"The show WAS canceled, it was canceled because the sets were too expensive to continue."
,Torvik88,2011-03-03T10:05Z,"At least they put effort in sets, not like that Spartacus crap show where is CGI CGI CGI"
,ThePsydome,2011-03-11T18:20Z,The show was not cancelled. It was made by HBO in conjunction with the BBC and was supposed to be the story of Lucius verenus and Titus pullo and their relationship during the turbulent period of Rome's history. The BBC refused to continue the series because it had done its job and told that story. The cost of making a series also did not warrant making further series. HBO considered this a cancellation because of US ways of making programmes. the BBC has a strict quality standard. The result is a series that did not jump the shark and is a work of art where every episode is legit part of a story.
,vitanuova,2011-03-12T12:20Z,ThePsydome: It jumped the shark when they compressed what was intended to have been three or four seasons of material into the final four episodes. The Vorenus and Pullo story from the BBC is a retcon.
,adicto_al_cafe,2011-06-13T04:12Z,Great torrent
,huggeyface,2011-10-25T12:57Z,thanks

Very informative (although its loosely based on history) i dont see how you can bash spartacus atleast its got some gore man and lots of it :D the biggest battle thats happened from what ive watched (in greece) didnt was a 30 second blur of unrecognizable soldiers( they could have done this for suspense or whatver they reason may be but cummon they coulda showed some throat slittin or even an initial charge ( maybe this was simply a budget cut due to the ""effort"" you say they put into other less important scenes"
,JZKilla,2012-06-17T09:53Z,"@theTingMC

he was comparing the sets for rome and spartacus, not the genre or subject matter. as was said before,  rome is a work of art. spartacus is a homosexual porno mixed with a terrible mexican snuff film with some historic elements duct taped on top of it using a 1970's macintosh"
