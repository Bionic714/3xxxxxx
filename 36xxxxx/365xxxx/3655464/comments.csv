,kjdb14,2009-07-12T11:31Z,"Hello, I've d/l 37 movies from this website already but out of so much curiousity, I decided to sign up.

I was wondering what it means when the person you're d/l from either has a ""pink or green"" skull?  I was also wondering, everyone is asking to seed.  So after I d/l movies, I leave mine up for as long as I can before removing it from my ""utorrent.""  Is that the way to seed or do I have to click on something that says, ""keep seeding.""?

The last question I have is about the audio.  I'm wondering why the audio is very low but with headphones, it's perfectly clear?

I know you've probably answered some of these FAQ's already but thank you so much for your time!"
