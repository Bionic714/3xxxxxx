I opened one of the audio files at random when it'd downloaded and was immediately informed that if I released myself to the unfathomableness of god - so I deleted it.

Turns out to be spiritual based stuff which I don't have time for.  Sure, if it helps others to wrap up self-hypnosis and similar belief concepts into a more managable God driven system that they're used to, go for it.  I'd rather cut out the middle-man and get straight to business."
