,Dr.lundholm,2007-04-05T23:53Z,What??????
,Dr.lundholm,2007-04-05T23:54Z,Is' it at crack code????
,microdoted,2007-04-06T00:04Z,"just got it. you have to go through a few steps, but it works. just unzip, and run the app. it will open a finder window with individual crack programs. run each program, drag the app into the window, and done. works perfectly. 

thanks a ton for this. now i can start using my new mac pro and retire the power mac. "
,microdoted,2007-04-06T00:22Z,"and it just occurred to me... everything is here, and works perfectly, EXCEPT acrobat pro. doesnt appear to be a crack for it yet. 

most of you wont use it anyway however. but its not there. just letting you know."
,puggy,2007-04-06T02:52Z,I think I'll just wait for 30 more days until a keygen comes out. I don't know if this crack will mess with the executables and eventually prevent Adobe patches.
,evision,2007-04-06T04:01Z,"This works great.  you can go ahead and use this for the time being.  when a keygen and activation comes out you can reinstall it and use that.  since you drag and drop the program.app you can reinstall it and use the keygen when it comes available.

But this does work great!!  Like Boland said, everything but Acrobat."
,emacnuel,2007-04-06T06:44Z,"Thanks, I obtained it from demonoid and immediately I share here ;-)"
,Pshkwa,2007-04-06T07:46Z,"I am not sure on what to drag into the drop zone, everything seemed to unzip right, but when I try and drag anything into the drop zone for one of the patches it says that I cant patch it, so what am I supposed to drag into the drop zone and where do I find it."
,alistaire,2007-04-06T08:27Z,"more seriously, it is missing a crack for the flash video encoder...everything else looks peachy, tho

and you should drag the CS3 app itself to the drop zone"
,bicep,2007-04-06T09:15Z,"Have finished dwdld the entire suite! But, there are no ?typical? dvd/cd diskimages... And in ordere to prevent the sioftware to ?hum in? to Adobe, I installed ?little Snicth? and I corrupted all my seedings.....;-( SORRY!
But, how do I install, and when can we get the activation key? 
BUT most of all, is there a way for me to resume seeding? Is there a way to sed and use Little Snitch simultanesouly?

3. Open the .dmg (the on from the second torrent above) and install.

4.  Go to ""Applications> Adobe Photoshop CS3""

5.  Run the .dmg (from the first torrent).  The .dmg should have a CS3 logo as its icon picture.

7.  Double click on the Photoshop icon.  Drag and drop the installed Photoshop application (from step four) onto the blue window.  Let it do its magic and leave it alone for a while.  It may seem frozen but its not!  Once its done it will give the following message: ""The application has been successfully patched"".

8.  Do this for the other CS3 Design Premium programs but make sure you use only the corresponding crack applications.

This has worked for me.  There should not be any problems.  I would like to thank the torrent community for the seeding of CS3.  Thanx guys!!!"
