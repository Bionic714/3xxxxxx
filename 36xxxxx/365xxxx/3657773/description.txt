Monstertux originates from Leeuwarden (The Netherlands) and plays independent rock with a differentiating and unmistakable sound. The critics given, claim hearing influences from Placebo, Sonic Youth and The Beatles. Being associated with these names is definitely not something to be ashamed of. Musical influences in abundance, but the core of Monstertux is about writing and translating their own work. The Monstertux songs can be characterized as melancholy with conscientious texts and well thought through musical arrangements. The melody is always dominantly present, even in the dynamic small and bombastic changes.

Highlights, since the start in 2002, are the live shows in Paradiso (Amsterdam), Eurosonic (Groningen) and a live radio performance on 3FM (Dutch radio). Besides numerous gigs through The Netherlands, Monstertux played as a support act for Breed77, The Answer and singer songwriter Kevn Kinney. In may 2007 Monstertux will play together with the progrock giant Marillion.
