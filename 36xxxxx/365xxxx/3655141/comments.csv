,El Jafar,2007-04-05T00:16Z,"Ok, he made a mistake with the name. We and he got that by now. Stop picking on him, be a little nicer in your comments.

For example ""iljutz"" 2:nd comment, it is much nicer if you keep your anger for yourself and instead write something like ""It would be nice if you add some nfo.""."
