,paulbourbon,2007-04-16T19:17Z,"Hi there. 
    For some reason, the only version that works with my motorola bluetooth audio connector S705, an asus A6Kt under windows Vista with an Msi bluetooth dongle BToes SE is the latest release 3.2.2.6, which is limited to 5M, about 5 minutes of utilisation. 
    Everything goes fine with 3.0, but I just don't get any sound, whether the version is limited or not. 
    Does anybody have any idea why that might be or what I could do about it ? I just bought the usb bluetooth dongle, and it came with Bluesoleil 2.xx, which is not compatible with Vista. 

   Thanks in advance for any clues. "

And the noticeable difference is that when the it connects to my bluetooth audio equipment, it uses a slightly different message as far as codec notification."

,omiazad,2007-06-01T03:23Z,This crack is a fake. This is just the EXE from the free 1.6 version. So don't waste your time behind downloading this crack. This is not a crack actually...
