This is not actually Tom Waits and Peter Murphy singing, but some people with very similar voices.
Quote:
Porn Orchard's tune was included because it's often circulated as "Peter Murphy and Tom Waits" (strange bedfellows indeed!) but was in fact by Porn Orchard and the Opal Foxx Quartet for a 1993 compilation by the Athens, GA magazine, Flagpole's "The Mother of All Flagpole Christmas Albums". The impressions are top notch. Curtiss Pernice played the part of Tom Waits and Ted Hafer did Peter Murphy (of Bauhaus).

Enjoy...
