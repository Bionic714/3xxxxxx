http://qemu-forum.ipi.fi/viewtopic.php?t=1379 helps to get it up and running. Good luck"

NeXTstep is geared toward SCSI, and it's easier to find a scsi controller to work with NeXTstep than it is to find an ata controller."

but I really wanted to try the real deal."

Do you have any more NeXT goodies in store? I will probably be looking for the y2k patch after upgrading to 3.3...

In turn, I have a good number of NeXT apps I could seed. Looking for anything special?

TNX alot!"
