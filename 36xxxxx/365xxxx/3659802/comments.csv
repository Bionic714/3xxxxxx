,PS3-D,2009-01-04T08:14Z,"All the hard work that went into this torrent, and it ends up the first episode is totally different than the rest... its an .mp4 while the rest are .avi's... its 220MB while the rest are 175MB... and it seems to be the wrong aspect ratio... why, why go through all this and not do it right?"
,ArcticEel,2010-01-21T22:40Z,"@PS3-D
Although it's quite annoying when this happens, I don't really mind that much, as I am getting this for free from this kindness of another. Redarrow7216 was kind enough to share this anime with us, and I am not going to complain. Thank you for the torrent, redarrow."
