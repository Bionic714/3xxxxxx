,Majsmumien,2007-06-24T12:38Z,"DETOX OR DIE by David Graham Scott


** WARNING!! This documentary contains several strong scenes of intraveneous drug use and would not be suitable for children under 15 and sensitive individuals. **

The film was broadcast on BBC1 in 2004 as part of the One Life documentary strand.

Here's a synopsis:
Detox or Die provides an in-depth portrait of a small-time drug addict seeking redemption. Addicted to opiates for almost 20 years, filmmaker David Graham Scott decides to opt for a quick fix. The radical detox agent Ibogaine puts the user into a gut-wrenching hallucinatory state for 36 hours from which he emerges cleansed of his addiction. But several fatalities have been reported in connection with this unlicensed drug and Scott must weigh up the options before embarking on the trip of a lifetime.

The film has great educational value and should be of interest to not only those working in the field of addiction but anyone with concerns in this area. It's a subject which is too rarely discussed in Caithness and this presents an opportunity to open things up to a stimulating debate.
