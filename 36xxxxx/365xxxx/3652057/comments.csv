As for it being in the wrong section, I do apologize.  It's only the first torrent I've ever uploaded.

What's useless for you is a tool that any coder worth his salt can't live without.  Think before you speak, buddy.  With about fifty people downloading it at this moment, it seems like it's pretty useful to quite a few people."
,I_QBot,2007-04-04T23:43Z,Most everybody seems stuck at 97.9%. I hope I can get the last few pieces.
,mjuad,2007-04-05T00:37Z,"My hard drive (the one with MSDN on it) crashed.  A few people did get it 100% (my upload ratio is like 3.9xx, too) but I'll try to get the HD or at least the torrent fixed.  Sorry about that!  I'll see what I can do and start seeding again!"
,mjuad,2007-04-05T00:47Z,"OK, it's back up!  Feel free to finish leeching, people, and then please seed - even if at a low speed!  This is an invaluable piece of documentation...a must have for any programmer!  Thanks!"
,Shnoky,2007-09-14T04:01Z,Thanks man been looking for this one for a long time. For a VB6 user like me this is a neccesity

Tôi đang tải file này của bạn, đã hoàn thành 38.7%.
Nhưng đã nhiều ngày nay rồi mà nó vẫn ở 38.7%.
Tôi phải làm gì bây giờ? Bạn có thể giúp tôi không?
