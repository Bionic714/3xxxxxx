,gianelli76,2007-07-09T06:19Z,"This is very useful.  The only way I know to make it better would be to have the absolutely LATEST versions of each and that is just asking too much from someone doing this without compensation.

Maybe you could keep a folder of these for your use and update them when later versions are posted, then reissue the package.

Thanks again!  JJ"
