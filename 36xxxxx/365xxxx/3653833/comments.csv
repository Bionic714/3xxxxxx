,Zirak_90,2007-04-11T19:02Z,"Actually they showed episode 17 the 1st April but surprisingly enough it hasn't been uploaded yet. And, yes, I'm 100% sure they showed episode 17 because I know some guys who saw it 1st April and it also says in IMDB.com that they showed episode 17 1st April.

Why hasn't it been uploaded yet?!?!?!?!"
