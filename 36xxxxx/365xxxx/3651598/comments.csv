,Drageflue,2007-04-29T20:25Z,"What the hell you gotta do to play these things??
I can only get the sound to work, i´ve tried almost any player and any codec that exists.."
,Drageflue,2007-04-30T14:09Z,Found out that the new PowerDVD can play the .ts HD movies - but now I have sound missing.. :D
,oswald1234,2007-05-08T08:54Z,"HAHA, If you would have sound, it would have been chinese on power DVD. (with no way to change it) like private ryan  was...Sucker   .20 GIGS of garbage for you...HAHA"
,hurrafor,2007-05-19T11:29Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
