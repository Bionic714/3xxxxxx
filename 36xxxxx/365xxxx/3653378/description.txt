You've hung out in them. You've bought stuff from them. But have you ever thought of actually building a shopping mall? Here's your chance. Mall Tycoon is a strategy management sim with 250 stores to choose from, and 60 different commodities to mix and match. You control which stores go in your mall, but you must strike a balance of goods to bring in a wide range of customers. You'll have to manage mall employees such as janitors and security guards, and deal with real mall problems like shoplifters, punks, and -- to add a dose of surrealism -- supernatural creatures. Devise marketing campaigns and special mall promotions like the Easter Bunny or live concerts. Best of all, you always know exactly where the bathrooms are.
