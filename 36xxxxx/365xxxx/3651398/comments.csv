buncha winrars. and i have no idea
what im supposed to do with em

,angelina70,2007-04-02T18:38Z,"You click on the first RAR usually numbered 00 and choose extract... and winrar will put the file back together for you so you can watch it

If you have trouble playing it try downloading 
VLC media player... I haven't run into anything it hasn't been able to play including Bin/Cue files"
