New release from Japan:

The Velvet Underground
If It's Too Loud For You Move Back! 2006 Remastered
CD +/- CDR, Nothing Songs NSCD-004/1/2, Japan, 2006
  
Here comes the fourth volume in the Nothing Songs series. This new double CD set with mobile fidelity sounds lab-style cover is a limited edition of 500. It offers a remastered version of the If It's Too Loud For You Move Back! 2-CD bootleg, released in 1997, which was the first to offer a complete, unedited version of the famous Exploding Plastic Inevitable at The Valleydale Ballroom in Columbus OH on November 4, 1966, digitally mastered from the original tape.

The new edition has a different track-splitting and a boosted sound - I don't know what kind of sound treatment was applied, but it sounds louder than the 1997 original edition.

First hand-numbered 100 copies come with a bonus CDR of the legendary 1966 bootleg LP - first record to offer the 2 long jams from the Columbus 1966 show, a.k.a Melody Laughter and Nothing Song.
