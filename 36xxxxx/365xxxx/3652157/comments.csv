also worked great with my AMD x2 5200+ but the mobo for my p4 2.8 isnt supported. 

mac osx runs great on my celeron d 2.8ghz pc i tried the halo demo what was a powerpc version i dont think their is a intel demo. worked great on lowest settings. i could play it with really good setting with the x1300 256mb pci. if u want this to run fast dont put it on a old hd that is only like 8gb or less. i first tried 10.4.3 on one of my old 6gb hard drives and i also tried 10.4.8 on it. on a hd that is only ata66 and some bad sectors it didnt run as fast as i wanted and it would end up running up with all the virtual ram being used. haveing a ata130 120gb hard drive is great and also works and loads much faster. i can boot up my pc into mac osx in 35seconds. 29seconds excluding the bios startup screen. and in a pc that caust me only $500. bought it from tigerdirect for $300 and bought all new fans new hd and a dvd burner and took out the 256 and put 2x512mb.came with 80gb hard drive but took that out and put it into an external hard drive case. this has a 120gb ata and a 250gb sata. vista loads fast also. if u have an intel board or intel chipset most likly yours will work."

Both work great even though im use the celly the most as my AMD pc is for windows. Speed is vary fast, faster then my old G4 ibook but now that i got a new laptop with vista i may sell the g4 as i got MacOSX86. I do not recommend to try this if you have no idea how to do most pc things. If you would take your pc to a computer repair man, dont try this, but if you know how to fix pc's and repair windows incase if you mess up, then go adhead."

,BasilBrush,2008-08-31T02:26Z,"The secret is to run the Disk Utility and partition the drive before you can continue and install MAC OS X. I initially allocated 32GB of disk to a VMWare virtual disk set to run FreeBSD. In Disk Utility I used 2 partitions 16GB each. The MAC OS X 10.4.8 requires a minimum space of 5.6GB to install. I've now installed but having trouble installing the VMWare tools inside the guest OS otherwise it works a treat.
As VMWare was told to expect FreeBSD the VMWare tools script tries to use kldstat and ldd which don't exist in MAC OS. The equivalent MAC OS commands are:
kldstat -> /usr/sbin/kextstat
ldd -> /usr/bin/otool -L
Currently I'm still looking for the otool command."

,BasilBrush,2008-09-02T16:00Z,"Although Mac OS X 10.4.8 installs and runs inside VMWare I haven't managed to install the VMWare FreeBSD tools. The AMD PCNET driver for Mac OS X also doesn't work for me.
It seems that Apple use Mach-0 tools instead of the FreeBSD ELF tools. This means the FreeBSD script for installing the VMWare tools fails.
You can download the Xcode 2.5 development system for Mac OS X 10.4 to get the ""otool"" program but it won't make any difference - it still won't run the script.
The best of luck."

http://pcwizcomputer.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=32

I just installed it in VMware, running an AMD CPU.
Only one problem, it's eating my CPU to death and is terribly slow even with 4 Ghz CPU power and 1 GB RAM at it's disposal. After a few hours, it has a kernel panic (OS X answer to BSOD) and I have to restart it.
But don't let that scare you away from the torrent, I think it's related to my computer and not this torrent."

Thanks very much for the amazing torrent!

I'm wondering about updates though.. Is it safe to use Mac's software updater? The first time I tried updating, after a restart OS X wouldn't boot up anymore. That is the only problem I have run into and I just reinstalled it and so far so good. I just won't update it anymore. Be nice if someone could confirm that using Mac's software updater is whats caused it not to boot up anymore. I may try updating again when I have some time to see if it stops booting up again after update."

,sjburk,2011-07-06T19:09Z,so can i just format my hard disk to remove windows and just install mac not parallel or as a virtual machine? Cuz all the instructions and forums and guides are how to install mac along with windows but i just want a dedicated mac os x. And if so would i just burn the iso to disk format my hard drive and then boot from the disk
