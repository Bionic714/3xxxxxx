Ok guyz,

This is Jas' version of Mac Os X 10.4.8 with PPF 1 (posted by Dellium on Demon) & PPF 2 (posted by the Defiant, it corrects 10.4.8's Disk Utility problem)

You can grab 3rd Party Drivers on
 
http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/3rdPartyDrivers

but I haven't tried any yet.


When you install, only select the Intel or AMD drivers in the installation list.

Do not select any added graphics drivers, as they seem buggish (well it depends on your card). Try to download other/newer versions instead.

Good luck,

P.S. Seed, seed, seed, (at least one week, plz). C'mon I can't spread it all by myself ;o)
