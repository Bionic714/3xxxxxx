,commodore1024,2007-08-06T22:48Z,This is good music
,bonkeman,2009-01-21T19:07Z,Why bother making mp3's in 128 kbps? It's fucking worthless if you're not sitting on a stereo system from 1976! 
,Chricton,2009-01-24T06:34Z,"The album was released in 1984 jackass. You really think it's gonna sound any better at 320? It's going to sound just as distant and metallic no matter the bitrate, or stereo for that matter."
[T],bill_214,2009-01-27T16:09Z,"Chricton, you're a clueless blithering idiot.........and I see you've uploaded nothing."
,fred888,2009-03-20T22:59Z,"It never ceases to amazes me how people can bitch about the quality/bitrate/file type or whatever of the media they are attemptng to download FOR FREE from someone's else labours. If it bothers you that much, don't moan on-line, go and buy it you cheap whingeing git."
,warriorinc,2009-07-05T05:33Z,You can convert any files with MP3VolumeGain anyway thats what I do. Dee Snider spit in my face on this tour when they opened up for Iron Maiden on the World Slavery Tour for that I'm gonna steal these files just joking I bought the LP back in 1984 anyway Twisted Sister got their coin from me already. Thanks Yaku.
,warriorinc,2009-07-05T05:34Z,I was at the front row thats how Dee Snider spit on me and a few other fans lol.
,busypirate,2010-02-05T19:24Z,Ego's  fighting or what ? Thanks alot i fond my high school songs again . i used to have hundreds of 80s songs in cassettes but my drugs addict cousin stole and sold them away.
,lovntorrent,2010-07-30T08:31Z,thank you
,Idort77,2010-10-02T06:59Z,"Wow, bill_214, really? You didn't read his comment at all, did you? I agree 100% with him. Who the fuck cares about the bitrate? If it's really that big a deal, convert it to a higher one, it's not hard. You could, of course, buy the fucking CD, but using money is an impossible task for a pirate, so I'm just a ""blithering idiot."" And stop with that self-righteous ""you've uploaded nothing"" shit, he wasn't complaining about the torrent."
,jhoelzler,2010-11-23T16:45Z,"thanks for the nice torrent, got it in like 1 min, gonna seed this for a while! :)

I love Twisted Sister, Iron Maiden, Motley Cr端e"
