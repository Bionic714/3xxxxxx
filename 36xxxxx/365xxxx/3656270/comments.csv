About the scheduling/airing
Since they are aired in Canada, they have a different boradcasting schedule, they are aired everyday @ 8pm, same in UK, its not scifi, its SKYONE. so what takes U.S. a year to watch, it takes them a week or 2"
,lennier1,2007-05-08T18:50Z,Today I have provided this torrent to 93 persons in a total of 2 TB data uploaded. Guess I have done my share soon.
,Newbie3,2007-08-04T22:32Z,you must burn to DvD??? ..
,Newbie3,2007-08-04T22:33Z,cause i have VLC media player ...cant i play them there ??
,BioHaZZarD99,2007-09-11T21:46Z,"You can watch them on PC by mounting them in DAEMON tools or similar program.. YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS ON STANDARD DVD PLAYERS!

The only one I had the DVDs working properly was a DivX certified one.. All the others cut off the left and right to make it full-screen top to bottom and make the subtitles somewhat unreadable, I had to go into my DivX-certified DVD player and set it's output to ""4:3 letterbox""

After that, NO problems (other than SLOW FUCKING ASS speed)


peeps, UNCAP your uploads, or try not to seed 5 diff torrents at once..."
,BioHaZZarD99,2007-09-12T21:49Z,"Anyone else having problems with episode 16 ""The Ark""?  I've yet to try directly from the ISO, but when I burn it it becomes corrupt.. Anyone else having these problems?"
,Atlantis91,2007-09-24T15:54Z,"VERY SLOW

about 100-200 Kb/s down and
1.5-2 mb/s Up

,lennier1,2007-11-12T19:47Z,DISC4 and DISC5 is encoded with a bit rate exceeding the DVD Standard and may not be playable on certain DVD players. Please download the repack instead: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3886592/Stargate.Atlantis.Season3.REPACK
,hakabe,2007-12-29T06:03Z,Really poor quality. 170MB divx put to dvd. Not recommending!
,s20dan,2008-01-08T01:10Z,"I was going to download this, as from the size I thought it must be good quality. Can someone confirm if the quality really is as poor as some people have said?"
,TCipher,2008-11-30T11:40Z,"The quality is absolutely horrible. I downloaded this in order to get better quality than a 300MB divx, but no such luck. Quality is equal at best, but not better. Not worth the download!"
,SweetestPeach,2008-12-18T17:54Z,Please seed
