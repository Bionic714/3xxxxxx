Tracks 3-16 are of fantastic quality. Great album. Real heavy political in a much better way than the disappointing With Teeth."
,thistransition,2007-04-04T21:54Z,fast and works perfectly!
,ikillbambis,2007-04-05T00:31Z,"Digital watermarks block quality on songs one and two. I removed the watermarks and uploaded the ""fixed"" cd in rar format if any one else wants higher  quality."
,delimare,2007-04-05T01:43Z,"It's good enough until a real rip comes out.  

Thanks for the up."

,piratedmoney,2008-04-28T12:10Z,"bought it after i dl'd limitless potential which I got from here... Limitless has some GREAT tracks like survivalism. But you have to listen to this in full... it's a trip - and watch some of the music videos on youtube, this is visual music."
