Does anyone have season 3-4-5 or 6??

Please upload =)"
,zaphod21,2007-04-13T16:18Z,"I have not the fastest internet connection.
up=> 160kB

I'm nearly done with season3 per emule

As soon as I'm finished with it, I upload as torrent.

Do you have any idea of how to make it faster.

Cause it is my first selfmade torrent"
,Viktor-12,2007-04-18T19:15Z,"Thank you zaphod21!!!!

If anyone has season 5 and 6 please, pretty please upload it.  Thx."
,zaphod21,2007-04-20T06:42Z,"Hi Viktor12,

You only need season 5 and 6, so you seem to have the other ones. Do you? Especially I'm looking for season 4. 
"
,zaphod21,2007-05-12T08:16Z,"Sorry mtalica030, 

but as I wrote earlier my connection is not the one of a professional seeder so I think it's better to seed only one season at once.
"
,Viktor-12,2007-05-19T03:38Z,Does anyone have season 5?  Please upload it.  Thanks.
,greenmiller,2007-05-19T18:28Z,"ok, so seasons 3,4,6 stopped uploading for the sake of season 7. Good idea and i dont mind waiting. But this seems to be stuck completely?

Can we have a thumbs up/down from the seeder here ... any use in waiting around for the torrent (s)?"
,yf17,2007-05-20T06:52Z,"It's now stuck @ 71.9% for several days now...

I calculated zaphod21's connection to have trickled out roughly 40 Mb/day... or .46 kb/s.  That kind of speed is slow even in 1992.  Is it possible for zaphod to send a hard copy of these files to a friend that can help him seed?  Also, he should check his internet connection and his bittorrent settings.  This is extremely slow even for dial-up.  

Thanks you very much for sharing.  There's still demand out there for M.A.Y., and sadly we can only get it here (or on TV, but my tv capture card is of terrible quality).  

Good luck, and hopefully one day we can actually complete this (and the other seasons') torrent.

,greenmiller,2007-05-21T22:35Z,"It moved! Were at 72.2% now - glad to see that you haven't given up zaphod!
As yf17 pointed out - there's no other place to get this terrific show. This is our only hope ;-)

So thanks, zaphod, for hanging in there. We really appreciate it!"
,zxof,2007-05-25T01:33Z,stuck again... not a single bit of data transfer since may 20 :(
,AnavelGatou,2007-05-28T05:11Z,"salute
is the torrent still running?"
,yf17,2007-06-01T18:23Z,It's done!  It's officially seeding!  w00t!
,greenmiller,2007-06-01T18:35Z,Hooray!
,Viktor-12,2007-06-01T18:37Z,"Thank you zaphod21.  On this very day YOU are my hero, because I couldn't find this anywhere else and one can't buy this on DVD.  So again, thank you.

I'll seed aswell."
,Viktor-12,2007-06-02T04:27Z,"P.S.
zaphod21 which season of Mad About You are you going to seed next?  Hopefully Season 6?"
,vivatpb5776,2010-09-03T04:00Z,"For those that care, there is a tag in the first few seconds of each episode, ""#MAY-eps @ Dalnet"" and ""[TDC]"". The quality is below average at best and there is a ""Comedy"" tag in the upper right hand corner of all the episodes. Unfortunately, this is the only Season 7 I have found. If I ever find another one, or decide to just buy it myself, I will upload it here."
,Gi5geup3,2011-05-14T12:18Z,Seasons 1-7 have been compiled into a single torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6391610/Mad_About_You_Complete_Seasons_1-7
,chraanaak,2011-06-17T20:14Z,thank you
