,emowanker,2007-04-07T12:23Z,"can anyone please tell me why am i skipping frames in this movie i watch it on vlc player the sound is good and the picture is skippy ??
(its running on an 3800 dc with geforce7800gt) so its not the comp"
,oswald1234,2007-04-11T08:11Z,you  need  a  stronger  comp. or  different  player  may do better.How  do  you  you   join these  AVI files. I had  no problem on the TS files but now its hard that they are  AVI files.thx
,emowanker,2007-04-11T15:58Z,a stronger Comp what are u AN IDIOT iv got a fucking AMD 3800 dual core with 3 gigs of memory and an nvidia 7800gt. if u dont have an answer dont answer 
,oswald1234,2007-04-14T08:19Z,"Thats a very nice computer, I figured it only skipped very little. I hate any skipping at all. I hav core2duo 2.4 and 8800gts and it skips sometimes until I find the player that the movie likes.This one didnt skip 4 me.VLC seems more skippy than showtime, good luck bud."
,dieselg5,2007-04-15T22:03Z,"i can't play these .AVIs I've tried ZoomPlayer, VLC, WMP10, and Showtime I get sound but no video, I have CCCP and HDTV Pump codecs any ideas? I've played 1080p movies before and they play fine"
,Shedding,2007-04-16T05:39Z,The movie plays in both english and chinese for me as well.  Is there anyway to disable this??
,emowanker,2007-04-17T21:14Z,this move format bites ass i think the codec Name is x264 i have downloaded the new ffdshow and then it works good on media player only problem there is that u cant choose audio stream so u get to hear it in crappy chinese
,Shedding,2007-04-18T03:01Z,"This is Bullshit.  It clearly says ""Language: English"" and it is all in chinese.. don't download this crap (Unless you are chinese of course)."
,oswald1234,2007-04-20T08:45Z,"open season and private ryan are the same launguage problem.Some dont  work at all.. Maybe including a 40 gig sample file, could save us from this uploading of 20+ gigs of misery and fakes.Just  set the sample at high priority, and see if it plays for you,then DL the rest. I for one  would love to see samples on these HUGE files.this one played ok  in english but the AVI files wont join right, no matter the program.Its always something... Sample  please, THX"
,oswald1234,2007-04-21T04:28Z,"I meant 40 meg. sample... dumbass me. Screw the sample just DL the smallest of the split video files on high priority,when its done test it. If it dont work(like this one). cancel/delete it."
,hurrafor,2007-06-01T02:14Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
