NOTE! This is a backuptorrent for people with slow connections (such as 56k and below) or other problems using the direct download on my site. Specifically, a friend of mine could not manage to download through my site because the server closed the connection. So you do not necessarily have to download through the torrent. Instead, you can instantly seed this for a day or so and help me spread my music to a wider audience. Go to http://www.metaltracks.tk/lashmush/ to download the album. Then its up to you if you feel like seeding for a while or not. (To seeders: unzip the files to anywhere, then save torrent to that folder.)
