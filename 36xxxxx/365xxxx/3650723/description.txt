Notes: Between 1996 and 1999 I was making music with an excellent freeware program called Fasttracker 2. This collection is a total ego trip, where I've chosen my own favourite tunes and remixes.

The collection is split into 3 subfolders. First folder is called "The Beginning", and contains very early works. Second folder is called "XM Heaven", and is the highlight of my tracker career. Third folder, "The Remixes" contains remixes made by me (mostly videogame related) and people who've remixed my songs.
