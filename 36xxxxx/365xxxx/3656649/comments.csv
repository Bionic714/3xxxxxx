,colinroyce,2007-04-06T05:04Z,"Someone please upload 'The State' it's a decade old, but it's from the creators of Reno 911 and was better than Mad, SNL, In Living Color, and probably this great torrent provided by brainiac"
,braincellsintact,2007-04-06T05:06Z,Can i get out of this by saying best alternative comedy?
,braincellsintact,2007-04-06T05:09Z,To be fair i did that to try and get peoples attention. Gotta admit it worked though
,apoptos,2007-04-07T00:41Z,"IMHO, this is much better than The State.  Please upload them all! I love Chris Morris..."
,Heimdahl8,2007-09-18T09:46Z,Nice work braincellsintact.
