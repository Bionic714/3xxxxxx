,tomoslav,2008-04-16T08:22Z,"Just a shame that every track has short, hard encoded fadeouts when this should be a gapless album; it's really disruptive to the flow of the music, especially because most tracks are only a minute or two long. Was this a result of ripping or is this how the CD sounds?

Anyway, thanks for posting this. A bad copy is better than no copy. :-/

when i downloaded this, it already had the stupid pauses between tracks. i'm really sorry it's not the way it should be but it's all i have. "
