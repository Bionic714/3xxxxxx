The Dead Man Street Orchestra is a travelin' tramp band spawned in New Orleans. They play everything from old time to rag time, blues to country, and gypsy to jazz. They tour mostly by freight train, in a family that sometimes has grown up to 10 people and 5 dogs. They have recorded two albums, and have played up and down both coasts together. They play in any town they pass through, on the streets, in the parks, the laundromats, the bars, punk houses, bathrooms, city buses, salvation armys, libraries, the list goes on.. But in the winter time you can find them down in their favorite city New Orleans.

Unfortunately, it a low-quality 128 kbps rip.
Enjoy this great music!
