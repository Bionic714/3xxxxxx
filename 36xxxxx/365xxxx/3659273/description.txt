Maps of Maryland for Mapopolis Navigator (Palm OS5 devices only)

These are fully usable maps (not 9 day demos) with GPS and voice direction, and are version NE/07.

Mapopolis Navigator is a compact and functional navigation package for Palm OS PDAs - it supports high resolution color displays, and uses NAVTEQ data. Per-county map files save space on your PDA. 

When used with a GPS device (serial or Bluetooth, NMEA-compliant), Navigator maps generate door-to-door driving directions and automatically generate spoken and visual prompts before each turn and automatically re-route when a turn is missed. When used without a GPS device, Navigator maps generate door-to-door driving directions but no automatic visual or spoken prompts.
