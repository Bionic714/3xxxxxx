,Mrpearlzildjian,2007-04-18T03:48Z,"Ok, I downloaded and installed and everything works perfectly. So I ask this question, which may be a bit stupid... is there any possible way I can access the website for tutorial videos? Is the registry key included written just to trick the program into thinking it's registered, or is there actually a real registration? I need those videos, I know very little about Fruity Loops..."
,DaNtsu,2007-04-19T15:38Z,"downloading, thanx a lot d00d."

,Lukas034,2007-04-30T01:55Z,"I got it, I kept clicking on the reg file but it kept giving me a error that another program was using the file and I wasn't running fruity loops either. So i decided to boot up in safe mode and that worked."
,hybridbat,2007-05-11T09:06Z,"This registration is about to expire, hopefully someone can revive it before the next week or so??"

Can we save projects so we can continue next day? Somone who have tried?

Kan man spara sina spår så man kan stänga av programmet och fortsätta någon annan gång?
Går det att spara? Inte? Varför då?
Kan någon svarapå om det går att spara eller inte?"
,johnnyblaze104,2007-09-02T22:32Z,"what are seeds, seeders, and leechers?(tell me in that exact order)"
,linkhero,2007-09-12T15:46Z,"@ 

No you can't save your songs if you've got the demo version. But if you registrate your program you can.

Nej du kan inte spara dina låtar om du har demoversionen. Men om du registrerar ditt program så kan du."
