,leswart,2007-04-09T18:35Z,Do you intend to add the 2nd dic of the lamb at some point? I tend to agree with you about the Peter point. They were best then. Does this also include the covers?
,blindpirate,2007-04-10T02:31Z,"yes disc 2 will be added, and i didnt put the album covers in but can send to you upon request or i will upload them all if ppl want them "

,myrgrot,2007-07-23T17:53Z,"This seems like a very nice torrent. :/ Would you like to seed it, I would be even happier! Agree on the Peter Gabriel opinion, too..."
,Xuga,2008-04-15T12:42Z,where is seed?
,azzy9998,2008-05-25T20:01Z,AM TRYING TO DOWNLAD IT BUT NO SEEDERS PLEASE SEED
,BigE1961,2008-06-16T17:52Z,06-16-2008 - Trying to download - PLEASE SEED! Will re-seed in return!
,LezDawson,2008-08-11T22:32Z,"Got all of these already.  A more useful torrent would be some of the extras from the remix box sets (interviews, live footage, etc)."
