All four audio books by Dan Brown.
Digital Fortress, Deception Point, Angels & Demons, and The Da Vinci Code.
All high quality, all unabridged.
Made with LAME 3.96 & 3.97 (Settings are: -b 32 -m m -h -p -V 0 -B 320 --lowpass 20)
For those of you who don't understand those settings, they are: High quality, VBR, mono (IMO, stereo isn't necessary in most audiobooks anyways; plus the file sizes are smaller without sacrificing quality), sampled at 44.1khz (cd), minimum bitrate 32k, maximum bitrate 320, lowpass audio filter set at 20k and down (you don't need your dog to hear the high freqs do you?)
Even though the file names haven't been renamed, they are id3 tagged properly (Do you want to rename over 872 files?), WITH cd cover art too!

This is the best you're gonna get for mp3's in the smallest file sizes AT cd quality.

872 files, 3.06gb size.
