,yog_,2007-04-01T11:17Z,1:st april
,thaddius,2007-04-05T01:20Z,Rowling is a little (more like a lot) more subtle in her title descriptions. This isn't real.
,djizle,2007-04-06T07:11Z,looks real but is not complete. leaves you pissed off at 240 page. the real book is 700+
,aifaif,2007-04-06T16:59Z,"This is 240 pages computer written...that dosen't mean that it is 240 pages in the book, it's much more...actually i think it's around 600-700 ""bookpages""
I'm on page 120 now and i think it is pretty good, and it wouldn't surprice me if it was the real one."
,thaddius,2007-04-12T01:39Z,It is NOT real. It was released on April Fools.
,Llamallamakaelisra,2007-04-15T16:51Z,"oh, and Rowling also stated the last word in the book would be 'scar' so it's definatly a dud.
Nice effort tho"
,gavinmgraham,2007-04-15T23:09Z,"It's not real, you can tell by the style it's written in. But fuck it, its a long time till the real one comes out."
,shypys,2007-05-01T22:53Z,"How do you know the last sentence? Its not on google. Shit, this implies that Harry's not gonna die. Also this probably means that you have the book already. If you do, plz share with me too: an.ions@yahoo.com.

PS: I have no lawyers."
,shypys,2007-05-03T05:33Z,"the person who wrote the first post is an idiot.
so am i.
but thats ok, coz so are you."
,Wolfie_90,2007-05-06T04:23Z,"Found an error at the first page. ""?so I?m going to be hear alone for about half an hour.? "" It's ""Here"" not ""Hear"".

Sooo, not a very good writer, but it's something in the waiting for the real deal."
,netza,2007-05-10T16:09Z,don tell me people get fooled and download this? :S
,shypys,2007-05-10T19:56Z,"nope,people didnt get fooled and downloaded this. They read this as a filler in the meantime, coz obviously we have nothing better to do(or do we)"
,acheron2,2007-05-18T19:39Z,"The author doesn't know the difference between ""its"" and ""it's""."
,acheron2,2007-05-19T09:30Z,"This fanfic is called ""Harry's Last Task""

,noxifera,2007-05-28T00:47Z,"I am nearly sure thets the real book, and even if it isnt, it IS pretty good and i want to read the full version on this text, so plz if enyone has it plz upload..."
,NovaStalker,2007-07-19T00:18Z,"This is not real but I think, incomplete though it is, it will be better than what we get from Rowling. I only wish we could get the person who wrote this to finish it."
