Anyone, can Seed!!??

TIA"
,deSteini,2007-04-02T23:35Z,Is this one working? Hmmm... No seeders... This is gonna take a while downloading... ;) Keep it up...
,lenrique,2007-04-02T23:42Z,its true??? can anyone tell us?
,schweppes77,2007-04-02T23:54Z,"Is this the final release or the Beta ???
Could you upload only Photoshop CS3 Final instead all the CS3 suite?

THANX!"
,lenrique,2007-04-03T00:06Z,NOOOOOOO ALL THE SUITEEEE!!!!! WIIIIIIIII!!!!!!
,schweppes77,2007-04-03T00:33Z,"I want only Photoshop CS3 not all the suite, could you upload an alternative for download only Photoshop please?"
,schweppes77,2007-04-03T01:25Z,"Patience??? i have been waiting this since september 2005 !!!!

I said thanx to the uploader !"
,ClarkCable,2007-04-03T02:01Z,I think its a fucking fake..
,schweppes77,2007-04-03T02:18Z,"Yes, seems it`s a fake!
The uploader never say anything about our answers"
,lockley,2007-04-03T03:26Z,"This file appeared on MSJ on April's Fool Day. It seems that all applications are FINAL VERSIONS except Photoshop, but cannot confirm."
,schweppes77,2007-04-03T04:15Z,"Anyone could confirm this ????
I dont like to download all the suite if Photoshop is still beta (i have beta version now)"
,arrannen,2007-04-03T04:49Z,"If this is the same one that was  posted on MSJ/Rapidshare then it DOES seem to be all the final versions.  Photoshop upgrades from the CS3 beta I already had.

This is one HELL of a nice package.  I've been using it all afternoon and am totally blown away!

Install with the serial #'s on MSJ do require activation, but it gives the standard 30 days for activation...so there should be a working keygen by then.

I've also set up my copy for seeding as I'm pretty sure I've got the same copy"
,bicep,2007-04-03T06:48Z,"How do you install PS 3.0, so that it actually works? And how many days will it take to download the whole Adobe CS3 Design Premium Suit, if there are no seeders?"
,avtmx,2007-04-03T08:04Z,haha! the first 5% downloaded at 600 kB/s and how im stuck at 3 kB/s. Please seed
,schweppes77,2007-04-03T13:45Z,"Never mind the picky people who are always asking for special service.
Thanks for the upload.
You special people.....now you are asking for a serial !"
,ClarkCable,2007-04-03T13:54Z,"So this is the real shit!?! 
Me and my Mac Book Pro tip our high hats..

,arrannen,2007-04-03T16:44Z,"As with typical adobe products, a serial is NOT required to install.  Install the 30 day fully functioning demo and by then a good crack/serial will be found."

have wait for this puppy long time:-)"

,arthur_s,2007-04-03T19:48Z,"well

just mount this dmg file with Toast 8 and see: THAT IS NOT CS 3 :((("
,deSteini,2007-04-03T20:20Z,Hmmm.. Can anyone confirm that this is only an audio CD? Would b quite shity... And a damn lot of audio.. ;)
,arrannen,2007-04-03T20:56Z,"Now...I'm looking at this file and its been downloaded *0* times.  I take it then there are those who do not understand that untill a disk is fully downloaded its NOT complete.  This is the SAME image I have (I have confirmed MD5's) I am also seeding this from MY image and I have now installed this on 2 of my computers without flaw.


Perhaps you should wait for the file to actually complete before trying to use it."
,urzsite,2007-04-03T21:52Z,"Arthur_s is perhaps trying to get people to stop downloading, in hopes his own speed will go up :-s

Bad attitude!"
,plebmac,2007-04-03T22:55Z,probaly lol shit earlyer it said 2 seeders now it says 1

,scunky,2007-04-04T12:38Z,"I thinks this is on Demoniod and it's a 30 day trial

no sign of a serial on Demoniod"
,scunky,2007-04-04T12:41Z,".....also the movers and shakers at Demoniod

,plebmac,2007-04-04T12:44Z,this is final except photoshop witch mite be beta this is the developers release
,scunky,2007-04-04T12:49Z,"you just contadicted yourself!!

,plebmac,2007-04-04T13:01Z,if u actully read what i said i am right it aint just photoshop in there dream weaver flash and everything else in there is final except photoshop witch is exactly what i just said
,fredrikande,2007-04-04T13:12Z,"grat, now I am also stuck at 82.3%... The information says that there is one seeder, but perhaps that is not true? Well to bad."
,ronniesinbox,2007-04-04T13:18Z,This copy of CS3 Design Premium was given out to reviewers. Thats why Photoshop is the last beta. All the apps except PS were gold for reviewers.
,plebmac,2007-04-04T13:23Z,thats my point proven lol
,fredrikande,2007-04-04T13:51Z,Is there still no one who can help us by seeding? Would be much apprechiated.
,plebmac,2007-04-04T14:00Z,there was 2 seeders last night so we just gota hold on
,scunky,2007-04-04T14:06Z,"Jut wondered what part of ""Final"" don't you understand?"
,plebmac,2007-04-04T14:15Z,osx tiger is called final it means finished everything is retail version except ps u numbnut!
,veghel,2007-04-04T15:04Z,"I'm UL to 2, but I'm DL... 0
So any further as the 82% noone will come unless there is a seeder that has the full 100%..."

,ronniesinbox,2007-04-05T00:13Z,"All the apps are Gold (Photoshop Extended does not show beta for me). However the directory structure and packaging  of the installer is pre-release. That's the only difference between this and retail.

Also use Little Snitch to block communications."

  I believe this is a 30-day, review copy. That is, if you don't provide a licence key, it will keep asking you to register and eventually stop working after 30 days.

  We live in the hope that someone will provide a license key (or key generator) within the next 30 days. Stranger things have happened at sea.

,nitrokev,2007-04-06T14:49Z,"Just to be clear for people still asking, yes this is full working versions of all the apps including Photoshop Extended, All can be installed with this serial number : 1326 0262 2192 5687 4024 4755 and then cracked to remove the activation with the pirate bay crack.
Acrobat Pro can be installed without the need to activate or crack using this serial: 1118-0416-0353-7679-9743-4179

You do NOT need to remove CS2 or Photoshop Beta, just go to Library>Application Support> Adobe and rename folder to Adobe -OLD then do the same in you user library.

You will not be able to use the CS2 apps(without fiddling with the support folder contents)  but you can drop back to these versions if CS3 goes wrong, by changing the names on the Adobe folders."

,macpdx,2007-04-07T11:11Z,"This totally works.

I am a Macintosh Professional.

All you have to do is either trash, or re-name the folder Library>Application Support>Adobe in  both the hard drive and user folders then install.  After that, before running the apps, use the krack found here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3656499/Adobe_Creative_Suite_CS3_Premium_Crack on each application.

This will work flawlessly.

If you have no Adobe products currently installed, you don't even need to do that.

I had PHOTOSHOP CS3 and FIREWORKS CS3 (both beta) installed so I had to ditch the Application support files or else the CS3 installer would crap out each time.

Have fun, and say out loud, when all is installed and well, FUCK THE MAN!

""JUPSTER and diapason58, If the crack cannot change your permissions, do it manually. Control click on the app. and select 'Get Info'. At the bottom, there are two dropdowns, one named 'Ownership & Permissions', which should read 'You can:Read & Write', and another named 'Details' which should have the following settings;
'Owner:system' 'Access:Read&Write' 'Group:admin' 'Access:Read & Write' and 'Others:Read only'.
If your settings are not the same, you will need to click the little lock icon next to Owner, enter your admin password and choose the right settings from the dropdowns (don't forget to lock it again afterwards).

If you cracked all the Adobe apps as soon as you installed them without entering a serial number, Acrobat won't work because the adobe registration file won't be created, so the best thing to do is open Photoshop before you crack it and enter the serial number found in this thread, then open acrobat and it should work. you can now run the crack on photoshop.

If you've already cracked all apps, the best thing to do is re-install Photoshop and enter the serial."

The first thing you have to do, is find the Adobe folder in Library both user and Hard Disk, go to the Library/Application Support -delete or rename the folder Adobe, ones you instaled the suite you can delete CS2, after that run the patches.

I did everything the instructions said to do and all of the programs work fine for me with no issues. However, I am beginning to think that PS3 is a beta or at least not a FULL version. 

Some of the image filters cannot be selected, Save for Web cannot be selected as an option, when I go to save as, there is a VERY limited choice as to which format I'd like to save it in. Basically, a lot is missing. 

I have yet to try the theory that I should first install, than open PS3 and put in a serial, and THEN crack using the drop-zone, but I'll give that a try later. 

Am I the only one to notice these problems? And / Or has anyone come up with a solution to this issue or do I just need to wait it out until a cracked retail is available? I haven't really checked any of the advanced options in the other programs... so I don't know if they are having the same problems either, but so far they are all working just normal.

I can't be sure but it sounds like you might be limited to those options for filters and file formats because of the type of image you are working with.

eg. a CMYK image will limit the filters, a 16-bit image (perhaps a raw file from a camera) will limit the file types

Thanks. For some reason that never actually crossed my mind. I checked by opening a separate image and checking the filters and everything worked. 

Odd though, that the image I had originally tested on limited both filters and Save Types. It wasn't CMYK and it was 32bit color. Maybe because I had chosen the background color to be transparent; then this photoshop would have the ability to recognize that JPEGs don't recognize transparency and that you can't filter transparent images... perhaps?"

,akkhan360,2007-08-10T22:22Z,"INSTRUCTIONS TO GET CS3 DESIGN PREMIUM FULL VERSION (ENGLISH ONLY) FOR MAC:

1. Download these torrents:

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3656499/Adobe_Creative_Suite_CS3_Premium_Crack.3656499.TPB.torrent

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3653464/Adobe_CS3_Design_Premium_Suit.3653464.TPB.torrent

2. Delete the following folders:

Macintosh HD> Library> Application Support> Adobe

Home> Library> Application Support> Adobe

3. Open the .dmg (the on from the second torrent above) and install.

4.  Go to ""Applications> Adobe Photoshop CS3""

5.  Run the .dmg (from the first torrent).  The .dmg should have a CS3 logo as its icon picture.

6.  You can double click the ""[k] MovieGallery"" and watch the movies for further instructions or continue to read below.

7.  Double click on the Photoshop icon.  Drag and drop the installed Photoshop application (from step four) onto the blue window.  Let it do its magic and leave it alone for a while.  It may seem frozen but its not!  Once its done it will give the following message: ""The application has been successfully patched"".

8.  Do this for the other CS3 Design Premium programs but make sure you use only the corresponding crack applications.

This has worked for me.  There should not be any problems.  I would like to thank the torrent community for the seeding of CS3.  Thanx guys!!!"

I downloaded and installed this brilliant offering, but pretty soon things went pear shaped. For starters, the crack app wouldnt launch, so i resorted to trying out other cracks on TPB. After downloading one i entered one of the S-N's in the comments, and i was asked to download an e-license shortly after. Wheter i choose to download e-license now or later i keep getting the error License key expired and noootthing happens. I've since uninstalled the suite.

I'm just wondering if a successful installer/user of this dowload can give a clear instruction on this..

I'm a leopard 15.2 user intel macbook.
- should i uninstall and delete all existing cs2 related files before install? 
- do i have to burn the image to cd and then install or can i jus directly install from HD? 
-what exactly is the line of actions i should take when applying crack?
- disconnect from the net whilst applying crack/installing suite?

Or, is this torrent unworkable after adobe's intervention ? and give up ?

Thanks to anyone who'll take time to help."

2. so a while ago i downloaded the trial and i used it for 30 days and let it run out because i was to lazy to find a good patch. i used the key from serial box which SUPPOSEDLY was a non-activation key (the key worked but it still makes me activate before i can use the program)
NO MATTER HOW MUCH i delete photoshop CS3 and search the spotlight for all remnants of the program to delete. whenever i install photoshop, i'm stuck at the ""your trial is finished, please activate""
the crack is fixing this but then stuff in the program doesn't work. i get an error about ""Missing Component"" when i run photoshop

HOW CAN I RESET MY TRIAL? =["

Thanks!!!


Njean/Mattc908 Condensed Instructions:

Just finished download...works perfectly!
1. start application and install
2. Go in HD: library/application support
3. Rename Adobe file to another name
4. Run the patch; drag application from application folder onto the drop zone (see video when you open the patch)
5. Wait until you get the message 'successfully patched' (It takes a while);
6. Do that for each application.
7. Once done, run PS3 as you would normally do; software won't ask for serial number
Enjoy!

For Those who dont knnow what the Drop Zone is:
1. You Download the crack http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3656499/Adobe_Creative_Suite_CS3_Premium_Crack
2. You Unzip it.
3. You open up the app, alot of mini logos will apear.
4. Open up your applications folder.

7. Enter Your Password
