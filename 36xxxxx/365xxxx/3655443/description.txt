Mixing rare gems with classic cuts, DMC open their 2007
account with an effusive instalment of their unparalleled
'Back To Mine' compilation series. Revealing highlights
from Norway's finest record collection, maestros of the
masterpieces, Royksopp, take pole position in a year that
will see the 'Back To Mine' franchise reaching new heights.

Reflecting the widescreen, cinematic sensibilities of their
million selling debut album, 'Melody AM' and the dancefloor
drenched grooves of follow up, 'The Understanding', Royksopp
have drawn on the obscure and sublime, hand-selecting tracks
as rich in quality as they are in history, for 'Back To
Mine's 25th outing.

Kicking off with Talking Heads 'Born Under Punches (The Beat
Goes On)', Brian Eno's final (and perhaps finest) production
for the band, Royksopp start slipping in the stunners early,
dropping the electro welding strength of Harry Thumann's 'Sphinx',
with Knight Rider-esque, classic early 80s charm. The championed
funk of Pino Diango, classic bass manoeuvres of Edgar Winter
and shimmering electro disco of Ray Mang charge up proceedings,
before dropping the tempo with Mike Oldfield's 'Charleston'
which segues into an exclusive track from Royksopp under their
pseudonym Emmanuel Splice.

The Low slung bass of Jesse G's 'That's Hot' and Art Of Noise's
'Breakers anthem 'Legs' up the pace as Royksopp cruise through
a masterful lesson in Italo Disco, Hip house and P-Funk. Ginny's
deep slow jam 'Can't Be Serious' settles the groove back before
Funkadelic's 'I'm Never Gonna Tell It' and the burning R'n'B of
the New Birth's 'It's Been A Long Time' bring affairs to a
soulful close.
