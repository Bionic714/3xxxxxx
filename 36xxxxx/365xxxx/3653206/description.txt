JOHNNY THUNDERS VOLUME 12 - LUCKY STRIKE

1. Fastlane, Asbury Park, NJ, 1990
Great Acoustic Show! The vide starts backstage where the cameraman doesn\\\'t let
anyone know he is filming.

Full show, one camera. Long shot, but he/she does use zoom. ;-)
Quality is quite good. Great show think. VHS copy.

2. Irish TV Interview, 1990
Johnny is beeing interviewed and plays Joey Joey acoustic.

VHS copy, quality is OK.
