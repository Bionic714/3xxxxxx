Clue is a 1985 Hollywood comedy film based on the board game Clue (also known as Cluedo). The film uses the characters and murder mystery premise of the boardgame as the basis for a quickfire farce.


Overview

The basic premise of the board game is that of a mystery among six guests at a mansion: one of them has killed Mr. Boddy, their host, in a specific room with a particular weapon. The film expanded on this by making the six central characters victims of Boddy's blackmail, and they join him at his mansion for dinner one evening. When he is killed, a madcap riot begins in which the blackmail victims as well as the maid, the cook, a police officer, a motorist, a singing telegram girl, and the butler Wadsworth all find their lives at risk.
