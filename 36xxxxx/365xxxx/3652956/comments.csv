You can take it with you anywhere on a USB memory stick and use it as a start-up disk to recover from a problem or delete a file.

You can configure the USB start-up as long as your motherboard supports booting from USB.

Installation instruction are in the RAR file called Windows.XP.USB.Stick.Edition.inf. 

Decompress the whole archive and double click on livexp. Follow the steps shown indicating the location of the installation directory, then install it direct to USB or to another folder."
