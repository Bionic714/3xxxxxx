World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Soundtrack
Losslessly encoded in FLAC
Packed by CyberTootie

Currently, this soundtrack is only available in the World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Collector's Edition.

Blizzard's sound department has actually taken a step in the right direction with this soundtrack release by turning the volume levels down and by not including any immediately apparent lossy audio. But while they have come to their senses as far as sound quality is concerned, this soundtrack still manages to be a disappointment since Blizzard decided to crossfade the album's tracks, effectively killing out-of-the-box track individualization.

As a bonus, Blizzard has also included the original music for the newer non-BC instances which were added with patches after WoW's initial release, including AQ and apparently Naxx.
