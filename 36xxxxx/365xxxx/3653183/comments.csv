Whoa there.. gear down big rig. I bought this album a long time ago, and due to the fact that it was fucked up beyond recognition from being at parties and played a billion times, I'm downloading the MP3's to put on my mp3 player. You know what? Even if I had a perfect playable album, I'd probably download the mp3's anyway because 1) It takes less effort than manually ripping them and converting them to MP3's, and 2) Because I purchased the rights to listen to this album a long time ago, and I'm not paying again. 

Also, if you're all for dayglo abortions getting their tracks out into the world and prospering due to their hard work, you should probably be happy that sites that spread their music around to ears that might not have heard it, actually do so; because the last time I checked, like 99% of the population have no idea who the fuck dayglo abortions are. 

The lessons for today:  Be happy that the music is getting heard by people that otherwise might not have heard it. Music is an artform, and despite people might think, its not entirely a commodity. Do not automatically assume that if someone is downloading MP3's, that they are stealing them/ never have purchased them.

Thats right: You got schooled. "

,hailstrrm,2011-01-24T08:13Z,"I also own this, but it's currently at my moms. Just because we download doesn't mean we don't also purchase. Having a hard copy is definitely better than just having the digital.... Clearly you also download if you have an account.
