,JakorDratic,2007-04-13T01:28Z,Umm how exactly does this work? Is it an ISO? and if so do I need a modchip?
,JakorDratic,2007-04-13T23:47Z,"no it's an emu for the wii not t3h pc
I know tat much
I need to know how to use it on my wii"
,manzarek7,2007-04-15T02:04Z,Did anyone find out how to use this on the wii?
,burz,2007-04-19T04:58Z,"I use the VC game on my Wii.  I have a Wiikeys chip install.

Consider upgrading yours cuz its really Kickass !!"
,jahs,2007-05-12T19:53Z,Can you play with four controllers?
,king_oddjob,2007-05-13T02:58Z,AgentNuts: and you're the one to talk mr. psp-player :)
,Ouze,2007-05-21T08:09Z,"The wii seems to be picky about it's discs. With both super paper mario and this one I had to burn 2 copies because it did not recognize the first one. The trick seems to be lowering the burn speed as low as possible. 

You would need a mod chip (i'm using a cyclowiz) to run any unsigned code, this disc included.

I can't comment as to the comment, because you apparently need a gamecube controller to play this disc - the classic controller plugged into a wiimote is not recognized, and i don't (yet) own a GC controller. However it is recognized by the disc channel as a gamecube disc, and it does launch to a menu, which I can't go any further in for said lack of a controller. "
,alforno,2007-05-23T03:33Z,Just finished downloading this thing again and am burning at 1x speed. Hope my wiikey modded wii recognizes this as a gamecube disc. So weird that it worked a couple of times before being unusable. Oh well.
,alforno,2007-05-23T18:37Z,"No luck getting this to work. The version I d/l has a bad mfe-fs.bz2 file. Was going to replace it and make a new image but could not find anything else in the iso but .dol, bz2 and cat file, no games, no emulators. What's going on here?"
,spystyle,2007-06-01T15:22Z,"Someone mentioned the Wii is picky about disks, this is super true!

Both Wii and GameCube are very fussy. For both of them I use ""Ritek G05"" media, I burn with Nero @ 2X.

I haven't found an ISO yet thet doesn't work - while others will comment that it doesn't work mine always does. There is more crappy media out there than good media. So try Ritek G05 and burn SLOWLY!

I will d/l this and try it.

:)"

It's not about the graphics for the wii, it's about game content and fun, and the Wii is leading the gaming consoles, even the overpriced PS3 and the 360.

Nintendos CEO Satoru Iwata is making maaad money and is happy i'm sure, you wanna laugh at? "
,tanpha,2007-07-03T11:46Z,"Been burning at 4X speed on some different cheap brand DVD-Rs with my Pioneer burner, and had zero problem so far. All games work fine.

It's true that Wii's graphic is only about as good as the original Xbox, but the games are fun as hell! The Wii Remote Control made all the difference!"
,StrangeMinge,2007-07-05T18:27Z,"This is pretty dope. NBA Live 95, best game ever!  I've been having a couple issues.  How do you reset the emulator. For example: 

I'm playing nba live 95 for snes and I want to jump to volleyball for nes.  I can reset the snes emulator,  however I can't figure out to go to nes without physically turning the wii off.

I understand you can reset the current emulator you're in to load other games, but I don't know the shortcut to switch consoles without restarting.

Also with mine you can't start it up with the dvd in it. I have to load the wii, then pop the disc in then it works.  So kinda annoying when you have  AHDH like me and like to jump around.  

Please help me if this is even possible."
,iceman3099,2007-07-05T21:09Z,"what is the diff between NTSC and PAL....

,orlavaer,2007-07-18T00:06Z,Delete this piece of fake crap... stop spam those fake torrents assholes....
,dreeder5,2007-07-23T22:46Z,"OK, it boots to the main menu then I have no control. Do you need a wired controller or has anyone gotten this to work with the wii controller?"
,dreeder5,2007-07-24T06:04Z,"I got it. You Do need a wired gamecube controller for this. Great bundle of games and emulators, Thank You for the upload."
,piratfarmor,2007-08-17T12:21Z,"cant anyone make this work for PAL chipped wii? or else I'm just missing something cuz when I burn it on dvd-r the wii cant read the record? very strange.. I really wanna play all these games and not download them and pay for wii points...

thnx"
,timmyhawky,2007-08-23T15:32Z,"If I load an emu, it crashes. If I load the SNES emu, the controller rumbles all the time...

:o"
,tjuvas,2007-09-28T23:11Z,"i have PAL with wiikey, can i play this emu?"
,timmyhawky,2007-10-12T15:43Z,"@d-29er:
You can google for an local modchipping service. They build in the modchip, and if they fail they pay - but first read their service(if they will pay the cost if it fails)"
,kekburost,2007-10-25T02:52Z,Is Chrono Trigger on it?
,icarusone,2007-11-10T21:44Z,"I can't 'freeze' SNES games... When I select Freeze to SDcard, it just restarts the wii.  Same with ""Thaw from SDcard""...

Anyone else having the problem?

And to clarify for everyone else:  Yes, you need a gamecube controller.. It doesn't recognize the wiimote once you've booted the disc, which is recognized as a GC disc."
,jordanfitz9,2007-11-19T22:37Z,"well if ur like me u could download it extract the iso and download emulators but i will try it on my wii 2

,jordanfitz9,2007-11-19T22:39Z,i dont have virtual consel how do i get it without playing cause i dont have my wii online yet cant remeder password 4 dsl and need it 2 get wire less 
,macaro,2008-01-29T20:31Z,"Why such a small amount of roms on one Wii disc? 

Get 4th.Gen.Console.Emulation.for.Wii.GC.REPACK-P10S or 3rd.Gen.Consoles.Plus.Handheld.Games.for.Wii.GC-P10S instead, it has far more roms!"
,xtortedlegacy,2008-04-21T09:50Z,To StrangeMinge or anybody else that does not know.  You can press the yellow c stick on the gamecube controller left or right and it brings up the  menu so you can load up other roms. Hope this helps some of you.
,smurfen89,2008-08-04T22:58Z,"Does somebody know if a functional DS emulator for Nintendo Wii has been released or is being developed?

Some people are saying that it is hard/useless since the DS uses touch screen, but I don't see the problem. The wiimote is perhaps not exactly like touch screen but could be a manageable replacement. The only problem lies in optimizing the DS emulator for the Wii hardware and modders that wants to spend time doing that."
,foikfaftw,2010-03-07T06:10Z,"Not working w/ Wii using GameCube Backup Launcher 0.2.  Tried using patched MIOS v4, v5, v8, and v10.  GCOS loader doesn't do anything.  Can load individual sections (NES, SNES, etc.) but Wii crashes when disc is being mounted to load a ROM.  Firmware 4.2U w/ all latest cIOS installed cleanly.  I think this is strictly for GameCube or hardmodded Wii."
,acr250rider,2010-12-25T22:07Z,DO Not Download game gave  me a VIRUS!!  Had delete my entire wbfs drive made all my games unplayable!! I should have known when utorrent highlighted in RED...Such a retard!! UPLOAD YOUR ASS TOO HELL WHOELSE37..
