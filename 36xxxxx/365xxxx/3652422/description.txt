SYNOPSIS: 	Action hero Steven Seagal makes his directorial debut with this ecologically-sensitive thriller set in the wilds of Alaska. When maverick firefighter Forrest Taft discovers that his employer, Aegis Oil Company, is doing nasty things to the environment, he joins forces with the local Inuit tribe to save their land. Regarded by the Inuits as a warrior messiah, Taft is, in fact, an ex-CIA operative who has squirreled away enough weapons to liquidate a small country. He's a man of honor, of course, who kills only out of necessity -- and Aegis' corporate goons provide him with plenty of reasons to pull the trigger.
