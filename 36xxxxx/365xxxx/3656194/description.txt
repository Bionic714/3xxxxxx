The Dutch role in the Iraq war                                               

KRO Reporter wil answer the question why the Netherlands supported the       
Iraq war.                                                                    

No day passes without bloody news from Baghdad. Kidnappings,                 
assassinations and bombings make up the daily news. Saddam Hussein           
left the stage but further the 2003 war against Iraq brought nothing         
but sorrow. At least 50.000 citizens lost their lifes, more than 3000        
American service men died.                                                   

In march 2003 the Netherlands supported the American assault on Iraq         
that triggered all these problems. Or better stated the first                
government of Prime MInister Balkenende supported the war. Why?              
Because alleged posession of WMD. In the mean time we know better than      
that. What did the Dutch government know when it decided to support          
the war? Was parliament informed sufficiently? KRO Reporter talks to         
the people directly involved in the Dutch decission making process           
and laid their hands on some classified documents that shine a new           
light on the role the Dutch played in the toppling of Saddam.
