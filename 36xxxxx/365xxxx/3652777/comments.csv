Wrong- these turkeys are real Paranoid Conspiracy Theorists.  Still hilarious in it's own way, but lacking the style & sheer breadth of the two Roberts' novel. At least I now know who has been hogging all the acid for the past 30 years."

It is just one big distorsion and misinterpretation of history, I mean you most be a complete idiot to believe this bullcrap. Why people actually take the time to make, distribute, upload and encourage others to see this shit is a complete mystery to me. 

I believe the people who made this saw this as a deliberate effort to make people dumber."
