* BOOTLEG VIDEO *

Nine Inch Nails playing Paris, France live in February 2007.

An mp4 version has previously been released of this show, but since so many people had problems getting it to work properly, here is an avi version that everyone can play.

Enjoy...although it is shot in the audience, so it gives a "real life" feeling which is sometimes a little TOO much ;-)

Seed when you download, cause I can't seed for long - and spread the torrent.
