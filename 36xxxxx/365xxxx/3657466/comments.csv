,Mr Underhill,2007-11-17T17:29Z,"Unfathomable - Why don't you just share a folder on that external HDD  through your UTorrents or whatever you use for downloading and then you won't even have to move it each time and then you'll be able to seed  the files for a little bit. 

As You,  I and everyone else knows every little bit helps and we all do what we can...

Thank you ""elsebasbe"" This definitely works for my collection. I will seed as well :D"
