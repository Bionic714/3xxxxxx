It says that it's nuked on nforce because of this: bad.cue_homemade.iso.of.shareware.web.download.game

That is correct if you use Nero but I managed too burn with alcohol 120%....

And about it be a shareware game.. It's true but if you read on the homepage you activate it too get the full game... But the crack fix that so enjoy this little game...."
,Derc,2007-04-05T19:08Z,"Game works... just mount the .bin file in Daemon Tools V.4.08, go to my computer and find the mounted image there. You'll see the installer .exe and the crack rar file. The .cue is corrupt... however it works if you mount the .bin file. Very boring game."
,Derc,2007-04-05T19:11Z,"almost forgot... when you go through Daemon tools to mount the .bin file, make sure it is set to view ""all files"""
,odietamo,2007-04-09T11:12Z,"oh, crap. I thought it was the opposite. That you were a crazy busdriver with no feeling and only one agenda - to destroy..."
,Blackwing Dragon,2007-04-13T14:39Z,"Piece of crap. Ugly, stupid, bad controls, annoying in itself - sound goes weird after 2-3 mins of playing. useless TRASH."
