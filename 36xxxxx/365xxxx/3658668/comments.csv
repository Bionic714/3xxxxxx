Great quality for only 170MB per episode! I was expecting far less. Best compression ive seen.
Im now hooked on this series, now to get season 3!
:-D  Thanks!"
,jellysheep,2009-03-30T23:51Z,"I agree. Amazing quality. I wonder when these guys will be giving us Season 3. Soon, I hope. :)"
,xaximus,2009-04-06T04:37Z,"Seasons 1 and 2 were posted in 2007, so I'm not optimistic."
,xaximus,2009-04-07T00:44Z,"But wow, it sure is impressive.  I'd love to know, fachman, if there are any plans to release seasons 3 and 4.  Thanks!"
,jellysheep,2009-04-12T17:37Z,How do you contact Fachman directly to ask if there are plans for more Galactica season seeds? I can't find quality that comes close to their uploads! :(
[T],fachman,2009-04-15T12:16Z,"Jellysheep: Actually Season3 was done long time ago, but from Aired not so good quality version with old FASM technique. With my bad connection I prefer to seed Bluray releases first. So maybe later."
