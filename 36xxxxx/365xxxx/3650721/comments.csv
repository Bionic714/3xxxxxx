,factory81,2007-03-31T04:52Z,"Are there certain pages that are not in your favor. Yes this is a tedious waste of time almost even, but I tried to give back for all I have taken from the world's generosity in offering unique BT files.

This was actually taken with flash off. I took about the first 80 pages or so...then I had a girl finish the book, its 116 pages total. Most of her work was iffy (the last quarter of the book). So I  go in and re-do quite a few pages.

These pictures are insanely high res, and if you were not aware you can zoom in to specific areas of the page you are looking for help in. I assure you your monitor cannot display these pictures in its actual size.


This is no PDF rip....I am not sure how those are even made, but I seen a magazine once that was one you would purchase off store shelves. Long story short, you could see creases in PDF file, but it was...scanned 99% sure because the magazine was less fragile. Sure you can download for $12.99 a online stalker guide from prima I believe, but this file will most likely have DRM protection on it.

Maybe I am lazy, but I downloaded a text book for college once and it was a PDF w/ DRM and it couldn't be used on anything but that computer. Only printed

Long story short, there is no way to get this guide perfect every page's A4 size captured in 100% but I tried, and I wouldn't mind fixing a few pages that have glare, or blurry text. 

I took the picture with a good amount of back lighting so that no flash would be used and I could do a macro shot of the page. This isn't ""low quality"", but it is what it is guys....its someone holding a digital camera over a brand new game guide on the floor taking pictures. Damn good job I did if you ask me for my first time. Going through, rotating 116 pictures, re-taking low-quality ones.

I understand what your saying, and I share your thoughts that it isn't perfect in every area. But it isn't absolute junk either. 

Although these guides are a little over-rated in reality.....so free is free eh?
No I took a look at the guide for R6: Vegas from Prima (who makes them all it seems), I was 3/4th the way through the game, and just a little frustrated, and the guide would of helped but it wasn't worth a trip to the store + what they charge. 

Back in the day, it seemed many of these things we find in game guides we buy used to be found in the game booklets."
,Stoooffe,2007-04-05T12:54Z,This is crap ! dont download...
,factory81,2007-04-06T08:37Z,"Hey Stooooooofeee, you got a better guide for the game? You got a better idea? Is that stoof? You think you got all the answers? Lets see your guide stoof. Come on, I'll make you go poof.
Bitch got a problem, say what page is fucked and I'll see to it that the page is re-taken. Until then fuck you, don't ever comment until you have a better solution you hear me pig fucker?"
,Sandpatch,2007-04-06T10:24Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!! This is just crap.
,factory81,2007-04-06T20:49Z,"Demonoid seems to like it, and everyone else.....

Like i said children, until your asses can even grow up to afford things like a $16.99 plus tax guide book, don't be bitching son unless you got a better option for us mmkay?
Until then I will keep working so tax dollars keep you in school hopefully."
,bigoof,2007-04-06T23:36Z,I thank you Factory81.  I will give it a look.  Screw the assholes that criticize but don't produce.  Good lookin' out.
,biglierman,2007-04-08T00:44Z,I also thank you factory81. No problem to read this if you use the zoombutton so stop complaining and be thanksful instead. 
,factory81,2007-04-08T04:09Z,"Yeaaah, I do have a 22"" and 20"" desktop monitor, so when playing Stalker I can even multi-task or per-say have other items open on the 20"" monitor.

And then I also have my notebook as well which is plenty capable, so even if I had to use this guide during the game....Its no problem. Most people here won't enjoy flipping from stalker to image viewer....or printing out stuff.
Never the less, if you use this guide you will totally fly through X18, X16, and so on....it spoils the game even."
,NorwegianSF,2007-04-10T22:50Z,thanks factory! I am stuck in this hopeless mission and this will help alot! thanks man!
,Laej,2007-04-13T16:38Z,Thanks factory81. This is very appreciated. A scanner will yield better results.
,factory81,2007-04-16T09:05Z,"Got more then one scanner, just didn't want to attack the ""binding"" that is on this guide the day I got the book. By the time most of us are done with the book (myself, friends, and others), the pages are damn near falling out.


On top of just trying to be gentle with it. To also note, a scanner would take FOREVER, sure it assures you the crease will be more legible, but given proper lighting / being ""mean"" to the book, you can spread them pages all the way and shoot pics of the page and get great results at the crease. 

116 pages scanned.......that would take a hour or more.
I forgot where though, but online you can buy the PDF format walkthrough guides. If they have DRM enabled, if you took screenshots of the pages one by one (once again TAKE FOREVER), you could compile a game guide or book....
But if you found how to disable DRM or take DRM off a file for PDF's then you can download the game guide (for like $10.99 or $12.99), and share it with us.....heh

I hope more people get in to the hobby of trying to get copies of all kinds of fun stuff.

If you guys actually sit and scan stuff all day though....even though you might achieve an internet ""name"" and get busted by the fed's or something. You don't get any benefit from it. It's not like anyone posts all the other game guides out there for the dozens of games that have them."
,ilikemuffins000,2007-04-20T06:51Z,"Nice man! Keep submitting. You assholes who critisize this shit oughta go lick some donkey dick 'cause you talk the talk but you don't walk the walk you wise-cracking ass cracks. Go fuck yourselves. Oh yeah...thanks factory81. Great work. 
Oh, and just a reminder to all you cock-biters out there, go crawl into a ditch and jack off to your grandma's porn pictures, you dick wads."
,Stork66,2007-08-10T20:39Z,"hey, he tried alright, that's what really matters. Thanks for the effort, factory"
,6230,2007-12-28T23:26Z,"stuck at 71% for 2 weeks now.....THANKXXX :((
If you are not planning to share then remove this worthless piece of shit.."
