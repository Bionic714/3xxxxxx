VNV Nation - Judgement



Review:

Following in the footsteps of 2005's genre-defying "Matter And Form" release, 
future-pop's finest return after a two year break with Brand New album "Judgement". 
Delivering 10 powerful and seductive tracks wreathed in their own unique and unmistakeable sound 
this is sure to propel VNV into the hearts and minds of their ever expanding worldwide fan base. 
From "The Farthest Star" and "Carry You" with their pure VNV euphoric sequencers and emotional and 
aching vocals to the dance floor bombast of "Nemesis" 
( possibly their most aggressive and anthemic dance track ever ) 
with a harsher sound that harkens back to the days of "Praise The Fallen". 
"Descent" is a rhythmically slower, darker more atmospheric affair while "Momentum" is a driving, 
pummelling and grooving foray into trance-tinged Electro. 
"Judgement" finds VNV Nation back at the top of their game, transcending genre boundaries with an accomplished,
powerful and essential album for fans and new converts alike...
