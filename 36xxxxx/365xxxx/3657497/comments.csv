,wademoodyblue,2007-12-21T22:52Z,"Hi Axisround!  Really appreciate you putting this up. I'm late jumping on this..I've seeded almost 8 gig but have been stuck at 86% for awhile now..not sure if anyone with the complete torrent is seeding anymore. I ask for your help in reseeding this..and am willing to help. Just want to know if there's any point continuing on.
Would love to get this..and am excited about Phil's return next year!  Cheers!"
,beundertaker,2008-01-18T14:04Z,"You are truly a god amongst men for posting this

Its too bad Phil Hendrie retired, but you knew his day was to come.  Phil Hendrie will always be my favorite radio personality, nobody has ever made me laugh like Phil Hendrie.

His talent is amazing, how he managed to do this show for years with such great material I do not know.

Bud Dickman is my favorite ""character"" of course.  I love his snotty comebacks, that damn metal plate. =p"
,beundertaker,2008-01-19T18:27Z,"also want to mention

Instead of wanting to create a really huge file, just seperate the Phil Hendrie broadcasts by years."
,beundertaker,2008-01-21T21:27Z,"just finished downloading it.  Seeders got pretty lazy at the end because I was getting as low as 0.3kb/ps

Well I should mention that the audio quality is great.  Will be seeding so enjoy everybody =)"
,djphatd,2008-02-11T14:25Z,"Thanks for this, only 1 seeder but its worth it!  Once I get this I will continue to seed this forever!  "
,djphatd,2008-02-13T07:02Z,Hey thanks Axisround!  Big Hendrie fan!
,djphatd,2008-02-14T12:22Z,"Thanks Axisround, I just finished downloading and will continue to seed for awhile!  Comon people lets try and get more seeders!!!!"
,mafaso,2008-02-21T06:57Z,I just finished downloading and will see for a long time....If anyone has the other torrent (phil_hendrie_show-show_archive-2000-rt) please seed it as I am stuck at 66% on it. I am in Thailand and cannot get his show and I think Phil is THE genius of comedy. I cannot get enough of him. His brain should be put into the Hall of Fame!
,ohioskin28,2008-03-08T08:21Z,"Hey Axis, I have about 400 miscellaneous Hendrie clips. Email me so we can work something out:  ohioskin28 at yahoo"

Do you have the Austin Amarka bit in which ""...a wet nerf ball don't make a retard""? And what about the Vernon Dozier one with the Terry Schiavoesque tube fed wife where Dozier extorts her family to cough up the $? "
,Axisround,2008-12-20T22:00Z,Expect 2000 very soon...
