This is a complete show set of Phil Hendrie's Radio Talk Show from 2006.

It includes every show listed in months and days.

Enjoy - please seed WILDLY so that we can get this off the ground and to a lot of Bud Dickman, Bobby Dooley, RC Collins, and Jay Santos friends!


************************************************************************

If enough people download (due to seeding), I will post more of my collection:

1999-2005

I have a lot of single clips as well, including 'nail a baby to the bed' and 'all you can eat negro' --> the classic stuff.

If you have any of the earlier stuff, comment here and I will get in touch with you about trading/setting up new torrents.


I am still working on getting all shows that are available, and I will create this torrent later (it will be 25GB+, all complete shows, in order).
