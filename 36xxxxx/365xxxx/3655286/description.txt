When we consider ourselves, not as static beings fixed in time but 
as dynamic, ever-changing creatures, our viewpoint of human history 
becomes different and captivating.

The crucial element of "time depth" has revolutionized the very 
questions we ask about ourselves. "Who are we?" has turned into 
"What have we become? What are we becoming?"

What makes this viewpoint possible is the evolutionary perspective 
offered by biological anthropology through the study of the evolution, 
genetics, anatomy, and modern variation within the human species.
