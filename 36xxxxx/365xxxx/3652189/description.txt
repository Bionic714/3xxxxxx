NOTICE #1: This torrent will be uploaded via uTorrent in super-seeding mode. Choke/disconnect abusing clients such as BitComet and BitLord will be aggressively banned by IP address in PeerGuardian. The "patch" to those clients which enables them to masquerade as another client does NOT change their abusive behavior; any peer constantly disconnecting and reconnecting will be banned -- this means the you will never receive seed pieces, only hand-me-downs. If you're a BitComet user, do yourself a favor and get a super-seed supporting client, or you'll get slower DL speeds in this torrent.

Important: If you strangle your upload speed, a super-seeding client (me) will refrain from sending you new seed pieces until it sees previous ones sent to you appear in another peer -- so, the faster your UL speed, the faster you get new pieces.

NOTICE #2: Many of you will be DLing this torrent for season 2 only, since you already have the season 1 Geophage rips. My client will, in super-seed mode, start at the "left", or the beginning -- which will be season 1. If you want the season 2s more quickly, you'll have to "trick" my client by helping me seed season 1s. The way to do this is to pre-allocate the torrent, then stop or cancel the download in the client. Now go move your season 1 copies (which you've obtained elsewhere) to the appropriate places (renaming if necessary). Then relaunch the torrent and make your client re-check the folder (it should register it as half-done). My seeding client will, upon seeing a peer with those files already present, register season 1 as "less rare" and begin sending out season 2 pieces..
