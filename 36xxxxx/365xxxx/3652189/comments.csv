,rodeodude,2007-07-10T22:24Z,Does this mean I can't use BitLord to download this at full speed?
,Pornogrophilia,2007-09-01T01:27Z,"Thanks for uploading this!  The Venture Bros. is one of the best programs on television today.  That's all I've got to say, so now I'll vanish like a fart in a hurricane. ;)"
,Rolovis,2008-03-02T22:58Z,Thank you!
,JTBW316,2008-05-08T01:22Z,"Yo, this is awesome.  I'll keep seeding.  Thanks!"

No TVMA or Adult Swim logos..."
,mike18xx,2008-06-07T03:28Z,"Wow! You're a mod fuckin' *genius* to notice that the DVDs are out a year after the fuckin' torrent was posted!

BTW, just because there are DVDs doesn't mean that the poster who upped rips of 'em did a good job.

233mb TVrips done right will blow away away 175mb DVDrips in terms of quality (providing they're decently treated, of course)."
,res6jya6,2008-06-22T06:47Z,"To all of you that are seeding: THANK YOU! I have been stuck at 2kbps for the past week, now finally getting something a LITTLE better - but PLEASE is people seed this and let it finish, I will seed every night all night"
,res6jya6,2008-06-23T08:27Z,"96.6 % complete --- 18.4kb d/l

So close! Yet --- so far. "
,Pinksirius,2008-08-01T01:45Z,Nice upload :) Been seeding it for a while now.
,noway.fu,2008-09-20T02:19Z,Thanks got great speeds too! Will seed to at least 1.0 :)
,Draecoda,2009-01-23T16:21Z,"Hmmm, this is the first time where I've downloaded something, but after a 24 hour period it still has not started... Are people infact seeding this, and if so are they all from piratebay or another site that I must register on?"
,softwareman2471,2009-07-14T05:51Z,"you all suck, 141 people and only 13 are online! wow give me a break. and only 4 of them are actually giving any kb/s, i mean it only adds up to like 14 kbs!

download and seed, its not that hard!"
,skunk_one,2009-12-05T11:19Z,"so for all you people out there complaining about DL speed, try reading what the upper wrote before you click download, just use utorrent and you'll have no problem"
,synchro_w,2010-03-10T02:21Z,"i always use uTorrent. it is easily the most effective client for torrents.
also, i upload to a 1.6 ratio unless there are too many seeds in whixh case there's no point as an upload speed of 1kbs is not worth bothering with. i find it best to upload  at 145kbps at about midnight to mid day thn switch off. try to seed for files that have few seeders.., old comedies, old b&w movies etc. the higher the ratio, the better the dl [well, seems to be that way!!]."
,.ANCIENT.,2010-11-03T07:06Z,"Average download speed of 1150 kB/s was amazing! Thank you to all the generous seeders, and also to mike18xx."

Wow, way to act like a little bitch because someone pointed out that better rips exist for those who didn't know."
