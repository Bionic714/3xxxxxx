,troubleshot,2007-08-15T18:09Z,"I have downloaded this torrent and have it workin, but with a bug or too thus far. Will post more info if and when its fixed.

The version you are downloading (this version) is geared for private servers, and not to run on Blizzard servers, however to fix this is easy, just open the WoW folder and edit the realmlist.wtf

Deleted what is currently in there and replace it with the following to access the blizzard servers

""set realmlist us.logon.worldofwarcraft.com
set patchlist us.version.worldofwarcraft.com""

Hope this helps."

,beltenebros,2008-04-24T17:37Z,"Works Great! Thanks for the up! 

You can patch it by changing the realmlist.wtf file to read 
""set realmlist us.logon.worldofwarcraft.com
set patchlist us.version.worldofwarcraft.com""

This will use the Blizz DL'r to patch up to date, then you can change the realmlist.wtf file to whatever server you'd like to play on ..."
,Enemy04,2008-04-26T19:45Z,"listen guys, to play wow you have to download normal version too. Burning Crusade is the expansion. 

To play payed, you have to buy normal wow and expansion which is $ 50, then you have to put the serials and make an account and pay addictional fees, about $ 15 a month.

TO PLAY FREE, only way to play free is using wow private servers, its quite simple.

1. Find the private server of your liking just google wow private servers there will be many sites, there is normal wow servers, and high rate servers with custom stuff, etc.

2. Now you have to make a account on the wow private server simply register an account.

3. Now that you've done that you must go to your wow folder and there will be a file ""realmlist.wtf"" and open it with text edit

4. Erase everything in the text and leave ""set realmlist"" to the server adress. For example: wowfusion.net.

5. now save it and play and write the name and password of your wow private server account in step 2. 

6. You should play now.."
,himter2,2008-04-28T02:30Z,"You dont need to download torrents to get this game, follow the instructions on this free server site 

http://wow.dethpod.com 

or at 

http://wow.dethpod.com/guide.php 

Download the game faster directy from blizzard and then you know theres no keyloggers/virus crap, patch it to current version using the launcher.exe change the realmlist.wtf file to read ""set realmlist wow.dethpod.com"" (without quotes) and your done. This server is Free, with a great bunch of people.
