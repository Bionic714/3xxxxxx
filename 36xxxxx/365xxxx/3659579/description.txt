Episode 1 - "I Fuckin' Miss Cory & Trevor"

Ricky has come up with a surefire way to make a decent living this season: he, Julian and Bubbles steal meat from various grocery stores and sell it in the liquor store parking lot. When Bubbles' third grade teacher, Mrs. Anderson, catches the guys getting baked in the parking lot, she tells them it's never too late to change their path in life. Bubbles feels guilty. Julian decides he needs to get a real job as he can't survive off of the $18/day he's making through meat sales and doesn't want to work with Ricky anymore. Ricky's got a problem: he can't sell his dope. He's got plenty of high-quality weed, and he knows it's worth $12/gram, but no one's buying - especially now that the dicks at the mall are undercutting him at $6/gram. Of course, it's not as good - but it's so cheap, no one cares. Even Lahey, who's been reinstated to the police force and has given up liquor for dope, tells Ricky he's got to drop his price. Meanwhile, Sara explains that Cory and Trevor are in a mental institution because they were on the verge of a nervous breakdown thanks to the fact that Ricky was treating them so badly.
