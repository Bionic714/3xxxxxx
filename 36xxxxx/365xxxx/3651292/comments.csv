For those who have never heard this combionation before it's time you sat down and listened.  
We met all of them at Long Beach Arena during the Mob Rules tour in '81-'82.  Tony Iommi shook everyone's hand and Ronnie Dio sat and spoke to us for over an hour.   True gentlemen.  Love to see Dio back wiht Sabbath... or Rainbow for that matter."
