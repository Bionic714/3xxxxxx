,yourocktoo,2007-08-17T23:11Z,"Works fine but seems to make corrupt settings file (Traktor DJ Studio 3 Settings.xml) when ""syncro start"" is checked in the prefs. Have to replace this settings file with a backup or the default setup for Traktor to start up again. This might be an issue on my mac only. (PPC Powerbook OS 10.4.9) "
