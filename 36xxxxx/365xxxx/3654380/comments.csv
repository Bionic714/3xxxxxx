,GongStar,2007-04-04T01:28Z,You gotta be kidding me...
,oswald1234,2007-04-11T08:51Z,why  are these latest HDTV files all  AVI? They dont join right like the TS files(on my comps.) Let us split them up ourselves if we want. More info. please. Your early stuff was great. What program will join these freaks?THX
,DRAC2GUNZ,2007-04-14T10:04Z,"oswald1234 what you said doesn't make sense. I understand that you want to know how to join the .ts files but what are you saying ""these latest HDTV files all AVI?"" doesn't make sense >.>

I use ""TS.JOIN V.1.2"" to join .ts files. Works fine"
,oswald1234,2007-04-15T01:50Z,"Sorry DRAC2GUNZ,should have been clearer(was tired). 1080p  Mummy returns and happy feet are AVI files, u-571 doesnt work for me.TS files join nice and fast,your right. Just cant join the AVI file movies with any program.Staying away from any AVI 1080p movies.I picked  those 3 sorry ones at once. Hope this one is  TS files.I love HDTVCHINAs movies.Thx bud."
,bigballer,2007-04-16T13:15Z,Any idea how to get these files to play?  VLC doesn't seem to play even though it can play other .ts files.  Mplayer works but you can't switch audio streams.  Please help!
,oswald1234,2007-04-21T08:24Z,"Welcome to the 1080p nightmare bigballer.Get every player and codec you can. Download just the smallest video file of the torrent,check it out,if it dont work--delete it and move on. Its some wierd shit and will drive you insane. It will get better,these guys are great. Ive got a few movies the snot noses have really enjoyed. Good luck bud"
,hurrafor,2007-07-22T17:39Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
