,eadeater,2007-09-17T14:18Z,"To play online you need patch 1.74, which is widely available, but if you use an older no-cd crack with it, it prompts you to update to 1.74 again. Is there a no-cd crack available for the latest version??"
,yodaflo,2007-09-18T16:57Z,well when ive  extracted all to a folder and   with both poweriso and daemon tool  i dont find any files and i try to  install it just get a error it says that i did wrong in first step or something:S

,Dathe1000,2008-01-02T22:12Z,"@Okiza and loymo: I don't mean to be jerk, but if you don't know the stuff you are asking about and don't know how to use Google to find out, then maybe you guys are better off buying the game."
,DarkNexis,2008-01-10T04:52Z,@Okiza It prompts you for the CD key?? I had the original CD at one point and it never prompted me for a Serial...Blasted friend of mine has yet to return it >.>
,bishop88,2008-01-18T05:39Z,Works fine - no extra d/l required for solo play.
,westwoodzxz,2008-04-11T07:29Z,"I got this game working fine and I'll tell you guys how, since it seems that there's a lot of ppl saying that it works fine but not saying how. It's the same procedure as what xeroy said but I'll just go more in depth.

1. downloaded the file
2. unrared the only rar file in the folder into a new folder, doesnt matter where, I did it on the desktop.
(I didn't have to mount anything using Daemon, but if for some reason you feel that you need to, just mount the 'DIAG' file in the unrared folder then follow step 3.)
3. I installed the game using the installer in the unrared folder.
4. I then installed the update v1.09 enclosed in the 'Crack' folder which is in the unrared folder as well.
5. after that is done installing, copy the executable in 'Crack' to where the game was installed on the hard drive (usually C:/Program Files/Firaxis Games/Sid Meier's Civilization 4) and replace the existing one. (the file should look like the top of a pillar).
6. After that's done you can delete the new folder that you unrared everything to and unmount everything as well.
7. The next step is to just play the game(double click the new icon on the desktop...duh.)...

It should be as simple as that unless you misread something, or your computer is gay.

by the way, if you get a new text file named 'diag' on the desktop, just move it to the folder where the game's installed, that's just what i did. It's as simple as that :)

Thanks reflex69 for the download, easy for even me."
