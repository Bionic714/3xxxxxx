,GANGSTER01,2007-05-28T20:17Z,SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF SHIT TO ME!
,blahtsk,2007-06-10T09:09Z,"Thanks, looks interesting. Rated highly on amazon too."
,Maoxx,2007-08-12T15:06Z,"Dawkins is a pompous dick and every bit as dogmatic as the religious fanatics he is critisizing. Read Sam Harris instead. His works on biology suck ass too, read Steven Pinker instead."
,doirebhoy,2007-11-24T01:51Z,"Sorry for being ignorant folks, but whats this about?  It seems interesting."
,noradwizard,2007-12-07T20:39Z,listened to some of this and its great
[T],pastafari,2007-12-19T19:36Z,thanks for sharing this. dawkins rocks!
,jordymarkus,2007-12-24T11:02Z,"i just watched a, maybe even hostile, interview of dawkins on bbc world and he  talked more sense than that paxman wannabe did (good interview tho). No religion, no wars?"
,Mike727,2008-11-26T03:42Z,"I don't give a shit about anyone's personal opinions when I'm trying to download a pirated file. If we wanted to know what someone thought of the book, we would read a review written by someone who actually knows what they're talking about. Can someone please just post info about the quality of the torrent, not the content?

Fucking tossers."
,twaseverthus,2008-12-29T21:19Z,"he's making oodles of cash from writing books that support the selfish fuckers that don't want God. He's not scientific about it? Ask all the better scientists, the top of their fields guys. Not the high school teacher level of Dawkins. Everybody Dies. It's a 50/50 proposition. believe or not believe. You don't need to fuel The churches or an author with cash. "
,cominagetcha,2010-05-14T03:42Z,"Too right Mike727. Pity the next tosser didn't notice!

For anyone else getting this now, the quality isn't high quality but fine for listening to an audio book. A bit of EQ for personal taste IMO.

twaseverthus, read/listen and learn. It's not a 50/50 choice. One is right or not.

As for the rest of you belivers in a ""supernatural invisible flying magician"" if you just kept religion away from the rest of us and out of schools we wouldn't have the need to oppose you.

Thanks BrightWorldView for the up."
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-12-29T12:57Z,"twaseverthus - LOL @ selfish fuckers who don't want God. Nothing selfish about the disbelief in the lies of man made human religion. 

Also, it isn't a 50/50 chance. And a 50/50 chance of Judeo Christian God, or Odin, or Zeus, or Cthulhu? "
,mnhtapu,2012-01-15T16:43Z,"Dawkins argues with strict reasoning. No doubt he is very intelligent. Though I'm a beleiver, I do respect him for his profound logical reasoning capability. In fact I learned many things from him."
