| Plot summary |
----------------
The Head is the story of Jim, a trade-school student, who awakens one morning to find that his cranium has enlarged to mammoth proportions. A week later, out bursts Roy, a little purple alien with an odd sense of humor, who has taken up residence in Jim's head. Roy needed a place to stay to adapt to the Earth's environment while on a mission to save the world from a power-hungry alien named Gork. Aiding Jim and Roy are his girlfriend, Madelyn, his doctor, Dr. Richard Axel, and a group of "human anomalies". The group consists of Ray, a landscaper who has a lawnmower blade lodged in his skull; Mona, a normal looking woman with a tail; Ivan, who has a mouth in his chest; Raquel, who has an enormous nose and buckteeth; Earl, who has a fishbowl in his mouth; Chin, a long-limbed former-freak show performer; and the annoyingly normal head of the group, Shane Blackman.

| Ripper note |
---------------
After the initial 13 episodes had aired, MTV's Oddities began airing another serial, entitled The Maxx. When The Maxx had finished airing, "The Head" returned with a new batch of episodes, but the focus often shifted from Jim and Roy to the other "human anomalies" they'd befriended - and the new episodes lacked the serial structure that had made the initial run so successful. Shortly after the second season finished airing, The Head (along with "MTV's Oddities") vanished from the airwaves.

The first 13 episodes were released on video under the title The Head Saves the Earth. Snippets from the original airings were left off of the video version (a similar edit was made to The Maxx video) to keep the running time under two hours. The second batch of episodes were never released on video.

Graphic Novel

In 1996, Pocket Books released a graphic novel entitled The Head: A Legend is Born, which was based on an episode that was never filmed. The cover shows a picture of Jim and folds out with a pop-up of what's in his head - namely Roy. The story included the return of Dr. Elliot, who was last seen being probed on a UFO in The Invasion.
