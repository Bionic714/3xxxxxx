,Tylerhad1,2009-03-09T22:06Z,"Wow I couldn't believe that there actually was a torrent for this so I had to get it. I want to thank reelfiles for this quality download.
D/L Speed -5/10 - Took me about 2 full days to download it with seeders ranging from 2-7 at any given time.
Video Quality- 10/10- You may disagree but considering this is animation from 1o+ years ago...
Audio - 7/10 - Some parts are a little quiet but overall there's nothing to really complain about.
DVD Quality - The whole file fit on a regular 4.7g DVD-R and looks great on T.V. No Skips or Audio lags.

Great Download of a long forgotten gem."

,BloodLogic,2009-04-16T20:25Z,"This DVD is a rip off of the Overkill rips. It was done by... reelfiles? All he did was fuck up the files, and then put his tag on Overkill's. Yeah, you're reaaaaaaal cool reeeeeelfiles.

Download MTV's The Head, seasons 1-2 + extras in perfect, mint quality from this other torrent instead:
