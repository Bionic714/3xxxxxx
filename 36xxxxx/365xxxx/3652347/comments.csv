,Lordpeter,2007-04-14T14:20Z,All that I get is a tryout copy.... And i´ve followed the instructions... 
,AdmiralPayne,2007-06-09T01:00Z,"It's fully working, no tryout copy."
,JarlenÃ¤s,2007-06-21T13:24Z,"It doesnt work for me. I have installed it with the install thing. When I open it, it just says ""registration information is invalid. Please reinstall adobe premiere pro""

What to do?"
