i have tried to use it on my pc on emulator but same problem.
am i the only one?"
,jamese13,2008-04-15T13:36Z,"with a playstation image file, you can normally only play it with an emulator. if you want to actually play it on your playstation, you need to mod it, so just google ""playstation mods"" and find one, normally a chip to be soldered into your playstation for around $10, and you can play these on your playstation, just burn them with any software."

,Skaramuche,2009-03-20T21:37Z,"Hey, this torrent is sick--loving the classic stuff.  I never got a chance to play it back in the day.  One question--I can't seem to get the ffVII one working with ePSXe.  It opens and runs, and I can get through the opening cinematic, but once I enter a battle I can't see the menu.  The bottom quarter of the screen is black, with a little blue rectangle where (I think) the ATB bar should be.  I can still hear noises when I hit up or down, and can still select things, and battle works as normal, but I can't see it.  Any tips on which video plugin to switch to, or some similar fix?  I'd just try them all except testing one involves waiting through the whole opening FMV."
,MFGreth1,2009-06-25T06:31Z,"fuck yeah, gonna throw Chrono Trigger on my PSP"
,yashiro2k9,2010-11-18T22:27Z,is this english? im already downloading the parts just want to know that's all...
,yashiro2k9,2010-11-18T22:33Z,it is impossible to burn the image format to play the ps1 mod chip...better play to psx emulator...iso format runs quickly than the cd-disk 
,leavei,2011-04-26T21:56Z,"having problems getting this to work on a mac. disk utility and other mounters really don't want to recognize the img files, i think because of the ccd. any reccomendations?"
,sparkinman,2011-07-18T02:28Z,I have a problem on FF 9... when it comes time to fight I hear the little clicks and such but don't have a menu to do anything with... any way to fix this?  It's so I can press X twice and attack them but if I press the up button and switch I don't know which mob I'm supposed to be hitting or things like that
