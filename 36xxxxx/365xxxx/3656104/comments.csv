,buzzinhornets,2007-04-05T18:17Z,FIXED.  This one Works!
,mrwinner1,2007-04-05T21:39Z,Doesn't seem to work :/
,buzzinhornets,2007-04-06T21:54Z,It works.  It's just I'm the only seeder right now and my isp throttles me sometimes.  Wait a bit until some other seeders come on board.  I got one guy right now who's downloading off me at 90+kB/s...  should be a second seeder soon to help out.
