From leading action sports producer Teton Gravity Research comes a film that departs from the common order of skiing and snowboarding.

Anomaly TGR's newest 16mm and HD ski and snowboard release showcases the freakish and abnormal abilities of today's top athletes as they push the boundary of what is humanly possible. Join these athletes as they forge into a brave new world of riding in locations around the globe. The anomaly unfolds as Jeremy Jones continues to touch the void in Alaska, Erik Roner completes his disturbing two-year vision, Jamie Pierre survives a world record 25-story free fall, legends Seth Morrison and Jeremy Nobis trade lines on a boat trip in Canada and Candide takes his unique style to AK.

Watch the riders adapt to the dynamic mountain terrain in Japan, Morocco, Jackson Hole, Alaska, Aspen, British Columbia, Switzerland, Corsica, Whistler, Oregon, and France.
