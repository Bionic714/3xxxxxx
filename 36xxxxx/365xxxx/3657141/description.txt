Get ready to go where few series have gone before: A sequel that is as successful as its predecessor. Picking up decades after Gene Roddenberry\'s original Star Trek, The Next Generation follows the intergalactic adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew aboard the all-new USS Enterprise NCC-1701D. This phenomenally successful follow-up series ran from 1987 to 1994 and created a new generation of Star Trek fans.
