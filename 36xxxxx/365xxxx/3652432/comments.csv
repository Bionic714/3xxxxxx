,Hotzen88,2007-05-22T07:51Z,"Do I need any software to play these? Also could someone verify this download, seems like too many games to only be a 184mb file.It just really chafes my ass to download files that aren't what they claim to be."
,GongStar,2007-05-23T00:17Z,"Latest versions of Zsnes and Snes9x are included. So there is no additional software needed.
The package would actually have been smaller if I had compressed it but I thought more people would seed it if it was in a playable folder.
That way you can play the games and seed at the same time without taking up extra space on your harddrive."
,Hotzen88,2007-05-25T23:19Z,"Nice up man,thx.After I seed the torrents I have I'll try to upload some good roms I've downloaded."

,Encapsulate,2008-02-12T08:58Z,Thank a lot. All great RPG games.
,Artuir,2008-03-27T11:18Z,"A very late response to Hotzen88 - it's a lot of games in such a ""small"" package because Super Nintendo games were measured in megaBITS. There's 8 bits to every bite - so a 32 megabit cartridge (chrono trigger, FF3, etc.) would in reality dump to about 4MB and some change. Old console games were tiny, man. Some NES games were written in 32kb or less."
