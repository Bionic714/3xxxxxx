,OmniBOT,2007-11-06T04:00Z,"Great stuff! Thanx.
Just one thing .. can we put the PowerISOs daa-format in the grave for, like, EVAR?
All it does is keep PowerISO in business. It's not like it's even a good format. An ISO or compressed ISO would've done the job anytime and no-one would have to get that stupid crap and can easily open it with standard programs.
(incidentally, I know I've put this same comment on several torrents but I do mean it everytime)"
