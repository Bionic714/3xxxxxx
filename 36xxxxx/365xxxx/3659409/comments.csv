,MosaicM,2007-07-21T10:05Z,"Are these abridged or unabridged?

Abridged Robert Jordan is just plain wrong if it is."
,olacete,2007-08-28T12:16Z,"Thanks for the books anonfb! 
I am sending it for maby 3 weeks from now so every one can get it."
,alricflaim,2007-09-17T06:21Z,"Just to let you folks know, Robert Jordan died today (sept. 16th).  He never finished book 12."
,n10city23,2007-10-19T18:23Z,"He did die, but he dictated his intent and all his final plotlines for the book before his death so it will still be published. I am sure the style of writing will be different if not too noticable but it will still be published."

,mUnTe,2008-07-05T22:28Z,"- Book no 8 (The Path of Daggers) in this download has missing parts, from track 11 and onwards. 

Missing several minutes between each track sadly enough, making you think a track has been skipped. Sadly that is not the case. Warning any picky reader/listener ;P.. 
Well it made me grate my teeth anyway.. 
Just a friendly heads up to my fellows so to say, no complaint, i just suggest that anyone of a like mind to consider downloading book no8 from another torrent.

These books are so good that missing the slightest part could anger a saint.."
,Franardo,2008-09-17T20:45Z,Seeding will be greatly appreciated.
,b1naryatr0phy,2009-08-21T23:39Z,"this upload is epic fail. audio skips in many of the parts, the quality and volume of the audio tends to change from part to part, and it's annoying to have to listen to the narrator tell you every time the ""cassette side changes""

there are two much better uploads but i don't see them on piratebay for some reason, i found em at mininova. One is like 18GB of super high quality and the other is like 7GB at good quality. please don't waste seeding power on this one, it's almost a slap in the face to this awesome book/audiobook series."
,c0wz,2009-08-27T02:46Z,vote this thing down! its a casette!
,khosh,2009-10-25T13:27Z,"A lot of clipping, especially in book 5: Fires of Heaven. And copied from c-cassette... Not the best quality. Sometimes muffled sound."
,solidsnake5EEL3,2010-09-13T17:23Z,what is audio book? you listen to it instead of reading it?
