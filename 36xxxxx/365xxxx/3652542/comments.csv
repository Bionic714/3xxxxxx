,Romanian,2007-04-08T17:25Z,pic is good ..BUT how about puttint ALL the movie on the torrent and not ending it 5 mins before the show is over 
,Ols von Wermland,2007-04-09T07:52Z,"Pic is good, not great and the sound is good. It's worth the download if you ask me.  
Works great on my ""Windows Media Player, VLC and Winamp"". 
No sound in ""Media Player classic"" (probably just some codec i dont have). 
Yes it looks like it's the whole movie.

Thx for the upload.
PS. my average DL speed = 397kB/s. "

,ricande,2007-04-13T02:06Z,THIS IS NOT A DVD RIP.. If so the worst ever... It's a cam like all the rest... :(

,thomsol,2007-04-16T17:04Z,"DAMN! DAMN people are dumb, for thinking this is a DVD-Rip.. KInda strange no-one else did a rip, and secondly, there's no source information, about the DVD it's supposed to be ripped from. NTSC/PAL? And son on... Jesus F. Christ, people, THINK!!! ""Huh? A DVD-Rip? I better download it, and look surprised when I find out it's just a joke.."" COME ON, for fucks sake! Man..."
,bigolddirtybastard,2007-04-21T01:57Z,worst movie ever.. FOR GODS SKAKE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON WATCHING THIIISS !! 
,enchantedstorms,2007-04-22T20:59Z,"excellent quality, however the sound was peaked! didn't have the movie punch sound to it, almost like indie sound. overall 10 for picture quality and 6 for the sound out of 10."
,thomsol,2007-04-25T17:23Z,"rub-a-duck:
Moron, that would be a SCREENER, not an official DVD-RiP. To qualify as a real DVD-RiP, it has to be ripped from the official DVD... Or else, I could just record something from TV, on my DVD-recorder, upload it here, and call it a DVD-RiP... Do you see my point...? Maybe you should've never registrated here. 
Have a nice day, and enjoy the ""DVD-RiP""...."
,thomsol,2007-04-25T17:28Z,"Secondly, people giving stating this movie has exellent picture quality, MUST BE BLIND!!! Either that, or your TV is max. 3""!!! Get some glasses..."
,espen1812,2007-05-01T15:31Z,"good quality, but fucking horrible movie!!! arrrgh!! it sucks so hard!!!"
,bigbadwolf24,2007-05-01T20:04Z,"look ppl dont have 2 upload these at least av sum consideration,, stuff like this takes time!!"
