OK, so what you gotta do is get yourself some DVD burning software. If your laptop doesn't have a burner you're going to need one of those first.

Once you get on a computer with the DVD burner, you gotta get a program that burns your shtuff. Most PC's with an internal  DVD burner come with a cheesy burning program like Windows Media or something, but if you want a good one, look around on here for a copy of Nero 8 in the Applications section. Find a copy with easy to understaand instructions with it, and install it on your PC.

Then, using the prompts on the software, burn your sheezy, and get those ripped abs you keep seeing on the infomercial!!!!"
