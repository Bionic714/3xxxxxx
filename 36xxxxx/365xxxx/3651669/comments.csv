,digitalmojave,2007-04-27T17:21Z,"If you are diehard Rolling Stones fan, other than the fact that you shouldn't need to download this stuff, I have nothing to say to you.

To everyone else: The Rolling Stones are a good band. They have all of the features that you expect from a functioning band, and are more than capable of playing their instruments.

However, their popularity is not in line with their music. I encourage you to download their Let It Bleed album. It has quality to it.

Overall, though, the Stones are just a solid band from an era of great music. The lyrics are, of course, there. But, none of their members had the essential grasp on music that allows a person to construct powerful, engaging music that is so often absent from our everyday lives.

I will not stoop so low as to say that the Stones delivered only radio/poppy music. You could honestly do a lot worse than the Rolling Stones. But, if you want music that has more depth, there are many better sources to try.

Emerson/Lake/Palmer (Brain Salad Surgery, Trilogy), The Who (Tommy, Who's Next, Quadrophenia), King Crimson (In the Court of the Crimson King, Lizard), Supertramp (Crime of the Century), Yes (Fragile), Kansas (Song For America), Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here), Moody Blues (A Question of Balance, Days of Future Passed, In Search of Lost Chord, On the Threshold of a Dream), Led Zepelin (Zoso), Alan Parsons Project (Tales of Mystery and Imagination), Genesis (Trick of the Tail)

All of these examples are better examples of well constructed music than the Stones can produce, even in Let it Bleed, which might have been their best album."

,rusketull,2007-08-11T15:55Z,"Oh, PLEASE; come on and seed some! I will seed this perfect collection 20x once I've downloaded it myself!"
,EviLaz,2007-08-24T03:50Z,"Wow, it's funny that most of those bands he mentioned after smack talking the musical value of the stones were prog rock bands, that while good, are not half as entertaining as the Stones.  I mean, Alan Parson's Project?  ELP?  They're good if you're high.  But I wouldn't want to bone to that pompus crap."
,shumacker,2007-10-28T15:40Z,"I've download this same file thought eMule network, and now I'm seeding using this torrent. My upload is limited, but I'll seed until we have a few seeds. PLEASE SEED AFTER THE DOWNLOAD!"

,kirjutama,2008-02-07T06:57Z,"What is it with people who give their opinion when it is not asked for?  Digitalmojave, I know when you get bored of downloading pics of Charlotte Church to wank off to, you sit around thinking you could be a great rock writer, if only someone would notice. The truth is, you sound like a fucking idiot.  Shut the fuck up.  Please?"
,Mkquist,2008-02-10T11:43Z,"digitalmojave - just for the record, I actually logged in and came back to this just to post to ur comment.  I'm sure history (already has) and most people will disagree with you.  Talking out of ur backside really is foolish.  Stones, a great band period.  Iconic.  You can have you opinion, but please don't push ur unwelcome rubbish on others.  No flame war, just an opposing opinion.  Gnite and goodluck."

,NoCode0680,2010-08-06T04:56Z,"This is a terrible torrent, don't waste your time.  And I'm not even talking about quality, which is terrible by the way.  I only dowloaded this for ""Got Live If You Want It"", a CD I own but can't find.  What is on this torrent is just the studio versions of all the songs on that Live album, put into a folder called ""Got Live If You Want It"", they did the same thing with ""Get Yer Ya Yas Out"".  The quality of all the music is terrible, every song has loud hissing or a high pitched tone running through the background.  I just don't get why this person even took the time to put this together.  Or how they thought putting all the studio versions of the songs into folders of the live albums was the same thing."
,PlasticFish,2010-10-24T11:36Z,"Digital,

I'm a huge fan of 70s prog-rock (especially YES around the time of Close to the Edge and Genesis before Gabriel flew the coop). There's some great music there.

I'm also a huge fan of 60s/70s rock'n'roll and blues-rock, and the Stones are indisputably amongst the masters of those 2 genres.

I have no problem having Exile on Main Street parked on the same disk as The Lion Lies Down on Broadway. They're both pivotal albums in the history of 70s music and in the careers of the respective bands who made them. Why should you?

In other words: You may prefer lamb, but that doesn't mean other people can't appreciate a steak. Nor does it mean that one is inherently better than the other."
