,free2besilly,2007-04-14T18:12Z,"anyone got this working and if so, how?"
,free2besilly,2007-04-14T19:45Z,"ok - figured it out.
Best bet it to burn both images straight onto media.  Now, if you don't want to waste a CD, you can get away with uncompressing the main appication onto your hard drive and running the install from there (that would be the smaller of the two .iso files).
On the other hand, you have to burn the language pack on DVD to work.  Once that's complete, open and close your DVD drive, let the autorun kick in and you should see the application load with all the language packs.  I assume mounting a drive will work as well but I have not tried it."
,ANBUKakashi575,2007-05-03T18:01Z,"I have not downloaded the file yet so i might be wrong, but would it not be possible/easier to mount the iso to a virtual drive like daemon tools or alcohol %120? "
,Luxembourg001,2007-07-26T21:47Z,"I have got the Rosetta Stone to work , but I don't know how to get the language packs to work?

I've burned the RosettaDVD using DataDVD with Nero , but it dosent work?

Any help would be appreciated , "
,rhubarb_kid,2007-08-23T20:08Z,"I mounted both files using daemon tools (which I only discovered yesterday and is amazing!)

Rosetta Stone works perfectly - many thanks!!"
,superisak66,2007-08-26T17:02Z,"i got the program to work, but not the language.. dont matter wich iso i mount, both just run the installation. Any/all help appriciated"
,PheOnixXx,2007-09-21T21:31Z,thanks baba2u .... but people seed.....
,miknos,2007-10-20T19:29Z,"Thanks for sharing. Works PERFECT!!!
To install:
1 - Mount Aplication ISO (I use VirtualCloneDrive) and install it. Unmount (you don't have to use it anymore).
2 - Mount DVD ISO and run the installed aplication."
,legin,2007-11-12T22:19Z,Why on earth do so many of these language downloads multiple languages on them?  Are there really people who want to learn 12 languages?  And these specific 12?  Im not going to download a 4+ gig file when all I want is the Spanish version.  Completely ridiculous.
,Lilolefrog,2007-11-29T17:56Z,"First i would like to thank Baba2u for the upload. Second i would like to thank Miknos, his comment helped me to figure how to do this, it works great and is really quite simple after you learn how.
First....mount the installation disk(PowerIso) just double click on the install disk, the install program loads into the Iso driver, click mount. A popup will appear asking where do you want to mount the files. (When you installed your Iso driver it should have created a virtual drive)Put the files into the virtual drive. Next you unmount the virtual drive. Load the language disk into your Iso driver, click on the mount button, a popup asking you where top mount, you mount or put the language file into the same virtual drive as the instalation disk. Once that's done go into your virtual drive and click on the install icon. This should help some of you out.....remember to SEED!!!!"
,MrAlaska,2007-12-27T09:18Z,"legin: You don't have to download all of the files.  Most clients give you an option to skip some, or most of the files."
,egennie,2008-01-07T08:51Z,"did a quick search on google for rs 3 release date and came up with a few dates ranging from august to october 07, so I think this is v.3"
,egennie,2008-01-07T08:54Z,... I meant v.2... this was uploaded in april and v.3 came out in august according to a sloppy quick google search
[V],cezen,2008-01-22T23:33Z,"*Hi all, has anyone actually confirmed through using this that it is indeed all it says it is?  Are ALL the parts to ALL the individual units here?  

*Rosetta Stone does not sell a product with ALL the languages.  THe only thing they have close is a free disc with limited capacity.  

*So.. was this put together from complete copies of ALL the different langauges?  or is this just a copy of the free disc ( which you can get from rosetta stone.com)  .  

*While i have not downloaded and used this particular torrent, it does have the same files listed as the ulitmate language pack which is simply a copy of the free disc from the manufactuerer... call them to get this for FREE without the code written to steal your info.. yes, i love this site and use it ALOT, and 

*yes I am careful about what i download ESPECIALLY when it seems too good to be true.....got a credit card?  buy the software legit from rosetta stone, call them in 1 month ( after you made your own iso) and get ALL your money back except shipping.  Works like a charm and they don't ask questions.  

*Another thing, i have found that the languages that are listed individually in the torrent index are legitimate and have not been messed with as far as hidden apps/exe files.  I have had no bad experiences with downloading the individual languages and using them.  

* so basically, a word of caution to anyone downloading these mega files, they MAY not really be what you think, but just the trial verision and until someone writes that they have tested such and such language through ALL the levels with ALl the features I will maintain that caution should be used.  I spoke with John Ramsey at www.rosettastone.com  (legal department) and confirmed that indeed there was never one disc wtih all languages included except the partial use disc that is free.

,ohiojones,2008-02-17T03:43Z,anyone able to refute cezen's theory? i'd hate to download a 4 gig file just for a trial...
,LoSt187,2008-03-19T18:20Z,"did you check harddrive space? i got that once it meant i only had 5.4 mb left on my hd. so i went out and got another 250 gig.
and does anyone have word on cezen's point? From the simple # of seeds and leeches i think this is something legit, but you never can tell."
,Keith_Weagle,2008-03-21T02:04Z,"alright, help would be appreciated, I mounted the two images to virtual DVDs using daemon tools, but everytime I try to install the damn thing I get to Run Installer before getting this error message. ""Error executing file.
F:/setup.exe
The requested operation requires elevation.""
I don't know how to fix this... some help would be nice."
,MeanMrKite,2008-04-05T08:05Z,"OK, I'm new at this.  I'd like to run Rosetta Stone GERMAN.  Could someone direct me to a proper V3 Rosetta Stone Installer torrent?  A link would be fine. 
After I download that torrent, please briefly describe what I need to do (i.e. burn the ISO file to CD?).  How does this all work?  Any specifics help.
After I install the main program, I then download the language package I want? 
Any help would be great.  Don't try to direct me to virus-filled files - I check before downloading.
THANKS!!!!"

This torrent does not allow you to pick which languages you would like to download. What I would recommend, instead of using Version 2, is to download Version 3. This way, you can download the languages you want, instead of downloading them all and deleting them later. If interested, here you go.

Go to this torrent and follow the instructions I left in my comment on page 2.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3852202/The_Rosetta_Stone_Application_(Version_3)

By the way, here are all the levels for German if you do decided to obtain version 3.

coz it has a habit of not installin downloaded programs "
,straitline,2008-07-07T03:02Z,i finally got mine to work by extrating all files to a folder instead of burning it to dvd--from there went to the setup file and installed from there--mounting this iso i always got an error--but extracting this worked for me and the program works great\thanks guys
,crossfire6,2008-07-15T19:15Z,"Hey guys- I didn't download this particular torrent, but several weeks ago I did download a similar (44 levels of 27 different languages) and that baby runs great!
27 languages?  Of course no one needs so many different languages, but it isn't against the law to want something that you don't yet need. :)
Besides, who the hell knows when you might awake some morning and feel like learning a few words of Persian Farsi, or Mandarin Chinese?

This is great!  And this site is great!  And all of you who work so hard to keep the Bay up and running - you are all GREAT!  And very much appreciated!

I am in the process now of setting up a separate machine dedicated to future downloads, uploads, and seeding.

Thanks again!

,morrison0880,2008-10-30T21:38Z,"Hey all. Go to 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3865583/Rosetta_Stone_Ultimate_Language_Disk_v2.iso
You get every language in an iso file. No Extracting, all you have to do is burn it to a disc with PowerISO or Alcohol and it autostarts when you load it. You can also mount it to your virtual drive. It comes with all the help files, language sheets, and even a bonus language program. Works perfectly. I got this about a year ago and I love it.
Oh, and only 3.62 GB, so it fits perfectly on a DVD, or takes up as little space on your HD as possible. Trust me, this is the easiest way to go. I tried torrents like this, and the set up and installation alone was the biggest pain in the a...With this, no installation is needed.

The file is in ISO format. You don't have to install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E]. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new (E) drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go."
