,0h3x,2007-04-06T18:48Z,If everyone just watches how much they upload and make sure you upload just a bit more than download then torrents can and will theoretically survive. Thanks.
,Max88831,2007-04-06T19:29Z,TRibes 2 what? Vengence or give us more details please!
,0h3x,2007-04-06T22:25Z,"There is only one Tribes 2. No more detail required. Tribes: Vengeance is essentially the 3rd but since another company bought the rights they didn't call it the third. The first was Starsiege: Tribes. Got it, Good!"
,Likay,2007-04-06T23:54Z,"Got it!

btw: Thanx!

:)"
,k-t-m,2007-04-07T12:37Z,"Does this need a CD key for online play? I remember fileplanet giving this out for free, but afaik they don't supply keys any more..."
,0h3x,2007-04-07T18:18Z,"FilePlanet no longer gives this game out at all and yes for online play you need a key, but for solo/LAN you do not. I looked for hours for a genuine keygen so everyone could enjoy some online play, but the game never got popular enough for somebody to think to make one. Sorry. I will continue looking and if I find one I will post a torrent for it."
,Fukasaku Kinji,2007-04-09T03:21Z,"I hawe the game on CD ^^ 
and i hawe 2 cd keys...
xD Ask me and you maybe get one =)"
,0h3x,2007-04-10T00:34Z,"This is just the install, Fukasaku, if you could upload the actual cd image that would be great as this version does not work with a few mods I have tested. Please e-mail me a link to it if you decide to. That would be great.

,[Snow],2007-05-01T15:32Z,I have the game as well and I was just about to install it on my computer. But I remembered that the tracker looking for new versions did not work that good. And it seams that I remembered right. I can not get the game to start. I probably have all the upgrades on my old computer but the graphic card is broken and I do not have the time to take out the hard drive from it. Do you have the upgrades or a link where they can be found?
