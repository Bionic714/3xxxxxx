This book was has been banned in the United States. It describes the only methods by which freedom can survive. People flock to the US believing this is the bastion of freedom. Even a hundred years ago that was only partially true, today it is a lie and a deception. Freedom is dead, Liberty is dead. You can't do anything in this country without the permission of the government and it's getting worse by the day. The Constitution and Bill of Rights are completely ignored and the government is out of control. Can you handle the truth?? If you want to know how bad it really is see the documentary movie "America - Freedom to Fascism". After you see this movie you will understand that the ideas espoused in the book, The Secret Freedom Fighter, is the only way freedom has any hope of being restored. Read it, learn it, live it, and you will become governments worst nightmare.
