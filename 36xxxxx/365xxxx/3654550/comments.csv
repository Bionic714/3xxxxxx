,astratwin,2007-04-04T14:09Z,"Its not fake

It does run as a Gamcube disc. Its an emulator.

Whoelse37 UL it here ready to play on PAL Wii's as i couldnt get GCOS to work"
,astratwin,2007-04-05T01:14Z,"Works great. Cheers for the UL. Really appreciated.

People seem to be seeding & not just snatching it as well which is a good thing as its a great additon to any Wii"
,astratwin,2007-04-05T14:22Z,"You need your Wii chipped to play this.

Burn iso with ImgBurn. Put it in youw Wii.

Wii recognises it as gamecube game & you can boot either emulator you want.

If it's GC why don't you say so, most people (not me...) don't know that there's no wii homebrew yet
****************************************

Some people are never happy. It is free you know. It's not like someones conned you in to buying something you thought was something else.


Im pretty sure everyone knows that they wont be playing anything other than originals in there Wii unless its chipped"
,aderbrock,2007-04-05T23:12Z,This looks very promising. Thanks for the upload if it works!
,bluesquad,2007-04-06T03:46Z,Works great.. Thanks for the UL.
,noz,2007-04-06T19:54Z,Awsome upload. Time for some retro gaming! And PhXAnarchy not to be rude or anything but if you dont know what your talking about the just dont talk at all.
,aderbrock,2007-04-06T23:40Z,Now I have tried it and it works perfectly. Thanks a lot to mr Whoelse37!
,klopas,2007-04-07T00:04Z,So this only works for PAL regison Wii's?

I get the message PhXAnarchy, you are elite.

Just to clarify the whole wii\gamecube issue:

I released it as a Wii Multi-Boot Rom Pack ISO even though it loads in gamecube mode because when uncompressed the .ISO file will not fit on a mini-dvd.

I understand that some people have physically altered gamecubes which allow for full size DVD discs, but not everyone with modded gamecubes can load full size DVDs.

My release was intended for the Wii, and as such I named it as I did.

If there are others who are not as elite as you ""PhXAnarchy"", and they downloaded this for their Wii not knowing the differnce between Wii homebrew and Gamcube Homebrew, as long as it worked, what difference would it make to them?

As for everyone else, I hope everyone enjoys the release. Thank you for the comments."
,Whoelse37,2007-04-07T00:12Z,"On Another Note...

I region coded this disc for PAL.

Some people have reported that they have been able to boot the disc on NTSC consoles.

I have not confirmed this, and I am not sure if it their is any dependancy on which mod chip people are using.

Due to many requests, I will be releasing a NTSC region coded version tomorrow for all to download here on ThePirateBay."
,Whoelse37,2007-04-07T08:14Z,"I just released the NTSC version. It can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3657707

For all of you PAL gamers... DJEKZANA created some great cover art for this release. With permission the cover art has been included in the NTSC release.

I highly suggest that anyone who is intersted in the cover art download it from the NTSC release.

:o)"
,petergriffin20,2007-04-07T22:35Z,Can all the emulators be burnt onto 1 disc? 
,Whoelse37,2007-04-08T01:10Z,"Yes, it is a single ISO file which is burn a single disc. "
,HesaPesa,2007-04-08T18:57Z,Denna release fungerar ej!
,Nekhti,2007-04-09T11:01Z,"How do I burn this thingy? If I unpack the ""NES (772) PCE (96) SMD (713) SMS (268) SNES (744) ROM Pack - PAL.iso""-file wich I get from unpacking all the rar-files I just get three new files wich I don't know what to do about.

How can the big ISO-file of 2,03GB unpack to ~6MB?"
,megen,2007-04-12T17:51Z,This is the same version as the NTSC version. I have a PAL wii chipped with WIIKEY. It still does not work. It locks on the boot menu. I dont understand. Does is work for someone wit a PAL wii?????????? 
,swedench,2007-04-21T11:52Z,"can i use ""Classic Controller"" or is it the Gamecube controller to use?"
,cemyaman@1,2007-04-24T04:22Z,"downloaded and burned as described and my chipped wii does recognise as a game cube disc but when i select it my wiimote goes out of sync with the console and it freezes. tried burning it three times but the same thing happens all the time. help someone please, what am i doing wrong?"
,priestrules,2007-04-26T00:28Z,"Thank you. This is a must have. It works perfect on my Pal Wii.
I burned it with Nero(4x). You need of course a Gamecube Controller."
,Oxygenal,2007-04-26T16:03Z,Is it possible to connect two gamecube controllers and play Ice Hockey or other 2-player games against each other?
,swedench,2007-04-30T11:21Z,"I downloaded it, No support for Wii classic controller so the Gamecube controller it is... works great you can save and be 2 players...l"
,gonnabeahustla,2007-04-30T18:04Z,"where can i get a chip for my wii and do I install it myself???

sorry for being a noob"
,JWR88,2007-05-07T17:28Z,Thanks very much - just getting into the Wii and enjoyed revisiting some of the older games
,JakorDratic,2007-05-11T07:45Z,"AgentNuts-wii sucks anyway... lol omfg enjoy your crap graphics and stupid ps2 ports! for 5 - 10 years dumbass

You don't have a Wii. Plain and simple. Don't judge what you haven't played. I may not like the price tag on the ps3 is ridiculous but do I go around saying: T3h PS3 sux ur b4775? No. So act like an adult and don't judge.

And you posted the same comment for both versions. the old games are good, in case you haven't realized. Now please don't judge. And as soon as my warranty is up and I've gotten bored w/ my Wii I'm gonna install a Wiikey so I can use this."
,toco123,2007-06-22T11:12Z,Then is possible to make a N64 rom collection for wii
,Grommers,2007-07-04T02:11Z,"Works perfectly with the ""wiid"" chip.

Burned with Nero 7 on a verbatim dvd-r. 6x speed.

You must have a gamecube controller, wii controllers don't work. 

Ebay has lots of cheap gamecube controllers ;-)"

,smurfen89,2008-08-04T22:57Z,"Does somebody know if a functional DS emulator for Nintendo Wii has been released or is being developed?

Some people are saying that it is hard/useless since the DS uses touch screen, but I don't see the problem. The wiimote is perhaps not exactly like touch screen but could be a manageable replacement. The only problem lies in optimizing the DS emulator for the Wii hardware and modders that wants to spend time doing that."
