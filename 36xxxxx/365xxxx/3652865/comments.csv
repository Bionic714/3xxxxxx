personally I think it's sometimes silly to download something someone else could of modified to their 'benifit' instead of d/ling from the source. at least check this download with a checksum."
,meytipeyti,2007-04-02T09:25Z,"Many people download from TPB even if it is a free software.
Why?
Easy guess.....
It is much easier to download all from one site than to wander around in hundreds of websites.
Why not from C|net?....      Obvious.
And the risks are weighted against the benefits.
From my point of view , since there are virtual machines around , it is much easier to download from TPB .
By the way , TPB team are lovely people."
