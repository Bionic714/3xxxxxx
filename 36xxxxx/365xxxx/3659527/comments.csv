,apugarnesh1947,2011-07-22T05:11Z,"i read this a few years ago and was delighted to see this audiobook available. however i was sadly disappointed as the guy reading it has a slightly effeminate and very weak-sounding voice, which imo is not at all apt for a book like this. so i stopped listening after about 10 mins. if the guy who read Wiesel's Night had read this it would've been much better.
