,Apocrathia,2007-04-10T04:21Z,"Yeah, thats a small problem everyone is having with their copies (non-legit).
i believe you just copy the *.xml files from the 3.0 folder.
theyre also having problems with passwords not saving, what you have to do there. is copy the info from your 3.0 connection preference files.
so in your AIM.ini where it says 
usename=suchandsuch
password=scrambledencryptedcrap

you just copy the scrambled encrypted crap into your 4.0 aim.ini or yahoo.ini files (which  i believe are in documentsandsettings/username/applicationdata/trillian) and from there everything should work fine, im sorry i didnt include that in the torrent.

just keep in mind that this is still in alpha phase. and also remember to buy it when its released (i know i am, trillian pro member for 4 years now \m/)"
