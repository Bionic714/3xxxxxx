Chart performance 
 
"You Are Not Alone" became the second most-successful Michael Jackson single released 
 in the Nineties, after "Black or White". The song peaked at number one in many countries 
 around the world, including the UK, the U.S., New Zealand, Ireland, France and Switzerland. 
In the UK it debuted at number three and then climbed to number one where it stayed for 
two weeks. The single remained in the top five for seven weeks and was in the top 75 for 
fifteen weeks. This long run in the charts resulted in a gold sales award. The huge success 
of "You Are Not Alone" pulled HIStory back into the top-ten. 
In the USA, the single broke a Billboard Magazine record by being the first-ever single to 
debut at number one on the Hot 100 singles chart. It also debuted at number one on the 
magazine's R&B chart, where it remained for four weeks. Airplay was excellent with a number 
two peak position on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and a number one position on Billboard's R&B 
Airplay chart (where it stayed for seven weeks). Single sales were strong with a peak position 
of number two on the Billboard Hot 100 Sales chart, number one on the Billboard R&B Sales chart, 
 and number three on the Billboard Maxi-single sales chart. The single went platinum in the USA 
 for sales of over one million copies. 
 
 Music video 
 
The music video was controversial in that it featured an almost nude Jackson and his ex-wife 
Lisa Marie Presley. However it soon became a firm favorite amongst female fans.
