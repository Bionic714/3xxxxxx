,granib,2007-03-31T10:07Z,is that real is it fake plzz is it ore not plzzz :D
,granib,2007-03-31T10:07Z,hallo
,Eplekongen,2007-03-31T10:59Z,"This is not fake. It is fully functional!

It worked fine for me, and I am now playing the game."
,Karras,2007-03-31T13:05Z,"If this is not a fake, why is the RELOADED-release more than twice the size as this one????

(RELOADED was 3.2 GByte)"
,Izalude,2007-03-31T13:43Z,Reloaded is multi-language.  1gig is a good size for any expansion.
,Vime$,2007-03-31T13:51Z,"seed ppl.... please?

(at first i had over 400 kb now i have 1 kb)"
,Eplekongen,2007-03-31T15:35Z,"The reason why this torrent is a little slow, is because it is only one seeder, and that is me.  When there comes more seeders, the velocity will be much better:-) "
,Vime$,2007-03-31T15:47Z,"one embarassing thing is that ive already dl'ed shivering isles once but i couldnt get it to work :(

then it was like 20 compressed files and .iso files in each and i couldnt get it to work, so i hope this is easier

(im a noob with daemon tools(alcohol 120%), so i hope this'll work eplekongen)"
,TheSadPanda,2007-04-01T04:09Z,"Keep seeding, I was getting like 150 kb/s but now it's something around... 20"
,granib,2007-04-01T11:16Z,"seed plzz com on 30,14% done"
,Eplekongen,2007-04-01T15:23Z,"to Vime$: Only unrar the first rar-file, I think it is called *.r01 or something. (All the compressed files are actually 1 big compressed file that is split into pieces.) When that is done, mount the iso in alcohol or daemontools. It is quite simple! This download however, is only 1 image. No rar-shit here!"
,JimmyTheHand,2007-04-03T02:10Z,"I love you people, with your 200+/kbps uploads.. i will keep seeding for more than a week because of youse."
,JimmyTheHand,2007-04-03T03:20Z,"ok guise, what happened, i had 4.28 availability, now it is just .816 what is wrong with you all!"
,granib,2007-04-03T11:43Z,95% now seed plzz go go :D
,JimmyTheHand,2007-04-03T15:14Z,"Seed please. that is all.

Old File not found. However,a file of the same name was found. No update done since file contents do not match.
Please help me: worf@vipmail.hu"
,Izalude,2007-04-03T17:42Z,"Nevermind, rebooted my computer and it worked."

,Eplekongen,2007-04-18T14:50Z,Yes it works!!!!!
,Eplekongen,2007-04-18T15:01Z,"Quote from www.uesp.net:

""A very serious bug has been found with Shivering Isles that will render the game unplayable after about 50 to 120 hours of play (higher performance systems will be hit sooner). The bug will occur regardless of whether you access SI content or not. The basis of bug is that an internal ""space"" of identification numbers for objects created in the game (e.g., a dropped arrow, a new creature, etc.) becomes exhausted -- at which point the newly created objects disappear from the game world. (CTDs and other problems are also almost certain.) 

    PC Note A patch is available which PC users should install immediately! If you wait until the bug shows up, then not only is your savegame unfixable, but most savegames prior to the one with the bug are highly subject to developing the problem later""

The patch is found her: http://tessource.net/files/file.php?id=10278"
,Eplekongen,2007-04-18T15:10Z,"to Weirdo90:

You are confusing this torrent with an other one. 

You will not get these problems wth this torrent!"
,killerjames,2007-04-29T19:03Z,"I've installed it, but now what? How do I play? Do I need to download a patch?"
,Eplekongen,2007-04-30T20:44Z,travel to bravil and wait 27 hours. 
,usagi121,2007-05-04T15:25Z,do i HAVE to use alchohol 120% cuz i only got deamon tools
,xrabbit,2007-05-12T14:49Z,if you can't get it to work and have to ask stupid questions.....buy the fucking game.

,l33thaxomg,2007-12-06T15:04Z,it does work right?
,danieljackson,2008-01-06T15:46Z,If i was anyone downloading this torrent i'd be cautious as the normal file size for the elder scrolls shivering isles is 3.02 gig and this file is only 1 gig now note that this one isnt patched but still a patch that is 2 gig?? somethings fishy and it isnt the ocean
,lacavius,2008-02-11T21:53Z,"wow, this is bull shit if i ever saw it. The torrent was updated 1 month before the game was supposed to launch worldwide? hmm... that's an issuse, prob a virus, so watch out"
,juavt,2008-02-18T10:15Z,"""If i was anyone downloading this torrent i'd be cautious as the normal file size for the elder scrolls shivering isles is 3.02 gig and this file is only 1 gig now note that this one isnt patched but still a patch that is 2 gig?? somethings fishy and it isnt the ocean""

You did know that most of the torrent uploaders have cut the German and Spanish language versions aka. Shit off and that's why the release has 2GB off."
,Reaperz,2008-05-26T18:18Z,"I downloaded this, I can't patch it with the SI patch from the website. It get's too 50% and I get this Error: ""Patch Error: Old file not found. However, a file of the same name was found. No update done since file contents do not match""

Anybody tell me how make this where I can patch it please. Thank you Reaper"
,TheDarkLight,2008-06-10T21:52Z,"@Reaperz 

Did you try the UK version patch or prehaps another version? It might be the UK version of the Shivering Isles."
,OblivionGamer49,2008-06-18T01:02Z,I have a ques. I have Oblivion so do I just unrar files and mount and it will run like a seperate disk or do you mount to the same virtual drive as oblivion?
,OblivionGamer49,2008-06-18T02:47Z,Another question ive been playing oblivion and got to the exit of the sewers and then the game crashes.can someone tell me what i can do?
,sc113191,2008-11-25T19:18Z,THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T GOT PATIﾃ起CE! when u have downloaded the expansion and installed blablabla then u do NOTHING! just do something in oblivion walk the hole time circles or hunt some bandits or JUST WHATEVER U WANT! the entrance to shivering isles will come but it needs a little bit of time. 
,HeComes,2011-09-04T16:47Z,Seems legit
