2000 Deep-Dive-Corp. released their first album äsupport your local grooverô on Free Form Records.
The tracks on the album sounded so new and different that the year 2000 was a good one anyway. 
DeepDiveCorp. gained quite some followers immediately, who walk on water for/with them.
Than everything happend fast: in 2001 they released ôblackmail recordingsö incl. the hitsingle ôdeep heartö feat.
Inaya Day and in 2002 äbeware of fake gurusô. One smasher after the other and they don?t stop. With the
production of äFreestyle Floatingô (2005) and the move to In-D Rec. the homebase of the band changed 
as well: from cool + wet Hamburg to sunny Ibiza. On the island producer P.M.FM is part of the 
Artist Collective Ibizarre and hosts his own radioshow ôThe Diveö on SONICA 95.2FM
His RMX skills are in demand as well. No surprise with such a wide range of styles and sounds.
Die Dissidenten, Ramesh, Karl Mostl, Zehava Ben, Martin Bottcher, Razoof, Klangstrahler Projekt,
Henry Mancini, Martha & the Muffins, Flipside und Hellmut Hattler have tried them already.
