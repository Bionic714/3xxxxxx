I'd say the best KC-LineUp ever.
Very essential.
WATCH OUT for DAVIE MUIR on multiple percussion;
Wasn't he amazing ?? Look at his mimic when running around-perfectly timing, THAT'S WHAT I CALL ART!!
Thanks for this little piece of memory,
Hans-Helmut.
PS: Is there existing any more video from this period??"

If i remember well, i never heard a violin in this song. Anyway! I like this version more and i couldn't find it anywhere else. I want to extract the audio from it but 3 softwares failed, they say there is no video in the file (:-?). Then i tried to convert it into another video format and again 2 softwares failed. Could anyone tell what's wrong with this video? Thank you!"
