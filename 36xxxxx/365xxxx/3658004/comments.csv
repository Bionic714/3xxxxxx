Been looking for this for 2 years, but sniff...can't suffer the heartbreak of a DVDR stopping and dying at 99.9% (happened once, never again)
Thanks for sharing, patiently waiting for the rip..."
,themajor86,2008-05-20T04:27Z,The English subtitles on this file are incoherent. What do I do? Any suggestions? I cannot speak French!
,themajor86,2008-05-20T04:28Z,"Oh, and I am seeding this torrent."
,zeinabqureshi,2008-07-09T17:29Z,"@daubuxu (if reading:)
Please seed for a few hours (the 829.53 MB torrent of DVDrp Fanfan by you). Some others are seeding but those downloads aren't complete either...please seed for a few hours.
Thanks in advance."
