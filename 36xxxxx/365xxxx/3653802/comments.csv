,DenGladeSvensker,2007-11-01T09:08Z,This is just so beautiful! Found a few old songs with Windir and decided to give the bay a go - LOVE this collection! MUST GO BUY STUFF! Anybody got an idea of where to get Windir albums from Denmark? Like an online store or something like that?
,HerrStormslott,2008-01-19T04:15Z,"Ey fuck you DenGlade something! Valfar Was, and will anlways be NORWEGIAN! He was and is the unthroned king of his kind, the best man who ever lived... Met him once... Got every single note this briliant man ever recorded, now I just want it on my MP3 player."
,HerrStormslott,2008-06-25T02:48Z,"You know what....? I realy support this thing, and I know Valfar would aprove it, but it's just wrong not to mention that if you realy enjoy his music you should by it... He dedicated his entire life to what you are dowloading, we should all make an effort to get our hands on this... Too Valfar, sk책l! ""Her ska donder drikkast!!!"""

I don't think Denglade was saying that windir is from denmark, I think Denglade is from Denmark.

As for purchasing, I bought ""Valfar, Ein Windir"", and that's about the only disc I can find for a reasonable price in the US.  These CD's are very difficult to find... even to download!  Finding a copy in a high quality MP3 or lossless Flac is basically impossible.  

Speaking of, I'm downloading this now (it's my 3rd Windir discography, let's hope it's good quality cuz the others were not)... anyone know what the bitrates of these albums are?!"
