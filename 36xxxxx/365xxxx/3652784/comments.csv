Thank you cdomeij for sharing this movie.

Leslie Howard was a great actor and I look forward to completing the download and enjoying this film which he produced and directed."

,francisfordcopulate,2012-01-23T17:52Z,"Those interested should be aware this is from the same source as the other avi file going around of this film, an upload of a vhs tape with a homemade menu. I'm appreciative of the chance to see the film, but it really is quite low quality, & those preparing to spend days downloading 4 gigs of this might be better to just get the avi as there's no great difference in quality.

Would be great to find a real dvd rip."
