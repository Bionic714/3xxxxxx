,slechtekont,2007-12-01T12:17Z,"Melfice i dont know if your still seeding this but if you arent can you seed it once more?
The download speed is to slow at the moment. 
It would take me days to get it.
I hope you will read this:)

Thanks in advance."

,melfice26,2008-01-16T19:41Z,"Is your drive formatted as NTFS or Fat32.
A fat32 drive doesn't supprot files over 4 Gigs.
If this is the case, just format your drive to NTFS.
