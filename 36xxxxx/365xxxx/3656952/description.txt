This got banned at another site.  Apparently this is really Capitol Records 1973 and has bits and pieces used in commercial dvds.  Thanks to the fans who pointed this out.  They also have pointed out that this is a major upgrade.  According to the artwork the show was filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1974.  Apparently this ain\\\'t so.

This is a newly discovered, and newly booted video.  I drank the bootlegger hype and purchased it.  It is 178 minutes long.  It was supposed to be master quality, it doesn?t seem to be to me, its sound is a bit weak, and it has a very annoying black bar in the picture.  Also, it was said to be a DVD-9, and it?s not.  Having said that, from everything I?ve read this video wasn?t even known to exist until now.  So I figured I share it here with the community. Artwork scans included.
