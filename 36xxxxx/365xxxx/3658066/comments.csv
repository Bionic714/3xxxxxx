Hi there.

To open subtitles with a movie I'd suggest using k-lite, which is both a codec and a program. If you name the subtitles the same as your movie (Except the .avi part), it'd add the subtitles itself.

You can download it from:

http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm

Please choose the full version :)"
