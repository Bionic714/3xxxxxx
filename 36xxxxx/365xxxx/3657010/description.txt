Peter Weir's haunting and evocative mystery is set in the Australia of 1900, a mystical place where the British have attempted to impose their Christian culture with such tweedy refinements as a girls' boarding school. After gauzily-photographed, nicely underplayed scenes of the girls' budding sexuality being restrained in Victorian corsets, the uptight headmistress (Rachel Roberts) takes them on an outing to Hanging Rock. It's a desolate, primitive, vaguely menacing place, where one can almost feel the presence of ancient pagan spirits. Something -- and there is an unspoken but palpable emphasis on the inherent carnality of the place -- draws four of the girls to explore the rock. Three never return...

Uploader Comments:
I have reedited this version in order to put in the spanish castilian dub and subtitles. For the rest, is ABSOLUTELY UNTOUCHED, including the brilliant menus and quality of image (it's a DVD 9).

It's OUT OF PRINT since 2003. Is the best option about AUDIO REMIX, there are over 5 editions around the world with better image but CRITERION respects the 1.77:1 format and has the BEST AUDIO REMIX DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1

It's a VIDEO_TS carpet, it also contains the COVER SCAN (4,5 Mbytes) plus the cover cd.
