@sandrews: cant u read?? look @: TEXTED LANGUAGES so yes, there are subs ;)"
,Nightwalker05,2007-04-06T11:36Z,"Unfortunatly I've looked into it and it dosent have texted languages, on the DVD case it says it does but its only got english text. Sorry but I cant edit the torrent/post.

As for the seeding, its going to be slow for the first few days during the initial seed, but I am seeding constantly and occasionaly im using systems on other networks, so im doing my best ;)

Sorry about the texted-languages, this is still a quality film and I PLEASE ask that all ppl who download this please seed to 1.1 ratio to show their appreciation to the Film & Torrent. Thanks, Nightwalker."
