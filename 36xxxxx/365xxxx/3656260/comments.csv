,heyjude,2007-04-06T16:08Z,"A truly ""complete"" discography of The Who would encompass many more than 14 albums - ergo this can only be described correctly as ""Incomplete.""

Could the seeder please provide a list of the albums for those actually wanting to have a genuine and complete collection of The Who? It would be nice to know if the rarer and more difficult to find Join Together, Two's Missing & Wine & Glass are included, as well as the bitrates and editions as The Who has expanded editions of much of their catalog.

And yes, an actual seed would also be appreciated."
