,Murphy416,2008-10-01T17:21Z,"""Sound like a load of b-s""

Candy, you ignorant newb. You wouldn't know a load of ""b-s"" if someone dumped on in your living room. Almost all keygens generate a virus signature. I've used quite a number of keygens over the years, and with few exceptions, they've caused virus alerts, never had one do any harm to my computer yet. People posting virus alerts every time they scan a keygen is considerably annoying though. "
,GamingFREAK,2008-12-19T23:03Z,its a trojan virus..
