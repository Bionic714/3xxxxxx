Here it is, the "mother of all Masonry talks", as several have described it. This video has it all. Bill (a former 32nd degree Mason) spends nearly 2.5 hours going over the history, secrets, and political impact of the Lodge and then compares it to the Bible. He shows why the Bible condemns Masonry and gives indisputable reasons for leaving the Lodge. This history of the Craft is discussed and its long association with pagan fertility cults and the Illuminati is explored. Additionally, Bill explains and demonstrates many of the secret signs and tokens by which Masons can recognized one another and can manipulate the business and legal workd to their advantage.
