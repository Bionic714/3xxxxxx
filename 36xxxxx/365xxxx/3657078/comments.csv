,Beksinski,2007-04-08T02:39Z,"The subs are included, use VLC player to play them."
,Pitbullsiran,2007-04-16T06:13Z,Hmmm a correction he is STILL a GREAT DIRECTOR!
,snayle,2007-06-01T01:42Z,"Thanks for this Beksinski! Keep up the good work in preserving extraordinary work right here on pb! 

Note: The credits are quite rapidly cut off the movie. Please don't do this, the movie ends much to abruptly then. Thanks in advance! :>"
