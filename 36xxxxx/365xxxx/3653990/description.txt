Release Notes:

End Of You is a Finnish Gothic Rock band, formed in 2003 
by singer-songwriter Jami Pietilä. Pietilä?s first recruit 
was bassist Lede, an experienced metal performer. They were 
later joined by synth keyboardist Johnny, drummer Mika and 
guitarist Jani.

In 2003, the band produced a video of their first demo song 
Walking With No One. The video raised significant interest 
amongst gothic metal listeners, and in response to this 
positive reception, End of You recorded a 7-song demo album. 
Spinefarm Records? label manager Sami Tenetz took immediate 
interest in the band. After just a few months of negotiations,
 End Of You signed with Spinefarm Records, and the band began 
to record their first album.

In November 2005, the band's first single, Walking With No One, 
was successfully released in Finland. They released their 
much-anticipated second single, Upside Down, and their debut 
album, Unreal, on March 29, 2006.
