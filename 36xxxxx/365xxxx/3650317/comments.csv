,B-manSwe,2007-04-02T10:26Z,"What the fuck is this? 
the movie is in 2 parts like a vcd with a lot of .vob-files like a dvd and no burning program knows what to do with them (cant sort them into dvd-format)...
My guess is that this is a shitload of viruses and spywareS, 

Has anyone out there downloaded this on and suceed burning it and then watched it in a ordinary standalone dvd-player yet?"
,xalireza,2007-04-02T16:40Z,"DVD-Video files reallocation failed. The resulting DVD-Video might be unplayable. Do you want to continue?

Who knows how to burn it to DVD?"

,zorpry,2007-04-04T02:14Z,"Some file is F..... up!
I'd try out 4 diffrent metode og burning. All comes out with the same error message.
The sound in the stard is also messed up.
In all not a fine job.
I must say though, the Video quality is fine.
I'll find another copy on the site.
Thanks anyway man, I 'll guess you intended a good job."

O.K. I have downloaded the Torrent file and it went into a folder.  The folder contains a bunch of .rar files and a few .jpeg files.  I have Nero and tried doing what you said, but when I open up the 300 file it doesn't see any of the .rar and jpeg files there.  How to I move all of those files to Video-TS or how do I convert them to ISO files?

Basically I am trying to get 300 onto a dvd...

Please help!  "
