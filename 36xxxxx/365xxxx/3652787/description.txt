The Allman Joys was an early band with Duane and Gregg Allman fronting. It was originally the Escorts, but it eventually evolved into the Allman Joys. Duane Allman quit highschool to focus his days at home practicing guitar. They auditioned for Bob Dylan's producer, Bob Johnston, at Columbia Records, backing a girl trio called The Sandpipers. In true Beatlesque style, Johnson was more interested in the girls... Eventually, they went on to form Hour Glass and then the Allman Brothers Band.
