,grassbastard,2007-10-09T00:58Z,"this recording would not be 1973 because he died 1973. This would be pre Allman Brothers Band, approx. 1964"
,silverrod4u,2008-05-28T02:31Z,"This would probably be February, March or April of 1966. ABB was formed 3/1969 and Duane died 11/29/1971. This could be the Dial Records Sessions or some studio cuts laid down in April, 1966. I have not listened to it yet. FYI "
