In programme three, Dick and James revisited would-be green 
gardeners Duncan and Steve to see how their urban garden was 
progressing. Then in Cornwall, Dick learned the mysterious art 
of water-divining when he returned to the Moriaty family 
project to build an eco-campsite. Dick, James and Jim also 
visited Chris and Carla Fletcher, who moved to rural Scotland 
to become more self-sufficient.
