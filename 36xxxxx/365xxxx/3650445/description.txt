Microcar MC1 Parts Book Eng/Fre

This is a scan of the 75 page Microcar MC1 2003 parts book.
It\\\'s in grey and i did not have the original, the scan\\\'s are generally good quality (parts pages 200dpi, text pages 100dpi). The source is a scanned printout of the book from the dealer cd, as there is no (paper) book..

This is not a manual, it is the complete parts + schematic.

This will help you understand how the Microcar MC1 is build and for maintenance you now have the partnumbers.
