i compared both paused frame by frame (in vdubmod) for various parts and I'm not just being biased but to my surprise the -d734 release actually overall looked better. there was a little color difference between the two but the -2sd release had a lot more pixelation during motion and especially during quick scene changes. -2sd also cropped more from the top and bottom

good upload tho"
