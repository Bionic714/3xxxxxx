,cbair79,2010-08-31T23:53Z,"Serial:

111-YHL0-53NI

Tested and working..."
,nibinibi,2010-10-25T06:02Z,"The serial 111-YHL0-53NI works. For about ten seconds. Then the program just terminates. I did apply the current updates, which certainly anyone would/should choose to do. Sure would be good if someone could up a real working version of this for us, it's a VERY good program. I've been soaring for years, and this is by far the best simulation I've seen. Too expensive though. Someone got a real WORKING version of this thing, please?"
