- Release Notes
*Recently I did something in AutoGK and it totally 
screwed up my XviD settings. disabled packed bit stream
and NVOP. it messed up the two pass settings and gave 
me a oversized file twice so i had to fix the settings 
and redo the whole thing. (takes about 62min to encode 
video/audio).
*There should be 13 episodes in total this season.
*Enjoy the show!
