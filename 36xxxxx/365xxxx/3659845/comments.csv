,JenxRodwell,2008-06-01T17:29Z,"It doesn't work, even after the patch. When I run Airline69.exe the screen turns black for a few seconds then kicks back into windows and gives me  an error message in German or something."
,BabelonKing,2008-07-21T00:52Z,"The game starts fine, but when I make a new game  it enters the next screen and freezes with a white background for the central area, but still shows the HUD (top & bottom). I've also tried the patch, the game still freezes."
