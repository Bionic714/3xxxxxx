      Kit Descriptions:
 
      Studio 1 & 2 Kits 

      Captured from a wide variety of sources, the Studio 1  &  2  kits

      funky snares, sizzling hi-hats... They're all contained in  these
      two Microdrum banks. 

      MoxBox Kits 

      Lots of 909 kicks, 909 snares and 909 percussion. If true  analog
      retro grooves are what you're after, the MoxBox kits contain  all
      of the 909 sounds you can poke a mouse cursor at! Tweak the decay
      and stretch parameters for some interesting effects! 

      Elektrodrum Kits 

      Blips, beeps and other slick digital sounds from the Puremagnetik
      Elektrodrum sample set. Reprogrammed for the Microdrum sequencing
      engine, all 5 Elektrodrum  Machines  are  immediately  accessible
      from this bank.

      Percussao Kits 

      Bongos, Congas, Djembes, Claves and more!  The Percussao Kits are
      categorized into two hand percussion,  wood,  shakers  and  bells
      sections. There is  also  a  special  Random  macro  control  for
      throwing in surprise fills and alternate grooves.

      Percussion Menus and Groovetracks:

      Each Microdrum bank has been separated into  30 percussion  menus
      for Ableton's Impulse drum sampler.  If you  are  looking  for  a
      one-shot or quick cymbal hit  to throw  in  your  mix,  you  will
      certainly find the sound you're looking for here! 

      Microdrum's Groovetracks contain  preprogrammed  clips  (grooves)
      for each Microdrum bank. To load one up, simply double  click  or
      drag it into your session as a new track.  The  clips  will  load
      with the attached Microdrum bank. This is a good way to  hear the
      potential of Microdrum  and  inspire  new  ideas  for  innovative
      grooves!

      INSTALL STEPS FOR LIVE PACKS - Importing into Ableton's Library

      1) Open the .alp Live Pack contained in this package.

      2) Ableton Live will prompt you to install the Live Pack. Unpack the
         .alp to a location outside of the Ableton library.

      3) After extraction, locate the newly created folder within
         Live's browser.

      4) Right Click (PC), Ctrl Click (OSX) on the folder and choose
         "Manage Project". Live will scan the folder and a project
         properties browser will soon appear on the right.

      5) Scroll to the bottom of the project properties browser and choose
         "Export to Library". All samples and presets will be copied to
         your Ableton Library into a "Puremagnetik" folder for the
         respective instrument.

      6) You can now delete the folder that you extracted in Step 2.


             (Optional) Installing Puremagnetik Info/Lesson Files


      7) Go back to the original folder that you downloaded. Move the
         contents only (not the folder itself) of the "Lesson Files"
         folder to the following location:

        Ableton Library -> Lessons -> Puremagnetik Category.
        If prompted to overwrite the file "CategoryDescriptionEN.txt",
        click NO.

      8) Restart Live and Puremagnetik info/lessons will appear towards
