,Chickpea,2007-09-02T11:03Z,"Anyone have the rarest Bresson of all: Quatre nuits d'un rĂŞveur (1971) 
... aka Four Nights of a Dreamer (USA) ?"
,Bosuil,2007-11-04T10:27Z,Could someone seed please? Stuck at 95.6!
,MattW666,2008-01-21T20:16Z,"Hi, Are there still seeders on this please?
I really would like to d/l Thanks for any help!!!"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-04T09:17Z,"The film IS perfect. Nobody will deny that. Though it's a film about the French Resistance in WWII, the depiction of Nazis is remarkably benign (Bresson gives some cold statistics about the prison during the titles, which he conveniently forgets). The result is a film that could happen to any political prisoner anywhere in the world. 
The reputation of the film is well-deserved.
A must-see film.
The rip is excellent, thanks a lot to *Sealand Pres. the 1st*."

,notdondelillo,2008-08-29T15:22Z,"does anybody know if it is possible to get hold of french subtitles for bresson's films? I'm learning french and have downloaded a couple of his movies, but I would really like to watch them with french subtitles, and not english! anyone?"
,raheesen,2008-10-07T19:29Z,excellent quality...great movie...thanks.
,damnabletable,2009-12-27T05:45Z,"This film is good but as Bresson saw himself in the premiere of his film, the sound should have been lounder from times, Ill relook the film. Bresson complete masterpiece : L"
,damnabletable,2009-12-27T05:47Z,"Nevertheless Bresson is my fav Director by far, am a cinematographer fan of his cinematographe that he so called many times."
,nwcrouch,2010-01-08T16:07Z,"Hey everyone, I would be really grateful for some seeds on this as soon as possible, I have to write an essay on it for a college film class by tuesday and that's not enough time to order the DVD!  

In return, I have a lot of really good old French films  I could upload, from Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol, Renoir etc. in particular a favourite of mine, Truffaut's shamefully underrated 'argent de poche' if anyone's interested.  

In fact, as a thank you, name any film available on dvd and I will personally go buy the dvd and upload it here, I'm really desperate to have this.  Please help!  Thanks for uploading it in the first place, you have great taste! love to all x"
,tre.fire,2010-08-16T21:55Z,Share you bastards! There are 4 of you pricks with 100% downloaded and you all have the seed throttled to nothing. If you aren't going to seed fucking delete the torrent so others can know that selfish motherfuckers took but aren't giving back and they can look elsewhere.
