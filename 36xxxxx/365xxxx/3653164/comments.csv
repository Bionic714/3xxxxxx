,Kintak,2007-05-08T10:00Z,"Yeah what's up with the fucking demos?
The game's only 500MB, but the demos make it 3GB."
,samtheman11,2007-05-23T22:15Z,"Call me crazy but I THINK YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE PARTS YOU WANT ONCE YOU OPEN THE TORRENT!

I use utorrent - so either you're a noob or your client isn't advanced enough to let you choose what to download xD"
,slickman987,2008-01-09T12:19Z,"whats with all the demo. they just slow down the download, dammit!!"
,TheWierd86,2008-06-19T02:27Z,"Nothing personal, but are you stupid?
Included SHIT in a Torrent file that would be 585MB.... embarassing"
,Mik0ri,2010-02-08T05:11Z,"Yeah, just opt out of all the downloads you don't need, no problem.

The game works perfectly, in all game modes, and it has plenty of seeds. (though they're registered as peers because nobody downloaded the junk demos)

9/10, keep up the good work.
(You lost one for unprofessional clutter)"
