- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   Rising from Jönköping/Linköping SWEDEN Grace.Will.Fall delivers a furious mix
   of aggressive high speed rock and modern hardcore that comes up with a
   punkrock attitude. The band started out in late 2002 and already did their
   first show just before Christmas that year.

   After a couple of Demo's, Split 7 inches and compilations the band earned
   more and more great press responses. Beside lots of sweaty live shows
   Grace.Will.Fall also participated on the biggest swedish radio annual
   festival, P3 Popstad.

   After some Line Up changes trough the years the band developed to what they
   are today. Take the energy of Give up the Ghost, the brutality of Raised
   Fist, the chaos of Converge and the creativity of JR Ewing and you will get
   an idea of what Grace.Will.Fall sounds like. They are an explosive reminder
   of what is missing since the glory days of Refused.

   Their first album “Self Titled” is being released by Guideline Records on
   Febuary 2nd 2007 and is the band`s finest release to date.
