High quality/size ratio.
As requested, somewhat more bytes. Better filtering too, although the poor source remains a problem.

It's important to have the best and latest codecs! FAQ: http://users.pandora.be/sniber/yumi.html .
VLC player will not play this properly due to it's crappy internal h264 decoder!

--------------------------

This is the new episode that was aired last sunday. Pls spare us the whine "this is number 15, 17, 9863" or whatever. I don't care. No one does. It has been aired as 16th episode, so it's numbered as 16th.

Next episode: No idea. Try next Monday.
