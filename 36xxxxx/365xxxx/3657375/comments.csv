Sun Solaris (64 bits)
Linux (32 and 64 bits)

,b_trebor,2007-05-01T06:55Z,There is no serial or license with this download...
,rrtakei,2007-06-15T01:33Z,"Could somebody help me with the license?
It says I should copy and paste from an e-mail.
I've search the net without luck..."
,andlabs,2007-06-28T19:08Z,"Probably the serial here will work if SOMEONE PLEASE SEED!!! http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3654747/Mathworks_MATLAB_R2007a

I CAN'T DOWNLOAD ABOUT 5 TORRENTS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SEEDERS"
,andlabs,2007-06-28T19:09Z,"Thank you for seeding

,dawesy,2007-07-12T16:50Z,We need  a licence file to install this - anyone got any ideas?  Serials alone don't work...?
,morehawes,2007-11-07T20:31Z,"I have created a torrent here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3877276

Which contains the cracked license for Mac OS X. May work for other OS but not tested by me.

Thanks,
morehawes"
