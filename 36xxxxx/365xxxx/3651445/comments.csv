This is a time of joy....

Is there any chance that you will continue uploading STAR TREK even after TNG.
Since the DS9-serie is uploaded by another,maybe VOYAGER is preferable.
Best wishes

,snafas,2007-03-31T11:56Z,"Which disc is this? The one before, labelled S7D1, was really S7D2, so which disc is this? I assume it's not the same disc once again."
,icleolion,2007-03-31T18:28Z,Mr_Fear this is S7D2 again.  You already uploaded this disc when u made the S7D1 torrent.  This one should be stopped and S7D1 uploaded please.
,Induktor,2007-04-01T01:30Z,"Thanks a lot for uploading this, Not sure but I think that this is the same DVD S7D2, since DVD S7D1 was really DVD S7D2, this should be DVD S7D1 :D lol, plz can you confirm this?, thanks again for uploading."
,Induktor,2007-04-01T02:29Z,"Confirmed It's S7D2 Again (same as the S7D1 Which is in fact S7D2) I checked CRC against the S7D1 and they are exactly the same.

Mr_Fear Plz post the real S7D1 when U can, thanks a lot.

So does anybody have old Dark Shadows episodes to upload? I loved that show too. If not, can anybody give me an invite to Demonoid, they have some there?
ANyway, thanks again to Mr Fear, and if I can help with other trek stuff, let me know."
