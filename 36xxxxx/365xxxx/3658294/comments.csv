,Hoillbrillan,2007-04-08T14:27Z,Some fine rock tunes here. But is Reo speedwagon a rock band. Doubt it : )
,smurfdok,2007-04-08T15:58Z,"Yes Reo Speedwagon is a band, but they certainly did do Feel Like Mking Love, I think youll find that was Bad Comapny. also, Cuttin Crew did Died in your Arms, NOT Chicago.."
