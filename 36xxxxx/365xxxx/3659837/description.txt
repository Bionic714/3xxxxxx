*those are listed on the cover as Albany, November 16, '76, 
I think anyway they are also from Akron show, there is no 
cut between songs, the sound remains absolutely identical 
and it's a litte improbable that mixer recording from Akron 
misses first three songs and those exactly same are only 
ones taped on sbd in Albany, don't you think?
To verify that, note that after show in Akron Coney Island Baby
was moved into middle of set where it stood till the end of tour, 
so this way it was very supposedly played in Albany as well, 
not right after Sweet Jane as it's presented here. Then these 
songs really must be from Akron performance, which only had 
songs order like this.
**listed as Christchurch, March 8, '75, which is total nonsense,
if Lou really played in Christchurch it was in August, anyway 
this song is from Sydney.
