,zero-kill,2008-07-10T04:10Z,"Nice collection sir, too bad I've all ready got these =[

bit of advice, if you have an .nfo in one folder, you should have one in all, also you don't need two copies of the same image with different names, it only adds bloat. One last thing, you should never mix bitrates, and 64kB/s is atrocious.

Good attempt, and happy seeding."

A million thanks."
