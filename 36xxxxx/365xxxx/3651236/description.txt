DESCRIPTION: This disc was nominated for the 1999 Grammy Award for "Best Orchestral Performance." Gustav Holst's musical legacy rests on the grand orchestral suite called 'The Planets.' Ironically, 'The Planets' is unlike anything found in the Holst oeuvre and is a work the composer considered one of his weaker efforts.'The Planets' is a seven-movement suite scored for large orchestra depicting the astrological personification of each celestial body. 'The Planets' is a showcase for orchestra and each movement has its own distinct character and tonal palette. "Mars, The Bringer of War" opens the suite with a relentless march rhythm that was influenced by the sound of machine guns in the First World War. "Venus, The Bringer of Peace" is a gentle, delicately-scored Debussy-influenced reverie. Holst's personal favorite was "Saturn, The Bringer of Old Age," a noble tone poem with solemn wind and brass writing. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Yoel Levi shine in this music. This is an excellent orchestra that's up to the challenges Holst presents in each movement. The Telarc Surround Sound captures every nuance of orchestration brilliantly, making quite an impact in the big orchestral climaxes as well as in the quieter moments.
