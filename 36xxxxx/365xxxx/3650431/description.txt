An absolute martial arts classic! A couple fights are very poorly executed, but Sammo's choreography and performance--and certainly Casanova Wong's performance--is absolutely top notch. Catch a wonderful glimpse of Sammo at his best.

Plot:	Fighting to save his village from being taken over by brutes, Hua (Casanova Wong) is beaten to a pulp and his mother murdered. Determined to take revenge, Hua learns the art of Wing Chun and takes on the villains with the help of Fei Chun (Sammo Hung).

Overview:	When a young bank teller, Chen Hua (Casanova Wong), uncovers a plot by the bank's owner, Boss Mo (Fung Hak On), to murder the town chief; he soon learns that the would-be evildoers will stop at nothing to get what they want. After learning that he knows exactly what they're up to, Boss Mo's gang kills his mother, in an attempt to flush him out of hiding and eliminate him.

His friend, Fei Chun (Sammo Hung), urges him not to act rashly, not to fall into Boss Mo's trap. Fei Chun suggests that he instead train with his master to learn the Yung Chun (Wing Chun) martial art form. He maintains that this is the only way Chen Hua would be able to stand up to his foes and emerge victorious. What follows is some serious Wing Chun training, and a final battle that will leave you breathless.
