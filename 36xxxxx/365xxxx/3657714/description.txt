With AssetTracker you can get all the info you need from your Windows network. 

You can either let AssetTracker crawl your network via domain/IP-range or use it via a logon-script to be always up-to-date. The innovative GUI lets you take control of your hardware/software/licenses fast and easy.

The 100% transparent VB-Script lets you add custom infos. You choose what you want to track
