,noxiel,2007-11-12T08:06Z,"yeah Stuck at 98.2% I love this band, these cd's are impossible to get, if someone will let me get that last 1.8% I will seed for a week, please help, this band rocks, plus Trent Reznor is on two of the songs singing back up. "
,benjirman,2007-11-26T00:40Z,"Sorry guys i had some mad computer problems and I lost my seeding for a while, ok a long while but I got everything back only problem is I'm not entirely sure how to re-enter the pool to seed everything for you all.  I have the download location set to the spot where all the files are and they are the exact same as they were when I originally created the torrent but it's showing me in uTorrent that I'm stuck where all of you are stuck.  How to I tell uTorrent to just seed everything?  Do I need to recreate the torrent and upload it again?  I'll do whatever it takes to get these cd's to all of you."
,benjirman,2007-11-26T04:23Z,"Ok I just remade the Torrent so if you want these CDs try:

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3909437/Prick_(2_CDs)_-_ReUP.3909437.TPB.torrent

To get them.  Hope that helps, I'll seed 24/7 on this for a long long time (god willing....)"
