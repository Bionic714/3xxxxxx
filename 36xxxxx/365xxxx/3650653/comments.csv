I have been waiting for this ALL MY LIFE! Only Swedish subs??? I'm going to kill myself. Does anyone know how I can get English subtitles for this? Please help!
And by the way: thanks to cdomeij for the best upload ever"
,Abstracta,2007-03-30T19:59Z,"Have just watched part 1, and this has to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I like a lot of european (and scandinavian) dramas, but this is not one of them. But thanks for sharing cdomeij!

So, if you don't know what this is, download just part 1 and check it out yourself. You may like it, and you may not...

BTW, it is a TV-Rip (SVT)."

Have been waiting for this. I have no recordable dvd-player and didn't want to get up in the middle of the night to change video tapes..spoiled as I am with dvd-quality. THanks!"

Truly Appreciated :)"
,schonberg,2007-11-08T08:22Z,Superfin kvalité! Tack så mycket!!
,hysteriko,2007-12-21T01:35Z,"Abstracta!
What did you search for when you landed on this torrent - and then downloaded it?!
Seems like you just want to cram your harddiscs full; because you havent been serious doing a search for either Fassbinder nor Berlin Alexanderplatz.
This is a masterpiece!
Thank's for uploading!"
,Gargoyle242,2007-12-21T19:49Z,It would be very nice to get a seed on this. Can anyone please help? Thank you very much.
