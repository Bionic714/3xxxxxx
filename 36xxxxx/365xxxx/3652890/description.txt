Longchenpa's Great Chariot (over 700 pages)

Commentary to The Great perfection, the Nature of Mind, the Easer of Weariness presents the stages of the Buddhist path from the viewpoint of the Tibetan Nyingma school.



To the primordial stainless light from which stream forth samsara and nirvana;
To the unborn nondual nature, the essence, the way things are that is perfect buddhahood.
To that without existence and nonexistence, without any views of eternalism or nihilism, and with
neither coming nor going,
To that which is not an object of complex conceptions of variety,
To that without notions of good and evil, that neither accepts nor rejects ,
To uncompounded mind itself I bow.
In order to bring all beings to the unsurpassable city of joyous liberation, where the victorious ones
of the three times attained supreme peace, I summarized the essential meaning of the sutras and
tantras. Day and night, I applied my mind to that with unremitting effort and single-minded
devotion. May this Great Chariot of the profound path that liberates from samsara clearly explain
that meaning.
