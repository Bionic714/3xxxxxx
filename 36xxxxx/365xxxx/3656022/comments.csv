,majtymicke,2007-04-05T16:38Z,I will have to check this out and see how the quality is. Thanks.
,stefthekiller,2007-04-05T21:33Z,"hi, im the seeder. most stuff is of exxelent quality (sbd recordings or hq audience) CD6 has the baddest quality because these songs are very rare live and mainly included to make the collection complete. After you've finished downloading could everybody give me some feedback so i can improve it? thanks greetings stefan

,bumletog,2007-04-09T14:44Z,It would have helped a lot if you wrote when these shows were played and where. Since there are hundreds of identical bootlegs around it's kinda impossible to know if I have these or not
