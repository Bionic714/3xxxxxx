--The Ultimate Marilyn Manson Live Collection 2006-- 
WWW.ULTIMATEMANSON.TK <<The Ultimate Marilyn Manson Site>> 

Hello, 

I first want to thank Marilyn Manson and everyone who was ever involved with the band for making the best music in the world. Just another stupid bootleg you maybe think this is.... but it isn\\\'t 

In the summer of 2006 i had an idea of bringing all songs MM ever played live together. I was trading bootlegs for a half year then so i started to put songs with good performance/quality together. I\\\'ve mastered all songs on this release with a program that i\\\'ve used for over 4 years. It was very difficult to get rare performed songs, some of them are MP3 sourced. I\\\'ve worked a fucking year on this now, this release is a MUST HAVE for every manson fan. Funny speeches, great performances, great quality, and fully mastered. (equalized, hiss removed, pops and clicks removed etc.) 

As bonus i included my own made artwork . The back cover doesn\\\'t contain the tracklisting because it doesn\\\'t fit and it\\\'s to keep the pictures intact.
