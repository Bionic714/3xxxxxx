This is the original Command & Conquer Red Alert Soviet Disc for psx converted to psp eboot file. I even added a very naff logo ;-)


I found the red alert psx disk images on this torrent:


there are a lot of psx games on it in case anyones interested.

I converted with autopopstation:

It works fine for me on custom firmware 3.10 oe by dark alex

sometimes stutters a bit when on turbo speed, but totally playable. 

I found it easier to use the joystick than the buttons pad.

drop the folder in /PSP/GAME/ in your memory stick

i couldn't find it anywhere so here it is

hope it works 4 all of u.



I also have allies disk and red alert - retaliation - both discs. 

let me know and i will upload it if people want.

please comment if it works or not.

Enjoy and seed, I wont be able to seed for that long so its up to u guys once there are a few seeders.

Cheers
