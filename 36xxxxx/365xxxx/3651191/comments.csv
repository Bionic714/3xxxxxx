,smokey714,2007-04-08T23:12Z,i got done downloading but while playing the game i got stuck where the intro video and after that the game crashed using 3.10 ea2 alex
,smokey714,2007-04-08T23:13Z,anyone got this torrent fully running? actually playing the game? i got stuck where the intro video or else please re upload thanks.
,smokey714,2007-04-09T09:51Z,dont you need custum firmware like dark alex firmware to play? beside where did u get that 3.30 or do you mean 3.03? are those from sony or alex firmware 
,karlhungus_,2007-04-10T01:10Z,"@sony-bau: dont think you can install custom firmware with your 3.30 installed yet, think 3.03 was the latest you can install custom with. They might find a way to downgrade 3.30 sometime.My advice is dont update any higher and check some psp forums every now and then.

,3TTT5,2007-12-04T14:35Z,"oh yea, im using 3.52 m33-4"
,ChaosKiller,2009-01-28T00:50Z,ffs an eboot created for M33 does NOT need a key.bin. You just copy it to psp\games\gamename\
