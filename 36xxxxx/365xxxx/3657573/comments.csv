,St3am,2008-07-20T18:29Z,"You Should put the System Requirments on your information bit it save s us time 

and thnx for the uploads downloaded alot of games from you and they all work"
,millhouse107,2008-07-26T23:53Z,hey subzero! Im new to this stuff does ripping mean its not the full game? 
,HellreapeR,2008-08-10T14:10Z,"Nice one.
I've noticed your profile, and you have quite allot of good torrentz.
Keep up the good work.

@Everyone Else: The small size of the file means it's compressed, like subzero said.
If you rar a 100 MB file, you will sure notice that after it's rar'ed it will be less MB then before.

Makes it easier to share it ^^"
,xCrystallis,2008-10-13T23:59Z,Definitely NOT a fake. Works great for me. The only problem is that I can't get the music working. x__x
,xCrystallis,2008-10-14T07:51Z,Wow; I'm stupid. Nevermind that. Thanks for the torrent. >w
,Wookieboy,2008-11-27T03:02Z,Ok.. i wanted to check this game out. followed said instructions. and Nada. the Toed file is just a loop of a pot leaf and toed cycleing around it.. but it does nothing at all.. i had to cntrl alt delete it to end. sat there doing nothing but some gay music. sooooo um.. what am i suppose to do from there? 
,Wookieboy,2008-11-27T03:13Z,OK. NM. installing was not what was instructed. had to figure this one out on my own. .. .
,Konkor,2009-04-09T23:23Z,how is it nooby? i dont think you can rip so that means your nooby subzero is awesome and has some good game rips that = quality my friend
,aensland,2009-04-19T15:25Z,"Personally I don't like RIPs, but whatever (imho Chaos Legion w/o the movies is missing the point). Bigger question tho... what's your problem with demonoid? It's a legit (lol) torrent site. I've seen shit sites but demonoid definitely isn't. FFS it's one of the largest torrent sites AND it's been around for years, unlike many fly-by-night crap torrent forums that disappear after 3 months. Your chickenshit accusations (you don't even fucking explain WHY it's not ""save"") make you look stupid because if the site REALLY has problems, do you think it would last this fucking long?! Good god. Use your brains, dude. Either you fucked up the upload procedure, or it got flagged by some dick (how is that the SITE's fault, lol? signups are anon)."
,Brazzers,2009-11-07T17:38Z,"Thanks, Subzero! Although, like aensland said, there really is no point to Chaos Legion without the movies. If you guys want to insert the movies yourself after you've finished downloading this torrent, download this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4605881/PC.Chaos.Legion
(You only need to download disk 2, remove the .out at the end of the file). Once you have that downloaded, mount it with DAEMON Tools and open up the MOVIES folder. Drag and drop each movie from the CD2 to your installed version of this torrent and all of the movies will play normally ingame. The torrent that I'm telling you to download for the movies gets an error while trying to play, that's why you need this torrent. Also, if you get an error while trying to play THIS torrent, click the setup.bat file and let it run. That should clear up most questions about this game, hope I helped."
