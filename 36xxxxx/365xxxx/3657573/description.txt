Game Notes:

  	 Chaos Legion is an intense tale that follows the story of two 
 	 powerful swordsman named Sieg Wahrheit and his old friend Victor 
 	 Delacroix. An incident leads Delacroix to \"fall\" into darkness and 
	 it is Sieg\'s mission to pursue him before the world descends into 
 	 chaos. Blending action adventure and RPG elements, Chaos Legion 
  	 puts a twist on the single player melee by allowing gamers to 
  	 summon a legion of allies to counter the attacks of relentless 
   	 enemies. There are seven different legion units available for 
   	 assistance, each with their own signature weaponry including bow 
   	 and arrows, bombs and swords.
