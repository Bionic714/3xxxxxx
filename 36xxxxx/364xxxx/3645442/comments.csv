The plot: Brad Pitt is the leader of a group called the 12 monkeys, their intent is wipe out the human race with a deadly chemical.
Bruce Willis is chosen to go back into time to prevent this from happening, only to find out that he unknowingly helped it happen."
,patnemsam,2007-08-31T04:18Z,"screw the plot! IMDB if you really need to know! we want to know AV quality! come on guys, useful feedback pls."
,mrockatansky,2008-05-24T03:26Z,Gee Ieviathan thanks for ruining the ending.
,happymonkeywatchtvagain,2008-07-02T17:09Z,"the plot is not about the group 12 monkeys who want to wipe out humankind, it is about a misunderstanding that the group 12 monkeys  intent is wipe out the human race with a deadly chemical, it was not them who did it it was one of the lab tecs who releases the virus at an airport at the end of the film, the plot realy is about a man sent back in time to find the source of the virus to help scientists find a cure. the confusion in the movie is, is burce willis realy a time traveler or a nut case divergent"
,ezminj,2008-10-01T20:06Z,"Seriously, folks... I'm not even close to being a vet at up'n'downloading, but two things I've noticed are basic courtesies:

1) Seed.  Always, and often.  

2) Feedback.  Comment on the upload so everyone knows whether or not it's a good or crap file, hard-coded subs or external... all the stuff you, yourself, would like to know before you dl a movie you're dying for, only to open it up and find hardcore tit mouse porn, dubbed in Swahili, with hardcoded Korean subtitles.  

I'm downin this now, I'll comment back to ya, ginger-b, and let you know how it came out. ;)"
