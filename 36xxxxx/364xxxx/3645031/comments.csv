,eriksson-,2007-03-22T21:49Z,"Just to inform you, the uploader on these types of sites(public torrent) are never the one who releases these types of files. Well there a amatures that captures movies and dvd's. But those are not in original spec(rar). "
,Twinrehz,2007-03-23T11:31Z,"Figures. To top the crap the ONLY program I have found that actually can convert it into something else that I can use, without losing the HD-resolution, requires 23 dollars to use fully, and I can't find a cracked version here on TBP."
,Twinrehz,2007-03-23T15:47Z,Finally found a working cracked version. AWESOME! But where is HD-episode 8?
,Joika5,2007-03-26T23:11Z,"Which is the best player with these? My 3200+, 1gb lagging with VLC an subtitles are come few second too early. :/"
,bbbest55,2007-03-28T18:45Z,"STFU with the whine and thank him for uploading to you, morons. "
,Fregne,2007-03-29T01:28Z,"I really dont see the problem with this format!

There are dozens of free x264 codecs out there. Just pick one and u can use whatever player u want."
