,slyweedw,2007-03-24T13:25Z,"MP3PRo is ""better sound"" (according to nero)
AT A LOWER BIT RATE"

,made-of-technetium,2007-03-24T14:34Z,"Been a while since I Tried it so just gone back & did an experiment.
Using the track ""NIN-Everyday is exactly the same"" I encoded using ""mp3Pro"" & ""Lame mp3 encoder"" & have come to the conclusion I was right in the first place ""mp3Pro"" sucks.
Even at 96kbps ""Lame"" is better although I would recommend 192kbps"
,slyweedw,2007-03-24T19:43Z,at least ppl are seeding ;)
,slyweedw,2007-03-24T19:44Z,"and somehow lots of ppl need it for want it

,slyweedw,2007-04-03T08:55Z,i guess this is useful...
,Offensor,2008-06-12T20:38Z,"Mp3pro are better than mp3.
For a MP3 224 kbit/s the equivalent is 96 kbit/s in Mp3pro. For 1/2 size of files and the same quality.
