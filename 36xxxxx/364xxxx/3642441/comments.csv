,smokie76,2007-03-19T18:42Z,who gives a fuck 'how' a game is cracked or what methods are used? If the game works then who gives a shit.
,Cleansation,2007-03-19T19:06Z,"Well Vitality's crack does indeed skip the pagefile check, which means people with less RAM (1GB & under) probably will experience crashes and such. I suggest getting this crack if you feel you get alot of ""laggy"" gameplay."
,flyingtriffid,2007-03-20T18:08Z,"So I can download the VITALiTY version (which I'm doing, I don't want to start again ) and copy this crack over and I shouldn't get the reported lag problems? This crack is quite a bit smaller that the VITALiTY one."
,Cleansation,2007-03-20T18:12Z,Yep I did that myself and works perfectly.... 
[T],Knaster,2007-03-20T18:24Z,lol this crack gives more lagg
,Cleansation,2007-03-20T22:01Z,It should only help... Sure it's not just your computer tha is fucked up ? ;)
,xbeo,2007-03-21T15:20Z,works even better than the vitality-crack. thx hatred! it doesnt really matter but u won the round
,ldnik,2007-03-21T16:34Z,"pls pls
i know it sounds stupid, but can someone tell me where to copy this crack file. i mean in bin folder/main folder. i tried for several times but game won't start. thx"
[T],Knaster,2007-03-21T17:22Z,lol i fail to see the difference between vitalitys and this one. I mean both works and both have somewhat laggs i think this is only a piss contest between two hacker teams *cough*nerds*cough*
,brainz,2007-03-23T02:17Z,I've downloaded the ViTALiTY version. And at least for that you don't need any CD-key. My guess is the CD-key is only needed for the multiplayer.
,Slamsarn,2007-03-23T11:34Z,"ViTALiTY < HATRED;
razor1911 = "
,wotan4032,2007-03-24T11:28Z,"after about 12 hours vitality gameplay this one much better. no crashes, laggs rarely (on high video settings and medium pc)"
,corbin59,2007-03-24T19:28Z,Hey guys I'm a total noob at this shit.... this is my first time trying to use torrents... I downloaded the game (VITALITY) and when I was trying to run it I was getting a message saying I inserted the wrong CD/DVD so the guys on the VITALITY page suggested I crack the game... well now I've downloaded this crack but I really have no idea what to do with it... do I just extract the files to the same folder I have everything else in?  I probably have to re-burn a copy of the disc aswell huh?
,legumes,2007-03-24T19:51Z,"I downloaded the ""Unleashed EMUDVD Version"" with the vitality crack, and running on Vista it doesn't work very well... downloading this crack now and about to test it...
But has anyone else experienced problems with Stalker on Vista? ;)"
,Cleansation,2007-03-25T01:07Z,Well stalker isnt supposed to be working on vista at all... A patch should fix that soon tho.
,corbin59,2007-03-25T07:59Z,no one has any suggestions...........
,rickshannon,2007-03-25T19:25Z,"Ditto what Andre says: Installed OK, but when run the game it says ""wrong cd"".  Run the crack and it says ""xrsound.dll missing""  Even copied crack to game folder and no help. WTF, over?  "
,corbin59,2007-03-26T01:51Z,okay so I'm not completely retarded.... I'm new at this but I'm experiencing the exact same situation as the two posts above..... does anyone know how to fuckin work this thing???
,Verwandlung-,2007-03-27T15:53Z,"It works a lot better for me x1950 1gig ram
but it still crashes

many thanks for uploading anyway

,masicuro,2007-04-02T15:45Z,it crashes and give me a problem with gpu.. i have a 3500+ with ati 1800xt and 1 gb ddr.. 
,SandyC89,2007-04-04T17:49Z,"Can somebody help me please! The game works okey but when the game starts I can't se any walls or doors or nothing! Just the sky, does somebody know what the problem is?"
,TrueMusou,2007-04-12T23:56Z,"Hi, I downloaded Hatred's installer and crack. BUT! For whatever reason, I get that Foreign Language Message upon start-up. I then downloaded Vitality's Crack and it started up fine. I really don't like the Vatlity's version much because it lags. I really wanna use the Hatred Crack cause from what I hear, it fixes the lag problem a bit. Can someone help me fix that ""Error Message"" (some sorta eastern european language)?"
,g!assjaw,2007-04-21T02:03Z,"MAYBE someone can help me on this comment board, I downloaded the proper hatred one a couple days ago, deleated a shit load of stuff to fit it on here, and now Ive been looking for the damn CD key for 3 days.  This is kind of pathetic, no help, no instructions, nothing.  yea I am new at this but I've gotten torrents before, but none this difficult."
,whitewolf227,2007-05-07T03:23Z,"Holy CRAP!!!! can someone not have ADD? Corbin, ive been having the ame problem and don't know what the hell to do X_X"
,Sjminter,2007-05-24T17:32Z,Come on come on! Come on come on! 
,<unknown>,2007-08-24T15:35Z,"Why dont just Buy the game and forgot all problems?
Is it just poor peoples that lives on the street here? But how can you have that good computer so you can run stalker then? Hmm,,,

But i prefer to download and save my money for later!
I tried Vitalitys crack and the game craches and the Windows freezes. And i only have 1 GB RAM. Its that the problem? Should i have 2 GB to run with vitality crack?

Or should i try this?"
,Keffman,2007-09-03T22:18Z,For those who havent figured out - (btw hatred wasn that clear about it) You put the crack in the bin directory in your installed stalker dir. :P
,Jarmas,2007-10-01T16:27Z,"Somebody explain!
What shall I do when game says: ""wrong disc"" or something like that?"
,Pirate93,2008-02-27T12:30Z,"iÂ´ve downloaded this torrent and mounted n craced it and everything but the menus are working fine, the asus and gsc comercials are working and the game it self to but all the menus are just black and all u see is the cursor, any ideas how to solve this problem?"
,SEEDITFORME,2008-05-13T01:25Z,"Take my advice and buy the game. It is not worth all the BULLSHIT you go through. I've spent about a week trying to get this pathetic piece of shit to work. No help nothing. Just ""copy crack into bin"" WTF DOES THAT MEAN TO SOMEONE LIKE ME?!?!?! I looked in EVERYTHING. There was no crack... And I've done this before. This is by far the most useless torrent I've ever downloaded. Read the comments. You have about 2/3 saying it works... and about 50/60 asking for help. 'Proper Hatred' is 'proper bullshitter'.
Just vote quality down and give up... As much as I wanted to play I can't since it's not really a game. It's just a bunch of shit hured together in one folder. Sorry but I am PISSED OFF TO THE BRIM."
,nikolaz,2008-05-20T05:37Z,"g!assjaw, if you need a cd key, then try downloading a keygen for this game. When I need a keygen for a game, I just use ares to download a keygen for whatever game I need it for. "
,nikolaz,2008-05-20T05:56Z,"ok...this shit isnt working.

I downloaded the torrent, extracted the files, mounted it, installed, took the crack, copied it in the bin folder. I clicked to run the game, and at last, I thought it was going to work, but lead to disappointment. A black box came up, and had all this shit in it about SOUND: OpenAL shit...then generic  software, Spec version 1.1, then more SOUND: OpenAL shit...then it said Starting RENDER device... and then at the bottom it said Starting engine... then below that is had Loadind DLL: xrGameSpy.dll and then at the very bottom it has >>>l  what is all that shit about, did I do something wrong here?"
,nikolaz,2008-05-20T05:57Z,"oh yeah, that box doesnt go away, i have to start task manager to get it to close"
,nikolaz,2008-05-21T23:46Z,"I have yet not figured out a way to get past this pesky fucking problem. It really sucks because I was so excited after I got in installed and shit cuz i really wanted to play this game. I suppose Ill have to download another torrent for this game and wait more endless hours. YEEEE-FUCKING-HAW!!!! Im not say that this torrent doesn't work, just that it doesn't work FOR ME!!!!"
,rrpostal,2008-09-20T16:19Z,"Why come on this site and beg people not to DL games? I had this game running fine just after it came out but have a new hard drive and windows install so I'm looking for it again. I don't remember which version I had, but this one doesn't sound any harder than other games. My friend always says it's so much easier just to buy the game, but even though he owns a nice machine, he never figured out how ""files"" work. I think it's funny."
