,bludrgn,2008-12-15T01:03Z,"Another TIG welding instructional video.  This is a full ISO, but I'll put up a DIVX version of it too for you guys who are bandwidth crippled.

Enjoy!   

p.s., if you're in the market for excellent welding equipment that's cheaper than Lincoln, Miller, etc, give HTP a call.  Just don't tell them their video is being given away on the intarwebzzz.  :)"
