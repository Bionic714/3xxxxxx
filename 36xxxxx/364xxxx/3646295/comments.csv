,CoLLecToR 91,2007-04-03T21:24Z,"i found a possible resoultion for ur problem, takamidi.

RESOLUTION
There are three workarounds for this problem:
?	Open the resultant BMP using the 'Imaging for Windows' application on either Windows 95, Windows NT, or Windows 2000, and save it again. This saves the bitmap in the standard BMP format.

?	Open the resultant BMP using the IMGEDIT control in Windows 95, Windows NT, or Windows 2000 and do a SaveAs on the image to again save it out as a BMP. This saves the bitmap in the standard BMP format.

?	Create a routine that reads the BMP file and converts it back to the original BITMAPINFOHEADER structure."
