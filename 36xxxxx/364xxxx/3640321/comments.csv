Hooker in the car must be Moneygrubbing José. It´s plain to see. Everyone is jealous at Man United because they are the best. Only way to take their title from them is to buy a football team.

Manchester United rules. Glory, glory Man United !!! P.s Play more british players in british football, Chelsea and Arse. Thanks Poor for doing so even if the spaniardes are coming strongly there."

,aptomper,2008-02-06T09:59Z,"Yeah right. Other fans like Pools and Ciddys sing songs about Munich disaster. Bastards.
Let´s all remember the flowers of Manchester today 6th feb. Love Duncan Edwards"

Fucking hate ManUre, scum of the earth. But it's all grand. No title for the pigs this year.

Chelsea for League and CL."
