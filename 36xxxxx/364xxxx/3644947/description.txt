Duff co-wrote every song but "Gypsy Woman" on the album
with Kara DioGuardi, and she also worked with
producer-songwriter Rhett Lawrence in Toronto, Canada.
Other producers and mixers on the album include Richard
"Humpty" Vission, Tim and Bob and Manny Marroquin, and
will.i.am of hip-hop/R&B group The Black Eyed Peas , Chico
Bennett, Vada Nobles and Fred Wreck have also contributed.
Duff said that compared to her previous music it would be
"more dancey" and make use of more real instruments. "I
don't know exactly how to explain what we're doing, but
it's fun and funky and different, something new for me.
It's really cool", she said. She has also described the
sound of the album as "a little less pop-rock and more
electronic". Michael Paoletta of Billboard magazine
described some of the tracks as having "beats and rhythms
of clubland, with shades of Depeche Mode, Gwen Stefani and
Madonna".
