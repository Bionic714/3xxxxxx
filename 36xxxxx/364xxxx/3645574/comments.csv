Type: Documentary

Rating: NR

Running Time: 96 Minutes

Directed by: Walon Green

Soundtrack: Stevie Wonder

The thesis of this visually stunning documentary feature is that plants have feelings, too, and that they have a variety of ways of expressing them. Based on the best-selling book by Peter Topkins and Christopher Bird, the custom of talking to one's houseplants is strongly recommended by the filmmakers. Though scientific in tone, the film does not air the opposing view advocated by, perhaps, a majority of scientists. One highlight of the film is its original musical score by Stevie Wonder. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide

,Rock222,2009-03-08T19:56Z,"that RTF file youre all worried about is simply that thigny where you have to send an email to like 50 people, and then this company will give you cash or a laptop or the ps3. dont worry though, not virus at all, i believe this guy want lots of referals to get his ps3.

miserando, go to argos and look in there, im sure youll find one :P

But the moral of this epic story is that that RTF is NOT a virus and IS a link to his account on that referal site to get a Ps3

(my hands hurt now) :P"
