If you don't know what movie "The Matrix" is, you can read about it here: 
http://imdb.com/title/tt0133093/

This is the official link for everything Matrix-related, including the
DVD-box:

The wikipedia article describes this official collections details: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Matrix_Collection

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't have to download all of these movies at once. You can select which
ones you want to download if you use for example the
Azureus 2.5.0.4 bittorrent client: 
http://azureus.sourceforge.net/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can watch these movies on your computer if you use for example the
DVD viewing program called "VLC":

This DVD is a part of the ten-DVD box called "The Ultimate Matrix Collection"
that was sold in late 2004. When you download one of the ten DVD:s you can
either burn the resulting file with for example Nero, or mount it with
for example Daemon Tools and play it with for example VLC.

I used DVD Decrypter to rip the DVD:s. I chose to do it in uncompressed mode
(DVD9). The files are therefore larger than usual, but the movies also have
their quality intact compared to the original. They won't fit on a single
layer DVDR, but will fit on a double layer DVDR. If someone would like to
fit them on single layer DVDR:s, that someone could simply compress the
files even further using for example DVD Decrypter.

The whole set of DVD:s takes about 64 GiB.

In the directory of the first DVD I have included pictures of the DVD-box
itself and of the little "manual" that came along. I also photographed the
DVD:s themselves if someone would fancy that :).
However the box I borrowed from my friend didn't contain the "script" for the
movies. So if someone buys the collection box that contains the scripts and
has a digital camera, I would be very happy if that person would be nice and
release the photos. I would like to read the script too. The movies are
really that great! Enjoy and share with your friends and neighbours!

If you like the movies you can thank the Wachowski brothers by sending them
a gift or postcard or something. It is they who are the brains behind these
movies. Don't reward the company Warnerbros. They already have enough money.
Reward Larry and Andy. I don't have their addresses but here are their IMDB
links:

And for those that really liked the Matrix movies would probably like their
next movie called "V for Vendetta" too: 
http://imdb.com/title/tt0434409/

There should be some DVD:s of that movie on thepiratebay.org too.
At the time of this writing, this torrent is alive and seeded:
