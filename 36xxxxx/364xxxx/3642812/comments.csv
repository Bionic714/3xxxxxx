,todu,2007-03-19T22:56Z,Piratebay says there is 0 seeders. But I am seeding. I can seed with 600 KB/s and will do so for a very long time.
,speakeasy,2007-03-19T23:05Z,"Not gonna download this - not enough bandwidth.
Just wanted to be the first to say . . . ""great post""."
,BBu,2007-03-19T23:19Z,"I bought the limited edition of the box 8 month ago for 20 Euro... not much money and you've got the nice bust of Keanu.

And it's much faster than downloading 64.5 GB ;)

But still... good torrent."
,madjock56,2007-03-19T23:25Z,"I never knew Keanu had a nice bust.

I like Trinity better. ;p

,ionut_grigore,2007-03-20T16:41Z,Cool! Cool! Cool! Thankssssssss!
,johnpalley,2007-03-20T20:54Z,im using azureus. how can i only download certain disks if i dont have the space on my computer?
,Mr Sweden,2007-05-03T00:51Z,How come the first Matrix movie has only English subs and no German audio? Does it really come from the Ultimate set?
,todu,2007-05-11T21:35Z,"@Mr Sweden:

Yes, all included discs are from the 10 dvd collection mentioned above. Why it doesn't have swedish subs and german audio, I don't know. But since I ripped the dvd's personally I can promise I ripped them from the original discs.

I checked the discs again and I can verify that the first disc does not have swedish subs and does not have german audio. The other two movies do have both swedish subs and german audio.

The first disc only has english and ""english for hearing impaired"" subtitles, and only english audio."
,todu,2007-05-11T21:41Z,"@Mr Sweden:

You can check the details of what subtitle and audio languages are included in every disc yourself by downloading only the pictures included in this torrent. The pictures are from the manual that was included with the collection. As you can see on picture named: CIMG0221.JPG, swedish is not included on that particular disc.

The pictures are in this folder:

Matrix_Ultimate_Collection/THE_MATRIX_UNCOMPRESSED_DVD_DISC1_OF_10/Cover/"
,Guile814,2007-06-05T23:18Z,Is this NTSC or PAL? Thanks.
,WBHAWK,2007-06-14T15:04Z,"I have the same question: is it NTSC or PAL? And is this the Remastered edition? (Because there's a old release... I think it's from 1999/2000 and there's another one, from 2004 which has a better video: http://anonym.to/?http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare10/the_matrix_.htm)

I just want to download ""The Matrix"" :)"
,WBHAWK,2007-06-14T17:48Z,"I alredy answered my question, yeap it's the Remastered version the one you have uploaded :D

Now... I want to know if it's ""NTSC"" or ""PAL""... and if it has ""Spanish"" subtitles (the link I put says that it has :s) Of course I'm refering to ""The Matrix"" DVD, I alredy have the rest of them.

Thank you in advice!"
,raymondse,2007-10-14T16:30Z,"Please, to all of you who have downloaded this, please seed this torrent. Its a wonderful collection of DVDs and I'm trying my best to downloaded it right now. We really need more seeds for this. I've downloaded two of the ten DVDs and once I'm finished, I'll seed for a whole month as well. Right now, I can only see 1 complete seed and 43 peers.

To todu, keep up the good work! :)"
,JoakimLj,2007-10-21T14:16Z,"WOW! Huge file, but.. I'll be downloading now. Thx :P"
,Inphectus,2007-11-08T05:39Z,"Har spillet MxO(matrix online) amerikans version. siden spillet udkom for en del år siden. Hvis man tænker lidt ""uden for boksen"" og bruger grund koncepterne i ""the Matrix"", så vil du kunne opleve nogle vildt flippet ting. Grænser for hjernen kan skubbes... Tro mig. Ik at du bliver klogere. Men husk at det som er virkelig for hjernen er virkelig for dig. Psykiske syge tror jo virkelig på nogle ting og så er det ægte for dem. Og hvis i/vi som mennesker giver lidt slip på det klem som der bliver lært os fra barndommen ville vi kunne opnå mange skønne ting..."
,Polysaturatedfat,2008-01-29T10:50Z,Holy SHIT that is HUGE!
,spag2008,2008-02-17T18:06Z,"I've never seen such a torrent before. Many many thanks to you. Guys... all you have to do is to SEED it. Otherwise, this legendary release will be dead.

Thanks a lot again."

,stealthpancho,2008-07-31T20:15Z,"Can anybody post ""THE ANIMATRIX"" R1 NTSC DVD! PLEASE!!!!! I'm dieing here! PLEASE!!! THANK YOU!!!"

,RakaDisciple,2008-08-04T13:04Z,Damn dude this rly is the ULTIMATE matrix collection. thx for takin the time to upload sumthin like this. I REALLY REALLY hope i dont download this whole thing and find out its all PAL. since no one has answered that yet.
,SiavashTheOne,2008-08-09T00:06Z,"I can tell that, this was great! I downloaded it. it took me 6 months to completely being downloaded, cause there wasn't any high quality seeders and leechers in the swarm. average speed for me was about 24KB/s while I have a bandwidth of 256KB/s (2Mbps) anyhow I managed to download it completely. thank you all and please seed. seeders are the people that let you download such great stuff"
,da_risk,2008-10-17T10:33Z,"The download speed on this is ridiculously slow... Sorry guys, but I can't wait 6 months..."
,designMS,2008-11-28T05:40Z,"Wow I really appreciate this. I'm only really interested in the Animatrix DVD (I love you for the DVD9) but I might download the other movies as well. Thank you so much.

I will definitely keep this seeded as best as I can. (only 25kb/s) :["
,joshokie,2009-03-17T16:51Z,Thank you for this compendium of Matricity.
,outlawguy89,2009-08-17T03:48Z,"Um, 64.5 gigs and 5 seeders are not a good combination.  I'm going to pass."
,Sanantta,2010-04-01T22:25Z,One of the best torrents I've seen around. Thanks very much my friend for all the effort. I promise I'll keep on seeding once I've finished downloading it.
,Bokolle,2010-06-26T19:17Z,"OMG, 20 kB/s :S i can easily come up to 5mB/s seeeeeeeeeeeeeed !!!"
,T3hSeeder,2011-01-07T08:46Z,"Thanks for the upload!

When downloading there was this one guy who had a connection that allowed an upload speed of at least 120.0 kbps which went well for about a week then he dropped out and the rest downloaded at a variable slower rate which ended at 3 weeks. Sound works on VLC player 1.1.5 incase anyone has problems with sound working.

Thanks for the upload!"
,Sepiatoned,2011-03-04T02:49Z,"Downloading for a long tme now...
But still thank you in advance for this awesome up! one question though, do the movies have the audio commentaries on them?"
,annuit02,2011-10-23T17:13Z,More seeders! Once I download the pieces I can seed for a long time. My share ratios get into the hundreds!
,iLirian,2012-07-03T20:03Z,Damn it! I cant download it. Seed people.
