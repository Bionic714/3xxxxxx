,antmartain,2010-06-15T15:28Z,"Great torrent, fast download, no problems installing from iso, no need to crack and full english translations....But the game is a shitpile. 

Recommended for hardcore Bible Black fans only....as someone who's new to the series, I found this to be so dull that I uninstalled it after 5 minutes of play. But thanks anyway, I'll seed for a bit."
,Sarkasmi,2010-10-04T01:07Z,"^ uninstalled it after 5minutes? Wow. How many games like this do you know that have alot of action (or whatever you want) in the FIRST 5 minutes?

haha... Yeah, I'm gonna believe you it's boring because you experienced 5 minutes of it. Yeah, sure."
,-_TwisT_-,2011-05-04T10:04Z,"@Antmartain: As someone who is also new to the series. Your an Idiot, the Anime is for Hardcore fans of this game.
