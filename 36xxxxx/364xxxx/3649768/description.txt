Movie  Info:


Wilbur the pig is scared of the end of the season, because he knows that 
come that time, he will end up on the dinner table. He hatches a plan with 
Charlotte, a spider that lives in his pen, to ensure that this will 
never happen. 


Release Info:

Yes, this is our own subtitles. Look in the included file called wwwsubs.rar
there, you'll find a couple of pics from the releaseday. No subtitles for this
release on the 3 swedish subtitlesites. 

Just becaues we tagged this one with REAL it doesn't mean that we have agreed 
on nRon's stupid rule about www-subs.

And truly whats the difference of using a subtitle from a subtitle-site compared
to use a translator working for a subtitle-site and call the subtitle their 
own?
