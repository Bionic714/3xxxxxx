,raph700,2007-04-23T08:32Z,"OK, I dunno if this guy is actually releasing wii games, but for all of you that wonder if the wii has been hacked for good, I can tell you it's true! 
I currently live in Tianjin, PRC. I got a european wii I bought 3 month ago in France. Last week, my wife's cousin told me his friend that owns a video game shop has started selling wii games, I was surprised to hear that, because unless you can buy a game for 6-10 kuai a piece, chinese retailer don't sell it. So I went there and the guy modded my wii for 70 kuai (about 7 euros, 10 us bucks I guess), and now I can play game cube and a few wii games that sells for less than a buck. They have a bunch of japanese gamecube games, and a few european and american too, they all play perfectly.
I thought you guys would like to know it works!
