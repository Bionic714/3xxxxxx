,nighthowler,2007-03-18T19:39Z,"really really good music, just 'disco'vered yours and discoswedes fav disco tracks yesterday and downloaded a few of the last ones of yours just to check them out
have to say it once again... really good tracks (at least most of them)
but... to bad none of them are of any use as they sound like cr*p
never ever code in 128 kbps to get some quality... do 192 minimum
and why do they all fade in?
if you have them all on vinyl and wants to do a rerip in better quality a could contribute with a donation just to inspire you do continue but im guessing thats just to much work for you so i have to continue looking
on the bright side... i now have a few new ones to look out for"
