,JAYZEE678,2007-05-03T09:58Z,Hey how do i use this program to burn PS2 DVD's?
[M],Q91,2007-05-04T00:58Z,"if the PS2 image file is iso, then you shouldnt do anything but burn it. But since this is used for ripping and burning MOVIES, I don't think it's a great tool for burning anything but movie images"

,niji,2008-04-06T11:42Z,works perfect
,fturla,2008-04-25T13:25Z,"Downloaded file and comparing to Dvd Decrypter I have from 4 plus years ago. Latest program works fine on 10 yr old dvd movie, works on latest movie just shown in theaters 2 months ago. Note do not check on programs to get latest updates (you will be scammed). Will not work on Blu-ray or HD dvds.
Customized settings are different but only slightly compared to older versions. I recommend program and keep for use for a long time. Use dvd shrink to compress if you want."
[M],Q91,2008-05-19T20:48Z,"I have now tried DVDDecrypter with Windows Vista, with DVD Region+CSS Free.

,Breks,2008-12-18T16:19Z,"Hello! I have a problem. I have a modded PS2 (when I turn it on, a Mod Chip or what screen is on my TV and then it goes to the default menu) and when I insert a disc, a screen on the TV says: Insert a PlayStation or PlayStation 2 disc.

,Mauiwowi,2009-03-03T17:57Z,"I've never ripped a DVD before and I'm a little curious as to how this works.  I was reading up online and found a site saying that I also needed a program called Auto Gordian Knot.  Is DVD Decrypter the only only program that I need?  Or do I need the other one, too?"
[M],Q91,2009-03-26T21:57Z,Auto Gordian Knot (AutoGK) is needed if you want to make your DVD-rip into an avi
[M],Q91,2009-03-26T21:58Z,"but no, what DVD Decrypter does is only ripp the DVD, so when you ripp a DVD, you will end up with (usually) 4.5GB or 8.8GB set of files"

I have tried a few so far, all failures unless I'm doing something wrong: Ultra Video Joiner keeps failing! Not using a DVD, just those pesky TS files. I need HELP tx."
