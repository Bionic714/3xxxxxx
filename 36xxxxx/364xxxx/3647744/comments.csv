,llnk,2007-06-16T19:59Z,THANK YOU! I've been looking for this film for YEARS! I'm really looking forward to watching it. :) :) :)
,victorserge,2007-10-06T16:55Z,"This is an amazing movie - it's shot like a fly-on-the-wall documentary, to emphasize how ordinary people can make history. 

Please seed! I'm seeding at a 4-1 ratio, I know there are folks who've got their 100% since I've started, and yet I'm still the only seeder. I'm going to seed for another few days, but I've got a low bandwidth and need other people to take over.

The Paris Commune tried to smash private property - so does P2P! Leechers drain our collective resources like capital drains the workers of surplus value! So... seed please :-)"

,jjs62,2008-07-25T03:35Z,"hi there,

thanks so much for sharing this--it's a great movie thus far!  (i'm about two hours into it)

i'm worried, though, that the sound and video go out of joint at a certain point--that is to say, that's there's a lag between the two.  is this normal?  do other people have this problem with it?  is it just my computer?  what should i do?

any advice someone could give on this would be greatly appreciated!"
