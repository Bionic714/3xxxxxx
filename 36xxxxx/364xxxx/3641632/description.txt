Sometimes things are just cursed: there where all you need to make a good movie:

A good novel;
Alyssa Milano, Jolele Blalock, Roy Scheider;
proper locations, enough time & money and decent equipment;

but the director failed and the music is simply horrible. Thats a pity, but its not a waste of time to watch it.

Its the uncut version.
