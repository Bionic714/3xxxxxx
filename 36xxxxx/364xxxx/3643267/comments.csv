[T],tmax666,2007-03-20T23:01Z,A very big THANK YOU!  Great material.  If you have any more old music videos like this I would appreciate a seed.
,wankan,2007-03-21T00:33Z,"I don't have many gigs . Most of the stuff I do have  is of dubious A/V quality :-) , certainly not dvd as I think this was .  Would you be interested in a 1972 Genesis concert done for Belgium tv ? 29 minutes , mpg 294mb . The audio is 224kbps 44k (though it's not from a dvd , looks like vcr , but it's interesting) . There's a short sample here : http://www.savefile.com/files/568376 . 
Let me know . "

[T],tmax666,2007-03-22T04:56Z,I'll pass on Genesis but I'm going to try to find the DVD's of the entire set and convert them to post.  Look in a couple of months
