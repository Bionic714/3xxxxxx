Installation Instructions:

Use google as your best reference, and expect to apply a fair amount of trial and error before you get any kind of results.

AIM Remixed v3.0 û unzip, use. Don\'t forget to right click, and use multiple instances of the program at the same time. Works great.

Cero Cloner - unzip, make sure you have proper *.dll files in the same directory and have plenty of screen names to sign on with. *For chatrooms see below.

Toc Cloner v7 - unzip. Use.

PyBoticide v1.50 - install. Use.

Ultimate AIM v2.0 - unzip, use. Used for running aim chatrooms like IRC based.

DeadAIM v4.5 - Install AIM v5.2 first, then install DeadAim, copy *.ocm file to AIM directory and overwrite existing file. Start up aim.

AIM v5.2.3292 - self explanatory.

Unfair Scrmblr v1.0 - Unzip. Play with it you\'ll figure it out.




My reasoning behind sharing these files is that it can possibly offer the opportunity for a large volume of unknown others to come take part in the small and large underground AIM community war whether it is negative or positive way. In a place where everything and anything goes and no one tells you what to do. And for those who remember the dialup days back on AOL in the mid 1990Æs these little tools might bring back a few memories. Welcome back.
