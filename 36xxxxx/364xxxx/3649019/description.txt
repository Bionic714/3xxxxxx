The Million Musician Challenge (MMC) is pleased to announce 

the release of version 0.9.

MMC is a PC game in which you control a number of characters 

at once using a keyboard (either the computer keyboard or a 

music keyboard). Each time you successfully catch the falling 

object, you play a correct note in a tune. In this way, as you 

progress through the levels you learn to play the music. You 

could think of it as Guitar Hero for piano, but using a real 

instrument rather than a simplifed controller.
