Arundhati Roy is an Indian writer who won Booker Prize a few years ago. Ever since then she has become a publicity hungry celebrity who opposes each and every thing positively associated to progress of India. She talks about environment , native people of India, Against bulding big dams (which can satisfy thirst of millions of people) by taking an almost communist approach. 

And by the way she lives in a huge bungalow within a jungle which was built at the cost of cutting many old trees !!!!!!!

She is a fucking whore!!!nothin else!!!"

though I doubt you would understand that"
,prasnto,2008-01-24T13:04Z,"Here is Roy's excellent piece on dams: http://www.narmada.org/gcg/gcg.html

coolcando may want to read it before mindlessly retorting government rhetoric about 'thirst'. 

""When the Tribunal first announced its Award, and the Gujarat Government announced its plan of how it was going to use its share of water, there was no mention of drinking water for villages in Kutch and Saurashtra, the arid areas of Gujarat. When the project ran into political trouble, the Government suddenly discovered the emotive power of Thirst. Suddenly, quenching the thirst of parched throats in Kutch and Saurashtra became the whole point of the Sardar Sarovar Projects. (Never mind that water from two rivers - the Sabarmati and the Mahi, both of which are miles closer to Kutch and Saurashtra than the Narmada, have been dammed and diverted to Ahmedabad, Mehsana and Kheda. Neither Kutch nor Saurashtra has seen a drop of it.) Officially the number of people who will be provided drinking water by the Sardar Sarovar Canal fluctuates from 28 million (1983) to 32.5 million (1989) - nice touch, the decimal point! - to 40 million (1992) and down to 25 million (1993).

The number of villages that would receive drinking water was zero in 1979, 4,719 in the early eighties, 7,234 in 1990 and 8,215 in 1991. When challenged, the Government admitted that these figures for 1991 included 236 uninhabited villages! """
,zeinabqureshi,2008-04-16T22:40Z,"We know Roy right from the time when she wrote (very bad) screenplays for English films in India. Then she hit it big-time with ""Massie Sahib"". It culminated with her big, big prize, which every sane person knows was because of the delightful play on a revered Marxist in Kerala (there are people who still think EMS was born and raised in Kottayam!).
I'm not saying *coolcando* is right. I really don't know. But it is a fact that if the Narmada dam came up, Mrs Roy's 1.5 crore bungalow would be one of the first to sink in the flood. She led the movement against the dam from the front because it was fashionable, and she was the fashion."
