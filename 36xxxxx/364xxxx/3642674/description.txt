NEXUS is a next generation rom synthesizer of highest quality that will make your dreams come true. Forget about the usual bread & butter ROM synthesizers whose sounds are boring, stale and lacking punch.

NEXUS explores new territory and delivers complex, ultra-fat and up-to-date soundstorms that could not sound any better from the most expensive and best hardware - all at the tip of your fingers.

NEXUS provides you with everything you need to create the new hit. Do you need the most powerful dance leadsounds to become famous in your club or a Gregorian choir to create the atmosphere of the next trance hit? Whatever you need, NEXUS will supply you with what you have always been longing for.

Features like the freely programable arpeggiator, the versatile trancegate or the factory-library optimized for the most popular genres make this the best ROM synthesizer on the market.

Even though the sound is first rate, your CPU is spared. You can expand NEXUS with new sounds by installing genre-specific expansion packs or customize the look of the GUI with our themed skins.

Are you ready? You better be.
