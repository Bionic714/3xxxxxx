Overview:	This retelling of legendary swordsman Chu Liu-Hsiang is elevated by novelist Ku Lung's strong story, striking visuals by the vaunted director, but especially a first rate cast led by the majestic Ti Lung. He must hazard treacherous warriors and even a cross-gendered monk to solve the murder of three clan leaders. All that, and the presence of Nora Miao, fresh from her triumphs on Bruce Lee's films, made this a 1977 top-five box office hit and an amazing treat today.
