Seriously, please have a look at this matter, dear Judge6ex..."

,Judge6ex,2007-03-20T21:15Z,I dont know how but for a day or two there was a speed limit at 5kB/s in my comp. That is taken care of but from that I dont seem to have any trouble. Im upploading at 250-300kB/s  24/7
,Judge6ex,2007-03-30T19:12Z,This torrent seems to survive without me. Im deleting the files from my pc and getting ready for the next box.
