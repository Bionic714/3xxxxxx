,d3f3nd3R,2007-03-27T23:10Z,Enjoy !!
,NinjaManiac1515,2007-03-31T18:28Z,"the bitrate is fucking to high...all i wanted was S&M...thats was like fucking 300mb..im not happy..its a great collection...but y 320?

y not just 256..or 192..??"
,FatFreddy247,2007-04-03T00:18Z,"thanks for the 320k files, the highest the mp3 format supports and the closest to CD quality before lossless (FLAC etc)!"
,FatFreddy247,2007-04-03T00:20Z,"No problems choosing the files I want either as I have most of the later albums on CD.

Once downloaded will recode them to VBR 224K to go on the ipod!

Great torrent, Lars will be pi***d!"
,DocJOnes200,2007-04-05T16:47Z,"Sooooo Cool.. Lost all my albums when my pc crashed.. Needed this bro... 

Hail from The Doc"

,FaJu,2007-04-08T19:26Z,"Oh yeah, I def. second that - Lars will be PISSED."
,zockerwadd,2007-04-12T11:25Z,"Snälla seeda!! Står still på 12,9% :(:("
,zolare,2007-04-14T11:30Z,no tree can grow without SEEDS
,dethspunj,2007-04-22T16:42Z,"oh yes lars indeed, lars will be well pi$$ed.

Who cares, lars mate, if your out there. 

Cheers for the free shit man. you rock."
,Djfuckface,2007-04-25T21:21Z,"Thanks!
Og ja, jeg tror også at Lars bliver pretty pissed ;)"
,silo83,2007-05-01T17:26Z,"It´s jitter or something. Irritating when you play it on ""high end"" products."
,Rampage J,2007-05-03T14:30Z,"well done mate, great collection. just wish more ppl would upload at 320kbps. Thanks."
,colml,2007-05-06T01:32Z,thanks!!
,SuperioR12,2007-05-06T11:32Z,it's some kind of jitter on many of the songs... 320kbps did not help here :(
,Krille152,2007-05-06T12:36Z,"I have no idea what u mean with the ""320Kpbs"" part.. all i know is that i've never seen a download this slow before.. stuck at 20-50 kb/s :(("
,Azmodaeus,2007-05-07T04:04Z,"320Kbps = The best sound quality that is reasonably available. Asking for anything lower means that you are too poor to buy anything bigger than a 20g HD, or you're a packrat.
Awesome DL, thanks :)"
,StonerBitch,2007-05-09T03:15Z,Thank you! ;o)

,joke76,2007-05-22T15:32Z,"this is pretty damn cool, I'm sure Lars would approve!  awesome post d3f3nd3R"
,lotus_anima,2007-05-24T20:43Z,"Why 320k? Maybe because some of us like high quality music? Thanks d3f3nd3r. I crap my pants with glee whenever I see a good collection at a high bit rate, which unfortunately is uncommon.

Also, thanks for having the tags done pretty well on your MP3s. This makes it much easier on me.

Perfect torrent."
,kingsimen,2007-05-25T14:13Z,"Anyone listened through the albums yet? Some people mention some ""jitter"" is that true?"
,Mr. Master D. Evil,2007-05-30T20:19Z,"this is not the closest you get lossless... =P But its the closest you get with MP3's ;) BTW... there are a torrent somewhere here on piratebay u can download all of these albums, unless the Live Shit Binge & Purge...
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3635234/Metallica_-_Discography_%5BFLAC%5D
Its not much more than the double disc space... download one and one album and burn on cd... =)"
,cybernet1c,2007-06-01T17:32Z,"The song 'Am I Evil' is missing from Kill 'Em All... and to everyyone who is complaining about the bitrate, stfu and get a bigger hard drive. I 400gb Seagate isn't but about $150. "
,Tflax_91,2007-06-03T18:02Z,i don't get it. why are people complaining about disc space? 2.17 GB is nothing 
,Skurt93,2007-06-04T19:15Z,This is good so STFU
,Mad_troll,2007-06-05T14:01Z,Bitrate has nothing to do with the hard-drive. It's all about DL-Speed. Thanks uploader!
,Mad_troll,2007-06-05T14:09Z,"Correction! Bitrate is a measure of transmission in bits and is not only DL-Speeds, its also all other forms of bit-traffic."
,tommysballs,2007-06-07T12:58Z,sweet.......
,d3f3nd3R,2007-06-23T20:01Z,thx all for the nice words :)

,Geezguy,2007-07-15T13:38Z,Thank you so much. But I would have been satisfied with 192 kbs.
,taskige_tarzan,2007-07-16T20:36Z,"thanx for a perfect torrent :D! d3f3nd3r, you made my day! 

I saw metallica play yesterday.. oboy, they are absolutely amazing live O_O !!"

,piratemath,2007-07-25T11:03Z,I downloaded this just so I could have their music without paying for it. I don't even listen to them. 
,Eirik_FS,2007-07-31T00:18Z,"Is there a big difference between 256Kbps and 320?
I allready have 256, so i dont think it much to gain from downloading this.."
,exodeus,2007-08-18T21:25Z,"Nice upload! 

Just hopes that the tags are in order. 320 is outstanding! 

I'm gonna buy, money permitting, some of the albums simply because theyre cult, you know... put them on the wall soo that they can look pretty. But im gonna listen on these instead :D

Thanks d3f3nd3R!"
,Zangah,2007-08-19T18:47Z,"Absolutely perfect

keep up the good work"
,gilbypoleadamson,2007-08-20T03:44Z,"320Kbps is unnecessary if you use LAME or some other VBR encoder. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3777402/Metallica_Discogrophy_-_L.A.M.E._MP3_VBR
The torrent also include three extra albums and is only 1.5 gigs"
,snuif09,2007-08-20T10:40Z,"sorry metallica i'm just too poor for your cd's
and this just cheap as hell 0,00$ for all youre albums>."
,stinky1,2007-08-21T03:28Z,"I think d3f3nd3R is Lars...
Probably just feeling sorry for getting super rich off all those poor young men.
Thanks Lars!
Lol"
,lahna1,2007-08-21T16:08Z,D3f3nd3r you got what I need!
,pr0m3th3us1,2007-08-23T00:15Z,"Excellent release. I only have one bone to pick at d3f3nd3r.. ""Master of Puppets"" sounds like it was ripped from a cassette - I can hear a constant high pitched digital gurgling sound in the background (the same kind you hear when you go overboard with digital noise reduction/cancelling). I thought it was a bad rip (64 - 96 kbps - then upped to 320), but my suspicions tell me it's from an over-dose of noise reduction. EQ is a little off when I compare it to the original CD, so it has to be recorded directly from a cassette. Bad rip, but the rest seem good.
St. Anger sucks ass, btw. Metallica went queer when they met up with Bob Rock. He brain-washed Lars. Then Lars spent the rest of his days sucking Bobs puny cock."
,coxxen,2007-08-23T18:54Z,seeda plz just 14 kb/s
,pubis,2007-08-30T18:35Z,Thanks so fucking much! U simply have to love 'em!

,projektdeth,2007-11-10T00:46Z,"great torrent....I would pass on the ""Master Of Puppets"" album....try to get that elsewhere...There def. is a ""jitter"" or ""ringing"" of some sort,on all tracks.  Other Than that all other albums are great."

,Commando3k,2007-11-13T17:18Z,"you know what guys... i'm really happy that all this is free.. see i'm not cheap or anything.. just that i feel like an ass for spending money on such a worthless crap as St.Anger....
i swear to god even if metallica paid me money to listen to their St.Anger I wouldn't!
soo thanx d3f3nd3r!"
