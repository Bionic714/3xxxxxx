In a packed program today, Matt Smith reviews yesterday's action from the Championship, including extended highlights of Derby County v Cardiff City at Pride Park. The Rams have been one of the surprises of the season so far, but they face a stern test if they are to gain promotion ahead of the likes of Birmingham City and Sunderland, and three points from this encounter would be a massive boost to Bill Davies's squad. Commentary by Peter Drury and Jon Champion, with reports from Ned Boulting, Gabriel Clarke, Tony Jones, Trevor Harris and Dave Beckett. 
Plus, as always folks, *all* the goals from CC league 1 and 2.

The Brummy Derby takes place today, 11:30 kick off.
