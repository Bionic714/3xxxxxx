,neukdiegeiten,2007-03-26T01:42Z,I of course meant during the parts spoken Spanish or French.
,white_fox,2007-03-26T22:25Z,"title:arnold1965 a sad truth
****************************************
you want to know a sad little fact about arnold1965 
he only uploads these movie so he gets attention because he has no friends in duetchsland he craves the little thx for the upload crap. if you didnt tell him this he would probably kill himself so talk to him and make the poor guy feel wanted also he spams people and takes there 40 dollars with clickbank affiliate programs.
arnold1965 i want my 40 dollars back id rather donate than give it to you, you loser.
arnold1965 please stop spamming tpb just upload the movies and give proper cred to the original release you stole this from and made your own. teafortwo,sisco etc. 
arnold if you need some friends join a sports team or something and get off your lazy ass clicking buttons on your pc and spend some time with real people.
instead of your ""e-friends""

,white_fox,2007-03-26T22:26Z,"stop re-releasing stuff seriously get some friends 
and a job you loser "
,cherrybabe,2007-03-26T22:48Z,"you really have some problems white_fox and just want attention. 

you need help. seriously white_fox. why do you even bother coming to tpb? just to get noticed? oh yeah, you're getting noticed alright and in the most negative way. 

i think people should write to tpb and stop people like you from writing a lot of shit in here. 

you have issues then take it somewhere else because we don't give a shit about your sad life, if you have one.
i see you and your girlfriend jroc261 are teaming up. frankly i think your bothe the same people. try a sex change."
,cherrybabe,2007-03-26T22:59Z,"SERIOUSLY PEOPLE. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO NOTIFY TPB ABOUT THESE 2 white_fox  & jroc261. WE COME TO TPB TO DOWNLOAD MOVIES, MUSIC AND GAMES BUT WHY SHOULD UPLOADERS LIKE ARNOLD1965 BE HASSLED?
NO UPLOADER SHOULD BE HASSLED AT ALL.

PLEASE EVERYBODY - SEND A MESSAGE TO TPB AND HAVE THESE IDIOTS BANNED FROM TPB.

THIS HASSLING/HARRASING HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH AND I'M SURE SICK OF IT.
JUST LET US DOWNLOAD IN PEACE AND THE UPLOADER LEFT ALONE.

THOSE WHO HAVE UPLOADED ARNOLD1965 MOVIES AND HAVE APPRECIATED THEM COULD DO HIM A FAVOUR BY HELP STOPPING THESE IDIOTS."
,wollepyk,2007-04-08T03:53Z,"white_fox is an idiot.
Anyone spending bandwidth on upload deserves thanks (herewith given, arnie).  Anyone needlessly harassing an uploader who supports his torrent as well as the seeder/leecher stats document here must have issues of his own. As if the comment doesn't clue you in on that. I guess jroc_261 has moved on to 262, because his comment has been delete.
Cherrybabe, more power to you.
(I hope the movie is good - downloading it with no pre-expectations but the IMBD rating.)"
,wollepyk,2007-04-08T04:03Z,"Oh, and why would a Finnish guy got to such lengths and (band)widths because he has ""no friends in duetchsland""?? Makes no sense, but why do I look for any in a message from an aryan supremacist anyway?"
,kmarx,2007-04-21T22:13Z,"Arnold, keep on re-releasing stuff! The clowns look so funny when they're pissed. 

Who needs movies, when there's white_fox the funny man? 

May the show go on."

.. Don`t mind the sad people, Treasure them ho gives You again positive. "
,filipeabreu,2008-05-13T00:06Z,"for white-fox:
Are you complaining about the authorship of a torrent?!! Sure, piracy is all about that, or am I mistaken? Oh, I think it's the other way around...

YOU are a LOSER!!!

Get a life, man.

For arnold1965:
By the way arnold1965, this is a great torrent to seed. Tried to download the other versions of this movie and no one is seeding. I am from Brazil, don't talk Finnish very much, but it's never late to learn, right? Keep it up dude!"
,Mongobollen,2008-07-27T11:31Z,Thanks a lot for the upload! Now I'd love if someone would seed.
