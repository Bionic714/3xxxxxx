,the_commenter,2007-04-03T08:18Z,"Notice:
On 4/9/07 I will be deleting all of the .torrent files that are not getting so many hits. I have a computer running full time and its starting to really slow it down! I've just reached over 300GB seeded, I need the bandwidth for something useful, sorry!

,iKing_Hacker_666,2007-04-11T16:35Z,U Haven't Removed It Yet :P
,the_commenter,2007-04-12T04:19Z,"This one is getting at least 13 hits per day... why would I remove it when it is actually being used? I removed 6 other torrents but I'm not going to remove this one. I only remove torrents because I'm seeding 387 of them and it gets a little confusing, and if no one is actually using them I'm not going to keep them for fun."
,Crackz0r,2007-05-01T21:04Z,"Eh, poor seed. 0.6 kB/s at 95%"
,Crackz0r,2007-05-01T21:06Z,"Hmm, doesnt work.
