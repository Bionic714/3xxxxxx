Working with Tubing

This video is filled with fantastic close-up shots, which bring the action into clear view. Ron Covell shows dozens of ways to work with tubing, including bending with heat, bending with both inexpensive and high-end tube bending machines, mitering, flaring, and tapering tubing. There is an extensive section that deals with using U-bends, showing how to create anything from simple water pipes to elaborate headers. Most of the techniques use only simple shop equipment! You?ll love it!
