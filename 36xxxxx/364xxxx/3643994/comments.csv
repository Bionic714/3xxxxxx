,The Illinois Enema Bandit,2007-03-31T15:15Z,Please someone seed this. It has been at 91% for a week. Is original uploader the only seed(at less than 1kb)??? I joined up just to try to get this seeded.
,mediter,2007-04-04T05:09Z,"Hey OP, why are several of these flacs corrupt?  The first three I tried won't play.  Thursday Afternoon, and the No Pussyfooting album are corrupt."
,mediter,2007-04-04T05:35Z,"Funny, Azureus thinks it's 100% complete, but Bit Torrent sees it as 99.0% complete!  I wonder if the seeders are sharing incomplete data as well... OOPS!"

,swollusss,2007-06-25T12:03Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

This is a collection of junk! About one quarter are actual flacs, another quarter are flacs of 8khz or 22khz wavs, another quarter is mp3s, and another quarter is totally corrupt files of indeterminate origin.

This is 4.5 GB of shit. Stay away. There is not even one complete album here."
,CrotchBiscuit,2008-06-11T12:39Z,"Downloaded two albums. One plays, one doesn't. Hit and miss, looks like."

,ArthurDaedrah,2008-12-07T20:55Z,some tracks are junk
,auntiecoagulant,2009-03-16T18:22Z,Why doesn't this person FIX THE FREAKIN' CORRUPT FILES?! After days of downloading it finally finished but lots of the files won't play! How many complaints does it take to fix this? 
[T],fuckthesystem1,2009-05-07T22:37Z,you should've broke this up into a few different torrents
,bwx0,2009-05-25T22:44Z,Wish I'd read the comments before downloading.  Don't waste your time.
