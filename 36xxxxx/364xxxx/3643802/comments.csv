Correct and full torrent with updated docs is

,chikodef,2007-12-04T00:18Z,"Ok, nothing is wrong with this torrent itself. But it has no docs in it. Please download the latest and the last docs for this via ""Microsoft MSDN Library January 2006 for Visual Studio 2003 by ZW"". Look for it or just click on my nick."
,derrekito,2008-01-01T16:52Z,"Ignore Chiko, his torrent has missing files which is essential to install the program.  His Doc disks might work, however."
,mrmaverick,2008-04-08T10:44Z,"This torrent was uploaded for classmates of mine. All I did was grab the install exe off of the disc that was provided by my school. everything installed fine. I didn't include any docs because it was only intended for classmates so we could work on our projects. Sorry for any confusion. To anyone that gets it to install, please enjoy"
