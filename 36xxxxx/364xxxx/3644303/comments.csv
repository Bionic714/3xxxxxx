,oryxgazella,2007-09-26T16:50Z,Downloaded 800+ times and no comments!? Am I the only one having problem to register the software?
,seamlessone,2007-10-04T02:27Z,Thanks for the torrent!  Does this download contain any type of keygen or crack?  Or is it just the 180 day trial license?
,Shnoky,2007-10-08T03:32Z,Ive downloaded this and it works. you need to read the installation procedure and strictly follow it step by step for it to work. if anyone has some questions I'll try to answer it . 
,Shnoky,2007-10-08T03:33Z,Thanks for the uploader been looking for this.
,Shnoky,2007-10-08T03:37Z,seamlessone it doesnt have a keygen more likely a crack. and its not trial. but you need to configure the License manger for it to work. the instructions for configuring it is in the torrent. read it carefully. 
,Shnoky,2007-10-08T03:37Z,oryxgazella tell me what the problem is. 
,ageer,2007-10-08T22:12Z,"i have a problem.
I follow instructions, but when i take a diagnostic in License Manager Tools, it tell me : ""This license can be checked out""...
What is my problem?"
,Shnoky,2007-10-09T05:18Z,"Try to stop the server, click reread and click start server. If it doesnt work. tell me step by step how you configure it from the very start and lets sort it out."
,ageer,2007-10-09T17:23Z,"I have follow instructions step by step. But When i want reread the license it tell me ""Reread Server Failed"". I can reread the license just when i start the server before.
In same, when i reread the license, i can't start the server directly (""Server Start Failed""). I have to stop the server before.
Please, help me!!
(Sorry for my english, I'm french, i hope you understand me).
Thx"
,oryxgazella,2007-10-09T21:55Z,"Hi Shnoky! I suppose my problem starts during 4.	installation of the ArcGIS Desktop. After accepting the license agreement I have to check either ""Browse for a License Manager on the network"" or ""Define the License Manager later (using the Desktop Administrator)"". I chose the latter and started the actual installation (complete version incl the toolboxes). Then when starting the ArcMAP program a license message appears: ""Provide your license server administrator with the following information: Cannot find SERVER hostname in network database..."" Hmm, I´ve looked up the name of my computer and put it in the license file instead of ""host_name"" as instructed."
,Shnoky,2007-10-10T11:51Z,"ageer your english is fine. I cant pinpoint what the problem is. try uninstalling everything and tell me step by step how you installed it and I'll tell you if you did it correctly or not. I'll try to make some comments on each step so that it may help you. I know its gonna be a lot of work writing it. 

now if you said that it fails. check your license the one you edited in first place. check if youve change it correctly. the word ""host_name"" should be change with your computer name. to check right click My computer, properties, then click on the computer name tab. remember to copy only the name and exclude the period after your computer name. most poeple made a mistake on this one. 

if it doesnt work. please tell me step by step how you installed it. you might have missed something. 
"
,Shnoky,2007-10-10T11:57Z,oryxgazella you should have chosen the first option.  tell me how you installed it in the first steps. and I'll tell you where you might have went wrong. it would be wise to uninstall everything. and tell me how you installed it step by step. I know its gonna be a lot of work. I will try to help as much as I can. 
,oryxgazella,2007-10-10T14:45Z,"No problems uninstalling. Glad you take your time supporting. I thought maybe I went wrong in step 2d iv. When adding ESRIFloat.reg I just doubleclicked the file and accepted it to my register when prompted. Anyway, after launching the License Manager Tools (at step 2m) I do not get any  features at all, neither OK or not OK. The diagnostics are just: Diagnostics
--------
FLEXlm diagnostics on (date time) 
--------
License file: C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x\license.lic
--------
"
,Shnoky,2007-10-11T04:53Z,"oryxgazella I think thats alright when you added ESRIFloat.reg. that was correct. 

Okay please take a look at these this is how I installed it step by step with comments. this is written in the instruction on the torrent. I just added some comments. please read it carefully.

License Manger Setup

a.	Create the following directories:
        i. C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x

I think this one is easy. just create these folder.

b.	Copy license.lic to that directory.

Included in the Torrent is a file named license.lic
copy that to the folder you just made. 


c.	Edit the first line of the license.lic file

     i.	SERVER this_host any
     ii.Change this_host to the name of your computer


okay people made mistakes in this part and is one of the reasons for the diagnostics to fail.

after you copied the license file, right click the file, select open with, then choose notepad. now you will see the first line that looks like this.

SERVER this_host any

Now change the word this_host with your computer name. for example my computer name is Shnoky so it would look like this.

SERVER Shnoky any

Then save

d.	Run LMSetup.exe
i.	Choose C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x\license.lic when prompted.

It should be the first option. then browse the license that youve edited. if youve made the above instructions correctly by the time you click next, all licenses for Arcgis will be listed if not then you blew it. continuing is useless. please do it all over again. and read the instructions carefully

    ii.	Do not restart.

This is extremely important!! do not restart. choose restart later. 

   iii.	Copy over ARCGIS.exe to C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x

    iv.	Add ESRIFloat.reg to the registry.

I think this part is easy. copy ARCGIS.exe to the folder youve made earlier. then overwrite when prompted. 

then double click  ESRIFloat.reg then select yes. if it doesnt work go to start, select run, type regedit then file, import, then browse ESRIFloat.reg file.

e.	Restart your computer.

after youve done the above. this is the only time you will restart your computer. 

now after restarting ...

f.	 Launch StartMenu -> ArcGIS -> License Manager 9x -> Run License Manager Tools.

g.	Choose tab Service/License File, and check ""Configuration using Services"", and choose the ArcGIS License Manager.

its the first tab. you wont miss it. just follow the instructions.

h.	 Switch to tab Configure Services, make sure ArcGIS License Manager is in the Service Name listbox.


i.	 Browse to the correct License file path (C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x) where you copied the license.lic file and choose it as license.

this is important browse the license that you edited earlier. the license should be the file named license.lic. when you browsed the folder there will be a lot of licenses inside. find the one youve edited earlier.

j.	Check Start Server at Power up.
k.	 Click Save Service to save the settings.
l.	 Test the server by choosing the Start/Stop/ReRead tab, Click Stop server, then ReRead license file, then Start Server.


alright oryxgazella please dont be dissappointed when it says it fails. I think this license manager that was included in the torrent is a bit old so there is no check box where it says Force shutdown. I have a new version on this and it has a check box to Force it to shutdown but its not in this version of license manager.  when I installed Arcgis I used the one included in the torrent so I know what happens when you use this license manager . It does fail when you click stop server and reread license file. but it should work when you clicked the Start Server. if it fails click it again. if it fails again. restart then Stop server and reread. then Click start server. if it still fails go to the Configure Services tab and uncheck the checkbox Start server at powerup. then restart computer. after restarting. Run license manager. Choose configuration using Services on the first tab Service/License. Then go to Start/Stop/Reread then Click Start Server. If it still fails after y"
,oryxgazella,2007-10-12T20:13Z,"Sorry Shnoky,
I can´t get it to work. I must admit that your guide is very detailed so there should be no misunderstandings. Finding my host name in XP is no problem (Right-click My Computer>Click Properties>Computer Name tab). The instructions up to 2l. does not pose any probems either. But then, as you point out, while testing the server strange things seem to occur. This happens to me at the Start/Stop/ReRead tab: Click Stop server (server stops) > Click ReRead license file (reread failed). The odd thing is that if I click Start Server (server starts) and then directly click ReRead license file the result ""Reread Server License File Completed"" appears after a while (5 sec), but then if I click Start Server the result always is ""Server Start Failed"". "
,Shnoky,2007-10-13T14:53Z,"oryxgazella  I know how you feel about the Stop server and Reread. This has been bugging me since I cant get it to work too. Now try it again stop server then reread file if it fails ignore it! JUST IGNORE IT. click Start Server wait till it says SERVER STARTING. Now dont go to diagnostics. go to SERVER STATUS TAB. Click perform status inquiry. it should Say something like this:

,aaaabbbbcccc,2007-12-28T14:38Z,"Hey all,

I´ve had the same problem and solved it by doing the following:
1. Before you reboot, make sure there the folder c:\flexlm is present.
2. Copy the license.lic to this folder and rename it to license.dat.
3. reboot
4. Open a dos prompt and goto ""C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x"" and launch lmgrd.exe -z
This will start  license service manually which is required to install the mounted iso. Now mount the iso and install, after installation is done everything should work ok.

In Shnoky´s guide, the reg file has an entry that says f:\\flexlm, I changed this to c:\\flexlm. Finally, if you follow my instructions, you dont have to bother using the Licens manager tool.

Good luck!"

maybe its because of the lm version?! i followed the manual step by step 2 or 3 times. would be nice if some1 could help me or send a new version of lm to : kempf0naut@web.de

,birk86,2008-03-14T15:00Z,"Vista users can't use this crack without some modifications. You have to get the new version of LM tools and update lmgrd-exe and lmutil.exe. The problem is that the lmgrd.exe cant start at startup. 
Therefore the problem have nothing to do with the license.lic file but is caused by and old version of these files:
lmgrd.exe
lmutil.exe
lmtools.exe

,gozoman,2008-03-23T15:52Z,"I successfully installed ArcGIS 9.2 on Windows XP SP2! I tried installing a few times. Even the help of Shnoky didn't work for me. Although his help was extensive (thanks for that). I also had problems with the License Manager Tools. I didn't receive the message that everything is ok. I downloaded a newer version via the ESRI forum (thanks for that jck221) but still wasn't the solution. Even after following the procedure very metacuously I didn't get ArcGIS to work. After Googling a bit I found out that there could be a problem with the firewall! When installing ArcGIS itself you have to indicate a license manager or later in the desktop manager. There was no way I could succeed in this. So I shut down the firewall (McAfee) and now I was able to indicate a license manager (the computer name)! And after that ArcGIS 9.2 works perfectly fine, even with the firewall turned on again. So the firewall has to be shut down temporarily only during indicating the license manager in the desktop manager or I guess during the installation of ArcGIS 9.2. I hope this tip works for the people still having troubles!"

c. Edit the first line of the license.lic file

ii.Change this_host to the name of your computer


okay people made mistakes in this part and is one of the reasons for the diagnostics to fail.

after you copied the license file, right click the file, select open with, then choose notepad. now you will see the first line that looks like this.

SERVER this_host any

Now change the word this_host with your computer name. for example my computer name is tommysoft so it would look like this.

SERVER tommysoft any

Then save

tx for the instructions. I am installing on vista and done everything recommended, Sys Diagnosis is OK. 

But when i start ArcGis it says ""cannot find SERVER hostname in the network database. The lookup for the hostname on the SERVER line in the license file failed."" 

what can i do?"
,jipiti,2008-07-04T11:39Z,"Found solution to post above from ESRI site!

Error Message
When attempting to start ArcGIS Desktop or Workstation, the following error may occur:

""Flexlm Error -14: cannot find server hostname in network database. Server name: Not_Set""

Cause
When the product was initially installed, a license manager was not selected or the license manager selection was skipped. The desktop administrator entry was then set to Not_Set to denote that it is not set yet.

Solution or Workaround
Set the Desktop Administrator's 'License Manager' setting to the correct hostname of the license server.

   1. Determine the license manager computer's hostname by navigating to a command prompt by selecting Start > Run, type CMD, press Enter and type in the command HOSTNAME. This returns the hostname of the machine.
   2. Open Desktop Administrator on the client machine by way of Start > Programs > ArcGIS > Desktop Administrator.
   3. Navigate to the License Manager folder in Desktop Administrator.
   4. Click 'Change' and type in the hostname obtained in Step 1.
   5. Click OK to finalize the changes.

1.	Download and install the Sentinal Hardware Key Drivers Update:
http://www.safenet-inc.com/support/tech/sentinel.asp
2.	Create the following directories:
C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x
3.	Copy license.lic to that directory.
4.	Edit the first line of the license.lic file (SERVER this_host any) so that  “this_host” is the hostname of your computer. You can find your hostname by opening a command prompt and typing the command ‘HOSTNAME’ and hitting enter. Because my hostname is ‘skuppyq-PC’, mine would be ‘SERVER skuppyq-PC any’.
5.	Run LMSetup.exe, choose C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x\license.lic when prompted.
6.	DO NOT RESTART
7.	Copy over ARCGIS.exe to C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x
8.	Create a file called ‘flexIm.log’ in C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x
9.	Go to C:\flexIm and copy your modified ‘license.lic’ to this directory as ‘licence.dat’. YOU MUST CHANGE THE EXTENSION FROM ‘.lic’ to ‘.dat’
10.	Download LMUpdate:
http://forums.esri.com/Attachments/27972.zip
11.	Extract the 3 files (lmgrd.exe; lmtools.exe; lmutil.exe) and copy them into your c:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x and overwrite when prompted.
12.	Right click -> edit your ‘ESRIFloat.reg’ and edit the LICENSE_PATH so that it reads: ""LICENSE_PATH""=""C:\flexIm\""
13.	Run ‘ESRIFloat.reg’ and add it to your registry.
14.	Restart.
15.	Launch StartMenu -> ArcGIS -> License Manager 9x -> Run License Manager Tools.
16.	Choose tab Service/License File, and check ""Configuration using Services"", and choose the ArcGIS License Manager.
17.	Switch to tab Configure Services, make sure ArcGIS License Manager is in the Service Name listbox.
18.	 Browse to the correct License file path (C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x) where you copied the ‘license.lic’ file and choose it as license.
19.	Browse to the correct log file path (C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x) where you created ‘flexIm.log’ file and choose it as the log.
20.	Browse to the correct ‘lmgrd.exe’ file path (C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x) where you copied the ‘lmgrd.exe’ file and choose it as the log.
21.	Make sure ‘Start Server at Power Up’ and ‘Use Services’ are checked. 
22.	Restart.
23.	Open License Manager Tools again and this time go to the ‘Start/Stop/Reread’ tab at the top.
24.	Click ‘Stop Server’, then ‘Start Server’, and finally ‘ReRead License File’. If all three processes work, you are ready to mount and install ArcGIS!
25.	Download and install PowerISO if you have not already (http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm).
26.	Right-click the iso and use PowerISO to mount the image and then install. Choose your hostname at the install (it should be the first selection)  when it queries you about the license file.  "

,fantanaman,2011-02-23T19:08Z,"These comments may have been addressed in earlier posts. Some notes for following skuppyq's guide in Win 7 64-bit.

At step 2, be sure to use the directory 'Program Files (x86)', rather than simply 'Program Files'.

Prior to step 4, navigate to 'C:\Program Files (x86)\ESRI\License\' and right-click -> 'Properties' on the folder 'arcgis9x'. On the 'Security' tab, click 'Edit' to alter permissions. Click 'Allow Full Control' for each of the various users. 

At step 8, when you use Notepad to create the .log file, you'll have to 'File->Save as...' and be sure to select 'All Files' in the listbox. Otherwise you'll end up with a text file named flexlm.log, rather than a .log file named flexlm.

Same procedure at step 9.

At step 9, I had to create the directory 'C:\flexlm\'. (Note: here and elsewhere throughout the procedure, I used 'flexlm' rather than 'flexIm', as other posts have pointed out. I think either will work, as long as you are consistent.)

At step 15, be sure to right-click->'Run as administrator', otherwise License Manager won't have permission to configure your services.

At step 24, the 'Stop' button failed to stop the service, but 'Start' and 'Re-Read License' were successful. My install was successful anyway."

1.	Download and install the Sentinal Hardware Key Drivers Update:
http://www.safenet-inc.com/support-downloads/sentinel-drivers/

Click the link on ""Click Here for the latest Sentinel Driver.""  and install it on your pc.

2.	Create the following directories/folder:

4.	Open and edit the first line of the license.lic file (SERVER this_host any) so that â€œthis_hostâ€ is the hostname of your computer. 

You can find your hostname by opening a command prompt (start>run>type cmd and then OK) .... enter and type the command â€˜HOSTNAMEâ€™ and hitting enter. Because my hostname is â€˜paulineâ€™, mine would be â€˜SERVER pauline anyâ€™.

5.	Run LMSetup.exe, choose C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x\license.lic when prompted.

6.	DO NOT RESTART

7.	Copy over ARCGIS.exe to C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x

8.	Create a file called â€˜flexlm.logâ€™ (It's not flexIm.log... it's flexlm.log with a small L) in C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x 

9.	Go to C:\flexlm (or just create a folder named flexlm in C) and copy your modified â€˜license.licâ€™ to this directory as â€˜licence.datâ€™. YOU MUST CHANGE THE EXTENSION FROM â€˜.licâ€™ to â€˜.datâ€™

10.	Download LMUpdate:
http://forums.esri.com/Attachments/27972.zip

11.	Extract the 3 files (lmgrd.exe; lmtools.exe; lmutil.exe) and copy them into your c:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x and overwrite when prompted.

AT THIS POINT, TURN OFF YOUR WINDOWS FIREWALL. Because soon at startup, it will block lmgrd.exe from running. 

12.	Right click -> edit your â€˜ESRIFloat.regâ€™ and edit the LICENSE_PATH so that it reads: ""LICENSE_PATH""=""C:\flexlm\""

13.	Run â€˜ESRIFloat.regâ€™ (double-click) and add it to your registry. 

14.	Restart.

15.	Launch StartMenu -> ArcGIS -> License Manager 9x -> Run License Manager Tools.

16.	Choose tab Service/License File, and check ""Configuration using Services"", and choose the ArcGIS License Manager.

17.	Switch to tab Configure Services, make sure ArcGIS License Manager is in the Service Name listbox.

18.	 Browse to the correct License file path (C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x) where you copied the â€˜license.licâ€™ file and choose it as license.

19.	Browse to the correct log file path (C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x) where you created â€˜flexlm.logâ€™ file and choose it as the log.

20.	Browse to the correct â€˜lmgrd.exeâ€™ file path (C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x) where you copied the â€˜lmgrd.exeâ€™ file and choose it as the log.

21.	Make sure â€˜Start Server at Power Upâ€™ and â€˜Use Servicesâ€™ are checked. 

22.	Restart.

23.	Open License Manager Tools again and this time go to the â€˜Start/Stop/Rereadâ€™ tab at the top.

24.	Check 'Forced Shutdown' and Click â€˜Stop Serverâ€™, then â€˜Start Serverâ€™, and finally â€˜ReRead License Fileâ€™. If all three processes work, you are ready to mount and install ArcGIS!

25.	Download and install PowerISO if you have not already (http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm).

26.	Right-click the iso and use PowerISO to mount the image and then install. Choose your hostname at the install (it should be the first selection) when it queries you about the license file. 

27. During the installation, when it asks for the license file... there should be THREE options! Make sure you choose the first one with your Computer Name/HOSTNAME in it. If you only have two options, then you must be doing something wrong so go back to the steps and repeat anything that you might have missed. 

28. When everything's installed, don't forget to SEED the torrent and take k2_cult for it! :)"
,pauline5765,2011-07-27T10:05Z,"Thank you k2_cult for the wonderful torrent and skuppyq for the specific instructions. After 3 days of my mom's nagging to install this software, I've finally made it work! 

Follow this instructions (modified a bit) : 

1.	Download and install the Sentinal Hardware Key Drivers Update:
http://www.safenet-inc.com/support-downloads/sentinel-drivers/

Click the link on ""Click Here for the latest Sentinel Driver.""  and install it on your pc.

2.	Create the following directories/folder:
C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x

3.	Copy license.lic to that directory.

4.	Open and edit the first line of the license.lic file (SERVER this_host any) so that â€œthis_hostâ€ is the hostname of your computer. 

You can find your hostname by opening a command prompt (start>run>type cmd and then OK) .... enter and type the command â€˜HOSTNAMEâ€™ and hitting enter. Because my hostname is â€˜paulineâ€™, mine would be â€˜SERVER pauline anyâ€™.

5.	Run LMSetup.exe, choose C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x\license.lic when prompted.

6.	DO NOT RESTART

7.	Copy over ARCGIS.exe to C:\Program Files\ESRI\License\arcgis9x

I have followed the instructions as best as I could. 
I was able to get the license manager to work (I think). It let me stop start and reread the license.
However when I install the program it will not let me select my computer it says that it is not a valid license server. 

Is there somewhere I went wrong?
If anyone can help it would be great.

Thank you in advance

Hi!

I've been following your instructions but I still not manage to Reread the licence in  Licence Manager Tools. I have even started over the entire process twice! The only thing that is a bit different is when I create the .log file. I open Notepad, write "".LOG"" (enter) and save it as ""flexlm"". It saves as a .txt but it logs...is this wrong?

Or do you have other suggestions to what my problem might be?

Best Regards

I've gone to safenet-inc and downloaded and installed the updated Sentinal Hardware Key Driver, so I'm not sure what's going on.

I've also tried following Shnoky's (you are awesome!) instructions, but when I go to the Server Status tab and click Perform Status Inquiry, I see this: ""ARCGIS: The desired vendor daemon is down

I can't get this work and none of the three work: start, stop, and reread. I am using Windows 7 64 bit on a fairly new computer. I am suspecting that is why. I followed the directions to the T, and even Fantana man's Windows 7 instructions. I also edited the registry line as Mason said for Windows 7 users. The error message I get is:
