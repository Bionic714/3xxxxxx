,FatFreddy247,2007-03-15T21:04Z,Brad's voice has been the soundtrack of my youth and I'm gutted to realise he has killed himself for whatever reason.  There's talk of him constanly 'giving' and being 'tired' and needing 'peace' so where were his true friends to pull him away from the edge?
,FatFreddy247,2007-03-15T21:15Z,It strikes me that at 55 he might have wanted to slow down a bit but with such a huge talent like his there was always a constant demand for his time and he was too nice to say no
,TOMPICA,2007-03-15T23:27Z,"Thanks adw, i have wanted a live record from Boston since i saw them on the first concert i Europe in hovet stockholm in 79,, so thanks man!!!!"

,FatFreddy247,2007-03-20T16:37Z,This is THE show to download if you want to hear Boston at their peak in CD quality
,larryinindy,2008-01-28T03:22Z,Thanks for the rip. Boston is one of the greatest of all time and Brad was the ulitimate lead singer.
