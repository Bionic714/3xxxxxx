From the readme file:



Here is volume 3 of a collection of video clips relating to 
Erotic Mind Control -- a few of them may contain hardcore sex, but
the vast majority do not.  Most of the clips are from TV or 
perhaps R-rated movies.  

All of the clips are fantasy: you don\'t believe everything you see on
TV, right?

The clips were all found on the internet.  There are no complete 
movies inside.  

The collection contains more nonnude than softcore and more softcore 
than explicit sex.  It is not for everyone: some will find it boring, 
others more of a curiosity. 

The contact sheets preview much less than half of the clips in 
this collection.  Hey, I tried.  

A guide to this fetish can be found here:

Enjoy!
