!!! RAR files... you can't watch them as RAR files... You have to extract them to get the bigger file... RAR's are just little pieces of one larger file probably an AVI file I suspect.  then you should be able to watch it with and media player... if you have problems try downloading VLC player... I haven't run into anything that it won't play and I have used it for a long time tyou can get it at...  http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

I have no idea how to put these movies on DVD... but if you find out let me know

,Texaslambada,2007-03-24T18:45Z,"hey guys.. just download and extract rar-file 01. Then you convert the avifile or whatever with a program called ""convertXtodvd... this program will automaticly burn to DVD after converting using whatever kind of burn- program you`ve got... so, that should be it.."
