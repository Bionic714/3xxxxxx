Since Dolby Digital isn't even one of the choices in the disc's setup menu (PCM or DTS), I'm guessing the DTS audio track was a casualty of the shrinking process... because my receiver isn't picking it up. Please be sure to write your .nfo's accurately in the future, and be 100% clear about what is and isn't included. Had I known this was PCM-only, I would have saved myself a lot of time and just gotten the xvid that's on Demonoid."
