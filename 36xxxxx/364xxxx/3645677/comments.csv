,papa12213,2008-05-14T19:48Z,"amaisng aircraft works in fsx with panel view change to get rid of the black bar, the hud is amaising really realistic if somewhat jerky on slower systems, the manouveability is staggering a truly great plane for the aero ruskie's among us lmao try Pugachev's cobra and stall lmao"
,papa12213,2008-05-14T19:51Z,buy the way ive only ever used this in FSX the kuznetsov doesn't work but the aircraft does amaisingly well with only a minor adjustment in the panel .cfg good luck figering that 1 out guy's!
