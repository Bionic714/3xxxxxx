                                Synopsis                    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Donnie Darko gets along badly with his family, with his teachers and with his
classmates; but he does manage to find a sympathetic friend in Gretchen, who
agrees to date him; and he has a compassionate psychiatrist, who discovers
hypnosis is the means to unlock hidden secrets. His other companion may not be
a true ally. Donnie has a friend named Frank, who is either a large purple bunny,
or man in a large purple bunny costume. Either way, Donnie is the only one who
can see him. When an engine falls off a plane and destroys his room, Donnie is
not there. Both the event, and Donnie's escape, seem to have been caused by
supernatural events. Donnie's mental illness, if such it is, may never allow him
to find out for sure.
