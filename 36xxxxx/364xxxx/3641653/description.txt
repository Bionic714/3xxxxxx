Amazing! How did they do it? A plot which is truly intriguing/original, comedy which is actually funny, martial arts which are amazing, a cast this talented..how? David Chiang really surprised me in this one..his martial arts in this film are astounding..as are Norman Tsui, Phillip Ko?s Lily Li?s, everyone. The story is very original and the performances are great. Its very nice to see a film with a story that has so many twists and turns, great stuff! Eric Tsang did an excellent job directing this, I've definitely gotta check out his other kung fu films. Absolutely astounding kung fu + the charisma of the cast + a great story = a hidden gem!
