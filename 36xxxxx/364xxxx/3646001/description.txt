The original version of the Singing Ringing Tree ran for 73 minutes but we remember it cut into 3 parts, shown shortly before tea time on school nights in the early 1970's. We then think it made an appearance in the 1970s on Saturday morning television. According to the British Film Institute, it was made in in 1957 in East Germany and was show many times in the 60-70s on British TV. The Director was Francesco Stefani.

Although it was originally filmed in German, it had a monologue English voice over when transmitted on British television. This remastered version has the audio track of the English 60s-70s version which was considered for a time to be lost somewhere in the archives.  It also has the original German track, and additional audio tracks in french and spanish.

A lovely old fashioned fairy tale of good triumphing over evil.
