Maximum Rock and Roll Magazine - 

"Yes! This is the good pop punk, the kind that I remember from when the term still related to actual punk and not candy-coated garbage for snowboard jocks. This seven song CD is reminiscent of the great mid-'90s emo-ish, melodic punk bands outta Florida, like the bands No Idea, or maybe a bit of DILLINGER 4. This is not to be confused as retro-something, however, as they still have a modern sound that keeps them relevant in today's scene. These guys look like four wonderful losers who find their escape through playing catchy, melodic punk. Check it out."

If punk is dead, these guys didn't get the memo. Resisting the temptation to jump on the bandwagon, and play todays current popular music, The Decay play a style of punk rock mixing 80s hardcore intensity with a taste of Southern California punk from the 90s. The mix doesn't date their music and adds a rejuvenated representation of the shape of punk today.

Having shared the stage with A Global Threat, The Unseen, The Forgotten Rebels and the Dayglo Abortions the Decay are no strangers to the long and illustrious history of punk rock, but strive to keep it current and avoid redundancy.
