Thanks"
,phishvideos,2007-08-10T10:04Z,Please seed the new Lincoln Nebraska if you can.  Contact me at www.phishvideos.com for lots of master footage that needs to be dumped to DVD.  I don't have the time to do it.

,Raindog420,2007-12-06T20:53Z,"4 or 5 people have finished in the past few days,and there are no seeds. That's lame.  Anyone that is,or will seed we are only 6mb away from finishing,99.9%. I'll seed,when done, along with Vegas 96 for however long it takes for people to get this done. What a Buried Alive!
If the one seed does show back up thanks a bunch..you're a good guy///gal."
