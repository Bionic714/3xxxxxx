The story of the boys going away with a mentor at age 7 is true. The bad part is they become lovers, as in gay lovers. It was that bad, that to select a wife, they had to shave a womens hair off to look like a man, just so they could go from the transition of shagging blokes to shagging women.

How much do you like the Spartans now ?"

,madjock56,2007-03-25T16:52Z,"Well Ive watched it, and loved the fighting scenes. But without saying anymore about the content, the film itself was pretty empty.

What is amazing about it ?  slow-mo fight scenes , well I think The Matrix had that sown up, blood splatter, well that was cool in some other films.

The fact is it makes out that a young kid was thrown into the wilderness to make him tough. The only reason he was so angry, and therefore made them all great killers. Is that he was mentally fucked up from wanking off his mentor after a day with the spear.

They must have all been scared when the Mentor would say, right, lets have some Pork Sword drills today....Not again....

,madjock56,2007-03-25T17:06Z,"lol

Yeah watching endless killing makes you a man, you make yoursself sound clever.

Ive been playing the 300 game on the PSP, its just like the film, wave 1, kill , wave 2, kill , wave 3 kill, chuck in an elephant, then a rhino....die...end.

I got bored of it, and thought it was nothing like the film, then I thought about it again....its exactly like it..."
