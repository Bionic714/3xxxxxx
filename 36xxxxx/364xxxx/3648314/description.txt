Overview:	Chen Sing plays probably the most evil villain I've seen in a kung fu movie and looks like he's having great fun doing it. As Kow Chu he takes his half brother, Kow Li Fan (Corey Yuen), to compete in a kung fu competition for the hand in marriage of the daughter of a powerful official. Although Kow Li Fan wins the competition, he's in love with someone else.

Kow Chu's motives soon become clear; he wants his adopted brother to marry into the family to allow him to grab some of the official's power. After creating a web of lies and deceipt Kow Chu resorts to much dirtier tactics; in fact it appears that he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.

Standing in Chen Sing's way is Angela Mao, of course, and servant boy Tan Tao Liang who secretly holds a candle to the official's daughter. The pair join forces to take on the all powerful villain...
