Description This was something I spent the past week on, and figured I have enough to feature here (over 6 gigs worth). I wish I had everything put ou there, but some of what I could get had to come from weaker sources but I tried my best with it (others would obviously be DVD rips too, but it works for me).

HEALTH-SCIENCE
- DEFENSE AGAINST INVASION (1943, 12 1/2 min.) Presents the importance of immunization of children against infectious diseases. Parallels are drawn between the spread of disease and the spread of a war-time enemy by the means of the animation techniques for which the Disney Studio was so famous. An interesting look into the propaganda techniques of the 1940's.
- COMETS: TIME CAPSULES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM (1981, 11 min.) Some scientists now regard comets as a potential source of information about the birth of the solar system. Combines animation sequences with live-action and documentary footage for an exploration of the role comets play in contemporary scientific research about the solar system's beginnings. Included are discussions on the comets' structure, theories about composition and the fascinating theory that scientists now believe that comets may contain particles of the original cloud from which our solar system condensed over four and a half billion years ago.
- EYES IN OUTER SPACE (1959, 25 min.) Released initially as a featurette to theaters, this show came to the "Disneyland" show three years later. The focus is on the weather. There is a portion devoted to water, and how it changes forms. Then, satellites and weather prediction are covered.
- THE GRAIN THAT BUILT A HEMISPHERE (1942, 10 1/2 min.) A short film on the origins of corn, "The Grain" discusses the Native Americans whose growth of corn spread worldwide.
- HEALTH FOR THE AMERICAS: CLEANLINESS BRINGS HEALTH (1944, 8 1/2 min.) How cleanliness brings health & happiness. The comparison of two rural families to demonstrate the need for proper hygiene and the consequences of its neglect.
- HEALTH FOR THE AMERICAS: PLANNING FOR GOOD EATING (1945, 8 1/2 min.)

- THE STORY OF MENSTRUATION (1946, 10 min.) A basic explanation of the purpose and process of menstruation, told largely with diagrams (and completely avoiding the subject of sex).
- VD ATTACK PLAN (1972, 16 min.) Short animation dealing with the doubts young people have about venereal diseases.
- THE WINGED SCOURGE (1943, 12 1/2 min.) This was a World War II effort by the Disney Studios on behalf of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The thrust of the film was an effort to make people aware of the "winged scourge" of the title, i.e., the mosquito, as the bearer of the plague of malaria, and particularly with reference to Latin America. The seven ways to fight the mosquito were demonstrated by none other than the beloved Seven Dwarfs, each of whom, in his own inimitable way, showed a different method of attack against the winged enemy.
- WINNIE THE POOH DISCOVERS THE SEASONS (1981, 9 1/2 min.) What else, Winnie the Pooh discovers the seasons!

INDUSTRIAL/TRAINING
- THE ABC OF HAND TOOLS (1946, 18 min.) Produced for General Motors. A companion booklet can be obtained here... http://bobsokol.castpost.com/The%20ABCs%20of%20Hand%20Tools.pdf
- FOUR METHODS OF FLUSH RIVETING (1941, 9 1/2 min.) Produced under the technical direction of The Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Disney's Burbank neighbors, this training short utilizes quick, inexpensive animation to teach the skill of flush riveting. Naturally, this is a rather dry instructional video. There is very limited animation, and as Maltin points out in his intro, it was not created to be entertaining. There is, nonetheless, a novelty factor to seeing a Disney project like this.
- STOP THAT TANK! ("BOYS ANTI-TANK RIFLE" ) (1942, 21 1/2 min.) This film, made for Canada, begins with an interesting cartoon showing Hitler (depicted as a ranting madman speaking in phony German) and an armada of tanks trying to invade a peaceful-looking village, only to be fought off by a barrage of gunfire from anti-tank guns, so much so that it sends Hitler to Hell. The rest of this short is a dry and technical explanation and description of the Boys Anti-Tank Rifle.

MUSIC
- ADVENTURES IN MUSIC: MELODY (1953, 10 min.) An owl teaches his class full of birds about melody. It's all around in nature. Only birds and man can sing; man "sings" even when he speaks. We see a quick survey of the stages of life, as captured by songs: the alphabet song for primary school, Here Comes the Bride, The Old Gray Mare, etc. Some inspirations for song are outlined in song: love, sailing, trains, the West, motherhood, etc., but "we never sing about brains." Finally, an example of how a simple melody can be expanded into a symphony: an elaborate version of the simple tune that opened the lesson.
- ADVENTURES IN MUSIC: TOOT WHISTLE PLUNK AND BOOM (1953, 10 min.) This entertaining classic program traces the origin and development of musical instruments and their places in an orchestra.
