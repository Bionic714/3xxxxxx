This will assist people wishing to download the file if they have good reports - but please also post bad ones too (should you have experienced any! Thank you! "
,stoferr,2007-03-28T19:09Z,Is there any danger that macromedia will see that my version of this program is illegal?
,William_J_Wood,2007-03-28T19:32Z,"Only if you allow the app to access the internet. Check your firewall settings and MAKE SURE ""flash"" or ""flash.exe"" is BLOCKED! If you need to contact me, find me email below; contact me and tell me what anti-virus suite your using."
,William_J_Wood,2007-03-28T19:35Z,"Sorry, I forgot to mention it above. NEVER allow to update."
,flayer0,2007-04-08T02:31Z,"Instead of internet firewall it would be nice if someone could supply with an IPadress to the server then simply block that from the hostfile. Would be easier for us who cant live with a software based firewall destroying our internets :)

just a suggestion tho."
,darkriku2000,2007-08-03T22:08Z,"thnx for this, i hope it works"
,chamonecheckcheck,2010-09-23T21:56Z,All I know is.. Every single time I tried installing - it didn't install in the slightest not even one bar in the installation bar.. AND it made my computer turn off... Hmmm... No smoke without fire.
