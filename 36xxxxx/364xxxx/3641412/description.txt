Overview:	When her entire family is killed by the occupying Manchus, Yim Wing Chim (Wong Hang Sau) narrowly escapes to Shaolin temple. Disguised as a man, she persuades the abbot to let her stay and is given the job of fetching water from the well for the students. This 'job' is actually the start of her training, which builds up her strength and, as she frequently has to climb to the bottom of the well, teaches her to work in confined spaces. Wing Chun begins to teach herself kung fu, from secretly watching the abbot, incorporating her own techniques into a new style ideal for close quarter fighting. The other monks soon realize that she is not quite the man she says she is but by that time strong bonds are formed and they are supportive of her mission for revenge against the Manchus, especially as they learn that the Manchus intend to attack Shaolin.
