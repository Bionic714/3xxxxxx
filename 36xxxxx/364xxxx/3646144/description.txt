Before the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, this was the first rock'n'roll hit ever created in England. It launched Cliff Richard's super star career. And it opened some very important doors for every British artist who followed. 

John Lennon himself once said, "I think the first English record that was anywhere near anything was Move It by Cliff Richard, and before that there'd been nothing." 

'Move It' has been selected as one of the "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll" by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.
