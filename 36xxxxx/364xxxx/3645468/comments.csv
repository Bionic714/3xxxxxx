,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-25T09:07Z,"I know this is a necro post from hell but dunno why people upload ps3 games from 4 years ago when the mod for it wasn't even released till 3 years later. There is no fomat converter for ps3 games, even in 2011. HDD's are cheaper than discs anyway if you plan on getting 100+ games."
