,jinmatt,2009-12-21T19:01Z,"Awesome DVD!

but I was disappointed with UNITED. This has only 3 live songs...rest are Phil Dooley's speech and bonus contents "
,qnl,2010-01-11T13:23Z,"The DVD gets a 10 on 10 for the graphics.
Be advised though there are only 3 songs on this.
Do you have links to any other Hillsong DVD torrents?"
