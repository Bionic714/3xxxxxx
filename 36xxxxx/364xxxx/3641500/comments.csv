,Zhylo,2007-03-21T22:57Z,"I recomend either an Nintendo64 controller with an USB (they sell modifyed and orginals w/ USB-connector) or just an Xbox360 controller if you have. It's also an option to buy an regular gaming, USB controller  :P"

Read the Info. Says you need Project64, or you can use Mupen64 or any other n64 emulator, but I perfer the Project64 1.6 :P"
,Zhylo,2007-08-29T17:23Z,"Sorry for the late feedback, but to all of you having tha same problem (not reading the manual/or FAQ on the -64emu), here it is: All Nintendo64 emulators have some plugins options. In the ""Input Plugin"" options, define your controller, and keys. Any other problem should be in the helpfile that comes with the emulator."
,fireboy129,2007-10-27T20:21Z,"for heavens sake ppl... 
READ THE INFO BOX!!! all u have to do is go to www.pj64.net and download the emu!

This is, in my opinion, the best 60 games of N64. So there should be no reason to let people pick out a few. You could always google, if there is just ONE spesific rom you are looking for.."
