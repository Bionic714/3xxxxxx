If you want to play online search for something called stalker_mp0401, works for me :)"
,The.hot.sex.,2007-04-15T22:21Z,"NOT NUKED 

sn3p is working for vitality he is trying to convince people to use their shit version thats buggy as fuck. Use VITALITY if you want your pc to get fucked completely, use HATRED if you actually want the real deal."
,ScurvyBastard,2007-04-29T00:18Z,This update didn't work for me.
,ScurvyBastard,2007-04-29T02:28Z,"It worked, just move the crack exe out of the stalker folder, install the update, then put the crack back.

Also put the original exe in during the updated."
,ScurvyBastard,2007-04-29T02:29Z,from above I meant to say update not updated.

,fallout11,2007-06-11T04:37Z,"This works great, BUT you have to reboot your machine first, before you can play the game.  
If not, you get a black screen and lockup.  Just so you know.

Mount .iso file with Daemon tools or whatever you use. Run the setup. Click ""next"" when it asks for serial (leave it blank).
Run the update file, and copy the contents of the Hatred directory (included) into the .bin directory of the game.
Reboot.
Run game. Enjoy!"
