,mav555,2009-03-16T08:33Z,"The quality is surprisingly very nice- in fact the best for any Hindi movie I have downloaded so far. Of course the movie is a cult classic already. In short this torrent is a gem and should have been kept alive.

However I have been seeding for a long time now and have seen people disappearing immediately after they have downloaded the movie. I am sick of this selfish behavior-Today is my last day of seeding... "

,gr33nday,2012-01-06T08:23Z,"Yes! Excellent torrent of an amazing movie. Anurag and KK both are at their best. It was the movie which gave a break to Indian ocean band too through their song Bandeh. Was looking for something like this. Hope you get laid a lot for uploading this. 
@Dead Game - Its an Hindi movie based on real events. A masterpiece. Try to find subs and you will like it. "
