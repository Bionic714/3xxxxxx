Earth From Above is a stunning portrait of our planet. 
French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand has managed to capture the 
awe, natural wonder and raw spectacle of the world that we inhabit. 
Since his photographic exhibition first opened in Paris, 2000, Earth 
From Above has toured more then thirty countries and been seen by 
over fifty million people.

An ode to the vital reconciliation between Man and Nature, this film 
invites the viewer to reflect on the changes taking place on our 
planet, and the repercussions of these changes on future inhabitants. 
One by one, the stunning images reveal not only the beauty of the 
Earth, but also the impact we ourselves have made on our fragile planet.
