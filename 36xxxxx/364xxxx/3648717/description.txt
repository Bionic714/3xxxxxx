Static-X's blunt-force-trauma melding of industrial rock, thrash metal and futuristic disco is back on the band's fifth studio album, Cannibal. From the carnivorous title track to the throat-punching grooves of "Destroyer," "Goat" and "Electric Pulse," Cannibal boasts the harshest, most stripped-down music Static-X has ever recorded.
