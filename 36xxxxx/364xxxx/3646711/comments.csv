,RivieraDude,2007-04-03T13:29Z,"danespen is actually right lowrider20, there is an error in this upload but it's very easy to fix, just make a copy of the two files VIDEO_TS.IFO and 
VTS_01_0.IFO and the you change the file extension OF THE COPIED FILES to .BUP 
VIDEO_TS.BUP and VTS_01_0.BUP, the same files but with different extensions, after that you can easily burn them as DVD-video in Nero. And also thanks for ul'ing this great movie."

,ray076NL,2008-03-09T20:29Z,"I apreciate your work, but there are errors. you cant brun it correctly with nero.
I cant play it on my dvd-player nor can i on my computer.

But you can play the movie unburned."
,ray076NL,2008-03-09T21:03Z,The solution: brun the VIDEO_TS map as an data-disc. thats it. it should be fine then.
