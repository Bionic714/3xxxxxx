    For almost a decade now, Swedish duo Rickard Bergloef and Robert
    Elster have been pumping out tracks.

    From their Cloud 99 Studios, helping to create the sound what is
    modern progressive dance music. With nearly 100 released
    productions to their name and gigs in all corners of the globe,
    they are without a doubt one of the most sought-after and
    respected trance acts in the world today.

    Their 3rd album Archipelago was one of the seminal releases of
    2006 and firmly established Vibrasphere back on the scene with
    praising words from press / djs and exceptional sales. In the
    fall of 2006, Vibrasphere also made a successful transition to a
    wider audience with their smash hit single 'Floating Free' being
    picked up by superstar djs Armin Van Buuren and Markus Schulz
    for their radio shows which then also fueled an encore interest
    in Archipelago and radio rotation by the 2 aforementioned and
    heaps others followed.

    The result has been Vibrasphere tracks being played by the likes
    of Christofer Lawrence, Markus Schulz, Armin Van Buuren, Menno
    de Jong and John 00 Fleming plus a whole new generation of
    Vibrasphere fans. A row of licenses to both Archipelago and the
    'Floating Free' single include compilations like Armada Trance
    vol 1 (by Armin Van Buuren) and Gatecrasher Live (by Christopher
    Lawrence).
