,formulamac,2007-03-22T16:55Z,This is still a Beta release?  Free download at their website.
,ttly_fkd,2007-03-23T00:40Z,Yes this is the most recent beta release of 3.0.  This is not available at their website.
,BIGstef,2007-03-23T02:55Z,Thanks very much.Much appreciated
,mijam,2007-04-04T20:36Z,I'm new to this.... how do I DL the file?
,JPNMRAK,2007-04-06T12:21Z,I disabled but it keeps crashing. Any ideas?
,CleverStoolAces,2007-04-17T10:43Z,"This is the latest beta release and is intended only for the people who have made donations to the MTR folks. Of coarse, I haven't made any donations and it hasn't stopped me from 'backing up' all of 'my' latest movies.
The latest public release is v2.6.6 and is available at their website for free.

To mijam, you need a bit torrent client like Azureus or BitComet that can open torrent files. A Google or Wikipedia search for either of those, as well as simply searching for bit torrent, should provide you with plenty of information if you have any more questions.

Finally, to JPNMRAK,
I had an idea: Maybe it's not working because it's still in BETA development! As in, the only reason they released it was to have other people help them find bugs. As in that's the entire point. You find a bug, and you win a prize. If you're tired of playing, then I would suggest going to their website and getting the latest *STABLE* version of MTR. On the other hand, if you wish to claim your prize, then all you have to do is help them out a little. Just shoot one of the developers a friendly email describing the problem and be sure to include information about factors such as system specs, OS, and any other programs you have running. Your prize for all of this is an entry into a sweepstakes from which five lucky winners will all have their problems fixed in the next release. I know it sounds like a lot for nothing but it's the least you could do for free loading."

CleverStools, what's up with the animosity?  Apparently daddy wasn't around much when you were growing up, huh?

Point is, I think there was a more civil way of explaining to someone why their beta release keeps crashing.  People who are assholes just to be assholes are highly annoying."
,prog4ever,2007-05-31T13:53Z,"I'm sorry to say this, but the developer doesn't ""deserve"" a contribution. I tried to donate, but the guy is asking for 40 EUR (45 USD!) to let someone to be a part of his ""beta tester team"". And he's very rude, saying he has developed the app for 3 years, so he asks that ammount.
So, I downloaded the app for free! Not here, but this is plenty available at the net.

The asshole deserves we download his app for free. "

,fuckcomcast,2007-10-20T18:18Z,"A comment to prog4ever and others about MTR's ""donation"" system.  It's called a ""donation"" and a ""beta"" because where the author lives it's a crime to sell software that removes copy protection.  IF he said ""I'll sell you a license"" he would be charged.  Tell ya what, if 45USD is too rich for your blood, install Parallels, install Windows XP, and install AnyDVD from Slysoft.  Then you can rip the DVDs with a Windows-based product for .. what... 250 bucks including all licensing fees?

Seriously.. the software is worth shelling out some cash.  Quit being whining twats.

,btour,2009-01-01T18:58Z,"It seems reasonable to ask for a donation, and some people are in a position to be able to do that. But the mechanics of doing so are awkward too. A mandatory amount, when some comments lead one to believe that it is iffy if one even gets a working key is problematic.

Still, There is is no need to berate the author, is there?

I wish someone would put up the version for 10.3.x, and that all would label what OS version is required."
