,jthm,2012-07-10T15:20Z,"Sorry you guys, ignore all comments about this being good quality, it is good VHS at its best. "
,rodza,2012-08-07T22:48Z,"great movie. dl speeds were hitting 1.5mb, took 10mins.

The sound is fine and the film is definitely really watchable,I mean kids wouldnt notice a thing if your getting it for them... but its still an older more original copy of this film. if your expecting a 10/10 sharp, clear, perfect bluray quality like a lot of people on here do.... id suggest just downloading it in bluray format from asianluffys link or another. Watched via MP9 on PC, does not play on Xbox 360. it error codes."
