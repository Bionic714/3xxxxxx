,skyseason,2008-02-15T21:07Z,"and you did this ... why?

considering Sigur R贸s are most certainly an album band, i really don't think this compilation is as good an introduction to the band as a full album would be.

also, most of their songs flow together, and so to present these tunes with broken beginnings and endings isn't a credit.

thank you for the effort."

,cupcakes,2008-10-19T23:01Z,"Thanks a lot. These compilations are very helpful when somebody just wants to see if they might like the band.

Turns out I love it!! I went on to download the albums."
