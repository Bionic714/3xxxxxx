,bhere4u,2007-03-24T21:47Z,Är det någon som vet om det finns någon version av den här filmen där den svenska texten är synkad?
,gist74,2007-03-25T00:56Z,Hehe. You've misspelled the title of this movie.
,bhere4u,2007-03-25T07:43Z,"No I did not!
The right title is ""Impostor"".
Look at Imdb"
,Brainiac7,2007-03-25T13:25Z,"All subs should be in sync, I did at regular copy of the original DVD including the listed subtitles, it's not a custom sub version or something like that."
,Stc-racer,2007-03-25T15:56Z,Tak... Nice upload... ;O
,bhere4u,2007-03-25T19:02Z,"Yes I know.
I rented the this movie some time ago.
It had the same error.
The swedish subtitle comes 10 to 20 seconds after the talk, about 35 minutes into the movie.
The danish and the norwegian subtitle are OK, but difficult to understand.
It's to bad for such a good movie."
