Packaging claims "Recorded live at the L.A. Troubadour, USA May 26, 1973
Bonus Tracks live in USA 1974". But Van list member Scott Evans feels it is more likely that tracks 1 - 9 are from the It's Too Late To Stop Now acetates (with tracks 1, 8 and 9 having been released on the album), and that tracks 11 - 14 were recorded at Montreux in 1974.
