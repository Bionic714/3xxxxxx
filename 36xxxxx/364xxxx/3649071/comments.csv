,ripture,2007-03-28T02:18Z,"You win in my book.  It's ridiculous how many idiots around here just put up some vague name of what the torrent might or might not be and no description whatsoever.

The only thing I would say is, in a case like this, to have titled it something like ""C&C 3 keygen"", so when people search, they will know it is what they are looking for.

Aside from that, though, awesome post."
,Â¤,2007-03-29T11:56Z,pson: Ur torrent is a dupe... Proper tagged scene release is already uploaded.. Search before u upload stuff next time.. 
,pson,2007-03-29T14:43Z,"I know that it´s a ""dupe""
the reason i uploaded this was because i tried to download the other one for 2 days without success."

,LebeL69,2007-04-19T20:04Z,Just change .001 to .rar in the filename and then extract files. Enjoy! ;)
