Kelly's Heros brilliantly mixes your average war movie with a bank robbery movie to come up with a plot that's entirely unique. Equipped with an all-star cast (the likes of which we'll probably never see again), Clint Eastwood and Telly Savalas play the straight guys to the comic antics of Donald Sutherland and Don Rickles. The movie makes no moral judgements about bad guys and good guys and simply shows the characters of both sides a path to redemption in the midst of war. In addition, the theme song, "Burning Bridges" is rendered with a youthful tone by the Mike Curb Congregation, which reminds us that in reality, people not much removed from childhood are the ones sent into battle. We cheer when they get their just rewards.
