Not quite as enjoyable as "Odd Couple", but a definite must for martial arts fans nonetheless. Amazing action from Sammo and Lau Kar Wing during the golden age of martial arts cinema.

  3.8 / 5 (based on 6 ratings). What did you think of it?

Plot:	Very similar to the excellent "Odd Couple", "Dirty Tiger, Crazy Frog" features the exact same cast, crew, and atmosphere. A funny martial arts piece with some killer physical action.

Overview:	A very humorous film about Crazy Frog (Sammo Hung) who has run away from his wife and is out about the town gambling. Meanwhile, Multi-Hand Chick (Meg Lam Kin-Ming) pickpockets someone and gets Crazy Frog to protect her. She lures him into her house, whereupon she steals his prized possession, his Invincible Armor. Crazy Frog's very ugly wife enlists Dirty Tiger (Lau Kar-Wing) to bring him back home. Upon meeting Crazy Frog, Dirty Tiger decides to help Crazy Frog get back his Invincible Armor. The two team up and go through many obstacles to try and get back the Invincible Armor.

A funny movie, with lots of acrobatic kung-fu by both Sammo and Kar-Wing. This film was made when Sammo was in peak physical shape.
