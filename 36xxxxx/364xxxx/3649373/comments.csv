[V],Kuthumi,2007-03-28T15:41Z,What about subs? There hasn't been a Nordic utload for this title.
[V],Kuthumi,2007-03-28T15:46Z,"The torrent DOES work, except that the seeder is missing right now."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-04-19T08:07Z,It is an English-Chinese version which is OK if you don't need the Nordic subtitles.
,SailTrimmer62,2010-03-13T18:40Z,There *is* a defect in the recording; it skips most of the first wedding ceremony after Charlie discovers he's forgotten the rings. Otherwise a good copy. Perhaps it could be redone?
