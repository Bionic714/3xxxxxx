,tony4505,2007-12-14T08:46Z,"Whats damn hard about seeding?  I burn up enough electricity running my machine to at least show my support and appreciation to seed a torrent for a time after I download a file.  This one shows 12 seeders, yet its moving at a snails pace?  Thanks to those who have provided the torrents!!"
