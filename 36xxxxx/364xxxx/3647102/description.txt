ßßßßßßßßßßßß


   1.) Copy stalker_mp.exe to your S.T.A.L.K.E.R dir.

   2.) Server start or join to a server:

       First of all, you can start a  server  and  join  it  to  play  at  the  same  time,
       but  if  you start dedicated server, you  never can  join to  that from the same pc.

       You can join to  all dedicated server,  what  started  with  command  line  options,
       but  the  server started  from  ingame  Network  option  you  can't.

       - LAN Servers
       - Dedicated Servers (only real dedicated standalone servers)
       - Private Servers what created with this tool

 OK last and the best method against invaild key: go to your registry and find STALKER-SHOC
 You find a key called InstallCDKEY there. Modify data to something, not need a valid cdkey
 or something like that just enter something like this: 335dGFdgt433r5t3.

 If have the problem, but I think nobody get a key like this, change it to an other!
