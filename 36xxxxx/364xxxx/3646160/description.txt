Day for Night is the fifth full-length album by the Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. It was released in 1994.

Overall, Day for Night is more mellow and acoustic than the band's previous albums, but retains the dark and pessimistic flavour of Fully Completely. There are several hard rock songs included, such as "Nautical Disaster," "So Hard Done By" and "Inevitability of Death". It was the band's most successful album commercially and critically, proving their progressive improvement lyrically and musically from each release since Up to Here. Day for Night contained the largest number of released singles for a Hip album ? "Grace, Too", "Greasy Jungle", "Nautical Disaster", "Thugs" and "Scared" were all successful chart hits.

"Day for Night" is a cinematic term, meaning a method of photography using filters to make a scene shot during the day appear to have been shot at night. It is also the title of a Fran√ßois Truffaut film.

The album was produced by Mark Howard, Mark Vreeken and The Tragically Hip.

The band also appeared on Saturday Night Live in 1995, performing "Grace, Too" and "Nautical Disaster" in an episode hosted by fellow Canadian and fan Dan Aykroyd, in order to promote the album.

All songs were written by The Tragically Hip.
