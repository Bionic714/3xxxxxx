,superleech,2008-12-08T06:42Z,Notable prequel is Sukiyaki Western Django(2007)
,OhMyGaper,2009-03-13T09:54Z,Sukiyaki Western Django is not a prequel in any way shape or form. It is a beautifully photographed pastiche.
,OhMyGaper,2009-03-13T10:04Z,I fucked up. Sukiyaki Western Django is a prequel. It's also a damn good movie. But enough bullshit. Download this movie. The original Django is required viewing for anyone into Spaghetti's or other psychotronic genres.

,wriggle_nightbug,2011-03-16T21:26Z,"Great movie. Great upload.

Sukiyaki Western Django is definitely not a prequel to this though. I wouldn't even say it's even loosely based on it. It's more like Takashi Miike's japanese tribute to the spaghetti western. Storywise Sukiyaki has a lot more in common with A Fistfull of Dollars/Yojimbo than Django. A great movie in it's own right but it doesn't borrow a lot from Django besides the name."
