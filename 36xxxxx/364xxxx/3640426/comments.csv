,BlackholeForever,2008-01-30T01:52Z,"Yes, looks good...but what use are subtitles if all they provide is the .SUB file and no .IDX???"
,BlackholeForever,2008-01-30T03:09Z,"Ok, I found another 2CD release and adapted it for this release (a cut here, a stitch there, a few timeshifts, etc).  It's ENGLISH.  Get it at subscene here: http://subscene.com/leon--the-professional-directors-cut/subtitles-5457.aspx

I'll put it on opensubtitles too..."
