HKFlix Says:  	4 Stars
Despite the misleading comical artwork on the Hong Kong DVD, it's actually a surprisingly good martial arts flick. Great fight scenes are peppered throughout this first-rate Wong Fei Hung episode.

Plot:	Semi-spoof of the Once Upon a Time in China series concerns Wong Fei Hung's attempt to stop female slave traders while putting up with his misfit students.

Overview:	Jet Li reprises his role as Martial Arts Master Wong Fei Hung in this unofficial sequel (and parody) to the Once Upon A Time In China series. In this film, Wong needs a bigger school for his students. At first, good fortune seems to come his way when he finds a larger building for a lower price. However, this rapidly changes when he finds out that his next door neighbor is actually a brothel. Besides this, Wong has to deal with a group of perverted monks who are kidnapping girls to sell into slavery. They're in cahoots with the new chief of police (so to speak), a maniacal loon who is really fronting for the boxer rebellion. On top of all of that, foreigners are selling bogus medicine that causes hearing loss to Chinese children, and a father and daughter kung fu team are searching for their lost daughter/sister.
