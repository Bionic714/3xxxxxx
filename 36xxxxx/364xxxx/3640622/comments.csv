,speeder,2007-03-17T21:56Z,it complaines about the licence
,speeder,2007-03-17T22:00Z,SORRY - MY FAULT. The Application is working fine. I just executed the photoshop.exe instead of the Twain_32.exe
,bedata,2007-03-18T07:31Z,Warning! Don't try this if you already have the CS3 beta installed. On exit it clears away a lot of registry entries and afterwords CS3 beta wont run. And you can neiter uninstall or reinstall the beta because the CS3 installer is buggy.
,bedata,2007-03-18T13:14Z,"About the CS3 beta installer, read this:
