Is there any hope of the intel build being shared?
I had this long ago and ... no more....."
,turbo24prg,2007-03-28T06:18Z,Go and get yourself a nice RISC box. x86 sucks ;)
,mutilator,2007-03-30T06:25Z,"I'm stuck at 62%, please seed. I'd love to try this."
,macygasp,2007-04-06T18:50Z,can anybody confirm this is working? the contents doesn't look like a valid iso image .... :(
,adcurtin,2007-05-23T08:19Z,"This better work, I have 4 SPARCstations screaming for this."
,Sandokan2007,2007-06-16T02:28Z,"An interesting bit of info from the web about the SS20: 

""An interesting option is NeXTSTEP or OPENSTEP. Both are significantly picky about hardware: only the SuperSPARC CPU modules work, and only one of these. Also, NS/OS only support the BW2, CG6 and SX graphics options - but the SX works very well indeed."" 

So, if you're having problems, now you know why! Oh, well! I guess I'll have to use the SS5, if I could download this OS .... pleeeezzzzz. Only 70.12% to go!"
,wired57,2007-07-26T19:42Z,"could someone please reseed, I've been stuck at 63.2% for a few days now. Thanks"
,VeKTeReX,2008-10-25T06:59Z,I'm seeding this one for the foreseable future.  Great OS and great hardware (i'd still love to grab a Cube though). 
,tarma_2002,2008-11-11T14:43Z,"It's great that people are still sharing this :)

Just wanted to say that for the SPARC arch, NS3.3 only runs on Sun4c machines, ie. pre-Ultrasparc -  so don't bother if you have an Ultra{5,10,60}!!"
,sdlabs,2010-01-25T14:12Z,"Got a HP9000 series700/120, now all I need is an ext SCSI cd-ROM and we're go!"
,wetmouse,2010-03-13T10:34Z,"NeXT had trouble getting their OS to run on their own hardware, but they really had trouble getting it to work on the wide variety of Sun SPARC and HP PA-RISC machines! Guess how much more trouble they had getting it to work on several hundred thousand variations of PCs (with different BIOS, network cards, hard drive controllers, etc.). Yes, NeXTStep was a complete commercial failure. But it was pretty (not as pretty as IRIX, but pretty). Thanks for this - I'll be getting the X86 version running on VMWare for old time's sake!"
