                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the early weeks of the war in Iraq, U.S. military officials believed 
victory would come quickly and few soldiers would be lost. But over the past 
four years, thousands of U.S. soldiers have been killed and many more thousands 
have returned home physically and psychologically wounded. In The Ground Truth, 
filmmaker Patricia Foulkrod delivers a searing look at how U.S. soldiers 
struggle to come to terms with their experience upon returning home.

Instead of the glamorized pictures of happy reunions after the victors emerge 
from the trenches, viewers see the all too common repercussions: illness, 
amputation and injury, depression and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD)-
of which Iraq has become a fertile breeding ground. The filmmaker's subjects 
are patriotic young Americans, ordinary men and women who heeded the call for 
military service in Iraq. They've experienced recruitment and training and 
combat, however, the conflict in Iraq is a prelude for the even more 
challenging battles fought by the soldiers as they return home and struggle to 
come to terms with their personal demons, an uncomprehending public and what 
many feel is an indifferent government.

Foulkrod's graphic footage and still photographs of the ground conflict in 
Iraq will forever shatter for viewers the sanitized images found on the 
nightly news.
