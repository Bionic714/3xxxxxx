Description: Suffering from economic hardships that slowly rip apart their once harmonious relationship, a married couple (Judit Pogany and Robert Koltai) struggle to keep everything together -- yet the husband becomes increasingly passive and the wife increasingly strident as time goes by. Their difficulties are created and portrayed by the spontaneous reactions of the actors themselves, following outlines of the story rather than the memorized lines of a scripted scenario. With minimal editing and direct sound that includes the noise of the camera, the black-and-white realism is rather bleak, reflecting the current state of their once caring relationship. -- Eleanor Mannikka
