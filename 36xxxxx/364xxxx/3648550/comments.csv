,kanji101,2009-02-26T19:00Z,"Thanks for the upload watched them all in 2 days!!!
the episodes list is incorrect because the eps 18 to 22 seem to happen before ep 15 because :
1- fonzies adopted son wasnt in the eps after 17
2- joanie and Chachi werent together/married after ep 17  in ep 18 - 22 in the storyline it said they still are broken up but from girlfriend/boyfriend not married
3- ep 22 fonzie said could you lower the rent when fonzie moved out in ep 15 and ep 18 they argued during poker about the rent and other things.
4- plus if there was no richie in the last ep
it would seem wierd even just a guest in a ep
which made me think passages was the final ep
5- ep 22 didn't fell like an final ep i thought ep 16-17 was the final because of the wedding

can you somebody tell me the correct order of the eps in storyline order maybe on tv was different order
just the storyline line events didn't seem right 18-22 im 100% sure theyre before ep 16-17"
,TheCyber,2009-03-15T17:43Z,"Please, mtradeboard, U/L the other seasons U have. THANX!!!"
