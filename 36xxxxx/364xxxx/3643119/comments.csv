,jycracks,2008-06-08T04:57Z,"I watched this movie on a dare, which should have said volumes about the quality of the product in itself. Filmmed with what appears to be 3 different cameras ranging from VHS to mini DV the film spiraled all over the place with the typical undertones of the urban hood element sprinkled throughout. What I got in this film was poor performance after poor performance and camera-work that was far from acceptable. But surprisingly there were some performances that were watchable. One is the lead lady Chrenia Black, who plays Carmen. She did a good job in a terrible film. And the same can be said for the actor Christopher Anderson who played the lead Jarez Green. But at the end of the day, this was still an undeniably bad film. Who knows what this film was about but I can say this, if the filmmakers really spent $85,000 on this film, they spent $84,999 too much!
