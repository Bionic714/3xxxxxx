Homophobia is actually, hidden homo-sexuallity. But i can see that you allready know that,FAG. Was your dady a pedo?That will explain a lot.
And I as I see,you are really educated too!
You suggest others to learn history from a movie!?!Do you even know where Greece or Persia is?
I bet your knowledge and your ethics (it is a greek word mf...that you should have learned) is based uppon TV series and reallity shows.
Read history from books you ignorent fuck.Not from comics, novels or movies.
I am Greek.I have nothing against Persians. I respect their long and great history.Their culture and civilisation. All of us do.
The ""300 movie"" is based on a comic book. Learn history. Even from fucking internet! Afterwards, you will really know what happened.Great armies and men fought there.From both sides. And ,they fought for many years after. And if you still have balls come and visit the Hot Gates. 
""Thermopylles"" we call it in greek.And then ""Plataies"".

Unless you think there is no war  as we speak.
It was just a couple of rounds...And capital is winning....

Still history will be written after many years. We may live to tell.We may not...
And don't patrinise me...I read a lot of books reffering any subject , not just one.

Oh and one other thing. Alexander was Macedonian BUT, The country that has the add of Macedonia in its name (Former.Yugoslavian .Republic.Of.Macedonia. is the correct name of that country) refers to the geografical entity of that coyntry. Nothing more. 20 years ago was called Scopjia. They are Slavians, Albanians...etc...Fine by me...and no worries about that or them.
It is a country created from the old United Yugoslavia during the Cold War period.
STILL Alexander was NOT either Slavian or Albanian or whatever the fuck they wonna say he was.
HE WAS GREEK. Just in a period of time that Greek tribes where not united under one religion, flag etc..
Just like Indians. The TRUE AMERICANS....if you know what I'm saying...

DISssy, Macedonian's are Greek, so are Spartans and Thesbians, they are all greek and you make yourself out to be the fucking retard by that comment. It's like me saying I'm a Missourian, not a fucking American, WTF dude are you that ignorant...... Also the PErsians burnt Greece to the ground before the majority of the army left because of a loss of naval supply lines (couldnt feed the troops), the Greeks finnanly pushed out the Persians but not before the Persians ensured the greeks would have dark hair and dark eyes for the rest of eternity. The 300 sucked, was a shitty movie and is very inaccurate, for one thing 700 thesbians stayed with the Spartans and there where more then likley exagerations because historical facts on the battle are almost all one sided and written by the acient greeks. Also, once again Macedonians are greek and spoke a dilect of greek, and DISssy is the actual retard who doesn't know anything

,DISssy,2007-03-23T12:09Z,"Nicholsml:

Macedonians were no Greeks. The fact that the region they come from is part of todays Greece, doesn't make them part of historic Greeks. Just because Hawaii belongs to the US nowadays, it doesn't mean the Hawaians had the same culture as the Missourians a few thousand years ago. But considering the fact that you are American and most likely went to an american School, I have to give you props for actually being able to read a map of Europe. Where did you learn such extraordinary skills?

Unlike the Athens, Thebes or Sparta, Macedonia was not a polis, it was a agricultar-based region. Especially they didn't have many of the cultural achievements that are considered characteristic to the Greeks and that created the Image we have of ancient Greece, wo which the Homophobe was referring.
I hope this clarifies my post, but if you want to, you can go on claiming the Makedonians were Greeks, genetically this is considered possible, but not proven, as far as I know. Culturally and historically it's wrong, but I guess for American standards you're allready doing great by not thinking Alexander was Roman."

,gechristou007@yahoo.com,2007-03-23T14:58Z,"I will say it once more and that's it.
The movie is based on a comic.
Not historical events.
It is a little boy's imagination on a piece of paper over an historical event.
Nothing more.
That explains the contrast of the monster like figures of the Persians and Ephialtes ,and the contrast with the Spartan army (bad is ugly, good looks nice).
Maybe, Americans want to use the movie for their purposes.
Well, don't blame either Greeks or our history for that.
It's well known (and learn it if you don't) that we dislike the US goverment as well as NATO and their pilicies against free-willing nations and cultures. Unfortunatelly there is not much that we can do.
Most common Greeks (men and women, young people as well as our elders)protest in every given ocassion for the mess that they have created all over the world. 
We have a small country, with small economy, but we are disent and stand to those who just want to be free. 
I saw the movie and spoke to many friends and collieegs. It is a large topic and we discas over it again and again with scepticism. For us it is just an oportunity to learn more about our history.As well as others. 
We do not like the Rambo-look soldiers or what they represent. 
Still, freedom is a reason to die for.History over centuries speaks for ourselves. Not that we haven't made mistakes. But we where there most of the times defending common ideas like justice and freedom. 
I think, almost everyone agrees with me on that. For us it is just a comic-based movie.
Don't let them, or any movie ful ya.
None of us did.
Honnestly."

,Callistox87,2007-03-23T15:50Z,"300 is based on a true event. The movie was bent to entertainment and fun rather than historical accuracy. I heard there was also a comic? 

However this happened in real life too. Although it was a little bit different.

Anyway, the Persian Empire was forced to leave Greece for some reason.

Greece became unified. In the time of the movie there were seperate states, warring with each other and stuff. 

Greece, once unified, went on to conquor the _HUGE_ Persian Empire. 

Alexander the Great conquoered the entire known world.

But... the Persian army wasn't trained very well :P

,x4br3,2007-03-24T08:01Z,"aight guys, i got my sound fixed. for those of you getting static or crackling noises. just go and download VLC media player. when i used this to play back 300, no static, no crackling, perfect audio. VLC MEDIA PLAYER IS MI HERO!!"
,sk_few,2007-03-24T09:35Z,"My files weren't corrupted. kinda wierd.

Regarding the quality. Its not bad at all. I use windows media player and put a little bit diskant on and its all good. VLC on the hand gave too much diskant, and Im not too familiar with that program tbh.

Video 9/10
Audio 8/10

Absolutely great movie. If you like Gladiator, Braveheart, Sin City and such. then this is a great movie for you.

Thanks alot Kollll"

Xerxes I

Xe´rxes I (grek. Xe´rx\s, hebr. AMashwerosh, fornpers. Khshay[rshan), persisk storkonung av den akemenidiska dynastin 486-465 f.Kr., son till Dareios I. Efter att ha kuvat revolter i Egypten och Babylonien återupptog X. faderns ansträngningar att erövra Grekland. Han lyckades också efter att 480 f.Kr. ha förintat den grekiska försvarsstyrkan vid Thermopyle inta Athen, men efter flottans nederlag vid Salamis samma år drog han sig tillbaka till Mindre Asien. Året därpå besegrades hans kvarlämnade armé vid Plataiai och flottan igen vid Mykale. Trots att han alltså inte lyckades besegra grekerna militärt skaffade sig X. fortsättningsvis stort inflytande i Grekland genom att bedriva en generös och väl avvägd subsidiepolitik. Inrikespolitiskt befäste han den kejserliga härskartraditionen, och under hans regering utvecklades en stor byggnadsaktivitet och ett luxuöst hovceremoniel (jfr Persepolis). X. föll offer för en palatsrevolution och efterträddes av sonen Artaxerxes I"

don't know why you're having problems but try converting the audio to a cbr mp3 first.
The way I would do it is open the file with ""Goldwave 4.26"" (audio editor) & save the audio as a mp3. 
Then using ""VirtualDubMod 1.14.13"", open the video file, select ""AVI/Audio/CBR MP3 Audio"" & browse to your new cbr mp3, Select ""Video/Direct Stream Copy"", Select ""AVI, Save as AVI"" & save
Then try what you did before.
Other versions of the software mentioned may work, but make sure you use a modded version of Virtual Dub.
If you want me to make a torrent of the software mentioned just let me know."

you'll need to download & install ""winrar"" to extract it (plenty of copies available on TPB)"

,gcelis,2007-04-01T14:20Z,"i know this is a really stupid question, but im new to torrents
how do i seed once i download?"
,jimbob22,2007-04-03T04:11Z,sound is crap - not watchable. for those with an EQ on your hi-fi you may be able to salvage - otherwise try the re-encoded version. (video is flawless though) c'est la vie
,magnus_24,2007-04-03T12:34Z,This is by far the best copy out there!!!!exellent!!my score is 10/10
,Kennan90,2007-04-04T23:55Z,seeders please!
,Kennan90,2007-04-05T00:03Z,"Noticed that many question the propability of this movie. But have in mind that these spartans where trained from 7 to 30 years age. 

These spartans where low populated, but they had such military dicipline the world never seen, only the strong looking babies would live when a woman gave birth. 

They even encouraged the men to have sexual intercourse just for the bounding so they would trust eachother in a fight.

If you still don't think they would kill so many, just visualize U.S navy seals for example vs. some 16 year old brats, guess who would kill who."
,WindeGuy,2007-04-05T02:27Z,"Here's a little hint.

I downloaded this movie and I watched it before it ever reached the cinema in my country. Even though, when I was done I was left with this feeling: A movie that great HAS to be seen in the cinema - therefore I'm actually going to the cinema to watch it with some friends.

I'd suggest you people do the same, there's no need to download it until you have seen it in the cinema. So unbelievable fucking great!

I think you need a new AC3 codec =)


Picture 10 out of 10!
Sound 9 out of 10 when the music is along with the picture sometimes, it sounds a little bit crackling. But nothing you take notice of =) Just me being a little.. :P"

,shom,2007-04-17T15:52Z,"okok,   OMG , thank u seeders , thanks a lot , for giving me an average speed of 10 KBPS , completed in 3 days 

Such a coool movie 
here's my rating

VIDEO  : 9.78/10
SOUND : 9.53/10

for all of u who have problems on sound and video...
here is a trick . ---- start the movie with VLC player and mute the voice as sound is not good in VLC (u shud have all the codecs listed on page 7 of the comments on this torrents)
as VLC doesnt give a good sound .. 
start Windowns Media Player , simulteneously
to match the video frm VLC and sound frm WMP


and u'll have awesome quality , AWESOME ...
thx seeders , now ill seed at 20 KBPS , ."
,shom,2007-04-17T15:53Z,i think the codec list is PAGE 6 ...
,shom,2007-04-17T15:53Z,I THINK THE CODEC LIST IS on page 6
,rustedearth,2007-07-02T01:04Z,everytime I burn to a DVD there is no sound. I have converted to mpg with toast and popcorn and vlc and still no help. anyone know how to fix this?
,reking,2007-07-08T03:58Z,"Bullshit! Sound is fucked up like I've seen maybe 4 or 5 times before, in other torrents. Why the hell can't someone make a decent rip themselves, instead of copying the one with fucked sound"
