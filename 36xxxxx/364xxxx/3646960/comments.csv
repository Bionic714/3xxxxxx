,jester45,2007-03-28T05:21Z,could you just advance the system clock to check?
,jester45,2007-03-28T12:59Z,I change the system time to 1 year ahead and it works but im not sure what way diskeeper counts days by
,MagnumOne,2007-04-07T10:42Z,I've had diskeeper 2007 installed previously and this version prompts for activation the first time you open Diskeeper so it's pretty obvious that it's a non-functional relase.
,DeSudet,2007-04-12T00:45Z,"According to diskeeper.com's site, it supports x86 AND x64 windows.  Wasn't looking for Vista, so I can't say either way."
,streetho,2007-04-30T05:26Z,"when you install--remove all older versions of diskeeper, go to the old folder and delete where old diskeeper was. you are ask after install different things about registering with the option to never register.if you chose that one, the program will work for  as long as i have used it [almost a year now.] it just never updatesto newer versions but who cares? works fine for me."
,fallout11,2007-05-09T23:22Z,"Yep, seems to work okay, after removing everything, rebooting, and installing (following the instructions)."
,Surfdragon,2007-07-05T22:55Z,"hi guys... 
I did it right somehow... 
I set my systemclock to 2048 before installing, did the entire install, finished it, then reset the clock to 2007. after that I got the choice to register or never register, I chose never register. Now Diskeeper says the program is fully registered...  there is no mention of any kind that this is a trial or will expire at any time..
