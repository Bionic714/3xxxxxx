error: insert original CD into drive E:

wtf!?!"
,azidtrip,2007-04-03T03:44Z,"Apollo Tloc:

I donno whats wrong in your end, but I used exactly same files and play with latets patch and that very crack. Simply use deamon to mount the image, install, then install patch, last replace the exe in gamefolder with exe in SP crack F.E.A.R.V1.08.ENG.MACIOZO.NOCD.ZIP.

Simple as that. :O"
,Tinface,2007-04-09T11:23Z,(Sniff) THATS RIGHT IM CRYING!!! This works (Well the install works) I am installing it and I hope that this scary shit works. I am on the first installation (Not the patch) And do not know if it is working or not. Will comment again...

Searching the net, it seems to be a common problem (ofcourse). Fucking Game Dicks need to get theyre shit straight and stop experimenting. First PixShd 2.0.....everyone goes and buys new cards.....4 mo later PixShd 3.0.....now your card is worthless....so everyone buys new cards.....4 mo later PixShd 4.0.....again your cards are worthless....Im quite suprised some kid hasnt had a breakdown yet and walked into an EA or Sierra building with an AK and just started poping heads. These days, if you cant afford dual $500 graphic cards and a 1000 watts of power, the Game geeks will just turn theyre backs on you, and after all the support weve given them. Piss on theyre fucking heads!
Well, thanks anyway azidtrip."
,stukov4321,2008-03-20T05:43Z,"Okay it installed fine, I replaced the .exe with the cracked version but whenever i try to load the game it gives me one of those error messages that you get when like a game has crashed, I dl'd the trial and it worked perfectly fien (demo had all features on it) anyone have any ideas on how i can resolve thsi and enjoy this fantastic game?"

You should get a file select box, open up the games download folder you and double-click the FEAR.mds file. Hope that helps you out.

Does anyone know what the trainers are for? I cant read the german install instructions so i dont know what it is or how to install. Thanks"

I've bought this game already, I just can't seem to be able to download the patch from any site since my internet seems to like to cut out when it's halfway completed.  With this torrent, I'll just get the patch, then I'll upload the patch for whoever wants it."
,SEEDITFORME,2008-05-20T14:46Z,"OK... WTF???

I downloaded this game, have been playing for about 4 days (seeding at the same time I might add) but since today everytime I go to play it, after about 20 seconds of play either the screen freezes or everything goes black except for the ammo left on the gun... 
Everything still plays, except I'm either looking at a screenshot, or I'm looking at a number. 

How can I fix it? (I haven't downloaded anything since)... Some one help please, because I am SICK of faulty torrents... If you're going to upload something, do it right or not at all."

,ArchonASV,2008-06-26T04:19Z,"im writing up a proper installation instruction thingy for this torrent, to get it working up to date with patch 1.08 and the nocd patch.  i think azidtrip didnt know that this was version 1.00 .  idk anyway, but the instructions should be up tonight. "
,ArchonASV,2008-06-26T07:00Z,"I took the time to write out the exact instructions on how to install this properly.  After the tiresome amount of time this took to download, I figured out myself how to install it.  (please god damn seed for new ppl)

Anyways here are the steps:

***BEOFRE YOU START READ THIS***
READ EVERY STEP SLOWLY TO UNDERSTAND IT. IF YOU DONT THEN YOU COULD FUCK THIS UP. SO READ CAREFULLY.

INSTALL INSTRCTIONS FOR F.E.A.R.  WinXP

1. Download this torrent.  I reccommend not to download the multiplayer crack as you can't
play multiplayer with the files provided in this torrent.  Those of you who got it working, 
congrats have fkn fun.  If you desire to play online then you must go to www.joinfear.com 
and register to get the CDKEY, once you have that, download the game files for F.E.A.R. 
Combat. It's pretty much the same thing just a different name and from a different place.

2. Download PowerISO from their site (www.poweriso.com).  It is a free trial/evaluation copy so you will have to get a serial from (www.serials.ws) if you want the full version.  If you dont want the full version - (although it is better to have it) - just skip this 
registration step. First find out the version of your ISO program, then type ""PowerISO"" in 
the search bar in serials.ws, find your version in the list, click it and type the username 
and password in PowerISO's registration window.

3. Open the ISO file with PowerISO and extract the ALL the files to a folder of whereever 
you choose on your hardrive.  I recommend making a folder in your 'My Games' called 
'FEARinstallfiles' and extracting it there.  Once completed extraction hit the setup.exe 
from the folder and install the game.  Remember when the installer asks you for the serial for the game, you have to get it in your folder with all the install files.

4. Alright, lets do a check test.
a) Downloaded this F.E.A.R. torrent?
b) Registered to joinfear.com, got the CD Key and downloaded and installed F.E.A.R. Combat?
c) Downloaded PowerISO?
d) Got the full version of PowerISO by getting the serial from serials.ws? (optional)
e) Used PowerISO to extract the installation files and then installed the game using the 
setup executable file?

IF COMPLETED THEN MOVE ON TO STEP 5.

5. With both the multiplayer and singleplayer installed, you now have to update the game to
version 1.08 to get rid of all the bugs and shit you may experience playing on version 1.00
you have installed as of this moment.  To do this, this requires alot of downloading of
patches.  And yes, you have to install every patch in order from 1.01 to 1.08 or it will not
work.

Before this step you need Winzip or WinRAR.  I dont see why anyone wouldnt have it, its
one of those programs everyone has.  To get it, google it.  Then YOU find the serial, im
pretty sure you'll know how after step 2.

***NOTE: The game you have installed is the UK version, not the US version.  HOWEVER, I dont know why but these following steps are mixed with US and UK patches, dont worry and dont care, it works. If it doesnt work for you, you could have screwed up a step, or youve got a problem with your computer, but im pretty sure not one that'll cost you money so its not serious (could just be a update problem or setting or I have no clue really, do your best to figure it out yourself). If you think you screwed up on a step, just uninstall and reinstall from the folder I told you to make using obviously the setup.exe file.***

6. Go to this link--->http://www.gamershell.com/download_11187.shtml
Choose your location and hit download.  Once downloaded, install the update to your system.
You now have version 1.01 of FEAR.

7. Go to this link--->http://www.gamershell.com/download_11345.shtml
Follow the same step as explained in step 6 to download and install it.

8. Now, go to this link--->ftp://ftp.vugames.com/pub/sierra/fear/updates/

9. Once at the new page scroll down til you find the updates that look like this:
fear_update_engb_###_###.exe.  The (engb) is the UK version.  The (en) is the US version.

10. You have to download the updates in o"
,danieljackson,2008-06-26T20:23Z,"Thank you ArchonASV, its good to see somone that will take the time out of their day to write up and fix the problems of the community here at TPB. Your tutorial on the install is greatly appreciated may you continue to prosper in the world of torrents :)"
,danieljackson,2008-06-26T20:57Z,"Gentlemen we need more seeders, currently the tracker is showing 68 seeds, 256 leaches at a download rate of 79kbps/ on a 4 and half gig file that is horrendous please when you finish the download make sure you keep seeding afterwards."
,sadlerrr,2008-06-29T02:03Z,please seed for at least two weeks. we need this game.
,sadlerrr,2008-06-29T04:22Z,does this work on vista?
,Demonsoul98,2008-07-06T16:55Z,"Thanks, ArchonASV. I haven't finished downloading this yet, as a matter of fact I just started, but your guide will definitely help. I would've most likely figured it out eventually, but when people put fucked up torrents on here, it gets annoying.  Again, I thank you. Also, people complaining about 80kb/s downloads, what the fuck do you expect? I'm sitting here downloading at 30kb/s and uploading at 80kb/s, so quit whining and thinking you're better and deserve a faster download. Go buy the fucking game if you're going to complain."
,Demonsoul98,2008-07-06T16:56Z,"I forgot to add, Sadlerr, yes F.E.A.R. will work on Vista. IF it doesn't work for you put it in compatibility mode with XP Service Pack 2."
,ArchonASV,2008-07-10T18:21Z,"No problem danieljackson + Demonsoul98, I agree 100% with Demonsoul98.  It gets stupid annoying sometimes when there are retarded torrents, and also when people complain about there speed, yeah, go fucking buy the damn thing.  Anyway, FEAR is kickass, and from the sites provided in the drop list in utorrent when you search, ive searched all of them and this one is the one with the most seeds, so I wrote a instruction thingy for it.  Im currently downloading the other two expansions.  Im exited !!! :]  haha, anyway, yourwelcome. 

PS: I love, commas.  hahaha"
,Hex73,2008-07-11T15:19Z,"Just wanted to thank the uploader and the person who took the time to write the guide on the updates etc.

One thing, I got a CRC error during installation (before updates). I clicked retry several times which seemed to work and then I'd get another CRC error (something about a corrupt installation file). Eventually I clicked IGNORE and the game seemed to install fine. 

Not sure if thats what the updates are meant to fix or not but I thought I'd let everyone else know that I got some errors during installation. This may be totally normal.

Currently installing updates so I will see in a minute if the game works or not."
,Hex73,2008-07-11T16:20Z,Yep works %100 fine so far. Thanks again.
,Sqyazz,2008-07-18T16:23Z,What about adding the instructions to the actual Torrent?

It's disappointing."

oh, the autorun popup says that it's the Directors Cut version, which is even better. Well worth the wait for it!
NO-CD works fine, runs on vista ultimate x64 perfectly.

Oh, and a little known fact: 
Go to http://projectorigin.warnerbros.com/fearcombat/main to get a free cd-key for the multiplayer. 
That key unlocks the whole game, so use that to install it. Works a charm. "

,Ungue,2009-07-16T18:59Z,"I've tried to do this multiple times. I've downloaded it off utorrent perfectly fine, and have it sitting in my box. I burnt the .iso onto a disc and the disc works fine. Except for the fact that after I install it, whenever i try to play it there's a problem. Either FEAR stops running (encountered a problem and is closing), or doesn't recognize or ""authorize"" the disc.

methods done:
1: w/o any patches
2: w/ patches up to 1.02
3: w/ 1.08 patch (inside the folder itself, no other patches)"

Use this for a crack after patching. Works better.

sorry it's a bit long but it's more detailed.

1: download the torrent (you may notice you got only a bunch of stuff, not an ISO file)

2: download and install PowerISO

3: open the PowerISO and press the ''mount'' button (you may need to make a new virtual drive with poweriso)

4: choose whatever you want, G: drive, H: drive or whatever and select ''mount image''

5: search the folder you have downloaded, and select the .mdf file

6: now you should have a splash screen, so press ''install'' then.

7: let it install

8: extract the F.E.A.R.V1.08.ENG.MACIOZO.NOCD rar file

9: move the crack icon (what you've extracted now) to the C:>program files>sierra>FEAR and replace the original one

10: use the update you got in the torrent folder

11: double click the FEAR icon

12: fap fap fap"

@severed1314, & anyone with similar problem-
on the second page of comments ArchonASV gives nearly perfect instructions. Seeing as this torrent is going on three years old, some of the links given are no long working but if you do some searches on the missing patches and follow his directions step-by-step it should solve any problems. Takes a bit of time but is well worth it. Hope this helps future downloaders~"

I have not the installation configuration since I originally installed it. I Googled my problem but have yet to receive a straight answer from anyone. Help please?"
