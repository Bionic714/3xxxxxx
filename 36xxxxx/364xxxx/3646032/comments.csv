,OrpheusDude,2010-11-14T06:43Z,"Whatever the fuck this is, it is NOT ""Couple tracks from Federico Fellini's 8-1/2!""

The original soundtrack - easily available if you want to pay for it - has 12 tracks.  Here you give us 7 tracks (which you can't even number properly - you list 8 tracks but there is no #6) with NO information whatsoever: no titles, no nothing.

That might explain why the first track is NOT EVEN FROM 8-1/2: it's from AMARCORD.

A few of the other tracks - five at the most - MIGHT be from the original soundtrack to 8-1/2 but I am only going by soundbites from the real album on Amazon (which I am now going to buy since there is no decent active torrent for it that I can find).

If you're looking for the original score to 8-1/2, DO NOT waste your time with this bullshit torrent."
