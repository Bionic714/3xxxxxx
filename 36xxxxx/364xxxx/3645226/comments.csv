,mike123,2007-03-23T01:50Z,Are you kidding? Vista is shit!
,mike123,2007-03-23T14:20Z," Dear Stebo (my 'challenged' friend),

lol sure. I'm busting with envy to have my box infested with the biggest piece of spyware ever devised! Sure! Isn't everyone? 
Doesn't everyone want to be a part of totalitarian nightmare?
Imagine a boot stomping on a human face forever! That is what Vista represents to me!
If you do not understand what I am talking about, or do not recognize the paraphrased boot thing (or who wrote it), then I suggest you go get an  education.
In the meantime I highly suggest you go and get a 'Live' disk for one of the many available Linux distributions. Linux is 'Open Source' There is nothing sneaky about it. Microsoft products, on the other hand, are all closed source - and VERY SNEAKY!!!
Do you have any idea of  the information that   Windows reports secretly? It is the biggest piece of spyware ever!
I would rather buy a truckfull of cowshit for my 'tomato plants' than pay for the privilege of giving my soul to further the totalitarian machine.

Bozo!

Thanks for reading."
,thegr8ashish,2007-03-23T16:24Z,Hello mike123 can u plz tell me wt type of info does Windows reports secretly TIA
,ratn9ne,2007-03-23T18:28Z,"Neither Linux or Vista is better. each has its advantages and disadvantages. as to spyware, if microsoft really reported secret information, they would have been caught and sued by now. It is however unfortunate that microsoft does so much behind closed doors."
,jizac2,2007-03-24T01:39Z,"Thanks for sharing... appreciate the upload!


Take your linux versus Windows somewhere else please... Don't crap on the guy's torrent."
,mike123,2007-03-24T04:14Z,"Vista is about as secure as a mouse in a snakepit. Anyway, I'll keep it brief. Here is one Vista's funnier vulnerabilities;

,The_Pirate_Ghost,2007-03-26T04:32Z,"okay... lets see... fist of all, im sory that i have to write this on your torrent comments... but i couldnt resist.

what is a P.C. ? PERSONAL computer.

now if microsoft is to put something into there operating system, that would beviolating our write to privacy. and as said by , someone would have found it by now. it is called a P.C. for a reason, its not an M.C., its a P.C.

i may not be the computer guru of the universe, but i have torn apart vista inside and out and i did not find anything that would do such a thing as to report anything to anybody. i have deleated billions of files and vista doesnt care or say ""WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO WITH MY SHIT BITCH???""... until it stops running after too much key items have been removed.

and about linux. yes it is a great OS. fantastic... as long as you do not want to do SHIT with your computer. as long as you do not play games, go to high end internet sites... you will be okay, but me personaly... i like to get the most out of my computer. and thanks to people like , we can enjoy it very inexpencivly. 

as said... its a P.C. . if microsoft had something like that, i would be lining up behind everyone else getting ready to enjoy early retirement.

there is not ""tracker"", there is no ""reporter"", so please stop saying there is, there is not point to it. and if you have 10 freaking seconds, just say ""thanks for the upload"" or something, because its guys like this who share with everyone. unless they are sharing viruses, they dont need anyones shit, so please, stop trying to give it to them.

P.S.
great upload!"
,mike123,2007-03-26T14:36Z,"Good luck to you. Your apparent ignorance brings you bliss I am glad you are so easily pleased.
Do you really know the difference between open and closed source?
Anyway, have fun while it lasts."
,mike123,2007-03-26T14:43Z,"If you DO decide it is worth doing a little homework, try reading this;

,bobthedownloader,2007-04-03T08:11Z,"Just to say, there is something inside Windows XP that sends a signal to Microsoft whenever your computer is turned on. But that can be removed, and it doesn't go ""WHERE THE FUCK IS IT!"", other than that, I have found nothing else. And I don't know if its included in Vista."
,jaffer1,2007-04-07T17:46Z,i have windows vista basic if i download this will it be upgraded to buisiness of will it delete all my files and then download business?
,jaffer1,2007-04-07T17:47Z,and can i get some fucking seeds man?
,jaffer1,2007-04-07T17:47Z,seeddd
,bobthedownloader,2007-04-19T10:10Z,"Btw dude, you title says x86, why the fuck do you say 32bit in description?"
,ratn9ne,2007-04-22T06:15Z,how many bits should it be lol ?
,Cerin_halfdrow,2008-02-20T23:01Z,"vista x86 is a 32 bit operating system o.O thats why it says 32bit

also, most of the crap about vista is all rumors. The only few downsides are that sometimes it is a little less user friendly and file transfer is slower. And also what the guy said about linux is entirely wrong. Linux is able to do anyhting that windows can except that it isnt compatible with some games. Opens source is the shit, i actually have two operating systems, one per hard drive.

I boot form one drive to run windows, mainly for games. And i boot form another for linux, mostly for work. "
