This is Windows Vista 32bit Business Edition - but reduced by more than a gig and it is unattended install with extra software pre-installed. It owns the default vista images in all aspects. There is a crack and no need for a cd-key ever.

It has been tested quite a bit.


some raid drivers are on the cd.
