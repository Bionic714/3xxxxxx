Crazy Penis is an electronic music act from the United Kingdom, formed in around 1995 by Chris Todd and Jim Baron, when they met at university. They later expanded to include the bassist Tim Davies, percussionist Mav, and vocalist Dannielle Moore.

Crazy Penis is often called Crazy P on more conservative radio stations, in a way to avoid saying the word penis out loud.

They are most famous for their track "There's a Better Place" which samples the song "Pure Imagination" from the movie Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.
