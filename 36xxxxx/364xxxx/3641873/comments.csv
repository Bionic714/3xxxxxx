,Lasher,2007-03-19T13:00Z,"Has anyone played this release yet? is it working well, or is it slow n choppy, Ive seen some bitching between Vitality and Hatred, wondering if theese fags are just ass ramming each other or if there's something wrong in the crack code. 

Working? Yes, or No. 

Thanks."
,gravyhusker,2007-03-19T13:25Z,"IT WORKS ALRIGHT

BUT performance is substandard. Graphic are not impressive at all. It's a choppy ride even at recommended sytem requirements. I got 7800 gtx 256 MB and 2 GB RAM. Looks like they stressed this release. If you ask me they got the chills and just released the shit they were sitting on. A big huge disapointment after nearly 6 years of developing this hunk of crock. Probably because with vista and the new era they had to finish this so they would get back some of the money spent. Sorry all you stalkerheads out there for bringing the bad news.   

Download it from here but don't bother buying it. It's not worth supporting crap cause then they will feed us more of it. 

6 years and nothing to show for it... "
,Lasher,2007-03-19T14:05Z,"The screenshots impress the graphics quite alot, but you need a good system to max out AA and AF to make HDR and shaders look the best they can be.

and you can't fault the atmosphere in this game, wouldn't say it was substandard according to the reviews i've read.

However i have a crap graph card so i cant see the sky :S chances are alot of older graph card will have alot of graphical bugs in this game. The effects and gameplay is sweet tho."
,EsChRiChT,2007-03-19T17:49Z,"I've tested Stalker now, but the game lag alot.

,Churchills Dog,2007-03-19T17:54Z,"to be honest I'm sick to fucking death of games that look great and are fucking duller than shit. Frankly, I don't care if this looks dated bt a couple years, the gameplay seems  different and thats more than enough for me."
,Nostro333,2007-03-19T17:58Z,Eschricht maybe updating your driver might solve the problem.If not try adjusting your graphical settings for VGA card.Hope this helps>GL
,EsChRiChT,2007-03-19T18:03Z,"Got the latest drivers and everything. guess I'll have to wait for a patch or something. The game lags even on low settings.

But its a little bit slow :S seed plzzz : )"
,Lasher,2007-03-19T18:48Z,"My mate has tested the game, and multiple cracks, and the reason the Vitality release lags, is beacause they are shit and can't make cracks. the -HATRED crack, is much better, and lag free.

Although my friend did get booted off the game from a random freeze, it's only happened once, may or may not be related to the crack. I will up the HATRED crack if people want/need it. It'll save having to download the whole fuckin Hatred version just for their crack."

,Lasher,2007-03-19T20:51Z,"My torrent program ain't shit, it's Utorrent, but u can't download the crack seperately from inside the HATRED release, because it's all rar'd up.

and I'm a noob when it comes to uploading, got no idea how, so if u want the crack. Email Juxaxmdm@gmail.com and ask for it, I'll send it as an attachment. (also, i'm doing this as a faver, so if i get 10 emails asking for the crack, I will send it, don't give me any shit bout viruses, I ain't a cunt, i'm doin it cuz I'm nice) "

,Nostro333,2007-03-19T22:57Z,"Eschricht, i know this sounds weird,but u could use an older driver or so..For e.g. i had Kotor running way better on different driver,i have an Ati card so its a pain in the ass but got it trough and actually worked a bit less laggier than the other one(not necesarely a newer one).I doubt these lags are because of ur system config.."

,BucKFasT,2007-03-21T15:06Z,"I´ve installed and played the game last night for about 2 hours and for you guys reading all the comments before you download a game maybe this helps::

This game is good. My first 2 hours was a pleasure, enjoyed it were much. 

I will buy this game, cause I´m into Multiplaying games and do not care so much to play the game as a single player, but I will probably play it til the end before I go on the Internet. 

Anyway, I have a top-notch computer and that will help the game a lot. 

Intel Core 2 Duo E6600
Corsair TWIN2X 6400 DDR2, 2048MB 
MSI GeForce 8800GTX 768MB GDDR3, HDCP, PCI-Express, 2xDVI-I, Tv-Out, 384bit 

The Graphics are amazing, I played as mentioned here Oblivion ect and this is far more complex and the enviroment is smashing! 
The game engine is exellent and it runs like a sharm on my computer. 

If you do not have a top-of-the-line computer at home at the moment you will not be disapointed but it takes the WoW feeling away, my friend has waited for this game forever and he got a good machine but not ""that"" good and it lags ect but still he is amazed! 

So, S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a good game, but needs a bit of power to get that extreme intense enviroment that this game has to offer! 

Goodspeed!

,kaaos,2007-03-23T00:42Z,"This is an excellent game; it takes a little while to get going, but it's fantastic once you start getting into it. It does require some horsepower to run smoothly, but other than that it's a great game. I'll be buying this one."
,subvert,2007-03-23T04:49Z,"Read the comment on the previous page regarding openal if the loading screen pops up and then goes away and nothing happens. This solved my problem really easily. If you can't find it in add/remove programs go to your windows folder then system 32 folder, search fro openal and delete the old openal32.dll file Then reinstall openal, and the game should work fine from there."

,Ghen,2007-03-25T23:53Z,"A little guide for anyone having difficulty running the game:

1. find the folder where you downloaded the game
2. extract the game files from vty-ssoc (there will be a bunch of .rar files you only need to extract one)
3. go to the folder you extracted the game files to with daemon tools and mount the image inside.
4. install the game, when you see the enter serial number screen ignore it and press next. when your at the end uncheck the ""play now"" box and click finish
5. now go into the drive where you mounted the image and go to the ""vitality"" folder and copy the .exe file inside.
6. go to where you installed the game, go into ""bin"" and paste the .exe file, it will ask if you want to replace it click yes.
7. your done, create a shortcut to the crack and put it on your desktop to be able to play it whenever you want!"

,Arkinos,2007-03-27T11:36Z,"The game works just fine, except from one "" small "" problem. Some items in the game bugs.. for example:

When a guy sits by the fire and plays a guitar, the guitar looks all screwed up.

And when i use the bigger weapons, ( like the akm's ) i can't see the weapon at all.. just my hands that are supposed to hold it.

Its the same when i get attacked by opponents wich use em... the weapon is not in their hands , instead it flyes around in the air beside them....

Extract the files. Mount/burn the ISO. Install. Do not enter a serial number, just press next. Do not launch when finished. Then, go to ""My Computer"" and right click... explore the game while mounted/burned. In the game folder is a folder called ""HATRED"".
