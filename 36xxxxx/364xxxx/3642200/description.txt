Irene Cara (of FLASHDANCE soundtrack fame) and Lonette McKee star in this dramatic story of a musical trio's rise to stardom.  Three sisters, who are raised in an impoverished neighborhood, have dreams of become pop singers. After a dark period which includes entering several amateur talent shows, they are finally discovered, and enter a world of glamour and fame. Like many though, they soon learn that there is a dangerous side to success, and they must find ways to combat the threat of self-destruction. The musical score by Curtis Mayfield adds rich soul to the drama, and the three women's tour-de-force performances are riveting.
