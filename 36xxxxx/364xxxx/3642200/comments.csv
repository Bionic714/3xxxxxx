Please continue to seed after you download so everyone else can enjoy this great classic movie also, okay?  Please.  I don't think anyone even knew it's been on dvd since January so we need to 'get the word out' don't we?? ;)"
,lee369,2007-11-17T19:32Z,Please seed this again. I promise to reseed 2+copies if you will reseed. Thanks
,thruster77,2007-11-27T10:36Z,"nvkat, please seed little bit.
At the moment threre is about 8 leechers w 99,7 % completed. Seed that 0,3 %, then we take seeding over.
Thx :)"
,mannilim,2007-11-29T02:46Z,I am stuck at 99.8% please seed the remaining .2% and I'll try to seed as long as I can :) Thanks mate :-D
,lee369,2007-12-01T13:52Z,"Can you seed this? My azureus is on 24/7 so I will gladly help with seeding once I have a full copy. 
PLEASE SEED..."
,nvkat,2007-12-02T05:31Z,"Ok, folks! Will do.  I do check back from time to time, didn't know you all were stuck.  Good classic flick, enjoy!  Here goes..."

,crosby69104,2008-03-29T16:35Z,How do u open this file?
,nvkat,2008-04-01T15:22Z,"crosby, for the .iso file just open Nero Burning Rom, cancel the compilation window if it pops up, then choose ""Burn Image"" from the Recorder menu up at top and just burn the .iso to a blank DVD.  

For the bonus audio cd do the same thing, choose ""Burn Image"", then choose the .cue file and it will load/burn the .bin to a blank CD.  

cheers,
nvkat"
,dmasterp,2009-03-10T06:12Z,"Please guys, seed this....this is one of the all time Afro Classics...I have been looking for this for years. This is right up there with Claudine, Mahogany, The Temptations, The Four Heartbeats and others. "
