,Loathing,2007-03-25T20:05Z,Fungerar klockrent!! Tack herr UL:er. Many greetings for a nice work you guys doing.
,vicafk,2007-03-26T09:08Z,"Pixar you're a n00b, there's no "" OFFICEKEY.EXE "" in the .rar archive, that trojan you got from downloading a office keygen which obviously has a trojan in it, next time you get a smart ideea to post a comment on tpb make sure you know what you're talking about."
,Loathing,2007-03-26T14:17Z,Yeah Pixar..You are just a fucking retarded fool that  obviously dont know what the hell you`re talking about. I downloaded this yesterday and patch my parents windows copy and workt fully and now I`m patching my own copy. I do run Kaspersky and nothing strange or hidden in this file so go be retarded some where else thank you !! 
,Cmd_Chakotay,2007-03-26T15:18Z,Invalid product key! :P
,Divnada,2007-03-28T23:05Z,Thanks so much for this one ! works great :)
,24februari,2007-03-29T09:58Z,When I try to change the key with KeyFinder it says that the key is not valid. How can I get around?
,vicafk,2007-03-29T11:58Z,"You're probably using Xp Home edition, in which case you need to find a valid Xp Home edition serial number. The same goes for other versions than XP Professional, the keygen included in this package generates valid keys for Windows XP Professional & Windows 2003 Server ONLY."
,waynedl,2007-03-29T15:13Z,"Tested it today, worked fine. Anyone who has any trouble with this (at least till the next 'fix' by M$) isn't readin' the instructions or is an idiot!!!"
,Eventine,2007-03-29T22:49Z,"At first it seemed like this didn't work, but after a reboot everything worked like a charm. IE7, Mediaplayer 11, Micro$oft update etc worked perfectly.
Thanks a lot! :-)"

,Alakai,2007-06-29T13:10Z,"Works lika a charm! :)
I took me several seconds to find out that I have to actually download the latest WGA from MS itself, in the last step :P

Now up to the real test! If I still have an ""genuine"" copy after installing NET Framework 2.0 and the ""even latest"" WGA, via MS Update.."

,webranger,2007-07-21T23:12Z,"As I feared, this does not appear to have helped me. My XP is genuine (acquired from this site, educational, doesn't need validation).

My Office 2007Pro is also genuine, but is a trial version downloaded from Microsoft, but now the trial has expired and it has become read only. I was given a file mod that should have prevented this happening; obviously it didn't work or a Ms update wrecked it.

With great trepidation and care I downloaded these files and followed the instructions. But it hasn't unlocked my Office suite. 

The Keygen exe has produced a new ID for ""Office XP"" which may well be a solution, but I don't know where to put it. Can anyone help?"
,bloodface,2007-08-06T14:44Z,"This is great!!!!  I've dicked around with tons of other cracks for WGA, and this is the first one that worked.  I understand the whole thing about a clean version, but I don't really have the ability to reinstall.  Thanks a ton!"
,sjwbos,2007-08-10T11:45Z,Works perfecly! Don't get scared off if it tells you in the WGA check that there are cryptographic problems! Just go on with the installation! Works perfectly! Thanx uppr!
