,LumpAlmighty,2008-04-05T09:30Z,why hasn't anyone bundled these episodes together into one torrent yet like all the other seasons...
,vrolok_1,2008-06-21T00:16Z,why .rar a 250 mb file?  why rar a file at all?
,Donate,2008-06-21T01:53Z,"I think it's because tv episodes etc. are put on ftp (and other type of) servers in rar format first. The reason is that it's easier to continue uploading, and doing it in smaller steps, when having many smaller films.

However, it's debatably lazy not to unpack the rar files before uploading a torrent though. But hey, better than nothing. It does lead to the files being less spread though.

It's a bot."
