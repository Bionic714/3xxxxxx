One of the better UFO documentaries to be shown on TV. Originally recorded in 2000, but was rebroadcast later with new commentary and some interesting edits (hmmm?)
  In my opinion, this one rivals \"Out of the Blue\" and \"UFO\'s: It Has Begun\" as best documentaries on the subject.

Topics covered include the Belgium UFO wave of 1989-1990, Soviet UFO\'s, Greifswald Lights, Chilean UFO study, astronaut and airline pilot sightings. There are numerous interviews with the principals involved, as well as scientists, military pilots, air traffic controllers, and a couple of SETI sceptics for balance.
