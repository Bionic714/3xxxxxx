,lasseAXS,2007-03-19T17:11Z,"This is the same as 300.TS.XViD-20th, somewhat good quality, but i'll wait for something better. The picture is i bit blurry and the sound is somewhat noisy."
,Damazta,2007-03-20T03:52Z,"This is the worst movie ever made. Its so sad that i spend 30 miniuts on this movie... pepole ffs how can you say that this is a great movie, i cant understand . what is this world goning. , People are getting stupider and stupider day by day. its to bad : /"
,KabanaBoy,2007-03-20T07:50Z,"Damazta, your a fucking idiot. Not only do you spell everything wrong, you even thought ""stupider"" was a word, i suggest you don't leave comments on torrents of shit you don't even like and graduate from grade school.

anyways yes, it is the same as 300.TS.XViD-20th."
,Vic3,2007-03-20T10:42Z,"totally agree with KabanaBoy there. I must admit that the fantasy aspect of the movie is a bit to much. I hoped it to be more realistic, but what do ya aspect from the makers of Sin City. The effects and battles are really nice. Very good movie indeed."
,KabanaBoy,2007-03-20T19:32Z,"BoomHour, all ya gotta do is extract one from each ""CD"" folder and you can watch the whole movie."

,nicosm,2007-03-21T10:01Z,"I just want to say that ... even the title is wrong...its not 300 spartans... because each of them had 7 slaves to carry their equipment(too heavy :P), there were also 100 athenians and a few hundreds Thespiis(i think 700). That makes us 3200 people fighting a few dozens or hundreds(i dont really remember) persians."

,Carrepto,2007-03-24T19:30Z,"Nicosm, incorrect, completely. I'll tell you briefly. There were 7,000 Greeks and 300 Spartans, who were the 300 personal guards of King Leonidas, were there. There was a pass at a place called Thermopylae that the Persians wanted to take and go through, forwards inside Greece. A lot of sources said that the Persians had 1,000,000 men. But, Nicosm, the minimum they had, the real MINIMUM, was 100,000, if not more. A Greek traitor told Xerxes about a secret second pass in the mountains. So, Xerxes took over 5,000 men called the Immortals, his elite, through that pass, and so, King  of Sparta and his 300 Spartans and 7,000 Greek were surrounded. He knew that death was certain, so he ordered the 7,000 Greeks to retreat, to leave. He stayed with his 300 Spartans. They fought long and hard. What's surprising is that the Persians were pathetic. Them and their 100,000+ army couldn't finish off 300 Spartans in close combat. They simply surrounded them, and started pouring arrows at them. Eventually, the Persians succeeded, I think, but lost the war with Greece. At the battle there were also a 2 thousand slaves that served the Spartans. But you must admit, 300 professional soldiers against 100,000 professional soldiers. So, it was amazing."
,CloudStrifeMojave,2007-04-06T02:17Z,"I downloaded the DVDSCR.Xivd using Azureus, N that shit didn't even play. can sum1 help me out. I REALLY WANT 2 C THIS MOVIE"
,CloudStrifeMojave,2007-04-06T02:22Z,"I dont give a fuck if it was 100 against 1,000. like the king said, ""few stood against many "" that's some impressive shit 4 real life"
,Baltek,2007-06-14T14:01Z,"Another thing about the whole ""The Spartans had an army of slaves"" defence.

Spartan slaves were not allowed to fight.  Only a MAN (aka, one who had gone through the Agogi) was allowed to bear arms and fight.  Soldiering was the reward and price of being a citizen of the city-state of Sparta.  Spartan slaves were not considered citizens and therefore were not allowed to earn the glory that battle brought.

Fuck the movie these comments are entertainment enough lol."
,black-black,2008-01-28T15:01Z,can you seed plz
,Dukarius,2008-07-27T01:29Z,"Yeah, lebeaupaul, really lovely comments all around here. But its tru. Even its an great artwork it also coul be some sort of nationalism propaganda. Heros, fucking Social Darwinism, perfect bodies from anabolics-studios fighting for the greater good of an city called sparta. But maybe that are the basics of any good tale. And it looks so good.
