,Eclipse207,2007-03-29T07:38Z,What's the point of making another torrent with the exact same release as http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3649830/Lost.S03E14.HDTV.XViD-Caph ? 
,jihad_rio,2007-03-29T07:41Z,"the other release is compacted by winrar.

this release is the .avi file

thanks"
,jihad_rio,2007-03-29T07:43Z,"look: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3649830/Lost.S03E14.HDTV.XViD-Caph

27 files...."
,Eclipse207,2007-03-29T07:51Z,"""the other release is compacted by winrar""...
So what? It´s still the exact same release. It´s just stupid to make another torrent."

,Eclipse207,2007-03-29T07:59Z,Read the articles i showed you. You made a torrent of the avi-file and NOT of the original release with sfv and nfo files. It´s stupid and makes file sharing more complicated and unefficient. End of discussion.
,Eclipse207,2007-03-29T08:01Z,Do you even know what a svf-file is? Find out before you do anything else.
,Eclipse207,2007-03-29T08:02Z,sfv not svf. sorry

,dsrs,2007-03-29T12:55Z,"WARNING DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU WANT TO WATCH ON HOME DVD PLAYER

for three weeks in a row this asshole CAPH has done bad rips. you would think you could trust EZTVEFNET. but no. read the 100 posts on their forum. 

caph cannot code. his stuff plays ok on the computer but cannot be burned to cd or dvd and then played on a real tv. he makes a very simple mistake.

but the guys at EZTV insist they put up his rips instead of the FULLY WORKING ones, because caph is first to post. this is because caph's canadian station in BC airs earlier than elsewhere. and EZTV is a canadian operation in BC. simple jingoism. when are canadians going to grow up.

So you cannot trust eztv. to be safe, avoid all caph releases for the moment. there are always others of proven reliability: lol, xor etc etc

"
,clahey,2007-03-29T15:23Z,"I download these files specifically to watch on my computer. I have never had a problem with Caph releases. Since I do not even have a TV, it's nice to get this stuff as early as possible.

He's an asshole because we can't watch them on a standalone DVD??? Maybe we don't all need or want to. Seems a lot of people download them anyway.

Oh, I am from Canada, and I'm all grown up.."

,Kadiblov,2007-03-30T00:43Z,"DSRS, I agree with you that Caph could have done it better, but just because it doesn't play on Home DVD players, this doesn't make the person an asshole. 
However, your comment is true as an advisory - only. You could have done for the construtive approach - your message could be more receptive... Think about it."

caph releases are worth avoiding imho
last week i got a caph release of Lost 13 and it didnt unrar.
ffs"

,jwylie,2007-05-12T01:39Z,"I agree with the dude who watches it tv/dvd player...this is (imho) a much more enjoyable way of watching...erhhhh...tv. Fair enough most people DO watch it on there pc, and because it is on a PC in the first place you would expect it to work on a pc, yeah? But its always nice to know that it DOESN'T work on a dvd player/tv. Anyway I`m of to watch ""Borat"", yes on my dvd player, yes on my tv good nite kids."

Simple enough. No burning dvds, no yelling at caph, no complining."
