,ih8skids,2007-03-18T18:59Z,This plays in a regular dvd player too right? I guess I would need a dl disc (or is it split to fit on 2 4.7gb discs)?
,Halbermunken,2007-03-18T19:09Z,"Umh, no, it should not work with regular DVDs."
[T],DasBot,2007-03-18T19:20Z,"Your DVD player will never be able to handle the x264 encoded video, neither the Matroska container."
,LuckyLoops,2007-03-19T02:27Z,What's the idea of ripping a blueray disc and then compress it to DVD quality?
,Miiqu,2007-03-19T07:03Z,maybe your Blueray DVD can playback it ? Id imagine DL DVDs are still cheaper then Bluerays. Can someone confirm this ?
,Miiqu,2007-03-19T07:28Z,"and since there  always is someone who just doesnt get it, by Blueray DVD i meant Blueray Player."
,chacalo,2007-03-19T12:35Z,Subtitles?

This is MPEG-4 so the quality is much better than what you will get from a dual layer MPEG-2 DVD of the same size."

,robban1983,2007-03-21T21:44Z,"The quality of this rip is superiour to the dvd-version. The DVD-version is not even close...
But you need a computer to play the file.
There is a sample file in the torrent, download and watch for your self"

You need a BluRay-DVD-player to handle the format of the video.
You also need to burn it on a double-layer DVD to get enough space for it. More about the BluRay format here:

,trinavarta,2007-03-25T00:36Z,wow... 720p! thank you man!
,tpcomment8,2007-04-01T04:26Z,"The quality of this movie is unbelievable.  It made the picture of my TV looks so good, even better than plasma, if you can believe it.  Thanks for uploading!"
,tpcomment8,2007-04-01T04:36Z,I copied the sample clip to a regular DVD disc and tried to play it in the PS3 with no success.  The PS3 did recognize the file!  Anyone tried anything similar?
,nightsongz2,2007-04-02T08:01Z,Here's a question: Is it possible to mount this image on a virtual drive and play it on the pc? I have PowerDVD Ultra 7.0 that can play HD DVD & BluRay discs. I assume the virtual drive would have to be able to read the Bluray image also...anyone hear or know anything about this? Thanx :-)
,nightsongz2,2007-04-02T08:04Z,I know this is just an MKV video file that does not need to be mounted...but I was just wondering if anyone had the answer to my question.
,nightsongz2,2007-04-02T08:11Z,"I didn't mean ""this image""...like I said, I know it's an mkv file...I meant if someone ripped a Bluray image...sorry. lol Ok...I'm done. Click on my name and send me a message if you have an answer for me. Thanx again."
,derosse,2007-04-05T20:32Z,"--- 720P? ----

720p = 1280*720pixels
this movie = 1280*528pixels

You don't want to spend bits on black borders => the movies has been cropped"
,TT86,2007-04-09T22:11Z,"I'm trying to play this in CCCP Media Player Classic and all I get is audio, no video. Any ideas on what to do?"
,TheNightWolf,2007-04-11T15:51Z,VLC player plays most formats.. so if it's an .MKV file it should work.
,Hybrid R600,2007-04-17T22:08Z,"if i use VLC player, can i then play the film in full quality??
And is my system good for the film: Pentium 4 3.0Ghz, 512 mb RAM, ATI 9800xl"

,Pitbull_Raven,2007-04-28T13:17Z,Theorem: please explain more.
,Pitbull_Raven,2007-04-28T14:09Z,By the way... has anyone successfully dloaded this entire thing? Seems to be stuck for the last couple of weeks.
,andreasXPS,2007-04-29T18:29Z,"Just download then Example1 : Take the file and place it in a external harddrive, this harddrive must have HDMI output, and you need a HD Ready TV.

Example 2 : Download and play with computer, use HDMI Cable/ Component or DVI Cable, this is the easiest way and do not cost as much as External Harddrive with HD Output for example ""Twix M-5000 HD"" 

Hope it works for everyone, my english isnt the best sorry :/"
,andreasXPS,2007-04-29T18:31Z,"Update: This movie can be played with PowerDVD 7.0, VLC Player.

,annukka,2007-05-10T15:34Z,"Been downloading this one for a goddamn week for now, even though I have 8/1 DSL. Every time I seem to get decent dl rate the data is corrupted. Only 6,20 GB done and 3,70 GB WASTED. Could this be somehow linked to ""theorems"" comment above?"
,Daddy_Spank,2007-05-12T22:10Z,I still have not found a program to play mkv files properly with 5.1 sound through SPDIF output. The only program who I found does it is Showtime but it doesnt render the picture at all!! Please help. Vista 32bit here. Thanks!!!
,dj_komodo,2007-05-15T01:51Z,"Daddy Spank: I use windows media player with the Haali Media splitter (to play the .mkv files), then i installed the AC3 filter. Im using a optical cable from my laptop to the reciever and a DVI-HDMI to the plasma. 5.1 sound works great"
,Daddy_Spank,2007-05-17T01:27Z,"thanks komodo, I found a setting in the ac3 filter to use spdif that solved the problem, but not with this one, I never got it to finish 100% and the dts audio track makes really loud clicks all the time, so I had to revert back to stereo, because then the clicks are gone. realy strange... using cccp codec pack and all other mkv files are working great btw, I think this is the format to go in the future."

It blocks all known gov, p2p, spyware, etc ip addresses from connecting to you. I always run it when I'm downloading a torrent.

However on this movie, FASM did the better job at half the size. 

Compare the ss, they are properly named.
