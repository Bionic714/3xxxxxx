Have removed them or what?"
,ruben123,2007-03-27T22:10Z,"It means the resolution is smaller. Meaning not so good quality on cutscenes. There is a version out with top quality scenes. Im playing it atm. Its a version thats on 2 dvd`s. One for each layer, meaning nothing rippped or downsized. I suggest gettin that release.. Found it on mininova."

Also, why upload this again?  The version listed on this site already works perfectly.  Try seeding that instead of this."

,chasetown1,2007-05-07T09:56Z,"I've downloaded this for my son, but I don't know how to copy it to DVD. I've got Nero. If I try to copy it as an ISO DVDROM it tell me that it is bigger than 2GB so to use UDF DVDROM.I tried it and nothing plays. I can't get the image file recognised, so I'm at a total loss. I'd really appreciate some help. Thanks."
