,moracca,2007-03-19T04:03Z,Anyone have any idea why it appears to never be sending the last .6%??  looks like everyone's stuck at 99.4% but I am still seeding!
,moracca,2007-03-19T04:19Z,"I'm sorry everyone, I'm not sure whats going on.  I copied the files to another computer to try to seed from there, and after it checked the folder it tells me I only have 99%...  even though I have all of every file.  If anyone has any suggestions, plz let me know!"
,moracca,2007-03-19T04:29Z,"Forget it, I can't figure out what happened.  It's telling ME I only have 99.4%, so I've created a brand new torrent, with all the songs, and hopefully this one will work to 100%.  I'm sorry everyone!
