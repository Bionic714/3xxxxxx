The Chaser returns to wage another War On Everything taking aim at old and brand new targets. Here is everything you need to know about the War in 2007. The Chaser team will consist of writer/performers Charles Firth, Andrew Hansen, Dominic Knight, Chas Licciardello, Julian Morrow, Craig Reucassel and Chris Taylor. An invitation to Naomi Robson to join the team this year was regrettably declined. Among the regular segments returning to The Chaser's War on Everything in 2007 are: The opening credits, the Ad Road Test, What Have We Learned from Current Affairs This Week? The Crazy Warehouse Guy and Firth in the USA.
