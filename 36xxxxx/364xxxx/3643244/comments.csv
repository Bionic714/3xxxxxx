I searched for a way to play it, installed a few codecs, downloaded a few converters, and after several hours all I was able to do was convert one of the disks to one giant wav file with about 20 songs in it and no titles or any way to jump tracks.  Anyway, unless you are a glutton for that sort of bullshit, don't bother with this torrent."
