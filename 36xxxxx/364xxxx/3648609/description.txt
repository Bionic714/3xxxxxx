Plot:	David Chiang is a Chinese boxer who travels to Bangkiok in search of his lost brother, who may (or may not) be the Thai boxer played by Lung. In any case, this kung fu/Thai boxing combo was one of the mega hits of 1971, second only to "The Big Boss".

Overview:	Another triumph for the "iron triangle" of director Chang Cheh and stars David Chiang and Ti Lung--not to mention action choreographer Liu Chia Liang. Chiang is a Chinese boxer who travels to Bangkok in search of his lost brother, who may (or may not) be the Thai boxer played by Lung. In any case, this kung fu/Thai boxing combo was one of the mega hits of 1971, second only to Bruce Lee's "The Big Boss".
