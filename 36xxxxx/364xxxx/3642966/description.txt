From the profound group, London Elektricity comes a track that i heard from Radio 1 (uk) and just had to have it,

it has a good couple of mixes, with a drum n bass backing and oldies for lyrcis you cant go far wrong really...

Well i quite enjoyed this, and dont forget this is rare lol, took me days to get this, and i didnt even download it i had to rip it off a website to actually get it, so apologies if the quality isnt too good, but i hve had it on my stack and it pumps out better than some songs i have so let me know...
