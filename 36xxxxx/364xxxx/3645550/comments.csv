[T],tmax666,2007-03-24T03:55Z,A SEED would be nice.  NONE at the moment
,Markisen,2007-03-24T17:42Z,"Have patience. I won't be able to seed 24/7 but I will make sure you all get this great release. My upload speed isn't the best either 70kB/s, so have patience and you'll get it."
,Markisen,2007-03-29T07:42Z,"C'mon you guys, gotta help seeding when you're done. I can't go on seeding this myself."
,ghomtuu,2007-06-10T00:59Z,"COOL, lovwes this when it was on TV. How is it with copyright on these old stuff?!?"
,penaf,2007-11-24T11:38Z,"It would be great if someone could get the Mission impossible from 1988! That would be really something cause it's nowhere to be found in the Internet!

Anyway ... thanks for this one! I'll love to watch it after i download! I'll share it for a month in retribution!"

,sonic_assassin,2010-03-19T15:57Z,"Cheers for this torrent.  Yes, be good to see the 1988 ones one day..."
,sonic_assassin,2010-04-08T01:02Z,"There's a lot of people chasing this torrent at present. I wonder if they know who Steven Hill (Dan Briggs) is! Oh, well... they'll find out. And watch for the episode called ""Action"" as - uniquely - it's Cinnamon who gets the recorded message at the start of the show."
