,nominal1979,2007-07-09T02:56Z,"How do I access all the manuals, journals, wheels, etc to get access into the games?"
,nattblind,2007-07-10T12:56Z,wtf is the code word thingy for pool of radiance? some sort of cd key? where can I find it?
,Peejay.s,2007-09-18T20:33Z,"Danke for the game :o),  Still  goth the (original) pool of radiance  ; Adventures journal+ introduction book , Quick start card and the Translation wheel so if any body is intrested let me now."
,Kalmo,2007-10-28T02:17Z,"Sorry to sound like an idiot, but how do you get these to work on XP?"
,BlackavarBunnie,2008-01-27T22:52Z,"To ALL new downloaders:

If you are using DosBox, you are likely to receive an error during the character creation phase of Pool of Radiance that says ""Please insert disk 3 into drive"" whatever.

If you're mounting the game folder as C in DosBox, this is how you fix this problem. In Windows, copy everything in the game folder (default POOLRAD) into a new folder of the same name in the POOLRAD folder. So you will have a C:\POOLRAD\POOLRAD."
,BlackavarBunnie,2008-01-27T22:55Z,"Sorry for posting again, but I felt compelled to clarify. After doing the above, just run start.exe from the FIRST poolrad folder. So c:\poolrad\start.exe

Of course, if you're using dosbox and mounting poolrad as the C drive, then you'd just type DosBox's command prompt: c:\start.exe

Or just start. It's up to you, really."
,broju,2008-01-29T02:52Z,"hey great collection of games, but the passwords that i enter from the online manuals dont seem to work.

Is there a crack required?  Please help!!"
,BlackavarBunnie,2008-01-29T06:59Z,"Broju - I understand that the SSI games from this era can be the most horrifyingly copy-protected games in all existence. I haven't done any work on any of the games except for Curse of the Azure Bonds, Pool of Radiance, and Menzoberranzan. This message may take several posts."
,BlackavarBunnie,2008-01-29T07:00Z,"Here's what you need to know for Curse of the Azure Bonds and Pool of Radiance.
1. You need the codewheel, so there's a digital version of it at doubleyoudoubleyoudoublyoudotgeocitiesdotcom/soho/exhibit/2762/projects/
poolwheel
If you don't know how to use it, just click the same runes from the game as the pictures you see on that page, then hit which path it asks for (dots, dashes, dots and dashes) and then click Click Me!"
,BlackavarBunnie,2008-01-29T07:02Z,"Also go to replacementdocs dot com to obtain adventure journals and manuals and quick reference cards you might need for whichever game you're trying to play.

I've also got a software fix for Menzoberranzan if you want it, but nothing copy-protection related. Let me know if this helps, or if you have any questions, or if you want me to turn my attention to any specific game. Sorry for the weird non-URLs, too. TPB seems to refuse any post that includes a full URL."
,Qwik_Silver45,2008-12-30T05:56Z,"IsItWorthIt you can pick up several and up to 
T.ED v6.7 From www.d-grafix.com. Seem's to have no restrictions on it, however I have not used it as yet. :)"
,djME27,2010-04-11T01:49Z,"It is worth mentioning that this does not support 64-bit operating systems, since compatibility wasn't mentioned in the nfo.  Just so others don't end up wasting their limited download bandwidth like I did.  Old games, but even most old games will install on 64-bit OS... these all throw up error dialog boxes saying it is unsupported at the very start of install.  Thanks anyway"
,wdmagic,2011-01-24T05:54Z,"hey just a FYI for anyone wanting to play old 32 bit video games on a 64 bit pc, you can do this fine if you install VMWARE and make a virtual 32 computer, you can even use DOS 6.22 and run old DOS games fine. works pretty good for me, ive got a windows 95 pc, windows xp, windows 3.11, and a dos pc too, there all virtual. i just install whatever game reqiresments to the corect pc. its great for games like warcraft 2, which is best on 95 or 98, but wont run on anything newer."
,uberpops,2011-12-06T17:33Z,"Every time I downlaod any of this crap I get the same message when I try to install..: ""This game does not support full screen mode."" I'm not a computer genius, so I gotta ask...Does any of this shit actually work without having to get a degree at M.I.T.?"
