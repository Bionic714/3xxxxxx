,TKM625,2007-05-13T06:23Z,"Open up your torrent program and look for the create torrent button. Once you find it, play around with it until you figure out how to make a torrent with the files you want. Then just come here, hit the upload torrent link on the bottom of the page, and it's easy from there. I can't tell you how to make a torrent because I'm not sure which torrent program you use, but a quick Google search of the name and ""create torrent tutorial"" should give you any help you may need.
