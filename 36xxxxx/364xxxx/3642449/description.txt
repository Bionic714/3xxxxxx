Plot:	Ching officials trick northern and southern Shaolin martial artists to fight against each other in hopes that they wipe each other out. The monks get wind of the plan, but is it too late?

Overview:	An evil Ching warlord (Wong Lung Wei) comes up with a brilliant plan to rid the Ching Empire of the Shaolin masters. He invites three Shaoliners to his mansion and has them fight it out with three novice South Shaoliners. Of course, the Northerners win and accidentally kill the Southerners. News of the incident reaches Shaolin, where the elder dispatches three top fighters to deal with the crisis of the Shaolin in-fighting. Here the Venoms are in top notch form under the beady eye of madman Tai Cheh, and the crisp storytelling of the maestro, Chang Cheh.
