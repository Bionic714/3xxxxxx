This CD contains a collection of 20th Century avant-garde classical music from various composers like Ligeti, Feldman, Shuller, Messiaen, etc. Just click on the "File" number above to see the tracklist. Ligeti's "Atmosph?res" was used in the film 2001: Space Odyssey. Bernstein recorded these pieces with the New York Philharmonic in the mid 1960's. This is not easy music to listen to. But if you have an open mind and love modern classical music prepare to be blown away.
