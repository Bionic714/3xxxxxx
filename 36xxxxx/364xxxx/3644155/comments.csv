,guidoanselmi,2012-07-28T18:00Z,"Bernstein recorded ""Atmosphere"" by Ligeti several years before ""2001"" came out. However, Ligeti absolutely HATED the Bernstein recording - and said so in a letter to me when I was trying to track down the complete recordings used in the film. He strong objected to Bernstein's ""ending,"" starts the piece over before the fade out. Ligeti also sued Kubrick, as I recall, over the way his ""Adventures"" was distorted in the bedroom scene at the end of the film."
