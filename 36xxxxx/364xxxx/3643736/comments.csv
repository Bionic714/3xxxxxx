,pether,2007-03-21T02:13Z,"None of those are LAN games for real people.

Heck, you didnt name a single good lan game.
CS is for retards.


Try Sven Coop if you are so horny on valve."
,neckrodevil,2007-03-21T20:30Z,pether ur a fucking retard!!! there are alot of players playing CS and if u dont kile it then shut the fuck up!!!
,Drac0nis,2007-03-22T03:09Z,CS is for little fucking kids who like playing with hacks and running the same god damn weak ass maps over and over for years. Get a life and a real game.
,Getus,2007-03-22T04:14Z,im not a fan of CS ... and this is a pretty weak collection of LAN games ...

,Cofeiini,2007-04-28T14:43Z,"REAL GAMES?
GET A LIFE?
Dude! CS Is Good, But It's True That It Gets Boring.
Once Upon A Time. Some Wise Dude Got Idea To MOD Them.
And They Modded And Played Happily The Rest Of Their Lifes. The End. (Forgive Bad English Or Burn In Hell)"
,DustinBBeebe,2007-06-14T19:02Z,"LMAO  CS is   OK at best thats when it was at the top of it ""feild"" and that wasnt very long any way you got some things i been lookin for but NOT CS. HL  HL:BS  HL:OF  their some pretty decent Old school fun (for an ol timer like me)     But yea....do your self a Favor.... remake this torrent minus the CS and re lable it something Classic Easy LAN/Single Player games      .
These are the types of games where you playit for a day beat it and delete it."
