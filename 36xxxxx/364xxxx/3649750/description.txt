Synopsis
Disc 1. The Film: "A magnificent film, handled with reverence, 
artistic appreciation and admirable restraint" (New York Daily News), 
this glorious epic is an inspiring, grand-scale recreation of the life 
of Jesus of Nazareth, from His humble birth and teachings to His 
crucifixion and ultimate Resurrection. 
Lavishly produced at a cost of $20 million - an enormous amount for 
the time - and honored with five 1965 Academy Award nominations, this 
exceptional motion picture is exquisitely beautiful. Now fully 
restored to its original theatrical brilliance with intermission and 
overture, it is truly The Greatest Story Ever Told..
