Ultima IX: Ascension (1999) is the ninth and final part of the computer role-playing game series Ultima.

Following the Avatar's escape from Pagan, he is transported back to Britannia for one final battle with the Guardian, who is increasingly ruining the physical and moral fabric of that land. He must restore the Runes of Virtue, cleanse the shrines of the Guardian's taint and restore the people to the way of the Virtues ? now knowing that he will never again be able to return to Earth.

Ultima IX was controversial in that it deviated from most of the previous Ultimas' isometric view and party-based gameplay. It sold poorly, and was ill-received by many fans, creating sufficient outcry that Origin shut down an official online help page due to so many negative posts. Ultimately, Richard Garriott left Electronic Arts over "creative differences", thus effectively ending the series. EA retains the rights to the Ultima brand.

A MMORPG sequel of sorts, Ultima X: Odyssey, began development at EA ? but to the further dismay of Ultima fans it was cancelled in 2004, before completion. It was to be set in a world named Alucinor, created by the Avatar following the events of Ultima IX.
