,IsItWorthIt,2007-03-21T23:50Z,"In case someone is doing a search for this game, i might as well add some words for the engine that defines the game: Ultima 9 , Ultima9 ,Ultima IX , Ultima Ascension , Avatar , Guardian , Britannia ... (that should be enough)."
,Me-LoDon,2007-03-22T12:40Z,"sure is worth it
gg"
,djonw,2007-03-23T08:19Z,"I once bought this game, and even after patching it was completely unplayable.

You guys say it's a great game, and it might be, but iirc there are so many bugs that there is no way to tell."
,heuer007,2007-03-24T09:11Z,"its true this game will crash for you even after its patched, but it is IMO one of the best games of all time, and must be played by all"
,morph3x,2007-03-25T13:14Z,seed pls
,IsItWorthIt,2007-03-25T21:38Z,"I am seeding all the time. Seems to go slow though (not my connection, but everyone that is connected to me)... 8.6 kB / sec"
,notyoursavior78,2007-04-24T02:04Z,"I downloaded this for the hell of it because I never played this one though, but it doesn't work. It installs and then I run the crack and yeah I copy over the u9.exe from the crack folder and it just doesn't run. And the actual u9.exe just asks for the cd.  Oh well."
,koffamof,2007-08-10T18:52Z,love this game!
,asscobrapersonal,2007-08-18T12:27Z,Doesn't work for me either. Think the crack is bad or something.
,barzefutz,2007-09-28T13:18Z,test
,barzefutz,2007-09-28T13:19Z,"EVERYONE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE U9.EXE, READ THIS!

Install the game. Do not install patch 1.19!! Instead, download and install the official patch 1.18 from any game site such as www.patches-scrolls.de ."
,barzefutz,2007-09-28T13:20Z,"Then go to www-megagames-com and download a crack for ultima ascension 1.18. There are 2 cracks for 1.18, but only one of them works, I don't remember which one.

Another thing: If you have trouble with finding the rune of compassion which you have to bring to Raven - go to the shrine of compassion and have a look in the air! Because of a bug, the rune is floating in the air and you cannot reach it. There is a cheat for ultima which enables the Avatar to fly. Just google for it. Then enable the cheat, fly up and take the items :-)"
,peruk,2007-10-25T23:42Z,"I'm going to disconnect from all whats... relax, and play this.

Thanks for the info!
I'll seed."
,peruk,2007-10-27T18:21Z,"This works!! No cd needed!

,Drowlord,2007-12-04T00:17Z,"Thanks for the torrent, IsItWorthIt, and thanks for all the great info, barzefutz and peruk."
,kraset,2008-01-09T21:19Z,"Must disagree with the negative comments here. I bought this game quite early. But after applying most patches, I could play the game quite well, and I enjoyed it a lot. Just at Ultima 8 Pagan (which was my entrance into the series except the Underworld 1 & 2 that I also played), it's hard to find another game that has this kind of atmosphere, created by the great music and the great game world. One of the best games I've ever played. Sure, the bugs were frustrating, but as mentioned, after applying most patches, the game is just great to play.
Apart from Daggerfall and Ultima 8 Pagan, I can't really think of an RPG adventure with more atmosphere..."
,RedRightHand,2008-02-05T21:43Z,"I've had this game since it was new, and am now on my third copy (bought an original via eBay, and later as a pack with Ultima Online), and I still haven't finished the game for all the glitches.  It is one of my favorite games, but I've been playing it for about 9 years now and have run into all kids of bugs (saved underwater close to the end of the game, disc got corrupted; breakaway wall didn't break; Lord British disappeared forever; etc.).  I've probably started about 50 new games and still never finished."
,ExPort-NoR,2008-02-06T21:59Z,"I bouth this game when i were little.. And i didnt finish it.. I thought it was about time i done it.. But now I cant get it to work.. It Jammes everytime i try running it.. Hmmm... Tried all the crack but everyone where it DOSENT say i have to insert the play CD it appers the same messege U9 has a problem and most be closed.. Anyone, I need help, runnin' on Xp Pro.. How can I get it to work, and can i get it to work??"
,letsskate,2008-03-12T15:55Z,"thx VERY MUCH!!!

uploaded the classcic RPG !!"
,XX55XX,2008-04-07T22:49Z,Has anyone got this working on Windows XP? It doesn't work for me on XP.
,mhashim,2008-05-20T17:25Z,"Thanks for availing this torrent. I've downloaded the torrent, opened with IsoBuster 2.3 and downloaded the game. When I press play though it asks me to insert the Game CD!!! Can someone help me out here please? "
,jookkor,2008-07-26T21:31Z,"Follow the link that Peruk provided to get this to work. Dont apply a crack after you do it, no need. The patch from that URL removes protection. 

Nice upload and thanks for the Link Peruk. 
yet another game I bought years ago that I had to turn to pirates to get to work =P"
[T],UberMetaller,2008-10-21T17:56Z,"I'm trying to get this to work as well. I'm running it in a virtual machine simulating a Windows 98 SE, and, after applying the patch/crack and trying to run it, I keep getting a message about the game not being able to find some opaque texture."
,Turtonic,2009-03-10T14:20Z,"Great upload works fine! I would suggest not using the crack, instead download 1.19 patch from here at The Pirate Bay. Install it and then it will work without the disk. --Seeding"
,LordOrwell,2009-03-17T06:13Z,"i owned it too.  The official patch made it at least playable.  I will say that this is an excellent game but for some reason they targeted glide hardware.  The game runs smoother nowadays in software mode than with a glide emulator.  Anyway, while it was a great game, ultima underworld 1 and 2 were better, if not as good with graphics."
,MistiAut,2009-08-13T22:40Z,"Ok, so I downloaded this whole thing and I cant find the iso file?  Just all the setup.exe files and what not.. Where is the file located or what is the name of the iso to burn?"
,midgetcatcher008,2009-10-22T23:44Z,"Im having trouble getting this to install on xp. Ive run the compatability for windows 95 and 98 and it doesn't bring up the installer at all. When I run the SetupInstall, it tells me 'unable to launch ISInstall.exe'"
,arcnet,2010-01-25T20:23Z,"@IsItWorthIt: I don't know who told you it wasn't released in Europe, but I bought the german (localized!) version of the game for about 110DM (or 60 Euro) together with a box of Ultima Online. Still have the small map of Britannia hanging on my wall :)"
,deserttrash,2010-09-07T03:33Z,OMG it works! Thank you barzefutz and peruk. I've downloaded this game many times and this is the first time it worked. I also downloaded patch V1.18.
,tsf-1,2011-05-20T04:33Z,"This is one hell of an epic game! It is a must have!!One of the best games of all time along with Fate of Atlantis (Both take place in the hall of fame of the list ""games you must play before you die"")!!! The latest Patch is actually v1.19g (you must have installed first v1.18f (official) then 1.19f (unofficial), v1.19f1 (unofficial) and in the end v1.19g (unofficial) and you can get it from here ---> 
http://www.ultimaaiera.com/ultima9/forgotten-world/ Enjoy!"
,tsf-1,2011-05-20T04:34Z,"Oh! I forgot to thank you for the upload, Im currently downloading.."
,TheTrueLM,2011-06-02T02:54Z,"I d/l this torrent and followed your instructions exactly the first time. I use the auto run.exe and then click play, a msg pops up saying u9.exe experienced a problem and had to shutdown.

When I install again but this time I do it the way that one guy said to do. But the game keeps asking for a CD.

I need to know if this torrent was made to even work on Windows XP. If it is supposed to work on XP, then is there a d/l that requires me to mount the image so I can just use that as the CD?"
,Forgoth,2012-01-11T18:22Z,is anyone seeding? i get like 10 KB/s >.
,DrMerman,2012-08-19T21:53Z,"I used to live off this game. Thanks so much for the upload. WILL SEED FOR LIFE!
Definitely worth it ;)"
