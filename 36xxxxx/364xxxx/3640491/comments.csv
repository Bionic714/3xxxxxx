,Dreamtorrent,2007-03-24T16:45Z,"""Cant find License""

It works but you have to do like this:

1. Install Nexus v1.0.0 somewhere
2. Made a map in the VST folder named Nexus
3. Copy everything and put it to a VST folder for example ...\Fruity Loops 7\Plugins\VST\Nexus
4. Now you install Nexus v.1.0.9
5. Then you only copy the Nexus.dll file (v.1.0.9)
6. Paste it in for example ...\Fruity Loops 7\Plugins\VST\Nexus
7. DONE !! It works fine for me :D"

,krim_reaper,2007-06-11T11:48Z,"to nihads3

Get a music making software like Fruity Loops 7 and this will work in it.



And now my real question. I did as dreamtorrent instructed but it still asks for license. What the hell. :S Any other way around? 

1. Install Nexus v1.0.0 somewhere - CHECK!

2. Made a map in the VST folder named Nexus 

Uhm, to the VstPlugins where I installed nexus or to any VST main folder im using?

3. Copy everything and put it to a VST folder for example ...\Fruity Loops 7\Plugins\VST\Nexus 

Okay, I copied everything I had in VstPlugins (the default directory where you install 1.0.0) and pasted it to magix music maker 2005's VST folder. Yeah, downloading fruity loops. :/


4. Now you install Nexus v.1.0.9 - CHECK!

5. Then you only copy the Nexus.dll file (v.1.0.9)
6. Paste it in for example ...\Fruity Loops 
7\Plugins\VST\Nexus

Okay copied this to magix music maker 2005's VST folder and it asked if i'd want to replace the original (1.0.0) .dll file so I did. First I took a copy out of 1.0.0 dll and pasted it to a safe place just in case.

7. DONE !! It works fine for me :D - FAIL! I can't get it to work. :( Help a fellow artist out here bro!

1-Download Daemon Tools http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php

2-Unrar files one at a time to a folder you made on your desktop, Title this Nexus

3-Open the First file, it contains setup 1.0.0 and 1.0.9, Install 1.0.0 ONLY first to your host programs VST file, which is most likely located in  your Program Files

4-Creat a folder on your desktop, Title this Trash

5-Install 1.0.9 in this, and take the .dll file and paste this into the VST folder you installed 1.0.0 in.

5-go to C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 7\Plugins\VST\Program Files\Nexus and delete the Live Cache Folder

6-Star up FL studio and enjoy!

4-Install 1.0.9 in same folder

To get past licensing issues, you have 3 options, one can be used, they can all be done, but its unnecessary

Easiest at 1, hardest at 3

1. *Not recommended* Never connect to the internet while using FL (Easy, but inconvientit)

2. *Recommended* Delete the Live Cache Folder, Default location C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 7\Plugins\VST\Program Files\Nexus

3. *Really not recommended, use as a last resort* open your Host files location for windows C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc (Windows Vista users: right click notepad and select run as administrator, otherwise you cant save, then manually get to this folder) open the ""hosts"" data in notepad, paste 212.227.83.158 localhost #ReFX Server - Phonehome
at the bottom of the list, save and exit *NOT TESTED BY MYSELF*

I would recommend option 2."

,MaeRosePrizzi,2008-02-07T20:31Z,"Here?s how your Uncle Jim did it:

The download contains some 31 RAR Files and about 31 other files.

You must have Win RAR installed on your machine. You will also need a program such as Magic ISO, Power ISO, Deamon Tools etc, installed. Any app that can ?mount? a virtual copy of a DVD / CD.

Create a new temporary folder somewhere. Eg: Nexus Temp in My Docs on drive C. Copy everything to this folder.

Select all the RAR files, right click and select ?UnRAR here.? 

WinRAR will un-zip a new ISO file. Now go to your mounting app and mount the ISO file. You should now be able to browse your virtual drive.

Go to the Widows or Mac version and install v.1.00 of Nexus.

Make sure that you install the app in your VST folder. Make sure you install the library in a separate folder you?ve created. If you?re serious, you already have a separate physical drive for audio files. Eg D/Nexus Library.

Now the important one:

Install Nexus 1.0.9 to a completely new folder. Anywhere, any name. 

Close everything. Browse to this new folder and copy the 1.0.9 dll.

Surf to your original Nexus VST folder and DELETE the v.1.00 dll.

Paste the new 1.0.9 dll in that folder. No need to delete anything else or fuck with your registry.

That?s all there is to it, space cadets. You can now open and play Nexus from within your VST supporting sequencer.

Enjoy, but remember to buy it if you make any money.

,lowball415,2008-10-19T00:16Z,"mabey explaining why you have to install this a certain way will better help you to install it correctly.

I got this working on my second shot.

When you download the torrent you get 2 .exe files

1 is for nexus 1.00
the other is for nexus 1.09

now if you are getting the licence message it's because the .dll file for 1.00 requires a licence.

this is where 1.09 comes in, it does not need any licence

however, you need to install 1.00 because that is the full program and includes all presets, banks, etc.

then you have to install 1.09 over that in order to replace the 1.00 dll file with the 1.09 dll file

hope this helps

1.00dll needs licence but has all presets, 1.09 needs no licence but has no presets."
,driver76,2008-10-19T14:52Z,"ATT FOR ANYONE HAVING ISSUES. THERES A LOT OF CRAP ON THE MESSAGE BOARD HERE ABOUT THIS PLUGIN. READ THIS< AND YOU WILL HAVE A FULLY WORKING NEXUS..

The most important files you will need for a successfull install is the '0TestTone'. This file is crucial for operation because its the file that all patches reference to. Without it you will still get Nexus to work but it will give constant errors loading sounds and will constantly remind you it cannot find the testtone file.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GO HERE

http://refx.com/?lang=en&page=products/nexus/downloads


Download the NEXUS CONTENT ONLY (which is actually pretty good) The '0TestTone' file is in there. WHne you have downloaded the 1.4gig of content just place it in your documents and settings folder, or where ever else you like. THEN download the 1.4 crack of Nexus from here and install. Launch your DAW/Sequencer and load nexus. At this point it will ask you where the '0TestTone' files is. It will be wherever you copied the 1.4 gig of content you downloaded and should be here inside the following folders>>>>

Presets - Nexus content -Samples - Rom - '0TestTone.nxs' CLICK THE FILE AND NEXUS SHOULDNT EVER ASK FOR THE FILES AGAIN UNLESS YOU DO A NEW INSTALL OR CHANGE THE LOCATION OF YOUR SAMPLES.


DO THAT, and I guarantee it will work.

EXPANSION PACKS: Just about all the ones here are corrupt but for the most part you will be able to use about 80% of all samples. I couldnt get the Piano and Hard style expansions to work regardless of what I did. Sample files can easily be corrupted so if you cant get some sounds or one or two expansion packs to work dont sweat it.

I must also say this is an excellent ROM sample player. Its rather inspiration and lets you get on with creating music rather than tweaking endless knobs.

I like this plugin so much that I will probably buy it when I can afford it. I actually do buy software I like so this is looking like a contender for a purchase. It may not seem it but I do support the software industry, I just do it on my terms.

Good Luc"

,Caffeinationz,2009-02-16T10:03Z,"Here's what I did to get mine working.  But first, make sure you have winrar or some unzipping program and a mounting program such as poweriso or daemon tools.  Then...

1.  Create a new folder anywhere, then drag and drop all files in your new folder.
2.  Highlight every single .rar file and unzip them ""to here""
3.  A iso file named refxnex should appear.  Double click it and a few folders should appear.
4.  Click on I think the 2 or 3rd folder which contains 2 .exe files.  Click on the first one (the 1.0.0 one).  Click the open direct option and install it to your music program's vst folder.  After u install it, at the end it will say something about the nexus content not being downloaded or something... just click ignore.
5.  Back to the iso, you should see the folder named ""nexus content,"" drag and drop that file into the nexus folder that you downloaded to your vst folder.
6.  Create another new folder anywhere.  Then go back to the iso and install the 1.0.9.exe to the new folder.
7.  search for the 1.0.9.dll file and drag and drop it to your original 1.0.0 nexus file which contains the 1.0.0.dll and overwrite it.
8.  Go to fruityloops and click on channels>add one>nexux.  Now nexus should be in channels.
9.  Click on Nexus and it will say some 0test0 file will be missing and will say say ""look for it manually"" just click on ok.  Then go back to program files>image-line>fruityloops>plugins>vst>nexus>nexus content>sample>rom>0test0 or whatever will be there.  Double click that and now it should be working.  Well... that's what worked for me.
That worked for me."

,B12CORE,2009-11-13T04:39Z,Beautiful! Seeding.
,Sirogecat,2009-11-20T00:42Z,"Very nice download. Quick speed, and it works perfectly. I will definitely be seeding this.

Here. If you're having trouble getting this to work, follow these directions:

Note1 - This download has a bunch of files in it, including a '.nfo' file, a bunch of split compressed archives (the '.r01', '.r02', etc. files), an '.sfv' file, and an archive in '.rar' format.

Note2 - I'm using Windows Vista Home Basic, so if you aren't using that OS, the instructions might have to be changed slightly. I have no clue how to do this on an Apple OS, so if you use some type of Apple OS, don't bother reading.

HOW TO INSTALL:

1) Make sure not to delete any of the split compressed archive files or the RAR archive. You need all of these. Select the RAR archive and extract/unzip it to a folder somewhere on you hard-drive.

2) Go to the folder that you extracted the file to. In it, you will have an image file (called 'dyn-refxnex.iso'). Mount/burn it using a program such as PowerISO (my choice) or DaemonTools.

3) After mounted/burned, go into the folder called ""Windows Setup"". There are two executable (.exe) files within. Click the one that will install Nexus v1.0.0 first. Install it to your music program's VST Plug-in directory (Example - C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 9\Plugins\VST). Now you will have a new folder in this directory, with another folder in it called ""Nexus"".
What I did, and I believe this is optional, was move the ""Nexus"" folder up on directory, so I wouldn't have to navigate through a maze of folders every time I go in this directory. I then deleted the original folder that was there, leaving only the Nexus folder and any sub-directory within it.

4) Now, go back to the ""Windows Content"" folder. This time, open the executable for Version1.0.9. Install this anywhere you want, it doesn't matter, as long as you don't install it directly in the same directory as the other version. After installed, navigate through that directory until you find the file ""Nexus.dll"". Copy this file and navigate to the Nexus folder in your VST Plug-ins folder. Replace the ""Nexus.dll"" file in that folder with the one you just copied.

From this point on, I have no idea what you're supposed to do, UNLESS you're using FL Studio. If you're using a different music program, you'll have to figure this out on your own. You can try reading these instructions and changing them a bit to see if it'll work for whatever your program is, but I wrote these based on what to do for FL Studio.

5) Open up FL Studio. Go to the menu bar at the top. Navigate to ""Channels > Add one > More..."" and a window will pop up. In this window, scroll down to the heading ""VST Plugins"". Under this heading, look for the title ""Nexus"". Click it to change the box next to it from blank to having an ""F"" in it.

6) Now, go to ""Channel > Add one > Nexus"". You will get a pop up saying that the 0Test0 file is missing. Click okay, and another window will pop up. Navigate to your FL Studio VST Plugins directory, go through nexus and content, then through sample and rom, and then click on the first file in this folder, called ""0TestTone.nxs"". (Default folder directory, for me: C:\Program Files\Image-Line\FL Studio 9\Plugins\VST\Nexus\Content\Samples\Rom) Double-click that file, and you will now have the Nexus Plugin working.

This was a very long post, but I hope I helped those in need.
Thank you Dreamtorrent for uploading this torrent file. It is very nice. Again, I will be seeding."

,Ahavah,2009-11-28T04:31Z,"INSTALL  NEXUS

FOR NEXUS THE IDEA IS TO INSTALL THE SMALLER VERSION EXE FIRST INTO ANY DIRECTORY. HERE I DID FL STUDIO 9 IN THE VST PLUGIN FOLDER.

(IT COULD HAVE BEEN CUBASE TOO BUT READ ON)

DURING INSTALLATION, ANYTIME I EVER HEAR SOMETHING LIKE: THIS FOLDER OR BLA BLA ALREADY  EXIST I FIND A PLACE TO INSTALL THAT WOULD NOT SAY THAT.
WHEN THE INSTALL FINISHES I THEN INSTALL THE NEWER VERSION ALSO IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THIS TIME IN JUST PROGRAM FILES ON YOUR TYPICAL C: DRIVE ALONG SIDE OTHER INSTALLED STUFFS ON YOUR COMPUTER.
SO HERE I SELECTED PROGRAM FILES VST BLA BLA PLUGIN. 
(AS FOR THE CONTENT  I INSTALLED THE CONTENT OF NEXUS AN EXTERNAL DRIVE FOR SPACE AND IT WORKS)

AND HERE IS THE MAIN KEY TO ALL THIS, IS TO TAKE THE DLL FILE YOU WILL FIND THAT COMES WITH NEWER VERSION EXE WHERE EVER YOU INSTALLED  IT AND PLACE IT OVER ANY OTHER PLACE WHERE ANY OLDER DLL FILE WAS. AND THAT?S HOW YOU PATCH OR CRACK IT.
AFTER ALL THIS GUESS WHAT? EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED AS I WAS INSTALLING NEXUS FOR ONLY FL STUDIO 9, I GO TO OPENED CUBASE 5 AND NEXUS IS ALSO WORKING JUST AS IT?S WORKING FL STUDIO 9. AND IT'S VISTA MEN!!
WELL BLESS THE PEOPLE WHO MADE ALL THIS POSSIBLE.
