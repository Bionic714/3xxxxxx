Thanx for answers"
,Metalnight,2007-03-25T01:30Z,"Forgot to say i use Real Player...
Maybe there are a better prog for playing Rmvb"
,Tomatatooe,2007-03-28T05:28Z,"Subs out of sync.  Subs lag by 1 line.  Difficult to follow at times, especially when a long pause between lines."
,tatien,2007-05-29T16:52Z,"I just can't figure out how to play the subtitles on Mac. I've tried the instructions from the FAQ and I've ran searches for over one hour on the web, but there just don't seem to be any way. If someone finds out, please tell."

,Dist_Heart,2008-10-30T16:45Z,Anyone knows where to find swedish subs or fix the lag? Thanks
,PPSTOPPER,2009-04-22T12:19Z,DO YOU HAVE THIS IN AVI?
,noelnyc,2009-04-23T06:19Z,"I saw it in English,in VHS format No one can get it in english NOT sub"
,sushant_rocky,2009-08-18T16:07Z,"great movie...THANKS

eng subs slightly out of place...good ones available in allsubs.

Real Alternative(media player classic) plays rmvb files best."
