[T],Issaquah,2007-03-18T04:44Z,"Awesome, totally awesome program! If you hate CHM files as much as I do, this is the proggy to grab! Virus & malware free! Creates a wonderful PDF file, complete with all indexes and bookmarks - it better for $250 USD!

Thanks for the unique upload."
,JujitsuFreak,2007-06-11T08:06Z,"Very nice program. 

One thing though is that this program only works only folders with names containing no spaces.. which is weird if it is a Windows program. In order to create the .pdf you must first create the project. In the end, it produces very high quality stuff. 

Very satisfied. Thank you."

I am running Win7 x64, and I can confirm that stevieboy420's fix works great. It would not run for me, but after installing MS fix and running in Windows 2000 compatible mode, it works just fine."
