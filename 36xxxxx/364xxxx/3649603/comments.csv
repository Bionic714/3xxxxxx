,Lonewulf,2007-03-31T07:37Z,"Wow... Incredibly dull Islamic guy pretending to know some deep truth, yet he probably lives behind the alley of the cheesy set. Same old islamic garbage, same old outdated stone age philosophies  *yawn*  I've seen more insightful things floating around my toilet .... not worth using bandwidth to download or seed. STAY AWAY"
,QDJMan,2007-03-31T19:38Z,"Wow... Incredibly undetailed comment you left, Lonewulf.  Did you really even watch this video?  From the looks of your comment, it seems you have the ""same old outdated stone age philosophy"" of calling a Muslim guy an ""Islamic guy"".  A follower of Islam is a Muslim, not an Islam or an Islamic person!  It seems that you did not even watch this video, but you are merely the typical anti-Islam type.  Some advice to you would be to stop blindly following the crowd and start thinking for yourself!

Peace"

Seriously?!?   I thought that the whole idea behind any religion was to follow the crowd blindly...

I'm an ateist by birth, but interested and absolutely facinated by religion I really wanted the learn something by this.  But after 15 minutes I realized that I didn't want it that bad.  I even put it aside and tried again later to no avail.

My point beeing; I downloaded it in the hope of actually discovering something interesting.  I guessed it would be about religion, but even religious people show wisdom every now and then.  Nevertheless I hoped it wasn't.

What I'm saying is that there should have been some proper info about this file.  I don't mind that people need to believe, what I do mind is that people like you need to get others to start believing.

The info you did write is very good at intizing curiousity, most people don't know what the meaning of life really is.  I just wish Stephen King would have been around when the bible/koran/any mythologi was written down, that would have created something to talk about.

Don't download if you haven't already read the koran a few times...

:D"
