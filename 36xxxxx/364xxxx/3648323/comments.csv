Thanks seeders, keep up the good work."

,mike18xx,2010-05-09T23:24Z,"This rip is COMPLETE trash -- non-deinterlaced undecimated 29.96fps, and the blocks are the size of pencil-erasers.

Whomever tore this, please jump in front of a moving bus."
,vivatpb5776,2011-03-26T05:02Z,I agree with mike18xx. This version is worse than a previous version I viewed. Very pixelated to the point of being unwatchable.
