,gwod,2010-12-25T04:16Z,"Hi trying to download this torrent but keep getting a message in my utorrent that ""No connection can be made because the host machine actively refused it""!

I am signed in so cannot understand it, can someone please help explain why this should be the case? I have had this with more than 1 torrent but only from Pirate Bay even though others seem to work. I am at a loss.

Thanks in advance. Regards, G."
