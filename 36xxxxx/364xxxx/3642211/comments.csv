I downloaded a couple episodes and could not get them to play. I've got the XVid Codec installed but all the big video players (WM/Divx Player/Winamp) i've got installed are saying they're invalid AVI files. I downloaded the files to my server before downloading them to home, so they are 100% completed files. Perhaps I'm using the wrong codec? anyone else have better luck with getting these to play?"
,senseless06,2008-08-21T00:38Z,"
I was playing with the files i downloaded all night.. This program called 'GSPOT' the analyzes movie files to tell you what codec they use says the files are invalid.

When I was downloading yesterday, i uploaded over 80 gigabytes to fellow peers within a few hours. Could someone please update this thread to let me know if they got the avi files to play or not?"
