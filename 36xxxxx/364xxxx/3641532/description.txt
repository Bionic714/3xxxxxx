Starring Robert Duvall and Donald Pleasence, THX 1138 leads viewers into a
25th-century totalitarian state where citizens are stripped of individuality and
become numbered drones, controlled by a government-enforced program of sedating
drugs. THX 1138 (Duvall) is a factory worker whose life is irrevocably changed
when his roommate, LUH 3417 (Maggie McOmie), causes them both to stop taking
their drugs.   Their sexual feelings begin to awaken and lead to a forbidden
love affair. The state discovers the illegal coupling and drug evasion and
separates THX and LUH. But THX is determined to flee his wall-less prison and
discover LUH's fate. To do so, he must avoid the robotic police force and
unknown dangers of the outside world. Pleasence co-stars as SEN 5241, who makes
the perilous journey with THX.
