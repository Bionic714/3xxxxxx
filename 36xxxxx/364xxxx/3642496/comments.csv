how do I get this to work once installed?"
,ksoktogon,2007-10-02T02:21Z,"Good advice: During installation choose the
'Copy multimedia to the hard drive' option."
,Peregr1n,2008-02-17T23:22Z,"Thanks for seeding this... I'm going round Sweden this summer and although I'm sure most people will speak English, it's frankly embarrassing that everyone in Europe makes an effort except us Brits!
Crackzter is a prime example of why most Americans are dumbasses."

,tipu2185,2008-11-01T11:42Z,Is there any chance to get before you know it delux to learn swedish.
,andreas212,2009-07-09T19:18Z,"Can anyone tell me what to do with these files once ive finished downloading this? My computer skills are decent, but I really have no idea how to install this. I have windows Vista. Can someone give me step by step directions please? thanks"
,Iron_E,2009-12-13T02:24Z,"I'm an example of why people would need to learn Swedish, you fucking twat.

I'm an American and I just made a lifelong move to Sweden to live with my boyfriend.  Sure, he speaks flawless English, but why should I be a fat tub of American hamburger grease and sit around and expect everyone to cater to me just because I'm too lazy to learn the language of their country?  I'm the one coming into Sweden, and they have a right to speak Swedish.  You fucking idiot.  Go back to church.  I hope somebody burns it down."
,Truvbay,2010-01-08T15:11Z,"andreas212: ""My computer skills are decent, but I really have no idea how to install this.""

This my friends, is why America will be a third world country in 50 years. Or less.

He really believes his computer skills are 'decent'. A person that doesn't know what to do with bin/cue files. A person who can't even google for 'bin cue files'.

Instead of just the smallest effort on his part, he instead immediatley comes here for someone to rescue him. He needs step by step instructions. America, land of the ""I need step by step instructions"".

Anyway, the torrent is great. Once you go through the incredibly complicated process of mounting the cue file, it's pretty good. I would suppliment this with a pimsleur or other series, but even on its own it's good.

Thanks for the up! "

,Mr.Nightbird,2010-03-04T09:22Z,"Oh man, don't be so mean, if the guy doesn't know what to do with a bin file why don't you help him? Nobody's gonna cut your hand if you're doing some good."
