,bigsexywzp,2008-08-14T22:37Z,"You know, if you don't want to learn English, no one's forcing you to. Just know that YOU FUCKING TYPED IN ENGLISH Badboy4ever. You cock sucking idiot. And seeing as how English is one of the major languages that people across the GLOBE are learning, I'd say you're stuck with it.

Also, learning another language will not teach you decency, honor, proudness, or dignity. Either you have it or you don't, it's not something you gain or learn. It's instilled in you as you grow, not as you learn. Assholes are assholes, regardless of how many languages they know."
,vinnicius,2008-08-21T04:50Z,Is there anyone seedingyet? Please?
,Vaskes,2008-09-25T13:17Z,"Does the Dutch edition feature the ""Sin-Chroni-City"", ""Audio Commentary with Co-Director Robert Rodriguez, Guest Director Quentin Tarantino and Actor Bruce Willis"" and ""Austin Audience Version"" extras? Because I downloaded a shrinked version of this DVD and it said all extras were included, but these were not and I don't know whether they were stripped or they're just not included in the Dutch edition. Can anyone who has downloaded the torrent please answer me?"
