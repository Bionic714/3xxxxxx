,sam775,2007-03-20T01:47Z,It is no good uploading torrents if you don't seed them.
,the_commenter,2007-03-20T02:00Z,"--Notice--
I have at least 1 computer constantly seeding all of the files i uplaod. The computer are generaly pretty good... at least 512 MB ram, 40GB or more hardrive space and a minimum of 
1.8 Giga-hertz. So for those of you who are not getting any seeds... I think its your computer"
,mafed,2007-03-26T03:07Z,This is not pro
,the_commenter,2007-03-31T05:04Z,"There is a .txt file in the package, open it and get the CD KEY. If you need further help message me."
,the_commenter,2007-04-03T08:18Z,"Notice:
On 4/9/07 I will be deleting all of the .torrent files that are not getting so many hits. I have a computer running full time and its starting to really slow it down! I've just reached over 300GB seeded, I need the bandwidth for something useful, sorry!

The reason the Serial Key in the package didn't work was because the user was a Macintosh user. I am posting a Serial Key now that is for MAC ONLY! If you complain to me about not being able to use it on your PC use the above Serial or the one provided in the package

,Polack,2007-04-12T00:11Z,"you dont need to download this if you already have iTunes, just open quick time, settings and you can just put the key there. But thanks for the serial..."
,postigovich,2007-05-03T06:42Z,"Sorry guys, first time here! how and where can I download the file? where do I need to click?
I do have only ""Download this torrent "" but all I get is a small file ???
Thanks"
,XShadowrunnerX,2007-05-05T23:24Z,"Google-Search yourself ""What is a Torrent"". That small file you're getting is a .torrent file, and you need another program (UTorrent or Azerius or whatever) to get what you're lookin for. The search should point you in the right direction as to what to do ^^"
,space_kitten,2007-06-06T13:45Z,"This is Quick time but it's def not Quicktime Pro !!?
