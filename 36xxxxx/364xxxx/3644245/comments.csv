What album is it?"
,barsalej,2007-06-28T19:36Z,"Looks like most of them, actually! 

1. Bug
2. Dinosaur
3. Fossils
4. Green Mind
5. Hand It Over
6. I Don't Think So
7. Martin And Me
8. What Ever's Cool With Me
9. Where You've Been
10. Without A Sound
11. You Are Living All Over Me

But hey, I am no expert... maybe some enlightened Dinosaur freaks can add some more torrents to complete the list... 

In any case! Cheers! "
