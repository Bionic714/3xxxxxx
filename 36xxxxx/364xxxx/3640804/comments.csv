1, 2, 3, 6 episodes double - trouble !!!"
,Gamle_Erik,2007-07-23T16:23Z,Who encoded this?  Missing episodes are replaced by duplicate of others.  Not so good. 
,Scarysecrets,2007-10-04T14:45Z,"Yea, this season is highly annoying...there are only 5 new episodes, the rest are just duplicates to make it look like 13 episodes! Such a waste of time. "
