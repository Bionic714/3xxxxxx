In Between Evolution is the tenth full-length album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. It was released June 29, 2004.

The album featured the single "Vaccination Scar". This album is considered one of their best later works and became one of the top selling albums of the year in Canada. It also helped to re-establish the band's older musical style. The album was recorded at Studio X in Seattle.

One of the major themes of this album is the response to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with overtly political anti-war themes throughout the album. In the poignant "Are We Family", Gordon Downie questions the logic of "taking care of each other one bullet to another", while "Vaccination Scar" likens the collapse of the rationale of the war to the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.

"Gus: The Polar Bear From Central Park" is a metaphor comparing George W. Bush to the famously depressed polar bear in the Central Park Zoo who is "too either them or me", and speculates that the cause of the problem is that "no one is afraid enough". "Heaven Is a Better Place Today" doubles as a tribute to hockey player Dan Snyder and, as Downie would reveal, for young men being sent to war.

However, aside from this last comment regarding "Heaven..." (which is not cited), much of this analysis is purely speculative.

All songs were written by The Tragically Hip.
