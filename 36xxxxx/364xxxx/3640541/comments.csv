Didn't he also write a book about the Lost Ark?"
,Perditor2,2008-09-15T03:27Z,"These are some pretty cool conversations.  I recommend giving them a listen if you're open minded.

Also, if you do decide to download, PLEASE SEED.  I've seeded this torrent over 65x and and the number of seeders has remained the same since I originally downloaded.  I can understand a hit and run on copyrighted torrents or things that end up sucking, but this stuff is cool and I can't imagine anyone in the recordings getting po'd over it floating around on the internet.

,thors_hammer1,2009-05-04T16:29Z,"i have downloaded and now seeding.
For anyone who decides to download:i am not hooked to net 24 hrs but i try as much time as i could so new downloaders please have patience.

,chaosheritage,2010-05-11T00:33Z,"Im seeding this torrent permanently, this information must be circulated and listened to.  I have to reinstall my system sometimes and if you need a seed then email me at vip_asylum@yahoo.co.uk 

I cannot recommed this highly enough, I feel it is an obligation for everyone to listen and pay close attention to the content.  You will find nothing more real and to the bone than what is in these audio files."
,chaosheritage,2011-02-19T23:06Z,"Incidentally, if you do email me just let me know you got this address from here.  I am partial to forgetting I put it here."
