,lena9126,2007-11-18T15:02Z,"I love the movie, but i have a probleme .
The movie is made as iso files .
So i wonder, how do i open a iso file .
In what program ?

Thnx"
,Ubehage,2007-11-18T17:01Z,"You open ISO-files by burning them to a DVD :)
The ISO-file is an exact copy of the disc."
,Dayana,2007-12-07T16:30Z,"Hi!

I´ve been looking for this for a long time, so thanks for providing it!
But I have a problem: I now have the 3 iso disc images - but my burning program (Roxio) refuses to burn them! I always get the message ""This is not a valid file. Choose a different one.""
What do I do now???"
,florinus,2008-01-19T17:41Z,any chance for english subs on dvd? or closed caption (english). 
,thematrixexpert,2008-01-20T16:59Z,many thanks
,Voxi,2008-03-06T16:36Z,"This one has some commentary by the actors in the episodes.  it's really annoying, just a heads up."
,ofr5555,2008-05-12T22:36Z,Download Poweriso and it will extract the ts_audio and ts_video folders with the vob files in them. It works just like winzip and winrar.
,krissielicious,2008-06-04T13:52Z,i burned the disc 1 but it wont work.. disc 2 and 3 works perfectly ... any ideas on how i can make it work? i really want to watch it ive been looking for this series for a long time thanks..

,majca,2009-12-08T17:45Z,"Do you need to burn this to disc, or could I use something like daemon tools?"
,jaguuar,2009-12-09T13:02Z,thanks for the upload. Please seed
,majca,2009-12-10T02:11Z,"Downloaded and answered my own question - yes, it works with daemon tools.  Don't know if it'd work with a different mounting program, though it probably would."
