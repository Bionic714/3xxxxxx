,bumslang,2007-03-27T10:59Z,"can't compare poetry with music ya creep!
"
,Entire,2007-03-27T12:51Z,"Hmmmm... You say they have been around as a rap group since 1996? Prodigy that makes ""techno"" gave out the first studio album in 1992."
,paco79,2007-03-27T14:21Z,"The Prodigy is (was) a group, only one bandmember left. Prodigy (without the ""The"" infront of it) is a rapper. If their any good you be the judge. Title says Prodigy and Rap...read it..."
,sotamarsu,2007-03-28T08:39Z,"CreepNCrawl, 
The Prodigy (better one) has been around since 1991.
You fail."
,alpha2000,2007-03-30T00:48Z,"creepncrawl you prick you obviously dont know your music very well because techno was out well before 1996. It was originally started around the same time as house in the us in the mid 2 late 80's you fucking knob! In future keep your gob shut unless you know what your talking about. Oh btw prodigy where around in 1991 with the album ""the prodigy experiance'  what music do you think they were doing then? Rap!!! I dont think so you idiot."
,colml,2007-04-01T03:46Z,"prodigy, my ass!!! what a rip off!!!"
,Lugubrizione,2007-04-02T02:15Z,"This is an American rapper, not the UK kickass badguy technoheads. Read the title and it says Rap... 

I thought it was mislabeled and got very disapointed, but I do NOT blame the guy who shared it with us. Nothing wrong with his release.

Chill, dudez... :P"
,CreepNCrawl,2007-04-02T13:26Z,"this is all for you people that listen to techno

,Porrfarfar,2007-04-03T15:41Z,"Ow, its the techno vs Hip Hop discussion... soooo cute."
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-04-04T13:00Z,"I don't know what's funnier, the badly spent ignorant bullshit coming from creepncrawl, or the fact people are bothering to argue with a 12yr old remedial student like him."
,steviefar,2007-04-06T15:11Z,"have you people got nthing better to do than have sissy fights with faceless people over the web, i bet you wouldnt be so clever face to face,

,Quirky_Puppy,2007-04-07T13:52Z,"@steviefar

Rich, coming from someone who took the time to make that comment. :P"
,NinjaManiac1515,2007-04-07T15:12Z,"haha...techo vs rap
ok people here is the final verdict....

most rap artists beats are electronic...thats not skill
most of em dont rite der own lyrics
they r fuckin stupid
they want money for fuckin everything
their rhymes as u say r ''whack''

now for techo

fucking annoying noises
screetching shit
a fucking monkey can  make a beat
its the sound of death if u have a head ache


eventhough i said all that...i like a little of both...eg.. ludacris and ATB

neither win...becos  in respect for both...

THEY SUCK  :)"
,BBRWilson,2007-04-07T19:18Z,"ATB Suck big time. Ludacris is piss-poor.
Wonder who makes more money..?
What is this all about anyway..
Initial dude's ignorance for not knowing which Prodigy would be releasing an album entitled ""Return of The MAC""..
Or next dude's ignorance for not knowing that one of Prodigy's latest efforts was completely produced on Reason 3.0, a MIDI sequencer, i.e. electronic.
You lot suck.

This torrent however, though understandable, really emphasises what a great album Infamous was..and more importantly, shows what a classic combo his ""crack indulging"", ""body-bagging"" lyrics are over Alchemist's production. 

The two blend well on several tracks, i really recommend this for anyone who actually thought Mobb Deep were seomthing once. Before the gay mixtape thing. Before 50 Pence signed them. Before Tru Life. Ah, before.

Gd upload. 

Wack Debate."
,hookeyed,2007-04-08T07:49Z,this is so intense i need to download this torrent...
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-04-08T11:56Z,"To be honest, I don't like rap, and I love ""The prodigy"" but I don't think either form of music is better, only different. For different people with different taste.

Retards like Creepncrawl irritate me with their pretentious, uninformed ""mines better than yours"" attitude."
,CreepNCrawl,2007-04-12T17:45Z,"everyone gets mad at me

 i had to lay down the facts


people couldnt handle the truth so they decide to make fun of me


ill drop this BS argument, but i did feel compelled to say somthihng
to that bossman prick"
,gturban,2007-04-26T23:28Z,"Whoww what an argument.... strange that you all yell so loudly, you shouldn't been born, since your mum is so fat that only a rhino would find her attractive!! Skinny guy is a good dancer CreepnCrawl, is it your brother and you ate all his food?"
,alwane,2007-08-31T12:42Z,"bande de naze c du hip-hop, d'allieur c ecrit RAP, les illettres qui se sentent flouer n'ont qu'a retourner sur les bancs, de l'école ou dans le park et fermer leur gueule, sachez néamoins pour votre information que toutes ses musiques, rap comme techno sont issu du meme moule, LA RUE, créée par de AFRO AMERICAIN, que ce soit en 70,80,90. jvois pas c ke ça change c pa un concour, c pa ça la musique.Alors les facho communiste, comme un certain nombre d'entre vous devrait soit écouté des chants Grégorien, Celte et autre, soit retourner dans leur squat de toxico, de tete rasé, tatouer, croix gammé....sinon y'a aussi le respect......PEACE"
,c0mplex,2007-10-10T21:06Z,"Oh so this is the rapper from mob deep, not Techno... This is the one that was a ballet Dancer right? I thought that getting out would have ruined his career by now. I agree with the Brits on this one.  This guy IS lame and I bet the UK Prodigy could kick this too-too wearing, ballet dancing, tipy-toeing faggot's ass! hahahahaha

Any one know if the UK Prodigy is coming out with anything soon? "
