,Cleansation,2007-03-26T20:50Z,For most people including me it does but for some people it doesn't seem to work.
,RuneF,2007-03-27T06:56Z,i found a trojan in this :(
,Cleansation,2007-03-27T08:57Z,Heh wow there is no trojan or damaging code in this crack at all.... ^^
,ladede,2007-03-27T12:38Z,my crack dosent work for me it says that i must pot in the orginal cd:S.. and the crack is a dvd movie format:S do you need a program or something?
,Cleansation,2007-03-27T14:14Z,"Dvd movie format ? You must be retarded, you know you have to unzip the damm file right ? Google it."
,piraten12345,2007-03-27T14:18Z,"Ladede - If it says that you must insert the original disc. then try run yasu v 1.1 (it works with the newest Deamon tools and alcohol 120)
you can find yasu on deamon tools homepage"
,barabusignasius,2007-03-27T19:58Z,"Mine was in dvd format also, and i am not retarded.
Inside the rar file is a folder named fairlight which has a folder named retailexe. which has a folder called 1.1 which has a dvd movie file. Ive downloaded it twice to be sure"
,barabusignasius,2007-03-27T21:02Z,"There is a mini image available @ gamecopyworld
wont know if it works for a few hours.  Fairlights crack is also there but when i extracted i got the same movie file. weird."

,BeadedVenus,2007-04-07T05:46Z,"This just doesn't work for me. When I run autorun.exe I get a window with a black box and ""MISSING TEXT"". When I run cnc3kane.msi and it goes though normally until after the License Agreement, then a command box appears and disappears and then it says that the installation was interrupted before it could install.

What am I doing wrong? It's probably very obvious."
