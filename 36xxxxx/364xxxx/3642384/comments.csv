You should need a KeyCD after upgrading, if you are upgrading a MK.III BMW Navigation computer running V.15 to V.17 software version. Higher than V.17 shouldn't need this CD. See my other torrents for different KeyCD images for different software. Record the KeyCD at low speed 2XA as the Navigator might not read other formats for the KeyCD."
