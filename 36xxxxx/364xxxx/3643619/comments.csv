,braesl,2007-12-04T19:25Z,"the lectures are very comprehensive, touching upon so many aspects of chinese history... he knows his stuff. one warning though, his tones when pronouncing chinese names are all over the place. he might not actually speak chinese; it might be knit picking but be careful emulating how he pronounces any names in this series.

Bullshit. All of it.

""pry open China to the avarice of the West"" -- Translation: Evade emperor edicts prohibiting trade, and introduce China to the industrial revolution and the 20th century.

""making millions of Chinese into addicts"" -- Translation: the communist's excuse for decrying free trade with the West.

""the Opium Wars"" -- A War on Drugs (apparently only bad if a George Bush is involved).

""profound humiliation for China"" -- China is profoundly humiliated for having been a great civilization of antiquity, but which had declined into mediocrity while the West was advancing economically and technologically. Scapegoats needed!"

What are you talking about? It is totally amazing to see how practically the entire western world, even so-called smart people, are uncritically swallowing the (US) propaganda against China that is flooding the media. Propaganda pounded against a nation that has peacefully minded its own business for centuries, by other self-righteous nations in the west like the US and the UK which have spent the last few hundred years systematically destroying practically all original cultures on the planet. 

The Opium Wars are but the top of the iceberg of the immense abuse of the western world against asia. And now China is being demonized for Tibet, with nobody telling you that since long Tibet has been a politically strategic territory fought over by several countries, including Britain. The ""Free Tibet"" slogans are just the same old empty propaganda tools stirring up the emotions of people for promoting hidden political agendas by the CIA and others. 

Be wise folks, and don't swallow this one without double checking the facts. If you get angry at me now, then ask yourself why. Someone wants you to."
