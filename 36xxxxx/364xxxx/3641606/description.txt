Jack Good was the first real producer of rock n roll-shows for television, shows like ?Oboy!? , ?Around the Beatles?. He also produced the play about Elvis Presley with PJ Proby starring (until he got fired for improvising). Jack Good once wrote about  Proby:

-Proby can not only sing the pants of anyone else in the world, he even sing the pants off himself.

Here are three american TV-shows from 1965, which show Proby in seven appearances. Shindig from June 16th, Shivaree from July 17th and Shivaree from September 18th. 

Other artists include Everly Brothers, Gerry and the Pacemakers, The Temptations and the Supremes.
