,asmodyus,2007-03-29T20:35Z,"Aslo looking for the Autocad Architecture 2008 64bit 
anybody got it yet"
,glase,2007-04-15T09:36Z,"Could someone else dl this from atomico.sytes.net and then upload it here? My bandwith is so poor that it would take weeks to upload it.
Quick instructions: download, rename iso to AutoDesk.AutoCAD.Architecture.2008.DVD.iso and disable everything else from this torrent."
,glase,2007-04-16T11:33Z,"MD5 of the iso file:
2D78FACD6050678106EDCA8E787138E3
and size 2 285 010 944 bytes"
,snusman,2007-04-17T21:00Z,"Thanx for upload!!!!

Please seed...stuck at 99.9 % :P

Thanx!!!"
,glase,2007-04-18T07:55Z,"I think you already got the whole packege. Try to calculate first MD5 of the iso using e.g:
http://www.fastsum.com/download/fsum.zip
I think the last 512 bytes are from that avi -file which I don't have and don't know where to even find."
,dowlod,2007-04-23T15:59Z,"Someone seed please. I have 98,5% of this file. "
,mikey24p,2007-04-23T22:28Z,please seed. stuck at 98%
,glase,2007-04-24T07:33Z,Did you already check the MD5 sum of the iso file ?
,dowlod,2007-04-24T17:20Z,"My file stops on 98,5% - Using the FSUM I got  output file says: 2,13GB. But I can´t open it. What program do I need to open it ? I have tried PowerISO. Please Help!!"
,glase,2007-04-25T10:43Z,"OK, then you won't be able to download it from here. As the avi file is missing, I don't know how to upload the final part (512 bytes) of the iso -file. Well don't know even which part is missing as I have the whole file but uTorrent says that I have 99.9%.
Perhaps if someone could try to calculate the MD5 check sums of some file parts, I could upload only the missing part.
- download rar containing the calculator from: http://www.yourfilelink.com/get.php?fid=320400
- check that the file size of the iso is exactly 2 285 010 944 bytes by using the DOS prompt or file properties (make sure it is written in bytes not KB/GB)
- then using given tool calculate the following sums:
MD5p AutoDesk....iso 0 1048576
1bb2c4321f0f60465f0c5c205a90509b
MD5p AutoDesk....iso 0 536870912

- report which part was wrong"
,dowlod,2007-04-26T12:16Z,Does anyone have this program 100% ? I need it
,glase,2007-04-26T13:29Z,"Yes, I have it. But it's quite hard to know which part is missing if nobody gives any info.

dowlod: Did you try the file link which I sended to you earlier (check your messages) ? I mean did it work or not ?"
,dowlod,2007-04-26T15:03Z,"I have tried it, but I can´t open the file. I tried PowerISO.  Do I need something else to open the files ? Is it possible to upload the file again ?"
,glase,2007-04-26T16:11Z,"I have tried to upload it several times but the problem is that I have the correct file but other people won't get all parts correctly. My copy opens correctly using PowerIso and WinRar.
But as I wrote before, if you give me info which part is wrong, I will upload the missing part. The checksums of diffent parts and tool to calculete them were given earlier."
,glase,2007-04-26T18:21Z,"Here is a link to another tool that will change some parts from the begining of the iso file: http://www.yourfilelink.com/get.php?fid=320438
Please give some info if it corrects the problem or not."
,thatkindasucks,2007-04-27T05:53Z,"After patching (a window popped up for split second...that was it...so i'm not sure if it actually patched the file)

I ran fsum and it said:
blablabla.partia...

DCDA57DE7B4B9AB51A0895EE7B4C55BC
Calculation summary:
Proceded 1 file in 0 folder with total size 2.16 Gb

Elapsed time...blabla

surprisingly it said 2.16 Gb, though when i tried to open it with IsoBuster...the files opened but the installer gave an error so did every .exe file either saying contact the vendor or there was an error...so i presume my file is still incomplete, and my guess was right...cause i opened it in shareaza and it still says. 98.50% at 2.128 Gb

...any help? "
,thatkindasucks,2007-04-27T06:10Z,"something else I thought...
if this doesn't work out then this other torrent should work well, since it has more than a single seeder.
http://isohunt.com/download/18055477/architecture
its 1.62 Gb...about 500 Mb less than this one(if the .avi file in this torrent is 500 Mb then u don't really need it i guess...in which case that other torrent is probably the next best option for us who are stuck at 98.5)"
,glase,2007-04-27T08:20Z,"Did you follow the instructions provided in the archive ? The program runs on dos prompt and gives the info there, so all errors can be viewed from the dos screen. If you prefer not to use the prompt, write following two lines to patch.bat file:
patcher
pause
(remember to add a linebreak after the last word ""pause"")"
,glase,2007-04-27T10:08Z,"I did some testing and downloaded the whole package (excluding the avi) from here using uTorrent. After all available pieces were downloaded, uTorrent says that 512kB left to download (99.9% done). I stopped the torrent and run the MD5 calculator and got for whole file:
297522ED16E1F4A5A26CD82A7D48D047
and for the first megabyte (0 1048576):
9dab5351f647ba72f7d1da82c6d105df

As you can see, the sum is same as dowlod got earlier. Then I run the patcher and got MD5 for the whole file:
2D78FACD6050678106EDCA8E787138E3
and for the first megabyte (0 1048576):
1bb2c4321f0f60465f0c5c205a90509b

So now I'm sure that the problem is in first megabyte and the patcher really works :)
http://www.yourfilelink.com/get.php?fid=320438
If you are using other torrent clients, I don't know if the patcher helps at all. It's propably easier to switch to uTorrent.
It's however easier to download the package from somewhere else than here (using thatkindasucks's provided link)."
,glase,2007-04-27T11:52Z,"Here's link to instructions on how to switch to uTorrent if the checksum is incorrect (other than 297522ED16E1F4A5A26CD82A7D48D047 before patching or 2D78FACD6050678106EDCA8E787138E3 after patching):
http://www.yourfilelink.com/get.php?fid=321122
The instructions are for those who have downloaded nearly all but don't want to download the whole package again."
,thatkindasucks,2007-04-27T16:10Z,"Didn't work out for me. It might work out for others. I tried, I'm just goin to switch to the other torrent...thanks for the help though

but just to double check...was the .avi file actually 500 Mb or does this torrent have some more files and addons than the other one? any idea...otherwise help was appreciated. "
,glase,2007-04-29T18:51Z,This is same as on other sites - this torrent is unpacked version. The packed version is about 500 MB smaller.
,dowlod,2007-05-02T08:01Z,"I installed the program but when I start the program I got a message that says:

FATAL ERROR: Unhandled c000000dh Exception at 781477a9h

Someone who now what this mean ?"
,glase,2007-05-02T12:02Z,"Probably because of your os. I'm using XP sp2 (us version) without any problems.
Try to run using admin rights. If that doesn't work, you will have wait for next service pack for Architecture."

,SirScrape,2007-05-24T00:45Z,Just a guess but the 1st file of this torrent is an Avi of 32 megs and thats not available. did you look and see if the Iso is in the folder?
,coldhaxxor,2007-05-24T17:13Z,"SEED THIS SHIT FFS !!    

i've downloading it in many houres and it doesn't MOVE !!!  

My english is not so good ;)"
,glase,2007-05-24T22:11Z,"Yes, the avi is unavailable as the original seeder does not want to seed. If you want avis, it is easier to look them from video or porn section of tpb.

,kilomonk,2007-07-08T06:34Z,"I checked this out - it was uploaded by so-king.com  They sell discount (china style) software. $85 for this via Western Union. Forget the .avi file. I think maybe uploader doesn't want us to have the missing 0.1% of the .iso file. I've been seeding this forever and finally, the whole planet has 98.5% of all - and 99.1% of the .iso (2,231,456 KB) "

The .iso is the same file as

1 start downloading http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3791145

2 stop the torrent.

3 replace ACD-A2008.iso with AutoDesk.AutoCAD.Architecture.2008.DVD.iso renamed to ACD-A2008.iso

5 start the torrent

I am from Greece, working on a program that works with the Autocad. The version I have is for 2004. I wanted to ask if they'll be easy to send you the 2008 version and if you could help me with your knowledge to crack the program. If you have any doubt about who I am, the website of the company that sell it is www.art-cad.gr but the bad news is that you can not download a trial version like in Autocad, if you could find a solution I will be grateful. I wish you the best for the new year!"
