,labblue,2007-05-08T03:23Z,"What format are these files in? 

Nothing is listed and they do not open on my pc or mac under any common extension I've tried (zip, rar, iso, dmg, exe, etc)"
,totomi,2008-03-25T17:42Z,"Mac Os 9 is not dead yet

there is 2 files in this torrents :
the installer & the serialiser"
,totomi,2008-03-25T17:43Z,No Compression
,Antonio_Martins,2008-05-26T03:05Z,I've downloaded the files and they don't open. Must I open this torrent running Mac OS9. I don't have a bitTorrent aplication for OS9. What can I do? Thank's for any help!!
,goliano,2008-06-15T18:22Z,"Double-clicking these files does nothing.  

I downloaded the files on a pc and transferred them to a mac, running OS 9.2, using a flash drive.  Both show up as PC files.  How do I install this?"
,ParcoFolgorai,2009-01-06T06:54Z,"from what i can tell its some kind of archive format, but i can't be sure what kind yet.."
,michaelrwatson,2009-04-25T02:57Z,"Try Stuffit Expander. But you MUST expand the files on a Mac, not Windows. Toast 5.2.3 works in OS X as well as OS 9...not sure about ver. 5.2. 

Btw, the version of 5.2 i have is only about 5 MB, so be careful--this one is 10x that for some reason. If these are not archived, i.e. is the actual executable, then it *must* be *downloaded* on a Mac, not under Windows."
,michaelrwatson,2009-05-01T06:48Z,"Um, i don't know WTF this is. Dnloaded and it does NOT appear to be a Stuffit archive. Apparently it's the actual executable (installer), meaning the uploader is a real fucktard. No one but a moron uploads non-archives where software is concerned."
,Graeme43,2011-02-27T14:49Z,Anyone figured out how to use this yet?
