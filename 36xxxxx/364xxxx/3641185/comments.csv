,Shedding,2007-03-18T08:22Z,"It's a secret.. but in all seriousness.. wow man.. You took the time to compile this whole thing?  Kudos to you bud.  by the way.. Since soo many people are looking at this video ""The secret"" doesn't that make it.. uhh..Mm.. not a secret?"
,NocFeD,2007-03-18T11:21Z,"Are you kidding me ? oprah??? bahahha please dont seed this crap. you will only inspire more ""free choice by examples of others stupidity"" .. let this die"
,Judas4ever,2007-03-19T06:27Z,This movie has one agenda to spread a crap dumbass message . Dont dl its really a big waste of time.
,Shedding,2007-03-19T18:20Z,"I am starting to believe that the secret sounds like cultish bullshit.  If everyone could be rich, they would be.  Try to explain that one to a 40 year old working in mcdonalds."
,loanwrangler,2007-03-23T07:30Z,"did you even try to understand what was being said in this movie??

Not everyone wants to be a millionaire, not everyone wants to have all life's luxuries...  Too many people are stuck in the mindset that they can't have something...and therefore they won't.

Negative thought gains negative results.  You slip on the ice because you try so hard not to...you hit your thumb with the hammer cause you keep thinking you shouldn't hit it.

Every amazing discovery that we all hold dear to our hearts was at one time ridiculed by the nay-sayers.  Hopefully this will catch on quick enough to actually make a difference..."

,danny_g,2007-06-13T19:12Z,The fact that some 40 year old is working at MacDonalds is because all he does is think about what a crap job he has. So guess what. He keeps on having a crappy job. You people just dont get how it works do you. Try watching it again and really watch it.
,danny_g,2007-06-13T19:14Z,"And as for Hewlett and Judas4ever. Who the hell are you speaking for. I've noticed that you have posted on just about every torrent of The Secret. Are you the voice of public safety and control? My old man said that if you havent got anything good to say, keep your fuckin trap shut. Take the advice"
,teddan0,2007-07-07T23:50Z,"""Changing your thinking changes nothing out there, in the vast universe surrounding you. It changes something inside of you. Changing your perception, your focus, your emotions and your thinking from negative to positive (from what you lack to what you want) has an enormous effect on your motivation, energy and creativity and that?s why you will then be more efficient working towards your goals. It?s that simple.""

,jimjesus,2008-08-03T23:58Z,"Utter garbage. Having a positive mind set is always beneficial but this is downright bullshit and in some respects harmful because anything that does go wrong is always ""your fault."" This is the kind of mind set that cults use to keep their practitioners in a state of fear and willing to succumb to obedience.

STAY AWAY! It's not even worth pirating."
,ohmmeters,2012-01-24T00:58Z,"This is really good knowledge,
It IS the truth and I've learned a little bit about it on my own even before hearing about this movie.

If you really want to change your life see it.. the law of attraction applies to EVERYONE.

Peace and Love !"
