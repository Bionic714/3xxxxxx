Phantom Power is the seventh full-length album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. The album was released in 1998.

Though well-received, like all their albums, it is not generally considered their best work, despite the popularity of songs such as "Poets" and "Bobcaygeon". It was also released in the United States, but they continued to have little success there, despite their appearance on Saturday Night Live, unlike fellow Canadians Barenaked Ladies whose album Stunt made them enormously popular in the US that same year.

The song "Escape Is at Hand for the Travellin' Man" is a tribute to Jim Ellison of Material Issue.

All songs were written by The Tragically Hip.
