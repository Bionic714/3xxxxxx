Breath of Fire is an RPG series by Capcom.

Each game is set on the same world, merely after the previous one. As such, there are many changes from game to game, although there are certain recurring themes and character names. This is in similar tradition to the discontinuity between games of the Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Wild Arms, and other Japanese RPG series.

There are four games in the series:

    * Breath of Fire 
    * Breath of Fire II
    * Breath of Fire III
    * Breath of Fire IV
