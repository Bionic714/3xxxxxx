!!! For Symbian S60 and UIQ only.  Still no crack available -- only for those who have Garmin GPS10 or GPS10x only. !!!

Unrar and copy all files to SD Card, plug in to your symbian phone and it will install itself.  Include many languages which you can delete unwanted language (help & voice files) to save space later.

Copy your basemap and gampsupp.img to garmin directory and SD card.  I include Basemap and Metroguide NA v7 (routable - California only) for sample.  Metroguide map is not lock and with the help here (www.geodude.nl) you can create your own NA or Europe routable gmapsupp.img

Rename mgv7-california-gmapsupp.img to "gmapsupp.img" and copy to sd card\garmin directory for testing.

If you already have gmapsupp and gmapbmap, no need to download those 2 files.
