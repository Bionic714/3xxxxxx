,KJohn47,2007-10-28T20:56Z,"You do realize that this is volume 4. Volume 5 isn't going to be out until Dec 07 or Jan 08 depending on them. Also, Vol 5 could be the last ATHF DVD b/c Roy (voice actor of Frylock) quit."
,KJohn47,2007-10-28T21:07Z,Mistake: Carey Means is Frylock's actor. I'm thinking Space Ghost Baffler Meal Frylock
,Hojew,2007-12-20T10:59Z,"Was this made of official digital downloads, or just the fanmade releases that have been online for a while now?  What's the menu like?  The official release of this DVD isn't until January 29, 2008 according to sites like Amazon.  Do the digital downloads contain any sort of commentary track or other extras?  I think I'd rather wait for January to get all the little features."

It's like ripping an MP3 and then converting back to wav. Then someone else will re-rip your new DVD to AVI. And the quality continues to drop.

This whole idea is an oxymoron. What a stupid torrent. You never fake upgrade."
