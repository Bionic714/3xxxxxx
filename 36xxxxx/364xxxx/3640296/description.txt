   Dead Again is Type O Negative's seventh studio album, and after a four year
   lapse between releases, a much-anticipated return to the sonic bombast that
   the Brooklyn-based band is famous for. Clocking in at over 77 minutes, Dead
   Again is a 10-song musical journey through the darkest depths of the human
   condition. Love, loss, insanity, morality, mayhem, your secret dreams and
   worst nightmares are all included in the Type O Negative formula created by
   the self-taught professor of emotional chemistry, Peter Steele. Recorded and
   Produced by Steele and keyboardist Josh Silver, the sound of darkness is
   prophetic, the rock is hard and the screams are real. In the words of Grigori
   "The Mad Monk" Rasputin, whom the Russian nobility unsuccessfully attempted
   to kill on numerous occasions for his influence on the last family of Czars,
   "When the bell tolls three times, it will announce that I have been
   killed...Pray Czar of Russia. Pray."

   With past gold and platinum albums under their belts, the bells have
   definitely not tolled for Type O Negative. Reaffirmed and resolute, they
   bring you news from a darker place, a place of infinitely organized chaos
   where the living cannot be swayed from their infinite circle of creation and
   destruction. We are born, we live, we fuck it all up, we strive to forgive
   and be forgiven, and we are reborn. Type O Negative are on the brink of a
   rebirth. But first they are Dead Again!
