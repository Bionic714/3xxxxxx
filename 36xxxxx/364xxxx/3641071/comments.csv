,jo48,2007-03-20T03:16Z,Me again downloaded the whole file....ta
,wollepyk,2007-03-22T22:15Z,"Ahh, finally! I was afraid you were letting us down. Thanks (also for the no-spoilers:-). I will seed."
,surface99,2007-03-23T15:50Z,"hey there, i love this show...thank you very much.

would be nice if you guys also help to seed season 1"
,Xenn99,2007-03-24T02:33Z,"Damn people are making it hard for me, been seeding for days, got a ratio of 7 and still im seeding all alone..   Just please help me i'm upping this for all of you right :P Help me seed.."
,mrxyzabc,2007-04-03T02:50Z,"i downloaded part of this thinking to test out the quality compared to the Mysterious Ways rips that was already out there

to my surprise they were the exact same files that i saw posted over a year ago on emule ripped by SZeKELYUDVARHELY
ed2k://|file|Mysterious_Ways.2x01.Phoenix.PDTV.XviD-SZeKELYUDVARHELY.avi|367048704|12D29C889E2498621A3CB73C4894022D|/

if i was to download season 1, would i find that they match the files ripped by FoV or KOLOZSVaR?

for future, please leave the riiper tags so that other people know if they have a copy of it or not.

unless you were trying to take credit fo something you didnt rip?

thanks

PS they are xvid NOT DIVX"
,trickyniki,2007-04-06T15:38Z,"Hi Peeps,

I am getting an error: files missing from the season 2 download.  I am a newbie, anyone got any ideas - I will  DIE without decent tv shows over here in Paris!!!!!

Ta Tricky"
,wollepyk,2007-04-08T04:47Z,"Trickynicky, dunno what the problem is. I'm seeding the full download - wish some of the other 21 guys would too. Jo48 got it in a couple of days, I took more than a week - guess powerseeding just isn't a good idea, when people drop in at a much slower rate than with the average 0-day cap."
,wollepyk,2007-04-08T04:55Z,"mrxyzabc (if you say it backwards, do you vanish into the 5th dimension?:-)

Dunno if this is the SZeKELYUDVARHELY version or the FoV one - another series, Odyssey 5, turned out to be apparently identical in the full season torrent here with the single eps uploaded by NisseP - except for the first block. Probably some header info got edited.

Is there a difference? I understand some eps had a couple of minutes extra?

Anyway, Xenn99 clearly told us in the comments for the final eps of S1 that he was getting the S2 eps from eMule, so no credit-hogging, implicit or otherwise.

Maybe adding sfv files in the torrents would be an idea to quickly compare eps without fully downloading them."
,jo48,2007-04-08T15:45Z,"Yes I guess that there are some people who won't seed after they get the whole file. This is an open site and seeding is only if you keep to the spirit of sharing. I joined a few private sites that force ratios which I guess is a good idea. Perhaps there are some who have reached 1.0 when they do get the whole file and figure let the other guy share....LOL .I'm coming up on a 3.0 share myself,which is fair....8"
,azazriel,2008-05-25T12:09Z,"Does anyone know if there's a Season 1 torrent anywhere for this show?

I have looked around both on TPB and did some rudimentary googling, but haven't come up with anything.

The wife loves the show and there isn't a station around that we can get that has shown/is showing:

1) the episodes in order

2) all the episodes

Any help finding a Season 1 torrent would be most gratefully appreciated.

Thanks!"

,zen-TAO,2008-06-19T13:02Z,"Thank U for this and season one!
BUT: I still need english subs!"
,donarlove,2009-01-24T22:14Z,"THANK YOU! Is there anyone that also can seed season one again?
Thanks!"
,Xenn99,2009-08-05T16:49Z,"I'm reseeding the Torrents for both seasons, PLEASE keep seeding them..

i already upped the season 2 torrent 15 times last week and still there are only 4 seeders at this moment :(

We need your support to keep this rare serie online!

Thanks!
