,Snake_f,2007-03-31T00:06Z,"wierd, cos it works on my psp 3.03 OE-c"
,Colordeath,2007-04-13T03:43Z,"Doesn't work, atleast not for 3.10 OE-A' (I even have the ' update)"
,Seldinhio,2007-04-13T18:27Z,Do's it work om a psx?
,toyzombie,2007-04-16T23:58Z,It will also not work with Firmware 3.30. It says that you have to first register the game... what ever that means....
,frijolito,2007-04-22T21:26Z,"To the guys who haven't gotten it to work in 3.10: have you tried playing with the settings in the recovery console? (you know, the one you access by pressing 'R' when turning the PSP on)

You could try changing the CPU speed for example. Please let the rest of us know if you get it to work ok? And one more thing: why is this file smaller than 30 megs? Is it really complete?"
,Snake_f,2007-04-22T22:53Z,"its complete game,
1. the game is basically small
2. some crappy sound is ripped away to save space"

,Ragarok,2008-03-01T23:00Z,"works great. I""m using cfw 3.80 m33-4 with popsloader"
