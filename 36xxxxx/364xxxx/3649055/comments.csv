I clicked on ""Download This Torrent"" and it went to my desktop, but then the computer said ""There was an error in opening this movie."" So would anyone be kind enough to give me a step-by-step description of how to do it. Or at the least the bare basics. It would be greatly appreciated, and I promise I'll find someway to thank you. Thanks in advance!"

Just search for bitcomet on google and u'll find it. Download it, it's free.

Then install the program.

Now, when u click on ""Download this torrent"" click, ""Open with"" and select Bitcomet, and the dl will start."
