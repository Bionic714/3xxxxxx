Make sure you ask a professional before starting anything you see in this video.  Im not saying the guy is an idiot and doesn't know what hs talking about.  I just dont like how he didn't check some really important things after the port and polish job.

 This is the best way to ruin a port , not make it better.
 Just jumping in and grinding away is NOT the way to improve ports. You have to understand why you are taking material out of a certain place in the port and what effect it will have on flow. 
 This guy seems to think that porting out a head means just sanding the surface of the port walls and making it look pretty or making it look like something has been done, when in reality, it hasn't .. What a hack..
 What a waste of 886MB."
