Erin Grant loses care and custody of her daughter when she's divorced from her 
husband Darrell, a small-time thief. Struggling for money, she is a dancer at a 
nightclub, where one night Congressman Dilbeck (in disguise) attacks another 
member of the audience. A spectator, who recognizes Dilbeck and is fond of Erin, 
offers to get back her daughter by blackmailing Dilbeck. Things do not work out 
as planned, though.
