,Subjazz,2008-11-04T00:55Z,"This movie is not bad. For a classic Kung Fu Flick there is some oddness in the storyline, but the fight scenes are well orchestrated and entertaining. I'd give this movie a good 7.5/10 
The fight scenes also take place in a variety of areas too making it more unique rather than another fight in a house or on a road."
