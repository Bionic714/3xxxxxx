,GutzaPopandau,2008-09-08T23:41Z,"A BIG THANK YOU MEMORABILIA!!!
In my opinion this is the best J.M. Jarre show ever. Used to have the tape...not anymore unfortunately. ""It is wet tonight but as you know, frogs like rain""or ""it's a bit wet tonight - this is not wet this in England"". Once downloaded, I will keep on seeding this torrent for as long as I possibily can.
As Zer么mancer said, it a shame they don't digitally remaster some of the old VHS tapes on DVD format. But if they do, who the hell would buy the rest of the rubbish they bring up on the market nowadays.
Once again a big thank you!!!"
