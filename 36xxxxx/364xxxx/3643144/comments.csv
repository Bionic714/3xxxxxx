i'll have to find tracking more dependable for my region before reposting the torrent (hopefully 4 or more for redundancy)"
,wahr,2007-03-20T17:12Z,"hmm.. never mind.. it seems like the tracker finally cooperated after taking its sweet time.

enjoy guys."

,BIGEDDY15,2010-09-15T21:59Z,"this brings me back to high school computer class, id just watch red vs blue all day, thx wahr, btw mp4 will play on psp"
,Bishounen,2010-10-10T06:49Z,"HOLY CRAP SHITTY AND SMALL!!!

I mean, I know it's meant to be played on an ipod or other device with a small screen, but you DO know that they will downrez automatically for you, right?  You don't have to re-transcode them into ""tiny as hell"" size!  Don't upload shit that's so small nobody can fucking see it without a magnifying glass.

Video 1/10
Audio 6/10 (shitty mp4 compression, caused noticeable popping on a few tracks)

Ugh.  what a waste of my bandwidth."
,Mac Genius,2011-09-16T03:20Z,"Downloading, Thanks for such a wonderful effort.
I am not clear on the seasons though, are we getting more?"
