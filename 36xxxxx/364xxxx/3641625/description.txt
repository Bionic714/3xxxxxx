Ive been looking for this for ages, and found it and thought i'd share it with you all! There is no actual full version, this is the latest version, there are some flaws, like no save. For more help go to www.zadarider.com forums. Check out youtube.com for zada rider! Also, the game in the file is called "land" keep all the files in the file and dont move any of the files out because it wont work then!
Have fun for hours with this nifty little game!
