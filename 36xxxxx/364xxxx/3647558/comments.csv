@alpha2012: Thx for uploading the game. 

I really don't mean to complain but you could have included at least a few notes on how to properly install the game. 

Anyway, I did it for all you people out there wondering how to access the pure enjoyment that is You Don't Know JACK! 

Here you go:

1. Extract *.rar-file

2. Create an ISO which includes all the files that come with the torrent !!!PLUS!!! (before zipping 
   it all up in the ISO-File) modify YDNYV2._CD via Text-Editor and make sure that the first two lines read:

    -->    Art Version: P37	                    Path To Resources=YDKJ2\    "
