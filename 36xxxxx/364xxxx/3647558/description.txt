sorry, but i had to do some file re-arranging on my pc, which rendered the previous torrents usless.  But now they're back up.  I've compressed more of the files to make them easier for downloading.  Hope this helps.

All YDKJ games are installed on my pc, and running correctly.  Any problems, please leave a comment.  I recommend using WinRAR to extract, and using Ultra ISO premium (there's a trial version) for both image conversion and for burning.
