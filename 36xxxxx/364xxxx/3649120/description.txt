I just keep my avi files stored on my hardrive for quick viewing, but back them up as data onto dvd.  I highly recommend installing the K-Lite Full codec pack, it's free; this way, you'll be able to view more avi file types that divx can't handle, like xvid.  To get the K-Lite full free codec pack, go to: www.xvid.com.
