,ripture,2007-03-24T05:14Z,"Hey, Shylock, here's a spoon.  Eat my ass.

The box is called ""description.""  Since when is ""............."" a description?  If this ""great"" member of the community is so ""great"" with his uploads, why doesn't he take the 5 seconds it takes to copy-paste the .nfo into the description.

I guess I should just use google to find the .torrent file too while I'm at it, shouldn't I."
