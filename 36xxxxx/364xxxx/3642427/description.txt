The old Shenmue titles are one of the best games ever created for the sega dreamcast unfrotunantly these games shenmue 1,2,3 are slowly starting to vanish from the face of the earth due to late releases we are still waiting for shenmue 3 :( well in any case i bring you the shenmue 1 and 2 OST. 

Note: The shenmue 2 is not actually an OST as there was no official OST released for it so after many days searching and researching i have found the music from the game and releasing it with the original Shenmue game.

Enjoy and if this is accidently password protected you can find password from www.unitednova.com inside the forum and on a side note only registered members can see the password other wise you will just see a title \"bittorrent\" and nothign in it.

Enjoy this fine release.
