Music At Work (or Music @ Work) is the eigth full-length album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. It was released in 2000.

The album's title comes from the slogan of a Toronto soft rock station, EZRock. Its use is meant to be ironic; the first line of the title track is "Everything is bleak, it's the middle of the night/you're all alone and the dummies might be right." The music video for "Music at Work" was filmed in the lobby of Commerce Court North, part of the headquarters of the Canadian bank CIBC.

Much like their previous album, Phantom Power, it had decent sales in Canada.

After the album was released, singer Gordon Downie released a solo album of music and poetry called Coke Machine Glow.

All songs were written by The Tragically Hip
