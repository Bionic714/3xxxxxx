,goodguy,2007-03-22T21:55Z,"Now, this is what I would call a REAL upload! Thanks!"
,Tutte,2007-03-30T14:08Z,"Great package. Seems noone can dowload though because there is no seeder. 
Everyone is stuck on 26.9%.

Please please seed :)"
,T-1OOO,2007-03-30T19:15Z,"I am seeding as much as I can so be patient!
You will reach 100% some day. We're talking 30 GiB here!"
,Space_ace__,2007-03-31T17:09Z,"Wow... this is gonna take a while... I'll just take s01-07... i don't trust the mpg's...

Big thanks for upload!!!"
,zygotized,2007-04-01T08:24Z,"Thank you very much for this.. but now I'm stuck at 36,7. Guess this could take a while..."

,mike182,2007-04-03T10:26Z,very nice stuff!!..  hope i'll be i able 2 download it all.. 
,T-1OOO,2007-04-03T10:43Z,Don't you worry people. I am seeding everyday but my computer has to rest sometime too you know.
,sanctum,2007-04-03T21:28Z,"A great torrent..Too bad Im stuck at 45% for 2days now, getting speed at approx 1kbs on a 20mbit line. Sorry T-1OOO, but at that seeding speed I takes too long....Half of the time there are no seeds..."
,T-1OOO,2007-04-05T00:41Z,I don't know sanctum but I try to do at least 3% each day so it really sounds strange if you're stuck at one point. I am seeding 31 GiB over my 8Mbit line and I think I am doing a pretty damn good job here. 45% in 14 days? It means ONLY YOU are downloading 1 GiB each day from me among 80 uploaders! So be thankful!
,mike182,2007-04-05T01:10Z,"i think ur doing a good job.. every day the so-called ""stuck point"" is different.. just.. keep up the good work and everyone will manage 2 download this :).. i wonder though.. why the 2 ppl who downloaded it don't seed as well.."
,Slasen83,2007-04-10T13:22Z,Whay not seed until someone else can?
,ronald_poi,2007-04-10T17:33Z,"T-1000, does this come with Spanish subtitles?..."
,T-1OOO,2007-04-10T21:50Z,"no spanish subs, only some english and swedish... not complete though"
,ronald_poi,2007-04-11T03:43Z,"Damn, i wanted my family to be able to understand. What the hell, I'm gonna download it anyway!...
Be sure i'll seed as far as the gods allows me!"

,miroslavp,2007-04-14T17:29Z,"wow man, hold on, i just said it's the bst torrent out there. I had fear you won't be back, as I have started too much downloads with seeder not comming back, i appreciate the trouble"
,T-1OOO,2007-04-14T22:26Z,"Well, I am not stupid enough to put 30 GiB out on piratebay and seed up to 70% and then stop seeding (a sudden car accident will stop me or whatever)... shut up (people) and let your bittorrent client do the rest :D"
,ronald_poi,2007-04-15T02:24Z,"Althought i just began downloading this torrent, it goes lightspeed to me. I'll seed for months after download it... Promise. Thanks T-1000 for such great job."
,Garconis,2007-04-16T05:53Z,"Thanks!  I already have all of the episodes, the the quality is HORRIBLE!  The entire collection is only 8GB.  Some of the episode files are only 20MB, lol.  It's time I replaced them with quality!  So thanks!"
,Mace1984,2007-04-17T10:59Z,"Hi there, thanks a lot for making this torrent available!

However, I am sorry to see all seeders have abandoned it, making it difficult for those of us still stuck at around 86,1 %. I would be really nice if someone would please continue to seed this.

Thanks in advance!"
,miroslavp,2007-04-17T13:45Z,"don't worry, seeder will be back, and Im almost completed, one or two days to finish"

After I placed the subtitles correct do I need to activate the subtitles somehow? I am using vlc media player...

Thanks alot for any help! "
,T-1OOO,2007-05-10T18:12Z,"Download VobSub 2.23 and install the app..
Place the sub in the same folder as the movie.
The subtitle MUST have the same name as the movie.

,mttsrn,2007-05-11T16:07Z,det går inte mer långsamt om ni delar med er lite!! så varför inte ta och göra det.kan till och med gå snabbare eftersom fler folk då blir klara fortare. ju mer 100%are ju snabbare för de andra i stort sett... det är väl det som är hela grejen med detta!!??

,T-1OOO,2007-07-01T20:24Z,"Säsong 8 kom ju nyligen ut på DVD så det kommer att dröja ett bra tag innan Säsong 9 kommer... Jag hittade info om releasedatumen på wikipedia men det står tyvärr inte när Säsong 9 kommer ut på DVD.
För övrigt så är det inte jag som har rippat DVD-skivorna. Jag har googlat och sökt efter episoderna via nätet för att sedan dela med mig här på piratebay.

,jenkins4president,2011-01-05T02:11Z,"The following is for everyone that complains about there being too many leechers and not enough seeders.

I always commit to the 1:1 ration as a minimum, if not more. So, in retrospect, I'm always giving back just as much as I took but it's a hard thing to do when there are users like myself that don't have the pleasure of unlimited bandwidth. I'm a Canadian resident and unfortunately, unlimited usage allowances have died off over time so every kilobyte that I seed for everyone is very precious as opposed to those blessed with unlimited upload and download allowances.

I understand that it's no excuse to not be willing to give back what you took (1:1) but that may be a contributing factor for users choosing to not upload as much as they download. "
