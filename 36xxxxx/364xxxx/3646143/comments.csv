,shamvil,2008-08-04T12:27Z,"Hi Echizen2005,
Is this the same movie directed by John Woo, starring Yun Fat Chow."
,P-dot,2008-12-12T02:42Z,"Since others have done it...

Can you or anyone who has it please seed Expect the Unexpected? I'm writing in the vain hope that someone will have pity on me, here! I'll seed it 30 times over or more...

Thanks."
,DiplomaT19,2008-12-19T00:55Z,SEEEEEEDDDD PLZZZ::::::
,inianlion,2009-09-08T18:46Z,"I wonder why people are crazy with this movie. Most Asian cinemas way back from 80's will be like this.

Well, I think may be because of John Woo."
,Northernism,2009-11-26T04:57Z,"Great rip, except the subs are terrible. Example: There is a scene where they do a flash back of it, and the flashback subs are different from the original thing that the flashback is going to. I think in the original he says ""New Zeland"" and in the flashback he says ""North Pole""

Sadly there are no better subs from my searching.

Otherwise: V-9 A-9"
,lytic,2010-10-06T22:01Z,"Subtitles are HILARIOUS.

Great movie!"
