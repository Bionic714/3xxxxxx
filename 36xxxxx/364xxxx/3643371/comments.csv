,pyrogenetix,2008-02-23T03:45Z,"I would like to say thank you so much to all the seeders out there. 

I stumbled across this music and I really like it now, but my download has been at 99.6% for 2 weeks now. 

I don't normally ask much since this is all for free, but if anybody could seed, that would be awesome. I don't know any of you and you have no responsibility to me, but if you do seed, know that I would really appreciate it. 

Thank you in advance. "
