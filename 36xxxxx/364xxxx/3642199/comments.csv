,jfajitaspirate,2007-03-21T14:17Z,"Will someone PLEASE tell be if you burned this successfully?  I downloaded the whole (big) file, but it only burns this as a video and audio folder. It says it is missing files.  Now it sits on my HD, someone PLEASE HELP or Bieri, can you add the missing files? I really want to see this movie."
,jfajitaspirate,2007-03-21T17:36Z,THIS DOES NOT WORK SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS VERSION. (I'm hoping someone proves me wrong because i really want to see this movie.
,rueithls,2007-03-22T05:56Z,"CREATE NEW ""IFO"" AND ""BUP""

maybe you can use other way but here is my opinions and steps

1. Only keep all vob files in VIDEO_TS folder delete the others

2. use IfoEdit.exe to Create new IFO files

first   choose ""Create IFOs"" button
second  1st VOB of Title-Set choose ""AT_CLOSE_RANGE\VIDEO_TS\VTS_01_5.VOB""
third   Destination directory for IFO files choose ""AT_CLOSE_RANGE\VIDEO_TS""
...wait for new IFO and BUP done...

3. try to play it with PowerDVD

4. Nero burn it

Done..."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-03-25T09:41Z,"This film as it is does not run in WMP, but it does in PowerDVD. Nero Re-code refuses to handle it, Nero Express gives serious warnings during burning, and the resulting disc does not run in my dvd-player."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-03-25T19:48Z,"Thank you, rueithls, it worked! I downloaded IfoEdit free from http://www.free-codecs.com/download/IFOEdit.htm - not very user-friendly, but OK when I followed your instructions. I'll use it next time someone has removed or messed up the ifo and bup files. 
I got English soundtrack in stereo, French and Spanish both mono, and French and Spanish subs in GREEN, almost illegible."
