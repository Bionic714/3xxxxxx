for three weeks in a row this asshole CAPH has done bad rips. you would think you could trust EZTVEFNET. but no. read the 100 posts on their forum. 

caph cannot code. his stuff plays ok on the computer but cannot be burned to cd or dvd and then played on a real tv. he makes a very simple mistake.

but the guys at EZTV insist they put up his rips instead of the FULLY WORKING ones, because caph is first to post. this is because caph's canadian station in BC airs earlier than elsewhere. and EZTV is a canadian operation in BC. simple jingoism. when are canadians going to grow up.

So you cannot trust eztv. to be safe, avoid all caph releases for the moment. there are always others of proven reliability: lol, xor etc etc
