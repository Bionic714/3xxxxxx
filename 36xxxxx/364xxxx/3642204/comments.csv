,RedK8,2009-06-11T15:00Z,"For those of you who are debating about the MS or Mac argument, here are some facts and opinions:
-MS is better for gaming.
-Mac is better for computer designs, photo editing, video editing, sound editing, etc.
-MS is so 1990's
-Mac is the future

FYI (for your info)  Bill Gates had his home designed using a Mac : ) its just pure fact that Mac is way for sleek and powerful when it comes to professional work."
