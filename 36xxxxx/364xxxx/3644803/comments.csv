,Arcana_nl,2007-03-26T14:31Z,Thanks. I've been looking for these. Can't help you with the other books though.
,chaoskaizer,2007-03-28T01:19Z,thanks this meant a lot
,kurtuk,2007-05-04T08:37Z,I have all these books but getting them in digital is very nice. My books have not stood up well to the rigors of time & play so it will be nice to print out torn/destroyed pages to replace in my books.
