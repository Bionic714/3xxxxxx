The 36 Crazy Fists (1977)

Plot:	Chan keeps getting beat up by martial artists and joins a martial arts school involving himself in everything but learning. He meets a drunken hermit who eventually becomes his martial arts teacher and teaches Chan the "36 Styles" of kung fu.

Overview:	Wong Tai-Kwong doesn't know much about martial arts, and seems doomed to a life of getting beaten up by martial artists. In order to protect himself, Wong enrolls in a Kung Fu school, but ends up spending most of his time cleaning the floors instead of learning the martial arts.

One day, however, while carrying water from the river, Wong meets a drunken hermit who eventually becomes his kung fu teacher--and teaches him the "36 Styles" of kung fu that eventually lead him to victory over a series of deadly fighters.

36 Crazy Fists features the fight choreography of the master himself, Jackie Chan, who also has a cameo role in the film as a stunt coordinator.
