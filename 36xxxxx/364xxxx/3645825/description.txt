Description:  

The movie is about Holly Golightly, a young woman always on the 
run from herself. Holly Golightly lives in an apartment in New York City.  Her 
live-in companion is an orange tabby named \"Cat\" because she feels that they 
don\'t really belong to each other and to give the cat an actual name would 
acknowledge that they have a lasting relationship.
The main plot of the movie is Holly\'s relationship with neighbor Paul Varjak, 
who has confidence problems of his own. The story explores the relationship 
between Holly and Paul, Holly and her other paramours, and the resolution that 
occurs within Holly\'s own mind and between Holly and Paul. The film includes 
Audrey Hepburn singing the original performance of \"Moon River\" and the 
famous closing sequence.
