,knives2meetyou,2007-03-23T20:07Z,"Same here, 84.5% and it stopped.  Perhaps you could upload it again?  Unless someone has an idea as to what's wrong.  Thanks for posting this, by the way - looking forward to hearing it."
,knives2meetyou,2007-03-24T00:00Z,"It's working its way up, slowly but surely (but surely slow) - up to 98.7% now (but not presently downloading).  I'll stay on once it completes the download, of course, and hopefully that'll help."
