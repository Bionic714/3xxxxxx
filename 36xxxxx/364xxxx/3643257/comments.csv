,Sumo114,2007-03-20T23:08Z,can someone put 18 and 19 out as AVI files - pleeeeeeeezzzzzzzeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
,matttyger,2007-03-21T14:00Z,"@sumo114: Nope, do it yourself, just unpack with winrar and you have your .avi file..."
,jnd,2007-03-22T00:36Z,"lol, some want it all on a silver platter.."
,Sumo114,2007-03-22T21:04Z,"ind - some of us are new to this and i didn't know how to convert the files. i do now.

so don't be fucking sarcastic"
,oblachubs,2007-03-23T00:55Z,I second that.  You jackasses forget what it's like to be new and nobody is willing to help you.  Turn it around for a change.
,Marcos1994,2007-03-23T02:30Z,I agree aswell...these smug people like mattyger and jnd need to learn how to be friendly and not stupid fucking cocksuckers!
,coldburn,2007-03-23T02:40Z,"you know, you could always go to google.com and type .rar... i bet that theirs like 100+ sited that will tell u what they are/do and how to use them... 

A lil FYI... if your using the interweb, learn how to use it first."
,shaw214,2007-03-24T00:52Z,i prefer .rar files incase something happens to the download....that way you only have to get a few small files.
,zidern,2007-03-24T02:08Z,"bittorrent already allows you to get parts of the files, that's why split rar archives are redundant in torrents."
,zk0,2007-03-26T11:15Z,"""Oh yeah also, Orenji's is missing the show's intro.""

No he did not! This episode was the first ever that did not have a intro. They needed all the time they could get for the story.

Do your homework!"
,Bing80,2007-03-26T20:24Z,"And when is the next episode (part 2) coming out?

Waiting on the edge of my chair here :)"
