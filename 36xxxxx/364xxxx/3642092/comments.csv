,swillynswilly,2007-03-24T06:10Z,"Games work great thanks, oh esuna are you using 3.03 oe-c or have you updated to 3.10?"
,Esuna,2007-03-26T18:54Z,"3.03 oe-c. i prefer it, and even though my psp is now un-brickable i try not to flash it too much. only thing id flash it for now is an xml theme that i wouldnt get sick of, still havent found one =/"
,pspbricker,2007-04-07T17:21Z,Nice. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Movie creator works fine with the crack. Thanks!
,Kedavix,2007-04-15T04:33Z,"Esuna, may I ask how you got yours to be unbrickable? Did you buy the Undiluted Platinum PSP Mod Chip?

I just ordered my psp off of ebay, it should be arriving soon.

Also, could someone post a link to where I can find the 3.03 oe-c firmware?

Thanks!"
,unfrgvncure,2007-06-05T23:52Z,"You can get 3.03 OE-C from psp-hacks.com

just go to downloads/firmware/and try to find the easy download version, cause it really is way easier.

If your psp isn't in version 1.50 then you will need to downgrade to it, just hope you have 3.03 or less.

For downgrading help go to the forums page, then tutorials on psp-hacks.com"

,MissMaster,2007-10-07T22:51Z,Killzone hangs up when i try to start playing campaign. Any ideas how to solve the problem?
,MissMaster,2007-10-07T22:57Z,By the way i use the 3.52 M33 firmware. It also hangs up when trying to host multiplayer sessions.
,Dudewithoutapet,2007-12-18T21:39Z,"Not sure if you still read this, but Esuna, thank you so much. I'm gonna post this in your other torrents as well in case you see this one and not the others or vice versa."
,TRUEWOLF,2008-02-13T03:06Z,"hey guys how do i work these, do i just upload it to my 4gb memory card on my psp or what?"

,Esuna,2008-04-05T10:01Z,"No idea on the killzone hangups, tested on 4 psp units and works fine. my psp is unbrickable because i killed some files in my psp flash memory for a recovery program. this program is included in most of darkalex's oe firmwares."
,holmes33,2012-08-21T15:18Z,"Esuna if you have disk 2 from ff7, it would be greatly appreciated if you could upload it somehow. Thanks."
