Plot:	Lo Lieh plays the best of the best of security guards, who must protect a shipment of silver from both thieves and treachery alike.

Overview:	While American and European movies feature "security guards," they are virtually never the kind of heroes who appear in many great kung-fu thrillers. This time Wu Ma, who had cut his teeth as Chang Cheh's assistant director, decided to go to the heart of the matter. He cast Lo Lieh, the Shaw Studios first international star ("King Boxer"), as the best of the best, who must protect a shipment of silver from both thieves and treachery alike.
