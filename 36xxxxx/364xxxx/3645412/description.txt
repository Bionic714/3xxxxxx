Synopsis:
LBJ is deservedly one of Alvarez?s best known shorts, a stunning piece of visual and musical montage using found materials, reaching a high pitch of satire Alvarez seems to have reserved for President Johnson. The film contains three main sections, with a prologue and an epilogue. The sections correspond to the three letters of Johnson?s initials. Alvarez uses them to stand for Luther as in Martin Luther King, Bob as in Robert Kennedy, and Jack or John, his brother. It?s a bold play on the strange coincidence that the corpses of these three men littered Johnson?s ascent. The film steers pretty close to libel, so to speak, in linking Johnson to the assassinations, but this is not the point?. What Alvarez does is to portray Johnson?s presidency as the culmination of a whole history of socio-political corruption, not of individual presidential corruption of a kind that was yet to come.
