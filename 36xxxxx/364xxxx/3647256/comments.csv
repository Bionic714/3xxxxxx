,xiIix,2010-02-15T19:27Z,"Shanyiee:

The Xbox 360 won't be successfully emulated for at least 7-10 years from now. We are JUST beginning to actually be semi-successful with the PS2 emulator, and that was a LONG time coming. It was total shit until very recent breakthroughs. To emulate a 360 you would need a cloud computer, and even then you'd need the emulator to be efficient enough to ruin well."
