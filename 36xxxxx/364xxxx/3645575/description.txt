This is the Monsters Of Rock vinyl album (there I go polluting the digital medium again!) from 1980 live from Castle Donnington.

The album only contains 8 tracks, 2 from Rainbow, 2 from the Scorpion, the rest, 1 each, from Saxon, April Wine, Touch (?), and Riot.

Bearing in mind that this album I've had for nearly 30yrs, so I've done the best I can with it, and besides I think I need a new stylus for me turntable!

Enjoy :)
