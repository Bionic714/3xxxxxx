,NoizeBoy Orange,2007-08-11T08:05Z,"Hi cb wawa,

To seed this torrent you'll need to upload the torrent file again, from your location.  If you are logged in to the pirate bay, ""upload torrent"" should be an option at the bottom of every screen.  Once uploaded, please keep it posted for long enough for me to download it.  I'll seed for awhile, too."
