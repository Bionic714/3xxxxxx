"Black Cat, White Cat" is one of the funniest films you'll ever see, a rollicking mix of Romani and Serb eccentrics and crooks on the make on the banks of the Danube, scored to brassbands on crack. By the end, the goofy exuberance will have you grinning so wide your mouth will hurt -- Hollywood forgot how to make entertainment like this forty years ago. The premise: Two winsome teenagers must plot their way out of arranged marriages orchestrated by a local gangster...and let the wacky hijinks ensue.
