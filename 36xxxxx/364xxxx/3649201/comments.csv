,herbman75,2007-03-29T12:16Z,"Side ""F"" was blank, even though it looks like it has tracks cut in it."

Some rare tracks from Jack Whites early Band The Upholsterers."
,tkoger,2008-06-09T08:49Z,"Really good stuff, by the way where did you get this"
,BlankWyman,2008-09-09T14:30Z,"I can have a go cleaning it up and editing into tracks if you like... however I did notice one or two cases of distortion, looks like the needle pretty much jumped out of the groove?"
,herbman75,2008-10-14T00:03Z,"If there is any distortion, it came from the guitar - not my turntable. I know how to set the the stylus pressure and ant-skate. The needle doesn't ""jump the groove"" on my deck. "
,bigbent,2008-11-02T06:43Z,"Gee buddy. You are a legend, getting this and putting it up. Thanks for it. I'm gonna dl it tonight.

How did you get it?"

,herbman75,2009-03-16T01:48Z,"Where did I get it? A buddy of mine won this record set at a charity auction. 

Many fuckhead attention whores across the interwebz have ""reworked"" it and uploaded it again.

It seems pretty popular. "
