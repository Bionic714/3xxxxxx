The White Stripes - Live in Las Vegas

Recorded Live @ The Joint in Las Vegas on September 20th, 2003

3 LP US Vinyl Promo. V2 Records

This rare 3 LP vinyl promo was pressed up for V2 contest winners who 
were flown out to vegas for the Stripes show back in september of 2003. 
i was told there were only 30-40 copies of the show pressed up. Copies were autographed by Jack and Meg and distributed to contest winners and radio stations for various promotions. The audio is taken directly from the soundboard.

Tracks were recorded with a Pioneer PDR-509 CD recorder with a Burr 
Brown DAC.

Turntable - Pioneer PL-518 direct drive turntable with a Shure 
M950ED cartridge & new Pfhansteihl stylus.

I then ripped the tracks to lossless .wav files in Adobe Audition.

There are a few crackles and pops, but nothing really distracting 
(anything you can hear) after the music kicks in. The surface noise 
is only in the dead vinyl. After Jack White begins to shred, the light
surface noise is really an afterthought. I did not run it through any
noise filters or compress at all. I also did not edit the album sides
into individual tracks. I haven\'t learned how to yet. If you can 
edit up tracks Audition or Cool Edit Pro that\'s great, I am proud 
of you, but I don\'t want to hear about it. Also, no complaints like 
\"Why isn\'t it zipped?\" or \"What about .ogg or .flac?\" I don\'t spend 
enough time doing this sort of thing to give a damn. Here are some 
rare tracks, ripped from vinyl into a lossless format. There you go. 
Best I could do. Enjoy...
