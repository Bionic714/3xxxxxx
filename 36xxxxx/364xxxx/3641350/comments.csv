[T],Knaster,2007-03-18T13:15Z,lol don't think u need to learn russian in order to download :)
,van_loath,2007-03-18T13:15Z,"Hey slovar2003, could you plz give instructions on how to disable the crack? (or is it described in the text file?)
I undortunately can't log in into the russian forum, which the same torrent on isohunt.com gives a link to ( http://torrents.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1825223 )"
,van_loath,2007-03-18T13:16Z,"I of course meant ""disable the protection""...
and I read ""You can disable.."" instead of ""If you can disable.."" :("
,LRN,2007-03-18T13:28Z,"Yeah, some of us bought this game today. But noone were able to baypass StarForce...so you have to wait for proper release from da GrOuPZ. Or, maybe, for new antiblacklisting tools for DAEMON Tools"
,OutKaST_WP,2007-03-18T13:30Z,"?? ????? ??? ???? ??????????, 100% ????????. ????? ???????? ?? 23 ?????."
,Muzy,2007-03-18T13:31Z,"Knaster,

LOL I meant playing the game throw downloading the game, hehe good one though."
,van_loath,2007-03-18T13:37Z,"I suppose you are asking weather this is teh r34l stuff, Outkast..
It might be, in russia everything is still very liberal with software..."
[T],Knaster,2007-03-18T14:06Z,"van_loath you can probably deactivate starforce in ""properties--->system--> software--> Unit properties(not sure about the english word well the one above drivers) -->show hidden --> there you will find ""Starforce Protection Synchronization"" something and below ""  Starforce Protection VFS Driver"" deactivate these two and restart computer.

This works for me for all starforce games i've played not sure about Stalker since i havent tried it yet. Let us now if it works though"
,van_loath,2007-03-18T14:45Z,Har har knaster
,van_loath,2007-03-18T14:58Z,"'t would be so fucking funny if it really worked, Knaster....
I'll have a look if it works with domination (a starforce title i have here dloaded..)

here is a screen of where to find what knaster means. at least on win2k :D
It's the device manager..
http://85.17.40.9:99/34a/full/132/1324053280.jpg"
[T],Knaster,2007-03-18T15:01Z,"Yes device manager is what i meant, brief memory laps there :) but you should deactivate any and all starforce drivers on that list."
,van_loath,2007-03-18T15:32Z,"Knaster, I have x Starforce drivers and a pretty slow computer, I will deactivate the drivers one by one and then try to run the game.
I already reached a point, where I aimlessly deactivated all of the sf-drivers and then domination, the game i have dloaded that has sf-protection, said that there was a problem and blah contact support blah. so i might have to be choosy with the drivers to kill.

can you name the names of the games you were able to play the way you explained it plz?"
,rilaohan,2007-03-18T16:11Z,can i use the YASU to game????
,van_loath,2007-03-18T16:31Z,"t's hard to find info on yasu, you should dl and install deemontools"
[T],Knaster,2007-03-18T17:04Z,hmm the most recent one is ARMA
[T],Knaster,2007-03-18T17:05Z,there were some others but most are uninstalled atm.
,igorsem,2007-03-18T18:28Z,"2 AbbaSill:

,tkm16,2007-03-18T18:41Z,"wheres the Released version?!?! apparently its out

,Smirnovevil,2007-03-18T18:48Z,there is one at torrentleech
[T],Knaster,2007-03-18T18:51Z,"yeah the ""hatred"" one is a fake it was uploaded to TPB a few days ago some idiot with too much spare time that one :("
,Molokk,2007-03-18T19:00Z,"TorrentLeech needs registration, and registrations are closed at the moment, nice coincidence."
,exxxec,2007-03-18T19:48Z,"ok this is weird.. nforce only has one release of stalker, and I would assume its this one.. which is in russian, apparanty.. but in the link you posted, tkm16, it states is multi language.. either thats info on the EU release of the original game or the description on this torrent is wrong.. or am i missing something? :S"
[T],Knaster,2007-03-18T19:49Z,van_loath now some ppl say it's securom protection ....hmm well
,exxxec,2007-03-18T19:59Z,the UNLEASHED reales has securerom prot.... i dont know what release this is tbh
,Molokk,2007-03-18T20:01Z,"This version here is a Russian version. The one at nForce is a newly released multi-language version (English, French, Spanish and Italian), and that version is apparently from the UNLEASHED release group, which usually release legit copies. However right now that release isn't anywhere to be found on known public torrent sites such as here at PirateBay, it should be soon though."
,exxxec,2007-03-18T20:34Z,unleashed realease is uped on demonoid
,coth,2007-03-18T20:38Z,this is not a multilanguage version. it's russian only. protected by !!starforce!!. securom is used by thq. 1c has prefered starforce.

,InFeRNiUM,2007-03-19T11:07Z,"People, who did get stalker, write - a game was started for you or not?"
,Its2l82die,2007-03-19T12:19Z,Ive downlaoded but yeah the Starforce prevents you from playing it don't know what to do maybe wait for a crack to come or anything else cause the other torrents are very slow for me about 1-10 kb/s.

,UglyPilot,2008-04-25T00:21Z,"FOR ANYONE HAVING ISSUES WITH BLACK SCREEN UPON START FOR S.T.A.L.K.E.R AND COLIN MCRAE DIRT: HERE'S MY SOLUTION:

There is a file called adi_oal.dll in directory; c:\windows\system32\adi_oal.dll

Or if you have a 64 bit system;
c:\windows\SysWOW64\adi_oal.dll

DELETE OR RENAME THIS FILE!

I had installed colin mcrae dirt for over 4 months and luckily I found this solution on codemasters forum. And I can play both stalker and colin. Before this, I couldnt play both."
