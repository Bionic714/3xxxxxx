,sibelius8,2007-10-20T06:57Z,I agree with you about Gilels and the Weber sonata. It's a gorgeous piece and one of my favorite piano sonatas. No one played it better than Gilels.
,bauxiet,2008-08-04T18:59Z,"Years ago I bought on the market an Emil Gilels lp, but when I came home it turned out to be a Beatles record. I still have the cover. It says: Emil Gilels plays Tchaikowsky, piano concerto in B minor. 
Now I can finally listen to the playing of Emil Gilels. 
Thanks very mutch!"
