RabbRadio Episode 1x01 - March 27, 2007

After many a long year has gone by since I worked with CFMU in McMaster University, many years have past, but my love of Radio has not.  So, My fiance and I have created RabbRadio, the Internet Radio Podcast.  Along with our family, friends, and people we will meet we will bring you music, entertainment, news and jokes, plus some of our own friendly banter.

This is our first episode and is created as a sample program.  The audio is not perfect, and the show format is not settled yet, but we wanted to get the first one out there to see what people thought.  So.... here it is.

Already we have had about 8 listeners, and we appreciate ALL of you downloading it.  We had to remake the torrent, since... well... Howard skrewed it up.  

So, here's the NEW torrent.  If you've already downloaded it, please reseed using the torrent, plesae seed as long as you can so others can enjoy.  And please.... tell a friend or two.

We appreciate it!

And we hope you enjoy the show.
