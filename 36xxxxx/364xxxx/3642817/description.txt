HKFlix Says:  	3.5 Stars

A fairly good old school flick, hampered a bit by several lengthy and slow patches and mediocre acting and fighting by the male lead. Definitely some nice weapons fighting here, however, and an irresistible performance by Lily Li.

Overview:	A young court official (David Chiang) is sent by the government to spy on a prominent family who are believed to be rebels. Once inside, he falls in love with the elder's daughter. To get her out he must defeat siblings and father. From this comes the development of the Shaolin Mantis style. Action-packed from start to finish, including a cameo by the master killer himself!
