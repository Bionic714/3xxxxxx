,Mike.E.Misery,2008-06-17T02:40Z,"Good quality.
Great series.
Beats the hell outta Stargate.
Thanks for the upload, dude."
,ssiccarii,2008-07-21T03:25Z,"Better than Star Gate?
Maybe if they made a few more seasons and the series was picked up by BBC.
Anyway thanks for the upload, I had it before and my girlfriend stole it."
,mike18xx,2008-08-22T03:20Z,"Oh, great; the asshole from ""Dirty Harry's Place"" has come over here to piss about Firefly and spam his favorite lesser show which has no *theme*.

GTFO."
,le610n,2008-11-25T19:27Z,"Yes, Glitterspell Firefly was and still is fantastic. It's so sad that it wasn't continiued... But apparently if a series doesn't go 10 million veiwers on the Pilot episode it's just not worth keeping alive. Sad sad sad... "
,war_peanut,2009-01-11T18:24Z,"Thanks dude, this is much appreciated."

,XweAponX,2009-05-18T21:57Z,"Whos from Dirty Harry's place?

Someone had the DVD Iso Image for ""Serenity"" posted, but no seeders!

I finally sat down and watched this last weekend, I had the full DVD set I bought from a hock shop for like 4 bucks, 4 DVD set perfect condition.

I found ""Serenity"" in HD and they pulled out all the stops for Serenity... No Network to muck it up.

Le610n... True what you say, but Fox-ucks who ran the series did not air the pilot episode as a Pilot, ergo dumping the viewers into the middle with no continuity. There are 3 whole eps they never showed.

This is the same crap they pulled on Chris Carter's ""Harsh Realm"" show, which only got the pilot ever aired.

Fox is like that, which makes me amazed that they have not dumped Fringe and Dollhouse as unceremoniously as they did Firefly."
,3doxiemom,2009-11-21T05:46Z,seeeeeeed please...my sister just told me about this series and would love to get it. Thank you for your work in putting it here for us!
,Jasonofcompsci,2009-11-30T17:45Z,"I only have 25% of the torrent and I've seeded more than I've downloaded.  This means one thing.  You guys need to learn how to port forward. Its easy.

Now I always seed to a ratio of 3:1 unless it takes a week to get there and my app is set to do that automatically.  But I would prefer to seed after I've downloaded.

Just learn to port forward and it will make things run a lot smoother.  It is also a good skill to learn for security. "
,c10mimi,2010-01-04T22:42Z,The best TV-show ever made!
