GOD OF WAR 2 DVD-9 rip-hursty

region:NTSC
release date:17th mar 2007
source:echelon dvd-9 (big thanks)
console:ps2

RIP/GAME NOTES:
Movies have been downsampled dramatically,so dont expect to enjoy watching them
Widescreen option has been removed,game may crash it you select it from the option menu,
So do not turn widescreen on
Game saves take time to finish

any more bugs?...i dunno
see for yourself,its the best i can do
Anyone who downloads it,and finds it dont work,because of my bad ripping skills,then try it yourself

Thanks to gnie for plug-in for .pak file extraction


Hursty


*Uploaders notes* This one has been tested by multiple people and is FULLY WORKING!

Have fun!
