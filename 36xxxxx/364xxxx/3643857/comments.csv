,juudu,2007-03-21T19:30Z,really working and full game?
,ibenine,2007-03-22T12:01Z,It's working but what's the point of playing GOWII if you can't enjoy the cutscenes?
,Tiberius,2007-03-23T01:30Z,"something is wrong with this build, or release, you get up to the level with the titan then the screen goes black, no cutscene then you die when the screen comes back... not good."
,matrixsublime,2007-03-25T17:44Z,"Can any 1 help me with this download ? i've burned it with Alcohol twice and with nero 7 twice but my ps2 will not even read the disk, is it as simple as just burning the iso to dvd or am i missing somthing....i also burnrd it slowly."
,Skarmalius,2007-03-26T22:30Z,Hey guys can u help me ? I have burned like 70 games they were workin but last 10 of them when i burn started being like... Reads it playstation screen goes up and then just black screen... Can anyone help me? maybe it smthng abt those syupid files like DVD 9 or DVD 5 ? Please tell me cuz a lot of ppl has this strange thing too :) thanks :)
,Tiberius,2007-03-27T02:49Z,"Ok i disabled the widescreen option and it worked like a charm, cutscenes and all, thanks for this awesome release!"
,L4WL3RS34L,2007-03-28T03:10Z,"I recommend NOT downloading this. On the 3rd chapter of the game, you'll run into a glitch none as the ""Great Chasm"". It will freeze once you kick down a bridge and run on it, activating a lengthy cutscene. The one way to fix this glitch is by continuously reloading the game until the 2nd layer of the DVD plays. The only problem is that this is a pirated version, making that impossible to happen. You may be lucky enough to get past this glitch with no problems, or unlucky enough to have to buy a new PS2."
,andybra,2007-03-28T19:10Z,"Can anyone help me, ntsc only plays without colour, how can i fix this?"
,L4WL3RS34L,2007-03-29T01:34Z,"Sorry, I was pretty tired when I typed that. It's actually in chapter 5 after you get the Spear of Destiny I think. And you don't kick the bridge down, you just run on it. Also, it doesn't always freeze, it just won't activate the cutscene to fight Icarus."
,squirrel_master,2007-03-31T04:17Z,"I'm way past the spear of destiny and its working fine. The only glitch I had was the game froze while loading a save once, after a restart all worked fine!

I'm on the The Kraken boss."
,redbeast23,2007-04-01T15:32Z,can i just burn the iso in dvd decrypter/ or nero and it'll play in my ps2?? 
,AxelC,2007-04-17T20:15Z,Write with DVD Decrypter and is working :D
,Kamatari,2007-04-25T22:08Z,"I think I'll buy this instead, it's worth it."
,Zaturn87,2007-04-30T00:02Z,"GoW 2 without bullshit....

,chasetown1,2007-05-07T10:06Z,"I've downloaded this for my son, but I don't know how to copy it to DVD. I've got Nero. If I try to copy it as an ISO DVDROM it tells me that it is bigger than 2GB so to use UDF DVDROM.I tried it and nothing plays. I can't get the image file recognised, so I'm at a total loss. I'd really appreciate some help. Thanks.

,codered,2007-05-08T22:07Z,"nedladdad över 700 ggr..19 seeders....fan utrota leechers!!!

,chasetown1,2007-05-10T20:39Z,Thanks for the reply. The Playstation is chipped. It plays other copied games fine. I think it is the correct method of copying that I am not doing.
,coleix,2007-05-20T22:45Z,Need seeds people. starting download.
,terryn0,2007-06-17T06:36Z,"Ive got a program to convert a folder into an ISO. Do i just put all of these in that one folder and create an ISO file from them? if not, tell me how.."
,gadakk,2007-06-24T16:20Z,"The game freezes for me in the ruins of the forgotten where you need to tip a big platform with 2 statues, the statues tip the platform and i can go down and R1 and tap O but the scene where all of the platform should fall down nver happens and the character is stuck. I can go to the start and select menues and back to the char, but he keeps beeing stuck. Seems like somethings missing. I have tried burning 2 different DVD's but the same thing happens."
,pulk3_macabro,2007-07-21T08:26Z,The Game works fine for me and by the way it is a awesome torrent.......hope anyone keep uploading games that work ...
,TheLivingCarrot,2007-07-28T18:04Z,"hi, anyone knows where to find a patch for this game to my ps2 emulator pcsx2?
i would really appreciate your help"
,jasonbir,2007-11-22T05:54Z,"Question, the movies/cutscenes are of bad quality right, but what about the actual game.  Any changes otherwise, don't care about widescreen...

Thanks in advance, esp. to uploader!"
,Darkave10,2007-12-24T11:00Z,plz Seed!! I download it at 15kbps that sucks
,jgarret620,2008-04-02T21:57Z,This game stops working at the level The Great Chasm. I downloaded again and burned on different media (FujiFilim) and stopped working at same place. Has anyone finished this game? Maybe i did something wrong?
,jgarret620,2008-04-07T18:41Z,did a little research and this is only the first layer of a two layer game. Search for god of war 2 part 2 and you'll find second half. I downloaded and beat game

,MyCrazy69,2009-04-08T00:42Z,if i download this could i play it on my pc still or would i HAVE to burn it to a cd? and if i have to burn it then where can i download a pc version?
,xiIix,2009-08-15T01:30Z,"What the fuck are you talking about?

This is an image of a PS2 game. It will not run on a PC whether you burn it on a CD or not. And even if you could download a PC version (which you can't) why would you burn this one?

The stupidity of your post literally BLOWS me away. I seriously stared at the screen for about 2 minutes in complete awe."
,ntch22,2009-12-03T00:21Z,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS RELEASE

Uploader thanks for the effort, but it gets stuck at saving, and has some other reported glitches, get another one if you can, you will save a blank dvd, time and bandwidth.

@xiIix there are PS2 emulators for PC that run many games, not sure about this one"
,krazr4life,2009-12-07T18:05Z,"Hey jgarret620 could you tell me where you downloaded your GOW 2 torrent. The thing is i have already finished the 1st layer and i only need to play the 2nd layer, which starts at the great chasm. So thanks a lot in advance."
,RiSHBH,2010-03-04T15:28Z,"You will need PCSX2(v0.9.6) or later and GsDx plugin 0.1.5 or later to play this game on your PC.
Full Information Will be uploaded soon including:

,sennasf,2011-07-02T00:31Z,"Perfeito!
Jogo roda perfeitamente. E o melhor: Cria saves normalmente no memory card.

A qualidade dos filmes é bem precária, mas como eu não quero ASSISTIR e sim ME DIVERTIR, isso não influencia em nada!"
