Music from the computer game \'Jazz Jackrabbit\' for the IBM PC.

Original source unfortunately unknown.

This has been converted from Jazz\' internal representation to standard tracker module files (36 ScreamTracker III, one ImpulseTracker), and subsequently been changed to use more sensible names then the internal ones.

If you run UNIX, use the 'mksymlinks.sh' script in 'jj_music' instead of downloading this package. If you do not run UNIX, you might also be interested in 'jj_music', in addition to this package.

Enjoy :^)
