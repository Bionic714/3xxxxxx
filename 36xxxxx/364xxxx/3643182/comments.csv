,ray71,2007-03-20T11:35Z,noen som vil ha adr til en rask/bra torrent side/tracker?? send meg en melding s책 sender jeg en adresse...
,Takster,2007-03-21T05:50Z,"Thanks mate. I will test this out.

As for above poster, do other DVD's you burn work? Do you burn movies okay? Maybe your burner is fucked. Maybe your computer runs hardware vista does not like. Who knows."
,oljepelle,2007-03-21T08:00Z,"Tack,det fungerar till 100%"
,megahurts2006,2007-03-21T08:30Z,"I had to burn my own copy of Vista at 4x - the slowest speed my burner supports, anything faster and the install would fail.  At what point are you getting a BSOD?"
,cprompt100,2007-03-27T10:02Z,I guess this is the clony paradox hack.... I can't get over how well it works compared to the other cracks and patches.. Just to be on the safe side in my case I advanced the BIOS clock during install. That advice abouy the PCI update problem is 100 percent true.  
,ZiQa,2007-04-05T23:31Z,"It works perfect 
Good job uploader"
,Slayer1040,2007-04-07T23:37Z,"there is an easier crack for vista. it doesnt matter what updates you install. everything vista compatible works. much easier,just install vista, download, right click->run as administrator, install, it will say press any key to restart, restart and your done. this works on the vista X86 not on X64.

,blackasian,2007-04-10T03:19Z,"slayer this is not about easer cracks this was about the bsod with nvida chip sets. the paradox crack works great and its super clean, actually its a activation scheme thats 100% safe you will never have to register again. Its for all OEM's and other off the shelf copy's. The only problem i had was the royal.sys bsod and im sure that the old mobo's got a problem with, as for vista its flawless and it runs great all i will need in the future is a new mobo that fully supports vista as for now ill run it as is, some old drivers work as well but you got to have a solid knowledge on editing files. i will try to fix the royal.sys problem as stated here but as for now this works great and its far better than the activation that were on xp corp ill say its about 3-4 steps but most of all its not buggy and wount lock up your system and most of all there are no viruses so guys have fun and thanks to the uploader on this  torrent and the info it provides. cheers ***** "
,elchief,2007-04-24T21:01Z,does this work with any language version ???
