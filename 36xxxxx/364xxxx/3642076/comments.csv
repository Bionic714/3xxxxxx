,Fishyx,2007-04-20T03:54Z,Aaah! Please SEED! The download is at 0 KB/s!!!
,Nozzy,2007-05-06T20:33Z,"thanks MMeltdown.

both TGE and TGEA are great engines, it would be great if you know where one can aquire 3DGPAi1 2nd Ed. and/or A-3DGPAi1 w/ CD's of course :)

anyhow, thank you for providing this torrent, then I'm free of paying just yet and wait and see what I can get out of the Engine(s)"
,Nozzy,2007-05-06T20:34Z,I will email you to notify you of my comment as well as to leave you a mean to get back to me if yo choose
,Fishyx,2007-05-09T02:53Z,wth is this!?!? it says its a demo and i can't find out where i can even create a game! Don't upload crap that u can dload of the website.
,mmeltdown,2007-05-12T03:44Z,"Fishyx: your a dumb mother fucker you know that? The engine is here in its complete form, the demo application that your running is a precompiled version of the engine complete with demonstration content so you can see its capabilities. If you can download the source code (included in this torrent) from the GG site, go for it. But your obviously too fucking clueless to know what your talking about. 

Grab a glock and blow your head off. "
,qribba,2007-05-15T18:54Z,"Nice seed, doesnt seem to work with vista atm though"
,Fishyx,2007-05-19T02:25Z,"Oh.......... I cant find a readme with instructions. Sorries.

P.S.  I'm not old enough to buy a glock and i dunno how to use one... teach me =D"
,Robertz28,2007-06-06T05:45Z,"This files are in your C directory.

Hey meltdown. I am a noob and was hoping to get some information from you.
Are you supposed to compile the files and if so how would I do that? You sound smart so I thought I would ask. I have dev C++ but as I said I am a noob. I can barely make a calculator so far. 

Or are these files used as libraries for game development instead of offering a GUI like the normal torque engine uses?
"
,Robertz28,2007-06-07T13:10Z,"The lack of documentation makes this useless to beginners.

I managed to compile it down to 0 errors but 5 warnings still persist and I can't track down the problems.
When I try and run the debug exe I get the terraindynamiclightingmaskp.hlsl error. Apparently it cannot be compiled for some reason I don't know. Spent too long looking for the answer. Tired of it. 

If you're a beginner, don't waste bandwidth downloading this. Not trying to be rude to the uploaders but it's useless without documentation. The only legit documentation that exists on installing this thing cleanly is on a part of the forum that only liscensed members can get one. Kind of defeats the purpose. "
,elite231,2007-06-23T04:00Z,"hey meltdown could you get te program called ""retail pro 9"" plz"
,Lord_Kain,2007-07-13T13:46Z,"The Engine is the Full Version, however I had the moral duty to write this.

To compile it you need 3 things.

1) Delete the NASM executables in the bin folder for they are virused and cannot be executed by the compiler. Replace them with the NASM executables from the NASM for Windows. Google it.

2) Install OpenAL (an open sound architecture). Without this package it wont compile.

3) Install DirectX 9 SDK latest version.

Then compile :)

Excellent release minus the virus."
,kaffey99,2008-01-28T15:45Z,"Hey im sorry but im not the greatest with c++, but i have gotten it all, but which file in their do i compile? or do i compile all of it?  Thank you."
,UserU,2008-02-24T14:25Z,Is TGEA the same as TGA or it only includes extras to TGA? 
,Gasilli,2008-05-04T23:54Z,TGEA is a better version than TGA with more features than TGA.
,J_Walk,2008-06-12T13:48Z,Why is there only a demo folder? i've been using toque for awhile and tge comes with starter.fps. is it possible to create a full game with just the demo folder?
,J_Walk,2008-06-13T00:46Z,im still not convinced that this is the full engine. I visit the website regularly and they say that the full source code comes with a starter.fpps demo. this only has a demo to it and i cant use the demo from the old folder. If this is the full engine could you please explain it to me if i'm suppose to just modify the demo itself. also are there any better engines that are portable to xbox?
,mattcscz,2008-11-07T16:30Z,can any1 tell me what file to compile with what? thanks
,jemma-83,2008-11-10T18:56Z,"read this book(the entire book) before asking how to make a game.. there are no shortcuts.

Thanks mmeltdown, however I request a later release of tgea if anyone has one? would be nice with complete documentation to it aswell if someone would take the time to rip off their closed forums. (We used to have this engine where I worked however I never really learned it =)"

,rfs88,2008-11-27T20:30Z,how to install mate?
,rfs88,2008-11-27T20:43Z,"why ddin't you just upload the TGEA instead of the source,"
,heedical,2009-01-23T02:47Z,"How do i install this, all it is is links for me. Sorry, i am new."
