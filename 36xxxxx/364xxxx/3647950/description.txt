Sixteen Horsepower's third album, Low Estate, finds the group at the peak of their powers, moving their hypnotic, rustic country-rock into neo-Gothic territory. Producer John Parish helps the group reach their potential, accentuating the darkness and mystery inherent in their music. There are still a few weak moments on the record, but overall, Low Estate is an impressive leap forward for Sixteen Horsepower, and album that clearly separates the band from their alt-country contemporaries.
