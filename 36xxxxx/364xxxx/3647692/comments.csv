,wahr,2007-08-03T08:05Z,does anyone have the new thor anime release of this? (720p subbed?)
,DoniDarko,2008-01-08T08:48Z,"I just recently downloaded this stuff and saw that it is dual audio [it means it has English and Japanese tracks as well as English subtitles]. It isn't just Eng dub. So you can grab it whatever you like it in Eng or Jpn. Anyway this torrent only one that I was able to find through all net which has dual audio, so don't miss your chance to get this. P.S. Just wrote it for the sake of clearness. And by the way: THANKS FOR IT. Wonder would it be possible for someone to upload more stuff done by this group like ""Hare + Guu"", ""Disgaea"" or other which are very hard or even immposible to find in www..."
,DoniDarko,2008-01-08T10:39Z,"Ye... One more thing. About seeding (if anyone is interested,... if not I will tell anyway). I will be able to seed this stuff for couple of weeks (somewhere) about 50-70 kB/s from 10:00 to 14:00 and about 5-20 kB/s from 21:00 to 2:00. If you interested you should orient by Lithuania time [I think it should be about GMT + 2 hours or something about that]. Well thats all. Happy leeching..."
,DoniDarko,2008-01-12T21:27Z,"O.K. I watched it and think can give small review. Audio and video quality is great (well its DVD rip). Animation looks really great. Idea of anime not bad at all, although story itself could be a little better developed. I mean it could be longer, because at some point it seams that it is too much said in a short time. Some parts of it seemed not very good, but overall it is good. Will give 7of10. P.S. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
