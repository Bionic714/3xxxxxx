Nice collection.

All clips in DVD quality ?"
,rogerd,2007-08-09T20:25Z,"@maccower
That would be something, 22hrs of clips... But no, as the description already stated... No clips... just the songs in DD5.1 with a still as background and subtitles to display song details."
,johndoo321,2008-08-21T20:24Z,This is really a great dvd. The quality is perfect!
,beaune,2008-09-10T11:09Z,"Well, just downloaded the thing and was looking forward to hear it.
Unfortunately, however, I didn't manage to extract the archive, it stops at part 7 and is asking for it all the time. It looks as if that part is either damaged or corrupt.
Any chance of having it fixed?
If yes, thanks in advance."

I'd suggest to do a forced re-check on the Torrent from your client. Nothing wrong with the RAR files.

Cheers,
