,wes5656,2010-05-17T03:37Z,"I love movies with drugs in them...

BUT this one is just plain up weird.
Did not like it at all"
,Bizzythizzle,2010-05-22T07:51Z,"this movie is TEN TIMES BETTER than requiem for a dream, given its harsh and view world of the meth counter-culture.

meth is a dangerous drug and i have seen people ive gone to highschool with (im only in my early twenties, mind you) destroyed by this drug, one whom i was close to during my HS years is serving ten years due to this drug.

i think this movie is brilliantly made, and because these are people who are big name actors i think its even more underrated. anybody can put drugs and sex together and call it ""art"" but this isnt art. it mimics as close as can be to the way these people act,think, and hold themselves.

this movie should be shown to at-risk teens who get busted, they should look at what their life will be like. i saw this when it came out and it to this day i havent touched anything that is man-made (cannabis is not man made) 

thank you for this upload man.. i havent seen this movie in years.

also i think imdb has some of the locations wrong, cause there are a couple of places that mimic southern oregon (maybe eugene or farther south), and schwartzmans car is registered to oregon.

im not sure, i just thought i might give my home state some props xD"
