AFter soooo many years of Bill Gates swearing that he would make sure a nuew generation would grow up  not knowing what DOS was. Now Redmond tells us that ther is no recovery console in Vista so now we are back to work in DOS because there are no FAT 32 Vista installations. There is going to have to be more done with this. Right now this start diskette has the system files (but they are FAT32) so I put the NTFS rteader in there. Also another problem is that this diskette is not bootable, donyou will have to use one of those floppies from MAXTOR, or SEAGATE to start the Vista PC and then switch to this diskette at the A-prompt. There is only so much you can do to repair an unbootable VISTA machine by working on it from DOS, but still, you need that option. Right now Redmond talks about running XP repair mode to fix the VISTA machine, but that sounds like VERY LITTLE thought went into what would happen when someone loses their data.....
