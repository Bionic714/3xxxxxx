,deltArate,2007-03-22T18:04Z,"im surprised there is not a better version uploaded yet, a guy at my work had 75 copies of a high quality dvd rip looked like it was straight outta best buy, the audio is crackly on this one"
,GodZeys,2007-03-22T20:06Z,"Yes nice...but by instead the fucking DVD. Because the quality from all these downloads still sucks...This movie is made for home theaters or cinemas...So it must be 100% crystal clear to enjoy it. Otherwise...

About the thing that says ""Xexes had about 100.000 troops i say....Maybe you meant 10.000 instead""?

110.000 were the Greek troops that were gathered at the final battle 1 year later at Plataies...

Repeat. The tiny Greece, gathered 110.000 in a battle and Persians couldnt gather millions of troops? 

Persian empire was expanded from Africa till India and was a union of more than 100 nations. And they could gather only 100.000 troops?

Ok.Are you people retarted or something?
You dont believe the Greek historian Herodotus, dont you have brains to think yourself what is more logical?

Make a fucking true historical review or simply write:

  ""The film is based on the epic nouvele of Frank Miler 300"""
,deltArate,2007-03-23T01:23Z,"shutup godzeys no one cares, this movie was good"
,GodZeys,2007-03-23T14:33Z,"@deltArate 

Did i said the movie is bad? It is the best i have ever seen...dum ass. I am just saying that the introduction of this torrent should be just:

This movie is based on the graphic nouvele of Franks Millers 300"" 

The rest he wrote is just craps

@Phybre1

Maybe your parents are liars that said to you, that you are smart. Maybe you were droped with the head when you were child and your parents didnt told you anything...That makes them Liars. 
Herodotus isnt a liar...

In the battle of Plataies Greeks were 110.000
and the Persians were only 3 to 1...
If Herodotus was such a liar why didnt he said that the enemy had millions troops again?

Smart ass...Listen

10Years Darios was gathering the Persian troops
and training them against Greeks, and later his son Xexes continued his fathers work...

Just to inform stupid uneducated people like you:
Such huge armies had support troops...slaves, animals, whores like you...and so on.

If the main army was 2,5 millions, only the 1 mllion of them were fighting troops, the rest was support troops...

Persian historians wrote that when this army was
sitting to drink water, they could empty a small lake...So during their campaign, they established near villages, conquered towns and so on...

Read fucking History and then start calling liars the historians...uneducated smartasses...

,GodZeys,2007-03-23T18:35Z,"Story teller?

Oh, maybe he wrote 9 books because he wanted to be a director to some movie and not a historian...

He was a Historian you dum ass...All other historical events in his books are extremely accurate...

And because he said that the Persians were millions at the battle of Thermopyle, (Persians themselves were keep saying they are millions) he sudenly became a story teller...

He didnt knew Persian language? You dum ass...
He visited all the world...and he was there at every moment and he was talking and gathering sources from everyone...

Thebeans that were released from Xerxes with the Persian mark on them...they were embarassed to shit...why shouldnt they say what happened the 3rd day of battle...Would they be stupid like you to lie or to make their sittuation even worse?

Furthermore...the word ""Greek scouts"", does it ring a bell to you?

How we know that one of the Spartans named Evritos, fought blind till the end? He lost his vison because of an infection in his eyes...

Herodotus just wrote stories right?

So if 2 million troops including animals will sit and drink from a small lake, the water wont dissapear? 

Persians were keep saying this in order to make the Greek troops to fear them...Maybe it wasnt true...But think you idiot...if every man would drink 1-2 litres of water how much would be required to feed 2 million troops?

Simple mathimatics you fuck head...

I study history you idiot and my proffesors told me that things were like this...that the number together with the suport troops reached more than a million...

And fuckhead, there wasnt only Herodotus who claimed this huge number.

There were historians from Persian empire, Armenian historians and many more...

But our fuckhead knows everything right?
And our modern English gay historians also know everything. Thats why they dont know how many Jews died in WW2...

The numbers begin from 300.000 and reach the 6 million people...

Something that hapened 50 years ago...

Asshole. And you dare to say that ancient historians who lived back then, were saying craps...

Why didnt Herodotus lied about other things and battles as well? And in Thermopyle, the troops of Xerxes also included Macedonians and northern greek cities as well as in the Plataies battle...

Anyway, we are talking now bullshit...we argue about if Persians were 500.000 or 1 million or 2 million troops...Fuck that...You want this to be as it is, then believe watever you want...

The point is that 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians and 400 Thibaians(traitors) fought for 1 day sorrounded and made the Persian gigantic numbers to retreat 4 times...In the end the Greeks died from arrows because even Immortals were afraid to aproach them...

And dum ass...this battle was very important. Because the other greek cities gained more time to gather their forces...
and furthermore, Persians lost a huge number of troops...

Thats all.

,Andrejos,2007-03-24T02:07Z,"Uhm, I'm not much of an historian, but I do know history is considered a science. I do not, however, belive anybody who is the least bit serious in practicing any kind of science uses words like ""dumb fuck"", ""fucking idiot"", ""moron"" or what have you. Let's try to be civil shall we?

As for the lake theory, 2 million troops drinking 2 litres each adds up to 4 million litres. That is exactly 4000 cubic meters of water. As a comparison, a 50 by 25 meters olympic swimming pool with a minimum depth of 2 meters contains 2500 cubic metres. It all comes down to the definition of what is to be considered a lake, then! :)

So, it's a good film then! ;)"
