Wealthy adventuress Cara Loft\'s exotic, erotic adventures take her all over 
the world when she embarks on a quest to find three legendary lost wombs. 
Played by Playboy veteran Lauren Hays, Cara begins her quest after a run-in 
with the nefarious Dr. Scrotus (Roland Lanza), and soon finds herself globe-
trotting--in various states of undress and compromising positions--and 
attempting to elude gorgeous-but-deadly spy Natasha (Antoinette Abbott). With 
higher production values than you might expect and a game, gleeful attitude, 
this spoofy sexcapade is a fun and unpretentious slice of erotica.
