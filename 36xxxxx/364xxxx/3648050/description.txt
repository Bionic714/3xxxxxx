[Description]
 
Let's face it--snakes are cool. Even though most of us don't want to get too 
close to these limbless wonders, we still can't help but find them fascinating, 
and the Discovery Channel lets us explore their world with The Ultimate Guide:  Snakes. Through close-up photography, computer graphics, and interviews with herpetologists, we meet the deadly bushmaster, the mesmerizing cobra, and their poor American cousin the rattlesnake. Learn about odd niches in the animal kingdom as you meet the tiny  blind snake and the giant anaconda, each staking out its own unique territory. Eating, hiding, and reproduction are all important problems, and snakes have found some ingenious solutions. 

So, if you want to learn about snakes up close and personal, but would rather have
a TV screen between you and their fangs, The Ultimate Guide: Snakes is for you.
