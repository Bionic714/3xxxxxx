Overview:	A superb period piece set during the Sino-Russian conflict. As China and Russia's governments are talking peace, traitorous agents on both sides seek war. Enter John Liu ("Dragon On Fire", "Fighting Ace") as a special agent sent to identify who the Russian traitor is, and who his contact is within the walls of the Forbidden City. The only clue he knows of is that the Russian has an exotic snuff bottle to signal to his Chinese contact. Trouble really starts when the traitor is none other than the Silver Fox (Hwang Jang Lee, star of "Drunken Master") himself. The showdown is set.
