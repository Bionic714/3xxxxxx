MIB: The Series was based on the 1997 blockbuster Men In Black and continued where the film left off. This was not without some minor changes. Agent K remained an agent and partner to Agent J. Agent L was moved to the lab inside Men In Black Headquarters. The headquarters itself was no longer under the ventilator building of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, but now at what looked like a disused area under LaGuardia airport. These differences are possibly addressed in one episode of the series, where it is revealed that every so often some writer or Hollywood-type learns of the MIB and makes a movie about them. (In the flashback reflecting the movie shown in this episode, the actors playing K and J much more closely resemble Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.)
