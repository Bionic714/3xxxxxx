"We're not living in a tent right now, but you should know our Matador Records long play debut was written/recorded entirely sleeping under the sky without walls or roofs. We were already living in tents so it wasn't a deliberate act. How did we end up in a tent? Well, we didn't have anywhere else to go, Alabama was far away & Northern California is pricey.... We had read that most folks live over half their lives underneath lightbulbs, so we wondered if that would be our legacy.... always underneath a lightbulb. We appreciate light and want to know more about it. How does artificial light shape your daily mood? How does natural light make you feel? Living in a tent by a stream, we listened to endangered coho salmon swimming upstream when dozing off. A reclamation of what you react to helps to shape your life. If you live in a city, you will react to the design of that city. If you live rurally you are still reacting to some human designs, but they are limited. If you roll a doobie, then you react to a doobie...."
