,Tortured_Soul101,2008-12-11T15:44Z,"Would someone confirm that ""Vol 02, Sharpe's Eagle"" plays correctly. Windows Media Player crashes immediately after it tries to open the file, and Zoom, Quicktime of RealPlayer also can't play it.

Have all correct Codecs, play Vol 01, correctly."

you can find episodes 15 and 16 in NTSC format on usenet , if you dont have an account , u should try it , its definitely worth it

you should hurry cause they're 190 days old and even with giganews they'll expire very soon

,BendegitBran,2009-04-10T00:30Z,"Any subs? I really want this whole series and was downloading the others, but they had Russian subs and I've no idea hot to make those go away, so I thought I'd try these. Also, why's this torrent half the size of the other, and will it make a difference?"
[V],Lindoff41,2009-05-10T09:31Z,There are Sharpe with english subs. Look after Lindoff41
,Bombardem,2009-10-30T17:19Z,"this set of all the seasons has subs too, and its seeding at a decent rate.
