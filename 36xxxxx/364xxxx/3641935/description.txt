Hello Friends 

This is the first release of the new group FASM formed by me and DJ SOOFLET. The purpose of this group is to deliver the highest quality material at the lowest possible space. Of course there are many more people who can claim the same, but how many of them spent last 2 months on 24h/7d commpressing the same material with different compression options? I guess there all only few geeks like us . That`s right folks, we use our special selection of commpresion options to deliver you the highest quality material. Our releases will always have PSNR over 43dB, so you can be sure that FASM always means quality. 
Video is 960x540 X264 512kbps stream 
Audio is DOLBY PROLOGIC 2 coded on AAC HE+PS 32kbps stream
