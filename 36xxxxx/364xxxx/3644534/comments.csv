,Frodge,2007-03-22T01:14Z,"Yes, it is correct. I have zipped with highest compression rate, dunno that this might have some impact on filesize.

However, I can't get this thing seeding. I'm not a regular (read: experienced) uploader, so I have to read the ficking manual again lol :|"
,WinnieXL,2007-03-22T01:19Z,"I checked mine and it is with extra but not interesting stuf. I will try yours and hope you wil read the manual. lol. And hey, thanks for uploading."
,Frodge,2007-03-22T01:39Z,I don't get it working. Stupid something. You have a pm Winnie
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-03-22T15:22Z,"Okay here it goes...:D 

First let kick off with some often used terms.
Client: A client is a bit torrent program. For example µtorrent or Azureus 
Seeds: Users that have 100 % of the file(s). 
Peers: Users that have not completed the file(s). 0?99 % 
Leechers: Same as peers. 
Tracker: A server that handles and stores the torrent files. 

[B]How to upload a torrent in twenty ease steps:[/B]

1. Download and install a torrent client. I have µtorrent from [url]http://www.utorrent.com/[/url]

2. Go to [url]http://thepiratebay.org/[/url] (TPB)

3. On the TPB click the 'register' link to create an account for yourself. And while your there familiarize 
yourself with the site.

4. Make the file you want to share ready for uploading. However in the end zip it!  Up/downloading exe 
files make certain virus scanners go haywire.

5. Start your torrent client. In this case start Utorrent.

6. Click  . You'll notice a dialog screen. 

7. Click  to browse to your file you'd like to share.

8. Under ""Torrent Properties"" make sure you fill out the necessary information and options: 
    -Trackers: [url]http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce[/url]
    -Comments: Leave it empty or fill out with one of your greatest poems.
    -Piece size: auto detect

9. Under ""Other"" check the ""Start seeding""

10. Click 

11. Click 

You're almost done, but you need to tell your [I]Wicked Friends[/I] that you're seeding a new 
torrent/sharing a new file.

12. Go (back) to [url]http://thepiratebay.org/[/url] (TPB).

13. Log-in into your account. Go back to the homepage.

14. Click the ""Upload torrent"" link. you'll see an so called electronic form you have to fill out.

15. Click  to browse tou your newly made [B]torrent file[/B]. It's the file which for example looks 
like FS2004-NAME OF YOUR FILE-RIP.TPB

16. Under ""Torrent name:(if other than file name)"" fill out the the name with which you want it to show up 
in the listings. There's a common use to stick to a naming convention: FS version - Publisher-Addonname-
(RIP/ISO/Repacked EXE) e.g. FS2004 - REALAIR - SIAI-MARCHETTI SF260 2005 V3.0 (RIP).

17. Under ""Category:"" choose ""Games/PC"" from the drop down menu.

18. Under ""Description:"" give a description and/or special instructions.

19. Under ""Enter code from image:"" you fill out the code from the picture. 
N.B. You may sometimes encounter an error saying that the code is wrong. Fill it out again and you're set.

20. Click 

21. Keep your torrent client open until [B]at least one[/B] leecher/peer has the whole file.

22. Take a pint of beer, you'll deserve it...:cheers:"

,dbuster,2007-04-05T14:23Z,Thanks a lot.Any chance of getting the Flying ClubX? 
,nalle7,2007-05-02T15:05Z,"The program (Game) don´t work. It get stuck in the installation where it says ""checking disk"" then after 1 or 2 min. it exit inst. Does any one else have the same problem?"
,Frodge,2007-05-06T02:36Z,"You're the first with this issue, so far I know. Try to download again, mayby some bits & bytes are f*cked up..."
,jpascuas,2007-05-23T11:42Z,Frodge could you please seed it again? 
,th3,2007-05-25T20:23Z,"The FSX update can be downloaded from justflight.com, and it works, no key required since this is a boxed CD version. 

Just as well save yourselves the effort, this pack is terrible, ""free"" isnt enough to make it worth it. "
,Frodge,2007-05-28T01:16Z,"@ jpascuas

Seeding again."
,iridium907,2007-07-23T04:59Z,"Thanks for posting this, but I think it's corrupted. When I try to select one of these planes it shows ""Model not found"". And yes, I did run AeroSelect before starting FS2004. I tried both mounting it with DAEMONTools to install it and decompressing the iso with WinRAR. I've tried repairing the install. I even deleted it and downloaded it again. Any other ideas?"
,Frodge,2007-11-14T00:09Z,"The file I've had upped is as far as I know 100% ok. Maybe another seeder has send corrupted data, I dunno. If you use Azureus, seeders wich sending corrupted data would be automatically banned."
,Anatol_Popow,2008-01-27T16:04Z,REQUEST: Just Flight Flying Club Robinson R44 for fs2004
,HASTYN,2008-02-06T11:53Z,"I support a question about Flying Club R44 Helicopter?
