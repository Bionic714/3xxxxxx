Unbelievable junk."
,Lucky13s,2010-02-04T01:36Z,"its narrated by Christian Slater, you don't like Christian Slater?

Also to note that this is a damn good set of documentaries, saw these on TV years ago, great picture quality, very well animated, great storylines and I think Christian Slater did a good job narrating it, although he did get annyoing sometimes, but who cares, every narrator gets annoying sometimes."

If you don't like it then don't download it."
