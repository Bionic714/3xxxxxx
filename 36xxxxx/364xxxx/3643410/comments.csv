I have a question too... Several Lessons (7,14,21,28,35,42,49 & 56) appear to be missing. I found another copy of this on another site and it was missing the same lessons. I didn't want to invest in the book if the audio files I had were incomplete. Now that I see a second set of files with the same lessons missing I'm thinking that maybe these lessons are only in the book and do not have audio. Does anyone know if this is the case?"

In that series, every seventh lesson is used as a review of the previous lessons, and thus has no audio. I suspect that this series for Spanish is no different. "
