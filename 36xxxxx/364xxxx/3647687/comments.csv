,skowfritt,2007-03-29T20:26Z,"This was a valiant effort but I have encountered some problems. some error messages during desktop warmup, also this will not work with my cd-rw drive and I had to download MFPlat.dll in order to get WMP to work."
[T],Robin86,2007-04-03T06:11Z,This is a very crippled version of Vista made for third world countries. Some of it's limitations are that you can have a maximum of 256 MB RAM installed and only run 3 (or less) applications at the same time.
,gulgulumaal,2007-04-09T19:00Z,"Hey...it works!!...on my Pentium D 2.8 with 1GB RAM and 250 GB HDD.

True...it limits you to having only 3 windows open at the same time (that means 3 windows, 1 belonging to each application...if u have 10 firefox windows open, that still counts as 1 only). 

Normally u wud think that is horribly crippled..but if all u do it browse/chat/watch movies/listen to music, this should be enough.

Other than this issue it works great!!..never asked for any activation though...not sure if it wud stop working one day and ask for product key :P"
,mena_mon,2007-04-15T00:50Z,"""gulgulumaal""

,Windowsvista,2008-04-06T22:14Z,"I think Microsoft don't sell this version pre-installed or something. Because it can't be activated using OEM. So a activation Crack for Windows Vista Starter is not possible right now i guess. If you find something just publish the link here please.

,som99,2009-05-12T21:47Z,"Robin86 - It supports 1GB of ram, keep your facts right."
,smartie77,2009-05-22T00:09Z,"All the features you need at an affordable price :

,ChingChongChang,2010-01-05T21:21Z,"Has anyone figured out how to activate this yet? Ive even tried brute-forcing this for 3 days now and it hasn't worked.

Also does anyone know where to obtain XP starter?

Ive been wanting to try vista starter for a while, and I have to say its fantastic. Installed on a virtual with 1gb ram and 30gb HD, and it was the fastest vista install I've ever seen. Runs very well too. If activation can be figured out this would be fantastic for netbooks, as an alternative to 7 starter."
