,sal,2007-03-18T23:32Z,"i will download and try but,hydros release just keeps loading when you release pegasus from the titans hand,just when you are about to exit the cave,just says loading all the time.
:-)"
,cardboardts,2007-03-18T23:39Z,"Im playing right now, I will report back as soon as I get there."
,cardboardts,2007-03-19T01:45Z,I just freed the pegasus and watched the entire movie and did the flying fighting scene afterwards as well.  So you shouldn't have that problem with this release.
,scottlarsa,2007-03-19T14:13Z,"Will it work to load old saves from the DVD9 version?

I got stuck on the bridge just before Icarus with my DVD9 version"
,viperbo21,2007-03-19T17:42Z,Please SEED!
,cardboardts,2007-03-19T19:02Z,"scottlarsa:  I dont see why it wouldn't work with the other save files.

viperbo21:  Im the only one with the file atm, will take another 12 hours to get another ""copy"" out there so by tomorrow there should be a decent amount of seeders."
,scottlarsa,2007-03-19T19:25Z,Got to Icarus yet with this version?
,cardboardts,2007-03-19T23:13Z,scottlarsa: Just beat Icarus and descended to Atlas.
,scottlarsa,2007-03-20T11:25Z,"Good then i will try your version.

You just burned the copy as it is a i quess..."
,phillyX,2007-03-20T14:42Z,"if this works to the end i'll be spreading it around locally so it won't be lost.

gonna wait for confirmation that somebody completed the game with this version since there has been some problems with users on afterdawn trying to shrink it correctly.. but so far this seems good.

thx man"
,psycho_mike,2007-03-20T19:11Z,plzzz seed gosh darnit / micke krust
,cardboardts,2007-03-20T22:45Z,"There are 87 seeds now should be plenty, also im fighting Zeus, man he's a dick."
,petergriffin20,2007-03-20T22:45Z,When you say the vids are down sampled how much? Are they pixelated? What about game graphics? Sorry about all the questions.
,cardboardts,2007-03-20T23:22Z,Well I'd Guess it would depend on your set up.  Im running on a SDTV and the movies look fine to me.  Almost looks like im steaming them high quality over the net.  Definitely watchable but you can tell that your losing some of the quality.  The gameplay graphics are untouched.  The only thing that was done to reduce this in size was downsample the Full screen movies and compleatly get rid of the widescreen ones.  This is defently the PS2's best looking gameplay.
,petergriffin20,2007-03-20T23:30Z,Thats all I needed to know thanks alot cardboardts. Great upload.
,adol,2007-03-21T07:13Z,I've just burned this version..and i used my save from the old dvd9 version.

Do i have to start the game all over for this version to work? Anyone hade the same problem? Anyone who has got past icarus? What did you do? Please gooood help me=)!
,scottlarsa,2007-03-21T07:21Z,"Thanks alot cardboardts

It works perfekt for me :-D
I loaded the Save from my DVD9 version save and there where no problems.



adol: I had the same problem first, but then i noticed i still had widescreen option on. Check if you have that on and turn it off :p and then restart from the checkpoint"
,scottlarsa,2007-03-21T07:22Z,"oh, and the Video quality is fine"
,adol,2007-03-21T07:29Z,Thank you! You are my hero! I't worked when i turned of the widescreen!=)
,el_rika,2007-03-21T09:47Z,"it works!

i managed to free the horse from the giant's hand ( the previous DVD5 version used to lock up there ) and this version also has no loading times as opposed to the others. 

Good job man ! 10x"

,osvir,2007-03-21T18:29Z,"How about DVD+R and DVD-R?

Does it work with DVD-R?"
,groudyogre,2007-03-21T18:37Z,"So, do you just burn it onto a dvd-r and thats it???"
,cardboardts,2007-03-21T19:10Z,I used the memorex DVD+R's that came with my burner.  Not known to be the best in quality but it worked fine.
,Xiphias83,2007-03-22T21:37Z,Use DVD+R or DVD-R or DVD+RW or DVD-RW they all work!:) Im playing with an old DVD+RW it works fine.....just burn it at a slow speed and it works perfect! Thanks for this UL cardboardts!:)

,chasetown1,2007-05-08T18:30Z,"I've downloaded this for my son, but I don't know how to copy it to DVD. I've got Nero. If I try to copy it as an ISO DVDROM it tells me that it is bigger than 2GB so to use UDF DVDROM.I tried it and nothing plays. I can't get the image file recognised, so I'm at a total loss. I'd really appreciate some help. Thanks."
,Bomis_,2007-05-08T19:31Z,"i jsut wonder if you can play this game anywhere else than in USA, and if you have to do something special please tell me."
,Xinos,2007-05-09T11:52Z,"chasetown1;
See if your Nero has ""SmartStart"" and from that menu you can find ""Burn image file"".

Or you get Alcohol120%.."
,chasetown1,2007-05-09T19:29Z,"Thanks for the reply. I've done as you suggested with Nero. It still can't ""see"" the image file though.
I've got Alcohol 120%. I've never used it. Is it better than Nero for this type of thing? Any tips on how to go about it appreciated. Thanks."
,chasetown1,2007-05-09T19:42Z,I've just tried using the image burning wizard on Alcohol and it does not support the image file. Could I just burn it as a UDF data file on Nero? I've got 4 different versions of this game and I can't work out how to copy it. I've tried a UDF once before and it was no good. Thanks.
