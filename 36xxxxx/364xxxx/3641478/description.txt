Overview:	Excellent traditional kung-fu film starring three of the legends of the Jade screen in one of the legendary films. Northern Leg (John Liu - who else?) travels across China to find the man responsible for the death of his parents. The culprit is none other than the Silver Fox (Jang Lee), a feared martial arts expert who also has a sideline in bullion robbery. The said bullion is of particular interest to another avenger, a government law enforcer known as Southern Fist (Wong Tao). However, the two heroes do not exactly hit it off and become rivals over the love of a local woman. They do discover, though, that although they are both highly skilled fighters, alone they are no match for Silver Fox. Begrudgingly, but knowing that it is the only way to gain success against this awesome foe, the two combine their skills. With bootwork and fists united, they now face their bitter enemy.
