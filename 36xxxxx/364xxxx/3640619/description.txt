Les petites fugues is a marvellous movie. It's theme is serious, it's tone is light. The principal person of the movie is an old farmhand on an isolated farm in Switzerland. He buys himself a moped and along with it freedom (and not only) of movement. At first he enjoys his freedom, but later on he discovers that he cannot handle it very well. Strong points of this movie are : - The acting of Michel Robin - Many scenes are very hilarious, for instance the driving lessons; the party at the motor races etc. - Beautiful camerawork; in one instance even stunning. When the farmhand makes his first trip on his own the camera follows him in "birdsview" and by enlarging the distance the landscape opens up more and more thus symbolising in a convincing way the freedom he has gained. - The movie is very likable. Here in the Netherlands we can receive about 20 channels which broadcast movies. I cannot remember that this movie has been programmed in the last 10 years. I cannot understand why such a nice and accessible movie gets so little attention. It made me wonder if it's still available; many "Filmencyclopedies" don't mention it anymore. I'm glad I found it in the IMDB
