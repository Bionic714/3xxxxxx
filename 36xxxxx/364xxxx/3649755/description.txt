|Sixteen candidates, two eagle-eyed advisors and one self-made millionaire.|*
|Sir Alan Sugar is back to test the nerves and brains of the hungriest     |*
|hopefuls in the business world.                                           |*
|                                                                          |*
|Yes, The Apprentice is back and we will see the candidates compete to win |*
|a six-figure salary job and the chance to become Sir Alan Sugar's         |*
|apprentice.                                                               |*
|                                                                          |*
|Over twelve weeks the candidates will take part in the                    |*
|toughest recruitment-drive on television. As Sir Alan says, "this is a    |*
|job interview from hell...."                                              |*
|                                                                          |*
|Sharing a luxury townhouse in a fashionable part of London, they will be  |*
|split into two teams and given a weekly task with which to expose their   |*
|entrepreneurial abilities.                                                |*
|                                                                          |*
|For those on the winning team a taste of the executive lifestyle awaits in|*
|the form of a luxury treat. For the losing team, they will discover that, |*
|unlike his name, Sir Alan Sugar is not so sweet.                          |*
|                                                                          |*
|The losing team's project manager must choose two members of the team whom|*
|he or she thinks performed worst to accompany him or her back into the    |*
|boardroom.                                                                |*
|                                                                          |*
|The three of them have to defend their respective corners whilst Sir Alan |*
|and his trusted advisors, Margaret Mountford and Nick Hewer decides which |*
|of them will hear the words they dread: "You're fired".                   |*
|                                                                          |*
|Over the nail-biting journey the candidates will endure and enjoy         |*
|(at times), a fight for survival. Only one of them can win so be prepared |*
|for plenty of sour-grapes along the way...                                |*
