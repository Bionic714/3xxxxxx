,mike18xx,2007-03-27T10:04Z,"Because you're trying to play it with shitty Microsoft software, that's why."

,dlpcruzer,2008-11-18T05:51Z,"Hey Mike18xx

Thanks for the Upload...really.

But in your comments to Lord_Herman a year and a half ago (which I just now read)...you pushed one of my buttons.

Microsoft software may be shitty (as you put it), that can be debated until the end of time.  BUT, you cannot deny that over 90% of the entire world's computers run on Microsoft.   Until that changes and if you really want to SHARE with a big percentage of the world...  Well,  I think you get the point.

So what is the alternative?  Mac?  Gee...they are essentially Microsoft also?  And if you have something against Bill Gates coz he stole the original DOS OS from the CP/M OS and Digital Research and the first version of Windows from Apple.  Didn't Jobs and Wozniak (of Apple) manipulated and stole their early designs from HP and Wang?

Linux?  Hahaha... most of the world doesn't really know a thing about computers and software to really be able to operate Linux.  Hell, I remember the early days of Linux when you had to write your own video drivers for XWindows because video card manufacturers (at that time) refused to release their specs.  The last version of Linux I used was Redhat 6, and you still had to manually mount floppy drives and CD/DVD drives. 

You have to give Microsoft some credit as they have allowed people who don't know a damn thing about how a computer operates and have made a consistent menuing system (with their apps and all microsoft certifed apps) such that any monkey can operate it without really understanding the technology behind what is really going on.

Or...do you remember the days when WordPerfect cost $499, Lotus 123 cost $499?  Then along comes Gates and puts Excel and Word into one package (Office) for $499.  Kind of like the guy that said ""Hey, let's slice the bread before we sell it""

The button you pushed is simply...I can't stand computer snobs.  Most think they know a lot about computers...that maybe so, but usually they don''t, and they rarely know one iota about business and the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of the technology they hold so dear.

As far as the Microsoft virus attacks and such goes...hey...if 90% of the computers were running Macs...then the same people hacking and creating viruses for MS would instead be doing on the Macs.  If 90% were using Linux, again the same.

Look at what happened to SCO (of SCO-Unix fame)  a few years back?  They tried to sue Redhat and Linus Torvalds for certain pieces of code that they claim were stolen.  The result would have been that there would be no more ""free"" Linux anywhere.  That weekend, hackers shut down SCO's entire corporate computer network.  It took SCO almost 2 weeks to completely fix their network.  I actually was living in Santa Cruz, California at the time, and had a couple of friends working at SCO (Santa Cruz Operations).  I was working nearby for ""the"" major hard drive manufacturer on their Global Client-Server Architecture team....that is, I was responsible for the operation of 30,000 plus computers world wide.

Now if you want to discuss server Operating systems, Novell's Netware has ALWAYS been the most SECURE ""out of the box"", meaning...no tweaking needed.  Linux and UNIX can be as secure, but one has to really know a lot about what goes on inside the OS(s) in order to make it as secure.  But Netware is no longer able to compete with Microsoft, and they are almost dead.  The learning curve for UNIX and Linux is just too steep for mediocre administrators.  Microsoft is relatively easy.  

In conclusion, if your movie rips and soundtracks do not work with the most popular Microsoft OS products (namely Windows Media Player, Winamp and VLC) then maybe you should have stated that in your comments when you uploaded the file.  THE result would have been very very few people downloading your upload.  "
