,bungiefan,2007-03-27T11:08Z,"I'm on a wireless network. I'm seeding as much as my can when my connection doesn't drop out. If it drops while I'm at work or asleep, it stays offline until I get back to fix it. Have patience. I didn't upload this with the intent to not put at least one full copy out."
,loyalbabus,2007-03-30T20:40Z,I'll seed after I finish leeching. Very interesting and likely unlicensed.
,bungiefan,2010-03-25T05:17Z,"Well, my hard drive crashed and I lost these. I'll redownload and reseed if someone else still has the files to seed them back to me. Contact me on this name on AIM if you're going to reseed."
,Elena_Kiske,2010-11-02T16:50Z,Does anyone have a full copy? Seed please! It's a great torrent don't let it die

Had to upload it to a different tracker after reripping it. Increased the quality from 128 kbps to 192.
