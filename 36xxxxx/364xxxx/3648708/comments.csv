,FSPlayer,2007-03-27T15:57Z,"Request CLS DC10
Team Leonardo Maddog

Thanks!!"
,Jackio,2007-03-27T16:37Z,Why upload something thats already up? Try check things like that before uploading...*sigh*
,krutan,2007-03-27T18:29Z,"This is pretty useless IMO, you can't do anything except use it for gliding, it doesn't even have a launch function."
,panos95,2007-03-28T16:37Z,I agree with you. Captainsim this time failed to make me happy with this add-on. It's just ballshit!
,Horatio85,2007-03-28T22:15Z,"That`s why i don`t buy CS aircrafts :D

-H"
,shmuckhead,2007-03-29T15:21Z,"Jackio,

I think anyone who uploads anything should be thanked. It's possible the other CS Shuttle torrents are dead or just very slow.

Thanks Panos95!"
,tu154,2007-03-30T13:14Z,"Can someone share serial for CLS A300-600R, A310, A340-500 and DC-10? Thanks!"

,Panodilo,2007-03-31T21:39Z,Req: Captain Sim Airport Shuttle
,Jackio,2007-04-07T20:31Z,"@ schmuckhead

Ofcource, all uploads should be thanked. I did that misstake to the first time I uploaded. But then people told me the same thing I said here. It was not ment as an angry frustration post.

And about the otherone being dead: I am seeding it, and been doing so since one hour after it was uploaded."
