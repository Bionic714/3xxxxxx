,andy160676,2007-03-26T01:14Z,catfish have been known to last a long time out of the water and any caring angler will return the fish with minimal stress to it and use a WET unhooking mat and have a pan of lake water close by to wet the fish from time to time and if its pissing it down like most of the time in the uk that keeps it wet and very little harm is caused to it and returned for futre genarations to catch as they have a long life span.so in most anglers eyes the fishes welfare comes first
