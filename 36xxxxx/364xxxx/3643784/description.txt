Amazon.co.uk Review
Into Vision is a passable enough "greatest hits revisited" collection from the Trevor Horn/Anne Dudley/Paul Morley supergroup Art of Noise, whose millennial reunion was said by some to have been the grumpiest since that of the Velvet Underground. The main visual element is concert footage from four performances, two of which took place in the USA (there's one unintentionally--or is it?--hilarious shot of the band looking out over a sea of bucket hats) and two in London. This is subjected to various arty cut-and-paste editing tricks which perhaps compensate for what would otherwise have been a rather static visual experience, although that might have been preferable to the sight of Morley galumphing pointlessly around the stage like Bez's dad. No matter, though, because the music's excellent, with no shortage of faves like "Moments in Love".
On the DVD: Into Vision also has plenty of other material, including a rather strident snapshot performance of Dudley playing some Debussy in a somewhat Wakemanesque, session-veteran fashion, some rehearsal footage which certainly belies the rumours of tensions within the relaunched band (witness Dudley seguing yet another dollop of Debussy into the Postman Pat theme, to the amused consternation of singer Amanda Boyd). There's also a band interview which Morley hi-jacks by acting like a twat throughout. Still pretty good, though.--Roger Thomas
