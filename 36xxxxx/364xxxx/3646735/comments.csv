,BoogieJay,2008-10-29T15:08Z,"This is AWFUL! I'm into a lot of different styles of electronic music, but this just sonds like some ADD kids in their basement. The funny thing is, the intro says it all when he says, ""I wonder what came first, the shitty music or the drugs?""
This album is pure crap. I listened to every song and deleted it immediately. What a waste of space and time..."
