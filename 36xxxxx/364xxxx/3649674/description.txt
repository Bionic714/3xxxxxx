Editorial Reviews

With their fourth album, thrash heroes Static-X head back to the future of metal as Start A War marks the return of original producer Ulrich Wild and original guitarist Koichi Fukuda, both of whom were instrumental in the success of the band\\\'s platinum debut Wisconsin Death Trip. Unrelenting and uncompromising, Static-X elevate their bone-crunching hard rock to a new level of earth-scorching destruction.
