,RamboUlf,2008-02-09T20:55Z,Seeda! Detta är ta mig sjutton den enda sesong 7 häromkring som jag har användning av så jag stör mig på att vara fast på 5.6%.

,jerseygirl,2008-07-17T09:22Z,Pleeeease seed! I want to load this! Please!
,alornmage,2008-08-11T02:08Z,"PLEASE seed. I'm 134 megs from complete and missing the beginning of almost every file, so I can't even watch partials. "
,seanoss34,2008-08-13T02:20Z,try mininova instead. i found this there with actual seeders.
,haddimann,2008-08-18T05:59Z,"I seem to be the only one uploading here... OK, I've got 98,2%, then it stopped downloading because I had no seeders. If this can be seeded, I will be happy to upload this for 2-3 months just as a gratitude....

Best regards,
Haddimann"
,tokodiak,2008-08-26T00:31Z,Can someone seed.  I am almost done but stuck at 98%.
,exQuse,2008-08-27T21:57Z,"I have exactly the same haddiman, stuck at 98,2. Only the first episode complete, the rest almost.

Someone nows a way to download the remaining files with mininorva torrents? That would be better then downloading 7,5 Gb all over again."
,exQuse,2008-08-30T11:57Z,"I'm seeding but I dont have the last 1,8%. Someone with complete file PLZ SEED"
,DrDee,2008-09-19T08:52Z,Can somebody tell me how I can get the last of this torrent. I have 99.2% downloaded.  MilkChocolik@aol.com  
,farmerrr,2008-09-24T18:53Z,"Please seed for around 2 minutes so someone can finish the download and then seed for others? greatly appreciated

Seed please."
[T],towerelect,2008-09-25T17:46Z,This would appear to be Series 6 NOT 7 and is available on the Demonoid site where a Ratio counter and strict policing actually forces people to behave properly and stay seeding a torrent until they have given back to the swarm more than they took :)   Rigmar Radio
,Pergar,2008-10-02T00:28Z,"Finns hela någonstans? Många verkar vara fast på 99,2%. Kom igen och seeda nu, tack"
,obayshechka,2008-10-13T19:57Z,"My dear friend! Could you please seed this torrent just half and hour... We all have 99,3% and nothing more :-(
Help us! Please!!!

,vanderman,2009-03-02T06:04Z,Please Seed! I have been stuck needing 4MB for almost 3 weeks! I will seed for at least 2 weeks once I finish.
,nastyrash,2009-06-06T10:24Z,what kind of sicko leaves up only 99.9%?!? I just need 2mb's to finish off eps 17-19. All the rest are there. A sad world we live in.
,stho16,2009-07-14T02:27Z,"wow. what a dickweed. leaving us hanging at 99.9%.

seriously dude, wtf? why even upload it at all if its not the whole thing?"
,mari0ndrew,2009-07-23T18:08Z,"Anybody able to seed the final portion of this?  If anybody has a full copy available, and wouldn't mind putting it up, I'll keep mine up for a while."
,straw05,2009-11-14T14:53Z,Everyone is stuck @ 99.9% - please please please seed. 
,davecabezo,2010-06-14T21:46Z,"What the F**k is going on, why does someone upload a torrent that is incomplete. It has nothing to do with seeding as everyone is stuck at 99.9% because the uploader only uploaded 99.9%.
The only way we can get out of this S**t is if someone on Pirate bay has the episodes Season 7 E17,18 & 19. If you have these episodes please upload them and we can then seed to complete what up to now has been a complete waste of time.

MRASKER what a towrag. I hope that one day I can repay you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Bigroller70,2011-03-08T17:04Z,I'm stuck at 99.9%! Please seed!!! Please!!!
