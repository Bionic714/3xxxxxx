,Hairy1305,2007-03-24T09:10Z,"Quality of the film looks great, thanks.  But I have no sound; could someone please explain to a newbee how this is so?"
,Hairy1305,2007-03-24T13:53Z,"Thanks, a bit quiet on the PC, but good none the less.  thanks for the advice guys.  

What's good form for seeding; should I seed ad infinitum or for a certain while?  I always try and seed to at least twice my upload amount but have no real idea what should be best?

Once again, thanks from a newbee!"
