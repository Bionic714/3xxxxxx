,ThaBuG6667,2007-03-18T22:59Z,"Its out on NForce, so this is the real shit :)"
,Ducky511,2007-03-19T00:04Z,"I have never seen a file download this fast, and I've been torrenting since the half-life 2 leak! 2 seeders 30 leaches, and 145kb pull down.

I'm at 700mb downed

and 200mb upped!

I should have the hole thing by later tonight! So Stoked!

Do your part to make sure everyone who wants this can keep getting it. Keep your file open after you finished for at least a day or 2. I'm probaly going to leave mine open all week!"
,Ducky511,2007-03-19T00:06Z,"I have been this excited about a file since doom 3. I remeber when it first hit the torrents. I finaly finished it downloading it 3 hours before midnight that night. I don't think I slept a wink that night.

Wish I could play this all night long. But got a damn final."
,Gelvin,2007-03-19T00:19Z,bah its not good to be exicted :P its leaves room for dissapointment :P hehe but ive waiting for this game for many years as well =)

,DonToejam,2007-03-19T13:56Z,"What a F***!!! I've waited this game for long long time and now i've installed it and it's asking me about some crackfile which i haven't founded on the disc.....

,Memor,2007-03-19T15:54Z,"Hmm doesn't start. XR_3DA.exe just starts to the processes but nothing else happens. Is this fake or just my computer screwing around.

I have 3800+, 2gb ram and 6600Gt. Newest Nvidia drivers."
,DragonFirex,2007-03-19T16:07Z,For me the game freezes very ofthen but runs nice if not for those freezes. Have no idea whats causing them. Im assuming abit buggy release :P
,DragonFirex,2007-03-19T17:33Z,Seems to have something to do with the Lighting effects in the game. Took them away and it works fine. Too bad i cant use them since my comp could certainly handle them but i guess the game aint that polished since it chrashes so much while using them.
,mEsiah_za_one,2007-03-19T17:44Z,"Can someone confirm this ir the real deal and it works???? I've started the download, worked super (180 kb?s)until 0.2 % ;) after that started with 10 kb/s !! Is there a problem or something?

,mEsiah_za_one,2007-03-19T17:51Z,"PLs peolple , share dont put ure upload rate close 2 0.Torrents is all about sharing, u get something but u have 2 give something back.I'm dld with 10 and uploading with max.......shhitt"

,gorcorps,2007-03-20T01:01Z,"I've been bouncing around all day from 30-80 kbps... which isn't bad compared to most new torrents.  If this keeps up it'll be done early enough tonight to get some play time in, and I'll be seeding the hell outta this one."
,mEsiah_za_one,2007-03-20T12:59Z,"ok i see this is the real  deal but what are this problems some people have?im at 60% (in 18 hrs) and ive uploaded with double download speed(is kinda Shitty thing)but no problem.I hope i dont download this and it will not work.


PS seed seed seed ;)"
,Ducky511,2007-03-20T16:34Z,"Works fine for me, besides the screen locking up for a couple seconds once and a while I'm really enjoying it.

I've been seeding since I finished downloading and will probably continue to seed for the next couple of days. I suggest the rest of you do as well.

Anyone else see the irony about ""sharing"" a game that came out of a former soviet controlled territory?"
[T],Knaster,2007-03-20T20:09Z,No Ducky (USA?) we dont see the irony!!?
,mEsiah_za_one,2007-03-20T20:20Z,"i was shure someone from russia or close will find  Ducky511's comment a little bothering ;), doesn't matter from where the game cames  if it is  good ,I personaly waited 4 STALKER since 2004, and watched ""GSC Game World""  progress and i  think theyve done a awsome job. ;)"
,mEsiah_za_one,2007-03-20T20:21Z,PS  I liked Knaster's  own irony  ;) ;)  quote: No Ducky (USA?) we dont see the irony!!?
,jetyykje,2007-03-21T00:43Z,"please help me... i dont know what to do...after that i installed the game its asking me for the serialnr??? and if i skip that part and continue without the serial,,, a window appears ""wrong cd.....""

lol ya exactly. Only an yankee would think sovjetunion or communism means sharing (that's just cheap propaganda for the weakminded ^^). it's just as evil as capitalism ^^! 
It just felt like he was from USA :)"
,mEsiah_za_one,2007-03-21T19:40Z,"lolz. this is a good release 2.ive downloaded it yesterday and now am seeding (50 kb0 ;) because its my max sorry for that.u dont need a high end pc for this game. i have athlon 64/2800+, 1 gb RAM samsung(server edition CL 2.0 ECC) motherboard ASUS k8vx , HDD Seagate s-ata 160 gb, and nVidia 6600 GT/128MB Gddr3 128 bits and im play'n in high detail(only antialising is close 2 o ;) 
On low detail i believe it will work even on a 5600128MB;128 bits :)"
[T],Knaster,2007-03-22T01:24Z,yeah you dont need a supercomputer an average will do.
,Sly_G,2007-03-22T20:38Z,"At the iP4 2.8 HHz, 512 RAM, ATI Radeon 9600XT 128mb video - this game is no-go.

You have to have over 1 Gb RAM, and I think at least 256 mb of video ram."
,mEsiah_za_one,2007-03-22T21:16Z,"Overall the game is super i like its iversity,but there are some minor 2007 must's like havin' feet when lookin down or hands when climbing a ladder, but i hope a patch will soon be released 2 fix some of its problems."
,snow32,2007-03-25T19:22Z,can someone tell me why it is saying the disc could not be found or authenticated?
,snow32,2007-03-26T02:23Z,"when i play the game no graphics... walls, sky, land etc. can someone help me out?"
,excizt92,2007-05-05T10:25Z,"how do u solve the problem with the page file, and whats the cdkey ? :S"
