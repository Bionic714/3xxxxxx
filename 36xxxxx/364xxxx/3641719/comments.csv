,steelcityroller,2008-02-03T09:26Z,"joe rogan surprised me too when i started watching his stand ups on youtube.  

He does a routine about fear factor thats hilarious.

Check the related standups videos as he makes fun of everything from religion to aliens, war and politics, Rogan is highly intelligent and has a lot more to say then a few lines that fear factor paid him a ton of cash to say.  

he's good stuff, give him an unbiased chance. :)"
,freak103,2008-02-26T00:10Z,Absolutely the best!!!
,dexterriley,2009-06-21T19:52Z,did anyone get an uncut edition of his spike tv special  talking monkeys? they censored the fuck out of it. whats the point of haven Rogan do a special when the dicks in the booth butcher his material. the funny thing is it aired after a UFC event. American TV is baffling to me. Bloodbath ok. naughty language baad. fucked up for supposed land of teh free home of the brave.
,item9,2009-08-23T15:58Z,"UFC sucks, but Joe Rogan is funny. If you want a real fight watch Boxing. Instead of a couple Pansie's half naked holding each other in a cage. Seriously They should just film bar fights MMA my ass. Nothing mixed about it lol just pure old fashioned ass grabbing."

You are FAST becoming a minority.
Boxers only Box.
MMA fighters have to do:-
Boxing, Wrestling, Ju Jitsu, Karate etc.
What is more entertaining ?
Boxing ? NOT !!"

,kneebutt,2010-03-17T10:07Z,"No one cares if you like boxing more than UFC.  This isn't twitter.  Perhaps I shall return to leave a useful comment about the quality of this download as no-one else has, or perhaps just to remind you all that gingavitis is the leading cause of tooth decay.  At least that would be A USEFUL FUCKING COMMENT...."
,NewWorldOrphan9,2010-11-08T06:40Z,Thank you! Joe Rogan is a riot! Ari Shaffir is funny also! THE AMAZING RACIST = ARI SHAFFIR!
