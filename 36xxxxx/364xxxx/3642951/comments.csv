,wbeastly,2007-03-21T14:49Z,lots of music post requests here
,peter5112,2007-03-21T20:42Z,is this the complete discography?
,wbeastly,2007-04-07T20:54Z,no
,henryt,2007-10-06T12:13Z,"The torrent says ""7 albums - mp3"", but only ""Motion Sickness"" is in MP3 format (at 160kbps). The rest are in fucking WMA format. Still, the MP3s are decent and are tagged properly, and the album art is there, thank you for that. Seriously though - quit it with the fucking zip files, and don't say they're MP3s when they're not."
,NinjaRyu,2008-03-11T06:25Z,"god I hate wma files. But whatever.

And this is not complete, either.

But it's the jist. Thanks for the up, none the less."
,kamakaize12,2008-05-13T02:51Z,"wtf are you complaining about convert it!
"
,mickeyspentcold,2008-08-25T06:15Z,fuck all you people who are pissed they are wma format.  get a fucking converter.  this person took the time to create this for all you ungrateful fucks
,bgarrett,2008-08-29T05:41Z,Why is this labeled as a discography? It most certainly is not! Bright Eyes has tons more albums than these seven.
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2009-06-06T06:13Z,"Thanks for participating in sharing but you need to label your torrents properly to earn more respect. One, the files aren't all MP3. Two, it's not a discography. Three, when you convert a .wma file to .mp3 I believe some quality is lost. So for those of you saying don't complain and convert it maybe some complain because the quality goes down. Thanks for the share though. =]"
