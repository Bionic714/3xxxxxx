,MystikIncarnate,2007-03-27T14:07Z,"helps that you were fourth or fifth to up this episode, and that every other copy of this file is 300mb...

you ever think theres a reason behind why people do what they do?"
,pinuppamig,2007-03-27T14:26Z,"he he, ok......"
,fghog54903e,2007-03-27T14:32Z,"@MystikIncarnate: What are you even talking about? How stupid can someone be? You now how reading works? Thinking? So, look at the title, do you recognize any difference to the other torrents of this episode? Yes? 720p? What could that be? Do you really think, this is just 1.1GiB big without a reason? I'll explain it to you: This is the new episode of 24 in 1280*720 resolution (and not interlaced by the way, that's what the 'p' for progressive stands for). This is real HD. So it looks way better than this 300MB crap you're talking about. Especially if you've got the adequate display or TV. So, yes, there are reasons, you just seem to be to stupid to understand them or to think and do research before posting.

@pinuppamig: Thank you very much for uploading, for this one and all the ones before. I love these 720p torrents. They are the future and I think it's very sad, that it's supposed to be your last."

,Fenix always now,2007-03-27T20:31Z,"big thx to you, uploader"
,manny7087,2007-03-28T07:32Z,thank you pinup...i love these 720p uploads..you saved me from missing this episode
,ale_cyn,2007-03-28T10:31Z,"Thanks a lot! Your ""24"" releases are far the best quality I've seen. I am delighted by the huge size of your TVRip (I'm sure all the other leachers are as well, although they don't bother thanking [like it's too much to ask for]).
Plus it's the only way I can watch the show in my country (and if it's in a higher resolution like yours, even better). Thanks from Argentina!"
,jiiim,2007-03-28T11:26Z,Ty! Keep em coming! ^^
,sgtpeppers2001,2007-03-28T14:09Z,Thanks for this file.  Do you need special HD software/monitor to play this file though?  The video hangs up sometimes.
,LEON1566,2007-03-28T17:38Z,thx uploader . very good job
,MrRaggy123,2007-03-29T18:58Z,Thanks for this one and all the ohers before! Great work. I`ll relly miss your uploads if you quit.
,MystikIncarnate,2007-03-31T23:01Z,"fghog54903e: thanks for the lesson i didn't need... i'm fully aware of the naming scheme and the inherent difference between the ""i"" and ""p"" labelling. kthx.

i'm pretty sure you can take your ""better than thou"" attitude and shove it.  I'm not sure where you're going to enjoy this video beyond the comfort of your own chair, because i dunno too many people who've shelled out the nearly thousand bucks for a blu-ray burner... lol.

are you wiring your computer right up to your HDTV? is that whats going on? if so, you're a minority. few even have HDTV sets, nevermind the need for 720p anything.  i agree, HD is great, but it's still not widely implimented. and for those of use that ""settle"" with DVD's standard 480p... we'll stick to our 300MB ""crap downloads"" kthxbai."
,195299,2007-04-01T04:13Z,"Well 99% have their PC wired up to a device with HDTV resolution - their monitor and more and more of them are widescreen as well.
In fact I think the minority burn the torrents to disc and watch them on a TV.

Cheers pinup, looks just great :-)"
,MystikIncarnate,2007-04-01T07:53Z,"well, 195299, i'd agree, that most have some kinda monitor that can handle the res. though to me, the cost of spending 3-4 times the time to get the same thing, only a bit bigger in resolution, isn't really worth it... i'll only ever be able to watch it here, at my computer...

to me the value is in making 480p, standard DVD revisions of the episodes that i can subsequently archive, or transport to other locations where i can enjoy these shows with friends...

to each their own. my observation is that it's rather large... perhaps with some fancy compression work, that could be lowered, but i'm not sure everyone would be happy with the result.  regardless. enjoy it. i'm not sure what the fascination is, but i don't need to."
,robban1983,2007-04-07T04:09Z,"Pinuppamig: thanks!

MystikIncarnate:
this version is encoded with a much more size-efficient codec (h.264) than the other smaller versions! The quality is simply superior.
1.1 gb versions in h.264 for TV series like 24, Lost & heroes etc has become the new hi-quality standard. If you don't have the equipment to handle it, then use the smaller versions with less quality instead of complaining of hi-quality releases."
