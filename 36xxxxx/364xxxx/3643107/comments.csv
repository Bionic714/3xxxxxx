,newtricious4u,2009-04-13T09:41Z,"I have downloaded it but dont know how to watch it. With the movies that i usually get from here there is usually an avi file to open and watch with windows media player, but i have no avi files in this download. Do i need a different program to watch these?"
,din27,2010-05-07T06:36Z,you need to just burn the video_ts folder to a dvd and try in your dvd player... It works fine... If not open any of the file (look for the size)...
