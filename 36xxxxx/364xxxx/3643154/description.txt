'Speaking For Trees: A Film by Mark Borthwick' centers a nearly 2-hour long film of Cat Power playing solo outdoors in the countryside. The experimental filmmaker and visual artist shot it from a great distance in gloriously grainy color, and recorded with all the ambient sounds of nature. This cinema verite piece, in the tradition of Warhol and Wiseman, is a fascinating document.
