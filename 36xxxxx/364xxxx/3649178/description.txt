    SYNOPSIS/PLOT: 

In a mystical forest in his homeland of Alagaësia, a young farm boy named Eragon (Edward Speleers) discovers a gorgeous and rare blue stone. To get himself and his poor family through the harsh winter, Eragon hopes to trade it in for some food supplies. To his astonishment, a spectacular dragon hatches from what was not a stone, but rather an egg. Until now, the dragon?s race was thought to be extinct and the boy realizes that he has stumbled onto a discovery of legendary proportions. He names the hatchling Saphira and quickly bonds with the amazing creature. However, his simple life is shattered overnight when his family is brutally murdered by the dark forces that roam the kingdom. Guided by an elderly storyteller named Brom (Jeremy Irons), with only an ancient sword for a weapon, Eragon learns of his destiny as a Dragon Rider. In a land shrouded in war between humans, elves, dwarves, and other beings, Eragon and Saphira search for their role in bringing peace to the politically and socially unstable empire. Their greatest enemy will be the wicked King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), a former Dragon Rider, who chose a life fueled by evil, greed, and power and destroyed the legendary Dragon Riders that once protected Alagaësia. Eragon may be the kingdom?s final hope.
