Synopsis:
Though it is among neither his best nor his most consequential works, Hasta la Victoria Siempre is nonetheless one of the most exemplary films of Santiago Alvarez's prolific career. The brief film, completed in October of 1967, concerns the circumstances that led to Che Guevara's death at the conclusion of his failed Bolivian guerrilla campaign. It is a pure distillation of the highly unusual conditions of production that shaped Alvarez's filmmaking practice.[Travis Wilkerson@sensesofcinema]
