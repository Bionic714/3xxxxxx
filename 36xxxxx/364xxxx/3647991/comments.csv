,AndyMroes,2008-12-11T02:51Z,"The reason it comes up as a burning program is that isos are images of the disk so the burning program thinks its being ""intuitive"" and wants to burn the cd. Just download Daemon Tools and mount the cd instead http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?catid=5&mode=ViewCategory"

i downloaded daemon tools and i succeded to open the movies and it shows me like ""menu "" with options
i click on install and then movies close ad it doesnt install
what should i do ??"

,Acidyen,2009-04-02T07:44Z,"For those needing a serial key, don't download a CD generator or anything like that. Just use:
ANPK-GNJH-A4ZZ-KKZ7-2993
Hopefully it still works. If not, I usually get mine from serials.ws or any other website that shows them without requiring a ""Download.""

As for the CD issue, use daemon tools to mount it as a virtual drive and run it while you play the game, then un-mount it when you are done. Alternatively find a no-cd crack."
,shuknight,2009-04-12T02:09Z,"Hey everyone who has the Movies Has Encounter a Problem and needs to close, or if the Movies quits after the ATI splashscreen, I have a solution.  Go to your Movies disk, or the mounted image, and go to setup/data/data.  Then, copy the FONTS folder.  Then go to where you installed The Movies, like for me its D:\Program Files\Lionhead Studios Ltd\The Movies.  Then, go into your data folder, and paste the fonts folder in there.  The Movies should work now."

u have to replace the original exe file with the cracked version, not just run it off the iso file"

How do you do that? Replace the exe. file? Because when I try deleting/pasting/etc - I can't?

When I try running the exe. file in the crack folder, I get the error problem 2short99 says he gets. :( Please help, it's all mounted on Daemon, but I can't play anything!? 

Thanks! "

You copy and paste the crack into the program files folder after you install it..."
,dako93,2009-10-04T14:43Z,"thanks Acidyen for the serial and thanks to Night-Hawk1987  for the game, it works greit... in case that you have some problems with the autorun just go to the cd and open the setup.exe"
,angelcit,2009-10-04T16:04Z,IT WORKS THANKS!
,poevam,2010-01-11T16:56Z,"Ok for who still want this game; it is working!
There are two 'problems' to fix; the s/n and the 'insert cd' problem.

First problem; use the s/n placed in the comment of Acidyen on this page.

Second problem; Extract the ISO file from this torrent and you will get a file named The Movies. Then go to www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=1963 there you download crack for version 1.0 ENG unzip this and copy this file movie.exe to the file The Movies -> Setup -> Data. This will replace the existing file movies.exe.
Than run and install the setup.exe file and the game will play without asking for cd.

Hope this helps.

,jordanidk,2011-04-20T18:54Z,"The game works fine..ignore any libary not registered/compatibility pop ups 

1. Download

2. Mount with ISO/DT/Anything

3. Open disk and run the setup file

4. Should install fine may get a libary not registered error or may not have installed correctly or compatibility problems..ignore it, it'll still work.

5. Once installed open up the ISO that should still be mounted go to the folder named ""DEViANCE"" they'll be 3 applications. 2 aren't needed one is movies.exe. Copy/paste that to your install DIR(Default C:Program files(X86)/Lionhead/The movies) copy and replace.

Run the game from the install directory(The movies.exe) setup basic graphic settings and away you go.

Great game lost track of time playing it and ended up staying up till 7:30 in the morning."
