,Brunogul,2007-12-18T16:37Z,"Hej Jag måste göra nåt fel. När installationen nästan är klar ber programmet om cd2 sen kommer jag inte längre. Som jag förstod skulle inst, ske från cd1"
,bluebeach69,2007-12-31T19:55Z,"Hej, Jag vet inte hur ni gör. Utav ner-ladningen skall tre cd-skivor göras. Sparas för senare användning.
Gör en katalog: Punch tex D: Punch, i katalogen sparas filen AS4000Setup_Download från CD.1 också filen Content_Pack1 från CD.2... CD.3 filen skall inte copyeras till katalogen.
Starta från AS4000Setup_Download, efter en stund säger programmet till om Disk 3, sätt in Disk 3 Content_Pack1.W02 och programmet forsätter sin Installation. 
Detta fungerar för mig..."

,Lorvax737,2008-10-09T17:40Z,"Many thanks to the uploaders. Despite the scary name of the production group (iNFECTED) McAfee found no mal-ware. Punch is the highest rated and this is the only Punch I could Download inside of a week. 3 things though, 1) Key? 2) You've gotta dick around with Magic ISO 3) How does this 4 yo software compare to the latest Better Home & Gardens That loaded quickly, installs easily & look great? Link fallows -"
,Lorvax737,2008-10-09T17:44Z,"Link to Home Design software that works for me (BH & G Suite 8 has been rated second, after Punch)   http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4184352/Better_Homes_and_Gardens_Home_Designer_8"
,syndre,2010-02-26T06:57Z,"whoever made this torrent is not very bright. There are 2 uif cd images, and in the same folder there are some other files which are the exact same files that are on the 2 cd images...

So this torrent is 2x larger than it needs to be. Set your torrent client to skip downloading the 2 uif disc images, and you will be just fine "
,Arock5504,2010-03-17T04:32Z,"When I try to make a custom object, the program is super glitchy. The object I'm making doesn't show up unless I'm scrolling. Anyone else having this problem or know how to fix it?"
,societymike,2011-01-22T08:39Z,"syndre,
the .uif files are the hacked images of the discs you NEED to mount in order to install.

If you mount the first .uif file, then run it, it will ask for CD2, that's when you mount the second .uif file.

After that, it's DONE! Make sure to UNCLICK ""register online"" as there is no need to register and there is NO key needed."
,Harvest565132185,2011-03-16T18:40Z,"I have the version 10 of this that I would like to seed but I don't know how to share the stuff on my computer.  If anyone can e-mail me at harvestmeadow@yahoo.com and give me directions, that would be great.  I would also like to know how to seed stuff I have downloaded from here.  When I close Miro it closes the files I was seeding.  How do I get them to share again.  Sorry to post here but nobody answered me on the forum."
,blackpanther6171,2012-02-10T00:22Z,"Awsome Prograhm, thanks to the uploaders. New to the torrent world..."
