Last time when I released this game it was in the Top 30 Most downloaded and seeded torrents on Demonoid. After 2 years staying up here Demonoid decided to flush old torrents regardless of how many seeders there were. Basically they were flushing any torrent that was too old on Demonoid. So for many of you who don't have this game I decided to re-upload. This will be a great opportunity for those who couldn't get the game last time.
