,oleiham,2007-10-30T17:12Z,"MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS BEFORE ASKING ANY STUPID QUESTIONS ON 
THE COMMENTS SECTION. JUST MOUNT THE ISO IMAGE FILE USING
A DVD/CD EMULATOR LIKE DAEMON TOOLS OR ALCOHOL 120. YOU CAN
ALSO BURN THIS ISO TO A DVD. ONCE THAT IS DONE THE DVD SHOULD
AUTORUN. IF NOT JUST CLICK THE AUTORUN FILE. 

AFTER YOU INSTALL THE GAME. GENERALS SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM
RUNNING. FOR ZERO HOUR SETTING UP A CUSTOM FOLDER MIGHT BE A 
PROBLEM. THE DEFAULT FOR BOTH OF THESE GAMES IS 

C:\PROGRAM\C&C

IT IS NOT PROGRAM FILES ITS PROGRAM WHICH IS SETUP LIKE THAT
HOWEVER SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO HAVE YOUR OWN CUSTOM FOLDER SAY
FOR EXAMPLE YOU INSTALL IT ON D:\GAMES\C&C LIKE MINE, THEN IN
ORDER TO MAKE ZERO HOUR RUN YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE REG FILE IN
THE COMMAND AND CONQUER GENERALS FOLDER. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
EM I USED 1 ALTERNATIV NYCKLAR. RIGHT CLICK ON IT AND CLICK
EDIT. CHANGE THE DEFAULT FOLDERS TO THE FOLDERS YOU WISH TO
HAVE THE GAME INSTALLED ON. AFTER THAT SAVE THE FILE AND CLOSE
IT. THEN JUST CLICK THE REG FILE AND IT WILL ASK YOU TO ADD
THE INFORMATION TO THE REGISTRY JUST CLICK YES. AFTER THAT 
YOU WONT HAVE PROBLEM PLAYING ZERO HOUR OR GENERALS.

THE GAME IS CRACKED SO YOU CANNOT PLAY ON EA GAME SERVERS. HOW
EVER YOU CAN PLAY PEER TO PEER OR LAN. DIRECT IP CONNECTIONS.
YOU CAN ALSO PLAY THE STORY MODES AND SKIRMISH MODES. SO 
BASICALLY YOU CAN PLAY EVERYTHING IN THE GAME EXCEPT EA SERVERS.

gave a last try and worked for me.....cool

heres the trick
install the game in the following folder
D:\EA GAMES
....i used D drive as i didnt have much space on my c drive

anyways after the installation is done....cut and paste the zero hour folder into the other D:\EA GAMES\Command and Conquer Generals....folder

then create a reg file and edit it and enter the following data in it....

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\EA GAMES\Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour]
""DisplayName""=""Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour""

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts\EA Games\Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour]

then save the file and run it....

you are all set to play Zero hour now

and ya use the file named generals2.exe to start the game...so as to avoid that crapy launching screen

njoy gaming :)

By the way AFLONG_AFLONGKONG you do not mention if the game the game worked for you or not or offer a solution to peoples problem so your post was completely useless which , I think, makes you the idiot lol. My best advice would be to download a different version just to be sure as there are others available, I for one will not be installing potentially unsafe files onto my system drive."
,EvilLlama,2008-10-15T02:55Z,"Okay, I have seen two major problems that you are all having with this ISO (other than seeding... I am doing my part...) 

First, people think there is spyware in this file. There is no issue with this ISO, nor is there any spyware. I will explain what is happening and how to fix it.

Second, people can not figure out how to use Zero Hour. The ""read me"" file is garbage. Who ever wrote it did not explain things properly. I will.

And here are my 2 easy solutions to the 2 major issues:

I have used the EXACT same methods on 3 different operating systems and various configurations. It works EVERY time EVERY configuration!!!

Problem 1. Installation with AVG 8.0
I have AVG 8.0 (and a few others also) and was able to narrow down the exact issue that prevents installation of C&C Generals from this ISO. AVG is reading part of a file name, and assuming that is is spyware. 
For example, the word ""car"" is the first part of the word ""career"". If AVG was told that the word ""CAR"" was bad, it would assume the word CAR-EER was also bad.

HOW TO FIX
1. Turn off the resident shield on the AVG control panel.
2. Mount the ISO (or insert the disk you made)
3.Follow the install prompts to install Command and Conquer (Use the default install path to make things easier)
4.Turn AVG Resident shield back on

Now you can play C&C Generals.
If you want to play Zero Hour AND Generals, follow these instructions:

If you used the default file folder during install, this process is a breeze. Follow these steps EXACTLY

1.Open your ""C"" drive in a window (Start, My Computer, C)
2.Open the folder named ""Program"" (Do not open ""Program Files"". there is a new file folder named ""Program"")
3.Open the folder named ""EA Games""

At this point you will see two folders with almost the same name. READ CAREFULLY!!

4. Open folder ""Command and Conquer Generals""
5. Double click on the file named ""1Alternativ nycklar"" (DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!!!)
6. When the pop-up box asks if you want to add the information, click yes.
7. Click ""ok"" on the next pop-up window.

You can now play C&C Generals by double clicking the desktop icon ""Generals"" or you can play C&C Generals: Zero Hour by double clicking the ""Generals Zero"" icon

Have fun!

,On2_wheels,2008-11-14T13:08Z,"I can see that there are a lot of people that cant get the Zero Hour to work.
This is the second time i DL this torrent -on a secondary computer.
On my first DL i did not get the Zero Hour to work at all, tried diffrent keys (""alternativ nycklar"") with different folder/locations/targen etc.. nothing helpt at all. Have to add that I changed default folder on this one.

On my second DL i did NOT change the deafault folder. I used ""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program\\EA Games\\Command and Conquer Generals\\"" with ""Alternativ nycklar1"". Launched ZeroHour and it worked just fine. Everything in order.
But...
I wanted to play via network with my brother (wich computer could NOT launch ZeroHour) so i changed my ""alternativ nycklar1"" to ""alternativ nycklar2"" because of the cdkey and played Generals (NOT the ZeroHour) via network.
Next time upon launch for ZeroHour it failed to start, same problem as on the first computer and same as alot of you guys.

So my conclusion of this torrent,
ZeroHour has trouble to lauch, possible that there are some crack fault, or something with the .reg keys.

5/10, at least half of the torrent worked fine.

Downloading Deviance's one right now, and will drop back to tell if it will launch ZeroHour better then this one.

Thanks for the upload anyway tmjam2002."
,On2_wheels,2008-11-14T13:11Z,"sorry for the double post..

off course i mean ""1Alternativ nycklar"", ""2Alternativ nycklar"" and so on, instead of ""alternativ nycklar1"" ""...2""."
,On2_wheels,2008-11-14T23:55Z,"Tripple post!

Solved the Problem -at least for me!

Okay listen up.

After you have installed C&C Generals ZeroHour, you are supposed to use the .regkey 's... So far hanging on? Probably

right click one of the ""x alternativ nycklar"" (x = 1-6) choose EDIT, look for the Install Patch, easy to find. it should say ""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program\\EA Games\\Command and Conquer Generals\\"" . Now as i understand most of you have changed the default folder to something else, as I did on the first DL (see my first post) and then changed the install patch also.

Example:
Install folder= D:\Program\EA Games\Command and conquer Generals\

reg key (""x alternativ nycklar"")=
""InstallPath""=""D:\Program\EA Games\Command and Conquer Generals\""

That is WRONG!
Noticed what? Alright I'll tell you anyway...

In the original file of ""x alternativ nycklar"" it is TWO backslash ( \ ) between every folder, but not in the new one as it is most easy to Copy>Mark>Paste.
For me it worked to just put the double backslash there.

Think im stupid?
Well thats it, might helped someone =)"
,FodderVomit,2008-12-01T09:13Z,"thank tmjam2002 for this uploading this game. If zero hour won't work just follow exactly what mr wheels just said, it works for me. need to edit registry path. thanks for figuring this out. "

--------------------------------------------------------
-First install the game
-After installing the game go to the generals map and open the ""x alternativ nycklar"" reg file and accept.
-When your done with that go to the Zero Hour map and rename the ""game original 1.2"" .dat file into ""game"".
-Update the game using the official 1.04 patch for zero hour.
-Download the no-cd crack for Zero Hour at gamecopyworld.com and put it into your Zero Hour map.
-Start the game
-Ruin your life

This works on Vista to!"

2)Normal generals works w/o changing anything.

There are the following 4 things that u will find inside the folder:
1.) first ""Command & Conquer Generals"" folder (wich contains ZERO HOUR folder as well.

2.) second ""Command & Conquer Generals"" folder (wich contains GENERALS and also the so called ""1 ALTERNATIV NYCKLAR"" registry file.

3.) ""Install.iip *its an IIP file, don't ask me wat tat stands for plz..)

4.) an ""uninstall"" .exe (to simply uninstall generals from ur HDD.
===========================

Now, here's we will be doin sum registry file editing, so right click the ""1 ALTERNATIV NYCKLAR"" registry file and select ""Open with.."" notepad option.

this is wats written inside it:

""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program\\EA Games\\Command & Conquer Generals\\Zero Hour\\""

and

""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program\\EA Games\\Command and Conquer Generals\\""

---xxx--- PLEASE! notice the double backslashes ""\\"" ---xxx---
=============================

now, i edit it as follows:

""InstallPath""=""X:\\CNC Generals\\Command & Conquer Generals\\Zero Hour\\""

and

""InstallPath""=""X:\\CNC Generals\\Command and Conquer Generals\\""
=============================

Save it and then double click it to add the entry to the registry, now play the game :)

,JimBalls,2010-01-23T19:59Z,"I figured out how to make Zero Hour work.  I'm a noob with computers and I managed to get lucky, so I'm not sure why no one else suggested this on the other comments.  
But pretty much what you need to do if Zero Hour starts up and then sends you straight back to your home screen, you need to alter your registry file like all the other comments have told you, but in addition to this you need to double click another icon in the folder called ""register nycklar"".  Once you do this the game will work.  

I'm the shit, I know :)"

didnt Work 
What the hell is going on whit this 
XD "
,mikkel89,2010-02-06T14:51Z,"thought i'd throw my two cents in and offer a possible source of error here.

i did the thing in QWERSTER's post and copied the info into ""alternativ nycklar 1"", but what i did wrong was an oversight in the path name. there are two paths you need to edit, the top one is for Zero Hour(expansion) and the bottom one is for Generals(original).
lazy as i am, i just copy/pasted the Zero hour folder in both the paths, which for windows would be like trying to run zero hour without having generals installed, since it will be refered to zero hour twice. when i made the bottom path to the generals folder(the one that has ""nycklar"" in it) and combined it with compatibility mode for XP service pack 2 for the zero hour file, it works like a charm on windows 7 ultimate 64Bit(without comp. i get a ""serious error"")

to illustrate what i did:
THE WRONG WAY

""InstallPath""=""D:\\Games\\Command & Conquer Generals\\Zero Hour\\""

""InstallPath""=""D:\\Games\\Command & Conquer Generals\\Zero Hour\\""

THE RIGHT WAY
""InstallPath""=""D:\\Games\\Command & Conquer Generals\\Zero Hour\\""

""InstallPath""=""D:\\Games\\Command and Conquer Generals\\""

understand? windows needs to find both folders

PS: make sure you don't put ""&"" in both paths(""and"" for second one) as this would also be an easy oversight

hope this helps someone :)"
,EMANCIPADOR0008,2010-02-07T02:04Z,"Yeah Yeah 
now i know what i did wron 
i did everyting right bot my mistake was
that in the pc of mi friend i use the alternativ nycklar 2 o maibe other

,soul2shard,2010-02-13T05:11Z,"Using JimBalls's advice,i noticed that i needed to change my Register nycklar file (not the one with 1 in front of it) to set the right install paths."

,xDevilWearsxPradax,2010-02-19T02:09Z,"Thank you for the torrent, a little confusing but i got Generals AND Zero hour to work totally fine.
For those that are confused with the 1Alternativ nycklar thing:
There are two things you need to change. the first one is - 
""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program\\EA Games\\Command and Conquer Generals\\Zero Hour\\""
Then the other one -
""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program\\EA Games\\Command and Conquer Generals\\""

^^^^What yours should look like^^^^^

You will need to change the install path (ex- change Program to Program1) for both of them for it to work NOT just the zero hour install path.

EX:
""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program1\\EA Games\\Command and Conquer Generals\\Zero Hour\\""

""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program1\\EA Games\\Command and Conquer Generals\\""

Hope this helped xD"
,weerab1981,2010-02-23T19:22Z,"thanx for this.. the game works fine...
i dont know if all u noticed but when you install the game there is a new folder in the c: drive called program within this is the EA GAMES folder and note that is in capital letters!!!!!!!
this is all you have to change in the 'Register nycklar.reg' file unless you want the game in a different location. if you are not moving the game then just capitalise the word 'Games' on both lines - 
""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program\\EA GAMES\\Command & Conquer Generals\\Zero Hour\\""
and this line -
""InstallPath""=""C:\\Program\\EA GAMES\\Command and Conquer Generals\\""
as u can see EA GAMES is in capitals which u will find is the same as the location.....
once changed exit this file and select yes to save changes then double left click on the file and select yes to add to registry....
thats all i did and there is no need to make more folders etc.
hope this helps you all,,

also make the changes to the generals ""install path"" aswell as zero hour or else it will NOT work..do this in both reg files  .save it then double click those 2  reg files to register the REG files

I know how to make the crack work.  It's exactly like The Battle For Middle-Earth 1,2 & Witch King (also by EA).

Create a new text document named ""Options"" and paste this into it:

AudioLOD = High
HasSeenLogoMovies = yes
IdealStaticGameLOD = High
Resolution = 1280 720
TimesInGame = 1

Close the document and change the .txt into a .ini 

Now take your Options.ini file and put it in My Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Data foler (and this also works for the Zero Hour expansion as well as ALL the Battle For Middle-Earth games).  

And that's it.  Oh, and feel free to change the Resolution values to, say, 1920 1080 or whatever your monitor will handle.  
Note that the Middle-Earth games came out long before widescreens were invented and in-game, only support 4:3 resolutions so they show black bars on each side of the game, but can be ""tricked"" into playing in widescreen mode by changing these values.

**** This assumes default install folder was used ****

1- After mounting iso + game install > Open folder C:\Program\EA GAMES\Command and Conquer Generals\  > double-click -i.e. run/execute- ONE of the ""x Alternativ nycklar.reg"" files. (I used ""6 Alternativ nycklar.reg"")
2- Open folder C:\Program\EA GAMES\Command & Conquer Generals\Zero Hour\ > Rename the file ""game original 1.2.dat"" to ""game.dat"" (NOTE: You have to move/rename/replace/delete the pre-existing ""game.dat"" file)
3- Use the official 1.04 patch for zero hour (one of the many DL locations = www.filefront.com/3845601/ )
4- Download rar file for v1.04 [ENGLISH] No-CD game fix from gamecopyworld.com (Choose a mirror & search for ""Zero Hour"").  
5- Extract ""generals.exe"" and ""game.dat"" from rar file to folder C:\Program\EA GAMES\Command & Conquer Generals\Zero Hour\ (Again, you have to move/rename/replace/delete the preexisting files).
6- Run the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2) -> In both install folders (Orig and Zero Hour), Right-click generals.exe > Select Properties > On the Compatibility Tab, enable ""Compatibility Mode"" option and select ""Windows XP (Service Pack 2)"" from the pull-down list > Click ""Apply"" > Click ""OK"".

Game will run properly now. (You can make sure your desktop shortcuts point to  generals.exe in their respective install folders.)

(P.S. I know that the amount of detail in these instructions is a tad overkill. Some pirates just can't, or simply won't, figure it out otherwise.

Thank you for the upload tmjam2002!
That being said, this game does have 2 things that frustrate the living shit out of me:
1 - When playing missions, you have to wait for the entire intro sequence to finish before you actually start playing.
2 - If a mission-critical character dies, game screen only asks ""Retry the mission? Y/N?"" If you select yes, it starts the mission from the VERY beginning (w/ unskippable intro sequence).  If you want to load a saved game, you have to (more or less) go all the way back to the title menu screen.

Any person new to the game, take these two suggestions to heart:
a - On EVERY mission, as soon as the intro sequence ends -> create a saved game.

b - As soon as you see the animation of mission-critical character dying, bring up the game menu ASAP where you can still load a saved game (even if it's the saved game from 1st suggestion).  It will save you TONS of wait-time."

,newslimepirate,2010-11-30T05:58Z,"FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH WINDOWS 7 ISSUES

I have a Windows 7 Ultimate x64 and the game wouldn't even get past the splash screen.

Then I found a solution elsewhere after all else failed.

First go to your documents and find C&C data for generals and zero hour (they're folders). Make sure both of them give your user full permissions.

Next make sure every file in those folders (should be like 2 files) is NOT read-only

Lastly and most importantly, open a new notepad, and copy/paste the following:

AntiAliasing = 1
BuildingOcclusion = yes
DrawScrollAnchor =
DynamicLOD = no
ExtraAnimations = yes
GameSpyIPAddress = 0.0.0.0
Gamma = 50
IPAddress = 0.0.0.0
IdealStaticGameLOD = High
LanguageFilter = true
MaxParticleCount = 5000
MoveScrollAnchor =
MusicVolume = 55
Resolution = 1024 768
Retaliation = yes
SFX3DVolume = 79
SFXVolume = 71
ScrollFactor = 50
SendDelay = no
ShowSoftWaterEdge = yes
ShowTrees = yes
StaticGameLOD = Custom
TextureReduction = 0
UseAlternateMouse = no
UseCloudMap = yes
UseDoubleClickAttackMove = no
UseLightMap = yes
UseShadowDecals = yes
UseShadowVolumes = yes
VoiceVolume = 100

I read that anti alias can be set up to 4 for nvidia cards and 6 for ATI cards but I have not confirmed that these are the limits yet (but x1 works perfectly)

SAVE that notepad into BOTH the GENERALS DATA folder (the one in documents) and the ZERO HOUR DATA folders as
'options.ini'

make sure that same file is in both of the folders, then simply go and run the game and it should work."

""nyska's"" solution on page 11 works perfectly!


PART 1:

Make a new text file in BOTH your ""Generals Data"" Folder AND your ""Generals Zero Hour Data"" Folder (Both Will be found in your My Documents....now in that file copy & paste this:


AntiAliasing = 1
BuildingOcclusion = yes
DrawScrollAnchor =

Save as ""Options.ini"" ( MAKE SURE ITS IN BOTH FOLDERS)


PART 2:

1) Go to your ""All programs > EA GAMEs > Generals""

2)Right click on ""1 Reg Nycklar""

3) Edit that file and swap all the text in it to this:

Please Help as I really wanna play Generals again!!!"
,pizdurina,2011-08-28T18:06Z,"""Your serial already is use"" this show me every time i tried to connect and play with my frend,we use hamachi.GZH detect our hamachi ip,but we can't connect. -If you have same problem do this:

1.Go to start/run
2. Type  regedit
3. Then go: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic
Arts\EA Games\Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour\erg
4. Right click on it, Modify
5.Insert some other serial number then hint OK(you can find on net)
6.Now you can play with you frend who have the same CCGZH(in my case tihs torrent-generals)

*Make shure thet you allowed GZH to connect or make changes on your compyter when firewall start shit  :D

Btw my solution how to fix GZH on windows 7 home edition if other solutions dosen't work(maby is nobish but it's work for me)

1. Uninstal generals(if you already instaled them and tried to fix with some of the solutions given hear) and delate all files and folder wher generals are installed.

2. Install again CCGZH without changing destinaton folder,leave default (C:\PROGRAM\...) DO NOT CHANGE INSTALATION FOLDER-if you don't have memory on ""C"" you can find directions in ""READ ME PLZZ"" how to set up a custom folder-then continiu from 3.(i'm not shure dose then will work)

3.Go to Strat and find EA GAMES directory 

4.Click  on ""1 reg nycklar"" then ""Yes"" ""Ok"" -whatever just conferme :D

5.Start Generals Zero Hour and enjoy :D

One or two xD more thing for network play:

1.In CCGZH, Options, Online and Lan ip need to be your ip from hamachi(etc)  to bee able to connect/create game

2.There is a bug in Multiplayer/Online type of game,use Singleplayer/Offline.When i chose Multiplayer/Online and start playing whit frends my units just blow up-if i created a game,same happend when someone onther create game-instant defeat :S

The guys an idiot and uploaded a program with a shit talking readme that doesn't tell you shit on how to actually install it. 

With that being said. I got generals to work. All you have to do is run it as an administrator on Vista. Not sure why, but that's how you make it work.

http://cdn.naxpgaming.com/gbw/dl.php?file=CommandAndConquerGeneralsv1.7NoCDFixedexeEng-2.rar

2. Go here to get this trainer:
http://games.softpedia.com/dyn-postdownload.php?p=39778&t=4&i=1

Make sure you create a backup of the original game.dat and Generals.exe by simply renaming them gameOriginal.dat and GeneralsOriginalinstall.exe or something like that

Then open up your trainer after you've extracted it to somewhere (doesn't matter where) then run the game and hit the corresponding keys to activate each cheat.

2) Where it says

change it to 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREwow6432nodeEA GAMESCommand and Conquer Generals Zero Hour]

and put that extra ""wow6432node"" in every appropriate chain.

3) Save and double-click the registry file so it changes

4) Open Zero Hour and watch in amazement as it doesnt go fullscreen and then crash



this is from nyska on page 11 of comments i had tried every single other option to make zero hour work this is awesome and works perfect. My exact problem was that generals worked perfect but every time i tried to open zero hour it looked like it started to work then just flashed once or twice and closed. Just make sure to put wow6432node in after the word software everywhere on the page!!!!! thanks nyska   "
