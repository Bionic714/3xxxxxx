,madjock56,2007-03-25T14:23Z,"Watched Discovery the other night.

The story of the boys going away with a mentor at age 7 is true. The bad part is they become lovers, as in gay lovers. It was that bad, that to select a wife, they had to shave a womens hair off to look like a man, just so they could go from the transition of shagging blokes to shagging women.

How much do you like the Spartans now ?

Nothing personal mate, but a 2 hr TS reencoded to 1CD is a joke, and showing thumbnails as small ast hat is as much use as fuck all. Alright if you want to watch it on a phone."
,kcor000,2007-03-26T07:04Z,"Just got done downloading it and it looks great.

Thanks man."
,Sabe_01ab,2007-03-26T12:14Z,"I can't download it ?

,Sabe_01ab,2007-03-26T12:18Z,"np, it works :)"
,Butcher2,2007-03-26T16:17Z,"Is the picture quality better than the, 

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3645554/300_(2007).DVDSCR.XVID-NEPTUNE_(reencoded),

upload? Because that is really not that good."
,madjock56,2007-03-26T16:45Z,"Butcher2

No disrespect to thisoneguy.cms, but converting a 2 hr film to a smaller size, be it Mpg or Avi is going to lose quality.

If bandwidth is not an issue get the DVDSCR by swine, if it is an issue, just get the 1.4GB Neptune DVD Scr Rip release."
,thisoneguy.cms,2007-03-26T17:34Z,"You are right, it will lose some quality, but then that is the (Re) encoders' job to make the quality loss as minimal a possible. 

For torrents 1.4 gig isnt a big deal, but I also share on free file share sites (hence the 100mb rar files, well that and they have a recovery record to stave off file errors) but 100mb as a free user from, say rapid share is quite an under takeing (avg 17 links) where as eight is a little easier to get... None the less, it was a good flick, you all should enjoi it whatever the release. Cheers"
,Baarechoem,2007-03-26T23:55Z,"To anyone dowldn this one... It's good quality! No doubt. If you are familiar with AXXO's releases, and you were satisfied. Then you shouldn't be dissapointed with this one either!

Fast seeds and i enjoyed the movie. Admitted that it's not a great story, but nontheless very entertaining!
 Great job!

,RageKage214,2007-03-28T03:20Z,How come thesound on these Xvid files doesnt work for me?
,mr beesh,2007-03-28T05:49Z,"Great download. Quality is good, sound good. "
,@eon,2007-03-29T10:59Z,"Being gay at that time was not at all the same as being gay today. If today society would think that women are animals, then having sex with other men would be good and holy. The gay thing is not important about this movie. What's more important, something that is never mentioned is this:
Spartans were a greek tribe of warriors that descended from the north, enslaved Sparta and the other greek tribes livind there, part of the Mycenean civilization that existed before. Spartans named those other greek tribes 'Eilotes' (pronounced like 'eelotes') and made them their slaves. Those slaves would do all work, so that Spartans would spend all their time to train in combat. Spartan population:1 Slave population:6 Nice ratio huh? 1 in 6 were free men and all the rest slaves. So much for the 'Spartans fighting for freedom' and 'Spartans fighting against a tyrant' crap."

,zakisbak,2007-04-11T04:02Z,Works great!In Real Player ONLY  for me!WindowsMediaPlayer - nothing!
,kiatr,2007-04-12T16:27Z,"madjock56 you should read a history book before talking about spartans. or maybe any book... its not that harmfull. There were gays in ancient world, but not more than today, just look around you. When you finish reading your own history (it should not take you more than a day...) start the greek one, it will take long :)"
,Jimandpuppy,2007-04-28T13:09Z,"Look: I hate Sausage-Jockeys as much as the next Normal man, and i knew beforehand they were PUFFS, so i was well pleased to see NO disgusting homosexuality in this movie even though gayboy Hollywood could have really laid it on thick. Wouldnt have minded living in Sparta, though, the women must have been queuing up for a natural real man who does what he is designed to do!!"
