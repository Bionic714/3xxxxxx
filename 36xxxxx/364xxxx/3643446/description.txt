Plot:	Good versus evil in the realm of the magical mountain Zu as director Tsui Hark returns to the territory that made him famous nearly 20 years ago.

Overview:	Tsui Hark revisits the story of Zu, which he previously put to film in 1983. Only this time, he's got a bigger budget, a lot more experience, and countless special effects tricks up his sleeve! Rumor has it that there are over 1600 special effects shots in this film! This is truly a great film to have on DVD, as the high quality format is perfect for experiencing Hark's magical fantasy world as he envisioned it.
