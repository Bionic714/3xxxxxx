WinMX is a free p2p program similar to Ares, Limewire, Bearshare, Shareaza, Bearshare, and others. This version of WinMX is a patched version allowing it to work with the new Peer Caches. This is 100% virus/spyware free, it doesn't advertise to you or anything. It's a barebones p2p program. And as long as you're using this version of the patch created by winmxgroup.com you'll never see a fake file in your search list again. There isn't a single p2p program out there that can say that about theirselves.
