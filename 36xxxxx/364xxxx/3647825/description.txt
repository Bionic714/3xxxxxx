Notes: 99% Lapshot video. Video & Audio came out nicely. A couple duck and covers as to be
expected, shot stage right. Was shot 2nd row from elevated seats over the floor, only
downside is the people in the first row would occasionally stand up and block all but a
view of Ler. The 1st 10 minutes of the show I am tweaking audio levels and video settings as
my hold button kept coming unlocked, and once in the middle of the show the
video goes into a long exposure mode. Aside from that should be very enjoyable.
The angle wasn\\\'t optimal but suffices well. Can\\\'t see much of Herb at all due to it.
During the encore had to stand up and aim due to the people standing up and I wasn\\\'t
going to miss pudding time / tommy the cat.

Also, there are audible blips in the audio, these are just part of transfer and are not on the
actual tape. I\\\'m not going to retransfer the show to save wear and tear on the
hardware, so you\\\'ll just have to deal with it.

While you\\\'re here head to this link to download their last show in the San Diego area back on February 5th, 2000 (audio only).
