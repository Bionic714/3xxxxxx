   HOW TO MAKE XBMC YOUR DASHBOARD:

   A configurable Shortcut for your -C-Drive is included in the XBMC ROOT dir.
   It points to E:/Apps/XBMC/default.xbe by default. If your XBMC Directory is
   elsewhere you must change its Application Path by editing the .cfg file !! 
   Rename the "ShortCut for -C-Drive.cfg" and the "ShortCut for -C-Drive.xbe"
   to something your BIOS can boot (evoxdash.xbe + evoxdash.cfg) + copy both
   files to the ROOT of your -C-Drive.
   !! Double check !! you did everything right then reboot - Voila !
