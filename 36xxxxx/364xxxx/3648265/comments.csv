,xyncro,2007-03-28T10:45Z,"nice ul el.toro.. thx
..but is it to much to ask you ppl to seed..??"
,el.toro,2007-03-28T16:13Z,I'm seeding all the time! 300 kb/sec. 9+ hrs w/o breaks.
,davidhammer,2007-04-19T14:09Z,"Don't download people. I did and burned onto a dvd-r, when I watched the film, close to the end the last 10min are from one of the starting scenes. The ending is missing (last 10 mins or so)"
[V],Kuthumi,2007-04-21T22:15Z,"Disc 1 is 4.76 Giga. Disc 2 is 7.50 Giga. That adds up to 12 Giga. Would be nice to know which disc contains what, I don't care to download the extras. Is the film split in the middle with a ""please insert disc 2"" instruction, or does one of them contain just extras?"
[V],Kuthumi,2007-04-21T22:31Z,"I see above that el.toro has specified that disc 2 contains the extras, but I have never seen that the disc with the extras is bigger than the main disc with the film.  One of the downloaders complains that the end is missing from disc 1, that's why I ask. The incorrect info that each disc is 2 Giga is given in the file specifications on top (click on the ""3"")."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-04-26T07:48Z,"davidhammer: Don't advise others when you are wrong. I have downloaded disc 1, it contains the complete film including the last 10 minutes. I mounted it with Daemon Tools, and 1Click DVD Copy Pro burned it unto a normal DVD without any reduction in the main film. Kept all the subtitles, stripped some menus and extra soundtracks."
,romadelic,2007-06-22T20:44Z,"Dear friends whose successfully downloaded this DVD. Would you be so kind and seed, PLEASE."
