,DrakeZ,2007-05-03T03:10Z,What do you mean by mounting it?
,DrakeZ,2007-05-03T03:29Z,Also I installed your little Daemon tools thing and it fucked up my computer big time. It first rebooted my computer without my permission. Then once the computer got back to the normal desktop it instantly rebooted again and the cycle continued. One broken keyboard later I got the thing to work. How come this can't be just one happy simple thing you just download and bam it's good.

who got right please explain here how to install since the begining"
,Frietbakker_Thjeu,2007-07-18T10:57Z,"oke...
First open Alcohol 120% (this is a program which you can use to mount images) make a virtual drive. richtclick on that drive, select mount image.  go to the map where you downloaded GTA san andreas. select the GTA SA . MDF or MDS then the install will start.
after the installation:
again richtclick on the virtual image (it should now be GTASA or something) and select the view files or something. then you'll see all the folders and files from the image. now search for a folder called ""HOODLUM"" copy all the folders from that folder and place them in the folder where you installed GTASA (so where GTA.exe is installed) 
then i think that you can start it without problems.

www.sa-mp.com"

,DonMaJic,2007-10-06T17:51Z,"Wonder if someone had an idea about this.... I unrar'd folder, mounted .mdf to Daemon Tools virtual drive, installed GTA:SA, then ran the game. It runs the Rockstar logo's and the titles, but as soon as it starts loading the game and the GTA:SA splash screen appears, the game just crashes and returns to desktop. Any ideas anyone?"

""I can't even use daemon tools""

""Wtf my computer restarted""

GOOGLE is your friend

and if you can't work out how to use it, DON'T FUCKING DOWNLOAD IT!!

And stop complaining, its FREE ffs!

Sorry, rant over ;)"
,Eldarion123,2007-12-19T03:51Z,"Right, I'll explain it once and for all for everyone here.

--------------------------------------------------
Note: YOU DO NOT NEED ALCOHOL 120%!!
--------------------------------------------------

#1: Make sure you have the following programs installed:
PowerISO
Daemon Tools
Winrar

#2: After downloading the game, right click the .rar file and click ""Unrar here"". Result is obvious.

#3: After winrar has done it's job, right click the yellow CD icon in your tray and select one of the top thingies (for me it's Mount image on H: (no media)). This will allow you to select the location from which to show an image file. Dig your way through the Hard Drive to the location you unrar'ed GTA onto. Select the largest one (should be about 4gb in size)

#4: install. Easy enough.

Now for the ""hard part"". Took me some time to figure this out, downloading different .exe fixes and so on.

#5: By using Explorer, find your way to the GTA folder again (the one you downloaded and extracted) and unrar the 2nd .rar file that contains the NOCD crack. Copy the gtasa.exe into the folder in which you installed GTA SA. Click YES to replace it with the default one (which doesnt work unless you have the original CD, for your information!)

Now the last part, which had me going for a while, trying different options etc.


#6: Now you're going to use Daemon Tools. Look for a red lightning icon in your tray and right click it. Dig your way to the folder in which you downloaded the game. Select the SMALLEST file.

#7: Select ""Play GTA: San Andreas""

I hope this helps, it's exactly what I did and it's working like a dream :)


----
Peace out "
,Eldarion123,2007-12-19T03:54Z,"By the way, using Daemon Tools is the same as using PowerISO: select the empty drive and dig through your files :)

If you do not know how or where to get a hold of the programs I mentioned, pay www.google.com a visit and search for ""Daemon Tools"", ""PowerISO"" and ""WinRAR"" respectively.

Peace out "
,Eldarion123,2007-12-19T03:56Z,"Screw what I said, I just discovered that it won't take me further than the autorun screen anyway, it just stops after that. And I thought I had it all figured out. Bleh."

Thanks a lot, and srsly, its easy as hell to install.... took me the best part of an hour to do... and that's with extraction time and installation time included.... so if you can't work it out then you must be really daft....

Thanx for a great game :D."

,joshp123,2007-12-27T00:15Z,"Try...

www.google.com

or www.utorrent.com

or the faq

dumb shit...."
,Extortion22,2008-01-12T20:06Z,"Great torrent. Works 100% for me. 

To anyone having problems its this simple. Forget the instructions in the readme. 

Download and install DaemonTools if you dont already have it, run a single device, and mount the small image in the extracted GTA folder. 

You may completely erase Alcahol 100% since you will not need it. 

Run the image and install GTA San Andreas, when this is done replace the installed GTA app icon with the one you extract from the NOCD Crack, restart if you need to, but its not neccesary. 

Now GTA should run no problems without a cd or even using DaemonTools again.

***Side note: I did a custom install and made sure the sound options was checked since I saw some people were having problems with sound, try this and if you still have problems a buddy told me that he had to change the sound on his actual computer to mono to get the sound to work properly***

I hope this helps all of you!"

A few tips:
**When you run the installation program, choose CUSTOM installation not AUTO or FULL. When you do so, check the box that says AUDIO. Now you won't have issues with the sounds :D
**After you install it, remember that the real folder is in:
Program Files/Rockstar Games/GTA SA
NOT wherever you saved the torrent extract. And that's where you should replace it with the cracked file.

,ai402006,2008-10-18T08:33Z,"i checked almost every download for this game, and every post and cannot find out why it wont work for me. every dL is pretty much the same.
-download torrent
-mount iso (with magicdisc)
-exchange crack (craked.exe with the one in the program file directory

i followed every post and readme correctly but it still doesnt work.
what ive noticed----
 on the disc or iso file there are 5 winrar files (.cab) and at first i tried to decompress all of them (and when i did, i got
((D:\data1.cab
the archive is either in unkown format or damaged)) then i was confused and someone wrote in a post that i dont need to do that. thats when i started following directions lol.

also, when i follow the directions i get a start up, then on the gta screen it goes back to windows.

after while i didnt care too much about it and let it go, but i wanna know how to fix this issue to probably fix others later on.

thanx for your time and help"

Dude, just because you have a problem installing the game does not mean everyone else will.

I've been playing the game for a while now, been doing some missions and stuff. I got to the point where I have to plant a BOMB using LMB (Assuming it's Left Mouse Button). It does NOT work. There is no ""Key-binding"" for this LMB, so I can't just change it to another button. Really a big problem, because I can't go on any further in-game. 

If you did not understand my question or just have an answer (?), please EMAIL ME AT JENS_KLEVELAND@HOTMAIL.COM or post a comment here. I believe people will get iritated after playing the game for 20 hours, then realize that you can't go on any further from there.. So, please post : )

,SJCarline,2010-01-08T19:47Z,"Ok I want to help some of you. No-cd or No-dvd .exe's are a replacement for the games original .exe that you will have to replace so the game doesn't go looking for the disc. This file is included with most games you will download from torrent and as well on the web (use google ie..GTS Sanandreas no cd would be what you would search for.

Alcohol 120 is only one of hundreds of optical (cd\dvd\ect) drive emulators...this means that it makes your pc ""think"" that there is a physical tangible drive attached when there is none...The action of mounting an ""image"" is essentially the same as putting a physical disc into a cd drive. Viruses and trojans and maleware are rarely the cause of pc's ""crashing"" unless its over a long period of time. if there was such a file in any of these torrents tpb would have it removed immediatly 

That being said before downloading any of these or other torrents install an anti-virus but be aware that keygens and other ""cracked"" or files designed to ""crack"" other files will most of the time be viewed as a trojan...its an engine in the anti-virus that keeps an eye out for a cirtain ""behavior"" that these files do. there are a TON of pages of comments and only a few saying that this torrent is crap....trust the majority."

,van_cleeff,2010-01-22T02:05Z,"The game works very well, no virus detected by nod32. I just used Daemon Tools which was already on my computer.

1. download this torrent, which will make you download GTA:San Andreas pc

2. after you download, find the folder and the readme

3. double-click on the folder ""gta san andreas"" (i probably missed capitals) and find ""setup.exe""

4. run setup.exe, and it will install the game on your computer (takes about 15 mins) and when it asks to create a desktop shortcut, click ""yes""

5. after installation is complete, go to 
my computer > c: > program files > rockstar games > gta san andreas 

6. look for the file ""gta_sa.exe"" and delete it

7. now, go back to the original ""gta san andreas"" folder in step 2.

8. open the folder ""crack"" and look for ""gta_sa.exe""

9. copy THIS ""gta_sa.exe"" and paste it in the ""rockstar games"" folder in ""my computer""

10. double-click this gta_sa.exe or go to the desktop and double-click on the shortcut.

11. enjoy!

2. Aboydebeat12 has a very nice guide, JUST FOLLOW IT

3. @awesomeassasin: Sometimes its not the internet connections problem. I have a internet connection at 2 Mb/s but the speed have gone far away from 1MB. Notice that its a difference between Mb and MB (search the internet). And, its all the others who is seeding who makes you get higher download speed, not the internet connection...

,Aboydebeat12,2010-05-09T01:59Z,"ok guys, you don't need the ISO thing at all!

1. download this torrent, which will make you download GTA:San Andreas pc

2. after you download, find the folder and the readme

3. double-click on the folder ""gta san andreas"" (i probably missed capitals) and find ""setup.exe""

4. run setup.exe, and it will install the game on your computer (takes about 15 mins) and when it asks to create a desktop shortcut, click ""yes""

5. after installation is complete, go to
my computer > c: > program files > rockstar games > gta san andreas

6. look for the file ""gta_sa.exe"" and delete it

7. now, go back to the original ""gta san andreas"" folder in step 2.

8. open the folder ""crack"" and look for ""gta_sa.exe""

9. copy THIS ""gta_sa.exe"" and paste it in the ""rockstar games"" folder in ""my computer""

10. double-click this gta_sa.exe or go to the desktop and double-click on the shortcut.

11. enjoy!

**THIS REQUIRES NO CD/DVD BURNER, NO ISO, OR ANY SHIT LIKE THAT. NO NEED TO MOUNT, ETC ETC ETC**

just follow my steps and you should have what i have. "

The solution to it starting but crashing or never loading is SIMPLE. Go to your ""Documents"" folder and delete the folder ""GTA San Andreas User Files"". I ran mine in Compatibility Mode with Vista, but try with XP if it doesn't work. It should work now, provided you patched it correctly.

Nothing else works. NOTHING ELSE WORKS. The moment you delete that folder it will work. Have fun :p"

While I typically don't like my torrents RARed I understand why some people do. I just want to suggest for future uploads that if you are going to include additional content such as Alcohol, kindly include that in a seperate archive. Otherwise you are defeating the purpose of RARing the content. I don't need Alcohol as I already have it installed, and now have to essentially waste the bandwidth downloading it to complete the torrent.

Once installed, apply patch and see if it works, no mods or extra patches yet.

If it works and you can save, then you're good to do what you want.
If you do encounter problems try running in compatibility mode.

(If you still have problems, odds are you don't have all the directx installed, -so install them)

,finisher489,2011-07-23T23:43Z,"1. Download PowerISO from its website then download its keygen by going into google and typing ''poweriso keygen torrent''. If one of the torrents isn't working try the others. PowerISO will tell you that it successfully worked then it will tell you that it can't edit/create an image file that's greater than 300MB. Just ignore it.

2. a -Right-Click on the San Andreas ISO file that is shaped like a yellow disc if there is one and then click PowerISO -> number of drives -> 1 drive. If there are 2 ISO Files then click 2 drives, 3 ISO Files then click 3 drives, 4 ISO Files then click 4 drives........ ON AND ON AND ON. b- If it there isn't an ISO File then click on setup and set it up. 

3.After you're done, make sure the game is in Program Files x86 -> Rockstar Games -> GTA San Andreas. Go to that folder BUT DON'T CLICK ON IT YET and go to the Application (.exe). It's properly called sa.exe/gta_sa.exe/gta.exe or something. There should be a folder called crack in the torrent folder NOT THE PROGRAM FILES X 86 ROCKSTAR GAMES SAN ANDREAS FOLER or there should be some crack or file that looks exactly like the application .exe. Now we're going to trick Microsoft. Go into the torrent folder and look for an app (.exe) file that looks exactly like the app (.exe) file in program files x86 -> rockstar games -> gta san andreas. Copy and paste the torrent file to the program files x86 -> rockstar games -> gta san andreas folder. It will tell you that the file already exists and then just click on copy anyways/copy and replace. click on that file you copied and it should work perfect.

There is an error with the video at the beginning of the game. I have not found a video that works That I can download and replace. But in the meantime you can delete the video, and at least play the game. This is how you do it: Go to My Computer -> Local Disc C -> Program Files -> Rockstar Games -> GTA San Andreas -> Movies -> DELETE file 'GTAtitles'. The video in the beggining will NOT appear, but you will be able to play the game. Video 'Logo' Is nothing wrong with so you don't need to delete it. It's your choice. But REMEMBER delete the file 'GTAtiltes'
No it should work. If it doesn't work try Right click on the GTA icon

where the hell is the crack located?!??!?!

if I click on the ""gta_sa"" file in the ""Crack No-CD (By Squall89)"" folder, it says this:

vorbisfile.dll was not found

...

so then I mounted the file onto a virtual H: driver, and clicked on the setp file, which installed the game and put icon on my desktop... but it was also asking me whether I wanted to purchase the game or not.

So now I have the game installed, but where do I find the crack to play it??????????????????"

2. Google Daemon Tools and download and install that (trial version). Open it.
3. Click the button on the top right that says Add Images. Go inside the GTA Sa folder and open the .mdf file. Now click that and press the button on the top that says Mount.
4. Install GTA
5. Find the Rockstar Games file in Program Files. Open it and open gta folder. 
6. Delete the gta application file that's 14mb.
7. Go in GTA Sa folder and unzip the no crack file.
8. Cut this extracted gta application (also 14mb) and paste it in the previous rockstar games folder where the old gta application was.
9. Also cut and paste that 1kb id file in the GTA Sa folder. Idk if you need this but i did it anyways.
