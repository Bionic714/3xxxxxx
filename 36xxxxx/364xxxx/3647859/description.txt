Covell: Making Motorcycle Gas Tanks

This two-part DVD takes you step-by-step through the fabrication of two motorcycle gas tanks. In Part 1, Covell makes a pretty basic symmetrical tank for a custom V-Twin. In Part 2, he creates a very unusual asymmetrical tank with sweeping curves. I think even my grandmother could make a gas tank with Covell?s instruction.
