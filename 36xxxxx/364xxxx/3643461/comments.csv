,frankute,2007-03-20T19:41Z,"You can post it at any public trackers you can find, such as mininova, meganova etc."
,deathstarz,2007-03-20T20:09Z,Aliens on LSD? LOL
,Drexon,2007-03-20T21:18Z,"Thank you for seeding guys! At this rate I might actually be able to see that CTU version of Prison Break sometime soon. ;)

I forgot to mention. This is ""only"" the 50mb WMV version (which is why I named it as such), but there's a high quality h.264 version of this coming too. No more squiggly, floaty colors going all over the place!"
,johanblaa,2007-03-20T22:02Z,A freakin kite made of tin foil...
,Drexon,2007-03-20T23:03Z,"A kite does not move as uniformed as this thing does. Also, look at it in full screen at the 3:10-3:32 mark. Does that not look like a typical sauser shaped UFO?"
,sk8er2571,2007-03-21T07:50Z,I wasnt impressed.
,Drexon,2007-03-22T01:53Z,Show it.
