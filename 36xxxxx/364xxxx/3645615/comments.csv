,rowborough,2007-04-07T17:13Z,"nearly 600 people dont have a problem with the file, thats all I can say..."
,Creator_of_torrent,2007-04-11T19:47Z,"iPod movies have to be in Mpeg-4 Format to play on the ipod. If you are having problems, try converting the video into Mpeg-4. Try iPod video converter on google and see what you find. I suggest 3GP Converter."
,loquex,2007-04-11T23:07Z,"to be 30% smaller file size than the 1.4 GB non-ipod versions, this file lost a lot of image quality, i would say around 50% lower than the normal.  Sound is fine. Also the image is streched vertically, I guess that's because ipods are not widescreen yet."
,Mrs.Lecter,2007-06-14T21:32Z,Its an .avi file not .mp4?? WTF
