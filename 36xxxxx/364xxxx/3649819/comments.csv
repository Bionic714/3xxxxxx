,ShadowRunner,2007-03-29T16:52Z,I dunno if it works but you can try to replace the english language file of the trial one...  the .config ones inside are some XML language things... try it

,XweAponX,2008-04-12T09:51Z,"This is SHITE... Not only is it in a non-comprehendable foreign language... the fuckin README file is RETARDED.

Fuckin put USABLE INFO in the README if yer gonna ppst swedish fuckin programs.

Anyway, Acronis DOES NOT work with Vista SYSTEM partitions (Data, yes, but it will destroy SYSTEM partitions)

USe fuckin PARAGON for Vist Shit System,

This fucked-like-a-duck POS Proggy needs to be trashed... If you want this program... DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION."
,XweAponX,2008-04-12T09:53Z,"Excuse me, its fuckin Goiman...

The CHARACTER set is NON READABLE in Vist Shit- So you cant even ""guess"" your way around the installation and use of the proggy, the characters are corrupt. Maybe not in XP... But in VistShit, the characters are nonsense."
