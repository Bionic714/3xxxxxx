Acronis Disk Director Suite is the ideal tool in combination with Acronis True Image backup. Here's how you can take advantage of these two products together:

    * Create individual partitions for your system and your data using Acronis Disk Director Suite.
    * Image your system partition using Acronis True Image only before applying system changes, such as installing new software and the like.
    * Make scheduled data backups from your data partition by selecting specific files you need to backup.

Thus, using the combination of two great Acronis' products you will always have an image of your system and backup of your data. This will greatly save you time and reduce your storage requirements.
