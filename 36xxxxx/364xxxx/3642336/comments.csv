Video & audio quality - well, it's over 25 years old, so what would you expect? But the torrent is flawless.

9/10"
,trek1,2008-04-02T20:09Z,thanks ..it rocks. 
,Grapejuice_808,2008-04-04T05:15Z,"...fucking discription. 
do you mean it has the commentary on the movie file so you cant watch it normal?

give us a description mike!"
,pittvakt,2008-04-11T21:44Z,No worries. It's dual audio
,steve__the__pirate,2008-06-28T20:28Z,how do i get rid of the commentary
,junque21,2008-07-03T13:11Z,"Good quality, thanx!  How do you turn of the chatter box commentary? i usually use Media Player.

Not really watchable if you dont know how to do that."
,mike18xx,2008-08-22T03:15Z,"What you don't know how to do is switch audio channels. Oh, wait, you prefer to use a shitty player, so it's obviously my fault.

Christ....ever heard of dual-audio anime?

Fuckin' lamers...."
,lepetitprince,2008-12-02T14:52Z,Thanks for this upload in seemingly good quality (I havn't watched it myself yet)
,MilkyMeajn,2009-01-09T18:03Z,"I read your comment mike, I usually use VLC player
but to be honest with ya I'm pretty much the opposite of a computer nerd, so can I turn off commentary with VLC? if so, how to do it?
thanks bro, Milk"
,samg001,2009-10-27T13:41Z,"For all trying to disable the commentary audio; Use VLC player. VLC Player>Audio Menu>Audio Track>Track 2.

TYVM for commentary track!"
