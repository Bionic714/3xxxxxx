,rachmm,2007-03-20T10:50Z,"This is a perfect copy, just finish it watching and burn it to Nero recode on several copies for my friends.  Actually, they are watching now on their DVD players on a large widescreen TV.  No glitches,  no error, be it on audio or video. Absolutely reccommendable. Keep up the good work, buddy.  Thank you so much. please do not mind those detractors who made negative comments.  You are the first and earliest guy who uploaded this Season 2, Episode 20 with versatility.  Keep on seeding guys. Wish you all the best..."
,MekanikBertil,2007-03-20T11:54Z,"Bullshit no glitches!

,anver0819,2007-03-20T14:41Z,"Thank you. just finished watching. Yes there's a bit of glitch on the 24:27 and not on 24:17 but it is negligible considering the whole movie upload.  On my place where I live[corner of the earth], the most earliest torrent available is very much appreciated regardless of some negligible error.  TV shows here are very delayed even on cabled-connection, that's why we are so excited. Anyway, this is just for entertainment, but if this is a software, of course, errors are not acceptable. Great job, looking forward for your upload of the next episode... "
