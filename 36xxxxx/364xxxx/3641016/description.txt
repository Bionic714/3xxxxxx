During one of the many hiatuses that the band Boston took, the late Brad Delp and Barry Goudreau had this side project, joined by David Stefanelli on drums and Brian Maes on keyboards, both former members of Robert Ellis Orrall's band.  The song "Until Your Love Comes Back Around" was somewhat of a minor hit in New England, but surprisingly for an album that sounds like the lost Boston album, it went nowhere.
This is a rip from the out of print and hard to find CD.
Enjoy and seed!!!
