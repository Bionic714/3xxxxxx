This is AWESOME for long car rides. I keep the CDs in my car at all times and listen to it frequently. Just don't get into an accident while not paying attention to the road."

,jonxjquee,2008-10-20T20:09Z,"oh btw peer gaurdian blocks the bad ips from contacting you

i believe they can still notify your isp but peer gaurdian shuts down the torrent so you know it's being watched"
,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:20Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
