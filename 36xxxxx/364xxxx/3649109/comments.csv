I have always loved Cole's GA Plastic Man, but never knew about Midnight.  Wow! The other strips, particularly Lady Luck are great too!  Thanks a million for uploading.  However, I've been stuck at 90% for days.  Please help me complete this download, and I will try to seed this as long as I can.  "

I later found all these files for free direct download at GoldenAgeComics.co.uk.  Don't waste your time waiting for the seeders to come back on line for this.  I doubt they ever will.  "
