,stationmiek,2009-08-21T23:19Z,"If you get a problem with ""bhconfig.cfg"" (usually if you extract using winrar or winzip), then you need to MOUNT THE ISO using Daemon Tools Lite (or equivalent), and run setup from there.
If you are using Vista or 7 and it records a fatal error, use the 'recommended settings' it brings up in 7."
