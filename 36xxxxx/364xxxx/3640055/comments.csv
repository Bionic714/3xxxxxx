,Kyros3,2007-03-24T11:55Z,"An error occurs when I run setup about a problem in application ""SET1D.tmp"". This error occurs mostly when I run Macrovision's Setups (but not always). Is there a problem with my computer or a problem in this package (package does not contain the protection of the original game)? If anyone has the same problem share your thoughts!"
