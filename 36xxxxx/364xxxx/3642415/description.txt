Overview:	The evil Ching government has taken over and is out to rid the land of the remaining Ming rebel patriots, including the still surviving Ming Prince. Hot on the rebels trail is skunk-haired Ma Yuen Ning, a deadly fighter with weapons called the "bloody birds"- a three bladed spinning device that can cut down trees (which the filmmakers never miss an opportunity to show it doing). Unknowingly, the evil Ching Overlord and his men capture the incognito Prince and throw him in their jail. Cut to the Ming rebel sympathizing Shaolin Temple, where brother Fang Shao Chang and sister Fang Ping train for revenge against the corrupt Ching Overlord. Shao Chang is informed that he does not posses the patience to learn the 18th final form, a style so deadly, to use it wrong can kill you. Hearing word of the Princes capture, they mount a rescue effort to get the Prince before his identity is found out, but are thwarted by the booby trapped jail and a backstabbing Ching spy within their midst. Luckily, the Ming Rebels have a spy of their own, who helps them escape, and the Prince's identity is not revealed, however now the Ching's know one of their prisoners is important. In an attempt to lure out the rebels and destroy them, the Chings move all the prisoners, including the Prince, and attempt to ambush another rescue attempt. Eventually, the Ming rebels get the Prince back and move him to the temple, but they still have a spy within their group, and the evil Overlord, with his Invincible Iron Body Style, his men, and Yuen Ming with his "bloody birds" and his own secret agenda, all make their way to the temple for a final confrontation.
