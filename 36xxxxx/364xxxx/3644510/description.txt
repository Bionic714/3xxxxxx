The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft\'s productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was released to business customers on November 30, 2006[1] and was made available to retail customers on January 30, 2007 which was the same day of the formal launch to retail customers of Windows Vista. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.

Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief among these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports \"Excel Services\", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.

While Office 2007 includes many new features, Microsoft FrontPage has been removed from the Office suite entirely. Its successors are Microsoft Expression Web and Microsoft SharePoint Designer.

NOTE:
This is already in my software suite, but some people were complaining that the suite was to big... so i have split all the files from the suite and uplaoded them seperatly. So now you can download AVG 7.5 Pro, Quick Time 7 Pro, Microsoft Office 2007, Spyware Docto 4.1 all in sepertae files.
