Check out this torrent, it's a list of eBooks that you can download.  it's sure to have what you are looking for.  It is a 12Gb torrent but it is all seperate files so you can choose to download only what you want.  Good Luck.

Also you can download VMware from VMware.com
VMware is software that you install on your computer which allows you to install operating systems as a file.  The then installed OS's act, look and function just like a seperate computer and you can even see them on the network.

My advice to you would be to download the free version of VMware server from their website and then find a good copy of either Linux, Unix or both and install them as a VMware machine to practice on.

The nice thing about VMware is this.  Once you have the OS installed you can go to the properties of the VMware machine, look at the properties of the Virtual Hard Disk, choose the advanced button, there you will see a TICK box for INDEPENDENT and then the radio buttons will become clickable.  You'll want to select NonPersistent.  This will allow you to make any changes to the OS you want and once you power it off all the changes will be DISCARDED so obviously you wouldn't want to do that until after you get the settings put the way you want.

When in NonPersistent mode there is no way to save the changes so if something works for you and you like it and want to keep it then you should remember how you did it so you can do it again.  To get it to keep the changes you simply need to go back in to the advanced Hard Disk properties and un TICK the INDEPENDENT check box, this will allow changes to the OS to stay permanent.

You can set up a whole test environment this way and test out all kinds of things without affecting your physical system.  It's great for seeing how implementing changes in network settings will affect how the network runs and also to see how new or updated software will interact with your current settings.  There's nothing worse than installing new software or updates only to find out that it just HOSED your system.  This way you can be sure."
