David Eugene Edwards, enigmatic frontman and visionary for 16 Horsepower, began recording under the Woven Hand moniker while Horsepower was on hiatus in 2001. (The name "Woven Hand" refers to hands clasped in prayer; Edwards' Christianity ? he was raised the son of a traveling Nazarene preacher ? is a consistent, driving theme in his music.) Fans of 16HP will instantly recognize the same forces at work in Woven Hand ? e.g., incendiary gospel, hallowed folk and mordant tones infused with a high, dark theatricality worthy of Nick Cave.
