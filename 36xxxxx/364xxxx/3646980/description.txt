Music from the computer game 'Jazz Jackrabbit' for the IBM PC.

Original source unfortunately unknown.

This has been converted from Jazz' internal representation to standard tracker module files (36 ScreamTracker III, one ImpulseTracker).

If you run UNIX, use the included 'mksymlinks.sh' script to create symlinks to more sensible names then the internal ones. When running utilities from a random 3rd party (including this one!), check them before usage; they may be programmed to compromise your system.

If you do not run UNIX, and aren't exactly keen on manually reading the script and linking/renaming/copying (whatever applies to your system), you may also download 'jj_music-named', which contains the exact same files with the more sensible names.

Enjoy :^)
