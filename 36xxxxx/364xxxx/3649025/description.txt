     Hailing from Göteborg, Sweden, The Skull Defekts is a new
     music collective featuring core members Joachim Nordwall
     (Alvars Orkester, ex-Kid Commando, runner of Ideal
     Recordings), Henrik Rylander (ex-Union Carbide Productions)
     and people like Jean-Louis Huhta (ex-Anti Cimex, Cortex...)
     and Daniel Fagerström (Chronic Heist, ex-Trapdoor Fucking
     Exit, 8 Days Of Nothing). The band has been doing live
     collaborations with Damo Suzuki (Can) and Lasse Marhaug, just
     to name a few. On Skkull the band is stripped down to the trio
     of Nordwall/Rylander/Huhta and what we get is an all
     electronic album containing 4 long songs. Compared to their
     earlier releases this one takes a more minimalistic and
     monotonous approach but still manages to be heavy as hell!
     Expect total Scandinavian coldness. Digipack with artwork by
     Are Mokkelbost.
