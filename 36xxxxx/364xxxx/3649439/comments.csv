A PASSWORD WOULD BE NICE"
,appletvman,2007-03-28T22:06Z,"the password is ""?""

(thats option-shift-k)

now you can stfu assholes."
,philsh,2007-03-28T22:22Z,No need to stoop to their level appletvman.  Thank you for the password nonetheless.
,therealduckie,2007-03-28T23:08Z,"what do you mean by 'stoop to their level '?

Did I use vulgarity?  Did I call him names?  Did I disrespect him personally?

NO

Get your facts straight."
,helios,2007-03-28T23:10Z,option-shift-k gives me ยบ  that's a small o or cirkle and it doesn't work... 
,appletvman,2007-03-28T23:28Z,"apologies, it should have been asshole, singular, pointed at tba03.

it looks like plenty of other people are seeding it at the moment, so im going to give my cable a break and stop, i'll start it up again later.

also: option-shift-k should give you an apple logo in the standard fonts. if you're having trouble, open System Preferences, go to International, and under Input Menu, check the box next to Keyboard Viewer.

Under the flag that is now in the menu by the clock, click on Keyboard Viewer. Then press and hold option and shift on your keyboard, and in place of k should be the apple logo.

Hope this helps."
,helios,2007-03-28T23:55Z,Thanks for the password. Well the apple logo symbol is different depending on language layout. On my swedish keyboard it's option-a

"
,cruelmemory,2008-03-03T21:46Z,"Password is ? as stated previously (option-shift-k).

If you have a different keyboard/language layout, you can find it under Edit->Special Characters. do a search for the value F8FF (that's the unicode value).

Not the best idea for a password"
