COME IN FROM THE COLD ? THE RETURN OF JONI MITCHELL

BBC Radio 2 - 20th March 2007

Few artists have truly invented a musical genre, but Joni Mitchell is the original singer-songwriter and one of the most influential artists of the rock era. While successive generations of copycats have hoped to win favourable comparison, none have matched the grace and guile Mitchell has bestowed on a distinguished body of work, both in her recordings, as a performer and multi-media artist in photography, art and beyond. 

These two programmes are illustrated with famous and less widely-known Mitchell recordings and with the exclusive first play of material from her new album ?Shine,? expected to be released in early summer.
