sorry, but i will keep seed this since there is so many conencted peers."
,mry1,2007-03-28T00:51Z,"Oh yeah, i forgot to say that it's rar archives so just unpack them with winrar. i have seeded about 7 MB/sec for a while now so hope you enjoy this one."
,pingismacka,2007-03-28T20:02Z,How can I unpack them when they aren't winrar files? -_-
,FuzzyNips,2007-03-28T23:06Z,"pingismacka. right click one of them and choose to OPEN it.  Then, select WinRAR from the list of programs it offers you to try and open it with.  "
,mry1,2007-03-29T10:42Z,"They are winrar archives, else winrar wouldn't been able to open them :)"
,scopax,2007-03-29T16:55Z,"I'm not sure I understand. 
I tried to open all the files with WinRar. It comes up an error saying ""The archive is either in unknown format or damaged"" for every file I'm trying to open.
What should I do? Maybe I didn't understand your instructions, can you plz be more detailed/specefic? "
,piraten12345,2007-03-30T09:12Z,"All of you who can't unpack these files do following:

Install WINrar :)

Then right click on the file flt-cnc3.001 and change the program that the file should start up with to WINrar. 

After that draw the flt-cnc3.iso file out of winrar then i begin to extrat your iso file..

NOTE: you don't have to change all of your .0xx files to open with WINrar only the .001 and then WINrar knows what to do..
