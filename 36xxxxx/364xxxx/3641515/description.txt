Overview:	No team of "Martial Arts World" epic-makers ever matched that of director Chu Yuan and best-selling author Ku Lung. Screen idol Derek Yee is the ambitious, proud master of the "Meteor" style, who becomes obsessed with sword supremacy and goes on a selfish rampage of violence and sex. Master kung-fu choreographer Tang Chia guides a first rate cast (including king screen villain Wang Lung-wei as the "immortal God of Eagle") in one of their most powerful and memorable productions.
