,kent57,2007-03-19T23:57Z,why donÂ´t seed when you are making work for yourself and uploading in the first place - i realy donÂ´t understand this phenomenon...

This is not a very popular torrent, and I will only be seeding it till there is enough seeders to keep the torrent going. There is now, so I won't seed it anymore, but upload new torrents instead. Now it's up to those that downloaded it from me to seed.
Learn to seed after yourself, so those that uploads the torrents in the first place can keep doing so."
