,Tom Traubert,2007-03-23T19:51Z,"Every uploaded torrent is gret, but, isn't this the kind of movie that the full quality instead is worth waiting for? ... A very epic movie?"
,sk8flawzz,2007-03-24T18:51Z,"THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT!!!plenty of seeders, once u DL, just use winRAR and youve got a great one, sounds is good but the video is WOW great"
,Mizled,2007-03-25T15:45Z,Video quality is great but you hear static and crackling the WHOLE movie. Not worth the download IMO.
,mrstad,2007-03-25T20:00Z,"Thanks for the movie, but do any of you have problems with decompressing the movie .rar files? I get the message (and I have tried different rar and stuffit programs): «An error ocurred attempting to expand «name of movie file» The archive may contain damagede content.

This I get on alot of other downloads to. Any help would be nice... :-/

Thanks!"
