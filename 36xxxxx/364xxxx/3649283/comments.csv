thnx 4 the game but i am unable to get it to work:( i burned the image to dvd(using NERO) but it didnt work. i have been reading that you must use swap magic if your ps2 isn't modded but is there a free program that will work instead of swap magic?       just so you know i have been seeding this 4 u 4 a while now(30kb/s) i would greatly appreciate your help:)"

,thantos123,2008-01-27T00:31Z,"Just to confirm, this game is *NOT* compatible with pcsx2 - it simply crashes after the initial loading screen.

So for all of you hoping to play Call Of Duty 3 on a PC - you'll just have to wait until a more stable version of the emulator to comes out. 

In the meantime, you can visit

for the current compatibility list."
