Udo Erasmus is an international authority on fats, oils, cholesterol and human health.  Udo received his B.Sc. in Homours Zoology from the University of British Columbia followed by graduate studies in Biochemistry and Genetics and a PhD in Nutrition.

Poisoned while working with pesticides, Udo turned his attention to the field of nutrition to find the answers doctors were unable to give him.  Several years of research led him to write the groundbreaking Fats and Oils which earned him a Ph.D. in nutriton. He went on to pioneer the technology for pressing and packaging flax and other fresh oils for human consuption with the enhancement of health, rather than self life, in mind.

Udo has since become an international recognised authority on the role of fats, oils, and cholesterol in human health.  His current best selling book, Fats that Heal Fats that Kill, contains research on common and lesser known oils with healing potenial such as flax, olive, fish, and evening primrose.

Over the last two decades, Udo has appeared in nationally syndicated radio and TV shows and given more than 2000 media interviews and seminars, educational audiences across the US, Canada, Europe, Asia and Australia on the essential components of good health.  In 2002 he published a guide entitled "Choosing the Right Fats", and continues to research nutrition and health for his next book.  In 2005 Udo Erasmus was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Canadian Health Food Association for his conttibution in the field of health and nutrition.
