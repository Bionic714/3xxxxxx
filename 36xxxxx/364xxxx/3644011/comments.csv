You should need a KeyCD after upgrading, if you are upgrading a MK.III BMW Navigation computer running V.15 to V.17 software version. Higher than V.17 shouldn't need this CD. See my other torrents for different KeyCD images for different software. Record the KeyCD at low speed 2XA as the Navigator might not read other formats for the KeyCD."
,ptamd64,2007-04-14T20:40Z,This v29 works in e46 with mk4?
,maew4,2007-05-12T11:28Z,"""This v29 works in e46 with mk4?""

Yes it should.

V28 should also word. There isn't much difference between V28 and V29."

,neiloakley,2008-01-14T02:20Z,"I have downloaded this and in the rar file there is one mdf file of 486bytes and one mds file of 302mb. How do i burn this? All the guides only tell you how to install it once burnt, or how to burn the KeyCD which I dont need.

Do i just burn a normal CD or DVD with these files in the root directory?

It will be going on a MkIV nav system

Thanks"
