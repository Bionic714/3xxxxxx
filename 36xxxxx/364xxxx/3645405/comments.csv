[T],tmax666,2007-03-23T04:48Z,"Well it looks like your cows never left the barn.  NO SEEDING.  Be a good farmer and seed a little, will ya mate?"
,georrge,2007-03-28T15:31Z,"Well, the control of seeding is not up to me. That's all controlled by the programs. 
I have uploaded this 17 times now and I am still seeding it. I have done more than my share. If you have been patient you will probably have got som MB by now, huh?"
