,Rabidrichard,2008-06-30T01:05Z,"Hi flame!
Would you have a good copy (like, say, 192 VBR) of that classic South African band/album ""The Flame"" (1969, produced b Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys)? I know it's not psychobilly, per se, but it's got that same wild and free Spirit!
And thanks for keeping ""the flame"" burnin', bro!"
