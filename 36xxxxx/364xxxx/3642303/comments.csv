,Durrok,2007-09-08T04:47Z,mkv is a type of video file. You will have to downloa d the video codecs for it. I believe videolan will work for it.
,mike18xx,2007-09-26T06:56Z,.mkv isn't a video codec; it's a container format. Most of the highest-quality anime is released in mkv container.
,Poetessx,2009-01-01T09:05Z,"To play the mkv format  you can use VLC or CCCP players. The subs come out better on CCCP  but you can play a larger variety of formats on VLC. Go here to try out both!

,jbluebear,2010-08-27T04:10Z,I was downloading fairly fast and then all the seeders dropped off. Can someone start seeding again? I'm really close. I'll seed for a while.
,2HYbLR,2011-05-22T21:44Z,good one
,scottishvixen,2012-05-12T14:05Z,"Yikes this is gonna take a while to download.
Don't worry I'll seed though."
