He's behind bars and still trying to rip off people and make them dumber.  Tell me, how did you feel when he said, ""just let me go"" at his sentencing?  Your leader is a criminal AND a coward."
,SSG Dicky,2007-03-25T07:37Z,I sort of like you guys that believe in all this shit.  Your the same people that buy my crap on ebay.  Not to mention you fall for the dumbest scams.  Thus providing me with hours of entertainment.
,theshop,2007-03-26T06:05Z,"I can't believe you guys so ignorant of the united States of America's Constitution.  (www.thelawthatneverwas.com/)

16th amendment was nerver legally ratified.  It's a non-law.  There is no law that require the average working american to file a Federal Income Tax.

Even if there were a law, it would only apply to 10 mile square area of Washington D.C. (united States Constitution - Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 - http://www.law.emory.edu/cms/site/index.php?id=3081#7656)

Hmmm...put behind bars for a non-crime.  Tell me, how do you feel knowing you support the mafia known as IRS?

I sorta like YOU guys when you guys eventually find out you're being brainwashed like the sheeps you are, only to realize it's too late for you to get out of the system."
,chardos,2007-04-30T07:50Z,"Just thought I'd say good on you 'theshop' :) I feel it's a shame that its only people with sub-primate I.Q's write in only to slag off what they don't understand, and have no intention of actually seeking real truth. 
Sometimes I wonder if some people did come from monkeys? B.T.W aweirdly, Jesus Christ is our leader, not Hovind."
,death734,2007-08-03T05:32Z,"lol! it is so pathetic when you try to discard everything the messenger says by attacking him personally! (aka killing the messenger and not paying attention to the message)

also agree with last 2 comments about taxes and leader. 
America freedom to fascism was a good movie on fraud by our government known as income tax. that couple from NH, usa that was on the news a month ago or so should of mentioned that film."

,Magotchi,2008-04-14T00:07Z,"I'm seeding this for the long-run, and have been for about a month now.  Just so anyone downloading it knows, though, I'm not seeding the seminar videos themselves via this torrent.  I'm seeding the higher quality versions of the seminars over at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3494191/Creation_Seminar_-_Kent_Hovind_DivX ."
,dark_gantoris,2008-08-27T11:33Z,"Gotta love the Biblical quotes, as if they prove anything. The Bible was written by men."
,Tamarind777,2008-11-17T02:03Z,Please seed this. I'll be one of the few on here who are thankful for it.
,yaerin,2009-06-02T02:34Z,"Hey thanks for this! @ aweirdly, did you actually watch the videos in this torrent as well as the creation seminars that are free on drdino.com? If not, you can't be talking. If so, you should provide a detailed counter argument to show that you're not the stupid one. However, Hovind and his son provide astonishingly amazing evidence against evolution and other stupid religions like it.

Anyway, thanks for the torrent and keep seeding! :)"

,Jonny645,2009-08-30T03:51Z,"""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""

,Tamarind777,2010-01-28T08:36Z,"Attack the man when you can't do any better. Hovind has done so much damage to the religion of evolution. Look how stupid you are: Darwin only had a religion degree and yet you call HIM a scientist. At least Hovind used to teach high school science and he puts evolution to shame, that's why you hate him so much. Maybe you should listen to one of Hovind's presentation and see how intelligent he is. He asks very simple questions of evolution and the very best of you can't answer any of them. For example, let me see your response to this: how do you prove that fossilized bones passed on it's genes? In order for a fossil to be related to anything after it, you have to go on the assumption that it passed on it's genes. This is just common sense, something that evolution lacks big time. The very thing you're trying to prove is what you assume. That, my friend, is a logical fallacy. Evolution is replete with them. The only sense evolution makes is NONsense! You guys who call yourselves atheists don't have a problem with evolution, no matter how foolish and nonscientific it is. What you really have is actually a problem with God and judgment. I am quite sure if there was no judgment associated with God, you all would disband the idiotic religion of evolution in a minute. You love sin too much, that's your problem. No matter, you can try and close your eyes and stop your ears as much as you want, but guess what? There is still an impending judgment and you can't hide! "
,h1vem1nd,2010-05-02T02:47Z,"Ratification of the 16th amendment was completed on February 13, 1913 by the requisite 36 of the 48 states that then existed.
So yes, the law HAS been ratified and is legal.

Hovind's dissertation for his (non-science based) doctorate is a joke, and Patriot University is a diploma mill which will grant PhDs for a small fee and no actual education.

Furthermore, Hovind's ""evidence"" against evolution has been debunked over and over again.
The very fact that evolutionary biology is used every day by biologists & epidemiologists to cure diseases & create vaccines proves that there is some merit to evolution.
Also, he argues against strawmen: conflating evolution with the Big Bang, claiming it has anything to do with the existence or lack thereof of any God or gods, and ignoring the fact that many who accept evolution (including scientists) have no problem accepting it alongside Christianity and other religions.

Tamarind777, your argument is nonsensical and bears the hallmarks of conspiracy-theorist madness. Try talkorigins.org for refutations of everything you've said... or just ask a biologist.

,Dadutta,2010-06-09T02:19Z,GOD BLESS KENT HOVIND - May he be released from his unjust punishment
,350nova,2011-06-19T16:26Z,Thanks for the upload friend
,400382d,2011-10-11T03:21Z,The powers that be couldnt argue against him so they jailed him.  The hilarious thing is hes still teaching in prison.  Dont you worry your pretty heads. the Prison States of America are coming. Papers Please.
,kevelev,2012-04-04T23:27Z,"h1vem1nd, That ratification WAS NOT legal.  if you look more closely, that amendment was worded differently depending on which state received it at which time rendering those amendments inconsistent from state to state.  It was a farce, a hoax.  It was a treasonous supplement to the constitution & they purposely rushed it in under the guile of Christmas break when the majority of the Supreme Court Justices were on holiday & unable to fully analyze it (very much like what they did with the Patriot Act).  If it were legal then how do you explain court battles won & citizens NOT legally having to pay an income or state tax?  Look it up if you don't believe me, or better yet, just watch the documentary Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo

Next, please explain to me exactly what the difference is between ""evolutionary biology"" & 'biology' which is the natural science that studies life & living organisms.  I'm confused, because evolution can mean like 7 different things and if you are talking about the ""Theory of Evolution"", then I think you forgot the ""Theory"" part of it there.

Also, can you please be more clear in citing actual examples & proof of how Kent Hovind's evidence has been ""debunked over & over again""?

When I say proof, I mean actual hard scientific evidence that proves beyond reasonable doubt, not opinions.  So many of you evolution theory believers still forget it's just that... a theory (a really bad one with no evidence).  You also like to call your theory ""science"".  It's not science, it's religion no matter how much you & Mr Dawkins like to pretend it is.  You always state opinions with NO facts in these little debates.  I'm sick of it.  PROVE YOUR THEORY ALREADY!  Your racist theory has been around since the 1800's, you think you'd be able to make us a universe by now.

Also, the fact these other yodels on here continue to take punches below the belt talking about his incarceration only proves they would rather dodge the debate than to back up their cowardly theory.  I'm sure we could dig up some skeletons on Mr Dawkins if we wanted, but notice how Christians don't waste their time with childish, mundane slurring or find loopholes to imprison people.  It really shows how transparent you & your theories really are.  I guess they go hand in hand.

Oh & to everyone else...Stephen Hawking, the crippled little troll, cheated on his wife.  Not sure how that is even possible, but I'd rather trust someone that goes to jail standing up for the law, his rights & beliefs than an immoral ego maniac.  That's all for now.

Live & be good to one another.  God bless."
,sos21,2012-06-23T02:06Z,"@kevelev.. hey man, you are wasting your breath!..these guys think that when they use the word theory it has a different meaning than when we use it ..ive uploaded some of these videos up onto youtube.. illuminatiisos.. & yea, all the insults & no proof to back up their fairytail..

peace :)"
