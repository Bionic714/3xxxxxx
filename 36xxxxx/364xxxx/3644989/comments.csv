canÂ´t figure out Spanish.
Thanks a lot for this one maxibonelmejor"
,hfw,2007-03-22T23:47Z,"Thats a new one...

Also here this IPno. 38.100.24/27 comes in and chokes the uploader and the torrent. I must say its a creative way to ""stop"" piracy... I'm impressed :-)

BUT, why does not the seeder - maxibonelmejor - bann theese IP's ?
Is it not possible and does that ""superleech"" multiply itself like cancer ?

In the long run...
Is this the method that will be used against torrents ? DC is to obvious so torrents has until now been unstopable - any counter measures from our benefactors (developing clients) ?"
