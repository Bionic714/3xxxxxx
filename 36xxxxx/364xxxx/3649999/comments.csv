By default, the arrow keys on the keyboard are used as well as ""ctrl"" (button B), ""alt"" (button A), ""tab"" (select button) and ""return"" (start button). I'd recommend to use an external keypad instead. Hold down ""alt"" and press ""return"" to switch between windowed and fullscreen mode."

If you suspect an infection, just check it for yourself before opening (which you should do for any executable of unknown origin by the way).
