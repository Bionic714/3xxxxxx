,GamesoulMaster,2010-11-28T07:59Z,"First of all, a trained monkey could burn this to disc. Hell, Imgburn will do it and even pick the right settings automatically. Second, the odds of a corrupt file are so low, there's no point to splitting this into small volumes. And if you're prone to corrupt files, you have only yourself to blame, as I've downloaded many terabytes of data via torrents and have yet to get a single corrupt file."
