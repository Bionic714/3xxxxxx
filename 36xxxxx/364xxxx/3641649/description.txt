SYNOPSIS: 	Action hero Steven Seagal stars as former Navy SEAL Casey Ryback in this high-octane action thriller set aboard the battleship "USS Missouri." A hero with a mind of his own, Casey has been demoted to ship's cook for insubordination. But he's still got the heart of a patriot, and when William Strannix, a dangerously wacked ex-CIA operative-turned-terrorist takes over the ship, Casey hangs up his chef's hat and goes into attack mode. The stakes are high: Strannix, in an act of vengeance against the U.S. government, plans to launch the battleship's nuclear missiles at Honolulu. Casey -- assisted by a stripper who was stranded aboard the ship during an aborted farewell party -- must race against the clock to save the U.S. from an atomic nightmare.
