Synopsis: When a shipment of food and money meant for a drought-struck region is hijacked in a vicious sword battle, the leader of the transport (Lee Chan-Hu) is framed for the theft and tortured in front of his family. But it is all an elaborate plot by a local official to assume total power over the entire region. Escaping into the wilderness where a group of his loyal troops await, Lee Chan-Hu is pursued by a government agent intent on finding out the absolute truth of what is going on. But the truth is something that no one wants exposed, and a bloody assassination is something that those marked for death have no chance of surviving...or do they?
