Trouble at the Henhouse is the sixth full-length album from Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. It was released in 1996.

Henhouse was somewhat softer than their earlier albums, much like their fourth album Day for Night. The title comes from the cover art, a photograph by Avery Crounse, which is also called "Trouble at the Henhouse".

"Ahead By a Century" is widely considered one of the band's classic songs, and was one of the biggest chart hits of their career.
