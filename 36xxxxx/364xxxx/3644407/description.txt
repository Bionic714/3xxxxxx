- UEFA EURO 2004 -  EA GAMES(c)



The Game:
Like the World Cup, UEFA's Euro tournament takes place every four years--pitting 16 qualifying teams
against each other in group and knockout stages until only one remains. Also like the World Cup, 
which was last held in both Japan and Korea in 2002, this year's Euro tournament has been deemed 
worthy of its own game by EA Sports. UEFA Euro 2004 might have only a fraction of the teams and 
features found in this year's FIFA offering, but the gameplay and options it offers are actually 
sufficiently different from those found in FIFA 2004 to make it a worthwhile purchase.
