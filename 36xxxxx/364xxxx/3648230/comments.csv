,wofflan,2007-04-03T15:53Z,Har seedat 33.6 Gig nu
,lasvegas123,2007-04-10T09:05Z,Tackar. Måste ladda om den igen eftersom jag råkade slänga den vid 79%  :-(
,Tee_Scott,2007-04-24T00:04Z,"Hi, I have tried to collect all the torrents in this series to make them available for further downloads.
These are the ones I miss parts of at the moment: 6,7,9,10,11,13,14,16,17,18,19,21,22,23,26,27.
If i get hold of them I'll try to keep them available for at least about 1 month from now.

Please seed them again.

Actually many of the files seem to be collected from some satellite or cable radio station. The sound quality also lacks some quality as mentioned in a former torrent posting. Nevertheless I judge this source of high quality soul funk of the 80's to be choosen with exellent insight and taste and it should in great parts serve as a reference material for anyone with a serious interest in the subject.

Thank You for the time you spent compiling this series. It helped me to find the artists and titles of some songs I never found while browsing around at Groove, Vinyl mania and Record Hunter in Stockholm.  ;-)

Also check out DiscoSwede. He also did a great job."
,wofflan,2007-04-27T15:00Z,"Hi tee!!
I´m seeding it now not all at the time but i will seed em´all!!"
,marängen,2007-05-10T10:42Z,"Nice samling...men...låter skit, tyvärr. Går inte att lyssna på.
Varför 128? Distar och låter illa.
Aldrig mindre än 192!
Synd...när du gjort så bra jobb.
Varför inte lägga upp den i 192???
"
,wofflan,2007-05-13T02:55Z,skit påre gubbjävel!!
,Tee_Scott,2007-05-14T00:49Z,"Hi Wofflan and all of you who read this!

Thank You for seeding the material once more. At this moment all of the torrents are alive and available. Please use this material to remember or discover a time then a group of obviously really skilled musicians dominated the arena. If You like the songs in this collection really much and want them in better quality, many of them are available in the internet music stores or on eBay.
If You are a fanatic, like me, then flea markets and the record fairs are good grounds for hunting. Sometimes You just need to pay peanut money.

Of course one could always ask for making the songs available in better sound quality in this forum, but given the facts of life one should be very grateful that someone spends his time to make these collections available at all.
Once more Thank You for doing that!

If You hunt in these waters, You now got some names to type in... some others might find a reason to look in the closets to find their old 12"" ready to be re-released.

If You eventually change Your mind, I believe there would be some happy people waiting for one or two more Woffelmixes to happen...

,knuftobor,2008-02-03T21:59Z,"Most of these songs do NOT start at the begining, they fade in!!!!

,Bradley27,2008-10-04T18:10Z,"Hiya alot of these packages are not downloading, some get to 99% some no further than 0.1% and then just stop!"
