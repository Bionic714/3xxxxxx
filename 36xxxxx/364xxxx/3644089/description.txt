Untitled third album from Icelandic space rockers, their follow-up to 1999's acclaimed 'Agaetis Byrjun', which won the US equivalent of the Mercury Music Prize. Eschews the epic string and keyboard-drenched sound of that album for a rawer,more "live" feel, whilst being, if anything, even more stately and majestic.
