,joshp123,2008-01-09T19:43Z,"I have downloaded 99.9% of this (no seeders shown in uTorrent, only 2 peers), so 1 piece is missing- unfortunately this piece is part of 2 files :|

However, 5 of the 7 files that have downloaded fully do not appear to play correctly in iTunes- only two can be added to the library, iTunes simply acts as if nothing has happened when you try to play (via Windows Explorer) or add to the library (through iTunes), and only adds two of the 7 downloaded tracks to the library when you drag and drop the files from Windows Explorer onto the ""Music"" icon in iTunes.

Then when trying to convert from .mp3 to .aac format using iTunes, one of the tracks converts fine, but one returns ""an Unknown Error has occured (-50)"" with no description of what has actually happened :|

Has anybody else either completed the download, experienced the problems with adding to iTunes, or experienced the problems converting the songs? Or is this just me being unlucky..... :P

I will try using WMP to play the songs and see if that works, and then try converting them to another format if that doesn't work; if i can convert the songs, ill upload them for you :) (and put the torrent on the bay, of course ;]  )"
,joshp123,2008-01-09T19:50Z,"Ok, just tried in WMP, at first it said ""The file you are trying to play has an extension (.mp3) that does not match the file format. Playing the file may result in unexpected behaviour. Do you want to try and play the file?""

so i click yes and get

""Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.""

Hmm, looks like the files may be infact .wma or .mp4 but renamed as mp3 by accident possibly... ill try that...."
,joshp123,2008-01-09T19:52Z,"Ok, well renaming them as .m4a or .wma didn't work....

Ill try looking at the file header information......."
,joshp123,2008-01-09T19:57Z,"Ner, not working, and cba to find out whats wrong with this.....

So my advice is to only download tracks 8 and 9 unless someone else says otherwise (it could always be my comp screwing up you see... but i doubt it)"
