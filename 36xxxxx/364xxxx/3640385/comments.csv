,Teemu R,2007-04-05T22:49Z,"Hi! The serial is: 55B1-461E-D155-4C0A-26A0-8459-B1F4-BD81

It was in the unl-mhcsr.nfo file."
,Markner,2007-04-12T16:10Z,Oh thank you very very much for the serial!! :)
,agv,2007-04-30T15:15Z,"I loaded the game, changed the screen resolution and it turned black. Now i cant change the screen resolution back to what it was. IÂ´ve even unistalled and reinstalled the game but the screen is black, i cant play. Any ideas? thanx"
,sycat,2007-05-02T23:30Z,"Please seed, the game is only 320MB and i am pretty sure some 10-24 Mbit ""hardcore torrenteurs"" can afford the extra bandwidth used.

Looks like a really nice game by the way, if you are into WW2 strategy gaming. Lat game played was HoI Doomsday but this one looks even better. Good reviews too.
