,loylachick,2007-05-16T10:20Z,Thanks so much for this! :) My little girl LOVES baby einstein! :-) I've been looking for new ones. Thanks again. 
,malcinblue,2007-06-14T14:55Z,excellent quality. Perfect for the development of babies and highly recommended. This version runs for just over 30 minutes then repeats in Spanish.  good one kollll..... 
,BLUdRAGON,2007-09-17T07:00Z,"It should really have been stated, but perhaps the uploader didn't know. It is a great quality Baby Einstein vid. Thing is though, the sign language they are using is only standard in America. Nothing wrong with that--just not much point in anyone outside of America downloading it as the sign language used in their country is bound to be completely different from the American one."
,MACinized,2008-01-04T03:50Z,tnx for the share kollll. will download it later & will surely seed. hopefully this is not the Baby Wordsworth (Around the House).
,generalyuehfei,2008-04-08T04:29Z,"Please seed, I have been looking for some of these.   I am downloading/seeding 24x7"
,BangUchiha,2009-01-25T12:53Z,thanks :D
,drbeyond,2009-04-20T13:19Z,can any one help me to show how I can compile these files to work as a movie ?
,smashley21_2006,2009-07-12T00:10Z,"drbeyond:

You can download a free program called Nero Start Smart. That's what I use, and it's really easy to use, and an excellent program. You can download it at  

http://www.brothersoft.com/nero-startsmart-download-59638.html

Once it's downloaded, and you open the program, there are icons at the top. Go to the one that is for ""Photo & Video"" (icons looks like a film strip). Then click on ""Make your own dvd-video"". Then on the right side it says ""what would you like to do""...click on ""Add Video Files"". then find where you saved the baby einstein files, and select them...put them into the program one at a time, because if you select them all at once, it might put them in the wrong orders. After that, click next, and you can create the menu you want. you can select menu pictures from what the program has, or choose your own from your computer.

hope this helps. if you have any other questions, just ask :)"

,neenachoo,2009-12-10T20:15Z,Is it just me or does this one not work? It won't burn with Windows DVD maker and it only comes out as a soundless sample with ImgBurn. What am I doing wrong?
