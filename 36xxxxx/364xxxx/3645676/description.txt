Synopsis

Japan´s top anime creators bring a richly romantic action/adventure fantasy in an imaginary planet where retro-futuristic sky vehicles permeate the skies. Against this lavish background are the lives of young and heroic van ship sky porters --- Claus and Lavie - who are forced to take on the mission to deliver a mysterious girl Alvis to the battle ship Silvana. Before they know it, they become entangled in an aerial adventure between two countries gripped in an eternal war of magnificent air battleships.

10 years of excellence culminates into another masterpiece from GONZO (Hellsing, Vandread, Blue Submarine No.6)..
