Review from Amazon.com:

"Recorded in one afternoon in the Holly Springs, Mississippi, hometown of  9-year-old blues great R.L. Burnside, A Ass Pocket of Whiskey documents a single noisy, spirited session with Burnside, his sideman Kenny Brown, and the punk-bred blues reconstructionist trio called the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The pairing of JSBE, led by a white Ivy League dropout turned downtown New York scuz who poses as a hard-living blues rocker, and R.L. Burnside, the last of the real down-home badass bluesmen of the Mississippi hills, is strange--perhaps sacrilege to blues purists--but oddly appropriate. And the moments of pure musical chaos caught on this record--both cross-cultural and cross-generational--sound entirely within the realm of both acts. With its unorthodox accompaniment (including wheezy theremin and Spencer's trademark shouts), the album is probably not the most fitting introduction to Burnside. But as the oldest man ever to record for the hip indie-rockers at Matador, no doubt he gladly sacrificed juke-joint obscurity for the chance to appear on MTV's 120 Minutes. --Roni Sarig"

It's good to see R.L. getting some attention from the "Black Snake Moan" movie and soundtrack. This torrent is 100% complete and is available from me from Monday through Friday from 7:30AM to 5:00PM EST. It will be more and more available and the download will be much faster if you, the downloader, SEED! At least for a while. I know it eats up bandwidth and makes it hard for you to download other stuff. Hell, I'm guilty of leeching too. We all are. But this album is so good it would be a crime not to share it.

I hope you enjoy this recording as much as I have for the past 8+ years.
