About The Ore:

"As a science fiction short film, there were many hurdles in bringing this to completion - a process which took most of 2006. With a budget of $3,000 our goal was to hopefully challenge the preconceived ideas of what a low budget sci-fi flick could offer.

We hope you enjoy the film. If you are interested in learning more about it, and how it was created, please visit our store page where you can purchase the DVD - which contains over two hours of behind-the-scenes features."


"We started out wishing to tackle a genre and subject matter rarely seen in short films, and hopefully maintain a high level of production value on a very small budget. The script was written early in 2006, and polished during our trip to Park City, where our previous film Texas Fortune was invited to screen. Filming took place over seven days at the end of March in Los Angeles, and over 200 visual effect shots were completed between then and October.

The Ore was shot on Panasonic's new HVX-200 HD camera, and finished on a series of Apple G5s running Final Cut Pro, After Effects, Syntheyes, and Cinema 4D.

The film is currently available to buy on DVD, with tons of extra features."
