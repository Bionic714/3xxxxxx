,PirateOnPirates,2007-03-25T08:30Z,"THE RELEASE BY ""RELOADED"" as found at ISOHUNT at 4.36GB's is a fake. It's ADWARE. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Haven't tried others yet."
,FreeTheWorld,2007-03-25T09:16Z,"Thug - You really should read the history behind Stalker - SoC, before commenting...
This game is a what-if concept - There are TWO incidents: One on the 26th of April 1986 (the one we all remember) and one on the 13th of April 2006 (that is made up).

Is this file any good btw? I don't trust it at all. (then again - cheating is not rewarding and hence never fun...)"
