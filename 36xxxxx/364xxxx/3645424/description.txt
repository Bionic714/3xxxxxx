Ben Templesmith draws from The Looking Glass Wars universe, Hatter M being a story of a particularly mad hatter trying to rescue princess Alyss.  The usual incredible artwork of all Templesmith's work, applied to a 4 issue long constant chase scene all over 19th century europe.  Torrent includes all 4 issues plus the bonus issue 2.5 which details a lot of the background to the story for people unfamiliar with the LGW take on Alice in Wonderland.
