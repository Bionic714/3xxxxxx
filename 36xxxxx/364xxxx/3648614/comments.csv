,marcf28,2007-09-08T13:37Z,"Well I think it's an awesome torrent thank you Betty! The silent tracks could've been worse - coulr've been full of Kylie or something! 

Thanks again!"
,marcf28,2007-09-08T15:15Z,"Oops - I just found that on the album 'Minx', the filenames don't match the actual songs. It's quite an easy thing to sort though: 

From no1 - no5 (I'll serve you well) are fine.

No 6 should be No11 (Over 21), then after that each song has the title of the previous song. So for example, the song named 'Space between the sounds' is actually 'All in a rage'.

If you have software that edits tags and can rename files according to tags (such as dbPowerAmp), it is easy to sort.

Still loving the torrent!"
