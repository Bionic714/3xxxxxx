DESC:
------
Windows Home Server is designed to be almost diabolically simple, 
and after two and a half years of active development, Microsoft feels 
like it's arrived at an interface that is simple enough "even for mom"
while being powerful enough for even the most jaded power user.


OTHER INFO:
------------
general information ""Windows Home Server, known by the code-name Quattro,
 is designed to enable families with multiple PCs connect their home 
computers, digital devices and printers so they can easily store and 
access their digital media and documents.
