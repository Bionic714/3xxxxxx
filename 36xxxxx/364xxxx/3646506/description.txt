Cards as Weapons was first published in 1977, and has been out of print since then. The only way to get it nowadays is to buy it online, for a lot of money I might add.

Book Description: With over 100 how-to pictures - including the famed topless card throwing series - this book will show you how to throw playing cards farther, faster, and harder than you ever thought possible, diagramming such card throws as the Boomerang Card, the Long-Distance Spinner, the Flick, the Back-of-the-hand Flick, the Finger Flick, the Foot Flick, Card Juggling, the Lethal Four Card Fist, the Butterfly Swirl, the Sea Urchin Spin, and the Dolphin Dart. Shows alternative throwing methods such as the Martin Lewis Method, the Thurston Grip, the Jay Grip, and the Herrmann Grip. This is the book that made Jon Wedd famous for his appearance on MTV's Unfiltered news show. Ricky Jay held the Guinness world record for card throwing in 1976. Obscenely funny and very rare.


I can throw cards at least 80ft :)
