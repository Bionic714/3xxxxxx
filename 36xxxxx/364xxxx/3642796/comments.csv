This is a must have codec.

Very early release... you cant even buy it yet (only selected costomers gett it)"
,m!g,2007-03-20T23:37Z,"please post contents of
""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CoreCodec\CoreAVC Pro""
branch of registry (basically serial/user data), it wont work without it"
,heion,2007-03-21T02:29Z,How do you install this? I must be stupid...
,christopherw,2007-03-21T03:28Z,"filter appears to be broken / corrupt, fails to register correctly and errors out nastily when I try to manually register it. Try 1.2 or use 1.6 pro."
,m!g,2007-03-24T23:45Z,"1.6 pro? wtf there is no such thing so i assume it was a typo, 1.2.0.0 (nov 15) is latest working avilable
the 1.3.0.0 is also a joke in terms of an update because no real bugs were fixed (according to changelog)
and this is usless if we dont have mentioned registry branch or whatever they came up to enforce copyrights, well pfff we still have FREE ffdshow"
,Osaka,2007-06-04T15:57Z,"To ""install"" the CoreAVC decoder, open MediaPlayerClassic (MPC), go to Options->External Filters->Add Filters->Browse...-> and locate the .ax file.

Then set it to Prefer.

Very simple."
