,ebbaah,2007-03-26T14:37Z,This one is missing something. Does not work.
,raider56,2007-03-26T14:53Z,Agree with ebbaah. Something is wrong with this one.
,hbhzth,2007-03-26T17:58Z,Season finale - a thriller of an episode. I think BSG is one of the best TV-series ever made!  Thanks TiAMO and ORENJi for making for making this available online TPB.
,hbhzth,2007-03-26T18:01Z,"Worked like a charm for me... Always been good  BSG episodes on TPB, I think."
,d2027132911,2007-03-26T18:40Z,How's the sound in this episode?
,MystikIncarnate,2007-03-26T23:03Z,"audio is the typical standard for BSG... loud. almost too loud.

my output seems to clip during the intro, creating distortion, but beyond that, seems fine to me... i've only watched bits and pieces so far... i'll come back if it's any worse."
,MystikIncarnate,2007-03-27T00:40Z,"good ep. good quality. good torrent.

as usual, good stuff from TiAMO."

,roccauk,2008-03-15T15:42Z,"thanks for making my life sci-fi-frak-tastic tiamo.every ep was good quality, very selfless of you and i appreciate it my friend."
,donkey942,2008-07-04T06:19Z,"when saying it doesnt work, first you should get a good media player,VLC media havent found and torrent file extension that wouldnt play in it!"
