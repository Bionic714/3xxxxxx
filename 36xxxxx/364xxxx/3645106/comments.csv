PLOT:

The Care Bears are the sweetest and friendliest animals
one could ever hope to meet. Living in the clouds
in their own city of Care-a-lot,
these lovable bears come down to earth in their cloud mobiles
to help children with their problems.
Whether it is being the new kid in school or feeling insecure
about new braces, no problem is too small for the Care Bears to handle.
Along with the Care Bear Cousins who live in the Forest of Feelings,
the Care Bears make the world a happier place
with their motto of caring and sharing.
