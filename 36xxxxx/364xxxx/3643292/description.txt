Overview:	Shot in Mainland China, this perversely lavish, self-consciously new wave martial arts film...is a languorous, sultry, sensuous action reverie. Accompanied by wailing flutes or solo electric guitar, it's set in a desert wilderness populated by a gang of angst ridden, lovelorn swordsmen-for-hire. One is going blind, another turning amnesiac, the rest are haunted by their various memories. The names Kurosawa and Leone come tripping to the tongue in attempting to describe this brooding m√©lange of extreme tilts and outlandish angles...Ashes of Time is mostly anticipation with sudden inexplicable episodes of slo-mo zap blurs of martial art tumult, as well as mystically congruent earthquakes and geysers. Just as the flickering network of shadows efface the identities of Wong's swordsmen and women, the complicated plot is nearly overpowered by the film's anticipatory buildup, convoluted flashbacks, and cathedral lighting.
