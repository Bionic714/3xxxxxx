,freebsdhost,2007-06-20T14:50Z,"This one might have a subtitle stream encoded in it (it depends on the DVD/DVD image I use to encode from) - make sure you have an up-to-date xvid or divx (6.x) codec, or a divx home theater certified dvd player :)"

Now there's ONE seed.  ONE!!!!!
Me, only.

When you get this, SEED it for a while.  It's a good flick.  Martians.  Jack Nicholson.  Dog-to-human surgical substitutions.  Fun.  SEED."
