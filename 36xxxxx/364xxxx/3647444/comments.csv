,eldard,2007-03-29T17:27Z,You guys are better off with the ripped (divx/avi) versions as they have the same or better quality with this crap. And the entire file size is just about 8 gigs compared to this 21 gigabyte crap.
,kenny999,2007-03-29T20:34Z,"I am better off without anybody's wisdom-giveaway. I just don't get what's that urge that make some people comment other's entertainment. I want this DVD5, for me it looks just fine on TV. Wanna DiVX ""crap""? Fine, get it and pass by in peace."
,dr_ishmael,2007-03-30T07:17Z,"eldard, not everyone in the world owns a 52"" widescreen plasma HDTV like you do.  Some of us can't tell the difference between these compressed DVD5's and the real thing because we still have 27"" (or smaller!) CRTs.  So please just shut up and leave us in peace to download what we want.

To Mauser23: thanks muchly!  *Most* of us here appreciate what you are doing.  Keep 'em coming!"
