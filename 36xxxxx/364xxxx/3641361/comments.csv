,Clapton,2007-03-18T13:53Z,Is this the new Ubisoft videogame or the old Konami one? 
,Clapton,2007-03-18T16:57Z,"I see Zamorak, WOW is the new one!! I played the demo and is awesome, very very playable. It's hard to see a PC arcade game with the precision of a videoconsole game.  Prince of Persia team is behind this one. I'll  buy a gamepad  to enjoy this game 100%.Thanks Koll!! "
