,AMeerkat,2008-04-17T05:24Z,"Any seeds for this? Right now, there are only users with partials (61.2%, 25.7% and 9.0%) currently online sharing the file and i'm stalled at 51.7%.

Any help on this please?"
,AMeerkat,2008-04-17T13:08Z,"Erf, it's got interlaced video, but it's much better than the encode available on MySpleen. 
The moments of stable animation (still shots and period pauses) are crisp and clean as a whistle, but the mid-to-high-motion action is streak-filled and have some mpeg-related artifacting on them.
Other than those infractions on the video quality, a pretty good VHS-Rip."
,HaywoodJablomie,2008-12-14T21:49Z,Thanks so much!  Even my usual underground video store didn't have a copy of this movie-you ROCK
