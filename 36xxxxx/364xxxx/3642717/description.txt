Overview:	A remake of/sequel to the classic "Executioners From Shaolin", this is kung fu cinema at its most absurd and most fun. Lo Lieh plays the dastardly White Eyebrow monk Pai Mei, who--besides being able to achieve weightlessness, so he simply floats away from his attacker's blows--can suck his testicles into his abdomen! Our hero, played by "baldhead" Gordon Liu, receives a sound thrashing from Pai Mei early on, but later masters the graceful embroidery technique from kung fu babe Hui Ying Hung. Needless to say, he finally gets his revenge when, after some spectacular fight scenes, he attacks Pai Mei's "vital spot". Ouch! Ninety minutes of pure bliss.
