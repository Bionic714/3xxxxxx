,airman123,2008-01-17T15:55Z,"If you have downloaded this torrent, then you have helped put PSS out of buissness. That means they will make no more addons. For proof, go to ""http://www.phoenix-simulation.co.uk"" and see for your self. I hope your happy!"
,39-A,2008-01-17T22:14Z,"Thank you, you seeding DICKHEADS!!!

You've just made a very good simulation programming company BUST! Shit heads! You made the rest of us suffer with your torrents!

STOP SEEDING AND DOWNLOADING"

**chuckles** Yeah . . . . Okay, kids.  So if you are so anti-pirate, why the fuck are you trolling around the Pirate Bay?  OH!  Wait . . . . You are one of those hypocrites that came HERE to download your product because PSS went out of business WITHOUT notice and refused to give their customers ANY chance at al to FTP their product for backup before just ripping down their site.  But you want to justify YOUR form of piracy by leaving a comment slamming other pirates.

By the way -- it's on record that you downloaded the torrent, too, so you WILL (and his IS an order from a Captain) learn to do the following:

-->Quit being a hypocrite

-->Learn some grammar (such as the VERY obvious difference between ""your"" and ""you're"" that they teach in grade school -- you know -- the school you dropped out of).

-->As another poster suggested on one of the many torrents you posted on: ""Shove your head up your ass"" (Note that THIS is the proper use of ""your"").  This will make it a bit easier to kick you off the plank.  **laughs at you**

And, yes, I do have time to copy/paste this to you in a few of the torrents you commented (AND downloaded) because I, too, am downloading these files which I legally paid for thru PSS and rudely found out I have no access to after a hard drive reformat.

**shrug** I am guilty of not backing the files up to a CD or source separate from my computer.  But, hey, thanks to P2P clients and sites like the Pirate Bay, pirate or not, we legal users can now rectify this situation.

Have fun playing with your downloaded files while blaming others for your own guilt, hypocrite, kids.

AH!  I forgot to mention a big THANK YOU to those of you sharing these files for those of us to back up.  I don?t care about pirate status or not ? it?s awesome to be able to get these files after they conveniently disappeared from the server without notice.  PSS was still in their legal right to stop trading without notice, but it was bad business practice and it is guaranteed that if the ever go back into business, such shady business practice history will fuel pirates even more.  Sorry, PSS, but that?s sad when you don?t at least give notice and force customers to go to P2P sites to get their files.  The proper way to do it would have been:

Send an email:

?Hey, sorry, we?re going out of business in ? say ? 1 week.  Please log into your accounts and you will now find an FTP RAR (or ZIP if they are that cheap) copy of your files to download for a proper backup.  We apologize for the inconvenience.?

WAIT . . . Oops.  That would have been too easy and honest.  So IMHO they had this coming.

Again, thanks to the P2Pers for enabling some of us to re-back-up our files."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-04-02T18:17Z,"Okay -- not sure why TPB converted my quote marks to question marks, so I apologize to other readers if this post looks funny O.O"
,93tb11,2008-04-30T18:30Z,"Yeoldecaptain .. well said sir, couldnt of said it better myself. and 39-A and Airman.. grow up lol very strange how you knew it was downloadable free ,, unless you searched it, so you just pissed on ur own bonfire.. go back to your mommas ass."
,JeremyF,2008-05-12T08:44Z,"awesome! thanks, I'll be seeding this for ages"
,bogey4brian,2008-06-03T23:44Z,"WTF? BT downloads have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with PSS taking its ball and going home. There website now claims this, but I spent plenty of time in there forums trying to get there piece of shit 777 installed and never saw a huge flux of users at any given time. Just admit the truth PSS. You make shitty products that are nowhere near the quality we have come to expect from PMDG, LDS, Flight 1 and others, and you had to go away with your tail between  your legs. PSS SUCKS."
,ekseed,2008-08-06T13:46Z,FS9 still crashes to the desktop even though I have the voroni in the FS9 directory. Can someone PLEASE HELP ME?
