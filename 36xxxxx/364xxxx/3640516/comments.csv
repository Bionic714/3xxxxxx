Finns denna i svensk version? Någon som vet hur man fixar det?
"
,KKELTIKK,2007-03-23T03:48Z,This is brilliant! Anyone have links to others? 
,Admin13,2007-03-25T20:45Z,I created a better one. With the same apps. You can find it here. http://mikicun.blogsome.com/2007/03/16/thinstalled-microsoft-office-2007-enterprise-v3/
,rc71,2007-04-04T15:44Z,"Hey Admin13.
Since you have some skills, may suggest a Office 2003 version.  I personally hate the new Mac interface that 2007 has.  Just wondering if it's possible.
Thanks"
,rc71,2007-04-04T15:53Z,Oh you have created an Office 2003 version.  Found it on your website.  Thanks.  Now hope I can dl it.  One site is down and the other is a rapidshare type site that doesn't want to give up the file.  Hmm.  Torrent would be nice. 
,[Maga]Zine,2007-10-04T05:07Z,im hoping I can just take everything out besides WORD without it messing up cuz 500megs is a little much for me.. :/
,sweeznit,2007-11-15T23:05Z,"Hey chawrash, this is great! I can now go anywhere and just pop in my usb drive and use M$ Office. Would you mind telling me how you did this please because I need to try and figure out if I can make a portable Sony Vegas. Or maybe you can release one lol. Hahah anyways.. great work, Thanks."

,mastaphunk,2008-03-02T10:09Z,"Why can't I save?? Pls answer cos otherwise this is pretty awesome!!

Thanx"
,gindovic,2008-03-25T21:30Z,You can't save anything! When you try to save a document in word it just closes the screen.
,manzilla88,2009-03-24T18:34Z,I was really hopeful but I can neither open files or save with this. However thanx for the effort.
,manzilla88,2009-03-24T18:43Z,Ok I spoke to soon. sorry that i gave you a negative vote. To be exact. On my genuine copy of windows vista I can neither open nor save files. BUT on my pirated copy of xp it works like a charm. Whenever I try to open up files with this programm on Vista it 1. the screen turn that pale color of white and then tells me that it has to close and then 2 gives out an error code for unknown software. So in theory im sure this works even in vista but in real life whatever kinda pirate prevention shit vista has is preventing it from working. So again sorry for the negative vote. And keep up the good work.
,ElmerBeFuddled,2009-09-08T02:36Z,"Cheers Chawrash, 
This is the dogs doobries. The first portable I've come across with VBA still active. Means I can use all the luverly macro's I created for the official trial that crashed after SP2 install that now blocks legit install. Think I'll be staying ''portable''.
Big thumbs up from me."
,ElmerBeFuddled,2009-09-08T02:40Z,"And the best bit, no fekkin Outlook. Damn, I did the Outlook word, now I have to go and flagellate myself with barbed wire as penance !!"
,mauriciolondoo,2010-04-01T17:13Z,McAfee says it has VIRUS!!!!
,finny6,2010-05-01T20:24Z,"Contains the Ardamax keylogger - check these directories:

AppData\Roaming\Thinstall\Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007

or

Application Data\Thinstall\Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007

check for a 52kb file with any name.  Check it on virustotal if you don't believe me.  It gets matched by 70% of virus scanners."

,westjgames,2011-03-20T13:07Z,"Pointless using OpenOffice.org, as it does not support 2007 files! LIFESAVER!
I bought Office 2007 and the school did not have it! Now I can use this at school, and use al the fancy effects! THANKZYOU!"
,Clemo56,2011-03-26T12:13Z,"This one won't download, mabe i am doing something wrong....."
,Charlie_A1234,2011-05-08T03:29Z,"Yep, it's a virus DON'T DOWNLOAD. I don't know how to report it but whatever."
,amylsex,2011-05-09T13:50Z,"What many of you clowns don't understand is how antivirus scanners work. ANY file with a .VBS (Visual Basic Script) file (the key to how MS programs work) in it will be identified as a virus. If you would learn a little bit more about how code interacts with with an OS, and not just have a knee-jerk, fear reaction when you run a virus scan and you get an alert, you'd be much better off. Every .VBS file has an element of scripting code that virus scanners consider harmful. For those of you who live and die by antivirus programs, your fear of the unknown is killing you. There are definitely uploads with malware attached here, but don't warn people about ""viruses"", when you have not got the slightest idea what you are talking about.  A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. This file is clean. Thank you, Chawrash."
,ProphetZarquon,2011-05-15T18:52Z,"Works great on two of my XP sp3 machines with Microsoft Security Essentials.

Fails to launch Word on Win7, giving ""insufficient memory/disk space"" error during Thinstall extraction. Fails to launch Excel on Win7, giving Norton (yech) Trojan warning, which is a false positive occurring when Thinstall tries to extract the Excel app into a temporary directory. I ran the Thinstall under XP again and located the affected files, then ran McAfee, Norton, MSE & AVG scans, also keeping ""real time"" heuristic detection running at maximum: The files are clean, but the method of extraction is incompatible with Vista/Win7.

I tried it on a fresh, updated Win7 install with no antivirus & it still fails. Then again, my new-in-box valid, fully legit 2007 install also failed due to Genuine Validation, so I guess I'm not that surprised.

Can anyone recommend a portable Office 2007/2010 that functions under both XP & Win7?"
