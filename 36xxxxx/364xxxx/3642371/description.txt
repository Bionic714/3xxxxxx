The Audio Club is the joint effort of Ashley Alan-Lee and
Brooks Buford. The dynamics of the smoking-hot
pretty-blonde-LA-thing mashed with the borderline dirty (pun more... 
intended) southern rapper from Atlanta makes their first
single "Something Serious" something worth hearing no matter
your taste. Ashleyâ€™s definitely the eye-candy factor here,
workin it out with one lucky stripper pole. It's the perfect
smash of pop, hip hop, electro and 80s glam to get the
dancefloor shaking.
