In the surreal cartoons, the eponymous Salad Fingers inhabits
a sparse and desolate world where he obsesses in the
"delightful" feeling of the textures of various objects
on his "salad fingers" (his fingers are long, green,
and strangely shaped.) He especially enjoys rusty articles
(particularly spoons); he also enjoys blood (or as he calls
it, "the red water"), dirty water taps, and nettles, the
sting of which he finds pleasurable. His fluctuating, gentle
monologues serve to entice the viewer into a bizarre world.
When Salad Fingers speaks, his dialogue appears in loopy
text on the screen.
