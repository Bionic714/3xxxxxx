,Rious,2007-03-19T21:13Z,who watches this shit?
,mike18xx,2007-03-19T21:53Z,Anybody with kids. Next stupid question?
,Rious,2007-03-20T02:43Z,"Well, kinda got that.. 

but im guessing not all of em got kids.."
,Rious,2007-03-20T02:45Z,"Oh, and since it's in english, and most kids don't even know english, it kinda restricts the people with kids that can download it..
"
,mike18xx,2007-04-22T01:59Z,But who cares what YOU think?
,alfonso4358,2008-01-15T08:54Z,Bless you mike18xx for this torrent and all of you fabulous seeders for keeping it alive!  MANY thanks!!
,yarrik7,2008-02-01T16:44Z,"The Powerpuff Girls is easily one of the most awesome kid shows ever, this side of Dexter's Laboratory."
,zedun,2008-05-01T13:48Z,You don't have to be a kid to love this. Thanks a lot mike18xx.
,LordVeldrin,2008-05-09T23:33Z,"lol Rious.. no offence (yet), but get a better view of the world out there.. even barely living grandads may be watching this. but if u wanna know..

im now 23, and i think PPGs are cool.
before u or anyone brings it up, ye i got a life. a considerably nice one imo. including a job. sure im a computer and even more a game nerd. but that ain't stoppin me from watchin tv (Cartoon Network all the time :P) now after this is done, i think i may download Dex's lab collection.

btw..

THANX mike18xx !!!! ur awesome!"

,thesoulsthealer,2008-06-07T02:54Z,"Thanks for this huge pack!

Only one question, can someone comment if the movie is the widescreen version (available on the UK DVD, iirc) or the fullscreen one? Thanks. :)"
,HappyHelvete,2008-06-07T18:25Z,"The movie is the fullscreen version, with good quality sound and picture:)"
,chequeredmaniac,2008-07-06T19:02Z,"Just want to say very very nice job. I downloaded this for the fun. My friends had been talking about it in school and I just said hey, I've got nothing better to do with my bandwidth. Boy was I surprised. Best torrent I've ever downloaded as far as the creators work and effort. There are even torrent files for a few other series, one being Dexter's lab which I really want. Just download this. And mike18xx I really respect the work you put in on this. "

,baronobeefdip,2009-01-25T21:50Z,"htis is the best torrent i have ever found on here (next to ed,edd n eddy complete collection love that show to death)

anyway i am a dude and atleast 18 years of age and i do infact think the power puff girls are cool (only the hanna barbera cartoon version the original, that anime version is a complete joke and the personality of the girls are just pathetic)

well anyways i am not ashamed of liking a show like this but people think i am weird anyway, any chance that someone could add the new 10th anniversery special episode here i would really appreciate it

and thanks for the torrent mike18xx you just made me relive my childhood"
