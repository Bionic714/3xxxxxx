BTW to all downloading this have in mind that this is the 2007 platform game NOT the first TMNT game for PS2 that came out in 2003 (the cartoonish one). If anyone has that ISO I will gladly seed it."
,elijohn23,2011-12-20T08:37Z,"Hi guys, I got this downloading fine. But when I played it on the console, the screen is flashing up and down... It's really unplayable.. Here's what I did after downloading it. I extracted one of the zip files (part 01) and burned the iso file that came out of it to a dvd. That's about it. Any advice as to how to get this to play properly?"
