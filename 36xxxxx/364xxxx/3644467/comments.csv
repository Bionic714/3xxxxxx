,cardgum,2009-12-12T19:27Z,"Holy God!!! Awesome Collection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are GOD OggWorld!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S. I loved Jazz Jackrabbit as a kid!"
,cardgum,2009-12-13T01:37Z,"By the way, the way I installed Jazz Jackrabbit 1 is that I extracted the contents of this .iso using Winrar into any directory ie. ""C:\poopydoodoo"" afterwards I opened Setup.exe and installed from there, no need for DOSbox to install as it didn't work for me. after installing, you may then run the game in DOSbox by mounting and opening JAZZ.

PS. I don't think you have to install, you can extract the disk and run it using DOSbox from there. Because installing it does the same thing as extracting it before... ya."
