Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) has a beautiful young wife, money owed to him, and a job he loves. He?s a thief.
His job goes sour when he gets caught on security camera tape. His fence, Bergman (Danny DeVito) reneges on the money he?s owed, and his wife (Rebecca Pidgeon) may be betraying him with the fence?s young lieutenant (SAM ROCKWELL).
Moore and his partner, Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo) and their utility man, Pinky Pincus (Ricky Jay) find themselves broke, betrayed, and blackmailed. Moore is forced to commit his crew to do Bergman?s one Last Big Job.
Will Bergman shop Moore to the police? Will Moore?s wife trade him in for a younger model? Will Blane and Pincus cut their losses and get out? Who is to be believed, who is to be betrayed? Won?t someone who?s lied once, lie again?
