Turmoil outside the walls of the temple lead Cliff Lok to go there and find the answers to save his country from the Manchus. Nothing could prepare him for the tests and trials he will face inside the walls of Shaolin: martial monks, hidden chambers, and the 18 Bronzemen.

"The Best Of Shaolin Kung Fu" boast an amazing cast and crew. Leading actor Cliff Lok is the star of such classics as "Duel Of 7 Tigers", "Kung Fu Genius", and "Choy Lay Fut". He is also one of the chairmen of the Hong Kong Martial Arts Association. Lead villain Carter Wong has played both good and bad guy roles in his career. And the choreographer of all the action is one of Cliff Lok's real-life teachers, Chang Siu Pang. His credits include "The Buddhist Fist", one of the all-time classic kung fu films. His portrayal of the head monk for the 18 Lohan Chamber in this film is nothing short of astounding.
