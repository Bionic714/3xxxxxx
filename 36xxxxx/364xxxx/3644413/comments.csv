,jewbot,2011-01-16T02:47Z,would have liked to play it wouldn't run. used 256 color compatability mode to get install.bat to work....the problem could have been with the manual unzip i had to do as your custom installer would not work on my machine(Nice sountrack though). It would extract most of them and then stop before finishing. i believe a file could be missing.  
,arxfatalis100,2011-02-20T17:20Z,"hey,

i wrote the same comment on another arx fatalis torrent and then i tried this 1 but have the same problem.

i downloaded this because i lost my original cd but i cant find anything i can mount/unmount with deamon tools. 
please help!!!!"
,Backitup,2012-02-29T21:26Z,"FOUND KEYLOGGER ON THE ARX.EXE FILE. I don't think it was a false positive because it didn't find a keylogger on another Arx.exe file.

If you got this data from somewhere else and decided to start your own torrent with it, then you need to check it and find another Arx Fatalis to upload. However, if this is a torrent from your copy of the game, screw you buddy, stop trying to steal people's info dirtbag. You're the reason that Democrats are going to one day control the internet, they're going to use people like you as the excuse, and the people won't challenge the loss of freedom because so many people like you infest the internet.

I will say this though, that's a massive compression system. Goes from 180MB to 745MB by the time it's done unpacking everything. Wow."
