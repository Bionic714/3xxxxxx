Plot summary:

In the near future, Russian rebels have taken over one of the ICBM bases in the USSR.
Alarmed by the prospect of a rebel strike, the U.S. sends the U.S.S. Alabama, a nuclear
ballistic submarine, to watch over the base and retaliate in case they launch.
While on patrol, the submarine is attacked and the radio systems are knocked out.
An emergency message received during the battle is only partially recovered.
Captain Ramsey believes it to be the order to launch on the rebels, while XO Hunter wants to wait for a confirmation message. The conflict escalates into mutiny as Ramsey and Hunter fight for control of the Alabama's nuclear missiles.
