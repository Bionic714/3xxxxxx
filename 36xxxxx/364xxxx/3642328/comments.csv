,Jucka,2008-02-03T00:15Z,"Islam is being abused like all the rest of the world religion...all religions sucks except buddishm wich is goood at keeping 0 tolerance for violence :D i will download this movie! 
"
,mike18xx,2008-02-04T09:31Z,"Islam isn't being ""abused"" because Muhammad really was a child-raping warmonger thief mass-murderer.

-- The fanatics are following their Korans chapter and verse."
,Bokkian,2008-02-04T20:47Z,"Thanks for sharing.

And it includes all the extras, which some other copies don't have.

Great upload!!!"
,vascoa,2008-03-02T21:45Z,"Agreed Mike18xx

anyone that thinks Islam is being abused need to know more..
google this

Islam, what the west needs to know video google
(In fact can you mike upload this video for us?)

also, muslin sesame street youtube
and them see the other videos that are related to that one.. 
Remenber, ISLAM incentivates (its written in the kuran) them to LIE to protect ISLAM, and they will everyday to live among us.. otherwise we would feel obligated to kick their asses back to the middle east.
There are no moderate muslins, because if they believe that the kuran is the direct word of god, then all I mean ALL of them are potential terrorist.. 

they kill their own children and women (today) for jihad (jihad, in german actually means Mein Kampf and they really loved hitler.. if he was a spiritual guy he would be muslin, for they are totally anti-semitic)

ALSO ISLAM IS NOT A RELIGION (or at least I don't care about that part of them) THEY ARE A POLITICAL SYSTEM TRYING TO IMPOSE YOU US.
THEOCRACY IS COMING, ironically starting by killing theo (van gogh)..

they want NO  FREESPEECH, less rights for women, no rights for gay, Sharia LAW, no rights for non-muslins etc etc etc.. just look at saudi arabia or iran and you see how they want to ENTIRE WOLRD TO BE..."
,vascoa,2008-03-02T21:58Z,"and we know that Islam means submission!!!
and that they actually are a religion of peace!, for when we are all islamified and submissive or dead there will be peace.. you know once I have it all there will be peace sort of thing..
they are hegemonistic..

there are so many things wrong with islam I would need to write an essay on it and I don't have the time.. 

AND I'M not racist for islam is not a religion, I'm not islamphobic (for i do NOT fear islam), i'm not christian (I hereby renounce the holy spirit, there I'll never go to heaven since that sin is not reddemable), nor jewish or any other religion..
BUT I AM AN EUROPEAN, AND WE SHALL NEVER SUBMIT!!!!!"
,vascoa,2008-03-02T22:02Z,"after seeing that documentary and videos on you tube.. 
you might want to take look at SIOE, google it
Stop Islamification Of Europe
sioe,wordpress,com (for example there are many on the internet) and why don't you forget about your political correctness for once because they are taking advantage of that and we are doing nothing!!"
,vascoa,2008-03-02T22:03Z,"youtube,com/user/patcondell
youtube,com/user/pfict
youtube,com/user/Ritter1001
we shall not give up all that Europe stand for without a fight... even if that means putting asside some of our most deep beliefs and principles..that is the most dificult part for all europeans.. and with muslins lying all over europe on the media.. people believe.. but now we have seen what they are capable of
And in the near future you'll see more and more of their true face.. so REACT, no time to relax..

Think for yourself, get informed,spread the word,cheers all and Peace"
,vascoa,2008-03-02T22:08Z,"btw mike, still starting the download but that seems like a very good compitation.. 
I'm starting to believe that we must put some money where our mouht is..
I'll try to compile a DVD, with your stuff, the Islam, what the west need to know.. and anything I find that as credit (mostly will be from muslin TV channels I guess).. and burn dvds and give them away to people for freee.. 
Spread the word.. that is the fight at the moment"
,Kazumael,2008-03-24T21:19Z,Something all naive people should see.
,crawler71,2008-03-30T10:29Z,"To the above (zakimar) you are the product of
your damn race, you poeple highlight everything to promote you holy war (jihad) against the west, israel and america and all the 
other non believers so just go fuck a goath you
muslim busterd!"
,rockstar11998,2008-04-04T08:30Z,"zakimar - You sound like you are a supporter of terrorism to me.  Do you any history at all?  Saddam Hussein was a big time murderer.  Sure we had to kill a few innocent people to take down his political power but he never did anyone any good being in power.  As for those who still die they are either too dumb to get out of the way when we are trying to take out terrorists or they are terrorists or supporters themselves.  In wars the innocent sometimes get hurt.  God will sort out whose heart was pure and those who were spreading hate and violence.
Please watch the following to get a clear picture of what is being taught to average Muslims today at Mosque: ""Israel, Islam and Armageddon"", ""Undercover Mosque"", and ""What the West Needs to Know"".  If you don't get good links here try emule and mininova."
,120896,2008-04-04T12:45Z,So much unhappiness. So much anger. There's where reside hates. Like fire burns dry twigs n leaves.
,rockstar11998,2008-05-09T18:14Z,"vascoa - I laugh at your statement that you will never go to heaven for renouncing the Holy Spirit.  In order to be cast into outer darkness - the place for those who won't get a degree of glory at all - you have to know the truth completely first and say that God doesn't exist while you are more or less looking straight at Him.  It's not as simple as you might think.  Very few fall into this category.  There is a place for you if you live a good life but still never become Christian.  It is still considered damnation though because you will be damned or stopped in your eternal progression.  People in general use the word damnation incorrectly.
I totally agree that Islam should be stopped from spreading though.  I know it is indeed a religion but of the Devil.  This religion does seek to take over the world by force.  That is not how a true God would do things.  He allows His children (every human) free will and lets them make their own choices so that they can exercise faith in Him.  Without faith you cannot progress and become like Him.  I do like how you want to spread the message by making DVD's and such.  I am sharing this stuff with my family and hopefully they will spread it and so on.  We all need to be better informed of how evil Islam is and what their true intentions are as described in the Koran."
,mike18xx,2008-05-16T08:31Z,"Zakimar: ""I've never seen so much shit and propaganda. The US has killed over 1 million Iraqis....""

Zakimar, you're either a flat-out liar, or a credulous boob.

Which is it?"
,SpareParts,2008-05-26T03:35Z,"Saddam Hussein killed more of his people (by proportion) than Hitler did.

Another good book - ""Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam"".

van Gogh was just the beginning.  I'm glad to see there are Europeans willing to fight for their freedom.  There is hope.  "

,Wake_Up.,2008-11-11T04:43Z,"No religion or society has been as responsible as Islam for invasions, intolerance, genocide, massacre, civil war, annihilation of other cultures, abuse of women and children, persecution of non-believers, and general inhumanities.
Islam as a religion or belief system should at least decrease these problems, and yet it has failed like none other. Instead Islam has been used to justify and magnify human evil for 1500 years.

At the very least Islam has not proven a reasonable model for civilized success.
Islamic countries are constantly in civil war.
Islamic countries have either no tolerance for non-Islamic beliefs or brutally subjugate non-Muslims.
Islamic countries demonstrate the worst abuse of women.
Freedom of speech doesn't exist.
Wherever Islam goes all non-Islamic culture and belief is destroyed. Art, libraries, architecture, are all destroyed if non-Islamic.

The most extreme slaughter and suppression of critics & dissenters:
Hitler's Nazi Germany,
Stalin's Communist Russia,
Mao's Communist China,
Pol Pot's Communist Khmer Rouge,
Mussolini's Fascist Italy.
Saddam's Islamic Iraq,
Khomeini's Islamic Iran,
Omar's Islamic Taliban,
Abd al-Wahhab & Ibn Saud's Islamic Arabia, and
Tamerlane's Islamic Asia,

These empires fit together like puzzle pieces.

Islam has always been a fertile ground for the rise of ultra extremist militant fascist movements.
Wherever Islam goes in the world violent militant extremists magically appear as well.
These problems find their roots in the books, teachings and examples of Islamic leaders from the very beginning.

And don't try to apologize for these fascist Islamic empires by saying every country has it's problems; it would be like apologizing for Ted Bundy & Jeffrey Dahmer by claiming everybody has their problems.

For an excellent list of factual and historic articles:

,Esmad3,2008-12-09T21:43Z,"I'm not a religious person and in many ways I would like Islam and other religions to disapear, but certainly not by genocide. Seeing Islam as a threat to our way of life in Europe is just wrong. Islam just doesn't have the power, political, economic, or spiritual, nor is their any realistic way for it to attain that power. Promoting that point of wiev only leads to rascism since the line between race, religion, and tradition is blurry"
,Esmad3,2008-12-09T22:07Z,"ziphone124: While I do agree with many of your points still, you acuse others of having a ""DOGMATIC WORLD VIEW"" while giving the impression that so do you. 

""ITS A HISTORICAL FACT TODAY THAT SPAIN LIVED HARMONIOUSLY AMONGS JEWS,CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS"" 
Perhaps, but they where still conquerors. Some cases of later western colonization was quite peacefull, still that doesn't make it right. Also the history of the big arab and persian empires is bloody and violent as well, it just happened a longer time ago. But what does that matter if you choose to think in a historic perspective and use something as Al-Andalus in a modern discussion?"
,fuwad84,2008-12-16T02:22Z,"Wow nice to see the nutjobs are in full bloom tonight! 

OH SHIT LOOK BEHIND YOU! ITS ISLAM RUNNN!!!!

hahaha you white people get scared of everything, first it was Muslims, than it was blacks than Jews and now Muslims again - when will you learn.

Oh well!"
,fuwad84,2008-12-16T02:30Z,"Also I would like to add: 

by all means PLEASE keep up the good work of slandering, alienating and threatening ALL Muslims, especially the hard working, morally decent, law abiding ones - you know, most of them. 

It makes my job of recruiting martyr's MUCH EASIER and I do love high quality new recruits( i.e. the ones with money, lack of criminal record and friends in high places)"
,w33z3l,2009-02-02T00:40Z,"Fuck islam and fuck you.  Go worship your Quraysh moon god and your cube.

OP, thanks for putting this up - the more people know the truth about this ripoff ""religion"" perpetuated by a thieving, murdering, pedophilic false prophet (so he could raise an army to conquer nations), the better.

All one has to do is look at all those poor bastards living over there in the dirt... islam is and will always be stuck in the stone-age.  

Dar-al islam never spread worldwide thanks to the efforts of Charles Martel, the Reconquista, etc - and never will thanks to modern organizations committed to stopping and eliminating islam.

In essence - you're fucked.

Seriously guys I have more respect for liberals in this sense because at least they do what they say they're gonna do...which is nothing! Unlike you guys who say things like ""death to Islam"" or ""lets deport all of them"" are any of you ever gonna accomplish that? The answer is NO!

,sevenarmy,2009-05-19T04:50Z,"ray for the peace of Jerusalem, for the welfare of it, for all good to it, particularly for the uniting of the inhabitants among themselves and their preservation from the incursions of enemies. This we may truly desire, that in the peace thereof we may have peace; and this we must earnestly pray for, for it is the gift of God, and for it he will be enquired of. Those that can do nothing else for the peace of Jerusalem can pray for it, which is something more than showing their good-will; it is the appointed way of fetching in mercy. The peace and welfare of the gospel church, particularly in our land, is to be earnestly desired and prayed for by every one of us. Now, 1. We are here encouraged in our prayers for Jerusalem's peace: Those shall prosper that love thee. We must pray for Jerusalem, not out of custom, nor for fashion's sake, but out of a principle of love to God's government of man and man's worship of God; and, in seeking the public welfare, we seek our own, for so well does God love the gates of Zion that he will love all those that do love them, and therefore they cannot but prosper; at least their souls shall prosper by the ordinances they so dearly love. 2. We are here directed in our prayers for it and words are put into our mouths (v. 7): Peace be within thy walls. He teaches us to pray, (1.) For all the inhabitants in general, all within the walls, from the least to the greatest. Peace be in thy fortifications; let them never be attacked, or, if they be, let them never be taken, but be an effectual security to the city. (2.) For the princes and rulers especially: Let prosperity be in the palaces of the great men that sit at the helm and have the direction of public affairs; for, if they prosper, it will be well for the public. The poorer sort are apt to envy the prosperity of the palaces, but they are here taught to pray for it.

,nutella59,2011-05-06T19:36Z,"How funny...  JUST AS leftists in the '30s did not want to make war to German NAZISM in the name of peace BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE and Hitler armed Germany to its teeth, which cost 80 million dead; now the same leftists and phony ""pacifists"" call fascists those who want to STOP FASCISM, now islamo-fascism, islamo-nazism...
Some people never learn from history... Or, MAY BE THEY HATE JEWS SO MUCH and think it's all because of them and it is only the Jews who are going to pay...
