This is acollectionof three concerts and hard to get B-sides. 

The concerts are 

1. A charity concert in Glasgow in december 1987. It features Derek Forbes, Johnny Marr and Chrissie Hynde in one of the encores. Its a audience recording but well worth a listen. 

2. The Glastonbury festival in 1995. Great quality and a good selection of tracks.

3. Birmingham in 2006. Lots of songs off the current album and a great selection of older tracks. 

The B-sides include a cover of Prince's Sign of the Times, but mostly live tracks

Enjoy.
