A comedy film about a brave 12th century wealthy count and his hilariously idiotic servant, in their efforts to undo the death by magic spell of his fiancee, seeks the help of the town's wizard to travel back in time to save her.  But something goes wrong and they, instead, travel forward into the 20th century.  

Here, they learn about life in the future and, in turn, teach a few things about love and honor.

They are not just from another time ... they are from France!
