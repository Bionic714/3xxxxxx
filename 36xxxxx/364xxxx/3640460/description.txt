'Son Of Evil Reindeer' is the second album from the ever expanding Reindeer Section. Headed by Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody, and joined by members of Belle & Sebastian, Mogwai, Arab Strap and The Vaselines, to name but a few, the album continues with the gentle lo-fi indie rock of their debut release. Included are guest appearances from Idlewild's Roddy Womble and Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake.
