,WinnieXL,2007-03-25T03:30Z,does this work when you have changed hardware in your gateway pc? 
,dentman,2007-03-25T05:50Z,"Cowboy thank you thank you thank you!
I deleted the backup hidden partition thinking I had the backup disk and when I tried to use the recovery disk it was for my laptop! You are a life saver!  "
,DaMoose74,2007-03-25T18:02Z,"How recent or up-to-date is this. My reinstallation disc that came with my old Gateway(2001) is pretty much useless unless you enjoy downloading SP1,SP2& all other updates. Boo on that idea I know. I only did that once and that was enough for me. I would hope all that is included on this. Thanx cowboy."
,cowboy103186,2007-03-26T11:09Z,"I do believe it installs SP2, but if it doesn't I suggest downloading autopatcher. it is much quicker and easier than using windows update."
,DaMoose74,2007-03-27T10:09Z,This disc worked like a dream. This is a pro xp version. I wasn't able to activate after because I had home xp on my machine when I bought it. But there's workarounds for that. I guess there has to be 1 hiccup somewhere. I still think it was a great up. It only took about 18 min to re-install windows + SP2. Ciao.
,dentman,2007-03-31T21:58Z,"I got it but have not tried it out. I am seeding for everyone who needs it.
 Glad it's XP Pro perhaps it has the SATA drivers my recovery disks needed but did not include.
 I wonder if it's worth putting this back on the 8GB partition or just reformat and use disk if necessary. Any thoughts?"
,rhoyzz,2007-05-31T07:37Z,Please seed i really need this one... My Restore CD got damanged
,davidstjohn1,2007-06-28T21:05Z,Is there a serial you can give me I have none for a gateway all mine dont work and I am stuck on the enter product key screen.

,leocity101,2008-04-30T07:28Z,"Hey i've got a Gateway ML3109 laptop which came preinstalled with Windows Vista HB and I need the recovery disc. Can anybody help me out, my e-mail address is pilot-leo@hotmail.com

Thanks in advance !!!"
,spyke100,2008-09-06T10:02Z,What is the workaround for those with XP Home? If anyone knows?
,scottethomas,2008-10-01T06:47Z,I downloaded this file and copied to cd but can't get my brother-in-laws laptop to see it during boot up. I checked bios and the cd/dvd drive is first in priority. Any ideas?
,scottethomas,2008-10-01T07:00Z,I put the disc in after boot-up and it starts copying preload files then a pop-up asks what program I want to run with the cd content. Need some help.
,kingpen,2008-12-02T02:55Z,"You need to burn as an image not just copy it to the disk. Burning it as an ISO set it into the correct format for installation,

,1luckey3,2009-06-02T03:11Z,Will This restore my hard drive to the exact contents it had when the PC left the factory???
,1luckey3,2009-06-03T04:10Z,"How do I run the program???

,FixItt,2009-11-01T02:33Z,thanks   but my laptop needs SATA drivers first otherwise this install says there is no hard drive in the laptop :/
,JMan1c1347,2010-01-31T03:51Z,any1 know if this'll work on a flash drive...
