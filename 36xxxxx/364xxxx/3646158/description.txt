Road Apples is the third full-length album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip.

Released in 1991, the original title of the record was Saskadelphia, but the record label considered it "too Canadian." As a joke, they re-titled it Road Apples, slang for horse dung. After the album was released, they created the Another Roadside Attraction festival ? this name was another joke referring to "road apples." The album was recorded in New Orleans, and although most of the songs were finished by the time they arrived, "Little Bones" was inspired by a local taxi driver.

The album is often cited by fans and critics as the band's finest work. As with most Tragically Hip albums, Canadian themes appear in the album's lyrics. "Three Pistols" is an English translation of the name of the Quebec town Trois-Pistoles, and refers to Tom Thomson, a Canadian painter, as well as Remembrance Day, the Canadian commemorative day for its war dead. "The Luxury" refers to the fleur-de-lis, provincial symbol of Quebec, while "Born in the Water" is about the controversy surrounding Ontario municipalities (particularly Sault Ste. Marie) declaring themselves "English-only" in the dying days of the Meech Lake Accord debate.

All songs were written and performed by The Tragically Hip.
