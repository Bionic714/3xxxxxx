""Die Page-Datei ist deaktivert oder die DateigröSSe reicht nicht aus.

Im zu funktioneren braucht das Spoel eine Page-Datei von mindestens 2GB.

Bitte die Systemkofiguration anpassen, bevor das Speiel erneut gestartet wird.""

Anyone who can translate and/or help?"

The PAGE file is deactivated or the file size is not sufficient. In order to function the game needs a PAGE file of at least 2GB. Please adapt the system configuration, before you restart the game.
