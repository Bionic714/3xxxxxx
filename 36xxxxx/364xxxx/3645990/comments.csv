,toofan,2007-03-24T09:54Z,why isnt this in offical firefox extention/addon site?
,freeforall079,2007-03-24T22:46Z,"I am not sure why it's not on the official site.
I didn't make it, just made it work with the newest versions of Firefox. It might have to do with it being for XBMC.
By the looks of things I should of done it along time ago. 
Downloaded 66 Times that was quick. "

,freeforall079,2007-05-07T09:39Z,"No you don't but it can be mounted.
This program needs the cd in the cdrom drive or the .iso mounted as a drive for it to work."
