Overview:	"This is Kung Fu" is one of the best documentaries about Wushu (Chinese martial arts). It features dozens of demonstrations of modern and traditional Wushu. Many empty hand styles (Chang Quan, Nan Quan, Tanglang Quan, Ditang Quan, Yingzhao Quan, etc.) and lots of weapons. Some of the performers are Li Lianjie (Jet Li), Hao Zhihua, Zhao Changjun, Yu Shaowen, Li Xia and many others. There are also some old masters, one of them is performing Yia Quan (Duck Boxing)! The documentary also features some very nice locations in China and an excellent soundtrack with traditional Chinese music. HKFlix.com Recommended!
