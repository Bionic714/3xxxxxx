Synopsis:
This film memorializes the leader of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, on the occasion of his death. It narrates the story of a life which is also the story of a nation--recounting his important accomplishments in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism. The simplicity of his ascetic life of study, work, and struggle is contrasted to the pomp of his official funeral, where the film documents the immense outpouring of grief by the Vietnamese people on the death of their leader. The film's most impacting sequence is its outcry against the Vietnam War, where scenes of anti-war protests in the U.S. and battle scenes give way to disturbing images of mutilated Vietnamese children. This famous section comments on violence by not merely portraying it, but by brutalizing the strips of film themselves, bringing the full force of the horrors of war to the screen in a technique which, in characteristically Santiago Alvarez style, is both highly formalist and emotionally persuasive.[mediarights]
