Release Notes:

Mainliners are back. After their praised record
release, Bring On The Sweetlife, on Get Hip
Recordings (US) with following US- and European
tours theyΓÇÖre now back and ready to strike with a
second smashing album. Mainliners combine the raw
rock of MC5 with the cocky attitude of Hives,
adding a touch Swedish pop. Their front man Robert
Billing has a well respected reputation for his
powerful and charismatic voice. Robert is backed by
furious guitars, steady beats, popish quires and
partly even by harmonium bows.

The MainlinerΓÇÖs self-titled album contains ten
varying but inter-twining songs. Ranging from Is
This Satisfying with feedback, distorted guitar
riffs and catchy pop melodies, to Round Five with
driving bass and distinctive guitar chords to
SaintΓÇÖs March In The Sunrise with itΓÇÖs warmth and
soulfulness. Plus thereΓÇÖs much, much moreΓÇª The
Mainliners wonΓÇÖt let you down!

It all started a few years ago in some dirty little
industrial town somewhere in the middle of Sweden.
Four guys with attitude got fed up with the lack of
something to do. These youngsters' frustration led
to the creation of a new musical group, a group
that soon was to be named The Mainliners. With the
members' similar sources of inspiration it just
couldn't be anything else but some kind of garage
rock & roll music screaming out of those amps after
a few rehearsals.

Today Mainliners are a sextet. TheyΓÇÖve toured the
States and Europe. TheyΓÇÖve released records on
Crusher Records, Get Hip Recordings and Human
Bretzel. Their music has grown, grown from the more
primitive garage music to a more modern and refined
pop and rock music. TheyΓÇÖve still got the attitude,
theyΓÇÖve got the confidence and theyΓÇÖre back with a
new smashing album. Mainliners are back, and
theyΓÇÖre here to stay!
