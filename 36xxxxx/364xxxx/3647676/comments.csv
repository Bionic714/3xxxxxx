The worse thing is, Neptune made the DVD Rip from the TL Special DVDR, and the DVDR was only 3.9 Gb, you have re-encoded it to a DVDR and made it 4.27 Gb. Do you know what that means, wastes, you cant make quality better, its just a bloated DVD Rip, what a waste......"
,reelfiles,2007-03-26T10:51Z,"I read the comments on the other torrents you linked to before making this DVD, and I was under the impression that people weren't satisfied with the quality.  The swine release didn't have any relevant comments.  So since I don't have all the insider info of who rips who's releases, I downloaded the Avi and made my own DVD ISO.   "
,madjock56,2007-03-26T11:09Z,"Well thats fine mate, but the Neptunes DVD Rip came from the TL Special.

So how you can make that better by re-encoding it to a larger file than it started out in the first place is anyones guess.

Thats how it happened. And Swine is not much better than the TL Special, its all the same source.

Its your bandwidth, so its up to you, I just think its a waste. Just my opinion of course.

The TL Special is not here, becuase its an Internal, but basically put it just before the Neptune rip, I ignored the Mvs one as that was nuked."
,reelfiles,2007-03-26T12:13Z,"I wasn't trying to make the quality better, it's obvious that a copy can never be better than the source.  I simply set the desired file size to DVD-5 in Nerovision and let it run 2 passes.  

This is actually my first uploaded torrent and I figure we all have to start somewhere.  This just gives others an alternative that don't want to make their own DVD. 

 I wish my ISP had better upload speed, but once someone else helps seed this, it should be a pretty good download.

If you know of any sites that have the different releases' info, I'd appreciate it, to avoid this in the future.
Thanks

,madjock56,2007-03-26T12:18Z,"The best advice I could give you, is join Torrentleech or some other top site, if only for the latest info on the new releases.

They are an invite only I think, but I think they are doing passes on Irc, I dont have any invites ..sorry.

Yeah Im sure it will speed up, but as you can see from the comments, as in me, dont expect it to be well seeded, a lot of people get the links from search engines, then they will finish and stop seeding, thats life on a public tracker I suppose."
,reelfiles,2007-03-26T23:32Z,"Thanks for the advice. 
I am still fairly new to the whole scene, and I just wanna give back to the community.
I'll be moving soon, so hopefully my new ISP will have better upload speeds.

Thanks again."
,reelfiles,2007-03-31T01:04Z,"Thanks for helping seed, guys.

I'll have some other CSTM DVD-R goodies coming really soon.
