World Container is the eleventh full-length album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. It was released in Canada on October 17, 2006,in two formats: as a limited edition Digipak and regular jewel case. The United States release is set for March 6, 2007, in advance of a planned tour. This album was recorded at various locations including Maui, Vancouver and Toronto. In concert Gord Downie joked that the title of the album is actually a typo, and should read "World Contain Her."

The first single, "In View," and the video for the song, were released on the band's website, thehip.com, in advance of the album release.

The track "The Lonely End of the Rink" was premiered on Hockey Night In Canada on October 7, to acclaim by fans of the band.

The album's fourth track, "Fly" has been in the works since before the band recorded their Nov. 26, 2004 show at the Air Canada Centre, which became the concert DVD, "That Night in Toronto." As can be witnessed on the DVD, Gord Downie recites the opening lyric of "Fly", as well as a portion of the chorus, as a part of his rant during the extended up-tempo break of "At the Hundredth Meridian."

The length of the CD is erroneously noted as "42:45" (min:sec) on the front and back cover. It is actually 42:27 (min:sec), or 42.45 minutes in length.

World Container was streaming from thehip.com, the band's official website, and various other Southern Ontario radio stations on October 10, 2006, one week ahead of the album release.
