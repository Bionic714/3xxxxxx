Overview:	Li Han-Hsiang was best known for his erotic romances, so when he directed this powerful martial arts drama, it came as a welcome surprise. Both Wang Ping and Ku Feng won Golden Horse acting awards, while the film was also honored for a Best Costume Design. But it is star Ti Lung, rarely more soulful, which holds together the tale of a considerate kung fu master who sadly learns thjat the human tiger (and tigress) are the more dangerous.
