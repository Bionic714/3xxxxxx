The Canadian jazz singer and pianist gives about a two-hour concert in Paris and all two hours are very worthwhile to watch and hear. This is good stuff - and I'm not really a jazz fan. Krall is accompanied by five other jazz musicians and a European symphony orchestra, conducted by Alan Broadbent.

This is simply good music by real pros in the jazz business and led, of course, by Krall, who has a wonderful voice and is a terrific pianist. It doesn't hurt that she looks great, too! (Actually, the whole concert is filmed beautifully.) To Krall's credit, she lets her band get a lot of solo time and she's generous with the compliments. I found guitarist Anthony Wilson a particular standout. 

However, you can see Krall is partial to longtime musicians John Clayton (bass) and Jeff Hamilton (drums.) She speaks of them like old buddies, which they probably are.
The first selection is the most upbeat of the concert and gets things rolling. All of it is first-class and gets better and better with each viewing.
