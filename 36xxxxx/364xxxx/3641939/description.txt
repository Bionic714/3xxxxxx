The deposed editor-in-chief of an old, distinguished publishing firm, recently taken over by a multi-millionaire, corporate raider, is bitten by a wolf on a lonely stretch of road in Vermont the night of a full moon. As he slowly watches himself metamorphose into something lupine, he discovers that he has been betrayed by his most promising protege, his wife of 16 years has been unfaithful, and that he has fallen in love with the raider's beautiful, headstrong daughter. What follows is a series of grisly events that reaches a bloody and horrifying climax.

When a mild-mannered, middle-aged book editor gets bitten by a wolf, it gives him a shot of confidence over younger colleagues, highly tuned senses and a few new lycanthropic appetites. Like a clever "New Yorker" cartoon, this urbane horror film satirizes middle age in New York's cutthroat social and business worlds.
