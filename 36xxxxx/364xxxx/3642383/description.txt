Yana Stanislavovna Dyagileva (1966 - 1991) was a Russian singer/songwriter from Novosibirsk, Siberia, who achieved quite considerable underground acknowledgement during the later years of the Soviet Union, partly by way of Magnitizdat, meaning to \"publish on magnetic tape\".

Magnitizdat was a way in which artists, individuals and bands could spread their music as widely as possible, to audiences throughout the Soviet Union and beyond. By circumventing official censorship, and with an absense of established recording facilities and promotion outside of government sanctioned culture, artists would make homemade tape recordings of their performances, make copies and send them on to others.

Interestingly Soviet critics inside the USSR would also use Magnitizdat to spread their views, as Samizdat, meaning to \"self-publish\" was associated with literature produced on paper, and under tighter attempts of control by the KGB. 

Yanka gained notoriety for her music, giving dark and open depictions of the lives of Soviet youth in the 1980\'s.  With being known to have problems with alcohol abuse and depression, she went missing from her family home on the 9th of May 1991, and found dead on the 17th in the river Inya, caused by drowning. The circumstances surrounding her death were not officially confirmed as the definite intention of suicide. Here, uploaded is Yanka\'s 1989 album Domoi! (To Home!).  It is performed in the Russian language.
