,amilapeenga,2009-01-01T07:18Z,Thanks so much for this!
,Eleshar,2010-03-03T00:04Z,"@branimir01 - The New Tomorrow is actually the sequel to The Tribe, and The Tribe was canceled because actors were too old, so they just made new series as continuation to The Tribe, with younger actors."
,Eleshar,2010-03-03T00:05Z,"@Dgrobyc - you should have made every episode in separate file, it would be much better that way"
