,pantsninja,2007-10-31T05:09Z,Is this the tv rip ? or DVD rip ?
,Torrent245,2008-02-21T23:51Z,"This was one of those shows my brother loved when he first got the PVR. I've never really seen a full episode, so I'm interested in seeing this show. Good luck me."

Kanske kolla lite på ...umm, >>>UNDERTEXTER.SE"

,dlarrym,2009-12-19T21:11Z,"Its a great series. I think HBO or CineMAX produced it. It was one of the first shows/movies where Nick Stahl was featured. It may have been his first break. It is a really good story. I thought they should have made a 3rd season to take care of some loose ends better then the end of 2nd season and the series was able to do. I think it was supposed to be another season but it was halted at the end  of the 2nd. ANYWAY.... Nick Stahl is the actor that played JHON CONNER in the 3rd TERMINATOR instalment with the female terminiator. He also was the yellow skined bad guy in SIN CITY.... ANYWAY....Is this the entire 1st season stuffed onto a single DVD? or is it just part of the 1st season. It takes some quality away to put 4 episodes per DVD, this guy has put 24 episodes onto 1 DVD.... go figure.... the quality is most likely hurting badly... any one finished downloading?"
,-rens-,2010-06-08T14:46Z,"Too bad they only made 2 seasons of Carnivale. Could have done a whole lot more. Nonetheless it doesn't feel rushed. 
Great show, great ending, great quality.

,DoctorMadcow,2011-06-24T05:51Z,Is there any reason why there is no sound? I tried playing this on VLC and Windows Media and still no sound. Anyone else have this problem?
,DoctorMadcow,2011-06-24T06:03Z,"Nevermind I got it to work, im an idiot. Great Torrent!"
,Lucius_0,2011-07-05T02:23Z,"2mb down speed! Fuckin right!!
Only 30 mins to download... Thanks man. :)"
,candorist,2011-12-24T19:24Z,"HBO committed the most atrocious crime in TV history. They cut funding for the show. Season 2 ends with a cliffhanger as big as Santa's belly. After that all you can think of is pepper-bombing  their head quarters.

Anyway thanks for uploading. You rock."
,superpipe,2012-05-26T02:34Z,"Thanks a lot for this.  Excellent torrent, excellent series.  Cheers "
,dumbson,2012-07-16T02:45Z,"i def appreciate you uploading these and it's a very watchable show, but it's kinda pixelated.  to an annoying degree.  but it's better than nothing.  the upload of season 2 by sickonineteen is pretty awesome, great quality.  so not sure why this one is so lacking.  "
