Synopsis

The story is set in the Not To Distant Future, and tells of a group of police patrolling the highways, defending them agaqinst the Gangs which have taken over. The Main cop is Max Rockatansky, as played by a young Mel Gibson in his first starring role. The film starts with a spectacular car chase in which Max ends up killing the pursued bad guy, The Nightrider. So anyway The Nightriders gang swears vengeance on Max, Max gets worried and decides to leave the force and go on a holiday with his wife and son. While on holidays the gang finds him and kills his family. This makes Max MAD (hence the title)! Now Max is the one on the hunt... (I dont want to spoil the ending). I think that is an adequate description of what basically happens in the film.
