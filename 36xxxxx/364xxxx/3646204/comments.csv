,Srix0n,2007-03-24T19:21Z,Im seeding as much as i can.. sorry for the slow speed
,Shinji-no-tenshi,2007-03-25T14:37Z,"Ehm, Is there no way to get higher speed? :/ Its Dl'ing in SLO'-MO' :) Thanx"
,Srix0n,2007-03-25T18:03Z,I'm seeding nonstop trying to get this out.. because... its flippin sweet :-P
,Srix0n,2007-03-31T06:56Z,"Be sure to check out my DvD Version for more features! (recommended if you can burn to a dvd)
But if you can only use CD's then this is for you"
,Ahreeman,2007-04-01T22:31Z,"Tnx for the upload man. I need a good 1 for gaming so i hope this 1 does it for me. All the x64bit versions out there seem to have a corrupted IE on them or it happens while installing, and i get the message to work offline or try again without clicking IE icon, this happens some times after reboot, anyway my games get minimized suddenly when i use x64bit and the funny thing is i can use IE but cant find it in Add or remove so i put the damn thing in the trash bin from program files and my game doesnt get minimized but i laaaaaaaaaaaaaaag while playing online, this is making me go coocoo. So back to x32 for me. Any suggestion on my problem with the x64 bit is very very welcome.

Tnx again for the UPs SrixOn. I am D-loading both."
,imnok1,2007-04-07T19:31Z,i'd like to download one of your two versions but both not a single seed
,Ahreeman,2007-04-07T20:51Z,Oops my bad it was my anti virus.
,Roo2000,2007-04-08T13:21Z,"Any chance somebody else can seed?
I'll seed when I get it.
Thanks"
,Ahreeman,2007-05-01T18:24Z,"I am seeding both right now make use of it i have t1 or is it t3?!!  but going to kick azu when i play on line cuz it lags up my game, 2 much bandwidth it needs this B-torrnt protocol. lol."
,billted323,2007-05-04T04:27Z,"Honestly.... a version of windows that has been tailored down for gaming is the coolest thing I have ever heard!  It seems if I get the wrong programs going my gaming slows waaaay down.  After I wipe my hd it runs better.  If my computer ran games as well smash brothers does on a gamecube...I wouldn't leave home.  I'm so desperate fer speed but I don't have money and I already spent a bunch of money on getting a pci express motherboard... and a pentium d process prescott 940 3.2 supposed to be two of em runnin at 3.2 and I'm supposed to be able to overclock it but I don't know how to well.  A new egg review said that that processor could overclock diffrent ways but my mother board is...  nforce 570 slit-A and I can't find that review for the processor and I don't know how.  

My video card may be pci express but it is the 90 some dollar version named... diamond x550-pcie oc 256mb.  

Srixon could u plz hlp me.  
Could u look up a review board for my processor which would help tell u how to overclock it...then explain to me how I overclock it with my motherboard.  If you can plz do b/c its my dream to sit on my ass and play black and white 2 perfectly.  I don't think I'd go outside fer a few days.  And look at all that money I spent.  And can u tell me why a lille 99$ game cube can run a game that looks great like smash borthers... I read something about consoles are better optimized that's why... so in theory if u cutt out stuff from xp it will run that well too.  

I mean gamecube has little hardware but puts out smash that's what I meant to say... does my pc not have power?  Is there a bottle neck... admitly things are looking up.... I found this program that I think I should share a shout out fer real!  This thing is great ... its called uh...gamespeeder.  I'm not sure where I dwnled but... here is a link fer it http://www.freetrialsoft.com/GameSpeeder-review-22711.html 

Also could u try that prog for me srixon and give me your input on that program?  It is weird and it does actully seem to have a effect on my gamin and other windows apps.  I tried one similar it didn't seem to do the same.  This one getz a thumbs up fer me but I don't understand the program... Could u explain it to me also... and.. what else   

I have 1536 mb of ram runnin in 533 mode not duel or anything just a gig stick and a 512 something stick.  

Where is my bottle neck? Plz say it ain't the processor.  

I wish I could plug a 300 hundred dollar pci express video card in and then seem how black and white 2 would run.  With my current stuff.  

Another thing is windows should make their own gaming version of windows that doesn't do jack diddly but game well... Maybe here it is.  Pc gamez rule but consoles keep on runnin well... althought did anybody notice Max payne choke on the x box... that is proff of console choke.

This is just my cry for help anwsers and imput from people even critics.  

Also could u go into more detail about the cut down version of this windows plz tell me more about what u did."
,billted323,2007-05-04T04:41Z,Oh yeah I haven't been able to use the opted version yet.  need to dl.. if I try this and it does something I want to combine it with that speed program and a overclock with the those 3 things going... awww crap will I be able to notice choke on a normal setting... I wonder I'm picky as heck my hd is already wiped with no xp updated few other progs.  runs well right not admittingly but is there better?  
,billted323,2007-05-04T05:18Z,"One last thing... IF there is anyone out there who has connections needs to take this idea and use.  

Make a freakin console that runs widows.  Yes windows.  The ultmate consoles= a computer without choke u by a game u know 99% its going to work.. and 

Examples if your playing half-life for this dream system u can mod it
If your playing GTA u can download skins people made fer cars or whatever..

CRAP it has to have everything windows can do related to games and media but just it has to play games like a console + it has to come standard with keyboard every game that comes out has to be keyboard supported.  I'd like to play world of warcraft on my tv without doing that monitor trick.  

The new systems have moved foward but have fallen short of all that windows can do.

Pc gamez rule because they let people do crazy stuff with em... for example again.. u could probably take a pc game only made for one player mode hack it and somehow and have a friend connect to u by ip for some type of co-op.

I thought there was a pc game that actully had that but I don't know I can't think of any.

Did u know that gamecube users actully fought each other for smash borther's mele.  Check out youtube fer proof. That's freakin amazing but hey when they did it it choked so i ruinded the fun.  Other wise people would stop having lives and play that game all day long.  

Playing a game alone fer me is sad.  Make all games co-op.  

Lastly Gamecube made my favorite controler ever.  The wii wand thingy isn't good enough fer me.  

The new smash fo wii will be online but... let us use the old remote are u crazy... that thing was beautiful to this day.  

If u are a smash brother's developer and u read this stop making your game right now if u can't use the old remote.  Just stop.  Smash is fast paced wii remote seems to delay a bit don't ya think... PEOple love the system.  I haven't tried the ps3 or x360 yet how good is that?  What if those systems don't make there game makers have gamez that support keyboards... good fer FPS RTS Massive online and others... IT WOULD BE A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.  I hear things like well they have keyboards u can use but do they freakin make there game makers use em?

Ok I'm done plz change the world someone... if ya read this and ya know how to invent.  How many more years must I wait for the ultimate system.  Actully if I could afford some more expensive pc hardware I'd be done. "

,jonahx,2007-06-05T13:45Z,thats so u can download ur own favorite drivers. Like the very excellent TweaksRus drivers for nvidia. Why bloat the cd with every driver out there when it takes 2 minutes to download and install the best ones for ur card..
,Sketchpcis,2007-06-09T18:40Z,"I really hope this is as good as people have told me it is...I've been wanting to get a New OS in my system for a while now, well, format it really and start fresh."
,Sketchpcis,2007-06-09T18:41Z,"and yeah, Ahreeman, I'm gonna seed this as well, once it completes"
,Ahreeman,2007-06-20T16:07Z,"Man i lost all the data on the iso, i see the iso file but when i try to mount it alcohol says file contains no data!!!   crap crap crap  hope i can get the file again. lol 1 seeder."
,Ahreeman,2007-06-20T16:12Z,Oh yeah let us not let this torrent DIE.
,AndyJ4444,2008-01-24T20:36Z,Is this torrent optimzed for gamers? More optimzed than:http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3524541/XP_Gamer_V_2.01_iso_(15_process_Aero) ??
