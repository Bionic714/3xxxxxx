I was searchin for somethin lyk this for a while, and now that i finally found it i plan to seed this shit out of it... i didnt believe it either at first, but its 37 CD's of your and my favorire, slugo. Slug of Atmosphere is by far the sickest lyracist out there, in my opinion. I love his music, his beats, his voice, his attitude, and especially his crew. Some great tracks by Rhymeslayers Entertainment on her as well.  great torrent and like i said i plan to see this shit out of this... SpreaD ThE SluG
