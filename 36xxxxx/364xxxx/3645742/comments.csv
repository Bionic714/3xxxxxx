annoying."
,deathbycoleslaw,2011-01-07T10:57Z,"I can't believe no one has mentioned this yet, but the first song I played from this download, Fuck You Lucy on God Loves Ugly (not exactly an unknown song) was one of those files that has the annoying voice over saying ""advance copy"" occasionally. It's missing content on top of this. Don't download."
,RatSalad311,2011-02-14T21:22Z,"Fuck all the people bitching about this torrent. If you want the newer albums BUY THEM and quit your bitching. Great collection, thank you."

,s_scott0420,2011-10-01T02:23Z,god loves ugly has this stupid voice over on about every song. It's from before the record was released so noone would steal it but it's been out for years now. besides that everything is perfect thanks.
,hell2pay,2012-04-14T07:57Z,"yeah, cant complain bout some girl tramping about advanced copies, when you freely take a copy. just fucking enjoy or buy, id suggest buy, Atmo is tha shit, im downloading this to fulfil my lust for the music. its dirty"
