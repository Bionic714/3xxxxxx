,nurlewis,2007-04-03T04:30Z,"What is the serial number for InDesign? I've searched many sites and cannot get a working serial. If anyone can help, please do so."
,Ullis.org,2007-04-03T12:08Z,"Look in the abcopy.ini-file.. the key, user and companyname is there..

It was a long time ago sence I installed Indesign my self, so I don't really remember. If it works, tell me, if it doesn't, I will make a torrent just for Indesign with a crack that DOES work..
I promise!!
