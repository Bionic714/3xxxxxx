,T-1OOO,2007-08-21T20:57Z,"If you mean this torrent is BS then you are way wrong man. This is the really old mortal kombat 2 for DOS! I have the original copy which I bought many many years ago!
Try VirtualPC or DOS Box to run this ISO under XP!"
,Pazma,2007-09-01T00:53Z,"Hi T-1000, thanks for the upload.

I've downloaded the game and DOSBox and I've tried to run the game but I get an error that says 'cannot detect cd drive'

Can you help please?"
,T-1OOO,2007-11-02T00:22Z,did you burn the game on a CD or did you just mount the ISO?
