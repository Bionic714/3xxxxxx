,todd3835,2007-03-23T23:51Z,I am infact seeding this. It's showing 0 seeds but I'm seeding it. Bare with me as this is my first attempt at a seed.....
,todd3835,2007-04-06T15:07Z,PM Me if you need this re-seeded. When I'm done with all states I'll make 1 big torrent. Until then I'm trying not to keep to many seeded at once unless there's no other seeds.

I would love to see a complete torrent of the 07 maps.

Also, if you change the extension from .pdb to .mlp the maps work on a Pocket PC as well. I haven't found any problems. The Mapopolis program is different for the PPC though. It is just a little tough changing the extension for all of those counties."
