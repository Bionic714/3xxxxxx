Release Notes:

A Swedish electronic-punk 5-piece creating hooks and
choruses that etch themselves in the back of your
mind and provide the ultimate soundtrack to your
hedonistic weekends, The Sounds are a female fronted
genre-defying band with guitar driven bassline and
synth keyboard. You may already be familiar with the
lead vocalist Maja, who formed part of the
supergroup Cobra Starship with Gym Class Heroes and
The All American Rejects. 'Dying To Say This To You'
is their latest release and includes the singles
'Tony The Beat' and 'Painted By Numbers'.
