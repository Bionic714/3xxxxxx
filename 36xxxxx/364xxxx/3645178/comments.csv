I mean, I know some people don't like jazz, but I would say that My collection of jazz guitar solos beats your collection of only classic rock guitar solos any time. Just try listening to some Jazz guitar, it will blow your mind away."

_________________________________
First , this is bias towards rock Second there is no Jazz... Hmmm. First let me say that this is redundant and second let me say that you've made the same point twice.

It seems to have that effect on people who listen to it."
,pairustwo,2007-04-25T06:27Z,"Third let me say that this is bias toward radio hits of  classic rock. While I'm glad to see Freaks like Robbert Fripp and Vernon Reid in there it is somewhat ridiculous to give Frank Zappa one track -putting him on par with such heavy hitters as Deep Purple and ZZ top - while Kurt Cobain Steely Dan -Both of whom I love - out rank him???
And the Rolling Stones...The solo in Jivin Sister Fanny is way better than anything on this list. Left off, obviously because it was never on the charts. 
LAME!"
,chookymeister,2008-05-24T06:54Z,"good torrent, too bad doesnt hav any tags zzzz guess iv gotta do it myself now"
,chookymeister,2008-05-24T09:06Z,"after going through http://guitar.about.com/library/bl100greatest.htm to give tags to all the songs in itunes, i noticed a few with mixed up track numbers, but more importantly songs that weren't actually on the list but a different song

According to the guitar.about website this torrent is missing these songs(has something else instead):

063 - Soundgarden - Kim Thayil - Black Hole Sun
065 - Nirvana - Kurt Cobain - In Bloom
084 - Sublime - Brad Nowell - Santeria
097 - Smashing Pumpkins - Billy Corgan - Cherub Rock
100 - Jane's Addiction - Dave Navarro - Three Days"

Oh, and something I discovered is that it's kind of impossible to judge art the way you would just a car or an athlete. Music is in the heart of the listener, not something you can quantify and dissect. Any top 100 list is just a list of opinions. And while I think that it's dope for the most part that doesn't mean it's written in stone or the word of God. 
So don't take it personally."
