Plot:	Despite the title, this film is really about only three fighters, who aren't particularly "super". They split up to master different martial arts so that they can reunite in 6 months time to defeat a common enemy known as the "kung fu corrector".

Overview:	An arrogant kung fu specialist roams China challenging one and all--"correcting" their kung fu, as he puts it. He "corrects" an old kung fu master and his three students to the point where the master turns to drink and stops teaching. The three students each go their separate ways in search of different skills needed to defeat their foe. When they reunite in 6 months time, get ready for an epic 20-minute battle the likes of which you've never seen. Another classic from the Shaw Brothers studios.
