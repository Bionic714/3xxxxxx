Pls speed it up:P"
,geileraffe,2007-03-22T15:33Z,Doh!!!  stalled at 61.3
,grimerking,2007-03-25T19:48Z,Sorry. I went on holiday and left it uploading. There was a power cut. I'm now seeding again. 
,shvituris,2007-04-23T14:04Z,"Please help me!
Here are many files... Where can I find Sandra Bullock scene? 
thx a lot!"
,VTNC,2008-04-02T16:16Z,"The video is nearly 2000 Kbps (nearly twice as much as is usually used) why didn't you preserve the original resolution of 640x480?

Hell, at this size, you should've preserved AC3 audio"
,VTNC,2008-04-03T17:28Z,"I will reluctantly seed this

grimer, if you're the ripper, here's some suggestions for next time:
- 640 x 480, ~1000 Kbps
- IVTC
- VBR audio (use BeSweet, use MP3 for AVI profile)"
,shurchik,2009-06-12T00:16Z,Thanks a million!  This is a great show!
,some-young-guy,2010-08-26T06:36Z,"Thnx for U/Ling this show.  I can't believe it only ran for a single season.  I will seed it till my PC crashes again, then I'll wipe my drive and reboot just to DL it again to seed.  Peace mates."
,baconninja,2012-01-04T17:30Z,One of the great 1 season shows. Way better than Entourage. Thanks.
