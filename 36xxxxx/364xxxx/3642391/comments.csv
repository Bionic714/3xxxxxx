,maew4,2007-03-24T06:40Z,"See the above Torrent for information how to identify which BMW Navigator you have, which version it is on, and how far you can upgrade it, and which new freatures you will get.

See my other torrents for different KeyCD images for different software. 

Record the KeyCD at low speed 2XA as the Navigator might not read other formats for the KeyCD."
