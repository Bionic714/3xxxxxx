An amazing sound track to an amazing movie.
I still can't put my finger on what draws me to this movie, maybe it's the fact that it was set on new years eve 1999.
The music itself was I would say a perfect conglomeration to celebrate the end of the 90s. But it still manages to be a movie soundtrack.
The song that gets me every time is "while the earth sleeps" by Peter Gabriel and Deep forest.
If you saw the movie before the year 2000 you would have got the feeling you were watching future history.
I suppose it shows what was good and Bad about the world at that time.
Bye bye Y2k!
