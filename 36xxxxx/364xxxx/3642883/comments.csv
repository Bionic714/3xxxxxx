I actually downloaded the torrent file from isohunt, but the information says that the original torrent was from pirate bay. I compared the files, and this is indeed the one I downloaded.

This movie works beautifully in both my computer and my stand alone dvd player. Again, thank you so much!!

Tip for others who may have slow speeds on this torrent: Isohunt listed several trackers for this torrent, so if your client allows you to add additional trackers to your downloads, add these trackers to your Good Shepherd download. You will connect to more seeds & peers...

(pirate bay gives me an error when I type URLs, so I'm replacing h t t p with hxxp, and I'm replacing the period with the word ""DOT"". Please make the changes before adding these to your client):

hxxp://infernoDOTdemonoidDOTcom:3400/announce: 

hxxp://trackerDOTdvdquorumDOTes:2710/announce:

hxxp://tpbDOTtrackerDOTthepiratebayDOTorg:80/announce.php: "

Thanks."
