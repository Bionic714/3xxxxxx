No popups, no hassle

There are no annoying and unecessary warnings, popups or reminders, just strong security.
No robots = No nasty surprises 

Many other packages use programmes called robots, which run constantly in the background whenever your computer is on. 

They collect usernames, passwords and form details without your knowledge, potentially leaving you open to attack from internet hackers, and allowing other users of your computer free access to all your accounts.

InfoLock believes your data is too important to allow this risk. We don't use robots, so no programmes will run unawares, and no sign-ins will be performed without your permission. With an InfoLock product, the only person in charge of your data is you.
