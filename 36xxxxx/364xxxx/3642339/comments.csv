,Verwandlung-,2007-05-08T20:34Z,thank you !
,karmaseed,2007-06-27T17:41Z,"Thanks for this.

Also, this is the new English dub version, not the old one with Leonardo's voice as Kaneda.  I thought some people would want to know that in case they were looking for the older version.

,sephiroth_1964,2007-06-28T04:54Z,Thanks a lot Mike.
,Ola435345345,2007-07-06T11:09Z,"The quality Is superb.. but when It comes to the dubbing I must say that this hand drawn masterpiece needs to be seen with the ORIGINAL JAPANEESE ACTORS actually ACTING to the pictures. No wonder this film took seven years to make. Well I just cant cope with american voices on this..

,Ola435345345,2007-07-06T11:11Z,I prefer subtitles and the ORIGINAL version. 
,Ola435345345,2007-07-06T11:11Z,I prefer subtitles on the ORIGINAL sound.
,Ola435345345,2007-07-06T11:13Z,Did they also add extra drum beats on this version?  So corny..
,eyekillyou,2007-09-20T06:41Z,thanks for the tip on the english track. im currently looking for the old dub. i almost downloaded this one too.

,Raioh,2008-02-17T07:30Z,"Awwww, it's not the Streamline version."

,tibstah,2009-10-23T16:13Z,"To everyone complaining about the English dub:

Stop being a self-important twat. Only 0.02% of the world?s population speak Japanese, whereas over 25% of humanity understands English to some degree, and I?m sure they?d prefer English over Japanese audio. Nobody's going to learn Japanese just to watch a movie in the original language, so please kindly go fuck yourself."
,dhruv990s,2011-01-15T11:21Z,"@tibstah 
ever heard of japanese subtitles?
BTW I speak english and am not japanese though I too prefer original acting if dubbing is shit."
