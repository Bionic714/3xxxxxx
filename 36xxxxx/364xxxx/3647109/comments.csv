Would it be possible for you to seed ST Voyager when TNG is done?"

,eldard,2007-03-29T17:37Z,Forget this. Go here for 90% quality: http://thepiratebay.org/search/star%20trek%20the%20next%20generation/0/0/0
,kenny999,2007-03-29T20:46Z,That nagger is bitching likely everywhere...
,eldard,2007-04-05T06:03Z,That's because you have inferior taste to go for 60% quality. Do yourself a favor and jump off a roof or something. Don't pollute the world with your mediocrity.
,kenny999,2007-04-05T21:29Z,"Haha... that nagger's superior mind needed whole week to think out that funny comment :-)
Guess who's bitching about a gift? An ungrateful arsehole."
