Producer/artist Timbaland has lined up an array of
superstar guests for his new album, "Shock Value." Due
April 3rd via Mosley Music Group/Blackground/Interscope,
the project will be introduced later this week by first
single "Give It to Me," featuring Justin Timberlake and
Nelly Furtado.

The album is said to be "sequenced like a movie" and
encompasses a wide range of genres. "He ventures into the
alternative world and the real pop world," Timbaland
right-hand-man Nate "Danja" Hills previously told
Billboard.com. "He has so many different sounds from
hip-hop, to pop, to rock on this album. And he pulls every
single one of them off perfectly.

Beyond Furtado and Timberlake, guests on "Shock Value"
include Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, the Hives, Elton John, Fall Out
Boy, M.I.A, She Wants Revenge and Kerri Hilson, who is
signed to Mosley Music Group.

Timbaland has not released an album under his own name
since 2003's "Under Construction II," a collaboration with
longtime partner Magoo. He is presently on tour with
Timberlake and debuting snippets from "Shock Value" during
his mini-set each night.
