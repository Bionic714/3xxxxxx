He thinks he got power... but he doesn't run shit.

When they're done, they'll tramp on him like just like they do on anyone else.. but his weak mind won't allow him to understand that."

,benjor9000,2007-05-07T10:54Z,"I heard it asked ""What would the Government of the US gain by allowing or masterminding the attacks of 9/11?"" hmmm how about the patriot act, which originally allowed previously unconstitutional phone taps and other blanketing removal of right, in the intrest of National Security? We should also consider the fact that waging war on terrorism and the al-qaeda is a big expense of monies, justifying more taxes and further reducing the soverign rights of people, both within the USA and without."
