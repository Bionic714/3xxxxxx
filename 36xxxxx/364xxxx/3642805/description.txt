On the way, they meet up with Ying, a clan chieftain's daughter with whom Ling has had a relationship. Ying's father has been betrayed and imprisoned by a former ally, named Invincible Asia, whose ambitions to overthrow the Ming emperor have been aided by the recent acquisition of heightened martial powers.
