,bÃ¶nnish,2007-04-03T18:10Z,whwere is the eboot?
,macarong,2007-04-08T19:29Z,"Thanks Trod80,

My PSP Firmware is 2.01.
I already downgraded to 1.5 and format my memory card.
Now I download your package and see 3 folders inside.
Which one should I use?
(2) To Upgrade To Version 3.10OE-A (after you have downgrade to 1.50) ?

After I format the memory,
Does the PSP still keep the official firmware 1.5 and have a capacity of 3.10 firmware?
Does it work similar to Devhook?

I am worry about my PSP would be no longer play homebrew games after upgrading to 3.10.

Hope you help and I really appreciate your hardwork.
