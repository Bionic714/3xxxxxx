Synopsis
King Arthur and the Round Table knights legend is represented in Excalibur, the captivating film version from director John Boorman (Deliverance) Every single element and background of the classic novel by Sir Thomas Malory, Le Morte Darthur, are all on the screen: young knight Arthur (Nigel Terry), crowned king after having taken out the bewitched Excalibur sword, the noble birth of the Round Table Fraternity whose ideals Lancelot personifies and then its tragic end; the heroic pursuit of the Holy Grail, and the power balance between Merlin?s magic (Nicol Williamson) and Morgana?s evil (Helen Mirren). Co-starring Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne and Liam Neeson in one of his first roles, Excalibur shows the whole splendour of that time, from the impressive battle scenes up to the romantic ones.
