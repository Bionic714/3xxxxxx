Release Notes:

Petra Marklund was born determined. By the time she was twelve,
she was already in studios recording. At seventeen, she was
singing in a rock band and when she graduated from Swedish high
school, at a time when most teenagers worry about what to wear to
their interviews for a job at McDonalds, Petra had already nailed
a record deal. A big one.
Calling herself September, the then 18-year old had hits like "La
la la (Never give it up)", "We can do it" and "September all
over". The songs were written and produced by dynamic hit making
trio Jonas von der Burg, Niclas von der Burg and Anoo Bhagavan,
and with Petra, they made a great team where Petra found exactly
the kind of high-quality dance music she was looking for to make.
While danceable and catchy, the songs always have its base in
Petra's dark, surprisingly sad voice that lingers in your ears,
making them stick out from the hit parades on the radio.

Two years and a well-needed vacation later, September is back to
do what she does best: singing. This time, she has turned over a
new leaf with a new record label behind her. Without bashing her
old label, Petra says there was some indifferences concerning her
image - there were things she didn't want to do, like putting too
much focus on her appearance, or performing playback. To her, each
performance is important, and she has high expectations on
herself. It's all about singing - and dancing. (The
multi-talented 21-yearold has been taking dance lessons for ages,
and in the video for the single "Satellites", Petra had to dance
non stop for 28 hours!)
- I'm really happy with my new record label. From now on, it's all
music! She exhales so much energy it's enough to make anyone else
feel old and tired. Although she grew up mostly singing jazz,
there was never any doubt concerning what kind of music Petra
would make a living doing.
- I'm crazy about house music, says Petra who love Kylie Minogue
and Annie, and holds Britney Spears "Toxic" as an all-time
favourite video.
Her first single of the album, "Satellites", was an instant hit in
Sweden - the rare kind both the audience and the critics love.
It's been the most played song on both commercial radio stations
as well as
Swedish national radio. (It's been ..4 on the Swedish singles
chart, ..2 on the Swedish Dance Chart, ..8 on Scandinavian Dance
Chart and one of the most downloaded songs on Itunes... we could
go on here forever) But at the same time, credible Swedish music
magazine Sonic named it one of the best 15 euro disco songs of all
time. "The team of producers behind this lush dream, painted in
equal parts viscos and house, have understood the genius of the
eternally simple", writes their reviewer Sara Martinsson.

Although Petra loves writing and does frequently compose own
songs, all songs on In Orbit are written and produced by Jonas,
Niclas, and Anoo. For Petra, it's ideal as she loves their work.
- My favourite song on the album is probably "Cry for you". It's
about a relationship that just keeps going on although there is
not much love left, so the girl in the song decides to leave, says
Petra.
She always tries to picture the story of the song while singing
it. Her emotional singing has its base in the fact that she is a
very emotional person - she laughs a lot, cries a lot and stays up
at nights (she
still lives with her parents) singing, writing songs, or painting.
