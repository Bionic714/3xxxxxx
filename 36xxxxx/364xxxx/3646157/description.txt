Up To Here is the Second full-length album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip.

It was released in 1989, and made the band almost instantly famous in Canada; although it was also released in the United States, there was little reaction to it there. Many of the songs on the album are now considered classics, and are staples of various formats of Canadian radio.

"38 Years Old" is a fictional account of an escape from Millhaven Penitentiary in the band's hometown of Kingston, Ontario, although many people still mistakenly believe it refers to events from singer Gordon Downie's life.

"New Orleans is Sinking" is perhaps the band's most well-known song. When performed live, Downie often goes off on an ad-libbed tangent. In the most famous such version, a B-side from the 1994 CD single "Grace, Too", he performs a monologue about swimming with orcas, one of which bites his arm off after its mate falls in love with him. This version is often known as "Killerwhaletank". In other known versions, including the one that appears on the live album Live Between Us, he sings additional verses from songs by David Bowie, Joni Mitchell and The Beach Boys.

"Blow at High Dough" later became the theme song to the CBC dramedy Made in Canada.

All songs were written and performed by The Tragically Hip.
