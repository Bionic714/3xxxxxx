,manteca,2007-03-23T08:00Z,"thanks for the great game!!! sorry to ask, but i'm new in this, which program i can use to mount the game? thanks!!!"
,GEORGIAN,2007-03-23T23:54Z,DEViANCE's CR*CK is better than ViTALiTY?
,ulalume,2007-03-24T18:32Z,"When I am supposed to start my first race, the car disappears and I am just stuck there. (the game does not crash however, and all the menus work perfectly). Any suggestions??"

,Najdihojca,2007-03-25T20:36Z,"I'm having problems - the textures are being shreded and the sound is kinda weird. I'll try to reinstall. Thanx for the torrent anyway & DEViANCE are greatest.

P.S. manteca use daemon tools v 4.08."
,Najdihojca,2007-03-25T21:08Z,"Got it working now but I'm having the same problem as ulalume (comment 5).
Perhaps I'll figure it out. Other than that it's working perfectly and it's a superb game.

                                                             thanx"

,mod245,2007-04-30T04:35Z,Damn!I know why the race didn't start.Shit.LOL.
,mod245,2007-04-30T04:41Z," you need to  copy the IGE folder to the BNK folder. That should make the game work, because the IGE folder contains all the data in providing the races."
,Tullisjr,2007-08-01T23:09Z,"Just a question, when i shall start the game, i get upp a blackscreen and the game qutis. What is the problem?"

,Flanker22,2008-09-07T16:20Z,"Game[s] can be MOUNTeD with PowerISO, 
Deamon Tools and other progs. HTH."
,Flanker22,2008-09-07T16:23Z,"BLACK SCREEN.
If TDU is installed and crack applied and got a 
black screen while PC meets game requirements, try this advice:
""oh and for the black screen -.- right click - properties and then set it to run in 
640x480 resolution, run the game and have fun,( note: in the game u can change it to what u want, except 1360 x 768)
""

HTH."
