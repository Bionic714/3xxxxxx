I mean, how many time am I supposed to buy the shit?  Buy a thing to own it...not own it for a little while, you greedy whoremongers."

,Crawling_Chaos007,2009-05-23T02:12Z,"Comcast is fucking evil.  To Hell with them. 
Crom will laugh at them and cast them out of Valhalla. 
Did I mention I own this fucking movie...bring it on you shitworth Copyright thieves. 

Did I also mention this version is crap. Some horse fucking horse lover cut out ALL the scenes of harm to any animal. It's very obvious and VERY annoying. Perhaps it is the European toned down Nazi socialist cut version. Freedom of expression ripped out of the art due to a couple of assholes that don't like to see a horse get hurt..might I add that NO horse was fucking hurt in this film. 

I hate stupid people. That means over half the fucking world."
,netfire_,2010-12-01T05:38Z,"Hrm, no hose getting hurt version? that means also toned down sex scenes. I don't really like that. Any one know where the original cut is? or have it?"
