,the_nakaii,2008-02-15T15:42Z,hey Garmac why doncha buy an Nvidea XFX 6200 with 250 MB. I run it in my Powerpc Graphite G4 and they are cheap to get at ebay which is where i got mine
,the_nakaii,2008-02-15T15:49Z,"Hey munchkinray, I run the Toast 8.0.1 version that I got off thepiratebay and it works just ducky. No problem at all on my ancient AGP Graphics(sawtooth) PowerPc G4 Graphite DESKTOP. 
I don't know about version 7 as the 8.0.1 is my first exposure to the Roxio product. I do know that Roxio's Windows products suck to the maximum extent possible. New Mac User-the_nakaii"
