,white_fox,2007-03-26T22:33Z,"title:arnold1965 a sad truth
****************************************
you want to know a sad little fact about arnold1965 
he only uploads these movie so he gets attention because he has no friends in duetchsland he craves the little thx for the upload crap. if you didnt tell him this he would probably kill himself so talk to him and make the poor guy feel wanted also he spams people and takes there 40 dollars with clickbank affiliate programs.
arnold1965 i want my 40 dollars back id rather donate than give it to you, you loser.
arnold1965 please stop spamming tpb just upload the movies and give proper cred to the original release you stole this from and made your own. teafortwo,sisco etc. 
arnold if you need some friends join a sports team or something and get off your lazy ass clicking buttons on your pc and spend some time with real people.
instead of your ""e-friends""

you need help. seriously white_fox. why do you even bother coming to tpb? just to get noticed? oh yeah, you're getting noticed alright and in the most negative way. 

i think people should write to tpb and stop people like you from writing a lot of shit in here. 

you have issues then take it somewhere else because we don't give a shit about your sad life, if you have one.
i see you and your girlfriend jroc261 are teaming up. frankly i think your bothe the same people. try a sex change."
