Anyone should just be able to look at a photo of the Andromeda Galaxy for example and realize that there are no fluffy gods or devils.

Supernatural entities are needed by weak minded people who can't accept reality. They need to believe that they'll either go to some ""hell"" or a magical wonderland when they die.

When you die you rot and your flesh and bones will dissovle, and so will YOU, your personality and YOU as a being will dissolve as well, because YOU are electrical impulses / signals and atoms in the brain at the top of ""your"" head.

That's all there's to it.

Humanity is a completely insignificant thing on a completely insignificant planet in a completely insignificant solar system.

Beyond ""our"" solar system, there are countless other solar systems in the Galaxy that this system is a part of.

And further, beyond even this vast Galaxy, there are COUNTLESS OTHER Galaxies, which all in turn have THEIR solar systems, which, in turns holds their OWN respective planets in each system.

And that's a scary thing for many people, so they create supernatural beings to worship and whatnot, and refuse to acknoweldge that there's stuff beyond this planet, just so they can live easier.

However, not all people are weak minded like that and need to live in a fantasy world. But many are, and that's a sad thing.."
,KIM JONG IL,2007-04-07T02:00Z,"glad u told us the objective truth Dark-Alex. where did u get that info, by the way? and if i understand u correctly, the info you just shared is just ONE sporadic compilation of electric signals, stored in YOUR brain... hmm, but your brain is true?!? last i heard, there was a thing called subjectivity to add to the matter...
i'm not very religious (as you all might know), but hey... there is not ONE truth out there"

,neilaroo,2007-11-20T19:55Z,interesting stuff--but 36 lectures and 222 files?! why is each lecture divided into about 6 parts?
,Eunomiac,2008-02-01T16:40Z,"Discovering these TTC lectures has been an INCREDIBLE experience for me! I recommend everyone visit the Teaching Company site at http://www.library-teach12.com to see what's available; they're all fantastic.

Thanks very much for this upload, but I have a question: Where is the written outline/syllabus/bibliography mentioned by the professor throughout the lecture? I assume it came with the original audio files, and wonder why it was left out of the torrent.

As for the unfortunate division of files, there's an easy solution that doesn't take much work. I swear that this solution really IS easy; just describing it makes it sound more complicated than it is once you get going with it:

1) Download Audacity (Google it; it's a freeware program)
2) Follow the instructions to get it set up to export mp3 files (you have to download another file... it's not hard to figure out how to do this from the Audacity site)
3) From within Audacity, start a new project, then Import the six parts of a lecture you want to string together
4) Zoom out until the width of the screen represents about 30 minutes of play time (all of the blue waveforms will be squished up against the left side, since each file is only 5 minutes long) 
5) Use the Time Shifter tool (one of the buttons at top left) to shift each of the parts so they play one after the other. Since you imported them all into different channels, which are displayed in a list one on top of the other, the end result will look like a staircase.
6) Zoom in (still using the Time Shifter tool) and check each of the junction points where one file ends and another begins to make sure they line up well.
7) File --> Export as MP3.

If you want them to remember their position when you play them in iTunes/iPod, you can load them into iTunes, then right-click on them and in options check the 'Remember position' checkbox.

Hope that's helpful!"
,skraper,2008-04-24T02:58Z,"I am glad to see that after thousands of years of debate that Dark Alex has the final answer.  Apparently one insignificant mind of a completely insignificant human on a completely insignificant planet in a completely insignificant solar system has figured this one out.  

When monotheism first emerged the entire universe was thought to consist of the land people were living on, the water, and a big dome called the sky with little points of light(the stars) and one big light(the sun).  If man created the idea of God because it scared him to feel so small, it is strange that he did so so many centuries before humanity was remotely aware of the scope of the universe.


This is all coming from an agnostic.  I just get tired of angry atheists.  Lets have honest intellectual debate, that is the whole point of philosophy, isn't it.




As far as merging mp3's... I use Goldwave.  It has a merge function that will automatically merge multiple mp3s into one long file.  Just select the files and click merge.  I use it for all of my audiobooks."
,joelmanahoy,2008-05-19T17:23Z,thanks for the up. havent heard it yet though. controversy is the root of discovery. religion will destroy man kind though.
,Dicedude,2008-05-21T20:28Z,"Thanks for the great upload, very interesting stuff. I just wish it came with the PDF file. Thanks again."
,Mike727,2008-11-26T03:13Z,"Sweey Christ. This forum is not the place to discuss your own personal opinions. We could all give a shite what you think. Please just post comments relating the quality of the torrent or instructions on how to use it (thanks, Eunomiac). Keep your own opinions to yourselves, especially if you're going to sound like a douche bag when you expouse them (and you almost certainly will). 

Congratulations, Alex. While no one gives a shite what you think, nor does anyone agree with you, you have been successful in both completely alienating yourself and making everyone think that you are a complete wanker."
,Evg222,2009-03-31T15:52Z,"Great course, but as for the torrent - it is not. The compressed version (160 MB) is up here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4074110/TTC_audio_archive_-_part_3. 
The guidebook can be found at isohunt."
