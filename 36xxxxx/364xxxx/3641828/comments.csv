,FaZ,2007-03-18T19:52Z,Needs Y.A.S.U
,Molokk,2007-03-18T20:15Z,Is this one the same as announced at nForce masseur ?
,FaZ,2007-03-18T21:01Z,download Y.A.S.U v1.07 ....
,Molokk,2007-03-18T22:11Z,"Thank you masseur for seeding.

I'm at 50%, I will be seeding along with you as soon as it's ready on my side. It started at around 300 kb/s, and then it slowed down to around 50 to 60 kb/s, so it might take a little longer than I expected."
,EsChRiChT,2007-03-19T00:42Z,"Finally the real deal! :D

US-version or EU?"
,Molokk,2007-03-19T00:54Z,"We need more active seeders guys. And for those who can, please increase your upload bandwidth's maximum limit. I don't feel like searching for private seeders or finding good Newsgroups servers for this."
,TriGGer666,2007-03-19T15:47Z,"hmm, when I try to start the game i get the following message (FYI I suck at german)

""Die Page-Datei ist deaktivert oder die DateigrรถSSe reicht nicht aus.

Im zu funktioneren braucht das Spoel eine Page-Datei von mindestens 2GB.
Bitte die Systemkofiguration anpassen, bevor das Speiel erneut gestartet wird.""

Anyone who can translate and/or help?"
,Bamimi,2007-03-20T10:41Z,"trigger666 it says :
""the page file is to small or the file size is incorrect""

the page file needs at least 2 Gb's

please change system configuration and start it again"
,Dead-Inside,2007-03-20T18:19Z,Anyone wondering how; Right-click My Computer (/Your equivilant) -> Preference -> Advanced Tab -> Optimization -> Performance -> Advanced tab and you should see it at the bottom option. Open it up and change it.
,RexMundi,2007-03-20T22:51Z,"Works fine for me, great upload masseur! I didn't need Y.A.S.U. either, don't know why. Only problem is my PSU is too weak so my pc keeps f*cking up my graphics :("
,b17tony,2007-03-21T07:55Z,"Great masseur works perfectly. I got a message to insert the dvd when I tried to load up the game, but that was easily fixed with a no/dvd crack! Awesome Game many thanks !!!"
,snow32,2007-03-26T04:32Z,"when i play the game no graphics... walls, sky, land etc. can someone help me out?
