-Bio-

Nekromantix are quite simply the premier psychobilly band in the world. Founded in 1989, over the course of six albums (three in the US), Nekromantix have inspired a generation of rockabilly and psychobilly bands, earned a Grammy nod, and spawned the immensely popular side project Horrorpops, who have scanned over 80,000 CDs in their own right. Now comes Life Is A Grave And I Dig It!!!, a return to the raw, driving sound of early classics like Return of the Loving Dead. Anchored by leader Kim Nekroman's thumping upright bass, Life Is A Grave And I Dig It!!perfectly delivers on Alternative Press' description of the band as "a 1950s date with Motorhead." With a headlining national tour out of the box - the 2007 incarnation of the wildly successful Hellcat tour - and a world-wide following from extensive touring in Japan, the US, and Europe, Nekromantix will continue to lead the pack, all the way to the boneyard!
