,Judge6ex,2007-03-30T19:12Z,This torrent seems to survive without me. Im deleting the files from my pc and getting ready for the next box.
,flobie11,2007-04-27T04:19Z,"Is this Pandora Peaks & FKLW (AGAIN). It was upped in place of Cherry, Harry & Raquel + Common Law Cabin for DVD-08 of the collection. Anyone know if CHR+CLC ever made it?
Also...how about Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (Full DVD, not a rip). Would anyone else like this as much as me?? I know there was a 2006 2-disc release of this classic....drool drool"
