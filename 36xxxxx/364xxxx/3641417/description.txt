The first expansion pack for Ship Simulator 2006 features six completely new ships, varying from a historic yacht to a massive modern cruise ship. Unlike the ships already in the game, you can do a virtual walk on every ship of the expansion pack. Moreover, the ships of the expansion pack allow for direct steering using the controls on the bridge.
