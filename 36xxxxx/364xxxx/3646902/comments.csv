,white_fox,2007-03-26T22:25Z,"title:arnold1965 a sad truth
****************************************
you want to know a sad little fact about arnold1965 
he only uploads these movie so he gets attention because he has no friends in duetchsland he craves the little thx for the upload crap. if you didnt tell him this he would probably kill himself so talk to him and make the poor guy feel wanted also he spams people and takes there 40 dollars with clickbank affiliate programs.
arnold1965 i want my 40 dollars back id rather donate than give it to you, you loser.
arnold1965 please stop spamming tpb just upload the movies and give proper cred to the original release you stole this from and made your own. teafortwo,sisco etc. 
arnold if you need some friends join a sports team or something and get off your lazy ass clicking buttons on your pc and spend some time with real people.
instead of your ""e-friends""

,cherrybabe,2007-03-26T22:42Z,"you really have some problems white_fox  and just want attention.
you need help. seriously white_fox. why do you even bother coming to tpb? just to get noticed? oh yeah, you're getting noticed alright and in the most negative way.
i think people should write to tpb and stop people like you from writing a lot of shit in here. 
you have issues then take it somewhere because we don't give a shit about your sad life, if you have one."
,cherrybabe,2007-03-26T22:59Z,"SERIOUSLY PEOPLE. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO NOTIFY TPB ABOUT THESE 2 white_fox  & jroc261. WE COME TO TPB TO DOWNLOAD MOVIES, MUSIC AND GAMES BUT WHY SHOULD UPLOADERS LIKE ARNOLD1965 BE HASSLED?
NO UPLOADER SHOULD BE HASSLED AT ALL.

PLEASE EVERYBODY - SEND A MESSAGE TO TPB AND HAVE THESE IDIOTS BANNED FROM TPB.

THIS HASSLING/HARRASING HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH AND I'M SURE SICK OF IT.
JUST LET US DOWNLOAD IN PEACE AND THE UPLOADER LEFT ALONE.

THOSE WHO HAVE UPLOADED ARNOLD1965 MOVIES AND HAVE APPRECIATED THEM COULD DO HIM A FAVOUR BY HELP STOPPING THESE IDIOTS."

,septembr1,2008-04-12T14:16Z,"Hi, which soft do I have to use to put these files together on a DVD ?

Toast Titanium can't do it. I'm on mac os x.

Thanks."
,rickster,2008-06-01T11:27Z,septembr1: are you sure? you should just be abe to extract the files into a img-file and then just drag the img-file to toast titanium and burn it.
