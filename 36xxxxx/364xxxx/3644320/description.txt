A smaller version of the excellent TV special on radical islam, found here:

"This is the one hour MSNBC show that aired Thursday, November 16th 2006 at 7:00pm.

This is about the Islamic extremist terrorists and what their agenda is.

Like Hitler, they publish their agenda - it is found on arab television in countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Lebanon."

The most disturbing part of this, is the cartoons obviously aimed at children, which depict a man blowing himself up. How sick does a culture need to be, when children are indoctrinated with pure hatred, and taught that it is OK to kill others simply because they have different religious beliefs?
