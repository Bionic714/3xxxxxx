,stromfromel,2008-02-05T20:58Z,I wonder if it's really possible to download the whole episode:/ (doesn't think so) I love Anime and must have it! 
,kar10,2008-03-08T04:04Z,Any comments on the quality. Is this dvdrip?
,Hiroyuki0487,2008-03-09T22:09Z,"Hey, Yeah we need active seeders , the quilty of these is near satalite or cable just so you know

ACTIVE SEEDERS PLEASE"
,Hiroyuki0487,2008-03-11T07:44Z,"Once the torrent Finishes I will also seed

But until then 

I NEED ACTIVE SEEDERS PLEASE AND ALOT OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!"
,RKngel,2008-03-11T17:48Z,"Ok, is downloading we see how many time takes"
,kar10,2008-03-16T13:53Z,It's not dvdrip. This is recorded from TV broadcasting and has english subtitles burned into the video. The video and audio are good and  clear 8/10. It took me from 3/10 to 3/16 to completely download everything.
,w35z0r,2008-04-09T17:56Z,"Resolution?  I guess it'd be 780... tv rip..
By the way, asking people to seed is pretty much a waste of your time.  By that, I mean there is no direct correlation between the number of seeders and ""lol plox seed"" posts.
But don't take my word for it, go out there and explooooooooooooore!!!!!"
,Mike.E.Misery,2008-05-15T04:35Z,Holy shit. I'm gunna be d'loadin this shit for days cuz ppl don't know how to leave the BitTorrent client open and seed after they finish. They think oh. yay. its finally finished d'loading. I'm gunna close it and watch it now. But wut about the ppl who haven't got it yet? They never think about that. Assholes.
,dukedoit,2009-06-11T07:52Z,I'll seed this after I finish it =) My upload is only around 50kb/sec though but it's better than nothing.
,hecsagon23,2009-06-26T09:46Z,"Thanks!
