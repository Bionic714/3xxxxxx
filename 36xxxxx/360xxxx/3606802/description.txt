Most young boys dream of becoming a pilot, a police officer, a baseball player, or the like, but Oh Dong Gu (Ryu Duk Hwan) is a bit different. His lifetime dream is to become Madonna! Or at least a superstar like her. The problem, of course, is that he's a teenage boy, so to pay for his sex change he needs a lot of money. Lady Luck knocks at the door in the form of a ssireum (traditional Korean wrestling) contest, the answer to all his dilemmas. Just ten years ago, a subject like this would have raised huge controversies, but Lee Hae Joon and Lee Hae Young focused on comedy and quirky characters in writing and directing their debut Like a Virgin.
