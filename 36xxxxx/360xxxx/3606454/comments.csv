,brutalspoon,2007-02-21T08:53Z,"Yeah, I'm having problems playing the game too... not sure whether its the same reason as the others, but I've installed Diabolo II (Single Player, without the expansion) yet when I go to play it, it tells me to verify that the 'Play Disc' is in the drive... which it is... anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated ^_^"
,thejakeman,2007-02-22T02:02Z,same here....
,brutalspoon,2007-02-28T18:31Z,"I finally got it to work... you just need to download some patches/files so that it works 'without the cd', even though you need the cd... the links to these files can be found here:

http://www.brutalspoon.com/files/D2Patch_109b.exe

http://www.brutalspoon.com/files/d2-v109-nocd_d2c.zip

Install the patch, and then swap the file in the directory with the one in that zip folder. Works like a charm :D"

,DD4ever,2007-08-20T20:43Z,Does this work with mac?
,Espionage724,2007-09-03T02:35Z,You can play Diablo II online as long as your CD-Key isn't being used at the same time you try to log on and as long as the Cd-Key isn't banned or anything.
,soultrasher,2007-09-21T00:19Z,OH SHIT!  that crack does work!!! thanx brutalspoon!!!!

,FromOblivion,2008-06-06T05:42Z,"hey can anyone tell me where to find a no cd patch that ACCUALLY works, I keep getting ""please insert play disk"" error with the ones I'm using.....:)"
,MisplacedFate1313,2008-06-10T00:22Z,"I've tried nearly all the D2 torrents, and this is the first one I've gotten to work. I have advice for people trying to get these to work, because I think the others might have the same issues:

*Install all the discs, including LOD expansion (daemontools worked 4 me, or burn, whatever). Do the upgrade that comes after you've finished installing LOD. There are cd keys/keygens for both DII and LOD all over most of these torrents, and most of them work. Don't expect to get on battlenet, unless you do hitachi (or get a primo key somehow).

*Don't use the cracks that come with these torrents. They don't work. Go to www.gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/diablo2.shtml
 & download the v1.11 exes (I dl'ed all and used trial and error to find right one). There is a crack for game.exe, and another for Diablo II.exe, you want both. Make sure you've fully installed LOD (then done the upgrade to single player in the autoplay menu) before you apply the cracks. Then right click the Diablo II crack once you've applied it, and make that your shortcut. I didn't need to apply any no-cd patches, you shouldn't either.

ajemeister, you have my endorsement. You managed to pull off a good torrent in the midst of a pile of crap.

Thanks for the public service!"
,FromOblivion,2008-06-13T08:51Z,"WAY TO GO FINALLY DIABLO II IS CRACKED!!!!! THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME IN THE MAKING AND CUDOS TO ALL INVOVLED!......ESPECIALLY THE ONES WHO WROTE THE CRACK CODE, I HAVE BEEN THROUGH ALL 3,476,922 LINES OF CODE LOOKING FOR THE ONE LINE TO DISABLE THE NO CD CHECK AND SOMEONE ELSE DID IT JUST LIKE THAT!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH BLIZZARD DID A GOOD JOB OF KEEPING THIS FROM THE OPEN-SOURCERS FOR FAR TOO LONG......GOOD JOB EVERYONE THE CRACK WORKS BUT YOU STILL NEED THE CD......( ISO he he he)"

,krod77,2008-06-30T06:02Z,"Hi, for all thoes who are having trouble do not go through the trouble of finding cracks/cd patches

Blizzard has recently allowed no cds, all you must do is download the official update and it will work flawlessly.

cheers"
,burst6,2008-07-03T17:31Z,i downloaded the patch but my game still tells me i need a disk. this is going to sound stupid but wheres the iso file? all i see is MPQ and when i try to open them with winrar all i get is text documents with a bunch of illegible things
,FromOblivion,2008-07-13T19:46Z,"you have to copy the original MPQ's to youre Diablo 2 folder for the blizzard patch to work.  To Burst6 just mount the images to a cd/dvd with either dvd decrypter or win iso, or you can just "" burn from iso "" with cdburnerXP, it's a completely FREE burning utility that is all you need!!"
,cal1235,2008-07-16T17:27Z,"Hey guys :)

i dont even know how to install this thing? xD cud anyone help?

i extracted the diablo 2 install.iso

but now im stuck :P"
,wujuhuwu,2008-07-31T19:58Z,"Torrent worked and thanks for the CD-Keys posted earlier, but I'm getting un unrecoverable error. I patched with Blizzard 1.12 but the game keeps crashing. I keep getting the message ""line #143 Unrecoverable Internal Error - error 6fabda65"" 

Anyone else seen this, and anyone know how to fix it? A search doesn't turn up anything definitive. 

Thanks!"
,theavenged78,2008-08-06T00:46Z,"hey blizzard really did make a patch so you dont have to use the cd.  just go to blizzard and download the patch.  you have to burn each file from this torrent to a cd.  then put the diablo 2 cd in. open the cd from the ""my computer"" then you copy the music file into where you installed diablo II.  you have to do this for expansion too if you play expansion. but it really works"
,therighthand,2008-10-06T02:53Z,"No finished seeders what so ever, stop being ridiculous and share what other people shared with you intially."
,JolleyRoger,2009-01-05T20:36Z,"anyone know if their is anyway of getting a working CD?  maybe something like taking the iso's  extracting them, adding the patch re isoing..... or just adding a no cd patch to the iso, rename the .exe files for the no cd patch or something...  Anyone? any ideas?"
,JolleyRoger,2009-01-06T21:51Z,"never mind, i got it.  just enabled winrar to deal with isos, unzipped them (put the larger mpqs back in the diablo 2 play disk) and downloaded the patch from blizards site that wa posted earlier. one for d2 one for the xpac.  added them to it, re-iso'd and burnt them. now ive got a full set of working disks... now i just need some legit CD keys. gonna buy some or see if friends have any"
,bovoid,2009-03-13T16:48Z,"does the error actually say ""Please verify the fucking D2LOD Disc is in the drive""? Cause if it does that's awesome"

And the no-cd patches aren't needed just the v 1.12 update and extracting 2 mpqs into game directory (D2xVideo and D2xMusic... might be different for others)
