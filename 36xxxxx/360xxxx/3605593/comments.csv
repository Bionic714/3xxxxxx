A martial artist afflicted with a rare disease that makes beautiful women want to kill him, goes on a suicide mission to find true love anyway. Set against the whistling collapse of the Cho family dynasty, three intensely dysfunctional karate brothers engage in all manner of skullduggery vying for ""father's riches."" Vatchel is being lead to slaughter. He is duped into a dangerous quest by his treacherous and grumpy brother, Shang, who wants the money for himself. In a world of intense beauty, trickery and deceit, Vatchel must find true love, but to save his own life, he must find it in the darkest place of all... his family."

,Hanzodk,2007-02-01T19:43Z,"I must very much agree with toomuch1060. I don't like to comment a movie, cause luckely we don't all have the same taste, but after watching 20 min. of this film, I feel that it is my duty, on behalf of mankind, to tell you that this movie could quite possibly be the worst I've ever lied eyes on, and I've seen some pretty crappy stuff over the years.
Just so you're warned people.
