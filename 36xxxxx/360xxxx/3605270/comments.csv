,feberkufen,2007-01-28T17:41Z,Why not Swesub?
,Beat surrender,2007-01-28T20:54Z,"Man, sometimes I think EVERYTHING evolves around Swedish subs! I thought you taught English in Swedish schools, but obviously I was mistaken. The Swedish people most be the most useless in understanding English, since ALL they ever ask for is Swedish subtitles. How can a countries languageknowledge be so poor, especially in such a developed county as Sweden? When did they quit teaching English at school? When you go abroad, do you ask for subtitles talking to people who aren't Swedish? I heard Sweden dropped a lot of places in the International Grades and, looking at TPB, I can believe it."
,=michael=,2007-01-28T21:23Z,"Beat surrender
well in the netherlands you cant quit english at school!!!"
,mateng,2007-01-28T21:33Z,"lol, well said. I'm from Sweden but agree on everything. These people rather have a bad translated movie than learn a couple of words and enjoy the original version. Pathetic."
,Wisurriv,2007-01-28T21:44Z,Who said Sweden was a developed country????
[T],Malekay,2007-01-28T22:42Z,mateng: u really don´t have to use the sub u know. The sub is for those who need it and there are people spending there freetime translate. I think it´s nothing wrong with that.
,Beat surrender,2007-01-28T23:37Z,"First of all, my thoughts on my previous post were obviously much faster than my fingers: exuse my key-errors. To Malekay: neither I, nor mateng (if I can speak on his/her part without asking), critizice that subs sometime are needed. Still, it seems very odd and discomforting that Swedish people are so bad at English that 99% of the questions on TPB are ""Why no Swedish subs?"". Had it been Chinese, hindu, Spanish etc, I wouldn't object. But as I understand Swedish schools teach English from 3rd or 4th grade in your system. "
,Beat surrender,2007-01-28T23:38Z,"I also assume you have some TV-programs in English, which means a learning experience. Maybe even some records distributed with people singing in English. I simply cannot understand how the need for Swedish subs can be so great, unless the educationlevel has dropped to a freezingpoint. I totally agree with mateng, without putting anyone on a piedestal: make an effort to try and learn the language instead. Buy a dictionary, go to a class. "
,Beat surrender,2007-01-28T23:38Z,"If you haven't realized it yet, and this may come as a chock for some, outside Sweden not too many people actually speak Swedish. English is still considered to be a universal language, at least a lot more than Swedish. Take a chance and learn something instead of retreating to a provincial position that has no future."
,screenslave,2007-01-28T23:45Z,"The educationlevel HAS dropped to a freezing point within the Swedish schoolsystem. A lot of pupils can't even speak and/or write Swedish satisfactory when they leave the 9th grade. How can we then expect them to understand English? Man, they're clinging to subtitles like lifeboats, since many don't care about learning anything - at least not what the school or society think they should learn. And yeah, I think Sweden WAS a developed country, but the future looks pretty dark. It's embarassing to witness."
,JJ-440,2007-01-29T00:43Z,Thanks for the release mate!
,mster,2007-01-29T02:14Z,"Beat surrender.. how´s your Swedish?
This is a Swedish site. Is it very hard to understand that swedes want swede subs?

Spanish and Germans dub their movies. 
Swedes sometimes want a subtitle.
And the americans.. They just look at american movies and if there´s a really cool film somewhere like from Japan, what do they do..? Subs ? dubs? no they´ll do a remake instead as with The Ring. And the internationalized americans think it´s another great american movie because they now so little about the world outside.

And now to the secret. We know English. But we also like to have subs. And when my daughter 9 years old need the subtitles to catch up, she doesnt´t want the spanish sub. "
,daardjik,2007-01-29T03:15Z,"wtf, since when is a movie like this appropriate for your 9 yr old daughter?"
,waxdaddy,2007-01-29T07:18Z,"so ... anyone watch this? good quality? audio in sync?
"
,napmil,2007-01-29T08:21Z,"To Beat surrender.............you don´t like people from Sweden asking you to add swedish subs to the movies? ok.....that´s very strange......because first of all the pirate bay is made by swedes and second....we swedes are better in english than people in the most countries all over the world......and what if you have a hearing problem?????...wouldn´t you want to have subs if you had that??????........And for last, it´s not that we don´t understand the language but how can you learn new words if you don´t have anything to compare them with? do you follow me?...It´s one thing to understand a language and another thing to develope it."
,vjineo,2007-01-29T10:28Z,"it is not downloading ? :((

is this from someother private tracker ?"
,se02827,2007-01-29T13:22Z,"I asked a friend that is a former US resident if he isn't annoyed by seeing swedish subtitles in the picture when he goes to the movies. He said that he was a first, but soon discovered how convenient it was to actually see what people are saying all the time. Last time he went visiting his family back in US, they went to see some movies, and he really missed having the subtitle there.

I myself too prefer to have subtitles on english movies, but I don't care if it's swedish or english language in them."
,=michael=,2007-01-29T18:39Z,"First of all the pirate bay is made by swedes. YES I AGREE we swedes are better in english than people in the most countries all over the world. YES I AGREE< JUST LIKE IN THE NETHERLANDS

AND TPB IS NOT ONLY FOR SWEDISCH PEOPLE."
,=michael=,2007-01-29T18:41Z,And yes i prever dutch subtitels when i watch a movie. more easy to understand the movie. expecialy when i watch a movie with a friend of whatever...
,artcourtesan,2007-01-29T20:36Z,what is sweden?
,soulman_uk,2007-01-30T16:22Z,"many thanks for the upload, im not bothered about the subs as the film will be in english, but if i was watching a film in a different language ie district 13/fearless/battle royale i would want my english subs.. other than that i never watch them unless they are needed on screen (i.e french bits in da vinchi code - not that i acknowledge there was ever a film by that name!)

soulman_uk!"
,Awweboy,2007-01-31T14:25Z,"Just want you to know ""Beat surrender"" and all other that think that Sweden isn't a developed country, that even if Sweden has dropped in BNP on the most recent years that doesn't mean that we're not developed. BNP doesn't count money spent on school education and wealth for inhabitants. Nor does it count reading capability etc. To count this FN has made a value called HDI. And if you test Sweden against for example USA you can really see that Sweden has a far better value of HDI than USA. 

So go somewhere else because Piratebay is really a Swedish site from the start of it all. AND how can that be, that Sweden, so undeveloped, can actually run a site big like this? 

Please try to have more accure information before writing next time."
,jhunley233,2007-01-31T14:43Z,"i thought the purpose of comments was to comment something useful that applies to the movie like quality of audio and video,  i could not care less about your opinions on how swedish schools are under educated and blah blah blah...........  what about the damn movie...
anyone actually seen this?????????????"
,Uncle Dixon,2007-01-31T15:00Z,"No matter how fascinating the dialogue above might be, I totally agree with Jhunley: For fu_k sake, how is the quality of this torrent!!!!!???
(And yes, I'm Swedish and dont care shit for subtitles)"
,Turalyon,2007-02-01T02:32Z,"After having read some of your comments I belive the root of the argument is that many non Sweeds, myself included, feel that too many Sweedes are complaining about Swedish subs. But why not in English? The native language of the film?(for the most part) I can watch a film without subs but I like to have them in English cause many times I don't hear what someone is saying due to loud noises or bullets, etc. 

And to a note to all swedes: TPB is HOSTED in Sweden, but it is for EVERYONE(Ever noticed all the languages you can view TPB in?). So please let's get more DVD rips with english primarily and mabye swedish subs, ok?"
,kajsanova,2007-02-01T19:23Z,"This is a stupd conversation!! I know plenty of Americans who don´t understand British English!! They need english subtitels sometimes!! So what´s so horryfying about Sweeds waning swe subs? Yes, we´re taugh English from 3rd grade, but not everybody have the ability to learn new languages!!"
[V],robbie1412,2007-02-02T11:34Z,quality???

,tanporakuda,2007-02-27T01:08Z,"Funny thing, 
I know very few Swedes and a decent amount of British and Americans. The Swedes I know use the English language more correctly than most native guys (specially Americans). I think it has to do with reading, something which Americans don't seem to be very fond of.

Oh, and the Swedes I know can also speak Spanish quite fluently. It might not be the international language, but it is the second most spoken language, after Chinese. Yes English is the third. (check Wikipedia for the info).

On another note: thanks for the upload kollll. "
,GodIII,2007-02-27T14:54Z,"ARGHHHHH - great quality etc - but stops at Chpt 34 and starts again!! MISSING THE END!!!
So great if you want to watch for 2:15 and then not know what happens at the end!!!!"
,Silent1377,2007-03-03T11:13Z,Is it there Finnish subtitles ??
,Angel44,2007-08-01T13:15Z,Thank you
,jamesjameson,2007-10-25T12:20Z,:thankyou: ul
,barton101,2012-08-09T08:38Z,"Next time, please at least include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
