S02E04 - Alaskan Avalanche
Two climbers and close friends, Jim Sweeney and Dave Nyman, are scaling an ice-wall near Alaska?s Mount Johnson when Jim falls down and suffers some major injuries. Dave attempted to create a makeshift SOS signal, though when a passing light aircraft attempts to land to rescue the injured man, the landing gear on the plane breaks and the pilot and his pregnant wife become stranded in the icy wasteland as well.
