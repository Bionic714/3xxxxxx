[b]Don Camilo[/b]
 In Brescello, a villa of the valley of the Po where the life is hard and scanty the economic resources of his inhabitants, there live Don Camilo, the local parson, and Pepone, the communist mayor. Though both men astonish privately, his political ideas and his struggles for being the heads of the community divide them.
