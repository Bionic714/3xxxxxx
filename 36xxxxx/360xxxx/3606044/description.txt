Release notes: With the surgical precision of an epidemic needle and the raw, awesome power of an atomic detonation, SOULBREACHs debut album will add a new flavour to aggressive music. On My Dividing Line the band has managed to combine the ruthless energy, the pinpoint accuracy and the massive ponderosity that is SOULBREACH.

SOULBREACH has recorded their debut album "My Dividing Line" in Studio Underground, Västerås (Sweden). Produced and engineered by Pelle Saether (Terror 2000, Carnal Forge, Steel Attack). Mastered at Unisound by Dan Swano (Bloodbath, Edge of Sanity, Nightingale).

Enjoy and please seed.
