just thought i'd say that this is a great solutions manual. but if your doing it for assignments make sure not to copy exactly and check calculations, there are a few errors. when i took the class 17ppl got caught for cheating from these solutions and professor flipped. i did the questions for the wrong week, lol, thats about the only reason i didnt get caught. haha"
