I downloaded this clip from YouTube, Sissel sings Andrew Lloyd Webber\'s Pie Jesu. Every time I se this clip my eyes tears up, it\'s so beautiful, Sissel must have one of the best voices in the world.
This clip is an flv-file, but plays fine in WindowsMediaPlayer. I have KazaaLite-codecpack and Microsofts WMV-pack installed on my system.
Enjoy!
