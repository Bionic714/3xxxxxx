The Hottest Songs of 2006 as voted in Australia's biggest publicly voted music countdown. Run by Triple J (JJJ).	

This version is an update of the previous one. It replaces "072 - Jet - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is.mp3" (which was actually 25 minutes of silence) with the correct file. Also, a renamed file "022 - Tool - One Crowded Hour.mp3" to "022 - Tool - Vicarious.mp3". The original file is actually correct, its just named and tagged incorrectly.
