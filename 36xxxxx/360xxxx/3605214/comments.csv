It sounds like the gain has been recorded too high and I get a lot of distortion on the tracks. I can only play then softly. Thought you might like to know this. Thanks again! H"

TO EVERYONE:
If you weren't aware song numbers 101 to 200 of 2008 is listed at the triple J site:
http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/kingsmill/playlist/s2475563.htm

It has been made into a torrent for us at Pirate Bay to download:
http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/kingsmill/playlist/s2475563.htm

If you want to see the 101 to 200th song list of past years, please post a comment to Richard Kingsmill's (The station manager and an announcer) blog where he lists the 101 to 200 songs:
http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/kingsmill/playlist/s2475563.htm

I have got the ball rolling with my comment. I also would like to see him publish the entire list so we know exactly where our favourites ended up."
,cdtext,2009-05-01T18:46Z,"I finally got around to listening to some of this torrent.  Track 10 which is ""010 - The Grates - 19-20-20.mp3"" I assume is a live version.

The original studio version from the album which is the one from the countdown that was played on the live broadcast and everyone voted for can be found here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4704857/The_Grates_-_Gravity_Won_t_Get_You_High

or from the original source at demonoid.

If you are non-Australian and you just heard that live version you may be wondering how we would have voted for that other, I assume Live version, at number 10."
