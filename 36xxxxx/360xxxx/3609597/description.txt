Aprils Hotel Room - Black 14

This record is the result of a bunch of guys in Simi Valley,CA who weren\'t interested in being anything but a great, jamming rock band. they toured with the Allman Bros! All these songs are great and its sad to see that it didnt do more but MTV would sometimes borrow the beginning of \"God\" to some lame ass reality show and the band never got credit for it.
