,-Fredrik-,2007-01-21T18:00Z,"problem of burning .vob files?
vobfiles are dvd, if u insert a dvd in ur cd room and explore that folder. it contains .vob files
just mark them all include the .ifo and the rest and add them all to ur burning program.
i u still got problem. install easier burningsoftware.
i recomend ""ulead moviefactory v5 plus""
its a great program"
