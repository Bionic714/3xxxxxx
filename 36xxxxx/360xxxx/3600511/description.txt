Synopsis: Based on the [cÃ³mic] of drawn Bruce Jones by Bernie Wrightson, Jenifer is the provoking history of a modern Lolita that destroys the bodies of all the men that cross in their road.
Their horribly unsightly face contrasts with their sculptural body; this strange alchemy causes a charm similar to that of the sirens in the face of each man that you/he/she/it know.
After the Frank agent saved their life and adopted it, Jenifer doesn't know another form of expression that the wrong.
