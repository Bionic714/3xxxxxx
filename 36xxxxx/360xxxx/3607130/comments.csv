Oh and if anyone has any of the World or Dimension books not listed here I'd love to get them from you."
,penpen,2007-01-31T16:24Z,"I have a fairly decent pile of Rifts books lying around, but unfortunatly nothing that's missing from your list.
I do have a few of the robotech books if you're interested as well as Heroes unlimited.
I'd be interested in getting my hands on pretty much any Palladium book, but Rifts and sci-fi settings foremost. It would be great if you had Psyscape."

,Krissz,2007-03-31T19:20Z,I'm moving to my new apartment so I don't know where are all my RPG books but it is possible that I have one or two which isn't in the torrents. Give me a few weeks to gather everything.
,RiffyFox,2007-03-31T23:17Z,Please upload the after the bomb stuff please!! 
,Sephael,2007-04-13T09:26Z,"I don't think I have very many TMNT/After the Bomb books, and right now I'm not even sure where the ones I do have are, but I'll try finding them....it might take some time though going through a couple thousand cds."
,generalissimo,2007-04-25T21:13Z,"Thanks very much for the torrent.
I notice that many of the sourcebooks have much of the text missing. Is this my problem (a bad download or unpacking) or is it the same for everybody?  One that I have bad as an example is World Book 6: South America.
Let me know 'cause if I have a bad copy I shouldn't keep seeding."
