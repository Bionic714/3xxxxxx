,jmk_84,2007-01-26T23:55Z,STONEDSTONER!!!!!what are you using some fuckin retarted xp go fuck yourself with that xp..vista is 20 times better than xp
[V],kalleanka_98,2007-01-27T05:22Z,Please describe what benefits i would get from using vista instead of xp.
,jmk_84,2007-01-27T22:41Z,xp security sucks big time try out vista and youll know..if i need to compare vista on xp it would be same to compare xp on me...there is a huge difference
[V],kalleanka_98,2007-01-29T05:49Z,"""xp security sucks big time try out vista and youll know""
Give a example on change with security please, because i am not really sure that i will even notice this type of new security myself. Please refrain from referencing to the fact that Vista is delivered using specific service accounts for services deemed vulnerable, because this is possible in the same extent with xp, making it a end-user responsibility, not a OS problem. And please name a example on the ""huge difference""."
