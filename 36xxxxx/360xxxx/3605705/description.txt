                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This planet seems increasingly fragile, and we're just starting to see the 
first signs of serious political will globally to protect it. Global warming 
and the destruction of natural habitats and animal species are becoming 
priority issues for governments. This week we present two field reports that 
highlight this theme, and how communities and individual activists are doing 
something to alleviate these problems, one small step at a time. We have a 
report from Tennessee by the CBC's veteran reporter Joe Schlesinger and his 
energetic producer Jet Belgraver about an animal refuge for elephants 
recovering from trauma and abuse. These elephants are part of a larger 
problem in Africa, Asia and India where elephant communities are under 
increasing threat by poaching and habitat destruction, resulting in 
uncharacteristically aggressive behaviour on the part of the animals. 
Scientists say this change in behaviour is a warning sign to humans. Our 
second report is by the CBC's enterprising Nancy Durham who travelled to 
Cornwall, Britain to report on how the rocky and stormy coast has become a 
mecca for surfers, but also for clean energy entrepreneurs who are hoping to 
harness wave power as an alternative energy source.
