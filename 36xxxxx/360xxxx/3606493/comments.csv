,shoois,2007-01-30T22:51Z,is this with good sound or ?
,Bing80,2007-02-08T12:21Z,"Something is definitely fishy with the sound on this PROPER release... Sounds like there's only one channel which is centered, and it's not properly encoded to play in a DVD player..."

,expat29,2007-02-12T20:14Z,"Hi, thanks for the film.  Can someone tell this dummy (me) how to play it.  I have all the codecs but I don't understand this file structure.  I don't see any .avi files.  What plays the  47 files that I have now?
Thx"
,expat29,2007-02-12T20:34Z,Never mind.  I found the .rar file and figured out it would build the .avi. 
,kinder1,2007-02-13T20:24Z,any one else have a problem with the sound when it's written to dvd? is there a way to fix this?
