,bodeb,2007-02-04T22:55Z,"Many reports, although my Russian is bad, a nice documentation!"
,kamikatz,2007-03-23T23:28Z,Nice! This one has gone out of stock a long time ago!
[T],Roys,2007-04-17T10:39Z,"This is an interresting material. Some recordings are repeated several times. The dates given for some recordings are wrong. So be critical to the material, but it's anyhow very interesting."
,mbw23,2007-04-22T18:43Z,"Roys- yeah you're right.  I did my best to clean up these tracklists but then ran out of steam.  I figured that with all this, quantity could be allowed to trump quality :)

Meanwhile, I could find no other sources for the torrent's data.  It seems like it was posted to Usenet some time ago by Mr KM99 and that was that.  Hats off to him for the compilation work!"

,mbw23,2008-01-14T23:14Z,"oh ffs, you guys come out of the ground like rats.  go do something more useful with your time."
,valhalla1488,2008-02-12T16:39Z,"Of course there isn't anything on the holohoax, cause it is  obvious it is an exaggerated story for the industry. Of course the ""stories"" they try and tell us could stand on it's own feet? am I right? otherwise they wouldn't have to imprison so many people who ask questions. "
,ozaawiinimkize,2008-02-18T04:43Z,"Great upload, thanks mbw23.

I approach pretty much everything critically, but 'valhalla' ... your a fuccin idiot. 

holohoax? are you kidding me? 
you dont read many books do you? (comics and coloring books dont count, sorry). 

As if Germans are the oppressed ones, give me a break you jack ass. 

that's as ridiculous as suggesting that my people weren't attacked by the europeans that invaded north america. our numbers reduced by 98% because of genocide and disease (the genocide and disease came part in parcel with 'persecuted' religious nuts from england, france, spain, protugal, germany and italy). 

maybe someday you'll see face to face the results of centuries of rape and genocide. . . oh sorry, maybe a more familiar term for your ignorant azz - colonization. 

putz.

,ozaawiinimkize,2008-02-18T04:47Z,oh yeah... by the way.. .valhalla.... hitler was a biatch. just like chris columbus. 
,lordquilton,2008-02-25T06:00Z,"Too exhaustive for me (and my download limit), but I'm glad it's here nonetheless- Thank you."
,FilePile,2008-03-07T01:52Z,"Thanks. I have been looking for this type of material for a while, as I compile History DVD's for a heritage centre. They will make good authentic sound tracks. Well done."
,VictorianDreamer23,2008-03-12T03:00Z,All the 1943 files are just triplicates of the same files. any chance of fixing this problem? not sure about the rest of the files yet.
,sp4cey4n_b,2008-03-30T13:52Z,"... man .... it's gems like this that make the Bay & P2P essential ...
... top work chaps ..."
,setianfarts,2008-07-02T23:37Z,"Are there really over 900 here? That's what my virus scanner claims. None were found - but that doesn't always mean anything. When I first opened the folder it showed all the files, when I tried to unrar the first one my pc started running at 100% and the files didn't unzip, and now whenever I try to open the folder it appears empty and my pc runs at a 100% - either this upload is a total  joke (which would effin kill me cuz I was lookin' foward to this one) or already my pc is out of date.  If you all swear on your lives that this a legitamate download then I and a couple others would really really really really  appreciate it if the download were sectioned a little better - perhaps grouping some of the speeches together so that the first opening of the folder isn't so taxing on the system."
,setianfarts,2008-07-03T00:45Z,I think I just need more ram - I was able to access the files one at a time from the search option. :(  It would be a good idea to offer this in smaller downloads for persons with less powerful computers.  If nobody else wants or can do it and if nobody objects I could do it sometime.  
,setianfarts,2008-07-03T01:19Z,by the way - thanks for uploading this :) to say it's really made my day doesn't do well enough - it's more like it's toatlly made my whole year - maybe 2 years.
,elviswildride,2008-08-19T07:53Z,"""Of course there isn't anything on the holohoax""

valhalla, why would you expect to hear something that never happened?
"
,RobHunter,2008-11-28T17:08Z,I would first off like to thank mbw23 for this upload. I understand that there are those of you who believe that there is no information concerning the holocaust and others who are foolish or hateful enough to deny that this most egregious of atrocities committed against humanity in the modern era ever took place. To both of you I recommend Ed Murrow's April 15 1945 broadcast of the Buchenwald concentration camp.
,Wopatoolie,2009-01-24T23:12Z,"this collection is fkn awesome for anyone truly interested, very well done. cheers"
,D-503,2009-04-16T01:10Z,"Thanks for the upload, lots of interesting stuff here.

And to the holocaust deniers here - why don't you type 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' into the search bar and download that instead (what am I saying, that was probably the first thing you downloaded when you registered with Pirate Bay)? And when you've done that, why don't you just fuck off and kill yourselves? There you go - problem solved."
