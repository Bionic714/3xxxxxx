isn't it great to have at least a few filmmakers like mr. Curtis out there?"

I just can't believe I found this movie! 

When it was beeing aired on HVO I programmed my VCR to rtape the parts so I could see it  altogether. Very well, I don't know what happened with the tape: iit got lost and could never be found again. Mistery ! 

After that HBO never aired it again.

I searched unsuccessfully in rental stores for this movie and already had given it up when I found this precious torrent. 

Thounds and thousands of thanks for this. 

I'll be seeding up to 200 % or more .

Congratulations on all your very useful torrents and thanks once more!
