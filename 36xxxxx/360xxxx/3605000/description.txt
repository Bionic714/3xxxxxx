01 The Engineer's Plot. 
The revolutionaries who toppled the Tsar in 1917 thought science held the key to 
their new world. In fact, it ended up creating a bewildering world for millions 
of Soviet people. In this light-hearted investigation, one industrial planner 
tells how she decided the people wanted platform shoes, only to discover that 
they had gone out of fashion by the time that the factory to manufacture them 
had been built.

02 To The Brink of Eternity. 
Focusing on the men of the Cold War on whom 'Dr Strangelove' was based. These 
were people who believed that the world could be controlled by the scientific 
manipulation of fear - mathematical geniuses employed by the American Rand 
Corporation. In the end, their visions were the stuff of science fiction 
fantasy.

03 The League of Gentlemen. 
Thirty years ago, a group of economists managed to convince British politicians 
that they had foolproof technical means to make Britain great again. Pandora's 
Box tells the saga of how their experiments have led the country deeper into 
economic decline, and asks - is their game finally up?

04 Goodbye Mrs Ant. 
A modern fable about science and society, focusing on our attitude to nature. 
Should we let scientists be the prime movers of social or political change when, 
for instance, DDT made post-war heroes of American scientists only to be put on 
trial by other scientists in 1968? What kind of in-fighting goes on between 
rival camps before one scientific truth emerges, and when it does emerge, just 
how true is it?


05 Black Power. 
A look at how former Ghanaian leader Kwame Nkrumah set Africa ablaze with his 
vision of a new industrial and scientific age. At the heart of his dream was to 
be the huge Volta dam, generating enough power to transform West Africa into an 
advanced utopia. But as his grand experiment took shape, it brought with it 
dangerous forces Nkrumah couldn't control, and he slowly watched his metropolis 
of science sink into corruption and debt.

06 A is For Atom.
An insight into the rise and fall of nuclear power. In the 1950s scientists and 
politicians thought they could create a different world with a limitless source 
of nuclear energy. But things began to go wrong. Scientists in America and the 
Soviet Union were duped into building dozens of potentially dangerous plants. 
Then came the disasters of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl which changed views 
on the safeness of this invisible fuel.
