,happy-porcupine,2007-01-30T04:44Z,Someone waited 4 minutes to start complaining.  Is that some kind of TPB record?
,frettub,2007-01-30T04:55Z,"happy-porcupine: yes, its almost as die hard.

Yippy kaye motha fucka, he's melodramatic he's acting just to get attention just because he really wants us to seed more to him than we do already.

Jag seedar för fulla muggar iaf :D"
,Berko,2007-01-30T05:26Z,lol walter_teele... You think there are lots of seeders that soon after the torrent is available?
,frettub,2007-01-30T05:31Z,"Berko: He understand that, but he wants everything on a silver plate!

Sure I like to fileshare but I seed and don't whine about others seeding on a torrent.

You can't just say look he isin't seeding I wont, just bother about yourself, if you seed then then everyone seed and everyone is happy.."
,frettub,2007-01-30T05:34Z,"I've seeded 5 GB now, and my download is still not finished, some have already started watching it.

But the thing is I don't whine I can wait :)"
,mezo86,2007-01-30T05:43Z,"i began downloading wiz 150kb/s now wiz 6kb/s
does any 1 know why"
,VoX1,2007-01-30T06:03Z,"Motherfuckers, seed this shit or don't fucking release it. God damn fuckin niggers runnin this show ? Perhaps mexicans? BOTH releases have 0 - ZERO!!! Seeders!! take it offline for seed the motherfucker. God damn fuckin ignorance prevails!"

Loppan"
,hobbe1337,2007-01-30T06:15Z,"loppan are you fucking retarded or some shit?
if someone upload a torrent with out seeding its fucking stupid
also ""buy the dvd when it comes out"" that pretty much say that you are an fucking idiot

GTFO from tpb"
,frettub,2007-01-30T06:16Z,"lol lol, Vox1 stop swearing show some respect, you get this for free you know."
,frettub,2007-01-30T06:17Z,"hobbe1337: calm down, no need to burst out"
,wormyboi,2007-01-30T06:25Z,yo please seed 
,frettub,2007-01-30T06:28Z,"Seeded 10 GB now and I am on 90%

Some idiots are not seeding, they are getting it on a silver plate and then they turn the seeding off.

Thats not fair.."
,mezo86,2007-01-30T06:34Z,"the other file of prison break have about 33 seeders
here there are only 3
not fair"
,hobbe1337,2007-01-30T06:42Z,took 9min and 55 seconds to dl it from TB
,frettub,2007-01-30T06:47Z,"hobbe1337: then you stopped seeding?

That's gay if you don't because people seed for you then you actually need to seed back.

Not saying that you did because I don't have the logs just advising you to seed afterwards!

While watching the movie you can seed :)"
,happy-porcupine,2007-01-30T07:00Z,"andrew502, thanks for the upload.  It's perfect, and even though it took 2 hours, I say who cares?  All I had to do was click the mouse a few times."
,frettub,2007-01-30T07:39Z,"kdsde: I can't control to which user my seeding goes to, unfortunately there are always such morons nothing you can control :/"
,snufsy,2007-01-30T08:49Z,jag antar att jag får bli den första personen som faktiskt TACKAR för torrenten...bara efter 23 kommentarer:P
,Egghead8888,2007-01-30T09:29Z,"Now im seeding and dont call it bad seeds

,Drugnikko,2007-02-13T02:59Z,"kinda wierd seeing all of you whine about seed. this was the first s02e25 and like 500 people download from one guy, yeah ONE guy only at the start so if he got 5000kb/s up then it will just be 10kb/s each ass. so if you download a ""One-only"" torrent dont whine bout seeds because it's 1 seeded and 500 leechers."
,Drugnikko,2007-02-13T02:59Z,s02e15* sry
,MrJokerMan,2007-04-18T15:07Z,"come on seed ffs !! stuck at 99,7%"
