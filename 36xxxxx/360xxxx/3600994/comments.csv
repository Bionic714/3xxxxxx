This is not unrelated to the torrent, because, if you let the people in power do as they want and cover up the truth behind every criminal act they commit, you won't have any freedom to upload torrents in the near future, nor will you have any freedom to say or do as you want on the internet.

Please wake up and wake other people up too!"

Multinational corporations.

In few words: This torrent is shit. It is very fast shit though (aka diarrhea)."
