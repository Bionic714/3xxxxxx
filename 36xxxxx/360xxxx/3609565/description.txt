This is a fully working FL Studio 6.0.8. The instructions are written by me, and are easy to follow.

I will seed for a week, when my laptop is on, and then from there on I will seed on and off. PLEASE DOWNLOAD AND THEN START SEEDING!!!

The files that are in the zip are:
FL_Studio_6.0.8_Install.exe        >  The installer
FL_Studio_6.0.8_Reg_Key.reg        >  Needed to save files and to make it authentic
FLEngine.dll                       >  Same as above
readme.txt                         >  Installation instructions

Sorry I didn\'t put them directly in the torrent, and zipped them, but you\'re gonna have to deal with it.

I will be uploading some FL Studio samples sometime soon, so check it out once I upload them.

OK. Sorry about the two other torrents. I accidentally zipped the wrong files, so it was completely off.

I am now seeding this torrent for a week, as stated above, but please, please, seed after downloading. Keep this torrent alive.

I don\'t care what you do with these files. Put the torrent on your site, whatever. I went through a lot of searching to get these files, so keep it alive.

Peace.
