,haymarket,2007-01-21T04:45Z,"apparently i dont know how to forward ports to seed! this is my first attempt.  anyways, you can download the dmg from paralells website, and the activation key is 9V07D-KJ94H-PWXE5-RST6I-LDQ40.  maybe someone could create a torrent of just the activation key."
[V],Protooler,2007-01-25T09:47Z,"stuck at 99,3%.... Please seed!"
,scyph,2007-01-25T12:40Z,"Protooler,

Why not just download parallels 3210 from here:
http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/beta_testing/

and use the product activation key shown in the first comment?"
,haymarket,2007-01-26T05:33Z,"lol i dont know how that guy got to 99.3% since i didn't upload a single byte to anyone! i think my isp has blocked the incoming bittorrent ports.  i can seed when i connect to other people but other people can't connect to me (i even made my computer the DMZ so i dont think it's a port issue).  anyways, sorry to tease hundreds of people with this, but if you just read my first comment ......"
,Montaque,2007-01-26T17:29Z,is this for a trial program or the orignal 
,theh0g,2007-01-26T23:28Z,99.3% here also.
,Demento_Chaos,2007-01-27T21:51Z,"I'm stuck at 99.3, just download the trial and use the serial in first post."
[V],Protooler,2007-01-28T00:02Z,"Well, I donÂ´t know how much geek you are, but I know what I do... I checked an I got 37,888 KB downloaded. But anyways; I got the key and get the software from their site. Thanx for the key anyway."

,xcsziv,2007-01-28T22:06Z,download parallels from the website and use the activation key from haymarket at the top. worked for me.
,torgizzi,2007-06-15T01:35Z,Do you know how to install windows xp or vista on a macbook? I have some problems with that.....
,Timolog,2008-01-12T19:15Z,"It doesn't work for me... I have to write the activation key twice. For the first time it works but the second time it doesn't.
First time is to install win. second to activate the product...??"
