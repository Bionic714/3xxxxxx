This was a demonoid torrent I download a while ago that later disappeared from all torrent sites, including demonoid itself.

Given its huge relevance, and the deep consequences of its contents, it is time to give new life to it.
I strongly advice everyone who will download this hot stuff to go on and seed it for a little longer than the usual, because --as always-- this is the sole basic way by which informations like these -- otherwise censored by all MSM and forgotten by the rest of us -- can walk around in the "free" world.

First of all check this two articles from the bbc: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/3755686.stm and the Guardian: http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1327904,00.html.

Then download and watch this three-parts outstanding documentary, and if you want, stop to consider this: there was a time when BBC could, with its better journalists and its classic thorough analyses, simply describe al-qaeda as a non-entity, exaggerated by malicious interests and used as a pretext: it was only two years ago.
The results of such a documentary should have been explosive. But nothing really explodes in the MSM, right? Well, if not their set-up fireworks with their perfect timings-- of course.
That's the information age. But I know of someone who said that the age of information marked the end of the age of knowledge.
