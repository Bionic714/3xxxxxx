The Mixtapes continue into 2007. The first contains some leftovers from 2006, and the the other two contain the best of 2007 so far. Highlights include some wonderful and less weel-known B-sides by Camera Obscura, U2, Bloc Party, Cold War Kids, and Bonnie Prince Billy. New album tracks from Arcade Fire and Bright Eyes. A sterling remix of the new Bloc Party single and a live and exclusive Bowie cover from Of Montreal. Covers from Calexico, Cold War Kids and Aereogramme. And to finish it off is a little bedtime story from Jarvis. Listen and see...
