,gmagnido,2007-03-07T07:29Z,"Ok..
1) Cr0nan, go to hell, you probably tattled in grade school. omg. Are you LOL, too?
2) Marcus066, ""hey! Don't spam in chat, what are u a noob, no an idio t missing brains""...you like bandwagons, don't you? In all fairness, I am a ""noob"", but I'm sure you started out like a seasoned pro. Twit.
3)xXHustlerXx, Thank you for coming to my defense. It actually was stuck, imagine that. Nice to know not all visitors of Pirate Bay are pricks. Keep up the friendliness, I thought that's what this site was all about, anyway.
4) Everybody else, evidently some clarification is needed. My message was only a cry for help, so to speak. I had been stuck at 22.6% for a while, and the capitalized 'NOT' was mearly for emphasis, not to indicate yelling. Please pardon the faux pas, I promise I'll get the hang of this eventually. Thank you and good night."
,gmagnido,2007-03-07T07:36Z,"Oops, sorry EmoStar (really? Emo?), I almost forgot about you. I'm a little mixed on you. First you attempt to reinstigate the Witch Burning, then say you plan on seeding upon completion. Yay seeding, boo Witch Burning. If everyone said, ""DLing now! Seed wn done!"" I probably would never have had to write my original comment. I guess in the end your two comments end up cancelling each other out. Suppose I should just say, ""Good day, sir."""
