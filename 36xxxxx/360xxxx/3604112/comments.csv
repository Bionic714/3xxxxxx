,headmonkey,2007-01-28T15:27Z,"Hi. Capture NX is the most up to date version of the Nikon Capture software so you won't need Capture One if you have this. 
The only other Nikon software I have is Picture Project 1.5. If anyone wants this then I'll be happy to put it up but as you get it free with any Nikon Digital camera there's probably no need. "
,rmegapulse,2007-01-29T07:01Z,Anyone has the Serial # of Nikon's Camera Control Pro?
,Goflorp2,2007-01-30T22:08Z,This progrm is butt ugly!
,headmonkey,2007-02-03T10:32Z,HMMM I must say that I'm quite interested in seeing Capture 1 to compare with Capture NX. I do find NX pretty slow compared with Adobe raw so if Capture 1 is faster then it sounds intriguing.

,thomas_N,2007-08-13T16:54Z,"Only for Mac? I use PC.
Any one have serial for Nikon's Camera Control higher than v 1.1.1 ?
V 1.1.1 doesn't seems to support D80?"
,ekoms,2007-09-18T18:29Z,"can't someone please upload this program for PC

thanks///ekoms"
,zondar5,2007-12-01T17:56Z,"I have the package, but I need the serial could you please post here. FYI people, this program rocks if you use Nikon products. and yes it supports the D80 shot in raw works better if you. According to a nikon rep they are working on a higher version right now."
,rotelman,2008-02-14T20:29Z,"When i enter the serial i got the message that ""the key i invalid"" What did do wrong? "
,vslink,2008-03-06T03:25Z,"Does anyone have any idea where the license information for Capture NX 1.01 is actually recorded in the Mac file system?

I have tried to do a complete uninstall of this software so I can try a trial install of a newer version and avoid conflict with this serial number, but with no luck--the serial number as entered remains on my machine.

I am guessing it is in some hidden file. Any idea how to reveal and delete it?"
