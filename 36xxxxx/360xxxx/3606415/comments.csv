[V],Benson,2007-02-11T11:41Z,Keep calm IÂ´m quite sure that the seed is coming when other torrents is done. Many thanks to the uploader BD_Blues.
,winds,2007-02-13T03:11Z,Stuck at 8.5%
,DMan1979,2007-03-29T10:39Z,"Still stuck at 8,5%, I guess this torrent is dead"
,fruityloop7,2007-04-16T03:40Z,"this really suck - Ive been waiting weeks and it seems like the seeder is on a baaaad modem that works 5 minutes per week

if you are going to offer files this big well then at least have a fast internet connection that people can suck it down

this seeder has massive files and a tiny or non existant internet connection

it would be better if they posted copies to a friend who could help with the upload"
,DMan1979,2007-04-23T10:04Z,"I don't think he is uploading at all at the time. When he started it went quite fast, then he started uploading 1 file by 1, now for almost 2 months everithing stoped."
,brenko,2008-02-09T22:21Z,HI. only 8%? :( 
,edriv3r,2008-03-13T02:29Z,"THERE ARE NO SEEDS AT ALL...:(

Maybe somebody who already downloaded can put this torrent in RAPIDSHARE?
Perhaps uploder...
Please, I really need this kind of information. I guess that I'm not the only one..."
