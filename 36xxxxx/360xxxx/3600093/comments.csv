And who wants to see this sort of stuff."

What next, a video of a hysterectomy (or any other operation) to persuade women to die rather than be operated on."

,aweirdly,2007-01-21T05:34Z,"It's funny how Christians try to re-write history or make up their own laws and science and call it ""facts"".  

No name calling here sir, just telling it like it is.

It's called ""truth"".  Something you try to distort to manipulate others' beliefs."
,Dan__Lirette,2007-01-21T06:20Z,"Odd, because the science used in the film is from the American Psychiatric Association :-)

Second, is showing an abortion in progress ""re writing history"" or is it correcting falsified history?

,Dan__Lirette,2007-01-21T06:22Z,"haha opps! The American Psychiatric reference was meant for the ""Hope For The Homosexual"" torrent I have online here at TPB.

As fo rthe footage of an abortion in progress.....download it and watch it and THEN post your FACTS..not opinions :-)

facts drive mankind...not unsubstantiated fictional opinions."
,DrYes,2007-01-21T08:09Z,"> facts drive mankind...not unsubstantiated fictional opinions.

Exactly, so drop your fictional story book, the bible, and join the rest of us in the 21st century where facts prevail."

,made-of-technetium,2007-01-21T21:40Z,"Another way of looking at it is that during the 9 months of pregnancy the fetus is nothing more than a parasite living of it's host & in a constant battle with the hosts immune system.
Sometimes the immune system wins resulting in a miscarriage & sometimes the fetus wins resulting in a baby.
In conclusion then, by right the host should be able to have the parasite removed at any point during the pregnancy. If however it is removed at a point were it is capable of survival outside the hosts body then maybe it should the be given the right to life at that point (but that is a different argument I won't touch on right now)"
,Dan__Lirette,2007-01-22T05:46Z,"made-of-technetium, you've successfully just called yourself a parasite.

Before you press ""Submit"" you should re-read your post next time.

May God Himself transform your life.

In Jesus' Name, Amen!

Just remember, God is dead, And no one cares, If there is a hell?, I'll see you there."

Thank God that He will ultimately judge all murderers and infanticide supporters alike. Have sex as much as you want, get pregnant, then just pull out the baby and toss it away like trash. I wish all infanticide supporters were themselves aborted! You have absolutely no argument at all. Abortion IS murder."
