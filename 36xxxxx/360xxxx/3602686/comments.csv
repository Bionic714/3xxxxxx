,SeenII,2007-01-27T19:38Z,"You are doing a hell of a good job
Thanks a lot for the mixes...
I was wondering... Do you have some of 1984-1985. This was a great time, with Les Adams and Sanny-X. I got them on very bad tapes, so maybe you have them in better quality......?"
,newtorrentsdude,2007-01-29T06:45Z,"I also have to add my thanks for these awesome mixes, and also add a request for any late 80s vinyl you may have.
I was a member 1987-1990 if memory serves, but my vinyl records are at my parents' place (I live on a different continent now) and I'd love to listen to them again."
