,FFSMNRK,2008-10-27T10:21Z,"Thanks for the upload! (My copy has been blessed with only 2 defects in the main film but I think it adds to my favoured surreal experience.)

Do you have the R2 Medusa copy of Tenebre? If so, can you upload it?"
,zezinho33,2009-04-14T04:04Z,Does it have the audio in italian without the directorÂ´s comentary?
,golliwogg420,2009-12-01T08:56Z,please seed!!!
,golliwogg420,2009-12-01T17:34Z,someone come on... I'm stuck on 99.9%!
,golliwogg420,2009-12-01T18:13Z,"disregard the last message.. it works all right without 100%.. 

@zezinho33, I think this is the original release. It looks as if it was done in English. The commentary is Italian most likely because he can't speak English and/or it being an Italian-made film.  "
