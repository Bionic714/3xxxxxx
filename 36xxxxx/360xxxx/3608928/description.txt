Release Notes:

Tracey Thorn's artistic rebirth is eminent.
Following her filial hiatus, she's finally releasing
an album of her own called Out Of The Woods
(released in the US March 20th through Astralwerks
and the UK in February via Virgin). And instead of
repeating Everything But the Girl records with her
husband Ben Watt, she's branching out and working
with other artists including Metro Area, The Rapture
and electro-house power-producer Ewan Pearson. It
will be her first solo release since A Distant Shore
in 1982.

"I've got together with a few different
producers/collaborators, and we've come up with a
record that (I hope) is a true reflection of who I
am right now and what I love right now," said Thorn.
