A lot of people have asked for a downgrader for v2.80 that's both safe and simple to use.

Why should you use this downgrader? Well, the major advantages are:

* SAFETY - This downgrader has plenty of safety checks in place to try to avoid accidental bricks (but remember the previous warning)

* CONVENIENCE - Because this downgrader works with an official firmware EBOOT.PBP file (included), and includes the TA-082 idstorage changer and HEN files. You don't need any other files to perform the downgrade. No more finding a v1.5 owner to get dumpfiles!

* Latest TA-082/086 support - The bundled TA-082 registry fixer includes the latest fixes to make sure that USBHost support won't be messed up.

* Also works for the old motherboard versions TA-079 and TA-081.


This full pack includes:

- HEN D for 2.80
- Rotating Cube Sample
- TA-079 / TA-081 / TA-082 / TA-086 Generic Downgrader
- HW Ident v0.031
- TA082 IdStorage Changer
- Official SONY 1.50 Update File

NOTES:

* This pack CAN downgrade PSPs with the following motherboards TA-079, TA-081, TA-082 and TA-086. Therefore this Downgrader will work for ANY motherboards, as long as the installed firmware is not higher than 2.80.
