,seej,2007-05-21T21:41Z,"The uploader hasn't made any mistake - it's just Adobe's confusing version numbering system. CS = Creative Suite, which contains InDesign 3.0, Photoshop 8, etc. The latest Creative Suite is CS3, which contains InDesign 5.0 and Photoshop 10, etc."
,toyotomi,2007-06-27T23:50Z,"Anyone know if/when Paradox is going to do the rest of CS3?

Still using Paradox's Photoshop CS2 (v9) atm."
