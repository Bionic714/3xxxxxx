,flipuuuu,2007-02-03T10:43Z,"Well at first who the fuck uses .zip anymore? It refused to extract the files with winrar so I had to use this own windows zip archive piece of shit -unpacker.

After the game was installed I came here and used that CD-key and it worked. But then the game kept on falling everytime. So I downloaded new drivers for my videocard and wow it worked. 

2400XP+, Radeon 9700 pro, 1G DDR - ALL the details must be on LOW and I cannot use antialising at all. I got to play it with 1024x768 resolution and still it does keeps jamming and when there's lot of smoke its desastorous. 

And now there is that expiratin day. :D

make a restorepoint in your windows before you do the install - after that change the date to 26 Jan

than install the beta-client with the key that is postet here before in another comment ( the key works ) than make a second restore point after the install that you can go back if time is running out

after install start the game with date 26th Jan and the beta-client will work - you can still play and test it in offline mode / online mode didnt work anymore cause the beta is closed and there are no servers for beta anymore

go back with the restore points or turnback the clock after playing is also working to stay in the timeline between the 26th Jan and 04th Febr where the beta was on

thats how i installed it and it works fine / its realy nice to play with ...


btw... for all that didnt noticed it

,vincent@vega,2007-02-07T18:11Z,i think you need a fresh windows with a virgin registry / if you installed it before and it expired than it may not work anymore and a new install doesent do it cause of the f....d up registry entrys / i think its like the tryout media games that you can only install one time when there is a clean registry you cannot install them second time when the registry has entries / heard that someone had the same problems with the client he didnt installed it under the right date and tryed to change after the install that dont work / he made an uninstall and had the uninstaller bug that killed his windows partition / so he had to do a fresh windows install with clean registry and tadaaa how wonder it worked after a new try / maybe its also where you downloaded the client from / i have the open beta client which is dated 26.Jan / if your download it from another source maybe the date isnt the right one i dont know / try on other pc where it wasent installed before maybe that work / i only install it once this morning and it worked for me ...
,vemar2007,2007-02-07T20:14Z,"thats a shame, fresh install seems a bit extreme for a beta version.  CCleanerwiped most of the reg files, and cant find any reg files relating to Atari or TDU in the registry that CCleaner didnt take out.

Hey guys. Works perfectly. Thanx Vincent Vega, you rule:)"
,Skidmarx,2007-02-09T14:14Z,"To install and play this game (in offline mode at least) after February 4th (when open beta ended), I set the date in Windows to January 26th 2007, RESTARTED, then installed. During installation I disabled internet connection (whether you need to or not I'm not sure... but this is what worked for me) and left the internet connection off and started the game... worked fine. When I had changed the date and didn't restart it gave me ""License has expired"" message and quit. I would guess the date must be set to before February 4th to play... and would probably disconnect internet too... but whether or not that is required I'm not sure. I'm assuming if you want to play online you'll have to wait until the game is out (now March 20th I believe.)

Also a good idea to create a restore point before installing.

FYI... the performance and accuracy of Oahu is a little disappointing (to me at least since I live on Oahu)... don't rely too much on the signs or you'll never find anything."
,vincent@vega,2007-02-09T16:25Z,"... internet connection after install is no problem and you can also play when your internet is connected that do nothing to the beta...

you will not be able to paly online even when the game is out ! this is a beta client and this version will not match witch the one of the released game that is done on other servers

but for testing the look and feel its verry good
and i think its allmost complete ..."
,vincent@vega,2007-02-09T16:34Z,i installed the TDU patch for the beta and updated to version 3.65 you only have to set ignore errors and date and say yes to all damn popups when install / works fine also ...

,Skidmarx,2007-02-10T00:09Z,"If you've already tried installing the game without setting the date back and restarting first, you probably need to do a system restore rather than just uninstalling the game. Once you restore back to a point prior than your first installation attempt, set the date in windows back (ex. Jan 26th), restart, then install again. Then keeping the date on the 26th, start the game. 

Also, you probably want to make sure the Internet Time feature is disabled... its the third tab in the window where you change the date/time."
,vincent@vega,2007-02-10T04:45Z,"here is how to update the beta !

get the 2 files ' patchw.dll ' and the ' TDUupdate3.65.exe ' from the 11.5 MB ( TDU_patch.rar ) that you have to download / put the 2 files in your test drive beta folder and klick on the exe file / than there is a popup if you would like to update from 3.44 to 3.65 / klick ok and klick ok another time / on the next popup is an change options / klick on that and mark = error file - ignore missing - path search - subdir search - time zone ignore = leave all other unmarked and klick ok / than klick on yes and start the upgrade to 3.65 / ignore all popup messages for time or missing files that occure / allways hit on enter till the update is done / you have to do this many times but at the end it will say its upgradet to 3.65 / after that delete the 2 update files and the new *.err file from the folder / they dont be needed anymore !

thats it your done ..."

,LOLness,2007-02-10T10:58Z,"Yeah, same here. Have done everything listed here and it still doesn't work. I've read elsewhere though that the license period can be extended by editing something in the registry? Anyone know how to do that?"

,Doriss,2007-02-10T15:43Z,So u dont Know how to make it work then?
,vincent@vega,2007-02-10T16:08Z,"did you read all post on this tread carefully ? i think no ... i know how it works

the thing works if you install it the right way as mentioned before in my other posts / if you played the beta and let the beta expire it will not work anymore and even a new install will not fix it cause you registry is not clean anymore / i dont know how to fix the registy entrys for expird beta-clients / the only thing i know is that it will work another time when you make a fresh windows install on a fresh partition / dont let it expire than you have big problems thats fact !

also for some the key works for some not / same with the install and the update or key / my description of the install metod, update and the key is for the beta-client downloaded from here dated ( 26 Januar 2007 ) and that works / not for the one you have download from other sources or ATARI direct / that may be another key or another timeline / i dont know

all this you can read here before - why does no one read all the posts ... pffff"
,LOLness,2007-02-10T16:17Z,"I did read them. That's why I am asking around for a method of EXTENDING the trial period (because I installed the game outside 4th Feb) via registry. This question isn't aimed at you specifically (because you said you don't know, that's fine then).

But does anyone else know how to fix the trial period?"
,vincent@vega,2007-02-10T16:26Z,i play with the beta-client for 4 days now and put the clock back after every play to stay on 26.Januar in the timeline and it work realy good / got no expire-messages or warnings and the beta is running fine without any problems ...
,LOLness,2007-02-10T16:31Z,"Yeah... I believe that too. Problem is, I I made my installation after 4th Feb, so I am pretty fucked (and reformatting the PC just for the sake of trying out a beta game is a bit extreme imo)."
,LOLness,2007-02-10T16:32Z,"In fact, have you got any suggestions on registry cleaning software that would solve this problem?"
,rstanley,2007-02-10T20:15Z,so you have to actually have to set the date back before you install? I was under the impression that you only had to do that each time you played
,rstanley,2007-02-10T21:11Z,is it also necessary to create a restore point or will it work without creating one?
,squishsquash,2007-02-10T21:51Z,"I found this but not sure if its a bullshit site or any of it works?? i had a go but it looks like you have to register :http://www.ddlsite.com/test+drive+unlimited/crack-serial-keygen-torrent/free-warez-full-download-1.html,

,LOLness,2007-02-10T21:52Z,"I just tried this game on a friend's laptop, and it works. You do need to set the date to Jan 26th, restart and install. Just in case, disconnect the LAN cable and uncheck the sync with Internet time check box when you change the date."

,LOLness,2007-02-11T00:16Z,"Heh. Yeah, that's about it. I am in the same boat too...

I'll probably wait till a crack appears."
,rstanley,2007-02-11T00:42Z,there's got to be a way to clean the registry w/out having to reinstall
,vincent@vega,2007-02-11T01:54Z,... i dont think that anyone make a crack for an expired beta cause it works when you install it right / also the release for the game is 02 März 2007 so if you didnt want to make your windows new you have to wait for the full release / to restore a windows partition is about 3 min when you got an image / next time make a backup image of your windows partition than you can flash it over without any probs in short amount of time ...
,rstanley,2007-02-11T04:21Z,so you can't fix the registry by doing a system restore?
,vincent@vega,2007-02-11T04:58Z,... yeah that fix it
,vincent@vega,2007-02-11T05:11Z,... do a clean fresh windows install on a clean partition / make a restorepoint / set date back to 26 Jan / restart / install the beta-client / make another restorepoint after the install / turn off the windows time auto updater / go and play the beta / after every play turn back the clock to stay on the 26 Jan and the beta will not expire anymore ...
,rstanley,2007-02-11T05:56Z,"do I have to install a new windows, or can I just run system restore?"
,LOLness,2007-02-11T08:28Z,"If you have a restore point before Jan 26th, use it"
,LOLness,2007-02-11T08:29Z,"THank god my friend lent me his laptop, now I can play TDU ^^"" (need to get $1M for that McLaren F1... wanting that car so badly...)"
,rstanley,2007-02-11T11:19Z,"Finally I got it to work-- & I really don't know what the hype is about.  Anyone else who is thinking about going through all this trouble  to play the game- don't, it's not worth it.  This game is no better than NFS: Carbon.  The graphics may be shiny but the driving physics are crappy & unrealistic- for some reason I was thinking this game would have more realistic driving than NFS."
,squishsquash,2007-02-11T13:30Z,"The NFS game has terrible cars that handle like a wheel barrow and sound like someone blowing a dented horn, i have tried many car games over the years and to be honest the sounds and handling of these cars is pretty near the mark in TDU, its a shame that we didnt get a 30 day trial maybe if atari is watching they might think of doing so next time."

,LOLness,2007-02-13T20:04Z,You type in the CD key after you finished installing and run the game for the first time...
,Dezeo1,2007-02-13T20:44Z,but I have done all that things you told me to do but I have to change the time anyway when I start the game.
,LOLness,2007-02-13T20:49Z,"1. Disconnect From Internet.
2. Change date to Jan 26th.
3. Uncheck ""Automatically Synchronize with an Internet time server"".
4. Restart computer.
5. Install game (just click on Autorun.exe).

And you are done. When you start the game for the first time, it'll tell you input the CD-key there.

Make sure your computer date is set to Jan 26th to Feb 4th when you run the game."
,StuFF_2001,2007-02-14T20:06Z,"I reinstalled Windows and set the date to january 1st. and im still playing. even reached the expert level. :)
Really love this game, but the sound really sucks!!
its good on low rpm, but at high rpm's it sound like shit! aspecially the musclecars. but still gonna buy this when it's released! :)

and excuse the poor English, im Norwegian. ;)"
,FOUDASSE,2007-02-15T03:06Z,please seed :D
,Dezeo1,2007-02-15T14:36Z,so if I have tried to install it once I can't install it a second time even if I never wrote the cd-key??
,newmail,2007-02-15T16:17Z,"Does anybody know, how to go online at this time with the open beta?

It's still working (it's very easy to remove the SecuROM7 protection, which prevents reinstall and also date setting back not works) and patched to 3.65.
If I'm going up with the online profile, the game says new version available to download, and opens up a browser which jumps to the TDU official page. But there are no any downloads of course.
Question2: does anybody know, how to prevent those big stops in the game? Patch does not solve this problem. HDD defragmanted, system is 3G HT P4, 1G dualchannel DDR, Ati X1950pro."
,vincent@vega,2007-02-15T17:17Z,... there are no servers anymore to get online with the beta / the beta is over and therefore also no downloads for it / the 3.65 patch is the only thing you can get / there are still some glitches with sound and graphics in the beta even if you patched it / try the millionärs race 200 km around the island / got me 1.000.000 of money and took about 45 min on a tuned katana bike / i love this game it is realy cool ...

,LOLness,2007-02-15T17:44Z,"Oh, and will the beta save file be compatible with the actual game itself when it's released? cos there's no point in playing a lot if I have to do the races again when the real game comes out..."

,rayzorz,2007-02-15T21:42Z,how can i remove SecuROM7 protection?
,newmail,2007-02-15T21:59Z,"rayrorz:
Search for regdelnull.exe. Goggle is ur friend.
execute the following command:
regdelnull.exe HKU -s
answer Y to the question.
Then delete SecuROM registry entry from: HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-854245398-963894560-839522115-1003\Software\SecuROM

Then search for UNLOCKER, google is your friend again.
With unlocker, You could delete the Documents and Settings\\Application Data\SecuROM folder and all its entries.

Then set date back to 2007 february 1 from windows and restart the complete system.
Reinstall the game.

Create tdu.bat (rename TestDriveUnlimited.exe to TDU.EXE), w/following contents (without quotes):
""
date /t > c:\date.txt
date 2007. 02. 01.
call TDU.EXE
pause
date < c:\date.txt
del c:\date.txt
""

This batch file should keep the game always running on the day You installed it, so it never expires. You always have 3 days left. Only pay attention to the time (if the date turns into february 2 at any times, ten You have to modify the contents of the batch file to February 2. Or even delete Securom again:) to let the game working again).

For users, who experiencing file lost from root of system folder:

Execute the autorun commmand from the image file of the game. It should start normal installation process, but if the game is installed, it could remove it without this bug!
Never start uninstallation from ADD OR REMOVE PROGRAMS."
,LOLness,2007-02-15T22:03Z,"newmail I've been waiting for your help =D... thanx, now I can FINALLY play on my own comp instead of my friend's laptop..."
,LOLness,2007-02-16T00:17Z,"Awesome stuff indeed. I can confirm that newmail's method works, although there was a slight problem with date (in the batch file, the date format was YYMMDD but on my computer, the date needs to be MMDDYY, but that's easily fixed by typing in 020107)"
,vincent@vega,2007-02-16T01:50Z,"@LOLness

ATARI say NO ! / beta saves will not be compatible with the full game - the chance for new players that couldnt play the beta and  players who played the beta should be the same when the game will be released finaly / you have to do all over again ..."
,LOLness,2007-02-16T06:45Z,"That's a shame indeed, but it makes sense. Oh well, that means I shouldn't put so much time into it."

I get configdata corrupt when launching windows installer. Is there any way to fix this?

Or I just wait and hope the full game will work."
,newmail,2007-02-16T13:48Z,"rayzorz: maybe ur windoz install corrupted for some reason. I had never any errors like this. I had only the root file removal bug, but I posted a solution for it. Maybe try to reinstall ur os, or download a never version of windows installer. Run AUTORUN.EXE from image file, no any others.
I don't know about this release of open beta, the version I hv works without any install problems."
,newmail,2007-02-16T13:59Z,"About the game:

-It seems to be, that the game works fine, if the config has fast CPU, at least 768Mb RAM, nVidia 7600GST (overclocked at 600/1400) or Ati X1650XT.
I found that this config is minimal for all eye candy on (including HDR, but without AA of course) at 1280x960 or 1280x1024 resolution.
A CeleronD 2.6 is not enough for smooth playing even if the config has Ati x1900xtx. If we changed the CPU to Pentium4 2.8GHz, it runs more smooth, but only at 1024x768 resolution.
With an athlon64 3200+ (@2.4GHz), the game runs fine with nv 7600GST.

-HDR looks too bright on nv cards. With ATI it's just fine.

-Patching to 3.65 helps a lot.

-Defragmenting the HDD make the game runs smoother."

I think the key was to have an offline game started... if you didn't have one... you can't play... if you did... when the game can't connect to the server it will default to the offline game.

There is a date issue... it has been February 4 at my house now for several weeks... kinda like groundhog day.

Had to cut all internet traffic, so the computer didn't try to reset the time, turn off the virus protection...to keep it from screaming about the incorrect date... and then set the date for February 4...

Start the game get the message... license expires in 0 days but it will start... if it doesn't try setting the date to Feb. 3, retry... still won't start reset it to Feb. 4.

But if you didn't start an offline personna before the servers went down... you are out of luck...

,IIMEII,2007-02-23T15:15Z,"nice step by step yeem ....but i checked and i dont have ""C:\Documents and Settings\%Username%\Applicationdata\SecuROM"" ....whats that mean ? that maybe i deleted that when i used this      awesomeguy at 2007-02-15 22:59 CET: ?"
,newmail,2007-02-23T18:46Z,"Yes, creating another windows user AND keep date on february 1 is still works. Because SecuROM protection is per user and not per system. My method works if that user installed TDU, but it's expired or it says date invalid blabla..."
,Mervious,2007-02-23T23:42Z,God damn IIMEII you are a noob with computers. newmails method works perfectly.
,vincent@vega,2007-02-24T00:01Z,... thats the point !!! the tips working perfectly if you do it right ...
,IIMEII,2007-02-24T01:28Z,i didnot say it dosent work ....i said what i did with user name is a lot easier and a ot shorter ....... with his methods i weasted like 12 hours on the pc with no results ...... maybe for others worked but for me not..... for me worked when i created other user name and intalled it then .
,Mervious,2007-02-24T11:44Z,"I just found out that you don't have to reinstall the game. All you have to do is to delete securom and set the date to 1st february and restart your computer.

execute the following command:

regdelnull.exe HKU -s

answer Y to the question.

Then delete SecuROM registry entry from: HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-854245398-963894560-839522115-1003\Software\SecuROM

Then search for UNLOCKER, google is your friend again.

With unlocker, You could delete the Documents and Settings\\Application Data\SecuROM folder and all its entries.

Then set date back to 2007 february 1 from windows and restart the complete system.

Doing that the game works fine with me."
,Mervious,2007-02-24T11:46Z,And that takes less than 5min to complete.
,newmail,2007-02-24T11:51Z,"Yeah! If the game says expired or date invalid, just set date back to febr 1, restart system, delete SecuROM and game works fine again.
