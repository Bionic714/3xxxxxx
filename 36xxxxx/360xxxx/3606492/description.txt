Many professionals are familiar with the problem; quality loss caused by digital image magnification. In many cases a great deal of time is spent on achieving only a fairly acceptable enlargement result, however there are familiar side effects including out-of-focus images and serrated edges which is illustrative for the lack of professional magnification software.
PhotoZoom Pro? 2 is based on S-Spline XL: a renewed and improved version of our patented, self-adjusting, many times awarded S-Spline interpolation technology. As we did with S-Spline, our S-Spline XL technology again introduces a revolutionary breakthrough in digital image enlargement. It is able to render sharp and crisp clear image magnifications, perfectly focused, yet without the jagged edges, loss of detail or lack of photorealism that normally come with enlarging images.
The software is perfectly suited for digital photography, large printing, DTP, web design and online publishing, but also for industrial image processing such as space technology, security, medical and forensic applications.
Featuring: 
New S-Spline XL interpolation algorithm!
Improved, powerful yet very easy to use interface
Advanced fine-tuning tools for even better enlargement results
Batch conversion
Extensive support for high-end image formats (such as 48 & 64 bit images)
Works as standalone application as well as Adobe Photoshop compatible plugin
