,bcafs7,2007-07-06T21:16Z,"The no cd crack & install doesn't work, so here's how I got it to work:

Mount ""Age of Empires II.toast"" and copy everything in the Age of Empires II folder to wherever you want it to be. Then burn that ""Age of Empires II"" to a cd (I used toast: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3731014/Toast_Titanium_8.0.1.137_(UB)_%5BRETAIL%5D___Serial) and use it to play."

,jakkop,2007-11-30T19:15Z,"Great No-Cd crack, when you after all need a cd anyways."
,El_Frillo,2007-12-30T05:14Z,"NO CD CRACK INFO:

I am on 10.4.11 and the crack works just fine:

1. Rename the Age of Empires II no cd.smi file to Age of Empires II no cd.dmg
2. Unmount the install image file
3. Mount the NO-CD .dmg file
4. Play
5. Next time - be creative before whining. (Think Different - you know?) This took me 1 minute to figure out playing around.. :P"
,Xa2TheV,2007-12-31T22:21Z,"Help! I can't even open the app..it tells me this:

Drawsprocket cannot switch to the requested resolution (640x480, 16 bit, 1 buffer(s)). Make sure your computer meets the display requirements specified in the Read Me file.


however, i have a new macbook, so why shouldnt i be able to have a 640x480 resolution? (i've tried switching it myself but it wont work either). is leopard the problem (I'm running on it)?"
,mredpopo,2008-01-02T07:55Z,"i am having the same problem as Xa2TheV

it gives the resolution message and then shuts down

im a new mac user so i am kinda lost"
,threepointstar,2008-01-17T00:36Z,"yea, is there a way to run it on Leopard? 
because i can run it on OSX 10.4.11 but not on Leopard, because of that resolution issue."
,d42k.kn16h7,2008-01-21T21:12Z,Xa2TheV and mredpopo - hold down on the command key when you open the Age of Empires II application.  This will bring up the preferences for the game - set the colors to 256 colors instead of 16-bit and then disable the intro movies.  This will allow you to play the game on your MacBook.
,axeldagreat,2008-02-16T15:33Z,"Does this work on leopard?

PLEASE SEED!"
,esbekken,2008-02-21T07:05Z,"SEED, SEED, SEED, SEED, SEED, SEED, SEED"
,threepointstar,2008-03-05T19:48Z,"it works on Leopard if you do as ""d42k.kn16h7"" explained. just disable de 'intro movies'.

problem:

Playing on network with a Leopard and OSX may be a problem due to ""sync"" errors. So if anyone can find a patch for this problem on Leopard i would appreciate it if you tell me :)"
,sparrowhawk13,2008-03-11T05:45Z,"It does NOT work on Leopard for me.  Tried d42k.kn16h7's fix, but now I get the error ""Drawsprocket cannot switch to the requested resolution (800x600, 8 bit, 1 buffer(s)). Make sure your computer meets the display requirements specified in the Read Me file.""

Help!"
,kluczka,2008-03-22T14:39Z,"I have 10.5.2 and it's not possible to run aoe because of @Xa2TheV problem.
You can not change the depth of colour (it's just not clickable) in the game setup and in the system preferences too. Maybe someone know how to fix that?"
,mpetter,2008-03-29T23:21Z,"It work's for me on Leopard (10.5.2), i just mount the Age of Empires II.dmg file, copy the Age Of Empires II folder to my applications folder, rename the Age of Empires II no cd.smi to Age of Empires II no cd.dmg and mount the Age of Empires II no cd.dmg to run the game.
My mac has the 640x480 resolution."
,BoxMeUp,2008-05-24T18:54Z,"can i get someone to seed this torrent, thanks."
,VileCore,2008-06-04T18:21Z,"Can you believe I downloaded it and could hear the music but not the sound effects, including voices and whatnot? So I erased it and re-downloaded it, and had the same problem? So I deleted it one more time and looked behind my speakers for my C&C Generals disc and noticed a wire wasn't inserted properly. Idiot Of The Year goes to.... Me!"
,hauptmann777,2008-06-10T15:52Z,Can someone seed this please? Thank you.
,smitty4478,2010-05-04T03:21Z,"Worked perfect for me and downloaded fast! THANKS! btw does anybody know where I can find a ""no cd crack""?"
