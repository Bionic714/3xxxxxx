STRÖM (electronica program in Swedish Radio SR P2 with Håkan Lidbo, Andreas Tilliander, Mats Almegård).

All 10 episodes from the initial 2006 series, including web pages with playlists.

Note: These files are mostly recorded from FM stereo radio, not from the low-quality webstream! This kind of electronica is often quite heavily distorted in webstreams, so choose these recordings instead.

Encoded in OGG Vorbis for high quality per size.

Enjoy! :-)
