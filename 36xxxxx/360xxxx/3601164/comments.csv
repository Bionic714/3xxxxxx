,philtration,2007-01-22T10:13Z,It appears that the file is corrupt for the files when I attempt to uncompress with WinRAR. Not sure why.  Thanks for uploading though.

,eriksson-,2007-01-22T15:40Z,"Amature, Rar is the way all files are released. "
,MrPetteroes,2007-01-22T15:44Z,"lmao ericsson! There is no problem uploading a file without have it packed.. Comin from another source, unpack-upload. how dumb r u"
,eriksson-,2007-01-22T15:51Z,I didn't say there was no problem but me and many other people don't want them unpacked and filthy. Theres no point in unpacking and changing the name of a file. thats just my opinion.
