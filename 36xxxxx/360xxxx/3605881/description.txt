Here is Sling Blade, another hidden gem of a movie that EVERYONE should see. This movie came out of nowhere, was not in wide release, and disappeared almost as quickly as it came out. This is truly an amazing film, and I don't want to give any spoilers away. Billy Bob Thornton, Dwight Yoakum, John Ritter, Robert DuVal all SHINE in this beautifully made film. The true gem in this film is Billy Bob Thornton. He wrote it, directed it, and starred in it, turning in a truly magnificent performance. One cannot watch this movie without being moved. I don't know if this was ever released in Europe, so our Scandinavian brothers and sisters will really find this to be a real treat.

My Rating: 8/10
