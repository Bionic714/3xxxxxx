,NeitherSparky,2008-02-12T00:24Z,"Downloading it now and I promise to seed.  I do plan to buy the DVD when I can afford it but I'd like to have  this in the meantime. I saw this film for the first time late last night thanks to my TiVo, and I was positively stunned by it. I agree with you: EVERYONE should see this movie."
,textilewhiz,2008-03-03T18:00Z,"Just a great film. Not to mention (as no one has yet) Danial Lanois did the soundtrack. Really great stuff. Thanks again, i'll be seeding this one for a while!"
,magnusKnorge,2008-04-22T09:26Z,are there any subs?
,pflagger,2008-07-19T05:45Z,"No subs.
The video quality on this DVD is pretty poor. Looks to be home made."
