THE TORRENT HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY OF DEVIL DOLL'S RECORDS ON THE INTERNET AT THIS TIME. ALSO IT CONTAIN ALL ALBUMARTWORK, COVERS, ADDITIONAL BAND PHOTOS AND BAND INFO.

This torrent contain one of the most beautiful, strange, well performed, moody, scary and interesting pieces of art that you very likely ever will hear. I know this sound a little bit over the edge, but the truth is that the beauty and strangeness of Devil Doll really cant be described, it sounds like a clich√© to say it, but its really true, it must be heard firsthand. If you never heard them, listen to their last album "Dies Irae" that they recorded with the Slovenian Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra and wet your pants... All of the albums just contains one long song (except "Eliogabalus" that contain two) and it is more like to experience a movie or a theatrical performance than anything else. It is no coincidence that the anonymous mastermind behind Devil Doll is known as "The David Lynch of music"

If you are into Classical, Theatrical, Gothic, Avantgarde, Symphonic Rock Music, Progressive Rock, Moviemusic, Darkwave, Pink Floyd, Bowie, Death Metal, Black Metal or none of the above is not the point, Devil Doll is in certain aspects above and beyond that.

What about the band then? Well, Devil Doll has been around for 20 years and the person behind it is someone who's identity has been hidden for all those years. He calls himself Mr.Doctor and is writing the music, making the graphical art,  and also playing the piano to some extent, but one thing that will make you remember him forever is probably because of his insane, unique weird way of singing.

This is the albums:
    * The Girl Who Was ... Death (1989)
    * Eliogabalus (1990)
    * Sacrilegium (1992)
    * The Sacrilege of Fatal Arms (1993)
    * Dies Irae (1996)
    
The only one missing is "The Mark of the Beast (1988)" and that is normal because only one copy was pressed and the only one that have it is Mr.Doctor. Not even the other people performing on it has the material.
