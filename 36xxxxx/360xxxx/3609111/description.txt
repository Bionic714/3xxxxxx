Show number 38 and the theme for this week is Luck.
Hmm..a subject we are all familiar with no doubt.
Usual quality, 320 VBR stereo MP3.
I have just this weeks show to post and then I am back up to date finally!
Thats why no playlists or anything, I have so many shows to get up here to catch up...tracklist can be found usually at

Enjoy the show!
