The most important of which is putting ""FS2004"" and/or ""FSX"" at the beginning of the description. If it's for FSX, put that. If it's for FS2004, put that. If it's for both, put both. If it's for X-Plane, put ""X-Plane"". Get it? That way people can find what they're looking for by using the search function."
