LiME's version didnt sync at all the last part so here's a PROPER one.

Based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, The Painted Veil 
is a love story set in the 1920s that tells the story of a 
young English couple, Walter (Edward Norton), a middle 
class doctor and Kitty (Naomi Watts), an upper-class woman, 
who get married for the wrong reasons and relocate to Shanghai, 
where she falls in love with someone else. When he uncovers 
her infidelity, in an act of vengeance, he accepts a job in 
a remote village in China ravaged by a deadly epidemic, and 
takes her along. Their journey brings meaning to their 
relationship and gives them purpose in one of the most remote 
and beautiful places on earth.
