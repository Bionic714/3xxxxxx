This is a complete ISO of Rogue Galaxy as a DVD9 as released retail in North America.

NTSC
4.76 GB RAR Format
6.96 GB ISO Format

Released due to complications involved with freezing at Chapter 7 of the game when dummy files are removed from the ISO.

I do have a very limited upload rate, so please be patient, I expect it to take a couple days until a few complete sets get out there.

If you also own the game, or can rent it or whatever and would like to help me seed, that would be much appreciated. I extracted the ISO along with a MDF file using DVD Decrypter, then compressed it using Winrar with 50mb library size on Best compression setting. The name of the rar file is Rogue_Galaxy_Complete_ISO...again, if you know how to set it up so you can create your own rar of the iso and seed this with me without the need to download it, it would be much appreciated.

This has not been tested beyond chapter 7 as of yet, but the file does load up using SM3.6 when burned onto a DVD9
