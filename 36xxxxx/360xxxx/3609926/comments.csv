,kenji210,2007-02-04T02:46Z,"I hope that you are going to seed again, soon. 
:/
thx anyway"
,indierockerseattle,2007-02-04T03:39Z,"im always seeding, I just have a horrible upload speed"
,weepingtree,2007-02-04T03:50Z,"what does it entail that this is a dvd9.rar?do i need a special disc to burn it on?i use imgburner usually.will this work with a normal dvdr(4.7 gb)disc?
snah"
,kenji210,2007-02-04T03:51Z,You are? Strange .. I couldnt see anyone that has is completely up till now and even now I cant connect to you. What bittorrent are you using? Azureus?
,kenji210,2007-02-04T03:54Z,"@weep I dont now if you can use imageburner, but I know you can do it with Nero. For this version you will have to burn a double layer, but you can try to make a DVD5 of it with this tutorial, too. Still .. Im not sure if it works.

,Binighted,2007-02-04T04:21Z,"How is that this works with swap magic? swap magic doesnt support Dual Layer discs,care to elaborate indie? did you actually tested it in a dual layer with swap magic?"
,lavers,2007-02-04T06:05Z,Thanks indie
,indierockerseattle,2007-02-04T06:44Z,"no binighted i got my discs mixed up, it was the DVD5 i had that i loaded up


and kenji, ripping it wont work, thats what the protocol release was, somehow the disc is hiding files on the disc and they are not recognized by windows or the ripping tools."
,indierockerseattle,2007-02-04T06:45Z,"to further elaborate on the above....even when I have the actual disc in my drive, it still only shows up as 3.14 GB, but when the run through DVD Decrypter, the made ISO file is 6+ GB, so they have found a way to hide some of the files on the disc"
,Binighted,2007-02-04T09:57Z,"mmmm really interesting,lets see who cracks this first :D"
,Musharraf,2007-02-04T10:36Z,"""but the file does load up using SM3.6 when burned onto a DVD9""

CAN ANYBODY CONFIRM THIS?"
,kenji210,2007-02-04T11:27Z,"Mh ... I hope I can burn it on a dual layer disc then without problems, because I dont know really much about ripping.

Still 3,8 gb to go :("
,xandizitxu,2007-02-04T23:35Z,"Thank you a lot!!!! I realy want to play this game, only see videos and looks much fun!"
,indierockerseattle,2007-02-06T11:20Z,"sorry this is taking so long....part of it is my upload speed, but most of it is because uTorrent is fucking up royally...I set it up for super-seeding with 3 upload slots max.....yet my ratio is over 2 with only half the torrent being available. I have no idea why uTorrent is fucking up this bad but I do apologize"
,xandizitxu,2007-02-06T14:59Z,For me no problem :) 
,Sprutmus,2007-02-06T22:47Z,"hey, i`m new on this, so i hope you can answer some question i have; do i have to buy a chip to my PS2 to play downloaded games???? "
,indierockerseattle,2007-02-07T00:21Z,"mod chip is a possibility, but most people go with swapmagic as it doesn't require any modding or opening of the system

,willywonkafctory,2007-02-07T05:20Z,"hi, i tried burning the game at different speeds and with 3 different writing methods. i used Alcohol, Nero, and DVD Decrypter with no luck. i keep getting the red screen. i know i am doing something wrong just do not know what it is for the moment. i have the DMS4 Pro chip and i have the slim ps2. could some one please tell me how to make the game playable on a DVD9. my final attempt to play the game is for me to download it directly to my PS2 hard drive. i will test it out as soon as it is done. i will attempt to download it directly to the hard either with the computer or my slim ps2. i am praying one these methods works for me."
,Xiphias83,2007-02-07T17:29Z,Has someone burned the game to an Dual Layer Disc yet? If someone has please tell witch burningprogram you used! I know that imgburn works when you burn Dual Layer Xbox 360 games!
,wacqy,2007-02-08T04:36Z,"1. Need to set booktype to DVD-ROM
2. Try using Toxic Dual Layer patch

Burning with any program eg Nero shld be fine."
,sal,2007-02-08T19:03Z,"indierocker i think you have done rely well and i think you deserve a big thankyou for beiong such a sticker and seeding this nice game for all of us.whether it works for some or not for others i would like to say:
THANKYOU FOR ALL THE TIME AND EFFORT.

,lpfreak,2007-02-09T13:19Z,i burned this games to verbatin dvd+r dual layer  with nero .but game still freezing at chapter 7
,lpfreak,2007-02-09T13:21Z,what should i do?
,StretchMarkBrad,2007-02-09T16:28Z,"Does anyone know if this will work on a PS2 HDD, and if it does, does it freeze at chapter 7? im using HDAdvance 3.0 and pc installing it.
The file is going to take a few days to download so I cant check till then."
,Agharta,2007-02-09T23:57Z,"Sorry for my ignorance but can someone with no dual layer drive record a dual layer dvd with some program?
cause i really want to play this game x( simply loved it up to chapter 7...
can someone tell me if swap magic works with this version or if i need something else?"
,lokostill,2007-02-16T00:10Z,"I downloaded the DVD9 Ver to my PS2HDD and it still freezes after chapter 7. I also tried the original game and it still freezes. It must be the dvd5 ver. save that is corrupted. My guess is if u start over from the beginning with DVD9 ver, it will work. Yeah I know, sucks. I was 23hrs in when mines froze. 23hrs down the drain."
,GNRobiN,2007-02-25T14:58Z,does this work or what?
,Dancingwind,2007-02-25T23:26Z,So did anyone played this one through from the begining to smth past chapter 7
,SubZane,2007-02-26T16:33Z,"I want to know the same thing. When I use my save file it freezes at chapter 7 like the nuked release. And I'm still clue less, ppl just say things like ""you prolly made an error burning, try again"" like that gonna help"
,SubZane,2007-02-27T00:54Z,"I just learned that some mod chips doesn't support DVD9, and I cannot recall what kind of chip I have so it might be because of that"
,cdali123,2007-03-13T22:32Z,"Ya um I found this a while back as i was  trying to find a way to play Dual Layer games.Someone should try it and post whether it works or not.it does  make sense though.....

 ""As many of you are probably aware, the PS2 has problems running DVD9 games
backed up onto dual layer media due to to problems reading from the second
layer. This is because the data format on burnt DL discs is different than on
pressed discs (burnt = OTP, pressed = PTP). However, we have discovered a
software hack which allows the PS2 to read even burnt OTP discs resulting in
working dual layer backups! Our Toxic firmware for DMS4 chips already includes
auto-patching functionality which applies our software hack on the fly when
booting games on dual layer media. For those without a DMS4, we present the
Toxic Dual Layer Image Patcher! The patcher works by applying our software
hack to the game image (.iso, .gi etc) before burning. Once the hack has
been applied by our patcher, burn the modified image to dual layer media
and play! This method will enable anybody with a modchip capable of booting
DVD9 media to backup and _play_ DVD9 games such as Gran Turismo 4.
