thx for the ul.
But....
I can't find the license file...license.tmp!
You have a copy or how do I proceed?"
,Vidiii,2007-02-09T22:07Z,"goto the directory crack ansys
follow these steps:
Make sure your removed all folders relating to previous ansys versions
if you made a dir c:\flexlm delete all the contents of this folder.

copy keygen folder to your harddisk

Goto x:\program files\ANSYS Inc\Shared Files\Licensing\intel (were x is probably c)



	1) Run WinHostID.exe, output will be like this:



	HOSTNAME: LineZero



	FLEXID: 00xxxxxxxxxx



	IDTYPE: E



	PLATFORM: Intel



	OS: Windows 2000 (x86)



	OPTIONS: None



	Open license.tmp in notepad, where you unpacked the keygen archive

	replace: SERVER linezer0 000000000000 1055

	with SERVER your-host-name, the zeros, replace with your flexid (all 12 chars!)=
	delete the 12 0 and put your flexid instead even if it isn't 12 chars



	2) SAVE! License.tmp. Now run ReCrypt.bat, you will get a license.dat created.



		Run anslic_admin.exe,



	Select ""Run license wizard.."" - STEP 1: Select YES

	Then select option ""Load information from existing..""



	Point to your newly created license.dat!



	STEP 2: Select YES



	select yourhost@1050



	STEP 3: Select YES



	You're done!.



	dX!LineZer0

Reboot perhaps.

If this doesn't work make a folder x:\flexlm (were x is probably c)
and copy your license.dat into this folder then 
Goto x:\program files\ANSYS Inc\Shared Files\Licensing\intel
and execute ""lmgrd -z"" or just execute ""lmgrd"" if you don't mind lot's of command
windows popping up. this should start the license server so you can run Ansys. you'll have
to execute lmgrd each time you wish to run ansys"

,Viriatus2,2008-06-14T16:33Z,"hi when i run ReCrypt.bat, cryptlic.exe gives a few errors:
""Counted FEATURE line missing SERVER line""

and a bad license.dat is created. What am i doing wrong?

i replace the server with HOSTNAME and the zeros with the FLEXID..."
,db4elle,2008-06-30T18:39Z,"@Viriatus2

When creating your licence.dat file, don't replace 'SERVER' with Hostname, you have to enter it like this: SERVER YOURHOSTNAMEHERE YOURFLEXIDHERE 1055

YOURHOSTNAME: this is your computer name, you created a computer name when installing Windows. If you don't know what it is, go to: Control Panel->System->Computer Name

YOURFLEXID: this is the MAC address of your ethernet adapter. I'm using my laptop which has two ethernet adapters, one for a direct LAN connection, and one for a Wifi connection. Use either one. To find the MAC address (or FlexID if you like), open command prompt window (Start->Run->cmd) and type: ipconfig/all
The MAC address will be the 12 characters under the 'Physical address' title, minus the hyphens of course.

Hope that helped.

Cheers."

thanks"
,Bergieboost,2008-12-03T21:56Z,"Hi again,
Finaly it worked out fine, can't remeber how I did but this morning (2008-12-03) I got this message:
""The license for one or more ansys products will expire in 29 day(s). Please contact your Ansys  sales Representative or Ansys inc.""
I changed the date (01-jan-2009) to (01-jan-2011) in license.dat at all places but I still get that jolly happy message!
Thanks for sharing anyway, it helped me a lot."
,Alexander_W,2009-02-13T09:13Z,"Hi,
