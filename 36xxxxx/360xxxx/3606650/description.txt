I'm back again with some old good hip-hop shit ripped from my own collection and will continue uploading. I've been having trouble with my laptop lately.   


SADAT X - WILD COWBOYS  (1996)   

- This is Sadat X from Brand Nubian debute album and it's filled with lots of 
  great tracks.
The album is produced by a real allstar gang: Diamond D (4 tracks), Buckwild (2), Da Beatminerz (1), Showbiz (1), Dante Ross (1), DJ Alamo (1), & Pete Rock (1). 

Check it out.
