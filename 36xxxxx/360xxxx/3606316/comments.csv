I really need a computer for my TV that can support 1080p ^^
But 768p will suffice, thank you very much."
,ArcheyLopez,2007-03-27T23:29Z,how to play this? .ts .par2?
,DRAC2GUNZ,2007-04-14T09:58Z,"@ArcheyLopez: First, the par2 files are used to make sure your download wasnt corrupt, you need a program such as ""QuickPAR"" to use them. Next your gonna need a beefy CPU to play a 1080p on your PC ( if you have a HDTV thats a different story ) Just google ""QuickPAR"" then go to www.forum.doom9.org and look around for topics about HD files and you will learn how to play/convert/etc. them to your liking."
