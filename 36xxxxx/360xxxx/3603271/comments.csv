,eimer0815,2007-02-01T05:41Z,Don't bother cracking this one. It is a late beta/release candidate of psd-manager 2 that corrupts PSD files sometimes (high res). The real 2.0 doesn't have this issue.
,FDOldschool,2007-02-01T14:05Z,"This is not a beta,
get your things strait before open your mouth.
this is the full retail version. you either have a broken pc or you have nothing better to do than spread bull."
,eimer0815,2007-02-01T18:22Z,"I compared the Hash (of psdmanager2.exe, not the ZIP) to the full retail 2.0 downloaded yesterday from Cebas and it is different. 

You better find a reliable supplier for this stuff and don't spread this buggy RC version."
,FDOldschool,2007-02-01T18:36Z,"Oh you did did you, you must be the stupidest 
man on this planet, cause you are tottaly wrong about that, This is the retail version downloaded from Cebas shop almost 1 month ago ,even have the license and order to prove it to you, you sorry looking sucker!
Go spread you shit somewhere else."
,eimer0815,2007-02-02T16:18Z,"Hahaha - yes sure you purchased it when it came out and then waited 3 weeks before you to posted this online for everyone else. This makes no sense at all FDOldschool. 

I'm still wairing for your proof instead of this crap you send me via PM. You don't even know how a Cebas shop download link and license request code looks like. "
,FDOldschool,2007-02-03T15:19Z,"Yes thats correct , by the way if you got the retail version yourself, witch you are soo proud of, then wy are you even here !
like i said your a total idiot and you have nothing better to do that spreading crap.
i know something you dont.
and please post your crap below"
