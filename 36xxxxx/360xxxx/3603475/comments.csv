,Pezzan,2007-01-25T17:44Z,It doesn´t start plz help!
,alwe6159,2007-01-25T19:09Z,Does this torrent work?
,yang_damian,2007-01-25T19:18Z,"Oh, mama! You have no ideea how i've been waiting for this game. Since the release date i've checked trackers every 6 hours or so. Now let's just hope this is as good as EU2!"
,yang_damian,2007-01-25T19:20Z,"alwe6159: Yes, it very much does work"
,Yobo1987,2007-01-25T20:03Z,Is this the complete game or a demo. The complete game is to be released tomorrow (26). And 265.27 mib seems small.
[T],Knaster,2007-01-25T20:58Z,Yobo it's been released for some days now
,Yobo1987,2007-01-25T21:17Z,Ok thx. Thought it was due 26:th. Anyway is it full? It looks alot like risk but that was way bigger that 365.27. So is it the full game?
,Kaspar4283,2007-01-25T23:12Z,"The size should be about 300 MB, so this torrent seems quite realistic."
,patthehun,2007-01-26T07:19Z,"hmm, when i tried opening the game, it shifts to ultra zoomed widescreen and shifts to the right, i cant play this game its some kind of graphical glitch.  Is anybody else experiencing this problem or am i the only schmuck?  "
[T],Knaster,2007-01-26T09:24Z,"The screen is automatically set to 1280x960 ithink so if you have the screen resolution set to different you need to change it at ""options"". Make sure you've got the spec. requirements!"
,yang_damian,2007-01-26T09:54Z,patthehun: I'm also experiencing this problem. I also changed the game resolution to 1024*768 which is the setting I usualy use but it didn't solve the problem. I also tried changing the desktop resolution to the game default but no result. The only way to see to entire game right now is to start the game in window mode. I'll get back to you when I'll find a solution.
,yang_damian,2007-01-26T19:12Z,"Ok, what you need for that error is to get you latest video card drivers. That's what worked for me"
,Pezzan,2007-01-26T19:51Z,Great game thx!
,stonydk,2007-01-27T00:30Z,thx man.
,Herman_von_Salza,2007-01-27T21:09Z,"That was shaitt!!!

,wickerman,2007-01-28T10:31Z,buy the game!!!!!
,Zedrick,2007-01-28T15:35Z,"wickerman: Unfortunately this game can't be bought, only licensed. You own the CD, Paradox owns the game. Which sucks.

I would have payed for this game anyway, if it had been any good... Unfortunately it was a big letdown (at least judging from the demo, haven't downloaded the full release)."
,RexMundi,2007-01-28T16:36Z,Try downloading and installing the update. You don't need a crack. It works fine for me. Great game.
,Mr. G,2007-01-28T18:21Z,"Yes, buy it.
It's wort ever $/?/kr/£ it costs!
And, no, I really don't says this about many games."
,Enyap,2007-01-28T19:00Z,I got crash to desktop (eu3.exe encountered the problem bla bla bla). Anyone knows what the problem might be?

Open the settings.txt and change the pixel settings to 1024*768 instead of the custom settings. worked for me"
,Enyap,2007-01-30T00:40Z,"To Apocalypti

,exit_,2007-02-01T12:59Z,"Du laddar ner en klient som kan hantera torrents (finns en bra på http://pingpong-abc.sourceforge.net/), sedan tankar du ner den här filen och öppnar den med programmet. Finns guider att läsa om du googlar."

,farfar55,2007-02-02T12:07Z,"Tack, tack, jag vet vad RAR är för något. Men alla RAR-arkiven är ju identiska och skapar samma .bin - fil!
"
,carioca,2007-02-02T14:05Z,Når du har fått laget bin og cue fil så må du mounte cue-filen med f.eks. daemontools eller eventuelt brenne alt til CD ved å hente inn cue-filen via Nero.

No crack needed
For those with problems try downloading the patch and update your graphic drivers. The readme mentions something about that.
Fuzzface: Sounds like you're on a limited account in XP. Log in with admin rights."
,backflash,2007-02-09T15:10Z,"Kostaz: No its not a joke it is the correct size. 1 .cue and 1 .bin file which, when started in Daemon tools, works just fine. Game has been installed and is very much enjoyed. Go for it m8."

Is it possible that it hasn't downloaded everything because its says that it needs a file?
And some files are marked as uncompleted.

So is it possible that it hasn't downloaded everthing even it says its 100%downloaded?

Please someone answer to those questions!"
,WeirdGuy,2007-03-10T15:33Z,"Are the all files included in this torrent files that have to be extracted? because some of my files are files that cant be identified and are uncompleted?

,Piddyx,2008-03-24T08:28Z,"For anyone who sees the intro then it shuts down:  you need a new graphics card that has pixel shader 2.0  current cards have 3.0 so that covers just about everything on the market.

People who cannot update to 1.3:  The paradox server that lets you upload the patch is overloaded.  You need to find the patch somewhere else.  I know this sounds unlikely, but it is really that simple.  It is a networking problem on their end."

,j5ize,2012-05-24T19:12Z,"This works fine. When you first open the game, there will be a screen that asks if you want to check for an update. Get the update, and run BEFORE you try to play the game. Trying to play without the patch is going to give you errors.

Other then that, there's nothing you need to run this game. Decent upload"
