,Ulman,2007-01-25T00:27Z,"But jhgskjhwxz, they are having so much fun it is contagious.
You cannot help feeling the joy if life through these girls...

Why don't you join the website, then you can download exactly what you want instead of being so negative about what is available for free... :-)"
,jhgskjhwxz,2007-01-25T03:06Z,"Abby is said to be different than others and revolutionaly, but I don't think so. 

They are just more picky about the personalities of the women rather than just picking the prettiest one. But for every good Abby, there are 4 bad ones.  It used to be real orgasms, but nowadays that doesn't seem to be important, which is sad. And without orgasms, and without prettiness, and hairy asses the clips are worth less or even worthless. I guess I am picky about my porn.
Sapphicerotica doesn't have many orgasms either but some women there are amazingly goodlooking. Imagine combining the two.  "
,dixiebullfrog,2007-05-20T17:31Z,"Probably unlike any other AW video you've seen, and, for the most part, I agree with the description of ""jhgskjhwxz"". It is not sexy or sexual; there is, however, some kissing but it is cute kissing (not the prolonged AW kissing you like). When one babe dares to kiss all the women, one female actually refuses. And there are a few caressing hands on pussies, but more like playing ""grab-ass"".
Very few intimate close-ups; most everybody is visible in every scene. Another downer is the conversation is pretty well dominated by 2 or 3 girls; that's one thing I hate in the real world.
Can't recommend a D/L, but if you like shopping at the mall and pre-teen sleepovers, this may be your thing!"
,Flem3000,2008-07-22T03:13Z,What are you complaining about? This was awesome. Pretty nice to see something where the girls seem to have fun. And the girls arent ugly. They sort of look like girls you would actually meet in real life and probably try to get with after having been fucked up with them for a whole night partying and laughing your ass off. Smily porn is the new mean abusive porn.
