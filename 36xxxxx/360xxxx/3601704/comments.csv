,ellz,2007-01-25T20:38Z,"How's the quality, sound, picture?"
,saturated,2007-02-01T20:11Z,"Audio and video are fine BUT there is an extremely annoying timer in the top portion of the letter box, with even hundredths of a second flying by. I figure with a little effort in the VLC prefs it can be somehow cropped during viewing.

Thanks for the fast seeding folks and thanks chrysalis-tpb for sharing."

,Zoracic,2007-03-27T08:26Z,"Nero 7.8.5.0 (better with the newest) has an excellent cropping tool which works well. Look under Nero Recode.

,LIGLAGG12,2007-12-02T23:41Z,"to crop without nero, open in vlc player rightclick on your mouse, choose ""besk채r"" or crop and choose 221:100 and the timer disappears"

,rajaoui,2008-08-28T13:41Z,it says france-algeire  that;s bullshit cause it's a moroccan movie with moroccan acteur jamal debouze who also playd in the movie asteriz and obelix
,MDunn1937,2010-08-10T08:05Z,"@rajaoui: It's a French film directed by Rachid Bouchareb, who is French-Algerian. Also, Debbouze was born in Paris. He may be a of Moroccan descent, but he is most assuredly French. So, no, it's not bullshit."
,MDunn1937,2010-08-10T10:34Z,"A couple of people here have recommended cropping to get rid of the timer at the top. You can do this only if you are willing and able to watch it in French and Arabic, otherwise you will lose the subtitles. In effect, you'll just have to ignore the timer."
,puppyup,2010-12-10T15:39Z,Hardsubs crap.
,magi123,2011-09-07T09:29Z,I have to say this is not a very good version. Be aware before you download it.
