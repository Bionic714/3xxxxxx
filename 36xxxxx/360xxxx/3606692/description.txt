Leaders Of The New School - A Future Without A Past
---------------------------------------------------
Released 1991 - Elektra Records


A Future Without A Past is an underrated album I think. L O N S are very unique and they got their own style and sound on this funny concept album where you follow them a day trough school.  Dinco Dean, Charlie Brown and the well known Busta Rhymes share the mic, while Cut Monitor Milo bring the beats and scratches.
 

This is really worth checking out.
