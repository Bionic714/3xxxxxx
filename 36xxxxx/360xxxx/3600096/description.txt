Booby Seale's "Seize the Time" is essentially a primary source of the Black Panther Party--written by the Party's courageous co-founder. Much of the book focuses on the work and vision of Huey P. Newton. I was very much struck by Seale's unquestioning devotion to Newton. Having read other books by or about Party members, I realize from reading this classic book that Seale was blind to many of Newton's contradictions. At the same time, however, Seale seemed devoted equally to the freedom and self-determination of African people.

Both of these leaders took the African struggle in America to another level. They put into practice what the great Malcolm X said about "making it plain" and to defend one's self. As hard as it was, they worked to simplify the struggle rather than intellectualize it. Unfortuneatly, however, they spent more time having to overcome relentess pressures and attacks by Oakland police, the FBI, the racist judicial system, and the entire White racist society.

Seale's book is not a critical analysis of the Party, like for instance Elaine Brown's book "A Taste of Power," but it does bear witness to one of the most radical organizations ever developed in America.
