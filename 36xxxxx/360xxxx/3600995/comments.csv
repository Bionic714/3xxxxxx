,toppenkillen,2007-01-23T00:26Z,How come this movie is 'only' 12 GB and not 20+ as other HD-DVD rips?
,amac13,2007-01-23T00:42Z,"just guessing...but maybe it is a shorter movie. Also, all the extras may have been removed. This is just a guess though."
,anybody2k,2007-01-23T10:44Z,"From what i read here on the web (http://www.bigpicturebigsound.com/kiss-kiss-bang-bang-hd-dvd-803.shtml) it's smaller because it's a Combo-Disc with HD-DVD on one side, and a standard DVD on the other side.

This seems to reduce the HD-DVD Storage capacity to 15GB (from 30GB).

But according to the reviewer (see link) you should be able to live with that just fine:
""As with earlier Warner releases on HD-DVD, the picture quality of the 1080p widescreen HD transfer is top-notch, with excellent detail, nice color resolution and excellent rendition of shadows and darkly lit scenes. """
,laba_laba,2007-01-23T23:35Z,HD-DVD rip? Does that mean that HD-DVD encryption is cracked for real?  
,laba_laba,2007-01-23T23:38Z,... and how do I view this format? VideoLAN?

,eriksson-,2007-01-24T17:51Z,"The first HD-DVD and Blu Ray disks were only single layer. Thats why its ""only"" 12 gigs. "
,andersl2,2007-02-01T21:11Z,"If you use a digital connection from the PC to the screen, it might not work. For mye Chronicles of Riddick did not play on a DVI conneciton, but on VGA connection it did just fine."
,alishmee,2007-02-20T05:43Z,is there a way to burn this to work on a normal dvd?
,vietnam999990,2007-02-22T21:08Z,"what software should i use to play this?
