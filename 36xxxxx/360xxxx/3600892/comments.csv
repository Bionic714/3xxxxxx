,webrosc,2007-01-24T01:25Z,"originally aired 16th jan on sky one, according to imdb.com this is ep 12 not 14, but there does seem to be a gap"
,psychah,2007-02-01T16:09Z,"apparently, that's as it should, seems it will be explained, sort of; at least according to rumours on gateworld"
,redhammer,2007-02-03T17:54Z,"and still a working 12 is nowhere to be found, I tryed the only real 12 out there but it wont start downloading :S even though it says 12 seeders and 0 leechers :S:S:S:S"
