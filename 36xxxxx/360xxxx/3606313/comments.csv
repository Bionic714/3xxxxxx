Did you do anything to recognize the card?"

,JSkywalker217,2007-08-14T03:18Z,"Of course they're viruses in these programs!  They are hacking tools you dorks.  Although you Antivirus finds it...it will not infect your pc becuase it is an iso.  And all you need to do is burn it to a DVD or CD.  Plus you will not get infected becuase the virus is not an .exe file and that the fact it doesn't run...it's just there and your antivirus finds it.  

Also people who have Norton...why do you guys think that Norton is protecting your PC from Viruses.  Norton and McAfee are your 2 worst AVs out there.  I preferrably use Avira Antivir.  Rated best in front of NOD32 AV.  NORTON SUCKS!!!"

as 'haakjay' mentioned, this is outdated, backtrack 3 is much more useful...
if you really want to use it, my suggestions are you install VMware workstation and create a VM off of this iso image. 
Once that's done, you can go through the different programs on the distro...

Pretty much a waste of time, if you ask me... :D"

1 burn the iso to a cd
2 learn a little about linux
3 spend the rest of your life flameing windows  forums about how superior you are cause you run linux and never ever get a virus and never ever get laid
4 give up on this distro cause 99.9 % of you that download this will never get it to work cause your all fail"

,PirateTopboy,2010-06-19T18:27Z,"Fuckin noobs, burn the iso file and restart your PC. Then it will automatically startup.

If it is hanging upon choosing your resolution, choose '7' and click enter after.

Then it should load.
