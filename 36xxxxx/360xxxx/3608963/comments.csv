,cazcade,2007-02-22T10:13Z,"Well it says ""Dolby"" so I would guess its dolby 5.1. But then again I dont have the file and im no expert..."
,elliotPK,2007-02-23T04:20Z,"Im done downloading, and its in Stereo Sound oh well,
I opened the MKV file with Media player classic and  the video quality is HD."

,leetXcore,2007-11-04T05:19Z,I'm assuming this is 720p?
,hellst0rm,2008-06-24T12:30Z,"Great torrent, thanks a lot!"
,vldd3mon,2009-01-07T23:46Z,seed this please :(
,barton101,2012-08-09T08:15Z,"Next time,at least please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
