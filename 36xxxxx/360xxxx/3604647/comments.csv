Är det nåhgon ide att ladda ner om man bara har skivor på 4.7 Gib?
Går filmen att bränna på två skivor?"
,Fregne,2007-01-28T19:01Z,You can choose to buy a DL-Disc or use a program like DVDFab or DVD Shrink or remove unwanted material and burn it to a DVD5 disc.
,Fregne,2007-01-28T19:03Z,"""to remove"" i meant in last post.

DVDFab will let you burn it to 2 discs aswell.

Enjoy"

,raider56,2007-02-14T12:22Z,"If anyone is stuck on this torrent, or your client is trowing away a lot of ""bad data"" you have to check the ip-numbers of your peers carefully. I can see at least 3 different peers uploading huge amount of crap into this swarm. When i'm banning them, my dl works much better. But they are coming back all the time. They seams to have whole series of ip-numbers starting with 38 and 209. Please don't ban an innocent peer. Check first!"
