A diary records what happened everyday, but Winnie's dairy               
       records what will happen in the future - a version of                    
       reality she creates with her own paranoid "fact"!                  
                                                                                
       Winnie once had a happy family and a caring lover. One day,              
       she found her lover, Seth, gone without a word. Unable to                
       bear the pain, she called her friend, Yvonne, for help.                  
       After listening to Winnie, Yvonne, surprisingly, taught                  
       Winnie to revenge on the one who betrays her......
