,gtnufc,2007-02-03T10:58Z,Why only 227mb?
,Pirate_Yo,2007-02-03T12:36Z,"Numb3rs.S03E14.HDTV.XviD-LOL\numb3rs.314.hdtv-lol.r00 is missing.

that's why the filesize i so small."
[V],boze,2007-02-03T12:56Z,That's why we don't want RARed movies on BitTorrent. It defeats the purpose.
,gtnufc,2007-02-03T13:23Z,"Don't bother downloading, this file doesn't work.  Half of the content is missing."
,BBu,2007-02-03T21:45Z,"kdsde: you might be a mod, but maybe you should think before posting.

How could somebody unpack a file when one part of the rar-files is missing and make a torrent out of it?!

If the file would be unpacked in the first place, somebody might have noticed it BEFORE offering a torrent...

And that way people don't have to waste time by searching for a missing rar-file.

rar kills p2p. "
,BBu,2007-02-04T12:14Z,"kdsde: again, you weren't thinking... or do you really know that less about this stuff?!

You can't unpack a multi-file archive if one part is missing!"
