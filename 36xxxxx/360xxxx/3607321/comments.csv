I am SOOOOO sorry for Nathan Fillion. Ever since Firefly was cancelled, which was the biggest mistake in the history of man and Fox knows this, he had to take shitty roles. Slither was OK but this? This might just end his career.

Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) has a good job and a loving family- until one day his family is murdered in front of his eyes and in broad daylight by a man named Henry Caine (Craig Fairbrass) who then kills himself. Haunted by guilt for not being able to save his family, Abe attempts suicide and nearly succeeds- but he resists being drawn to a ?bright white light? before dying and survives. But shortly afterwards he starts noticing white glows around people and learns these glows mean these people are about to die unless he saves them. Abe uses his new gift to it?s full advantage and saves many lives- but he then learns that ?if you save a life, you are responsible for it? and as he goes digging deeper into the motives behind his family?s killing and the full extent of his new-found powers, it takes him on a terrifying and apocalyptic journey into hell from which there will be no escape."
