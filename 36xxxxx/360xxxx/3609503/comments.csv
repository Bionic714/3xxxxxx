,rossecorp,2007-02-17T22:56Z,"Of course, and the whole release was a BSA-backed stool pigeon. Based on IP addresses collected so far, thirty copyright infringers have been identified and will be interrogated.


There is a file named LICENSE.TXT in the archive - just say ""I'm using a Softkey license"", and everything will go smoothly.


Don't forget to persuade your employer to purchase a legal copy of SDLTrados -- the BSA is watching!"
,rexator,2007-07-17T22:07Z,"Thanks! Really appreciated this release. 

But what's this SDL shit about 5 languages max? Do they think their customers are fucking ignorants?!"
,jjjjonson,2007-09-13T15:13Z,"thanks alot rossecorp, this seems to be working great. The .lic file is included and works!"

,Epiquros,2007-11-07T19:49Z,"actually i don't need this bs, just a converter for makie tmx from tmw"
,Epiquros,2007-11-08T09:36Z,"More seeders plaese, and increase your seeding limit. (speed)"

,Jabba3,2008-02-23T02:06Z,"Please seed it some more, I need this too :)"
,cripta,2008-03-13T12:35Z,Is this compatible with Windows Vista?
,bricyn,2008-03-17T22:54Z,Could you kindly tell me how to use the licence.lic file....?
,Epiquros,2008-04-07T23:55Z,"You cannot install the ""SDL Trados Synergy Client"" component under Vista.
It requires the .NET framework (i installed version 3.5, which is for Vista), but this doesn't help. The isntallation will fail."
,kbrown0410,2008-04-28T02:25Z,"find and install .Net framework 1.1

thats what is needed"
,vidadave,2008-10-21T05:49Z,"Hello rossecorp. I dowloaded Trados 2006. Unfortunately, when I try to open one of my translation memory, I receive the following message: 

Translation memory too large for demo mode. Install a valid license file or connect a dongle to the parallel port. 


Could you please tell what i shall do now? It seems to be a demo version...

Please answer me."
,cripta,2009-04-23T13:37Z,"Indeed it works perfectly in Vista and you don't have to search for .NET framework 1.1 - it is already included in the Setup package.
Thnx!"
