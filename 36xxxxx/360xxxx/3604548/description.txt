Just 40 years after a famous TIME magazine cover asked "Is God Dead?" the answer
 appears to be a resounding "No!" According to a survey by the Pew Forum on Reli
gion & Public Life in a recent issue of Foreign Policy magazine, "God is Winning
". Religions are increasingly a geopolitical force to be reckoned with. Fundamen
talist movements - some violent in the extreme - are growing. Science and religi
on are at odds in the classrooms and courtrooms. And a return to religious value
s is widely touted as an antidote to the alleged decline in public morality. Aft
er two centuries, could this be twilight for the Enlightenment project and the b
eginning of a new age of unreason? Will faith and dogma trump rational inquiry, 
or will it be possible to reconcile religious and scientific worldviews? Can evo
lutionary biology, anthropology and neuroscience help us to better understand ho
w we construct beliefs, and experience empathy, fear and awe? Can science help u
s create a new rational narrative as poetic and powerful as those that have trad
itionally sustained societies? Can we treat religion as a natural phenomenon? Ca
n we be good without God? And if not God, then what?

This is a critical moment in the human situation, and The Science Network in ass
ociation with the Crick-Jacobs Center brought together an extraordinary group of
 scientists and philosophers to explore answers to these questions. The conversa
tion took place at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA from November 5-7, 2006.
