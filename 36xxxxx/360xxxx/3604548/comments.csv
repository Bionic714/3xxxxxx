,mrtanooki,2007-03-27T03:20Z,to the people who dont seed after downloading: i wish there were a hell so you could go to it
,Blodhosta,2007-05-09T16:02Z,"Just thought I'd brag about having seeded this to a ratio of 25:1... So I'm closing in on 100 GB uploaded, and I thought I'd keep going for as long as there seem to be an interrest in these files. 

I think it's a good thing to make this kind of stuff available. Many who hold a more naturalistic worldview seem to think of it with a kind of insecure shame, or not think of it at all. I believe many don't even know there are others out there who are doing some great work to give structure to these thoughts. I also think it's important to ""break the spell"" that Dennett is talking about, and I think this is a good time to do it."
,Blodhosta,2007-06-29T20:13Z,"I've seeded this to a ratio of about 1:106 now, and the torrent is pretty much dead as far as I can tell. If you want to get this I suggest going to the original source at the link in the description.

While you're at it, please visit http://www.defendscience.org and sign the statement and/or give a little donation. It's amazing that an action like that is even needed, but that's the world we live in and any help (financial or otherwise) is much appreciated."
,DeathDrive,2008-05-22T15:37Z,Outstanding material. I'll be seeding for as long as I possibly can!
,DeathDrive,2008-05-24T20:52Z,Anyone else experience audio dropout on Session 09 file at about 1:17:20?
