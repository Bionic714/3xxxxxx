[about us]
PMS was created in July 2000. We focus mostly
on the metal based genres. We like to expose
everyone to new underground bands that dont
get any publicity. We are looking for you to
fuck off and die and leave us the fuck alone.
Hi Mom, Dad and RIAA.

Shouts to: All the PMS rippers and suppliers.

Porch Monkey Surveilance keep up the good work
