,animanogami,2007-02-05T07:03Z,The quaility is iffy when I played it.  I get stuck in digital particle mode though theres dialogue going on in the background.  Also not sure why theres 99 files.  
,jammer699669,2007-02-05T19:36Z,"What are you using to play IT?? I recommend Nero Showtime because the MP4 is nero format
and there are 99 files because that is the breakdown into rars for 1.35 gig

,jammer699669,2007-02-10T18:16Z,"I didn't do the subtilitles so don't know why they are like that  , maybe to be more expressive


If you are missing a rar file then it didn't download correctly. Re download the torrent and save it to the same place and it should just download the missing files
