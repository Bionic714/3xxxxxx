This is another audience recording of a show from John Foxx's 1983 'Golden Section' tour.  This particular show is the 4th December show in Milano.  

Once again, I take absolutely no credit for this torrent.  All kudos and credit goes to Bluevision who originally seeded this torrent on Dimeadozen.  Unfortunately that torrent site is closed to new members at the moment so I am posting it here so that some friends (and others) can access it.  The show is in .flac format.

As a bonus, the last 7 tracks on the second disk are from Foxx's concert in Hitchin, England which took place on 12th October 1983.

Please do not sell this show and please do not convert it to a compressed format.
