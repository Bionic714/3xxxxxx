This CD is awsome! Everyone in Illinois, most particularly everyone in the Ultrasound department at Scott AFB, will be playing this CD until the cows come home.

Reviewer: Rolling Stone   (click for website)
There is so much talent in even one member of this band, that I'm sure they could have four stellar solo careers. As it is, all four working together to achieve this..... is nothing short of unfathomable. This album is like intense passionate sex for you ears.

5 out of 5 stars Great CD
