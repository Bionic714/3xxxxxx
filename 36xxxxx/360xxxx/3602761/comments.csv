,harm82,2007-01-24T14:45Z,"Download a program called Winrar and open the first file *.01 or *.rar if there is one  then exctract the file.  Some media player can play the file whitout exctrackt the file (XBMC does it, but that player if for the xbox)"

WinRAR is de facto standard compression programm beside ZIP. Unrar and enjoy the AVI-File."
