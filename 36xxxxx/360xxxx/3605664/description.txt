In the past few years, a hurricane has engulfed the debate about global 
warming. This crucial scientific issue has become a rhetorical firestorm 
with science pitted against spin and inflammatory words on both sides. 
Bob McKeown investigates why a debate that some say could determine the 
very future of our planet has become a partisan battleground.

The Denial Machine follows a small but powerful group of scientists who 
argue, among other claims, that global warming may be a good thing and it 
investigates their links to the oil and coal industries.
