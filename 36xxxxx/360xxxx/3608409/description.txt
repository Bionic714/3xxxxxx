Las  Vegas  is  burning  while  the  world  watches. International
      terrorist  Irena  Morales  has  amassed  an army of mercenaries to
      besiege  America's  playground,  but  her  true  agenda  remains a
      mystery.  Hero  Logan Keller and his team have one night to return
      order  to  the  heart  of chaos before Irena achieves her ultimate
      objective. What they discover will not only change Rainbow itself,
      but  could  also  tip  the balance of power firmly in favor of the
      terrorists.
