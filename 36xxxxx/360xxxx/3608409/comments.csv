,zalle_swe,2007-02-16T14:15Z,"guys, i'm very sorry for all the inconvenience i have caused, i got a problem with my router, and sometimes when my internet crashed i got to reset it, it does that a couple of times per day and well, i am not home all the time so i can't make this problem steady, and yet again i apologize for all the inconvenience i have caused.

Regards
Zalle"
