The unbelievable story of Gene CHIP Tatum, a 25 year CIA BLACK Ops Agent. You will never believe in a million years what this man has to say, while he was in the CIA he taped all the conversations he and his team had with Nixon, Clinton, Bush and so many others.. He was put on a CIA operation in the 1970's and was not suppose to come out a live him and 13 others, Nixon gave the word that they were to die once they were used to destroy another Govt President in another country... from there he got away after being tortured and went on to bigger and better things but knew from that day on he had to document and video everything he saw and heard as he knew it was the other thing that would protect him, people these Officials are evil to the core and unless we all stood up to them we are heading into some very evil and hard times.. Gene Tatum shares so much information that is amazing and unbelievable but so very true. The sound quality is about 8/10 as they had to film it in a far away place in secret, but it is good quality.
