,Gask01,2007-01-28T18:02Z,"It was interesting to see bits and peices of another very different culture... however this movie takes far too long to tell its (imo, simple) tale and gets quite boring very often."
,Gask01,2007-01-28T18:03Z,It is useful if you are a student of anthropology at any rate.
,neilium,2007-05-20T15:45Z,"G'day,
          I can't get the subtitles to come onto the screen..  can anyone help. I just unpackaged it and played it with a few media players.  unpacked the subs folder and still nothing. doing.. Do I have to make an image file to view the subs... 

 GReat movie not boring as some suggest but absolutely fascinating from the most advanced culture still surviving on earth. I suggest some australian indigenous reading to fully appreciate the movie.
                 Cheers Neil"
,Jack The Lad,2007-11-07T07:56Z,"Thanks for this great upload, but I can´t make the subs work either. I usually don´t need subtitles, but it would be great to follow the aboriginal dialogue as well as the english narrator. I´ve tried to highlight the sub files along with the movie itself and drag them over into the players, but that doesn´t seem to get me anywhere. What am I doing wrong? "
,Mogambo,2008-09-02T15:10Z,"if u r having sub trouble, rename the movie to match the subs (or vice versa?) - media player classic will detect & load them automatically... i think vlc will too

nice up, thanks kollll!"
,SaribeN,2008-10-24T13:54Z,"Thanks, but I couldn't make the subs work. Found these, they work perfect and are in sync.
