,artytorrent,2007-10-12T13:39Z,"Everybody needs a 303 and I've got several virtual versions. I downloaded this so I could do a like-for-like comparison with the CM-303 and D16 Phoscyon.
Firstly, the torrent works fine. UnRAR everything into one folder. Run the setup.exe and boot up your sequencer. Use the Keygen for registration info once you've loaded an instance of the synth. (Verified to work fine in FL Studio 7).

Now for the comparisons. For a simple octave bassline playing 8ths with a standard saw wave, I think the freebie CM-303 actually sounded phatter than either the ABL or Phoscyon, but the bonus features of these latter synths are what make them shine.
The CM-303 doesn't respond to volume changes, so has none of the accenting possibilities of the original hardware. I wasn't too impressed with the new ABL skins (the original yellow is fine) but  the preset patterns are INCREDIBLE! Included are some melodies taken from famous records, with the knobs set up to sound authentic. I had loads of fun just playing with the filter and resonance while running the Fatboy Slim-inspired ""Everybody Loves an ABL"" preset. By using the onboard step sequencer, you can learn just how an acidic 303 pattern can sound so amazing, using slides and octave shifts.
After spending some time with this plug, I think I might just uninstall my other 303 emulations. Its minor lack of phatness on start-up can be augmented by a separate delay, filter or distortion plug, but the preset patterns make this really fun to use. For creativity and just general playability, this VSTi is FANTASTIC!

Thanks for sharing."
