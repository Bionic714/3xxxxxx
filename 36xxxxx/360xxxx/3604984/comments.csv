,Iceburgslim,2007-01-29T04:53Z,"Sounds like I'm listening to this hanging off the side of a train.  The sound skips during the whole movie.  I watched it anyway.

Great movie, thanks for trying."

,sandasandasanda,2007-02-01T21:46Z,This is the suckiest quality i have EVER seen! The audio makes you wanna eat your ears and the picture makes you wanna eat your eyes! And then you can't never see a movie again so DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP!
