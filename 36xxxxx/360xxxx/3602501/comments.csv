,Vyper_Boy,2008-02-13T08:41Z,"do you happen to know anything (a link to a torrent or so) about the 3d buzz c++/openGl full bundle , cuz that would be pretty cool :D"
,Ferocious_Imbecile,2008-03-23T05:51Z,I'm doing this tutorial right now. I know nothing about programming and I've tried several tutorials on programming and gave up. This however is outstanding and I'm really just absorbing all of it. Top notch. If nobody posts the sequels I may have to go to 3d buzz and buy them...It's that good.
,FR33,2008-12-10T05:19Z,Please seed!
,kotj101,2009-03-27T19:59Z,"thanks for this, good quality on these vids!!

if anyone has the rest of this series pls upload!!"
,zingmars,2010-01-18T15:57Z,"as far as I know these are available for free from 3D buzz homepage, and that if you buy the DVD, you get to access the last 2 chapters, oh and they are watermarked, so if they find your torrent they are gonna sue your a$$ or something. sucks really. ;("
