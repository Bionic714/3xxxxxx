This is a series of C++ video tutorials for beginners. They cover some of the basics in a very easy and relaxed way. They work in .NET 2003, but most of the stuff is platform/environment independent. They even write a simple little game. Video and audio is as good as one could ask for.

I liked it a lot. It's a good introduction.
