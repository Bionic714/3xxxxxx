Somebody asked for audio files from this special and so here they are. I have cut it up into 11 mp3s. I made sure that the areas of the show that were dependent on the visuals were by themselves so that you can delete them if you like and as for the rest, I just cut along each commercial break essentially.

Files:
01 - Intro.mp3
02 - Standup.mp3
03 - Large Pad.mp3
04 - Porcupines.mp3
05 - Piano.mp3
06 - Standing Guitar.mp3
07 - Art.mp3
08 - Mythozoology.mp3
09 - Getting the Harmonica.mp3
10 - Sitting Guitar.mp3
11 - Where My Jokes Go.mp3


Tracks 03, 07, and 09 are completely nonsensical, I think, without visuals but somebody might want them so they are in
