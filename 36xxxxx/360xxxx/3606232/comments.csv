,WiNsUrFeR,2007-03-18T19:06Z,"emiel9999 ... yes u can burn the image onto a disc or u cud also mount the image using virtual drive like daemon tools or alcohol 120%.
kersantti.... Since tis is disc 2 of my previous post, I did not find the need to post the serial key here.. If u want the serial check out the torrent of allied disc
tot25.... U have to download the red alert 2 allied disc first and install it... the soviet disc is only if u wana play the soviet campaigns. Red alert 2 yuri's revenge is a expansion for red alert 2.
for those who have any more problems or questions read all of the comments in all 3 torrents, before u ask something"

,JVisc,2008-09-14T11:21Z,"1) To play online you need a valid serial key - buy the game
2) You can play LAN over internet using Hamachi (google it)
3) Use this patch: http://www.understorm.net/cnc/lan/ts_ra2.php for playing over network on vista
4) To play on vista, set the compatability of ra2.exe to 2000 or XP, and right click ra2.exe and click Run as Administrator"

,Kagirion,2009-10-15T15:14Z,"Hey WiNs, or...anyone really...

Is Yuri's Revenge just the second disk of red alert 2, the Soviet one, or is it a separate expansion from the two disks (are there two?) in red alert 2 ???

Also, can I open this with daemon tools-mount it like an iso?

TAA!!!"
,Kagirion,2009-10-15T15:18Z,"HAH, nevermind...
2 disks in ra2, then another one or two for Yuri's.

Other question still relevant tho!!!
