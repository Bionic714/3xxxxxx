it is 1280x720 pixels at least. This just standard definition."
,BitLordMan,2007-01-31T17:08Z,grinningtotem > but this isn't a real HDTV release!!
,grinningtotem,2007-02-01T16:06Z,"Ok smarty pants, so what are you going to put when it actually is highdef?!
And 'people' don't know diddle about HD, because of situations like this.
And quite frankly, in most cases a downscaling to SD doesn't give a FAR better image.
It could even be worse, because of the colourspace used in HD and the Xvid compression afterwards."
,svunnig,2007-02-15T20:35Z,"Well actually dummy pants (grinningtotem). Get to know the naming standards before uttering stupid remarks about something that is defacto.
Usually a release of a tv-series is marked:

*name*.*season*.*episode*.(*proper?*.)*source*.(*resolution?*.) *codec*.*creators-nick*

And *resolution* is specified:
Standard, no res specified = usually anything from 500 to 640.
HR = HighRes. a 2x downscale of full HD (990x540). Usually to speed up encoding because of MMX optimizations.
720p = well, same as HD-standard (1280x720)

as you seem somewhat familiar with standards I will abstain from writing the obvious."
