,speediii,2007-01-29T18:36Z,hollastarz: A jimmy no stars fhuckin' mongo.  You've tainted this brilliant upload with your retardation.
,coditza,2007-01-29T20:11Z,"Why is everybody calling the current season, season 6? It's 5th, check http://www.tv.com/family-guy/show/348/episode_listings.html?season=5&tag=nav_bar;5 for more info. "
,pubis,2007-01-29T20:49Z,Don't download this crap! This is just 509! 
,IzNohGod,2007-01-31T06:04Z,"Thx! Awsome download speed.. 900kb/s.

Keep up the good work!!!"
,bakuryu_66,2007-02-01T20:19Z,"its not 509 you plebian..its 609
it might be 5 in europe and 6 in america..
but its a  new episode"
[V],Debender,2007-02-03T00:01Z,"this is the latest episode. this is the 6 season being aired on tv, but it will be season 5 on the dvd release."
,Mekkabrajja,2007-02-03T19:45Z,cheers m8
,coditza,2007-02-05T04:57Z,"Are you retarded?
On both tv.com and imdb.com the current season is 5. 

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182576/episodes#season-5

And check the air date, season 6 is not out yet!


Someone uploaded a torrent with the full episodes to that date. In that torrent, the 4th season was split in 2 and the second part of it was named 5th. Again, the current season that airs on Fox is 5th.

Okay, it's not important what season is this, but I can't stand someone calling me names because of it's own stupidity."
,kango99,2007-03-04T00:55Z,"Yeah, I'm another one who never got why these ""scene"" fuckwits keep mislabeling seaons to confuse everyone. Not just this, but elsewhere too.

But Worse, much, much worse and even more fuckwittier, WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH THE RAR'S??

If you retarded h@ck3R-k1dd13 dudes want to play around on usenet, then go fucking do it. 
This is BITTORRENT, specially designed for distrubuting large files that people can watch, listen to and use whatever the fuck way they want whilst STILL SEEDING. You fucking misfit morons are actually hurting torrent speed and it's time to wise up. 

It's getting a little fucking pathetic"
,teimu,2007-03-15T05:31Z,"i dont think speed is gimped at all. while rars are inconvienient for viewing when downloading, rars compress so theres less data to be transferred. people get thier files faster. and luckily, piratebay doesnt enforce ratios, so even seeders looking for more ups wont hurt.

i will say i dont really like the series of rars. im not sure if there's a significant compression advantage to ""parting"" rars, but its just seems like overkill. one file, rar or not, is good enough for me."
,pacive,2007-03-18T11:26Z,"Another point to the raring, when people put a 8mb sample as well (in this file 2 samples for some reason) the total size goes up, not down...

why don't just publish it as the original file, and save everybody a little bit of work and frustration ;)"
,torpsta1,2007-06-09T09:13Z,thanks dude
,fackakid666,2007-11-21T08:30Z,"why download when unpackd, whats s god with it anyways it only takes space"
,Abjuration,2007-11-28T22:53Z,Just adding the name of the episode in a comment would be a lot more helpful than using 20 comments discussing if you want to call it 609 or 509..
,solidnem,2008-01-15T06:13Z,"This is NOT the real episode, fake."
,hacky2311,2008-01-18T17:35Z,"This is an old episode... It's from season 5, and it's call Road to Rupert (Where stewies teddybear accidentaly gets sold during a garage sale) So TOO BAD for thoose who downloaded it :)"
