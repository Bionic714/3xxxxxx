If you have not listen to Jack Kornfield before you really should. This stuff is absolutely great. In my collection of spiritual/philosophical media i got many 100 gigabytes of data and i can honestly say that Jack Kornfields stuff is kind of the crown jewels of it all. The first time i initially heard Kornfield i kind of wondered which kind of sedative medication he was on, but after a very short while his personality really makes more than perfect sense. Intelligent, interesting, wise, and a lot of humour. He often illustrates stuff with some tales or legends or with stories from real life which is great because he is a absolutely wonderful storyteller. 
Kornfield has been trained as buddhist monk in Burma, Thailand and India for many years and later got a Ph.D in psychology. You do not at all have to be into buddhism to find this material highly interesting and valuable.
