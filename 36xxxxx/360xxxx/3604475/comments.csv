,marcus2k8,2007-01-27T01:23Z,"I cannot see how you can get around the validation tests with a download like this, someone let me know if it works or is it another virus. "
,madjock56R,2007-01-27T01:38Z,"It looks like a bunch of pictures with an Nfo file.

Why not paste in what to do, rather than downloading 16mb of pictures.

Bollox.

It will the timer stop, which is available everywhere."
,Hero^,2007-01-27T01:39Z,"This Is not a Validation test.
He just shows that he passes the Validation test 
on Microsoft Download page.
When u are trying download something on MS download page u have to pass the validation test, and he passes.
In his READ ME File he write what Vista version he used and what crack he use, he also shared some screenshots on the test, before and after, and i could see some of the updates he did with ULTIMATE Extras i think.
If u look on the time stamps i sure looks like he really passed thier validation test."
,marcus2k8,2007-01-27T01:41Z,"thanks for the confirmation, there are ways but fed up with all the rubbish downloads with stuff attached with them, anyone got any ideas?"
,Hero^,2007-01-27T01:42Z,"As long u are inside the 30 day test time u are able to download anything that a baought ULTIMATE user can do.

Well, U think out It your self wjat happens if u stop the countdown !

U need something else then just be able to download their updates ???"
,madjock56R,2007-01-27T01:42Z,"Well Ultimates extras is not activated yet. So thats crap.

And all you need is to stop the timers in Vista which is written everywhere on the web.

There is no proper hack for Ultimate Vista.

You can register Business edition with the KMS server side or whatever its called.

But Ultimate is not cracked, only held in limbo."

,Hero^,2007-01-27T01:54Z,"Yet again !!!

What the link:
http://keznews.com/
 says !!


Offcourse There are some trojan's  In ""some"" Vista versions.

Must be damn hard to keep such a thing as a OP system secret and away from leaking,.
Im running the same OP as the torrent sharer is doing and proberbly used the same crack ""stop the clock"" patch as I self call It.

The only thing i did was to stop the clock, Otherwise EVERYTHING Is working OK, not any problems at all installing software or drivers, this is the 8th day Im runnig 6.0.6000 version, and where Is all the problems that everyone Is talking about ?
No Horses of any kind or malicious things.

Give It a try, Install an a second Partition, does It fuck up ???, just format the partition then, but then u at least have tested this Trojan, malicious Vista !"
,madjock56R,2007-01-27T02:05Z,They just mention Trojans to scare people off from downloading. There is probably more problems from a Windows install in itself.
,Hero^,2007-01-27T02:13Z,"And i think this:

The smart one's Is not the people making the OP's, the smart one's Is the ""nerdie"" computer 24h a day's geeks, that are giving their life to internet, programig, tweaking and other stuff.

As soon any software Is release there are always someone that test It's weakness.

As in this Vista, It works for the time, but will MS figuer a way out to get rid of all these that have stoped the 30 day test period ?
And  If they do, how long u thing It will take untill some computer geek finds a way around It again ?

Will run on It as long as it work fine......

,Hero^,2007-01-27T02:16Z,"And Swede_77 !!
------------------

Miner Bad thing:

Write more carefully next time on what u are putting up, In this case It was not as bad 16mb or 2 minutes of wasted time, does It matter ??
No It sure doesen't...

Good Thing:

Nice screens.."
,Hero^,2007-01-27T02:35Z,"Pasted from: http://keznews.com/ 

""""""""Microsoft has quietly admitted that it has already found three different workarounds to SPP. It says it can defeat one, dubbed the Frankenbuild because of its cobbling together of code from beta and final versions of Vista. It hasn?t yet announced success against several other cracks, including one seemingly inspired by Y2k, which allows Vista to run unactivated until the year 2099 rather than for just 30 days.""""""""


We sure will notice when the are pulling up a new SPP againt the 2099 crack, but until then It's free."
