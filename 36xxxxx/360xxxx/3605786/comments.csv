,Gorzilla,2007-01-29T10:22Z,"Thanks zlusterdenver!
one short question: why is the size of your releases ~280 MB instead of the commonly used 350 MB - no noticeable difference?

btw: Mini Series is doing well! :)

@basabas: lol"
,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-01-29T10:41Z,"Gorzilla:

This release and the last ~280mb release where from standard definition source, the orenji release I believe is from a HDTV source. 

I do not resize my rip, I only convert it to xvid, I do not even turn down the bitrate, leaving it in the best possible quality for the source. Where I even to turn on moderate compression I could lower the filesize quite a bit without any appreciable quality loss, however I figured that since I am already below the 350mb mark, i wont bother to drop the filesize down any.

If you look at my release sidebyside with the orenji release you will see the pixel size is smaller on my release. Thats really the main difference.

How close are you on the two HD mini series files?"
