,jlivings10,2007-11-03T21:38Z,"You need a bit torrent client(like utorrent). There are many bit torrent clients. utorrent is a popular one as works well with a small impact on your cpu, its the only one I've ever used. Depends on how you like to work things and your computer(mine sucks, thats why I like utorrent)."
,jlivings10,2007-11-04T01:00Z,"Try using this tracker URL http://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
My torrents weren't connecting until I changed my tracker to this."
,quezicotl,2008-05-25T11:14Z,"you should just use frostwire, just download as a frostwire document and it automatically starts downloading."
,thegooch666,2008-12-08T12:18Z,"@ vitriol1 - Where did you download it from because I can't get this one to download even after I added the extra tracker, please help it's been stuck on 0.5% for 1 1/2 days, usually by now I would of given up but I can't find it anywhere else."
