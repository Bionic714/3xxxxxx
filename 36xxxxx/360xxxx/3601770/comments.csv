It was sourced from the Lost in Space full dvd download also on this site.

I have quite slow upload (stupid UK), so it took me a full day to seed the first round, but now after 26 hours there are at least 24 other seeds, so there should be no problem getting this from now on."

,Spacecab,2007-08-30T10:38Z,Audio and Video Quality is very good on this movie loosely based on the 1960's TV series. Great Job!
