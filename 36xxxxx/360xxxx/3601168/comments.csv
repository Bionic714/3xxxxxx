,Cofia,2007-01-23T10:03Z,"Thanks for sharing the file. I did´nt get a whole episode, just 1 min (7,61Kb) in the sample dir. What did I do wrong? Do I have to unpack the avi.file or anything?"
,trixtah,2007-01-25T09:35Z,"Cofia - it's a bunch of RAR files and you need an unrar tool to ""unzip"" them. I don't know why people do this, since an AVI is already compressed, and bittorrent breaks up the file into little chunks.

7-zip is a Windows tool that will unpack it (http://www.7-zip.org/). I'll be uploading an unrared file once I download it."
,Cofia,2007-01-28T21:40Z,Thanks Trixtah
