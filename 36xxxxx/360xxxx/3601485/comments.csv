,czechmate67,2007-05-09T00:08Z,Going Slooowly- more seeds pleease?
,Fahrenheit,2007-07-08T23:05Z,Someone please seed this...!
,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-07-23T20:29Z,"Reseeding now, this took many weeks for the swarm to get to full speed initially, and it may take a while to even get a full copy in the swarm. Help this LARGE seed out by seeding for awhile after finishing download! Thanks Everyone!"
,hawkjm73,2007-08-14T19:14Z,"I can't get any audio out of this one, but part 2 is fine.  Gspot says I have the correct audio codec installed.  Any ideas?"
,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-08-15T21:40Z,"Just about the only thing I can imagine is something got corrupted in your download, I might have a workaround for you, lemme check on it, shoot me an email when you read this."
,s20dan,2008-01-16T16:57Z,"Damn, I have the exact problem... No audio on part one.... Now I KNOW its my pc, coz I have another pc that plays it with audio... so, what codecs are you guys using please? Im using the CCCP which should in theory handl;e this with no problem"
,beeng,2008-07-11T02:11Z,"I have audio, but it;s only 2 channel... it 'says' it is 5.1, but only 2 of the channels work."
,3261dan,2008-10-20T19:46Z,Btw the audio problem a few of us had was caused by not having the correct audio filters activated.
