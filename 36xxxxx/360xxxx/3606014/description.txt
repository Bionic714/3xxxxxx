These songs was not made for you, I made them to myself.
I dont care what you say, or if you listen to it. I just wanted to share these songs with you who dont care about this life. For you who live on the edge of insanity, for you who dont know what to do.

I am gonna put out some songs here in time, as i record them.

These song are gonna be recorded in London at the end of april for the Death blues record.
