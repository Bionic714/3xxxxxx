,rowborough,2007-01-21T18:57Z,"Shame that Chaplins singing voice was legendary, and the Zorro musical numbers are the dogs :)

Nosferatu  has a bit of a thick german accent however, subs would probably help now I think about it......

Told you it was back......."
,rowborough,2007-01-21T20:13Z,"Ignore these PB figs, I will seed for at least two weeks or 20x and as of now we have 45 people downloading, so 0,0 numbers are just bulshit.

PB are probably counting my donation to buy a island, I have given a days tackings so all you other people - PUT YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS (it may come to nought but ask yourselves - as I did - how many £££ worth of stuff have we all downloaded from them ?)


Give money and lets hope the guys at PB piss it up the wall.

They deserve it........................"
