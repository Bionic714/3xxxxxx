,lewtang,2007-02-04T01:42Z,can u burn this to DL disc and run on dvd player?
,FlyingFrisia,2007-02-10T10:27Z,Stuck at 99.9%. The jpg's won't even show and the (incomplete) dvd-files won't load in my windows media classic-player; I'm afraid this is a hoax.
,enemix,2007-04-16T12:07Z,"Got the whole torrent down and can't even open the JPGs, and nothing works, and when I search around a bit I see this torrent is flagged as ""fake"" on other sites >_"
