Since the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the United States has been engaged in an all-
out war on terror. Nevertheless, terrorist attacks that are believed to be 
linked to the international terrorist organization Al-Qaeda continue to be 
perpetrated around the world. And behind the violence, Al-Qaeda is attacking 
its perceived enemies in another, lesser-known way: through the media. 

Research conducted by NHK in various locations recently yielded a glimpse of 
al-Qaeda\'s media war. A secretive al-Qaeda media group known as As-Sahaab 
produces propaganda videos on an ongoing basis using advanced computer graphics 
and video processing techniques and distributes them on video CDs and via the 
Internet for viewing by Muslims all over the world. At the same time, 
As-Sahaab skillfully manipulates a satellite television station in the Middle 
East as a way of using the airwaves to spread messages intended to justify 
terrorism in the eyes of the world. Al-Qaeda?s media output is believed to 
inspire yet more terrorist acts. The United States government is devoting huge 
financial resources to countering al-Qaeda?s propaganda but has yet to achieve 
major success.
