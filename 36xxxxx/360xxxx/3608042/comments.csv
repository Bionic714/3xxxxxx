,orbitmansion,2007-02-13T20:25Z,"Got an issue with this - it installs fine and works great, however even though I have changed the map to the UK & Ireland one and even removed the Guam map, I cannot search on UK POSTCODES. The only option is Dutch postcodes !

What file can I replace, or is there a map with FULL UK postcodes.

I remember on TT5 the option to be able to type in the whole postcode, but with V6.00 you could only put half the postcode - with this, it's just Dutch postcodes !

HELP !"
,orbitmansion,2007-02-13T23:08Z,"okay, so I worked out the problem !! In the ""zip"" folder there's only the ""nederland.postal"" file...so....

Does anyone have the FULL UK POSTCODE file that will work with TTN6 ?

Please ?

,orbitmansion,2007-02-15T16:29Z,"Okay, so if anyone's interested at all...
