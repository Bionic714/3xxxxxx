,overlydiatonic,2007-01-31T03:19Z,"Also, I tried testing the flacs, and they test fine, and the jpeg _looks_ fine, so maybe it's the OCR text (back ocr.doc) that's not finishing. The text in there looks a little garbled to me, but I assumed it was the program I'm using to view it (I don't have the real Microsoft Word). Anyway, at least the audio is fine even if the whole torrent won't finish."

,agiantalienforce,2007-02-01T16:56Z,"i believe flac's are ok. azureus tells that front.jpg and txt file didn't complete, but they are ok. probably just a hash error. "

Sophos is reporting a trojan in the front.jpg
which might explain the problem here."
,lddtaz,2007-02-16T04:03Z,"I have no idea what the problem is
I can recreate the torrent file
perhaps when I created it the word file was open and a tmp file was also in the directory
I am re-uploading the corrected torrent file
(is there a way to simply update an old one?)"
