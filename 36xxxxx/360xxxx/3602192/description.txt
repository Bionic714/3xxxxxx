The Fluoride Deception: An Interview with Christopher Bryson 
In this video, award-winning journalist Christopher Bryson examines "one of the great secret narratives of the industrial era; how a grim workplace poison and the most damaging environmental pollutant of the cold war was added to our drinking water and toothpaste."

That pollutant is fluoride. In this video, Bryson explains the findings of his highly-praised book, The Fluoride Deception.

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, "After reading Bryson's account of our national infatuation with fluoride, it's hard not to wonder how we could have ignored so serious an issue for so long."
