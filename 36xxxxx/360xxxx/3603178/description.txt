Dark Reign: The Future of War.

Description
Dark Reign narrowly beat Total Annihilation as the first RTS to
incorporate 3D movement and positioning. This increases the strategic
advantage of hills and mountains. Each mission puts you in the role.
of commander of either the Imperial army or the Freedom fighters
in a campaign to undermine and eventually destroy the opposing force.
This game has many unusual features for the RTS genre. AI patterns
you to simply give a unit the order "Search and Destroy" and it
would drive off towards the enemy's last known location, in search
for something to kill. There is also "explore" mode which let your
units do all the map exploring for you. A mission/campaign editor
is also provided.
