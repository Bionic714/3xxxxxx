,Zensch,2007-06-05T00:34Z,"Nice torrent, always wanted to try Dark Reign but never got around to it.

Hope it works!"
,Zensch,2007-06-06T13:01Z,"Dark Reign works just fine, no compatibility problems with WinXP. It complains a few times about the system not meeting the requirements and DirectX not being installed, just ignore those and continue installing.

Still need another 10% to grab the expansion and the sequel ;)

Great game for such an old RTS!"

,BotFreak,2008-04-21T17:34Z,"Your DR2 game install is incomplete..its missing several files...missions,mods,packs,sides,worlds,addons etc...also the total of the file should be around 378mbs...the pad files r not needed to run the game...you might get this to install but it wont play without the right folders :/
for the complete instructions on how to fix your download go to the mojo site and read the info"
,grasmanek94,2008-12-24T12:06Z,"DR2 is just fun but the servers are down :? so i decided to help us making an hamachi network so we can play online and even send maps if you have a router!!!
you can download hamachi at www.hamachi.cc
(it will redirect you to a site like this: https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/vpn.asp?lang=nl)
when u have installed hamachi and dr2 u don't need any settings in the multiplayer options. just join the network i hamachi that i created.
network name: darkreignnetwork
password       : dr2
when u have done that all just start hamachi be online , launch dr2 and click NETWORK(LAN)
(dont choose the WON servers because they are down)
there is a chat on hamachi so we can talk before the host so you don't need any messenger programs ex gadu-gadu or MSN live messenger...
hope i helped you :D
And jou can download dr2 from www.mojo2go.we.bs/downloads.html but here iss the original version. I've downloded it and it works perfect! at the setup it will just w8 5min at 99% but the game is original and works!!HX 2 you."

I right click dark reign Icon click explore and tried to run it from there but it ask for the CD.....so where is the crack? and where do I paste it?"
,Squez007,2009-12-03T04:30Z,"ok well, I figure out the directX thing no problem but, I still need a crack. "
,diryde,2010-02-26T00:42Z,"Dark Reign worked fine until I installed the Shadowhand expansion, now Dark Reign crashes as soon as a level starts loading, saying it can't find the ""eomedfl0.spr"" file"

,Ozzen,2012-01-21T22:46Z,The Original DR worked fine but upon installing the Expansion it keeps crashing.
,uruivan,2012-04-15T04:56Z,"first off, thank you ""eyezin"" for the torrent, i remember playing this game when i was a child. Now, regrettably I seem to have encountered the same problem as ""Squez007"" ""SittingDog"" and ""thesmallbus"", am i supposed to move the patch somewhere before running it?, and it says finished but some signs pop up saying something wasn't done right...

win 7 here, help. please."
,BloodBay,2012-05-15T16:57Z,"Guys fucking seed.. -_- stop fucking leaching and start seeding god damnit. im just trying to download one of my all time favorite games and cant due to little peckerwood leachers ! start fucking seeding!! >:D

Thanks, BloodBay"
,CruxisCrystal,2012-08-10T19:42Z,"Ok, so my problem with this Dark Reign is that when I launch it and I am on the menu screen the graphics i.e. the colors are pretty messed up and I can't read any text. I know this probably has to do with the screen resolution but making it compatible to 640 by 480 and making it win95 compatible didn't do squat either. Tried to change my screen resolution from 1920 by 1080 to 640 by 480 but the lowest mine can go is 800 by 600 and launching the game at the res, well at least I can read the text but the colors are still seriously messed up. This graphical problem reminds me of Thief Gold where the game will not run on modern widescreens unless you dled a specific patch.. It's a shame though I really wanted to play this game but I can't because of this issue :( "
,CruxisCrystal,2012-08-10T22:47Z,"Ok, please disregard my last comment. I downloaded the 1.7 patched version which has the nocd fix into the game and I found out how to avoid the messed up colors without having to compromise my screen resolution. :)"
