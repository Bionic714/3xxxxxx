Jeg er SÅ træt af at jeg ikke har logget min traffik nu, f'ck jeg gad godt vide hvordan det er sket? Men anyways, hvis der sidder nogen derude og tænker ""det var mig"" med et bredt smil på læberne, så tak tak tak tak tak! Den er for FEEED at vågne til denne film!"

,Pyrusdk,2007-02-01T18:10Z,ZapBeeb - thank you for the info...... now its done.
,The Soft Touch,2007-02-02T19:16Z,"Tak for filmen, men hvorfor er den stoppet ved 99.9%????????????????? hvad sker der????????
her har jeg stået i 2 dage nu??????????????????"
,PrincessDVDR,2007-02-03T23:32Z,"You have to download the torrent file here from this page, i deleted the other one, dont delete your files, just get this new torrent file and point it to your folder, and you will have 100% pretty soon"
,lcc,2007-02-04T12:33Z,"jeg sidder også fast på 99,9%, men hvordan for jeg denne torrent til at pege hen på de gamle filer jeg allerde har downloadet?"
,PrincessDVDR,2007-02-04T15:43Z,"First choose remove torrent from your program, not the files just the torrent, then download the new torrent file from this page, then add the torrent in your program and choose to ""download"" it in the same folder as before, now the torrent program will begin to check all your files, when its done you will be at 99.9% again, but you will get 100% in a matter of minutes, i hope."
,SiriusStar,2007-02-04T22:04Z,"Is the ""Akari - The Killing Of A Japanese Photographer"" also on this?"
,PrincessDVDR,2007-02-04T22:39Z,"Yes SiruisStar, the only thing removed from the extras is the 1 hour conversation with that porn actor. it took up around 2.8gb alone on the disc"
,Ghostis,2007-02-20T16:15Z,ingen som har en med engelsk eller svensk text???
,MortenMel,2007-02-24T16:30Z,"Okay, I downloaded the files and unpacked the ISO to my harddrive. Now what am I supposed to do to watch the movie? I have tried burning the ISO as an image-file on a data DVD with Nero, but it just puts the ISO on the DVD and neither my DVD-player or computer can play it as a movie. What do i do?"
,PrincessDVDR,2007-03-05T22:07Z,"Unless you already found the solution to your problem MortenMel, you can do 2 things to watch the movie, either download daemon tools from the web (do a google search) and then ""mount"" the iso (means open it) then it will appear as a virtual dvd drive, and then you can watch the movie on your pc with a program like PowerDVD. The other choice is to do sort of what you have been trying to do, most versions of Nero (also the old ones) will allow you to burn an image, you should go to your menu and choose file, and then open image, point to the princess.iso file and then it should be the iso as a dvd disc instead of an iso file on a dvd, i hope this helps!"
,S!R3,2007-03-19T22:56Z,"Hey awesome to find this movie up here, does anyone know there to find good english or swedish subs? it would be helpful- thanx again"
,S!R3,2007-03-19T23:02Z,"sorry about the fucked up spelling, but btw i was trying to run some subs on 'the story of O' that i had downloaded separately but they were only there in the beginning and then disappeared altogether. They were also ca. 9 seconds off, and when i tried to delay them 9 secs nothing happened. the file is .mkv format and i played it in VLC..."
,danar_fe,2007-05-01T17:24Z,i need to know one think. subtitle in english?

Thanks again"
,stuart0305,2008-04-06T12:29Z,"I know, if you don't have anything nice to say...
But trust me on this one, fellas. This movie is the crappiest cartoon EVER.
It's long, slow, pretentious and build on one cliche, then replaced by another cliche. not worth your time to watch and definitely not worth the download.

1/10 because its nice to see european cartoon in serious film generes, just not this one in particular. do yourself a favour, don't even bother yrself with this one. trust me."
