THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION OF THE GAME.

IT IS INTERNAL BECAUSE THE "SCENE" IS SO COOL
THAT A GROUP WILL DUPE WITH RETAIL AND CALL
IT A "PROPER" JUST CAUSE A COUPLE DATES &
BYTES MAY BE DIFFERENT. THEN AGAIN GROUPS
KNOW NOTHING OF HOW GAMES ARE MADE. THEY ARE
JUST THERE FOR THEIR SKILLED ISO RIPPING
SKILLZ. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO USE ANY SAVES,
CHEAT DEVICES, ETC. WITH THIS GAME BECAUSE
EVENTHOUGH RETAIL WILL HAVE MINOR FILE 
DIFFERENCES, THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION
AND EXACT SAME GAME.

ENJOY THIS GAME!!!

THIS IS THE REAL DEAL SO CHECK IT OUT: DOWNLOAD/BURN/PLAY

TESTED & WORKS PERFECT WITH SWAP MAGIC
