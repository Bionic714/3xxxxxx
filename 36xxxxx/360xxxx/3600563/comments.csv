Seed you selfish bastards. you know that the reason most ppl download slow, is because they leech. All Torrent programs have a function that gives you faster Download speed the more you seed.

,Joo-hyun,2008-05-27T14:02Z,"To ExCoelis at 2008-05-02 04:03

the reason your transfer rate is lower than usual is either of the following reasons:
1. The leechers are not balanced with the seeders, this usually leaves people hanging at 95%
2. If your quite early into downloading this torrent, leave it for a while. It should go up later!

Hope I've helped = )"

,rasmusx15,2008-06-25T20:05Z,"To all of you who don't know how to Mount a image:

In common use, an ""ISO"" file is a single file that contains the complete image of a disc. Such files are often used when transferring CD-ROM images over the Internet.

In this guide I will be showing you how to mount a "".ISO"" image in a virtual drive to play/watch it.

First thing you need to do is download DAEMON Tools if you haven't already. You can download it here. http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

Once you have installed and started DAEMON tools, you should now see a ""lightning bolt"" icon next to your PC clock.

Go ahead and right click that icon and then left click ""VIRTUAL CD/DVD-ROM"" , then left click ""Set number of devices..."", then decide on how many virtual drives you wish to have. For this tutorial I only choose ""1 drive"".

After that, go ahead and right click that ""lightning bolt"" icon again, left click ""VIRTUAL CD/DVD-ROM"" again. Then left click ""Device 0: [*Letter*] No media"", then left click ""Mount image"". 

Then on the screen that pops up, navigate to where your ISO file is to mount it to the virtual drive. When you find it, click it once then click the ""Open"" button.

If the ISO file is a game (like here, Company of Heroes), the games install-screen should pop up, just like it was a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.

If the ISO file is a movie, it will act just like you put a DVD in. It will ask you what you want windows to do. Either pick a task for it to follow or cancel it and do your own thing if the program you want to use is not listed there.

Ok your finished with loading the image. 

Now if you go to ""My Computer"", you will see a ""extra"" drive listed there . That is the ""virtual drive"" created by DAEMON Tools. 

To remove it, right click that icon and then left click ""VIRTUAL CD/DVD-ROM"" , then left click ""Set number of devices..."", then click ""Disable"".

POOF! Its gone!

So this was a basic guide on how to mount/watch ISO image files with DAEMON Tools.

Cheers from mee... xD"

After fondling the files for a little while, I'd finally gotten it to install. After the install it's been nothing but a perfect upload for me.

I haven't played online, however, and I don't ever really plan too unless another Hamachi comes out."

Don't use ISO or PowerISO or MagicISO."

2) Find the downloaded file and un-rar the 1st Rar file..

3) Mount the ISO file on a program like Magic Disc, Power ISO, Daemon Tools.

Your a complete idiot. First of all, not everyone knows about computers, that doesent mean they shouldent be allowed into filesharing. Im glad people that dont know anything or very little about computers are on here trying. it means they are trying to learn, and are helping the movement of filesharing that much more. and also, how do you think people learn, when i first started file sharing i dident know a damn thing, i was lost on how to mount an iso, or unrar files. or where to put the crack. its a learning process, and im about 99.999999% sure that u werent born knowing it either. please everyone, feel free to ask as many times as u like, and dont listen to this person."

I see your point, neko4ever is just being a shit head and dosent understand the stages of learning. I think he is just one of those people (like me sometimes) who get frustrated sifting through the comments to find out how to install, and you have to admit some people ask ""How do you install?"" before reading all the comments, and that just clogs up the comments panel and makes it harder to find how to install. 

Like neko4ever said:

1) Download

2) Find the downloaded file and un-rar the 1st Rar file..

3) Mount the ISO file on a program like Magic Disc, Power ISO, Daemon Tools.

4) Install

5) Play

,killerrj8,2011-08-02T13:52Z,"@Herpydurr Dude u have to unrar the files first. I am currently downloading. But most of the time there is one rar file without a number , this is what u usually need to unrar.THEN you will most likely get the ISO in the folder u have just ""created"" or whereever u have unzipped it."
,the_4us,2011-08-05T12:46Z,"@iRedBloodNL search for the RUN.exe or annything like this.. when i wrote this, my download was not completed, so i actually dont know the name of the file, but like i wrote, just look for autorun, run, something with run, or just the game name, LOOK IN THE FOLDER WHERE U SAVED IN, lolz this commnt looks idiot but i hope i helped u."

,mobinc,2011-09-07T05:39Z,is this a iso file?
,us01,2011-09-21T06:03Z,"Works!

Download all 3 games, have serials for each, install them, then patch to latest 2.602., then use crack for tales of valor. Very simple.

If you download only COH and no expansions, you should not update/patch, as that can lead to problems, if you want to update you have to get the expansion, because only the expansion have been cracked in consideration of the updates/patches.

I don't know what people are talking about unlocking stuff, i don't know what features are in COH that i might be missing, but i have 4 factions so im all good.

Sadly online doesn't work, i cant even create an account. But it works single player and maybe even lan.

I was thinking of buying COH, but now having tested it out once again, i wont, the AI is retarded, cheap, so thats that. Good game though. "

,dannyx_xxtreme,2011-10-12T21:56Z,"and imo neko4ever is just a bit over reacting , i think he has a good point bcause there are always comments about how to instal and about problems u may encounter while instaling the game and some ppl just do nt check other comments they just ask again the same question that has been answerd before . anyway as i told u before i think pirate bay has a great comunity.

""Failed To Set A Working Mode For The Rendering Device. This could be due to having an old version of Directx installed.""

,Vdentis,2012-03-22T17:24Z,People who can't get this to work shouldn't download it. Use google or something and learn how to crack(and where it is) a game or where you can find serials.
,Somacruz_92,2012-04-07T14:54Z,"Have a problem, it's not the torrents fault, but someone here might be able to help... when I try install this, it says it's already installed. I had it installed before but couldn't re-install properly. Checked regedit and everything but can't find any registry of it."
,TheGenral,2012-04-16T18:52Z,"For anyone looking to get new maps for this version of COH, anything made 2007 or earlier should work for vanilla COH, nothing, absolutely nothing with an SGA file format will work with this version of COH, as that was invented for Opposing Fronts and later versions. 
Oh and to anyone who successfully gets this torrent to work and install, dont waste your time patching it passed v1.71, Opposing Fronts isnt exactly that good, while some of the new factions were pretty inventive there are alot of things that could have been done better."

,Somacruz_92,2012-06-09T02:15Z,"@maloxan42
Are YOU retarded?
I've downloaded and installed games like this for years, tried to run all the setups, tried to mess around in appdata/roaming too to see if any registry was in there, went into regedit. Before you call anyone retarded, please use your brain first."
,Kamianbu,2012-07-01T11:04Z,"@Somacruz_92

If you can't find anything manually in the registry, download CCleaner. If there is any trace of COH in the registry, it should find it for you to delete.

If that fails, get the perfect uninstaller. If CoH has been installed on your comp before and for whatever if you deleted it or something. This should uninstall it completely and remove any trace files from your comp allowing you to install it again without problems"
