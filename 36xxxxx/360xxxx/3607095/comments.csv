This is so much more than about ID cards. It shows how the government in cooperation with private entities impose illegal taxes, jail people without just cause and refuse to even show with support of what laws they claim to do this. 
With a risk of being branded now, US is developing very much according to ""protocol of the elders of zion"".  Whether that document was hoax or not it is happening. 
1) Inflation as hidden tax (mainly affecting poor and middle class)
2) controlled media
3) controlled politicians (leading to fascism)
4) control of money/fiat currency (FED & IRS)
5) Confiscation of peoples gold. (Leasing of CB/Fed gold to bullion banks without hope of getting it back - read GATA.org)
6) Dumbening of people and focus on entertainment rather than real issues
7) Staged wars and made up enemies
8) Building of concentration camps allaround US
(To be used for illegal immigrants they say. Yeah, pull the other one. The camps are large enough to house in total several million people, have guard towers, many with gas piping prepared and next to train stations. Sound familliar?  Look up on youtube or possibly prisonplanet for fotage.)"
,seej,2007-01-31T16:06Z,"Peaknik, I agree with you that 'Protocol of the wankers of zion' is a hoax. But are you insinuating that the US government is using it as a roadmap?

Many of the points you mentioned are actually characteristics (or flaws) of liberal democracy i.e. they are built in to liberal democracies all over the world.

1) Inflation as hidden tax: inflation is a natural result of any form of tax - it doesn't need to be hidden. When the government taxes you, it does so to spend money on your behalf. When it spends the money, it is decreasing the unemployment rate. As the unemployment rate decreases, the inflation rate increases. Look at it this way: when people are saving, the inflation rate goes down, and when people are spending (on taxes) the inflation rate goes up.

2) controlled media: as opposed to what? Uncontrolled media is only a metaphysical possibility, because it is the absence of communication. That media are controlled is a given. Neither is the issue that the media have an agenda. Media minus agenda is the definition of inanity. The real issue is the _quality_ of the agenda.

3) controlled politicians: an uncontrolled politician is a dead politician. If you are talking about organised control, then that has been a phenomenon since the invention of party whips and is nothing new.

4) control of money: again, what is uncontrolled money?

5) confiscation of people's gold: I am not an American so this not something I know much about.

6) Dumbening of people and focus on entertainment rather than real issues: Again, this is a feature of liberal democracy. I have read Chomsky, and I agree with his arguments. But the irony is that his fans and critics alike make the same mistake when they think he is suggesting that 'dumbening' is a government policy - it is a feature/flaw of the way that contemporary media works.

7) Staged wars and made up enemies: I have watched 'The Power of Nightmares' and I tend to agree with the arguments put forward. But that isn't fascism - it's spin.

8) Building of concentration camps all around US: again, I am not American so this is something I know little about. The Internet and documentaries are probably the worst place to conduct research."
,seej,2007-02-01T16:18Z,"I don't watch Fox News, or any other news channel for that matter.

You write:

""2) A free press is when people report the story, not the story with the most political/financial backing.""

Assuming that controlled means ""controlled by humans"", we know that the opposite of ""controlled media"" (uncontrolled media) is not even theoretically possible -- at least _meaningful_ uncontrolled media is impossible anyway, because sunlight is an uncontrolled medium that carries data (but no information, therefore it is meaningless).

Look, believe me, I am an anarchist at heart. Sometimes I think that there are certain problems that can only be solved with the dissolution of currencies and any form of leadership. But then again, wouldn't that be cutting off our nose to spite our face? I cannot comprehend global communication without the existence of a monetary system.

Other times I think Kant was right when he wrote, ""This problem is the most difficult and the last to be solved by mankind.... Man is an animal which, if it lives among others of its kind, requires a master. For he certainly abuses his freedom with respect to other men, and although as, a reasonable being he wishes to have a law which limits the freedom of all, his selfish animal impulses tempt him, where possible, to exempt himself from them. He thus requires a master, who will break his will and force him to obey a will that is universally valid, under which each can be free. But whence does he get this master? Only from the human race. But then the master is himself an animal, and needs a master.""

Anyway, I think that is excellent observation that certainly applies today, even though it was written in 1784."
,seej,2007-02-02T10:47Z,"I agree with you that it is not the world per se that is out of control - it is the people in power who are. So this is the fundamental problem: how do we control the people that are out of control? But that is a paradox - because someone who controls everyone else is by definition out of control i.e. not controlled by anyone else. This is why Kant as says, ""This problem is the most difficult and the last to be solved by mankind."""

--------------------------------------------------

Every year, tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars are quietly added to the U.S. national debt -- on top of the deficits that we hear about. What's going on?

By Scott Burns
November 21, 2007

When it comes to financial magic, the government of the United States takes the prize. Sleights of hand and clever distractions by purveyors of line-of-credit mortgages, living-benefit variable annuities and equity-indexed life insurance are clumsy parlour tricks compared with the Big Magic of American politicians.

Consider the proud trumpeting that came from Washington at the close of fiscal 2007. The deficit for the unified budget was, politicians crowed, down to a mere $162.8 billion.

In fact, the U.S. government is overspending at a far greater rate. The total federal debt actually increased by $497.1 billion over the same period.

But politicians of both parties use happy numbers to distract American voters. Democrats routinely criticize the Republican administration for crippling deficits, but they politely use the least-damaging figure, the $162.8 billion. Why? Because references to more-realistic accounting would reveal vastly greater numbers and implicate both parties.

You can understand how this is done by taking a close look at a single statement on U.S. federal finance from the president's Council of Economic Advisers. The September statement shows that the ""on-budget"" numbers produced a deficit of $344.3 billion in fiscal 2007. The ""off-budget"" numbers had a surplus of $181.5 billion. (The off-budget figures are dominated by Social Security, Medicare and other programs with trust funds.)

Combine those two figures and you get the unified budget, that $162.8 billion. In the past eight years there's been two years of reported surpluses and six years of reported deficits. Altogether, the total reported deficit has run $1.3 trillion.

Some numbers don't add up 
But if you examine another figure, the gross U.S. federal debt, you'll see something strange. First, the U.S. debt has increased in each of the past eight years, even in the two years when surpluses were reported. Second, the gross federal debt, which includes the obligations held by the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, has increased much faster than the deficits -- about $3.3 trillion over the same eight years.

That's $2 trillion more than the reported $1.3 trillion in deficits over the period. Can you spell ""Enron""?

In other words, while the reported deficits averaged $164 billion over the past eight years, U.S. government debt increased an average of $418 billion a year. That's a lot more than twice as much.

How could this happen?

Easy. The U.S. Treasury Department simply credits the Social Security, Medicare and other trust funds with interest payments in the form of new Treasury obligations. No cash is actually paid. The trust funds magically increase in value with a bookkeeping entry. It represents money the American government owes itself.

So what happens if the funny money is taken away?

When the imaginary interest payments are included, Social Security and Medicare are running at a tranquilizing surplus (that $181.5 billion mentioned earlier). But measure actual cash, and the surplus disappears.

In 2005, for instance, the U.S. Social Security Disability Income program started to run at a cash loss. 2007 is the first year that Medicare Part A (the hospital insurance program) benefits exceeded income.

The same thing will happen to the U.S. Social Security retirement-income program in six to nine years, depending on which of the trustees' estimates you use. During the same period, the expenses of Medicare Part B and Part D, which are paid out of general tax revenue, will rise rapidly.

Despite this, the U.S. Social Security Administration writes workers every year advising them that the program will have a problem 34 years from now, not six or nine years. In fact, the real problem is al"
