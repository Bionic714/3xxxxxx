        Synopsis

After losing their first baby in a world where it has become illegal to bear more than one, John and Karen Brennick dare to have another. Caught trying to cross the border, the ex-war hero and his pregnant wife are sentenced to a sadistic, futuristic prison buried 33 stories beneath the earth. Computers control inmates bodies and minds, and newborn infants are being used to create a new breed of human robots. No one has ever gotten out alive.
