,KillerBob666,2007-01-31T23:30Z,Why do ppl ask questions about size and stuff in here??? Why do they even bother to download shit if they can use it?
,DRAC2GUNZ,2007-04-14T09:50Z,"fmasloly ... you must be a retard. Any QUALITY movie like this one deservers to be seen in the best possible quality, and 1080p is one of those. TY for upload."
,Pyatin,2008-10-24T10:29Z,"Keep the quality high.  have the people cut the size on their own.  Don't give people ""YOUR"" version.  Let them make up their own minds.  So it takes a millenia to DL.  It's worth the wait, or go buy the movie yourselves.  no need to be impatient."
