,UMe2,2007-02-06T17:56Z,"Dave: Since the codec is either DivX or XVid, you will not be able to play them in a standard DVD-Player unless your player is capable of playing DivX or XVid.

I'll be busy until friday, so expect DVD this weekend :-)"

Who wanted Godzilla?? He's lame... Gamera rocks! I bet: If Godzilla and Gamera were fighting, Gamera would win because Gamera was evil before he was shot into space. And he can fly. Godzilla has to SWIM the ocean. Go Gamera!"
