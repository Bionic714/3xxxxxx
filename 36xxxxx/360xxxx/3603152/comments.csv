,Wauli,2007-01-25T02:31Z,Yes I'm also dieing with atisipation at finding any good copy. Seems to me all these release groups are pirating from one original. Does this also have the poorly placed cam?

,pAdiiii,2007-02-04T16:46Z,How do I get the swedish text to this movie?
,theoo1,2007-02-05T13:53Z,"vilken jävla skit detta är, ladda inte nr denna!!!"
,kageli,2007-02-05T21:19Z,i couldn't open it. it says insert a disk this volume and press ¨ok¨ to try again or press cancel to break extraction. What i have to do? I use WinRAR.
,migidiot,2007-02-06T10:03Z,"It's still corrupted. File 30 on Disc 1 is missing, so you can't extract it.
Besides, people who says ""Oh i fixed it by DLing the patch from this site"" are advertisers - the ""fix"" is still missing file 30 of disc 1 on the other torrent site."
,UbervAg,2007-02-13T22:56Z,"I'm a noob, and I managed to fix it! 
Just go to the link, then download the torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3603161/Deja.Vu.TC.XViD-mVs
Then unhook all the files, but ""mvs-djv-cd1.r30"" (you only download this file, about 14Mb). Then, when winrar ask you to, you just open this file.

Quality is not good, but its ok. Good enough for me=)"
,KBorg,2007-02-22T10:29Z,"When I want to open CD2 .... Deja.Vu.TC.XViD-mVs/CD2/mvs-djv-cd2.rar is not RAR archive
No files to extract

What fucking that?"
