Always wanted to play to a FREE MMORPG ?

Shards of Dalaya is the biggest Emuled Everquest Server on the web !

1-MORE than 300 people at peaks hours and it's increasing every month !
2-Complete Original World, forget all you knew about Everquest !
 (no more bards pulling an entire area, no more necros fearing every mobs,
  no more clerics chaining complete healings...ect...)
3-Experienced Team of Admins, Quest Designers, Developpers
4-lvl 65's max with AA's up to planes of power (around 450 AA to max)
5-New totally original Concepts are regularly implemented
  (like adventuring band, or how to play with a friend and share your xp
   him/her even if he/she is not online, like that you stay at the same level)
6-A server costing more than 500$/month providing a huge Bandwidth for future !
 (payed mostly by donators...without donators it would not survive)
7-This game don't need a big computer, for people who have old computers
  with even only a small 3D integrated Chip it will work ! If you activate
  the 32bits textures though, you will need something like a 2ghz computer
  with 512+ ram and a geforce4 128mo to avoid graphic lag issues.
8-Helping Community, and strict admins, don't think you can do what you want
  (i have seen lvl 65's playing for months get banned for cheating as an example)
9-2 Boxing is allowed but not more
10-This server have it's own Forum, Wikipedia, Magelo (fomelo), Guild Web Sites

It's up since more than 4 years and still growing !
