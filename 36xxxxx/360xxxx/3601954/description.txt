Kortie O?Connor - VIDEO 2

January 2007 Cyber Girl of the Month


Kortnie travels for fun as much as she can but she never lets herself stray too long from Orange County's beaches. "I live at the ocean," she says. "I scuba dive, go wakeboarding or just sit on the sand under the sun. Lately I've been waking up early to work out, walk my dogs and drink a smoothie with a shot of wheatgrass. I love to make dinner after work and play golf on weekends and I try and fit as many things into my time as possible because, like my friends say, I live every day to the fullest!".
