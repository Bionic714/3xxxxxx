A large collection of mods that enhance the visuals in morrowind ten-fold. The mods cover everything from world texture replacers to minor textiure replacers like bottles and other misc items. None of these mods effect gameplay in anyway.

Note: It is recommened you install a few in a certain order, mainly the world replacers. Vibrant Morrowind, Visual Pack 2.11, Visual pack 2.2 (nature) and Visual Pack XT should be installed in that order for best results.

It is also recommended that these mods are used on a system well above the game\\\'s normal requirements, as many of the textures are very graphic intensive.
