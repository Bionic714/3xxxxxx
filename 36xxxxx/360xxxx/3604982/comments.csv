,Beat surrender,2007-01-28T20:56Z,"Man, sometimes I think EVERYTHING evolves around Swedish subs! I thought you taught English in Swedish schools, but obviously I was mistaken. The Swedish people most be the most useless in understanding English, since ALL they ever ask for is Swedish subtitles. How can a country's languageknowledge be so poor, especially in such a developed county as Sweden? When did they quit teaching English at school? When you go abroad, do you ask for subtitles talking to people who aren't Swedish? I heard Sweden dropped a lot of places in the International Grades and, looking at TPB, I can believe it."
,Tiny Turtle ,2007-01-28T23:32Z,Sort of like using a makeshift word like 'languageknowledge'... ;)
,ClaudiuS51,2007-01-29T00:52Z,"Beat it surrender! This is a SWEDISH site, if you dont like it, LEAVE. Even if we understand english, most american movies are hard to understand. They are full of slang and mumling talking."

,jpkrax,2007-02-12T17:23Z,"Beat surrender! Instead of yappin' why won't YOU UL some English dvd-s. here in Sweden we ar multilingual so there's no dub on foreign movies.
You know we can do several things at the same time, BOTH READ AND LISTEN.It's called simultancapacity. Stop whini'n and do somthing instead. You lamein' piece of #造//造#%&/()&%."
