,Zariba,2007-02-03T19:58Z,"i can't play the dvd on my dvd-player. When I play the dvd with the computer, while loading, he hangs at a black screen. If I click the menu button on the player software, it goes further, but that won't work on my standalone-dvdplayer. I have this problem with all s4 alias dvd, not the earlier seasons.

Somebody knows how to fix this???"
