Class not registered.

Why do this come?"
,Rhazeal,2007-01-23T15:19Z,"#1 - Yes, this is, as far as I'm able to tell, Vista only."
,unikkatil,2007-01-24T10:37Z,Tgis does not work on CRACKED windows... you cant install it beacuse u need an validate windows genuie... ive tried it for 1 week ago but nope does not work :(... You need original Version for it..
,Hosser,2007-01-24T13:32Z,"It's simple - as long as you have Genuine Windows. 

Just right-click your desktop, click ""Personalize"" click ""Desktop Background"" then pick ""Videos"" or ""Windows DreamScene Content"" from the dop-down list. 

Select a video and away you go. I used the Halo 3 HD trailer. This is fantastic, only uses about 15% of my Athlon 64 X2. =D"
,P1R4T3,2007-01-24T18:22Z,Doesn't work on RC1.
,Hero^,2007-01-29T10:58Z,"It's work on 6.0.6000

But not on if u cracked It with the time stopper 30-day crap shit crack.

It wokes if u have made It VALIDATED, witch u can do by use the other ""crack"", the one where u get a BETA key ""RC1"" or ""RC2"" key.
U install the 6.0.6000 verion and then u put in 2 files from the OLD VISTA versions and then activate It with OLD key that u still can get from Microsoft, The computer takes the 6.0.6000 version as an OLD version, and becuase u ""have"" old key u can make It validated until 2007-08-27, and until that time a REAL WORKING crack will be out !"
,noz,2007-02-02T14:03Z,"works perfect with the billgates iso (activated with a rc1 key). Now does anyone know where to find some nice movies, nature movies for example, to use with it. "
,Dust_X,2007-02-02T18:40Z,Does your system need to be activated???
,noz,2007-02-03T00:52Z,i tried to install it on another vista version with the time crack and it wouldnt install on that one...so my guess is that you have either have vista activated or install it before you use the time crack. 
,Dust_X,2007-02-03T10:37Z,"Thanks noz..... I am running Vista Timercrack....
Ill try that....."
,Dust_X,2007-02-03T10:41Z,"How did you guys activate Vista????
The first one I tried destroied my Media Center....."
,noz,2007-02-04T01:29Z,"Dust_X: Get this ""Microsoft.Windows.Vista.RTM.PROPER.Activation.Crack-ReeBSaW"" and follow the instructions. Works perfect with the vista  billgates iso that you also find on this site. A bit dissapointed with dreamscene though. Uses alot more cpu then i thought it would and alos makes the frames of the windows you open look messy. Maby its just my graph card or maby its cos its a beta version of dreamscene. Anyone else noticed this?"
,patriotgotland,2007-02-06T23:44Z,Aha Ok nu fatta ja! ;) Tusen tackar för svaret! Då kommer de väl en update vart de lider! Ja annars funkar denna vista klockrent!! Skit snyggt! Som dag o natt!  man kan nästan gämnföra XP och vista med nintendo 6 bitars och Playstation2! :D
,XweAponX,2007-02-18T20:33Z,"Do I HAVE to have the ""BillGates"" Vista version to get that activatioon krak to work?

I'm using the Vista Ultimate Editon, installed in 2099 with no product ID, and I used the timerstop.sys to keep it forever at 30 days-

I've been using Windows Download, and I can get any downloads I want so far, even one where I was asked to validate. Fortunately, tyhey still have the ""Alternate Validation"" method on the sites, when you run that validator, it always gives me an OK to download.

I don;t know about the integrated validaiton thing in IE: I have that shut the fook off.

Thanx for posting this, I'll try it and tell you whether it will install or nor, for real."
,runkill.com,2007-02-21T00:54Z,"Only works with Vista Ultimate. This did not work on legit Vista Business RTM . I get a version error. If anyone figures how to get ultimate extras on a version other than ultimae, Please post solution. Also intrested in getting texas holdem."
,spamedd76,2007-07-21T01:50Z,"YOU ARE ALL THICK MO FO'S
YOU HAVE TO HAVE VISTA ULTIMATE, THERE IS NO WAY TO INSTALL IT ON ANY OTHER VERSION OF WINDOWS, EVEN THE CRACKED SHITE DONT WORK, READ ON AND DREAM ON, FREAKS"
,wingtip9875,2007-08-09T04:04Z,"hmmm got it partially working on my validated vista Enterprise 64 bit ...  the files show up now and a few work and a few doesnt, keeps saying the dreamscene isnt installed and i know it is since some work and some dont... registry issue i think.
  you also have to have a aero compliant video card people.   have a nice day, buh bye"
,re0n,2008-01-02T03:03Z,"supports vista ultimate only... and i have a permanently activated vista ultimate 64x which i downloaded somewhere on this site and DreamScene just downloaded itself in windows updater. this is an awsome feature
aero + dremesce = badass

i dont know why you people are using the time crack or w/e just download the permanently activated oem.

hmm i cant find it on here anymore... maybe it got removed. i got the Dell OEM one and im runing a compaq and it works perfectly.

happy dreaming"
,lothainroxos,2008-05-09T06:20Z,"DreamScene, Deskscape, etcetc, all of which are for vista ultimate,(grumblemumblebastardsmumble), however, a hacked patch is out to make dreamscene available for vista homepremium, but thats about it."
,mik420,2008-12-14T18:42Z,ok here you go guys this version only works with vista ultimate(crap). but if you want the same plus extras of this on xp then you want xp ultimate by johnney you can download the torrent here but be aware this needs to be done on a fresh boot so back up. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4552552/Windows_XP_Ultimate_Edition_(by_Johnny)_[December2008-R3.9.4]
,Pirate_singer01,2011-06-18T17:08Z,this was a waste of me time...........
