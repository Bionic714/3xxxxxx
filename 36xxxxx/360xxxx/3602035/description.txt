Your desktop background comes to life with Windows DreamScene?. When you download this Ultimate Extra, you can select a video for your desktop background the same way you select a stationary picture. You can choose one of the high-quality looping videos that we?ve included, or use a video from a company that produces content for DreamScene. You can even use your own video as a background.

If you?re wondering what effect a video background might have on your battery life, don?t worry. Windows DreamScene respects your power settings and pauses the video to conserve battery power.

Some things that you should know before you start using Windows DreamScene:

Windows DreamScene supports only .mpeg and .wmv video file formats. 
Windows DreamScene video support requires a graphics card that supports Windows Aero?.

For computers that do not support the Windows Aero desktop experience, this Extra still has something to offer: Windows DreamScene adds new positioning options for backgrounds, including stationary pictures.

Product Stability

Before you continue, it is important to understand that the beta release of any product will not display the stability of a shipped Microsoft product. We have tested the Windows DreamScene Beta extensively within Microsoft and do not expect major problems; however, use of any pre-release product carries the possibility that you may encounter problems which could potentially result in a loss or destruction of data. Therefore, we suggest that you back up your existing data before you install and run this software.

This release has been tested as working on RTM Ultimate Activated. It is unknown whether it will work on unactivated systems or any other flavors of Vista
