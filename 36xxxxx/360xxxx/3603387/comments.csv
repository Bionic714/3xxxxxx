,BOYD1981,2007-01-25T12:20Z,unless season 4 only lasted two episodes and they skipped right to episode 3 with season 5 i think this is S04E03
,fador,2007-01-25T12:48Z,"If this is indeed season 4, where is episode 2?"
,lillsela,2007-01-25T17:36Z,www.epguides.com = 5x03
,whisperer,2007-01-29T01:26Z,"yeah the problem comes from some people ( epguides) thinking that there have been a season 3 and 4 already and now we're onto 5, while others think that 3+4 were actually just one big long season and so according to them this is us just reaching 4.

Thats their official site, which doesn't see it as seasons at all :D "
,jnd,2007-05-06T04:26Z,"Yes, this is why I prefer to have the episode name in the title, not just the numbers. OR... The number as in Discovery.com (i.e. 72 for this one), but that's unfortunately almost never used. :-("
,jordanwb,2007-07-18T14:37Z,This is season 5. Season 4 had 16 episodes and Season 3 has 16 episodes as well I believe.
