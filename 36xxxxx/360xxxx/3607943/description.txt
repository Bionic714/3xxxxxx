Loosely speaking this album falls into the bracket of ambient/electronic. However that almost does this album a disservice. It deserves it's own genre really, because it doesn't really fit anywhere. In a sense it is almost not like music. They have made something which is almost wholly electronic sound like it is completely organic. As mentioned before it almost sounds like it was recorded in a rainforest, there are sounds of birds, cicadas, monkeys in some parts, rainfall, waterfalls, and just general rustling noises. But along with these are synth washes, bass sounds, lightly plucked guitars, barely discernable spoken word samples, keyboards. Though naturally not ALL at the same time
