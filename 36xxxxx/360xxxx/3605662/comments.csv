,mkvlad,2007-01-29T18:38Z,"When this has got 3.8 on IMDB and the first has 2.0 ofcourse it's better, but it's still cpure crap and Uwe Boll still should be banned from ever making a movie again..."

,guarino2002,2009-07-21T01:04Z,"That was the exact question I had majtymicke if this was better than the first. I was looking up Sid Haig movies and I didnt know they made a 2nd one. But however im sure the reason this is better than the 2nd obviously other than Sid, is Uwe Bolls name wasnt on this. Im definatly checking this one out."
,K0nsol,2010-07-03T05:31Z,I've been looking for this movie for forever! Thanks
