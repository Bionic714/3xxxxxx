Vanessa Chantal Paradis (born December 22, 1972 
in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, Val-de-Marne, France) 
is a French singer and actress.

Career

 Vanessa Paradis was discovered on the TV show L'École Des Dans.
She recorded her first single La Magie Des Surprises-Parties in 1985.

 Although it was not a hit, it paved the way for the song with which 
she would become internationally famous - Joe Le Taxi in 1987,
while she was still only 14 years old.

 Paradis is currently working on a new album expected to be released in 2007.

Family

 Since 1998, Paradis has been in a relationship with American actor Johnny Depp
(despite occasional media reports to the contrary, they are not married). 
 They have a daughter, Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born May 27, 1999), and a son,
John Christopher "Jack" Depp III (born April 9, 2002). 
 Paradis caught Depp's eye in a hotel lobby in Paris 
while he was there shooting the film The Ninth Gate.
They are distant to the world of fame and protective of their privacy.
 They divide their time between houses 
in the Hollywood Hills and in the South of France,
and also own apartments in Paris and Manhattan. 
Paradis's 2000 album Bliss, another French chart topper,
was dedicated to Depp and their daughter.
