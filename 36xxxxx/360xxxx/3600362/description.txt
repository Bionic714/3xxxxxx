SANTANA\'s brilliant fourth album - CARAVANSERAI - is unquestionably one of the most amazing recordings of our time. Even today, CARLOS SANTANA himself claims CARAVANSERAI as his own personal favorite among all his recorded body of work. 

In 1972, after the release of their first three albums - all of which were incredibla critical and commercial successes - SANTANA took a radical turn in a direction no one was expecting. On CARAVANSERAI, SANTANA explore the spritual, jazz, rock, Latin and fusion genres - as well as an amalgam of others - in a way never done before or since. With clearly no \"hits\" included in the albums 10 tracks, it could have been commercial suicide. 

It was not. CARAVANSERAI was another in a string of hits. 

Today - A FULL THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER ITS RELEASE! - CARAVANSERAI is still gorgeous, spiritual, innovative and STILL decades ahead of its time.
