,Halbermunken,2007-01-25T22:30Z,Lack of objectivity and acceptance of crimes from our own side (often even refusal to see it) might be the downfall of this world.

its too bad, the old man had almost rehabilitated his image, and now he's thrown it all away again showing himself as the sad old man he is."

,SWE30,2007-02-05T22:56Z,"I'm surprised how ignorant you people are, you must be Americans!!!! 
The only mistake Jimmy Carter did was to criticize Israel in a country where questioning Israel is a taboo. 
Great book by a great and courageous man."
,tomtomx,2007-02-06T15:50Z,Appearently this book is full of flaws and distortions. Read a comment about this in the New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/opinion/09ross.html?ex=1325998800&en=f70db60fc63d6216&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss
,tomtomx,2007-02-06T16:01Z,"""This is a strange little book about the Arab-Israeli conflict from a major public figure. It is premised on the notion that Americans too often get only one side of the story, one uncritically sympathetic to Israel, so someone with authority and knowledge needs to offer a fuller picture. Fine idea. The problem is that in this book Jimmy Carter does not do so. Instead, he simply offers a narrative that is largely unsympathetic to Israel. Israeli bad faith fills the pages. Hollow statements by Israel's enemies are presented without comment. Broader regional developments go largely unexamined. In other words, whether or not Carter is right that most Americans have a distorted view of the conflict, his contribution is to offer a distortion of his own.""

,bigfhead,2008-02-24T03:10Z,"I'm not palestinian or israeli or muslim or jewish or christian. I'm plain old agnostic american. But I'd have to be completely blind or sympathetic to israel to not admit to the hell that is the life of a palestinian. Unfortunately, most Americans are as ignorant as Sargent_D and claim to understand when they really don't have a clue. Palestinians aren't terrorists. They are only defending their land that was given to Zionists by the British. To say that they ""made their bed, let em lie in it"" doesn't even make any sense. That comment makes me believe that somehow people believe the so called ""terrorists"" defending palestine are the same people that blew up the world trade center... this is not the case. Although, the United States' constant defense and financial support of israel IS sure to cause further hatred of the US and apartheid between us and the eastern countries. "
,brianxxx,2009-09-14T21:22Z,"Right on bigfhead

I posted this about Jimmy Carter in another thread but it applies to this - 

Excellent book! Mr. Carter knows more than the last 4 Presidents combined.

I am an agnostic and even I appreciate and respect his religious viewpoints simply because he does not force them on you and he maintains balance between science, fact and religion. Something most conservatives and religious followers cannot do on their very best day.

Smart man that has been laughed at by the ignorant for years. 

He has been involved with this problem long before he became President and he still is trying to bring peace.
