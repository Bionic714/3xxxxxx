The best movie of Gigi & Andrea! Great gags! Hilarious situations! Great supporting roles! Gegia as Miranda is fantastic! But there are also Jimmy il fenomeno Serena Grandi and Anna Kanakis! The athmosfere of the Bologna living style is perfectly recreated and also the terrible beach life! Gret quotes of Andrea: \"Ma che bella mortadellona! \"Ci do che ci do che ci do!\" You must see it!
