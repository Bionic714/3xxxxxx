AROtotheN Sappy-Time EP (2006/MP3/192)

Songs recorded nearly a decade ago, a luscious escapade 
through a young man's emotional ascent into quiet resolve. 
This newly remastered comp brings the listener closer than 
ever to the heart and soul of AROththeN.  Lyrical and 
instrumental pieces perfectly balanced, flowing from 
urgency to stillness.  Each track a true story, 
Sappy-Time EP stands as a modern lullabye, best enjoyed 
with a sleepy set of ears, and a sentimental heart.
