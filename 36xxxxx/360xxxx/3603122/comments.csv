Does anybody know where I can find the original textbook?"
,guglido,2007-01-25T04:49Z,"hi azraael,

the textbook is available on ebay (sometimes) and amazon

hope that helps"
,Azraael,2007-01-25T14:25Z,"Yes... I own a physical copy of it, I would like to find a digital version (easier to carry around) for my laptop "
,guglido,2007-01-29T06:10Z,"a digital copy...
i briefly looked for one but no luck. i doubt one exists...except hidden away on the publishers computer. i took the course last semester and you can easily learn the course from this solution manual. possibly the greatest solution manual ever written, every single step laid out. i bought it off ebay at the time, as thats the only place i could find one."
,guglido,2007-01-29T06:12Z,"oh sorry, i was referring to another solution manual. the solutions for this book are below par. i wasn't impressed. very concise."

,pnjbi,2007-04-21T23:21Z,"hey can someone seed it, i cant download it.
