----------------------

The first half consists of unreleased session outtakes from the Capitol years in pristine sound quality. The second half is a variety of unreleased live broadcasts with very good sound quality, B+/A-.

Track 4 is the only known Sinatra recording of Billy Strayhorn's ""Lush Life."" It consists of a couple of false starts, then a take that consists essentially of the song's verse, coming to a halt almost immediately at the start of the refrain. As far as is known, Sinatra never returned to the song, which is very unfortunate, as what we can hear of Nelson Riddle's arrangement sounds like a distinctive and inspired take on Nat Cole's classic 1949 version (arranged by Pete Rugolo).

One of the false starts of ""How Deep Is the Ocean,"" in which Sinatra changes a few key words, absolutely ruined the official version for me. I honestly can't listen to the opening of the official track (on NICE 'N' EASY) without breaking into a wide grin.
