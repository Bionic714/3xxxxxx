,zorko247,2007-02-09T03:20Z,"Wow this torrent is dire. The film itsself is AWFUL, and the rip is abysmal, it has an irritating none constant but regular hum to it, so in the background will be like *huummmmmmmmmmm* 3 second gap *hummmmmmmmmm* 3 second gap and so on. Avoid this, and wait for someone else to do it."
