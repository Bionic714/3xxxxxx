Everything Mozart ever composed. His complete works played by various artists and orchestras. I believe this is on a few other torrent sites but I'm bringing it to TPB.

In 45 volumes and 180 CDs. Each volume is zipped as a rar file. Simply use Winrar or another similar program to unzip after downloading. 

Music files are in MP3 format @ 192kbps quality. 

Cover art and booklets are scanned as jpg picture files. 

And for God's sake people, help me seed this as it is huge. Even if you only download part of it. I'm limited to about 50kbps upload speed but will seed until we have a high share ratio. Hope you enjoy the music. Long live Mozart!


DESCRIPTION:

The legendary Philips edition - The Complete Compact Mozart Edition is reissued in time for the 2006 anniversary. Originally released in 2001, this 180-CD collection contains Mozart's complete oeuvre and has proven to be the most successful edition in the history of the recording industry. The massive undertaking of recording the 45 volumes was preceded by years of preparation and included many recordings of pieces that had never previously seen the light of day! The hard labour, love and devotion that had been put into this brave and ambitious project would never have been possible without the inspiration that the world's most beloved composer had given to so many of the people involved.
