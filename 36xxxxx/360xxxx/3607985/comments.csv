,sirry_iriot,2007-02-10T09:54Z,"Fake, I think -- noone will reach 100% on any rar file so it's an insider trying to discourage p2p."
[T],naxosking,2007-02-10T17:42Z,"Umm. sirry you are very wrong. Several people have reached 100% and are seeding now. This is not a fake torrent. Back me up here people who've downloaded the whole thing! 

I'm not an insider at all sirry. I love p2p and encourage people to share. TPB is one of the greatest websites on the planet. I take a lot of offense at that sirry...What ingratitude : ( "
,eggewert2,2007-02-10T18:27Z,Thank you for this share. This is now my reference audio library for Mozart things. A very bold upload. Thanks for seeing it through.

,implo,2007-11-11T17:42Z,"Great upload naxosking, a collection worth having. Unfortunately I'm new to this tracker and a problem appeared. My question may sound stupid but what is/are the passwords for the rar archives. I wasn't logged in when I started downloading. Thanks."
,kojin,2007-12-15T12:45Z,"aww fuck zip files... 

can someone pleeease tell me if it has the JPG cover scans for :

Box 4 CD#10 - front cover
Box 15 
Box 17 CD#3

thanks :)"
,waccu,2007-12-29T10:28Z,"Hello ""kojin"" everything is within this package.
Every cd,covers and skinds.

This is really an amacing torrent.

Go ahead and download it.

Do not be angry cause its zip or rar files, its actually very good.
Then its not so easy to fuck with the files and send something you should not have."
,melancoholic,2008-01-27T03:44Z,"30 seeds, 274 leechers. Gawldang. Suppose I'll be seeding in.. 24 days. Little help?

Great and grand up, all the same, naxos. Thank you."
,kingdom1,2008-01-28T13:58Z,"Download ok, but extraction shows that files are corrupt - jpg's unopenable and MP3s on the cds all containing the same piece over and over - although the names on the tracks differ the times are all identical, its the same movement over and over.
This is twice i've downloaded this torrent and twice the files extract as not quite corrupt but since its the same movement over and over it is not as advertised.
Anyone else downloaded and extracted and listened yet? Or am I wrong?"
,kingdom1,2008-01-28T14:11Z,"As an example CD 6 of Volume 2 extracts to MP3 files labelled ""Symphony No.40 in G Minor,etc."" but in playback all tracks play as ""Symphony No.29 in A,etc."" in the iTunes title bar. Same result using VLC. 
Either a torrent to chew up bandwidth or a botched job of archiving the contents, download this and you'll get Mozart but it seems only a few movements repeated over and over across many cd volumes and all mislabbeled as to the file but which will play back (as something else), with all other material (jpgs coverscans etc.) unaccessible as ""corrupt"".
A very great disappointment."
,kingdom1,2008-01-28T16:06Z,"For example Volume 1 is titled ""Early Symphonies"" and upon extraction gives 6 cds and cover scans, etc. 
In a file manager the files identify as per the track listing. Jpegs and cover scans won't open as ""corrupt/unrecognized format"". These are jpegs!
The six cds look good until you try to play them . In all my media players (itunes.VLC) the tracks ALL appear as ""Symphony No.16 in C, KV 128-All"" with a playback time of ""4.21"".
And that is how they play.
So Volume one extracts as unreadable jpegs and six cds of the same 4.21 track named above, over and over again.Even though all seems well in the file manager. 
Other volumes appear similar with a different track as the ""repeater"" or with one or two other tracks and then one which repeats throughout the rest of the CD. Again, all seems fine when tracks are inspected via a file manager in that all tracks are named as if they contain differing and varied tracks. BUT the times given are the giveaway - if they are identical then its a good bet that they are all in fact a ""repeater"" track, regardless of the label which appears in the file manager. This becomes apparent on playback - my players properly ID the tracks as THE SAME TRACK repeated over and over.In Volume 0ne its 4.21 of Symphony No.16 on all tracks on all 6 cds.
In Volume six CD 1 its ""16 Minuets KV176"", length 2.11, which is contained on every track (that is repeated 42 (forty-two) times).
On volume six cd 2 the tracks appear to be corect until track 21 when the ""repeater"" from CD 1 reappears 15 times in a row. Volume 6 cd 3 is the same ""repeater"" track 32 times.On volume 5 cd 6 the firat two tracks are ok and then its ""repeater"" twenty-one time.
I'll go through this and salvage what can be salvaged for my collection.
From the look of it the worst case will be one track out of six cds worth (ie Volume 1). I hope that some of the discs out of the 180 have more than one track and that the ""repeater"" tracks vary from disc to disc.
Download this at your own risk. I did it twice and using different extraction programs and playback programs still got the same result. 
Anybody get a different outcome? Have I done something wrong in extraction? 
Or is it as I expect - Naxosking was fooled by wrong file tags into thinking a proper archiving had been achieved? Or was/is this malicious?"
,kingdom1,2008-01-28T17:18Z,"Have now extracted and examined Volume 7 ""Piano Concertos"".
Extracts to twelve cds. Only five concertos: No.13, 14, 18,and in D Major No.1. 
Oh yes and No.20 in D Minor 91 (ninety-one) times over. 

The non-repeaters are scattered amongst the discs.

Once again ignore what the files read as in a file manager. This is what you get when you try to playlist or play them back.

All other data inaccessible or corrupt.

Feh on this torrent. 

Incompetent? Malicious? Any guesses?"
,ansett,2008-01-29T05:52Z,"gday all can anyone else confirm what kingdom1 has advised... i am in aus and have a download limit, happy to use it on the collection if it is all good, but would be a waste if not... am going to donwload the Piano Sonata's for my mother who is a piano teacher and have her confirm them to begin with..."
,ansett,2008-02-04T05:28Z,"yeah the piano sonatas are fine, i'll download the rest of them now... thanks for this top upload!  someone has put a lot of effort into it.
thanks again"
,kingdom1,2008-02-22T01:22Z,"Hey Ansett g'day and glad to hear Sonatas OK for you. I never got that far as my exps above were too frustrating. Will now try to dl the Sonatas, hope I can get them to work.

Did the rest come out well for you ? 

If yes I can't figure what I've done wrong. Zipeg works well undecodeing other rars I've dl'ed.

BTW I too am a colonial a Canadian eh? Someday maybe hope to visit your land of lizards red sands and crocs."
,kingdom1,2008-02-23T02:21Z,"Me again. Again dl'ed Sonatas. Again in the file manager all looks well - tracks are named properly,etc.. Even in the playlist of VLC.

Upon playback, they are all identical tracks.

Has anybody succeeded in listening to these things once dl'd and unrared?Did they all play back properly? Cause all the tracks on disc one of the Sonatas, pace Ansett, are the same movement.

Why rar mp3s anyway? It adds nothing.

I repeat. The problem only manifests at playback not at unarchiving or in the file manager.

I repeat. Feh on this torrent.Even the jpg.s included are corrupt.

Download only a piece and check it out prior to dling the whole thing. 

It feels like  a sophisticated form of anti-p2p
""flypaper"". Don't waste your bandwidth/download cap.

It'd be nice if someone could confirm successfully LISTENING to  this, and finding more than one or two tracks misleadingly labelled, and repeated ad infinitum..

Also has anyone successfully viewed the included Jpg.s?"
,kingdom1,2008-02-23T14:17Z,"I see Knaverlisa has provided some non-rar'd torrents of this material in easier to handle sizes.

I predict that those won't be impossible to use like I found this torrent to be - I downloaded this torrent - all 15GBs of it - twice and parts of it thrice. 

Contrary to other comments here, this torrent is corrupt. See my remarks above - the faults only become apparent ON PLAYBACK. In file managers and playlists all appears well - but playback reveals the same tracks, repeated over and over.

Beware this torrent. 

Bully for Knaverlisa!  Bully, I say!"
,kingdom1,2008-02-24T19:24Z,"As of today Knaverlisa has posted all of this material in a series of easy to handle non-rared torrents. 

I recommend that y'all use them torrents instead of this one. See my comments above.

I reckon if y'all search for ""knaverlisa*"" y'all find 'em right 'nuff.

Yee-haw for knaverlisa! Yee-haw , I say!"
,ex_penumbrae,2008-03-20T23:40Z,"Whatever anyone else says about this torrent, it's ALL FINE. i downloaded it a few months back, & it's nothing but a delight. Everything plays properly, all the scans are fine. Anyone who has problems with it, it's nothing to do with the torrent. This has to be the best torrent ever made! Congratulations Naxosking! *bows*"
,ex_penumbrae,2008-03-20T23:43Z,"i've just read kingdom1's comments...

...what a twat. Ignore him; if i've listened to ALL the CDs & looked at ALL the scans with no problems, it just proves kingdom1 has an empty space between his ears.

CUNT."

use a torrent client that allows you to select the files you want to dl (perhaps utorrent) then do that."
