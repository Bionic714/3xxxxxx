 Notes  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
J. Geils Band includes: J. Geils (guitar); Peter Wolf (vocals); Magic Dick (harmonica). All tracks have been digitally remastered. Although it didn't sell in the same numbers as their '80s releases LOVE STINKS and FREEZE FRAME, the J. Geils Band's 1977 album MONKEY ISLAND is considered to be one of the group's best recordings amongst longtime fans. While a few of the tracks still retain the festive rock direction of their earlier releases (most notably their upbeat cover of "I Do," which would become an instant concert staple), MONKEY ISLAND contains a dark undercurrent throughout. This is most notable on the epic title track, which sounds at times like a jam session between the Rolling Stones and Santana, as well as the vicious rocker "Somebody." MONKEY ISLAND remains the J. Geils Band's most underrated and often overlooked album.
