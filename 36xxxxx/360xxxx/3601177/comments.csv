,Kirmz,2007-01-22T09:25Z,It's just getting seeded now hold your horses. Watch the availibility of the file - it keeps going up. There's so many people downloading though that none of us are connected to the seed
,mh2360,2007-01-22T09:36Z,"Got the sample, quality looks OK, but it shows you what happens last episode, have to what till 100% to tell if its fake or not... damn RAR files..."
,phoemix,2007-01-22T09:40Z,"the sample is ripped from the s03e11...
where adama speaks to the cylon chick face-to-face, its 1:1 rip from there.

FAKE WARNING."
,Kirmz,2007-01-22T09:56Z,The other 3x12 is seeding faster IS an AVI and is the real deal (i checked) apprx 54% availbility

,Kirmz,2007-01-22T09:58Z,Oh and every episode (if you have ever watched battlestar galactica) has an intro telling you what happened last episode. That's the sample you got

,Emohawk,2007-01-22T16:29Z,"Kirmz; thank god ill never watch a movie with you! :)

,erikdalen,2007-01-22T16:54Z,"why use rar files? will require twice as much disk space to continue seeding while watching it. and right now I'm unfortunately a bit short on disk space, so no seeding from me..."

fin79@bk.ru
thanks"
,MaXMC,2007-01-22T21:55Z,"Why use RAR files?

Because the SCENE that releases this doesn't use torrents AT ALL, they use FTP instead.

Mostly they hate torrents."
,SuperFly2000,2007-01-23T06:09Z,"This is the real deal.

Working just fine.

Thanks pirate brothers :)"
,Rainman,2007-01-23T18:43Z,"Picture Quality is bad, The HR release anyone?"
,spook952,2007-01-23T23:11Z,great series well worth the bandwidth. keep them coming 
,rojlaroo,2007-01-30T23:02Z,anybody seen where i can lay my hands on episode 11 please and thank you^^*
,st.james,2008-04-27T06:25Z,"Please, feel free to thank me for seeding.

Apparently I'm the only one on this torrent who knows how to.

Why is there 8 seeders merely sitting on it with 0 kb/s uploading speed?"
,jelena84,2009-02-13T10:08Z,thanks a lot
