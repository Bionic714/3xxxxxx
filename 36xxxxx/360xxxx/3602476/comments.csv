,arrowunderworld,2008-08-05T11:16Z,"OK, there's no subs (none) or at least doesn't seem to work in my download.

It seems to have a little problem around minute 49, it jumps back to min. 45, you need to click forward to the next chapter and go back a little to watch the song complete.

I haven't burned this in a dvd yet, because is a DVD-DL, and I don't want to compress it and lose quality.

But it seems that clonedvd (the one using a lamb as a logo) may fix it. It pop up a window that was 'TRYING TO REPAIR DEFECTIVE DVD STRUCTURE'.

I'll let you know as soon as I get some money to purchase DVD-DL.
