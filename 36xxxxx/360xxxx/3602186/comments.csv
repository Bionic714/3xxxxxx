,Cleric Marty,2007-01-24T03:26Z,"sumofhate, is this the 4.6.0.0 version or newer.  4600 version expires on feb 5, 2007 - so we need to keep an eye out for the new release.  The tools are ok, but I was actually expecting a whole lot more.  You can burn this with UltraISO.  Nero and all the others probably work too, but i have not tried them all on this program.  This is an english program also.  Thanks for the seed.

,flyguyty89,2007-02-08T06:49Z,"no... on feb 5th the disk will no longer boot. The iso, is on a FTP server somewhere, i cant remember the addy off by heart. There is just a file in the ISO that stops it from booting, you should be able to remove it"

v4.6.1 Expires May 7, but you can generally change the system date/time and it should work fine. If I can remove the date/time-check in bootup I'll repost the torrent."
