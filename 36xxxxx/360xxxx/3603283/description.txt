-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. President George W. Bush defied his critics and has authorized more 
troops for Iraq - the so-called "surge". This week, Brian goes to the U.S. 
capital to look closely at what lies behind this strategy and whether it 
can bring stability to the shattered country, especially its violent and 
unstable capital, Baghdad. In Washington, Brian talks to several leading 
observers about failing optimism in the Iraq campaign, among them, the 
respected U.S. military and strategic analyst, Anthony Cordesman of the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Our World also brings you a story about the latest group of U.S. soldiers 
heading for Iraq. The CBC's Neil Macdonald travels to Georgia to talk to 
soldiers and their families about the government's decision to send more 
troops. The soldiers in Neil's report, who are from Fort Stewart, know what 
it's like to pay the price of combat. One in ten of the soldiers who've died 
in Iraq came from Fort Stewart.

Finally, Brian explores the role U.S. civilian administrators have played in 
Iraq. Most of the attention has been focused on the U.S. military. But U.S. 
civilian advisors and administrators have played a critical role in how the 
U.S. occupation has unfolded. Brian speaks to Rajiv Chandrasekaran of the 
Washington Post about the sometimes-surprising policies put in place by 
civilian decision-makers. Chandrasekaran has written a highly regarded book 
on the subject. It's called "Imperial Life in the Emerald City".  It's a 
fascinating look inside the "Green Zone", the heavily protected and lavish 
neighbourhood of  the U.S. civilian force, a community that lives in relative 
safety, strangely remote from the violent city outside.
