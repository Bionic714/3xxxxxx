That cmd file is just for registering the library (.ax) file."
,Tommyz1,2010-06-12T21:19Z,"Alternative to running the .cmd file just run the following at the command promt:

regsvr32 VodeiMPAVI.ax

or

regsvr32 VodeiMPAVI.ax /s

Running without ""/s"" gives you a confirmnation that the registration was successfull.

It worked for me. Thanks a lot. I hate vodei."

Article http://www.vladd44.com/video/vodei.php is a bit obsolete, now new easier solution is available: http://vodecoder.videoripper.org/ But, unfortunally, new solution works only for vodei 2.x encoded files - not working to decode vodei 1.0 	"
