Tune in Truthseekers! The opposition to the Bush Crime Family is really heating up! Thousands and thousands turn out to protest the ongoing illegal slaughter in Iraq as the Congress plans to hold more debates and hearings on this disaster.

And what can be done to stop Bush's bloodlust for Iran? He's on another killing spree and this time we don't think the rest of the world will just look away.

And more prominent Republicans are speaking out against Bush, this time over his ridiculous immigration policy.

All this, plus a recap of the Sunday talk shows and much more!
