,birdcrap,2007-02-04T03:27Z,"Works great on my PC, but how do you get the audio to work when playing a burned dvd on a modded XBOX using the latest XBMC?  I know the muted sound has something to do with the AC3.  
Just can't get the audio above a whisper."
,Shazian,2007-02-04T06:51Z,"Have the same problem with the sound, no problem to get it when i play it on my computer, but if i try to get it on the dvd player there is really no sound. Anyone got any good solutions?

Tried with decrypter, Nero and Nero recoder so far and no luck."
,SuperOlav,2007-02-04T11:08Z,"Same problem for me. Can't get it on DVD, but my VLC-media player makes me able to see this on comp. (If anyone wanted to know)

Please tell us what program to use artemis! I want this with sound on DVD."
,StoffMisbrukerRobin,2007-02-04T12:59Z,"Norwegian subs?
Anyone?"
,[NOR]ThomaZ,2007-02-04T15:07Z,hadde være nice med norsk sub ja :)
,rawando,2007-02-04T23:10Z,asso är det så svårt att ladda ner text och ladda ner en annan fil vafan
,Shazian,2007-02-05T09:45Z,"quality of this movie is great, at least what i can see in any of the players i use in my computer. (VLC, PowerDVD) only thing i cant figure out is to maintain sound when i burn it to a DVD, but i can see it perfectly on the computer, even when i use the DVD i have burned it out too. If i stick it in my regular DVD player there is no sound.

,joakim.berglund,2007-02-09T13:50Z,"God quality and sound! Onlys stereo but it was okey on my stereo tv, probily not so nice if u have surround sound!"
,lone.se,2007-02-12T01:05Z,"prob. one of the best copys i have ever seen.. REALLY far out quality.. but my god.. that movie is sickening bad.. I hate myself for having watched it..
