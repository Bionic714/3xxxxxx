WTF? Is this some wierd format of torrent?"
,Jermony,2007-06-13T22:33Z,I made this torrent on Azureus so it should work just fine. 2000+ other people haven't had a problem with it. maybe its just your program. i didnt have a problem the last 5 times i downloaded it to see if it still worked. other than that i don't know what problems ur having 
,dj svamp,2007-06-17T15:34Z,does anyone have hearts of iron II no?? (not only the exp. pack)
