I'm mucho grateful for the upload.

Just a thought for any future rips - unless you're uploading the DVD9 disk (unlikely!), all languages except the original should be removed, as they take up a lot if space and so degrade the video quality, but leave the subs as they're very small.

Also, some hard-disks can't cope with files bigger than 1Gig, so it's better to post the VIDEO_TS directory files than a 4.5 Gig ISO.
(I understand that P2P works better with multiple files too).

Thanks again!"
