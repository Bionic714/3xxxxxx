,billhicksfan,2007-01-29T21:04Z,"Forgot to mention. My upload speed is not so great, but I intend to seed this torrent for a long long time. Bill Hicks was a great man of our time!"
,daveggg,2007-03-20T11:55Z,"BRILLIANT DVD!!!

EVERYONE SHOULD REALLY GET IT..

BILL HICKS WAS A GENIOUS AND ONE OF VERY FEW BRAVE ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE A FUCKED-UP SOCIETY.."
,Zoracic,2007-03-22T10:41Z,"Thanks to billhicksfan and everyone else for sharing. I'll seed this for as long as I can.

Bill Hicks was NOT a comedian. He was a fucking master-magician of life and truth-sayer. He always had my utter respect as a human but when I look back at what he said it's just as fresh and honest now as it was then.

If you like to think about what's happening around you and how people/governments will fuck you over if they can you must listen to Hicks.

Sadly missed."
,aguito,2007-08-20T10:10Z,"jesus man... what a GREAT upload this is!
can't wait to get my hands on this thing!
(and yeah, I'll seed guys! for Bill's sake!)"
,HobokenBob,2007-11-20T04:07Z,"Is this PAL or NTSC?
It seems to be too large to burn on one disc. Any help please.
Bill Hicks is still the best!"
,billhicksfan,2008-01-14T08:53Z,"The DVD is NTSC.

It is too big to fit on a single layer disk, but fits just fine on a double layer.

I'm up to 233GB uploaded on this torrent :D

And there are still people downloading! Bill IS great :)"
,lostboy69,2008-02-27T12:54Z,"If you can't fit 7.72GB onto DVD, download Clone DVD, or DVD Shrink. 
These programs ""shrink"" the DVD down to 4.4 GB without losing any significant quality.
I've used them many times with great results.

ps - Thanks for this torrent billhicksfan."
,Wormicle,2008-08-18T09:46Z,"Zoracic: I may as well not post a comment now, not when you've said everything I wanted to say so much more succinctly. "
,negativeions,2008-10-08T05:14Z,Thank god this torrent is still alive... thank god for pirate bay
,amfan56,2008-10-09T07:42Z,"Thank you for keeping the flame alive.  I will return from time to time and keep this seeded, because we can't ever let this man be forgotten.

Selah."
,billhicksfan,2008-10-09T16:05Z,"I've about 2TB uploaded so far on this and the ""Sane man"" DVD torrents. And I don't plan to stop the seed any time soon :)"
,ironwood,2010-02-24T02:53Z,"Uploaded a x264 DVDRip from this source to

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5389081

which cuts the filesize from 7.7GB to 3.4GB."
