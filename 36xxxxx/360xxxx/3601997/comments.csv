,baygull,2011-06-12T04:15Z,"I burned the ISOs to CDs and installed the game fine. But then when I try to play it says ""Cannot locate VTM Bloodlines Disk 1

Please eject and re-insert VTM Bloodlines Disk 1, Select OK and restart application.""

Ejecting and re-inserting did not work. At that point I had not installed any patches, so I tried installing unofficial patch 7.5. That didn't work, nor did restarting my computer."
