::SMALLVILLE MUSIC - BROWNLEAF MIX VOL. 1::

	Hi Everyone!
	This is my first mix of Smallville music. I really love 
	this show, mostly because of all the great music, so I 
	thought I'll bring you some of my own personal 
	favorites. Each song appears somwhere in the show, and I've 
	picked the ones who got a little story to it. 

	I will NOT include neither "Save Me" with Remy Zero or 
	"Superman (It's not Easy)" with Five for fighting in 
	my realeses. They are both great songs, but every fan 
	mix of Smallville music has them, and it gets a little 
	old after a while. A bit to obvious for my taste i guess ;)
 
	I recommend playing all this in Winamp, 
	because of the id3 and id4 tag capability. You see, there's 
	info in every song, such as in what episode the song 
	is being played, as well as info about the original album
	and stuff like that. 
	
	Please mail me if you wanna know anything about this 
	realese or upcomming editions. 

	Enjoy!
