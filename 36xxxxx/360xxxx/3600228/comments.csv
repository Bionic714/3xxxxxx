,Staple,2007-01-21T16:47Z,"If you know your Simpsons, you can get a clue just by looking at the title of the episode. Are you with me ?"
,KennethVW,2007-01-21T17:16Z,so this is fake ???
,Razkull,2007-01-22T04:49Z,"Well, since it says PDTV it does not have the title of the episode so maybe try downloading it and watching it before you give your reviews. And to the guy who says ""be aware of him"" how do YOU know this guy didn't have these torrents on another site then just added them to here?"
,ftagaidin,2007-01-22T21:05Z,"kinda unnecessary to add the last episode, when there's several others up and running, don't you think?"
,Yourfatmom,2007-01-23T16:32Z,"Hmmm, I'm desperately waiting for 18x11. Wasn't it aired in the US last Sunday? :("
,Lanix,2007-01-23T21:43Z,"No, Simpsons is back 28th January (episode 11)."
,Yourfatmom,2007-01-24T19:44Z,"Oh I see, thank you."
