 I apologise. It seems that the audio sync problem may be with my puter, when I try to play the file on full screen on media payer classic the audio goes out of sync but if I leave it just as it is, it plays ok.
Although there seems to be a scene missing at 39.05, although I think that it may be the makers of the programme running out of ideas rather than you cutting it out I'll need to downlood this episode via another torrent to check if it is just this torrent thats messed up or if its my puter or if its the makers that f***ed it up.
thank you for making the effort to upload a rather dissapointing episode."

Thanks for taking the time to post spliffythree, any and all feedback is welcome."
