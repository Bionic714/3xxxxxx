Here is my FAVORITE sub culture speed freak film :) Spun has a great cast, including John Leguezzamo, Mickey Rourke, and Blondie, to name just a few. One thing that mystifies me about this film, though...The language is uncensored, however every time there's a shot of a pussy, there's a little censorship bubble over it. Also, whenever they SAY the word pussy, it's bleeped out. I can't for the life of me figure this out, since they use every imaginable other cuss word liberally. 

Anyway, this is a GREAT cult flick about the lives of a bunch of insane speed freaks in Portland, Oregon.

Enjoy it, and as always, SEED, SEED, SEED! :)
