,TheOzyCocky,2007-02-02T13:58Z,"If you're after Australian scenery-textures-airports etc that's all in the one package, have a look at VOZ for all of Australia and it's different seasons etc at www.vistaoz.org , the VOZ software is FREEWARE that you can dl straight off the website with excellent support via the forum for it. Anyone who wants to fly in Oz needs to check it out.
