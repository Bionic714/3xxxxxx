the shortcut.exe is part of the windows 2003 server resource kit. If people are that scared the just download all the components yourself and use them.
RipIt4Me  is at videohelp.com
fixVTS is at videohelp.com
dvd shrink 3.2 is at videohelp.com

funny dumbass my fully up to date symantec antivirus says nothing of a trojan and I only
upload stuff that I use myself."
,anonoymous_2012,2007-01-28T19:07Z,"DVDDecrypter is also at videohelp.com
just download all the components
put them in a folder on your dessktop
and run them from there.
the mpaa is just pissed off because we are smarter
than they are and the hd DVD format has also been cracked. that is why they are spamming virus trojan warnings."
,anonoymous_2012,2007-01-29T02:48Z,"this torrent does not contain a virus or trojan.
Your probably some dumb ass punk or an mpaa
employee pissed off because I posted something
that makes it easy for EVERYONE to copy dvd
discs.

anyone who has had success copying DVD disc with this torrent please comment."
