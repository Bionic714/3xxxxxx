Skriv upp dessa och banlyst dem."

Despite appearances, the majority of the planet doesn't speak english. Secondly, these torrents are free. What is there to complain about? If you want assurances go to a shop and BUY IT!"

It that time, there was no virises, no threaths, no spam! So what make you think that there is always better with new OS´s."

I can help myself in a lot of languages, but suppose this is in arab (as an example, for as i know it never in arab) i would get around not a single bit. Although it's great people uploading, and we shouldn't be bitching. it can be annoying if you're looking for a language you understand, and you have to download every single version to find out if it's the english, french, slovak, or swedish version. it is as important as a version number. DOS is something I download when needed, like right now, and then the last thing i can use is going to a cybercafe, download a dos, come home and find out it's useless. Manaheim: replace in grimfusion's comment English by Swahili and you get the point.  It's because most used commands are are the same that i can't care right now, but he still has a point."
