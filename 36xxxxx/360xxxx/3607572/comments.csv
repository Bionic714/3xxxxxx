,ilive4harleys,2007-10-13T12:05Z,"Let us not forget about meth labs. The substances used are highly poisonous. They become encased in the furniture, floors, walls, ceilings, everywhere. If you purchase a house that was used as a meth lab, and keep in mind there is no law that states that the realtor must inform you of this, you are in effect using the drug. You are breathing in the poison. Your children are playing in a poisonous area. Meth effects not only the user but everyone around the user, whether they know it or not. One hit and you are hooked. I have seen it for myself. I have never used it. I do not want to use it. I have seen it, within the course of 6 months, make a close friend lose his house, family, car, Harley, job, teeth, 170 pounds and virtually all his friends except those who use the drug with him. Stay away from it. Stay away from anyone using it. Stay away from any labs. Red phosphorous, a by-product of meth production, will eat its way through your skin down to the bone and then through the bone. It was given to Japanese kamikaze pilots in WW2 and was used by Adolf Hitler."
