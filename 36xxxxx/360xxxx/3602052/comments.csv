,dalis llama,2007-06-02T04:41Z,"Hey, thanks iCE!

This was the first game to ever freak me out - especially when your characters pc first starts getting spooky..."

,Brix40,2008-02-25T19:55Z,"how do I get it down on a disk. have tried everything, but it does not work. please help me"
,pandemonium06,2008-02-28T06:27Z,"This is an utter waste of time and memory. The directions are way to elaborate and don't necessarily apply to your setup. Also, the directions don't help that much. There are many extra programs you must install before setting up the game and some of the disks are way to big to put on cds (Daemon tools doesn't seem to help). Take it from me...DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"
,pandemonium06,2008-02-28T06:33Z,"by the way, the extra programs you have to download are on different websites. compatibility is often a big issue in the directions as well as in the actual setup.  You'll get lost pretty quick. "
,Brix40,2008-03-23T12:24Z,"thanks for telling me. I have now deleted it from my computer. I have the same problem with number 1 of this game. I have been looking for this game for a long time, so it suks that it does not work. "
,VeKTeReX,2008-05-22T05:39Z,"This torrent is a mess.  It does include the game data and executables, so it is playable, but there are several duplicated patches and utilities here.  One of which was copied THREE times and all three under a different name (md5 checksum shows that they are identical however).

It's an annoying mess that would not have taken much work at all to clean up before packaging."
,Si1ver,2008-05-25T01:30Z,"Cooool Thx a lot!

,blueangel08,2008-10-27T03:05Z,Any need help running this game feel free to email me. I currently play the game fine on my xp sp3 machine
,dlnp22,2008-11-16T15:31Z,"I played Phantasmagoria 1 when I was maybe 16 or 17 and LOVED it..by the time I ever got the 2nd one, my pc was just way too fast...This is me GIVING BACK. I've searched for an easy(easy for me, at least) way to get Puzzle of Flesh to work on my XP/Vista systems for the past 8 YEARS! I've finally found it!!! THANK YOU, NICK!! I'm so stoked to get this working, I'm posting this on ALL the sites I've seen this discussed.  Forget the flipping DOSbox and virtual pc solutions- waste of time. First and foremost, get the game and get it on discs(a completely different issue) If you have the original game discs, skip ahead. If you want the game, research ""torrent"" ;)  Get the game on 5 cd's one way or another(if you find .img files, use cdclone(it's discontinued, but you can still find it with a thorough search), if you have .iso files, there's a dozen easy/fast/FREE .iso burning programs out there.  Once you have the game on disc, go to http://www.squirtthecat.com/games/phantasmagoria_2/index.html and the rest is cake!  Install the executable from this page. Insert disc 1(do not start game from disc, but rather from the .exe file that was installed on your hard drive from the download in the previous link) and YOU ARE DONE...no need to worry about patches or slowing down your system or all the other garbabg. Not sure if this is smart on my part, but if you need help, hit me at donpeters1979@yahoo.com"
,Pesi11Sund,2008-11-21T23:57Z,I'm downloading this game because my aunt is in it!! :D:D I didn't know
,ILoveYou,2009-03-30T12:05Z,"Typical pirate bay; one day this has over 100 seeds, the next it's down to 10. Leech and run seems to be the policy here."
,ILoveYou,2009-04-15T15:04Z,"For those of you who didn't get this to work:
If you want to play this game without changing it to a DOS version (horrible graphics), download Virtual PC (it's FREE) from Microsoft's website. Then download Windows 98 from pirate bay and load it on the Virtual PC machine. Install daemon tools on Windows 98 and copy these game files on Win98 as well. Install, and play. Works 100%!!"

I did this sort off, I didn't burn the cd's I just mount it and that way works to.. :)"
,brnemer,2010-01-04T03:14Z,"i wish people would learn how to download good torrents,not complicated ones like this one,there are too many compatibility issues with this one......."
,FuckPaying,2010-02-08T21:33Z,"brnemer you are now officially stamped as a retard in my books, installing this game from a cd is just as shitty, it's your operating system fuckbag."
,kreatureofky,2011-07-17T00:46Z,"I love how you guys totally rip on this guys torrent. If you are too dumb to figure it out, go to http://www.sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/NewSierraInstallers.html
and it will make your life a whole lot easier. I mean if it works on my Windows 7 x64bit then it will work on EVERYONES PC! DosBOX is a must to play this game on x64 machines. You can't run 16bit applications on these crappy new Operating Systems. Kudos to Microsoft for not wanting us play our classics."
,kreatureofky,2011-07-17T01:10Z,"Just to verify I got this working on both an Intel and AMD system on the x64 OS. This download isn't a waste because everything works on the cd images, the users who download it and say ""it doesn't work"" are not computer smart. Go here if you don't know what to do http://www.sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/NewSierraInstallers.html and mount the images to Daemon tools or PowerISO. Installer will ask you to insert disks, just mount over them until setup is finished. Then a messages says DosBox not found, and it will ask you to locate it. Double click the Phantasmagoria shortcut on your desktop. Ready to play!"
