,frettub,2007-01-23T17:02Z,"Don't blame it on the program, its much better than DC++ which has monitors of police and goverments spying on downloaders.

You guys are the incompetent people who can't look for the right files, if you are afraid of viruses download their free version then.

OR if you cannot pay then try Frostwire which is based on there pro version.

BUT if you are gonna download cracks/torrents then you have to take the chance/risk that there is a virus inside, and its not the programs fault what happens to your computer."
