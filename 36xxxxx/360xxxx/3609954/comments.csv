Due to many suggestions, I will be switching to HE-AAC or the new VORBIS in the next seasons of SG:Atlantis, SG-1 (if there will be next season), and Battlestar Galactica.

I just wanted to keep technologies used in my encodings CONSISTENT in every season of a series, so after i start making one season in a certain way, then i have to keep it up to the end of that season."
,enick,2007-02-03T21:50Z,How about increasing file size? I find it disturbing that a new great codec is only used to make the file size smaller and keeping quality at the same level (or worse) instead of using the new technology to increase quality?
