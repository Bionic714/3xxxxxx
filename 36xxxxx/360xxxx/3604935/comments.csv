,leftboy,2008-04-21T04:17Z,"Here's how I got it working - no need to download a crack!

1. Uncompress the first .bin file (rld-nu2a). This contains the crack folder amongst others.
2. Mount the first .bin file with Daemon tools. This will install. It asks you for the game code - open the rld-nu2k file which gives a keygen.
3. The installer will ask you to insert CD 2 at about 53%. Now mount the second .bin files (rld-nu2b). It will continue installing.
3. Once this has finished, change the speed2.exe  file for the one in the crack folder you have already uncompressed. This will now work - you can play!"

,rapzeh,2008-06-21T02:45Z,"Thanks RELOADED , another great release ! (as usual)

When you finished downloading , mount the two "".bin"" CD images on two virtual drives whit PowerISO.
Double click ""NFSUG2_DISK1"" (the first disk) -> the autorun should appear.
Insert one of the serial included in the .NFO file (!!! open .nfo files whit ""DAMN NFO Viewer"" , its freeware http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Text-editors/DAMN-NFO-Viewer.shtml)
The installation should run smoothly (worked fine for me !)
When the installation finished , copy the NO-CD .exe from the first CD (right click -> explore / crack/ speed2.exe) and paste it in the installation folder (.../ program files/ ea games/ NFS U2). Replace the original .exe whit this one and the game will never ask for the original CD.

thats all , enjoy !"

After you've completed the download for this torrent follow these steps on how to install the game.

1. Lauch Daemon Tools.
2. Left click the Daemon Tools icon on your toolbar and then click the option below ""Unmount All Drives"".
3. Go to the torrent folder you downloaded called ""Need for Speed Underground 2"" and click the arrow pointing down next to ""Files of type"".
4. Select ""All files[*.*]"" then click ""rld-nu2a"" and click open.
5. A window will pop up showing options for the game. Click Install.
6. Enter this CD key: XU5D-NAZ8-HA88-B6RJ-RLD0 (the last symbol is the number 0 not the letter O).
7. When the installer gets around 53% it will say ""Insert Disc 2"". With Daemon Tools, click its icon on the toolbar and select the option below ""Unmount All Drives"".
8. Go to the ""Need for Speed Underground 2"" torrent folder again and select the option to show ""All files[*.*]"".
9. This time, select the file called ""rld-nu2b"" and click open.
10. Now click OK on the installer after you opened ""rld-nu2b"".
11. Let the installation finish and then either check the box ""Play Need for Speed Underground 2"" or ""Quit"" and then click finish.

Hope this step by step guide helped you guys out."

INDEX 01 00:00:00

Step-by-step:

Here we have the rld-nu2a.bin file

1. Right click on a blank space in the same folder than your bin file

4. Paste this into the file:

IMO, this is actually quite a fast download, and I could easily be playing it tonight at the rate this thing is downloading. 150-200kb/s, kudos to the seeders. Really, you kids, 3 hours of your life is plenty of time to go do something USEFUL with yourselves.
While downloading, I am also seeding a bit, so I can contribute what little I have, I suppose.

BTW, stop using Lamewire... oh yeah! I forgot! Even when I DID use Lamewire, I didn't give such impatience and rudeness to good seeders like these here. And when you are done downloading, seed for awhile yourselves so that MAYBE there will be less of you ignorant bastards complaining OMG OMGOMGOMGOMGOM SEEDSEEDSEEDSSEEDDSESEEDESSEEDSEEEDSSEDD and all of that good shit!

I'm having the same problem as Adassc and KnazeN21 above, it says that it's the incorrect CD. 

I'm assuming though, that there is supposed to be a Crack with this game, too make the computer think that it's the right CD and all.

The files that I have are: ""rld-nu2a"" and ""rld-nu2b"" which are to be mounted with Daemon tools, and the NFO file ""Need for speed underground 2"" which is the info file with serials.

Is there a way to do this correctly? Is there a Crack that I can't find, or some other way to do it? Please reply, either here or at jens_kleveland@hotmail.com

After you've mounted Disc 1, go into it and find the folder labeled Crack.

The first file is the serial generator, which, if you've gotten this far, you don't need.

Copy the second file, speed2, into the install directory, overwriting the speed2 that is already there.

Now, run your new speed2 and the game should work just dandy."

WHERE is this CRACK file? You're talking about this ""Inside the CD1"", I do not understand that. My CD1 is a VLC-file (which I used to mount and install the game), but there is nothing to Unzip there, no zip-folder of ANY kind.

And check this out: I know how to mount / crack / fix most games, it's not the problem. The problem lies in MISSING FILES or / and WHERE TO FIND THEM. 

Again - thanks for replying, but I / we need an explenation on where to find this Crack folder, which aint there : )"
,Nubi,2010-01-02T06:50Z,"OK THIS IS MY LAST COMMENT!! (With sollution)

I read what you guys said and realized that what you ment by ""go into the folder"" and ""blablabla"". You need to be more specific : ) 

HERE IS WHAT TO DO, IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED THE GAME USING DAEMON TOOLS:::

1. After mounting and installing the game (if you can't do THAT, please, remove your self from planet earth), go to ""My computer"", or whatever that is in your language.

2. The file that you mounted (rld-nu2a (aka. CD1)), is replacing what usually is a CD / DVD that you put in your computer.

3. Mark the icon on My Computer called ""BD-ROM Drive (Z:) NFSUG2_DISK1"" and RIGHT CLICK IT (that's right, do NOT double-click it). Then click the ""OPEN"" or ""OPEN IN NEW WINDOW"" option

4. If you did this, you should have ended up with a folder called ""BD-ROM Drive (Z:) NFSUG2_DISK1"". Inside this folder there is another folder that's called ""Crack"" (the folder that everyone was talking about, but none could tell me where to find). Open the Crack folder, right-click the ""speed2"" icon, press ""COPY"".

5. This is the final, kewl, step. Go to the place where you saved the Need for speed - Underground 2 game (Usually @ Computer -> (C:) -> Program files -> EA GAMES). Open the EA GAMES folder, then open the ""Need for Speed Underground 2"" folder. When you are INSIDE THAT FOLDER, Right-click (does not matter where, just inside the folder), and find PASTE. You will get asked wheiter you'd like to make a shortcut, replace the icon, etc. **Make sure you REPLACE THE OLD ICON WITH THE NEW ONE**

What you just did, is replacing the ""normal speed2 icon"" with a cracked verson, which will make sure your game runs as it's supposed to.

,askikr91,2010-01-17T20:13Z,"Here is a little (very broken down) install guide for people having trouble:

*Note: I have Windows XP Service Pack 3. I do not know the compatibility of other operating systems.

Now for the guide:

1. Download torrent (obviously)

2. When torrent is completed, make sure you have Daemon Tools and it is running.

3. Now go to Daemon Tools and click ""Mount Image"". Here you will have to browse to the location of your download folder.

4. You'll notice when you open the Need for Speed folder that the browser doesn't display any compatible files. There is a drop-down menu that says ""Files of Type:"" you have to select All Files. When you do you should notice two files pop up.

5. OK, mount rld-nu2a. This is the first install disc. When the auto-start pops up go ahead and click install.  

6. Now there is a key required. Lucky for us the uploader supplied a keygen. Unfortunately he just didn't tell us. Go to My Computer and find NFSUG2_DISK1. Right click that drive and click ""Explore"". 

7. Now you should see 4 folders and some other items. One of the folders says ""Crack"". It contains the key generator and the no-cd crack :D

8. Open the folder and open rld-nu2k. *Note: Most Antivirus programs flag key generators as Trojans. It is a false alarm just ignore it. Now you simply enter the key and proceed with installation.

9. About half way through the installation it asks you to put in Disc 2. *Important: Make sure you replace Disc 1 in Daemon Tools with Disc 2. DO NOT mount them both at the same time or the installer literally gets confused and says ""Put in the correct disc"". Simply Unmount the first image and Mount the rld-nu2b. Once you have done that click ""Ok"".

10. Now the final part, When the installation reaches the end you have three options, DO NOT choose ""Start Need for Speed."" Just end the setup. Now You have to mount Disc 1 (rld-nu2a) again for the crack. Go back into My Computer and Right click NFSUG2_DISK1 and click ""Explore"". Open the file labeled ""Crack"".

11. Right click and copy the file labeled speed2. Now you need to locate the install folder. It is, by default, located in C:/Program Files/Need For Speed Underground 2. All you need to do now is right click that folder and click ""Paste"". When you are prompted to overwrite SAY YES!

12. Congratulations! You have just successfully installed and cracked the game. You can now open the shortcut on you desktop and play!

Sorry the guide was so long and most likely hard to read! I suck at making things very simple but i hope this is easy enough for anyone with little computer competency to understand. Hope it Helped XD"

I've read through all the comments and I couldn't find anyone with this issue.

I've got the game running great, except that whenever a menu pops up (ex: pausing, entering races, entering shops, checking mail, everything like that) the game freezes for about a minute and then goes back to normal. 

The game is completely playable and I'm enjoying it a lot, but these freezes at EVERY SINGLE MENU are annoying. It seems nobody else has this problem and I feel like I'm being left out in a way.

If anybody knows a fix for this issue, it would be greatly appreciated.

You're problem is most likely hardware. 
Ex: Processor speed, ram, video card, etc. However you may also try updating direct x.

I had the same problem on my previous pc, and it was literally a piece of shit. On my new one it works great. My specs are: 2.6Ghz Quad Core Athlon II Processor, 4 Gb DDR2 ram, and a 1GB Ati Radeon 4600 Series video card. "
,askikr91,2010-02-23T03:11Z,"Note: Earlier i forgot to mention that once everything has been installed. You must have either 

A) Disc 2 mounted
or
B) Disc 2 burned to a cd and inserted

,Slaphead09,2010-03-06T02:07Z,"Ok, for those who get errors about missing readme files and sdat.viv

I used Magic Iso and Magic Disc to mount these files... Then copied disc 1 into a new folder, and again with disc 2 into a different folder.

(Disc 1)
I manged to by-pass the missing readme error by copying all files from ""disc 1"" into a different folder.

Then I created a blank document called ""read me"" to replace the missing one, and ran the setup from that folder.

(Disc 2)
I done the same trick with the missing ""sdat.viv"" but don't forget to change the save format to ""all files"" when renaming it ""sdat.viv""

(Finish)
Once i had copied the files into the right folders i saved them as Iso files, the ran the installation. The installation ran without a hitch but once I ran the game it kept crashing. I've seen other comments by people who said it crashed on them so i guess the game just doesnt work on my OS. 

I know it works for some people, but it didn't for me... Let me know if this helps..."

3. Save as the file with the same name
4. Open the second CD image file. Look for SDATA/sdata.viv

,Mohegan,2011-09-05T23:17Z,"This torrent works fine. Thanks! 
For those of you having the two ""problems"" I had:
Open BIN files with Daemon tools by rightclicking the folder, click ""New Text Document"". Double-click the new file it created, and copy and paste the following:
FILE ""FILENAME.bin"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00

Change the FILENAME.bin to the name of each bin file, keep the .bin extension. File, save as, and save it as the bin's name with a .cue extension. This will create a cue file for each bin file that you can then open with DT. 

The other thing that is kind of funky is the crack. It is located in the first CD (mount the image for it, then open the folder instead of starting the installer, it's in a folder named Crack). I had to right click the file (speed2.exe, the other file is a keygen), moved it to Documents where I then renamed it speed.exe, THEN placed it in my NFS folder in my Program Files. After that is done, the game runs perfectly. "

I can do that now for others help.

1. Download any Virtual Drive software, install it, make at least one virtual drive.
2. Mount CD 1 named rld-nu2a.bin to the virtual drive, before running the setup, open the virtual drive copy and paste in your hard drive the folder or contents of folder named crack, now run the game.
3. When the game setup will ask for the CD 2, Unmount the CD 1 and mount the CD 2 named rld-nu2b.bin, and press ok in the game installer.
4. There is file named Need for Speed Undergroud 2.nfo, open it with notepad and there are your CD keys.
5. Before launching the game, copy paste the CONTENTS of the folder crack you previously copied in your hard drive, to the installation directory of the game.
