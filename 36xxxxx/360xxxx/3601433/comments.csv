I Support Kojima San to.
I have Buy The 3 Disc package,
But i upload only the Disc 1 and i mlake promo for MGS IV (-; .

But It's True, if you want support Kojima Prod,
Buy The game. "
,amoren,2007-01-24T17:05Z,"Thx for your understanding my friend..
didn`t the storyline in mgs3 just blow your mind, it was so flawless and proffesional, just like a blockbuster movie:)

Just like in MGS1:)

But MGS2 was really disapointing IMHO...

Can`t wait untill MGS4, Kojima said in a interview that he hasn`t worked so hard on a game like MGS4....!!! :D "

,diaketh,2007-05-30T17:06Z,I'm kind of curious... does the multiplayer option work with a burned copy?
,Bomis_,2007-06-11T21:12Z,"hi, is this for ps2 or ps3? ive already downloaded it but i won't waste a cd otherwise

ty for a great upload!"
,tyrelleze,2007-07-08T16:07Z,how do u play the game on ps2
,blemishednicely,2008-01-22T11:35Z,"I would prolly say by putting a mod(burn) chip into your PS2-but I've seen posts claiming successful gameplay of Kane & Lynch on Xbox 360 (even online!) poster refused to say how, though...could be B.S., or maybe there is a type of ""homebrew"" capability much like the PSP, wherein you can manipulate/surf the net through its network/wireless capabilities-not the focus of it's design, but a byproduct of its components-dunno how to pull that one off on the PS2/3, though-you can't hook it up to a laptop & play ""wireless"", it req.'s an ethernet bridge & a LAN (WLAN won't cut it). PSP wasn't made to be plugged in  @ home, so for portability's sake Wireless LAN is used, opening the door for the 'net handy! So my best guess is they're running mod'd machines..."
,blemishednicely,2008-01-22T11:42Z,"CAREFUL if you modify yours, though- ""burn"" chips at least used to carry a double-entendre, wherein proper installation would allow you to play burned discs...they were ALSO known to ""burn""/fry your entire electrical device's internal wiring/circuitry when hooked up wrong-and the fact that no licensed /knowledgeable service shop would legally install it made it a real bitch to  work out, I'd suggest finding that nutty guy who's always tinkering with gadgets 1st!"
,mondkaiser,2008-03-20T20:48Z,"When i run the exe for unpacking just in the end it says that it needs Metal Gear Solid 3 [Subsistence] [PAL] [FR-US].rar to continue unpacking, which doesnt exist. Anyone know?"
,RiRi89,2008-08-10T02:17Z,"i hef teh original 2, i bought when it comz aut! =D"
,Mordarch,2008-09-11T21:37Z,"This version does not contain the minigames Snake vs Monkey, Duel Mode or the early MGS games."
,lmmune,2008-09-17T20:40Z,"I need a little help. i finished downloading but not sure what to do. I havent used a ps2 emulator before and im not sure if mine is working right. I tried running the iso file, then i even mounted it and tried again and it didnt work. If someone could point me in the right direction I would aprreciate it. I will also keep seeding for a month if you havent finished Dl'ing it. PLEASE HELP!"
