Seems a little one-sided but then, interestingly, it's not really possible to find anything positive about the Freemasons from (presumably) non-freemasonic sources. Or maybe some of these films are made by Freemasons to laugh at the profane and how their devil-worshipping ways are running the world. Well ha-bloody-ha you bloody fraternal gits, you may rule some of the highest financial and cultural propaganda and corporate machines in the world but you look like a bunch of twats with your little short-arse suits and aprons hiding those limp-dicks of yours... err sorry, a bit personal maybe. Well it pisses me off. I guess that do what thou wilt is, after all, the whole of the law and if they don't manage things, someone else will. I just wish it were someone who didn't look like such a bunch of twats with such ugly symbols, gods and artwork. Ok I'm done."
