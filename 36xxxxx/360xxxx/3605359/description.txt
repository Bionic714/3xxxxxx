Ninjas invade Hong Kong in the action-fantasy Lethal Ninja! Director Herman Yau has tackled nearly every film genre known to man, from Category III exploitation (The Untold Story), to urban satire (Shark Busters), horror (the Troublesome Night movies), family comedy (Master Q 2001), and even romance (Fascination Amour). Lethal Ninja is another notch on the belt of the versatile director, who brings rare attention to character to his genre films. But Yau also provides action; Lethal Ninja is loaded with nifty ninja mysticism and campy martial arts action. It also has drama, pathos, and comedy, courtesy of wacky comic actor Dayo Wong.

Eva Huang (Kung Fu Hustle) is Xiao Ling, a super-cute ninja who works with her master (Eddy Ko) to protect a street musician named Copy (Dayo Wong). Evil mastermind Brian (Waise Lee) suspects that Copy holds the key to opening a mysterious red box that contains "Jinrui", which is said to cure any disease known to man. Brian intends to use Jinrui to manufacture a cure-all drug and make a ton of dough on the market, and enlists an army of ninjas to aid him. Xiao Ling wants Copy alive, but fellow ninja Hibiki (Shirata Hisako) is willing to kill Copy to keep the secret safe. The two female ninjas find themselves at odds, but when Brian's ninjas snatch Copy, the two must join forces. Can Xiao Ling and Hibiki use their deadly ninja arts to save Copy and prevent Jinrui from falling into enemy hands?
