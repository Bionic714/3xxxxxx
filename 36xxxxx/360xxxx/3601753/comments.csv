The Party (alternative title: ""Hollywood Party"") is a 1968 comedy written and directed by Blake Edwards, starring Peter Sellers (in what was his only non-Pink Panther collaboration with Edwards) and Claudine Longet. The film has a very loose structure, and essentially serves as a series of set pieces for the comic talents of Sellers.

The minimal plot involves Sellers playing a well-meaning, but hapless, Indian actor who is accidentally invited to a major Hollywood party, causing havoc. Sellers would play another Indian man in his hit film The Millionairess, and a similar (though self-important, unlike the humble role he plays here) klutz as Inspector Clouseau. The film remains popular among fans of Sellers as one of his most inventive comic roles, much of which was improvised at the time of filming.

The score of The Party was by Henry Mancini, including the song ""Nothing to Lose"".
