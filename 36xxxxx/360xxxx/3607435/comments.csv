,fabelkey,2007-07-02T23:51Z,"this is exactly what i looked for

,fabelkey,2007-07-03T11:21Z,"works perfectly...
you can also use it with windows vista on Macbook to enable the onboard sound"
,tekproxy,2007-08-01T05:43Z,Please seed.
,kyp77,2008-03-06T13:43Z,"hello, does this package include ATI graphic drivers and intel programs too? can you tell me what this package includes alltogether?"
,dionelr,2008-06-15T00:48Z,"This is exactly what I needed. It is one EXE file that contains all the drivers (video, sound, keyboard, iSight cam, mic, network, wireless, bluetooth, chipsets, etc.) for Windows XP.  I have a Macbook (not pro) and it works perfectly. Pair this with rEFIt and no need for BootCamp. "
,zilverster,2008-09-28T09:43Z,"yeah!
this is what I was missing, I hope
I have been trying for two days to get the drivers for XP...
Then I finally succumbed and read the manual...
But alas, setup.exe was not on my mac intallation dvd...
I hope that this will install drivers for ethernet controller, the keyboard etc, etc..."
,zilverster,2008-09-28T13:34Z,"... and it worked!
Now I can start working at home on the network application that only works on a PC

hurray!"
,virgilaug,2008-11-06T22:36Z,Wait what does this do?
,rangel_alex,2009-01-08T23:48Z,"I just installed this file on my macbook, but it didnt do anything. All of the little yellow boxes did not go away. Is there anything special to do??"
,redspade,2009-03-31T22:30Z,this worked for me. i needed to have the network drivers so i could get on the internet. ill keep this seeding for awhile.
