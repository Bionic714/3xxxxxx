I know what you all are thinking, why the *&$? would someone want to install windows on a mac?! I had no choice but to install Windows on my MacBook! For a lot of reasons really. the macbook is a great overall notebook except for one thing, the default hardware that comes with the standard macbook isnt enough for osx to run as smoothly as we all expected. 

I got the latest driver from Boot Camp 1.1.2 beta (which can only be obtained from using Mac OSX) and extracted the setup.exe file. Simply install windows and later run the setup file and it will automatically install all of the macbooks drivers.

a few photos of the process:
