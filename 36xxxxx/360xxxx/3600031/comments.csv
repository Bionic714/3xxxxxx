Power to the pixels!!!!! They certainly don't make 'em like that anymore - lol"
,funkybooty,2007-01-24T07:31Z,"you're welcome!

they definitely don't make them like that anymore.  i'll put up iron helix next then maybe lunacus in the next few days, all brilliant games for the time..."
,buckmate,2007-01-24T19:25Z,"If wanted to play an old pc game like 'commander keen' on my mac, would it be possible, i'm quite a beginner at macs and conmputer literacy in general, how could this be done, is there a better website to ask these sort of questions?"
,funkybooty,2007-01-26T04:38Z,"There are definitely better places to answer this question, but I'll give it a go.

If you have a new Mac with an intel processor, you can load windows xp (parallels, boot camp, etc) onto the mac and run the game.  If you have an old mac with a g4 or g5, your only option is virtual PC which should be easy to find around here.  virtual PC is brutally slow, but if its an old enough game it may work.

either way, probably more trouble than its worth..."
,katNcam,2007-03-17T13:26Z,"If you need an Intel Mac with Windows installed or VirtualPC to play this, why on Earth is it listed as a Mac game? Being a Mac user certainly has its perks but finding games and software is really difficult.  The listing says Mac Classic - does this mean it will run on a regular Mac that has Classic installed or does it really have to go the Windows route? Anyone out there have any ideas?"

Of course you do not need an Intel mac to run this game - or Virtual PC.

If you read post #4 (""If wanted to play an old pc game..."" the question is about to run pc games, repeat pc gemes, not the seeded game.

To run ""StarTrek 25th Anniversary- Mac Classic"" you need:

1. An old mac running OS 9 or earlier
or
2. A PPC (PowerPC-processor) mac with OSX and Classic installed (OS9 running simultaneously inside OSX)

An Intel Mac cannot run Classic, so there you have to google around for emulation alternatives (if there are any that really works in general and for this game in particular)"
