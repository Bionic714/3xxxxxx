It is written the manna would be laying in the fields outside their tents in the morning and came from god, and twice as much would fall on the 6th day, because they werent allowed to pick it up on sabboath. They didnt make it themselves! It came from god and is written so in the bible! (Read it yourself in Exodus if you dont believe me!).

So is this video a tool to discredit eternal god works? Could well be. Be wise o man! Satan is there hunting down everyone of you little weak sheep."

Just wondering......."
,mindbender13,2007-04-14T11:10Z,"Ravenfit, as long as there are believers like you we sceptics don't have to do very much at all. You do a superb job when it comes to discredit your own doctrines;)"

,smzeb02,2008-10-22T11:16Z,"Why do we have to leave insults as a response to an incorrect point of view. Ravenfit, M. Rood isnt saying that Israel made their own manna he is saying that they ground the manna up to make bread. This is a good video."
,clif.lawrence,2009-02-04T04:34Z,"considering they were wondering around in what was called the desert, I am sure they wished they could manufacture ""mana"", but what happend was, what ever this stuff was, there was just enough for the day, each day. 

I'm a Christain and I've figured out that alot of times Christians themselves screw up things by not giving God enough credit, like this stupid 6000 years thing.  Because a day on earth is 1000 years in heaven (like God keeps a calander in Heaven).  But what if he did? Then, speaking as a Christain, wouldn't that mean Jesus was in the grave 3000 years?  Thats stupid of  course. Me? I figure I'd get tired of manna after awhile but when its all you got..........   clif

oh, thanks for the movie.          clif"
