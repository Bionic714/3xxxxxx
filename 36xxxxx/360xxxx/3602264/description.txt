"The TRUCKFIGHTERS could fight trucks, because with tones that bitching and heavy, even a truck would be afraid of the fuzzy goodness emanating from the swedes. If you haven`t already, please download the live dvd they posted FOR FREE on their media page of the truckfighters website, the first time i watched it, a truck came out of my computer screen, killed me, brought me back to life, and started the concert over again. It is the definition of killer."- Stonerrock.com member Bulldozer86
