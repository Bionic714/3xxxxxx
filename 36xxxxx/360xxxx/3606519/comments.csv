The Video and Audio is as perfect as a purchased DVD.  Very Clear, sharp picture.
Crisp and clean audio too.

The Movie gets a 4.5 stars out of 5 for the actual
stortline and Plot!  This is the Goriest, bloodiest and most violent of all the Texas Chainsaw Massacres yet!  WATCH IT!  It's AWESOME!!"
