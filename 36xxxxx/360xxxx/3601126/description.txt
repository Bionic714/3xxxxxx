All 10 Episodes from the first half of Season Three - All properly named and numbered, all in .AVI format, not RAR'd or anything stupid like that.  This is a collaboration of single files ripped by others, offered as a convenience to those (like myself) who had to play catch-up over Christmas, 2006.  Enjoy!
