,Jark89,2009-03-18T10:12Z,"Thanks for the up, the game runs fine.  However, online mode seems to be broken.  If I select multiplayer, and try to create a new account, the section where you're supposed to enter the password seems to be broken - only a few letters can be input.  Afterwards, it'll try to connect, then give an error saying there's no network cable connected, even though my network is fine (firewall set to allow the game to go through also)."
