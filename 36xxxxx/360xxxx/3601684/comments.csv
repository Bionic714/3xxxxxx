,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-01-23T03:11Z,"is this a 640x1088? or is it a 1088x640(which would be 16:9. Secondly, if its 1088x640....how is that 1080i?"
,Olphus,2007-01-23T06:37Z,Is this the pilot?? Great show by the way.
,rush.chevsky,2007-01-23T14:10Z,"This is the pilot - part one. 
Part two will come later.
It was ripped at 1080i.(1920x1088)
Inverse Telecine from 29.97fps to 23.976fps.
Resize to 640x1088 H.264 with 3:1 pixel aspect ratio (results in 16:9 display with more overall pixel count and better pq than 960x544 xvid)
Two channel prologic ac3 audio converted to two channel aac (will still decode correctly through digital output)
Plays fine in Videolan and Showtime and directshow players that use codecs that support nonsquare pixels. "
