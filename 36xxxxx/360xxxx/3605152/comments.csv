I'm currently at 52.8%, but the Availability is stuck at 97.7% from 4 Peers.

If you re-Seed this long enough for me to finish, I'd be happy to Seed it for a few days."

Please re-Seed this file so we can all Seed it for you. It should only take you a few minutes to get that last 2.2% out there.

Please re-Seed!"
