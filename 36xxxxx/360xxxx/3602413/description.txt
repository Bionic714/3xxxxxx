A while ago i downloaded a 500+ megabyte file of fonts, only to find a bunch of zip folder inside zip folders with fonts inside folders inside folders indide folders....

So basically it was a total and complete mess of folders and zips and font etc...

I took all the actual fonts out of that file and made them really easy to find, AND made the file 400 megabytes smaller.


Hope you all enjoy my hard work.
