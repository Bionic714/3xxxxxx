,bobistheowl,2007-09-08T00:09Z,"Thanks for your hard work. It's always a thrill to find some new Scriptorium fonts, and this archive has so many! 

btw, the .pfm-.pfb fonts can be converted to .ttf and/or .otf format with FontLab Studio5. If they don't have it on thepiratebay, it's easy enough to find it on eMule. You have to complete the Font Header information to convert them properly, (pages 211-255 of the Studio5 manual)."
