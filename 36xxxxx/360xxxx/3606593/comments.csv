,Massmordaren,2007-01-30T13:52Z,"Yes! Wonderful!
I actually got this bird from eMule two weeks ago, but I accidentally deleted it right after it had been completely downloaded - since then, the queues have been extremely long, and I would have had to wait another two weeks before having the complete file. Thanks to you, however, that ain't necessary anymore!"
