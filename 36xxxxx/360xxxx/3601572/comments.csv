,Fahrenheit,2007-07-12T16:25Z,"This is hopeless... Stuck at 8,7 %
Got part 1 though - wied that only part 1 is seeded!"
,Fahrenheit,2007-07-13T01:05Z,"Wiiiii...
A user with 100 %..."
,Fahrenheit,2007-07-15T02:04Z,And now he's gone again... There must be someone who can seed this!
,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-07-23T20:30Z,"Reseeding now, this took many weeks for the swarm to get to full speed, and it may take a while to even get a full copy in the swarm. Help this LARGE seed out by seeding for awhile after finishing download! Thanks Everyone!"
,Fahrenheit,2007-07-23T20:56Z,"Thank you!
I will seed this after i download!"
