,HypatiaG,2007-01-26T15:25Z,"Please don't dowload or seed. In this particular case, I'd ask you to buy the film instead. Christopher Nielsen spent many years of his life on making this film for almost no pay. If any film this year deserves high selling numbers, it's this. If noone buys this film, he won't get mony to make more such fantastic films."
