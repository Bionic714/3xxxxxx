So let me get this straight... you are complaining about the movie you are STEALING being in a language other then english from a site that is located in a non english speaking country?
You sir are by far the biggest retard I have met today. 
Please disconnect from your ISP and go to school. I think they are serving sloppy joes today. Have a good time at school. Learn lots of useful things. Then on the way home die.
kkthxbye"

,thehuge,2007-02-21T02:53Z,"Holy fucking hell?! are you guys for real?? Ever heard of a ""little"" thing called IMDB, A Spanish movie, by a Spanish producer would be SPANISH!
And im pretty sure that IMDB tells you that.
If you by chance  downloaded (stole it!) it anyways and to your suprise found it to be in Spanish.. READ THE FUCKING SUBTITLES! You do know there is more countries on earth besides the glorious America?! And everyone doesent speak english so.. Tack your preferred hand, stick it down your throat into you own asses and try to find a little bit of culture down there! Tunnelminded ""yank"" fuck, how about being thankful?? Assclowns!"

Det är väl endast i skärmens sken som sådana som du klarar och vågar uttrycka sig så inskränkt och så idiotiskt. Man kan ju bli mörkrädd för mindre. Hur lyckas du? Snälla, säg aldrig någonting mer innan du lärt respektera andra människor! "

,SK234269,2007-04-25T06:28Z,"-sigh- I was reading reviews all day about this movie, and I'm dying to see it.  Some reviews of note were people who were disapointed in the subtitles. THEN, I come on here and read this debate/arguement/flame war.

Here's my 2 cents:

1) Movies with audio in their native languages will ALWAYS beat dubbed counterparts.  You can hear the actor's original voices and inflections.

2) Dubbed movies often change the meaning of what the writers are saying.  I watched a dubbed version of ""My Life as a Dog"" for YEARS . . . then saw the subtitled version and was FLOORED.  So many things were translated differently!  It was funnier, too.  I swore, at that time, I will NEVER watch another dubbed movie.

3) This movie, in particular, will be a real treat for me, as I speak/understand a smattering of Spanish, and there aren't that many well-known Spanish movies.

4) People who have problems reading subtitles and watching a movie at the same time must've flunked elementary English (or whatever language in which the subtitles have been written)

5) It has been my observation, particularly in the last 10-20 years, that American cinema is on a downward spiral towards fluff and trite bullshit.  Long live word-wide cinema!

--------------------------------------------------------

note about these comments given in response to bz:
""Actually, the movie not being american makes it even better."" and

""You do know there is more countries on earth besides the glorious America?!""

I find it ironic that in people's attempts to defend one nationality, they lash out in some way at a country that bz didn't even say he/she is from!

Don't assume that all hateful comments come from an American. We are not all prejudiced, but you sound just as hateful as the person you're ranting against.

Let's show some luv, and not return one wrong for another."
