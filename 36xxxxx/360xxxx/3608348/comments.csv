,roberth80,2007-02-03T01:39Z,Warning!! Winrar+Katalog+Winrar..Why??
,gigabyte4u2,2008-01-23T18:55Z,"If you are stuck at 99.3% download there is a work around . First of all you need to repair the archive using win rar otherwise when u try to extract the archive u will only get the rars for cd 1. Once you have an archive of repaired files you need to download an alternative torrent:
http://www.btmon.com/Porn/Unsorted/Black.Cherry.Poppers.2.XviD-SWE6RUS.torrent.html
I am using utorrent so I get the option to choose the location where the downloaded files are saved to so save to a folder called ""Black cherry poppers 2 rebuild"" for example. Now before you start to download you need to transfer the rar files you repaired to the new folder (Black cherry poppers 2 rebuild) once you have all the rar sets and the covers in the right place you can force a recheck of your new torrent (when my recheck completed it was 96.4%  downloaded) now just leave it to run and complete. Please seed once completed Best Wishes

P.S. You will be helpin out the peps who were downloading the other torrent as well as they were stuck at 99% as well, another lesson to remind us not to create archives or rar sets for bit torrents. Or maybe the uploaders just swap news group downloads into bit torrent files. I think that is probably the case"
