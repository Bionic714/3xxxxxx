FEMA Concentration Camp in Beach Grove Indiana
----------------------------------------------


Footage of a FEMA concentration camp in the USA as described in Rex 84. Rex 84 (short for Readiness Exercise 1984), was a plan by the United States federal government to test their ability to detain large numbers of American citizens in case of massive civil unrest or national emergency (such as government sponsored acts of terrorism e.g 9/11 2001). From 1967 to 1971 the FBI kept a list of persons to be rounded up as subversive, dubbed the "ADEX" list. They more than likely still do.
