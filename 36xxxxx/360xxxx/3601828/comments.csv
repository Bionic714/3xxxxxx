I dont know. then again maybe its for any of a number of other things, but I know it isnt for a concentration camp, thats just stupid."
,Shylock,2007-01-23T04:31Z,"my question is, what is your agenda for wanting to spread this garbage? I mean seriously...some propaganda campaign your involved with here."
,Shylock,2007-01-23T05:05Z,"I dont have any civil liberties? heh...see thats the thing about civil liberties, I dont need Fox news to tell me, cause I live them. Exactly what is it you think we cannot do anymore? hell we have so many civil liberties even idiots like you can, once you gain citizenship, come to my country and protest anywhere you want to against anything the gov is doing, and you wont be hassled by our gov. (I may beat the shit out of you though, but even then the gov will arrest me for doing it) I own multiple cars, motorcycles have a good job, can buy what I want where I want, and I might add pretty much anything thats available anywhere in the world. what exactly makes you like your government so much? what have they done for you?"
,Shylock,2007-01-23T05:11Z,"and fight for freedom. freedom does not mean anyone can steal from anyone else. I've been part of the community for many years. I believe in things like P2P in context. That doesnt mean I believe in totally stealing things being allowed, nor selling these things to make yourself money like others do. That isn't freedom thats just being a thief. there is no 9-11 conspiracy. "
,Rune_DK,2007-01-24T01:10Z,"Not gonna download the bullshit. But as far as I'm concerned you could send the jihadist in Concentration Camps. They wouldn't hesistate for a second to kill you. So why should we care? Screw them. 

/Rune, Copenhagen.

Alternative I could torture them with a cartoon."

,FamousP,2008-02-28T03:23Z,"To the dumb fucks that think concentration camps in the U.S. is bullshit. Rex 84 was exposed during the Iran Contra hearings ... There are tons of official congressional records that not only inform us about concentrations camps also known as civilian work camps, but some even outline in great detail the location of some of these camps. We've had these camps for a long time now and two were used to hold Japanese Americans ... note they were Americans born in the U.S. and they were stripped of all their rights and made to be prisoners. Now, dumb fucks, since we know that our lovely government has used them in the past, what the fuck makes you think they don't exist now?

Stop downloading porn for a week and educate yourself. Go ahead, make some idiotic comment about how you just know you're never going to get fucked so therefore you don't need to watch this stuff.

Better to be a little paranoid and prepared rather than simple-minded and locked up into forced labor.

One more thing for the dumb fucks. Under new executive orders that totally disregard any freedoms you think you have, any high ranking military officer can simply walk up to you and say ""I declare you an enemy combatant"" and detain your ass without the right to a trial, a phone call, or even the right to inform your family.

Wake the fuck up. "
,toopro,2008-04-02T22:44Z,"I don't think that anyone who fails to see the weird smell around 9/11, is opening their senses to their full capabilities. I mean, it's pretty clear that the official story of the public media can never be the whole truth. By the whole truth I mean: all the information the authorities have and should share, like photos, footage, audio recordings, etc.

It's also safe to say that the official story we got deals only with tiny grains of truth rather than a complete, coherent truth. If the government would be doing what they're verbally saying what they're doing, then a complete coherent truth is, I tend to believe, what they should be giving to the people. Also they should be providing more footage, and high quality images and photos. The pentagon and the world trade center were not using some kind of half assed security system. They were using the real thing obviously. So a 1024x768x32bit wallpaper of the moment supreme would've been the least they could've provided.



To keep things simple, I usually toss out the whole conspiracy thing. It's way too complicated and scary, and the simple facts that everyone can see and will agree to are scary enough. So let's just deal with facts.

The other fact, besides the fact that the official story is an insult to any sentient being, is the following:

""Yes, the official 9/11 story is really true and that is what must have happened"" is something that sounds ridiculous to 99.9% of the people in my surroundings. Also it sounds ridiculous to at least 50% of the total Dutch population, and my educated guess is that it's the same in many places outside the Netherlands.

On the other hand, I don't blame people for ridiculing torrents like this, and conspiracy stuff in general. Even if only 1/1000000th of it is true, it's pretty impressive and scary. It's just not easy to deal with.

I don't think we should be nationalistic, btw. 

People can be so blunt. Did you check out the borders of the countries in Africa? A lot of 'm are straight lines. 

Shylock, you seem to live in the idea that life is valuable because you can own 'precious' objects, like cars. Do you really believe that being able to buy products is such an enormous right and bliss?

Also, do you even realise that child slavery and illegal labor has been performed by Nestle (Mars, Snickers, M&M's, etc.), H&M, and a lot of other big companies? Yeah... think about that when you're eating your Mars-bar, full of slave-picked cocoa :)  Yummy.

Not to forget about the addictive short-term-bliss-inducing casomorphine that your body metabolises from the caseine (from lactose, milk, yoghurt, etc.) that they add in copious amounts and varieties of concentrates to all this nice chocolate candy.

Anyway, I really don't blame anyone for saying ""WTF?! That FEMA camp shit can't be true... fuck that... I ain't goin' into that.""  With so much weird shit going on (Shylock: I even heard that in the US there is actually no law that forces you to pay tax--and also, we all know that the tax that you and I pay is being used to make weapons for wars)

From time to time you'd better keep a nice safe place for yourself, or you might wear out too soon :)

Everyone take it easy..."
,nwatts,2008-04-20T23:39Z,"Shylock, you can't protest anywhere you want in America. Many cities require you to have a permit to protest and set up so called ""free speech zones"" meaning you can only protest in certain areas. You might want to look at the Victory Act which gives the governments definition of a terrorist, its shocking. Prepirations have been made for martial law and fema camps have been built for this purpose. Do more research, there is a threat of globalization supported by elements of the U.S. government."
