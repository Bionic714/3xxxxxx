,faris_ruhi,2007-01-24T22:37Z,"Thanx for the up. Will seed.

Great uploads so far, BRING ON SEASON 2 NOW!........ please.... lol.

Anyways ya, keep up the great work, and I'll help seed.

Thanks once again."
,pirateghost,2007-02-02T00:13Z,"yeah please up season 2 if u can - even if there aren't that many people who download it, it's their loss really, as it's one of the best sci-fi series I've ever seen. And us lucky enough to appreciate it should help each other out ;) (I first saw a few episodes on a local tv station that only had the first season; I've been looking for the rest of it online ever since - and I'm really looking forward to finally watching season 2)

I'm always gonna help seeding, too.

u got some cool stuff man - keep sharing ;)"
,NisseP,2007-02-03T14:28Z,"please. i also want the 2nd season. keep up with your good work.

:-) "
,NisseP,2007-02-04T08:38Z,"Grrr.. Yesterday me and some more pple got ready, I stayed up with my torrent to seed this some more... Today i woke up and found out that the rest of the seeders have gone. 
Now i am stuck with three leechers. And i have already a ratio of 2 - and the other assholes just left.
Why can't people help to seed. Why do they have to leave as soon as they are done themselves and just leave the rest. GRRRRR
I can't find words for how angry i am ..

:-("
,NisseP,2007-02-04T14:47Z,"Some ppl seem to come bakc to help to seed. That is good.

We have to help each other to complete the downloads...."
,faris_ruhi,2007-02-06T22:39Z,"Sorry guys. I couldnt help seed as I wrote in the comment before. About 2 hours after my download was complete my computer decided it wanted to crash on me.

So I spent some days fixing it while juggling school work. I finally got it working again, and I am seeding right now.

But ya, sorry for the time in the middle where I didnt.

I hope Xenn99 puts up those second season eps soon."
,pirateghost,2007-02-07T01:37Z,"NisseP: I know what u mean man - I've got a ratio of 6 myself, that's about 10gb uploaded for this one - and on each of the other 3 Mysterious Ways torrents I have a similar upload.

I don't currently leave it on all the time as I don't have the hard drive space atm to keep them all going, but I always jump in when there are less than 2 seeders...unfortunately this seems to happen frequently - nobody likes to seed apart from us 'regulars' :S just people being selfish I guess.

So yeah, sorry for the downtime there - but rest assured even when I'm not seeding I'm checking the torrents daily, so any shortage of seeds will be just temporary."
,wollepyk,2007-02-08T00:30Z,"I've been seeding these torrent like 'ghost: on and off, but mostly when seeds were low/none. I choose to dedicate my upload rate to the files that need (and deserve) it the most, but on a rotational basis.
The important thing to keeping a torrent alive however is not so much to seed massively, but regularily, and I intend to do so with this series: bandwidth rather than hd storage being my bottleneck.
A thought about season 2: other large and not-so-recent torrents seem to stick around a lot longer when they are bundled as a whole season or series, rather than in smaller packs, and individual eps seem to die almost within the week.
So bring it on, and thanks to Xenn99 and fellow shareholders for this enjoyable series - and wouldn't Adrian Pasdar make a fine Doctor Who?"
,Xenn99,2007-02-08T19:22Z,"Thanks people for the great comments,

i'm seeding quite some torrents atm, when they are done i will upload the next season..

Would you all rather have the complete Season 2 as 1 torrent? instead of small parts.

Still missing episode S02E20 so can't give you that one :( found one on emule but it seems to be dead..

Cheers Xenn99"
,faris_ruhi,2007-02-08T21:31Z,"I'm fine with either, complete season or small parts. Id prefer the complete season in one torrent, but lets see what the others have to say about it.

Oh and about S02E20, I can encode it, I have that one. As you may have known I actually started encoding Mysterious Ways Episodes before and had released three since I couldnt find them anywhere on the net, but then you started releasing the packs so I stopped.

Although Im not too good at encoding and the quality of my encodes doesnt look as good as yours. I think mainly the colors. But ya I do have that episode, and if you want me to encode it I will."
,wollepyk,2007-02-09T07:05Z,"Faris, you could upload it un-encoded while we're waiting for Xenn99. Then he could encode and include it with the rest for a neater pack. And, yes, although the wait may be longer to watch an episode, I believe a single torrent is better for the community."
,faris_ruhi,2007-02-09T19:16Z,"Okay lets see what Xenn99 has to say about it.

Here's a sample from one of my encodes, I encoded the first 11 eps anyways even though Xenn99 started releasing the eps online when I was only on the third because his first 11 eps have like 2 or 3 mins.

But I downloaded his anyways looking at the quality, and really those 2 or 3 mins didnt matter, sometimes they just added a little bit to the story but nothing significant.

Anyways ya tell me what you think of the sample. If it's okay, I could encode it and then send it to Xenn99 directly, and then he could create the season torrent.

My encodes are anywhere from 340 - 350 mb."
,Xenn99,2007-02-11T01:35Z,So guys i finally did get the 20th episode in the same quality =) will upload the new season soon :-)
,wollepyk,2007-02-11T07:00Z,"Great!

/me is still wondering where ""here"" Faris put his sample. :-)"
,pirateghost,2007-02-11T09:19Z,"great Xenn99, looking forward to it :) btw - I also think one torrent for season 2 would be better"
,faris_ruhi,2007-02-11T17:30Z,"lol guys, I posted the message and realized that when I pressed Ctrl+V it didnt post the link to the sample.

I tried to post the link right after and piratebay kept on giving me database error. But it worked out for the best as Xenn99 got the episode."
,wollepyk,2007-03-05T18:47Z,"Yes, soon please, Xenn99. Just look at all those downloads by now, and we're all begging for more. :-)"
,evanuschka,2007-03-11T22:12Z,"Thanks a lot for the upload, I've been looking for this for a while, it's great you make it available. 

I am helping seeding now (share ratio of 4 to almost 6 on the first four ""packages"") and would absolutely help seed the second season as well.

Would be great if you could make it available.

Cheers, mate."
,Xenn99,2007-03-18T01:09Z,"Finally, the second season torrent is online,
had some connection problems lately.
everyone enjoy =)"
,cbennett,2007-04-04T14:00Z,I'm new to torrents and I am tying to get all the first season episodes.I will glady upload once I get them.Can u please seed the torrents for me.
,death734,2007-12-23T06:28Z,"hmmm BSGTV looks like they just renamed you rips and pred them on the scene as A) they released 9 PDTV episodes in a row, and unless there was a marathon thats very unlikely they would realease 9 with in seconds of each other, and BSGTV is know for downloading none scene DSR/PDTV from torrents, renaming them and preing on the scene"
,BlueTigerPirate,2008-01-09T17:15Z,What happened to episode 19?  It is in fast forward.  Can you try to get a better one of this episode?  
,silentapprentice,2008-04-05T00:53Z,"isn't there any way I can just download episode 19 by itself?  That was the only one I was interested in.  Also, I've had my computer on for two days trying to download this torrent in limewire and it is still at 0%.  Can anyone help me out?"
,azazriel,2008-05-25T12:10Z,"Does anyone know if there's a full Season 1 torrent anywhere for this show?

I have looked around both on TPB and did some rudimentary googling, but haven't come up with anything.

The wife loves the show and there isn't a station around that we can get that has shown/is showing:

1) the episodes in order

2) all the episodes

Any help finding a Season 1 torrent would be most gratefully appreciated.

Thanks!"
