,lakers4eva,2007-02-03T19:04Z,"I allready got this game, but it had much smaller size. I don't remember exactley, but it was around 3, maybe 4GB. Why is this 6,2 GB???"
,lakers4eva,2007-02-03T19:44Z,"Well i check it, the other one is only 2,5GB. Why in the world is this 6,24 GB??????????"
,Metal_Micke,2007-02-03T20:52Z,Because the game is supposed to be this big. The 2 gb one is probably fake or a ps2 version or something like that.
,blaffe,2007-02-04T00:41Z,ive played the 2.5 gig version.. it works fine.....  the movie clips is ripped to smaller size..... the quality isnt even noticeble... so. download the 2.5 gig instead
[T],Knaster,2007-02-04T01:02Z,metal_micke ure totally wrong
,mesohony,2007-02-04T03:10Z,I don't know whos right or wrong about the size of the game but... at this download rate I should complete this download in about 3 years all the peers have 4.2% no 100%ers...I started when it was uploaded!!! Sooo SKANELAND are you gonna seed this or what???
,351c,2007-02-04T05:25Z,"i agree with mesohony

,ironwolf56,2007-02-08T03:28Z,Is this thing going incredibly slowly for anyone else?  I've had it running 27 hours and it's only 8.3% complete.
,351c,2007-02-08T03:45Z,"ok finally got the game
and yes i am seeding it!
i burnt the game iso with alcohol on the slowest speed which is 6x although it detects my double layer disc is only 2.4x speed. So the slowest  alcohol would burn was 4x and it works and it installs without a hitch!
the controls are tricky  they will take ya a little while to know. otherwise the game is awsome!!
the other prob i am having now! where are the cheats for health or god mode. there are some trainers out there but every time i use them they either frig up the game or just dont work.
any cheats out there ?? you know please post..

worth the download heaps of action
great upload Sk책neLand 
keep up the good work.."
