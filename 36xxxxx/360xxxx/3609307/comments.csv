,hereitcomes,2007-02-02T23:56Z,Why is it showing no seeders or leechers.  I'm assuming I have this thing seeded correctly.  Or does it just take a while for the site to update.  This is only my second upload so excuse me for the ignorance.
,kyrkbymannen,2007-02-03T19:34Z,"Hereitcomes, they are many pretty shitty people here, who always download then close the torrent just the second after completion instead of sharing 1:1 !

It sucks.... but thanks for the share dude, i will share 1:1 when i got it!"
,hereitcomes,2007-02-03T20:00Z,I agree but what do you do.  I'm getting pissed off now.  I'll keep seeding until there are 2 or 3 seeders.  Maybe somebody will read this and seed the fricking thing.
,ntrance2k,2007-02-04T01:46Z,"there is way to many leechers on this tracke, prehaps TPB should have a ratio system and bann all members who fail to share back to at least a ratio of 1.0

this might stop all the fcukwads who leech and moan when they cant download some thing.  "
,hereitcomes,2007-02-04T14:38Z,"hope your funished downloading cause I'm not seeding anymore.  To all that did'nt share, you're losers.  To those who intended on sharing, sorry."
,newt4208282,2007-02-05T14:46Z,"I dont know if you noticed but it says than 0 people have completed. I've been downloading for 3 days and I'm stuck an 95%.My share ratio on this file is 1:1,I think its pretty shitty to stop seeding before anyone completes it. If your having a problem with people leeching and not seeding back,then I suggest using demonoid,people there seem to seed and keep the file alive for a while."
,hereitcomes,2007-02-05T18:52Z,I will try demonoid.  I apologize for removing the seed but my software notifies me every time I complete an upload and it was'nt beeing seeded by anyone else.   
,hereitcomes,2007-02-05T19:15Z,"seeded, share"
,fastcarr,2007-02-05T22:52Z,"Need a seeder for this.  There are about 40+ ppl sitting at 97%.  I have been watching this from the day it started and NO ONE has finished it yet.  So, hereitcomes, your software thats telling you its been completed is flat out WRONG!"
,Shazian,2007-02-06T08:35Z,"This one is dead, i was also sitting stuck at 97% for ages with this one, he have re-done the torrent here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3611997/WARGAMES.ISO

And i finally started getting it again."
,lighter,2007-02-06T16:31Z,"If You're downloading the Wargames-torrent that has stopped at 97%, delete that torrent-file and download this torrent
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3611997/WARGAMES.ISO
to the same iso as before. The new download will append to the old iso-file."
