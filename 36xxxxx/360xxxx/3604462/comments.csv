Due to many suggestions, I will be switching to HE-AAC or the new VORBIS in the next seasons of SG:Atlantis, SG-1 (if there will be next season), and Battlestar Galactica.

I just wanted to keep technologies used in my encodings CONSISTENT in every season of a series, so after i start making one season in a certain way, then i have to keep it up to the end of that season."
