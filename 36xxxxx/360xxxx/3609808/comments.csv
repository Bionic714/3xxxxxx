Temple of Love was in fact originally released in 1998 from Dino Music in Holland. Very little is said about the creators of the album, only that their last names are Dekker, van Es and Papen. If I was asked to speculate, I would guess that their full names are Jan Dekker, Ruud van Es and Rob Papen. Ruud and Rob were the guys behind the group Peru, Holland's equivalent to Tangerine Dream.

Temple of Love is mostly an instrumental album with ambient-electronic programming similar to Enigma's earlier work. Song's like Temple of Love and Voices in the Dark feature gregorian chants, while other tracks contain ethnic chants and sampled instruments. There is a prominent beat throughout most of the songs."

I've had this almost 12min track named ""Erotic Dreams"" from 2002 (""last modified""), when I first got interested in Enigma, but I've found out that it's not really his.

It's a really nice song with some gregorian chants and tribal sounding beats with echoing synth melodies. So this is one of the songs made by these ""mystery people""? Is it impossible to confirm, and does it really have no ""official"" artist name at all?"
