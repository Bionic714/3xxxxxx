It states that this version is not a virus but its mistaken as one.
No Virus Threat in Nero 7.7.5.1
With development of Nero 7, we used innovative methods to display pictures and videos. Some of these methods were used for the first time in version 7.7.5.1 and adapted to Windows Vista?. As these methods were previously unknown to antivirus software manufacturers, this resulted in a virus warning being displayed during the installation of Nero 7.7.5.1.

Please be advised, these methods have been examined by antivirus software manufacturers and have been classified as harmless. The relevant updates of the virus definitions have been carried out. Once the antivirus software has been updated, virus warnings should no longer appear during the installation of Nero 7.7.5.1.

Warnings in spyware and mailware which appeared while initially installing Nero should also no longer appear after updating the relevant software (e.g. Adaware, Spybot Search & Destroy).


This torrent works like a charm. Nothing wrong with it. THANKS"
