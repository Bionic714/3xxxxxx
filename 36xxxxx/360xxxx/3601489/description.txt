Chicago\\\\\\\'s own Eleventh Dream Day have been making records for over twenty years now, although in recent times, the group has become a \\\\\\\"part-time\\\\\\\" operation. ZEROES AND ONES - one of the BEST albums from 2006 - is their first release in over 6 years... but it is brilliant and well worth the wait. 

FROM THE ALLMUSIC GUIDE 

\\\\\\\"...One of the most resilient and criminally underappreciated bands to rise from the Midwestern underground community, the career of Eleventh Dream Day was a textbook study in alt-rock endurance; despite a nightmarish major-label tenure, the group persevered, ultimately emerging as elder statesmen of the flourishing Chicago music scene,,, In a better world, Eleventh Dream Day would be universally acknowledged as indie rock elder statesmen and one of America\\\\\\\'s great post-punk guitar bands... They built their reputation on blistering live shows and released a string of albums that rocked as hard as anyone in the late \\\\\\\'80s and early \\\\\\\'90s. Zeroes and Ones is their first release in six years, but they haven\\\\\\\'t lost a step. Band leader Rick Rizzo delivers paint-peeling guitar work throughout as well as being the primary writer and vocalist. Doug McCombs (also a founder and member of Tortoise) bass work is as muscular and melodic as ever, driving tracks like \\\\\\\"Dissolution\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Lost in the City.\\\\\\\" Drummer Janet Bean only takes one lead vocal, but her paired vocals with Rick Rizzo have always been a key part of their sound. Zeroes and Ones is probably the album that best showcases all sides of Eleventh Dream Day, and might just be their best album yet. Let\\\\\\\'s just hope it\\\\\\\'s not another six years until the next one...\\\\\\\"
