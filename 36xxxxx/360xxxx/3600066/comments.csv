,mzoftman,2007-01-21T02:07Z,"It's not a virus. Its a 1337 keygen. Please seed when your done downloading the file. thanks guys, I hope to upload a lot more than this."
,mzoftman,2007-01-21T08:23Z,"You can use whatever you'd like, but the keygen works perfectly. I've used it."
,Cleric Marty,2007-01-21T08:24Z,"Dear mzoftman: Does this have Visio 2007 or Project 2007??  Or are those separate downloads??

Thanx,

~Cleric Marty"
,mzoftman,2007-01-21T08:29Z,"No, sorry. This has neither. I'm almost sure that those are different  downloads. I will check. So just wait a minute."
,mzoftman,2007-01-21T08:30Z,Nope. I just double checked and it does not have either of those. Sorry to let you down.
,Cleric Marty,2007-01-21T08:38Z,"Hey mzoftman, you did not let me down, I will search untill I find it.  But thanks for sharing a NON-VIRUS download!  Let me know if you need any programs, been doing this for years...have tons of programs, OS's..you name it....

,unloosed,2007-01-21T09:00Z,"If this isn't fast enough or doesn't work for you guys, try this torrent.  Currently over 200 seeders and less than 100 leechers (according to TPB at least).  Mine is also just a hair under 500MB, rather than 642MB.  Not sure what the extra stuff  is, maybe some extra help files or templates?  Perhaps mine is just compressed more.  

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3586709/Microsoft_Office_2007_Enterprise_Edition

No offense intended mzoftman.  Some people can't get mine to work (for whatever odd reasons, hundreds obviously have gotten it to work fine), I'm sure they have or will come here to yours as an alternative.  I'm simply offering the same alternative to anyone who can't get yours to work for whatever reason.  "
,griped,2007-01-21T09:46Z,which languages?? norwegian??
,mzoftman,2007-01-21T10:18Z,Multi-Language support. Norwegian included.
,unloosed,2007-01-21T11:06Z,"Ah, that is why its larger than mine.  My torrent is English only.  

Good job on finding a multi-lingual version of this that works, mzoftman."
,sambenet,2007-01-21T17:56Z,"hello and thx a lot, activation is possible? i mean ill be able to download models in word or not? thx again"
,VladimirMolotov,2007-01-21T20:46Z,"When I dowload it, then what? Could someone please explain the right way to make the installation process go smoothly?"
,mzoftman,2007-01-21T21:59Z,"This is an ISO file. what you have to do to get this to work is create a virtual drive using a program such as Alcohol 120%. After you have created the drive you have to MOUNT the image to the drive, and the installation box should appear the same way it would as if you inserted the CD.

I will work on getting a better installation guide up here soon, so please be patient.

PS - Activation is possible. YES you will be able to download models and open them through your new 2007 programs.

Thanks you."
,D4mpChilD,2007-01-21T22:01Z,seed al of us are stuck at 74.4 % we need you seeders
,VladimirMolotov,2007-01-21T22:20Z,So doing the trick with Nero 7 is not recommended?
,unloosed,2007-01-21T22:35Z,"Nero 7's image drive program should work.  

If it doesn't, there is a free version of Alcohol 120% called Alcohol 52%.  Try it.  Or you can download 120% from here on TPB.  "
,VladimirMolotov,2007-01-21T22:44Z,"Actually I first downloaded unloosed's office 2007 and tried to install it with nero 7, but kept getting an error message. Now I'm downloading this one since perhaps the multilingual version contains danish? Maybe the English version won't work on a Danish XP pro? Thanks to both of you for taking time to answer me here. And thanks for uploading the programs...;-)"
,VladimirMolotov,2007-01-21T22:46Z,"seed al of us are stuck at 74.4 % we need you seeders

right!"
,mzoftman,2007-01-21T22:47Z,"Nero will work. ANY ISO image mounting prorams should work. Here is the download link for Alcohol 120% Trial Version. I'm not sure but it seems like it lasts forever with just a 10 second wait when ever you start it up...Haha.

,horgh,2007-01-22T14:40Z,"Does this have Finnish language? When I try to install, it doesn't ask anything about language and tries to update my old Office 2003 FIN, I want to be sure that this new one will be in Finnish also? Is it possible or not? And how can I install it in Finnish?"
,crazy-c,2007-01-22T16:44Z,"This does not contain other languages than the standard ones. Danish, Finnish, Norwegian etc. are NOT included."
,mandog,2007-01-23T00:25Z,"for people that are confused this has limited support
for most languages it also will take you to the lang support site were you can update the lang you want and use power iso to mount the image on virtual
drive simple i used v3.04 from this site you can auto update this is the bus take no notice of the wingers and the key gen works support the guy
that made this available don't fucking winge"
[V],jnd,2007-01-23T10:23Z,"""Odd because I thought Office 2007 just uses a standard serial?""

Yes, it can do, and it'll install with that.

However, you need a unique generated key to get some extra features from Microsoft Update, like ""Save to PDF""."
,mzoftman,2007-01-23T12:40Z,"thank you or clearing that up, jnd"
,crazy-c,2007-01-23T16:45Z,"""for most languages it also will take you to the lang support site were you can update the lang you want and use power iso to mount the image on virtual""

Could you please elaborate on this?"
,mzoftman,2007-01-24T12:55Z,why not just use the keygen in the torrent? why do you ppl make everything so difficult
,LaGuitarraMuerta,2007-01-24T22:55Z,"hi guys... sorry to bother here, this sounds like a perfect download,  smooth and clear... but all i get are three files, a .mdf, a .mds and a windows program... they don't look as ISO use to look, and i can burn them in a CD, but they are not working as installers when i put the CD back in... any help?"

The keygen in the torrent was not working for me, so i used the serial code instead (provided in these pages, thanks for that my friend)."
,Kukelikki,2007-01-24T23:48Z,"neat torrent. use PowerISO, works just fine"
,bonedoc10021,2007-01-25T03:21Z,"Thanks for the great UL.  Program works perfectly fine.  One thing that is needed is the saveAsPdf&XPS.exe addon from MS.  We can not DL this from MS website.  Does anybody have this file? Or know another place to DL this?

Thank you"
,karnautrahl,2007-01-28T10:27Z,"Most excellent Dude. Seriously.
I scanned this with my Nod32 after mounting it in Daemon tools*. Installed, keygen and ran it.

One thing other users might enjoy knowing is.....it will validate on MS's site, so you can have the PDF extension if you wish.

I love the publish to Blog feature, just wish they'd add blogspot to it ;). It's faster than Office 2003 (at least on Vista) and this particular torrent is solid. Well done, and much gratitude on my part.


* (note current Daemon has a ""spy ware addition that you don't want installing-windows defender kills it!)"
,Ziad87,2007-01-28T12:29Z,"Thanks for the upload, mzoftman. Do you know by any chance if the torrent is the official unmodified iso for the RTM version of Office 2007 downloaded from MSDN? Can you also please provide the md5 and sha1 check sums if they are available?

Thank you very much."
,mggrlica,2007-01-29T02:38Z,"You actually need Proofing Tools for Office 2007 in order to obtain the so-called ""language package"" you people are talking about. As a matter of fact, you will not be able to find on the net any of those downloads for ""language support or spell checkers"" or whatever name you want to give it. You must buy Proofing Tools for Office 2007 in order to get spell checkers and language interface which is to be released as soon as the customer version of Office 2007 is out in stores.  "

I have not ran into this problem myself. I would Google it if I were you. If you can not find what you are looking for on Google I recommend re-download this torrent and trying at all over again from scratch.

PS - Were you mounting the image or did you burn it to a disc?"
,bonedoc10021,2007-01-30T03:18Z,Anyone have the saveasPdfandXPS.exe file that you need to save in office 2007?
,mzoftman,2007-01-30T04:17Z,"You can get it by regisering with Microsoft onl-line on their website. You have to validate your Office pregram. This torrent was tested by me and a few friends and it is safe to validate on-ine. Then once it is validated you will be able to download updates and Office Appz suck as SaveToPDF.

,Dunnbass,2007-01-30T23:40Z,"Thanks mzoftman, i figured it out after searching error 1406 (not error 1407, my bad) on microsofts website. I didnt turn off my spysweeper and it was stopping the installation, when i turned it off it worked perfectly."
,bonedoc10021,2007-01-31T07:37Z,"mzoftman,

Thank for the fast reply.  I again and tried to get it off the MS website as you suggested.  And I am not able to do this.  I keep getting the following error: 

Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007:
Validation Failed 
  The product key used to install Office has been identified by Microsoft as misused, stolen, or not valid.

Seems like too many people have used the key possibley.

Anyway you can UL the new file for this and also possible the Sounds.exe file?

Would appreciate it if you can do that, or anyone else who may have the files. 

Thank you

,Nil satis,2007-07-01T18:20Z,To un4givon this is a image file you need to mount the image on to a virtual drive use daemon tools or nero it is quite simple just open daemon or nero and find the iso file in the folder you have saved it to and just select mount to drive. You now have a virtual cd/dvd sitting right in My computer just like if you had inserted the ofice cd into your fixed cd/dvd drive now just install it.
,Absolutfalk,2007-07-02T18:34Z,"Nu börjar jag bli jävligt trött på office 2007! Har laddat ner 3 olika torrenter, den här och en på 489 o en på 1,2 gig. Efter ungefär 75% får jag upp ""fel 1935 Ett fel uppstod vid installation av sammansättningskomponenten""

Har testat att mounta filen i alcohol 120, brännt den i dvddecrypter o i sonic, både på DVD o CD... men inget funkar...

Någon som har några förslag?"
,Altus-Scipio,2007-07-08T17:21Z,"Will this conflict with the home/student edition of office 2007 that I got preinstalled on my laptop?

I'm only really looking to use Publisher 2007 anyway, so is it possible to ONLY install that while leaving all other programs from home/student edition?"

,Fishrobber,2007-07-18T02:05Z,"Hi there, can someone help help me out here! Im not new to torrents or extracting/mounting/burning programs but I'm having some difficulty with this particular download. Can someone tell me how to extract or mount these files - I need all the steps. I have ISO buster, Alcohol 120 and nero virtual drive but I cant figure out how to use the MDF and MDS file.

Yes, I'm stupid, but MDF/MDS files? Honestly, whats wrong with just a normal ISO file? Thats much easier and can be extracted with winRAR..."
,Fishrobber,2007-07-18T02:50Z,"OK, never mind! I figured it out anyway.

For anyone else stupid like me, here are the steps I took:

1. Download ISOBuster (you can get a cracked version of ISOBuster PRO from this site)
2. Once you have installed it, open ISOBuster and drag the .mds file into the box that says ""no media present""(left side) then drag the .mdf file on top of the .mds file
3. A list of folders/files will appear on the right hand side of ISOBuster. Select all of them, right click and extract.
4. Run ""setup""

*For anyone having problems with corrupted files (missing ww.cab, etc.) try extracting the files again. Sometimes they get corrupted during extraction or burning to a CD/DVD. If you are burning it to a CD, try setting a slower burning speed (ie. 8x) because the slower the burn, the less likely it is to corrupt files. 

There were no viruses or malware in neither the program or keygen. I scanned it with the latest version of PC-cillin 2007.

,HenkusFilijokus,2007-10-05T15:56Z,"I can´t seem to install this (or any other distribution) on my Vista setups. Could someone please give me a hint?

The computers are running Vista Home Basic and give me the error messege ""X:\Enterprise.WW\oinstall.dll could not be found or is not valid""(or something similar) every time. Oinstall.dll is clearly there. The same thing happens with every distribution I´ve tried, as well as with the Office 2003 wich I use on several XP machines. There was no problem a while back when I installed 2007 on my brothers Vista Home Premium-laptop.

I haven´t been able to find a resolution anywhere and I´m actually quite clueless as for what to do, please help!"
