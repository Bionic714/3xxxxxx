 I used this editor for ages until some bullshit happened. Now I've been using other Hex editors as I usually don't need to open large files but WinHEX was the shite for editing large files so thanky doody praetorian_00 ;) Thanks for seeding this essential editor. 

Noobs - learn to edit files, go read some stuff, learn the vocabulary used. Unless you just want to follow guides all your life a bit of algebra will come in handy. The more you read the more you learn. Go find all the docs you can and read them when you have the time as it's similar to learning a new language but with plenty of algebra. Or bury your head in the sand and never worry about what is happening under the hood, never learn what is hex and never learn the hidden capabilities of software, hardware and virtualware.

""Did you tell your son how good wanking is for you""? - Quoted by James Kirk (well he thought he was Kirk) to my Dad and Grandmother to my amusement (a car had driven over his head once so he wore a shirt with tyre marks on it). 
Now he didn't understand hexadecimal code, the equivalent to a script kiddie (Tier-Three). You want to aim for Tier Two minimum, then Tier one. Then you can sell out to a huge corporate if your a real wanker."
