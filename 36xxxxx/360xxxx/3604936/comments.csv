,cpkonig,2007-04-05T18:15Z,"Can anyone tell me if these three Cd's are three different programs, or do they all combine to make just the one. eg, the first CD is an installation program, but what about the other two, I can't get them to work. Any advice on this? Thanks."
,dune008,2007-08-23T09:42Z,"Thanks. But I found it difficult operating properly with an error messeage, saying ""memory is insufficient to play it"", and CD2 and CD 3 is unable to extract with some errors... I wish I had a correct solution to practise IBT!"
,efkolo1,2007-10-07T10:36Z,"Hi, can anyone tell me how to run these programmes? It seems they are copyrighted and they need a no-cd crack or something like this... Thanks."
,anabrasil,2008-01-06T02:56Z,can somebody seed again these files? I really need them! thanks! 
,ujrdazn2,2008-05-03T03:54Z,These are three files all with rar extensions.  Each is only about 57 meg.  I am wondering why the company would put out three cd's when it would all fit on one.  I tried to un-rar these files and got nothing.  Maybe it is just me.  I also contatenated all three files and still got no useful data.  I tried to rename the files so they were rar with numbers and still no go.  The text inside the files says it is an iso file.  I think Boyan should make a new torrent that is just the true files from the disk.  Or maybe he/she is messing with us.  
,J_STH_YHO_ACT,2008-06-02T23:32Z,"Estoy de acuerdo, es mejor que los subas nuevamente sin descomprimir

es un torrent relativamente peque単o es mejor el archivo original"

,bikerabhinav,2010-10-11T08:06Z,"Okay!
FIRSTLY TO BOYAN(uploader):
Dude If you're uploading something please for the love of God, take the pains to write its full name and description. Atleast tell the source and save peoples goddamn time.

SECONDLY (now that boyan is a lazy arse) 
this is the same torrent as 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5442531/Kaplan_TOEFL_iBT_2007-2008_Edition_-_Full
i.e. Kaplan TOEFL iBT 2007-2008 without the ebook. Yes it just has the software no ebook.

THIRDLY:
No matter how lame this is, It works!!

Fourthly (to all other commenter's who downloaded and came back to say thanks!)
I know the first question in your  mind while downloading this must be ""WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY""
Well, this is what others think as well. So once you found out that it was Kaplan TOEFL iBT 2007-2008, couldn't you do some social work by posting what it actually was, rather than saying a lame thanks!

TO ALL
get a life! "
