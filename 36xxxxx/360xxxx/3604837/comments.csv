,Undietaker,2011-10-17T02:22Z,"30 years have passed since Arkadin's pregnant wife and their dinner guests were brutally murdered by a gang of Satanists in the director's mansion. Since then he has remained hidden, until suddenly he invites a group of actors to reconstruct the tragedy - live on the Internet. It's not long before the border between fantasy and reality starts to blur. Could the murders that take place be for real?"
