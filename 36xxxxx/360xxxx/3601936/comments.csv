,ksoktogon,2007-01-23T12:34Z,"Why on earth is giving info such a big problem? All you need to do is type in
amazon dvd ""The Prestige
in Google, and here is the link:
http://www.amazon.com/Prestige-Hugh-Jackman/dp/B000LC55F2"
,GothDude,2007-01-23T12:43Z,Thank you ksoktogon I totally agree with you kolll you irratate the fuck out of me not putting info on your uploads I spend ages trying to find out exactly what the fuck you've uploaded only to find that Its something that I wouldnt be arsed about watching! Dude respect for upping loads of stuff but for fucks sake would it kill you to give a little info???
,screenslave,2007-01-23T12:56Z,"GothDude: And would it kill you not to use ""fuck"" in every sentence? Yep, man, that's really smart: scolding someone with a lot of fucks sure makes them wanna do what you say. Get the fuck out of here and grow a brain instead. Pathetic. Man, you whine like a little cry baby from kindergarden, about not being able to find information. Well, if you haven't noticed, it IS possible to use the Internet for a lot of stuff - like finding info. But I guess your keyboardskills are limited to the use of F U C and K."
,snabbhet,2007-01-23T14:58Z,"I agree completly with screenslave, GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND.
Then there is IMDB.com just put the movie name in and u got all the info, if people could learn how to use the internet they could stop whining on others. I dont understand how people can say they spend ages on finding info about a movie...thats really bs. And yes GothDude there are more keys on the board than just F U C K ."
,fasterthanhell,2007-01-23T16:19Z,Ilike fuck:)
,st.EVIL,2007-01-23T16:22Z,I like to fuck too   : )
,jomos352,2007-01-23T17:28Z,Audio - English 5.1 - Spanish 5.1 - French 5.1  does this imply that the video quality is low like shit?
,markinlowell,2007-01-23T18:04Z,How about just commenting on QUALITY!?!?!?
,prabhuit,2007-01-23T18:30Z,Can some1 rip it and upload?
,ruben123,2007-01-23T18:53Z,"Just saw sample... Quality is great.
It seems like a real dvd-rip :)
Cant wait to watch it!!!"
,backdoorbeauty,2007-01-24T00:16Z,wtf ... replicrap??
,dilligaf1968,2007-01-24T13:02Z,"just to let you all know, the quality could be a lot better, it has been shrunk with DVD SHRINK but this is good enough until a better version shows up.  thanks for this"
,Tickler,2007-01-24T14:54Z,This has to be shitty shitty quality. Dvdshrink and just above 3000 kbps... and what genious would keep useless spanish and french 5.1... just to ensure bad picture quality? A movie like this deserves better.  
,dennis_516,2007-01-26T22:48Z,"my downloading speed is too less ,about 20 kbps i wonder if its same for the others or do i have any problem with azureus adjustment...can someone answer that..."
,boknows,2007-01-28T03:29Z,"i downloaded this file, and i can't extract it, it says im missing a file.  anyone know how to fix this problem?"

,o0Gizmo0o,2007-01-28T21:28Z,"I found some danish subtitles, how to put them in, in this movie?"
,naxpax,2007-02-09T19:41Z,"""Error( access denied, peers limit reached)"" from tracker

,B-manSwe,2007-02-24T10:04Z,aaa ha ha ha Replicrap.....i cant say i disagree....i have downloaded about 5-10 releaseas with Replica that didnt work....so Replicrap it is....
,barton101,2012-08-09T09:09Z,"Next time, please at least include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
