During the Wilson Presidency, the U.S. Government sanctioned the creation of the Federal Reserve. Thought by many to be a government organization maintained to provide financial accountability in the event of a domestic depression, the actual business of the FED is shrouded in secrecy. People of the world will be shocked to discover that the principal business of the FED is to print money from nothing, lend it to the U.S. Government and charge interest on these loans. Who keeps the interest? Good question. Find out as the connective tissue between this and other top secret international organizations is explored. Each episode of Phenomenon: The Lost Archives offers an in-depth exploration of an event that defies explication, or examines the untold secrets behind the stories you thought you knew. Hosted by Dean Stockwell, each tape investigates the facts behind the legends. In Phenomenon: The Lost Archives -- Monopoly Men, viewers investigate the Federal Reserve, a mysterious entity that controls the flow of the national economy and money supply. The history of this organization is examined as well as its contemporary assignments.
