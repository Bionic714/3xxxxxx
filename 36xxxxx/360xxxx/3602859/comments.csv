,khannibalsen,2007-01-24T17:52Z,any subs?
,eccles,2007-01-25T12:49Z,"Limited releases are often from unusual regions, have subs missing, or have some other problem such as DD2.0 only. I've just checked the nfo for this and it looks like it has uncompressed 16x9 video, DD5.1 and DD2.0 English audio and just Dutch subs.
HTH."
,loedertje,2007-03-13T23:14Z,"eccles that's really complete bullshit what you're telling here.

A movie is LiMiTED when it has a limited theater run. Generally smaller films (such as art house films) are released as limited. The scene considers a movie limited when it has a generally opening in less than 300 UK theaters, or in less than 500 USA theaters. In the scene jargon, it's ussually called 300 UK screens, or 500 USA screens. Officially, it's not the opening weekend's number of theaters that counts, but the peak of the number of theaters. For example; when a movie has 275 UK screens in the opening weekend, and 1 week later it has 325 screens, it's not limited.
