ALL CTRL-ALT-DEL webcomics from start to 01/22/2007

They are all available (free) at http://www.cad-comic.com/index.php

But as there was no easy one-click download, I figured a 900 comic package would be nice and easy. they are sorted by year in folders and are numbered by date. I have included 2 Applegeeks comics used in a direct reference. 

I just added them to the torrent as it pisses me off when things like this are in one big rar file. This way you can view them as they download.

I know its not much but I got tired of taking and wanted to give back, This is what I got, I hope you guys and gals enjoy!
