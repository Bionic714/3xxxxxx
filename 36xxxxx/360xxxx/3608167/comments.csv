,death734,2007-02-01T17:31Z,"thanks can't wait for the other episodes (i prefer them the way you do it since they are properly encoded at about 350mb, not like the files which have no audio that got uploaded after this torrent)"
,rodent,2007-02-01T17:59Z,"thanks, this is the shit."
,i2mfan,2007-02-01T18:42Z,"H121: I already do that myself(simple). I was just suggesting that it would be done at the source. I was prepared to upload that episode but you beat me to it. ;) and I don't double-post a torrent so not to split the seeders. Maybe next time I will be first :D

,H121,2007-02-01T18:53Z,"i2mfan: i sent you a pm, as i dont cap them myself
"
,H121,2007-02-01T18:59Z,oh and what time did you get the episode yourself?
,death734,2007-02-01T20:21Z,where did this actual .avi file come from before you uploaded it here.
,i2mfan,2007-02-02T14:26Z,"Same rip as before episode 9 for those that want individual files(not pack). Compare resolution/codec
