,Jackio,2007-01-22T16:57Z,Thanks mate. Is it the XP compatible version or the  original release?
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-01-22T17:26Z,"This is--AFAIK--the original release, but is 100%-compatible with WinXP."
,mRMack,2007-01-23T22:52Z,"thanks man, lets hope this one works better :)"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-01-24T10:10Z,"Yeah, lemme know, mRmack how it goes by commenting here. hehehehe"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-01-24T17:52Z,DeltaGammaAlpha: I have no idea why you'd possibly get that error as Dune 2000 was not made for DOS.  :I
,jekin,2007-05-12T01:53Z,how do i go about installing this? do i have to burn it to disc??
,townsmitty,2007-06-14T22:08Z,"ah,WinstonSmith6079,very nice job! and to those who have missed the c(l)ue.(eg deltagammaalpha)
install Nero express or better{Nero7 ultra edition-enhanced(must have..)-you can get it on thepirate-I am not seeding it for f'n nothing} and double click on the cue file, Nero will start automatically and burn the bin file on cd.
The cue file contains the info, the bin file has got the game. "

[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-10-27T03:26Z,"Hmm....  Dunno if it runs on Vista or not.  It DOES run on XP, though.

People, post here about whether or not this works on Vista or not...."

,Mantlemoot,2008-03-26T01:04Z,"I can't get past the registration demands

They shouldn't be necessary should they?"
,Warricks,2008-04-21T18:44Z,"I got the same problems as Mantlemoot, I need to register at Westwood? Anyone can help fix this problem?"
,asdf234,2008-04-23T15:14Z,"Reinstall the game, and when you choose the part to where it installs to make sure you have seperate directories for the Dune2000 game and the internet shared files.  That is what worked for me."
,Warricks,2008-04-23T16:07Z,"Thanks asdf234, that worked fine."
,Sunderas,2008-04-28T00:49Z,Thanks upper!

,cobracomm,2008-06-10T20:03Z,"also, I found a Trojan horse Generic 10.AKCL in the Dune2000.exe. Using AVG. Not sure how dangerous that one is.

Anyone else?"
,onothodox,2008-06-12T13:35Z,yea i also found a trojan but to make things worse when i restarted my comp i came to find that my dune.bin file had been deleted....
,onothodox,2008-06-12T13:57Z,"luckily i had alrdy copied the game to my bros comp now i have reinstalled the game but im still getting problems in getting the game to run, ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item""      wth is dat supposed to mean?!?!?!?!?!?"
,cobracomm,2008-06-15T13:26Z,"got the same thing with multiple Dune 2k torrents...it could be that upon first detection, AVG writes something into the Windows registry.

hmm, gonna try renaming the file or something.

you know it's a cool game when you're willing to troubleshoot crap like this. :)"
,jepjepp,2008-06-27T10:32Z,How can I change the game resolution? Some of the game goes out of the screen and can't play this way...

,everfrag,2009-09-18T05:25Z,"mathew9170, you would get daemon tools, alcahol 120% and use that to mount one of the files, it still uses the other file so keep it in the same folder. check for game disc in virtual drive, autorun usually comes up anyway  "

,Light92,2010-08-10T16:08Z,"Worked great, thanks. Oh, and if you're having problems with it while running it in Windows XP, try Windows 2000 compatibility mode. Not Windows 98 or 95 or anything, but Windows 2000."

with intel GMA X3100 and compatibility off.
Thanks for posting!"
,Ojelle,2011-08-08T13:57Z,"It does NOT work with 64bit, it DOES WORK with 32 bit, if you want it to work on 64bit , you have to install xp or lower inside windows 7. (dont know how) Tried both my original disc as this download. This one works with 32bit (it has nothing to do with wath version of windows)"
,Svefn-g-englar,2011-09-26T14:34Z,"Original installer is 16-bit aka won't work with a x64 OS. You can either install Windows Virtual Machine with Windows XP Mode or find an updated installer (http://forum.dune2k.com/). 

If you plan on using this torrent, you will need some sort of emulation to install the game. Once you install the game on your virtual PC, copy the files onto your actual computer. Make sure you also copy the MOVIES and MISSIONS folders from the disc. You will need to update RESOURCE.CFG with notepad. 

The only NO CD patch I could find was also based on a 16-bit installer, so crack the .exe before copying to your x64 system."
[T],-Gabe-,2012-02-10T22:40Z,"When I open it, it looks like this 
http://www.hostup.co/images/30708165712346530360.jpg

Please somebody tell me how to make a good resolution :("
,I-Like-Onions,2012-08-15T22:09Z,"To those wonder why the screen shifts when you start the game, the screen shifts because the resolution DLL is an old one. Old games tend to have issues with screen alignment and coloring.

Right click on your desktop and click ""Graphics Properties"", continue to the ""Display Settings"" tab and click, ""Aspect Ratio Settings"".

When the little window pops up, click either ""Maintain Aspect Ratio"" or, ""Center Desktop"".

If you maintain the ratio, lower your screen size to help the game keep up with the pixel decompression and filtering.

If you choose to center is, the same is true as ratio but, this time it gets little tricky because you might still have a black box around your game.

I've had this picture shift happen to me with the Warcraft 1 game but, I managed to fix it by going into the text files and resizing the resolution to fix my screen. its not easy."
,I-Like-Onions,2012-08-15T22:11Z,Ugh... So many typos -.-
