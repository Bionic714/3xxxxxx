This is the Driver needed to use the Dynex DX-DTCAM Webcam. Dynex doesn't have the driver to download on its website, and the driver CD comes with a bunch of bloatware and crap no one wants. I extracted this driver myself, so it's barebones and it works perfectly. 

To install, extract the rar to a folder on your desktop, then install your new hardware using the "have disk" option, select the "dynex webcam" folder, and select the "OEM7" file. You'll be good to go.


Enjoy!
