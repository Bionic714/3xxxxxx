Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Award-winning Autodesk Maya software is a powerful, integrated 3D modeling,
animation, effects and rendering solution. Because Maya is based on
an open architecture, all your work can be scripted or programmed using
a well-documented and comprehensive API (Application Program Interface),
or one of two integrated scripting languages. This, combined with an industry-leading
suite of 3D tools, means Maya enables you to realize your creative ideas.




Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

unpack, burn or mount & install.
check crack/install.txt on the seperate maya85cr.rar file

We decided to make the crack seperate, because this is hybrid DVD using hfs ad cdfs
we didnt want to recreate and make our own DVD, this is the real retail DVD untouched

Enjoy!
