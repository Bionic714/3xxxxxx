i even copied the edited aw.dat & awkeygen.exe in documents & settings.
i could not understand the function of run utility.
please someone save me. it took 12 hrs to download!!!
thank you all."
,CG_CG,2007-04-27T22:46Z,"It can be tricky at times.

Here's how you easily do it without having to use the command promt or other stuff.

Basically,

-First go to Programs ---> Autodesk ---> Common Utilities --->FlexLM License Utilities copy the ethernet code from the System Settings tab, it'll look like this, ""1028f66r273f"" if there are two numbers separated by a space, only use one.

-open the Aw.dat file with Wordpad (sometimes Notepad will get you confused as it'll have a square instead of the correct space).  Past that number (no "" marks) over the ""yourethernet number"" or whatever someone typed in the aw.dat file, and save it.  Save this to the desktop.

-go to C: and create a folder named FlexLM
Make sure it's in the C: drive.  Now, move the aw keygen to there.  Now, drag the edited aw.dat file from the desktop and drop it ON TOP of the aw generator.  Then click the generator and it'll generate a little license file.

-Now go to  the Autodesk Licensing program, and click ""all tasks"" and say you want to install the license from a file .  Browse to the aw.dat file on the desktop.  Click it and use it to install.

Now, make sure you have a firewall blocking Maya, or it'll access the net and basically corrupt the AW.dat file.

,cmusv,2007-07-07T05:59Z,"To install on linux:

You will need to write the hardware address of the ethernet card on YOUR box to the aw.dat file that comes with the crack.

To get the hw address on linux, run from a terminal: /sbin/ifconfig eth0
 And copy somewhere the hex number next to HWaddr, copy it without the ':' or '-'.

The crack only works on windows, so to run it you will need access to a windows box.

- edit the aw.dat file as described by CG_CG and write the HW address there.
- run the crack passing the aw.dat that you edited; this will add the license key to it (for more instructions read the crack/install file).
- take the cracked aw.dat file to linux, save it in the directory /var/flexlm (you'll need to create it), and thats all.
- install maya, if you didn't already.

,1lilledreng,2007-08-26T12:42Z,"I had problems making the licensing work. Most of the text in the aw.dat ended up wrong when following all the steps. 
Instead of choosing ""install license from a file"" (in step 8 of the description) i chose to manually write in the licensen, copying the text from aw.dat. By doing that, MAYA licensing recognizes which part of the text string that is faulty (text is red), and by deleting that text it worked for me.

I assume you have extracted the ""awkeygen.exe"" and ""aw.dat"" files from the ""WinRAR archive"" to the desktop!

1.  After you installed ""Maya"" click on ""Start"" -> ""All Programs"" -> ""Autodesk"" -> ""Common Utilities"" -> ""FlexLM License Utilities""
__________________________________________________________________________________

2.  Under ""System Settings"" copy the code from ""Ethernet Address"" to the ""aw.dat"" file and save, (you must open it with wordpad to do this!)


Normally it will look like this:

FEATURE MayaUnltd sgiawd 2008 permanent uncounted 0 \
        HOSTID=your_host


Insert the ""Ethernet Address"" replacing the ""your_host"" to:

FEATURE MayaUnltd sgiawd 2008 permanent uncounted 0 \
        HOSTID=001a92d7e859


Remember that ""001a92d7e859"" is my ""Ethernet Address"" so it will not work for you!
__________________________________________________________________________________

3.  Inside your ""Local Disk"" (C:) drive create a folder named ""FlexLM"" and send ""awkeygen.exe"" there.

4.  Drag and drop the ""aw.dat"" file you just edited on top of ""awkeygen.exe"" then double click on the ""awkeygen.exe"".

5.  Now click on ""Start"" -> ""All Programs"" -> ""Autodesk"" -> ""Autodesk Maya 2008"" -> ""Licensing"" select ""I have a license that I need to install."" -> ""Next"" -> ""Next"" -> ""Browse"" find aw.dat located on the desktop click ""Select"" -> ""Next"" and you're done! Enjoy."

I will just mention where you can have troubles.

When you go through the ""run"" step, you could get an error message saying that the file wasn't found (or something like that). You need to copy the two files (AW & AWkeygen) into C:\Documents and Settings\""your user name"".
Then you do the ""run"" step.
Next you could have troubles when installing the license. All you have to do is go to the  ""flexlm"" directory (previously created) and double click the ""awkeygen"" file, it will generate another file. Now  install the license from the ""flexlm"" folder, NOT from ""your user name folder"".
Restart, and that's it!

,ksj1989,2008-12-12T18:16Z,"I have sucessfully installed it on mac osx. I have the new 2008 macbook, so heres the complete guide as to what i did:

*You will need to be able to send two small files to a windows pc and will have to connect to the internet via ethernet cable NOT airport*

1. Download ""unrar"" or something similar and drag the Autodesk Maya Unlimited 2009 ISO folder into the program once downloaded to extract the files.

2. Once extracted you will have a maya_2009.iso file and the crack file. Open up the maya_2009.iso file.

3. Now inside, open the Maya folder and then MacOSX. Then open the Maya 2009.mpkg file and follow the instructions to install.

4. Once installed, the program will be saved in your applications in a folder named ""Autodesk"". Inside you will find another folder called maya2009. open up and doubble click on the Maya program with the red logo.

5. Now heres the part where people seem to go wrong, so follow carefully.
 Minimise the Maya program for now, which will be asking you to register.

6. ***Connect to the internet using an ethernet cable NOT airport***  Now go to""System Preferences"" then ""Network"" and click in the ""Ethernet tab"" which sould bring up details, including your ""Ethernet ID:""

7. Write down your ""Ethernet ID"" number without any spaces or"":"" . It should end up looking like this: 0043f57045f4. *Note. your number will be different so dont use mine. I think they are allways 12 characters long anyway. If you arent connected via Ethernet, your mac wont show the correct number as I found out. Yes its wierd!!!.

8. Now remember the ""crack"" folder that you extracted earlier. You have to get that folder onto a windows pc so that you can open it with notepad. I have set up file sharing with my windows computer, so I just sent it across the network. You could just put the folder on pen drive or something and send it that way. Save it to your pc desktop.

9. Now open the crack folder on your pc and copy both the ""aw.dat"" and the""awkeygen.exe"" and paste them into either c:/documents and settings/""your user name"" if you are using xp. If you are using Vista it will be just something similar like c:/""your user name"" as ""documents and settings"" have been hiden in vista.

10. Once they are in your user area, open up the ""aw.dat"" file with ""notepad"". Here you will have to replace where it says something like ""your host ID"" at the end, with the Ethernet ID number you wrote down earlier. Dont include a space or "". It should look like  HOSTID=0043f57045f4. Once you have made this change, go to file menu and save.

11. Now go to your user area where the 2 files are and drag and drop the ""aw.dat"" file on top of the ""awkeygen.exe"". Although you may not realise this, the keygen has now edited the ""aw.dat"" file.

12. Now open up the ""aw.dat"" file again using note pad and have your mac ready with the maya program open. You will have to choose something along the lines of ""I would like to install license from a file"" NOT serial number.
Then choose the option which says something like ""I would like to paste in or type in my licence"", I think it was the second option down if i remember right.

13. Now you will have a box which you can type into. You now need to type the text contents of the ""aw.dat"" file which is open in notebook on your pc, exactly as it appears in notebook into the box in maya.

14. If you have typed exactly what was in notebook into the box you should be able to press the continue button at the bottom and complete the installation.

Hope this prevents a few suicides and hairloss!!!"

,grarr,2008-12-22T22:00Z,"Hi i followed ksj1989's guide and i get up to entering the license in the text box and after typing what it says, along the top it no longer says there are any errors. I hit complete and then it says that the installation was incomplete because the keygen number is of invalid length and that FLEXlm may not recognize it.

please help"
,baezelon,2008-12-28T15:14Z,"for those of you having trouble in running the program.pls follow the steps.Most of the problem comes from the folders.Remember.When you extract the crack to the flexlm folder,make sure to not have a folder""crack""included inside the flexlm folder.the files that must be inside  the flexlm folder must be the aw.dat folder and the awkeygen.exe.

Flexlm folder not FLEXIM or FlexIM.
if youre done with this,run the aw.dat and awkeygen.exe in start>run.then after that run maya 8.5.install license from file.locate the aw.dat.

i hope it works.FOLDER must be Flexlm.ok hehe"
,madmonk69,2009-01-13T14:29Z,"Mac OSX install notes.

Firstly thanks to ksj1989 - for pointing out the key mistake I think most people are making - that is you must be connected using your ethernet port and use that network ID or MAC address for that network adapter and not your airport one. 

What I did to install.

1. boot up winxp  - in my case i used parallels on my mac.

2. Create the folder FLEXLM on C: drive on your Windows XP machine.  I think you could even create it on your desktop if u prefer.

3. Copy the aw.dat and awkeygen.exe to C:/FLEXLM/  or to whatever folder on your desktop.

4. Back on your MAC OSX - goto the finder -> apple menu -> system preferences.  Navigate to the NETWORK ICON under Internet & Network.

NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU ARE CONNECTED VIA ETHERNET not Apple airport.

5. Under Network, click the Ethernet Label in the left window pane.  On the bottom right hit  ADVANCED.  Navigate to the tab ETHERNET.

Here you will see the ETHERNET ID.  Copy this 12 digit number separated by colons e.g. 00:00:00:00:XX:XX .

6.  Go back Windows XP.  open the aw.dat with Wordpad.  Replace the YOUR_HOST with the 12 digit Ethernet ID.  

NOTE:  Remove all colons - number should now look 00000000XXXX 

HIT SAVE and CLOSE WORDPAD.

7.  Drag and Drop aw.dat on awkeygen.exe
check aw.dat by opening up with wordpad.  It should look something like this

FEATURE MayaUnltd sgiawd 2009.000 permanent uncounted BB6C871XXXX \
	HOSTID=0017f2c2XXXX

(obviously without the X's at the end)


8.  Copy the aw.dat into OSX.  This is easiest via WinXP as it shows all hidden files on the MAC.  

its located under the root directory of your OSX install under /var/flexlm/

another way you could easily do this with out turning on hidden files on your mac is by using the FTP Client FILEZILLA which also shows hidden files without turning them all.

9.  Thats it your done.  No need for any activation if you copied it to this directory.

alternatively you could copy the aw.dat file from winxp to your desktop on OSX.  But then you would have to goto the product activation.  Choose Activate by file.  Locate the file and hit activate."

,Porgy,2009-01-27T04:20Z,"For those having issues please try this. 
Before opening aw.dat file go to File>run
type in CMD
At the prompt type in ipconfig /all
Look for your PHYSICAL ADDRESS
write this entry down
Open up aw.dat in notepad
where is says YOUR HOST ID replace that with the physical address entry without any dashes
Save and close.
Drag and drop the aw.dat file onto the awkeygen file
Now open up the licensing program and select the aw.dat file. This should fix it. Enjoy/ "

,QuiKshot,2009-03-19T10:27Z,"FYI to Ubuntu\Linux users. 

To get this working on linux, you must first follow the directions htrh gave from here:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=66859&highlight=maya

But in order to get your aw.dat file ( Your license file ) working, you will first need to go to the console/terminal and type:

ifconfig | grep Ethernet 

and you will get something like this:

eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  
wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  

**obviously, the X's will be some number.

one of the eth #'s will be the one you need. ( Most likely eth0. small chance of it being one of the others depending on your drivers/config ). Take those numbers, remove the "":"" between them, and replace the your_name line with the number in the aw.dat as normal. This means you will be making multiple aw.dat copies. You will have to make multiple folders for them since you cannot have more then one file be the same name in the same folder :P 

Then, take these aw.dat files along with the keygen, and get them on a windows machine ( I used XP pro ) make a folder in drive C: called FLEXLM and drag'n'drop aw.dat files into the keygen file. Open them up and you should get something that looks like what the other posters here have pointed out. Now go back to Linux and continue the tutorial on installing maya with your cracked aw.dat file ready to install. 

enjoy !"

,sonofsmallface,2009-05-25T19:24Z,"I've successfully installed it several times... but unfortunately I have a bit of a problem - don't know if anyone knows how to fix this.
The point where you drag the flexlm folder you created into the var folder - I thought it was in the folder but I must have missed when dragging and dropping and it ended up in the same folder as var - but not in var itself.  When I ran the program it didn't work.  I've tried uninstalling, deleting every trace of autodesk I can find, re-installing and trying again but it doesn't work.
What do you have to do to get it to work if you fluff it the first time?"
