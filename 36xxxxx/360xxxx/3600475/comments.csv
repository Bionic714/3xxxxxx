When you don't even know there is a PRO-version available in addition to the lame free version you are pointing us at....

IDIOT!!"
,ukoa,2007-01-21T14:44Z,"at risk of being called an idiot...

I had the free version of Google Earth.
I uninstalled it so I could install this version.
I now have this version installed and I dont see a difference.
This is the same as the free version. This IS the free version. 
You can simply go to Help-About Google Earth and compare the versions.

Sorry"
,drteeth,2007-01-21T22:38Z,"Seeder probably calls this the full version as Google Earth 4 is just out of beta...so it's the free full version, just not the Pro full version. The seeder does not say otherwise in all fairness."
,ukoa,2007-01-23T13:31Z,"agreed.
I tried http://maps.live.com/.
I don't see how that could possibly be any better than google.

there's no earth details at all.

jroc261: why do you say google earth sucks now? If anything it's only gotten better. Are you just bored..."
,rowborough,2007-01-26T12:17Z,"For the last time it is impossible to crack google earth Pro as all info on accounts are stored on there servers, If you want Google earth download from them most torrents are virus or trojan ridden.

Version 4 of earth has a far better graphics engine and utilises DX9 structure, but is at the moment a little temperemental and has driver issues with many graphics cards (they assure me they are working on this).

I would advise carrying on using version 3 for a bit untill they iron out the bugs.

And give up trying to crack pro its imposible.

(I why would you want it anyway, it uses the exact same image libries as the free version, it does give you faster server responce and allows video capture and higher res print output) but the pluss version gives most of these benafits for $20..."
