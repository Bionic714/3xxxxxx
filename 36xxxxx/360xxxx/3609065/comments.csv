From the wiki:

The Charles Mintz studio adapted ""The Little Match Girl"", including its grim ending, into a 1937 Color Rhapsodies animated short, considered among the studio's best films."
,A Murder of Crows,2007-04-08T22:42Z,"Actually, i mis spoke in the last comment.

i'm actually looking for a claymation version shown on PBS back in the 80s that looks like it was done in the 50s or so.  if anyone can point me in the right place, i'd be grateful"
