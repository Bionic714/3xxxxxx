Episode Three - Iron Coffins
The largest U-boat housed 44 crew members who lived in their weapons of war for 
days on end in cramped and squalid conditions. Of the 38,000 men who fought in 
these machines during World War II, 30,000 would die in their iron coffins. 
Experience the Allied strategies and tactics of 1943 that caused the men in the 
U-boats to suffer the highest mortality rate of any fighting unit in the history 
of war.
