,tullyvey,2007-07-19T17:54Z,Am I missing something?  Where's the password for the rar file?!
,tullyvey,2007-07-19T20:36Z,"Sorry, my mistake!  KTorrent doesn't check all data integrity by default (and so missed the corruption detected when I forced a check), and then Nautilus' intrinsic extractor mistook a CRC failure for needing a password :P

Got a good copy now :)  
Many thanks!"
