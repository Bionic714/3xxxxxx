Are the english subs normal or for the hearing impaired (deaf)?

Thanks again."

The cover dont say anything about the hearing impaired, but when i choose the english subs they look like they are for the hearing impaired. You know, writing when there are background music, showing the name of those who speak ect.

I hope this helps you..."
