Metapsychic records presents its second release "Vox - Innerpolarity".
This album consists of very well produced Goatrance that has its roots back
in the old days. Combined with that and the new style of Goa that we are
spreading we think this album will serve the Goa community very well.

Tomislav is Vox, born 1976 in Zagreb (Croatia) where he currently lives today. 
Music and music creation on a computer became one of his interests not long
after geting his first computer, Commodore 128, about 1990. Serious first steps
in music were made when he got an Amiga 500 about 1994, and discovered
ProTracker, music software that looks and somehow feels like Microsoft Excel.

That was time when his fascination with Rave culture started to take place.
Inspiration for the first tracks came from early trance, techno and hardcore
tracks of the time, which were played on big Future shock rave parties held
in 1990s in Zagreb. He discovered goa trance in around 1995, and it was love
at first sight. He got his hands on many releases of international artists
and started to play, and getting practice in DJ skills.

Being rather unhappy with the direction trance music was going in 1999 and
2000, he decided to lay low for a while and later decided to start producing
the music he loved and wanted to listen to. And here we are today with the
first Vox album!
