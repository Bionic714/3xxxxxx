,ufpa,2007-01-29T10:44Z,run on AMD plataform this mac OS !?
,menteto,2007-01-29T15:25Z,It's gonna be a hard work downloading the animal ... too many leechers and no seed...
,KRosenqvist,2007-01-29T19:57Z,"Hey! I'm new here... Thank's for the torrent - seeing forward to try this build of The Beast..! Is it possible to delete some files from the image, so it can be burned to a Single Layer DVD...???"
,Cachorro,2007-01-29T22:43Z,What a Shit ! With so many bugs who cares to try it? 
,sausagemonster,2007-01-31T16:58Z,Seed you greedy fuckers.
,letsgoin,2007-01-31T18:25Z,Any other torrent places to DL this from???  No seeds??? WTF
,tatayoya,2007-02-01T00:14Z,"Hey ajb01,

What you did is toally uncool. If you don't want to seed then don't upload the torrent.

There is only 1.39 gigs left = 4 hours seeding at 100Ko/s. If some know one who owns the complete dmg, ask him to join the swarm even for one hour.
Thanks.

"
,terinjokes,2007-02-01T10:14Z,"ajb01, shame on you! Don't you understand the basic principles of bittorrent? Bittorrent is a sharing protocol, though I'm beginning to think you don't understand what sharing is, based on your idiotic selfish acts"
,lillegubben,2007-02-01T15:01Z,"keep cool guys.

If i was ajb01, why should i seed to people who insult me.

Wait and see"
,quiproquo,2007-02-01T17:33Z,"Hello, folks! I've installed the previous beta Leopard, but I cannot update it to the actual 9A343 via Software Update. Do you know why?"
,c-r0ck,2007-02-01T18:20Z,This isn't available via software update because the folks at Apple do not want you to have it. They have given copies to the people they want and they're not going to give you a copy of the new one just because you managed to get your hands on an old one.
,c-r0ck,2007-02-01T18:22Z,"Oh yeah, an could someone PLEASE seed! We're all stuck at 74.4% which just isn't enough, call me greedy but I really wanted all 100%."
,ialucard@mac.com,2007-02-01T18:55Z,Seedelnéd ezt a kibaszott torrentet???
,tatayoya,2007-02-01T21:24Z,"I admit we should burn ajb01 and then, if he decides to seed, we could forgive him.
But burn him first !"
,terinjokes,2007-02-01T22:41Z,"I managed to grap 75.5% of the dmg from a seed from demonoid, whould it be possible to merge the two together? Perhaps I would have a full file and could seed..."
,Alcmene,2007-02-02T12:05Z,"Ok guys, I'm going to have that file from a friend who got it on a private tracker. He will send me the full file first, because he has a crappy upload (around 30 kBps), so if we spare that to everyone it'll be extremely long. Then on Monday (GMT), I'll seed from my campus, where I have 1,5 MBps upload. That's if no one comes with a full copy before Monday of course ;)
Sorry not to be able to seed right now? Be patient !"
,tatayoya,2007-02-02T15:26Z,"Thanks Alcmene !
Just one thing: with bittorrent, upload are not spared, they are duplicated. If your friend has a 30K/s upload, each leecher will have 30k/s download because they seed between them. And 1,25Go/30Ko/s = ap. 12 hours."
,letsgoin,2007-02-02T15:31Z,Does anyone use Oink? If so can come someone hook me up with a invite? letsgobackin@yahoo.com.  I am in need of one badly... TIA!!
,Alcmene,2007-02-02T16:05Z,"Oops yeah you're right tatayoya, completely forgotten that ""detail"" ! :(
He's offline now (he lives in Australia, sleeping at the moment ;) ), so I can't tell him to do it... But I'll tell him as soon as he wakes up !
So sorry :-!"
,Alcmene,2007-02-02T16:06Z,"Yeah letsgoin, my friend actually uses that tracker, that's why he got the full dmg ;) But he has no invites :("
,Alcmene,2007-02-02T16:19Z,"Ok boys, be happy and thank Banana ! :)"
,Alcmene,2007-02-02T16:57Z,"BTW, he says that this build is extremely slow, especially compared to the previous ones (9A30?) (but he's on an iBook, at the same time ;) ). I hope it won't be true... :("
,tatayoya,2007-02-02T17:54Z,Alcmene: big thanks to your australian friend because it works ! It's not as smooth as I was supposing but globally it's very useful.
,MacTech84,2007-02-02T19:23Z,So does this mean more seeders?  and yeah if anyone has an oink account could you send me an invite please!!!  Greatly appreciate.
,tatayoya,2007-02-03T17:33Z,A way to be more efficient would be to go to insanelymac.com and ask for people to seed in the Leopard Forum. Many of them already have the 9a343 build.
,Unfrozen Caveman,2007-02-05T04:55Z,"This torrent was doing great, then stopped @ 90 %. Did this happpen to anyone else ? Can anyone verify that they completed it ? Is it a bad torrent ?

,ErBiC,2007-02-05T04:57Z,"I PMed ajb01 on InsanelyMac and have yet to receive a reply. All I know is this: There's one seed, it's most likely ajb01, and he/she/it only seeds for about two minutes at a time. Which is pissing me off.

And everyone's stuck at about 81.7%.

GODDAMN IT SEED!!!"
,ufpa,2007-02-05T10:53Z,"This SO Run In AMD System !?
Dual Core 4200+ ATI Radeon x800gt "
,Alcmene,2007-02-05T14:24Z,"Well, that's what I can say : Banana says he is seeding (at 20 kBps), I sometimes see a seed but not always, I'm stuck at 88% and seeding at 5 MB/s   :-/
No one reached to a complete copy yet ? :("
,martinhartmann,2007-02-05T16:00Z,"I`m at 87.60%, thanks Banana! Right now it downloads at 57.3 KB/s and i`m uploading at 9.1 KB/s. This is so nice :)"
,martinhartmann,2007-02-05T19:22Z,90.02%! Pass the champagne.
,Ampidire,2007-02-05T23:46Z,"92.9% and goin!  AHH can't wait!

Thanks ajb01, I know this isn't your usual turf, thanks for all your submissions on Demonoid and ignore the negative comments."
,martinhartmann,2007-02-06T06:26Z,"96.09% 
I`m so excited and I can´t wait? We need some more pasta!!!"
,Alcmene,2007-02-06T10:36Z,"Ampidire : well, he created the torrent but without me & Banana it would have been dead :/ I don't see much reasons to thank him...
Uploading at 5 MBps right now... Hope everyone enjoys ;)
So, in a few minutes, a lot of people should get a complete copy (99% right now !)... If no one seeds I kill all of you >-(   ;)"
,martinhartmann,2007-02-06T15:18Z,Stuck at 99.92%! This torrent is a torture.
,martinhartmann,2007-02-06T16:34Z,Finished and seeding!
,flipper65,2007-02-06T18:45Z,Seeding now and for the forseeable future. 
,KRosenqvist,2007-02-06T21:15Z,"Hey!
Finished the download..!
Thank's for the torrent - seeing forward to try this build of The Beast..!
Is it possible to delete some files from the image, so it can be burned to a Single Layer DVD...???"
,suffix,2007-02-06T23:46Z,"im still seeding. 
ul speed: 448.2 KB/s
sharing:  21.288

;-) have phun ;-)"
,martinhartmann,2007-02-07T00:58Z,"I`m trying to make a single layer DVD. You can delete Xcode tools but I could not install it. My eMac just shuts down automatically after waiting a lot when booting from the DVD.
If someone finds out how to boot from a single layer DVD in a PPC, please post it!"
,tilc,2007-02-08T20:43Z,Please seed...
,JeanCrack,2007-02-11T18:21Z,Super merci .............. fonctionne très bien :-) !!
,yashrg,2007-02-14T06:00Z,please someone with 100% of the torrent seed!!!
,prattitude,2007-02-14T11:09Z,"I'm trying to burn this image from a WinXP machine.  both MagicISO and dmg2iso say that the file is corrupt...

any ideas??"
,prattitude,2007-02-14T13:25Z,"in response to my last comment, I read somewhere that I could just burn the .dmg file as a flat file from my PC..  then copy it on to the mac hard drive and mount it..   hopefully that works.."
,asapreta,2007-02-16T18:20Z,Anyone got the patch files to run Leopard on a Hackintosh???
,candykane,2007-02-20T00:09Z,"Well just to give you guys a hint its to big for a single layer dvd. just remove the Xcode folder and you can burn it on a nice single layer dvd.
Its original macs only sorry "
,kofmiester,2007-02-26T19:34Z,"Maybe I am just unlucky. I downloaded the torrent. Now it is not burning because of the size. I removed the XCode tools and burned. My PowerBook just restarted and I never got any prompts after that to install the big cat. Is there something that I am doing wrong? Are there any files missing in this torrent? Was anyone else successful with the install and what did you all do? Should I burn the image on a DL DVD?

Specs: 17"" PowerBook G4. 1.67 GHz PPC. 2 GB DDR SDRAM. 5400rpm 160 GB ATA hard drive and and external drive connected via firewire 400- 100 GB 5400rpm."
,KRosenqvist,2007-02-27T18:52Z,Hey kofmiester. Did you remember to hold down the C-key so that your computer is forced to boot from the DVD? Kind regards!
,anirog,2007-03-03T13:22Z,"Thanks for this, does anyone know how to remove the Xcode folder so I can burn it on a single layer dvd. I tried mounting the dmg file selecting the Xcode folder and hitting delete but nothing happened I also tried creating a blank dmg in disk utility then dragging everything except the xcode folder fropm the dmg file downloaded, but I get loads of read only error message."
,anirog,2007-03-04T00:43Z,"I found some instructions on how to burn this onto a single layer DVD, I haven't tried installing it yet though.

1. Get Carbon Copy Cloner. Google is your friend.
2. Get the Leopard DVD.
3. Have CCC make a new image of the leopard dvd, but leave off XCode by unchecking it. Make sure you make the dvd bootable!
4. Burn your new image.
5. Pop it in and install."
,Jimmy1Cool,2007-03-13T11:39Z,I WANT MAC BUT I DONT FUCKING AFFORD IT
,jonamond,2007-03-15T07:14Z,omg i just started the download... how long does it take to DL... im very impatient lol
,jonamond,2007-03-15T07:41Z,and why r the speeds so random? like 1 second its at 2.4kb/s and in a second it jumps to 32kb/s then back down.. i always have my eye on it. the more it goes up the happier i get then it drops and tell my computer to go fuck itself!!!
,monkey285,2007-03-20T23:10Z,"I tried several methods of putting this on a single layer dvd found here and elsewhere. When using a single layer dvd, both my iBook G4 and iMac G5 would choke.

So I went to walmart and bought a few dual layer dvds. It worked fine on my ibook G4 then.

So if you are not willing to buy a dual layer dvd or use an external HD (which I dont know how to do), I wouldn't download this file."
,abidah,2007-03-26T06:19Z,Would it be possible to install this using Paralells?
,zeebester,2007-04-17T19:08Z,Does anyone know if this is an Intel Only Disc image?  I can't seem to get it to boot once I copy it over?!?!
,beaver3125,2007-04-22T21:58Z,EVERYONE IS DOING IT WRONG. I GOT IT TO WORK!- all you need is 2 macs ( i have an eMac 1.42 and a iBook G4 1.33) ooh and a firewire connet cable. ok so you have the computers.. you dont need what i have. all you need is 2 apple computers with firewire. ok you install Netinstall. google it. you connect the computers and do a firewire install. i am installing it on my eMac so i restarted my eMac and the ibook is on. i then went in to disc utility and partitioned my eMac to have 2 partitions. there is a 80 gb hd in it so each one was like 37.14 or some shit like that. ok you then go to netinstall and configure where and what you want to install. then once it is installed. the ibook was restarted (acting like the eMac) then the os x installer came on the ibook screen and  you install. its easy and works. no external needed or dvd discs.. DONT DISCONNECT THE FIREWIRE THO. BECAUSE THE FILES ARE BEING INSTALLED FROM ONE MAC TO ANOTHER. and waa laaa leopard !!! i hope this works for you. its easy and fun fun fun !!
,beaver3125,2007-04-23T07:39Z,"ok update on how to install. as i said b4, do all those steps. and once you have the leopard installed, if you want to delet the 2 partitions, get carbon copy cloner from google and copy the leoard hard drive volume on the computer  that has leopard. then take the dmg copy of the leopard hard drive and copy it to the second computer with the firewire. then go to the computer with the 2 partitions and erase the whole volume.. after the computer is completley erased, then take Netinsall-Restore ( free from google) and take the dmg copy of the leopard hard drive and re install it.. then the computer will have leopard from 1 hard drive. easy.. i tryed to explain it the best i could.. i am useing leopard now. there is no problems at all. thank you soooo much !"
,Punks_4_Live,2007-05-04T09:41Z,"damn shit... if the final realease will be like this...
it's full of bugs... but i trust in apple... hope they will make it better soon.
9A410 is barely the same"
,Punks_4_Live,2007-05-04T09:43Z,"okay.. i downloaded it now... THX...
I'm going to seed for a while... THX guys!!!"
,iDean,2007-06-16T22:08Z,"Is this the build from WWDC 2007? With Stacks, the new Finder etc?"
,bladezguy,2008-05-20T23:59Z,I am afraid to try this especially because it is 5.13 gig lol
,assyrianking4,2009-04-15T06:32Z,people plz seed plz plz plz!!!
