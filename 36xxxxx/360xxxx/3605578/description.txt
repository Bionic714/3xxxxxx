Terminal:
Settings are now stored in Terminal \\\"Profiles\\\" rather than .term files. There are two ways old .term settings are migrated to the new Terminal:
- Automatic import of default .term file and terminal settings at the first launch 
- Importing of arbitrary .term files other than your default one
After migrating settings a new Terminal window will open and you should save the window settings as new profiles using Shell->Save Profile

- Tab support
- Terminal now lets you save a multi-window configurations through workspaces which are available through the \\\"Terminal\\\" menu.

QuickLook
- QuickLook APIs have been updated
- quicklookd can be used to test your QuickLook generators. Use \\\"quicklookd -h\\\" to see the list of options.
