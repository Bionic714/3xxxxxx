,Panodilo,2007-01-30T22:06Z,Fantastic upload! Thanks!
,th3vil,2007-01-31T11:59Z,"Thaks. Great ul! 

Do you have anything else from O Records? 

Like ""All You Ever Think About Is (Sex)"", ""I?m In Love With A Married Man""?

Maybe anything that Bobby Orlando produced. You know, perhaps like The Flirts ""Passion"" and Divine?s ""Native Love"" or  or any of the early Pet Shop Boys?"
,metkar,2007-01-31T13:48Z,"Sorry th3vil. That's about all the Bobby O I could find. Allthough Passion should be there, so I guess I'll find it when I take a closer look. However I have a lot of similar stuff I could upload. No problem in sharing once the vinyl has been ripped.
Which brings me to a request of my own. Would be very interested in ""Glamour Station - Ev'rybody does it."""
,loujk,2007-04-15T04:14Z,"Please seed! Don't make me beg! There's one or two here I don't have.

Does anyone have the most recent Flirts' album with ""Take A Chance On Me"" on it? "
