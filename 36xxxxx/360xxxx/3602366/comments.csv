So say you download one of these office 2007 and it is in a MDF format what do you do? Because Daemon and most other software and not compatible with Vista, what you can do is go to a friends house or if you have another computer, run it through Daemon there and drag the contents in the daemon drive to a CD or a flash pen and that is that."
