,Bulldawg2525,2007-02-01T22:03Z,"i didnt download this yet... but i would only guess that you would have to burn the iso file on to a blank DVD disc. It may not work with a regular cd disc.     Find the iso file, and burn it onto a blank DVD disc"
,lance032,2007-02-01T22:06Z,Nah man there are no iso files in this torrent. 
,illegally,2007-02-02T00:54Z,"I works. I used a blank CD disk. There is a iso file contained in the zip file. Unzip, and you should see the iso file and a product keys file."
,troyboy515,2007-02-02T05:38Z,"I am not getting this. I see no ISO files, just a bunch of winrar files. any help from anyone?"
,nos4ot2,2007-02-02T06:16Z,"i see all the winrar files as well but when you extract the files the iso and bin file are there then .
may main question is and yes I know Ill sound stupid is this if I just burn all 30 win rar files and the rest of the misc files in the folder to  a dvd or cd etc will that work or do they all have to be extracted ?.
been haven the same issues when the movies I dl come out with the folder full of winrars as well so any help would be appreciated ."
,troyboy515,2007-02-02T07:37Z,"yes..I extract the files, i still see no ISO file..any more help from anyone?"
,nos4ot2,2007-02-02T20:07Z,"so tell me if Im wrong there are 30 rar files , tell me if Im right ok extract one of em to a folder and then with win iso or something similar extract the iso from the bin and burn it to a cd or dvd etc and then install it?
or do I need to do that to each of the 30 rar files?
and what is up with all the spam now adays on here it has gotten bad hasnt it"
,searon,2007-02-03T06:24Z,"how hard can it be .. the ISO file is rar'ed and split .. open the 1st rar .. drag/drop the iso file in it to where u want to put it .. winrar will do the rest .. simple . 

then either burn the iso  to a CD as ISO is a imagefile... or use Daemon tool to open it as a virtiual CD.. its all very simple  even my 6 y.o daughter can do it "
,had4me,2007-02-03T09:06Z,"Hey, Since this torrent worked for many of you.
I just need 1 file to make my version work.

Dick Drive:
Excel.en-us\ExcelLR.cab

I would really appreciate it if anyone can upload this file onto a file sharing site like rapidshare etc.

The File is located on the CD, so when u mount it go in2 My Computer then right click on the Disc drive with the Office Image or Cd and then click ""Explore"". The File is located in: Excel.en-us\ExcelLR.cab

Thanxxxx"
,Ponkes,2007-02-03T14:46Z,"Thanks!

Another way to get it working is to extract the first win rar file and open the bin file with AlZip. Then save it as a zip and unzip it again. You can then install it perfectly - at least it worked for me."
,Spoil3r,2007-02-03T16:41Z,"firstly: make sure u set your folder options so you can see file extensions of known types

make sure u have winrar (rarlab.com i believe)

then: double click the file ending .rar

extract to whereever (its irrelevant but know the location)

this should extract 2 files ... one ending .bin and the other .cue

the .cue is the file that tells the burning software what to burn ... in this case 1 file, the .bin file.

im not sure whether u can use a program like daemon tools on this file but i decided to burn to have a hard copy.

i recommend getting Alcohol 120%:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/hashtorrent/3595459.torrent/Alcohol.120.1.9.6.4719.inc.keygen.patch-BetaMaster.3595459.TPB.torrent

open alcohol up, burn image file: select the .cue file and watch that baby burn!

cant really make it any clearer than that.

(u mite want to go back to folder options and turn off the known extensions showing)

Någon som har några förslag?"
