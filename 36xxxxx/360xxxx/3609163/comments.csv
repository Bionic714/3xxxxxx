,sljuba,2007-02-02T13:57Z,Ok. But where is download for Vista Ultimate..... 
,dudew8,2007-02-02T13:58Z,"LOL check filesize the original activation was on 1gig
dont dl this!!!!!"
,spok70,2007-02-02T14:30Z,"Hi, Thanks for sharing this crack it works perfectly!

I have used this method that is more easy:

1. Install Vista Ultimate

2. Setup fully complete

3. Open Command Prompt as Administrator 

4. Type: ""Date"" and then change the date to December 31, 2099 

   My Date showed as 02/02/2007, I changed  to 12/31/2099 

5. Hit enter

6. Type slmgr.vbs -rearm 

7. Wait, then it will say to reboot (Don't) 

8. Type Date again, and change your date back to the original, in my  case 02/02/2007. 

9. Close Command Prompt 

10. Run the VistaCrack.exe as administrator 

11. Click Crack 

12. Your system will reboot, and the crack should run on start-up. 

13. Once it has finished, open command prompt and type: slmgr -dlv 

14. If it works, you should have a pop-up saying ""Time Left: 43200 minutes (30 Days)

,clony_patcher,2007-02-03T12:23Z,"If you don't want to reinstall you version of Windows Vista you can try
to use this method before to apply the patch and to test it.

1_step:

1. Open registry editor.

2. Navigate to the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SL

3. Edit the registry subkey of ?SkipRearm? (you should see current value as dword:00000000)
   and set the ?SkipRearm? value to any positive integer (such as 1).

4. Open command prompt with administrative rights.

5. Type ?slmgr -rearm? or ?Rundll32 slc.dll,SLReArmWindows?.

6. Restart computer. You should now has a fresh 30-day of trial period on Windows Vista, which
   by end of 30-days time bomb, you can repeat the procedures again to skip Vista activation.

Now you can follow the 2 and 3 step that you find in my zip file."

but at least it still says 30 days left!
 I seem to have had a few problems after instal ing this crack eg: programmes not starting up properly at start up !

,Kurpitsa,2007-02-14T12:44Z,"Is there anyway to set back the clock AFTER you've installed Vista? Just wondering, since i didn't have any problems until today when suddenly a small icon popped up at my taskbar saying i had only 25 days left (which doesn't make sense since i installed it at least 8-9 days ago), and i'm really starting to panic! I'm actually so sacred that i don't dare to turn of my computer :P 

Thanks in advance"

,clony_patcher,2007-03-04T21:28Z,"Good news for us!
For x86 windows vista (32 bit) there is a new my crack that really activate your Vista.

NO Timerstopper
NO modify your Vista bootloader!

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3631799/Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator.4st.March-CLoNY

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY' 
you can install the new one with no problem without fresh installation.

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.1-CLoNY' or
'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.2' you can use Vista Manager Pro
to rebuilt the bootloader and than you can apply the new one.

Download the software:
http://www.vistabootpro.org

Guide:
In Vista Manager Pro select 'BootLoader', select 'Reinstall the original bootloader'
and then click 'Apply'.

For x64 Windows Vista (64bit) I suggest, for now, to continue to use
'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY'

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3618299/Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY
