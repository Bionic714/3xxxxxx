Info about your torrent...

Got it??!!"
,stigers,2007-01-22T22:00Z,sorry not sal but kollll
,fogus,2007-01-23T21:28Z,"No, its very important and nice to include as much info about your torrent as possible.  It is good that NTSC is in the title, but there are several reasons that a person would not download a large file.  These include (in order of priority):

NTSC or PAL (anyone know where to find an excelent converter?!  if we had one, all the movies on TPB could be released in BOTH)
Audio language(s).
Subtitle(s) and are they hard or not? (ie, can you turn them off?)
Video source (ie. quality.  say ""shrunk from DVD"" or ""recorded in a theater"" etc.)
Aspect ratio (ie 4X3 or 16X9 etc.)
Audio channels (ie. 5.1 AC3 etc.)

It is not important to write what the movie is about anymore, as this can be easily found on IMDB.  A link to the page is a courtesy, but the above information is a must."
,karilin2,2007-01-26T09:37Z,"Google my ass, how can you find info about the torrent with google. And fogus since you asked canopus procoder it's an excelent converter but why bother. Buy a dvd player that plays both formats, there are plenty around. To make sure you buy the right one take with you to the store two dvd's one in PAL and one in NTSC and asked them to try it out. Yamaha has a nice one but other manufacturers are out there as well."
