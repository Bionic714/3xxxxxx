Synopsis

Overwhelmed by tons of workload requested by his fervent fans all over the country,
the popular superstar Film Rattapoom Tohkongsab has desperately yearned for a quiet
respite in Northern Thailand. While on his trip, he gets a car accident, and consequently
lost his memory.

Fortunately, Film is saved by Lorsu (Ead Ponglang Saorn ? Sompong Kunaprathom),
the most handsome member of a hill tribe village. Lorsu is the dream man of A-Lah
(Lala ? Ouh Kwannapa Ruengsri) and A-Luh (Lulu- Duang Duangruedee Boonbumroong),
the two frenzied girls who are both head over heels in love with Lorsu and always
compete with each other to be the one to win his heart.

Lorsu the handsome (indeed!) has saved Film without knowing that he is
the country?s most famous celebrity. He renames Film as A-Long after his pig?s name.
Lorsu at first is not willing to take care of A-Long, but, as time passes, A-Long?s
ingenuous and na?ve personality somehow has made him become part of Lorsu?s family.
Although he was literally in the middle of nowhere, Film still runs into Jah (Paula Taylor),
a broke paparazzo who tries very hard to get the best shot of the superstar to make
her ends meet. To get as many pictures as possible for her never before seen
Film?s collection, Jah tries whatever she possibly can to get close to Film.

Embraced by the magnificent frosty mountains where everyone lives their tranquil life
with the beautiful nature, the superstar and the paparazzo, who are originally at odds,
start to learn the inner self of each other and soon a warm-hearted relationship grows
between them.

Once Film regains his memory and resumes his real life of a famous superstar, he can?t
recall anything he has been through. What remains is only a vague picture of a woman
who he faintly remembers the tenderness of her hand.

Despite being clueless about who and where she is, Film, from his faint memory, feels
that that girl is still waiting for him somewhere so far away-- the place full of fog and
cold breeze. And it is only her who can release him from this loneliness?

Will Film be able to find that girl in his memory?
Is she still waiting for him?... as the touch of the wintry breeze slowly blowing away.
Let?s find out the answers in the romantic-comedy film of the year
?Ruk Jung (The Memory)?

The movie that will make your heart feel and see?true love.      

The Director's words: Phu- Hemant Chatemee
Before it becomes ?Ruk Jung-The Memory?

While the filming of ?Ruk Jung (The Memory)? has been quite rough and hectic,
I can frankly say that two strongest parts of this movie project are the cast and
the filming location.

The plot of this film originally came from Ms. Joe (Pathira Palwatwichai ?
The producer of ?Sex Phone?) who initiated the idea of making a romantic-comedy
flick between a superstar and a paparazzo. That idea was then developed into
a movie script by Nahunsa ( The script writer of ? Sex Phone ? )

Since the main character of this movie is a superstar, we have to look for a celebrity
who is both an actor and singer and it turns out that no one else except
?Film-Rattapoom? fits into this criteria. Moreover, I personally know both
Film and Paula that they"
