,spunkster,2010-12-26T23:09Z,You guys should be aware that the keygen doesn't work. Maybe that's why it stopped seeding. Palo Alto Software who makes this is onto you. They scour these sites and cancel any keygens out there. There's a page on their site specifically addressing torrents: http://www.paloalto.com/business_plan_software/business_plan_pro_torrent.cfm
