,rstran,2007-01-25T14:38Z,vistacrack and timery.sys files 
,sup191,2007-01-26T23:26Z,I don't know why it's an ISO instead of a rar...  BUT!  Just open it with WinRAR and extract the three files.  I haven't tried it yet but I was told it works.  I WILL say however that I scanned the contents with the newest Kaspersky AND NOD32 and there is no virus or trojan in this file.  I have no idea what Shady_tim1992 is talking about.
