This torrent contains two CDs, both on the Hyperion label. They are volumes 2 & 8 from the "Romantic Piano Concerto" series and contain all 3 of Russian composer Nikolai Medtner's piano concerti. His piano quintet is here as well, which was published posthumously. If you like Rachmaninov's music give Medtner a try. Both composers were late Romantics and their music is similar in many respects. Medtner's music is in my opinion highly underrated and sadly not well known nowadays :( Both CDs are ripped in MP3 format @ 192kbos bit rate. Cover art included. Hope you enjoy!
