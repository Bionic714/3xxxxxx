show notes
*This was the second time Metallica has performed in Estonia. This first time was on June 29, 1999.

*Metallica is now the biggest selling act in Estonia history!

*So What was performed with a gallery of background vocalists including Pedigree, Tanel Padar and The Sun, and Bullet For My Valentine.

*This was the second time For Whom the Bell Tolls has been performed on the European Escape from the Studio '06 tour.

*This was the seventh time Orion has been performed in its entirety. As James Hetfield says, ?God Bless Cliff Burton.?

*Did you know that, at this point, Metallica has performed Creeping Death well over a THOUSAND times?"
