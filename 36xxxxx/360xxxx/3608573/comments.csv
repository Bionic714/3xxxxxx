,Jokkocze,2007-02-01T19:03Z,Why would anyone want to download something that you cant avoid getting when getting the needed key? >_>
,Eirath,2007-02-01T19:05Z,"For people who wanna share friends codes trials that come with the game with online friends, and don't want to take the next fligth to another town or country to let them borrow your CDs.

Just one example."
,Jokkocze,2007-02-01T20:32Z,"Well, then you can get the launcher from SoE and download it that way ;)"
,Eirath,2007-02-01T20:45Z,"To my knowing, not without paying"
,Eirath,2007-02-01T20:52Z,"And anyway, there are more reasons. Ponder you have several computers but limited bandwidth use, and you purchased the game online. Then you don't want to download the same game from SoE Station for each single install. Much better to download once and store or burn the DVDs for use."
,archevel,2007-02-01T21:02Z,Thought Vanguard SOH was still in closed-beta... Is it no so?
,Eirath,2007-02-01T21:09Z,"Nope, was released a few days ago."
,Marxist,2007-02-01T22:04Z,i ve heard it has about 10gigs after instalation if it true?
[T],kenoneu,2007-02-01T22:50Z,"After all the patching, your folder is 17gb altogether."

,slap42,2007-02-02T17:26Z,someone can give the cd key number please?
,Eirath,2007-02-02T21:16Z,It's an mmo kiddo.. Want to play it? You'll have no other choice but to buy it.
,gnurf,2007-02-08T07:49Z,The game was just released. How the hell would there be private servers already? :P
,Mortenaw,2007-02-12T05:42Z,Plus making free servers of a mmo is just plain ol' wrong
[V],Loske,2007-02-12T20:43Z,"Try this game out before you pay for it cus i regret as hell that i bought it, it really sucks."
,Laej,2007-02-20T09:07Z,"""Mortenaw-Plus making free servers of a mmo is just plain ol' wrong""No it aint. What the fuck are yu on piratebay for? STFU"
,Pixen17,2007-03-14T14:45Z,Is it a monthly fee for this game?
,Silver_Zephyr,2007-04-30T16:43Z,Is it possible to only buy an account somewhere?
,monkey69chicken,2007-12-17T05:10Z,This torrent is actually really useful. The Vanguard patcher is HORRIBLE!! I mean really really BAAD! I started it up on my 5th day of downloading with a game folder size of 16GB. 3h 20mins to go. I go to sleep for 7 hours. Get up. 4h 20mins to go. stop it. restart it 2h 40mins to go. An hour later it's back up to 5h 10mins. The patcher just can't maintain a reasonable rate of transfer. If you are going to buy the digital download version get the key then torrent the disks. It's MUCH faster.
,Lord_Nisse,2008-06-10T13:59Z,Just play wow private server
