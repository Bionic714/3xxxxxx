,nix090,2007-02-11T04:29Z,"Yes i got had by this too, but ive found out what it IS and how to get rid of it.

Its called Bifrost and its a smart little program. Goto http://www.megasecurity.org/trojans/b/bifrost/Bifrost1.2.html for more info, it has keyloggers (change your passwords NOW!), screen shots, remote access, even through your firewalls!

You need to start with either a boot CD that supports NTFS and delete the folder: c:\Program Files\Bifrost\ it is hidden so use `attrib` to unhide it, or use `deltree c:\Program Files\Bifrost` ... or try booting into safe mode and deleting it (i havnt tried this way).

It start up on start up by running that server.exe and it hides in registery: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{9B71D88C-C598-4935-C5D1-43AA4DB90836}

delete this key, also search the registry for 'bifrost' and delete ALL folders that has any data inside.

Reboot and you should be trojan FREE! :)

In the future, NEVER trust a key generator thats more than 50-100Kbytes in size!!

Hope this helps, and nice work Paradox, you almost got me! ;)"
