,oldrottenhat,2007-01-31T00:31Z,Just me or is there a problem getting the audio to sync properly ? Hmmm... 
,ibmc,2007-02-04T16:26Z,"Any feedback on the comment from oldrottenhat? Has anybody else experienced audio problems?
Been looking for this for ages but reluctant to download such a large file if there are audio issues.
Any feedback would be much appreciated."
,oldrottenhat,2007-02-05T03:29Z,"Just to clarify - eps 3-6 have problems with sound synch but the rest are good. Thanks for putting this up - I really enjoyed it !

,ibmc,2007-02-07T15:40Z,"Thanks for the clarification, oldrottenhat!
Does anybody know of a way to fix the audio problems in the episodes concerned?"
,jaraeez,2007-02-15T15:30Z,Cheers... all work fine -- 1 episode is poor in quality but watchable -- @ibmc try using vlc & then adjust the audio speed -- use Linux myself & did the same with mplayer -- cheers again
,jojo02,2008-04-06T19:23Z,does anyone have the +10??? Would love to see that.
,davidouu,2010-01-14T21:33Z,"If there is anyone at all still downloading this.......read on.

I recently downloaded this file and sure enough episodes 4,5 and 6 are corrupted or have major audio sync problems.

I have corrected them for my own use by re encoding and pitch shifting the source A/V.

If anyone wants them leave a message here and I will upload them and leave a link here....

Regards

,davidouu,2011-03-17T23:41Z,I am just about to upload the three episodes that I have fixed regarding the piss poor audio....click on my name and you will find the links for them....I will not keep them here for much time I am hoping that others will take and seed them ...
