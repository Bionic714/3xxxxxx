,I_QBot,2007-01-22T17:16Z,Still a damn good tutorial.
,angel_jajja,2007-01-22T18:06Z,"works fine, good job!!!"
,damonp,2007-01-22T20:48Z,"The RIAA guys should learn how to make less obvious descriptions. The way this has been written alone told me it was a sham, and downloading it confirmed it to me."

Damn, you guys are suspicious. What makes you think these are trojans or viruses? In fact, the BIGGEST part of the torrent is an HTML manual with snapshots of the programs. That is the part of the torrent that took the most effort. There is a group of software attached to this torrent, but all of it came from the surrounding TPB or Mininova community. This is just a guide, with all the software necessary 

If you look at the files, you can see some of the programs included. There is PeerGuardian2, the freeware program that blocks the RIAA and MPAA from connecting to your computer. PgcEdit is also freeware, and probably available on sourceforge. VLC Media Player, Combined Community Codec Pack, ImgBurn, and SubtitleWorkshop? Alllllllll freeware, baby. Simply put, if you don't want to use the programs this guide uses, you don't have to. You can get it elsewhere, or use different programs that do the same thing. The software here is just there for your convenience.

Damonp: Really, what's the deal? You think the RIAA (anti-music piracy) is going to publish a manual on how to rip off DVDs? What? Are they trying to cause problems for the other sectors of the intellectual property industry? What does that even mean? ""The RIAA put it together."" Does it work? Yes or no. Are there viruses? Yes or no. What made you think it was a ""sham""? It's an extremely direct approach to the topic, I know that, but so was Harass the Brass.

Only one person was responsible for the entire production of ""Video Piracy: How to Burn Any Video File to DVD (Manual With Cracked Software)"". There was no outside influence.... except maybe from Emma. ;)

Thanks to all who are downloading, seeding, and supporting. It's clear that a good amount of people are benefitting from this.  Thanks!"
,lachie74,2007-01-25T15:25Z,Torrent doesn't work with Bitlord anyway.
,framitz,2007-01-25T18:58Z,Just looking at the contents should tell you that this is a pile of crap.  No need for this garbage weather or not it's infected I don't care.  
,steinos,2007-03-23T23:42Z,"BloodLogic:
Way to go!
I use most of these programs on a daily bases. Depending on what I need for my project.
And folks.... There are NO viruses in this torrent.
Framitz: Hmmm. I wonder what you are talking about. Of course you need this programs from time to time! Not everything you download is in the right format for DVD, or in the shape that you want it. And if you want quality on your work, you need this programs:-)"
,dmsuperman,2007-05-08T05:29Z,"A very nice compilation. I have one question, which one would you suggest I use to burn multiple AVIs to a single DVD (multiple episodes of a show) with a menu?"
,adhdyoshi,2007-12-29T02:30Z,Nice work!
,johncoleman2004,2008-12-08T05:25Z,Thank you!
,sagabmx,2008-12-11T22:22Z,No need for this garbage --> weather 
,crow4930,2008-12-15T03:28Z,"why not it just be a txt or rtf...

it seems to me that all your torrents have trojans

you should probably just quit, 'cause if a program as simple as AVG free detects like 40 proven trojans in just one of your torrents, you have failed in claiming your torrents are virus-free.

Whether you're just sharing other people's torrents that are infected or you've developed these yourself and plan on hacking into men's computers and watching them masturbate through their webcams, is a mystery to me, but one thing's for certain: if your shit's infected, you should either delete it, repair it, or GTFO piratebay!"
,corklad,2008-12-31T11:24Z,thanks very much for this. must have taken a lot of effort. thanks
,Chrybdis,2010-07-03T04:31Z,"Come on People!

Seems like the ones who are doin' all the bitchin' about viruses & trojans are the ones who need to be reading training manuals like this! They obviously don't know the difference between a real virus and the false positive that pops up so often when you use software cracks!

""A Sham""???
What are you, nuts? Why don't you look at all the other fine torrents this user has been nice enuf to give to the community! Are all those some sort of an elaborate cover for information anyone can find on the net if they spend the time looking??? [maybe you are the RIAA agent- trying to discredit things like this! hehehe]

The thing here is the presentation... all the info in one tutorial for hose who need it. If you already know it then why knock it for those who don't?

Quit leaving nasty comments about things you obviously know so little about!"
,TaiTheGuy,2010-12-08T07:29Z,"WOW!!!! Applause with STANDING ovation 4 this 1.

I've spent the last week working with this torrent and it's one of the greatest I've EVER downloaded.

This is basically digital media 101 and would qualify as 3 credits at The university of Piracy if there were 1.
It's crazy how many negative comments there are- people REEAALLY don't want us figuring this shit out. SO suppresive.

This torrent is what pirating is all about
