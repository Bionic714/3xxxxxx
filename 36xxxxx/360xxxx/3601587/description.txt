THERE IS NO VIRUS IN THE FILE

My name is Rashid. I am a 4th year medical student from Malaysia. I have no previous experience 
in film making, script writing, screenplay writing, directing, editing or producing a film.
This is my first attempt, and i think it's pretty good for a beginner. If you are a Tarantino
fan, you will find alot of familiar scenes.
This is a definite tribute movie for Metallica.

Lars, please dont sue me.
