,General Septem,2007-02-25T01:16Z,"Is there a reason this and your other ""Monk"" uploads are downloading in ÂľTorrent even though torrents of higher priority are still queued? Also, is this Monk the TV show? A better description would be helpful."
,DocNorton,2007-02-25T12:39Z,"General Septum - I take it your not a weekly downloader of Monk?

You request a ""better description"" of the torrent?

If you were a weekely downloader of the Monk Torrents you would know by the naming convention that this is indeed Monk the detective series starring Tony Shaloub."
