ABOUT FLIGHTGEAR (Open Source, OpenGL, Recomended: 1Ghz CPU 1 Gig Ram, Nvidia AGP)

Flight-Gear is used by pilots and trainees to practice and learning how to fly it also has a multi-play mode function and synchronises data over the Internet with other users of FlightGear so that they can see each other not only in the flight sim but also via a web page which tracks all pilots in real time.

Reason for ISO image format:
In the interests of saving bandwidth, and also prevent some apparent data file corruption that may occur on some FAT drives due to the very large number of small files, I have made this torrent compilation from data that is already available in individual file format, as 4 single DVD image file?s for more convenience, and reliability. Some have noted an issue with GZ files stored on a windows file system hard drive, as having strange effects? Not least defragmentation being severely handicapped. The ISO image format solves these adverse effects that may otherwise occur.

How to use: either burn them to disk for mounting through your DVD drive or by use of ISO mounting software such as Nero Image Drive. Point your Flight Gear scenery application path to the mounted DVD and run from there.

The application file itself is quite small, the bulk of the size is taken up by the whole world scenery or terrain being a more appropriate term, well the world might have been created in 6 days by god, but it takes a very long time to build the whole world including buildings and Bridges etc, so dont expect to much as the scenery is constantly being improved, http://fgfsdb.stockill.org/
