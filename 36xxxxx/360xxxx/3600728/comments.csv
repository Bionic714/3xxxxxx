Bah, yeah right. This is a homebrew freeware game, it doesn't even simulate, it sucks.
Don't be fooled by the size, the game is only like 130MB, this is with scenery addons, and it's the worst you can find. If you wanna play a good flight sim, there is only way to go, Flight Simulator X."

Mind you they don't eat meat, they make their shoes and clothes from compost and cow dung and they smell like compost and cow dung  too.
They run their Atari computer on a bank of batteries made from compost and Urine.
God bless Microsoft!."

FSX and 2004 are far from being the most authentic flight sims cuz their physics engines suck alot. Real good flight dynamics and multiplayer features are offered only by X-Plane and FlightGear, but for simming different procedures fs2004 is prefered ATM cuz of addons, but to suggest fsx ATM is a stupid idea cuz there are virtually no good addons for that except maybe fs2crew 4 def747 and activesky..

Flightgear is some really good stuff. :)

The Scenery has been greatly improved, and designed to work with 0.9.10 the latest version of FG is more stable than earlier releases, also earlier releases of FlightGear did not support the Multiplay Function, and due to some major changes it might not be wise to use older version of FG with the current Aircraft and Scenery, FG is still going through some major software changes, so the next release may well be very different from earlier releases. Basically their is no legitimate reason to use an older version of FG as it was less reliable than the current release 0.9.10 you can get it from here: http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/ also here is a link to the whole world scenery http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/scenery-0.9.10.html in individual tile format of coarse downloading individual tiles does pose some problems with Hard Drive fragmentation as their are millions of tiny files, which is why I made the mountable Scenery DVD's "
