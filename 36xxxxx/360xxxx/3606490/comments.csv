After starting the game the program eventually will ask for Deuteros data disc, now click on your middle mousewheel to release the mouse pointer ( U need a mousewheel of this to work ), look in ure right corner of windows, right click with mouse on the WinUAE symbol and choose floppy drives and click on DF0 drive and insert Deuteros2.adf
Now switch back to the deuteros window and left click on it to lock the mousepointer to the deuteros program, then hit any keyboard key.

Thats all, let me know if U need more help getting started.
