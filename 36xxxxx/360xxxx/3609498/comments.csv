Can someone give me a tip about some program that can create burnable movie-images? 
I tried with Magic-ISO but I didn`t manage to get a movie-image that could be burned and played on a TV DVD-player. Got this message ""unable to play this disk"".

Have these 5 movies I`m gonna ripp and upload:

Fantastic4
28 Days Later
Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)
X-Men I and II"

you must unrar and burn the files as DVD-MOVIE COMPILATION. It`s easy to figure out and do with a burning program.
