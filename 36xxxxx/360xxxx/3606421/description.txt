In Framing Roofs, Larry Haun and his brother Joe build the roof of a basic 1,600-sq. ft. house. Starting from the top of the walls, they take you step by step through the entire process, showing you practical ways to organize tasks, streamline procedures and handle tools and materials efficiently.

Here\'s your chance to watch a framing master at work, and to become a better, more efficient carpenter yourself.

Each section of the video covers a specific topic in detail. You\'ll see firsthand how to:


* frame a gable roof
* use a simple system for framing intersecting roofs
* sheathe roofs

The companion book to this video is The Very Efficient Carpenter.

Larry Haun has been a production framer for almost 40 years and a teacher of apprentices for almost 25. He has honed his skills and techniques on hundreds of tract and custom houses, finding countless ways to save time, reduce costs, minimize problems and improve quality.
