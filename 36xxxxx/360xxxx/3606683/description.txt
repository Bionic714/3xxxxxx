AC3 @ 448kbps

Reason(s)
A. In their haste to pre this -SAiNTS forgot 
the proper resolution of a 720p release is 
1280x720 and encoded theirs at 960x544.

 [See doh.nfo for full mkvinfo analyzation]
B. Cropped. No reason to crop this at all.
C. Resized. Strictly FORBIDDEN when the source
is 720p, but most already knew that from our
Earl NFO. [Kinda relates to A since theres no
reason to downsize a 720 sourced 720 encode]
D. Randomly seeking found 8+ glitches. 2 in 
the prev on alone.
E. As always -CTU spammed an INTERNAL without
checking the original release to see if it 
should be a PROPER.

Enjoy :)
