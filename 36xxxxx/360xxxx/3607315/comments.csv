,dwatch,2007-02-16T16:10Z,"He's not an idiot, just lazy. RAR files are pretty common, but are not needed for torrents. The uploader should have unpacked this before uploading, but you can use WinRAR to unpack the individual archives into one big video file yourself. Stop being a noob and proclaiming 'he's an idiot' if you don't know what the fuck you are talking about yourself. You only look stupid to everyone else."
,radiodood,2007-02-18T00:04Z,I use Nero 7 to burn. It converts most video files.
,c-man27,2007-02-19T21:40Z,"foy, download avs video converter and convert the .avi file to dvd files.  once that is done, burn all the files in the video_ts folder that is created (there should be about 7 or 8 files, including .vob, .bup, and .ifo). the resulting disc should work in almost any dvd player"
