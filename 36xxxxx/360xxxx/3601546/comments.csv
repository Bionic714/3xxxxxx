Don't know if it's available in NTSC as it's a British TV movie. Maybe you can convert it to NTSC.

,Nash-LR,2008-07-18T01:37Z,"I saw this on tv when I was in my early 20's, and still have very vivid images in my head (I can still see the bombs falling. I still see the girl giving birth, terrified that her child will be malformed, and I remember what she did next. And so many more images. Horrible images. Because of the cold war having ended, people may make the mistake of thinking that this is outdated stuff. They'd be wrong. A very disturbing and still very important film. Thank you for this upload."
,cucuruchu,2008-08-22T03:07Z,"can u seed? we've been stuck in 99.6 for 2 days!

,Osaka,2008-08-23T16:43Z,"Yep, lol... there was a seeder or two, with 100% of the .iso, but he left as soon as everyone got above 99%.

Perhaps he's getting some sick kick out of it... leaving it like that... i don't know -_-

Six people now on 99,6% and two others with less."

,realityengine_V20,2009-04-24T22:57Z,"thanks a lot for this movie, i (sadly) watched when i was a kid, scared the sh*t out me, slept afraid for long, not being featured by vampires or zombies, personally , its the most impacting horror movie iÂ´ve seen on my life, and that was the Reagan and URSS paranoia of the 80s, always wondered why so few has right to smash this planet.
Thanks , IÂ´ll seed"
