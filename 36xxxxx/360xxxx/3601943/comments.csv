,Panipal2005,2007-01-23T19:00Z,"Thanks FQM you piece of shit for making a torrented RAR file that can't fucking be extracted by any fucking program under the sun.  Folks stay away from this and any other cunt who won't upload convenient avi files because they would rather piss you about with corrupt, unreadable, or empty RAR files.  "

Maybe you should learn how to use a computer cause this release is perfectly fine.  No problems extracting or watching this show."
,venice.music,2007-01-23T23:16Z,"Stop uploading this kind of crap you retarded bastards!! 

It´s a zip-file within a zip-file that requires you to cklick on a link thats bogus and to retain a freakin password that does not exist."
,ebeats,2007-01-23T23:53Z,"@ venice.music:

That's the other one that is upp'ed dude.  This is the official scene release that is not nuked... the other one that is 800mb+ is the bad one.. FQM is a good release I watched it myself
