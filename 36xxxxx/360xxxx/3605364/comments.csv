,micros43,2007-01-28T16:12Z,I'm tested it now.. It's a virus that takes all your CPU.. So don't run it...

,Triel,2007-02-02T06:01Z,"axepted, I have asked myself the same question over and over. The Torrent software should tell you that ""XXX Many people have said this shit sucks"", but they do not. I have found Free Downloader to tell you that others have found virus, crappy software, useless software, and so on. Only problem is it really sucks at downloading via torrent."
