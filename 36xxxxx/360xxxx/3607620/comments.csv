,shrivelednoodle,2007-02-03T19:36Z,"Video IS a very poor recode.  Massive graining.  Extras ARE missing.
The quality is horrid.  It's also 4:3.  
There's a 16:9 version of this floating around which is far superior.  Don't bother with this one, folks.  The nfo is incorrect for this one.  I'm not happy to announce all this."
