,ReduxDengaku,2007-02-08T00:27Z,"It appears that the file marked DN 2 is actually episode 3, and the file marked DN 3 is ALSO episode 3.  The second episode (which has a major impact on the setup of the plot) is entirely missing."
,bubach,2007-02-11T03:17Z,"I uploaded episode 2 with english subs here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3615572/Death_Note_episode_2_-_Eng_sub

since, as ReduxDengaku said, it's missing in this package."
