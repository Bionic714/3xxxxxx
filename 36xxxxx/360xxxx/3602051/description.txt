I told you, I'm lazy.

Anyway, here is episode 1-14. 1-12 is subbed by the Toriyama's World group, but they stopped subbing when the anime became licensed. Ep 13 & 14 are subbed by other people, so the translation style changes a bit.

To date, these are the only episodes that have been released. More will be added in time.

As always, write me if you want me to seed something older I've upped. This time it was actually a polite mail that persuaded me to make the effort. defrostedtunateam@gmail.com 

Seed when you are finished, or I'll write you down in my Death Note.
