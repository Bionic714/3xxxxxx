,guitargod1992,2008-08-31T19:27Z,"I need some people to seed this for a while.  My computer has been on a couple days and my BitTorrent program has been open that long too.  The torrent for this has been on the download list for almost 48 hours and it's at 0%.  Can some people please seed this for a while, so I can download this.  Then I will seed it after the download is finished.  Thanks"
