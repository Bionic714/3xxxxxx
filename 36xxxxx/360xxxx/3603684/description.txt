Outlandish, ?Closer than Veins?



European hip-hop group Outlandish is finally releasing their new album, Closer than Veins on October 31st in Europe. I dont know if or when it will be released here in the States. For those of you who are unaware of Outlandish, they consist of three young Europeans who descend from Morocco (Isam), Pakistan (Waqas), and Lenny (Honduras). All three are religious, and Isam and Waqas are devout Muslims, and they often include themes about Islam including common issues facing young Muslims in the west in their music. Their hip-hop music features influences from their various backgrounds (Arab, Indian/Pakistani, and Hispanic music), and although primarily in english, feature lyrics in spanish, urdu, and arabic. Their last album, Bread and Barrels of Water was amazing and quite successful. Notable singles from that album include Aicha (video), and Walou. You can purchase Bread and Barrels of water at Amazon.com, or other retailers. Given the quality of their last album, Closer than Veins has been long awaited, and I certainly look forward to it. Interestingly enough, it features a track with Sami Yusuf. Outlandish recently contributed to a track on Sami's new album, My Ummah, as well. Its cool to western Muslim artists collaborate with each other like this. Inshallah once I buy this CD ill comment on it further. Ive also listed the tracklisting at the end of the post. With titles such as Sakeena, I Only Ask of God, and Appreciatin?, I expect alot of the songs to hit home to western Muslims like me.

Meanwhile, the first single released from the album, Look into My Eyes has already climbed to #2 on billboard charts in Europe (Germany and Denmark). Although some may construe it as Anti-American it is not. Its a sad song based on a poem about the plight of those suffering due to America's foreign policy with regards to Israel and Palestine.
