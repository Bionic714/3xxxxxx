,strokeny,2007-02-07T18:39Z,"Im with Killawife except I have no Jappie to sukisuki!
But seriously, this is an excellent film, I saw it and was misty eyed throughout the whole film; its a shame more people didnt see the 2 Eastwood's films but this man is an American living legend.
It is incredible how he has taken the Japanese point of view and has given us an extremely balanced without being preachy film.
Please someone get the subtitles! "
,grahamferguson,2007-02-08T19:06Z,"My god, you can get this in Romanian and Chinese but not English! Please will someone translate as this film looks fantastic..."

,Rapishorrid,2007-02-23T01:48Z,"http://www.divxsubtitles.net/page_subtitleinformation.php?ID=81305

^^^ English subtitles.

I am downloading the movie now so I haven't tested them out, but reading the .srt they are indeed english."
,Rapishorrid,2007-02-23T01:55Z,"actually those may be for the wrong movie. Although it says letters for iwo jima and all the files say it is.. I have a feeling its for sands of iwo or something. the first like is ""this is the story about a squad of marines"""
,donny66,2007-02-23T12:47Z,"Guys, I have great news. I have checked the site of our pirate friends, isoHunt, and they have this movie with Spanish translation. ( http://isohunt.com/torrents/iwo?ihp=1&iht=-1&ihs1=2&iho1=d , check File: Cartas.Desde.Iwo.Jima.(Letters.From.Iwo.Jima).[V.O.Sub.Spanish].[TeleSync].[EstrenosDivX.CoM].avi

700.67 MB in 1 file. Torrent created 21.1 hours ago. )

My Spanish is very bad, but i have sure here are a lot of Spanish speaking people.
It would be great if one of you can make a translation.
It's a big shame the Japanese scene hasn't made a sub.
Pirates Worldwide, Unite!"
,Rapishorrid,2007-02-23T13:55Z,"Has anyone looked at the movie besides me?

The sound is total SHIT and the picture quality looks as if it was from the war itself! 

Don't even waste your time here, unless I downloaded the wrong one, this is the worst rip I have ever seen."
,Bluedk,2007-10-10T02:32Z,"Yes its shit bad quality.. you can see it though, but just so ya' guys know."
