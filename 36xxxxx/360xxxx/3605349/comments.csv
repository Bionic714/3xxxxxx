RipIt4Me2 I forgot to include the files that allows the shortcuts to be created from the installer batch file.
thanks"
,anonoymous_2012,2007-01-28T18:56Z,"the comment about the trojan is some mpaa dumbass trying to scare people into not copying DVD

the shortcut.exe is part of the windows 2003 server resource kit. If people are that scared the just download all the components yourself and use them.

RipIt4Me is at videohelp.com

fixVTS is at videohelp.com

dvd shrink 3.2 is at videohelp.com

funny dumbass my fully up to date symantec antivirus says nothing of a trojan and I only

upload stuff that I use myself."
,anonoymous_2012,2007-01-28T19:08Z,"DVDDecrypter is also at videohelp.com
just download all the components
put them in a folder on your desktop
and run them from there.
the mpaa is just pissed off because we are smarter
than they are and the hd DVD format has also been cracked. that is why they are spamming virus trojan warnings."
