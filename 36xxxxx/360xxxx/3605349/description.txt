RipIt4Me is a dvd ripper which uses DVDDecrypter,fixVTS,and dvdshrink to do
its job. I put all this together in a small package. Download unzip,click install
(uninstaller included) then go to your start menu and see About-RipIt4Me for further help including screenshots to help newbies set it up. The installer is optional
but then you wont get the start menu or desktop shortcut unless you manually create them. Slysoft anyDVD has been blacklisting keys like crazy so this application is a good alternative and is free and is being updated all the time to defeat even the newest copy protected DVD discs.
