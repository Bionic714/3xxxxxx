,ruben123,2007-01-23T16:19Z,its subbed with english subtitles
,carv,2007-01-23T19:16Z,Is this the version that I hear has the second line of subtitles chopped off due to a bad crop?
,ruben123,2007-01-24T01:42Z,"Carv: Is this the version that I hear has the second line of subtitles chopped off due to a bad crop?


Yes it is. the subtitle mostly goes on 1 line, but sometimes it goes over 2 lines and then u can only see the top line. I did have some problems getting the story because of this, but i didnt mind. I saw it for the eye-candy and that did show on screen :p
Other than that its a perfect rip. nice picture(exept for the cropping) and nice sound...
hope that helps...

And Kolll: nice up, we love u for it. But it takes u 2 min extra to post info."

,xaviel,2007-02-08T20:49Z,I download at 700kbs on private trackers. 300kps on public depending on the torrent. Speed varies depending on your connection & how many seeders there is.
,toomuch1060@hotmail.com,2007-02-09T02:11Z,yeah that is a good question how the fuck do you get such fast downloads..i use morpheuse as well and i get tops 60 kb/s ..i have DSL .. what program do you use and is there any sort of special settings ?
