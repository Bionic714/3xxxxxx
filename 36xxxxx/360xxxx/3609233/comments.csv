,pether,2007-02-02T17:14Z,Its already posted. -_-
,Jokkocze,2007-02-02T19:45Z,No it isnt.. this is the proper ViTALiTY release with a working crack..
,redhammer,2007-02-02T20:31Z,How do you know that? It has not yet been downloaded by anybody.
,Jokkocze,2007-02-02T21:07Z,"Yeah, and I got it from elsewhere a few hours ago :P"
,pether,2007-02-02T22:17Z,"The other one has a working crack too.
Just have to download it from GCW.


Geez. 'Pirates' these days cant do anything themselfs."
,maran123,2007-02-03T02:00Z,i trust Jokkocze and the others... an nfo file can't lie! its not their way :P
,the flesh ripper,2007-02-03T12:07Z,fucking crap game!!!!! dont bother
,redhammer,2007-02-03T17:56Z,"I was merely pointing out the fact alone, indeed, that it sayd: Downloaded: 0 times ..
Hence my pessimistic opinion on the matter..

Jeez, pirates cant understand simple numbers nowadays :P"
,T0nT0n,2007-02-03T21:38Z,"And some cannot fathom the idea that just because it's been downloaded here 3 times doesn't mean that it hasn't been downloaded elsewhere more.  For example, indexing sites often point to TPB..

Man, pirate-wannabes these days want to sound so smart, but generally fall flat."
,TheAnte,2007-02-03T22:57Z,Hmm is this fake? i mean it isnt even released yet? is this maybe the demo?
,Noremal,2007-02-04T00:55Z,"It's real, in English and it works.
But the gameplay is absolutely horrible, and every part of it just screams CONSOLE PORT.
Don't bother with it unless you really like the multiplayer."

,eKi100,2007-02-10T18:18Z,"olofsson_f:
U got that prob with any else game??
I got same kind of prob earlier, with every game almost... & reason was, that my graphics cards fan has broken.. Bought new cooling system to videocard & everything worked again.. So it might be cos ur videocard overheats, then pc reboots, to prevent any hardware damages.. Open ur pc case, turn pc on & see if ur videocards fan is rolling.. if its not, thats the prob.."

,Midfrost,2007-02-19T11:19Z,"Hello gentlemen, I'm experiencing a problem that I've never seen before. I'm using Azureus 2.5.0.4 and I'm getting an Error when trying to download this game. 

It says like this: ""Access denied, peers limit reached...""

Anyone that would know if this has to do with my client or if it has to do with the piratebay tracker?

Thanks alot in advance for the help.

,BelleKnast,2007-06-10T16:27Z,"Okey.. 

This is the general install for all the games or 90% of em :)

Step1: Download the game by pressing (Ladda ner denna torrent) (Download this torrent)

Step2: Unrar the iso file or the map were the game are in whit (Winrar) (Winzip)

Step3: If u got an iso/img file mount it by using (Deamontools)or(Alco120%)

Step4: Now install the game and follow the instruktions or something. The cdkey will u find in a text file whit the name Cdkey or in a systemfile whitch u open like this. (Rightklick/Openwhit/Textfile)

Step5: Crack! This is what the most ppl have there problems whit. U coppy the crack were u find on the disk or in a seperat mapp. Coppy the crack into ur gamefolder. If its an .EXE file u do the same but coppy the crackfile and make it ur lunch file.

Step6: Done! play ur game! GLHF!

Always make shure that u read the Info file before u do annything. If u are new tho the crack thing read everything and make shure u dont harm ur compiuter.
