Programme 1 (Brighton Dome):

In the first of a series of stand-up shows from his latest English tour, Ross Noble's packed audience in Brighton - where he has trouble recognising the gender of the Dome's ushers - not only includes two different dog lovers, but also a man who's keen to know why Ross was walking oddly in the Lanes earlier in the day. And yet there's a mysteriously empty seat.

Could its absent occupant have opted to stay at home watching television instead? Having explained how to rescue someone from the edge of a chaise longue, he can't stop himself telling a story even though it paints him in a bad light.
