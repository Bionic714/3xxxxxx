,kmanowitch,2007-02-23T02:21Z,"datelinenbc1> No it is not possible to play burned discs on an Xbox 360, so we just download the images and hope that one day it might be possible to do it... "
,aj22133,2007-03-01T13:59Z,it is possible to play burned games on the 360..you need a hacked firmware inorder for the games to boot.

,munestrike,2008-01-22T04:22Z,this game did not pass the stealth check in the xbox backup creator..
,spadesak47,2008-03-02T22:38Z,"This game consists of a bunch of files that cannot be extracted with winrar, i used izarc and extracted the 001 file which gave me an iso and a dvd file. But when i burned the dvd file using imgburn my 360 wouldnt recognize disc, whatever it is im sceptical. And if anyone figures it out a post would be appreciated, peace."
,sku_dave,2008-03-16T10:31Z,"UPDATE: Finally got it working ! I used the newest XDVDMulleter (10.2) to check the iso, and it fixed the video partition. I can probably upload a proper/working iso if there's demand.."
,spadesak47,2008-04-01T07:49Z,"Yep, should have thought of it myself, I had to use xdvdmulleter to get nba 2k8 to work, thanks sku dave, peace."

My net is slow but I will seed till there are no more peers. A few people use this pc so they might stop utorrent but I will TRY to keep this pc on 24/7.
,nateisnthere,2009-07-14T21:22Z,"If you have a problem...
I ran it thru mulleter and it gave me some garbage back. i dont remember or care what it said, but this is how you can fix it

download and run it thru AGBX (not sure how i did it, but it DID work. this isnt a very exact answer i know, but using that proggie will fix it. i promise, i changed no settings in the program i believe"
,danman91,2009-11-22T08:46Z,hey nateisnthere can u please upload a proper working ISO for this game?? this torrent is giving me zero downloading speed.. and I really want this game!
,danman91,2009-12-03T13:18Z,can anyone explain to me how to extract the .iso file from these buncha number files?? Usually the games I download have some .rar files so I select em all and extract to a single folder with a .iso and a .dvd.. But this game isn't giving me that extraction option..
,miloz23,2010-01-09T03:48Z,"@ danman81 - To exstract open up your winrar then select File/Open Archive and then change the Save as File Type to All Files. Find the file and click open then just drag and drop to exstract. I have had the prblem b4.

To make clear this does look to be an actual Fuzion Frenzy. I have not burned it yet, but i ran it through abgx and it came out clean and is Region Free."
,Zeezeer,2010-01-13T17:56Z,This is Fuzion Frenzy 2. But the .iso file is damaged and you have to run it through AGBX before burning. 
,zezette68,2010-08-01T16:25Z,Merci beaucoup pour ce jeu.
