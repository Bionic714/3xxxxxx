[V],VilleR2,2007-01-27T21:33Z,It's some kind of emulation = not the DOS version... You need quite a fast CPU to play without lag.

,SeekOut,2007-11-25T22:25Z,"The cheat ""DWARF"" don't work for me. How can I fix it? It's kinda lame to have to play through all levels every time I start the game."
,laterproblem,2009-03-13T13:22Z,"which key control do you use to jump? because I've tried space, the up-key, A, B and C. None of them is working. so which is it?"

,iloveanime,2009-11-18T20:32Z,Thanks i been looking for a lion king game for pc for quite some time
,iloveanime,2009-11-18T21:23Z,are there any cheats i'm having trouble getting through the first bit
,mrgogos,2011-02-12T17:44Z,WORKS PERFECT
,atma_gyan,2012-06-20T20:38Z,"As this is the Sega Genesis version, the ""dwarf"" cheat will not work. After a lot of experiments I came to find out that the A key (displayed in the options) is now the left control key, B is the space key and C the left shift key. This way you can make Simba roar, jump and slash. I also tried the cheats that exist on the internet for the Sega version with the ""deciphered"" combinations of keys but they don't work... Any help is welcome. Thanks VilleR2 for this torrent!"
