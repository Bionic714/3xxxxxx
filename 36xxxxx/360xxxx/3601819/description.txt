Death Note episode 13 subbed by TW under the new nickname DG
------------------------------------------------------------

Officially, Toriyamas World (TW) stopped 
subbing Death Note after Viz licensed the series.

However, that turned out not to be entirely true. 

Upon closer examination, one discovers that 
the TW staff actually continued to sub Death Note, 
but released it under a "new" group name - Death Gods (DG). 

Almost everything is exactly the same as it was before, 
even including the audio bitrate and vertical pixel height at 400.

"A new group called Death God Fansubs has released episode 13. Fans are saying that this group is made up of the Toriyamas World staff under a different name, excluding the TW translator who works for Viz."

"everything is the same as TW except they hide their nicknames by using names as Yagami Light, Ryuk etc. And use a different karaoke which has already been mentioned. Even the OP-Karaoke got the same translation so I bet they got the same translator.

Everyone who followed TWs releases should now follow DG."
