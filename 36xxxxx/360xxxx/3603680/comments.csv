,Roscoe91,2007-01-30T00:56Z,"I´m stuck on 98.3% too.  This torrent is not mine, I just upped it here from torrentportal.  The DVDs will still play with VLC player."
,HangLoose,2007-02-05T13:41Z,"Tackar, funkar perfect.
""kanske mitt fel att inte King's funkade så bra (alla lektioner forcerades mot slutet ""klipptes av"") prövade ett par DVD's av dom, (ok egentligen bara sista ordet som försvann (men för en perfectionist lite irriterande)."" jag tittar alltid via Dameontools i PowerDVD , funkat på allt utom King's, sen delete, bränner sällan, vill aldrig se om samma film. igen.
Nu är allt raderat, jag seedade som vanligt 200 %"
