If everybody thought that way, such lazy uploaders wouldn't show up.

,PsI_INk,2007-01-29T23:04Z,THIS MOVIE KICKS BIG HORSESCHLONGS ASS!!! Would have been nice with some info though?!
,UltraBrazil,2007-01-30T02:47Z,"Well hey there Jimmy boy, there's really no point in spamming about free movies TV shows on a website like this one. And who the hell wants to watch movies online, by streaming them I'd guess, when you can just download them and not have to deal with the performance issues you usually get when you attempt to watch these things online?"
,Allisoj3,2007-01-30T04:05Z,Is this Movie working for anyone else??
[V],Kuthumi,2007-01-30T08:38Z,"This worked fine for me. No password, unpacked well, looks OK with good picture quality and synch, English dialogue. If you get error message when unpacking, try right-ckicking the torrent in Azureus and choose ""Force re-check"". It will then re-download possible corrupt pieces."
,backups,2007-01-31T01:51Z,"The movie is ok, good video and audio but included subs are out of sync subfix released still out of sync"
,FeslinG,2007-02-10T03:30Z,"wankers. and i dont know if it spelled correktly. there is a real world, focus focus focus.


Kollll> nice work-love it"
,krunelune,2007-02-11T15:08Z,"To the people who say this movie is crap, well.. that ay be your taste but i fear that you are speaking from pure ignorance and no frame of reference of who the director is. This is why this movie boggled your mind and you didnt understand its content because you have a very limited frame of reference.

I suggest you read this: http://imdb.com/find?s=all&q=Michel+Gondry

And this: http://www.director-file.com/gondry/

And perhaps educate yoruself into this directors previous work in documentary films aswell as fiction flicks... and not to mention awesome music videos.
