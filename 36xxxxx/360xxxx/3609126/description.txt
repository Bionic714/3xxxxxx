This weeks episode.
Tears is the theme.  Not sure if it'll be tears of joy or complete and utter misery?
Hehe.
Both probably.
File is of high quality MP3 at 320 VBR stereo @ 44,000hz.


PLEASE BE AWARE THAT, AT FIRST, SEEDING IS SLOW.

If it isn't good enough for you then no point complaining, just let someone else connect to me instead.
If the site says there are no seeds then the site will be WRONG.
I am NOt switching this off for weeks now...and erm, I only just rebooted for the first time in a long time anyway...I always seed, this PC never sleeps!
So please be patient.
If it helps, try to just DL the show you want to hear first from me as I will be here seeding ALL of the shows, from #01 right to the present day, very soon.
I just finished naming and tagging/encoding etc all of the mp3s but am going to seed in groups of 5 or 6 until they get going well.


Ok that's my novel finished.
