They are afraid that foreign tourists will create accidents, yet when I was there back in 2006, I saw plenty of collisions involving native Bermudians who couldn't drive for shit.  I think we here in the USA are far better drivers than those Carribean boneheads who don't grasp the concept of yielding the right of way."
