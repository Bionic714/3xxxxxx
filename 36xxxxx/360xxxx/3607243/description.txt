Killa (Shin Ha Kyun of Save The Green Planet!) is a bright young man with a little problem, making his life hell on earth: his tongue is too short. Every time he opens his mouth, he ends up embarrassing himself. But there\'s a way out! A 100 million won operation will fix all his problems, but the key is finding the money. To get the money as fast as possible, Killa becomes a, well, killer. Eaten alive by the guilt of becoming a mere mercenary, he quickly makes a decision to kill only those who truly deserve it, to rid this society of all its rotten apples. As they say, No Mercy For The Rude.
