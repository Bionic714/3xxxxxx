,Ac_blenda,2008-12-15T17:08Z,"Look mate. It's been explained above quite clearly but just to be on the safe side.
> Install program.
> Run program (inside Cubase, logic etc...).
> You will then be asked to authorise the copy.
> Do so by choosing the Authorise 'OFFLINE' option
> You will then be given a 'Chanllenge code'
> copy and paste this into the top box in the keygen
> press 'Generate'
> now copy the code you have been given into the authorisation window which you should have left open in Cubase or logic or whatever sequencer you are using
> Now press enter
> Job Done
By the way.... brilliant realease
Thanks alot"
