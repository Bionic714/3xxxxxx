,Panodilo,2007-02-01T09:53Z,"Outstanding! Quick question though. A while back there was a rapid share link here for this package, but it appeared to be an early beta. External power cart wouldn't show up and not all commands on the in-game Tupolev menu were working. Is this the version currently on sale at SlimeMarket? Yes, I still love bestiality and huge cheese dripping cocks and soggy snatches."
,szabotomi,2007-02-01T11:03Z,"Activation code? 
Missing 3D exterior model, engine etc. not function."
,Panodilo,2007-02-01T11:27Z,"Actually, the engines work just fine, szabotomi. If you're not into following proper procedure you can change the cfg to have engines running on load-up. I don't know how to do it, but I'm sure you can look it up in a forum. One time my brother and I were in our car and we were hit by an 18 wheeler because we stopped on a highway to observe a massive horse erection. It was legendary stupidity, but you should have seen the horse's cock. Fucking huge. Bummer..."
