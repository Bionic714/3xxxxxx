Ok, this is my first torrent, I do not plan to make any more.

I ripped the cd\'s using nero (omg, so not pro tools) and found serial online,
yes I\'m gay I don\'t give away my own -.-  patch is from the official website
which no longer exists - www.tron20.net - you\'ll just get redirected.

Anyways
TRON 2.0 is a great game, and I thought I\'d share it with the world. So enjoy =)


Storyline---
TRON 2.0 is based upon the movie from Disney made in 1981 called TRON (I\'ve added
a torrent for that movie aswell, worth watching) where a digitization technology
makes analog into digital, which means that a person can enter the computer world.
Kevin Flynn gets unwillingly digitized in the movie, and helps the program TRON, 
created by his best fren Alan Bradley, destroys a rouge self-learning AI program
called the Master Control Program, or MCP from terrorising the computer world.

20 years later, Jethro, or just Jet Bradley, son of Lora and Alan Bradley is
following his fathers footsteps and has entered the world of programing.
Inside the computer an email script is being presented to Thorne

Script		: Please, i have to get back to my routing. I\'m already behind on my
		  deliveries this cycle.
Thorne		: You have privileges i require
Script		: I\'m just a simple email script, I
Thorne		: I know what you are, and i know what you\'ll become...
	WHOOOOOSH
Script		: Aaaahh.... ouch, oh, ah, ohh...
Thorne		: Tell me, what is your function?
Infected script	: I serve Thorne, my master User

Meanwhile in the real world...

*Blip, blip* - Game sounds coming from an arcade machine labeled TRON being played
by Jet

Lab worker : Jet, do you think your dad would mind if i had some of his popcorn?
Jet	   : Huh? Oh sure, have all you want... -loses game being distracted-
   *phone rings*
Jet	   : yeah?
Alan	   : I\'m a little surprised you turned down the level six programing
	     position
Jet	   : ...Look dad, I know you\'re disappointed-
Alan	   : Damn right I\'m disappointed!  ...I pulled a lot of strings to get you
	     that offer.
Jet	   : I\'m happy making games. Life is short, pop. I plan to enjoy it.
Alan	   : You sound just like Flynn

  Alan pushes a buton but suddenly a sound comes from his
  computer alerting of an error.

Alan	   : Ma3a (mathrea), run a security diagnostic.
Ma3a	   : Yes, Alan One
(Jet is recognized as Alan Two, as father and son is not a known term in computers)
-Results?
-A Virus has entered the system via e-mail. Lab drives one, two and four infected
-Jet, we\'ll have to continue this conversation later...
 *knocking or more like banging on the door\"
-This is a restricted area, you just can\'t come barging in here
-Dad?
-Get your hands off me-
-Dad, can you hear me?
beep beep beep - the phone has been hung up...

Jet rushes to the lab and can\'t find his dad or the intruders anywhere.
-Ma3a, where\'s my father?
-Alan two, i require imediate assitance
-What dou you mean?
-Contingency Protocol Activated
*Laser activity in five seconds.
-Ma3a, stop what you\'re doing!
*Put on gogles*
*Clear digitizing bay*
*Put on gogles*
-AAAHH---



Jet  : Ma3a? What did you do?
Byte : So you are a User. Fascinating.
