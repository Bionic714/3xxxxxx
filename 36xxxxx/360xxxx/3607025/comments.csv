,JohnTheMutt,2007-12-18T23:54Z,"This game release is put together well. Everything works no problems installing it using Daemon Tools.  Does not contain a 'no-cd' exe...but that is obtained easily enough through gamecopyworld. 

Thanks to Raindance for the release and the uploader as well. :)"
,csuli93,2007-12-19T19:54Z,"hmmm... i dunno if its my computers fault or the torrent is corrupted, everything looks okay (even no crack needed and the SN works), but after the training and the 2nd map (so before the 3rd) named the system integration my computer after the loeding screen suddenly restarts. any ideas? everybody has the same issue or my computer is bad?

thx"
,hokasu,2008-03-11T09:31Z,"This is how I got it to work:
Find or download:
Tron 2.0 v1.042c [ENGLISH] No-CD/Fixed EXE (brz-t214.rar)
and
Tron 2.0 v1.0 [ENGLISH] No-CD Patch (dev-t2nc.rar)
from gamecopyworld and use Lithtech.exe from the later and Tron.exe from the former."

,Szimen,2008-08-16T17:23Z,"you're supposed to mount the images (.iso file) using e.g. daemon tools (recommended, google it), alcohol, powerISO or even nero virtual drive"

,efeffess,2011-09-08T18:10Z,"What a fun little game this is.

The light cycle subgame was nicely designed; it keeps in line with the original Tron 90 degree angles, but it's in 3D and you have the option of having the camera follow behind the cycle or free range camera movement with the mouse while it follows the cycle. (Many of the sound effects in the game in general were nabbed from Tron, too.)

For those who are having problems running this game, the following instructions are recommended for ALL users:

1) Identify your motherboard, video and sound devices.

Windows Update will likely be able to identify your devices if you don't already know them, and install some basic drivers for you.

Open Control Panel -> System (under XP at least), click the Hardware tab, and click the Device Manager button. Run through the list of devices and note which ones are your motherboard, video and audio.

2) Visit the manufacturer's Web site for each device and download the latest drivers.

If drivers aren't available on the manufacturer's Web site (as happens with older devices), you may be able to search the Web for it. Type in your device make and model as well as the words ""download driver"" (without the quotes).

3) Install the drivers, reboot if necessary.

Your games should not only run, but operate faster.

Thanks for the upload, Szimen! This is a definite keeper."
