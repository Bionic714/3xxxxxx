,skarvarn,2007-02-02T22:41Z,Absolutely fantastic !  Im definately gonna buy this CD ! Thanks for this Promo.
,Thriss1,2007-02-09T00:31Z,"This is just a promo but if you ask me they have totally ruined this production. Every song has been edited to crossfade with the next, and well, it sounds really bad!! My first thought was: ""WTH, is wrong with the sound, lagg or sumething?""

Though we're lucky it's just a promo and hopefully they will remove the crossfading for the real album. I recommend redownloading a retail version when it is released if they remove the crossfading."
