Another musicvideo that is "hard to get" that I found on an old backupcd... 
It┬┤s "Rupert and the Frog Song"...the musicvideo where all the frogs are singing!
Everyone around my age must be fond of it so I thought I┬┤d better upload it. 
I try to focus on uploading stuff that is hard to get on the internet / old.
If you like my uploads, let me know! If not, let me know as well..
