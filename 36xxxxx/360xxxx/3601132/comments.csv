no seed, no download."
,samspopguy,2007-01-22T06:54Z,i wished my cable company didnt get rid of scifi on their standard package
,TekNoWene,2007-01-22T07:19Z,Where did the seeders go!?
,phoemix,2007-01-22T07:31Z,"yeah, where are the seeders?
and why is the filesize is not the usal ~349MB ?"
,Scav242,2007-01-22T07:41Z,"Because its not the Orenji release.

I'm still leeching, but slow :)"
,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-01-22T07:42Z,This file is of slightly lower resolution and quality than the typical 350mb file.

,sharelove,2007-01-22T07:52Z,This has already been banned from private trackers. It's a fake.
,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-01-22T07:55Z,"I assure you it is not a fake, ripped tonight from scifi, universal HD will replay it in HD next saturday night, expect a ~350mb file then. "
,foobarbazqux,2007-01-22T08:07Z,I already have the first block of the file and can play it with mplayer--it starts just the same as they all do.  Don't think it's a fake.  Unfortunately there is exactly one seed right now!
,death734,2007-01-22T08:15Z,even if it was in hd next week the scene groups would still get a dsr rip for the people that want it asap. just like they did with that kyle xy (or what ever its called) show that was on abc family in 4:3 dsr and then hdtv 4-5 days later
,Gorzilla,2007-01-22T08:27Z,"@zlusterdenver: which HD format? 

Sorry for saying this but imho the quality of all these 350 MB releases sucks. Maybe it's due the bad picture quality of some (us) tv channels."
,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-01-22T08:34Z,"After I get the HD feed, I can give you a 720p feed with stereo sound at about 2gb for 42mins, in xvid avi. Or the full 1080i feed as an mpg at about 2.5GB."
,phoemix,2007-01-22T08:45Z,"once i've checked a 1080i release of a tv series, and it was badly a/v desynced... till that i'm afraid of these releases. however, the picture quality kicked ass"
,mh2360,2007-01-22T08:46Z,"The one and only seed has disappeared, now we got over a 1000 people downloading a file that is only 1/3 complete... :/"
,zlusterdenver@hotmail.com,2007-01-22T08:50Z,i have uploaded 230MiB so far
,phoemix,2007-01-22T08:58Z,"for a long time by now, i'm not connected to any seeders, just 200+ peers :("

I've been having trouble keeping the a/v synced when resizing to 720p, I think I finally have that problem fixed. However the 1080i rip is just a strait up HD rip and is essentially uncompressed so the quality is as good as you would see it on your HDTV. However for computer playback you must deinterlace the video, my graphics card only supports software deinterlacing, and since my TV is a 720p for my personal use I only require a 720p signal with stereo sound. Since my computer isnt the fastest or has the most vram VLC player tends to get choppy with the playback during deinterlacing. 

Now if you had a blue ray burner and wished to burn the 1080i content your HDTV should deinterlace that signal automatically.

in addition to having the 1080i mpg with stereo sound I also have the transport stream rip(1080i) with dolby surround in a .ts(playable with VLC) file that is slighty larger than its .mpg counterpart."

Well, right now I am the only seed, and I am only uploading to 2 persons right now, and so far they have capped my bandwidth at about 40kb/s."
,jubitzu,2007-01-22T09:07Z,im about to be the second seeder... 9 minutes
,phoemix,2007-01-22T09:07Z,"you don't understand :)
i'm living in central europe, hungary. HDTV is just an experimental stuff here, we don't even have proper equipments in the homes for it. i don't watch TV for 7-8 years by now, just download some series that i like."
,machiavelli,2007-01-22T09:08Z,"Where has the seeder gone?

My program shows there are no seeders and the availability is only 0.4 (and I am almost stuck at 40+%)"

however, there is a guy with 62%...

,Gorzilla,2007-01-22T09:53Z,"@zlusterdenver: 

Thanks for your response! 
720p in XviD (or H.264/MPEG-4 AVC) would be really nice and 1080i perfect! =)
2 and 2,5 GB is huge, but I would download and share them! 
Is there no good way to reduce the size to XXX or lets say ~1,3 GB per episode without loosing too much quality?"

1080i represents the fewest issues for encoding, the full quality 1080i for 42 minutes runs right around 2.5 gb. I have targeted 1gb in 720, but by the time I lower the bitrate to hit 1gb the compression gets to the point that the 350mb files that we all know and love look better(at least when blown up on my 1280x720 37 inch tv).

I have been playing with this for awhile and am still trying to find what will work the best. As I said before I have had problems keeping the a/v synched, but I think I just made a breakthrough on that this weekend. 

So far xvid has presented the fewest issues for encoding the 1080i rip, audio is correctly synchronized etc. If you want I can go ahead and publish the 1080i feeds in full quality."
,phoemix,2007-01-22T10:27Z,"i think 720p would be just enough :)
i have a 1600x1200 screen res at my desktop, so that would be just enough :)"

Ok, I understand. 
It should also look nice on larger LCD-TVs.

""I have been playing with this for awhile and am still trying to find what will work the best. As I said before I have had problems keeping the a/v synched, but I think I just made a breakthrough on that this weekend.""

Keep trying! :-) Possibly you will find some useful information on the internet (forums, etc.).

I guess BSG won't be available on HD-DVD/Blu-ray by 2009. 1080i is maybe the best solution for people who will watch it on their big 16:10 TFTs or LCD-TVs in an amazing quality. If you have the capacity, I would release the episodes in 1080i. I'm sure there will be better codecs (or solutions) in the near future so people can create a smaller video file."
,Gorzilla,2007-01-22T11:14Z,"@phoemix:
I know a lot people who already own a big 16:10 TFT or/and an HD-ready LCD-TV and would love to watch movies/series/television at its best. This year the price for both will drop dramatically and besides that, 19:10 (1080i/p) will become standart for the next years.

But 720p for sure is still fine.
i think 720p would be just enough :)

,Gorzilla,2007-01-22T11:36Z,"ups...  sorry, I'm having lunch. :-D

720p is still a lot better then these crappy 350 releases. If 1080i is too intricate/unhandy, i say go for 720p. But as long as only ""one"" (or two?) kind guy releases BSG episodes in HD (which are really rare and the quality of these 700 MB releases isn't the best), 1080i maybe is imo the better format for the moment.
