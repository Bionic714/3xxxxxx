this one i did just for fun and a challenge.  basically this is a big mix of loops i found all over the internet or got in a sample collection i paid for or something that just sounded cool i riped off a CD or record.  any way the challenge was i can't use more then 3 or 4 of them at a time.  and i did just that.
