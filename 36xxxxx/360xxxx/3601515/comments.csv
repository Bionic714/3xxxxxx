http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4444417/Rome_Seasons_1_amp_2_By_Slim 

is having a problem.  We lost the only seeder at around 92.3% complete.  I found a torrent that had the same versions of 9 of the 10 episodes in the second season, but S02E02 was different between the two versions.  It looks like this file is the one that I'm looking for.  However, since it's in .rar form, not .avi form, I can't copy over the data that I've already downloaded.  Could someone who has a complete version of this file start the torrent listed above, copy this .avi over the one in that torrent, and seed it to the rest of us?  We would be most appreciative, and you'd save the world about 50 gigabytes of bandwidth."
