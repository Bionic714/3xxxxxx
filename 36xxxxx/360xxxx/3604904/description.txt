Extremely Rare (and out of print now) Varese edition of this soundtrack includes 20 extra minutes worth of music scores that were not included on the Milan (original) release that was released in LP form only here in the U.S. 

Encoding: Lame V3.93 CBR @ 320 KBPS. 

The Sound quality is much improved over the original Milan release in 1982, but could use a complete remastering that were never likely to see.

This ones all but lost, Keep it alive.
