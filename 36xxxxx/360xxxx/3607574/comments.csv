[V],Kuthumi,2007-02-01T07:24Z,"Thanks for superfast download, would be nice with a full dvd. Swedish subs are optional. The file is a little too big to fit unto a data-CD without overburning. This film was renamed ""Fjols til fjells"" (""Fools on the hill"") by Norwegian scandal-magazine Se & Hør because mr. Stallone is climbing around in icy mountains just wearing a T-shirt."
