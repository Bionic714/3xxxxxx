,mhomho,2007-01-22T05:01Z,this is the strangest musical films I have ever seen. Seriously messed up ending!
,lÃ¤ggdags,2007-01-22T11:08Z,The greatest horrorfilm ever made.
,Kraxl,2007-06-16T00:34Z,is it the 84 or 100 min version?
,dwd,2007-08-10T13:14Z,"It's the 84 minute original theatrical version. I actually have the 100 minute director's cut here as well, but... Studio Canal who released the DVD chose, for some stupid reason, to ""augment"" the differences of the theatrical and director's cut versions by changing the video quality of the scenes containing the extra 16 minutes, and it looks utterly crap - grainy picture, pale/purple/green in color, and muffled sound. It completely destroys the experience of watching the director's cut, so I didn't bother to rip it..."
,martialis,2007-10-31T18:35Z,"this format is extremely processor intensive and will not play on my computer (or any dvd player, from what I read).  Any advice?
A smart person would have read the description and checked that.  Oops."
,dwd,2007-12-04T14:56Z,"H.264 isn't THAT ""extremely processor intensive"", actually, but it does require a bit more than normal mpeg-4 (xvid, divx etc.). The fastest H.264 decoder I've tried is the one Quicktime, and after that the one used in mplayer and MPC ( http://mplayerhq.hu/ & http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli/ ). Hope it helps."
,Troy123,2008-06-14T22:57Z,"WinAvi Is the fastest decoder. Avi To DVD best quality decoder. For best play back.
Uninstall media player classic
Install k-lite codic pack first
then install ac3filter, coreAvc-pro, coreAAC and Haali Media Splitter (matroskaSplitter.exe).
then go to start, all programs,k-lite and open Media Player Classic go to VIEW then
Option then then open filters then click on
 (external filters or overrides) in the top right
 corner is a butten Add Filter... click on it find
Haali Media Splitter click on it so it is hi lighted and
 then click on ok. Then do the same for the other 3.
Only uses 6% of my cpu when and playing mkv's at 1080p."
,dwd,2008-07-23T21:12Z,"yeah and it's not because of coreavc or winavi, it's because your nvidia graphics card has AVC hardware decoding... ffdshow+mpc does the same job your 15 programs and 15 codec-packs do, in just 2 programs and 1.5mb size..."
,snowbirds,2008-12-11T06:15Z,"First, thanks dwd for uploading this movie.  2nd, they didn't choose to ""augment"" the 100 minute version by making it grainy and muffled. The 12 minutes of footage that was cut from the theatrical version and was then spliced back in was of poorer quality, but it was all they had available, the rest was lost.  Having said that I feel it is my duty to point out that the 88 minute theatrical release is a VERY different movie than the original 102 minute version. Different = BAD.  The 88 minute version is chopped all to hell and barely makes sense.  The longer version is probably the coolest, cult classic, 70's, British horror/thriller ever made.  Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch this 88 minute version.  Wait until you can watch the 100 minute version otherwise you will spoil one of the coolest films you will ever see."

,exapporiton,2008-12-18T17:18Z,"THANKS!!

Great quality, anybody having problems with the format just install VLC Media Player. No codecs, no nothing. It plays excellent on my computer.

Thanks again."
