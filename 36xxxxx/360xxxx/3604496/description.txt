GEORGE BUSH INTRO...

"Good evening, I would like to report on the state of our war against the American people, we are mounting a sustained campaign to crack down on every American and every person of every faith and every nation and to bring them to justice.  All missions are being executed according to plan without warning or provocation.  Americans are being swept up in an international dragnet, thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other citizens here and abroad.  It has everything to do with hate and evil and murder and prejudice... America is strong"

LOUD VOICE SHOUTS...

"Federal agents, we are armed!"

SONG BEGINS...

What would you do if you 
Knew all of the things we know
Would you stand up for truth 
Or would you turn away too? 
And then what if you saw
All of the things that's wrong 
Would you stand tall and strong? 
Or would you turn and walk away

REPEAT CHORUS 

I see a message from the government, like every day
I watch it, and listen, and call 'em all suckas 
They warnin' me about Osama or whatever 
Picture me buyin' this scam I said "never" 
You in tune to a Hard Truth soldier spittin'
I stay committed gives a fuck to die or lose commission
It's all a part of fightin' devil state mind control 
And all about the battle for your body mind and soul
And now I'm hopin' you don't close ya mind - so they shape ya 
Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us Aids and raped us 
Another Bush season mean another war for profit 
All in secret so the public never think to stop it 
The Illuminati triple six all connected 
Stolen votes they control the race and take elections 
It's the Skull and Bones Freemason kill committee 
See the Dragon gettin' shittier in every city

REPEAT CHORUS x2

Now ask yourself who's the people with the most to gain (Bush) 
'fore 911 motherfuckas couldn't stand his name (Bush) 
Now even niggas waivin' flags like they lost they mind 
Everybody got opinions but don't know the time 
'Cause Amerikkka's been took - it's plain to see 
The oldest trick in the book is make an enemy
A phony evil so the government can do its dirt 
And take away ya freedom lock and load, beat and search 
Ain't nothin' changed but more colored people locked in prison 
These pigs still beat us but it seem we forgettin' 
But I remember 'fore September how these devils do it
Fuck Giuliani ask Diallo how he doin' 
We in the streets holla 'jail to the thief' follow 
wavin' flags bring these dragons to they knees 
Oil blood money makes these killers ride cold 
Suspicious suicides people dyin' never told 
It's all a part of playin' God so ya think we need 'em 
While 'Bin Ashcroft' take away ya rights to freedom 
Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators 
Hope you understand the time brother cause it's major

REPEAT CHORUS

So now you askin why my records always come the same 
Keep it real, ain't no fillers, motherfucka blingin' 
Mine eyes seen the gory of the coming of the beast 
So every story every word I'm sayin' 'Fuck Peace' 
See you could witness the Illuminati body count 
Don't be surprised these is devils that I'm talkin' bout 
You think a couple thousand lives mean shit to killers? 
I swear to God we the ones - ain't no villans [sic] 
Or any other word they think to demonize a country 
Ain't no terror threat unless approval ratings slumpin' 
So I'ma say it for the record we the ones that planned it 
Ain't no other country took a part or had they hand in 
It's all a way to keep ya scared so you think you need'em 
Praisin' Bush while that killer take away ya freedom 
How many of us got discovered but ignore the symptoms? 
Niggaz talkin' loud but ain't nobody sayin' shit' 
And with the fourth Amendment gone eyes are on the first 
That's why I'm spittin' cyanide each and every verse 
I see the Carlyle group and Harris Bank Accounts 
I see 'em plead the fifth each and every session now 
And while Reichstag burns I see the public buy it 
I see the profilin see the media's compliance 
War is good for business see the vicious make a savior 
Hope you understand the time brother cause its major
