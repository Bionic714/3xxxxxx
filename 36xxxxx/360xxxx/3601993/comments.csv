Simply don't upload if you do not intend to seed"
,Cyric2030,2007-01-23T12:16Z,"Im sorry, my main computer dumped on me im trying to get it back up and running. I hope to be seeding again shortly,"
,BullyBoy88,2007-01-23T13:53Z,It seems to be real.
,tantanx,2007-01-23T14:11Z,"What makes u say that BullyBoy88?

As far as i know, no one has 100% of the file yet, im trying to use avifix to preview the 72% available, but the program freezes on me, will get back when i've confirmed the authenticity of the file. "
,BullyBoy88,2007-01-23T14:25Z,"I have downloaded over 70% so far, and i have opened the file with VLC media player too find out if it was real or not."
,tantanx,2007-01-23T14:47Z,It's THE REAL DEAL! :) (Or atleast 86.7% of it :P )
,-aurora,2007-01-23T15:04Z,will this torrent work in windows media player?
,K-manX,2007-01-23T15:24Z,"100% and it IS the real deal ;)
Start is a bit rough (not the previously... bit) and not the best of quality but is stilll good ;)"
,K-manX,2007-01-23T15:29Z,"...and it's called ""Submersion"", not ""Submerged"""
,plau,2007-01-23T15:31Z,"Thanks tantanx and K-manX :)
And ofcourse ULer :P"
,DocHOL,2007-01-23T15:37Z,Pretty badly interlaced. I wonder why no proper release of this episode has appeared yet?
,enick,2007-01-23T15:44Z,"craptastic quality, mate! you could've taken your thumb out of your ass first. ffs how hard is it to google for some encoding tips?"
,Thany,2007-01-23T15:48Z,not good quality :((((
,sN1b,2007-01-23T16:00Z,"Quality takes time m8, if you want your episodes fast then you can't expect too much. The HR releases usually arent out around this time yet. The smaller sized recodes naturally will take up to 12 hours more to be released."
,enick,2007-01-23T18:42Z,There's no excuse for a bad deinterlace. It won't speed up anything.
,highonscifi,2007-01-23T18:49Z,"Well, I, for one, am VERY glad you uploaded so quickly!  THANK YOU!!!!!!  After all the trouble I had getting episode 14 (Sunday) last week, I appreciate an ep that downloads quickly and has the audio working perfectly.  And for that, I thank you again!!!!
"
,sharelove,2007-01-23T20:54Z,"Thanks for sharing :)
Quality's could be better, but watchable. Guess that's the price it being out so fast."
,hexmex,2007-01-23T22:43Z,next time please stay to normal writing conventions coz this file is not in the TV series folder of stargate atlantis season3. anyway thx for uploading.
,fennesz,2007-01-24T01:11Z,"I'm very happy with this release.

Yes, the quality is NOT superior. The sound is alright though, and if you plan on watching it on a regular TV-screen, it's really no difference whatsoever.

This is definetly watchable, and thank you very much for the upload Cyric2030."
,death734,2007-01-24T04:29Z,"there is no proper because this is someone's personal capture. not a scene release.
I've heard its ws.dsr quality."
,DanPainter,2007-01-24T05:03Z,Should a scene release be uploaded soon?
