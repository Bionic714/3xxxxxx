Quality and Source:
I would rate the video as good but not great 9/10, but the
audio as perfect (10/10). This was probably a DVD Rip, but
the video was compressed a little too much for my liking
(but I'm picky). Many of you will probably think that the
video is fine/perfect. The movie is very watchable. Look
for comments from others on MiniNova to see how other
people judge the video quality.

I downloaded this from Rapidshare - a painstaking process
I wouldn't wish on anybody.
