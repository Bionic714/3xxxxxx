CIA's supposed to identify a mole, but instead they randomly pick Tom Hanks, because he wears one red shoe.Really funny stuff, since the Hanks character is really an eccentric co classical composer, who doesn't drive. They spend millions of dollars trying to decode his musical compositions, but it turns out to be only music. Haha!"
