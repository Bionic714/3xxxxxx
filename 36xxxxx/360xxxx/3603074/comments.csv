[T],Knaster,2007-01-25T03:57Z,Wrestling sucks it's not even real fights! lol just stoopid actors
,White_Warrior,2007-01-25T09:04Z,"Well, It ain´t the best wrestling game for Pc.
It ain´t even a good wrestlig game...

It´s a wrestling game, with bad graphic, and ""Real"" wrestlers with fake names.

Well Guys, I can recomend a game that well beat the living hell out of this one,  Start your Nintendo 8-bit and play Pro Wrestling.

Now you know how good this game is."
,The Phenomenal,2007-01-25T14:52Z,"this game isn't about the graphics but about the gameplay.the graphics aren't very good but the gameplay...
there are so many possibilities...u can climb a ladder u can go up anything
and there ARE real wrestlers and real wrestling federation too...
there are SD!,RAW,TNA,Stamped wrestling,NJPW and others...
there's a patch for that..."
