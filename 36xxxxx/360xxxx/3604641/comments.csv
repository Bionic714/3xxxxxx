,CWC_Cougar,2007-01-28T10:44Z,"Hi guys and gals. This torrent has a few errors in it. I've uploaded another torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3605214) with the problems fixed.

It replaces \""072 - Jet - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is.mp3\"" (which was actually 25 minutes of silence) with the correct file. Also, a renamed file \""022 - Tool - One Crowded Hour.mp3\"" to \""022 - Tool - Vicarious.mp3\"". The original file is actually correct, its just named and tagged incorrectly.

All the rest of the files are identical, so you should just be able to redirect the new torrent to the old files and it will just get the updated ones.

Sorry for the inconvenience but I wanted to get it out quickly."

If you want to see the 101 to 200th song list of past years, please post a comment to Richard Kingsmill's (The station manager and an announcer) blog where he lists the 101 to 200 songs:

I have got the ball rolling with my comment. I also would like to see him publish the entire list so we know exactly where our favourites ended up."
