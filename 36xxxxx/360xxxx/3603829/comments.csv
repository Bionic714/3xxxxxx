,ecsisbest,2007-01-26T16:47Z,Where's the seed?
,monnie110,2007-01-26T18:34Z,Just woke up. Computer crashed. It's back.
,ecsisbest,2007-01-28T00:44Z,"Unfortunately, this download is getting nowhere. I would really like it."
,monnie110,2007-01-28T06:24Z,"Sorry it's a new release so it will take atleast a few days before more seeders are around. Their's a ton of leechers up. Once more people have the full release their will be more seeders. I'm on cable. Try to have patience, it's a worth it. I understand your frustrations though. Again, sorry bout that. It's a new release and I'm not in a group at this time so I don't have any curriers."
,monnie110,2007-01-28T06:26Z,I'm willing to upload it to an FTP dump if anyone has one. 
,ecsisbest,2007-01-28T08:26Z,"Well, it's just that I am also having trouble with this PC. It keeps crashing and rebooting. I am going to have to take it down and reinstall Windows. Unfortunatelylooks like a pattern with Windows XP. The more I use it, especially to download, the more crazy it gets. This has happened to me on three other PCs, so I know it can't be the hardware. They are different.

This is the last huge file I have, and I don't want to have to download it again.

Thanks for your efforts though."
,ecsisbest,2007-01-29T21:13Z,"This downloaded nicely on the weekend, but now it just uploads. Can you seed some more?"
,monnie110,2007-01-30T01:55Z,Yup. I'll be seeding this everyday for a while. If I'm not seeding it's because the computer either crashed or an upgrade is being done on it but it will be right back up. :)
,ecsisbest,2007-01-30T03:12Z,"Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. I understand about the crashes. Mine is still crashing, about 2-3 times in 24 hours. After I get this, unless the pc won't boot, I will be reinstalling the OS after I get the downloads off disk."
,Fulefejs,2007-01-30T20:59Z,"Thanks guys, for youre effort. I´ve been lookin´for this all over the net.
I promise to help seeding (if I can get my wife to stop turning azureus off to surf quicker)"
,kawmic,2007-01-31T15:29Z,Where's the rest? Over 100 users are stuck at 99.3%
,kawmic,2007-01-31T15:41Z,"To Fulefejs: Why don't you just make a passwordprotected login for yourself, then the only way she can turn off your up/downloads is by restarting? Another thing, why did you tell her that downloading slows surfing? I'll bet she didn't know."
,Fulefejs,2007-01-31T22:45Z,"Thanx monnie, for not giving up. This means a lot for me.
kawmic; I didn´t, but a (former ;-)) friend gladly helps her to turn of my downloads, were sharing the same line..."
,NewRevol,2007-02-07T14:38Z,Great to read though the comments. I have just started downloading it and I hope you will be just as sharing as it looks like you have been. Then I will definatly seed (have great internet)
,monnie110,2007-02-11T03:49Z,:D I'm still seeding. Glad you guys like it 
,ReXChalle,2007-02-13T11:42Z,Why does it say that it works on wind 2000 when it does NOT??
,J0RDGUBBE,2007-02-21T16:21Z,Seed plz... ;D
,monnie110,2007-03-04T22:02Z,"ReXChalle it works on Win2000, if it isn't working for you then you must not have the DivX codec installed. You can get it at www.DivX.com like the NFO says."
,Sweet_,2007-04-16T10:53Z,does it works on xp ?
,Bamse_young,2007-04-17T14:30Z,"I can't get any sound from the speakers when I play a soundfile in the program.
What's wrong?
it's set at ASIO mutlimedia driver"
,joeybhoy,2007-05-30T00:59Z,cheers
,jazzman88,2007-07-20T00:41Z,"Most cool, and thank you very much.  Just one little problem monnie110 - I don't get audio on the Cubase tutorials, just video, on my WinXP SP2 with DivX.  Reason tutorials all play perfectly.  When I check out the properties the Reason audio is in an MPEG layer format whereas the Cubase ones have no such entry.  Appreciate your advice please."
,jazzman88,2007-07-29T23:38Z,"Re Cubase video tutorials, you also need an AC3 filter,  a DirectShow filter, free download from the net."
,dmsigala,2007-08-20T07:09Z,"Monnie,
I used Nero to burn a UDF image. Also setup DIVx player, downloaded AC3 Filter and Direct Show filter, I still cannot get it to play, I started to get Audio but it was all garbled, other DivX movies play fine> any suggestions. I see the tutorial file folders and reason, also cubase setup, is there some other direct show filter
or a specific one you recommend, I am trying to play from my PC.

,Emm.,2007-09-11T21:21Z,"maybe this is basic knowledge, but I have no such thing so I need help. download works fine but when I try to start Cubase I get this: 
""Application 'Cubase SX 3.x' has caused the following error: 
 No eLicenser connected.""
I guess this has something to do with security and would work if I had bought the program? should I download some Syncrosoft thingy? I tried that but I need a activation key? I'm just confused and I'd really appriciate some help :)"
,ashourbarkho,2007-10-02T07:34Z,"hey umm, is this vids only or is is it cubase sx3 as well?

and if it is sx3, is it h2o or the full sx3?"
,themanpirat,2007-11-03T17:18Z,Seed please!
,dauut,2008-01-12T13:49Z,The files does not got any sounds for me... i can watch the video without sound. how to get the sound? help me please
,monnie110,2008-01-17T20:47Z,"Sorry I haven't been on here lately. This had a ton of seeders before once it started going. 

Make sure you read the info people.

PC: Make sure you have DivX codec.
DVD Player: Make sure your DVD player also plays DivX.

ATTENTION TO THOSE WHO GET NO SOUND.
If you get no sound and you are trying to play it on your PC then you might not have the latest DivX version. "
,DARK X,2008-08-26T01:24Z,"Hi everyone. I have a problem with first 36 films in CSX Tutorial 3 folder and complete Reason folder. When extracted, they won't play. It's strange cause films from CSX Tutorial 1 and CSX Tutorial 2 and a second half of films from CSX Tutorial 3 play just fine. Did someone else have this problem? Pardon my poor english."
,twister86,2008-11-01T17:10Z,You might need the ac3 sound codec to hear sound?
,denber94,2009-01-27T17:10Z,"i have a problem. i have installed cubase but can't start it. this comes up when i trying to start it. Application 'Cubase SX 3.x' has caused the following error:

Please help me! sorry about my english"
,piratebayer1,2009-04-19T23:50Z,"For those of you having problem with the audio on the cubase videos:
The audio is running really fast or really slow depending on the player. This is because the audio is out of synch with the video. The audio was not encoded correctly when compression was done. There is a free program called virtualdubmod that you can google and get here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=65889&package_id=63653&release_id=352709. 
I can play the video in that. An error message will come up when you load the video into stating that it has detected an improper VBR (variable bit rate) audio encoding in the source AVE file (audio stream 1).  Just select yes to rewriting the header and you can watch it. I will pull separate the audio from the video fix it and remarry them. When I do this and have the steps to do this I will come back and post and let you all know what to do step by step to fix.
I am not the uploader. Just a downloader that thought I would help out those not in the know of audio/video synch problems. "
,piratebayer1,2009-04-20T09:55Z,"Okay, I'm back. I just fixed and tested a file in the Cubase SX3 and it works fine. It plays fine in Windows Media Player 11, Media Player Classic 6.4.9.1, DivX player for Windows version 7 and with Nero ShowTime 3.10.1.0 that comes in Nero 7 Ultra Edition. 

Here's what to do:
First, go here and download virtualDUB, not the virtualdubmod I stated earlier. It is a free tool. I suggest selecting the last known stable version of 1.8.8 32 bit version if you have Windows on a 32 bit platform. 
http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net/

Next do these steps:
-Decompress audio within the AVI file
1. Load your DivX/AVI file into VirtualDUB. You can just drag the file into the interface itself or use the file menu option to select it.
2. From the ""Video"" menu, select ""Direct Stream Copy"".
3. From the ""Audio"" menu, select ""Full Processing Mode"".
4. From the ""Audio"" menu, select ""Compression"" and choose ""No Compression (PCM)"".
5. Save the AVI file - your new AVI file should have non-compressed audio. The problem with this is that the AVI file can get really big, and may exceed the 2 GB AVI file size barrier - in this case, you should extract the audio of the AVI file to a WAV file instead (If needed see below). 


-Extract the audio of the AVI file to a WAV file
1. Load your DivX/AVI file into VirtualDub.
2. From the ""Audio"" menu, select ""Full Processing Mode"".
3. From the ""Audio"" menu, select ""Compression"" and choose ""No Compression (PCM)"".
4. From the ""File"" menu, select ""Save WAV"". "
