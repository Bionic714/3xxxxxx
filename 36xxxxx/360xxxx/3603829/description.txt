                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Cubase.SX.v3.1.1.944-H2O.with.ED.SX3.Video.Tutorials-DELiRiUM.DVDr.UNOX
 *PROPELLERHEAD.PRODUCING.MUSIC.WITH.REASON-RORiSO = Reason Tutorial Vids

INTRO: 
 I saw how great the Cubase SX3 PC DVD Tutorial Video release was but I wanted 
 to be able to watch them on my home DVD/DivX player. So I encoded all the 
 videos to DivX. Then I figured I would throw in the Reason ones also, so I 
 re-encoded those too. Flash .MOV Videos were not converted but I did leave them
 inside the folder in case people wanted to view them on their PC. I had to 
 shorten some file names because I found out the disc would not play in my home 
 DVD/DivX player if it had any files with long  filenames. It took me 2 
 Lightscribe DVDs & 3 CDR coasters to figure this out. I decided to release this 
 repacked to share with others who  would like the  same. Please seed. Don't 
 just be a greedy leacher please. You  wouldn't have  this if someone didn't 
 share it with you so you should do the same. :)

CREDITS:
Credit goes to all the original release groups. (Check filenames above) I did not 
pull out the NFOs. If it doesn't have an NFO it didn't have one and that's how I 
got it. The only credit to me is listed below.

 *Repacked
 *Custom Disc Covers. JPEG & Lightscribe Version (PSD & PNG included)
 *Re-Encoded Video Files
 *Re-Organised Renamed files so they play in order on Home DVD/DivX Player

DVD / DivX Player: 
You must have a DVD Player that plays DivX Videos. You can buy one inexpensively 
for $30-70. You can get a really good one that plays DVD/DVDR/VCD/SVCD/JPEG/DivX 
for $50 at Wallmart. Or of course you can play them on your PC using a player 
with DivX Codec. 

ISO USAGE & BURNING INSTRUCTIONS:
Burn using an ISO burning program such as Nero. Or unpack using ISOBuster, 
WinRAR, or Daemon Tools. (All included in the "Covers and Extras" folder)

COVER:
JPG cover - just use a CD Cover App.
Lightscribe - Print using Nero Cover Designer with Lightscribe update installed
or another Lightscribe compatible cover program. (Print using best contrast)
