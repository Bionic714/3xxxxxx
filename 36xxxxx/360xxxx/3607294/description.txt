Joe Trippi - political revolutionary and Media Consultant for Nova M Radio - will join us tonight for a chat about the future of Internet radio broadcasts and a peek at the 2008 elections.

As you remember, Joe revolutionized electoral politics in America with his forward-thinking management of Howard Dean?s 2004 presidential campaign, raising over $40 million in small donor contributions over the internet. 

And we'll check in with Congress' efforts to stop Bush's escalation of the war in Iraq and coming unprovoked attack on Iran. Plus the minimum wage bill FINALLY gets a debate in the Senate. Oh yeah, and the Libby trial. And Cheney's NEWSWEEK interview. 

Join the Fun and Frivolity 800-989-1480!
