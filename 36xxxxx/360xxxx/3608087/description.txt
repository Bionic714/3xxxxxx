Programme 2 (York Grand Opera House):

Ross Noble finds York teeming with race-goers dressed to the nines, ponders on an unusual use for a shoehorn, the city's famous Minster and futuristic buses, and wonders why so many of its inhabitants wear ancient costume.

He also reveals that Arkwright from Open All Hours could have been a Hare Krishna devotee, gets nostalgic for his auntie's mutant biscuits, and even finds the time to set up an impromptu car pool scheme to get audience members home.
