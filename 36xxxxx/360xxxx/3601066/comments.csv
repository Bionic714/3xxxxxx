,zorki6,2007-03-25T07:30Z,"This file could be much smaller... it contains the unpacked game, another .rar archive, and a split floppy archive.  The rar archive inside the big one is all that you need (under 10 megabytes).

But it works at least... just a bit messy with all the extra files."

,whistler_chavez,2009-11-13T15:54Z,"Guys, take it easy.

Try to download these two files, and just copy-paste, like you do with the crack.
It works with me, and I had hard time finding the solution.

I am glad if I helped you. Let me know, please.

Cheers !
