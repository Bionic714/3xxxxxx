(This release should have its proper category, which isn't music nor audio books)

This CD contains historical recordings of Allen Ginsberg reading some of his most famous poems: 'Howl' among them. 
Before some of you say "boring", give Ginsberg a chance, since other than being a great poet he was one of the finest poetry readers that ever lived.
His tone is so musical you'll have no problems to learn passages from his poetry if you only listen to this record a few times.

More interesting, a while ago I had found with emule a version of Ginsberg reading 'America' where someone -with great intuition- had added as a soundtrack 'closing time' by Tom Waits. Following this intuition I present to you along with the original album a selection of the same poems with soundtracks in the background (the Waits/Ginsberg combination is also included).
This may sound lame, but please give it a try because the results are sometimes really unexpected and inspiring.
