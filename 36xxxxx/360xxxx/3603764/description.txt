Pioneer?s new DJ software was designed for professional and amateur DJs to enable full-scale DJ play on a PC. The software offers the same playability and functionality as the company?s Pro DJ products, using a PC instead of two CDJ turntables and a DJ mixer.
The DJS software also has a ripping function for converting CD, line input signals and wave files to .mp3.

The graphic user interface is intuitive and easy to understand. It follows the same ergonomic design used in all Pioneer CDJ products and mixers. The display shows everything a professional DJ needs to see, including: time, BPM, mixer controls, jog dial, hot cue buttons, etc.

The DJ can assign basic functions to a particular key on the PC keyboard. By doing this for frequently used functions, the DJ can establish his or her own playing style ? on a keyboard. In addition, the sync feature automatically beat matches the cued track to the track that is playing and a powerful effects program mimics the effector features of the DJM600.
