I'm having the same problem. Also, when I run the crack, it says it cannot find DJRes.dll and reinstalling might help. I reinstalled it with no luck. I also looked in the program folder and found DJRes.dll, so I have no idea why it won't work. Has anyone successfully installed and used this app? If so, please post your tecnique."
