,zman9,2007-01-21T06:50Z,"I find it hilarious that you would even consider opening this in an editor. This is more useful if it's read by some program to act on it. Looking for some light reading?

Haven't downloaded the file myself, and I won't."
,ayeeeeeeee,2007-01-21T14:58Z,ENJOY!
,saggeklumpen,2007-01-21T15:50Z,"This seems to be some kind of joke.
Don't download it.
