Does someone know how to see this kind of files?"
,sueQ,2007-01-26T22:13Z,"Use an ""unpack"" programme called Winrar. You can find it with google and dl. After you install Winrar, you dobbleclick on one of the 20 files, and when winrar has opened, you simpley drag the file to where you want it on your pc, and it will unrap there. "
