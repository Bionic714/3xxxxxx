There used to be a guide readily available that showed you how to make perfect rips but the link's down: http://calonet.org/eac

Thanks and will be uploading more of her albums?"

Also, I found out about the correct read offset later on... but I've since switched to Linux, and now I use K3b for ripping... does anyone know how to do read offsets in any application in Linux?"
