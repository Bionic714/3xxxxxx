,geezad,2007-02-07T18:40Z,Only part 3 of 3.  There are 3 files but first 2 are bullshit adverts.
,BlockFive,2007-02-08T21:37Z,"Geezad's statement is completely false, as I'm sure others will attest to.  There is a 1-page advertisement at the beginning of the first two parts.  If you take the time to scroll down past it, you will find the complete comic.  I wish people would think/not be stupid before posting their bullshit comments."
,Shalimar,2007-02-19T18:20Z,"1st 2 contain spam..  here is a copy of them de-spammed & optimized for those wanting such:

,hammockmk,2007-10-11T13:29Z,JUNK ONLY PART 3 IS LEGIT!   
,BlockFive,2007-10-13T05:02Z,"hammockmk--

A small advert at the beginning of a comic does not make it ""JUNK"".

2984 downloads and pretty much the only people that comment are assholes who don't know how to use the page down key."
,mossadek,2007-12-28T15:15Z,"Can confirm the ads only amount to a single page at the start of parts 1 & 2 page followed respectively by 26 & 25 actual pages. Part 3 has no advert & contains 26 pages. Not sure this helps really, not least because it took me longer to check & write than to dl the thing. 
If nothing else maybe it's a thanks to BlockFive.

[T],CaptOmerta,2008-11-25T05:36Z,"Dude, the same type of people sit and spam other peoples torrents with all sorts of foul words, which usually are correct 10% of the time.
These people 100% of the time never share, click their name."
,dylantho,2009-07-26T00:54Z,"Wow didn't expect to find this, Thanks."

,j1nxy06,2011-01-07T20:58Z,"finished in less than 5 minutes :D
