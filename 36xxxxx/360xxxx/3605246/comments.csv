,mrjujuman,2007-01-28T20:15Z,This is NOT Griffin's new album...the songs are from her 2002 release 1000 KISSES.  
,SoulShakinTex,2007-01-29T05:40Z,"The man is right. Great artist, highly anticipated album, but this is NOT it! These songs seem to come from several earlier albums like ""Impossible Dream"", ""1000 kisses"", ""Living With Ghosts"" and ""Flaming Red""."
