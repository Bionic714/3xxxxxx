,ps108975,2007-01-21T10:20Z,"No, it's still seeding but slowly. I think I have the worst ISP in the world. One minute it's uploading at 60 kB/s, the next at 3kBs.
The country I live in only has one ISP, since they have the monopoly they don't care about standards or service. I will keep on seeding, don't worry."
