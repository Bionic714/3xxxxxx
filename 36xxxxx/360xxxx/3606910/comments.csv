,DeadGame,2007-02-04T18:51Z,"you have to rename every single file and add an""r"" in place of the first 0 after the dot .r01 instead of .001

to much hassle and not worth the download and time to fix."

????"
,beelegal,2007-03-15T20:35Z,"This looks like a HJsplit file but it is not. You need to expand it using stuffit expander (even though the extension does not suggest it). Use ""open as"" and then select stuffit expander (I am sure that other expanders will work too, but I have not tried them).

NOTE: you do not need to rename the files as "".r01"" "".ro2"" as it has been suggested on another site. Just begin the expansion with the "".001"" file in each case and you will get an avi file for each CD.

Enjoy!"
