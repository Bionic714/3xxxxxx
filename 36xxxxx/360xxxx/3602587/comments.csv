,ntmurphy,2007-05-30T18:21Z,"Can someone seed an ISO for the Hindi language pack?  For some reason when i create my own, rosetta stone won't recognize them... "
,Gn2me,2007-08-06T22:47Z,"Is there something wrong with this iso?  I can mount the german one but this one just asks what i want todo with it.  play/open file, etc."
,thanatopsisx,2007-08-20T00:51Z,"Mine doesn't work at all :( I installed the software... the only way I could do it is by extracting the files, but the software doesn't detect the burned language discs (I burned it without extracting the files. Is that the problem?) I'd appreciate anyone's help."
,Animal1000000,2007-08-30T04:42Z,"
Please edit the torrent name. It's not Latin, it's Spanish. Western Hemisphere Spanish. It's not Spanish Latin, or Latin Spanish.

Sheesh - you got to the trouble of uploading it, at least get the title right."
,Dialegilus,2007-09-05T06:05Z,I'm lost...I extracted this downloaded file only to find my folders and 3 .trs files...no image files or and type of ISO that I can mount . HelP???
,Dialegilus,2007-09-05T06:06Z,I'm lost...I extracted this downloaded file only to find many folders and 3 .trs files...no image files or any type of ISO that I can mount . HelP???
,Dialegilus,2007-09-05T19:04Z,"Ok, figured it out. This file is not LABELED as an ISO, but it worked when I burned the WINrar file directly to a CD. So if you were lost like me, DO NOT UNRAR THIS FILE! Burn using Daemon tools or CloneCD."
,arcticdonny,2007-09-21T09:16Z,"ok, I am new to the torrent stuff and I am having a hard time.  I downloaded the installer and could not burn it to a disk but I was able to rip it with winrar and install it.  I have tried everything i could think of with this one and cannot figure it out.  can someone break it down for me PLEASE."
,Zekk1234,2007-11-05T19:44Z,Seed please!!
,bellagitana,2007-11-13T02:28Z,"Animal1000000:
It says Latin because it is Spanish used in Latin America as supposed to Spain, and that is how Rosetta Stone named it, sheesh."
,S0iLw0Rk,2008-01-06T00:34Z,"Works fantastic.  Thank you and everyone who seeds.

Download ""PowerISO"" if you are having problems burning it to a disc.  "

,morrison0880,2008-10-30T21:51Z,"Hey all. Go to 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3865583/Rosetta_Stone_Ultimate_Language_Disk_v2.iso
You get every language in an iso file. No Extracting, all you have to do is burn it to a disc with PowerISO or Alcohol and it autostarts when you load it. You can also mount it to your virtual drive. It comes with all the help files, language sheets, and even a bonus language program. Works perfectly. I got this about a year ago and I love it.
Oh, and only 3.62 GB, so it fits perfectly on a DVD, or takes up as little space on your HD as possible. Trust me, this is the easiest way to go. I tried torrents like this, and the set up and installation alone was the biggest pain in the a...With this, no installation is needed.

The file is in ISO format. You don't have to install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E]. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new (E) drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go."
,slow_down_man,2008-12-29T06:10Z,"hey ive noticed its a difference between a v2 latin spanish 3 and a v3 latin spanish 3.
