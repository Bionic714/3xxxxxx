This is not unrelated to the torrent, because, if you let the people in power do as they want and cover up the truth behind every criminal act they commit, you won't be able upload torrents in the near future, and you won't have any freedom of speech on the internet or anywhere else for that matter.

Please wake up and wake other people up too!"

Same as this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3508355/Gladiator[Extended.Edition]DvDrip.AC3[Eng]-aXXo

That one has 105 Seeders, so you'll probably want to use that torrent instead.
