,Tiggerdude,2007-01-29T19:17Z,For some reason this is downloading as a file folder rather than a video clip.  I've used this torrent before.  Anyone know why it's not downloading as video file?  Thx.
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-01-29T20:20Z,"It is a set of RAR files. Use something like WinRAR to unpack and create the avi file. 
OK quality, thanks for the seed! 
When I write this the TPB counters says S/L 2/2, the torrent has over 1000 seeds and over 1000 peers... I downloaded in less than half an hour. Seeding ! :-)"
,Galaktus,2007-01-29T20:33Z,"Thanks for this one!

,4B54L0M,2007-01-30T03:22Z,"It's episode 312 according to BSG, but for some reason when people post here, they called the double season-opener episodes 3-01 and 3-02, which is incorrect.  If you need episodes 1-10 (including double season-opener), I posted it about 2 weeks ago."

Yes, the production codes for the two part episodes such as the seaon opener are 301 and 302.

However the given convention is to lable the second episode of a season as 3x02. I think overall this is less misleading and easyer to understand than saying, 301- part one, and 301-part two."
