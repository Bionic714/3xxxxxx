,makstake,2007-04-12T16:05Z,"Quote from Robb Flynns online diary:
""And to have the biggest 1st-week sales / highest chartings in the history of the friggin' band... in every country throughout the world... with no video being aired... no ""single"" at radio... on our 6th friggin' album... which opens with a friggin' 10 1/2 minute song?!?! ""

The album was leaked to the internet two months before release date... In their case, one hell of a publicity stunt - a grass root level one. Download, give it a spin, love it, buy it. Thats what I did, and obviously so did many others.

I guess file sharing works in a positive way for real music. Maybe not for Britney and the likes of her."
