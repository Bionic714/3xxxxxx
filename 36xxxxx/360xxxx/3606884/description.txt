This is an audience recording of a show from John Foxx's 1983 'Golden Section' tour.  This particular show is the 7th December show in Rome.  

I take absolutely no credit for this torrent.  All kudos and credit goes to Bluevision who originally seeded this torrent on Dimeadozen.  Unfortunately that torrent site is closed to new members at the moment so I am posting it here so that some friends (and others) can access it.  The show is in .flac format.

Please do not trade this show and please do not convert it to a compressed format.
