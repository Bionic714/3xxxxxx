 Notes  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Contains 2 LPs on 1 CD. The J. Geils Band: J. Geils (guitar); Seth Justman (vocals, keyboards); Stephen Jo Bladd (vocals, percussion); Peter Wolf (vocals); Magic Dick (harmonica); Danny Klein (bass). Producers: Allan Blazek, Bill Szymczyk, The J. Geils Band. Recorded live at The Boston Garden, Boston, Massachusettes on November 15, 1975 and at Cobo Hall, Detroit, Michigan on November 19, 1975. Originally released on Atlantic (2-507). Includes liner notes by Jeff Tamarkin. This is part of Rhino Records' "Atlantic Remasters" Series. Though the J. Geils Band issued a steady stream of solid R&B-infused rock records in the '70s, it always seemed that the group was better suited for raging on the concert stage than being ensconced in a cushy recording studio. Their first live album, 1972's LIVE FULL HOUSE, proved this, and remains one of the band's strongest recordings from beginning to end. It was only a matter of time until J. Geils issued a follow-up, 1976's appropriately titled BLOW YOUR FACE OUT. Every drop of the group's in-concert energy is captured splendidly throughout, especially on such standout cuts as a fantastic rendition of their early hit "Musta Got Lost," the red hot album/concert opener "Southside Shuffle," and of course the fun-filled anthem, "Houseparty." BLOW YOUR FACE OUT remains one of the great rock and party albums of the '70s.
