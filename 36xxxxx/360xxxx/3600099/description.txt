I went to Budapest on vacation a while ago - the city is amazing - and came back with a bunch of Hungarian folk CDs that a guy suggested me to get  in a music shop.
The content of this package (5 albums from 5 different artists/bands) ranges from the virtuoso violinist to the pop-folk  band to the ethnic group etc. We are talking about great (I mean GREAT) musicians and thrilling atmospheres. 
This distribution isn\\\'t intended to damage these artists (obviously) but to give them some popularity outside Hungary, because they really deserve it.
As certainly others that aren\\\'t present in this pack do.
