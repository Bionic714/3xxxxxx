,DrMaybe27,2007-09-12T03:45Z,"the files are under bin\release 
copy them into the main screen, then copy the .exe from Razor1911 to the main screen and delete the other .exe and it should work. 

o! and don't forget the crack is NAS3-DEC2-BYJ5-CUJ6-8385"
,rgoadamas,2008-01-01T13:19Z,"after installing, click on the virtual cd and browse it, there you can find the razor1911 folder, open 1911 folder and copy the crack icon and replace the homeworld icon in the bin\realese file with your crack. that's how it works.  "
,paxorius,2008-02-14T20:31Z,"For those of you using Windows Vista -- this game may not start or run if you don't disable the default Data Execution Prevention setting in Vista.  You must open an administrative command line (type CMD.EXE is the start box and right-click on it at the top of the window to ""Run As Administrator"".)
Then, type the following command in the black DOS box:
bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx Always Off

After a few seconds you should get a msg saying ""command executed successfully"".  Now you can install, start & run HW2 on Vista."
,paxorius,2008-02-14T20:33Z,"RE: a typo in my above comment --
the AlwaysOff should be typed as one word -- not two."
