,Kanuck88,2008-01-15T04:43Z,Keygen doesn't work. OmniPeek requires authorization from Wildpacket homepage. Anyone have any working keys?! Thanks.
,ctoomuch,2008-01-30T08:25Z,"Keygen works fine, pay attention when installing. Activate manually, not over the internet."
,equinox2355,2008-02-22T21:59Z,"Installed fine, I just need to get a card compatible with the program. Like it was stated before, read the nfo file, you do manual activation!"
