* You create an account here. 
* You find the tracker URL - at TPB, it's http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce 
* You open your bittorrent software and choose File -> New (or whatever it says in the menu)
* You select the file you want to torrent, and a location for the torrent file to be saved.
* You give it the tracker URL (these two steps might be in a different order)
* The torrent file is created and saved where you specified earlier
* Log onto TPB
* Select ""upload torrent"" from the bottom page menu
* Browse to the torrent file you've just created
* Leave your torrent software open and seeding until at least 100% is uploaded, and a bit more is often better."
