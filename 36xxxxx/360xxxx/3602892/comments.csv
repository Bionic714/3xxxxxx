Good video quality BUT

I cant get the sound to work.
I have tried all sound codecs and players like
GOM Player
Media Player Classis
Media Player 11 (in Vista)
VLC media player 

Have downloaded sound codec like
AC3
MP4
XP codec Pack 2.06 and all other fucking codecs for sound but it still dont work.

Im running Windows Vista Ultimate.

NEED HELP TO GET IT TO WORK!!!!!"

@ spank
thanks a lot man!
what are your other movies?

@Biohazz
the first half minute of the movie does not have sound so you just have to wait and let the movie play.

You have to download a bittorrentclient to get it to work.
Click ""how do I download"" on the startingpage and follow the instructions"
