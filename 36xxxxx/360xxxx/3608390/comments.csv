,tylerthedruid,2007-05-06T03:36Z,"Hey morons it's a spanish movie with imbedded subtitles in english. This release was intended for the english speaking audience (and no, not dubbed, thank god)"
,nerverios,2007-05-11T02:27Z,"just wait for the english spoken, its playing now so shouldnt be long..."
,smartguywithabeard,2007-05-20T05:35Z,"Ok, i was going to dl this because it says here in the description that the ""Spoken language(s):"" is ""English.""
But, by the comments, appearently not...
I'll look for the dubbed version.
(Sorry, I'm too lazy to read subs.)"

,sn3owy,2007-11-03T01:44Z,"look you fuckwits,this is a spanish language film with english subs.  thats it. end of discussion. if english is your first language but you are unable to read it, then maybe this isn't the film for you.
it would be wasted on you anyway!!!!??????!!"
,fixed92,2007-11-26T04:39Z,there are no english subs to read. if im wrong let me know but ive used every different player i have and i enabled subs on each one with no success.
,darly,2007-12-13T19:56Z,"fixed92-
Just started downloading, so I can't be sure yet. However, it looks like there is no sub file in this torrent, so you need to download the 550kb SUBFiX file with a separate torrent. It was uploaded 2 hours after the movie. i.e. download Pans.Labyrinth.DVDRip.SUBFiX.XviD-PosTX

with that said, there are no peers to download the subfix file from. what the f**k?"
,darly,2007-12-13T20:06Z,"I see. Get the subs from

,ottoptr,2010-01-13T01:50Z,"I'm confused. From some comments, it seems there are hardcoded english subs. Is this true? I really hope not."
,honunet,2010-05-23T11:35Z,"Hey sn3owy, listen cumguzzler. Nearly ALL movies, television shows, or production in general is in E.N.G.L.I.S.H.  So we have not grown up like you, squinting at every screen we see like a blind monkey trying to read the hurried translation into your vulgar language.  

When the world center of filmmaking and television moves to your dung heap of a country, then you can turn your nose up at everyone who does not like to read subtitles.

But until that happens, and you see someone from a civilized country complaining he does not like subtitles, do yourself a favor and shut the fuck up..

That is all"
,redched,2010-08-20T15:50Z,resolution???
