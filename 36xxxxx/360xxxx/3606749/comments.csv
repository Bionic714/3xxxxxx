Thanks"
,Kakaru,2007-01-30T20:15Z,"h264 is a new codec, for high definition.
480p is the smallest of the 3 hd sizes.
mkv means matroska video and is the name of the file container."
,backups,2007-01-31T01:46Z,What about audio quality?
,backups,2007-01-31T09:42Z,"Well i dont know if it is just me but this release has no audio, i have all the codecs installed and never had a problem with AC3 or MKV files, already downloaded 2 releases whit mono audio and now this with no audio at all, anyone experience the same?

By the way video quality is good but presents strong pixelation on some scenes, ""HOHO"" release has better video quality just too bad that has mono audio."

,Surekuk,2007-02-01T22:13Z,"The audio is encoded in Ogg vorbis. And i suspect that the ""strong pixelation"" might be the computer not being up to snuff when decoding the stream. Don't know if it's the same for you, but i've seen it appear randomly in other 264 releases. (i.e, not the same place each time)"
,backups,2007-02-02T04:05Z,"Thanx Surekuk can you tellme wath kind of audio this release has? is it dolby prologic or mono as the other releases, i dont want to install another codec on the htpc just because of this release if it has no good quality audio at all, i think the pixelation is from the compression itself because i get none when play 480p, 720p o 1080 high bitrate video."
,ga82,2007-02-20T02:04Z,"Playback issues? Install CCCP and use Media Player Classic that comes with it. It just works. No more sound/video issues!!

As for pixelation (actually, loss of detail since h264 smooths it), yeah I know. In the scenes with the snow fall. They are hard scenes. Especially at this high resolution.

Some ppl mentioned that audio lacks a lot of bass. Maybe they are true. But still not bad for a casual watch."
,Flopis,2007-02-25T02:09Z,"Well, I downloaded CCCP, installed it, an used Media Player Classic that came with it, but still no sound!!

What else do I have to do to get sound?"
,Flopis,2007-02-25T02:32Z,Got it to work... Looks good! Thanks!
