,drik,2007-01-22T19:09Z,pls seed this as long as possible as i`m not always online... thanx.
,Alexoffilth,2007-02-25T13:03Z,will it work probably on Nokia N73 ?
,drik,2007-04-03T19:52Z,i think some of them will do but the chances are the games` resolution is too small for the n73 screen (that`s 240x320)
,fredde910521,2007-05-25T18:45Z,will this work on my nokia 6270???plz want answer
,tee_m,2007-07-12T01:29Z,"i've changed some games resolution to my n80 by adding these 2 lines to the end of the manifest.mf (file is in .jar)

Nokia-MIDlet-Original-Display-Size: 176 ,208 
Nokia-MIDlet-Target-Display-Size: 352 ,416 

 352 x 416 is n80 resolution could maybe be changed to 320 x 240 as well"
