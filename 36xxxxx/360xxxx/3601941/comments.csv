,Harry Q Hammer,2008-02-24T06:44Z,"This is a complete rip of all 80+ episodes of Lost in Space, and I don't know of any better megapack available.

The trouble is, the imbecile who did the ripping set ""fixed file size"" instead of ""fixed bit rate"" for the avi encoding. So even though each episode is around 51 minutes duration, the file size was fixed at 175MB (the correct fixed file size setting for around 22 minutes duration).  Consequently, the video quality is fairly poor, but watchable.

Therefore, if anyone knows of another Lost in Space megapack of roughly 32GB size (double the size of this pack), please post the details here.

Thanks,

HQH.
