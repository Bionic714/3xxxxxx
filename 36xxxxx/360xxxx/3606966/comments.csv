,zalle_swe,2007-02-01T09:29Z,"hello, i uploaded the torrent with my friends acc.

,the_bhe,2007-02-04T16:13Z,Seeda dåå!
,kaluser,2007-02-05T22:47Z,We need seeds!!!
,jazriel,2007-02-08T09:14Z,"Actually, He needs to superseed at this point, because if he finishes the seed, it should cascade because 55 leechers are at about 98%. Eitherway, once he hit's 100% with 1, it will cascade. Probably would have been quicker with super seeding, since it basically focuses on 1 leecher at a time. Yet, as long as it get's done, I'm not complaining. Thanks for seeding it."
,mrtt,2007-02-08T19:00Z,"Stuck at 99.9% like many others. =(

Hope it gets to 100% very very soon.
Thx for the game."
,zalle_swe,2007-02-08T19:14Z,"i have started my superseed, so im only seeding to 1 person at the time, hope this helps

Zalle"
,zalle_swe,2007-02-08T19:16Z,"actually, i don't play this game anymore, its scary!"
,zalle_swe,2007-02-08T19:21Z,"i have detected a bug with the superseeding, sometimes the upload speed reduces greatly and if this will continue i will stop superseed and start with the standard, i am sorry for all the inconvenience i have caused.

Zalle"
,mrtt,2007-02-08T19:42Z,"Det är lungt, så länge du seedar och några får hem det så fixar dom/vi resten.

Jasså? Det är så bra alltså? Har bara sett bilder och filmklipp, men inget av det säger så mycket om själva spelet. Ska bli spännande.

Återigen tack och hoppas några får hem hela snart."
,zalle_swe,2007-02-08T20:04Z,"jo asså, jag vet inte värför nästan alla e på 99,9%, o de e ganska läskigt me osynliga gubbar som hoppar omkring, försökte intala mig att jag inte var rädd, fast de gick inte så bra för jag skrek nästan när en osynlig kille hoppade fram, sen har jag inte haft lust o starta spelet mer. men ja, de flyter på ochh jag hoppas de kommer inte vara några problem framöver. spelet är otroligt bra(ja om man e inte så skraj som jag) 

Mvh

,bladios,2007-02-08T23:18Z,"At 99.9% and keep redownloading piece 1075 cause of a failed hash check (according to bittornado), must have happened a few hundred times now"
,mrtt,2007-02-08T23:31Z,"You don't need the whole file. Just mount the .mdf file with deamon tools and install the game with the cd-key from above. And copy the crack.

Works fine for me. I have made this before with other torrents that refuses to download the whole 100%.

Thanks agian for the game, will try it now.
Middle of the night to, just hope I can go to sleep without nightmares then. =)"
,mrtt,2007-02-09T01:51Z,"I have tested the game now, and it works just fine.

And yes, the game is awsome. Don't forget to activate the hardware mixing in sound option if you have 5.1 surround or more. That makes it real ""fun"".

I jumped off the chair a couple of times, but that proves the game is well done. =)

A big thanks to zalle_swe for a nice release, to bad it get stuck at 99.9%, but it still works so what ever. I will seed the game a few hours a day so it's cool."
,jazriel,2007-02-09T02:13Z,"Must be a glitch. Happens, manytimes it's actually 100%, but doesn't say so..ever. I saw one along time ago stuck at 98.6% and it worked just fine. So, unless anyone states that there is an error with the program, then just assume it's at 100% at 99.9%."
,kaluser,2007-02-09T03:02Z,Everyone is stuck at 99.9% because piece 1075 out of 1075 (the last piece) fails hash check.
,mrtt,2007-02-09T03:21Z,"Yes, but it works fine without the 100%.
Just download the keygen from this link:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3608175/Crack_amp_Keygen_for_F.E.A.R[Zalle].rar

And then replace it with the one that fails from this torrent, then you have a complete .mdf file and a working keygen. Good luck!"
,zalle_swe,2007-02-09T04:42Z,"hhmmm well good thing the game works, but i think the poblem is with my router, i have googled and found thatt some routers does something wrong(i don't got much info) it's about the routers are causing the hash errors or something. Anyway, the game is awsome, but it's going to be trouble with seeding, cause i am seeding to the 99,9% all the time when others need. I have no idea how to fix this problem so i will just enjoy the game with 99,9%. i would love is someone maybe does a reseed or something sometime if the torrent dies(no seeds) but i will keep seeding for awhile.

Zalle"
,mrtt,2007-02-09T14:51Z,"The only thing that misses with the 0.01% is this part: ""lay and have fun!"" in the .nfo file."
,kliver,2007-02-09T15:38Z,"ÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅH FAST PÅ 99.9 
jobbigt + varit så ett tag nu!!"
,mrtt,2007-02-09T18:21Z,"Kliver --> Inget att oroa dig för, mounta bara .mdf filen med deamon tools och installera spelet med cdkey'n som står ovan.

Fungerar felfritt så det gör inget om du inte får hem 100%. Du kan bränna den på en DVD skiva annars om du hellre vill det.

Om du inte har Alcohol 120% så ta bort .mdf och skriv .iso istället och bränn med vilket program du vill."
,dazed_and_confused,2007-02-09T19:06Z,"hmm, jag fick bara ner den till 99.9% men jag gjorde som du sa å bytte namn till .iso, men när ja ska skriva in cd keyn så är de en omöjlighet, då ja inte kan öppna crack / keygen. De står att ett annat program använder dom, några tips?"
,dazed_and_confused,2007-02-09T19:07Z,"nvm, fick de å funka xD"
,zalle_swe,2007-02-09T20:05Z,"dazed_and_confused- jo din BitTorrent client använder säkert dom filerna, så de e bara stänga av din client så borde det funka"
,zalle_swe,2007-02-09T20:06Z,jaha du fick de o funka
,trike007,2007-02-09T20:38Z,"Please seed!

Thanks!"
,mrtt,2007-02-09T20:53Z,"I have done a new one of this. It is a .iso file and crack/keygen directory is included in the .iso file.

Jag har gjort en ny torrent av denna. Det är en .iso fil och den innehåller mapparna crack och keygen i .iso filen.

,kliver,2007-02-09T21:52Z,okej tack mrtt =)
,kliver,2007-02-09T22:52Z,"smart att den filen som ska in i deamon tools inte visas automatiskt, jag fick damp när de inte gick först , var tvungen å välja all files :P"
,jockeeee,2007-02-10T00:20Z,"Please seed, i will seed, 24hour if someone will seed."
,jazriel,2007-02-10T09:17Z,"What an pain! Yeah, the torrent is stuck at 99.9% people. I tried to burn with alcohol 120 and it won't burn since the mdf file is what is incomplete. It appears the only way to do it is mount it on damon tools according to one person.. Not fond of that method. May try to go for the iso. "
,Wisoo,2007-02-10T12:25Z,"Could someone please seed this file, been stuck on 99,9% for a a fawking week now."
,kliver,2007-02-10T13:47Z,"mount FEAR DVD.mdf

,mrtt,2007-02-11T14:58Z,"Dudey ---> If you could spend one minute to read all the other posts before you complain.

Read the other posts and follow the instructions and enjoy the game."
,olzzer,2007-02-11T22:12Z,fuck stuck on 99.9 plz seed!!! if you got 100% plz plz
,zalle_swe,2007-02-13T18:42Z,"i believe that ""mrtt""  have made a new F.E.A.R torrent, so should i delete this torrent? i am going to delete the torrent in 24h if u don't come up with a   reason that i should not.

,skipimp,2007-06-04T07:30Z,Alcohol is telling me that the .mdf file is not supported.  Does it matter that I'm running the demo?
,Hobbish,2007-08-02T04:18Z,"I have the same problem, well actually i have 2.

First, the update doesn't work. It says:
""The update is only compatible with the english (US) version of F.E.A.R. Please use the correct update for the installed version of the game.""

I pressed ""ok"" and the install still said it had to restart my computer (it didn't install properly but had to do that anyway), so I thought maybe it maybe would work anyway. Well it didn't. Help!

And then i tried to install extraction point, and it said the same thing as the update said.

Please, someone that has extraction point installed, HELP! Thanks in advance

,Sabrage,2007-10-13T08:36Z,"Update tells me that I need the English version of FEAR to use it...

,Standablaze1234,2007-11-15T20:03Z,"Okay. 

It downloaded fast. Whoever was seeding thanks. 200kb/sec the whole time (Azureus)

I mounted it just fine with Daemon Tools, even though it DID get 'stuck' at 99.9%. 

It's asking me for CD key. The one provided in the torrent description is invalid.

The KeyGen doesnt work, it opens up a black DOS window for about 1 second and then closes.




So i need a serial key. : /"
,Standablaze1234,2007-11-15T20:05Z,"Nvm last comment i'm a dumbass. The key works fine i mistook the  '5' (five) for an S (as in Skateboard)


Lol.

Okay, the torrent works great. 

I will seed this for 2 days, so get it now!

Mount the iso with DAEMON TOOLS, it didnt work for me in A120."
