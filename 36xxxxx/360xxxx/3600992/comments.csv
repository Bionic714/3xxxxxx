,SuperSpeedSeed,2007-01-22T00:53Z,"Please... take some time and watch this great documentary about 9/11 - http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6708190071483512003&q=911+Mysteries&hl=en

This is not unrelated to the torrent, because, if you let the people in power do as they want and cover up the truth behind every criminal act they commit, you won't be able upload torrents in the near future, and you won't have any freedom of speech on the internet or anywhere else for that matter.

Please wake up and wake other people up too!"
,apoptos,2007-01-22T01:45Z,sweet... thank you!
,apoptos,2007-01-22T01:46Z,(I mean thanks for the torrent)
,apoptos,2007-01-22T02:44Z,"and by the way -- ignore the ridiculous link about fucking 9-11.  If you're really interested in how the towers came down, there was an INVESTIGATION...

,netwookie,2007-04-04T09:06Z,"actually it is unrelated to the torrent because the dead kennedys rule, and that shit just sucks balls. Fuck Government, live free anyways."

,Zombster,2007-12-10T17:44Z,"Nice Bootleg collection. I already wondered how you came up with 17 Albums, because there are only 6 official records. "
,Mad Doctor,2008-05-27T00:26Z,"SuperSpeedSeed,  You do realize that that documentary has been re-written and re-edited several times because so many of the ""facts"" were proved stone cold FALSE.  but hey, what do I know, everyone is just sheep except for you, you free thinking radical, you.  Hey neo, save us from the matrix"

,Mahs,2008-08-18T00:09Z,"Gaaaaaaawd. i HATE when the names of the artist and songs are mixed up like that.. FFS..
Anyways nice job, I've got a couple of hrs of fixing the artist name and song titles.."
,rlz,2008-10-01T08:53Z,Whats the bitrate? 17 Albums @ 640 megs....
,n_p,2008-10-30T18:13Z,"Most 128-160k, terribly *incomplete albums* incl. Bedtime for Democracy and Give Me Convenience... A few nice bootlegs tho. Thanks for the effort all the same."
,n_p,2008-10-30T18:17Z,"FYI found these...
Bedtime For Democracy: thepiratebay.org/torrent/3255017
Give Me Convenience: thepiratebay.org/torrent/3255018
Thanks to vago182"
,wontgetfooledagain1,2008-12-29T06:44Z,"Some of the bootlegs caught my eye, but in the end this torrent is really sub-par. Some of the albums aren't even complete, and from what I can see (based on track length in relation to the size of each track in MB) the bit rate is shit. I'm glad I paid for all my DK remasters to have all for myself, even with all that's happened between the members.
BTW, Machine Gun in the Clown's Hand is not even a DK album. Hell, it ain't even a bootleg. It's some solo Jello Biafra thing. Dumbass.
Thanks for trying though...I guess."
,teenagefreedomfighter,2009-02-15T01:14Z,Some of the albums are organized like crap with all the info in the titles. So I hope you like reorganizing shit.
,mud279,2009-03-02T05:18Z,"Great torrent. Now where's my baseball bat, time to sodomise some 9/11 spammers..."
,JerryAttrick,2009-03-15T03:16Z,"Sorry, but this torrent is shit. Incomplete albums and some of the worst organization I've seen.

Thanks for putting it up, but next time please clean it up a little bit. :)"
,hendrix00,2009-04-01T06:49Z,"shitty organization... missing songs, some are live, most not tagged right, some with no names etc.
it would be an awesome upload if the songs were tagged right"
,quimkaos,2009-05-04T06:49Z,"only 6 official albums and most banned in the US at the time...
anyway one of the most important bands of all times"
,teenagefreedomfighter,2009-08-03T19:07Z,"Thanks for the upload!

A note to the 9-11 guys:

The conspiracy theories are far fetched and credulous.

The 9-11 Report was even more far fetched and credulous...

I'm glad we are left with the great options. lol"
,jsmit989,2009-09-06T04:17Z,911 is for fags
,gmugford10,2011-02-11T17:05Z,"thanks for the torrent man, but shitty labeling."
