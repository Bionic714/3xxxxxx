,akelarre99,2007-02-02T01:24Z,"Only seeded by me.

One full copy in the world, but don't worry, you will complete it.

But remember to seed when finish."
,MacAudio,2007-02-03T23:02Z,stuck at 63.4%... Going to take a while.. 
,akelarre99,2007-02-04T12:08Z,"Server down... Don't worry, resume as soon as possible."
,Joe1234567,2007-02-06T15:22Z,Will you finnish seeding so we all can share???
,Joe1234567,2007-02-06T15:26Z,There is no one with 100% so it will be tuff to spread this.
,akelarre99,2007-02-06T21:06Z,"Be patient.

Only one full copy. 3.62 Gb to share. Unless my server has uploaded 9Gb at maximum speed, only is available 90%.

I gonna share until many people can complete it. Don't worry.

Please, remember to share too when completed for a few days. Or you can share in other p2p networks, like edonkey.

Thanks."
,Joe1234567,2007-02-07T07:45Z,"I'll be on with it for a couple of days.
Thank you!!"
,night_flyer101,2007-02-22T12:43Z,"hi. first of all, thank you for uploading. but i have a few questions. can you give me some details about  how to burn - burning speed, all types of cd-s are working (verbatim, sony etc)? should i use nero? thanks again"
,mercurione,2007-02-23T10:53Z,Please please seed!!! thanks!
,akelarre99,2007-02-24T01:30Z,"I've burned in a Verbatim CD-R and works ok, I suppose that any CD-R is good.

And yes, .nrg are Nero image files."
,night_flyer101,2007-02-24T07:00Z,thanks a lot akelarre99
,night_flyer101,2007-02-24T07:32Z,and what burning speed did you use? thanks
,akelarre99,2007-02-26T12:09Z,"I think whatever speed would be good, but I always burned at 1x, it's only a CD and burned once."
,night_flyer101,2007-02-26T14:54Z,"hmm, thanks for the info akelarre99. i think that was my mistake. at my mercedes e270 it doesn't work. i used sony supremas silver and tdk and burned them at 4x and 8x. but nothing :| and i also tried different methods:
- first of all - simply burn image using nero 7 (recorder menu > burn compilation)
- second - change the type of the CD, from CD-ROM to XA (because i heard that this is the way it works for APS 30), mount image using daemon and drag and drop the files from the virtual cd unit into the nero window
- also tried using Alcohol 120%, burned at 4x and 8x with RAWDAO"
,akelarre99,2007-02-28T19:11Z,"Well, your problem is not the writing speed or the media used, but you should have read the info of this torrent:

Navigation System for: A-Class(>09/04), B-Class, C-Class (>04/04), CLK-Class (>06/04), M-Class (07/05), R-Class, smart forfour, Sprinter (>01/06), Vito/Viano (>04/06)

NOT FOR E-CLASS!!! E-Class (and SLK) APS 50 is another different software."

My name is Daniel and I´m from Sweden. I have a B-class and tried to run this on my aps 50, but it didn´t work. I wonder what kind of cd´s you used or what burning-program you used?

Best regards.

,pepsi1010,2007-08-07T13:23Z,"i have just download all the 6 cd's, and they all work. But i have a question:
- this is the last version of the navigation software, or there are more versions after that..? 

I have the original 4.1 version, and i don't see a big diference.

Tanks."
