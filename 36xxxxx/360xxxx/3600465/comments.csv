from somewhere:
"" 	The Newark, New Jersey, duo Dalek (made up of MC Dalek and DJ Octopus) walks the line between underground hip-hop and ambient turntablism on their 2007 release, ABANDONED LANGUAGE. MC Dalek's grim, understated delivery and apocalyptic wordplay combined with the album's seething and arrhythmic beatscapes culminates in an overwhelming air of avant-garde menace."""
