I've uploaded over twice the GB in the file, and that means lots of others have gotten it P2P. Not one other person has stuck around to seed. I'll need my bandwidth back for work soon. If others don't carry on seeding, it'll disappear. You can turn off the completed torrent, make a copy to use, and drop the torrent file back into your client to restart it, minimize and seed away in the background. Even if you don't have anything to share with the community, you can share your time and bandwidth, and pay back for the download that way."

Eat a dick and shut the fuck up.

Oh ya, and thx for the bandwidth, douche."
