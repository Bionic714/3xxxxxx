,Moogly3090,2008-02-05T10:31Z,this anime is tight but why don't they make more episodes? :S
,potbellypig39,2008-02-19T07:54Z,"Hey Animelegends! thanks a lot! but I have to say this isn't the best anime ever...I think death note is...but Elfen Lied is great....and so is serial experiments lain...in that order is my favorite. Everyone should check them out. Death note sucks in english, get the japanese with english subs. Voiceovers suck balls."
,aurturia,2008-02-26T02:43Z,"How 'bout a seed, fanboy?"
,dnb4life,2008-03-12T13:33Z,does this have english subtitles? also can someone comment on the speed of the subtitles coz the last version i got they overlapped badly and were too fast to read.

,Roland1999,2008-09-12T11:57Z,"Not the best, but decent"
,Animelegends,2008-09-30T03:34Z,"@potbellypig - We've done our very best to avoid overlapping subtitles with each other. However, there are some pretty fast-paced scenes in this anime however that may require slower-readers to pause or rewind. Even so, we're confident that most individuals can keep pace with the timing."
,Animelegends,2008-09-30T03:37Z,erm.. bloody hell.. that above comment was actually directed toward dnb4life

,Insurgent84,2008-12-26T17:07Z,"Excellent video quality, and a wonderful job with the dual audio.

My only complaint was that the English subtitles didn't seem to work on my VLC Player. That's probably my fault though, I'm a newbie."
