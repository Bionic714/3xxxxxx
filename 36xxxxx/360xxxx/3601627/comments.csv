,Rajje,2007-01-27T01:43Z,"This is NOT Aperture 1.5 - it is 1.0!
And it does NOT work with the new Intel Macs. It is a PPC-version only.

For a universal version of Aperture 1.5, see http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3554574/Aperture__Universal_intel___1.5_"
,tanone,2007-01-28T18:03Z,"Right ! After slowly downloading the 2.59 Gb dmg image file I found out it is 1.0. Why the fuck the ""Bring Aperture 1.5 and the new Macs together"" comment ???"
