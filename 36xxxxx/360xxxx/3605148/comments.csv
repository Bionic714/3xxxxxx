,marko1976,2009-09-04T22:42Z,"ericv1984 you little prick! freedom of speech and all that!! The comments section was added for people to post comments, A lot of people on here arent up there own arses as much as you and need some decent genuine feedback and response. And probably dont have the time to waste downloading the stuff they dont want let alone take 5 mins out just to have a bitch about someone that isnt too sure what the copy, source or date of release was!  You obviously have to much time on your hands pathetic fucking loner. I guess you never downloaded a shit copy???   Thought so! Anything to say in future make it productive or slate the pricks that upload garbage. Not the people that are fooled by it!! "
