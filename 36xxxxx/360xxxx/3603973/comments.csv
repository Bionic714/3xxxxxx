,_Happy_,2008-05-22T22:45Z,"There is NOT a Trojan or any Viruses within this Torrent at all. All you people with so called Anti-Virus programs can't be using them properly!

Look for positive-negatives on Google.

This torrent is fine just like the rest of my torrents!!"

,Debeli_Zvezdan,2008-05-25T19:58Z,Avast didn't find anything.
,joelmanahoy,2008-05-31T06:55Z,"Fun game except the computer has a huge advantage when it comes to dice rolling. Kinda lame that it can roll 6's around 40% of the time, that was data from about 6 hours of playing. On the other hand the human player rolls 6's 18% of the time... kinda aggravating."
,toothpick2112,2008-06-08T18:14Z,"Thanks, fun fucking board game. Hopefully it transfers well to pc."

,Shebaz,2008-06-18T00:42Z,"Speed was great. Downloaded in 6 minutes.

But I don't get how I'm supposed to play this offline... I don't see where the program was installed to or anything. All it does when I open setup is install (to where, I don't know) and open WarZone. 

Help anybody?"
,Shebaz,2008-06-18T00:45Z,"Oh wait nevermind it installs to C:\Program Files\Microprose\Risk II

,joelmanahoy,2008-08-23T09:44Z,"holy fcking wow this game it unfair. having no life, i recorded the # of 6s rolled by the computer against me compared to how many 6s i rolled. after about 15 games the computer player gets 50% more 6s than the human player. still fun, but not fair"
,joelmanahoy,2008-08-24T09:49Z,"just a fyi, if youre playing a game and your computer's screensaver comes on, the game crashes, just letting yall know so you dont spend hours on a game , leave to take a dump and comeback to nothing."
,goaliedude66630,2008-09-01T00:08Z,this game is really fun its a cake walk against the comp tho!

,ctsaintgermain,2008-09-29T07:12Z,"i have vista and i cant open the files to read the instructions, any help out there."
,Cenya,2008-10-04T09:06Z,"Great game, but the Lux Delux version is easier and faster to play."
,Cenya,2008-10-04T09:08Z,"Ohh I have vista too.

All you need is WinRAR and it will automatically know the file type.  From there you just extract the first thing called ""Risk 2 - {HAPPY}.part1"" and it will automatically pick up the other rar files.  A folder will appear. go in that folder and no installation necessary, you just click RiskII and play!

BTW, no instructions were given so don't try to find them after you do this! lol"
,Blahdeblah66,2008-10-21T23:47Z,"Great torrent!!

,BlackwingDragon,2009-01-27T22:16Z,"Dude, you are a fucking idiot.
The torrent is 2 years old as of my writing.
If there was a virus in it, someone before you would have said something.
I really don't think virus scanners would fail to pick a new virus up within 666 or so days of it being coded..."

,Lolmen,2010-08-23T17:39Z,"Since I see a lot of comments on like ""how to install?!?"", here's how to.
1. You download the torrent ;)
2. Open Risk 2 {happy}.part1.rar with a program like WinRar of 7z.
3. Drag all files to your download folder (where Risk...part1.rar is in)
4. Double Click Risk.II.2006.exe, the game will now be installed. 
5. Just follow every step you see on the screen ;)

Good luck y'all"

The problem is the screens don't load in-game. i.e. when i click a button in the main menu nothing happens, but if I alt-tab to desktop and then back again the screen changes to whatever I clicked. This is really frustrating as I can't actually play. I've changed compatibility mode to xp sp2, entered the '-noavi' suffix...

If anyone has this problem/knows how to fix it I'd appreciate hearing from you. If you want to email me my email address is neroamano@yahoo.com"
