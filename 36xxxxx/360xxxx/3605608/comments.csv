,ommenkv,2012-02-18T05:11Z,"hai guys,download it.it will stuck on 97.8%. Then you copy it to some another folder(otherwise you can't seed it).change the extension to '.iso'.Then install any software like poweriso or magic disc(free soft). Then extract the HVAC_ELEC-1.iso by right clicking on the file(extract option will only come if you installed magic disc of poswer iso). Open with vlc or windows media player.simple. I am a electrical engg.Its worth watching.good one."
