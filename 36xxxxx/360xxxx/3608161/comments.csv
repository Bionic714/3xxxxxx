Just kidding - I agree, almost complete seedings realy suck.

Could SkurrePurre (I love you and all your uploads) or somebody please seed the complete torrent just for a little while, then I and bebeto9 can take over."

E slovenac,


Can somebody make one DVD-R outta two torrents, please?



Download menu, extras and subtitles from this torrent:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3606080/Romancing_the_Stone_(Robert_Zemeckis__1988)_[eng-ger-esp].3606080.TPB.torrent


Then download only the movie form this one:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3763207/Romancing_the_Stone_(1984).3763207.TPB.torrent



Use this two torrents to rebuild the DVD and make ONE, perfect, full DVD of this great movie!
Then upload it here...  :)
