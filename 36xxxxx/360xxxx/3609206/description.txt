Satan Rides the Media is a documentary by Torstein Grude, that was aired in early 1999 in Norway. As the title suggests, it deals with Satan, or that is satanism, in the media which was a huge deal at the time, due to that a bunch of churches were burnt to the ground in Norway. It tells about the satanic enviroment in Norway so to speak, dealing with black metal, and some of the people involved in the scene. But its main focus is on Varg Vikernes aka. Count Grishnack of the band Burzum, who didn't just burn down several churches, but who also murdered Ã˜ystein Aarseth of the black metal band Mayhem. Basically this documentary is about Vikernes, what he did, his trial, how it all started, and what happened to the black metal scene after that Vikernes was convicted to serve 21 years in prison.
