I don't mean to frustrate you, but the people who worked many hours getting this fine recording out don't want to see it mass distributed in MP3, as the quality is not so good.
However, the absolute best, standard, program to rip error free 192 k MP3s from wav files for your ipod is a free program called EAC (exact audio copy)

(It's also the best program to rip cds to .wavs)

When you install, make sure you set up the LAME plugin for this. And you must use the flac frontend to convert the files to WAV before you convert to MP3

If you have a mac I heard cdParanoia is the best program, but I don't know anything about it.
Anyway, it shouldn't tak you too long to convert your files.
Good luck."

,PissingInARiver,2007-02-09T00:11Z,"BTW I have heard of a couple people asking about the  few instances  of static which is most noticable on track 01 disc one. This was present in the original recording, and we did the best we could to patch it with the aud. It sounds MUCH better than it did. For those of you who are are wondering whether to download the aud. source, I have heard both. It is an excellent recording, and if you are a big fan of Patti's , you will want both to compare. "
