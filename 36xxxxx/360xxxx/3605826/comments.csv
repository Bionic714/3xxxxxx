,asc11,2007-01-29T14:03Z,"There is an annoying defect in
Hacking.Democracy.WS.PDTV.XviD-SYS.avi .

Near 7m20s, there's about 2 sec. of video repeated, and about 3 sec. of audio.
This throws the audio-video sync off.  It's a super documentary that deserves
better.  (The version streaming on / downloadable from YouTube has the same
fault.)

The residual defect in this {FIXED} version is negligible.

Plus: the audio here is CBR, not the VBR that's incompatible with the .avi
layout, but used often.

Video:XviD 624x352, 694 MB
Audio: MP3 128 kbps, CBR
Duration: 1h21m55s"
