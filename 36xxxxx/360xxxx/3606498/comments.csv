Thanx!"

I'm not sure that WinRAR supports it. 7-zip works like a charm, however.

Dude, you rock. Please, please, keep it up."
,BlackDahlia,2007-05-23T18:10Z,"RAR files usually have a .r01, .r02, etc files and then ONE -- COUNT EM -- ONE file with a .rar extension. This mess has 25 .rar files and they simply do not open. 

Anyone have any idea on how to open and extract these files? I am using ZipGenius 5.5 and it works flawlessly with properly created .rar files.

Otherwise, I am stuck with finding a correctly created file to download from another source.

Personally, I hate .rar files and do not create them regardless of the size of the file I am trying to upload."
,BlackDahlia,2007-05-23T18:25Z,"Okay! I tried this and it worked.

I clicked on File > Open and chose the .part01.rar file. I then chose the Edit > Extract all files to ... > Custom folder and chose the folder that the files are in and it extracted them all.

Renaming the files to remove all but the first .rar extension did not work so for those who are inclined to try it -- don't."
