thanks for the upload. However, quite a number of people have already downloaded your other two ""Methods"" torrents. Could you make a smaller torrent with just the missing books? I would really appreciate it!"
,red_dog3,2007-01-29T02:07Z,"Yeah, but many of us haven't.  I'd personally just settle for a few seeders.  An awful lot of people are stuck at 71.6%...."
,bilogic,2007-01-31T15:10Z,"Hi Bioly,

Can you please reseed this 300 Mb torrent. Every body seems to be stucked here around 71.7%. You will do us a great service. Thanks...
