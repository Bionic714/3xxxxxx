Film Description
----------------
Today the demand for exotic pets and the quest for rare animal parts 
used in folk medicines are all taking a visible toll on animals 
worldwide. This disturbing documentary examines both the legal and 
the illegal aspects of the multibillion dollar wildlife trade.

As a result of the multi-billion dollar trade in wildlife worldwide, 
thousands of animal species are poised on the brink of extinction. 
This disturbing documentary examines both the legal and illegal 
aspects of this trade. 

More than 20 years ago the UN Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species (CITES) was established to stop the illegal 
trade in wild animals and plants. Few countries devote the proper 
resources to enforce it. Today the demand for exotic pets, the 
whims of fashion, and the quest for rare animal parts used in folk 
medicines, are all taking a visible toll on animals worldwide.

Cultural and economic causes for the wildlife trade are examined. 
Both eastern and western attitudes towards animals, though different, 
have the same disastrous effect on wildlife. There is one success 
story, the Wildlife Forensics Lab in Ashland, Oregon. The time for 
action is now.
