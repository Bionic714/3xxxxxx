Episode One - Sea Wolves
U-boats were active from the first day of the war to the last. The menace 
provoked Winston Churchill to write, "The threat the U-boats posed in the 
Atlantic was the only thing that really frightened me during the war. On their 
defeat hung the outcome of World War II." Witness the actions of the famed Wolf 
Packs in this riveting episode.
