,blackrave123,2007-01-22T23:05Z,"The program works great and seems to be the full version with a lot of drugs included.
Haven't tried using the effects yet, though, and not sure if I'm gonna. :P"
,Linkerator,2007-01-23T02:27Z,"@ azzeria

Worked for me, taking the pot stopped my thinking for a bit :P"
,DjDarkDragon,2007-01-24T08:04Z,Anybody know if it is is supose to sound like static?
,DjDarkDragon,2007-01-24T08:08Z,"Sorry aboute the double post but after downloading the sample from idosers web site i found out that it actualy sounds like static.
That should mean that this can work."
,Chrizzy,2007-01-27T22:18Z,"What the fucK my niggaboyz in tha hood!

,winphreak,2007-01-31T03:01Z,"This program is crazy. There's something like it called Brain Wave Generator that let's you make your own sounds.

The meth got me to chew on my tongue and cheek."

,ghampus,2007-02-19T14:31Z,I love I-Doser :)
,sheenabean,2007-03-02T04:54Z,"does this work (assuming it does) while listening to headphones at the computer, doing whatever? or do you need to do it somewhere dark/quiet? "
,Yentill,2007-03-07T18:49Z,"I can't open IDoser, it says: 
Component 'COMDLG32.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid.

Can some one help me? how do I fix this?"
,sse1281,2007-03-13T00:56Z,"Wow a quick download...
And this shit acually works (try Trip 1 for full effect)"
,iKettles,2007-04-10T21:22Z,"http://www.ascentive.com/support/new/support_dll.phtml?dllname=COMDLG32.OCX
If you're missing COMDLG32.OCX then place it in your C:\Windows directory"
,MajMcMuffins,2007-05-20T18:03Z,"can someone plez tell me if there is susposed to 
static. email me @ Yamboy10@aol.com"
,MRavioli,2007-05-28T14:15Z,"I've been trying to get the I Doser program to run but each tiem it gives me the following message:

This application has failed to start because MSVBVM60.DLL was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem"
,PutBoy,2007-07-01T11:44Z,"Yes it's supposed to sound like static.

Anyway, it doesn't work. Or at least I doubt it does."
,zkr4mz3,2007-07-05T02:58Z,How tha fck do i start it?
,simandk,2007-09-26T21:18Z,"how long are you high people?

,Slappy4u,2007-10-26T20:20Z,Works if your a retard!!
,brew_daddy19,2007-11-15T03:31Z,i get the same message about the .dll file...how do u fix it?
,xelizer,2008-02-19T10:39Z,"well. if you have tried it and it dont work,, try to get a suround headsett''its required'' and just close your eyes and consentrate on the sound, and if there are anything or anyone in the room making distracting voices.. kick / bann them from the room for a while :P  happy doses ppl xD"
,minipax,2008-04-23T22:35Z,"in order for it to work you have to be in a quiet room with no distractions.
Good headphones help, and closing your eyes helps too"
,Groffse,2008-04-30T19:18Z,"how can i convert to mp3 ?
That would be great if i should LUCID =)"
,Groffse,2008-05-29T20:17Z,I hope the new QUICKHITS come soon here
,bobert-bobert,2008-06-02T08:03Z,"The 5-minute ""French Roast Coffee"" left me a little disoriented at the end, but it was probably just from the experience of hearing white noise and high-frequency tones for five minutes.

The 30-minute ""Cocaine"" did nothing for me.  It was aurally the same thing.  It had no effect.  It's kind of like listening to ambient electronic noise music!

Placebo effect, I'd say.  If white noise and modulating frequency tones are enough to pleasurably disorient you, then more power to you.  But personally, I think it's psuedoscience."
,k3d0,2008-07-03T22:03Z,Does this include doses?
,Pit-Zah,2008-07-12T04:26Z,"When I try to play a dose, It says ""Can't Open Audio Device (16-Bit Stereo, 44100Hz)"
,jonnetuominen,2008-08-06T20:49Z,"IF you read this do not download mp3 files because mp3 doesn't play all the sounds :)
but works for me cheers"
,EXTREME5000,2008-08-22T08:04Z,you might die from music OD...lol
,RM_Vee,2008-09-17T02:36Z,"If you actually went to the Idoser site, it says that this program DOES NOT work for everyone. That there are three different types of people.
1. People susceptible to bi-neural beats.
2. People originally insusceptible to the beats.
3. People immune to the beats.

Idoser doesn't work for everyone. Just because it doesn't work for YOU, does NOT mean that nobody else should give it a try.

Hugs and kisses."
,sunsun88,2008-10-25T08:43Z,Everytime I try and play one of the torrents in either this version of I-Doser or the application from the site I get some sort of error message. Is it working regularly for everyone else or is there a step I am missing somewhere?
,kid_man,2009-06-14T10:04Z,"I have the same problem. When I try to open a dose, it says ""There has been an error while loading the .drg file. Error number: 481. Error description: Invalid picture. Error source: I-doser."""
,rascals28,2010-02-27T00:20Z,is it okay to use when your 13?
,frit0,2010-03-03T20:06Z,"I realize they say these don't work for everyone, but anyone who has tried real LSD will tell you there's no way in hell a sound could replicate that feeling, especially these sounds. White noise + WHOOOOOW does not make an acid trip. If you tell people you've done LSD/Crack/Nitrous and it wasn't a big deal because you listened to these, prepare to be laughed out of the conversation by any serious druggies. Half the experience is *what you see when you open your eyes*, and with this your eyes have to remain closed.

I listened to the ""gates of hades"" track and prepared myself for a mindfuck, instead I thought about bunnies, a jet, the cast of the Simpsons... and at the end I was very calm and sleepy. Not exactly the ""hell in an mp3"" people describe it as.

Just my 2 cents."
,Crazykiid,2010-05-07T16:28Z,"Got this yesterday, and it kinda worked for me
Tried astral and it felt like my bed was shaking, then my arms lifted and fell a couple times.
Not a drug, but pretty fun anyways
Make sure you lay down in a quiet and dark place for best effect"
,Crumblezz,2010-09-12T23:44Z,"For everyone saying it's a placebo effect, ofcourse it is!
What else would it be, real chemicals in the sound files? 
Man some people are stupid."
,AllisterT,2010-11-29T09:10Z,I'm not even able to get the idoser application to initialize. Anyone else having this problem?
,qipoh587,2010-12-03T02:49Z,After downloading it what do i do to get to it and use it ???
,sllper2,2011-02-27T04:30Z,"This idoser 5htp gave me a dam boner first min of it.. 


dam it works wayy good.."
