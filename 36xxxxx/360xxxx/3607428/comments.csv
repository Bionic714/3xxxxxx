Online availability of episodes

ABC initially stated that the remaining episodes would be released on-line at ABC.com,[5] on Thursdays at 2 a.m. PST, the day after they would have been aired on television. ABC previously said that there were problems that kept the rest of the episodes from being shown online, calling them ""unforeseen music clearance issues.""[6] In addition, ABC.com removed a direct link to the Day Break section from its website. ABC.com has since reinstated the Day Break page. On January 14, 2007, the network announced that the remaining episodes would be made available ""by the end of February.""[7] ABC.com currently says that the seven episodes that aired on ABC will begin streaming online on Jan. 29, 2007 along with first three unaired episodes. The fourth unaired episode posts Feb. 5, the fifth on Feb. 11 and the sixth on Feb. 19. [2]"
