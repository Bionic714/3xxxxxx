National Geographic presents a thought provoking and
disturbing look into the world of meth users, and gives
us a shocking look into the physical and mental impacts
of the drug

Methamphetamine - meth - is considered one of the
hardest drugs to quit. This dangerous drug is ravaging
rural communities and spreading its poison to major
metropolitan areas and across international borders at an
alarming rate. What makes this drug so powerful
addictive, and destructive?

National Geographic correspondent Lisa Ling investigates
the meth epidemic to uncover the menace it poses to
society and to find out why many are calling meth the
world's most dangerous drug."
