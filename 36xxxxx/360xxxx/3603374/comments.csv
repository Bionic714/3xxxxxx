Ignore framitz, he's having a bad day. 
Seeds are an indication of how many potential threats the specific torrent poses towards your computer, so always go for the torrent with the LEAST seeds. 
Seeders are simply the people who want to infect your hard drive with this malignent content, for either personal gain or strictly for the lulz. They're like hackers on stereoids, and most of them have connections to the ethically questionable hacker community of ebaumsworld. 
It has been a rule for me to only download torrents with two seeder OR LESS as any more would be too much for any domestic firewall to handle. 
Leechers are people like me, who warn unsuspecting seed-victims of the malignent data that is often found on various bit torrent communities. We don't ask for money or gratitude, we do it because we have a calling and can not stand by while the seeders win THE GAME. "
