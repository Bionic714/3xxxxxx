,addiction10,2007-02-12T22:02Z,"Thats actually dropped now my Isp are having kittens with my high usage of there bandwidth and have restricted me, hence why it's taken until today to actually get back up and running on this one. So accept my apologies if you've been trying to get this and was stuck at 35.7%.

,hawkins08,2008-02-07T02:17Z,is this the unrated version??
,mgrguric,2008-03-04T17:11Z,"well yes sound and picture was good. (movie not so good). 
But I had a feeling this is shorter version. Like couple of scenes were missing. and I checked: running time is 90 mins but IMDB.com says 94, for canada 97 and USA 104 mins. WTF?!

final judgement: its not a keeper!"
,shadowmoose,2008-03-15T08:29Z,"Poor audio encoding causes a ""rumpling"" background noise in my headset that caused me to stop watching the movie about 1/4 of the way through.  And the quality isn't that great either."
