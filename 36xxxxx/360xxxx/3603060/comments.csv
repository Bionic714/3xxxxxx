,Opera_of_Death,2007-01-25T01:29Z,"I have watched the file now and it's not the same as the nonscene file.... It's a little better quality and there are no glitches as in the nonscene release....

But it's the same as the fake hdtv release http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3603191/Stargate.Atlantis.S03E18.HDTV.XviD so don't download that one in hope for hdtv quality....

Thanx for the upload!!! It's the best quality you can get for now!!!!!"
,Opera_of_Death,2007-01-25T13:13Z,Now there is a real hdtv release http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3603391/Stargate.Atlantis.S03E18.HDTV.XviD-MiNT
