Bow Wow is a very good Japanese hard rock band, and here in Europe is very hard to obtain their albums, so here is the one I have.

Album name is Warning From Stardust

Unfortunately it is a record rip, 128 kbps mp3

It's all just one file, because I ripped it with Nero SoundTrax who doesn't seem to detect a pause between tracks. As I usually don't do this, then I don't own any similar programs to do this. And yes, I checked the "Rip from a record" mark.

The quality is still listenable, but it's really intended only for enthusiasts.

The reason I put it here is that I, after a long search didn't find anything to download from Bow Wow, and it's a shame.

Song listing is as follows:

1. You're Mine
2. Jets
3. Clean Machine
4. Can't Get Back To You
5. Heels Of The Wind
6. Poor Man's Eden
7. 20th Century Child
8. Abnormal Weather
9. Welcome To The Monster City
10. Break Out The Trick
11. Warning From Stardust

And yes, if anyone has something from Bow Wow, regardless of quality please UPLOAD.

Have fun!
