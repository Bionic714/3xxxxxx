Matt Smith reviews yesterday's action from the Championship, including extended highlights of the feature game of the day between Leeds and WBA. Two really great goals in this game, plus the 'Dennis Wise incident', with commentary by Jon Champion and Angus Scott. 
The cameras are in Wolverhampton to cover the protest by banned Cardiff fans, and Andy Townsend goes down to Portman Road to see the 'east-anglian derby' between Ipswich and Colchester. 
All the goals from CC league 1 and 2; and some super goals here too!
Who needs Super Sunday!
