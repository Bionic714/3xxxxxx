,AssMaster,2007-02-03T01:09Z,"I hope it's alright, coz it's gonna take a lot of diskspace and a LOT of time to get...awesome movie though, would love to see it in full HD!"

Note: HDTV and HD-DVD are not the same!""

I'm pretty sure these releases by HDTV CHINA are capped from HDTV broadcast's but I noticed that he/she are now releasing torrents w/ Blu-Ray or HD-DVD in the title(further confirming what I first believed) So if your only wanting to get a official hard release-ripped HD movie those are the ones your gonna want."

,oswald1234,2007-07-01T13:14Z,use media player to play this.Ive had this a long time. The xp media player will play this.
,Bugdoctor,2007-10-03T19:08Z,"I thought I had a language problem with Ice Age 2 from HDTV CHINA, when played in VLC i could select English as the track. 

So far I have downloaded 4 films so far from this user and they all work perfectly, but setting them up to play is a real bother. I recommend Zplayer, KMplayer, VLC, windows media player 11 and classic, Haali splitter, HDTV pump, Core AVC and NVIDIA purevideo. Keep playing around with the settings and different players until you find one that works.

Also, thanks to HDTV CHINA for these quality releases!"
,bebebebe01,2007-10-09T20:28Z,"It works with zoomplayer and KM  player, you can change the audio to 5.1 DTS, BUT the frame rate is not good!! 
I have downloaded tons of 1080p movies already and this one is not  good, becuase of the frame rate, I donÂ´t think is my hardware becuase I have an intel Pentium D extreme Processor 955 , 4 GB of RAM and a 8800 GTS superclock VC, and a SATA II HD.

GL and I hope somebody else can update this info , just to double-check!"

22.17GiB?! it would certainly take a hell of a long time to finish downloading"

,WaffleS.S.,2008-09-05T04:11Z,"If you're having trouble playing H.264 1080p (frame stuttering, etc) it's probably because you're playing it with the ffmpeg H.264 decoder and you don't have a top-of-the-line CPU (even the lower-end dual cores can't handle it because ffmpeg uses a single-threaded decoding process).

If you're on Windows, get CoreAVC and use something like Media Player Classic (VLC doesn't allow external decoders so forget it).  If you're on Linux, you either have to upgrade your CPU (or possibly overclock it if you're close performance-wise) or use the hacked CoreAVC patch for Mplayer, which is a pain in the ass."

,SweRaider,2009-08-19T17:57Z,"quality was pretty bad to be hd, sure its an old movie but it aint worth that much diskspace, a ripped version would be good though"
