Works fine for me!"

,xenedar,2008-03-12T15:31Z,"This torrent is messed up. Episode 15 is really episode 12, episode 16 is really episode 13. Of course, this doesn't stop episode 12 from actually being episode 12 (ie: there are two of them).

I only need 3 episodes to complete the entire series 1; this torrent wasted my time and internet quota.

,Hammis79,2009-07-27T05:29Z,"xenedar is correct. Just check imdb or the link he/she provided. This torrent will waste your time.

And of course you need a codec for the sound. Fucking newbie ;)"

solution 1: download and install VLC player. (google it)
solution 2: download the Combined Community Codec pack (CCCP) 
Solution 3: select folder, and hit delete, then enter."
