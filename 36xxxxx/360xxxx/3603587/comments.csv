,dousch,2008-04-11T18:54Z,"Episode 08 and 11 does not work, nothing happens when you double click to extract, actully none of the files in those folders works to start at all. No action.. Just dead. The rest was great."
,Armstrong14,2008-06-12T18:49Z,DOES ANYONE HAVE THE DVDR OF THIS SHOW?
,FRACTO,2009-08-27T01:06Z,"Jesus. How can you expect people to seed your torrents when you its hundreds of useless RARs.

I mean seriously, what the fuck."
,nickgreyden,2010-01-27T08:52Z,non of the extracts working for me either
,nickgreyden,2010-01-27T09:26Z,"Ok figured it out

For WinRaR users.  

Find the zipped file that for each episode that ends with dvdrip.xvid-korp.rar and double click on it.  (most will end in a number like 00, 01, 02)

You should see a file that is a .avi   Highlight this file and click Extract To

Browse the folders and find the folder you want it extracted to and hit OK.  This should start recompiling the episode that the torrent creator decided to split up for some reason.

I knew that he had somehow zipped the files up into seperate files but was unsure how to recompile them.  This worked for me and all episodes work now.  Hope this helps."
