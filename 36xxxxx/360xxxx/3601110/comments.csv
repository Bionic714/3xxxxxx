,flyguyty89,2007-02-08T06:47Z,"I would know, I work for GS"
,Brimmstone,2007-02-11T03:06Z,"This worked great!

Does anyone know where to get the new version, tho?"
,Demorgon,2007-03-27T13:41Z,"LOL, badman my thoughts exactly, GEEK SQUAD is a joke. They are people hired for the man that think they know computers and charge outrageous prices!"
,AboveUnrefined,2007-04-09T05:35Z,"You should build your own live Windows repair disc... it's not hard, somewhat time consuming though (at least it will work indefinitely)."
,AboveUnrefined,2007-04-09T05:51Z,Forgot to add that geek squad is faggot priemo.
,chemogrizzly,2007-06-28T17:22Z,"this is pretty nice
there are better on net for free...or u could create a disc with everything u need and make it bootable
but if u wanted to do thaqt, u wouldnt download this,ty uploader. i downloaded and it does boot( not sure for how long) but remeber u can right click cd/dvd drive explore..and u can see what is in all folders and u can run  ALL  programs from there if needed.......more of these would be nice"

Major flaw there, A simple Computer-Date/Time change will fix that problem."
,pois3,2008-06-06T21:31Z,thats a bunch of crap!
,pois3,2008-06-06T21:35Z,"I have seen and had every disk you people have. Theres nothing special about it at all. As for it timing out, IT DOES NOT!"
,ar15guy,2008-10-19T03:21Z,"ok, couple of things, this MRI does say MIR4.6.0 when mounted in NEROimage. However, double clicking gives the warning, ""This version of the MIRE Core Application has expired. Please download newest version.""
Tried setting back the windows date to 2006 and it did nothing. Haven't tried adjusting the bios clock. I'm sure that would would but didn't bother since you can just right click the cd or image drive. and EXPLORE it. find what ever tools you need and use them manually.
Hope this helps.
i fix pc's too and wanted to see what was here.
Do like CHEMOGRIZZLY said and build your own. If you really need these tools then just extract them to your own boot disc and use them that way like ABOVEREFINED suggested.
Something else, this cd has JV16powertools and CCLEANER...why would anyone pay Geeksquad when they are using mostly freeware anyway!!!?!"
,ar15guy,2008-10-19T03:22Z,"oh yeah, delete the CDR extension if you use windows. I have PC and it worked, thanx CRACKINTOSH!!!"
,rbailor,2010-04-13T00:57Z,Ohhh NOOOOOOOOO THE DISK IS GOING TO EXPIRE... Fucking retard. I have one at work and its been working fine for two years.
