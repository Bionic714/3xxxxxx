Just what it says.  This is a scanned US 5th edition of Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics.  If you're too cheap to buy one of the paperback international editions, this is for you.  Don't bitch about the pages being slanted or some images being hard to make out in black and white.  Like I said, the international version is like 25 bucks, and you can even take it with you if you have an open-book exam.
