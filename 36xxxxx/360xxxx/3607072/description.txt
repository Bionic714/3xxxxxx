All 20 episodes of Squidbillies, ripped by others, collected and compressed to a common 95 MB size by me. You can download individual episodes by setting your client to ignore the ones you don't want. This IS all season 1 according to the producer's production code, corporate web site and writers' blogs. Please seed for as long as it took you to download. You can turn off your download when done, make a copy of the download for you to work with, and turn the torrent back on in your client, so you can seed in the background while still using what you've downloaded.
