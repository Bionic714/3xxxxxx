SEASON 5 first airs on: 6-13-2010 As I write this, IT HAS NOT AIRED YET... NOT even 1 EPISODE.. I PROMISE I AM RIGHT (in a few days... it was just announced on Adult Swim on june 7th 2010) The 1st Episode of season 5 will air on the 13 of june, 2010 and is named (1) - Holodeck Redneck.  This is the correct info. DO NOT TRUST anysite other then CARTOON NETWORKS or the officail SQUIDBILLIES web site. I, as an employee of 'William Street' (the producers of Adult Swim) am informing ALL of this to stop false rumors and to let the TRUE SQUIDBILLIES FANS no the TRUTH This posted comment is the ABSOLUTE CORRECT listings and titles and air dates for SQUIDBILLIES. I get this info long before it is posted on the CARTOON NETWORK website. I am providing this info as a kindness for all true die hard SQUIDBILLIES fans...Not to act like I know everything.  Thanks for reading and as long as the fans keep watching, This cartoon will keep being made... PLEASE, DO NOT use the beginning of a NEW YEAR as a mark for the beginning of a new SQUIDBILLIES SEASON. THEY almost NEVER fall on the beginning of a new year. This is why I included all the air dates for the new seasons so you, (the TPB SQUIDBILLIES FANS) can see there is no rhyme or reason to the start date of a given season. TOO many people are making assumptions about the start and end of seasons. NO offense, but the up loader: dynasoar right above in the info box, is for some unknown reason telling people that there are 20 episodes in the 1st season. It this very kind of inaccurate comments that begin a trail of false information. LASTLY, a Seasons stars ONLY once we are prepared to be able to follow through, the air date has NOTHING to do with the decision of when a new season begins. The air date is when we are prepared to release that particular season, and means NOTHING else. Thanks again all "
