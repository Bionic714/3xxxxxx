,grasueuk,2007-10-12T08:56Z,Many thanks for plugin's. I seem to be having trouble with Boris FX 8.0. I know it's a trial version but is there an unlock code to make it permanent as the code supplied does not work.... maybe  I'm doing something wrong? Anyway many thanks for the Plugin's once again.
,mbalaic,2008-02-28T10:37Z,"They won't work with FCP 6 or AE CS3 :( too bad, and it's such a good up!"
,5019,2008-03-17T03:14Z,Anyone found the new Magic bullet suite 2007? specifically instant hd and frames.
,aragorn12386,2008-09-06T00:18Z,"HELP NEEDED FOLKS!!!
I have a problem-I installed the boris continuum plugins into my Final Cut Pro 6.0.4, OS X, and then tried to open up fcp. It fucked up and said that the program was not supported on this architecture, even though it worked before I downloaded this plug in pack. If someone could help, that would be great."
,sotamurphy,2008-09-21T03:03Z,"Can anyone get a serial for Fx Factory. That one is the CREME DE LA CREME of plugins! So MUCH good stuff on it. The serial readers don't  have the latest version.

Thanks for this upload. I hope the DigiEffects works. I will comment back once it is installed. I just can't afford to pay for these after buying FCP/CS3 now 4 and so on.

:)"
,N1ZZLE,2008-11-05T22:07Z,seed please
,ComposerTY,2009-02-03T04:13Z,"Awesome torrent!! Thanks so much. I was really looking forward to using the Magic Bullet Looks that is included in the torrent but when I try to use them in FCP, it says that I need to reinstall because they are not serialized. I've tried everything and was just wondering if anyone knew how to get them to work in FCP?? Any luck? Thanks again sito!!"
,aar2697,2009-03-10T00:13Z,"Final Cut Express is now stocked up with these great plugins!  Thanks a bunch!! :)

Yes, you can install these on FCE4 (not any below version) because it uses the same architecture as Pro."
,Willyhead,2009-04-13T10:14Z,Does anyone have Final Cut Pro 2/3 that they would like to share?
,goran8000,2009-04-22T09:28Z,Works great! Thanks Sito !!
,infiniteight,2010-03-09T03:01Z,"Hi there. Just downloaded the torrent and it works swimmingly. Thanks.
For the boris plugin, it only gave me a trial version. Did I do something wrong? 
Also, come plugins are JUST for AE correct?"
