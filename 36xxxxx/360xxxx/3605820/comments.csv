,Jarven,2007-01-29T21:33Z,"Nothing wrong with the file. Use Azureus and uninstall all the other crap out on the market today.

I've downloaded American Dad, Family Guy and this episode of Simpsons, everywhere there is someone complaining about it not working. 

I'm 100% sure it does, I watched them all just a moment ago. Some people also claim them to be fake files. 

Just check for ""kollll"" when downloadning, it cannot fail."
,Jarven,2007-01-29T21:35Z,"By the way.

Thanks for the episodes kollll, excellent work.
