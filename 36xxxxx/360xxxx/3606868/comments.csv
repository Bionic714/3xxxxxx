,Alca Isilon,2007-01-30T20:19Z,the new episode for SG-1 still needs to be aired I believe
,BullyBoy88,2007-01-30T20:44Z,Seed please!!
,DrChandra,2007-01-31T13:46Z,"These are great releases. thanks
with a codecs that good it simply doesn't make sense to waste 370meg on it.
excellent"
,DrChandra,2007-01-31T14:01Z,ok I spoke too soon. the image quality is fantastic for the file size but would be easier to appreciate it the sound wasn't horribly out of sync...
,DrChandra,2007-01-31T14:10Z,"if you download a new .mkv codec then the audio is almost in sync
http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html
and ffs people. just use avi and not some crappy matroska container crap"
,sN1b,2007-02-02T04:00Z,Matroska is the best container out there. Blame yourself for having bad codecs :/.
,death734,2007-02-07T22:17Z,"mkv owns avi like x264 owns xvid
if your complaing because of compatibility then use a stinkin computer hookup. you stand alone players  still wouldn't play it even if it was avi.

x264 is also better quality in mkv then x264 in avi"
