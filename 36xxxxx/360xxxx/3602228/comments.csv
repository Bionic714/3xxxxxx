,Xlil_Mik3staX,2007-01-25T16:48Z,"very good video quality 9.5/10
but the audio is pretty bad/average, since its a R5 6/10

still enjoyable, ok movie, not too funny"
,Peter Quistgard,2007-01-26T10:23Z,The audio is terrible.Save your download limit. I'd wait for the axxo release.
,heffee,2007-01-28T19:02Z,Which release is better? This one or The Jackass?

,eylenno,2007-02-01T11:23Z,dont go to divxtitles unless you want subtitles in romanian or some other east european language! metasubs (.com) has no ads what so ever...

,Kalath,2007-02-01T21:50Z,"if you actually appreciated it, you wouldn't spam it with useless shit"
,olaxx,2007-02-02T14:15Z,is it just me or is the audio impossible to hear? or maybe i need a new codec?
,n9ty5cavalier,2007-02-03T06:23Z,"Would someone PLEASE seed ? I run my connection at 54 mbps and I'm lucky to download a movie at 100 bps.......what's the deal, people??"

,Ratmanslim,2007-02-21T22:27Z,"Why are all people so horny about axxo? Sure he/she (?) uploads alot of great stuff, but I really don't se the point in why some people sort of adore axxo. An upload which is DVDrip is always DVDrip no matter what uploader. So please stop act as such nerds and losers who only prefers certain uploaders on TPB. Please... Get a life..."
,fastshit,2007-02-25T21:36Z,Tack.
,julofucik,2007-02-27T00:49Z,axxo is working for another site...if they onetime catch you-they newer let you go.......!
,The_Pirate_Ghost,2007-03-05T08:50Z,"because axxo does it so much and hes dedicated to it. im browsing movies and all im loading is his stuff because he gets all the good props. no offence to other uploaders out there, but what do you prefer...  a 10 / 10 all the way around on all his stuff... or a 10 / 10 on some things. do you want it fast and lower quality... or do you want to wait for the high end shit.... but then again... free is free... right?"
,Tompa89a,2007-03-12T14:06Z,"erm, sure the video quality is great but i miss the sound, anyone know the name of the codec required to be able to get some sound?"
