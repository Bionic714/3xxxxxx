,free2readme,2007-05-29T23:48Z,"Hello guys,

Yea it really does suck. I am stuck at 52.5 %.


Whoever seeded is a noshow. So much for quality he promised.

However if you still want this progam I would appreciate some help. 
I actived Emule to download Quicken 2007 H and B and after I check it if it is a go I will upload it at Pbay so you can download it. 
That is when you help me out if you know how.
I don't know how can I convert an image file consisted of .bin and .cue into a torrent.

If anyone knows and is willing to help please write a comment with specific instructions.

Remember, I will upload it in case a progam is ok in the meanwhile I ask for patience because I just started downloading it.
Cheers
TineG"
