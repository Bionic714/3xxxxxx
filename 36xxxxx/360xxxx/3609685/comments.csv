[V],iggy.stooge,2007-02-03T08:16Z,Ah com on! Cant you put this up in mp3/192??
,The NbL,2007-02-03T18:17Z,Flac is just fine thankyouverymuch!
,overlydiatonic,2007-05-15T03:21Z,"FYI, since ripping this I have found out that my drive has a read offset of +6. So if you want a totally 100% exact copy of this, you can merge it all into one track, delete the first 6 samples (which are silent) from the beginning and paste them onto the end, and split it into tracks again. I doubt anyone really cares though, but thought I'd mention it just in case. (If you don't understand what I just said or why you would care, then don't worry about it... the sound quality is still perfect anyway.)

Also, since I didn't include a cue file in the torrent, here one is:
