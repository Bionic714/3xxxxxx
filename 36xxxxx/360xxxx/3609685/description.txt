A 2000 Virgin promo CD by The Smashing Pumpkins, technically untitled, but I like to call it "Waiting", as that is the name of the unreleased song on it. Ripped in cdparanoia with no errors. Encoded in the lossless Flac format -- see http://flac.sourceforge.net/ if you don't know what this means. 600 dpi scans of the booklet and tray card included.
