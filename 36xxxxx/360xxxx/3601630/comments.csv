,Dawkseed,2010-10-28T21:22Z,Every song title is for some ingenious reason multiplied. Don't download this.
,raiden395,2010-11-23T16:41Z,"Yes, every song is multiplied because, for some idiotic reason, you added the folders to whichever music player/library you have on your computer, and in the folders are .m3u files, which copy the playlist to your computer as well.

So... if you are already adding the files, and then adding the files in a playlist, guess what...

YOU ADD DOUBLE THE FILES!!!

This torrent is great, thank you xoptics.

,Luxas-kun,2011-03-22T04:04Z,"I've got one problem with this: How the hell do I get access to the files without having to open the M3U file in friggin' Windows Media Player? As in, so I can open the MP3 files directly and listen to them individually, rather than open the M3U file and have to cycle through them."
,Linknik,2011-09-21T06:13Z,Just wanted to note: This is awesome. You are awesome.
,Sandrituky,2012-01-23T19:22Z,Thanks! :D Okami soundtracks are increible! I have to download them before posible SOPA apocalypsis! (I wish not)
