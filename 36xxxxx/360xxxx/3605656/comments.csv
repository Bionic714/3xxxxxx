Please dont comment that something is good or bad till youve actually seen whatever it is your commenting on!!! DUH!!"
[T],Knaster,2007-01-29T07:52Z,"""I'm really sorry... Please disregard/delete the previous torrent and use this one instead.""

You do know you can delete your own torrents, just press the red ""x"" up on the torrent name ledge."
,Dave The Barbarian,2007-01-30T08:41Z,Has anyone actually got a copy of this? I've been trying to download it for 17.5hrs now and have only managed 4.59MB! This is regardless of the fact that the stats say 1 Seeder and 4 Leechers.
,KnightDiver,2007-01-31T00:26Z,I see I'm not the only one trying to get this dvd.  So far only have about 16MB.  Wish the seed would get it together.  If he needs help he should ask for it.  This is his second try.  He must have been able to seed for a few minutes to get out that 16MB.
,wmgan,2007-01-31T01:03Z,"I'm really sorry, everyone... I seem to be having trouble seeding from behind my college firewall. I'm going to upload this as a series of zip files to Megaupload, and post the links here... and then hopefully some people who download it will help to seed it for the benefit of people who prefer getting stuff on BitTorrent."
,wmgan,2007-01-31T13:07Z,Would anyone (preferably living in the USA) be interested in helping me to seed this?  I'm willing to send out a few copies of the DVD for this purpose.
,KnightDiver,2007-02-02T03:34Z,"Wmgan, I pm'ed you about seeding.  If you didn't read it, let me know either in a pm or here if you'd like me to seed this.  I'm in the US."
,wmgan,2007-02-02T07:29Z,"Thanks, KnightDiver... I've replied to your PM."
,KnightDiver,2007-02-06T00:37Z,"Thanks to wmgan I now am seeding the torrent.  So if you start leeching you will get the file.  Thank you wmgan!!!

,KnightDiver,2007-02-11T14:48Z,"After uploading over 22GB, I am still the only seed?  What's going on here?  Hit and run?"
,B-manSwe,2007-03-11T15:46Z,"Yes KnightDiver, thats what people usually do on piratebay...hit and run...bastards"
,heyhey17,2009-01-20T05:16Z,"i WOULD seed this if i could actually get a copy of this, i wanna see it."
