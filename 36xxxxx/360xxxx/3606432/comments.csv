,aidylee,2007-01-30T05:00Z,"dont worry im expecting this to take me about 12 hours with this firewalled uni connection between 2kb/s to 19kb/s (if im lucky)... 

:)"
,godspeed_,2007-01-30T05:34Z,"im downloading @ 2 kb/s. 
that's insane! SEED please!"
,AnonymousGuy,2007-01-30T05:38Z,It's reeding as only 8 people running this and no seeders. Earlier it was insane though 160kb for a while.
,skuggan,2007-01-30T05:38Z,"Dude, it's one(1) seeder and over a thousand(1000) peers. You do the math. dumbfu*k."
,milenko019,2007-01-30T05:38Z,i wasnt whining just wanted to know sorry if you took it that way
,skuggan,2007-01-30T05:41Z,"sry, just tird of people not understanding, and i meant leechers not peers:). have patience, as soon as some more ppl has it the speed will increase(as always)"
,caxcallatik,2007-01-30T05:43Z,"i've been dl at about 200 the whole time

,skuggan,2007-01-30T05:44Z,"milenko019, i wasn't saying the part about whining to you. i was acting before ppl started to, apparantly it didn't help.."
,godspeed_,2007-01-30T05:57Z,does anybody seed? bitcomet shows that there and none seedes but 40 leechers. :(

[V],zebbbo,2007-01-30T14:53Z,thanks! 
,jdkullmann,2007-01-30T16:07Z,i'm going to start superseeding this for a few hours now.  i'm sort of a n00b and don't see a main .rar file and can't figure out (on linux) how to unrar all these.  
,TD0607,2007-01-30T16:40Z,"Unrar in linux: # unrar e /folder/'*.rar'
That should do it...  Just remember to ""cd"" to the directory you want the extracted files to be..."
,pamlor,2007-01-30T17:17Z,"This file dosen't work; have tested with 3 media players:

Videolan latest version
Media player classic latest version
Real player latest version"
,pamlor,2007-01-30T19:07Z,"I know; the problem is solved, i had to change to open GL in vls player. I got this problem after i installed win xp sp2."
,ouchast,2007-01-31T21:27Z,Thanks!
,jimh82,2007-02-14T23:51Z,Sub är lika effektivt på att döda en film/serie som dubbning.. Jag föreslår att du stänger av ljudet och ägnar dig åt gissningar istället.
