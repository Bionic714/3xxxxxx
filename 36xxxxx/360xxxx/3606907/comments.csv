,Nos_Redna,2007-08-28T05:48Z,Best animated show ever.
,luminary07,2007-10-08T03:14Z,"Somehow the sound was lost. All AVI files transfered but without Audio.

,urlsen,2007-10-11T21:37Z,"i love this show...long time sice ive seen it but never seen so many in one pack

Good job    drgr

See and be be leached"
,stupid m0nkey,2007-11-19T12:56Z,"luminary07, it's quite simple for sound(and this goes for almost all the videos on this site) just use a another media player.

most people would say VLC is best but i say jetaudio is equally as great.
I love WMP but they just dont have the codecs for watching pirated stuff"
,IronCrux0,2007-11-30T04:02Z,"Actually...I pirate movies all the time with WMP and   it said missing codecs one time...so I cliked ""download codec"" and viola. Instant happiness."

Excellent torrent - all works perfectly, great quality except two minor issues:

'Gaz Taster of Pork' is slightly lower quality than the others

'Most Horrible Xmas Ever' is the censored version

I've been seeding for 2 days now as everyone needs to know the genius of this show!"

,Aneko,2010-04-02T05:29Z,"in the words of Gir: I LOVE THIS SHOW.
great torrent"
,Xeokym,2010-04-10T19:45Z,"There are 47 episodes of Invader Zim, and this only has 46 files, so THERE'S AN EPISODE MISSING. This looks to be a different torrent of the other torrent that comes in Spanish, and is missing an ep. as well! WTF??

And pirate bay is so fucking GLITCHY nowadays, there are so many fucking ADS slowing the pages down from opening to outright freezing them...I know they need ads for money but this is getting severly annoying!! It's like the death rattle before pirate bay goes the way of napster, turning ""legit."" "
,rakudaniku,2011-01-30T19:33Z,"@Xeokym: Two of the episodes are combined into one in this release.
/Invader_Zim_13A&13B_Battle_of_the_Planets_[sNeK][89d1d8a9].avi"
,gavk2011,2011-02-21T00:05Z,do ya have to wait till its fully downloaded until you can watch it?? cause i cant watch while its downloading 
,Persona_Alio,2011-05-13T01:38Z,"Quality is meh, I would suggest torrents 4873848 or 3398808. The supposed ""missing episode"" is only the pilot episode, which is available in torrent 4873848."
,isuperman11,2011-09-01T18:38Z,hella invader zim :D
,StankyLefthand,2011-09-08T01:56Z,"@Xeokym ""there are so many fucking ADS slowing the pages"" What fucking ADS? Ooohhhhhh, you don't have adblocker. I get it now. Sucks to be you! I haven't seen a single ad since, like...Bush was in office. WEEE! I WAS THE TURKEY!"
