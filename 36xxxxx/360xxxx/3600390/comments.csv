Downloading them from here is OK, just remember to mention who´s version it is if you trade them. You should always mention source and who did the digital work. Many people collection zappa-shows cares about that. Just be honest and it´ll be no problem.

ILL DO MY BEST TO PLAY ALONG ! 




Lineage: Aud master->DAT->cassette->CDR->EAC->SoundForge (speed correction, re-tracking)->FLAC Frontend 


The first show of the famous 1981 Halloween run at the Palladium. This recording, transferred from my tapes by JS, is 1st gen if you only count analog generations, and sounds quite nice. The sampling process also revealed that very small portions (0,7/1,9 secs) are missing here after the tape flips in the Drowning Witch and Yo Mama solos compared to Drew?s version, but I chose not to patch them in as there?s a little difference in sound. Unfortunately, we weren?t able to find any fills for the tape flips. 




this is what you call 1st . gen you cant be serious 


looks like 3rd gen to me dat is not lossless it uses tape! 





first of all this was recorded by steve h.

BTW, as I have mentioned in other threads, it appears that this was NOT recorded by Grape, although it was traded by him to Hot Rats. 




AS I POINTED OUT OVER A MONTH AGO ! 

WHEN WILL PEOPLE STOP BUYING YOUR LIES ! 







IF YOU TRUST THE ZAPPAQUEERS YOUR FUCKED !
