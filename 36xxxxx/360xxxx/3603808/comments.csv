,elyk1212,2007-01-30T02:44Z,"May I suggest something?  I noticed you uploaded many torrents at a time. ... and all are going quite slow.

If you upload only one or two at a time, allow a few people to download the file(s) and help seed, things will roll along much faster.

Thx for uploading!"
,elyk1212,2007-02-09T17:33Z,"I don't think anyone is seeding this (everyone is stuck at about 16-17%).  Maurizio?...  Can you help us out, man?"
,elyk1212,2007-02-09T17:33Z,Been downloading this now for 10 days! lol
,elyk1212,2007-02-14T17:21Z,"This torrent was DOA... too bad, I am giving up :("
,elyk1212,2007-04-11T01:56Z,"You know what's funny... many months later, and it still says there is a seeder... 

But no downloads....LOL

Something tells me that is a mistake."
