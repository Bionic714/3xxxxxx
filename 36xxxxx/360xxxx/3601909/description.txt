- Notes
*for some reason the discovery channel source did 
not look as good as last week and other times. the 
picture is not perfect but looks just fine on a tv.
*Getting brand new duel core equipment in a few
days. expect future releases to be out much quicker.
*also will be using a better capturing device from
now on so that should give a better picture as well.
*Enjoy the great show!
