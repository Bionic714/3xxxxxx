,D2T,2007-07-25T22:09Z,"FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec

,Caleb983,2007-09-03T23:37Z,thanks
,KrabatenX,2007-12-15T20:27Z,But how come the songs are bigger than usual if they are in FLAC?
,Supernal,2008-01-25T23:44Z,Because they're higher quality.
,OzBrickie,2008-02-08T22:26Z,Because they are CD Quality but half the size. You can de-compress them and you have the wav file exactly as it was before
,Gr0v,2009-02-07T12:48Z,A mp3 file with high quality is usually about 320kbps a FLAC file is more then double.
