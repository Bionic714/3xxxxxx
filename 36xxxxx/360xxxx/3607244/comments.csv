The ones I've used, like for exaple DVD Clone, allways says that the film is to big..?!"
,Fregne,2007-01-31T09:00Z,"I use two programs. First I use DVDFab to remove unwanted material, then I use DVD Shrink to re-encode the movie.
DVDFab can re-encode the movie too, but I think DVD Shrink has better quality. Its also very slow compared to other re-encoding programs.
If you try this, remember to set DVDFab to DVD9! That way you just remove what you want, and can let DVD Shrink encode it.

Hope this help you..

Good Luck"
