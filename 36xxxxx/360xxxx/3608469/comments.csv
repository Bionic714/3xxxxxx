......The suffering of the little Children in this movie. Is it possible to grieve after watching this movie? If you don't after watching it, you may be required to turn in proof that you still have a human heart.

,slurvic,2008-05-08T04:21Z,"While this may be a great anime, please be advised the english translation is only dubbed over the spoken japanese. In other words, you hear both languages at the same time. So, it is extremely hard to understand either language.  (I viewed the film using WMV)"
,DROEPAstoner,2008-06-03T05:16Z,use a different player
,srag,2008-06-15T22:07Z,"thnx for this man, really appreciate it!"
,instinct_X,2008-07-23T12:30Z,"slurvic, the audio is not dubbed over. The file has two different individually selectable audio streams. It's Windows Media Player that has a problem with that. The solution is to use a better player, like say ""Media Player Classic"". Then you'll be able to select the audio stream that you want to hear. 

Thanks for a great upload GoldSneakers! "
,omegastar013,2008-09-11T11:18Z,excellent movie. thank you for uploading GoldSneakers!
,blair906,2008-09-14T04:12Z,Are there subs or not?  I wish people would list these kinds of things...
,odon.lowe,2008-10-23T04:39Z,"There are no subs, but for the most part the Japanese is fairly simple."
,pogsnet,2009-01-16T05:13Z,Is this english?
,maddogjew6970,2009-02-14T01:53Z,"Simple Japanese? Are you kidding? ?????! Do you think anyone can understand what I just wrote? I have struggled for the last year and a half to learn Japanese. 3 alphabets and grammer unlike English at all? I have to stick to romanji, hirakana and katagana are hard enough, once you ad kanji, forget about it."
,madanchi,2009-02-26T18:55Z,"lol odd its got english voic speaking but also got the japanes voice behind it, didnt realsie trhey kept the jap voice as theres no point when the other voice is in englush.."
,eelectro,2009-04-11T23:20Z,use VLC media player and pick which langauge you want. how are people still unable to find codecs and use VLC
,FRivera,2009-06-15T11:40Z,"""It is a brave man/woman that dares undersign his/her message with retard.""

lol yeah ol zordie flat-out walked into that one"
,TheRoomy,2009-06-27T03:24Z,"The english dub, is it professional voice actors doing a professional translation, as in an American english release of the movie?  Or is it some kids on the internet doing all the voices and sounding awful?  If so, does this come with english subs?  The link someone put below doesn't work."
,brohken,2009-08-17T15:21Z,"The english audio sounds pretty pro, it's not some homemade job I don't think. I prefer subs with the Japanese audio.

That said, it has the dual audio (which if you're on a Mac you will need VLC to choose the Japanese) embedded.

I found a matching srt here

Quality is the best you can expect for 700MB.

Thank you!"
,CandyCoatedDrugz,2009-10-05T00:16Z,This has to be one of my favorite anime movies of all time. It's a really powerful anti-war movie; I think it's a must see.
