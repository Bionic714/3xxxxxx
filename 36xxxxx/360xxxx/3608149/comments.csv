,dumpster999,2008-11-10T12:26Z,"Just to share some info about this download:
- The quality is as good as I would expect - some of these date back to pre-world war 2. Be fair.

- All the cartoons have English spoken language, some have subtitles hardcoded in a language other than english (sometimes the subs have started or stoped part way through)

- I found that some of the files wouldn't play. I tried in windows media player and Classic Media Player (Real Alternative). It looks to me like the files have not ripped properly from the source or have corupted over the many upload/downloadings. 

- The files I found to be corupted are:
Donald Duck 1941 Chef Donald.mpg
Donald Duck 1941 Donald's Camera.mpg
Donald Duck 1941 Timber.mpg
Donald Duck 1943 DonaldÂ´s Tire Trouble.mpg
Donald Duck 1944 Contrary Condor.mpg
Donald Duck 1945 Duck Pimples.mpg
Donald Duck 1945 The Eyes Have It.mpg
Donald Duck 1946 Wet Paint.mpg
Donald Duck 1947 Clown Of The Jungle.mpg
Donald Duck 1947 Crazy Whith The Heat.mpg
Donald Duck 1948 Daddy Duck.mpg
Donald Duck 1949 Donald's Happy Birthday.mpg
Donald Duck 1950 Crazy Over Daisy.mpg
Donald Duck 1959 Donald In Mathmagic land.mpg

- I also downloaded these files using a differint torrent client which didnt change the behavor when trying to play them. 

These are are what I discovered after downloading. You can make up your own mind to download this torrent or part of this torrent or none at all. 
Good luck."
,dumpster999,2008-11-10T12:30Z,PS: Thanks to DeeLee for making the effort to upload these in the first place. I am certinly enjoying the cartoons that are good.
,kelv1969,2008-12-13T15:46Z,"A lot of these cartoons are very bad quality but there isn't another torrent around that provides donald duck cartoons from 1951 and newer. thanks for content. Also glad you didn't compress all the videos together, so I can just download the ones I want. Thanks again."
,Hails592,2010-04-18T20:13Z,"for all you tossers who keep bitching about the quality, what do you expect from the 1920s to 1950s? huh? they didnt have digital remastering then, they only just about had tecnicolor!! retards!! thanks for the upload, i love it :)"
,binyo66,2010-12-02T23:15Z,Thx for the upload
