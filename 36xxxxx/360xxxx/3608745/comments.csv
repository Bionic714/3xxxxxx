,H121,2007-02-01T22:54Z,i guess any chance you can upload one with 350mb versions as well?
,djemel,2007-02-01T23:03Z,"Anyone who know how to get the rest of ""Vanished""????"
,plau,2007-02-01T23:26Z,"There are all the episodes 
--> http://thepiratebay.org/tv/83/S01/


And cheers for the fixed versions of the day break"
,death734,2007-02-01T23:39Z,i would think (and hope) that if someone else did s01e07 and e08 at 350mb then they will probably do e09 and e10 at 350mb
,H121,2007-02-01T23:49Z,"yes there will be 350mb versions of the remaining episodes, with episode 9 being available later tonight.  However, thats using different capping methods, so some people might prefer one way or the other.  I was just wondering if these files sizes could somehow be reduced using this capping technique(snag it).  BTW the others are capped with SnapProx on a MAC"
,death734,2007-02-01T23:52Z,"these file sizes can be reduced easily by using virtual dub mod with the XviD codec.

which one do you think are better caps? the 342mb for e07 looked as good as the hdtv rips for previous episodes."
,Innuendo-,2007-02-01T23:58Z,"If it matters to anyone: Episode 10 is out over at TVTorrents in a 350mb version.

File:	day.break.110.webrip.xvid.avi
Size:	368306176 (351.24 Mb)

Has 2 seeds. Not the fastest torrent but we are getting there :) The seeder says that ep9 is on the way."
,bucsfan,2007-02-02T01:37Z,thank u
,DanPainter,2007-02-02T02:39Z,I'll wait for H121 versions later tonight he's doing a great job.
,H121,2007-02-02T03:29Z,"incase i dont get it uploaded in time, i2mfan will upload the same version as I would have...just so you know"
,i2mfan,2007-02-02T14:29Z,"Same rip as before episode 9 for those that want individual files(not pack). Compare resolution/codec/size

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3609198/Day_Break_S01E09_Webrip_Divx"
,death734,2007-02-02T20:04Z,"i know this is not scene but still it would be nuked for bad AR. the aspect ratio has been stretched to 1.33:1 (4:3) when it was originally 1.77:1 (16:9), uncompressed audio (abc's stream is not that good and would sound the same with 128k mp3), no ivtc.

thanks for trying but i suggest learning more about encoding if your gonna do more of these"
,CWORMAC,2007-02-03T13:31Z,:( guess i should stick to seeding and not ripping
,foxtecca,2007-02-04T23:36Z,"wow death734, you can read the scene rules..and pass judgement...because everyone knows your a very well known siteop right...plus the head of the best release group this side of LOL, right?

my god n00bs are n00bs"
,ashwalters,2007-02-05T07:13Z,"What are you talking about dude? I was about to start downloading this huge-ass torrent, but thanks to death734's comment I won't waste my bandwith on something I would not enjoy. So thanks death734 for the information."
,death734,2007-02-05T19:49Z,"@foxtecca
is this the point when I'm suppose to ask you for forgiveness for telling you that the files are not ok for those following reasons.

speaking of noobs 'rolls eyes' enjoy downloading nuked files"
