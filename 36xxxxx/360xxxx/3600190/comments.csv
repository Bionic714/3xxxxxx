helppppppppppp"
,dstelios77,2007-01-22T01:17Z,"Iso files are image files so you need to install a program like Alcohol 52%/120% or Power ISO 3.5 and mount the iso file from there, you can find these programs from torrent clients or i can send you the program in your email, my email is : dstelios77@hotmail.com"
,Freeland,2007-02-04T18:25Z,don't download this shit!
,dstelios77,2007-02-06T16:09Z,":) And why not download it ..? :P , It's only the iso image of NFS and cracks & patches neccesary to run the game under windows XP

,Undefeated915,2007-10-20T13:24Z,Seed please....I want to play this game...
,CMMMM,2007-11-27T19:30Z,"I may help you, it took me about 5 hours to install it:

1. You need PowerIso to unpack it, download and unpack.  
2. You need the voodoo2a.dll, if this torrent doesn't include it, download another one. 
3. Burn all unpacked things on a normal CD in the normal mode CD(ISO).
4. Install the cracks, but I think they dont work. 
5. Install the game off the CD. 
6. Copy the folder ""Movies"" (that you unpacked at the beginning) to the Data folder of your installdirecton which is normally C:\Programme\Electronic Arts\Need For Speed High Stakes\Data
7. Copy the folder ""Audio"" (that you unpacked at the beginning, too) to the Data folder of your installdirecton which is normally C:\Programme\Electronic Arts\Need For Speed High Stakes\Data\Audio
8. Run the game and have fun!"
,CMMMM,2007-11-27T19:42Z,"This contains the file voodoo2a.dll, so download this one and have fun!"
,dstelios77,2008-02-27T01:55Z,"Hm it seems the guides werent usefull, anyway here is goes again:

1) Mount the iso with program like Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120%, or you can unpack the iso and burn it on a cd like CMMMM said
2) Do a full install
3) Run the nfshspatch4_50.exe
4) Go to the 3D Device Setup option in the games subfolder from the start menu and choose Direct 3D Device 1 (or Primary Display Driver)
5) Run the nfspatch10.exe, checkmark ONLY the ""new (nfs5) d3da.dll file"", then you will be asked to select the directory to install the patch, that would be C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Need For Speed High Stakes\
6) Repeat Step 4) again (Even if its already selected)
7) From the iso copy the directory ""Music""  from Data\Audio\ and paste to \Data\Audio
8) From the iso copy the directory Movies from Data\ and paste to \Data\
9) Copy the NFS4HS_V4.50.exe to  and run it
10) Run the HermeS.reg file
11) Note:  is the C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Need For Speed High Stakes\ ,  also if you burned the iso on a cd then you will copy the directories Music and Movies from the cd. If you have slow perfomance make sure that compatibility mode is not selected. If the sound is incorrect from the Options go to Audio and in the Audio mode choose stereo

,5t4r1ight,2008-10-01T22:01Z,"Well, can anybody explain to me please:

WHY THE HELL WONT IT BOOT WHEN I MOUNTED THE ISO IMAGE!? I cant install it because when i mount it with Daemon Tools i just get the wating cursor and then it dissapears like nothing happened???"
,Genesis3750,2008-12-05T14:45Z,"5t4r1ight

To mount an ISO in DAEMON, run ""DTProAgent.exe"" from the install directory this will put DAEMON in the system tray. Right click that icon and go to Vitrual CD/DVD ROM > and do one of two things,
1. if the only options are to Add SCSI or IDE Virtual Drive then add SCSI Virtual Drive. Next right click on the icon again, go to Vitrual CD/DVD ROM > (something like) [0-0 - SCSI] NO MEDIA  -  Click that, locate the ISO and mount it... then go to My Computer and run the Mounted image if it doesn't automatically.

2. There's already a Virtual CD/DVD Drive setup and you can get what to do from previous instructions.

hope that helps!"
