,trinitrontv,2007-04-05T05:45Z,"Great show. Thanks.

,coffy89,2007-04-07T04:07Z,Super. This BBC production is splendid. Leech and seed everybody. Thanks kef71
,nerys,2007-04-08T23:33Z,This is a slightly defective torrent. The ISO is REGION 2 (parts 1 2 and 3 are fine 4 and 5 are region 2) when I rip the disc and reburn it simply says invalid disc in the DVD player (if I play the original burn it says invalid region and the computer says its region 2) how do I fix this? is there a region 1 torrent for discs 4 and 5 ?
,presidentofzero,2007-04-09T10:42Z,thanx kef71!! this is great!!!
,nerys,2007-04-10T04:33Z,hmmm decrypter shows it being all region ?? is there something special  a setting in dvd decrypter I have to use ? I am ripping now and will just reburn it and see what happens. its odd that 1-2-3 work fine only 4 and 5 give me problems.
,Audiocracy,2007-04-15T23:00Z,"There is one file that preventing this DVD from loading in Region 1 DVD players. You must change the file VIDEO_TS.IFO from Region 2,4 to region free.

To do this:

1. Extract the iso or copy the contents off the dvd if you have already burnt it onto the computer.

2. Use DVD Decrypter to check the region information of the IFO files in the VIDEO_TS folder of the DVD/ISO. (You should only need to do this with VIDEO_TS.IFO as the others are region free)

DVD Decrypter > Tools > IFO > Region Information > Navigate to the VIDEO_TS folder and select an IFO file

3. Change the region information of the affected file (VIDEO_TS.IFO) to region free by going to DVD Decrypter > Tools > IFO > Region Patch > Region Free > Navigate to the VIDEO_TS.IFO file.

4. Reburn the files onto a DVD."
,deamon2000,2007-04-16T01:54Z,wow full dvd  and there all GREAT and im very picky!:)
,doudave,2007-04-25T18:21Z,"i have tried both ways to make these images region free but they have not worked, can anyone help."

,tantanmay,2007-05-15T07:53Z,"This message is for KEF71.
Sorry dude for posting this comment here cuz it's regarding: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3593050/Terminator_2__Judgment_Day_(Ultimate_Edition)_Disc_1
For that torrent, there are a bunch of us stuck at 99%. Since you are the original uploader, I'm wondering if you could please seed it for some time?
You'll make a lot of us happy! Thanks bro"
,dentman,2007-05-22T18:26Z," DVDDecrypter took 7 minutes to open the ISO from here and burn it straight to a new dvd and automatically removed the region code. I wish I had known before I made the first set of disks with covers. But they play in my computer fine.

Don't mess with the IFO just rip it from the ISO to your DVD disk."
,marloncortez,2007-06-23T15:33Z,Please seed ALL 5 discs!! This looks real cool!
,war59312,2007-07-01T06:37Z,"Ifo Edit can convert from PAL to NTSC and NTSC to Pan in seconds. Sames goes for making it region free.

Vob Blanker also works great!!!"
,Malibu_Barbie,2007-08-18T22:06Z,"Thanks for all the work.  Season disks 1 to 4 play fine, but this one is encoded for region-2 only.  Can't play it on my favorite DVD program."
,RawThang,2007-09-05T06:24Z,Please seed lads
,dsrs,2007-09-12T14:33Z,"audiocracy
thanks for the useful tip, necessary to burn the 4 and 5 isos.
there is one more important point however
it is no good changing the video_ts.ifo file from regions 2 and 4 to regions 12345678 [region free] UNLESS you also edit the 
video_ts.bup file also so that instead of 2 and 4 it also says 12345678

ie both these files must have the same information or else you cannot burn them and play them on a home dvd player
btw...the episodes 4 and 5 will play in vlc on the computer with NO EDITING
and pal or ntsc is not an issue since any decent home dvd player will play both, since only a diff of 25 to 29 frames per sec"
,Welfi,2007-09-29T23:53Z,seed please :) Really want this serie... It's so beautiful!
