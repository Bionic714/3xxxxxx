,darobin,2007-07-10T22:24Z,"I ran it in daemon, cant install it on c: cause install.ini or some couldnt be copied from source disc (install file...). Got it to install on my backupdrive d: but i didnt have enough space there so it stopped at 97%. Thought id try to burn it properly on a disc, how do i burn an .iso file to a disc so it works like the original disc?"
,CyberThug,2007-08-22T22:43Z,"hvordan oppdaterer man ETKA? Jeg f책r ERROR RR12 p책 update 598...

Noen som vet?
----------------------------
Anyone know how to update to 598?
i get ERROR RR12"
,chipukizi,2008-09-21T20:19Z,"To add SKODA and SEAT

Browse to C:\etka\prog and edit;
ETKA_VW.INI
ETKA_AU.INI
ETKA_SE.INI
ETKA_SK.INI

as follows, under the title KONZERN, add SK and SE:

[KONZERN]
firmen=VW,AU,SK,SE

Once this is done, they will appear on the main menu but will run with a few errors. To rectify, Go to Maintenance, INI-EDITOR and change the settings to be similar to VW and AUDI"
,haakon82,2008-10-05T11:33Z,"I just installed etka 7, 597.
The program is in german, anyone knows how to change language?? "
,oleg333,2008-10-19T18:05Z,"about language.
1. start etka for any brand
2.right upper corner, first column, second row quadrate - press, SPRACHAUSWAHL - select your
language"
,Mister White,2009-01-22T23:48Z,"This works excellent. Full ETK version with updates included. Readme files with easy explanation how to install are included. Installation goes flawless. Recommended to anyone with a VW produkt.

Many thanks for this torrent!!!"
,bossman187uk,2009-05-27T17:36Z,why cant i search older cars like a golf mk2 1985 or a T3 camper 1983??

,lgnd91,2009-09-09T09:01Z,"I have a problem :)
Bunt to dvd started setup.exe then I run into the following error message:

This system is no fatclient or etmaster 2000 server. Installation will be aborted.

Any thoughts? Thanks!"
,KrahvK,2009-12-20T19:16Z,Same shit: This system is no fatclient or etmaster 2000 server. Installation will be aborted. Is it because Vista?
,rexx101,2010-10-01T20:49Z,"If you get ""This system is no fatclient or etmaster 2000 server"" error, then try and install using a virtual drive instead of burning the image, it worked for me."
,cgiksy,2010-11-23T15:35Z,"There are some C:\%Windows Directory%\System32 files that need to be removed. 
delete
C:/windows/etkinst.ini
and there are 2 other files I think, starting with ETK*. Delete those, too."
,OrvoTM,2010-11-25T09:02Z,"Install went flawless ! No errors whatsoever. Just that after installing each update, at the start-up screen I only get Audi and Volkswagen, no Seat or Skoda ... And I actually needed it for a Seat Ibiza ... What is to be done in this case ? Thanks ..."
,sangodin,2011-01-22T21:55Z,"Installation went seamless on W7 but, dammit, it takes a loooot on a quadcore with 4 GB RAM  running W7. Also the updates are endless. Do not cancel thinking that the program entered on a loop. Look at the update number that runs from 597 to 622. GREAT JOB pal!"
,KeewayDriver,2011-02-28T19:12Z,"i've downloaded this torrent, but it doesn't work at me. when i have installed it and try to run it, i get an error -> Error 7: Hardlock not found.
anyone know how to fix this? or knows a working torrent? Thnx :)"
,danielbp,2011-03-28T21:29Z,er det p책 norsk? 
,Gornil,2011-07-26T23:56Z,"For those who gets the ""This system is no fatclient or etmaster 2000 server"" error do the following:

Many thanks for the advice, successfully reinstalled ETKA 7.0. 

Files need to be deleted in other area (use the Search option of Windows to find those related files):- 

1. C:\windows\prefetch and look for ET* or other extraneous etka related files w/ a recent timestamp.. or even setup.*.. whack anything suspicious. 

2. Removed a ETK7.INI from C:\Documents and Settings\\Local Settings\Temp (look for other etka looking files in here, too, such as a cached version of the setup executable. 

3. If any, also removed C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\ETKA.

4. delete
C:/windows/etkinst.ini

It fixed the problem for me atleast"
,trooprm02,2011-09-11T19:57Z,Thanks Gornil! Doing that after I got the error and mounting the .iso instead of burning it do a disc made the installation run perfectly on Windows 7 64 bit! :)
,RedWabbit,2011-11-20T23:00Z,If someone has the full torrent please seed.  for some reason I lost my vw and skoda updates and need to redownload them.  once I have them I can leave the torrent open for a few weeks so others can dl it.
