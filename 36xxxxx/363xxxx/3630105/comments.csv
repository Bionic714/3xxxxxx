  I downloaded this torrent and was wondering if I could run it without having to burn to dvd cause I dont have a dvd burner.  Any suggestions would help!
Thanx"
,killa_kill,2007-03-09T01:47Z,"Yeah man you can create a ""Virtual"" CD/DVD drive with ""Alcohol 120%"" or ""Daemon"" Tools
and it will be as if the CD/DVD were in a physical drive Good Luck"

,IronCrux0,2007-10-24T06:47Z,"For all of the people who are new at this. Search Google for Daemon Tools, download and install. After finishing downloading the torrent, open the containing folder and look at the filepath. Then, on your Windows Toolbar, click the Daemon Tools icon and go to Virtual CD DVD ROM and select a drive then select mount image. Do that for each disk and run it from My Computer if Auto Run doesn't turn on. Install it like that, then,  either search for a crack within the torrent containing folder or download one. Copy the crack (usually the same name as the actual program in the bin folder of the filepath you installed it in) Backup the old .exe file and copy and paste the new one."

,dhala11,2007-12-03T14:56Z,"Thanks aaanden for this Great!!! torrent...it works exellent for me =D

To all who cant play it...do like me...

1.Download it

2.Then mount the file named ""Sims2_1.mdf"" who is in the ""CD1"" folder in the folder you get when your download was finished.

3.Now the installing window should start,and it is just to wait until a window comes up that says ""Put in disc 2"" or somthing...Anyways when it have come up...you just mount the file as you did when the first cd...then when a window comes up and say so you do the same thing with the other cd:s(3 and 4).

4.To start the game you mount the file in ""CD1""...and click on a ""Sims 2"" icon...it may take a few minutes to start =D

P.S
I have not find a crack that works to this game...Anyone who knows a good crack so please tell me =D

If you have questions...feel free to ask"
