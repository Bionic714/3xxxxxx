,artytorrent,2007-10-03T18:15Z,"If you've been making dance music for a while, you will be very familiar with the drum sounds of the Roland TR-909. You've probably got  samples of it stored in various places. This VSTi  recreates those sounds and offers a ""hands-on"" way of tweaking them in software.
To get it installed....
Extract all 3 RAR files into the same folder. You should now have B-Drumaz.part1 B-Drumaz.part2 and B-Drumaz.part3, along with the NFO and diz file.
To install the plug-in to your VST folder, click the Drumazon.exe file in the part1 RAR file. If you have all the RARs in the same folder, it will automatically find them and install the plug correctly.
The keygen.exe should be dragged from the same part1.RAR
When you run the keygen, you can choose your own name for the licensing info. Save the regkey somewhere you'll be able to find it. When you boot up your sequencer and load an instance of Drumazon, it will ask you to browse for the key. Find it where you chose earlier, click OK and the app should run perfectly. The default pattern should start playing, but if you just want to use the VSTi as a MIDI drum machine, hit the switch in the top left corner to turn EXT sync on. Now you can play the 909 sounds by drawing in the piano roll or by hitting your MIDI keyboard.
The preset kits (top right corner) are pretty cool, but making your own tweaks is great fun. "

,1337erik,2012-07-05T02:17Z,The .exe only opens a text window filled with wierd characters. Is this supposed to be able to be used in OS X? I know that some people use Drumazon in OS X but is this torrent has an .exe that cannot be used in OS X.
