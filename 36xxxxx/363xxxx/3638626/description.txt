      Synthesis
       
      Drumazon synthesis emulates all the sounds of the original
      9O9. All the instruments are synthesized in exactly the same
      way as the original. All the nuances and detail of the
      original are captured perfectly. In addition, all Drumazon
      instruments have enhanced controls. This extra functionality
      allows the user to adjust the sounds further than on the
      original unit. This opens up a whole new world of sound
      creation. Listen to the audio demos or tweak it yourself with
      the demo version :)
       
      Outputs
       
      Drumazon has a flexible output configuration. Every
      instrument's audio signal can be routed to any of the 11
      outputs. This allows users to further shape sounds
      individually or in groups via their favourite plug-ins.
      Each individual output can be set to mono or stereo. Every
      instrument also has a Mute and Solo button. Mute will not just
      silence the sound, it will stop the sound being triggered.
      Solo will stop all other instruments from being triggered and
      only allow the selected sound(s) to play.
       
      Control
       
      Drumazon has extensive midi control. Midi notes can be used to
      trigger each individual sound. Alternatively, the internal
      sequencer can be used. This can be set to play using
      Drumazon's internal clock or set to synchronize perfectly to
      the host sequencer.
       
      Most of Drumazon's parameters can be automated within the host
      and also controlled using MidiCC with an external controller.
      An easy-to-use Midi Learn function allows reassignment of any
      of the parameters.
       
      Internal Sequencer
       
      Within the internal sequencer, patterns are stored in 8 banks.
      Each bank can store up to 12 patterns. Each pattern consists
      of 16 steps. Each pattern location has a midi note number
      assigned to it. The patterns can be edited traditionally using
      the step buttons or using the tap function.
       
      The internal sequencer has various modes of operation. In
      Chain Mode, a range of patterns are selected from the internal
      banks and are played through in a circular fashion. Patterns
      can also be triggered freely by selecting the corresponding
      midi note (for example, from a midi controller keyboard).
      External controllers can be used in any mode to provide full
      control over pattern playback.
       
      A Randomizer function is also provided within the internal
      sequencer. It can be used to make simple changes to a pattern
      or create a whole new one - ideal when your creativity needs a
      boost! Randomizing can be applied to specific instruments and
      specific steps. The frequency of occurrence can also be
      adjusted to give you just the right amount.
       
      Files are stored in the XML format. This allows single
      patterns or whole banks to be exchanged between users easily.
      XML allows the files to be edited in a text editor. Ideal if
      you want to post or share a pattern on a web site -just post
      the text!
       
      Presets
       
      The settings for each instrument can be stored in it's own
      preset. Each instrument preset can be loaded in individually.
      This allows maximum flexibility when putting kits of
      instruments together. A dedicated Preset Manager is provided
      to help the user manage the sounds within their own unique
      library.
       
      Requirements
       
      Drumazon is available in VSTi format at the moment for both
      platforms (PC and Mac).
      It's a dynamic library (.dll file) for PC and Universal Binary
      bundle for Mac.
      To use the product you need Windows 2000/XP or Mac OS X 10.4.3
      or later. It's not a standalone program so you need a VST
      compatible host application to use it.
      If you have not checked it yet try the demo first with your
      favourite host and environment.
