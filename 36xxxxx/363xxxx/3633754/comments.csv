I have all the episodes. Can you (or any 1 else) plz upload only a unaired pilot episode"
,dxv,2007-03-09T07:57Z,"hey Devinius977,

what u can do is download just the unaired pilot file called heroes.s01e00.avi in the extras folder.  all u do is set all the other files as don't download.  though it depends on what kind of client your using."
