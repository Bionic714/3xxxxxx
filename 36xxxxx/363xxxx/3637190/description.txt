The Buddha's Teaching As It Is
~ An Introductory Course ~

By Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi

This course consists of 10 lectures on the fundamentals of the Buddha?s Teachings, the Dhamma:

The lectures explain the Dhamma from the perspective of Theravada Buddhism, the oldest continuous Buddhist school, whose scriptures, the Pali canon, give the most accurate picture of what the historical Buddha himself actually taught. The lectures are intended to be basic enough to be of value to beginners without previous study of the Dhamma, and deep and through enough to be of interest to long-term students seeking to extend and clarify their understanding.

Each lecture is in two parts, making a total of 20 tracks. 96 kbps.
