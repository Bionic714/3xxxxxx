,Bamsefar2,2007-03-11T19:23Z,"Wonder why the quality is set to only 3 stars..... Anybody can tell?










"
,ottoniemi,2007-03-13T16:22Z,"Well I just finished downloading it and had a look. The quality is terrible. In places its near DVD-quality, in others its much worst than VHS.

If I had known I wouldnt have downloaded it. It was a waste of bandwidth. We'll just have to wait for a better release."
,arnold1965,2007-03-13T16:28Z,"ottoniemi:

Obviously you did something wrong when burning it or you need to update your computer.
Nothing wrong with the quality.
You use the wrong DVDs or/and burn at the wrong speed, of course the result will be shit.
Try getting to know how to burn, or better, learn how to download."
,Tommyen,2007-03-13T19:46Z,"Quality is just fine, I think. There are sequences in the film that are meant to look like TV-footage from the actual happenings (if you know what I mean), and these sequences appear to have lower quality. But I guess that was the intention as well. 

You must also remember the fact that this has been ripped into single-layer dvd, and therefore the quality is reduced as well."
,BuickLimited,2007-03-14T11:35Z,Thx arnold1965. Your uploads are magnifique...
,shiabata,2007-03-15T14:54Z,Hur seedar man???
,arnold1965,2007-03-15T21:37Z,"humhumlan:

tpb server can't handle it, they seem to be doing lots to this site but everything seems to go to shit, so if the seeding is slow, ask tpb.
send tpb a message. i'm sure they'll answer in a couple of years. "
,arnold1965,2007-03-15T21:38Z,"vip.tracker = slow, slow and very slow!"
,saabig,2007-03-17T17:03Z,seeda laddar bara ner i 18kb/s

,white_fox,2007-03-26T22:34Z,"title:arnold1965 a sad truth
****************************************
you want to know a sad little fact about arnold1965 
he only uploads these movie so he gets attention because he has no friends in duetchsland he craves the little thx for the upload crap. if you didnt tell him this he would probably kill himself so talk to him and make the poor guy feel wanted also he spams people and takes there 40 dollars with clickbank affiliate programs.
arnold1965 i want my 40 dollars back id rather donate than give it to you, you loser.
arnold1965 please stop spamming tpb just upload the movies and give proper cred to the original release you stole this from and made your own. teafortwo,sisco etc. 
arnold if you need some friends join a sports team or something and get off your lazy ass clicking buttons on your pc and spend some time with real people.
instead of your ""e-friends""

torrents for a difference "
,cherrybabe,2007-03-26T22:47Z,"you really have some problems white_fox and just want attention. 

you need help. seriously white_fox. why do you even bother coming to tpb? just to get noticed? oh yeah, you're getting noticed alright and in the most negative way. 

i think people should write to tpb and stop people like you from writing a lot of shit in here. 

you have issues then take it somewhere else because we don't give a shit about your sad life, if you have one.
i see you and your girlfriend jroc261 are teaming up. frankly i think your bothe the same people. try a sex change."
,cherrybabe,2007-03-26T23:04Z,"SERIOUSLY PEOPLE. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO NOTIFY TPB ABOUT THESE 2 white_fox  & jroc261. WE COME TO TPB TO DOWNLOAD MOVIES, MUSIC AND GAMES BUT WHY SHOULD UPLOADERS LIKE ARNOLD1965 BE HASSLED?
NO UPLOADER SHOULD BE HASSLED AT ALL.

PLEASE EVERYBODY - SEND A MESSAGE TO TPB AND HAVE THESE IDIOTS BANNED FROM TPB.

THIS HASSLING/HARRASING HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH AND I'M SURE SICK OF IT.
JUST LET US DOWNLOAD IN PEACE AND THE UPLOADER LEFT ALONE.

THOSE WHO HAVE UPLOADED ARNOLD1965 MOVIES AND HAVE APPRECIATED THEM COULD DO HIM A FAVOUR BY HELP STOPPING THESE IDIOTS."
,msgpoker,2007-03-29T22:40Z,It says that the file is to big for WinRar. What shall I do? I would be very happy if someone could tell me
,ArneLax,2007-04-10T08:56Z,"I wonder.

How the F**k can TPB or someone else be pissed off.

Who has stolen WHAT.

This movie is stolen from the movie company.
U can't claim credits 4 something U don't own.

If TPB want's credit, go and save a whale
and just create a NFO of it.

These ""releasers"" just want too make ""cool NFO:s but they don't give a shit of the realease itself. 

It is pretty much like in the Kinder Garden ;

"" I did it first""
