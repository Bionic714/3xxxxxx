,Wheezy,2010-12-16T05:04Z,"@Haun

If you haven't learnt by now that no one can label anything properly on TPB and your stupid enough to delete your songs before you even check the content of the torrent you are going to download then you deserve everything that happened to you.

It's not the uploaders fault you lost your music, you can only blame your own ignorance.

Next time you want to start abusing some fucker why don't you just go on youtube."
