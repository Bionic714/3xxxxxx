The movie begins with a scene of Peter North having intercourse with Traci Lords and smelling or sucking her underwear. It contains one group sex scene, and after some public controversy it was banned in Portugal. Newspapers in other countries (for example, Turkey) also published derogatory comments about it. The movie, which is now considered a 1980s porn classic, ends with group sex and group blowjobs.
