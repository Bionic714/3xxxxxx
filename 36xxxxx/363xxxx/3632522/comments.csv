If anybody has Space Camp and or Red Planet I would sure love a DVD Rip of it..."
,conexn,2007-03-05T08:54Z,When you have finished downloading this movie please keep seeding it. I am using a pirated / war driving internet connection and will go off-line from time to time but I will keep seeding this and you will be able to finish your download.

,conexn,2007-03-22T05:43Z,"See if that helps, have been gone and I guess the power went off for more than 30 mins because my puter was off and the battery backup system will last for at least 30 min's. But I am again seeding. "
,EspenExcluzive,2007-03-22T20:00Z,"Uh.. Wtf? Its just a bunch of BUP, VOB and IFO-files.. How am I supposed to watch it?"
,conexn,2007-03-26T07:48Z,You burn the little files in the VIDEO_TS directory to a DVD-R disk and put it in your little DVD Player. OR you can use a player on your little puter and run the .vob files in order and there is the movie.
