For the last two months, I've been compiling a biased overview of the various PUGs (Pick-Up Gurus_ as well as the methods that they teach and sell. Only three of the methods reviewed has actually gotten me laid, but I've learned a lot from ALL of the methods reviewed.

When I first joined the seduction community over four months ago, I didn't really know where to go. I didn't have a clue what technique would fit what I wanted to shape myself into becoming. So, I ended up jumping from one method to another before I found what would work best for me.

This book will hopefully help someone avoid the same mistakes I made in selecting a proper method.

There is nothing new here, just reviews and my own biased opinion. Take it with a grain of salt.

The only guarantee that I make is that is product... well...

THE MAGIC BULLET? : Guaranteed 100% to NOT get you laid!

But it might point you in the right direction.

Not a bad book, I found it helpful in choosing a pick-up technique (Juggler). Author seems a bit bitter at times. :)
