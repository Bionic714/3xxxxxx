,karpanen1,2007-05-27T14:55Z,"excuse my ignorance but what the heck do I do with the bunch of .rar files, and .r00, .r01, .r02 files? They turn out to be identical files when I extract them. Someone please write a step-by-step procedure for me."
,WeirdGuy,2007-09-12T18:26Z,"I downloaded the program and now i see only black
no video nor texts.
So what's wrong? "
,Torium,2008-01-22T16:38Z,MillĂ¤ tĂ¤llĂ¤siĂ¤ leffoja saa toistettua? How to play movies like this?
[V],Kuthumi,2008-06-23T10:40Z,"Subtitles work fine. Note that one of the files has to be unrared two times.

Subtitle files can be effectively compressed in a Winrar archive, which is used 
to save space and downloading time. If you want to use them, you right-click the 
archive and choose ""Extract here"" from the Winrar menu. DO NOT delete the 
archive, or you will not be able to seed the film.

(If this does not work on your computer, then start Winrar manually and unpack 
the archive in the same folder as the film. If you don't have Winrar installed, 
then see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinRAR
or download from
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4029437/WINRAR
and install.

Subtitles are provided in several formats. This is the idx/sub version with two 
files. THEY MUST HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME FILE NAME AS THE FILM (the dot-avi file) 
TO WORK. Do not change either, or you will have to change them all. THEY MUST 
ALSO BE FOUND IN THE SAME FOLDER as the film.

These subtitle files will work in Windows Media Player and most other players. 
They can also be used in the newest standalone DivX players if burned to a data 
disc with the film, or copied to a USB memory stick. You'll have to choose them with the Subtitle button on your 
remote.

These subtitle files can also be used by most conversion programs (for example 
ConvertX to DVD) if you want to convert the dot-avi file to a DVD. In some 
programs you have to choose this option manually, see instructions for your 
conversion program. Often, you may also choose whether to have your subtitles 
burned into the picture, or saved as optional to be activated with the remote 
control for your player."
