,Damorte,2007-03-05T04:33Z,Because alot of people who got keys have ran in to problems downloading the game on the gamewebsite.
,kopiller,2007-04-05T11:55Z,thanks for the seed
,Z4rg0n,2007-04-09T13:56Z,Don't download this! the BETA is over... The only thing that will happen after that you have downloaded and installed is that you will lose some free space on your harddrive!
,Ykalon,2007-04-11T19:10Z,Can also use it to log in to early access if you don't get the pre order DVD in time.. If you also download the high resolution files found elsewhere here you basically got the same client as on the dvd.
,edleen,2007-04-22T12:03Z,Is there any way to get lifetime online play without purchasing the collectors edition?
,netza,2007-05-13T21:39Z,where to find private server?
,Sitw,2007-05-23T08:11Z,Is this the EU or US client?

,valalotro,2009-01-16T20:41Z,"if you download this and run the game, you have to download about 10 GiB in addition to play it^^"
,BencyHUN,2009-01-26T21:09Z,"You need a vaild product key to play the game. There are rumours about private servers, but hell I haven't found any.
I've played with the 14-day-trial key and I have to say, it's a good game. Much better than some shitty Word of Warcraft..."
,valalotro,2009-02-12T00:01Z,This client is way outdated. I recommend to load (and seed ;) ) the actual client from 01/2009: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4635069/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Online-Mines_of_Moria
