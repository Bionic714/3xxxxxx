,dabraju,2007-03-08T13:18Z,"I have downloaded the torrent. When I install it is installing the evaluation version without prompting for keys. Kindly help with the installation process.
There are two files in my download - Keygen and Winzip11"
,gamecheater2009,2007-03-09T00:15Z,"Once you have the evaluation version installed, you open the program, go to help > about winzip. You should see an option in there about key entry, which is when you open the text file and select the key you wish to use. Enter the name and the serial number, and you're good to go."
