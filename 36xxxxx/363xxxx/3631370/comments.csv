But i have some serious problems with connection my Windows Vista pc, via smb shares. Do U have any solutions for that ?.
I Use XBMC for watching DVD movies, and other movies across the network from my pc. It wont work, after I installed vista. I have read a lot of guides and explanations, but nothing seems to work.
