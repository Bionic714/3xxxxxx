,BlankTH,2007-03-24T14:31Z,@ Cowboykurt. There is a site where you can download all Season 2 episodes. I'll post  if I find it.
,Lof33,2008-01-22T18:46Z,Do anyone have the Japanese version?
,Lavatex,2008-08-25T21:18Z,In Usa versions some scenes were cut coz they are '' too violent or include  porn.'' its annoying coz some good jokes where cut too :(
,TheDarkLight,2008-08-30T07:29Z,I noticed that using 7zip compression at Ultra you can seriously compress videos (I had compressed a 150mb vid to under 1mb..talk about spongey data.)
