,speakeasy,2007-03-11T19:05Z,"For those of you unable to Google, here's a summary:

Run time approx. 50 mins

This enthralling film brings you face to face with the beautiful, yet terrifying, man - eating tigers that stalk the mangrove swamps of the the Bay of Bengal, striking fear into the heart of every living being!

This footage gives  a fascinating glimpse into the private lives of two tiger families - bringing you so close you'll hardly dare breathe!

Please note some scenes may not be recommended for viewing by young children.
[Presumably the scenes where the tigers rip ther prey limb from limb and swallow the warm bloody flesh.]"
