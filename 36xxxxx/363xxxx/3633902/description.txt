The original Microprose Falcon 4.0 (English language version) in .iso format, required for the Open Falcon 4.3 or FreeFalcon 4 (RedViper) mods.

NOTE:
Apologies for the previous bad version. This one DEFINITELY works - I've tested it on two other peoples' hardware as well as my own and all wrote to disk without problems.
