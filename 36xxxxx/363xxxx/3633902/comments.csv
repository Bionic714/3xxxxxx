,spanish_torrent,2007-03-07T02:19Z,Great initiative! Thanks!
,slugmonster,2007-03-07T02:57Z,"I'm happy to help out, and can only apologise for wasting everyone's bandwidth with the SNAFU'd copy. Thank goodness I had a copy of mkisofs lying about. Still, I enjoyed banging on my mate's door at 11pm. ""Wtf? You wanna do WHAT on my rig?? Have you been drinking???""

Blue skies and clear sixes!"
,freshsquid,2007-03-08T17:04Z,"Yeah I got this one to work. Thanks a bunch. 
I've been waiting for this for a long time. I purchased f4.0 allied force but my comp is slow and it doesnt run well on it. Finding the original f 4.0 is near impossible. "
,slugmonster,2007-03-09T00:47Z,"Good to hear you had success, freshsquid.

Forget about flying the original Falcon 4.0 though; it's buggy as hell out of the box and needs the ""1.08us"" patch to be reliable (which I don't think I still have archived). Instead try out Open Falcon or Red Viper to see just how good a nine year-old sim CAN look and fly. If either is too demanding for your rig then the previous version of FreeFalcon (FF3.1 + Cobra) may be a better choice, but check out the ""Install Guide"" at  first as ""the dance"" is a complicated process.

HTH."
,slugmonster,2007-03-09T02:25Z,"Update:

I found the f4108us.exe patch on a dusty CD and am seeding it overnight, in case anyone wants to fly Falcon 4.0 in all its original 1998 glory!"
,bsdman64,2007-04-24T03:30Z,"Thanks, slugmonster, I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever see this one again. Lost the original in a tornado.

-and the update.

Cheers!"
,danotino,2007-05-03T18:45Z,"Thanks for all your uploads.(Falcon4,OF,patch).
I'm still learning F4AF. You give me the chance to try the OF mods."
,slugmonster,2007-05-14T13:33Z,"Glad to help out. Whatever your preferred version, all have something different to offer. All you've got to lose is the disk space! "
,unterscharfuhrer,2007-06-12T04:58Z,Special Thanks to the Ass that just finished leeching this and didn't bother to seed.  You Suck
,MisterHammer,2007-08-19T15:08Z,Great seed though this sim is hideous as is and needs to be modded with either the Red Viper (AKA FF4) or the Open Falcon version.
,jrmerz,2008-09-26T14:54Z,vielen dank slugmonster habe nicht daran geglaubt das spiel noch mal zu sehen
,brice3011,2009-01-16T12:24Z,"Fantastic to find this marvellous game still around on the net!! Please seed, I promise that I will keep seeding this game for at least a year after I download it."
,brice3011,2009-01-16T12:51Z,"If anyone wants ANY patches, theatres, manuals, user guides, tactical fights missions, Free falcon mods, SP3 and SP4 packs, BMS2, Cobra patch, or anything else: just mail me at brice3010@gmail.com

The only thing I lost is my copy of Falcon 4. So happy to find it here that I will gladly return the favor."
