oded by only a few fellows 

(but since their issue of the map maker/level editor, hundreds of contributors to the maps, freely downloadable!)"
,elyk1212,2007-03-14T05:14Z,"Author's site:   http://smw.72dpiarmy.com/

Let the credit go to these great folks."
,elyk1212,2007-03-14T06:13Z,Correction: Many GPL code contributors via SVN ;)
,elyk1212,2007-03-15T02:27Z,"This game works on: Windows, Linux, Mac, Xbox"
,DeadlyBro,2007-03-15T03:41Z,I LOVE THIS GAME! Its the most addicting thing ever.

,elyk1212,2007-03-17T17:19Z,"Thx DeadlyBro.  I am so glad there are people enjoying this game, I surely am.

Please note, while I am a software/hardware engineer who dabbles in a little homebrew, I did not make this game.  The great folks at 72dpiarmy.com did :).  They rock, and you can tell them thanks on their forums or by donation, too.

One day, I am thinking of porting their game to gameboy advance, if possible (since it is open source, and if I can put aside some time to do so).  Perhaps including it as part of the normal SVN.  A big hurdle I can see, would be the 4 way serial communication required if linking with 4 friends.  Maybe I can find a library to do some of the dirty work for me ;)... and hopefully there are not some other considerations like limiting memory usage, capping the number of hardware sprites etc, in order to  port the code.  But all prob worth it for portable SMW.

Anyway, just a thought right now."

Except I'm too drunk to know what the fuck I'm doing."
,elyk1212,2007-03-18T02:59Z,"Yes, what jroc26 said is correct.   Xbins can be retrieved by logging in to the xbins IRC channel on EFNET servers.  One server that works right now is: ircd.lagged.org (on the usual port: 6667 for EFNET servers).  

Then from there follow directions on the screen to get ftp password to xbins.

From there you can download many distros of xbox homebrew {games and utilities}!

I distro'd it this way to avoid all that passoword hassle, and if folks didn't have experience with xbins.  When you all have time, I suggest trying it out, to get all the latest homebrew.  Thanks for the input,  jroc26.

Have fun everyone!"
,exterill,2007-03-18T13:47Z,"thanx for seeding.. but i really think this is a borring game, sory.."
,elyk1212,2007-03-18T23:36Z,"Yeah, well, it wasn't made by a team of 100s of people like today's production titles.  This is for core fans that like addictive fun, competitive games.

Did you know there are 100s of playing styles?   Capture the flag style, tons of power ups, you can be a hammer brother, fly,use fireballs, throw shells... I think it is like vs mode on Mario 3, on steroids.   Try out something else... that is if the graphics, Mario, or something else is not what is turning you off.  If not, it's free from the authors... so who can complain?"
,ragdoll84,2007-04-15T11:48Z,"I don't understand, why aren't there anymore regular Xbox games anymore??? there are only for 360...??"
,elyk1212,2007-04-29T18:49Z,"This one is for REGULAR Xbox.  It is just due to the category change at PirateBay (they changed the name to XBOX360)  

There no longer is a Xbox category, only XBOX360... .

but, as I mentioned this game WILL WORK on a REGULAR Xbox!  "

Hey, I wasn't checking this torrent and I missed your comment.  Anyway, if you are still reading this.  It is easy if you are using a dashboard replacement.  Please google this ""Evolution X"", etc.

If you have EvoX, you simply load the uncompressed game directory in to F:/Games/ and it will appear within your dashboard ""Play games from HD"" Menu.

That is, if you set up your INI correctly (I am giving default instructions).  Anyhow, you can set the INI file to look just about anywhere (pathwise) for games.    

I say ""just about' since some partitions would not make sense to use for games."
