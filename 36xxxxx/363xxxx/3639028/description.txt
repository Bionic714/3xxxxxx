This is a great game, and I thought should share it with you all.  Loads of fun on xbox since you can play with 4 of your friends. Note the level editor is for PC (windows, linux) only.  But once you are done making your own cool mario style level, you can download it to your Xbox to play with your friends :)  
Pretty cool, eh?
