  AFRICA: AMERICA'S NEW OIL TARGET

  As world oil reserves decline, the US and other world powers are 
competing for African oil. US energy and foreign policies have now 
merged: they militarise choke points and oil-producing countries that
can be loyal to the US. Currently 14% of US oil comes from Africa,
while experts predict that America's own national oil supply will run
out in eight years. Thus securing an energy supply is a top strategic
priority in an oil-hungry world, which explains the sudden interest
from America, Europe, China and Japan for Africa. Under the guise of
the wars against ?terror' and ?poverty' the US is setting up military
bases in West Africa and planning for a possible conflict with Europe
and China.
