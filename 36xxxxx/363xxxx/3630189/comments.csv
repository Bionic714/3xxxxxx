[T],kef71,2007-03-03T09:01Z,"Sorry guys, the 4th DVD of this series will be delayed by 16 hours. Something went wrong and the copy I have now is not working... "
[T],kef71,2007-03-03T09:17Z,"Strike my previous remark. It seems to be working. I tested on my DVD player and on my computer after a re-boot, and it seems to work just fine. If you have any problems with disc 4 in this series let me know and I will make a new copy."
,VeganFreak,2007-04-17T04:09Z,"This DVD is PAL and not NTSC!

I tried playing it on my North American ps2 and xbox360 and it said ""TV system doesn't match"".

So everyone in North America and others using NTSC formatted DVD's, take note of this!"
,constandse,2007-05-05T11:26Z,"I try to burn the isofile with Nero but it keeps crashing at 45%. It says it has a read error. Can somebody help me. I've already updated my Nero.
Does anybody else have this problem? What to do?"
,nadde84,2007-05-12T01:27Z,"Great release.

Though there seems to be something wrong with it. When watching ""Deserts"" at chapter 5 (time~47:36), with all the locusts, it switches to opening sequence of ""Caves"". Is it only me or someone else who has experienced this?"
,war59312,2007-07-01T06:39Z,"VeganFreak, use Ifo Edit to convert to NTSC in seconds... ;)"
