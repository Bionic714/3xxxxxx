,Abstracta,2007-03-07T16:39Z,"Sorry, no subs (or ""text"", as I wrote).

Just one comment about the audio:
If you get no audio when playing the movie, go to set-up and select 2.0 stereo or 5.1 surround. Looks like the movie likes to start with the DTS sound (that is removed).

,sandrew77,2007-03-07T17:07Z,yeah... any subs?
,sandrew77,2007-03-07T17:08Z,ok... thanx anyway!!!
,Cosmo333,2007-03-07T18:37Z,I own an old dutch vhs-copy of this movie. It is really cool if you´re into early 80´s horror movies. Special effects by Tom Savini ought to say it all.. Thank you!

,evilghost,2007-03-08T02:42Z,Special Effects were credited to Tom Savini but I met the man personally and he had nothing to do with them.  He was a consultant only and was very pissed off that his name was slapped on the project.  I bought the movie at a convention he was at and when I went to get him to sign it he practically threw it back at me.  He's kind of a dink in real life.

last comment is it really the cut version??"
,poppalainen,2007-03-15T23:15Z,I have an old VHS-tape and there is more gore... So this is not uncut....
,Abstracta,2007-03-16T16:20Z,"This is the UK version, so 1 (one) minute is cut. Not that much, actually ;)"
,cropsy,2007-04-06T11:30Z,"It is much when it all is about gore. Try driving a car with your eyes closed for 1 minute. ;-))))

The bloodiest gorescenes are cut from this version. All the closeups about 26 minutes into the movie and all the closeups at the end of the movie. And that is a whole lot of gore. It is pity though. I did not bother to check other scenes."
,Abstracta,2007-04-09T22:55Z,"I don't agree with you cropsy, I don't think this movie is all about gore (even thoug it have some). The thing I like about this movie, is the view into this mad man's brain. I ""enjoy"" the movie ""as is""."

My 6 year old son need to watch this."
