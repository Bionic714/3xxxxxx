,10 cats and counting,2007-03-05T22:18Z,"I really look forward to experiencing
this DVD. I just got the audio book and
it was breath taking! Some of it painful
and liberating to hear. Once again,
thanks and God Bless!"
,10 cats and counting,2007-03-07T03:35Z,"I noticed the download speed is terribly slow.
I am now at 41.6% at a rate of 0.3 kbs now.
My upload speed is at 42.4 kbs wich often goes higher
My current ISP bandwidth is at 622 kbps.
If it's possible, can anyone seed faster?
Sorry for the complaint. Thank you."

That is why most people stay in the pack, and some people rise from it. Those some people are open minded and the pack is not (or is just too scared to show it). Yup, that was quite philosophical, but it's sure is the truth."

,netuserlla,2007-08-01T00:42Z,"I don't know why the file size says that it is 4.02gb
 Really it is 4.35gb.
This is easy to burn and watch. Nero & K3B works great. Your welcome UL people. Plez share."
,roherin,2008-04-06T09:48Z,"Really good quality. However there is a problem with the startmenu. You can't start the film normally (from the button ""reveal the secret"") You have to go to chapters and start the first one. Furthermore, There are no subtitles at all in this one. Not even english for the hearingimpaired. Don't let this scare you though. It is truly amazing... THE SECRET !!!"
,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:29Z,"If you are interested in this subject matter, you will definitely want to get the following torrent: 

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

,GN85,2008-07-21T07:26Z,Wow I've never actually seen this much fluff in a DVD before. The whole fucken movie can be summed up in a single sentence: what you believe in will become true.

This is the way the Universe operates, by the ""Law Of Attraction."" 

It's only crap to brain-dead morons who can't see the truth when it's right in front of their face !!!"
,Skye3,2011-02-10T18:03Z,"Please seed.
