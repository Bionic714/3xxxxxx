I have a good archive building.. this will be a nice addition.. and when I'm through, I'll be seeding, not just this, but packages of video's and discographies... look for me on soulseek as user 'Die Laughing' or on www.mininova.com for my torrents.. TPB always reject my code when uploading a torrent, don't know why.. but it does."
