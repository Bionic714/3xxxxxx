Solo shoots first.
No ultra-lame CGI Jabba.
No stupid fractal rings around explosions.
No belching frogs or "Three Stooges" droids.

-- This is the original unmolested Star Wars, painstakingly recreated and fan-edited by "EditDroid" from several different sources of media to faithfully archive the theatrical release (see comments below).

"Alien" subtitles are now external (and shut off by default, so you'll have to select them in you player) rather than hard-subbed.

Enjoy, and also catch all the other EditDroid, ADitigalMan, AngrySun and Phantom Edit DVD torrents.
