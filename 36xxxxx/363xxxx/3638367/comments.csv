,wwefan,2007-03-13T11:49Z,Got this from alt.binaries.erotica
,wwefan,2007-03-17T13:21Z,this isn't password protected... just as all the rest of the files i've thrown out here on TPB aren't.
,krackaboi,2007-03-20T06:47Z,"when I downloaded it, I didn't find any password protection.  Did anyone else not have a problem with a password?"
,wwefan,2007-03-20T06:54Z,"I just checked the properties of the file in Adobe Acrobat reader and it says Document Open Password: NO.  I go it from newsgroup, just as I said I did.  I can still open the file and it don't ask me for a password, so I don't know what the problem is.  I'm sure not everyone has that problem, otherwise there would be more comments out of the 1634 times it was downloaded with 95 seeders and 19 people still leeching it."
,WEagle,2007-03-21T00:14Z,Got the same problem as well when trying to open the pdf document. When I double click on it I get Playboy April 2007 (Secured) and I can't open it. So yeah it's password protected.
,malayarock,2007-03-28T20:17Z,it's probably your parents have parental control over your computer. there's no password ask here.
,GraSSy12,2007-04-15T03:19Z,no password here
,white_fox,2007-04-23T07:26Z,"that was a different release

,PriTel03,2007-04-27T00:52Z,"It works just fine, it is a PDF, not a RAR file, there is no password. I have no idea what these other idiots are complaining about or what they downloaded, because it works just fine. Thanks for the upload wwefan."
