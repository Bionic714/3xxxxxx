  i just did it easy as pie. 

  No Kidding. 
check this out.  go find a copy of old version 5. washer. 

  put it on your system but don use it. 

  click update.   it asks you for your name and email address and it will send you the download link and a code to enter. 

  i know - sounds fked up.  But I just did it and it sent me the updated version download for 2011 and a code good till next year.    with updates and everything.  when its over I will just do it again. 

  cool man.  seriously.  do it - 6.6.0.67  "
