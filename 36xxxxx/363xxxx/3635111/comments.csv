,pollenised,2007-03-25T12:00Z,great up - many thanks.
,urbanspaceman,2007-04-08T13:57Z,"I'm in the middle of downloading this on to my MacBook, and when I checked the videos that have finished they were all black (no video)!  But I found a way to fix it.  Open in QT player, press command J, and deselect the Video Track 2 check box.  Resave the video, and it's now fine."
,MonsterCow,2007-05-16T19:30Z,For what version of Ableton Live?
,Snooze Alrlma,2007-07-10T22:28Z,"Du, subkult. varför lägger du upp filer och sen inte seedar?! har stått stilla med hitlers bödlar i snart 2 veckor nu....jävla idiot. det är såna som du som inte förstår meningen med torrents"
,wytchkraft,2007-12-19T00:14Z,great video but kind of glitchy all my friends that down loaded it have the same issue
,korvbuss,2008-01-22T21:03Z,Is ther anybody whos got Ask Video for Cubase 4?
,tgrantw,2008-01-27T05:11Z,"This is a tutorial for Ableton Live 5. However the program is very similar to version 6 and 7 so this video is fine if you are a beginner. 

If you have problems w/ no video you can also use ""VLC"" and they will play fine in there."
,pstoaling,2008-02-01T11:47Z,"All I have is black screen with only audio. What a waste of time, unless someone knows how to run them properly?"
,korvbuss,2008-02-01T19:10Z,"Great upload, Can someone please upload 
Ask Video Cubase 4"
,madmaxpt,2008-03-01T13:19Z,@pstoaling: my best guess is that you're missing some codecs to play the video. You can also try downloading VLC and play them with that.
,sk8rulez900,2008-05-28T16:51Z,"URBANSPACEMAN- THANKS! that worked for me!!! but i downloaded this really fast but deleted coz didnt worked...¬¬ now i saw your comment and i'm downloading again! ¬¬ now only 20kb/s ¬¬

THE SOLUTION FOR THE BLACK SCREEN:

Open in QT player, press command J, and deselect the Video Track 2 check box. Resave the video, and it's now fine.

cheers"
,sk8rulez900,2008-05-28T16:52Z,oh! and thanks to Subkult! =]

,Seboz,2009-01-07T15:20Z,...this is such a great torrent if you want to learn all about Ableton Live .... thanx very much for the upload ...!!!!
,Tetsuno,2009-02-12T13:39Z,"This is a fuckin shit. Just black screen.
The QuickTime is the most worst player on the planet..
Where can I choose the video tracks?
Where works the ""command J""? Cos do NOT in the QT player."
,sefology,2009-06-22T08:46Z,"thank you subkult & urbanspaceman.

& Tetsuno, you need to have the video open and then press ""command j"" and your your window will pop up. then you can get down to buisness"
,pawnone,2010-11-16T04:14Z,I get zero seeders please seed....
,dnp0121,2011-01-19T23:54Z,"hey all, failed to get it to play on my mac with either VLC or quicktime, but switched to mplayer and it worked fine."
,saamwing93,2011-03-30T20:15Z,"how big are the differenses betwen the verisions? I have live 8, is this for me?"
,Daiquirii,2011-08-19T15:52Z,"Why are all of you such idiots? Don't you realize VLC is the program of choice to run practically every single video torrent on tpb? Go get VLC already, for fuck's sake."
,bobtheiphonenob,2011-09-27T01:20Z,@Daiquirii //\\ - Well Said!!
,marvin73,2012-04-17T22:48Z,"Like tgrantw says video problems end if you download the free media player “VLC” and play the video on it. The lessons are the best, clear and good. Thank you for the help."
,milesht,2012-07-13T17:37Z,can i get a seed on this please
