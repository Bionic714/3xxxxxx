,stardude,2007-03-15T03:20Z,"No worries skuggan =)

You will want to make sure you set your torrent client to Super Seed in order to get the files out to most people the fastest.

Good luck! =)"
,skuggan,2007-03-15T03:53Z,"yea, you never know when someone else will upload, with a fast conn, might be 2mins after.. might be 5hours after.. just trying to help as much as i can.."
,stardude,2007-03-15T04:02Z,"In about 15 minutes it will be in the hands of a couple of top swarmers so it'll be all good =)

http://stage6.divx.com/members/629293/videos/1153891

stage6 is a video uploading service much like youtube, except with a 2gb size limit, and it doesn't destroy the videos. you can choose to watch clips in fullscreen or download them."

,waltonicus,2007-03-15T11:53Z,"I've got a 349.4Mb .avi file out of the .rar archive, but when I try to play it with Quicktime, RealPlayer [spit], or my DivX player, I just get five seconds of a green screen and nothing else... is this a dud file? Do I need a different player / codec? I'm seeding, but don't want to pass around something that's not what it seems. Thanks! "
,dudew8,2007-03-15T12:39Z,thx for this megafast download skuggan!!!!! ;)
,Qeenix,2007-03-15T12:53Z,Thanks skuggan! :)

,sk_few,2007-03-15T18:15Z,"thomsol: I only download RAR-files because its hard for anti-pirategroup to se what you actually download. Of course its hard to trace stuffs via. torrents, but your internet-supplier can still check what you download ect. Its quite easy for them to search all downloads with .avi at the end ;) anyway, if you think your supplier will never report you to the police, then you got no problem. 

Anywayz, thanks for the upload skuggan. "
,skuggan,2007-03-15T18:46Z,"Its a scene release.. the way the group who recorded the show released it.. a couple of years ago it was really helpful (when connections were slower) but nowadays its kinda useless... but i'll continue upload rared shit untli the scene changes the ""rules""...

Thx for the comments tho, means alot."
,skuggan,2007-03-15T18:49Z,thomsol: i forgot... the rar in this case has never been about saving space.. read http://whyrar.omfg.se/index_eng.php for more info regarding that.
,petercrouch,2007-03-15T19:08Z,Thanks Skuggan!!

,dsrs,2007-03-17T11:46Z,"i have downloaded two different versions of this caph release. neither one will play on my home dvd player, after the first few seconds of dialog.
i suppose other people just watch on the computer. fuck that.
releases, like the movies from aaxxxoo, should be BURN TESTED"
,thomsol,2007-03-17T17:23Z,"God damnit, I hope you fucking rott in hell!! My DVD player says this codec is not supported! What the fuck did u use to rip it?? A VHS player?! Get off the fucking scene, and let people who KNOWS how to do it, do it! Every other episode, from the beginning of season 01, works on my player, exept this one, by ""Caph""!
I actually hope you die. Bastard."
,thomsol,2007-03-17T17:35Z,"Skuggan, that link you posted about WhyRAR... It said people who don't know what they are doing, put together an .avi file, without raring it.. In other words, people like aXXo, they don't know what they are doing? Yeah right, that's logical... Rar sucks ass."
,skuggan,2007-03-18T11:48Z,"chill dude, dont fucking tell me to do anything, its your own fucking decision to download stuff.
Im not ripping this shit myself you ignorant asshole. You know you could just have mentioned that this release wont play on your DVD player, and make alternative suggestions to people whom might also have the same problem (2HD did in fact make a proper of this release) You did not on the other hand have to threaten to kill me.. thats just too far.

And the ""whyrar"" site was just a link dude, to expllain to you whats rar i s all about.. i was not saying anything about ""groups"" like aXXo suck, it was an informative website, for your consideration.

And i do apologize if your comment was aimed at the group and not me.. was kinda hard to tell from the way you wrote it.

Dont hat the player, hate the game."
,thomsol,2007-03-18T21:14Z,"It was aimed at the asshole who ripped it, and if it wasn't you, then ignore it. Bottom line is, anyways, that it should be posted that it's a different codec.
What the hell is the POINT of ripping in some strange codec, which most DVD players do not support? "
,skuggan,2007-03-18T22:27Z,"I totally agree with you, and im so sorry for the harsh words.. i got kinda carried away.

At the time of uploading i had no knowledge of this release not working on some standalone players, and since i have dualmonitors connected to my cpu i never burn stuff.

Byt since i learned about this i just had to try, and this release did in fact play without any errors on my sony player.. But im fully aware of this not working with some other ones.

So if they decide to continue ripping, lets hope they learn how to do it propoerly so everyone can enjoy it!

Gonna play some STALKER now and see if thats any good.. cya! and sorry for the trashtalk once again."
,thomsol,2007-03-18T23:17Z,"Glad we came to an agreement! Have a good one! (gamingsession, that is)"
,davematband41,2007-03-20T11:43Z,"You two dudes are homo's for fighting over one of the worst things put on tv ever.  Seriously, find a hobby.  

I download this show to show students who are learning beginner level English.  It's obviously written for schmucks like you both with tiny little brains. Fuck off, I got work to do. "
,Ninia123,2007-03-20T16:24Z,i Dont Know What You all are bitching about but i Just recoded It And Now it work fine....
,thomsol,2007-03-22T16:18Z,"davematband41 : LOL! And REALLY loud too! 
Since when did arguing over a torrent, make people homosexual? 
If YOU are a teacher, I'd hate to be in your class... If you really hate this show, why the hell do you even bother reading the comments on the torrent? You really have issues! :D And, is downloading ripped TV shows included in the class? Real classy, moron. I never asked for your opinion, and IF I want it, I'll GIVE it to you!
Have a nice day!
PS: I really doubt you're a teacher. My guess is that you have thick glasses, and lives in the basement of your mothers house, and never leaves the house, because you in fact have no friends, and therefore you instead spend your time looking up forums etc, where you can let your anger against your father (who probably left your mother alone with you) ((and we can all see why...)) run free. Don't need a degree to figure that out. 
peace and love, DUDE! :D"
,thomsol,2007-03-22T16:19Z,"Ninia123: Depends what you're playing it back on... It works fine with WMP, or VLC, on your computer, but 98 % of DVD players won't play it back."
