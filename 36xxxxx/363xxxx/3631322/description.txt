skAI Traffic v1.1 Update
                             ========================


This update will fix some reported errors on traffic not departing.
(staying parked at the gate)


Tested on KSEA, KDEN and LFPG with 100% traffic.


All small and major airliners seem to depart and arrive normally and frequently now.


Thanks for letting me know! Keep it coming.


Happy landings,
PopArt ;-)


Just install in  your root FS directory.
