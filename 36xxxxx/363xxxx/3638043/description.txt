The Freedom Press 1973 translation of Malatesta's classic.

The versions I've come across online so far are shorter and different.

This is a new 1973, 1994 translation from the Italian original by Vernon
Richards, that, according to the translator, ?makes no ?cuts? in the original
text and seeks to render Malatesta?s thought and way of expressing himself
as literally as possible?.

In plain text, html as well as in a4 -> a5 booklet pdf ready for printing.
