The Testimony of Those that Jesus has shown Heaven and Hell.

On May 6, 2006 in San Mateo, California, Jesus opened up my eyes and allowed me to view Him dancing at the edge of Heaven. He then baptized me with The Holy Spirit and Fire as promised by John The Baptist. The Holy Spirit energized my apartment for Several hours while we listened to U2?s album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. I swear this is the Truth in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.  Michael Theade

The More You Share the More Shares You will Receive, may Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Lonnnng and prosper.

May you Die with a wrinkled face and a new Heart. (from U2)
