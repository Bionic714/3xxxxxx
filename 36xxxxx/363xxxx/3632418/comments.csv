						Error code 0x800040055

"" A Problem is preventing Windows from accurately checking the license for this computer. Error code 0x80004005 ""

This article is appointed to people that have this error after they use my file "" Make windows Xp genuine Forever ""

This windows error tells that this copy of windows in this computer does not have any key or license to use even 
it was Vaild or blocked key ""Vlk"" , it comes becouse that copy of Windows was not activated at all it 
just had been Cracked to stop the 30 days time limit or "" Evoulation Copy "" .

Soulotion

1. Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Activate Windows.
Or Just Click ---> Start ----> Run ----> type ""oobe/msoobe /a"".

2. Click Yes, I want to telephone a customer service representative to active Windows now. 

4. Select the Change Product Key option .

5. Enter this Key "" V2C47-MK7JD-3R89F-D2KXW-VPK3J "" .

6. Click Update and close the window .


Now Your Copy Has a Product Key .

If You test with the diagnostic Tool that Included Whith The File "" Make windows Xp genuine Forever ""
It will tell you that your copy of windows Is genuine .

So why still you have to use "" Make windows Xp genuine Forever "" ?

If Microsoft Block this key and you update your computer it will stop Being Genuine and you also 
get Notifications Of Windows Genuine Advantage as a surprise From Microsoft , and they will block this Key Someday.
