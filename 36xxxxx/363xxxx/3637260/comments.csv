one thing though ~ within the 'how-to' it suggests to use with VMWare. Great idea, however I am getting the same error as szucsati: ""Unable to validate your Thinstall license. Please contact technical support""
any thoughts?"

if you create a thinstall file you have to crack it or update it with the tool. patch 3.034. then it wil work."
