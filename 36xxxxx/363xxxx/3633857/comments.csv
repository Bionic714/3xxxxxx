I really don't understand why people take the time to put together a Torrent, Seed it, but they don't take five seconds to write an explanatory comment on the file..."

,snarstad,2007-03-07T23:48Z,"macintosh-users pay a lot for hardware and software, but when it comes to sharing we're cheap..."
,xtraa,2007-03-08T04:51Z,"@snarstad:

No. Many of them are freeware and others are highly overpriced. 

I dislike the fact to pay for a program like QT Pro, and then for some reason am not able to watch all codecs no matter what.

This is not my problem, it is a software problem, and they can deal with it like they want...

I deal with it like I want. "

,pippi2k3,2007-03-09T00:45Z,How do I install the codecs?!
,snarstad,2007-03-09T15:05Z,Drop them in Library/QuickTime/

,philsh,2007-03-28T17:55Z,Thanks - great package!  Had some already but not all of them.
,vide8,2007-11-20T06:18Z,This is a great amount of work someone put into this. I spent a long time getting most of these codecs available as third-party extensions. They really make QuickTime work well with all of these new formats becoming available. It seems to come with the territory as we are trading all over the world. It means we have to adjust to all of our different ways of saying the same thing. Thanks!!
