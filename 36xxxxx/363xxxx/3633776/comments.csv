does anyone know the proper reason?"

-----------
PROPER REASON : Here we go again folks.  Last week we were dismayed when FpN

released the HR of Heroes. One of our experts took a look at it and noticed

that when playing back the rip through SPDIF and on a Sony receiver the show

was prone to dropping out of 5.1 to 2.0 at most of the commercial breaks as

well as other random spots. Hmm, could FpN used some sort of stream fix to 

remove troubled areas. Another one of our friends checked it on his sony receiver

and it had the same problem. Not to mention widespread chatter about the problem.

We didn't do anything about it in the end hoping another grp would step up to 

the plate. They didn't. FLASH FORWARD to this week, FpN wins again by capping

the Canadian feed and while LOL thankfully got the 350mb rls, a quality grp 

was not fast enough to beat FpN. Perhaps FpN would fix their errors and learn

how to not mangle the AC3 feed in the process. NOPE, not such a case, so now

this is a trend with them and we felt we had to put them in their place.



So, if your trying to play back your AC3 files through SPDIF or just want the

best glitch free release that works on ALL players/receivers flawlessly like

scene rips should then grab this proper. If you don't know what SPDIF is and

didn't notice a problem then don't. Your choice. All said, we gave em a chance

to fix their problem, they didn't, so now we do.





Enjoy!"
