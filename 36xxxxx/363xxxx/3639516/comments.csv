,sweeznit,2007-03-18T18:38Z,"You arent even seeding right now so how can other people download it to seed once their download is complete? If you seed me to 100% ill seed for a long time.

You dont even have the .cue and .dvd file with this if your going to burn it on a DVD+R Dual Layer disc."
,BuNgi3 HuNt3r,2007-03-20T08:30Z,"Sorry, for some reason it says i am seeding for some people but not others but you still should be able to get to 100%

and as for what you have to do, i'm going to add a tutorial to my site on what to do with it soon.
or add me on AIM (BuNgi3 HuNt3r) and MSN (bungi3hunt3r@hotmail.com) and i'll tell you what to do with it."
,BuNgi3 HuNt3r,2007-03-23T23:59Z,"Can i make this clear, if you plan on hotswapping, you do not need the .cue or .dvd file, all you need is the iso. Once u have the iso u can either inject all the maps except midship and mod them on xbox live or visit my site and i'll soon post a way to mod all the maps. "
