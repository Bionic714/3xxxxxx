Secondly, why do all tpb users immediately stop seeding once they get the whole file.  Give me a fuckin break man.  You guys need to seed until at least five other people get the file.  If you're not going to do this, don't use tpb b/c you suck."

It will finally fuckin' finish, then go download Stadium Arcadium somewhere else. I have it on vinyl, and I am thinking about ripping it, as I heard the analog mix is superior to that of the CD. Vinyl mastered by Steve Hoffman. Think it would go over here? "
