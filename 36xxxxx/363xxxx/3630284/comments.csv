,KevtheGreenman,2008-06-19T13:16Z,"Thanks very much for this - I haven't heard ""Live at the Marquee"" for 30 years and it still sounds great! Note: the Live at the Marquee folder here contains ""Do anything you wanna do"" which was not on the orginal E.P. it opened with ""96 Tears"" which can be found as track 16 on the Teenage depression album which is also part of this download as can ""Gloria/Satisfaction in the original format of one track without a break."
