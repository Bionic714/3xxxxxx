,beyondunreal,2007-12-14T15:34Z,"@Nossie  NEGATIVE DELTA TIME FIX


Goto UT2003 folder --> System --> Rightclick on UT2003.exe --> Go to Compatibility --> Select Compatibility mode for Windows 98 

That should fix it."
,Endofsilence,2008-03-02T09:41Z,"I have never downloaded a game before so I don't really know how it works and all, what do I do when it asks for the 2nd disc?"
,Endofsilence,2008-03-02T09:43Z,"I guess I must open AutoRun.exe, but it won't open for some reason. Can anyone help me?"
,Endofsilence,2008-03-02T10:19Z,"Ok, I understand I must use a program called DAEMON Tools, I've downloaded it already, what to do now?"
,Endofsilence,2008-03-02T10:42Z,"Ok, I have figured out how the installation works and I have succesfully installed it now. But when I start the game it says: Wrong disc in drive. Please insert the disc labelled 'Unreal Tournament Play Disc' to continue. 

Now, i have inserted all the disc but none of them work. What should I do?"
,Endofsilence,2008-03-02T11:19Z,"I need some help, after I installed it it says that the wrong disc is inserted and it also says something about core.dll that can't be found. Please, is there someone who knows what I should do? I'm pretty desperate to play this game."
,Seger400,2008-04-20T04:13Z,I got the same problem as Endofsilence and its pissing me off! Have placed the crack in my UT2003 map but it still doesn't work! What am i doing wrong? or its the crack bad?
,Espionage724,2008-05-11T22:00Z,"Don't use a crack...just update to latest patch and you will not need a CD/DVD

Also UT2004 is way better then this in my opinion. This one isn't bad though..."

,Mutha111,2011-02-25T15:57Z,"Works great....no problem with install or crack....I did it all using Deamon Tools. I suggest you restart your computer, before you do the `crack` process. In your install directory, theres a folder named ``System``, copy/paste your crack icon in that folder...."
,mythmore,2011-03-12T01:58Z,"The game works on XP SP3 32Bit
