,Haawko,2007-03-03T19:05Z,"This thing works like magic, but after using it I discovered a process named conime.exe, which I'm sure wasn't there before.

A google search told me that this was BFghost, a remote administration tool. I figure it was a part of the activator in some way, but it's a remote administration tool, so maybe someone in CLoNY can use this to get remote access to everyone who has used the activator?

A part from that, it's a great piece of work from CLoNY. :'D"

For x86 windows vista (32 bit) there is a new my crack that really activate your Vista.

NO Timerstopper
NO modify your Vista bootloader!

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3631799/Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator.4st.March-CLoNY

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY' 
you can install the new one with no problem without fresh installation.

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.1-CLoNY' or
'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.2' you can use Vista Manager Pro
to rebuilt the bootloader and than you can apply the new one.

Download the software:
http://www.vistabootpro.org

Guide:
In Vista Manager Pro select 'BootLoader', select 'Reinstall the original bootloader'
and then click 'Apply'.

For x64 Windows Vista (64bit) I suggest, for now, to continue to use
'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY'

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3618299/Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY

,ymeapu,2007-03-13T06:16Z,i can't get this crack to work. my pc gets BSOD when booting. i have gateway 6391 notebook with intel motherboard. many thanks CLoNY!!!
,cng1101,2007-03-18T09:21Z,"This Activator works beautiful on Vista Ultimate x64.  If only I can remove the bootloader in bootup.  Only problem is after I installed this activator, My Floppy drive is not showing up now.  Tried to uninstall but still showing up activated and with bootloader, Only way to get back Floppy drive is to reimage."
