,dio666,2008-11-11T06:43Z,"Spacy, Tarpley has forgotten more about human history and the humanities than you will ever know. Your naive world view is as primitive as the guttural and animalistic way in which you attack those who would seek the truth.

I can only imagine it is nice and comfortable in your cocoon of ignorance and thus you do not wish to even consider the argument before you, despite it being articulate and well sourced. One can only speculate as to why you would need to reinforce an apparent hoax, as to the subjectivity of that need and its causes; however, what is certain is that you stand in rare company by espousing such a perspective. By all means do ignore the evidence, and viciously attack anyone who would seek to inform others with ad hominem dissimulation of character, but this will neither silence those who seek the truth nor will it diminish the veracity of Their arguments."
