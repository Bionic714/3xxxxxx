,sondela,2007-03-11T06:31Z,"I have never understood the ""upload but no seeding"" thing....very funny to make people waiting and trying downloading a file thatÂ´s never gonna show up on the computer....ASSHOLE!"
,DracisDraconian,2007-03-11T07:10Z,Seems aududms is doing this quite often. That user has had other files just recently here with no upload at all.
,crankup,2007-03-12T21:42Z,"oh well, maybe it wasn't meant to be.....pity about the wasted bandwidth....."
,audidms,2007-04-01T03:39Z,"Folks, I leave these on to seed about 7-10 days, 24 hours a day. That is plenty long enough to download. There is only so much hard drive space, & I wait until the torrent shows prolonged inactivity, before removing it. & although it may take me awhile to recheck old uploads, I will put anything back on that anyone requests. That's as good as I think can be done."

,MeesterDaveed,2009-04-18T14:55Z,"i'm downloading it currently, and it says there are 5 seeds, what are you assholes whining about...? also, don't forget, it's free, so you have NO RIGHT to whine about ANYTHING on here. i'll say something bout the quality when i finish"
,tulsafag,2011-01-13T04:48Z,"WOW did I just read that. A person Uploads and converts a old dvd or more likely in this case a VHS, anyway takes the time to help us out and present a video for our amusement and someone writes a bitchy complaint, and to top the whole thing off, the uploader adds an addendum explaining himself. HEY audidms, no offence but QUIT BEING MEEK, the assholes are everywhere, tell them to _____ _____ ____ ___!! you fill in the rest."
