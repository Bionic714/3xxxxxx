Jim Jarmusch's "Night On Earth" (1991)



Winona Ryder, Roberto Benigni, Beatrice Dalle, Armin Mueller-Stahl



DVDrip, regular divx, 123 min., English, no subs



This one comes in original language with no subs (the DVD just came with German subs, sorry). That means English, Italian and Finnish. Skip the Finnish episode - too depressive anyway. But check out Roberto Benigni ... a classic ... he didn't get a Best-Male-Oscar for no reason a couple of years later and made Tom Hanks a sore loser.
