Tom Waits scored the movie...that's worth mentioning, too."
,frogman9,2007-03-13T20:49Z,"this sure is a great movie, but with no subs...
well, to all the Finns who speak English & Italian (no one speaks Finnish as a foreign language): enjoy the movie :D"

,verdent,2009-03-03T17:26Z,"For anybody wanting to watch this movie in english the download is definitely worthwhile but I was suprised to see the later parts of the film which are all naturally subtitled aren't hardsubbed in this version, fortunately though the link provided by AnotherStranger does fix this problem.  thanks for the up lascruces!"
