,Fredddooo,2011-06-03T01:41Z,"You have to extract the DeuxEx_GOTY_1.rar file and then mount DeuxEx_GOTY_1.img file in DT/Alcohol/other.

When mounting, next to the filename, don't forget to change option ""All image files"" (or similar) for option ""All files"" to be able to see the .img file in the extracted folder"
