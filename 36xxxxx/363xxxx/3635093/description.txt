What's it about?
Deus Ex is set in the near future. It's a grim time to live, with a widening chasm between rich and poor, and a mysterious plague called the Gray Death sweeping across the world. There is a manufactured cure, called Ambrosia, but the tiny supply is controlled by government agencies (namely FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and carefully doled out to the most important people, including government officials, celebrities, and the social elite. The average joe who contracts Gray Death is often left to wither away and die in the gutter because of the supply problems.

An underground group called the NSF is convinced that the Gray Death is part of a huge conspiracy to eliminate the underclass. They work against the government to hijack Ambrosia shipments and distribute them to the proletariat. In response, the government dispatches their anti terrorist agency, UNATCO, against the NSF and other groups who have banded together against the government.
