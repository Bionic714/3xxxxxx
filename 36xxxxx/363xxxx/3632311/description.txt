This point of sale software is actually provided free* by the company to use in a store with a single register. It is free however they charge $30 to mail you the newest version. This program is about a month old and is regularly updated from the website. www.camcommerce.com

This pos has many great things that the expensive pos like quickbooks have and also some they normaly don't include. It does have a built in accounting software although I am not sure if you can export sales information.

It uses open sql server to and u can look information up via odbc however you can't write to the database

The only downside of this program ~ for me at least!  They provide no way to upload a text file or .cvs of your inventory unless you get this $200 program from them called Import Star.  If anybody happens to get it or figures out a way to import files a different way. Please let me know

I got frustrated looking for quickbooks pos 6 and they version 4 wasn't vista compatible so I am using this instead.

extract the folder with izarc
