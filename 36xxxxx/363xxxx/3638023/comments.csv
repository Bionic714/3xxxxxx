,ih8skids,2007-03-12T22:52Z,Right category. Thanks kollll I have been waiting for this.
,ih8skids,2007-03-12T22:56Z,Well since it's a missing part of a dvd then yes it is in the right category.
,liverpool_one,2007-03-12T23:02Z,"why are there so many arseholes on here that just seem to go through all torrents looking for ones that are in wrong category or any other thing they can find wrong.
get a life ffs"
,ih8skids,2007-03-12T23:08Z,Using your logic any sample vob file or any nfo file that goes with the movie should be put in a totally different category as well. Why don't you go and do something productive with your time and stop being a troll. I guess when your old you can tell your grandchildren all about the great life you had telling people on the pirate bay that their stuff is in the wrong category. Get a life and go get laid fag.
,ih8skids,2007-03-12T23:11Z,Thanks again kollll!!! GREAT JOB!!! Needed this fix. Keep uploading your fixes in this category. Even if it does nothing else but give this loser more of a reason to have no life.
,ih8skids,2007-03-12T23:15Z,That's it? That's your comeback? Obviously you know I'm right cause all you can do is insult people instead of arguing your position. 
,ih8skids,2007-03-12T23:18Z,"Well. I'm gonna go out and do something. You should give it a shot sometime instead of trolling your entire life. Who knows, you might even get a job or maybe even be able to move out of your parent's basement. Not likely though. Later. And, thanks once again kollll. Keep 'em coming!!"
