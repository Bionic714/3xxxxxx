,wirthith,2007-06-12T14:31Z,Download this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3705425/Magic_Video_Converter_8.0.2.18_(The_Ultimate_Video_Converter)  if u want this on ure ipod! very great convert program if u chose ipod video format as output every episode gets 30 - 50 mb !
,SamMckey,2007-09-03T22:45Z,so if series 6 is labelled 5 then where is 5?
,Luffarn12,2008-01-24T16:33Z,"Can i use it as an mp4 file?

I mean can i put it in my iPod?"
,Fanx,2008-02-17T10:21Z,"Don't talk rubbish - there's no season 6 here! Season 5 is correctly labeled as season 5. The confusion is only caused by the Brits labelling the second part of season 4 as season 5 (and season 5 as season 6). 

If you're a Brit and you think you know better - you don't! Learn the real episode numbers, for fuxache!"
,skoolboyerror,2008-03-06T16:39Z,some of the episodes dont work.? 
,Wopatoolie,2008-06-09T05:16Z,"fanx was there a reason for acting like a used douchebag?  what did you do download this whole set for FREE and the only problem you had was knowing how to straighten the episodes out yourself in a cpl of clicks? its kinda rare but once in a while i find a bigger used douchebag than the last used douchebag, and u get the award til the next used douchebag, congrats."
,carsten.666,2008-06-20T09:52Z,use imdb if ther`s any doubt abouth the numbering
