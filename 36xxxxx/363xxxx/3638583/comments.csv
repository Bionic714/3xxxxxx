,gerry1952,2011-10-22T11:54Z,"This is an excellent film. It has no dark underlying themes running through it, that's just rubbish. Every generation of children grew up with Tom & Jerry; it's a animated film for kids, that's all."
,rist9,2012-02-23T11:54Z,"Its ok. The kid I showed it to seemed to like it. I remember I liked it when I was little. I didn't see why such critisism is on this, sure, its not the same as the lil episodes. But it still is good. When I was little I enjoyed it more than the small series. While grown up, sure small series win by longrun, but this doesn't change what experience I had when little."
