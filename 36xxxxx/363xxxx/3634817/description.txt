******************************************************
Not my rip.

Use MIS Info Video(free) for a continues play/resume.
You will see the time remaining for the whole movie and
not just for one file. Perfect for 1.4 Gig movies on 
2 CDs. For the curious, if you stop a movie, check the
.MIR(resume file).

******************************************************
Info2MIS v2.0.0B10 is free. It's the app's that I 
used to create the .MIS. It can also extract
information from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, 
amazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a second with an episode on tv.com(find page) and
only 2 clicks for a movies from imdb.com(with picture)

player. It's a frontend/player.

"Building Torrent Descriptions Made Easy with bbcode.txt":
I have made a tutorial for a private site. With this, you
can create a proper description that the admins will like.
They hate, and users too, when the description is frankly 
too small. I have seen just the file name in a NFO with
no codec info or plot... Use this instead. :D 
You can copy it to other forum but [code] may not be 
supported.
