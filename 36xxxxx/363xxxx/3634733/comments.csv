,MASTER_NINJA,2007-03-21T09:18Z,"Dear Andrew, 
Why do you keep flooding this forum with this republican shit, in fact very right wing republican shit ? We're all here for the music and the FZ community and nobody, really nobody, will change his/her mind by reading your crap. And yes, we all know your points of view by now. So no need to go on and on and on........  
Unless of course you are fucking CIA and monitoring peoples reactions and behaviour. Putting them on a black list, destination secret jails in Poland  

regards 
LudzNL 

p.s. There's only one thing you really need to explain to me. How come you love Frank, who really detested everything you stand for? I don't get it at all
