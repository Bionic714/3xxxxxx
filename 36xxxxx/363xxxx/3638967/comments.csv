Although I could not find the 'trail file' that was mentioned in the patch manual.
Let?s hope it keeps working, after the 30 day?s trail period."

,kjelle392,2007-03-24T09:42Z,Patch does not work. NOT activating the product beyond 30-days trial....
,PEPPI.nl,2007-03-24T13:21Z,True. It is already starting to annoy me with activation reminders.
