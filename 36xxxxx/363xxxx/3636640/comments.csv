,Jack Sprat,2007-03-11T16:19Z,I'm still the only one seeding so far. I hope that you guys will stick around a while and seed after you've gotten 100% of this. This is a great video set! I bought it yesterday and if I can't find a good quality NTSC copy I may buy the 2nd Queen compilation as well. Anyone have it?
,Jack Sprat,2007-03-14T00:33Z,Some of you had better start seeding! I've seeded long enough.
,Jack Sprat,2007-03-22T21:56Z,"Well, That's it for me. I've been seeding this since March 11th and hope that those who are still seeding will stick around. I've received no real comments other than a whiner to ""seed"", which I'd been doing all this time. For 400 downloads, you'd think there'd be more seeding this awesome DVD. Oh well, You get what you give."

,oakey55,2007-04-22T05:04Z,Over a couple of weeks I've seen up to 9 seeders listed but I have not gotten past 46.3%. Could someone please seed this so some of us can complete? I've not seen more than that completed copies yet the speed listed in BitTornado.
