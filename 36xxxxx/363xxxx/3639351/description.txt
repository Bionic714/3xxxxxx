Rls Notes                                           
Error Corrective have been involved within the   
psychedelic scene now for a number of years and   
their coming together with Wildthings Records has 
given them a solid foothold to be able to         
experiment and obtain a release schedule to get   
their music out to the trance world and to be     
able to focus on the completion of their album.   
They have performed recently at the Glade         
electronic music and dance festival within the   
U.K and have had the opportunity to play their   
music at events globally bringing them a greater 
fan base which has helped increase demand for     
their music within the scene
