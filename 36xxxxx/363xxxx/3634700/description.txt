├êXODO:
Today Africa is inhabited by the modern man. But, why a group of ancestors his embarked in a trip of centuries to colonize all the corners of the planet? 30,000 years ago, the man had replaced to all the hominides ones of Europe and Asia, and for about 10,000 years he has been occupying all the American continent, where he happened via Siberia. Although it seems incredible, already 60,000 years ago the man arrived at Australia, in a passage of thousands of kilometers in uncertain primitive boats. What lead the man to send itself to such adventures?

The 6 first documentary ones are of the BBC and respond to numerous questions on our evolution: Who were our ancestors? When they walked for the first time on the Earth? What other hom├╕nidos coexisted with them? Why survived our ancestors whereas other hom├╕nidos were extinguished?
 Reconstructing the crucial moments of our evolution, 'APE MAN' our trip of 5 million years vividly answers these questions when recreating from the origins of our species to the appearance of the man. This extraordinary history has been reconstructed by the scientists from numerous findings of fossils, prehistoric paintings, stone tools and rest of old genetic material. Step by step, the surprising drama of our history is kept awake. We will be witnesses of the old pain and fear of the man before the brutality of the life, and its love and joy before its beauty.
