      Focussed on the essential modules of an analogue synthesizer
      Alpha 3 offers true hands on operation. Everything is where
      you would expect it, nothing is more complex as it needs to
      be. Nothing is less powerfull as it needs to be. Alpha 3 is
      the sum of all our experience in synthesizer manufacturing.
      
      - AU and VST plug-in instrument for Mac and PC
      - 2 Oscillators with numerous waveforms
      - PWM (symmetry of all waveforms modulatable)
      - Switchable freerun for both oscillators
      - Extended Ringmodulation (modulatable Off-AM-RM)
      - Noise Oscillator
      - Spread (5 detuned oscillators per voice, adjustable)
      - Rich sounding multimode filter with saturation
      - dedicated filter ADSFR envelope
      - Amplifier section with dedicated ADSFR envelope
      - 7 slot Modulation Matrix, 19 sources, 18 destinations
      
      Just when you get tired about the many over-complex
      synthesizers of today, when you want to return to the roots,
      the beginning of all synthetic sound, the times when a
      Synthesizer could be fully programmed, then the Alpha 3 is the
      right synthesizer for you. Get the synth that you can control.
      Completely.
      
      - 3 individual LFOs with tweakable attack time, speed
      - (syncable), multiple shapes, switchable freerun
      - Portamento / Glide with various modes
      - adjustable Chorus, no other effects (intentionally)
      - Adjustable analogness
      - Global tuning and Microtonal support
      - Powerfull ECS (MIDI learn for almost all Controllers)
      - sample accurate processing, total recall
      - all controls automatable
      - direct access to all banks and presets
      - 32 voice polyphonic (adjustable), true mono mode
      
      - Alpha 3 allows Frequency Modulation of the Filters Cutoff, a
      feature only found in very few Synthesizers. The source of the
      Filter FM can be any oscillator, even noise. Together with the
      Ringmodulator which can be gradually morphed from pure
      Oscillator 2 over Amplitude-Modulation to Ring-Modulation this
      is a guaratee for some of very finest and most excotic sounds
      a classic subtractive synth can produce.
      
      - Alpha 3 has two oscillators with each producing a
      continuously adjustable mix of 2 from 30 waveforms. Taking
      into account that both basic waveform can have a different
      pitch already allows for thousands of resulting waveforms. But
      dont worry, our concept of handling is dead easy, pick the
      waveforms and adjust the mix. Done.
      
      - Requirements
      
      AU or VST2.0 capable host software. Alpha itself requires
      about 8 Mb memory only (first instance, 2 Mb for all
      additional instances).
      Screen resolution of 1024 x 768
      PC: 400 MHz, 256 Mb, Windows 98 or newer
