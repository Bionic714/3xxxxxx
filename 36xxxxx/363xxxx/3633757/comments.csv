,mcogan10,2007-03-06T21:54Z,"i have a question about this: dont you need to buy a copy of vista to activate, or can you just download vista from a torrent here? if you can download vista, please let me know."
,Drake Lu,2007-03-06T22:03Z,"I got my Vista Ultimate from Microsoft for free. Just registered a meeting & show up, then they gave me Vista as a gift. 

But I also use the copies that I downloaded from here to test my program in VMware, everything works perfectly. 

Since Vista DVD includes all versions, you just download anyone you can find. don't worry about their cracks, just use mine. 

remember, install Vista without a product key. "
,somestuff,2007-03-07T03:09Z,"Can I use this in a ""dual boot"" setup where Vista is on C (with timerstop crack) and XP on D.  I am currently dual booting with no problems, but am worried that this activator will screw that up."
,Drake Lu,2007-03-07T05:27Z,"yes, program will first install a .inf driver to your Vista and copy some files to your C drive

after reboot, program will run a batch file to activate your Vista by using those files copied to your C drive.

everything is done under Vista, and does not change anything of your system, especially the boot files. so it works with your ""dual boot"""
,xaneth,2007-03-14T06:14Z,"This crack definitely works.  After cracking, I ran ""slmgr.vbs -dli"" at a command prompt, and it shows successful registration.  So why not use a product key?  I used the one I downloaded with Vista Bill Gates Edition RTM 6000 I downloaded, and cracked with the Activator just fine."
