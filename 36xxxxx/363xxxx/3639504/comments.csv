In fact so new that it hasn't even been made yet since Family Guy is in its FIFTH season. So LOL must have travelled into the future and ripped this episode! Again, fantastic - what an accomplishment!"
,The Speed Freak,2007-03-14T23:24Z,isn't there 2 ways to count the episodes/seasons?
,creedfighterabe,2007-03-16T16:56Z,"And what excactly are you basing that statement on, Gregersamsa?"
,nikodhemus,2007-03-20T19:43Z,"Funny, Im quite certain that I do indeed have 6 seasons on my computer. Wonder how that can be gregersamsa, as it is, according to you, only 5 seasons."
,creedfighterabe,2007-03-20T22:17Z,"It's quite hard to keep track of the seasons, or so it would appear since they can't keep track on their own episodes. If that isn't the case, then they're just having a hard time keeping their web site up-to-date."
,Bora-02,2008-05-13T17:46Z,"The other way to count seasons, is by counting DVDs. There are less dvds than complete seasons, but i'll find out if it's really season 6 and not 5."
,Bora-02,2008-05-13T17:48Z,"...And yes, it's season FIVE, not 6."
