Downloading this is hence a waste of time, energy and bandwidth!"
,frankie79,2007-03-10T09:10Z,"@avseq ...if you use the options in the menu of the updater ""Remove red expired bar"" and ""Remove all nags"" it will convert to retail. It works perfect for me, puts the spyware and other shit in quarantine."
,bigoof,2007-05-12T00:36Z,"Yes, just utilize the updater and it works like a champ.  Previous versions I had always expired.  This one may be a keeper.  Much thanks frankie79."

Avast found a horsey!"
,richoward,2007-05-19T13:11Z,"I can't find the -- use the options in the menu of the updater ""Remove red expired bar"" and ""Remove all nags"" -- at all.  I could have gotten this same thing from WebRoot's site."
,frankie79,2007-05-21T10:46Z,"@richoward ...press button ""Kill SpySweeper"" in the Spy Sweeper Updater 2.0.0 Alpha 5000 and then chose options ""Remove Red Expired Bar"" and ""Remove All Nags"". If you can't find it you're not looking enough."
