Poison DUst tells the story of young soldiers who thought they came home safely from the war,
but didn't. Of a veteran's young daughter whose birth defect is strikingly similar to birth
defects suffered by many Iraqi children. Of thousands of young vets who are suffering from the
symptoms of uranium poisoning, and the thousands more who are likely to find themselves with
these ailments in the years to come. Of a government unwilling to admit there might be a
problem here. Filmmaker Sue Harris skillfully weaves the stories of these young veterans with
scientific explanations of the nature of "DU" and its dangers, including interviews with
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, New York Daily News reporter Juan Gonzalez, noted
physicist Michio Kaku, Dr. Rosalie Bertell, Dr. Helen Caldicott and Major Doug Rokke- the
former U.S. Army DU Project head.

Every American who cares about our troops should watch this film. Everyone who cares about the
innocent civilians who live in the countries where these weapons are used should watch this
film. And everyone who cares about the hatred of Americans that may result from the effects of
our government's actions in using these weapons, should watch this film. Is there a cover-up?
