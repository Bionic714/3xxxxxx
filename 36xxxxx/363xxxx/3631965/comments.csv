Hello?"
,emil2012,2008-02-05T05:24Z,I think everyone keeps re-seeding the same 65% or so. I found this listed with 1 seeder on my first Fools search and have not seen the original seeder since. I have about 1/2 myself and many people were leeching from me when I kept it open hoping the original seeder would return.. one day.. come backkk!!!
,emil2012,2008-02-05T05:26Z,"PS Alot of the olde Boston rock is hard to find on cd even if you want to buy it. So if you got any digital stuff from the day.. Rip and seed plz. Otherwise, I'll have to fly to Boston and dig around Nuggets or something hoping for a disc of the stuff."
