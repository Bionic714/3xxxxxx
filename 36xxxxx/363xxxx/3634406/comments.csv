,Owlz,2010-10-31T11:26Z,"The DVD contains a few extras (Making of, Interview with Jeremy Irons, some info on the actors), but no deleted scenes etc. The Making of is narrated in Spanish with scenes from the film dubbed in Spanish; interview bits are English with Spanish subs. The Interview with Irons is in English with Spanish subs. Otherwise the quality is excellent, the film in English or Spanish, whatever you prefer."
