,ripleyscot,2007-03-08T12:19Z,If possible please seed someone i really need this one
,101001,2007-03-08T18:01Z,I was wondering if anyone is connected to a seed?  I'm noticing that all the peers I'm connected to are stuck at 40%...  I was basically wondering if there is light at the end of the tunnel? Maybe one of my peers is connected to a seed
,downcastrelic,2007-03-09T04:44Z,hey i dont have the best connection nor all the time in the day or night

,yanqui9,2007-08-17T04:21Z,"VIRUS ALERT?

I detect a virus (obfustat.bhq) in TextAloudmp3.exe and a generic trojan in the loquendo files.

This could be a false positive, anyone else scan this and find anything?  "
,thetwig,2007-08-24T08:28Z,"yeah, i have found the same thing using AVG.  What have you done to resolve yanqui9?"
,downcastrelic,2007-08-31T05:37Z,their's no virus there. you are the only two that complained about this
,cybjer,2007-10-17T21:02Z,One of the antivirus i use has detected the same file (obfustat.bhq) though Kaspersky didn't detect anything ... weird isn't it ?
,Gnorxy,2007-12-15T02:22Z,"most keygens are recognized as malware, trojans and viruses. if you have it from a real (trusted) source you can be sure, there's no bad code inside! obfuscation and exe/runtime compression - might be used for viruses, but most of the time a common way of decompile protection, positive virus matches due to heuristic.

,sillisilli,2008-07-17T08:15Z,"I would appreciate if some one out there could give the working registeration code for text aloud.
Every time I expand the rar the antivirus deletes the crack"
