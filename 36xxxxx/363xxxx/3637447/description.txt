This is a follow-up to my previous torrent:
  
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3635174/Modded_Halo_2

This is just a NTSC Multiplayer Map Pack that is not stealth patched yet as I'm unable to rip the security sector as of the moment. So this file is currently unusable for the next day or so...at least til I upload the ss file for you to patch it. This will be needed to apply new map mods as you will simply need to use a program included with the ss file to inject modded maps into it and using the disc, overwrite your current new maps with modded ones. You will also need to make another unmodded copy of this disc to restore your unmodded maps.

This torrent was uploaded in advance because it will take several hours to dl, even though I am super-seeding, but you will only be able to use it in a few days with the security patch I release.

Enjoy!

The security patch will be up in a few days along with a tutorial!
