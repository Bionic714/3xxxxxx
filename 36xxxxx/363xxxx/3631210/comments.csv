,gwaz,2007-03-04T01:08Z,"Had vista RTM installed, NOT from pantheons but som older release and it seems to work with this crack thats actually paradoxÂ´s, very easy steps and its says its genuine now. Any way to confirm its working for real? If windows says its genuine now, then thats it or any else way to verify? "

,maxxy1234,2007-03-13T09:29Z,"When trying to do step 4, ""Intall the OEM certificate""
I keep getting a network path not found error message.
Any1 know how to overcome this?"
,zxzero,2007-04-02T03:14Z,"@ maxxy1234

Extract the certificate to the root of your hard drive, for example: if you chose the default emulation (ASUS) then go to where the crack folder is and open the CERTS folder and get the ASUS Digital License and place it in your C: or whatever local disk you have vista installed in and run the command line in the read me."
,ManUnited4Ever,2007-06-15T18:09Z,Does this work with the x64 version? Is there so big difference between x32 and x64?
,inque,2007-09-07T23:55Z,"The title says x86, so i guess 64bit Vista is not supported.

Does anybody know if there's an x64 version out yet, or when one will be available?"
,uberman84,2007-09-25T05:53Z,You guys fucking rock.  Works perfectly.  You must be a bunch of goddamn geniuses!

,deathnutz,2008-03-03T19:20Z,I need this for x64... can anybody tell me if this works on it or not?
,deathnutz,2008-03-03T19:23Z,Does it work with sp1?
,deathnutz,2008-03-03T23:39Z,"Damn! I don't know if it's because of sp1 or because of x64, but after the driver install and reboot, I keep getting failed to boot errors, telling me to repair windows.  Doh!  Hopefully I can just remove that driver somehow."
,Eacos,2008-05-11T05:28Z,"This works great with a clean install of Vista. But can anyone confirm if this works with SP1?

I'm not going to instal SP1 till I know!"
,Eacos,2008-05-14T09:43Z,"Ok now I know, this doesn't work for Vista SP1, look for Vista Loader v2.1.2"
,bmouritz,2010-06-09T04:48Z,"Installed this on Vista Ultimate 64bit.
Now pc won't boot at all, i need to make it boot from grub command line...help?"
