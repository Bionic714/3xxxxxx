,Drejo,2007-03-12T08:27Z,Must be a typo. Episode 15 aired just yesterday in the US. 
,Jaymz007,2007-03-12T08:29Z,isn't this s18e15? s18e14 was aired 4/3 and it airs every sunday...
,val,2007-03-12T09:53Z,"Yeah just use the upload dates as references to what it is.
It's as much 18x16 as Family Guy is in the 6th season. Filenames doean't matter much imo."
,canadiannnn,2007-03-12T11:48Z,this is Episode 15 not 16 this is the one directly after episode 14 here http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/show/146/episode_guide.html?season=18&tag=season_dropdown;dropdown;17
