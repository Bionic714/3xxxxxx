,Acerbus,2007-03-26T01:25Z,I usually don't beg people to seed but my D/U Ratio is 3.0... I would really appreciate if someone could seed this.. a lot of people are stuck on 27.9%
,Acerbus,2007-03-26T19:13Z,Thank you for seeding! :D
,Dangairon,2007-04-02T14:06Z,Does anybody get it all?
,Dangairon,2007-04-02T16:36Z,"I've just uploaded ""SACRIFICE RPG Game"" + Empire Earth + Desperados + more cool DEMOS"
,Acerbus,2007-04-05T00:51Z,I think you need to seed more since no one has gotten it yet.. A bunch of people stuck on 71.8%.. my download/upload ratio is 12.6! I would really appreciate it if you could seed some more! At least until someone else have it so they can seed too... :)
,Acerbus,2007-04-11T00:03Z,SEED!! No one has managed to get a copy yet! Im at 13.4 in dowload/upload ratio!!!!
,Dangairon,2007-04-12T15:27Z,"A big sorry uys but I had to make a format to the hard disk...and actually miss the game...
