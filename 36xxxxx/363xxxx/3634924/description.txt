                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ItÆs a sympathetic and affectionate portrayal of Cuba and of Castro, which in 
the rabid anti-Castro atmosphere of American media makes it a rare and 
fascinating document ù an inverse portrait of US disinformation and censorship. 
ItÆs a conventional biopic of CastroÆs life ù starting with the usual old 
photographs and an account of his schooling, continuing with his involvement 
in student politics at the University of Havana (during a period of intense 
repression by the Batista government), and finally following his career as 
armed insurgent, successful revolutionary, and popular leader. What makes it 
highly unconventional ù almost breath-taking at times ù is that it covers the 
life of a socialist revolution as well as of a famous man, and that it treats 
a much-maligned and demonised country and character with respect and affection. 
This in turn illuminates for the American viewer how pervasive and complete is 
the anti-Cuba propaganda campaign in the US.
