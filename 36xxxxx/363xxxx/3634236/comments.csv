,Hawkdeer,2007-07-07T13:45Z,"Greatly informative, and covers a lot of info.
The video has very annoying audio though. The volume levels fluctuate greatly from interview to interview, and even in different parts of the same interview. Sometimes the narrator's voice is lost in background voices. I had to watch it with my hand on the volume dial the entire time."

,badluck13_7,2008-12-25T19:51Z,If I didn't pirate here i'd be shoplifting at Wal-Mart. Don't know which one i'd rather do really....
,badluck13_7,2008-12-25T19:51Z,"I wonder if you can buy this movie at wal-mart...?

lmao"
,Organjic,2009-05-11T08:24Z,"Anti Free-Capitalist movie.  Don't shop at Walmart because they reap profits, boycott them for selling out to China and their lobbying actions in Congress if you want."
,sunflower12,2009-11-17T03:57Z,"Walmart is amazing, who cares about anyone else, I save money makes me happy. LONG LIVE WALMART!!!! 

For example I bought a auto fish feeder at wal mart for 20$ i went to a pet store and saw the EXACT same model for 60$, yea right, u can screw off. If i cant get it at walmart there is all always dealextreme which is where i also shop often, free shipping! even if item costs 75cents.

I bought things at small stores before when i have a problem, UH no Returns no exchanges or store credit. Ya right, I like to buy knowing if i have a problem or find a better deal else where i can return it with no questions asked. And did u tards not think that walmart started as a ma an pop store too ? 

ya they werent magicaly a chain, so we are supporting a ma and pa store that does a little better than most. LOL

Wal Mart haters, get a life. Walmart Lovers, See ya there in a bit."

,TaiTheGuy,2010-02-24T05:58Z,"sunflower12

obviously didn't watch the film or notice Wal-Mart obliterate his families businesses. Probably because they don't own any... And in a 20 mile radius of a Wal-Mart surrounded by people with views like his; probably never will."
,andrewrox424,2010-02-25T10:24Z,"Just a warning, the video is in 29fps (NTSC?) and thus won't work on most PAL streaming devices like my xbox.
Works on your pc though. :)"
,LifeSux,2010-04-13T21:46Z,Thanks!
,samoframbow,2010-05-03T01:06Z,"In response to sunflower 12...

I understand your confusion about Wal-Mart and how you think they're great because they offer low prices. It's obvious that you haven't watched this film because you would have known how corrupt the Wal-Mart corporation is. 

You haven't thought about how they're able to offer such low prices and stay in business. They rip off their employees by paying them low wages--low enough that these people need government assistance. This enables Wal-Mart to avoid having to offer good health benefits. You should stop supporting a company that has driven out small businesses owned by and employing people who need to make livings. The list goes on.

In other words, you are an idiot."
,samoframbow,2010-05-03T01:08Z,"By the way, sunflower12, your taxes go to Wal-Mart employees and their food stamps, looooooooooooooooooool!"
[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-05-03T02:08Z,"Sunflower, you are naive and don't understand economics and politics.

While Wal-Mart may save you a couple of bucks every week, it is parasitic in nature and is bleeding the country (and the world) dry, and will eventually affect you and yours."
[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-05-03T02:11Z,"Organjic, Wal-Mart is not a working model of capitalism. Wal-Mart is communist if anything. 
Learn some history. During the Sovietization of Russia, big conglomerates like Wal-Mart (mostly Jewish merchants) swooped in and put the Mama and Papa businesses out. Then they jacked the prices up and the Russians were starved into a revolution that eventually killed them.

Wal-Mart is not free anything. It is slavery and parasitic."
,possm88,2011-01-17T05:47Z,Wow talmudtimmy with a good comment! Hard to find around this place..... Thanks for the upload!
,bbb86,2011-02-02T10:22Z,Reminds me of one episode of South Park...
,whiteboyo,2011-10-06T11:15Z,Thanks for this movie lkobescak. Really appreciate your here! 
,JamJulLison,2012-06-05T01:25Z,Walmart is a great place to job. Horrible to compete against and even worse to work for.  I used to work at Walmart. The pay stinks. I was an ICS Associate. Which means my primary job was helping to unload the trucks. We only got paid a lousy 7.65 an hour for it. For those who don't know the minimum wage in Indiana. It is 7.25 an hour
,lattari,2012-08-15T16:41Z,It would be nice if amidst your heated discussion somebody would comment on the quality. It doesn't look promising nor does this conspiracy-nut usually pay attention to it. Are there hardcoded subs? Its a shame the full DVDR has run out of seeds. 
,lattari,2012-08-15T16:44Z,How is Wal-mart 'bleeding the world dry'? Why are you guys so paranoid about everything? Why do you americans abuse superlatives ie. the worst ever and so on?
