When the CEO of SinTek Industries begins injecting the
streets with a DNA-altering drug, it's time to reassess

plans to overtake the world with her unholy 
army of genetically-engineered mutants, it's time to
rewrite the golden rule.   
You are Colonel John R. Blade, head of the most prominent private 
protection agency in Freeport. Now Elexis Sinclaire is waging her
holy war against the security industry...and you along with it.
You've made a religion out of fighting crime. Now you're going to
