[V],Kuthumi,2007-03-07T17:44Z,It looks like this copy has erased the original English soundtrack. Please confirm that it's there.
,johnleo,2007-03-07T23:19Z,"wow
is there no english sound?
if there is I'll download this on the spot
it's a very very good movie."
,elmoncho,2007-03-08T06:04Z,No english audio? That's bizarre.
,johnleo,2007-03-08T13:46Z,"well I think it sounds so wierd that it cant be true.
I mean this is an american movie."
,bahmudales,2009-03-01T20:06Z,"If it's true there is no english audio, that means the one who ripped it's stupid!"
,bahmudales,2009-03-05T12:29Z,"Take it with trust, the dvd has english audio!"
