,Fringe4,2007-03-11T03:51Z,"I agree. Between my two torrents, I've got near 190 users splitting my poor 45k upload bandwidth between them...

I've actually set this torrent to get high priority on the bandwidth though."
,curtano,2007-03-11T07:38Z,how does this work!!! i cant figure this out it doesnt let me download anything on this site some1 please help me out idk anything about bittorrenttrackers and all that stuff
,curtano,2007-03-11T08:23Z,"wtf now i get bittorrent, and it downloads, but its like 1 kb/s-5kb/s all the time! my computer isnt that bad"
,Fringe4,2007-03-11T08:51Z,"A lot of times your firewall settings can be throttling Bittorrent. It may not be your firewall that's built into Windows, or a software one either. If you have a router, it may have a built in firewall. There are a lot of things that can throttle Bittorrent.

But, google ""firewall + bittorrent"", or look at the example on portforward.com"
