,Impostorzim,2008-09-21T19:08Z," Wow, this has got to be the first time I've ever honestly loved the soundtrack to a movie. Same goes for Batman Forever. One of Smashing Pumpkins' best songs is on this CD! I mean I actually forgave the crappy movie after listening to this.

 PS. I'll get mah super seed on, bitch."
