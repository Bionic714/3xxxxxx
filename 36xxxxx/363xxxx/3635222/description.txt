Programme Synopsis:
?The prevailing global-warming view is that man-made emissions of carbon dioxide are largely responsible. This film, featuring leading academics in fields such as climatology, oceanography, meteorology and biogeography, questions the science behind the accepted reasons for global warming and argues that other explanations ? including the effect of the sun?s radiation on the atmosphere ? are not being properly aired. It also asserts that the single-minded focus on reducing carbon emissions might have the unintended consequence of stifling development in the Third World, prolonging endemic poverty and disease.?
