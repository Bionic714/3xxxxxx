It is interesting to notice that, when confronted with solid reasons, they tend to ignore them - witness Greenpeace's reaction to Lomborg's ""The Skeptical Environmentalist"", about which the only thing they have to say that they will not dignify the book with any comments of any sort."

From 1940 it was WWII so there wasn't much industrial activity at that moment (execpt for making bombs) CO2 started to raise in the 1960's and the results of that where seen in the 1970's.

But it doens't mather anyway, we are discussing if our consumption has to do anything with global warming, even if CO2 has no effect on global warming we still have to be more carrefull with nature, it isn't realistic to think we can live like this for 100 years, certainly not with China and India as to huge upcomming industrial country's.

Believe it or not, I actually care about the environment, but man-made global warming is just ridiculous.  It's just another scare tactic the government invented to justify its own existence, like the ice age in the 70s that never happened, the whole in the ozone, deforestation, acid rain, overpopulation, AIDS, the bird flu etc. etc.  All of these things were supposed to be our end, but look around, we're still here, and the only people who benefited the governments and their friends."

,Kemisten,2007-03-11T01:48Z,"Political and economical interests, yes that´s right but how much money is the oil industry putting into politics by lobbyists? Our hole economy is based upon oil and other nonrenewable energy resources. 
800 years delay between CO2 and temperature can be explained by: the sun is heating the earth and more water is evaporation as they say and forms more clouds. The earth becomes cooler and more ice is formed at the poles. And so on. They also mention that water is a greenhouse gas. Yes, thats is right but the water on the earth is cycling around. It is the same water today aswell as one million years ago. When we are burning fossil fuels the concentration of carbondioxide will INCREASE in the atmosphere and the equilibrium will be changed. In the future lead to hotter earth becouse carbondioxide is a stronger greenhouse gas than water. Burning of wood NO NOT contribute to the global warming becouse it is the same thing as if the tree has fallen to the ground after it´s lifetime. 
People in the undeveloped countries can use their fossilenergy but why not go beyond those resources that will end some day anyway. And if they are using more of fossilfuels like Kina who is building one new cole plant every week then we here in the west must use less becouse the concentration will otherwise increase. We must develop cheaper renewable energy before the oil is becoming expensive!! It´s better to do the right thing from the beginning. 
The thing is that even if the human population is effecting the total concentration if greenhouse gases only a little that is the only thing we can do anything about, can´t we?"
,spyke,2007-03-12T10:57Z,"@Kemisten:
Whatever differences we make are utterly insignificant compared to nature. Think about the next volcanic eruption - how much CO2 do you think that creates? The FACTS remain that NASA has discovered that Mars is warming up just as much as the Earth. Now I challenge ANY politician, scientist or member of the public to prove we're responsible for that!!

What we SHOULD be concentrating on are the things where we can make a difference - i.e. stop using up the Earth's natural resources. This means slamming large corporates with big taxes based on their raw material use. Think about how much unnecessary packaging you throw away EACH DAY."

,CoMMaNcHe,2007-03-31T06:25Z,"The only reason anyone would ""defend"" the idea that global warming is man-made, and/or defend the idea that a Global Tax would solve the problem, is simply doing so because believing in man-made Global Warming has become like a religion for a lot of people.

And if something threatens their ""faith"" in that religion, they will get very angry and become very desperate to defend it in any way possible.

It's the same with the people who still desperately cling to the ""offical story"" of 9/11, and refuses to acknowledge that the Dollar has been devalued, denies the existance of the North American Union, denies that there is an Elite, denies that both political parties are controlled, and refuses to admit that the country is in a Very bad shape, that their rights are rapidly being taken away and that the Constitution is being ignored.

They just want to feel good and have no responsibility whatsoever.

They enjoy sitting there with their plastic flags (made by Chinese slaves) and being fed propaganda and bullshit on Fox News and believe everything that they're told.

And they're so deep in, that even if you give them hardcore evidence of the state of things, and hit them on the head and scream ""TIME TO WAKE UP!!"", they'll do everything in their power to NOT wake up and instead continue on in their little fantasy world that consists of man-made global warming and evil islamic terrorists.

Because that's all they have. And it would be too painful for them to realize the truth, to give up their fake comfortable reality.

""Moreover, while the programme-makers labelled the source of their world temperature data as 'NASA', the Independent found no such graph existed.""

(We feel swindled. Indeed we are not the only ones: Carl Wunsch (who was a surprise addition to the cast) was apparently misled into thinking this was going to be a balanced look at the issues (the producers have a history of doing this), but who found himself put into a very different context indeed.)

Prof Wunsch's complaint is that the documentary is no more than propaganda. ""I was misled as to what it was going to be about,"" he now says.

""In October 1998 a television producer named Martin Durkin took a proposal to the BBC?s science series, Horizon. Silicone breast implants, he claimed, far from harming women, were in fact beneficial, reducing the risk of breast cancer. Horizon commissioned a researcher to find out whether or not his assertion was true. After a thorough review, the researcher reported that Mr Durkin had ignored a powerful body of evidence contradicting his claims. Martin Durkin withdrew his proposal. Instead of dropping it, however, he took it to Channel 4 and, astonishingly, sold it to their science series, Equinox.""

""Mr Durkin has often been accused of taking liberties with the facts. In 1997 he made a series for Channel 4 called ?Against Nature?, which compared environmentalists with Nazis, conspiring against the world?s poor. No one would suggest that green claims should not be subjected to critical examination, but the people he interviewed were lied to about the contents of the programmes and given no chance to respond to the accusations the series made.""

The Big Myth! Global warming.
The film ""An Incovenient Truth"" would make a great presentation if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forbodding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depressed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temperature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobel prize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize has become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pac"

The way these people attack the very basis of freedom of expression and speech is typical of dictatorship eras of the last centary. 

30 years ago these people were freaking the world about an impeeding ice age, they were wrong then, they are most likely wrong now."
,ND3G,2008-01-27T03:27Z,"As an environmental engineer I find the current argument over global warming simply appalling.  Do human activities cause global warming?  Of course they do!  Any release of energy (aka burning fuel) produces heat as a by-product.  The question is, are human activates capable of causing (directly or indirectly) enough global warming to have a noticeable effect?  

The earth?s atmosphere requires a certain amount of green house gases in order to regulate temperature.  Without them you would freeze to death as soon as the sun went down.  If you add more green house gases to the atmosphere those gases will trap more heat causing the earth?s temperature to rise.  The problem is that we have reached a point where we have pumped so much green house gas into the atmosphere that it is having a very real effect on our climate.

A few posts up (and a couple of months ago) CoMMaNcHe posted an almost schizophrenic attack against the idea of man-man global warming (along with global taxes, slave labour, 9/11, currency, and basically politics in general).  What interests me though is his mention of faith.  Faith is belief that is not based on proof and on both sides of the argument there are those who have very strong beliefs one way or the other but do not possess the knowledge necessary to make a really informed decision.

Fortunately, that is where science comes in.  Science is a systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.  In other words it is the exact opposite of faith.  Scientists do not believe in global warming (or any other theory for that matter), they conclude whether or not the earth is warming based on years of impartial study.  Unlike politics or religion science has no agenda or vested interest in the outcome.  If humans were not causing global warming studies would conclude that fact.  

The vast majority of environmental scientists (and by that I mean virtually everyone in the field) agrees that humans are causing global warming.  If you disagree than by all means submit your findings to a scientific journal for peer review.  Otherwise, kindly step aside so we can get on with the process of developing solutions to this problem."

,board_lord12,2008-04-10T05:57Z,"ND3G?  How can you say that science has no agenda?  Who is funding all this research for global warming.  The government? NOOO!!!  This movie clearly says it: the funding for global warming research has gone up INSANELY in the last 10 years.  Scientists are setting out with a hypothesis and fucking doing whatever experimentation they can to support it.  I completely agree that we as a race are slowly screwing over our planet, but I don't think the issue deserves as much political attention as it gets.  Every fucking politician is just jumping on the bandwagon and using ""Climate Change"" as a way to gain support because that's all people can fucking think about these days.  Everything is ""green this"" and ""reduce emissions"" that.  TV, magazines, you name it boyboy.

The thing that really pisses me off is that people think they are being responsible by being so obsessed with global warming but it's just another way for the government to distract you from the issues that actually ARE important like MOTHER FUCKING WARS WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIE.  It's pure hypocrisy like holy shit.  ""Let's spend all our fucking money on reducing emissions and screw the average joes over by taxing gasoline because the earth's climate is changing and emissions could affect ecosystems!""  All the while, we plow the tropical rainforests like there is no fucking tomorrow and expand into the natural habitat of more species.  Biodiversity changes over time and that's a fact.  Speciation occurs but so does extinction and clearly there should be some sort of balance.  The rate of extinctions HAS increased since we homo sapiens started fuckin' around, but how much of that do you think is due to global climate change compared to HABITAT LOSS?

Global warming IS and issue, and it IS important.  I agree that it is bad to leave a footprint on the earth and we should try to preserve its natural beauty, but we're not facing a goddamn manmade extinction of all organisms. The fact is that Earth changes whether we inhabit it or not.  ""Oh the composition of the Earth's atmosphere is rapidly changing"" and ""Holy shit there's so much carbon dioxide we're all gonna die"".  Well suck my balls because carbon dioxide makes up 0.03811% of the atmosphere, the most abundant gas in it is NITROGEN at almost 80% and every other major element pales in comparison to this, so seriously just chill the fuck out.  And whoever the fuck said that the earth is only 6000 years old should PROBABLY pass grade 7 and come back to this page.  I'm pretty sure i could find a piece of shit in ur backyard and use carbon-14 to prove you wrong.  Or you could just READ A BOOK!

Bottom line: this movie is dope. Everyone who sees Al Gore's ""an inconvenient truth"" and is swayed can barf on themselves.  Study psychology and then watch that movie.  He tries to appeal to you on every single possible level to persuade you that global warming will kill us all within 50 years.  WHy you ask is his injured son in the video?  I honestly do not know. He skims over the most irrelevant topics and somehow draws an analogy between them and global warming.  His tobacco farm?  His sister or some random dude?  WHY THE FUCK DID THAT MOVIE GET PRODUCED???  The only think he doesn't try, is using cold hard facts like ""The Great Global Warming Swindle""  does.  Al Gore's movie met such success because his target audience was people with an intellectual level of about grade 11 comletion........the majority of the North American population????  (I'm North American too, so don't hate me).  The fact is, that is the majority of the world though, and that's why people like George Bush get elected.  If everyone in the united states had a university education, well I don't think the political system would even be CLOSE to what it is today, because the system of getting involved in politics is just a filter.  What comes out? People who are INTERESTED in politics.  And these people share a lot of characteristics with one another....power hungry much?

Plus all the scientists who bailed out on the IPCC report to avoid being associated with it. To the point of threatening to sue.

For in depth information on the IPCC and the real global warming phenomena, take a biology 101 course.

CO2 doesn't make the planet warmer, the sun does. Civilisation isn't a major producer of CO2, the ocean is. CO2 is necessary for plantlife to grow, just as water and sunlight.

There are only two inconvenient truths on this planet. We all pay taxes to the world's bankers and eventually, we all die."
,jzenman,2008-08-10T19:27Z,If global warming is ever proved true beyond a doubt the rich and powerful will be squirming in their seat. They have way more to gain if it's proved not true. The people who promote global warming are making just a fraction of a percent of what the real players in the world market are making off of discrediting global warming. Think about it. Who do you think has the real power to produce documentaries like this and to get the dupes to sing along?

I think you're mostly wrong. The richest and most powerful stand behind UN, even helped create it. Their goal is more power, and population control, not just money. The richest are setting up a Sovjet (council) style, green, rule. Rockefeller has gotten Exxon to take GW ""seriously"" btw. There's going to be much money to make/loot too, in the form of taxes, and there's much oppression to be done. They prefer the plebs be poor obedient, disposable, slaves. Policies that could ruin billions of lives, etc. I'm afraid they'll introduce eugenics again too, since that's what population control is really about, and they've almost sterilized the male (not just humans) too, because they want control over the fertilization process. That was the agenda. Otherwise it would have been stopped fifty years ago. (see ""the disappearing male""). They knew Bisphenol was a synthetic estrogen, now it's everywere, and prominent eugenicists talked about doing it long ago (ie. Charles Galton Darwin in ""the Next Million Years"").

Global warming may be true, but CO2 may very well have nothing to do with it, but the sun has heated mars too? Pure CO2 reaches 5°C above air at room temp. We're talking less than one part per thousand here, and plants grows faster with more CO2. They, the rich and powerful, said this in 1991:
?The common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up 
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""

,esel7,2008-11-24T05:14Z,"I believe starfish294 is right though, but climate change, which is replacing warming, is just weather, and we've always had it. Proving their theory that it's man made could prove to be impossible, and if they say they have proven it, take it with a grain of salt. You can't just trust those computer models. They have an agenda."

Yes the rich and the politically powerful do have a hold on the UN, and yes the elite do pull the strings. But I for one don't think they are the ones who came up with global warming. What does ""green rule"" mean? If it means losing individualist freedom then I'm against it. But if it means a certain level of regulation in market products to help save the ecology and make our environment clean, then I'd totally support such a ""rule"".

1. If GW is indeed a conspiracy, what will the rich and powerful ultimately gain? They cannot tax us directly. The government can tax the CO2 emitting companies, so they'll increase their prices to maintain profit. But there is no overall gain for them. In fact they'll suffer losses when people will switch to cleaner technologies.

2. ""The real enemy then, is humanity itself."" - I agree with this 100%. I can prove it to you that all the major problems of the world are a result of overpopulation - poverty, economic imbalance, pollution, mismanagement. Global warming might be made up, but pollution and damage to ecology is overly apparent. Of course I'm not saying they should control birth rates nefariously and secretly. But I'd again support a transparent, democratic method to reduce population.

3. If anyone makes a profit on this global warming hype, there's nothing wrong about it. For example if Al Gore invests in energy efficient companies, what's wrong in that? He has the right to make money too. Such technology is the next big thing and people know that they're gonna sell so I'd invest in them too. That's how the stock market works. If I'm making money on something, does that mean whatever I'm saying about it is propaganda?

4. I think this documentary (The GW Swindle) itself might be propaganda. The industrialists are worried about GW. If you want to know more about how a certain strata of powerful individuals make all the decisions, do some research. We think we're free, but democracy itself is constraining.

An Inconvenient Truth is exaggerated.
Watch this instead for some straight cut facts:

For example he claimed that vulcanos emit multiple times more co2 than humans when it in fact seems that the ratio is about 100:1 the other way around. Then again who knows any more with this bombardment of contradicting information. You would think grown up professionals get their facts straight before they start this climate hysteria and use billions of euros of tax payer funds."

,skyvillage,2012-08-26T16:05Z,"Scientists predicted global warming long ago, due to human carbon emmisions.  These predictions are now coming true.  Deniers first said ""there's no global warming.""  Now they say ""it's not due to man.""  Next they'll say ""it's due to man, but it's a good thing.""  Then they'll say ""it's terrible, but it's too late to do anything about it.""

To say that the legions of scientists who predicted global warming were correct about the climate but simply got lucky due to a coincidental natural cause is total and complete insanity.

Deniers, like the rest of us, are complicit.  They don't want to face that fact or deal with any shared sacrifices.  They may be adults in terms of age, but they are infants in terms of maturity."
