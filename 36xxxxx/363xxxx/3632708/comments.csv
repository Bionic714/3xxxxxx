...matchmaking.dll was not found...
Vad ska man göra?"
,ColdSToneNL,2007-03-11T19:10Z,"Please explain in English, maybe I can help."
,Slasen83,2007-03-11T23:36Z,"The game is installed, but when starting the application this comes:
matchmaking.dll was not found... 

What should i do?"
,ColdSToneNL,2007-03-20T16:24Z,Did you run the crack included on the iso?
,Black7000,2007-03-28T22:09Z,"The install goes fine. But after following the instructions fromt he file (copying the crack files into the game dir) it still does not 'recognize the CD' (if you attempt to use the crack file you will get a dll error).
If you instead put the crack file into your game directory/bin folder, you will replace the previous file with the cracked one, but upon clicking this file, a windows application briefly flickers on the screen then vanishes, nothing being loaded."
,Black7000,2007-03-28T22:19Z,nevermind my previous comment. it must be something funky with this laptop.it loads fine on my stationary.  you just have to put the crack files into the game dir/bin folder and execute from there.   (i.e c:/games/settlers/bin/)
,Solidis,2007-04-16T18:49Z,"Well... The game doesnt work fine on me anyways.. The demos lag like hell and in the game all description windows, buttons etc. are blank, no text whatsoever, not even unit names. Any1 know what may be causing this?"

,Microchaton,2008-06-14T12:29Z,"I'm certainly retarded but, how do I get the crack who's supposed to be in ?  I'm not very skilled with these tools, I just ""Mounted"" small file, it installed correctly, and when I run the game it asks for CD, and I don't know how to get the ""cracked"" files :S"
,Marley1981,2008-10-10T12:37Z,"Hi. I have a small problem with this game. The installation works fine and the crack to. But when im about to play the game it starts and i can see the small window mentioned earlier. After it opens fullscreen and a voice starts talking. The screen blinks and the game does not load fully.
Whats the problem?"
