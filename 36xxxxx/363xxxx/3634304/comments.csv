,NELRUH,2007-03-11T17:54Z,"I have more Barbie-movies if anyone is interested: 

Swanlake/Svanesjøen, Magic Of Pegasus/Pegasus' Trolldom, Rapunzel, Nutcracker/Nøtteknekkeren.

Except from Magic of Pegasus (English, Danish and Norwegian), they all have English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish audio.

All I want in return, is that you seed the torrent for a while after downloading:-)"

,ex_pat,2007-04-02T07:33Z,Nero recode worked for me. Chose the folder with the download as source and the DVD burner as backup location.
