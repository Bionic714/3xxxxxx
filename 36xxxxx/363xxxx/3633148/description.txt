The film started life as a 10-minute short called "Roast of the Day", which started shooting in 1981. 
The story concerned Giles (Craig Smith) an aid worker who comes to the small coastal town of Kaihoro 
on collection day. The young man encounters a psychopath named Robert who then pursues him. Giles 
escapes the madman and reaches an old heritage estate where he tries to contact the authorities. 
However the same clan of cannibalistic psychos that Robert is from occupies the house and captures Giles. 
In a twist of irony the aid worker is later cooked up to relieve the famine of the cannibals. 
Along the way Jackson added the "special forces" team that would be sent to rescue Giles, 
but in this early version, the "boys" would turn out to be cannibals as well (they staged the 
whole thing because they like to play with their food). When it came time for Jackson to finally 
edit the film together he found that he had nearly fifty minutes' worth of useable footage. So with 
it's current length and being inspired by the 16mm efforts of Sam Raimi's _Evil Dead, The (1984)_ , 
Jackson continued shooting to make the movie a full-length feature.
