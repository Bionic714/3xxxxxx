Blacktop Badge\\\'s self-titled debut!

from Pulse magazine:

\\\"This five-piece blues-rock outfit hails from the Twin Towns and punches out a sound that\\\'s half Black Crowes-styled bar-room boogie and half rural outlaw thump. Such a combination could be dangerous (aurally-speaking) in the hands of stardom-seeking, guru-led young bucks who can play a guitar like ringin\\\' a bell but couldn\\\'t write a decent song to save their lives.

Thankfully, BTB maintain a steadfast, original vibe in their music, and it\\\'s obvious from the moaning slide-intro on album opener/working man\\\'s booze/blues shuffle \\\"The Grind\\\" that these cats aren\\\'t here to end once and for all the Hendrix vs. Stevie Ray Vaughn debate (not that either would care, being long buried at this point and probably sittin\\\' around a game of poker plotting Clapton\\\'s downfall), but to bury you alive in the driving, spit-n-fire style they\\\'ve forged all on their own.\\\"
