3 bootleg Misfits CD\'s.  Ripped to MP3 @ 128kbps.  Some demos, mostly live.  Standard Misfits performances: raw, fast, loud....instruments cutting out, audience getting cussed out and songs barely being held together by the band.  Everything you love about the Misfits!  Must have, for Misfits fans.  Song names for the Psychomania CD are left as they appear on the CD...a.k.a. they are not all accurate.  Enjoy, and please seed!
