,sN1b,2007-03-15T20:41Z,Yea it is. There should be 2 SG-1 movies coming end 2007 though.
,brunnhilde,2007-06-03T20:30Z,"What about Supernatural? BTW, huge thanks to you for this!"
,death734,2008-01-27T06:55Z,"hi sN1b, i know its a slim chance you will see this but i have been looking into x264 encoding lately and was wondering if there is any chance you can post things for these encodes like profile and custom matrix used?"
,death734,2008-02-05T03:55Z,"never mind. HQ-Insane profile and Prestige CQM matrice (can be found on doom9.org forums) works very well. in fact when using that profile and matrice, and encoding at 500k (same bitrate as this) then mean while encoding at 640x352 rather then 960x544 from the same source file actually makes better looking encodes (somewhat sharper with less artifacts). with 128k audio (2.0 mp3 or 5.1 aac suggested) gives 200mb file size. and even would come out with a little better PQ if a DVD source is used. interesting..."
