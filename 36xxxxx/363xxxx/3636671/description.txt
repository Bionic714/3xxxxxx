A former L.A. drug dealer (Thomas Jane) has moved to Houston to make a new life for himself as a married architect. Everything falls apart when he is suddenly visited by one of his former cohorts (Aaron Eckhart) who comes carrying heroin. Discovering the dope, the architect flushes it down the drain. This sets up a series of tough customers seeking the dope including a rasta hitman (Glenn Plummer), an ex-lover (Paulina Porizkova) who ties up and rapes James, a criminal (James LeGros) with a penchant for torture, and a rogue cop (Mickey Rourke). Michael Jeter also appears as a psychologist from an adoption agency where the couple is seeking to adopt a child.  Written by John Sacksteder {jsackste@bellsouth.net}
