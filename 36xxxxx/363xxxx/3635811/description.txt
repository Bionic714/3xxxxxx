FrameForge 3D Studio takes the guesswork out of directing film, videos and commercials. You'll save time and money at every stage of production with optically correct storyboards that not only include the shot as seen through the camera, but also the overhead set layout with camera setups, and all relevant camera information.

FrameForge helps explore and sharpen visual narrative for directors, producers and investors. FrameForge creates an optically-accurate image presentation while capturing vital production data for cast and crew to insure your ideas come alive. 
Writers have had script processors for years and now directors, filmmakers, and commercial creatives have the first storyboard software tool that delivers real previsualization and MULTI-CAMERA exploration of shot coverage BEFORE you go on location.
