When members of the Utopiated InterWeb√ñ Collective were still drinking free school milk we were aware of some 'different' sort of news hitting the headlines.  This was the Operation Julie saga yet there's far more to the case than just a big LSD bust. 

From a few small properties in Wales, Richard Kemp and Elizabeth Bott had become the British node to the Tim Leary's Brotherhood of Eternal Love. They produced millions of hits of LSD and distributed it globally. Wales had certainly seen nothing like it before and probablysince. The video is more of a summary and concentrates more on the police side of things. For this reason we've added some background documentation. And of course what the video won't tell you is that the British Drugs Squad were so unprepared for the situation they at least once found themselves 'twatted' on Dr Kemp's high grade aciiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid ;)

The Welsh crew had links to the pioneer of DNA -  Francis Crick.
