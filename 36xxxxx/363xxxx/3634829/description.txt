Extracting Information:
 I used PVRExplorer Pro 2.03 to ripped the MPG2
 file directly from the PVR. I removed the
 commercial with VideoRedo. So, until a proper DVD
 with 5.1 is released, it's the best we can hope
 for.

Playability:
 I used DrDivx 2.0. It should play on a standalone
 DVD player

Info2MIS v2.0.0B10 is free. It's the app's that I 
used to create the .MIS. It can also extract
information from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, 
amazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a few seconds with an episode on tv.com(find page)
and only 2 clicks for a movie from imdb.com(with picture)

It's a front end/player. but If you don't like the 
internal player, you can configure your own player.
