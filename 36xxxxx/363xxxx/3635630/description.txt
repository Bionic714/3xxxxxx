Before Westlife broke all known records for consecutive UK singles No.1's, Take That had risen from being the laughing stock of a cynical 90's music industry, to landing 13 UK Top 10 singles, including a record breaking, eight instant No.1's and providing a launch pad for, arguably, the UK's most consistent pop/rock star of his generation, Robbie Williams. 

The band was built around main singer/song-writer Gary Barlow, with Robbie and Mark Owen supplying occasional lead vocals (and something "cute" for the teens and gay market) and two dancers (Jason and Howard), who added something a little more "physical" and less "innocent" for the older audience! The music itself was a fairly unique blend of up-tempo, high energy, pop/disco numbers, well-chosen covers and classy ballads, giving them a breadth of material never matched by the likes of Westlife and Boyzone. 

All sixteen of their UK singles, including 'Back For Good', 'Pray', 'Relight My Fire', 'A Million Love Songs', 'Never Forget', 'It Only Takes A Minute' and 'Could It Be Magic' are featured here, alongside a bonus live track, a 2005 remix of 'Relight My Fire' and a newly recorded track, 'Today I Lost You', which was written as the follow up to 'Back For Good' in 1995, but never recorded until this year.
