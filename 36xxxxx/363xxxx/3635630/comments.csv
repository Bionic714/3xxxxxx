This is my first attempt at uploading a torrent so if it does not seed correctly email me and I will rectify it"
,JANHUBERT,2007-03-10T21:30Z,What's the matter with this torrent?
,Pr0p3r,2007-03-13T18:39Z,"It stops at 99,8%... BUHU!! I'm no expert on this, but is the problem that no one seeds or is it something with the file? Page says that it schould be one seeder... Were are you!?"
,Pr0p3r,2007-03-14T16:54Z,"Hello-hello :) It's just me again. Haha.

Just wondering how long it usually takes if something goes SLOW like this one? Want it!!!"

Sorry about the problems with this torrent, I have been trying to fid out what the problem is, it looks like an extra file has been included in the torrent details that I am not uploading resulting in the torrent stopping at 99.8%, this probably happened when I created the torrent. Could anyone tell me whether the downloaded music files will play or not, if not then I will create another torrent.

,Pr0p3r,2007-03-15T16:08Z,"Aha. Diden't know I could try to listen too it before I got the whole 100%...

So now I tried, and IT WORKS ::D All 19 songs - and it sounds nice. Thank you. 

That way everything is all good, but wont it be a problem if you take this of your seeding list? No one ese can seed the whole thing, because we CAN'T get it all done. It will allways look like this has only one seeder, right? As long as you are here...

I THINK it will work, but it will LOOK wrong... So maybe it's better you make a new one (easyer to understand that way), but that's totally up to you ;) Looks like I got everything I wanted, so THANKS ;)"

I have downloaded an 99.8% copy from some of the peer's to see what is missing.  all 19 songs and the 3 video's seem fine but the 3 cover jpegs are missing, this adds up to about 0.5mb which is the missing 0.2%. I have re-added the missing files to my downloaded copy and will leave it on as a peer in the hope that someone may download the extra files and become a seed, but if this does not happen this file can be passed from peer to peer as is beeing done, the ony difference is when you get to 99.8% you have got all there is to get. you can burn the songs and the videos but leave the download active for a while to let others copy it.  If anyone particularly wants the cover jpegs then if you post me I will create a fresh torrent with just the covers.

            regards Alan"
