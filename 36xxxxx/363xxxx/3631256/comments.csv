You don't happen to have nforce4 system on your computer. I have it and the same thing happened to me when i installed the SMbus driver. Well, your computer works without it, if its not already installed during the install of vista(mine was) i dont know, but there are ways to get around it..search for ""orbit30""(a user) or something, his cracks and you'll see there how to do=)...another update to btw, that fucks up royal.sys, cant remeber it right know though..."

SOLUTION:

The BSOD error is caused by the Update from Microsoft named Nforce4 PCI-Express Root Port (also included in Nvidia drivers). 

This is a guide to solve the problem: 

1. If you got the BSOD, find a way (safemode or dualboot) to rename the file in windows > system32 > drivers > royal.sys to royal2.sys 

2. Your should not get the BSOD the next time you restart. Go to Control panel - Device Manager. 

3. Under System Devices you should see the Nforce4 PCI-Express Root Port. 

4. Right-click and choose Properties. 

5. Under the Driver tab choose Roll Back Driver. 

6. BEFORE you restart rename windows > system32 > drivers > royal2.sys back to royal.sys 

7. Restart now and it should be activated."

anyone know the pw?"
,glitch21,2007-04-25T03:27Z,"hi need some help with this, kinda new to all this so any better clear guidlines would be great, im stuck on this part 

4. Install the OEM certificate matching your OEM selection during driver installation by running

   SLMGR.VBS -ilc .XRM-MS

   (e.g. ""SLMGR.VBS -ilc C:\ASUS.XRM-MS"" if you chose to install the default driver and extracted
    the certificate file to C:\)

not really sure wot they mean on driver installation either 

thanks people"
