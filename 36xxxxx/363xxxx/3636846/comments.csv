,brgr,2007-03-26T11:43Z," I found a way how to install the game.
It's real simple.
Just download WINRar from www.rarlabs.com,
open the ISO's with WINRar and extract the files to one folder.
Then you launch setup.exe and install.
The CD Key may be found in the readme you downloaded.
Enjoy...
And TVSEE99, WTF!"
,sutki,2007-04-01T17:35Z,cd key is 5000-000000000-00000000-5034
,ochiana05,2007-04-14T17:54Z,"Copy and install in the same directory the 2 file in the ISO.

After that, when i am trying to play the game:
""Please insert the correct CD-ROM, select OK and restart application""

?? Any idea why ??"

download this file and mount it (this is for those who cannot start the game) and the play the game. The image file works as a crack, but ull have to keep it mounted all the time when u want 2 play"
