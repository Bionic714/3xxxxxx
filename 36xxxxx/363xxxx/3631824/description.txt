BBC footage from 9/11 - Mentions Explosions at WTC

This is a video clip from the BBC, in which the sound of explosions can be heard seconds BEFORE the North Tower falls down.

In the interview, the person being interviewed says:

"Then, an hour later, we had that big explosion, from much much lower. I don't know what on earth caused that."

Thunderous booms can be heard just after the "motorcycle" drives past the man being interviewed (Stephen Evans) -- and then after the booms occur, you hear bystanders say "Oh my GOD!" while looking and pointing toward the North Tower. A few seconds after that, there's another explosion -- the person being interviewed then covers his ears in a fright and turns around to see the tower begin to fall.

The camera that recorded this audio evidence of explosions was obviously some distance away from the North Tower (perhaps 3/4 of a mile away) creating a sound delay, so the explosions would have occurred a couple of seconds earlier than what is represented in the video.

Here is a partial transcript of the interview:

Stephen Evans: "...someone said they saw an airliner go into one of those towers. Then... I don't know... an hour later than that, we heard that big explosion from much, much lower. I don't know what on earth caused that...

(Motorcycle drives past Stephen Evans)

(((BOOOOOOOOM)))

Bystanders: "Oh my GOD! (pointing and looking in the direction of the North Tower)

(((BOOOOOOOOM)))

Stephen Evans: "...People were just talking to each other, nodding their heads... (stops talking and raises hands up to ears in a fright. Screams are heard from the people standing in the street as more explosions occur -- and the North Tower begins to fall.)

And just to clarify, the South Tower had already fallen when this interview took place -- and that is what Stephen Evans is referencing when he said:

"Then... I don't know... an hour later than that, we heard that big explosion from much, much lower. I don't know what on earth caused that...
