,yayoikh,2008-03-26T06:51Z,"Hi, thank you so much for uploading this.  This version of Cats is my favorite and I had always felt it was a shame that there wasn't a soundtrack with this cast.  I just seemed to have a problem with playing 4 songs: ""Overture"" (1st track), ""The Naming of Cats,"" ""The Rum Tum Tugger,"" and the ""Memory"" reprise (track 18).  Do you know if those 4 files were encoded differently?  Thanks so much for your help, and for making this rip in the first place!"

Sorry to hear about your problems. No, all files are ancoded in the same way."
,CalebDarkwing,2009-03-27T05:59Z,I'm having the same problem as yayoikh. =(
,annorlunda45,2009-04-20T21:37Z,"Sorry to hear about your problems, cant figure out what the problem is. All tracks are ripped in a single session so they should all be coded in the same way. 
I cant direct you elsewhere because the only other torrent that I think contain this version (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4148069/Cats_[Musical]) is probably a dublicate of this one."
