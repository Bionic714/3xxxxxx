,gregersamsa,2007-03-18T01:50Z,"Why is sound on some Orenji releases so freakin poor?! In this day and age when more people have bigger TV:s, better sound systems. This rate of sounds quality is worse than an videotape from the 80's. It's amazingly poor quality, aren't they embarassed to release it like this? Comments please..."
