,Sharpguy09,2007-09-23T09:02Z,I can't watch it How do I do it 
,filmophile,2007-10-06T23:31Z,"@ Sharpguy09

Why can't you watch it? What video player are you using? What error message (if any) does it produce?

In many cases you just need to download a codec. Check for ""codec pack"" in google and download from the first site. Works for me."

,mppkmron,2009-12-30T22:58Z,"It is fullscreen (4:3). Still,  quality is good enough that it can be stretched to widescreen so video then becomes 9/10. Also some of the accent is difficult to understand. Subtitles:

,jblackme,2012-01-06T10:43Z,ppl say the vid qulity isn't perfect but its from 1999 so its not going to be as clean as newer flicks.. derp.. if it's a dvd file it should look the same as the dvd. im pretty sure the film IS a bit gritty on dvd
,jblackme,2012-01-06T10:44Z,"holy ballsack batman! im getting 1.5 mb/s download rate. thanks for seeding, bitches!"
