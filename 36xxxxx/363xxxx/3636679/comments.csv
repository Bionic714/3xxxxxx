,anglingpro,2010-01-15T14:45Z,Hey odoinn....where is II and III??
,Drakuun,2011-02-12T20:37Z,Unit II and III do not exist (yet?).

I am ethnic Ukrainian from Belarus who live in America, Russian and Belarusian are my first languages, then English, and then I learned Ukrainian. I used different software though. I think Pimsleur goes quite slowly, I like that."
