,Aezuregos,2008-12-31T16:05Z,"Yo dudero's, I first see a bunch of idiots talking about the upload, and after a mile of scrolling I see someone talking about virusses. Listen once and for all: If you cross the street watch left and right and if it's save walk! If you download, check it first. Don't give those hacking cockwankers the opportunity to rape your hardware. Sorry for the disrespectful post, but calm down and be a lil' smart!

Happy new year all."
