,Metonomy,2007-03-28T01:08Z,Good idea to put together those torrents in one package!
,complexc25,2007-04-06T04:01Z,"Thanks a lot!
Great Quality and Speed"
,elsafanni,2007-04-07T14:08Z,but how do one open these files? dont get it....
,complexc25,2007-04-07T17:37Z,"this torrent includes other torrents corresponding to each episode, you have to download each separately.

This is truly amazing. A work of Art!
thanks again"
,Cireelim,2007-05-22T23:47Z,"Please seed!! This is great stuff, but the download speed is very low.. =("
,Cireelim,2007-05-22T23:53Z,"Download each separately? So I can't download them all at the same time? I notised that the download speed increased when I paused the other torrents but.. is it really so?! If it's like that - please seed, and I will do the same =)"
,Jalockin,2007-05-25T00:15Z,"who ever ripped this of the television, forgot the narrator - I have to turn up the volume so high to hear the narrator, that my neighbours complain about the loud music !!"

I haven't downloaded it yet, but it sounds like you have the problem.  I suggest you look at your AC3 settings before you post."
,robcat007,2007-09-21T22:56Z,Awesome Torrent! Thanks!
,Habichtshorst,2009-04-13T20:18Z,"I have problems viewing Episode 5 and 6, even with the latest VLC player installed. Picture is behind, lots of pixels, and then jumps ahead to where the narrator is. Running OSX 10.5.6 and the latest VLS 0.9.9a.

Anyone any suggestions on how to fix it and play it correctly?"
,antb1984,2011-12-14T15:25Z,Habichtshorst.. if u are using VLC n the timing is out use (K) key or the (H) key 2 adjust the ratio of video 2 audio and u can make the delay rite.....
,neuroxik,2012-05-30T02:18Z,"Such a great idea! Thanks!
(Luckily I read the torrent title, I was sorting by size and would have never bothered to check a torrent beneath 1 MB)"
