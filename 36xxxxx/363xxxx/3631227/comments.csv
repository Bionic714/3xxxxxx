,webrosc,2007-03-08T02:07Z,Doesn't work with HD Advance
,jennysalala,2007-03-08T15:41Z,I think it should work with HD Loader modified. Try using HD Loader 8b. It's the free version with much more compatibility.

,jennysalala,2007-03-10T22:30Z,"Part2/New. It was made for PSP. It's all the events that happened before the actual game. There is also Liberty City Stories.

So, it's ""stories"" that happened before Tommy Vercetti came in."
