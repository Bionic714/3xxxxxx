And i wanted to keep a copy of this Cheesy, Yet PowerFully Mezmorizing Movie... LOL

Hope this Torrent is leGit!"
,ThWar,2007-03-27T20:39Z,"Um . . . Uh . . .
There's no Sound!
I played this in WMP (Windows Media Player), and there's no sound to this puppy!

That SuX!  If you know how i could get sound working on it i'd LOVE to know...

I'm not even sure if i should keep seeding it for everyone either... will do for now though."
,evilgold,2007-04-05T08:47Z,"As it says in the info file, the sound is encoded in ac3, so your windows media player probably doesnt support it. You should try a real media player like VLC media player."
,barsalej,2007-10-07T06:47Z,"Yeah!  VLC rules! Try that and be happily surprised! 

Hey, thanks for the movie! I have been searching for this for some time. I only had it on VHS... so, yes, it has been many years since I have seen this wonderful ""cheap"" movie. Thanx again! "

,jawils,2010-05-14T20:19Z,I love this movie - I'm gonna seed this FOREVER!
,RazorRape,2012-03-01T03:39Z,Good upload. Try divx+ instead of VLC if you want a better media player.

Shame there's none of those magic shades!!"
