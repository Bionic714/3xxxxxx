,aweirdly,2007-03-10T04:24Z,"She forgot to mention he that last month was sentenced to up to 26 years in jail for ripping off the IRS and refusing to pay taxes.  He is currently in a Florida prison praying to get out.

BTW he is not a REAL doctor and home schooled his children thereby giving himself ""teaching"" credentials.

Is this the best you Creationist got!?!?!"

If you think the 6000 year old earth Idea is stupid, prove it wrong and pick up a sweet $250 000 he offers to anyone who can... if not, shut up and pick up a bible. You might learn something! 
oh, and 'alonemanteam' (aptly named) I'm from New Zealand.. and there's a great deal of kiwi's (New Zealanders) who love God. Guess that makes you wrong :("

,demuffinman,2008-10-13T05:10Z,"FELLOW CHRISTIANS: Carefully examine what you teach for proof of creation and WHO you lift up.

First, Kent Hovind continuously uses known fallacious and shaky arguments.

Second, his personal, unrepentant conduct has only hurt the main focus, that is evangelizing.

,oggetheg,2008-12-30T23:00Z,Genesis 1:1 God can suck my dick.
,Jonny645,2009-08-30T03:47Z,"""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""

,sky33blue,2010-02-10T17:57Z,hate from atheists ? that's a good sign --> truth hurt ! when you fell yourself weak words are your only way to offend others ;Kent Hovind is an extraordinary man ;many thanks!

,kevelev,2012-04-04T21:03Z,"I know I'm commenting 5 years after the last comment here, but this last guy said ""It is only Americans who believe in creationism"".  What planet are you from?  

A.) Neither Christianity nor creationism are ""American"" created concepts. 

B.) Almost EVERY RELIGION BELIEVES IN CREATION OR A FORM OF DIVINE CREATION...YOU IDIOT!!  (However it's the Bible that has been 100% accurate on all of its' prophecies...do yourself & a favor & actually read it before criticizing)

C.)  Do some F*cking research before posting stupid comments.  It's the now generation & generations to come that are more & more mislead & LAZY.  They all speak, 'blog' or 'post' (in your case) before they think it through.  All you needed to do was google Muslim beliefs, Jewish or Buddhist beliefs & you'd plainly see they ALL believe in a deity or divine creator.

D.)  Did you go to school anywhere or did you get your religious studies from your xbox & playstation?

E.)  STOP bashing Americans.  If you don't live here then you don't know what it's like to be in our shoes or what we stand for, regardless of what Hollywood & your slandered, illuminati controlled media outlet tells you. 

F.)  Why do you hate creation theory or Christians so much?  Did you ever actually think of that?  Or are you simply just full pride & worried that you will be wrong about there being a god?  Seriously!  Think about why you are arguing.  What did Jesus EVER do to make you hate him so much?  What do you have to lose in believing in a creator that loves you & wants to instill some morals in your life that separate you from an animal?  I think it's because you want to justify your LACK of morals & need to believe YOU are god & in control of your own universe, right?  If I've pissed you off then you know I'm right

G.)  If that was a 7 year old that typed that last comment then I forgive you.

Funny how the U.S. which flag-shipped world democracy & civil rights to the entire world is now being blamed for it now going to shit.  The American people haven't had a choice in electing a president since JFK (do the research-the Christian president that was shot...hmm?).  So, as far as ""from the USA to the world"", I think it's time for the world to help us the f*ck out & pick up some slack in helping win this battle because if we go down then so does the rest of the world (since we are the reserve currency)

Our country has been hijacked by the globalists folks & those like Kent Hovind, Bill Cooper, John Todd, Fritz Springmeier & many others who are trying to save us are being killed, jailed, or silenced.  All they are trying to do is bring us back under the constitution & re-establish the moral fiber under which this country was founded.  What's wrong with that?  YOU need to wake up.  Evolution is just one of their many silent weapons of deception making you believe that you are nothing more than an evolved animal.  When you teach your kids this concept then they start acting like animals (you've just been tricked).  We are not animals.  The evidence is out there people, but it's up to you to find it.  Help out in beating these globalists that have stolen our country & bankrupted the world economy!"
