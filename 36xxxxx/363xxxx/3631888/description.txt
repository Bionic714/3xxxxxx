Released by the Straight Arrow label, this infamous performance of September 27 1974 has the reputation of being Elvis? worst-ever concert. Personally, while i'll say not one of the best perfomances at all, i don't think it's really the worst ever.
It's an audience recording, although it's good, it's not excellent.
