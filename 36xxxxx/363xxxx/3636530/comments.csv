Anyways, I just wanted to recommend this movie. It's vastly superior to the crappy remake with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep (where there was no link to Manchuria except it being the name of a company!).

Frank Sinatra puts on a pretty convincing performance and if you can live with the sixties-style fight scenes it's definately worth watching.
