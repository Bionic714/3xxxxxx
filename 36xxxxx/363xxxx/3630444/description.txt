Pink Floyd  The Man and The Journey rehearsals 1969 

Black and White film clip of Floyd rehearsing for a gig at the Queen Elizabeth Festival Hall in 1969.

Comprises material from.......


Ummagumma.
More.
Relics.

There are moments with no sound.... 

Just before the end an argument develops between the cameraman Anthony Stern and the Festival Hall management, the scene becoming just audio with no picture, a great video clip.

Hope you like it..
