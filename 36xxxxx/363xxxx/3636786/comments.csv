,g8aso,2007-03-11T15:04Z,"This album is readily available from CD, it is a little pointless polluting a digital medium with analogue vinyl recordings, although your overall effort is appreciated"
,Dave The Barbarian,2007-03-11T16:16Z,"Interesting comment. Though it is a little bit pointless polluting other peoples efforts with pompous bullshit! Not everyone, including me has this on CD, so I thought I'd share, freely, and don't need what is ultimately an infantile comment dressed up to be thought provoking and meaningful. Ta very much!"
,eggewert2,2007-03-11T17:17Z,"Hahahaha! Never heard that before! :) How could any analogue source ever pollute a digital medium?  What does that mean, exactly? And, if you despise the analog domain, why don't you just chop your ""analog"" head off and stick to a digital reconstruction?"
,Dave The Barbarian,2007-03-11T20:18Z,"Cheers eggewert2 your comment ARE appreciated. I did do a search for this torrent, ie The League, The Human League...guess what, couldn't find it, so g8aso, should be gr8asshole, can go fuck him/her self. For true audiophiles ""analogue"" vinyl recordings are true recordings. Whilst the invention of the CD may have stunted the forward motion of vinyl...it didn't really kill it, the same as cassette tapes didn't kill records. Anyone who takes times recording vinyl to their PCs and then cleaning and uploading them should be admired not fucking slated. It takes more time, and consideration for music and others, to do so than ripping a CD with AudioGrabber!"

,Dave The Barbarian,2007-03-27T09:32Z,"TO ALL.....I have managed to get this thing going again and I am now seeding. I will do so for the rest of the day. Had a few problems with my BT Client. Wouldn't do anything. Tried Azureus, but damn the speeds were slow. Had to reinstall BitLord and everything seems to be going okay. ;)"
,bjddbnbdkbgdfk,2008-01-15T10:39Z,sum1 plz seed im stuck on 82%
,zarathustra2k1,2008-04-19T05:48Z,"Top Album - had it on cassette many, many moons ago.

Thanx for the up. =#"
