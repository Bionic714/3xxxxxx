I did a lot of searching on the Net to find all of these files. I did NOT make any of these files. It took me awhile to find them all so I wanted to put all files into one folder to share with everyone and to save someone else from having to search the Net for them.

   I had found out by accident on a website forum that The Monster Squad movie was shown last year (2006) on VOOM TV in a monster movie marathon -IN HIGH DEFINITION! So I went looking for it! I didn't find the TS files themselves but I did find DVD files made from the TS recording! These DVD files are all ready to burn with NERO DVD-Burning ROM. Whoever made these DVD files did an EXCELLENT job! The video is sharp and clear! The colors are bold and beautiful! The sound is loud and clear! No digital artifacts!

   While I was looking for the HDTV file, I accidentally found the VERY RARE movie soundtrack/score by Bruce Broughton, so I am including it for those collectors who may want it!

   I ALSO came across DVD-ROM labels made by Dark Jedi (to give him credit), which I am also including! They look fantastic! He did very good work on them! 
  
   I have successfully burned the DVD files onto disc with NERO 7 DVD Burning ROM. Disc plays great! I had NERO set to "fit to disc" and burned to a regular single-layer DVD-5. The DVD files are already about 4 GB so it should fit with little-to-no compression!

   I have also played the soundtrack files and printed a DVD cover jacket and it looks great! NO ONE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED! 

   The soundtrack files are MP3 @ 192 kbps. The music files are all named "monster squad". These files were created this way.

   Also, when I played the movie from the burned disc from NERO, it played in my DVD player and home stereo as Dolby Digital 2.0. Again, I did not make these files but the movie sounds FANTASTIC in only DD 2.0! Very loud and clear!

   Last, while searching for the HDTV files, I ALSO came across a website which told the story/plot of The Monster Squad with screen shots from the movie itself. It looks cool!

   I have found out in my search that The Monster Squad movie will be released to DVD (OFFICIALLY!) this year(2007) POSSIBLY in October! 2007 is the 20th anniversary for the movie. More info is here at Fangoria:
