,dahulk12,2007-03-07T02:02Z,"  For clarification, the release for the DVD is POSSIBLY October for the United States. It didn't say when for other countries. I assume around the same time. 
  And as for those who want to know the aspect ratio, it is 1.78:1 in HI-DEF. The new DVD release will be 2.35:1. "
