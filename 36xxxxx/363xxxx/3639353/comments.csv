,bleater,2007-07-26T05:09Z,"OKay... thank you to the lazyweb.. the subs in this file http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3132359/fauteuils-d-orchestre-en work.. you will need to rename from Fauteuils d'orchestre (2006).LIMITED.DVDSCR.XviD-THRiVE.eng.srt to wrd-orchestra.srt, and place in the same folder as wrd-orchestra.avi. Cheers."
