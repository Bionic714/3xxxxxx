Getting butt fucked not by choice is called rape, just like your buddy Kent is going through rotting in his jail cell."

,kneebow,2008-04-15T10:25Z,"Your words condemn you.  Your head is off and you are serving somebody, just you don?t realize its Satan.  Be a real man or woman and serve Christ, because you have to serve somebody, and wouldn?t you rather go to heaven than hell ? both places are real by the way.  If you want to go to hell, give me your eyes because that would make more sense.  Do you want to keep your hand on a burring stove for more than a moment?  Then why would you want your whole soul to be burning for eternity?  You guys make no sense because you can?t be reasoned with; which only goes to show that your head is off.  Why is it that the stupidest people with their heads off condemning a religion of Truth, for Jesus said, ?I am the way the truth, and the life, no one comes to the father except through me.?  All other religions are false and Christ is the only true deity who can redeem you from your wickedness, your sins.  Please trust in Christ and repent.  Only the will you know what it means to have a head."
,ethanoic,2008-05-27T14:19Z,"As a non-religious amateur theologian, I can say that most christians who have any theological training do not expect everyone to believe the bible is true.

Looking at all the authors presented here, they are all Calvinists. Calvinism is the doctrine that only those predestined to salvation will be saved. Thus any christian holding to these doctrines will not expect you to believe the bible but would rather expect you to be incapable of believing it unless you are one of the elect.

Modern Calvinists include John Piper, J I Packer and John McArthur."
,kneebow,2008-05-29T07:58Z,"It says in The Book of Romans that all who confess the name of the Lord will be saved.  It also says this in the Book of Joel and refenaced by Peter in the sceond chapter of Acts.  I am not disputing Calvin, but their is an interplay between the choice of a person and God leading them to that choice, utherwise we would not be guilty of sin, God would (who of course is innocent.)  JUdas went to hell because he choose to betray Jesus, but he also did God's will.  So this is what I mean.  Keep it up, this is intresting."
,kneebow,2008-05-29T08:05Z,"It says in 1st Timothy that God wants all people to come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved.  We do not know who the elect are and shouldn't assume that all unbelivers can't go to heaven, because they could come to Christ if they asked Him into their heart, and even some self proclaimed CHristians might not go to Heaven becaouse they could be false converts like Judas.  Anybody can be a Christian if they seek God with their whole heart, ask, knock, seek.  This is Biblical.  But is also true that God chooses people to be elect before they are concieved, as the case is with Jacob and Easu and the twelve tribes of Israel as a whole, who rejected the Christ (if they beilve in Judism) and only a remant will be saved in the end, as it is mentioned in the Book of Romans.  Look it up.  God is merciful and loving, and I repeat, wants all people to be saved."
