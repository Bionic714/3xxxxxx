The Strat Pack - assembled by ACK

LAME, 192 kBit/s joint stereo.

These mp3's are ripped from a DVD9 rip that I downloaded with Bittorrent. I have
to admit however that I sort of downloaded these 7GB and a half for only one
song, which happens to be Gary Moore's version of Jimi Hendrix' Red house, which
happens to be f*cking brilliant (look it up at"Gary Moore Red House",
first hit). Besides Gary Moore and some other great artists there are really
HORRIBLE performers on this DVD so beware! (well, at least the performance of
some is really bad, I guess they have proven them selfs in the past.)

The first intention was to transcode it to xvid4 because there was some kind of
demand for it, but after 44 hours of transcoding on a 450MHz P3 (best I got :p )
the audio turned out to be out of sync and the interlacing was just... well...
very much there. I threw it away, ripped the audio track and encoded it to mp3,
LAME style!
