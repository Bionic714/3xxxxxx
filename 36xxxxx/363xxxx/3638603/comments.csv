,KiLLeRa,2007-09-27T00:28Z,"go to http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=1112 and dl the crack, then go to program files, activision, interstate '82 and replace the existing file with this one, its ok to delete the file...
after your done with that, rename the i82.stubb to i82.stubbz or anything that is different, after that YOU CAN ONLY PLAY THE GAME FROM THAT ICON
whenever you need to play, go to program files, activision, interstate '82 and play from is82 stubbz

,Fighterlegend,2010-02-17T06:08Z,"Downloaded, installed, got a no-cd crack, and I don't want to play the game any further.

Each crack I get ends up to be either a virus or a virus downloader. It sucks.
The links you guys referred, don't work."

,Q__boii,2012-07-27T22:06Z,"No music? It sucks! I will remove it and reinstall it from my original CD when I'll get a working DVD player for my laptop.
Besides that, the game works like a champ though."
