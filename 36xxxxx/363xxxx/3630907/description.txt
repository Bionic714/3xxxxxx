The one uploaded so far to TPB did not work for me, so here is another one I found at demonoid. Made a tracker list out of it to try keeping the swarm together. Hope it works.

I do not abandon my torrents, but myPC is not always on and I never seed at night, (CET). Fair upload speed.

Original comment:
"Kim tries to fix an old car her dad gives to her, but soon hands the job over to the Tweebs for a very long contract. Meanwhile, Shego and Motor Ed join forces to steal Project Kepler from the space center. They modify it and plan to go hypersonic and destroy the Earth. Kim finds her new car unable to keep up with the Kepler and has the Tweebs modify it again. Kim now must jump onto a speeding rocket to save the day.
