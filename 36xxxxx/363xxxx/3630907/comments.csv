Grande Size Me airs today in the States. I'm not a capper (can only access Swedish Disney Channnel so no point), so we have to wait for some kind person..."
,Garoth,2007-04-17T15:33Z,May I ask for episode 1 - 2 - 3 too? :) would be awsome
,Garoth,2007-04-17T17:10Z,"And a few of the downloads on the other episodes wont start, Im using Azureus.
Got any ideas why?"
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-04-27T22:39Z,"OK, will do, but not today. No idea why you have problems, other than that the tracker is sometimes overloaded. I also use Azureus."
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-04-28T12:42Z,"OK, I uploaded 1-4.  Start with
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3675253/Kim_Possible_-_S04E01_-_Ill_Suited

As for problems with download, you can with Azureus try to double click the torrent to see all its parameters, right-click the tracker URL, and change between the trackers available. That may help."

,vampire101,2007-06-30T16:16Z,thank you for the upload!
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-10-20T20:00Z,"I'm no longer seeding these KP torrents, but as it is a multiple tracker torrent most likely you can find peers - the traffic through the other tracker used to be quite large."
