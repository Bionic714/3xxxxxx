"Swamp Noir" is how Robert Fisher and his colleagues in this Bostonian collective once described their music and it's as good a phrase as any. Above all, their third--and best--album is moody, atmospheric music of monumental proportions.

One moment it can help you visualise the wide-open spaces of the western deserts, in the next you're in a dank warehouse comforting Fisher's baritone-voiced laments. Mojave is distressing yet consoling; gloomy yet enlightening.

Above all, however, it's the rich textures that they achieve through employing virtually every conceivable acoustic instrument that makes this stand out above the Sparklehorses and Sixteen Horsepowers of this world.

They know how to make things sparse and in "The Work Song" and the entirely gorgeous "I Miss You Best" they have songs that can never ever be eradicated from the listener's memory.

Mojave is quite simply one of the most moving and captivating albums...ever.
