Due to numerous requests from people I have decided to re-release this torrent. The reason was that even though this is an iso file full game. A lot of people either did not have a cd burner or didn't know how to use a CD emulator  like Daemon tools or alcohol 120. They wanted the no-cd patch. I will tell you it is hard to find a no-cd patch US version and that too the latest one. Most of the people who got it from game burn world or game copy world complained it was a UK patch and wasn't working. I don't remember how I got mine but it was from a site that not in english. The patch works perfectly fine. 

PLEASE READ THE DETAILS BELOW BEFORE YOU ASK QUESTIONS HERE. FOR THIS REASON ALL THE DETAILS WILL BE IN CAPS:

THE NO-CD CRACK IS TOTALLY OPTIONAL. YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME BY MOUNTING THE F22 ISO WITH AN EMULATOR LIKE DAEMON TOOLS OR ALCOHOL 120 OR BURN IT TO A CD. HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO USE THE NO-CD CRACK THEN MAKE SURE YOU KEEP A COPY SAVED AS A BACKUP. 

YOU WILL USE THIS NO-CD CRACK TWICE. ONCE AFTER YOU INSTALL THE GAME.AND AGAIN AFTER YOU UPDATE THE GAME. YOU WILL WANT TO UPDATE THE GAME SINCE MANY OF YOU WILL WANT TO PLAY IT ONLINE. AFTER YOU UPDATE THE GAME JUST COPY THE NO-CD CRACK AGAIN IN GAME FOLDER.

BEFORE INSTALLING THE GAME I SUGGEST YOU RIGHT CLICK ON THE SETUP FILE THEN CLICK PROPERTIES AND THEN COMPATIBILITY. SET THE COMPATIBILITY TO WINDOWS 98 IN ORDER TO AVOID POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH WINDOWS XP. SO IT'S BETTER YOU DON'T USE THE AUTORUN FEATURE. BEFORE YOU RUN THE GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME AGAIN RIGHT CLICK ON THE EXECUTABLE FILE AND PROPERTIES AND SET IT TO WINDOWS 98. THE GAME SHOULD THEN RUN SMOOTHLY.

IF YOU ARE BEHIND A ROUTER OR FIREWALL THEN MAKE SURE YOU OPEN PORTS  FROM 4533 TO 4660. YOU CAN DO THIS BY USING THE PORT FORWARD OPTION IN YOUR ROUTER. THIS WILL ENABLE YOU TO PLAY ONLINE ON NOVAWORLD.

YOU CAN USE THE UPDATE PATCH I HAVE INCLUDED IN THIS TORRENT OR UPDATE YOUR GAME FROM WITHIN THE GAME BY CLICKING UPDATE. REMEMBER AGAIN YOU HAVE TO COPY THE NO-CD PATCH AGAIN AFTER YOU UPDATE. WHEN YOU ARE DONE UPDATING THEN COME ONLINE SO WE CAN HAVE SOME DOG FIGHTS :-)

HAVE FUN!!
