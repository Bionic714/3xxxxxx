,Rickets,2008-05-22T23:28Z,"@tmjam2002: This is great, thank you. I have small problem with online play. Game is updated and running with crack. Updated again and again through the game and re-cracked. All exe's are unblocked by firewall so no manual port opening is needed, no?

When Novawrld.exe runs it attempts to connect
or it seems to be loading: http://208.231.90.229/l3aulogin2.htm

but it fails after 20+ seconds and displays dialog box:
fatal error
error: can't connect to URL

So I can't get online with this, it's sad, what should I try? Thanks again"
,Rickets,2008-05-22T23:39Z,"ok, sorry, updated a few more times and something small changed:
when Novawrld loads it's a new page:
l3uslogin2.htm

But it doesn't make any difference, Fatal error still persists.

Now if I don't paste crack and try another update it says no update needed. What should I try?"
,Rickets,2008-05-23T00:12Z,"lol, sorry, i patched files using www.novalogic.com

thank you again this game is great"
,abletonlive05,2008-10-01T11:12Z,"its alot better if you download it from emule.


there are several diffrent versions of this game floating around. one is all jacked up and looks like a sega genesis and then there is the newer version and it looks alot better. its a cool game.


however - the online multiplayer does not work. I guess they have a new type of server not supported by f22 lightning but it works on newer games though."
,MFKR1,2008-10-23T10:00Z,"How do you install the game? Nothning happens when i'm trying to install it with autorun or just the setup-file, even though I have chosen the windows 98 compatibility... Help please!"
,Tualatin,2008-10-26T02:55Z,"Just FYI there was another online patch @ http://novalogic.com/download/nlexepatcher.html

However I have a strong belief it ain't gonna help :-\"
,kreed1,2011-09-24T02:47Z,"Sorry my BAD.It works.For those ppl who have checked compatibility for win 98 make sure in your desktop properties your color system is set to 32 bit.

right click anywhre on desktop/click on properties/go to settings tab/and under colour quality set to 16 bit colour."
