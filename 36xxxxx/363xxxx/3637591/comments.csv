,L_Larry,2007-03-12T14:43Z,"No use, it may take you a minute to download, but it's all laggy."
,sN1b,2007-03-12T17:35Z,Then your using either a crappy player or crappy codecs. Read the FAQ.
,sN1b,2007-03-12T17:39Z,VLC would be a crappy player btw.
,lofty53,2007-03-12T19:58Z,I followed the instructions and it plays great for me
,L_Larry,2007-03-12T20:21Z,"What would NOT be  crappy then? I have vlc, and Windows media player 11, didn't do it for me. And  my russian is a bit rusty so that faq didn't help me much."
,L_Larry,2007-03-12T23:03Z,"Okey, got it working now, but when I copy pasted that link some german page came up, but got your faq in the end..... I have never worked this hard just to get an episode to work before :P"
,sN1b,2007-03-13T03:33Z,True but it's a one time job and you're now ready for all h264 video.
,tito13kfm,2007-03-13T11:38Z,"x264 encode with a crf of 33 is a bit low for my liking, but I must say I have to give you props for using a superior codec."

,wurstfinger,2007-05-07T22:09Z,"Here's an advice that tries to be helpful instead of smart-assy:

While VLC can't play this well, MPlayer can, even on Mac OS X. Get it here: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html"
