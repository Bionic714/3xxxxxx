How to install Star Wars Rebel Assault
--------------------------------------

1 - Make a folder on your C: drive like this ---> C:REBEL
2 - Copy all the files in the "REBEL" folder to C:REBEL
3 - Install DOSBOX v0.65 [I've included it in this package]
4 - Copy the dosbox.conf file to C:Program FilesDOSBox-0.65
    * Overwrite the one that is already there *
5 - Start the game by running "DOSBox" now located in your start menu

All being well, you are now playing Star Ware Rebel Assault on your windows PC :)

In the event it does NOT work for you... open the dosbox.conf file and
check out all the settings. You may need to change something.

Additional Information
----------------------

Here's another gem from the 90's for the Star Wars fans out there.
Once again, thanks to the "DOSBox" program, I was able to get this working
on my current XP machine.

More information on DOSBox and the latest version can be found at...
 
http://dosbox.sourceforge.net

You can use a joystick or the mouse to control all the action.

As an added bonus, I've captured all of cutscenes to a single file.
These are in NTSC VCD format as the cutscenes are low res to begin with ;)

I have also downloaded some walkthroughs and cheats too.

Hope you enjoy this game as much as I have.

Please leave a comment wherever you downloaded this from if you enjoy it :)
