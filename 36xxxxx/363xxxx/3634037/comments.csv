,BabyNo1,2008-04-03T17:41Z,"I was dissapointed... I had so much more expectations on this movie...
I thought it would be more ""specific""... 
Worth DL? Well.. if you don't have anything else to DL, then it's worth it...

I also saw the flick about Henry Lee Lucas, that film was an even larger dissapointment.. that one is deffinetly not worth DL!!

The quality was great though... and thanks for the UP!"
