,petterhot,2007-07-21T23:07Z,"The programs start, and act normally, when i add a .avi file i the timeline, only the sounds play. No preview in the preview window. What is this?"
,PirateOnPirates,2007-08-09T00:36Z,"The .avi not playing is a problem with the file itself. Some files Vegas cannot work with. Your best bet is to download Virtualdub and save open the .avi in VirtualDub, then save as 'old avi format.'
Worked for some stuff a while back. This program rocks, once you try it, buy it if you use it! Worth every penny. "
