Gnr will never be gnr again whitout the original members! No mather what what Axl wants.

Velvet revolver is more gnr than this crap."
,lordofthesword,2008-03-02T17:01Z,"Axl Rose is stupid if he thinks he can recreate guns and roses without any of the other original members. Guns and roses were a band, not an axl rose solo project, im viewing this as axls first solo album rather than supporting a fake gnr."
