,Dead-Inside,2007-03-05T23:14Z,"No multiplayer?

Because I DLd this when it was out in hopes of it, but now, only ""tutorial""-like SP maps. Such a waste."
,Storm_661,2007-03-07T01:06Z,"The multiplayer won't work, because much like BF2 you need to connect to the novalogic server to see the other servers.

And you need to make an account to do that, once you make the acct, you need to add a valid CD key to make your account valid.

Game is really not that great without the multiplayer, since the game designers made it strictly a mulitplayer game."
