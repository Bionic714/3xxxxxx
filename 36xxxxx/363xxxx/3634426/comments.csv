,DataSchmuck,2007-03-08T06:54Z,Good preparation material for the upcoming S.T.A.L.K.E.R.- Shadow of Chernobyl game coming out.
,made-of-technetium,2007-03-08T16:04Z,Haven't heard of that game but will be keeping an eye out for it. Will it be available for PC or just Console?
,DataSchmuck,2007-03-09T05:50Z,"PC Only I think.  Google it, there should be plenty of info on it, been waiting for it for five years, very anticipated game.  

As for this show, unless you know either Swedish or Russian, you will miss half the story, as the  little dramatic sequences aren't voiced over in English like the rest of the show.

Still, you get the basic idea of what happened.  "
