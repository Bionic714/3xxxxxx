The March mixtape is already loooing good with the track by Aereogramme and Hal Duncan from 'Ballads of the Book' ready and waiting (probably my favourite track of 2007 so far)! "

,Widget:,2007-04-13T00:19Z,"Hey thanks, to be honest I do not really like all these emo ""i cant make good music but I am such a stylish individual come check me out"" stuff and mainstream 'alternative' bands
but in your mixes there is always a handful really great artists I did not know before.

So keep up the good work :) "
