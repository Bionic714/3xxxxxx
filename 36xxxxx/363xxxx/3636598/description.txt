An anti-nuclear group on ship in Charleston South Carolina has taken a local T.V. reporter and his cameraman hostage and is demanding a live network feed. When the feed is given the leader of the group an ex-Pentagon weapons planner announces that he and his colleagues have a home-made bomb on board. Unless all the nuclear warheads in the Charleston area are disarmed (a gesture of \\\"unilateral disarmament\\\") the group will illustrate the horrible effects of such weapons.

Just before the terrorist\\\'s deadline, the government seeming gives in to the terrorist demands but unknowing to the group, launches a secret commando strike killing all the terrorist inside but one. 

Next the government brings in the NEST (Nuclear Emergency Search Team) to disarm the bomb before the time runs out. Can they do it time?

Filmed in actual newsreel format you\\\'ll be gripping the edge of your seat and forget that this is just a movie.

This movie is available only on VHS and hence the quality is somewhat limited by my own equipment to capture it off my original VHS version of the movie. Otherwise, enjoy what is a really a great movie.
