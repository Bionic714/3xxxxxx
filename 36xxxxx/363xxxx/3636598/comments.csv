I didn't realize that Illustrator did such a crappy job of exporting the cover for this torrent before I uploaded it. I unfortunately deleted the original files and had to scan in the printed cover and after some work got it to look how it should look. The images were never that great to begin with but the new cover is better than what is in the torrent. You can find it at Cdcovers.cc and search for ""Special Bulletin"" or click on this link:

Hope you are all enjoying the movie! Just don't watch it on your laptop at the airport ;)"
