THIS LESSER-KNOWN DEXTER GORDON ALBUM FROM 1960 CONTAINS SOME EXCELLENT HARD BOP, GREAT COMPOSITIONS & BURNING SOLOS !!!

AMG review:
Originally put out on Jazzland, this important recording was a comeback album by the great tenor Dexter Gordon, who had (with the exception of a couple of occasions in 1955) been largely off-record since 1952. Teamed up with trombonist Richard Boone (listed on the LP on trumpet), trumpeter Martin Banks, and pianist Dolo Coker, Gordon is in excellent form on the six selections, all originals by either the leader or Coker. Because of the large amount of Dexter Gordon recordings from his later years, this collection is not essential but fans should enjoy it.
