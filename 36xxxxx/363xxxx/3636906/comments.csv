,Fratyyr,2007-03-13T10:14Z,Do all of the former DVDs work properly and perfectly?
,user1,2007-03-13T15:27Z,"First of all, thank you very much for your work\uploads.  Great series!

And yes, they all work as they should. Unfortunately the discs containg 4 episodes (so far I have checked s1d4 and s2d2) suffer from a noticeable reduction in quality, i.e. distortion here and there."
,wizzie,2007-03-14T09:52Z,Thanks again Fratyyr! Great work! Kepp it up!
,Fratyyr,2007-03-15T00:45Z,"Regarding the quality.....the originals were double layer discs so the quality will not be as the original discs.
And I made a mistake with the first two series to copy them smooth instead of sharp.
However on the copies I made I dind't see any distortions.
Note: I will not upload the 4h serie due to the fact it's not worth it, it's different...Carol Drinkwater is replaced, suddenly they have children. So....according to me, my family and friends.....it's not worth it and I don't want to spend the time to this 4th serie.

Regards,
Fratyr"
