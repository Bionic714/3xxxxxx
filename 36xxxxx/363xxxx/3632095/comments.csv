,Kapox,2007-06-04T23:47Z,powerstrike: How on earth can a person call it techno!?!?!?! You must have been living in a f***ing hole your entire life to even consider that song even being remotely close to even resemble techno! Not even any techno sub genre... 
,iamgodfearme,2007-06-05T03:34Z,can you guys seed please
,Thune85,2007-10-20T00:20Z,"please seed this one. It's a dam good song!

I also need to agree with Kapox, it's not a techno-remix of the original. Thou, there is more bas, but still not techno =P"
