,Leakit,2007-03-09T01:44Z,"Yes i did test it and it runs fine for me. Did you burn it with alcohol? Try pressing the Spacebar at boot and enable the debug output.

please help.
thanks"
,aventis,2007-03-21T22:40Z,"Hello Leaket,

Just to report back when i burned cd via alcohol 120% by adding mdf file of image ( as mds file wont add alcohol reporting unsupported file format for mds file ) i get exact same error as reported by NicePics in these comments that "" the installer can't find the Zeta disc"" i tried space bar trick here as you suggested and i get the error i mentioned.
So what am i doing wrong? please guide and help as i got this torrnet in 10 days on my dial up and i dont wanna discrad it.

thanks,
regards,
aventis"
,aventis,2007-03-22T23:41Z,"hi, does anybody else have same problem as i got? and how solved?

thanks"
,aventis,2007-03-23T20:47Z,"Hi, for those who are downloading, this image is fine but you need one trick to apply to burn it. Get the latest version of Alcohol 120 % to burn it ( this worked for me ) and you should be a bit literate with how tos of Alcohol 120 % and it works fine.

Waiting for the Zeta OS 1.5 now , hope somebody uploads it soon.

regards

aventis"
,Leakit,2007-03-25T19:25Z,Does it work now?
,Leakit,2007-03-25T19:28Z,"The Step by Step guide would be:
o Download this.
o Extract
o Download (newest) Alcohol 120%
o Burn

Thats the way it worked for me...."
,aventis,2007-03-25T21:13Z,"Hi Leaket,

Thanks, the steps you mentioned already worked for me, and it got installed fine. One problem which was there in YellowTab Zeta 1.2 even with my system is that my creative sound blaster audigly card has some conflict and the sound comes muffled, this is still there with version 1.21 . any clue ( driver? ) of how to slove it ?
any luck with 1.5 upgrade till now??

thanks

regards,

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3650746

I would *love* to get ahold of Zeta 1.5"
,XDelusion,2007-03-30T20:30Z,"So does this keep asking you to register, or is that fixed in this release? Seeing as Magnusoft is no longer going to support this, it would be nice if there is a way around that annoying pop up! "
,XDelusion,2007-03-31T00:42Z,"Ok, it does not seem to want you to register which is VERY nice! I had a rip of 1.0 or 1.1 and this pop up always came on my screen during the middle of a game or what not, so it is nice to see this issue has been resovled.

Now if only I could get True Color in Vmware. :/"
,XDelusion,2007-04-02T21:58Z,"Ok, VESA drivers on Bebits.com will give you a color solution in VmWare in case anyone needs it, or if there video card it not fully supported.

 Also news as of today 4-2-06 on osnews.ccom states that since Zeta is on it's way out, sources will be handed over to the Free BeOS (Haiku) team:

 So in effect this download is no longer illegal and the OS will only get better!!!!!!

 Take that LINUX!!!! ;)"
,BaronVonchesto,2008-01-05T16:13Z,There is Zeta 1.5 here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3962663
,XDelusion,2008-02-29T19:31Z,"The link to 1.5 is dead. Was that a bogus link, or has it really been leaked on the net somewhere?

 I'd really like to get my hands on it."
,meechmunchie,2008-07-22T14:06Z,!!! - This Torrent is dead - !!!
