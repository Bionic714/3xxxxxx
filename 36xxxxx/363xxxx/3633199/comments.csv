These are packed in RAR files inside RAR files, when all you need are the NSKs.
UnRAR everything into one folder and delete the unnecessary PDFs and .DS Store files.
Making sure you are not online, boot up your sequencer and load up an instance of Nexus. Hit the SYS button to the right of the ""LCD display"". Choose ""Import Skin"". Browse to an NSK file and click OK. To display it, use the menu to the left of the Import button.
Once imported, the NSKs (about 400Kb each) are copied to the Nexus\Skins folder in your plug-ins directory, so you can delete the RARs.

I like the Kill Bill one best at the moment. :D"

Thanx for the skin torrent, but kinda messy archive I think."
,Stainers,2008-08-23T16:26Z,Can unpack it all fine but after I import it into Nexus it still doesn't show up in the skin menu.

,DeadND,2011-04-23T10:22Z,"How to import:
------------------------
- Download
-UnRAR
-Copy to the nexus content folder, wherever it's located on your drive and paste into the ""skins"" folder.
-Load DAW
-Load Nexus
- On the right hand side of the preset selection window, there will be a small box with ""sys"" on it
-Click on it, then at  the bottom right hand side of the screen you will see an ""import data"" button
-Click it and select the skin in your ""nexus content folder""
- You don't have to copy the skins to your content folder, but its practical.

,DeadND,2011-04-23T10:25Z,"* To load the skins, in the same ""sys"" window on the left hand side there will be a box which has a colour written on it. Click that and select your skin.
