,ArtistsSoul,2008-08-17T20:19Z,"I always find it funny when people from other countries just assume that all Hollywood-made movies, which take place in other historic periods, are going for accuracy. They are just movies! If you want historic accuracy go watch a documentary. We Americans all know that there is a difference between a movies and the real events-that's why it always says in the credits that it is ""based on historical events"" but that the events in the movie are fiction. So ANYWAY- I liked this movie a lot! It gives the watcher an idea of what those times were like and how people lived. I love it when a movie shows you what other times were like-period pieces. They just rule. And besides, Angelina Jolie...well she makes ANY movie worth the watching. Such a compelling actress!"
