,even_92_norway,2008-11-16T13:09Z,"Hi! Thank you sooo much for this one, N1976TS ^^)

But.. I didn't find any procedures (SID/STAR) in the FMC arrival/dep list. So I installed the newest payware AIRAC from navigraph, the CRJ_0811, but it's still nothing there! I have also tried to install CRJ_0810, WILCO_FT_0811 and WILCO_FT_0810 but i still have the same problem :(

Can somebody please help..?"
