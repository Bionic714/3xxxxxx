I apologize for any inconvenience."

thanks for the advice; the program is working ok, and it also stops outgoing packets from the spyware infecting my computer."

 the movie and the song should end at the EXACT same time! yours is 62 seconds off the time!! (from 22:26 tp 23:28) the song's playing time is right so I guess you're using a different version of the movie which is about a minute shorter.

apart from the Excellent video quality, this is useless."
