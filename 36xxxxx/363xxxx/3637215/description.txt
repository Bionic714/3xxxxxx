
info:

it is said that movie director Stanley Kubrick contacted Pink Floyd in order to have them make a soundtrack for the movie "2001: A space odyssey". Pink Floyd declined Kubrick's request, and they later regretted it. "Echoes" is part of the album "Meddle", released in 1971, after "2001". It might as well be Pink Floyd's own tribute to this great movie.


sound and video are synchronized by the first high-pitched sound in the audio track, and the title "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite" in the video.

I have made a high-bitrate, filtered rip of that portion of the movie, and replaced the audio stream with a 320 Kb/s stereo rip of "Echoes". old computers may stutter during playback.


Enjoy ;-)



credo:

"I know you're out there. I can feel you know. I know that you're afraid, you're afraid of us, you're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't came here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world, where anything is possible. Where we go from there, this is a choice I leave to you."
