THE 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT
ONE YEAR LATER
A CITIZENS' RESPONSE:
DID THE COMMISSION GET IT RIGHT?
9/11 FAMILIES, GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND SCHOLARS RESPOND


"We are getting to the heart of some very important issues... I'd like to thank this panel for their wonderful, riveting, honest, thoughtful presentations."
          -Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney


"I'm very encouraged by this panel. I'm hoping that this will somehow translate into the schools, we need more young people here and listening to this because they are the ones that are gonna pass this on."
          -Moderator Rabia Rayford


"We have brought information to Capitol Hill. No longer can the Congress say we don't know. Today's hearing consisted of the best and brightest minds who are experts in their fields. Whistleblowers, academics, scholars, family members, all here today to let Congress and the American people know the truth. I am thankful for all of this array of cameras that are here today, because you will get the
word out to the American people and let them know the truth. Today, the Cannon Caucus Room was a no spin zone, but it is clear that we must now add another question, and that is who are we and what are we becoming? I want to thank the millions of truth seekers, the panelists, the questioners, my staff, alternative medias, CSPAN, and most importantly, the voters of the 4th Congressional District of Georgia, who made this day possible. We can make a peaceful tomorrow, and I think it began today. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you."
          -Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney
