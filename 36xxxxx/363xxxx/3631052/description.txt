This is the DTS version of Jay-Jay Johanson's new album "The Long Term Physical Effects Are Not Yet Known" released on February 22, 2007.

So many DTS-discs seem quite pointless with more or less just a double-up of the main channels. Not so with Johanson's album. Many of the tracks have become more interesting, musically to some extent, but above all sonically. The dynamics has a much wider range. With the surround format, many of the songs have lost a lot of the intimacy of the original disc but in those instances there is more sonic playfulness. And in a song like ?It's All for You? the surround format has increased the intimacy with Johanson's voice emitting from the centre speaker and the other speakers defining the vocal stage performance; here he seems even more naked and vulnerable than in the standard two-channel mix. There is also a greater live feel to the track ?False Alarm?, and at least one bonus track is considerably better; the otherwise completely unnecessary reverse mix of "She Doesn't Live Here Anymore". In its DTS version it is at least listenable, with added harmonic content. Some songs suffer from the format remix, but you'll decide for yourself. Fortunately, the fat of the land brings us both. Enjoy!

IMPORTANT NOTICE: This is a DTS Compact Disc. You will need a dvd player and a DTS decoder to play it. The DTS decoder is usually built-in with your player or your surround receiver. If your equipment cannot handle DTS sound, don't download. All you'll hear is silence or awful digital noise. To benefit the most from the programme, use a 5.0 speaker configuration, with preferably equal size to all speakers, sonically matched.
