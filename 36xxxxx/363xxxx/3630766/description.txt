This copy of Quake contains ID's original Quake: The first real internet mutliplayer game. Since the release of the source code there have been many improvements to the game engine to improve the quality of graphics, while keeping the game play the same. Quake revolutionized first person shooters and still remains somewhat active 10 years later. Qrack is the latest engine to take advantage of new textures and improved graphics.

I have included in this package Qrack & ProQuake and a version that will run on Mac OS X. To run simply double click Qrack.bat. You can edit Qrack.bat (it is a text file) to change the video options. If you want to run at a higher resolution or refresh rate.

If you have a OLD video card that might not be able to handle the advanced graphics you can load ProQuake (glpro.exe) which is the old looking Quake. Or if you are on Mac there is a app in there for you.

For some reason newer versions of Quake do not use a grappling hook...which makes CTF a totally different and quite boring game. This package includes all the original CTF maps and everyhting you will need to play CTF. Quake is a fast game and is unrivaled in the different dimensions one can play the game. Games of 1 on 1, 2 on 2, 4 on 4, or 8 on 8 are all equally fun. 


There are still many Quake servers still up. Type connect in the console to connect or go to multiplayer in the client...there is a server list. Press ESC to get to main menu.
