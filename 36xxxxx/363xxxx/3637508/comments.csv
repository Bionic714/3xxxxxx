,TeamDk,2007-03-14T15:31Z,So all of us is on 18.5% When will you start Seeding or why not remake it?
,insta-gib,2007-03-21T05:21Z,"Sorry, being able to seed has become a little troublesome. If you can't get past 18.5% or anywhere else, I have no idea. Something's fouled up pretty bad. I thought uploading this would be no problem. :/"

Not what I call 'dead'"
,Dexcimus,2008-12-12T19:40Z,Not dead...the fastest torrent I have ever had @ 300 kps+ .   Been wanting another copy of this for a loooong time.   My store-bought disk developed a crack on the edge and would no longer read in my drive.  I installed this and added my store-bought copy of Alien Crossfire and am in alien heaven once again.. This game rawks like no other turn based strategy game ever.  No surprise it was PC Gamer's highest rated game until HL2 came along and tied its score.  Will seed always cause it can't be bought anymore.
