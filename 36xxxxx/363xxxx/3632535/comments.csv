,VDR88,2007-04-25T02:37Z,"Thanks very much for the game! I have it still, but the CD's all scratched up!

I got it to run after modifying the Dosbox config, I had to run it in ""software"" mode.  But I have a problem.  I can play the game for about 30 sec's (I'm on the bridge) and then suddenly an error comes up and a bunch of text in dos comes scrolling down.  Anyone know what this is and how to get by it?

I'm running Windows 2000pro sp4 btw.

Again, thanks for the help and uber thanks for the game!"

,Gethenix,2011-10-20T07:06Z,"Help! Granted, I can't/don't read DOS language, but I'm confused.

I followed the directions. I made the folder on my c drive per step 1 below.

I downloaded the torrent file to the same folder per step 2.

I installed a newer version of DosBox via the link provided further down below. There was already a dosbox.conf file in the program files folder, so I didn't see any scenario to overwrite it?

I double clicked on the torrent file but DOSBox won't run it. 

What gives?"
