Du lägger in den i mappen ""mina dokument"" och sen är det bara att starta spelet. Ta en backup på dina egna saves först så att inget tråkigt händer. "

,JVDx,2008-04-17T14:48Z,"this was in the text file inside:

1: Copy and paste the ""Test Drive Unlimited"" folder to My documents.
2: It's smart to take backup of your old one.

after that, launch test drive, click on Profile and choose the new profile which is the 100% complete one.
read before you post people."

,14658,2008-06-22T12:56Z,"Hello guys. 

To have the save file to work,

First run the game, go and create a new profile through the new game. It doesn't matter who you select or whatever, just click. Now when you arrive, make sure you follow the instructions too, like picking your home through the real estate, renting a car and racing in your first race. Follow everything, when you finish your first race (doesn't matter if you failed or what, and also buy whatever car), go back home and save (even though it says its saving after the race I think, just double check at your home by saving again). Exit the game and copy this save file (the whole folder) into the Test Drive Unlimited folder you find in your documents. 

Reload Test Drive Unlimited (make sure you have exit the game after you saved, leaving it running might not work). Then load up the profile at the main screen of this save file. It should re-appear back to the main screen with this save file's profile name (for example > testdriveone) at the top. If you have that awesome! Now you can enjoy!"
