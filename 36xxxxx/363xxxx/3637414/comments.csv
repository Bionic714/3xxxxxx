,LordPomp,2007-03-14T23:15Z,Why is this file size so small? Anybody tried this? Seems fishy.
,LordPomp,2007-03-14T23:41Z,"On further review, the file size of the free trial program on the softwares website is around the same size, and the same person submitted all of the beta versions of this software on P Bay, so this is probably fine. "

Oh and it's smaller than the other because the documentation and educational videos aren't included in this one."
,timitim,2007-04-24T22:51Z,It's stoped working after the first time. It just freez when I start it. Any idea?
,stinktank,2007-09-04T19:05Z,"This is an awesome app!  Thank  you so much for your continued effort to provide it for everyone iceheart.  Have you heard, Autodesk is acquiring Skymatter.  I guess they won't stop until they have every app relative.  But imagine the possiblities of integration between Mudbox and Maya or 3DS!"
