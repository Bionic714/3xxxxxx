WORKING TORRENT 100% OK FROM WHAT I CAN TELL.  USE THIS ONE!!!

Under Your Bed Season 1 in full from The Fury of CrasH & The Fury.

Created by Peyton "The Fury" Keith and developed as a web series by CrasH, Under Your Bed follows the adventures of four toys that have grown up, gotten pathetic, and very cynical and disillusioned with life.  Aside from the occasional social commentary, the cast of Major Wynn the Army Major, Sparky the looks-remarkably-like-but-is-in-no-way-related-to-Disney's-Stitch-from-Lilo & Stitch, Preacher the preaching ninja, and Gragh the eloquent, well-spoken T-Rex often find themselves engaged in some sort of mission like spying on the Big Man or trying to order a pizza.

The show ended with the Season 2 finale which was completed just weeks before Loading  Screen Productions burned to the ground, taking the cast and raw footage of Under Your Bed with it.  In tribute, CrasH has decided to release Under Your Bed for free to all torrent users.  

If you enjoy the show, share it with someone else and keep seeding.  You will NOT face any copyright infringement issues of any kind.  IF YOU DO, contact us at help_i_am_being_sued@crashandthefury.com and we will straighten it out.

Season 1 is kind of slow as we were developing the animation process as well as the nature of the show.  Season 2 picks up the pacing a bit and is generally regarded as better all around by all who have seen it, but Season 1 helps put it in context in those rare instances where continuity matters.

Enjoy!
