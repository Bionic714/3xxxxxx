,peter980,2007-03-10T23:30Z,"It's true, not supporting offline patching is worse then Starforce protected games, if you ask me."
,Dancingwind,2007-03-11T22:15Z,":D well We can allways ask ppl with legit updated versions to rar it and share it.
Its a bit messy to make an copied instalation work on another computer but its doable - all it need is a little bit of diging in Windows registry and exporting the nessecary registry entires."
,ilovpiratebay,2007-04-12T11:48Z,"Guys, I have downloaded this torrent, but I see only 4 files. 2 .bin and 2 .cue files. What do I have to do for these? There is no .exe or something. Is that only the expansion without the original game?"
,peter980,2007-04-16T16:29Z,"You don't get offline patch, even with original copy."
,emperorbob,2007-04-23T17:22Z,"@ ilovpiratebay:

The files are disc images - either burn them with Nero to CDs or use DaemonTools to mount them without burning to CD"
,MarekKu,2007-05-22T03:08Z,"I get ""unable to mount image file"" with disc 2. I'm using deamon tools anyone with same problem?"
,cixxar,2007-05-25T21:27Z,Marakku: you sure you have updatet your deamon? they make new version once in a while
,gubbins,2007-09-28T21:36Z,"TBH my view on this is: if you like a game, buy it. Support the people who make the games so they make more. _Especially_ if they are a small indie publisher like Stardock. Unless you want gaming to be basically Halo 3 and spin offs done by EA Sports. Because if people don't start putting dollars in the pockets of indie outfits, thats where we're heading. Mono publishing. Like literature - if its a work of genius, nobody will publish because it doesn't target the XBox generation. 

Try before you buy, but please, do fuckin' buy!"
,gubbins,2007-09-28T23:50Z,"Oh and this is the OVERDUE release? Cos last I checked on TPB they had missing files, corrupt rar's and about 6 different 'fixer' torrents to follow it up.

I hope this isn't just a repost?

Also, whats the point of dl'ing this when you can't update it (cracked/hacked exe's of 1.5 on 1.6d data is not my idea of an update) properly?"
[V],matimike,2007-11-27T17:33Z,"great game works fine i had a little trouble with the dark avatar part but got it working, thank you very much, keep up the good work. oh and seeded :)"
,Excypher,2008-02-15T21:09Z,"This game works great!! Fast Seed only took a day. Ok wasnt so fast but still.

Anyway for all you new guys go download the daemon tool lite already, shesh its free. Once downloaded theres a thing called mount Image, and thats how you install it.

Oh this game sucks btw, if you want a turnbase space shooter, get Space Rangers 2, thats fully customizable/Fun/Turnbase AND Fulltime space shooter. Thats the shit you want."
,fallout11,2008-03-21T02:54Z,"No problems at all with this download, game runs great.  Sadly, it's not that hot of a game, best part is ship design/customization (imho).

Space Rangers 2 rocked (bought it, loved it), but the frickin' Starguard protection fried my (first) CD/DVD rom. A little research shows I wasn't alone in this department. Nice piece of s*** there, great way to screw over your legitimate, paying customers. Drove me to piracy is what it did, mate."
,qotsa13,2008-06-22T20:04Z,"hey, wheres the cd key??"
,stonemojo,2008-07-30T15:31Z,"Great up, Acantoni;
Install was flawless (had to hunt the serial but no biggie there). Haven't played the game yet so no comment on that.

Great torrent."
,exxxoh,2008-09-24T20:00Z,"@ gubbins:

The point of downloading a cracked game when you can't patch it is because your getting it for fucking free. Why would you download something from someone and bitch about their work when your getting it FOR FREE? Do it yourself, asshat."
,orion1394,2011-09-23T21:10Z,Hey there i just managed to figure out how to mount this sucker cause i had no CDs left lol. but i'm getting an error that the gclauncher.exe failed to run??? anyone else get this? running vista home edition
,panzermort,2011-11-25T17:16Z,"@gubbins  you got told there m8, its a free game your moaning about updates, seems like a muppet or has someone got a hand up your arse, save us from puppets
