Live for speed Sweden is moving to another server!
We now have two servers running two hamachi-servers. For those that want to play in multiplayer join either one of them:

""LFS-Sweden""
password= welcome

""LFS-Sweden II""
password= welcome

You might try to get online on fridays since that is the day when most of us are up and racing.

Good luck and welcome to the hubs!"
