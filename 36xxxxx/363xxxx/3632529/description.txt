For those on Linux, runs on Fedora >4, Debian 3.x+ and U/Kubuntu 5x,6.x for sure because I tested it. The files are already patched, so you can \"make install\" and be finished. Or for those who like to patch there own (including me), the files necessary to remake and patch are also here. But don\'t look for source. 

Version 3.41

Hope you enjoy
