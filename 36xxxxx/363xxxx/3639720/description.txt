Here it is folks. I hope the people at Freakyflicks will pick this up.

This is the japanese DVDrip of this twisted coming-of-age tale featuring Viggo Mortensen (http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=KKIS-15). It is WIDESCREEN (no more crappy full screen VHS version) and looks great (in an ugly sort of way). I\'ll be seeding this for a couple of days but once I get one or two seeders you\'re on your own...
