It doesn't works with me. I always get the same Challenge code G10836640755310202025542 and it tells me the following  ""Bad Challenge Code, type it without '-' nor space !!"" And I tried a lot of  license keys


What am I doing wrong"

,GoWithTheFlowYo,2009-04-05T10:46Z,"I found out what was wrong with the keygen:

- first of all disconnect the internet when activating
- generate a serial and use it
- the program returns a Challange code, in my case starting with a ""G"" 
- replace the ""G"" in my case with a ""6"" 
- the keygen returns a working Reponse code!

- good luck and cheers - "
