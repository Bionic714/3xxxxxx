,Silence83,2007-03-13T20:45Z,Why can`t u seed..The fucking torrent is dead before anyone has the chance to finish downloading it...
,theevildonkey,2007-03-14T06:41Z,Sorry. I'm leeching off the neighbors and they're having connection problems. It happens sometimes. It's usually back up after 12 hours or so. I'll start seeding again as soon as it's back up.
,Silence83,2007-03-14T20:24Z,Okey tanx...
,bhadresh,2007-03-17T14:52Z,please seed we are stuck at 76.3%
,theevildonkey,2007-03-20T03:40Z,"Sorry about that. The neighbor's connection was down for a long time. I'm not sure why they keep getting disconnected.
... Anyways, it's back up now and I'm seeding again."
,theevildonkey,2007-03-20T04:22Z,I watched this movie on my girlfriend's computer the other day and it worked fine in Winamp. She has a name brand computer that likely has different/extra codecs installed. I think she uses Divx instead of XviD. Maybe that's why.

,theevildonkey,2008-09-13T12:22Z,I dunno. Just finding the movie itself was hard.
,nwasquad,2008-11-08T13:51Z,"can someone please seed/reseed? I was looking for this movie for so long (it is VERY hard to find) so I could appreciate it if someone could seed it and once I finish getting it, I'll help seed for tohers. Thanks"
