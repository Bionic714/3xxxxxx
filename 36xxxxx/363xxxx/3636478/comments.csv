,Thoraxone,2007-03-11T06:32Z,"It's real, I just watched it.
It's a terrible cam, but it is watchable (for the most part, many focus issues).

Bet yer ass I'll be down'ing a cleaner version when it's available.....kick ass movie."
,rpm016,2007-03-11T06:38Z,Based on the Sample provided the Audio is more acceptable than the video quality. If you MUST see now it will do.

,OrimtheShadow,2007-03-11T20:27Z,This movie is kick arse I suggest everyone go see it at theaters at least once.
,morfeas18,2007-03-12T16:20Z,great movie but really bad quality. wait for something better 
,flickerx,2007-03-12T22:38Z,"I didnt think the film was great.

Too much long, overblown, pseudo-epicness about it. Nowhere in the same league as Sin City. No idea why this is getting so much hype."
,Jdubsta,2007-03-13T01:48Z,"To who gives an &%^&$%,

This movie is okay....at best 7/10, why? Hype my friends hype. Visually the movie is stunning, the battle sequences alone are worth the price of admission. The sets and production design, flawless. That being said, the battle are few and far between. Why do I gripe? Because the characterization and plot movement is not very well done. This is not ""Gladiator"", that movie had excellent down moments. This however felt more like overacted Shakespeare gone wild. By the end I was just wanting it to end. Please tell me someone noticed this as well so I don't feel to much like a hater."
,redgladiator69,2007-03-13T11:23Z,"I agree with 'KillingZoe' this looks like a decent movie , but this cam version is no doubt how Mr Mcgoo sees the world, pisspoor quality, not knocking 'masseur' but would definatly wait for a better torrent."
