 Overview                                                                           

Once upon a time, a little doggy poo lived on the side of a road.
He felt all alone in the world. He believed that nobody needed him
for anything, and that he had no purpose in life. If only Doggy Poo
had a reason for being, then he wouldn't give up on his dream to be
useful to the world.

One day, Doggy Poo meets a lovely dandelion sprout. Will she explain
his purpose in life? Will she help make his dream come true?
