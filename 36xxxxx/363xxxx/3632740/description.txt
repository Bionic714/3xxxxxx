From the Boogie Down Bronx and beyond, the history of the B-Boy. 



Review:

This documentary had such great content!!!! I loved the archive footage and the interviews with some of the original B-Boys!!!! They didn't go into great detail about the other elements of Hip Hop but the B-Boying aspect of it was spot-on! But then again, that's what the film is about in the first place. If I had anything to complain about it would be just that I would have liked to have more battles to view on the special features. But that's a small gripe and showing the original New York City Breakers bust some moves before a small crowd at a B-Boy convention in L.A. almost makes up for it. I'm a B-Boy myself and I appreciate the fact that there are still a whole lot of us out there doin' our thang!!!! If you're a Hip Hop enthusiast or if you're the least bit intrigued by the Hip Hop culture then you must check this out! It'll teach you a little bit about how Hip Hop was originally supposed to be conveyed. Not as some booty-getting', thug buggin', gang-bangin', BULLSHIT! THIS EXPLAINS THE REAL HIP HOP!!!! B-BOY FOREVER!!!!
