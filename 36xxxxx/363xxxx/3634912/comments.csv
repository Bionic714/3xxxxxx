When installed, right click the icon (located at the bottom right corner) and ""mount"" the image file of the game."
,Cutterdk,2007-03-10T17:27Z,"""A fairly new fairly old release group Quartex published a new action game Infernal. This is a somehow specific title, with really interesting game concept and untraditional graphic interface. The rest of game doesn?t work so good though, especially AI is very bad as well as the gameplay as a whole. May serve some fun for a weekend of two though.""

Not the best review."

,brainz,2007-04-14T02:14Z,"Hmmm... that problem sounds irritating. Perhaps there'll be an other crack soon. But I personally don't like cracks to much. Tend to use mini-images instead.

Mount it like an image (with Daemon Tools) and use some program to hide it from the copy-protections blacklist.

This game though seems to use some not to normal copy-protection (to me at least)... Tages v5 and SoftShield.

Check this ... this might be a working solution to your problem. Replace the files (that might be corrupt because of the copy-protection) with the ones in File Archive #2 of the Infernal v1.0 [MULTI5] No-DVD/Fixed EXE."
,Preed2,2007-04-16T16:10Z,Anyone know how to teleport? im stuck on the first mission when u need to teleport past the security systems. I press Q. Select a location then get pulled back to my original location. Anyone got any idea what i might be doing wrong?
