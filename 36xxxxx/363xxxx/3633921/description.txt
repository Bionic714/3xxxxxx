      One of the Most Complete Reverb Suites to Hit the Market
      
      Classik Studio Reverb offers in a single product, a suite of 4
      high-quality reverb plug-ins: 
      
      - PLATE
      - ROOM
      - HALL
      - INVERSE
      
      All are designed to give the same sound of an acclaimed
      high-quality outboard reverb unit. With a myriad of options
      and parameters to choose from, Classik Studio Reverb is truly
      a complete, great sounding package that can adapt to any mix
      situation with ease.
      
      A Musicality that Rivals High-End Outboard Gear for a Sound 
      that Sits Perfectly in Any Mix
      CSR offers high-quality, musical reverb processing with the
      flexibility previously available only in extremely expensive
      signature hardware reverb units. It carries the quality and
      character that top engineers have utilized for years. CSR is
      designed to get the maximum musicality, recreate the character
      that has made your favorite hit records, and that classic
      sound that sits perfectly in any mix.
      
      Easy to Use with Advanced Editing Features, CSR is Suitable 
      for Any User from Beginner to Pro
      CSR has been designed for ease of use with advanced editing
      features. With the look and feel of a typical effects rack on
      the interface, all the necessary controls are laid out for an
      immediate great sound. All knobs and macro controls can be
      automated through your hostÆs sequencer. From the beginner to
      professional engineer, you wonÆt have a problem getting your
      desired result from CSR. 
      
      Ease of Use for the Beginning Musician
      
      CSR offers two modes: Easy and Advanced, coupled with more
      than 100 parameters. Easy Mode puts the most commonly changed
      controls on the front panel of the plug-in, making CSR an easy
      to use and quick solution when a high-quality reverb is
      needed. You shape the sound using only six parameters: Mix,
      Diffusion, Reverb Time, Low Frequency Gain, High Frequency
      Cutoff, and High Frequency Dampening; giving you full control
      over the main character of the reverb.
      
      Depth and Complexity for the Professional Engineer
      
      In Advanced Mode, you will find an array of highly developed
      modeling and shaping controls that are hard to find in any
      reverb. All parameters, the Modulation Matrix, and Macro
      Controls, can be adjusted and changed to create the reverb
      effect that you need, tailored to the very finest detail. The
      Modulation Matrix is an 8x8 structure; meaning that 8
      modulation sources can manipulate 8 destinations. For example,
      to apply an envelope to your reverb time, you can fine-tune
      the tail for a specific reverb sound. Or, use an LFO to
      modulate the reverb image, creating movement in the acoustic
      space.
      
      A New Level of Texture and Innovative Programming Potential
      
      Macro controls can be created allowing complex sweeping
      changes in Classik Studio ReverbÆs effects, virtually
      transferring environments at your command. You can associate
      up to 8 different CSR controls to a simple Macro slider,
      therefore making morphing between different reverb settings
      easier than ever. In both Easy and Advanced Modes, it is
      always simple to find that perfect sound. A convenient A/B
      comparison allows you to quickly apply modifications and
      compare between two reverb settings in a snap.
      
      A Flexibility that Cannot be Found in TodayÆs Popular Impulse
      
      Reverbs, with Less Strain on Your CPU
      While impulse reverbs have gained a lot of popularity because
      of their particular emulation of environment reverberation,
      they are inherently CPU-intensive. They typically lack the
      particular musical sound and editing possibilities that famous
      studio digital reverbs have always offered. CSR is not only
      less demanding in your processor, but much more flexible than
      impulse-based technologies. Now you have the ability to
      manipulate and shape reverbs from a number of angles, giving
      you performance that mirrors high-end studio quality.
      
      Compatibility and Flexibility for Any Studio
      
      CSR offers a reverb solution for virtually any computer-based
      musician. VST, RTAS, and Audio Unit formats are included for
      Mac and PC, allowing CSR to work as a plug-in with popular
      virtual studio environments such as: Cubase, Logic, Pro Tools,
      Digital Performer, Sonar, Ableton Live, and more.
