Also, after downloading the patch for online play from their website i get an error please insert wwp disc n try again' even though I am loading from disc."
,thegrossboy,2007-03-26T21:25Z,"I have the original CD, and i have had some similar problems playing under winXP pro with both the cd and the iso, so i don't think its the iso. I don't have a lot of experience yet so i could be wrong though...

I can't help you with the online play patch, i've never used it, but let me know if you figure it out."
