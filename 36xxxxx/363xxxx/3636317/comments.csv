,johnatand,2008-03-21T09:44Z,"Some of the files, for instance /FreeStylesession&OFF/brentford all stars - Greedy G.mp3 seems to be some sort of executable files. My virus scanner doesn't find anything inappropriate, though I'm hesitant to have unknown executables lying around in my music collection. Could someone please verify this?"

I'm not sure what the comments about being stuck and no seeds is about.

Well I'm all about keeping this type of thing alive so you can add another perm-seeder to the list.
