one question, are not swedish subs included or did you just by accident leave it out in the info?"
,Big swede2,2007-03-11T16:37Z,"Great movie, thanks!"

Both torrents video_ts.ifo files are exactly identical at least concerning the audio and subs languages. 26 subs languages ARE included inclusive swedish... (Well I did not test it so far but if the DVD has been left untouched it should be like the ifo file says.)

Splitting swarms by uploading stuff which is already available is not very helpful...  :-/  and of course it's good to know what you are REALLY uploading...   ;)

Thanks anyway for the good upload!!!  :))"

Unfortunately I have to come back on my former comment having tested the movie in the meantime... It's not an untouched version so:

SubPicture 20-26 have been left out so that means that there's indeed NO SWEDISH NOR TURKISH SUBS INCLUDED in this torrent!!

Besides starting from the language menu most of the subs are not directly available, you'll need to use the software / player menu or command instead.

Rest is fine.  :))"
,baybeh,2012-08-12T11:52Z,does this have the extras as well as the commentary?
