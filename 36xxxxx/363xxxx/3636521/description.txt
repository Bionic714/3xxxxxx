DESCRIPTION:

Chet Baker, the paragon of cool jazz, is one of the enduring greats, known for both his trumpet playing and his equally fragile-sounding singing. Early on, his good looks made him the James Dean of jazz. But his musical gifts never deserted him, as Career 1952?1988 amply demonstrates. This 2-CD set provides a complete overview of his entire career.
