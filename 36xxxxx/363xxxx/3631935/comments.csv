,holevinsky,2007-03-08T14:12Z,"Im using Win XP and crack is only tested for Win XP, maybe thats the reason, I dont know. For me it works fine."
,Bambi.,2007-05-06T11:36Z,"I have download this torrent,But when I start the game it says that I have 60 min left of the game,I have the crack fil but i dont know what I must do.Can someone tell me how I do it.(I'm not good at english, but hope someone understand what I mean.)"
,madeonflop,2007-05-10T00:56Z,"To answer the last post, normally you copy the crack into the folder were the file installed, In this case under programs and the virtual villager folder. It asks if you want to overwrite the exiting file which you say yes to. In the case however the crack is crap and does not work."
,BananaHeiress,2007-08-05T12:02Z,"it's working 100% fine for me. i love this game so much. thanks a lot! ^^,"
,blixxex,2008-02-06T08:45Z,"the crack is valid.

Open folder
first install the game.
open folder ""crack"" copy the icon of ""virtual villagers""
go to program files (i think it's in my documents)

find the folder of virtual villagers

paste. if it says replace the current one say yes. 

then you have the crack down."

,naomi_22,2008-11-02T11:58Z,"Program works perfectly ! Thankyou ! Just install file and then go into folder with crack, copy it ( if you jus click it you will get an error message) and paste it in the folder with all the program files ( wherever you chose to install it before, usually in program files) and paste it. You will then have a message come up asking if you want to replace the file. Click yes, and then youre done !"
