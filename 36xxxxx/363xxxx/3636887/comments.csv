I tried renaming it as ISO, and tried unzipping it with Winrar, but it says I need another file to continue unzipping the IMG file inside the ISO zip.  Anyone else managed to get this one working?"
,embmmusic,2007-03-16T19:01Z,"I'd stay away from this one guys.  I've tried everything I can to get it to work, with no results.  If the poster can't be bothered to explain what to do with it, what's the point?  Hopefully someone else can upload this soon."
