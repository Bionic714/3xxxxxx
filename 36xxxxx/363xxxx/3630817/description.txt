-Malware Cleaning Disc ver. 8-    
by:  gobbin1_at_cyber-rights.net


Release Date: March 3, 2007     
Version: 8
System:  NT/2K/XP



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MCD is an anti-malware toolkit intended for experienced 
computer users.  The purpose of this compilation is to 
provide an array of powerful malware analysis, detection,  
removal, and prevention software in one download.  Also 
included, are some relevant system utilities.  This can 
make for a good emergency disc, a disc for cleaning 
friends\' computers and preventing subsequent infection, or a 
good starting point for those interested in computer security.

The majority of files included are freeware standalones.  If 
you like a program in this release, give some well deserved 
thanks to its developers by donating to them.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New in version 8:  25+ new tools, 10+ updates.  I\'ve included 
a new guide that gives an outline of a quick & fairly thorough 
malware scan, and updated the system optimization guide.  
The only changes to the directory structure are the addition 
of a \'process utilities\' folder inside the \'system tools\' folder 
and a \'proxies\' folder in the \'internet tools\' folder.
**See the last part of this read me for a list of new files**

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please note: each time this disc is released, someone invariably
becomes alarmed when their anti-virus program alerts them of an
infected file.  AV\'s use heuristics analysis, which 
is basically a generic method for catching new malware.  The 
problem is that an AV cannot tell what purposes a certain 
application or string of code is being used for.  For example, look 
at what the author of an included tool, SmitFraudFix, says on his 
site:

[ from http://siri.geekstogo.com/SmitfraudFix.php ]
\"process.exe is detected by some antivirus programs (AntiVir, 
Dr.Web, Kaspersky) as a \"RiskTool\". It is not a virus, but a 
program used to stop system processes. Antivirus programs 
cannot distinguish between \"good\" and \"malicious\" use of 
such programs, therefore they may alert the user.\" 
http://www.beyondlogic.org/consulting/processutil/processutil.htm 


***************************************************************************
Before making any alarmist posts, google the filename and see 
if you can find information on the file in question, see the author\'s 
page (often linked), e-mail it to your AV company, etc.  There is 
no malware in this release!  

A big reason for the continued release of this kit is precisely 
because many people view their AV program as a magical, 
complete security solution.  It\'s not!
