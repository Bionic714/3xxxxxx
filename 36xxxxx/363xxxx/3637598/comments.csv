Can I make a huge request and ask yourself whether you have the conscience to download Peter Hammill without paying for it? Here is the ONE artist who have maintained is impeccable artistic integrity, self-publishing in excess of 35 outstanding albums and the way he makes a living is for dedicated THINKING fans to buy his music. There's not all that many of us (die-hard PH fans), but we all think he deserves a much geater audience (and a much greater financial reward) for his tireless and impeccable contribution to the art of music, and I would urge all of you who consider downloading this torrent to visit PH on sofasound.com and BUY this latest album - which is GREAT by the way. Have a look at his back catalog as well while you're at it and pich up some re-mastered older gems as well. I am not connected with PH in any other way than that I have enjoyed his music tremendously over the last 30 years, and his music has stood the test of time (with me at least - I play PH on my IPOD more than all other artists COMBINED). Thanks guys (and girls)- rant over.

Happy (and guilt-free) listening

My philosophy is that if you download something and like it (i.e. play it regularly) then you should buy the original, which is what I do personally. "
,ozav8r,2007-03-13T21:40Z,"Synfinity - well said, and I agree. I admit to sometimes using downloads to give a new (to me) artist an audition - if I like what I hear I buy it, and if not - it gets deleted from my computer. I realise that this philosophy is not entirely water-proof, but somhow it works for me :-) BTW - I just ordered the latest double live VdGG, but in the meantime - if anybody cares to upload it here, I will be very happy to download it to fill in the waiting time (land/sea freight to Oz takes forever...)

..believe me or not but I havent bought a single album the last 5years without listening to it first..
and Im one of those who still buy records - crappy mp3:s are not good enough if I like something. It is however good enough to help me decide whether to buy smthn or not.
I somehow doubt that the typical ph/vdgg fan has a record collection of mp3-cds...?"
,daveydudely,2010-06-15T00:48Z,"You know how many fucking Peter Hammill and VDGG albums and CDs I bought in my day?  And usually at 'import' prices?

I think I've owned four copies of Nadir's Big Chance, man."
