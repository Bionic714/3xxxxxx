This was the final patch issued by Microprose for Falcon 4.0, and corrects many bugs in the original code.

This patch should ONLY be applied if intending to fly the original Falcon 4.0. It is NOT required to install the Free Falcon or Open Falcon mods on top of the base Falcon 4.0, nor is it in any way/shape/form compatible with Falcon 4.0: Allied Force.
