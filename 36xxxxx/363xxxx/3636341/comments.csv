,Getus,2007-03-13T06:49Z,must u use a joypad? or can this be done on the keyboard?
,Getus,2007-03-13T06:50Z,"woah, also next time zip it maybe ... files EVERYWHERE: P"
,acantoni,2007-03-13T07:41Z,"Indeed i should have zipped.
It's recommended once you download it to copy the folder you want to play elsewhere and play from there.


No joypad is required though it might make the game easier.

For geowars and gridwars you can use an hybrid configuration using keys to move and mouse to aim

For veck so far i found keys only (directional firing is a must) 

Enjoy!"
