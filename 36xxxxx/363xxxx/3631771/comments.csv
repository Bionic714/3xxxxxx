,Judge6ex,2007-03-05T20:15Z,"For subtitles check the play URL.
Some are DVD5 as source the rest are compressed slightly. Nothing is removed. But hey, those tits takes some time to compress so......
I will start DVD 2 within minutes so soon there will be moooooore"
,StreetTrash,2007-03-05T21:51Z,"Downloaded 21 times and only 5 seeders!!
shame on you who not will seed after complete download."
,Judge6ex,2007-03-06T04:40Z,"Ok when trying to get the next share in all I get is --The torrent doesn't seem to have any of our trackers, please remake the torrent and add the tracker http://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce-- Any one know what I did wrong????   And Yes I was extremely drunk when doing this..... But Ill sober up tomorrow and then......."
,Judge6ex,2007-03-06T23:30Z,DVD 2 is running. 
,Judge6ex,2007-03-11T10:35Z,"1,2 and 3 is running 4 is uploaded hopefully and is hopefully working."
,Judge6ex,2007-03-30T19:10Z,This torrent seems to survive without me. Im deleting the files from my pc and getting ready for the next box.
,buzznjackal,2007-12-22T22:03Z,"Thanks Judge6ex, I was just looking all over for these Russ Meyer movies and you've put them all in one place. Thank you much!"
,Jazbrowndotcom,2008-04-12T07:38Z,"Thank you SO much for uploading this box!!!

It is really VERY appreciated.

It just dawned on me today to look for RM in torrent form. I'm starting on disc one right now.

I just pray the seeding lasts til I'm done

I have over 500 dvd's many of them in the ""bizzare"" vein, so if you're looking for anything just let me know!"
,thesoftparade,2008-06-12T18:50Z,Really great upload. Thank you very much.
