,nijntjepluis,2007-03-05T16:13Z,fat-te up m8
,seref87,2007-03-06T12:26Z,please seed the movie
,DjDesidera,2007-03-06T14:14Z,"I can see if the rest of the movies are AHQ .
If they are not in high quality I will not post them, but I thought only 1 movie was of low quality and I replaced that a while ago...
I'll dive into my backups now..

The thankyou is more then appreciated ;-)
I will keep U informed, plz check this post once in a while."
,DjDesidera,2007-03-06T14:58Z,"It seems that my backup disc containing special 1-4 and live action movie dragonball is unreadable (?)
I will search my ass off and try to post them ASAP"
,DjDesidera,2007-03-06T15:24Z,"found them, now d/l... :D 
coming soon:
Dragonball movie 1-4 (early dragonball episodes)
Moviespecial 1-3 + GT's movie a hero's legacy

:D "
,DjDesidera,2007-03-07T09:35Z,"As said in my first comment, I turn of my PC whenever I leave my little mansion, sorry for that but thats just how it is. sorry.. 2day I will finish this release! 
The live action is indeed a terrible movie (seen it a few years ago) but never the less I've got the urge to post it, cause I thought the cartoons  were a spin off of that movie... 
I'll just see what I do and Keep U all informed :D"
,DjDesidera,2007-03-07T09:40Z,"Oh and the movie that I called special 3 is the plan to destroy the saiyans. 

don't know how they categorized that movie, but I liked it so much I just call it a Special :o)"
,DjDesidera,2007-03-08T17:44Z,"Think your right and yeah I wan't impressed by it either howerver I did like the jap. versions audio.. but the quality of that movie was really poor. 
Only thing I find a bit dissapointing is whenever they (Goku&Vegeta) go fused (in series and movies) the battle almost directly ends.. I would have liked to see a bit more battle from them in that state (like  u see from Gotenks in the series) :o)"
