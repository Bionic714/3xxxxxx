,wildcat.nl,2007-03-19T17:19Z,"maybe if you're lucky you can find a serial that is not used, here, take a look: http://www.keygen.in/?serial=anno+1701"
,shesa,2007-03-28T12:01Z,I can't get that game open :-( It asks me to insert the original DVD... :-(
,shesa,2007-03-28T16:21Z,"I installed and uninstalled the game like 3 or 4 times but every time I install the game, it never asks me a serial number, it just starts the installing process right away. How can I add the serial number?
Thanks"
,wildcat.nl,2007-03-28T19:36Z,"lol
he asks for the serial @ the first time you start the game ;)"
,wildcat.nl,2007-03-28T19:36Z,"I can't get that game open :-( It asks me to insert the original DVD... :-(

There is a crack on the iso. "
,shesa,2007-04-07T13:45Z,And iso means...??? Exactly what?
,wildcat.nl,2007-04-09T01:18Z,iso is a virtual CD/DVD
,XBooster,2007-09-21T00:19Z,Great game! Works perfectly.
,RecklessRose,2008-01-14T11:11Z,"What am i supposed to do with the file? It doesn't work properly with anything for me :-s
I'm sure it's my fault though ;-)"
,wildcat.nl,2008-01-14T20:43Z,"hehe ye it is probably, first you have to extract it. maybe you have winrar on your pc or otherwise look on google. 
After you extract it u get another file, anno 1701.iso or something like that. For this file you need daemon tools or poweriso. Here you can download Daemon Tools: 
http://www.disc-tools.com/request?p=e4c68ae7fc7c2521c3453835b96855d9/daemon4112-lite.exe
If you installed daemon tools and restarted your pc you got a new icon in your toolbar, a red lightning right click > virtual cd/dvd > Device 0 >  Mount image > then select anno 1701.iso
Your pc now thinks there is a DVD in your pc that's why it's called virtual dvd ;-) You can now just install the game... Good luck with it! You can always post more questions ;-)"
,Jercusta,2008-01-22T18:42Z,"Hey, Great job, thanks for making it simple, but me being computer illiterate i still managed to miss part, and i really want to play this game lol, ok, i downloaded the torrent, extracted the rar, mounted it onto daemon, got it all installed just fine
BUT now when i try to start it, its asking me to insert the original cd into the computer, what am i missing? thanks"
,wildcat.nl,2008-01-24T15:18Z,"You didn't replace the exe, it's on your virtual dvd or you can download it here: 
http://gbw.naxphost3.com/files/Anno1701v1.0NoDVDFixedexeGer.rar
If you downloaded it, extract it. Then you got something like anno1701.exe or 1701, not really sure but just drop that file in your anno dir (C:\program Files\anno 1701\ = standard) it asks to replace it and accept it, good luck!"
,Mann3rs,2008-08-28T17:52Z,Thanks for the serial mate.
