http://www.rpgcodex.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=23720
I did not include this becuse at the time i uploaded this torrent
i did not know that this patch existed.

This is a good site with many thing for Arcanum
http://www.terra-arcanum.com

To all of you with missing files errors and such
Only mount with Deamon Tools
It works and it works just fine as long as you dont mount
both cds at the same time. Ive tried and thats mostly
the problem.

So Demon tools and onle ONE virtual drive
