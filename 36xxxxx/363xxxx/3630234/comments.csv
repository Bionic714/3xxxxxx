,Tru_Linx,2007-03-02T16:12Z,Yeah and sry about info lost it 
,Getus,2007-03-03T23:10Z,"this is an awesome game ... RPG style ... I picked it up for about 20$ at a games store, new. It was definitly worth the buy. It's got a long, very involved story line, good skill based play, and turn based combat. Graphics could use some work, but theyre not terrible."

,Question2,2007-03-24T05:39Z,"I dont know about you guys, but during installation it says it cant find certain files, and if i ignore them and go ahead and install anyway, the game crashes to desktop when i try to run it....."
,ZypherWind,2007-03-29T02:43Z,"Hi, I?m sort of new at this torrent stuff, I?ve downloaded the files via µTorrent and have them all on my PC now. I?ve also burned them to disk for back up. My only problem is how do I run/install the game now? I would really appreciate a response. Thank you!"
,kraxz,2007-04-30T06:26Z,"Download and installation went just fine... As an old Fallout fan this seems to be a great game, and I cant really understand why I havent played it earlier.

No missing files for me, maybe you guys should try and reinstall/redownload/reformat/whatever.

@ZypherWind : I suggest you get Deamon Tools or some other program that will let you mount the files as if they were CDs."

Exactly like me.... :("

,Tru_Linx,2008-01-21T22:48Z,For all of you having trouble mount with only one program like i.e daemon tools and vormatown files are not necessery for the main game to run and there might be problems with the no need for a crack seems to be needed by some and not by others. Its good to see that this torrent has survived this long

I am new at torrents, so forgive the 'noob' questions. Downloaded this, mounted on Daemon tools....but it keeps asking me to insert the play disc to finish the actual install....how do i do that?

,taconazi,2008-11-07T01:27Z,"Let me just start by saying that this a classic game, if youve never tried it and are a fan of games like Fallout, then you really need to check this out.
Secondly, once youve downloaded this torrent, mounted the files using Daemon tools or whatever and have gotten all the way to the end of the installation and you get the missing file message (which happened to me), all you need to do is click ignore and continue installation. Now... once i did this it wouldnt get past the loading screen before the program would crash to the desktop, so what i did was remount the second disk (Play) and instead of autorunning it, i clicked ""Open folder to view the files on the disc"" When windows prompted me, found the two missing files ""Vormantown"" and ""Arcanum3"" and copied them to the directory that i had installed Arcanum to, in my case ""C:Sierra/Arcanum"" and voila, problem solved... I hope this helped at all."

What can i do to solve the problem? Please help me!"

,DivineMalus,2009-04-02T04:36Z,"Works awesome. Thanks for the torrent! Already seeded to 3.53 and still going.

Also, to all those who click the link and nothing happens: you must be running it in Vista. To fix the problem, go to the game folder (C:/Sierra/Arcanum), right click Arcanum.exe, go to the compatibility tab, and run it as Administrator.

That'll fix it."

,hcl14,2012-02-13T20:46Z,"2)For you Arcanum runs sometimes VERY slow. Even with -no3d -doublebuffer options (safe mode). That's a bug 

with engine. No matter how powerful is your PC - they just don't like each other. However, 3) helped me:

3)To run Arcanum in the window:
Use DirectX Windower (google it, tpb doesn't let me to post link)


To setup moo3 in a window run the exe file after extrating this zip into a directory

Click on the + button and point the program to the MOO3 exe

This should make the MOO3 icon appear in the list below
click on the icon and then click on the settings button (should be a yellow folder with some tools in front of it

click on the dll field and direct it to the MOO3 dll file binkw32.dll

After youâ€™ve done this click ok and then shut down the program (this seems to be required so it can properly intialize.

Open the program again and hit the â€œplayâ€ button

DO NOT enable foreground control, otherwise you won't be able to switch using Alt-Tab (if you do not use FC, 

just press alt-tab and click left mouse button - cursor becomes visible).

Enjoy!"
