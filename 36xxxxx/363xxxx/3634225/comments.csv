,Shnoky,2007-10-09T05:24Z,Ive downloaded this from another site. It works. I think this one is ripped so there is no Sample data included. the full version is about 700+ mb. but I think you dont need the sample data included so this one is still OK. This is a rare Software. it costs at about  $ 15000+ I think. its nice for the uploader to share this.
