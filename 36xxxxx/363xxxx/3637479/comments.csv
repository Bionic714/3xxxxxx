,tittei,2007-03-12T16:02Z,"A bad humming noise in the background, but otherwise a good episode!"
,gregersamsa,2007-03-12T16:51Z,"Does anyone know why the quality is so low? Compare this episode to some episodes ripped from Sky One (season 1) and you'll see the tremendous difference!

I guess I can't complain since I'm downloading it for free, but these days with big flat screen TV:s so common among us, I'd think that people would put some emphasis on quality, at least so it isn't WORSE than two years ago..."
