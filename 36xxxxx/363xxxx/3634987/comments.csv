,busymommy,2012-04-04T09:42Z,fast dl. thank you everyone for helping me complete the dl. thanks also for sharing this david. i should've opened the file with media player first because it works fine there. but i opened the file with vlc first and a message said that the file is broken and required fixing... it's okay now and plays fine with vlc but is a little out of sync. a10v7.
