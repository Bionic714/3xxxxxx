,basovich,2007-03-12T07:13Z,"nice upload:D
but how do I burn this and with wath progam, I use Nero but I can't change the files in a ISO file."
,kulkul,2007-03-13T21:32Z,"It's not iso-format. Start Nero smart start, and choose to burn dvd-files. Drag the video ts-folder from the rigth window and drop it to the red video ts-folder in the left window. BURN!"

,Patton2,2007-05-01T19:50Z,"I see the a similar torrent inside here has dts.
That one is with Russian sound though....
Does this have dts?"
,Assassin546,2007-05-25T14:07Z,"thanks for upload, but this torrent contains over 4.7 gb
, that`s to much for one dvd. I know how to burn vts files, but when so many, does it matter what files go on each dvd? What files do I drag to cd1, and what files do I drag to cd2? "
