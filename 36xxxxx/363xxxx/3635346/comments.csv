,B-manSwe,2007-03-09T23:09Z,"btw, is this a missing rar or the rarfix??"
,Mizled,2007-03-12T01:01Z,"Again, for the 100th time QUIT FUCKING COMPRESSING/RARING SHIT. JUST UPLOAD THE ISO OR THE VIDEO_TS FOLDER!"
,alderbaran,2007-03-13T04:58Z,"Mizled: Y not ? If ey pos too have a fkup line or stpid setup in Y.R. client.
If sm fuckt, jst downit agai`n.

Aw'm awf ta bid. G'noit."
,padkraprao,2007-03-18T11:04Z,"I agree with Mizled.....I don't get it, why rar the files?"
,Daddy_Spank,2007-04-10T15:33Z,"it ensures that the quality remains exactly the same, since winrar checks every byte."
,russell1nash,2007-04-26T16:00Z,"First of all, PLEASE SEED!!! It's really a pain to have all but this missing one and no seems no seeders!!!
Second, PLEASE STOP ARCHIVING WIHTOUT ANY REASON WHATSOEVER!!!
A nice ISO will always do just great..."
