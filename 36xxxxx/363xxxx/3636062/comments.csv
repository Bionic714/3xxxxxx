,Lerssoni,2007-03-10T14:10Z,How about the impact of the second airplane hitting tower nr. 2 causing air pressure changes thus sucking smoke out of tower 1? Not enough cloak-and-dagger?
,stardude,2007-03-10T15:08Z,"Nice try ""Lerssoni"".

The building in the frame at 00:43 IS the South Tower where the second airliner had crashed!

Heads-up! The smoke puffs coming out on ALL sides, all around on the very same floor coincide with the start of the big ""unreported"" explosion from the North Tower, which is for some reason, off screen to the left.

It seems like the big ""visual"" fireball explosion in the North Tower was rigged to hide the sound and smoke of the explosions in the South Tower, note that the giant flames and subsequent smoke from the North Tower effectively camouflage the smoke from the explosions in the South Tower.

It would be VERY interesting to know the exact timing of this shot."

,Scudmeister,2007-03-11T02:49Z,"I once showed a friend WTC7 collapse.
He said it was clearly controlled demolition and it was done months after 911.

Then I pointed out to him that it was on the same day and at first he didn't belive me and called me nuts.

Then when it occured to him it was on the same day he said fires brought it down something he first didn't even belive in.

Some people are really dumb-"

,asdhokker,2010-03-18T12:25Z,"was it this video?
watch?v=h2c4DRR_150

seems that the plane hit and explosion was so intense that the air pressure blew out the smoke from the first tower"
,asdhokker,2010-03-18T12:32Z,"ook, it was this one:
