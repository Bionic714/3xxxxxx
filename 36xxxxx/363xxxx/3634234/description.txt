We're also releasing the latest Simpsons episodes from now on: http://thepiratebay.org/user/sN1b . Try these for size :P.

It's important to have the best and latest codecs! Read the FAQ if you have any questions or problems: http://users.pandora.be/sniber/yumi.html . So pls spare us the whine "why mkv and not avi/Xvid" when you actually have no clue what you're talking about.

Remember to seed pls.
