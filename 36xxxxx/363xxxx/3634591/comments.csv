I have same problem with these moviex torrents..."
,eriksson-,2007-03-08T11:05Z,"The set limit of peers ain't that big of a probleme since you've got two trackers, plus the fact that the moviex tracker is full of slow american connections. :)
I usually disable the moviex tracker to get higher speed, like 1.0mb/sec."
,dagenham,2007-03-08T11:45Z,Sounds good but how do you disable the moviex tracker please?
,nakk,2007-03-08T12:02Z,I changed from azureus to µTorrent and now downloading works just fine :)
,dagenham,2007-03-08T12:14Z,Re my earlier post I use BitTorrent by the way. And thanks kollll for the upload!
,Twinrehz,2007-03-08T12:48Z,"Worked fine downloading it, but since I'm using Azureus and running on a Mac, I can't use uTorrent. That kinda sucks... But it worked!

Thanks alot for the download!"

,massenz,2007-03-09T09:24Z,"For a start - I dislike multi-RAR torrents, as it's a pain to pull them back together.

Most crucially, when trying to open with WinRAR it complains that the file is corrupt or missing some header info.

Am I missing something here?"
,srnnnn,2007-03-13T07:25Z,"""Most crucially, when trying to open with WinRAR it complains that the file is corrupt or missing some header info""

This doesn't happen very often. If it does, you can try to redownload just the one rar file that's corrupted. 

Another thing you can try is something I discovered with VLC media player. If you're unrarring a video file, pause winrar partway through, and use VLC to open the video file. Because the unrarring isn't complete, it won't play, but it'll usually ask you if you want to ""create an index of the files"" or something like that. Select yes, then resume unrarring. For me, even if winrar says something is corrupted, VLC still plays it for me. I'm not sure why it works, but it does."
