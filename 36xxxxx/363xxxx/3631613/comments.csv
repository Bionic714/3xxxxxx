,SixxGunz,2007-03-05T14:29Z,"I saw this movie the other day (in theater). LOVE IT! I am definitely buying this when it comes out on DVD. Just wanted a copy of it until it comes out. It is too bad that the audience is so LOUD on this copy, and that someone's head keeps popping into the picture. Too distracting...takes away from the movie!"
,Iceburgslim,2007-03-05T22:02Z,Alot of movies from this user have been that way.  Maybe if they tried going to an early movie......or during the week.
