The Majestic stars Jim Carrey as a Hollywood writer Peter Appleton who gets in a car crash and loses his memory. He is found in a town that has been hit hard by the war. The townspeople want so badly to have their boys back again, that they mistake Appleton for one of their soldiers.He comes back with a soldier\'s welcome and he believes for a while that he truly is their lost son. Eventually Appleton comes to grips that he is not who the people want him to be. This movie is well done by Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption/The Green Mile). Martin Landau was great as the grieving father of a lost son at war. This movie has some great moments and it has a well put together romance in it. Also, notice Matt Damon\'s voice is cameoed when reading the letter from the lost son.
