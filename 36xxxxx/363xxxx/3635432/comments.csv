,ladyinpink,2007-03-09T19:00Z,Is this a good print?
,EmesiS,2007-03-10T00:53Z,Yes this is the best picture quality so far. Sound is a little crappy but no crowd noise like the CAMERA version. 
,EmesiS,2007-03-10T09:52Z,"Spoke too soon...there are cuts in the movie. It skips in parts, like it jumps 1 or 2 seconds. So this one has probs, but it is the best picture quality so far. "
