,Decca1226,2007-03-10T18:41Z,"I prefer ISO format = dos not have to unpack = if i have to unpack it takes double the diskstorage, the downside is if there is an error on the download on my side i might have to download the whole iso again (if it is several rar files i can re-download only the files that is corrupt. You should also offer a IMDB link like this : http://imdb.com/title/tt0106308/"
