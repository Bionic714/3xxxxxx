,BrenJames,2007-05-06T00:16Z,"I really want to see this movie cos I adore Natalie Portman. But I am always reluctant to d/l anything by kollll!!! Theres usually something wrong with his/her downloads. Either they freeze and wont burn to disc, or they never fully download. Anyway, I will comment again when this is complete....if it ever is!!"
,livingdots,2007-09-16T22:13Z,"Thanks kollll!

BTW, BrenJames/mrcobra are obviously idiots, or working for the MPAA. There's nothing wrong with this torrent. The releasegroup is mentioned in the fucking torrent name, you fucking idiots... Check VCDQuality for info, or read the fucking nfo that is included in this download... NOW FUCK OFF AND DIE, ASSHOLES!"
