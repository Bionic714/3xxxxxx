1) Install App
2) Stop EdgeCLS process in a tray (right-click-> Close)
3) Copy edgecls.exe from a MAGNiTUDE directory into \Cam (replace original one)

that's all"

I need it to use with Vista..."
,rotonone,2008-04-27T03:25Z,this seems to work fine fast download. however do not stop the EdgeCLS as it won't run just copy the license file over and it works fine and when it boots don't register it just press the register later button
