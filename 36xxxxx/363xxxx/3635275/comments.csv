,argotera,2007-03-21T21:33Z,"sorry about that 0.01%. I Left the pc running and left for 10 days because I had to go and actually snowboard instead of just watching other people doing it. For some kind of reason the pc shut down,anyway. I 'll finish it now."
,forsman,2007-03-23T19:04Z,"Thanks for the movie! But, I have a little problem here... Well, maybe not a problem, but I cant watch the movie. It's just like 20 small movie files that just show around 1 second. I'm sure that it works but I just dont know how to play it :) If anyone knows, please drop a comment. Bye!"

thx and greetZ :-)"
,argotera,2007-10-08T20:36Z,"to all the people asking how to watch the movie:

1.create a dvd with two files in in it. one named VIDEO_TS and one named AUDIO_TS.
2. put all those files of the torrent in the VIDEO_TS file,
3. burn it.

Igf you use nero and choose NEW->DVD video, it will automatickly create these folders for you."
