,raindr0ps,2007-03-14T17:13Z,Looks like each album is ripped to a single wav file but what is BEATLES.EXE and what is INSTALL.EXE installing?
,angshult,2007-03-15T18:18Z,"The ""Beatles.exe"" is the menuprogram. I don´t understand the hole menu. If you want to leave without the CD coming out use ""alt+F4"".
I don´t use ""install.exe"" at all. 
It´s 22khz wav-files. All on one CD-rom. Fancy uh?"
