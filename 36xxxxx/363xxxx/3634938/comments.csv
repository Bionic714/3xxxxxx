I did not upload the original release so it's not my fault he didn't do an SFV check. I noticed there was a problem and provided a fix for it. I also posted about this fix in the original release so people could find it easily. Finally, I uploaded it here because it is directly related to a full DVD release and anyone looking for the full DVD of Blood Diamond would need this. As Gandalfvit said, if people are looking for the fix, this is the best category.

I find it strange you would complain about a wrong category to someone who took the time to post a fix to help other users when the original uploader was rushed and made an error."
,gbussh,2007-03-13T18:27Z,Whining and complaining ..that's all what a f*king moroon can do. Thanks dureca. Unfortunately it cost me already one DVD-9 ;-)
,PhotoMurray,2007-03-20T05:46Z,"Thanks durerca, and don't listen to people like MattiP. I have only ever seen him/she write the same thing over and over to many other people. 

@ MattiP are you the category police..... all you do is complain about what you think is in the wrong category. Have you ever heard of the words ""thank you"", I guess not."
