Proof? If you compress this file with Winzip/Winrar you get a file of 637Kb. That will fit on an old-school floppydisk!

I've heard of great compression but this is truly incredible. ;-)"

Nero doesn't recognise the .NRG file, neither does AstroBurn and Deamon Tools will not mount the image.

Don't download, it doesn't work :("
