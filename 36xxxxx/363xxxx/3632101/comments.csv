,yamahafox,2007-03-04T21:50Z,This is already posted but itss the best one out there
,spok70,2007-03-04T21:53Z,"I suggest to download thi one:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3631799/Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator.4st.March-CLoNY

it is very easy to use!"
,XweAponX,2007-03-04T22:30Z,"1) Just for safety I Skanned with NOD32:

Scanned disks, folders and files: ParadoxVista\CERTS\;
ParadoxVista\2.dat; 
ParadoxVista\3.dat;
ParadoxVista\DIFxAPI.dll; ParadoxVista\NFO.nfo; ParadoxVista\OEMTool.exe; ParadoxVista\pkeys.txt; ParadoxVista\readme.txt;
ParadoxVista\royal.inf;
ParadoxVista\royal.sys

No Virii detected!

(This was done just to shut up the fukkkers
That spout Virus! Virus! without fookin chekking
that their arse is not their head)

2) This looks good: WILL test it out on my alternate
Vista Installation, and report here asap:

Q: Do I need to remove the Timerstop service before I try to apply this? -Or can I apply it while the extended 30-day priveliges are in effect? I mean willl that foul it up?

I assume the timer stop service can be deleted via SC.exe (If Need Be)

To Paradox: BIG THANX just for the effort of releasing this. I don't know who Posted this, but thank you for posting Paradox?. Ehehehe!"
,Laej,2007-03-05T02:27Z,What about x64??
,Tmas,2007-03-05T03:27Z,DOesn't work. Tested and couldn't get it to work.
,jnd,2007-03-05T09:15Z,It's confirmed to work..
,kerperker,2007-03-05T13:14Z,"Works 100% with Vista Home Basic.
Don´t forget to copy the OEM certificate to C:\ before step 4 !"
,karl500,2007-03-05T18:11Z,"Will this erase the original BIOS?

Will it work with an ASUS P5VD1-X MOTHERBOARD?

A few weeks ago I tried a similar trick(chinese oem-bios hack) & my motherboard stopped working.

,The.hot.sex.,2007-03-05T19:40Z,"These cracks are not supposed to touch your bios, so it wont mess it up, at most you will have to reinstall vista if something goes wrong. I can confirm that this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3631256/OEM_BIOS_Emulation_Toolkit_For_Microsoft_Windows_Vista_X86.v1.0- works 100%"
,isakth,2007-03-05T22:16Z,I'd like to confirm that this works on Vista Ultimate build 5840.
,spok70,2007-03-06T21:29Z,"NOT working on 64 bit.

For 64 bit version you can download timerlock crack."
,orionthx,2007-03-09T23:58Z,i need a crack that lets me sign on msn...
,orionthx,2007-03-09T23:59Z,"these timerstoppers, doesnt allow me to sync my time and sign on msn...Is there a crack that allows us to get updates?"
,zoneman53,2007-03-15T00:23Z," Just installed it on one of my machines. Works Perfectly 100%.
 One hint though. 
Run all the commands from the command prompt after you disable UAC and reboot and install the bios driver (i.e... cmd.exe).Took me a bunch of tries until I figured that out. Could't get it to install until I ran all the commands from the command prompt!"
,xroblade,2007-03-20T11:21Z,"100% working and now testing will report findings in 1 month
P.S. Follow the instructions perfectly typo""s are n0t acCeptable,, aS i f0und 0ut."

Someone at m$ is going to get suspicious.
But what can they do ah, block 'SLP 2.0' dont think so."
,grisfett,2007-03-21T21:21Z,"I got an error message on the 5th .. something ;p

Run 'slui.exe 0x2a 0x35' to distplay the error text

,war59312,2007-03-25T04:38Z,"Yes the paradox crack for Windows Vista works 100%!!!!

,tucsonwoody2,2007-03-26T04:08Z,Someone I know used this technique successfully.  Vista Ultimate showed as activated.  Then Windows Genuine Advantage ran and access was denied after that.
,itdiesnow,2007-03-27T16:14Z,works perfect! time remaining is always 30 days
,macondo2000,2007-03-31T08:51Z,funkar inte för vista 64. finns det ngn som man kan använda i vista 64?

,ebaysales1,2007-04-12T05:50Z,I just wanted to say Thank You!!! works 100% perfect!! so easy to use love it!!! BILL GATES EAT MY SHORTS! 
,xroblade,2007-04-13T13:13Z,"war59312 i have your vista and this crack works well, M$ updated and all. Can't fault this crack and it has been over 30 days."
,motoxyz,2007-04-26T02:00Z,"Does anyone know if there are any updates to avoid when using the paradox crack?  Seems like M$ is coming up with a new one every day, and I'm just getting up to speed on vista.

I guess the worst case would be reformatting my vista partition and reinstalling...oh noes, i lost 2 hrs."
,yayikaka,2007-07-27T22:01Z,"YOU FOOLS, the OEMTOOL is infected with a trojan called MAL/PACKER, a behavioural malware worm that auto unpacks. It automatically installs a remote network driver,which allows others on the network to remotely and steathly logon to your computer while online. You cannot uninstall it unless you totally format your hard drive. If you doubt this comment, scan the royal.sys file with updated SPY SWEEPER or SOPHOS antivirus 7.0.This Paradox OEMTOOL belongs to cyber criminals."
,jetguy35,2007-08-05T01:06Z,"How do you use this download? When I ried downloading it, it just shows up as a file that has no program to run it. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks."
,yayikaka,2007-08-13T17:26Z,VIRUS INFESTED SHIT
,ivan_213,2007-08-30T01:01Z,It is infected scan with kaspersky and you will find it
,ivan_213,2007-08-30T01:04Z,Does any one know how to get rid of the virus?
,sillen90,2007-10-12T21:37Z,Its not virus infected the file is hackin tolls to hack the system files so you dont need to activate windows thats all
,snowhow,2007-11-20T06:26Z,I can confirm sillen90's comment. I had a similar experience with an XP activation tool wpa_kill.exe. Two different programs called it a virus and it wasn't. Some of these tools will trigger virus scanners because of the way they're coded.
,entrovert,2007-11-28T22:10Z,"It worked allright,
'slong as Norton 360 doesn't flag it, i'd say it works."
,RanShak,2008-02-27T12:07Z,"Crack works flawlessly, however:

!!DO NOT INSTALL VISTA UPDATE KB940510!!

It detects this."
,hintzsche,2009-01-02T00:03Z,Igot a blue screen after installing royel and reboot
,cfowler,2009-01-23T03:41Z,alright can someone please explain more throughly #4 of the instructions?!? This shit is not working for me...
