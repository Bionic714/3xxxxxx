Read the MIS Info Video 2.5 post. I voted for a 
better UI :D but what do you want? 
new UI, more codecs or more features.

It's cool because you can see a map of voters. 
P.S. Someone voted 2+ times Not cool :( 
I zoomed all the way to see it

The more people use the .MIS, the more chance to get
in a DVD Divx player :D"
