Episode 218 "Wash" 
Airdate: 02/26/2007

The audio file plays on the laptop. Michael, Lincoln and Sara don?t breathe as they listen to the recording. When the file finishes, Sara in shock says, ?Oh my God.? Lincoln paces and tries to grasp what he just heard.

Mahone stands before the photos of the Fox River Eight at the FBI command center. He draws red X?s through Haywire and tells the team that C-Note has been incarcerated and is helping track the brothers. Agent Wheeler presses Mahone for information about C-Note?s detainment, but Mahone ignores his request. Agent Lang informs Mahone that Sucre was almost apprehended in Mexico, but before he can voice his concern, his eyes see Bellick, standing in the office doorway. Mahone excuses himself and guides Bellick to his office.

Mahone closes the door behind him and wants to know what Bellick is doing there. Bellick has come for the reward money on Haywire. Mahone tells Bellick he was supposed to be ?under the radar,? but Bellick doesn?t care. Bellick, thinking he has the upper hand, sits down and puts his feet on Mahone?s desk. Mahone pauses, then knocks Bellick?s feet down. Before Bellick can move, Mahone presses his foot into Bellick?s twisted ankle. Mahone keeps his cool and tells Bellick he has to be patient. Mahone warns that if Bellick ever shows his face in the FBI office again, he?ll ?never see the cash, and you?ll never see another sunrise.? Mahone then offers to Bellick, ?You ever been to Mexico?? and hands him the file on Sucre.

Lincoln tells Michael and Sara that if the take the audio file to the media, they government will discredit it, just like they did with the video they recorded earlier. Michael says their father was working with people in the administration. If they can find these people, they can take President Reynolds down. Lincoln offers to call Jane Phillips, the woman who worked with their father and is currently watching LJ.

Somewhere in Chicago, in a secluded alley, a man hands Kellerman a sniper rifle from the trunk of a car. Kellerman looks the gun over, feels its weight, and checks the scope. He takes the case from the man, and then puts a large sum of cash into the man?s hand. Kellerman leans into to the trunk and puts the gun in the case. When he stands, he?s brandishing his silenced hand gun and shoots the man in the chest. When the man falls, Kellerman fires another shot.

C-Note sits in an orange jumpsuit, huddled impatiently over a laptop. On his screen is the website EuropeanGoldfinch.net, which Michael intended to use for the remaining cons to communicate. C-Note has left several messages for Michael, hoping to lure him out of hiding. Mahone paces in the room with C-Note, also growing impatient. C-Note tells Mahone that Michael is too smart for the FBI and if Michael sees an unfamiliar face when it comes time to meet, it will just send him back into hiding. C-Note and Mahone argue over whether or not Michael even checks the site. C-Note tells Mahone they just need to wait, and Mahone snaps back, ?I?m the only one in the world right now helping your family.? C-Note defends that they both need each other and he intends to hold up his end of the deal.

A house phone rings, and LJ answers. Lincoln asks him how he?s holding up, LJ is doing well. Lincoln apologizes for taking so long to call and tells LJ that they think they finally found something that can let them be a family again. LJ?s eyes roll, he?s not convinced. He interrupts Lincoln and tells him that he?s back in school, under an alias. He?s making friends and starting to feel like he?s at home. He asks that Lincoln just leave him be until he?s sure they can be safe. Lincoln, devastated, asks to speak with Jane.
