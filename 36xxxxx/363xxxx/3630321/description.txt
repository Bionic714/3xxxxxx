Being a ten hour audio book in mp3 format. A witty eco-fable,

Wild Hard Green tells the story of an Earl Chameleon,

his personal physician and a Bufo toad who go back

in time in order to steal Charles Darwin\'s notebook - and thence

forge a new theory of evolution so as to prevent the future \'man-mess\'.

 

Also starring the Arhc-Boa, the Elephant Chief, the Harpy Vice-Chief,

the Gnats Templar, a computing Queen Termite, a gang of tough penguins

and various other creatures.

 

A funny and mystical tale with more twists and turns than a strand of DNA.

 

The first 3 hours or so can be listened to for free by clicking on

the links below. It will likely take a minute or so for the files to

open (or you can right-click and save them)

The first segment is a nifty trailer (recommended).
