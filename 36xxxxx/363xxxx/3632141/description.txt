If you're a fan of the late John Candy (as I am) you will most likely love this movie. Candy stars as Harry Crumb, a bumbling detective who comes from a line of great detectives. In his investigations, he uses a great many disguises (much like Chevy Chase in "Fletch"). Crumb is totally clueless, and Candy really takes a funny script and makes it even more funny. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should the viewer. Great Movie. Will be converting more of my John Candy selection soon. Enjoy !!!!
