,taigkyo,2008-02-26T19:24Z,"For many of us it's all about the song first, the performance second, and the recording last. 

The sound quality is poor; 

The Ants were at their prime in '78. Well, in '79 they were better musicians and the songwriting was sometimes a little more clever; but their energy in '78 was incredible. Comparing live recordings from these days to their few studio recordings is night and day. Comparing them to the Ants/Ant solo from the 80's onward is just inconceivable.

I'll see if there's a torrent of ""In Bondage"" floating around; if not, I'll get that going. It's the only live rec I've heard from the 70's-era Ants that sounds really good. I mean, the sound quality is about as good as MC5 ever got ;-) but it's better (in sound quality) than this one."
,taigkyo,2008-02-26T19:39Z,"I found a torrent of ""In Bondage"" on Mininova... If you like this one, check that out too.

,mczplwp,2009-03-22T05:13Z,I haven't even dl'd this torrent yet and I'm gonna like it! I first heard them on 'top of the pops' when I was in Pakistan around '80-'81? Ant Rap was the release.  
,jasoncb,2009-05-04T00:01Z,"if anyone reads this who has dl'd this please seed it for a day or so. i and a few others are stuck on 73.9%. if i can get it all i'll seed it till everyone has it that is waiting,

cheers"
