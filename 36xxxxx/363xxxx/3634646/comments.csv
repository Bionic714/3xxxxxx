,bigroo,2008-05-16T09:13Z,"It would be great if the other songs from the JAZZ album were also included instead of 11 (eleven) versions of the same song ""Big Bad Bill Is Sweet William Now"". I had hoped that someone may have decided that it is frustrating to waste time downloading the JAZZ selection and deleted it from the file. Rather disappointing considering the other selectios are of such high calibre."

I somehow miss the fantastic soundtrack from Wim Wnders ""Paris, Texas"".
Anyone who can upload it?

,lmcogs,2012-02-23T23:28Z,thanks great upload but has anyone noticed the album Jazz that all the tracks are the same?  Every track is track 1 but different titles.
