The Yoga of Offering Food by Lama Zopa Rinpoche   PDF file 48 pages

All the things we do -- eating, walking, washing, working, talking -- everything can become very powerful methods for quickly achieving enlightenment. As we purify ourselves and collect extensive merit, we bring ourselves closer to enlightenment every minute of every day. In this way, we make our lives most beneficial, meaningful, satisfying and fulfilling. Through the Mahayana practice of offering the food we eat which is based on the Hinayana and adorned with the Vajrayana our lives become most beneficial, not only for ourselves but for all sentient beings.

The Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive (LYWA) is the collected works of Lama Thubten Yeshe and Kyabje Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The Archive was founded in 1996 by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, its spiritual director, to make available in various ways the teachings it contains. Publication of books of edited teachings for free distribution is one of the ways.

Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche began teaching at Kopan Monastery, Nepal, in 1970. Since then, their teachings have been recorded and transcribed. At present we have more than 10,000 hours of digital audio and some 60,000 pages of raw transcript on our computers. Many recordings, mostly teachings by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, remain to be transcribed, and as Rinpoche continues to teach, the number of recordings in the Archive increases accordingly. Most of our transcripts have been neither checked nor edited.

The Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive is a member of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition. We are a 501(c)(3) tax-deductible, non-profit corporation dedicated to the welfare of all sentient beings and totally dependent upon your donations for our continued existence.
