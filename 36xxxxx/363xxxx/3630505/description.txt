This is 4-CD set on the EMI label, compiled by Jacques Bourgeois, which contains over 4 hours of the best Maria Callas opera performances.

All 4 CDs are encoded with LAME and are high-quality VBR MP3s.

I also scanned the front cover and booklet, which contains all of the information on the music and more.
