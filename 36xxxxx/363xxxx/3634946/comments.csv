,DiMuSve,2007-03-08T22:49Z,"Many thanks!
Saw this on TV for maybe twenty years ago and it's a fantastic movie!!"
,mitteget,2007-03-09T01:16Z,"I already have this one on a (legally bought) dvd, otherwise I'd downloaded it as fast as possible.

This movie competes with 'Spinal Tap' as the best rock parody ever made. (And how do I get THAT one, with my prefered subtitles...)

Actually, to REALLY understand this film, you have to be a long-time fan of The Beatles. 

But kids, don't be scared by that comment, 
The Rutles are probably fun without knowing details of the 60's. They twist and shout Beatles' songs, turn them upside down or do the choruses backwards; you'll recognize it without knowing it.
Just like their parody of the Beatles 'Anthology' 3x2 cd series, called 'Archeology'.

And if you don't like it, show it to your parents.
