,swillynswilly,2007-03-14T08:16Z,"hey been out of the psp hacks loop for a few months, is this dark alex's the best custom firmware to use? I know about playing iso and hook boots, so im not dumb about playing iso and things. do i just download the dark alex's custom firmware? if theres another step or its not that easy if someone could link me a website with some more info/"
,Esuna,2007-03-14T09:14Z,PSP-Hacks.com Alex has a 3.10 custom firmware but 3.03 OE-C is the way to go.
,Esuna,2007-03-14T14:51Z,"I'm still seeding, I seed for a long time, it's just hard with 114 leechers O.o
And yes, Einhander is great. all the Square games in this torrent were ripped from original scratchless white topped discs (none of that silver topped greatest hits crap)."
,Esuna,2007-03-14T15:02Z,Anybody found a way to get Parasite Eve 2 to work on the PSP? The first one just doesn't slake my thirst for Aya.
,swillynswilly,2007-03-15T19:21Z,"ok, sounds good so things like iso fast loaders will work on the custom firmware, right?"
,Esuna,2007-03-15T21:51Z,"I myself never used the fastloader stuff. I believe you can still use it as the custom firmware is designed to basically run 1.5 and 3.03 at the same time. I'm sure the good boys at PSP-Hacks.com (or W/E site, I just like those guys) can answer you a little better than I can."
,swillynswilly,2007-03-18T07:12Z,"ya thanks esuna, the firmware works great. now you dont need any fastloader or anything. iso and these kind of games work with it great. thanks again"
,Esuna,2007-03-18T22:23Z,"No problem, I'm happy to finally contribute to i site i d/l from regularly. got a new torrent coming up, making it as i speak actually. keep and eye out for it."
,DeadlyBro,2007-03-27T03:37Z," A have a general question about psp downgrading. i look at the back of my psp and opened my UMD drive. and it says ""IC1003"" is tht the number i need so i can downgrade andthen get the newest darkalex firmware? please help thx peace."
,Esuna,2007-03-27T17:41Z,"that number there means you have the newer motherboard. there is an extra step involved in downgrading newer version motherboards. check out psp-hacks.com they entail the whole process, a good secondary site is dl.qj.net. also the upload for ff7 disc is confirmed not working, have a new working version i will be uploading later today, will post link. anything else you need i will be checking comments every couple hours today."
,DeadlyBro,2007-03-28T14:08Z,ok thx thts good info. soo i can still downgrade and play as muhc games as everyone esles and stuff right?

,pajautus,2007-05-23T20:47Z,Everything works on 3.40 OE-A perfectly. Thanks.
,Shmegrian,2007-08-18T14:08Z,"has anyone been able to d/l the new ff7 disc 2 rip, cant seem to find any seeders"
,Zack257,2007-09-12T20:54Z,Same here. I was about to download this torrent in hopes of the disc 2 working.. but no such luck Im guessing.
,Dudewithoutapet,2007-12-18T21:39Z,"Not sure if you still read this, but Esuna, thank you so much. I'm gonna post this in your other torrents as well in case you see this one and not the others or vice versa."

,Esuna,2008-04-05T09:59Z,"I apologize for my inactivity on this torrent, had a server crash and stupid me had no backup. original files are lost sry all. for a guide on how to make your own psp rips search for a guide to dark alex's firmware and it should contain a popstation guide."
