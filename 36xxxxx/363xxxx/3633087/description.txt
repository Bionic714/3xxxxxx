Ann, 23 years old, lives a modest life with her two kids and her husband in a trailer in her mother's garden. Her life takes a dramatic turn, when her doctor tells her that she has uterine cancer and only two months to live. She compiles a list of things to do before she dies, arranges her family life and falls in love to a lonely man she met in a laundromat.  Written by Moritz Muehlenhoff {jmm@mmuehlenhoff.de}
