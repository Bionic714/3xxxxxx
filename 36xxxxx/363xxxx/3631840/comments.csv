,likeafox,2007-03-18T17:31Z,"After mounting the image and installing, it says I need to insert the correct CD, is there another iso that is needed? Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
,1337king,2007-03-21T17:45Z,likeafox: I think there is a crack in the image... try to look in your mount drive when you have it mounted.
,likeafox,2007-03-21T21:36Z,"Ah! Okay, so I figured it out, though the description could be clearer. Once you install the game, open cd folder and find the run game exe in the crack folder. Drop that wherever you installed the game, and when it asks to replace the existing file, say replace. This installs the no-cd crack, and you're good to go. Great game, great seed!"
,virrefiiirrre,2007-03-31T23:06Z,"Hi im kind of a newb, byt I need some help. I've used WinRAR to pack up the file. Which program should I use to open the opened files? "
,likeafox,2007-04-01T16:55Z,"Download daemon tools like it says, and use that to open the .iso files. This makes a virtual cd rom drive that can run iso's without burning the CD. Then see my comment above (that's critical, won't run without moving that crack to the installed folder) and you should be good to go."
,constra,2007-04-02T17:55Z,"Wtf..
I extract it,overwrite the crack and then i want to go into the game but a black screen comes waits a little and then kicks me out of the game....
Can anyone help ? "
,awohgasiodhfzkl,2007-04-13T16:31Z,"constra - i have the same problem. i think it may be hardware rather than software. i have used this game from CD before, and had the same (or similar) problems. what video card do you have?"
,Heelalgod,2007-04-18T19:53Z,"I'm having the same problem, but I used to be able to play this game with a CD
I have no idea what to do"
,Heelalgod,2007-04-18T19:57Z,"Btw it's certainly not the graphics, I checked and it doesn't even run on lowest graphics"
,tigerlord21,2007-04-20T18:17Z,it doesnt work daemon tools can see the iso it sucks
,tigerlord21,2007-04-20T18:21Z,were is the folder?
,mustis (finnish),2007-04-30T12:24Z,So do you need the iso file to install the game or to start the game? I have installed the game without me needing to do anything but unzip... but when I try to start the game it says to place the cd in. So do I need the iso file there or do I need a crack? Well anyway where can I find either of those?
,Natural Light,2007-05-29T05:46Z,doesn't work for me at all... the openin screen come up fine and then freezes when the sharks are heading after the kid in the water.....
,PLEYA(Player),2007-06-13T19:56Z,can someone plz help me i cant unzip the file or find the iso file wen i use deamontools: mount image... i cant find the black and white file at all.
,Smaxar,2007-06-15T20:39Z,Where is the ISO. file?
,edk128,2007-06-24T03:34Z,"I dont understand why this does not work. I would really love it if somebody would explain this so that I (an idiot) could do it. In my black and white folder I have The shortcut to my cd drive with a picture of black and white on it, BNW.iso file, a keygen, and a crack folder. Is there anything I need to remove or add or alter? I have installed the program with Daemon Tools. First, how can I fix it so that when I try to play it doesnt give me the message to insert the cd into the drive. Also, how do I start the program, as in, what do I click on?"
,edk128,2007-06-24T03:37Z,I just dragged the crack folder in my black and white folder. It never asked if I wanted to overwrite anything.
,edk128,2007-06-24T23:19Z,I got all that right. How come the game tells me theres an error when I start it up?
,pbransford,2007-06-28T17:51Z,"Can you not read?

""(need DAEMON TOOLS to mount ISO file)""

That tells YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO"
,Nito12,2007-07-05T00:51Z,"I?ve downloaded and installed this successfully with no problems whatsoever. For those who say it doesn?t work, it?s either your machine or you aren?t installing it properly. 

Here?s what I did: (I use windows XP SP2)

First you?ll need to download and install daemon tools if you haven?t already.
(http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5)

Once the download is complete, extract the files to the folder of your choice.

Open daemon tools

Right click the daemon tools system tray icon, go to ?Virtual CD/DVD Rom?, then to ?Device?? then click on ?mount image? .

A diaolog box will open, find the BNW.iso file and click open.

Once the image is mounted, got to My Computer.

RIGHT click the BNW drive, select open.

Find and copy the crack (runblack) and serial # text file to the folder of your choice.

You can now install the game by clicking the BNW mounted image from My Computer.

Use the serial number provided when installing.

Once the game is installed, copy the crack (runblack) to the game?s directory folder (usually -> C:\Program Files\Lionhead Studios Ltd\Black & White).

And you?re done! 



PS. I had no use for the keygen included in this torrent."

Are you on crack!? you can close explorer.exe whenever you want, just open it back up by using the applications pane of task manager, selecting ""new task"" and typing explorer, press enter or click okay and you're back.

Oh, and defragging is a waste of time. stop living in 1998"
,thezzy33,2007-11-10T17:12Z,"Ok so have tried everything mentioned here to try and get this game to work.

,nawcom,2007-12-30T14:35Z,"Heh. From my quick overview of issues reported here, most have to do with the fact that you didn't follow the instructions. 
Hutlernn: read -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defragmentation

everyone: if the instructions don't get the job done, then take a computer class. then try again. if after even though you think you understand the instructions and applied basic computer software troubleshooting skills yet still can't get it to work, then give it up. You're dumb. Buy the fucking game.
"
,Geekster123,2008-01-04T07:28Z,"Ok look all you dumbasses. I'll tell you exactly what you have to do. Now if you don't get it your retarded. I don't know why you even have a computer. 

Ok so first understand this. 
You CLICK the ""Download this torrent"" button. 
Get it? Good.

Second. To download this torrent you can do it whichever way you want. But I prefer to use BitComet. BITCOMET is a software DESIGNED for download torrents so I would sugest you use it. But if you don't want to then I dont give.

Third. Now when your done waiting your ass for the download to be complete. You open the folder which has the files you just downloaded. Now if you don't know where that is your reatrded. 

Fourth when you open the folder you see two files. One iso. file and one Keygen file. 
Now open up your deamon tools. ok? Now I dont use deamon tools. I prefer Power ISO. But hey use whatever the hell you want. 

Fifth ok so it's open right? Ok now target the iso. file you just downloaded from THIS torrent. Ok. So basically just open it up. Now when its there on Deamon tools. Click on Mount Image. THERE SHOULD BE ANY BUTTON THERE SAYING MOUNT IMAGE. Now when you click it pick a drive. ANY DRIVE. Doesn't matter. It's not hard..

Sixth. Ok so you mounted it. Great. If you didn't well good job retard. Now you see all these files and what not. RIGHT? Ok so select all of them and extract them to anyfolder you want. 

Seventh. Now open up THAT folder you just put all those files in. Now you should see a setup application. Ok so obviously setup the program. 

Eight. Done? Great. Now wherever you installed the files from the SETUP you just did now, open up that folder. Opened it? Nice. Now you see more files and whatnot. That's perfect. 

Ninth. OK NOW go back to the Folder you put all the files from where you EXTRACTED FROM THE ISO. FILE USING DEAMON TOOLS OR Found it? Good. Now you should see a folder called Crack. And no don't think it has actual crack inside you steroid freak. Ok so open it up. You see two files.
One that says runblack.exe and one that says serial. Copy those files OK?. Now go back to the folder you installed Black and White from the SETUP. Go there and paste the files. It should say you want to replace this file with this file and some shit. Ok so if you did that and pasted them you should be done. 

Tenth. Try it out. Have fun. 

Ok if these steps did not work for you. Then you suck. Ok im a twelve year old boy. ok. I know this shit. So if you cant figure it out there is no hope for you. Go buy the game you broke idiot. ITS NOT HARD."
,Gamefreakguy,2008-01-06T13:06Z,I could not find an iso file... just teo of torrent files and  somekind of team x thing... ? Could you help me?
,Wopatoolie,2008-01-20T21:48Z,"geekster, if ur 12 ur mommy should wash ur mouth out with soap for swearing and whoop u with a belt buckle for speaking to ur elders like that, besides the fact that ur dloading bit torrents. instead of acting like a spoiled arrogant    little prick be thankful these people posted these torrents for you and try a little niceness in helping next time, you may even get a thank you instead of me putting a spotlight on your asshole-ishness"
,mr.serv-on,2008-01-25T14:13Z,"It works fine for me so far. I'm using Vista and there hasn't been any problems. However he really should have pointed out that the crack is in the iso, and Geekster those are some god awful directions. 
1. Mount image w/ Daeomon tools
2. If you don't have autorun on go click on the drive to start the setup.
3. Use the keygen for the code and install it
4. If you try to play now you'll get an error saying insert cd, so go to the drive you mounted the iso on(in My Computer) right click on it and pick Explore.
5. Open the ""Crack"" folder, copy runblack.exe, paste it over the one in the location you just installed the game. If it didn't ask if you wanted to overwrite the other one, your in the wrong folder.
6. Have the iso mounted on Deamon and run the  game."
,czarleonard,2008-01-26T20:24Z,you guys don't all have to be dicks to the newbies. give them help if you want to but get off your fucking high horse first.
,KristinAuxD,2008-02-12T20:34Z,seed plz!
,Bubblehead123,2008-02-12T22:46Z,"One day Mr. Noo Bee was surfing around on the internet watching some softcore girl on girl porn when his download of Black and White finished.  Overjoyed, he rushed into his download folder and opened it up and clicked on this file that said set up and that file that said keygen and dragged over the other file that said crack and.. oh no!

Much to Mr. Bee's dismay, nothing happend. :(

You see, when Mr. Bee was a little boy and downloaded WinRAR/zip/whatever, he happily clicked through all of the default settings so that WinRAR sees *.iso (And a ton of other file types) as just another archive to unpack.  So since he is afraid to use anything except for the wizard, he automajickally unpacks the entire CD to a folder on his computer and since it looks a lot like all the other games he has installed, he thinks everything is hunky-dorey.

However, if he were to go back and look at the original file, he would realize that THAT was the *.iso he was looking for all along.

Then, Mr. Hole and all of his rude instructions to Mr. Bee would realize he was just as big of a jackass (Well, slightly less since he pays attention to file types as opposed to file-type icon associations on his windows machine).

And they lived happily ever after."
,originalsbtg,2008-02-17T21:43Z,"HINT about finding the ""folder that you installed it to"":
-Search ""lionhead studios"" in the search field of your explorer window in ""my computer"". 

-There will most likely be two. find the one with the ""black and white"" folder. 

Follow the instructions that the helpful others kindly provided. 

props to all who still love this game."

,FaustSnake,2008-06-10T23:32Z,"Does anyone else has this problem: When I play this game I have no music.

When playing the actual bought game this problem isn't there so I'm sure it has to do with that this is a ripped game.

I'm not saying it has to do with this rip in particular since it happens in every version I've downloaded.

Has anyone else experienced this or is it just me?
If anyone else has experienced this how did you fix it if you managed to?"
,Ylva69,2008-06-11T09:44Z,Vad är ISO och keygen?
,Nickynicky47,2008-06-12T19:23Z,"Okely Dokely here is how i did it, it worked perfectly:

1) Ok download Blackandwhite.zip
2)Mount the image  (i used DAEMON tools u can use iso buster w/e) 
3)Once its mounted open it
4) Ok now theres 2 ways we can install it #1 is open up the keygen that came with this and when it asks u for the key use keygen. #2 you can click autorun then go to control panel and set it up.
5) The games set up perfect. Now in the BNW.iso folder is anouther folder called crack.
6) Open crack and you see a .exe called Runblack.exe
7) Take runblack.exe and put it in where u installed the game (C:\Program Files\Lionhead Studios Ltd\Black & White)
8) It'll say would you like to replace the file with this one?
9)Click yes
10) Perfect! Ok now when ever u want to play the game just click Runblack.exe in the folder were u installed the game."

go ""my computer"" then right click on the drive it's mounted in and click ""explore"". copy the ""runblack"" file and paste it into ""C:\Program Files\Lionhead Studios Ltd\Black & White"" (or wherever you installed it to) when it asks, go ""replace"".

,oioioiiksdcfvgbhnj,2010-04-07T11:53Z,"Ok, I need help. It isn't running, and I think it's because I need to put the runblack thing in the folder, but it is meant to replace something, isn't it?
Have I missed something? What has gone wrong??
Help!!
Waap. :|"
,oioioiiksdcfvgbhnj,2010-04-07T13:31Z,"Oh, and PS, the message that appears says:
The application has failed to start because IFC22.dll was not found. Re-installing may fix this problem.
I am using Windows Vista.
Please help,
Waap. :|"
,liabilitylukee,2010-04-16T17:43Z,"Works briliantly!!

1 - Unpack the file using winRAR
2 - Mount the image using Daemon tools or other similar iso mounting software
3 - Install the game - dont play after you've installed just yet!
4 - Go into the crack folder and copy and paste the file into the download directory (my computer - Drive C - Lionhead studios - Black and white) when asked to overwrite click okay.
5 - play the game

additional info - If you click the game to start it, and it loads the black screen, then crashes to desktop, open up daemon tools or your mounting software and just re-check your image is still mounted. thats all I had to do and it solved this problem!

Great upload :) be greatful guys :) Pirate for Life! "

,bass_bovee,2010-06-21T05:40Z,thanks this is an amazing game. Took me a little while to realize the crack is in the iso file. Will seed one for one at lease. thanks!!
,oioioiiksdcfvgbhnj,2010-07-09T03:10Z,"Okay. I tried again, but now when I try to run  the setup, it says setup.exe is not a valid win32 application. Is there anything I can do to fix this?rnrnAlso, do you do the whole overwriting of the crack thing before or after the installation?rnWaap. :|rn"
,camarPL,2010-07-11T17:21Z,Is there anyone who uses Windows 7 and the game is working ?
,wwfpro1,2010-09-02T05:20Z,"Guys forget the bulls***. I found a easy version of Black & White.It's a portable (no install) version that works like a charm. No fuss,no muss as the old people say.Http://rs-catalog.com/games/31446-black-and-white-portable-pcg.html"
,celeste821,2010-09-13T14:34Z,"I finally got it to work thanks to the lame brat Geekster123, u guys kept saying to mount the iso file when in fact you have to mount the iso zipped package. I kept unzipping the package and looking for a iso file. but the problem now is, when I'm finished play and save and quit, when I try to return I get the black screen for a few seconds the back to windows. I searched for another crack but it's the same one that came with the torrent."
,Rycyy21,2010-09-18T21:29Z,"Hi, I've tried downloading this, and for the most part.. im pretty good at torrenting..
but, when i try and use daemon tools to mount the image, its mistaking it and a winzip file.. so it wont open.
any help would be great. =]]"
,Lolacaust101,2010-09-19T20:37Z,"slight problem, i've done everything as u have all instructed but when i go to run the game, i get one of two error messages. These are:
""Please insert the correct CD""
""Ih has stopped working""

Baring in mind that i've copied and replaced the ""runblack.exe"" app with the no-cd version, anyone got any suggestions as to how to fix it?"

,fraserfinlay777,2011-05-15T17:46Z,Anyone else getting malware detections from this? They might be false positives but im not sure yet. Im gonna finish installing and stuff then see...
,fraserfinlay777,2011-05-15T23:40Z,"OK there isnt any viruses on this (ignore my last comment). They were false positives so no harm done. Having some trouble getting it to start though. I went into the program files and took out ""runblack"" and inserted the .iso, but when i open the game and click play the box disappears and nothing happens. Is this happening to anyone else? Was I supposed to remove ""runblack"" or is it something else i have to take out?"
,fraserfinlay777,2011-05-15T23:42Z,"OK i just realised im a fucking idiot. Everyone just ignore my comments, they are all bullshit..."
,fraserfinlay777,2011-05-16T12:08Z,"Got it to work. Follow advice given by Nito12 on the first page of comments. Really helped me out!

Awesome torrent btw!"
,cryoce,2011-05-19T03:58Z,Got a virus from the keygen just wanted to let ya know
,Xpt420,2011-06-26T21:23Z,"yes the keygen is not necessary

i love this game, and will seed forever

if you love something, seed

also i will take this opportunity to give a brief course on installing games like this:)

this particular file is zipped, so unpack the folder and you will find the .ISO file and the keygen (which is useless, because the key is included within the .ISO)

the .ISO file is a CD image file containing not just the information from the CD but also the security code overtop all that data

you need a program that is designed to read and write such a file.  programs like this are Daemon Tools, MagicISO, or Alcohol 120% ect.

using one of these programs you can burn the .ISO image file to a CD or create a Virtual Drive and mount the image too it tricking the computer into thinking the CD is in a drive

when you've mounted the image or inserted your burned CD (i recommend mounting for installation) you will be able to file explore the CD.  inside you will find the 'crack' folder containing the 'serial' CD key as well as a file titled 'runblack' which you will use to replace the file with the same name located in Program Files after installation

btw there is not a no-cd crack in this download, just burn one if you dont want to run a virtual drive, not that this game is very big at all

so here's a quick point guide

1. extract BNW.ISO file
2. Mount, File explore for 'crack' and Install
3. replace 'runblack' in Program Files with crack
4. Seed and Enjoy :)"

,oldirtyjsus,2011-06-30T20:04Z,"i've done everything, replaced the runblack file with the cracked version, the game comes up for like 10 secs then crashes and yes, ive mounted on daemon tools before running, i would very much appreciate some help please!!!!!!!! maybe i dont have a good enough graphic card or somethin?!?!? please get back at me asap plzzzzzzzzzz"
,pabolton,2011-11-18T02:48Z,"xpt420 is correct
DO NOT USE KEYGEN
simply mount and open the file once mounted. "
,remdog666,2011-11-25T09:52Z,"Followed the instructions to a T, got the game to run a black screen with music and then nothing. I'm sorry, but this simply does not work. If anyone can help me further I would appreciate it greatly, but if not... Don't download, does not work. "
,GuiBrazil,2011-12-07T21:46Z,"FIRST THING GUYS! IT´S SOMETHING WRONG GOING ON!

1- I download the file.
2- I open the file and it isn´t NO ISO file. There´s just a .rar file with the name ""BNW.ISO"".
3- I open that file, and appear the normal things. Autorun.exe, Setup.exe and etc.
4- I install.
5- I cracked.
6- I open the game.
