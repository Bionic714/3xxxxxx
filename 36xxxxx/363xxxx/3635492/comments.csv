,artytorrent,2007-10-05T13:26Z,"Torrent appears to be OK. UnRAR the two RAR files into one folder and hit setup. Keygen provides user name and serial, but I couldn't get FL Studio 7 or Acid 6 to boot up with this installed in my plug-ins folder.
The PDF file says you need MSVCR71.dll in the Windows\System32 folder, but I have that already.

I couldn't get CMZebra (the free version bundled with Computer Music magazine) to work either, so it's probably a processor issue. I don't think this software requires an SSE processor, but it looks like you need something better than my old AMD Duron. :(

Thanks for sharing anyway. Maybe someone else can confirm that it works on their system."
,artytorrent,2007-10-05T13:30Z,"Also, there is no uninstall program, so you have to manually delete the dlls from your VST plug-ins folder *and* the presets which are stored in C:\Program Files\U-he to get back the 24MB it ""stole"". ;)"
,toybox13,2008-04-30T01:13Z,"this torrent works but the developer of zebra has an anti-cracking thingymabobby contained within the vst.so after a few mins the plugin starts to melt away,what a hebrew.if neone finds a torrent where this system has been beaten plz post a link up here."
,kissturtle76,2008-09-16T09:44Z,OMNISPHERE torrent anyone ??
,Moodscapes,2010-03-01T04:41Z,"When installing in Vista, run both the setup.exe and keygen as administrator. Be sure to enter your own unique name in the keygen name field. If you leave it as ""TeamAir"" it won't register and will remain in demo mode."
,paidpirate,2010-10-20T18:42Z,"what works for me. i unzipped both .zip files. then u only unzipped the .rar file, not the .r00. then i ran the setup.exe ans used the keygen. I left the registrants name as TTeam Air"" and it works just fine in Cubase 5. this little 10 mb, synth has to be one of the best kept secrets in softsynths the sound blows away several multi-GB synths that I've tried. (NO, NOT Omnisphere..lol..)"
,tannazia,2011-04-17T08:30Z,Works fine on Intel dual Core machine running W7. Nothing special about the install except that you must remove previous install of Zebra to use this version... Cheers
