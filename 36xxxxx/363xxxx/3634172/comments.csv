,pilatuspilot,2007-12-31T13:09Z,"Thanks for this, thneo.
There are angels & assholes on every corner. The internet, from the moment it became easy for anyone with the ability to use a mouse-controller, has become a haven for the community of anonymous assholes to shout the loudest on threads where what they have to say is not only unwelcome, only demonstrating their need to be heard. 
Unfortunately, any religious file, from whatever stance, shared, seems to be an open invitation of the lost to shout how right their unhappy soul is and how wrong the religiously jubilant soul must be. And they keep shouting & shouting & shouting .... For what reason? Because no one ever listens to them, except to note their sullen unsatisfactory life.
No one wants to read these numbnuts' words. Feces wordage is all they have to offer and all they will ever offer.
Again, thanks for this movie. It's a beautiful telling of a beautiful story, mythological or deeply religious in accordance with some belief systems and spiritual mileaux."
