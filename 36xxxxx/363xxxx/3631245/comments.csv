,jdrake_2,2007-08-01T01:40Z,"Thanks IggyPop for making this available.  The subs are there.  Get XP to associate the sub file with VLC.  Then select the sub file, then while within VLC open the avi file and the movie will play with the subs.  There may be another way to do this but it worked for me.  I used VLC v0.8.6c."
