...Here is the initial announcement of the original release of the keygen, and here is the followup post in which the same author acknowledges that the program is fake.

Apparently, the keygen program does legitimately attack Windows Vista keys via brute force, but the chances of success are too low for this to be a practical method. Quote from the author: 'Everyone who said they got a key is probably lying or mistaken!'""

,Srix0n,2007-03-06T13:28Z,"Its a brute force keygen, it hits it over and over, of course the chances are low, and actually it did work for me, im running it on my vista machine right now ... it just took 2 days to get it..."
,P1R4T3,2007-03-06T16:24Z,It wont generate any key. Its useless.
[T],nobody2007,2007-03-06T21:45Z,"macworld has written yesterday:
""The unknown hacker who claimed last week that a tool he?d created could generate valid Windows Vista activation codes has admitted that the crack was cracked.

?Fact is the brute force keygen is a joke, I never intended for it to work,? the individual identified only as Computer User wrote on the KezNews Web site over the weekend. ?I have never gotten it to work, everyone should stop using it! Everyone who said they got a key is probably lying or mistaken!?

Watchers should have seen the confession coming. On Friday, Computer User issued an online apology and professed his love for Vista. ?I apologize for exposing the work-around in question. I regret the fact that it has been leaked all over the Net, which I guess was to be expected. I simply love Windows Vista, and I happened to stumble upon this trick. Everyone should stop using the brute force KeyGen altogether because it takes away from legitimate customers.?

,Srix0n,2007-03-07T00:49Z,"At the end. why would he say :it takes away from legitamie customers"" if it didnt work? it got a serial for me... :)

Mac world is just finding some wayt o mock PC users. and you helped them.. moron."
,unloosed,2007-03-08T06:26Z,"Macs have always been, and always will be, superior to PCs.  Get used to it.

Only reason I am using Windoze is because I pretty much have no choice.  That and Macs cost more.  They are worth every penny, but you have to have the pennies to spare first."
,Srix0n,2007-03-11T08:11Z,"Ive used both, and actually macs are only good for sound and video editing, PC's are only crappy because they use windows. and the peopl ewho use them are generally stupid... but ask any computer PC/MAC adept. they'd use a PC over a mac anyday, 1.. so they can play more games then just pong... 2 Compatability and choice of parts, overclocking, customization useability. and its just stupid to put a mac anywhere but a video or sound studio because everywhere else uses a pc.. so just stick with that people use."
,Srix0n,2007-03-19T04:21Z,it did for me.. sorry.
