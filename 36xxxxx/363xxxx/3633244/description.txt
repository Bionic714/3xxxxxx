1: download the torrent.

2: make a backup of C:windowssystem32slmgr.vbs (in case the keygen works, replace it back with the original)

3: use slmgr.vbs from the zip-file to replace the one in C:windowssystem32. If you have problems with permissions, select file...goto properties....take ownership....then change permissions.

4: write down your partial or entire productkey. You can check your key with "magic jellybean" (from our pack)

5: goto Start > Run, type "cmd" and OK. Now type "C:windowssystem32slmgr.vbs -ipk generate". A process called "wscript.exe" will start and can take quite a lot of CPU resources. It will check aprox. 10000 keys per 30 minutes.

6: now the waiting begins. It can take very very very long before you get some results

7: after some time (hours, days) check your productkey with "magic jellybean" again to see if it has changed

8: if your serial has changed try to activate Vista by going to Start > Run. Now type the command "C:windowssystem32slmgr.vbs -ato"

DONE!

KEYGEN PROVIDED BY SRIXON...thanks folkes for your "patience!" Laughing

DISCLAIMER: under no circumstances should anyone sell the key that they generate. I do not support Piracy, this was simply an experiment in which i used to practice my vbscripting. This was just for fun and was a complete accident! sorry for cracking your beautiful operating system BILL GATES
