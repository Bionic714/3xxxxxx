No matter what i tried, i couldn't get my network card to install, even with the vista drivers so i am back on winxp.

the cracks has been removed and i need some cracks for this version"
,rooey,2007-03-15T02:46Z,"hey guys i just got my vista going, and a lot you may have a problem with the internet driver but here's a really simple way to fix that without going online

if u havent formatted ur hd yet, then righ click my computer, properties, on the top left corner click device manager, and you see network adapter with a yellow mark, click it, and when it gives u 2 options, 1 is to go online and look for it and the other is to manually find it, click the manual find, and browse windows.old (where ur old files r), then it should install by its self.

BEST OF LUCK GUYS!"
