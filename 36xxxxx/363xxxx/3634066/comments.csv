,loc0000,2008-08-19T09:11Z,"if u want ''scientific evidence....then play with the placebo effect... 
you obviously heal when you are strong enough....against conflict in your environment...
whether by mind or body .....

.and NOT making your mind not stronger will succuumb you to those that are truely masters of theirs alreaady ...
and that is your own fault for being inside of your bubble of circumstance...

take control of circumstance or be controlled by circumstance...with and in through others is not unparallel to your problems...

,rarson,2008-08-30T03:49Z,"I watched the DVD version of ""The Secret"".  It was like a made-for-TV infomercial for the ""law of attraction"".  Seriously, they take a concept that takes all of 5 minutes to explain (your attitude, be it good or bad, tends to attract the same kind of attitude back to you) and expand it into a brain-melting 90 minutes of self-help wackos talking about shit that mostly doesn't even make sense.  You're left thinking ""what are they trying to sell me?""  Oh yeah, the DVD.

It's literally the most basic piece of information present in every single self-help piece of advice ever given, talked up like it was some sort of mystical secret, and the key to  (no shit, they tell you that if you concentrate on wanting money, it will come to you, as will anything else you wish for).

It's good to have a positive outlook whenever possible, but this goes way beyond making such a simple statement, indulging in people's desires and selfishness, and encouraging them that all they have to do to get everything they ever wanted is to think reeeeally hard about getting it.  Oh, and of course it's all wrapped up in a nice thick coat of ridiculous mysticism.

Waste of time, jdylan already told you everything you need to know."
,rarson,2008-08-30T03:51Z,"Whoops, those brackets aren't allowed.  I meant the third paragraph to say ""the key to --fill in the blank--""."
,rarson,2008-08-30T03:52Z,Second paragraph... apparently I'm not reading my own writing very well tonight.
,fekona,2008-09-07T16:03Z,"I am here to say that I have read the book and it DID change my life!! I got out of extreme poverty I now run my own business and I have found my soul mate if you want good results you cannot be a pessimist like the rest of the people here posting... Being closed minded will NOT get you anywhere in life! If you take this message to heart wonderful things WILL happen!! 
p.s. I even was able to quit my anti depression medication!! "
,mahipal,2008-11-28T15:19Z,what is the password for this archive ?
,toecutter169,2009-05-20T19:13Z,"there's no password, plays fine (at least the first file)"
,sumit111124,2011-03-03T08:12Z,"Seriously, if the only principle of the law of attraction has changed lives, then you guys should really read classics like ""The Law of Success"" by Napoleon Hill, which is 1k+ pages, or simply read James Allen book ""As a Man Thinketh"". These are 2 books which will take your life to a whole new level..."
,katchyusername,2012-08-13T07:33Z,Those starving kids in Africa need to get ahold of this book and start doing some positive thinking about some food :/
