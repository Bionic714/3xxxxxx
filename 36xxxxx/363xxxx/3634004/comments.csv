,swag,2007-03-07T18:46Z,serie nr??
,venicevenice,2007-03-07T18:56Z,"usudekin: yes, you need Mac OS X to run this, as it clearly says in the Torrent comments.

swag: no serial number is necessary, if that's your question... I don't speak Swedish."
,Papa_Leech,2007-03-07T21:51Z,Is this for intel?
,usudekin,2007-03-08T01:09Z,"Venicevenice

I am running OS X 10.4.8 On PPC G4"
,venicevenice,2007-03-08T03:24Z,"papaleech: for PPC or Intel

usudekin: Hmmm... I dunno, are you running the US-English version of OS X? If you are, I don't know what to tell you. If you aren't, maybe it's only for US-English.

The ESD in the filename just means it's an electronic download."
,applehadis,2007-03-09T15:51Z,Seed please
,verw8ing,2007-03-09T19:23Z,"Its PPC. Altough on intel it will use rosetta, it will not unistall on my MBP"
,fat_tony,2007-03-11T19:58Z,FFS fel ställe att lägga ut detta på. Oavsett om det fungerar på mac eller inte så är det onödigare än herr Gates själv... aja skyll er själva!
,tdcool,2007-03-30T16:50Z,"Thanks! This is a fully working copy of Norton Antivirus. Runs pretty fast on my Intel MacBook. Note: this is only AntiVirus, not Firewall and other stuff."

,bruno_83,2007-06-17T05:48Z,"You need Norton Antivirus for MAC just as much as you need a cock up your ass..

(..which would explain all the downloader's ""traits"" pretty good..)"
,scisound,2007-07-27T01:41Z,"don't be fooled with that ""macs don't get viruses"" ethos. viruses on mac happen.. believe it"
,j_s_j,2007-08-06T21:57Z,Thanks!!
