,darknessv,2007-03-09T09:59Z,"Programme Synopsis:
?The prevailing global-warming view is that man-made emissions of carbon dioxide are largely responsible. This film, featuring leading academics in fields such as climatology, oceanography, meteorology and biogeography, questions the science behind the accepted reasons for global warming and argues that other explanations ? including the effect of the sun?s radiation on the atmosphere ? are not being properly aired. It also asserts that the single-minded focus on reducing carbon emissions might have the unintended consequence of stifling development in the Third World, prolonging endemic poverty and disease.?

,legod2,2007-03-10T04:23Z,Can anyone comment on the quality of this file?
,gsx1400,2007-03-10T19:56Z,"A quick comparison between the three versions of the documentary on this site: The 502 MB file is ok. The two larger files are good. Go for the 697 MB file at least.

This documentary is really good. Extremely high credibility. Hope that it will make an impact."

,Kemisten,2007-03-11T01:49Z,"Political and economical interests, yes that´s right but how much money is the oil industry putting into politics by lobbyists? Our hole economy is based upon oil and other nonrenewable energy resources. 
800 years delay between CO2 and temperature can be explained by: the sun is heating the earth and more water is evaporation as they say and forms more clouds. The earth becomes cooler and more ice is formed at the poles. And so on. They also mention that water is a greenhouse gas. Yes, thats is right but the water on the earth is cycling around. It is the same water today aswell as one million years ago. When we are burning fossil fuels the concentration of carbondioxide will INCREASE in the atmosphere and the equilibrium will be changed. In the future lead to hotter earth becouse carbondioxide is a stronger greenhouse gas than water. Burning of wood NO NOT contribute to the global warming becouse it is the same thing as if the tree has fallen to the ground after it´s lifetime. 
People in the undeveloped countries can use their fossilenergy but why not go beyond those resources that will end some day anyway. And if they are using more of fossilfuels like Kina who is building one new cole plant every week then we here in the west must use less becouse the concentration will otherwise increase. We must develop cheaper renewable energy before the oil is becoming expensive!! It´s better to do the right thing from the beginning. 
The thing is that even if the human population is effecting the total concentration if greenhouse gases only a little that is the only thing we can do anything about, can´t we?"

,salitine,2007-03-28T11:25Z,"Professor Wunsch said: ""I am angry because they completely misrepresented me. My views were distorted by the context in which they placed them. I was misled as to what it was going to be about. I was told about six months ago that this was to be a programme about how complicated it is to understand what is going on. If they had told me even the title of the programme, I would have absolutely refused to be on it. I am the one who has been swindled.""

When told what the commission had found, he said: ""That is what happened to me."" He said he believes it is ""an almost inescapable conclusion"" that ""if man adds excess CO2 to the atmosphere, the climate will warm"".

He went on: ""The movie was terrible propaganda. It is characteristic of propaganda that you take an area where there is legitimate dispute and you claim straight out that people who disagree with you are swindlers. That is what the film does in any area where some things are subject to argument.""

,CoMMaNcHe,2007-03-31T06:03Z,"Don't pay any attention at all to ""salitine"" - he/she is a disinfo-terrorist employed by the NWO to spam BS on the internet."
,ya2sin,2007-06-26T14:08Z,"""The fact remains that in a sample of 928 peer-reviewed scientific papers published between 1993-2003 not one disagreed with the consensus position that human activity is causing climate change.""

""Moreover, while the programme-makers labelled the source of their world temperature data as 'NASA', the Independent found no such graph existed.""

(We feel swindled. Indeed we are not the only ones: Carl Wunsch (who was a surprise addition to the cast) was apparently misled into thinking this was going to be a balanced look at the issues (the producers have a history of doing this), but who found himself put into a very different context indeed.)

Prof Wunsch's complaint is that the documentary is no more than propaganda. ""I was misled as to what it was going to be about,"" he now says. ""I was told about six months ago that this was to be a programme about how complicated it is to understand what is going on. If they had told me even the title of the programme, I would have absolutely refused to be on it.""

""In October 1998 a television producer named Martin Durkin took a proposal to the BBC?s science series, Horizon. Silicone breast implants, he claimed, far from harming women, were in fact beneficial, reducing the risk of breast cancer. Horizon commissioned a researcher to find out whether or not his assertion was true. After a thorough review, the researcher reported that Mr Durkin had ignored a powerful body of evidence contradicting his claims. Martin Durkin withdrew his proposal. Instead of dropping it, however, he took it to Channel 4 and, astonishingly, sold it to their science series, Equinox.""

""Mr Durkin has often been accused of taking liberties with the facts. In 1997 he made a series for Channel 4 called ?Against Nature?, which compared environmentalists with Nazis, conspiring against the world?s poor. No one would suggest that green claims should not be subjected to critical examination, but the people he interviewed were lied to about the contents of the programmes and given no chance to respond to the accusations the series made.""

,oldngrey,2007-10-18T05:43Z,"The Big Myth! Global warming.
The film ""An Incovenient Truth"" would make a great presentation if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forbodding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depressed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temperature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobel prize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not su"
