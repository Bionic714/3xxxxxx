I also like to watch eng sound + eng subs although have no problem with english, but I want to enjoy the story and not get lost in translation. So it's good you keep the subs on as they don't take much % from video compression.
Please don't forget to put some info about the rip, at least the basics like Mr_Fear (or see eg. aXXo's release details). That way you get trust and credit.
Thank you in any case :-)"

,eldard,2007-03-15T22:27Z,What is the quality? Mr_Fear's 60-70% sucks. I'm better off with dvd rips from another torrent site.
