,Howard_Z,2007-03-14T16:55Z,"Why do apparently smart people do stupid things like put a compressed movie into a RAR file?

I have never ever successfully got a movie that was RAR'd.  WinRar always issues hundreds of corruption messages."
,BerserkTomte,2007-03-14T20:23Z,"Howard: Then you're not doing something right. 

As long as it's 100% downloaded and allocated there are no problems whatsoever with .rar'd files, at least not for me, as long as the original wasn't corrupted.

But I do agree that compression is usually not really warranted. 

Downloading sample of this thing atm, hopefully it'll be decent enough to watch. "

After using VDub to extract the audio content from each file, and after normalizing  the audio, I was able to make a very well-playing DVD with audio/video in sync.

Funny note.  I saw the film at a local theater.  And during one scene, a guy  2 rows back from me started laughing and said something that made me immediately look at a Spartan soldier speaking to Leonidas.
