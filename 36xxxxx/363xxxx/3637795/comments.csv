,potatoz,2008-03-22T01:49Z,You gotta burn the file to a disc using Nero. I was unable to mount the image even if when I converted it to .iso. Once you burn the disc it should run fine.

,9nn9,2010-08-09T14:39Z,"+ The download only took 5-6 minutes. 

- When I mount and try to install I get a message ""this game does not work on  the 64-bit windows version"". I use Windows 7. Does anyone know were I can find a 64-bit version of this game or do I need an older version of Windows to play this?"
,9nn9,2010-08-09T17:13Z,It worked on my old computer with XP but not on my new one with Windows 7. Good torrent!
,VuortenP,2011-01-28T00:27Z,"works like a charm on win7 c64 WITH a DosBox.
Just mount your dosbox folder and cd drive, the cd drive as a cd drive duh.
From the cd under heroes2 folder run install.
It'll install the game on to the designated/mounted dosbox folder.

Still might want to get the gold version with the expansion set."
