,nerys,2007-04-08T23:33Z,This is a slightly defective torrent. The ISO is REGION 2 (parts 1 2 and 3 are fine 4 and 5 are region 2) when I rip the disc and reburn it simply says invalid disc in the DVD player (if I play the original burn it says invalid region and the computer says its region 2) how do I fix this? is there a region 1 torrent for discs 4 and 5 ?
,dbot,2007-04-09T00:30Z,To change the region simply run it through DVD Decrypter 
,Audiocracy,2007-04-15T09:35Z,"There is one file that preventing this DVD from loading in Region 1 DVD players. You must change the file VIDEO_TS.IFO from Region 2,4 to region free. 

To do this:
1. Extract the iso or copy the contents off the dvd if you have already burnt it onto the computer.
2. Use DVD Decrypter to check the region information of the IFO files in the VIDEO_TS folder of the DVD/ISO. (You should only need to do this with VIDEO_TS.IFO as the others are region free)
DVD Decrypter > Tools > IFO > Region Information > Navigate to the VIDEO_TS folder and select an IFO file
3. Change the region information of the affected file (VIDEO_TS.IFO) to region free by going to DVD Decrypter > Tools > IFO >  Region Patch > Region Free > Navigate to the VIDEO_TS.IFO file.
4. Reburn the files onto a DVD."
,Knivez,2007-04-16T23:07Z,"I use this method to make any DVD Region-free:

Tools needed: Daemon tools and DVD Shrink.

-Mount the iso or img with daemon tools, open DVD-shrink and hit ""open disk"".

-Select the mounted DVD

-Don't do anything if you want the dvd exactly as the image you downloaded.

-Hit ""back up""

-Select region-free and save as ISO image, no transcoding is needed if the source image is a DVD5 (4.7GB)

-Burn your newly created image

,stressedAsHell,2007-05-01T03:25Z,"If playing the dvd in its original file form on the PC with Deamon simply change the Region to Region 2 in Deamon.
When I tryed to play this is asked me to change the Region itselves"
