The Last Days of the Raj

It is 60 years since the Indian subcontinent tore itself apart in the horror of partition. This drama-doc re-tells the story of Britain's (arguably botched) withdrawal from India and the traumatic birth of Pakistan. In the haste of the process, vast population movements, riots and massacres took place, though for many years the full shame of 1947 was obscured by the fact that it wasn't in the interest of Britain, India or Pakistan to describe it. No preview tapes were available but with James Wilby as Mountbatten and Roshan Seth as Jawaharlal Nehru, this promises to be a worthwhile, if painful, history lesson.
