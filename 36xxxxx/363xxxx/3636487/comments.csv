,tech_burn,2007-03-24T09:09Z,Well this would be wicked if there was some seeding happening
,tech_burn,2007-03-24T18:55Z,"well thanks whoever decided to seed, and thanks for this torrent, you pretty much nailed the best of what I thought was good.  Hope you do more soundtracks."
,Toothpick,2007-03-29T17:59Z,"This is great, but does any one know if there's a torrent with all the music from Crackdown? Can't seem to find one."
,Ace_Terrik,2007-05-21T17:51Z,"Hmmm... it says that there are seeders, but I'm not getting anything. So, I'd really appreciate it, if someone would take the time to seed some more. I'll continue the good work by seeding myself... "
,Natter,2008-04-23T21:29Z,"I got the game, a suitable cable to my pc and a good soundcard. As soon as i find the time (at best in some weeks) I will rip and seed it. "
,X_ACIREMA_X,2012-08-08T04:03Z,I will seed the shit out of this if someone would just seed the remaining 15% I need.
,X_ACIREMA_X,2012-08-08T04:04Z,Someone should also do the Crackdown 2 soundtracks.  Those were epic and beautiful songs.
