,soldeerbout,2009-01-19T17:26Z,"I bought the first 2 seasons on DVD for 20 euro's a piece, what I concider a fair price. When I wanted to buy the third season (one week after I bought the second season) the price was suddenly raised from 20 euro's to 45 euro's. The price of the first 2 seasons was also raised.

A price raise of more than 100% in one week!? And they keep asking themselves why people rather download the content... "
,caine3320,2009-03-07T23:15Z,"Ok, I can't find the torrent file for the specific one I grabbed, but I'm pretty sure this is the right torrent (the only other 'Complete Season 3' torrents out there are either all one file or they've got Sweedish subtitles, and I know I didn't get those). If not, then I apologize in advance for this.

Do you people ever check your work? For the past several episodes, I've gotten glitches, digital artifacting, skips, and audio streams that are totally out of sync with the video within 3 minutes of the start of the episode. Seriously! I know that bit torrents are made available at the convenience of the uploader, but this is ridiculous. I have three jobs and two kids, and I still find time to check the stuff I rip and upload, so it can't be that no one has time. Thanks for the waste of time and the totally unnecessary frustration. I now have to download each episode individually. What really sucks is that I seeded this to 3.0, and now there are other people out there who will have to deal with the same thing. If you're going to upload something, at least have the decency and self respect to make sure that what you're uploading is of the same quality you'd want in a torrent."

,AbsolutZero,2009-08-07T04:53Z,"I don't really mind if the videos mess up a little. As long as they work 99% of the time then I'm good for a little mess up.

Thanks for the upload!"
