,drackenfirebreather,2007-03-09T20:47Z,"This is most defiantly the Win2k patch for DST and is not freely available w/o an extended contract with M$ - Yet another way they want you to convert to that p.o.s. operating system they call Longhaul...er...Vista.

From M$: 

Windows 2000 Update available - (under Extended Hotfix Support) Windows 2000 has passed the end of Mainstream Support and will not be receiving an update without Extended Hotfix Support.

All versions of Windows can be manually updated using the tzedit.exe utility or other techniques documented in Knowledge Base article 914387, Online Webcast 930688, and similar articles for other countries, which is the preferred method of remediation for any product outside of Mainstream Support. (The tzedit.exe tool allows you to create and edit time zone entries for the Date/Time settings in the Control Panel, especially for daylight-saving time). "
,shmoetheho,2007-03-09T22:48Z,"Hey Spacy,

As noted in the above message, you should have checked your facts first.

Windows 2000 requires the extended hotfix support in order to receive the patch. This costs $4,000.

Think, then speak. In that order. "
