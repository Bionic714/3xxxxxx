,zidern,2007-03-12T16:59Z,bloody rar crap
,tango11281,2007-03-20T11:36Z,"RAR - especially with multiple volumes - for highly compressed videos is plainly annoying. If you want to tag your rars - just put a second NFO file in the torrent.

I'm NOT going to reseed this shit as I'm not willing to waste my diskspace - 350 MB for the video and 350 MB for the useless rarred version... just great."
