Amazing selection of student animation films, showing off the brilliance of Gobelins and the quality of students they produce

Some of these students have gone on to work for Pixar (Toy Story, Monsters Inc) and Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age, Robots)





...and no I don\'t work for them



These were all downloaded from their site, which took forever, so I thought i\'d stick them in a torrent file just for you
