,Nikulinnn,2007-06-04T11:13Z,"thank you very much for your wonderful uploads! are there, however, any hints on how to make the downloads faster? F i.e., I am downloading 50 000 00 Elvis fans can't be wrong for 5 days already, so I do not actually risk to begin downloading something as heavy as this release, although I have a few parts of it on an old tape and would love to have in it's entirity...  However, Miguel28, thanks for your patience and love for Elvis! Just bring them on! ))) "
