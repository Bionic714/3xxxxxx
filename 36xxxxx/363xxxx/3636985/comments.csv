,siiix,2007-03-12T18:02Z,"it is the ORIGINAL file so you dont need ealink, it will NOT work with out legal cd-key (get it on ebay cheap $8 USD) then you register your cd-key on http://account.ea.com/oreg/entercode.jsp?locale=en_US&site=er"
,fuzzydude45,2007-03-12T19:11Z,i got it legal but when i install this and try to enter a northen strike map a message pop up and say i need to purchase it via ea link
,fuzzydude45,2007-03-12T19:28Z,doesn work via lan either
,Omegafrog,2007-03-12T20:56Z,ok  i am all about getting free stuff  but this time just pay the 10$  Ea has finaly made a booter pack for a fair price. 
,Drac0nis,2007-03-12T22:16Z,"10 bucks for 3 maps and 2 vehicles? WTF is that? This should have been in a patch not a booster. 
I miss the good days when companies realesed content for FREE. Back then companies were WORTH supporting with my dollars. EA is just a whore trying to milk all its properitys like this. Nickle and Diming all of its fans to death.  FUCK EA. "
,NighthawkX,2007-03-13T14:43Z,can this be played with razor1911 2142 via lan or single player or not?
,AranoX,2007-03-13T17:11Z,Only per Multiplayer LAN ! I have test it !
,naggi69,2007-03-13T20:40Z,"if I allready have bought the game bf2124 game, will this work? or can anyone find somesort of serial that would make it work? cause i have the game with a real cd-key...."

,naggi69,2007-03-13T21:43Z,well im gonna find out right now! :D I'll tell you later when i know!
,naggi69,2007-03-13T23:13Z,"IMPORTANT: 

Works JUST like a patch! If you allready own the game, this works perfectly! Just double click the .exe and it updates! You get the 3 new maps, and 2 new vehicles! 

Enjoy this one! This is great! 

THANK YOU AranoX!!!!

I almost bought the game! :P"
,naggi69,2007-03-13T23:45Z,"WAIT... DAMN!!! I was wrong.. didnt work!

You need somsort of EA link..... 

Im gonna see if there is a way around this!"
,naggi69,2007-03-14T00:45Z,"WTF!!?? WTF is that you have uploaded? It is not the real booster, the real one is 300Mb, and also when i installed this one, I saw no difference anywere!! is it some sort of spyware or what? where the hell did u get this!!? I dont understand.... when I installed, excactly what was it that i installed? cause i cant find anything!!!! not even on singleplayer!"
,AranoX,2007-03-14T13:14Z,No Spyware ! No Virus ! Nothing ! It's the real Booster-Pack !
,inachu,2007-04-09T02:25Z,"this multiplayer download does not work at all.
Yes I was logged in online duhhhh    retards"
,AlexMiguel,2007-05-25T23:44Z,dosent work 
,AranoX,2007-05-31T15:59Z,it works perfect on lan partys !
,dangermouse1984,2007-07-16T00:21Z,"Ok well one thing iv noticed about this file, it does add some things to the bf2142 programs folder checked it out with PE Explorer too. But it does not work. 
This is a piece of work gone wrong or maybe a way to get a virus or something onto your pc."
,dangermouse1984,2007-07-17T09:03Z,"Theres loads of these northern strike downloads but none of them work or will ever work because this is the version that is downloaded from ea games. Im guessing that ea hads blocked this one.
Its not a virus but if someone can figure out how to make it work then well done but I dont think you will."
,Spetsnaz420,2008-01-13T21:03Z,I legally own this...but piece of shit EA makes you install a download manager which doesn't work properly...I am hoping this version works for me...I have a legit cd key or whatever that they emailed me...so keeping fingers crossed
,boothroyd917,2008-02-17T20:47Z,"For anyone that cant get Northern Strike to work online, just reinstall the newest patch (currently 1.40) and it should work."
,marcusn,2008-03-14T22:17Z,this works.
,Sanderz,2008-04-29T22:25Z,"I bought this a long time ago, but after I reinstalled my computer, and EA took away EA Link, I couldn´t install it again. And since their support sucks, they won´t help me."
,Sanderz,2008-04-30T12:33Z,"Ok, guys this works alright. But I can´t play any maps with NS. But that´s EAs fault. Even when I had the real NS, the same message comes up. ""This server only allows players with unmodified content to join."" But the unlocks should work."
,Evalora,2008-08-08T12:22Z,"Okay, seeing as all the help on this torrent's comments is useless, I'm going to make a lot of people happy and show you the real way to get Northern Strike working.

Uninstall 2142, leave your profiles and all that intact at the end.

Reinstall 2142, get two patches from http://www.gamershell.com/pc/battlefield_2142/downloads.html, 1.40 full and 1.50 full, depending on your OS. They're usually called ""final"" and over 200 megabytes.

Install the 1.40 patch, this'll take a while since it's a -full- patch and patches it from every version all the way to 1.40.

Install the Northern Strike exe you get from this torrent in the following directory: C:\ProgramData\Electronic Arts\EADM\cache (change C based on your primary drive with windows or whatever OS) "
,Evalora,2008-08-08T12:25Z,"It's imperative you install it from this directory!

Install the full 1.40 patch -again-, won't take quite as long.

Install the full 1.50 patch, doesn't take too long either.

The reason behind this is 1.50 is missing many crucial files causing BFHQ crashes on viewing awards and making NS not work period.

NOTE: THIS IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK WITH ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE NEVER USED NORTHERN STRIKE, BUT IF IT WOULD, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE WAY TO DO IT."
,Evalora,2008-08-08T12:29Z,"This also fixes the annoying modified content error on joining games, as just installing 1.50 leaves out certain data for maps so it thinks you are using mods.

Getting kicked by punkbuster for blank reasons? Chances are it's your dual core system, PB doesn't like that. At all. Find this registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts\EA GAMES\Battlefield 2142\\ergc

Modify the registry, if it has two x9392's in the front or none, add one or remove one, respectively. It'll drastically shorten at some point, not a problem. This fixes PB blank kicks.

NOTE: BACKUP REGISTRY BEFORE DOING THIS"
,joshp123,2008-08-28T13:08Z,"evalora, first thx for your great tutorial.

however i tried your method, and while i haven't played NS before i think it should work. Although would it be a better idea to have EADM installed instead of creating the directory?

I followed your instructions and when i try to join an NS server i get the message ""joining this server requires NS, click here to buy it""

any ideas? i hope you read this lol, otherwise i'll have to work it out for myself ;)

thx"
,Evalora,2008-09-10T19:57Z,"Not sure, 2 friends did what I said step by step, word for word, and it worked perfectly, NS works for them now. I didn't have ea manager installed when I installed it from that directory, I just created it. But yeah, if you didn't install it from there you should, all of those steps are very important and should be done in that exact way, i.e. install 2142, 1.40 FULL patch, this torrent's setup from the directory I told everyone to put it in, 1.40 FULL patch again, 1.50 FULL patch and you're good to go, or so you'd think."
,ThaSwede,2009-01-11T15:29Z,"Evalora, I don't have the directory ""EADM"" Under Electronic arts in Program. Is it something I haven't installed or is it somewhere else? I'm running on Vista Home Basic"
,powerwolff,2009-02-01T19:59Z,Seed more please!
,ThaSwede,2009-02-07T17:42Z,I figured it out 
,_Black_Star_,2009-07-08T20:55Z,Will any1 please seed!..
,Wethe100,2009-08-28T03:50Z,"If u don't have EADM then 
go here: http://ea-link.en.softonic.com/
there should be a download link.. the file will automatically install in the location Evalora specified. I haven't completed in doing all the steps but ill post again after its all done and if it works or not ^_^"
,opel_gr,2009-08-28T04:00Z,"Thx so much for this upload. look for a long time i haw the game and update for real but when i try to get booster pack they say its been to long time sens your last bought some thing, and i cant get a download. WTF is that nothing has made me as mad as that SHIT. If i find out who got that idea i hope ill newer get to c him for his best. But they pr like to get torrentz up for there games "
,Wethe100,2009-08-28T21:20Z,I followed yr guide it didnt work for me...but then agin i never had northern strike so its not like it matters. BUT this did fix that bug when you go 2 look at yr rewards
,Original_Sinner,2010-05-10T02:29Z,"cant get it to work, waste of time"
,Komfy,2011-04-27T11:09Z,"This torrent is Not needed. You get Northern Strike free when you download the patch for battlefield 2142 at this location.
