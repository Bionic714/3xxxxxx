Early in 2006, a webcam was placed on the roof of an office at Nurburgring, a famous race track in the southwestern portion of Germany. Early March of 2006, I set a job to capture an image every half hour and left it running for a year.

This movie is the result of all those saved jpegs (somewhere around 10,000 frames). I filtered out the nighttime frames, which makes the time lapse movie significantly more viewable.
