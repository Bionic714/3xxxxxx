,Gnubbe,2007-04-13T22:45Z,It's something weird with this torrent. I'm guessing spyware but I'm not sure. I had a lot of problems deleting the file. Fuck Winterneuro
,altgeeky1,2007-04-27T01:20Z,"Being unable to delete videos is common Gnubbe. Rebooting did not work, correct? 

Try this: rename the file extension (or remove it). Now try to delete the file. Did that work?

If it deletes now, the problem is due to a ""corrupt thumbnail"". It's a Windows bug... if the thumbnail is b0rked, you can't delete the file. Until I learned the rename trick, I used to have to boot LInux to delete the files. Maybe Vista will fix this bug? ;-)"
