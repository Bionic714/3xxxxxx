This is the famous .dream (for DreamScene) Blissful Sunset made by Saphire on Wincustomize

This is a .dream file, you need 3 things to be able to use it. Windows Vista Ultimate (which you can download for ThePirateBay), DreamScene (which you download from windows update) and Stardocks DescScapes (http://dream.wincustomize.com/DeskScapes.aspx).

Will be seeding in 50 kb/s for a couple of days, it?s a small file so help seeding when you are done.


(This is the coolest wallpaper for DreamScene yet =)
