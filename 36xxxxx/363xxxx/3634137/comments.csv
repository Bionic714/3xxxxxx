Why bother with BT when you can download direct from the manufacturer?"
,lillebroder,2007-03-07T16:00Z,Because the serial for this isn't available. I know that there is a serial out there but can't find it. I was hoping this would draw attention to it and someone would post the serial. After that i could seed just the serial for 2.5.3186.
,Olive74,2007-03-07T23:42Z,"I just have SNs of 2.5.3060, if anyone is interested in..? Let me know. ;)"
,lillebroder,2007-03-08T01:26Z,If you could try the serials it would be great.
,c-r0ck,2007-03-08T02:46Z,The key that I got off of a comment here on the pirate bay for an earlier version worked for me. The key is: 9V07D-KJ94H-PWXE5-RST6I-LDQ40
,Olive74,2007-03-08T05:42Z,"Im PPC, not Intel based so I cant use this app... Sorry ! But SN that c-r0ck has given is one of mine, so lets try... ;)"
,blinkus,2007-03-12T09:26Z,The serial mentioned worked well
,WillePo,2007-03-12T15:47Z,"What can you do with Paralells ?
Is it Windows or :S? I don't know, so please explain what it is and how to get it to work please..

Thanks for seeding"
,yagoa,2007-04-03T12:40Z,how do u open a .sitx
,phreak22,2007-04-05T23:10Z,".sitx is a Stuffit archive. If you're asking, you're probably running Windows. If you actually have an Intel Mac and are just stupid then go to www.stuffit.com to get the expander for it."
,Zanevalon,2007-05-25T03:57Z,If i install this should i or can i update it to the newer version?
,aj2096,2007-06-08T03:15Z,"the program is available for free at much faster download speed directly off the parallels website.... just enter the passkey to register

theres no need for this on the bay"
