,Delichris,2007-03-04T22:07Z,"Forgot to mention that it also includes an NTSC display mode(but the save file is different to the American release anyway).Also,in case you were wondering,it doesn't work with PCSX2 at all."
,Delichris,2007-03-06T17:41Z,"Didn't want to triple-post,but nobody has written a comment.Nothing:no thanks,no reports of it working(or not),nothing!I have other torrents to upload,so I've stopped seeding this;please reseed."
,irgendwo,2007-03-08T22:52Z,thank you so much!!I've been looking for this game for a week already!!
,Delichris,2007-03-14T15:35Z,"Extract both files from the rar.
You need software which can handle the files,like Imgburn.Download and install it.
http://www.imgburn.com
Go to Mode>Write,then choose your image file(the .Mds one,but both must be in the same folder)
Then burn it to a DVD,preferably at slow speed.
*Important note*:You must have a mod-chipped
PS2 to play such a copy(or something else that bypasses protection)."
