,Valstein00,2009-03-25T23:29Z,"I have no problem with converting FLAC to mp3.

The quality of the music was fantastic, and it was organized perfectly. Both albums are there in their entirety, and the songs do not skip or beep. Highly recommended."

,swolf21,2011-03-17T20:13Z,can we get some seeders from here onto another one that's already in mp3 format? it's the Hellsing TV OST post tht only has 1seeder and 1 leecher. i don't have enough computer smarts for conversions. and i'm frozen at 63.0% and i've been looking for these mp3's for a very long time like most of u =[
