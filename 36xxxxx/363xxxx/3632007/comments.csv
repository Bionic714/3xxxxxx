,WilkesBooth,2007-03-15T06:29Z,"I give up...A day and a half later and I actually dropped from 99.4% to 99.1%...If anyone cares, I dont think this torrent ever completes."
,gorbigxxx,2007-03-19T06:05Z,"stuck at 99.9%

,spookytorrent,2007-07-01T21:34Z,"can some kind person please seed this? I am stuck at 99.7%.

cheers guys!"
,thaibuddha,2008-02-14T17:15Z,"I guess as with the rest, I am stuck at 92% with any addition, it drops back again to that level.....can someone seed a bit so I can get the complete file, and then I will seed to a ratio of 4 at the very least...

,thaibuddha,2008-02-16T14:39Z,"Man, stuck at 99.7% for days again.....I previewed the file, and the quality seems to suck something fierce. Am I the only one to think this?? I mean, I got the Alice in Chains, which is fantastic quality, but this one seems edited, modified and terrible.

I am not sure if there is another version out there yet, but I may have to buy the DVD and rip it myself. What do you all think of the quality here??

All that being said, thanks for the upload...I hope I wasn't to unappreciative.

,Pweb,2008-07-11T04:17Z,IThanks!! I watched this broadcast in '92 on MTV and have been searching for it off and on for the last 15 years as all I have is a crappy VCR copy. This show is possibly one of the best PJ shows ever and the sound quality is amazing. Awesome upload - check this out it's worth the dload.

I Think So."
,FEYD934,2008-11-19T03:03Z,I used to have an old VHS tape of this that I wore out after watching it a hundred times!  Great set!  Thanks!!!
