,Noxway,2007-05-18T21:27Z,"heheheh.. totally agree.. whats the big fuzz.? I thoufgt this was ""revealing"" the makin of needles or adjusting the machine voltage or tips and tricks on the technique of tattooing... lol.. this is Bullshit.. here is a advise to you ppl wanting a tatto and cant be bothered to DL this crap...
Look for pictures on the wall.. not flash drawings PHOTOS!
They look good and the black lines dow\esnt float or are rough...and the rest of the pic looks good... then you might wanna do one.. if you see a rat passing over the door or the guy has ""special price for you""....RUN! 
If the guy smell the shop smell and the whole deal smells... well. if youre not a complete moron then i dont need to explain the rest...
Peace out from A Tattoo artist and Piercer."

,prfctlyunrml,2008-09-11T07:13Z,"In my experience from being an ink slinger myself, I honestly support books that help people get in touch with what they really want. I been tattooing for years, but still haven't got my own yet. Why? Because I want it to be meaningful, I have to live with it, I want it to be special. I encourage alot of that towards my customers, I mean sure I'll throw flash on someone if they want it. Or if they bring in something from a magazine, but I always do it questioningly. Of course the place I work at also refuses to tattoo drunks, anyway though over this I really recommend the tattoo encyclopedia, or tattoos 101. They are a lot more informative, though this one is ok. "
