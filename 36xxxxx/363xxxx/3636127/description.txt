Info2MIS v2.0.0B10 is free. It's the app's that I 
used to create the .MIS. It can also extract
information from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, 
amazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a few seconds with an episode on tv.com(find page)
and only 2 clicks for a movie from imdb.com(with picture)

MIS Info Video v2.5.0 is free (parental control, resume
playback, chapters...). Perfect if you want to block 
access to a 6 year to your movies(horror, action, pr0n).

It's a front end/player. but If you don't like the 
internal player, you can configure your own player.
