,ilzarro,2007-06-12T19:57Z,Hi! I bought a XC90 in 2003 and haven't updated the gps since..can i just install this package or do i have to go throught the previous ones (like 2004 and/or 2005)? Does anybody know? Many thanks!
,N_e_x_u_s_S_i_x,2007-08-15T13:01Z,"Just tried the Western Europe DVD in my XC70 '02 and did not work. ""DVD error, check disc or contact your Volvo Dealer"" error message followed. 

Think it could be something strange with my car's unit though, went and borrowed an original disc from Volvo today and it said the same thing, check disc or contact dealer. 

As soon as I punch in my original disc from '02 it starts immediately.... Any clues?"
,Furio65,2007-09-26T22:16Z,"@vuurvlinder
 For XC90 '03, works excellent!"

,beanbandit69,2007-11-06T20:23Z,"I've been looking everywhere (and downloading) just about everywhere for a RTI CDR that works with my Volvo C70 T5-99... I've even tried with the volvo dealers they suggested to not bother until sprint 2008 since the 2007 versions is bugged...

so does someone have 2006 (at least sweden) RTI on CD that works with a C70-99
???"
