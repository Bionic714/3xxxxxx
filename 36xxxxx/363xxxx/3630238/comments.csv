,NFLMAN,2008-06-16T17:16Z,"The film Searching for Bobby Fischer uses his name in the title despite the fact that it is about the life of Joshua Waitzkin (it was named Innocent Moves instead in Great Britain). The title refers to the search for Fischer's successor after his disappearance from competitive chess. In the book on which the film is based, the narrator/author actually looks for Fischer for a brief period and imagines what he would say to him if found.

Fischer is actually a more interesting character than the shmuck this movie is about. Often referred to as a madman by the professional liars that darken the tabloids, Fischer's statements were truths that are known only to the most intelligent of men. 

We will need to look for a movie about Bobby Fischer that was produced in a free society in order to find a movie about Bobby Fischer. "

,gentilguy,2011-03-06T07:49Z,"I downloaded chessmaster grandmaster edition in which Josh Waitzkin teaches chess through an extremely well elaborated tutorial.

In the pc program, he also analizes the game supposedly played at the end of the movie. The real game is way more intense than the skewer shown in the movie (which is, I think, an hypotetical endgame. Was this ever really played in a famous game?).

The movie is not about chess so much, you could replace chess by any other competition game and the story would make sense. Sadly, I think it has no interest."
