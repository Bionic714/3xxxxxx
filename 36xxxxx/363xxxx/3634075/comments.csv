,TARDISMan2008,2008-05-25T00:21Z,"Ok, does anyone know how to run this one? I extracted it and the computer says it's a WinRAR archive, even though the file extension is .iso. I tried mounting it using MagicDisc to no success. As a last resort, i ran the installation program, and then it told me it needed the CD when I ran the program. Help!"
,Avrosoft,2008-08-10T20:25Z,"Open with WinRar, extract the .ISO file to a new folder then open the .ISO file with MagicISO, then select all and extract to another folder. Close MagicISO and run the setup file. I have installed the program, but have not tried it yet. Good luck."

,XA-R01,2009-08-26T22:54Z,A version 2.0 of this program was released and distributed as a bonus disc with one of The Next Generation DVD season box sets at Best Buy. The upgrade replaced the 16-bit program with a new 32-bit version that uses QuickTime 4.0 or above. Windows NT-based users could move the program files and main font to the appropriate folders manually to bypass any issues with the installer not running correctly. The 32-bit upgrade also allowed the program to run on 64-bit architectures.
