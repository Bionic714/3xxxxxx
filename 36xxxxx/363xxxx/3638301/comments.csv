,Frood12,2007-03-15T04:26Z,"arsewipe (appropriate name), 

If you don't know what something is, then you probably aren't looking for it! Why be an asshole asking? Does this look like the TV Guide trying to guess what your pea-brain might like? Go pick your nose somewhere else, these torrents aren't here to try to entice you or encourage you to watch anything (although I suspect that Sesame Street would do you a lot of good). 

jackelle, you have the patience of a saint to post a quick summary.

kollll, once again, I thank you. I had my VCR programmed to record this but being the idiot that I am, I screwed it up and lost it. Thanks for giving me the second opportunity.

Eddie Izzard rules.
