unfortunately however some things do not work in fsx, are not specific for fsx.."
,DarkPilot,2007-03-07T00:07Z,"P.S.
For the moment shockwave productions, an upgrade does not expect totally to make them compatible. "

,bfifteenv,2009-04-11T22:51Z,"Thanks for the upload! I have a dog named Rusty!

When I try to install this, I get a message that says ""File corruption found in your FSX directory"" and then recommends I reinstall FSX.

I got this message a few days ago, I wiped my harddrive, reloaded FSX and Acceleration and I still get the same message today.

I tried mounting it, I tried burning it, I tried copying and pasting all the folders from the image into a folder on my harddrive. I always get the same message.

Anybody else run into this? Is there something else I need to do? I have a legit copy of FSX, other WoP stuff works with my setup???"
,monsmeg,2009-06-11T12:08Z,thanks for the download. i used virtual daemon manager to instal into fsx ok. now to fly some REAL aircraft!
