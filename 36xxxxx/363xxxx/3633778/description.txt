Add to your FSX hanger with this add-on. Wings of Power II includes three brand new WWII fighter aircraft built using Absolute Realism Technology: They are the legendary Supermarine Spitfire, the Messerschmitt Bf109 and the Mitsubishi A6M5 Zero. Also included are the famous P51D Mustang and P47D-20 Thunderbolt. Wings of Power II delivers the most advanced and faithful aircraft ever designed for Flight Simulator 2004/FSX

This is an ISO that contains the setup file for the add-ons. This is not a game rip from the FSX directory. Don\'t forget to go get the V1.2 update for the WWII fighters at http://shockwaveproductions.com?t=6280

I didn\'t know it the one from DarkPilot was for FS2004 only.
