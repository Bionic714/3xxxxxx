Seems to be working I even downloaded the Genuine Validation tool and it came back as a legit copy.

Who knows how long it will last, it did download updates from the site, so it seems that its ok."
,BlackCat944T,2007-03-02T23:49Z,"I saw spo70's screen shot.....

On the link that I put above, the screen shot is different....  Its a time stopper, so I think I will try this as well, just to see.

Good luck everyone :)"
,Messatsu,2007-03-02T23:55Z,"Used this in a Virtual Machine to test it out.  On a fresh install it allowed me to activate Windows and pass validation.  It seems to load something before Windows starts, like a bootloader of some kind, likely to trick Windows into thinking it's on OEM hardware when it's not.  

The only problem I ran into was that after the bootloader, it did not start Vista, but instead went to the Windows Boot Manager where I had to hit enter to start up.  

Outside of that glitch, this is an amazing achivement at bypassing this activation nonsense.  

Cheer to Clony for an awesome crack!"
,/jw,2007-03-03T00:17Z,"This Vista dialog was the funny part: 'Activating Windows...' (Progressbar running) -> 'Activation was succesful'
slmgr.vbs -dlv says: 'License status: Licenced'
Still licenced after reboot. Of course :)

Thank you! Impressive!

BTW1: I could not found the CurrentName.dat (and hence not delete the [number].sys). I had the original timestop crack running. Not sure about the version, but not the repacked stuff. I started the original timestop crack and clicked Uninstall. Worked fine too, no reboot required.

BTW2: I guess you have to be selective with automatic updates because MS will find out, and will try to fight it.

BTW2: Works on HP notebook"
,genenioo,2007-03-03T07:02Z,"Worked!  Amazing!  The only problem I had was that the loader (i paused it) took away one of my floppies (yes I still have a 5 1/4!).  It said original was 2 and current was 1.  anyway to fix this?

Thanks again!"

,Derice,2007-03-03T10:51Z,"I have succesfully apllied this crack (Vista Ultimate) in VMWare.
However the Vista Bootloader remains on the screen, so I have to press enter to continue booting Vista.
Does anyone else have this issue? 
Because I sometimes reboot my pc remotely, this can be a problem."
,mika5678,2007-03-03T11:56Z,"I have a 32bit, DuoCore Dell laptop. I did a clean install without product key per instructions provided. In the end, I got the message, ""software licensing service reporting that the license evaluation has failed."" Is this crack not for 32bit systems?"
,Derice,2007-03-03T11:58Z,"The issue I posted above, seems to be VMware releated.
Tested on Laptop and works perfectly!

Although when you have a CD/DVD in the drive while starting the machine, it can't find the vista bootloader."

,clony_patcher,2007-03-04T21:29Z,"Good news for us!
For x86 windows vista (32 bit) there is a new my crack that really activate your Vista.

NO Timerstopper
NO modify your Vista bootloader!

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3631799/Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator.4st.March-CLoNY

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY' 
you can install the new one with no problem without fresh installation.

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.1-CLoNY' or
'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.2' you can use Vista Manager Pro
to rebuilt the bootloader and than you can apply the new one.

Download the software:
http://www.vistabootpro.org

Guide:
In Vista Manager Pro select 'BootLoader', select 'Reinstall the original bootloader'
and then click 'Apply'.

For x64 Windows Vista (64bit) I suggest, for now, to continue to use
'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY'

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3618299/Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY

,MXNUT,2007-06-04T04:43Z,"Downloaded and followed the instructions and I had not a problem one... This activated first try and I downloaded updates from Windows Update with no problems.
 I registered here to tell CLoNY Great Job and Thank You. 

ONE Question:
  Since Im showing activated do I still need to run the newest crack after VistaBootPro fix?
 Ive had no trouble or errors so is it even necessary for me to fix what aint broken?

THIS TORRENT WORKS  GREAT WORK
 Thanks Again"
,satttire,2007-09-28T10:10Z,"does anyone now how does this bootloader emulates an oem machine?????

To all of you wanting to remove the bootloader its easy but then windows will deactivate again and since the timerstop does not work anymore with the recent microsoft updates tou might get the black screen for validation request. For all of you wanting to remove the loader no extra tool is required if you have the vista bootcd boot from it and select repair then select repair from a command prompt and in the command line windows type bootrec /fixmbr and bootrec /fixboot that showld to the trick the bootloader is off but vista no longer activated "
,LordKalvaire,2008-02-15T06:09Z,"Yes it works great for x64 ultimate, on my quadcore pc with nforce680i, Asus mobo...
But today i bought a new mobo, a IntelG31 chipset, Asus the brand too... for my new mid-range pc, dualcore.
I'm stuck on this kind of error (or terror?) after loader setup.cmd: (and it's in dos)

Booting 'vista'
