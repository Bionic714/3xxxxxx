Consider listening to this sitting at a lake, sun setting behind the trees,
geese flying over you're head, 7 degrees Celsius and a recording mp3 player
with FM on you're head and you know the circumstances under which this recording
was made.

Mostly English with a few dutch words by the DJ and Loreena!
