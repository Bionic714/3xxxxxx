,vuurvlinder,2007-03-09T22:10Z,"Wenn you insert (one of) the disc for the first time its takes some time to start (screen shows one moment please), then it will update the system (leave the key on contact!!!). Then drive......away :)
It can sometimes happen that at the start it will take about 2 min. for the disc to load, but the more RTI is used with the new disc the better it goes (it loads a part in its memory). Well, to all of you...good luck!"

,mariuszjg,2007-03-14T22:11Z,"I burned that with Nero 7 on Verbatim DVD+R DL 2.4x and it does not work! WHY?

vuurvlinder, what DVD writer have you used? What could go wrong?

Oh, and are you sure about your country list? Shouldn't be there Poland too?"
,vuurvlinder,2007-03-15T09:47Z,"Yep incl. Poland you're right. I used lite-on 1633 for burning, in Nero burn Image. Important is the year of production of your car, 2005 and later have a new dvd/rti player which plays the disc without any problem, older ones will be difficult. You have to write it as booktype/dvd-rom. Here is a site with howto (isn't easy!):http://club.cdfreaks.com/showpost.php?p=1341738&postcount=18"

Ik heb een Volvo S40 van juli 2002.
Kan ik dvd's afspelen op mijn systeem of moet ik iets anders zoeken?"
