,rhum_guardian,2007-03-10T17:02Z,"It is unfortunate that this version in a PAN & SCAN . IMDB in DVD details list both Pan & Scan and Widescreen with the same ASIn number.

Is this one of the discs that have 2 sides?. If so someone should upload the Widescreen version, please..."

,stelfy,2008-04-06T04:09Z,"good rip, audio and video 9/10, considering the fact it was made in the 60's.
the movie wasn't as good as i hoped, actually, but was still well worth watching."
