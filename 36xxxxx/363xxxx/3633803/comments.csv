,mungo75,2007-03-12T13:40Z,From the comment has there been no seed for several days?
,mungo75,2007-03-16T16:17Z,"Don't waste your time - seeder listed, but no activity for days. 

Bit of a bummer but c'est la vie."
,thematrixexpert,2007-09-28T20:27Z,"24 seeders, 33 leechers: this torrent is flooding"
,ignorance1977,2007-10-13T19:09Z,"Such a shame this show was cancelled.

,zero_inspiration,2008-01-02T20:51Z,"sweet. I found another torrent of this on mininova that was downloading at a pace like molasses. this one has fewer seeds, yet is downloading pretty quickly. I shall seed this for months after I get it, cause it's a kickass show, and I'll be dammed if I'm gonna pay FOX for it when FOX deliberately tried to kill it. Fucking Rupert Murdock..."
,TehCr4zy,2008-02-05T04:56Z,Support Firefly! Download the Series and buy the series at Target for 25$ and Serenity Collector's Edition at Best Buy for 20$!!

,Patrick43809,2008-04-30T21:30Z,"I became hooked onto this series from this download, I am now going to support them by buying the DVD, this is a great series and there is a few efforts trying to get Serenity 2 or another network to pick up the series, great series please support by at least joining the petitions!! :D"
,Glitterspell,2008-08-02T07:10Z,Oh boy oh boy oh boy I love this show I own the dvd but hey can't beat being able to watch it on your computer thanks for this awesome upload!!!!
,napalm22,2008-08-03T21:45Z,"There will never be a return of firefly

Can you imagine the show without Wash?"
,juckum2,2008-09-30T16:41Z,"Best series ever. Totally out of the ordinary. You'll want to see the film right after too.

Also the first episode, Serenity, is not the same file as the movie, even though it is feature size (barely..)."
,icelaw,2008-12-28T13:06Z,"TehCr4zy: The show is cancelled, so when you buy the series, you just giving the tv companys more money..."
,TeamPlayer,2009-05-18T23:44Z,Now that FOX has canceled T:SCC it's important to seed this for fans of Summer Glau. (River Tam)
,rc71,2009-07-24T19:57Z," napalm22 at 2008-08-03 21:45 CET:
There will never be a return of firefly.

You forget the time between the end of the series and the movie.  They could squeeze a season or two in there.    (They were written in comic form)

Just wishful thinking."
,FRivera,2010-10-10T17:24Z,dammit how about one of you actually comment on the torrent's quality
,FRivera,2010-10-11T20:20Z,btw napalm22 u'r right why'd they have to kill wash??
,Ninjamoose,2010-11-06T14:23Z,"@FRivera

Because he was the best :( my biggest annoyance is that his death was so unfair, just landed the ship and he gets a harpoon through the heart -.-

Great series, I've got it for DVD but cba to rip all the episode off!"
,AlmightyFail,2011-01-19T23:27Z,how is the quality of this?

,x.l,2011-06-22T15:50Z,"ty for this 

great d/l "
,serosis,2011-09-08T10:35Z,"How can it be a ""prequel"" if chronologically it was released before the film?

1. A work (as a novel or a play) whose story precedes that of an earlier work 

2. A literary, dramatic, or cinematic work whose narrative takes place before that of a preexisting work or a sequel.

3. A film or book about an earlier stage of a story or a character's life, released because the later part of it has already been successful

3 different definitions from 3 different sources that all mean the same thing. 

I think I've made my point, thanks for the upload."
