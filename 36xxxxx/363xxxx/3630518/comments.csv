,ClaudiuS51,2007-03-02T22:10Z,Does the 6th dvd have nordic subs? None of earlier releases had.
,arnold1965,2007-03-02T22:51Z,"ClaudiuS51:

No, disc 6 is the whole making of the movie, cast and directors points and of course the memories of the ex Easy Company soldiers views. There are only English subtitles for that disc. The series it self has nordic subtitles."

,aphexfreak,2007-03-03T13:40Z,How big are the episodes? Are they burnable on a normal 4.7 g dvd?
,arnold1965,2007-03-03T15:18Z,"aphexfreak:

2 episodes on each disc from disc 1 to disc 5. The 6th disc is the making of the movie.
Each disc is about 4.4g, DVDR so the answer is yes! 6 disc = 6 burnable DVDs"

,white_fox,2007-03-26T22:34Z,"title:arnold1965 a sad truth
****************************************
you want to know a sad little fact about arnold1965 
he only uploads these movie so he gets attention because he has no friends in duetchsland he craves the little thx for the upload crap. if you didnt tell him this he would probably kill himself so talk to him and make the poor guy feel wanted also he spams people and takes there 40 dollars with clickbank affiliate programs.
arnold1965 i want my 40 dollars back id rather donate than give it to you, you loser.
arnold1965 please stop spamming tpb just upload the movies and give proper cred to the original release you stole this from and made your own. teafortwo,sisco etc. 
arnold if you need some friends join a sports team or something and get off your lazy ass clicking buttons on your pc and spend some time with real people.
instead of your ""e-friends""

torrents for a difference "
,cherrybabe,2007-03-26T23:05Z,"SERIOUSLY PEOPLE. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO NOTIFY TPB ABOUT THESE 2 white_fox  & jroc261. WE COME TO TPB TO DOWNLOAD MOVIES, MUSIC AND GAMES BUT WHY SHOULD UPLOADERS LIKE ARNOLD1965 BE HASSLED?
NO UPLOADER SHOULD BE HASSLED AT ALL.

PLEASE EVERYBODY - SEND A MESSAGE TO TPB AND HAVE THESE IDIOTS BANNED FROM TPB.

THIS HASSLING/HARRASING HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH AND I'M SURE SICK OF IT.
JUST LET US DOWNLOAD IN PEACE AND THE UPLOADER LEFT ALONE.

THOSE WHO HAVE UPLOADED ARNOLD1965 MOVIES AND HAVE APPRECIATED THEM COULD DO HIM A FAVOUR BY HELP STOPPING THESE IDIOTS."

,trikky,2007-10-28T02:39Z,"Obviously not HD quality, but the video quality is pretty darn good and well worth the download time.  I have tested all the disks and they work fine, are set for regions 1-6 and play very nicely.

Just remember, folks - it's PAL - so i your DVD player can't play PAL, either get yourself a player that CAN run PAL, or don't waste your time DLing these.  Oh...if you don't know what PAL is, you may wanna go to Google.

Thanks for this one."
