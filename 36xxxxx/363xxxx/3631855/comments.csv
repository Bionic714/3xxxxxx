,razzell2,2009-03-27T15:53Z,"wait a minute...the last 3 tracks are missing. 
most of 18, all of 19, and 20.. 
im sure i downloaded the entire thing, and put it on a cd..(before i played them on my puter), and now i see the end tracks are missing. 
im gonna have to go get this again somewhere else.
pretty sure i downloaded all data, and even seeded for 3 or 4 hours."
,razzell2,2009-03-27T15:55Z,"....oh yeah....i go to my player right now on my computer and i can see that the last 3 tracks are missing all of the data.  in other words, track 1, for example, has 5 mb of data, track 20, a few kilobytes.
so the last songs are missing."
