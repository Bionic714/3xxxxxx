Stereopast is a band from Fontana, CA. This is a gig that the played in a venue aptly named ?The Gig? in Hollywood. The event is to commemorate the release of their CD entitled ?Life Finds A way?. I cannot remember the date of the gig. The video is a little over an hour. For more info on Stereopast you can visit their myspace page, www.myspace.com/stereopast or stereopast.com.
