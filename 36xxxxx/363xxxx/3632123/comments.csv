,stevoGDF,2010-02-12T17:42Z,"They should have never got rid of Scott. Don't get me wrong. Travis Barker is cool and all but poor Scott dropped out of the band to get his High School Diploma and I bet he regrets that choice quite often. Anyways, you gotta love the M+M's video back before Travis and such. Cheshire Cat was their first CD and probably their best. Not many sales but I didn't like the transition they made from playing at college parties to big venues with thousands of people. I'm happy for them and all I just want my old Blink 182 back! :( "
