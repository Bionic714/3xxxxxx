hope it don't need to introduce...

torrent includes patch to connect to the net without steam, I tried it, and it works!!
but only on servers, which names contains ""no-cd, no steam, etc""
torrent doesn't include bots


installation: run the exe, it'll install everything you need, but if you want to play online, you have to install the ""1.6 Patch v21"" too. 
BTW, if it asks for a cd-key, it's 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA with caps (it's important to be big letters) it'll be it	


(hope you understand it, sorry for the grammar)	"
