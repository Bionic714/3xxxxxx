Update: February 28th, 2007:Spanish fly:Paola Rey

We try to scope out our next spanish fly at a park our man billy knew about a while back and to our surprise, sweet Paola Rey was coming up on us. We lay the rap to her and she decides to head back with us and check it out. Soon as we get there, paola wants billy real bad and the action begins!
