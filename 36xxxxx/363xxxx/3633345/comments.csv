If you need English subs, try here:
http://subscene.com/tess/subtitles-35510.aspx
Tess.1979.DVDRip.XviD-UnSeeN (Tess.1979.DVDRip.XviD-UnSeeN )
and adjust time with subrip: 1st part -15,250s
2nd part -1h22mn50,081s"

You have to consider this when you compare runtimes."
,shiningwiz,2010-06-05T13:11Z,"A better set of Eng subtitles are here: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3148370/tess-en

No need to adjust the time or anything like that. Works perfectly fine."
