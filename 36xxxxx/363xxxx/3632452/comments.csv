,bobaah,2007-03-05T15:44Z,probably 20ish so they can reach earth. too bad some of the episodes in s2 are quite boring compared to the ones in s1.

,xirr,2007-03-06T10:36Z,"Don't worry, they won't reach Earth anytime soon. This is just season 3, there will be season 4 and a TV-movie on top of that. So everything's all right :)."
