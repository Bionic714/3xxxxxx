,neslesman,2007-03-06T23:50Z,"I just bought this yesterday.  Since I got the FS9 version here at PTB I thought it fair that I buy the FSX one now that I've tested the product and found it to be one of my favourite aircraft add ons.  It's a great aircraft and an excellent FS9 model.  
9.317/10

If only FSX could work so well.

Nice upload rusty."

,paladin9,2007-03-07T17:40Z,I do not have a path 1. go to C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp. Once downloaded I only have the installer and crack. Can anyone help
,Sangeki,2007-03-07T18:58Z,"Start the installer and then follow the readme... it's pretty simple really.

Just make sure that you have set explorer to show hidden files and folders and to actually substitute ""Username"" with your user name."
