Good Charlotte is back with their 4th studio album, GOOD 
MORNING REVIVAL.

Returning to work with producer Don Gilmore (Pearl Jam, 
Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne)-- who helmed Good Charlotte's 
eponymous 2000 breakthrough debut--was the decisive change 
that reinvigorated the band. After a pair of successful 
albums like 2002's tremendously popular triple platinum The 
Young and the Hopeless and 2004's subsequent million-selling 
follow-up The Chronicles of Life and Death (which were 
realized with producer Eric Valentine), GC singer Joel Madden 
says its modus operandi on GOOD MORNING REVIVAL (Epic/Daylight) 
was simply to "make a record that we loved and that felt good." 
The first monster single is "The River" a collaboration with M. 
Shadows & Synyster Gates.

Deluxe edition with two bonus tracks. Enjoy.
