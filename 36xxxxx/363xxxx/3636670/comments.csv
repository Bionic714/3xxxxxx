A)  All you morons, go take some fuckin reading lessons.  B) while your at it, learn to STFU until you know what your talking about so you  C) don't make yourself look really, really, really, retarded."

No, it is not the low budget B-movie transmorphers.
No, it is not the new transformers movie.

It is the 1986 original animated Transformers movie. There is an IMDB link right there for fucks sake. Why are you complaining?

Bloody retards.
"
,headphone inc.,2007-07-06T19:13Z,"this is a really nice movie,it take me back to the 80s when they showed the cartoon series,one complaint thoug is the music all the time,its giving me a headache,but really nice movie"
,fatrotti,2007-07-06T22:04Z,"Interesting, haven't looked at this site since I uploaded the movie 4 months ago...In case some of you don't get it, and by the comments you don't, this is the old Cartoon Movie from the '80s, great quality, great movie.  This is not:

THE MICHAEL BAY MOVIE
THE SHITTY TRANSMORPHERS MOVIE

I never proclaimed it to be.

Enjoy!"
,Drac0nis,2007-07-07T02:32Z,"Fatrotti, Thanks for the GREAT upload, One of the great cartoon movie classics. Fan-fucking-tastic.

Thanks again Fatrotti and ALL you seeders out there."
,bhines5,2007-07-08T03:09Z,"Excellent download. If you are looking for the Mike Bay flick, this is not it. You have to be a moron to think that it is. This is as described the 1986 classic."

,Kenny90,2007-07-27T21:47Z,"Verbato! Ever thought of this?: They are called Transformers because they can take other forms, and TRANSFORM themselves between robot and vehicle form.... Idiot..."
,frozen_dude,2007-08-09T03:34Z,"@Verbato
Transform (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transform)
1. to change greatly the appearance or form of
2. to change the nature, condition or function of
...
So in effect Transformers would be synonymous to ""Those who change their appearance, form, nature or function""."
,Tiseye,2008-02-12T21:09Z,"Not transformer in the electrical sense, but in the physical.... transform from a car to a robot, plane to robot, tape player to robot, gun to robot.. etc.  "
