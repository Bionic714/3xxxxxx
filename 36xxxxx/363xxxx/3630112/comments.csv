...first to keep it ""simple"" i'm talking bits here, so keep in mind to check 129 bits of keys takes twice as long as to check for 128 bits of keys - and 128 bit in an encryption is more than anyone would need (if the thing has to hold for less than 20 years).

m$ with their 25 character key has an insane amount of possibility, roughly 167 bits. taken they would (_verry_ optimistically) need a maximum of 100 billion (for each person on earth about 15) and one would spread those keys randomly throughout the 167 bits of keyspace, one would have to check roughly 131 bits of keys to stumble just over one.

and to make things even worse with this one can check and change only about 5 keys a second which leeds to about 1,1e+31 years (this is a 1 with 31! zeros, and yes _yeares_ ..) to find just one key, and that would just be impossible.

so if right now people actually do find valid keys, vista does accept _insanely_ more keys than m$ would ever dream to be needing.

possible countermeasures on the side of m$ would be just to narrow the valid keyspace a little (since they do know the keys they sold, this is no problem what so ever - softwarecompanys do it all the time) so vista actually would accept a key, but the activation- or update server wouldn't. after 10 bad tries to activate with a key the os had first accepted probably most ""keyserchers"" would just give up.

bottom line: it's a nice idea and right now it probably will work, but if too many people will use this m$ will just narrow the valid keyspace a little on their servers and the whole thing will be over (it would then just take an insane amount of time to find a valid key that is not just accepted by vista but also by the m$ activation or update servers.)

if you guys find a key that works, enjoy as long as it lasts (if you don't use updates it will most likely last forever as long as you don't reinstall) but keep in mind m$ has the possibility to pull the plug (and then you most likely have to reinstall and use timestopers or keys again) "
