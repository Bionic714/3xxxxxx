,CaptMidnight,2007-03-12T10:18Z,"cant believe you missed ""garbage - wild horses"" its a damn fine cover by the sweetness of shirley manson"
,A Murder of Crows,2007-03-13T23:21Z,"Just to let you know...the credit for ""Another Brick In The Wall"" given to Marilyn Manson is wrong.  That song was done by a 1-time ""SuperGroup"" called ""Class of '99"" featuring Layne Staley (Alice In Chains) and Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine)

There are quite a few missing covers here actually, but this is a pretty nice jump-start to any covers collection.

I see that there is only 1 cover by Pearl Jam....a band that covers The Who all the time, and even released at least 2 singles that were covers (""Last Kiss"" being the more famous one i believe)

Nirvana did several excellent in-studio covers, including D-7 (greg sage and the wipers), Here She Comes Now (The Velvet Underground), Love Buzz (Shociking Blue) and several songs from the Unplugged Album (Lake of Fire, Oh Me, Plateau, all from the Meat Puppets, and Jesus Doesn't want me for a Sunbeam from the Vaselines)

KMFDM did covers of so many songs it's ridiculous.  Highlights would be ""Mysterious Ways"" (U2), ""These Boots Were made for walking"" (Nancy Sinatra), and ""Like A Prayer"" (Madonna).

Front Line Assembly and the singer known as Tiffany got together for a cover of U2's ""New Year's Day"" that is INCREDIBLY well done.

Hope to see these in the next one"
,cypherchaos,2007-03-29T03:57Z,"KMFDM did not cover Sunday Bloody Sunday, that is Aesthetic Perfection. Cheers!"
,Micahan,2007-03-30T18:55Z,"This is a dream come true!! I LOVE covers, but I havn't yet collected. This is a fantastic start on my collection. 

It's nice with lists. I've seen one called ""100 greatest guitar solos"" several times. And each of them are different. Ain't file sharing great  :-)"
,TheBrandon,2007-04-02T05:22Z,"""KMFDM did covers of so many songs it's ridiculous. Highlights would be ""Mysterious Ways"" (U2), ""These Boots Were made for walking"" (Nancy Sinatra), and ""Like A Prayer"" (Madonna).""

One that most people miss is a cover of ""Bang A Gong."" Most people skip over it because it isn't titled that on the KMFDM version; they labeled it ""Get It"" on their 84-86 album.

Also Hilding6125 this is a great idea. I registered for this site just to contribute to this project.

,pdxpirate,2008-08-14T08:41Z,"So #496 is mislabeled as Weezer covering up town girl. But it's really Me First and The Gimme Gimmes.

And with #61 David Bowie wrote China Girl for Iggy Pop is its not really a cover."
,ritagonc,2008-09-10T10:57Z,"Check out rolling stones mag, they just did an article on the best 100 cover songs, and they know their stuff.. follow their expert advice and include Jeff Buckley singing Cohen's Aleluia... 

And please include my personal fave cover of the last two years, Grizzly Bear singing ""He hit me (and it felt like a kiss)"" by The Crystals.

Anyway, it all depends on your taste... 
A very cool initiative, congrats!

Maybe u should create a blog where people get to input ideas and vote... that would be cool... let me know if you do it! :)"
