Battlefield Earth is a totally new musical sound that is possible only because the instrument of the future is here today?the Computer Musical Instrument (CMI).

Where other artists have ended with electronic music, L. Ron Hubbard has begun.

The concept of a soundtrack is something one normally associates with motion pictures. Now for the first time ever?a musical soundtrack for a book?BATTLEFIELD EARTH. ?Think of the ?Star Wars? sagas, and Raiders of the Lost Ark: mix in the triumph of ?Rocky I,? ?Rocky II,? and ?Rocky III,? and you have captured the exuberance, style and glory of BATTLEFIELD EARTH.??The Evening Sun, Baltimore, MD.

Consider the magnitude of the challenge Hubbard set himself. Conventional musical instruments and even huge symphony orchestras have their limitations. He turned to the technology of the future?computers.

Recent breakthroughs in computer musical instruments offered the needed versatility to match his new musical concepts.

Today, a computer is able to reproduce any natural sound. It can record a single note of a musical instrument and from that reproduce the rest of the instrument..

But better yet. It can take any sound and turn this into a melody or rhythm. A coyote can sing the blues. A horse can tap dance. Liquid can splash out a Strauss waltz. Laser beams can hum a lullaby. You name it and you can get it.

Sounds can be blended, invented and composed in a scope possible only with a computer, and Hubbard has applied his awesome ingenuity to the state-of-the-art computer technology in creating a new, exciting musical style and sound. Literally, the sound of the future.

Music is perhaps our most cherished form of communication. Nothing communicates better than the familiar and nothing is more familiar than natural sound. In the case of this album, the composer has achieved new heights of artistry on the firm foundation of the natural and the familiar.

So there is something new under the laser beam, and you can?t afford not to experience it, for it has set the trend of our music for decades to come.

L. Ron Hubbard?s Battlefield Earth

Golden Era of Sci Fi
A salute to the genre of Science Fiction and its Golden Era. It recaptures the flavor of those early days with a futuristic flair.

Funeral for a Planet
Poor Earth. Her children are no more, destroyed. And she?s alone, weeping, helpless. Who would do such a thing to her? Sing the blues for poor Earth.

March of the Psychlos
Evil incarnate! A gigantic race of the alien monsters, Psychlos, has crushed the life from the planet and ransacks her broken body for gold and other minerals. What?s left of humanity is withering away in slavery. Psychlos derive their pleasure from inflicting suffering and death on humans.

Terl, The Security Director
Meet Terl, the alien Psychlo. The worst of a very, very bad lot. Terl has ambitions quite beyond brutalizing humans for pleasure. His masters, back an the home planet Psychlo, had better not discover his Plans.

Jonnie
Someone had to make it his job to rid Earth of the Psychlos. The task had gone begging for 1,000 years. Then one day Jonnie Goodboy Tyler ventures down onto the plains from his mountain encampment and falls prey to the Psychlos and their evil ways. It is then that Jonnie realizes the job is his.

Windsplitter
Communication between different life forms is possible in ways the evil will never understand. Jonnie and his horse, Windsplitter, are fast friends. Always there when needed, Windsplitter carries Jonnie through one harrowing adventure after another.

Mining Song
Gold or slavery. If you don?t acquire the one, you?re sure to get the other. Harsh facts of life on Earth under Psychlo domination. What underlies Terl?s obsession for gold...?

The Drone
The drone is the killing machine that keeps Earth in the Psychlos? deathgrip. Clean, efficient, invincible. The deadly drone?s gas cannisters annihilate all life.

Mankind Unites
What might Mankind accomplish if it were truly united? Why, it might muster enough strength to throw off Psychlo oppression. Indeed, the capabilities of a united Mankind might be unlimited!

Alien Visitors Attack
When love and understanding fail, races everywhere seek their measure of solace in the whore called War. Be forewarned, in a Space Opera society, her prices might be higher than you bargained for. Who panders for her?

The Banker
Got a score to settle? Here?s your man. He?ll bankroll you for whatever you want. Of course, the other side needs money too. Don?t talk to the Banker about right and wrong. His business is credits and dimes. It costs money to fight a war.

Declaration of Peace
Jonnie?s worthy mission ends in triumph. The Psychlos are vanquished. Peace reigns. Earth has a rebirth, another chance. This time to live in peace.

Earth, My Beautiful Home
Earth, now green and growing, has seen the end of Psychlo oppression. What a beautiful home! Thank you, Jonnie, thank you!
