Why this name?
I just heard it during a poker game. The ace was the last thing to beat a hand. Its the highest card in the deck, right next to the joker. Kid was like \"Eww, he wins with fatal Aces

Its over when you hear my beats. Hip Hop needs me. Emcees need me.

i had a crew MidtownTrinity. We performed, as a group twice.

Now the DJ is married in Minn. \"Hieronymous Crotch\"

How, do you think, does the internet (or mp3) change the music industry?
It has given artist like us freedom to create and let the world hear our music. Plus I hear music, I may have never heard before. Exposure in a word. It also keeps big time records b.s. companies in a continuous legal run.

Would you sign a record contract with a major label?
If the contract was full of integrity.
