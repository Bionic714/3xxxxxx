Death to Windows! Long live Linux!"
,mike123,2007-03-08T14:16Z,"lol, I'm not so sure about that, but most good honest 'open source' software does.

Windows, especially Vista, is simply the biggest piece of spyware/malware available! Not only that, but is is probably the only O.S. ever conceived that is actually designed to shoot its user in the foot if the user ever does anything the Hollywood moguls don't approve of. 
Digital Right is the biggest mistake Microsoft has ever subscribed to, and it will be their undoing!

People are fed up with these monopoly men!

I can do without a game or two to know that I am  not a sucker (read; Lemming)"
,Gbriel,2007-03-08T17:06Z,Nice. Seems to be a 60 days demo. Per Pixel function turned off. Tested on XP.
,skowfritt,2007-03-08T21:47Z,"It works with vista alright and I have a terrific aero glass skin BUT it says that per pixel alpha blending is disabled. Now, how to crack this thing???"
,mike123,2007-03-09T11:51Z,"With a brick? A sledgehammer? A garbage compactor, Chisel? Blowtorch, fall from a tall building with lead weights attached?

Last option is all of the above at the same time!

Good luck, Lemmings"
,skowfritt,2007-03-10T00:51Z,"mike123, how long would it take us all to familiarize ourselves with linux? Most ppl use windows."
,mike123,2007-03-10T06:02Z,"Yes, you are right. Unfortunately very few people understand the implications of DRM and the impact it will have on the computing industry as a whole.

Everyone from software writers to hardware manufacturers will have to approach Microsoft on bended knee, and ask for certification. In return they will have to guarantee that their products will not function with operating systems not issued by Microsoft.

This stinks, and potentially not only change the way we compute, but also the way our children do. Everyone will be living in Microsoft land. The whole show will be stitched-up. Well, that is the way I see it anyway, and I'm sure it is exactly what Microsoft has in mind.

The only way to avoid this is if there is a mass migration away from MS products, and Microsoft then realise the error in their ways (or go out of business).

I'm not joking! This is a very serious issue. Anyone even slightly concerned about it should download and try using one of the many 'Live' Linux distros which are free. Just burn one of these images to CD and boot it. They do not install ANYTHING to your hard drive, and they give you the chance to taste Linux without actually installing it.

Some of these distros, notably Mepis, give you a very simple HD installation option, should you decide to accept it. Yeah, you need to create a couple of extra partitions (use Hirens boot CD - also free), but most of us know how to do that, don't we? From then on it is a piece of cake! Really!

How many people really know what goes on inside Windows, and the full extent of the personal data it transmits back to MS and other agencies? Not many. That is because it is 'closed source'. The program code is almost impossible to inspect. Linux, on the other hand is 'open source' and all code and all functions are open to scrutiny.

Sorry for troubling you folks, but this really is a serious issue.

Cheers"

,walnutlead,2007-03-10T19:52Z,"m123 is right. microsoft is creatin dread monopoly. DMR Digital Media Rights is surely biggest mistake of them ever. i also know hardly a good per cent of ppl understand these details about DMR n all but we have to understand piracy is beating the shit otta all content providers be it softwares or movies or music. since we pirates cant stop so we cant help but. beyond that Vista is undoubtedly good... not much space to talk about it here.

------------------------

well leave those wil someone help me get this wretched Windows Blind 5.5 activated! We have to get hold of the enhanced pack. and also get around activation process. a short exe crack for this demo wil also do.
i am trying but with no luck!
Thanks"
,mike123,2007-03-11T01:45Z,"With all due respect, get a brain, get a life, and get a Linux disk, Mr Nutty.
It is not rocket science!"
,jizac2,2007-03-12T01:38Z,"This torrent is spam, 60 day demo who the frack wants it... downloaded 545 times surprise surprise not the rels y'all figured it be.

Yup live discs are an easy way to try linux."
,Bardal,2007-05-04T02:03Z,"I dont really get what some people got against Windows.
Sure, there can be some trouble.
but I have tried many Unix versions as well as Windows from 3.11 to Vista.
Using Vista Home Premium at the moment.
Its not free.. so?
Its worth it, every penny.
As long as you buy it as OEM :)

Vista is good and since I'm a gamer myself.
Going from XP to Vista gave me 10 more fps in World of Warcraft.

Long live Windows Vista :)"
,-PurpleHaze-,2007-05-17T03:11Z,"Mike are you dumb or just fucking retarded you go in a software section for products that really have nothing to do with microsoft just to flame on the big M$.

 Its true Linux has some major improvements over windows but I for one like playing games and you yourself probably have a dual boot of windows so you can play games as well so quit being a fucking hippocrate. 

Until Linux starts getting games besides the crap they keep coming out with I will continue to use windows as well as Linux. So get a life or start making some impressive games for Linux otherwise STFU."
,skofdoggy,2007-09-26T02:11Z,"Hmm yer true F^*$ you and your LINUX!!!
It shows you are a noob! If microsoft is overtaking linux at lightning speeds then there must be something shit about it. Maybe the whole operating system works, maybe because it has such lame software, baybe because you can't play any of the deacent games!!! And don't start telling me about the 2d linux affects because eaven xp has it now... So really get a life... Vista shits all over it, hell im using home premium right now!"
,ezboard,2009-02-27T11:50Z,is it cracked? does it come with a keygen or something?
,lex81086,2009-08-27T00:02Z,"can somebody seed, please?"
