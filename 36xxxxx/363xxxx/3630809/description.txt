Whether it's the adventures of Greek gods and goddesses or Norse trickster tales, we all love to hear a good story. Kenneth C. Davis gives readers a taste of the diverse myths that live on in the cultures and religions around the world today. In his trademark question-and-answer style, peppered with entertaining sidebars and quotes, he also shows how almost every civilization's mythology shares common themes. A wealth of photographs and art reproductions, along with clever black-and-white illustrations by Sergio Ruzzier, helps convey mythology's lasting vitality. This is the perfect young companion to Don't Know Much About┬« Mythology -- and other titles in Davis's best-selling Don't Know Much About┬« series.
