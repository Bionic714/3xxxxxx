,jeepmansro,2008-07-01T02:42Z,"This is great thanks allot! They only have one other album that I know of, 'Growing out of it' (2000). I cant find it either though. HOWEVER I am very grateful for these 2!! THANKS AGAIN!"
,nimboo,2008-11-05T22:46Z,"Any way you can upload the Red Tape Outtakes, How to Get Out Alive, or even their older stuff?

I had the two newer ones but I can't find the discs anywhere :("
,clittle,2009-12-04T01:08Z,"Wow - begging for a thanks, are we? Well, thanks for trying, but Throwing The Game is put together terribly. It has pieces from Growing Out Of It for tracks 2 and 6 which break up the way songs go together (listen to the end of track 1 going into track 2 - doesn't go together).

I would recommend downloading this torrent, as at least the Throwing The Game album is correct http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4269878/Lucky_Boys_Confusion_Discography"
