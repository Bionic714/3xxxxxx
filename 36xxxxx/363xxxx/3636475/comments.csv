At first I tought it could be a problem of conversion to MPEG2. I do not watch movies on PC.
I always convert to standandard DVD using Nero Vision, DVD Decrypter and DVD Lab Pro. I also have another suite of programs that achieve the same final result: a standard DVD with subtitles.

In this movie I used both and both have the same problem: The dialogue is some 4 minutes ahead of  the picture and the subtitles display synchonized with the dialogue.

I just went to the PC and played the Xvid original with Nero Showtime, after adding the subtitle from the English folder (separate.tables.1958.dual.commentary.dvdrip.xvid-javaopera).

The result is the same. The sound is ahead of the image , even if you play the AVI and do not add subtitles. This applies to Nero Showtime.

I just tried playing it with VLC Player. Surprisingly it works well. But VLC does not provide a feature to convert to Standard DVD (MPEG2).

This type of behaviour is caracteristic of UNIX and Apple. 

It pisses off the majority of users, and should be documented...

I do not like to be dependent on Bill Gates, but the alternatives are much worse. 
UNIX, Apple Mac OS will disappear. Linux may survive if IBM keeps backing it, but only in the Enterprise marketplace.

In the mainframe era there were many operating systems better than IBM's. But they did not have a large enough user base and were wipped out.. There is nothing new in this world..."
