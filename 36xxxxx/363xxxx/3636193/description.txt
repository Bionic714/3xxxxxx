\"the big brother state is an educational film about what politicians 
claim to be protection of our freedom, but what we refer to as 
repressive legislation                                             

since terrorism has become a global threat, especially after 9/11, 
governments all over the world have started enforcing laws which, so the 
governments say, should increase national security

these laws obviously aim at another goal:
the states gaining more and more control of their citizens at the cost  
of our privacy and freedom\"
