                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was in the lovely picturesque city of Prague in the Czech Republic with my brother
and we were enjoying the lovely culture. We took a walk across Charles Bridge and
saw this Jazz band playing there and it blew me away.

Such a fantastic culture so the music is fitting!

These guys do not make much money at all, so if you are ever in Prague and see
these guys on Charles Bridge, do them a favour and buy one of their CD's like I did!

Covers are also included, scanned at the correct size @ 600 DPI so they look nice ;O)


Enjoy the Release... all virus scanned and 100% safe, as are all my releases!


Enjoy & please seed to 1:1 or it kills the community, god damn leeches....


HAPPY

;O)
