English subtitles for the movie Gedo Senki. Translated from the russian version of the subtitles using P7 PROMT translation software. No further editing has been done, resulting in subtitles that will let you know what's going on (barely), but little beyond that in quality. Names tend to have been translated as a series of question marks. If you want to enjoy this movie as fully as possible, you should not download these subtitles, but rather wait for better ones. You have been warned. If you're like me and want to watch it as soon as possible and maintain some semblance of understanding what's going on, you could give them a try.

Since most of the meaning is preserved (even if the sentence structure is rather weird), it should be possible to use these subtitles as a base to create more comprehensive ones, by rewriting sentences and adding words where question marks are present. Anyone wishing to do so can go right ahead. Oh, and I find it useful to mentally translate "Keep" (frequently used) to "Pull yourself together" when watching.

On a final note, all credit for this translation goes to the original russian translators, and the writers of the P7 PROMT translation software. The russian subtitles are hosted on animezone.ru

This is my first attempt at making a torrent. If I did something incorrectly, leave me a comment and I'll try to correct it.
