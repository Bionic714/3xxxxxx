,gwprod,2007-06-10T10:40Z,"This translation is so bad it's not even worth downloading...  I'm rewriting it, and while it won't be a direct translation, at least it may be worth checking out."

,TompsonLocal,2008-04-05T16:04Z,dude y is a proper english version so hard to get ahold of?
,LeaT,2008-07-12T16:34Z,"Yes it is, it seems. I can't find a good one. Found 2 English subs, both are so out of synch there is hardly any point using them... ie, the sentence they say come way seconds ahead before they actually say them. All it manages to do is to confuse you. I have no idea if you can set the speed of the subs somewhere by your own."
