,sandrew77,2007-03-05T16:10Z,ANY SUBS?
,FredCPA,2007-03-05T20:08Z,"THANKS!!

What is the source of this?  I'm not aware that it had been released on DVD.

Is this from a VHS copy?"
,barnabascollins,2007-03-05T22:27Z,"I used the VHS release as the source, I then ran it thru TMPEG and sharpened the image and fixed the colors. I then encoded it as a DVD with complete chapters and menus. I hope this will do until an actual DVD release is issued. ENJOY!!"
,FredCPA,2007-03-08T22:58Z,"Thanks for your efforts with the VHS transfer!

Yeah, I had thought that they hadn't gotten around to releasing this on DVD yet!

Cheers"
