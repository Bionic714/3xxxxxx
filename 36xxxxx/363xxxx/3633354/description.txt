Lose All Time is the sophomore album from Vancouver?s demented post-whatever
freak-popsters You Say Party! We Say Die! and the first for their new label
Paper Bag Records who will release it on April 10th, 2007. The album is a
brilliant, spastic celebration of hyperactive outbursts and meditative moments.
Like Lose All Time?s concept, the bubbling joy of this music strives to touch
something unrestrained by time.

You Say Party! We Say Die! members are: Becky Ninkovic (Vocals), Stephen O?Shea
(Bass), Krista Loewen (Keyboards), Devon Clifford (Drums) and Derek Adam
(Guitar)
