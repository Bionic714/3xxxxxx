Although this cd is a very brief offering lasting slightly more than half an hour, the songs on this album say so much more than some albums twice its length. The music is hard, with definite industrial roots. The best way to describe the sound of Society 1 is Industrial Heavy Metal.

Although their 1999 debut album \"Slacker Jesus\" could only be described as an Industrial-Nu-metal train wreck, \"Exit Through Fear\" sounds as though it was done by an entirely different band. That could partially be attributed to the fact that it was. The band went through several line-up changes before it was finally solidified with the current members.

The lyrics are about as uplifting as a suicide note, but at the same time are not melancholy. The lead singer Matt Zane, who prefers to be known as \"Lord Nexus\", is certainly not humble in any sense of the word. The lyrics seemingly drip with arrogance, but Lord Nexus has every right to be arrogant, because he is that good.

In ?Nothing? Lord Nexus goes from screaming the lyrics out, to wailing the line ?you can?t be what you want to be?. He has a commanding voice, and the transition from screaming to singing is very smooth.

On ?Hate? the lyrics are somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The background noises were irritating, and could make one feel rather uneasy. The vocals however made up for all of this. It takes songs like this to show his true talent.

?No One? is an ideal industrial-metal song. The lyrics are potent, and the music is compelling. ?Everyone Dies (rock stars don?t count)? is an interesting tribute to the relationship between rock stars and groupies that provides a unique view on the whole situation, although the lyrics are very misogynistic. It is one of the best tracks on the album, and most listeners will enjoy it.

On ?Me? the Lyrics are filled with arrogance, as Lord Nexus commands the listener to worship him. Although it is uncommon to hear someone make such a request, after listening to this song, it doesn?t exactly sound like a bad idea.

Overall, Exit Through Fear is a solid album. It is musically strong, blending strong guitar riffs with futuristic techno-industrial effects. Anyone who likes industrial metal would love it. While it may seem simplistic on the outside, it is not as it seems. It is a potent combination of industrial rock and thrash metal. Fans of many different genres of rock music would love it
