,exeoh,2007-12-23T11:04Z,"I've got this album, but didn't grab it from this torrent. Have uploaded it here for you guys and gals: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3945017

Don't be a tight arse - seed for a while after downloading it to help other's with their download. Recommended ratio of 2, please."
,mrszmotyi,2009-04-20T15:33Z,"Somebody seed please.

We're stuck at 99.6%. This way, there are glithes in the first track.

Thx in advance!"

,circlesmash,2010-05-03T21:04Z,Ahh that contradicted itself.  The file (song) is complete for seeding UNLIKE this current d/l of Basique that comes with this album torrent. 
,nichgreen,2011-03-10T02:49Z,"did everyone get stuck the same place as I - 99.6%?  For the love of Pete, please seed!"
,a_raccoon,2011-08-23T00:34Z,I just fixed this torrent with a grab from soulseek.  turned 42 leechers into 42 seeders.  seems that 01-Little People-Basique.mp3 had 4 missing pieces that prevented the torrent from completing.
,Dasher.X,2011-09-16T02:33Z,I absolutely love this album! Thanks!
,SamDog507,2011-11-28T01:24Z,I had no problems with the download or the audio quality. The album is awesome and I intend to seed for the next month.
