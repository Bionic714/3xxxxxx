LITTLE PEOPLE - MICKEY MOUSE OPERATION
======================================

Quirky and charming, as their name suggests, Little People inhabit the often earnest world of instrumental hip-hop, but instill it with a little fun and a dash of personality - being the nom-de-guerre of Anglo-Swiss producer Laurent Clerc.

The requisite beats are all in the right place, but it's their choice of samples and sheer musicality that makes them stand out. This release is the full 2006 album.

As always, if you like what you hear, you are urged to support the artist by buying the album (link in related links), any related merchandise or by going to gigs / live events.
