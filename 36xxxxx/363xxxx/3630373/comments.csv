,spirp,2007-05-02T20:00Z,"I downloaded the files, and tried opening them in dvddecrypter (also found here on piratebay), but it seems it can only rip dvds, not burn them?

instead I tried burning the image with alcohol 120% and with magiciso maker, which seemed to work perfectly, until I tried the disks in my car (C-class, 2005, Comand 100), but comand complains and tells me that it isn't a navigation-dvd.. any ideas?

thanks in advance!"

Remember under ""mode"" ""ISO"" use write instead of read.
I use the backup in my car now, and that is a 2004 E-klass"
