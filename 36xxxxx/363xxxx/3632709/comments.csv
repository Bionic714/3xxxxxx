,paulieglott,2011-10-20T20:45Z,"This is far and away my favorite album by DCFC, one of those albums I can listen to again and again, from beginning to end, and never get tired of.  The quality of the writing is just superb throughout, both lyrically and musically.  Should be in the collection of every lover of music that stands out from the ordinary.  ""What Sarah Said"" still gives me chills every time I hear it.  DCFC's ""Sgt. Pepper"" opus, without a doubt (IMHO)."
