Sorry it\'s not better organised
but I doubt there\'ll be too many
complaints. I\'ve taken my fair
share from this internet, this is
an attempt to redress the balance,
though as far as karma goes...I
don\'t suppose I\'ll have much of the
good stuff coming my way for 
\"sharing\" this music without
supporting the musicians involved,
but I do. (\"Go on there lads, that\'s
great work ye\'re doing alltogether,
keep it up.\")
