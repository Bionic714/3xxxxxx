,Skrotnisse4,2007-03-09T21:49Z,"Just so you know it, they have removed the crash mode in this game. a BIG let down. a nice game. but still just half-a-game."
,B-manSwe,2007-03-09T23:30Z,"Just a thought, the info says 4.2Gb, but it says that the torrent is only 1.28 GiB (1372967097 Bytes)???...how superzipped is this? is this a full game or just a stupid demo??"
,jennysalala,2007-03-10T03:36Z,"The game is verrry small.  1.68gb to be exact. The reason: it has a false LBA. So when it was zipped in to archives it got much smaller. To make the extracted iso go from 4.2 to 1.68 gb you have to shrink it. 

Go to:

If you want I can upload a shrink pack so you don't have to look for all those programs.

So in other words, don't worry. False LBA size can be compressed like hell. When you extract it WILL be 4.2GB."
,conker_93,2007-03-10T13:33Z,do you now how to chip a ps2 
,B-manSwe,2007-03-10T17:03Z,demo...say no more...
,jennysalala,2007-03-10T22:34Z,"Think whatever you want. This is no demo. If you think it is and won't download then you're losing more than gaining.

Be appreciative and not greedy. Don't blast crap about free things."
,oblachubs,2007-03-11T05:49Z,"B-manSwe is a F'en idiot.  I just played the game for almost 2 hours.  It works perfectly.  I use the chip brought to us by team Toxic.  Enjoy.

,oblachubs,2007-03-11T05:52Z,"Skrotnisse4 you are obviously interested in an easier game.  Crash mode made it too easy (ie.  for you folks that don't know what that is it allows you to run into traffic runnig the same direction as you, but not oncoming traffice w/o crashing).  So stop you bitchin and just play last years model if you like the game easier.  Much better challenge I think.
"
,Skrotnisse4,2007-03-11T10:25Z,"@oblachubs : You got it all wrong, I'm not talking about ramming into traffic as you say. I'm ofcourse talking about the crash mode. that has been in every burnout game since nr1. crash for cash, as they called it in the first game. Was that so hard for you to understand? instead you say I'll stop bitchin. what an moronic bitch you are yourself. there's allways one. sigh."
,corndog123,2007-03-13T13:06Z,"can't beleive they scrapped the crash mode, that was the best bit!
blow it up....blow it up...!!"
,oblachubs,2007-03-14T02:51Z,I see what you mean now.  It's a demolition mode.  Yea I had fun playing that too.  This version is much harder than the previous though.  The AI cars are still dumb as nails sort of like Skrotnisse4 though :)
,Skrotnisse4,2007-03-14T15:47Z,LOL! wise guy
,raff101,2007-03-15T17:40Z,PLEASE SEED
,B-manSwe,2007-03-24T19:23Z,"oblachubs you stupid fucker, its not a complete game, its a pre-demo or something, they have removed the crash mode in this game. a BIG let down. a nice game. but still just half-a-game...
READ before adding a comment, looser..."
,B-manSwe,2007-06-01T11:46Z,"jennysalala , why is it so important to you that we download this? virus?...."
,Jokks,2007-07-04T17:51Z,HAHAHA!!! Virus in a PS2? :P I dont think so.. I hope someone seed because I will try to download now
,Jokks,2007-07-07T17:21Z,"Ist works perfectly, BUT Burnout Revenge is funnier.. 

This game is not recomended because the funny ""crashcompetition"" when you do a crash to score as much points as possible, is not in this game."
,Turmion__,2007-07-07T21:11Z,Do this woriks in any emulationer programs ??
