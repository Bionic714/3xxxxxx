,Piribucz,2008-11-09T21:14Z,"Those who have downloaded this already, those could tell the other guys about texted languages. I'm very interested in this movie, but I can watch it with english subs to help me. So, I download it and I'll tell you guys some more ;-)"
,Piribucz,2008-11-12T19:07Z,"Ok guys, it's done. It's not the original DVD. It's made from some .avi file, not so good quality of picture. I found only english language and english subtitle. The original 16:9 is remade in 4:3... :-( Thank leland very much anyway! ;-)"
,mongpa,2009-05-14T11:06Z,"Please include English subtitles even for an English movie. It only uses a couple of MB. The are useful for those whose hearing is not sharp (a lot of people) and those whose first language is not one of the audio tracks, but who can read English."
