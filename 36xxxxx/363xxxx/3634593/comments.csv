,CinEmaS,2007-03-08T15:52Z,"I´m so tired of to see WinRAR to everything!
A little file under 200 Mb, it´s soooo stupid!
The RAR is nearly bigger than the ""real"" files!!
You can put things here without WinRAR!
Yes, it´s a fact!!!"
,DjFlate,2007-03-08T16:46Z,"CinEmaS: haha you really dont know why they use rar files do you?! :)
I dont know if u know this but everytime u donwload a file it falls aparat and after a while u wont be able to view the file. 
There for if a rar file is corrupt u only need to download that single file and not the whole clip."
,Wetfox,2007-03-08T18:18Z,"Scene rules, just deal with it"
,svenie,2007-03-08T23:42Z,"civili...

,mutfur,2007-03-09T00:36Z,DjRat: That makes absolutely no sense. Do you know what TCP stands for? And do you know that all BitTorrent clients do checksums of all downloaded segments and match them against the known correct sums?

,ethranet,2007-03-11T08:52Z,"my show breaks up in the middle of it, the picture is unrecognizable"
,servocat,2007-03-13T21:45Z,"more food for thought//

while DjFlate has a point..another reason these avi's are broken up in rars is so uploaders can use one package for all sources.  Newsgroups in particular typically have size limit on attachments. (15mb is a common one)
-s"
,jebedai,2007-03-22T05:33Z,i take it he hasn't had to deal with getting corrupted rars and having to get them off site elsewhere. Nice thing about torrents is you dont have that issue all the bad data is trashed and replaced with good data. make happy happy
,andreyvul,2007-04-03T01:26Z,"rar is a scene tradition from ftp days, deal with it
if you're gonna bitch and whine, unpack and seed it yourself"
,yang_damian,2007-04-06T21:09Z,"it's stupid to put up with it just because it's ""tradtion"" and some people get fuzzy feelings remembering the good old days; ride the wind of change for christ's sake"
,Lethe01,2007-07-20T03:55Z,"Well, if it is traditional and useful, why not use rar then??? it's not so hard to unzip, is it? Or have you all gotten too lazy to do that? "
,Jeordie,2007-10-25T09:28Z,"You guys need to stop your bitching about winrar files. Winrar and sfv's are used to insure integrity. Sure its convenient to get a tv show as one file. However scene groups know much better than you guys. It's easier to replace one file than it is to redownload the entire file.
Sure bittorrent takes care of all that for you, but the scene groups don't want their releases to end up on bit torrent, yet everything does. Groups hate bit torrent and transfer their files around through other means besides p2p. So thats why you get it like that and its usually nice to seem them like this. That way you know the file is good(yes bit torrent will transfer it fine, but did the idiot uploader do anything to the file or did its integrity get corrupted from when he got it?) and that way you know your not just getting web trash."
