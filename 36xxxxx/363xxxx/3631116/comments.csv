,Kronocide,2007-03-03T18:27Z,"Actually, the IMDb page for A Brief History sucks. Here is the BBC page:

,jiiri,2007-04-06T21:05Z,"Thanks Kronocide, great upload. I'm leeching now and will seed for awhile once I get done. Really looking forward to this!"

,neilaroo,2007-11-12T20:59Z,"i've downloaded a few of the files but they don't seem to play properly--the picture starts and stops. is this a problem with the original file or the player? occasioanlly i've had this problem with files, so i assume it's the file not the player... "
,Kronocide,2007-12-12T20:39Z,"I have never experienced any problems with these files. That's not to say that they can't cause problems for some sort of player configuration. But none that I have had, and I have nothing exotic installed."
,sommersby,2008-01-07T19:42Z,"Thanks, Kronocide!
This is a great upload. Very interesting programs indeed, made in the best possible way to speak on that delicate issue. Miller is really remarkable narrator.
All the dialogues of ""Atheism Tapes"" are very vivid and witty, except for the one with Denys Turner."
,neilaroo,2008-01-09T18:46Z,"sorry--you might be right; I guess files won't play right unless all of them have fully downloaded, even though it looked like some were finished. I'll try again--although all I really want is the Brief Hist of Atheism, because I already have the Atheism Tapes. Too bad we can't pick and choose what files to dl. "
,sommersby,2008-01-10T13:45Z,"neilaroo
well, AFAIK, you CAN actually pick the files you like but they all must be fully downloaded (not only look as if they were) otherwise your player (whichever you use) will run an error."
,neilaroo,2008-01-10T22:08Z,"umm, ok. how do i choose which files i want to download? when i try to delete some of the files to the recycle bin, it makes the remaining files/ torrent unable to download."
,sommersby,2008-01-11T12:05Z,"1. Delete the download from your torrent client
2. Download the torrent file again.
3. When starting the torrent, you will be asked what files you want to download and where you want to save them. Put ticks against the ones you'd like to dl."
,neilaroo,2008-01-11T19:32Z,"hi. thanks, but Azureus just adds the torrent again and doesn't give me a chance to make a choice. when I click the Download this torrent, it just has the Open/save/cancel box and that's it. Opening it just adds the whole thing...."
,mediumchilled,2008-02-15T07:06Z,Just use utorrent instead.
[T],pastafari,2008-03-14T22:12Z,excellent! what a knocked out! thanks!
,KingdomCome,2008-08-13T20:19Z,"@Jesus_Christ_is_my_Savior
I emplore you to step in front of the bus and leave us all the hell alone. (pun intended) Hell does not exist, God does not exist.

Used to be an atheist ... heh ... sounds very likely ... what tipped you over into lala-land ? "
,mogto,2008-08-25T01:54Z,Very interesting series.  Shame that ep 3 (the last) ends in the middle of a sentence - but it is right at the end so we probably don't miss anything important.  Hopefully.
,Misterkriskooper,2008-08-28T04:05Z,"hey jesus lover: theres proof that buses exist and that they have great potential energy. 
There is no proof of god heaven or hell. NONE"
,hengest,2008-10-07T18:09Z,"Man, this is the BEST! I just wish I could have this with Portuguese subtitles, and show it in this fervously religious country which Brazil is. Kronocide and the rippers, if you have anything similar in the future, DO put it in. The world needs more sceptics. 
Also recommend the 14 e-books, if someone likes to read. Some are excellent, if not outright provocative. "
,Jesus_Christ_the_only_way,2008-11-20T22:32Z,"@KingdomCome

Hell DOES exist and you will spend all of eternity there unless you get saved. What could possibly be worth spending every moment in constant agony forever? You need to get saved!

TPB allows all manners of pornography and nastiness, yet they deleted all my posts and changed my password because I post about God on relevant torrents. It'll take a lot more than that to stop God's message, my friends!"
,Jesus_Christ_the_only_way,2008-11-20T22:36Z,"@Misterkriskooper:

Plenty of evidence for both, cast off your radical religion of militant atheism and look around you.

Science proves hell is a very real place:

,eMatrix,2008-11-29T23:11Z,"You think that CRAP! web site is scientific prove.
Go back to hell yourself, you fucking idiot... lol"
,Pirate_Bay_Rules,2009-02-26T11:48Z,"I love reading these ""hell DOES exist"" comments on non-religious torrents. A sincere request to the admins ... plzzz don't delete the comments from these morons... TPB wud be too boring without them ... and whom wud we atheists curse if there are no such comments? ;)

To the serious religious fanatics who consider it divine duty to comment on every torrent which is not a rip of ""ten commandments"": have you fuckers ever downloaded and watched a rip before commenting?"
,bigsiss08,2009-05-13T11:48Z,"Its a pity that the last few seconds of part three are missing. I would like to know what disbeliving people should establish. Great upload though, i was more than happy to get this torrent here!"
,-KillerBee-,2010-08-19T15:55Z,"Great torrents, thanks."
,paulieglott,2011-09-26T05:45Z,"I have a suggestion for those who would like us to believe we're doomed to the fires of Hell if we don't believe what they do (oh, that ""Proof of Hell"" link is just too funny, by the way):

Evolve!  Grow a brain!  Grow up!  Santa Claus isn't real either!  Neither is the Tooth Fairy!  There is no Easter Bunny!

Sorry, but someone had to tell you, sooner or later.  I know, disillusionment's a bitch.  You have my sympathies.
