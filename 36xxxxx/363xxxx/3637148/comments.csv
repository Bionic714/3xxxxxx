,UberNube,2007-06-26T19:31Z,"Works great - thank you very much for this wonderful crack

the only problem I have had is sometimes I get an error saying 'compromised program' or something similar - but that seems to have stopped now :D"
,Dangerous_meatball,2007-08-09T17:20Z,"Panda antivirus found:

Generic trojan (undeletable!)

,ichkennealles,2007-08-10T13:35Z,Game Maker 7 seems to have only one crack (drx or whatever) and it's a trojaned one.
,Dangerous_meatball,2007-08-13T16:44Z,It wasn't a trojan when I downloaded it first time. Then I accidentaly deleted it and I thought I could download it and crack it again. But now my antivirus is blocking it but it can't delete it because my stupid comp has locked it unwriteable :(
,Nicalapegus,2007-08-21T06:04Z,dep prevents you from executing the crack-BEWARE! TROJANS AHOY!
,Hoywell,2007-08-29T17:45Z,"Real nice seed, yeah... 4 sure!"
,silentwaiting,2007-09-19T04:48Z,it didn't work i'm still getting the lite version when i open the shortcut on desk top
,silentwaiting,2007-09-19T04:51Z,same here
,silentwaiting,2007-09-19T04:59Z,never mind i got it
,Tha-man,2008-01-01T03:44Z,"Hey, Dangerous_meatball if ur blocked a file create a new file put the blocked file in the new file and delete."
,wiiwoo,2008-01-06T17:06Z,"My comp warned about trojan. i caan't find the crack, does anyone know a safe way to find it?"
,Friendsxix,2008-01-26T20:22Z,IDIOTS! Cracks have a Trojan Nature! So Shut UP! 
,srsobieraj,2008-01-29T04:02Z,"The game states that it is Pro until a ""Pro only"" effect is called in-game.  It then states that ""you can only do this with the Pro version"". Upon aborting and returning to Game Maker, the program now shows as ""Lite"".

Any help from the folks that have got this to work? "
,Trashcanman02,2008-02-12T05:11Z,"Yes. Cracks have a trojan nature. Antivirus just picks and chooses which ones to flag, and completely ignores the others. Makes perfect sense."
,tucker87,2008-02-22T16:08Z,"The Crack is odd. It extracts to the Program Files\Game Maker Folder and you have to create a shortcut to it and launch ""DrXJ.exe"" Instead of the gamemaker.exe"
,Frenchflyingcows,2008-04-05T00:10Z,"Despite everything, the crack works. Frankly there is no real virus. I use NOD32 and have about 3 firewalls working together, and not once has anything complained about this crack. So please, just thanks the guy, and leave!"
,ozzich,2008-04-29T22:09Z,SEED!:):):):)
,Beebopz,2009-08-17T00:59Z,"Can anyone clearly explain how to use the crack? The download came with an installer and a ""crack"" folder with the MSinfo document Dr.XJ in it. I've no idea what I'm supposed to do with it, can ANYBODY give me an answer? Thanks."
