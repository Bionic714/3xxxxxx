*** JUST WHAT IS THIS TORRENT? ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Some folks seem to think that my NFO's are a bit vague, so here is the lowdown 
on this DVD. It's a fan created preservation of the AS-AIRED episodes. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** FEATURED PRESERVATION ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


BLAX02: Birds of Prey - The Complete Series

The comic was also loosely adapted to a television series, Birds of Prey. Set in 
an alternate future of the DC Universe, the show starred Dina Meyer as Oracle 
and Ashley Scott as Huntress, established partners in New Gotham. Meyer's Oracle 
was the paralyzed former Batgirl; Scott's Huntress was the daughter of Batman 
and a meta-human Catwoman, and as such exhibited feline powers.

Joined in the pilot episode by a young psychic runaway named Dinah (played by 
Rachel Skarsten), the team spent 13 episodes stopping various meta-human threats 
such as Huntress' old high school friend Shiva and a thinly-veiled Nightwing 
knockoff, the dangerous "Darkstrike" (previously known as "Nightstrike" until 
the similarity to Nightwing prompted the change). Other main cast members 
included Shemar Moore as Huntress' love interest Detective Jake Reese, and Mia 
Sara as the villainous Dr. Harleen Quinzel (Harley Quinn). Lori Loughlin was a 
notable guest star, playing Dinah's meta-human mother: the Black Canary.

While the series was short-lived, many fans praised Dina Meyer's portrayal of 
Barbara Gordon/Oracle, and hope that the comic may some day be more successfully 
adapted.
