On 6th March 2007, The Championship league table stood like this: 
   1 Birmingham    35  67 
   2 Derby County  35  66 
   3 WBA           36  63 
   4 Sunderland    36  63 
   5 Preston       35  62 
   6 Wolves        36  62 
Just 5 points covering the top six teams! It's as tight as a crabs' @r$?, and that's water tight. In a packed program today, Liverpool born Matt Smith reviews yesterday's action from the Championship, including extended highlights of Hull City against Preston North End at *THE* Kingston Communications Stadium ffs. Phil Brown knows his side must take three points from this game, as with away trips to Luton Town and Sunderland coming up next week, the Tigers need to give their fight against relegation a much-needed boost. 
And what about Leeds? Are they really going down this season? Can Sunderland continue their run?
No dreary Drury this week as commentary is provided by Jon Champion and Angus Scott, with reports from Robbie Earle MBE at Barnet, Ned Boulting, Tom Skippings, Richard Henwood and Dave Beckett. Ned Boulting has a chat with Don Goodman about today's Black Country derby. No coverage of the mightly Argyle this week as they play on Sunday (live on BBC) against Watford in the FA Cup. And hey, the FA are now have the 'kin keys to the new ┬ú800M Wembley Stadium! 
Plus, as always folks, *all* the goals from CC league 1 and 2.
