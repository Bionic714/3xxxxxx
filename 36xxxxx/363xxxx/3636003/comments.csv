However, if this is a different Pimsleur Thai course or a next serie pls let me know.

Korp khun khrap :-)"
,khunflip,2007-12-06T23:38Z,"is this the first Pimsleur 30 lesson course for beginners or a different one? pls let me know before i download, thx"

,rapidlearnthai,2010-08-15T04:35Z,"Look at this posting (http://www.phuket-info.com/forums/thai-society-culture-thai-language/49947-learn-read-thai-weekend-workshop-5-6-june-2.html) for an effective strategy on how to become fairly proficient in Thai relatively quickly and easily. Itâ€™s about halfway down the page, entitled: The ""Rapid"" strategy for how to learn Thai.

I will also be putting together a supplementary guide to use with pimsleur. Pimsleur is great up to a point. It works far better if you write down and memorize the vocabulary for each lesson (perhaps using the Anki flashcard system). Also make a point of repeating each phrase over and over and over again in a loud and exaggerated manner. Speaking is a MUSCLE skill, like dancing or karate or piano. It is not a ""linguistic"" skill."
