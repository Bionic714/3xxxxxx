Thanks Clony...you are my friend!
"
,Clapton,2007-03-04T15:30Z,"Same here! Works too!! Clony rules! Thanks! Once Vista is activated I guess is recomended to deactivate automatic updates, isn't it? "
,Gelbs,2007-03-04T15:49Z,"Think I am fucked. I installed Vista using some serial off the net, and then I formatted without the key. But the crack won't install. Is this because of the BIOS thingy that Vista does? Is there anything I can do? Cheerz."

This might help?

Read the uninstall part."
,Gelbs,2007-03-04T16:17Z,"Thanks but I'll have to somehow find another way. Can't be assed to format and try again. Have computer installed and setup nicely and it might now work anyway. Is there any other ideas? And Clony, can you do the same update that will work with people such as myself who stuck a key in prior to install? If it is in the Bios then I can't do it. I assume this is why the crack fails."
,DELLIRIUM:#,2007-03-04T16:20Z,is this a same crack like clony beta.2.
,Gelbs,2007-03-04T16:20Z,"Plus off topic, how can you find the temp folder in Vista? I know there is a temp folder under the Windows folder, but I mean the other temp folder like on XP was located in Documents. I can't find it anywhere and even tryed searching. Thanks."

,Web Wiper,2007-03-04T19:43Z,"Plse explain this to me : why does everyone want to get it active and genuine ?  I use a timer-stopper and I'm able to get in all updates, extra's, ...  Why bother to try to activate ?  Or am I missing something ...

Secondly : I installed Ultimate 32 without key ... Can I simply reinstall and use this crack ?"
,lb61b,2007-03-04T20:20Z,x64 version??   Anybody??
,wackopath,2007-03-04T20:24Z,"well this works but not all the time.
first i tried the original PDX method on a clean install and it worked perfect, activated and all but it worked the first 3 boots , then i got the blue-screen saying something like ""royal.sys"" is trying to write on read-only-memory etc...
so i rebooted in safe mode and uninstalled without hassle
then i tried the clony method and then i got the blue-screen again @ first boot...
any one any idea about this hassle?"
,Web Wiper,2007-03-04T21:03Z,Is a fresh install necessary ??  I installed Ultimate 32 without key ... can I just run this ?
,RoyalRandom,2007-03-04T22:14Z,will it work if i have the time stopper crack? if it doesnt can i remove the time stopper crack?
,no_rookies,2007-03-04T22:38Z,awsome_ and it take that long to beat microsoft once again...
,Tmas,2007-03-05T03:37Z,Woo! This worked fine for me. No viruses either.

,yongzen,2007-03-05T15:13Z,nice....thanks.......
,Sarre,2007-03-05T16:55Z,"Why is it tagged simply ""x86"" if it doesn't work on the 64-bit version of Vista? 64-bit x86 CPUs are still, well, x86.

And where does this x64 nonsense come from? There's no xxx64 family of processors that I know of, and certainly none the is supported by Vista.

""x86-64"" and ""x86-32"" would be proper ways to denote Intel ISA x86 compatible CPUs of the 64 and 32-bit variety, respectively.

Sorry for the rant, but I did expect this to work on 64-bit versions too."
,unicynic,2007-03-05T19:24Z,"@Sarre, where have you been for the last three years?
Microsoft (and Sun) has been calling it x64 for years meaning that it will run on both AMD64 and EM64T - so as not to confuse with IA-64.
Anyway, it says so like that in Windows Vista and XP.
Don't blame others for your own ignorance. If you're to stupid to search Google, just go on buy the license - you'd definitely need the support."
,clony_patcher,2007-03-05T19:28Z,"This crack works with x86 windows vista (32 bit).

NO Timerlock
NO modify your Vista bootloader! (softmod crack)

If you installed Timerlock you can install the new one with no problem
without fresh installation.

If you installed a softmod version you can use 'Vista Manager Pro'
to rebuilt the bootloader and than you can apply the crack.

Download the software:
http://www.vistabootpro.org

Guide:
In Vista Manager Pro select 'BootLoader', select 'Reinstall the original bootloader'
and then click 'Apply'.

For x64 Windows Vista (64bit) I suggest, for now, to continue to use
the version based on Timerlock.

,clony_patcher,2007-03-08T09:43Z,"The BSOD error is caused by the Update from Microsoft named
Nforce4 PCI-Express Root Port (also included in Nvidia drivers).

This is a guide to solve the problem: 


1. If you got the BSOD, find a way (safemode or dualboot)
   to rename the file in \windows\system32\drivers\royal.sys to royal2.sys

2. Your should not get the BSOD the next time you restart.
   Go to Control panel -> Device Manager.

3. Under System Devices you should see the Nforce4 PCI-Express Root Port.

4. Right-click and choose Properties.

5. Under the Driver tab choose Roll Back Driver.

6. BEFORE you restart rename \windows\system32\drivers\royal2.sys back to royal.sys

7. Restart now and it should be activated!"

,lb61b,2007-03-15T10:57Z,When will we see 64 bit version??
,mattchazz,2007-03-17T14:08Z,"Here's my rant.  Why do people want the x64 version of Vista?  It's like the 64-bit version of Windows XP --- CRAP.  There's very few native 64-bit programs and won't be for years.  And I've seen benchmarks where trying to run 32-bit programs with 64-bit XP actually runs SLOWER than running the 32-bit programs with 32-bit XP.  

The only advantage a 64-bit Windows has (XP or Vista) is when it's running a native 64-bit app.  And those are few and far between.  

So, best to stick with the 32-bit (x86) Vista until there's a much better inventory available."
,WaltDog,2007-03-18T21:33Z,"I activated Vista with this, but Microsoft Word still wants a product key.  I entered the one from the .nfo, doesn't work.  Ideas?"
,project6,2007-03-18T22:53Z,"mattchazz: Those benchmarks are indeed true for Windows XP, but you should go and read up and look into similar ones for Vista.... HUUUUGE difference."
,project6,2007-03-18T22:55Z,"Also, atm I'm running eleven 32-bit processes and ten 64-bit processes. So the assumption that there wont be 64-bit apps for YEARS ahead belongs in a trashcan."

If you don't, you will get a Blue Screen saying your computer tried to write to read only memory and Windows had been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. One of the Windows Updates prevents the crack, so that is why you must run the crack before you do Windows Update.

So MAKE SURE YOU RUN THE """"VistaActivator.exe"" file before WINDOWS UPDATE!"

,koldie,2008-01-23T17:04Z,Is there virus or not?! I scanned it to virus total  and nothng found
,Viraii,2008-01-29T12:39Z,"This ain't cool. I downloaded and installed Vista Ultimate x86.

I entered NO product key. The first thing I did when getting in vista was installing this crack as directed.

I started up, it showed it as activated. It passed WGA. I installed DX10. When I restarted later it was no longer activated and the days are counting down as they go by.

How do I fix this?"
,Viraii,2008-01-29T12:40Z,"Oh, and none of those product keys even work."
,Viraii,2008-01-30T17:25Z,"This crack DOES NOT WORK properly

It will pass WGA but your 30 days still count down and the OS expires; and the registration keys do not work, nor does entering them via a cmd prompt."
,08Peechie08,2008-02-04T02:18Z,"Ok here is how to do it! :

Don't install updates before installing as the updates stop the crack from working. If u have installed updates before even 29 day's ago it will still not work so if you have done this reinstall Windows Vista.

Now when no updates have been installed Extract Files to a file in desktop. now launch crack and install then press launch program after installing. CMD will come up and saying installing when done press any key to continue. Reboot then it should be activated.

This worked on my Windows Vista Ultimate (32-bit) E-System 4215C.

Need any help just reply to me and i will help.

I have used this on my friends PC
Windows Vista Ultimate (64-bit) Dell. And yes this does work on (64-Bit). "

,trueblu8,2008-03-04T21:04Z,"YES!  ""Windows is activated""  Worked like a charm.  Thanks Clony.  You're the best."
,Superballs,2008-03-08T20:51Z,"This Crack does in fact work.

When installing, as per the instructions, do NOT enter a key.

Also, when given the option to ""protect your PC"" opt for the manual configuration option.  You do not want updates applied until you've run this.

If you have an NForce2 or 4 chipset you also have to be very careful as the latest PCI Bus Management (as per march 2008) or if you have NForce4, do not install Nforce4 PCI-Express Root Port, the problem is apparently with some buggy NVidia drivers and not with Vista or the Crack itself, this applies for both the CLoNY crack and the PARADOX crack.

A huge shout out to CLoNY and PARADOX for a job well done.

If you're wondering whether or not you want to move from XP to Vista, consider the following:

Vista is running great on my 3000+ Atlon XP (single 32-bit core) system with 2GB dual channel RAM and a GForce 7300GT (AGP) GFX Card.  So far, as far as User Experience Level Goes, I'm at a 3.6 mainly because my CPU is getting that rating and it is the lowest, everything else is at a 4.2 or higher (HDD Transfer rate is 5.2 and thei're all IDE).

All told this is a 4 year old machine i'm running.  Hardly cutting edge technology."
,TrenTech,2008-03-09T10:35Z,"Will this work with Vista Enterprize? Well I guess I'll find out and let yall know. Not that any of you guys Use Enterprise.


By the way it does indeed work for ultimate. And no it's not a virus. Clean as my ol lady's snatch. Like a week after I cracked windows, I got this thing from windows update saying that there was a program installed that could make my copy of windows come up conterfit and they would remove the problem. After that everything stayed cool. Aparently Bill Gates got beat at his own greedy game lol "
,roketman05,2008-03-10T19:23Z,Wow! it really does work.  Good Sh!T
,siksi,2008-03-11T12:56Z,nooo download ****trojan virus 100%****
,Superballs,2008-03-17T03:07Z,"Yes, AVG Free is showing this as a trojan, but then again AVG also shows most keygens and such as trojans too.  Though i'm not 100% positive yet, i'm guessing that this is a false positive, never know though if i find out otherwise i'll just use the paradox crack but until i'm sure i'm leaving it as it is"
,Superballs,2008-03-17T03:11Z,"Actually, what i'm curious about right now is if someone's using any other AV program (not norton) does this show up as a virus/trojan on your AV app?"
,cdontv,2008-03-21T21:43Z,i had installed it and vista has now SP1 update can i install it...
,cjswatts,2008-03-26T13:39Z,"Great stuff, worked like a dream even with programs and windows updates fully updated. Thanks"
,SkyCyber,2008-03-26T21:26Z,"This crack works great and it is easy to install.

Scanned with F-secure and seems to be clear.
Only Spybot seems to find some files of this program and it says that there are trojan files and that they connects to internet when online.
But you can clear those files and your windows vill be still activated.

One more thing..this crack doesn't work on Windows Vista SP1..it says it have activate it but after restart windows shows not activated."
,ravis12,2008-03-31T22:25Z,work so dame easy.... thanks

,Wesker187,2008-04-02T15:47Z,works with anything but SP1 and spy bot came up with 16 virus from this but were very east to remove.
,klamb213,2008-04-04T14:20Z,I have tried this 3 time on 3 different computers. Worked the first time but not the last 2. First one is a compaq HP and the last 2 were emachines. All three had ultimate intalled from the CD/DVD.

,rayza563,2008-05-10T06:09Z,"WELL IT FUCKING took me to read all 7 pages of comments and coz clony patcher did not answer i will..

VISTA SERVICE PACK 1 = NEGATIVE with the standalone patcher.

will not work on SP1 but really sp 1 is for people without the internet so your sp1 is actually sent to you through updates and it is MUCH MUCH smaller than the standalone 430mb one on the Micro$oft site."

,AMIRZ,2008-06-19T19:19Z,"Hello all, as long as ur machine BIOS definitely has OEM SLIC table (which usually came from big OEM such Sony, Dell, Toshiba, Lenovo, etc with preinstalled OSes too) this crack (n also parodox one as well) will always work if u install/activate by it b4 u update to SP1. to all systems that have no SLIC table, then it wont work anymore (after SP1). Thanx n regards cya"
,vaikz,2008-06-21T04:00Z,"hI guys, I think you should used this link:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4234530/Vista_Loader_3.0.0.1_-_Activates_Vista_SP1_x86_x64

I used this on my vista ultimate sp1 oem june edition from bie on a virtual box and it works very well. 

Just follow the instruction on how to install the os and then turn off all security like anti virus, defender and the auc. and its better to install first all your drivers before running this crack.

cheers!!!"
,Benthol,2008-06-25T18:23Z,"Thanks man, this worked perfectly.

I scanned it with Avast and no virus was found."
,luigiTPB,2008-07-21T07:20Z,this worked like a charm. keep up the good work! no virus just follow the instructions and it will work!
