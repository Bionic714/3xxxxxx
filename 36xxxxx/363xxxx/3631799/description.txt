Windows Vista All Versions x86 OneClick Activator  - 4st March 2007 - by CLoNY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This crack enable user to bypass the product activation
requirement of Microsoft Windows Vista x86 by emulating
hardware-embedded BIOS ACPI_SLIC license information of
so called ?Royalty OEMs?.

In combination with a matching product key and OEM certificate
this allows for rendering any system indistinguishable from a
legit pre-activated system shipped by the respective OEM.

This crack doesn't use vstaldr Grup multiboot boot
loader to load the emulation driver during initial
boot up of system but is completely software based
Windows driver whichruns within Windows Vista 
operating system environment.

I suggest to do a fresh installation but If you have installed  
other crack that modify the bootloader of Vista you can try to  
use this software to reinstall it:
