,halvardroms,2008-01-03T14:20Z,"hey, skaalaen...
i would really like to download this game, but no one seeds, so that's very hard. So since this game is so small (253.49 KiB) can't you just send it to me by mail?

Isnt there anyone out there willing to programme a newer version of this great game ? Just add a few more variables and tweaks to it, a few more functions and updates for all the leagues?

Am I willing to help with funds if anyone would be interested in upgrading this awesome game !
