Beard Guy: ...I think I got my think a concussion.
Marco: Waitin' on you!
Beard Guy: ...now... cause remember I can't fix stuff?
Debbie DuPree: Oh, great! Now what do we do?
Beard Guy: I gotta lay down back... 'cause our concussion had me sleepy.

""sealab 2021 season 1 dvd disc 1 of 2 


after i upload this and get enough seeds i will start uploading disc 2 ""

BECAUSE OF THAT"
,deamon2000,2007-03-25T01:50Z,"Mfriendly
& YOU RELLY SHOULD SEED "
,Mfriendly,2007-03-25T05:03Z,"do think i have done my part by seeding 3 1/2 days...maybe someone else of the dlĂ¨rs should feel quilty.

lol "
,deamon2000,2007-05-03T19:21Z,sorry disc 2 is damaged and it skips so im not gonna up load a damaged disc 
,Cougy,2007-09-16T09:08Z,"i don't get how to watch it.. unlike other files I've seen.  help please?  I've tried mounting as CD image and a couple of other things so far, but to no avail.  Thanks"
,darko999,2007-12-21T09:06Z,does anyone know where to find old demonoid torrents? cause they had complete sealab dvd set in iso but they closed down before i could get in... shame....
,deamon2000,2008-01-10T04:43Z,there dead yeah but hopefully some one well up load them i had them like all my torrents there back ups to the real thing for me and if some one else happens to dl then what a shame :P
,audioelite,2008-02-20T06:35Z,add disk 2
,Ghetto_Cartoon,2008-03-02T07:17Z,Sealab. That shit's awesome as hell. I love that type shit. Great show.
,AlekseiU,2008-04-07T03:52Z,If I get the downloaded I will seed it for sure.
,AlekseiU,2008-04-07T03:53Z,"the file downloaded, doh!"
,blemishednicely,2008-08-16T03:58Z,"I love this show!!! Too bad disc 2 seems to be pooched out-that totally sucks about demonoid, too! When I get this I'll seed whenever possible---probably sick of hearing this, but any ideas on where to find disc 2? P.S.- they got a SECOND season yet, or is it cancelled? PPS-you think this is bad for seeds? COPS 2170 has been on the bay forever AND it seems to be the ONLY torrent on the net I can find for it & it's been dead for at least a year and 1/2, so I wouldn't bitch too hard! Thanks, deamon2000! I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS!"
,blemishednicely,2009-03-01T03:52Z,"8-14 Kb? That'd be a dream! right now I get 3-7 when the sole seeder is on-don't think I can hold for another 30%, the juice was on a few days ago, PLEASE switch it back!"
,blemishednicely,2009-03-01T06:16Z,"It is totally NOT 63 kb  @ least as I am pinning 73.3% and I still have around a year and 20 weeks to wait before it figures it'll be done. I would possibly suggest ""Sealab 2021 Complete"" (no offence, deamon 2000) as it has more than 1 seed though I have only just begun DL'ing S I dunno the grade. This really is an awesome shew...""Hesh wants sex!!!"" "
,blemishednicely,2009-03-01T06:23Z,"And yes that's right I am nearing an anniversary on getting this DL but the availability is so low I just don't think I can hang in now there's a newer complete compilation unless it's flawed. I really would like a definite solid disc copy instead of a chopped rip. My Visa's blown so I can't even just order one on the net, sooo I dunno. Time to rest my violin, lols"
,blemishednicely,2009-03-04T22:00Z,"I am now at 84% but still holding cuz being a full DVD rip it's gotta b good quality (after waiting over a year it damn well better had do), but the other SEALAB compilation already went from 0-100% before this one gained 11%. Dude I am nearly there, lemme finish and pick up the slack!"
,blemishednicely,2009-03-06T22:43Z,"Awesome! DISC 1 IS MINE!!! I will seed with you now, too (barring PC failure & needing to reformat/partition) for as long as possible. Complete disk RIP (deadly job, dude!), looks excellent, too! If you could upload Disk 2 [ as a personal favour to me >:) ], I would LOVE to get my hands on it! 'Tis a damn good shew, lols. For anyone else...the wait is TOTALLY worth it!-Hopefully I can bump the availability higher to make it less. Kick that ass some more, deamon2000-U gotta new fan. PS-ignore ALL my earlier bitching, sorry...damn ingrates! Think my Potty-Tentacle may have been acting up again-LMAO!"
,blemishednicely,2009-03-06T22:55Z,"Damn, that's right, you said disk 2 is pooched so I guess no dice then? Please lemme know if you had any luck fixing it, or know anywhere else I could get it? The only other source about seems to be ""Complete Sealab 2021"", which is loaded with extra content (including the ""Pilot Pitch"" which is good for a low-budget laugh), but the quality varies from Ep-Ep and they are all separate files instead of the continuous compilation style here, which I prefer...but beggars can't be choosers I guess. Still gunna seed either way. Thanks dude, I'll get off your wall now!"
