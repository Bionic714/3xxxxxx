Review from Steve:
The title has come from a line near the end of the CD. Spoken by Van Morrison in reply to 
someone in the audience who seems to disagree with Van taking a long time to return for an encore 
(about 3-4 minutes of clapping) and gets up on the stage himself - 
Van Morrison replies "If You Don't Like It, Go Fuck Yourself"
