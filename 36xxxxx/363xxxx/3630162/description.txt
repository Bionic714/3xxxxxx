Gravity is Rumba Flamenco World Beat Jazz Pop. Jesse Cook remembers, "About a year and a half ago, I started to record my first album, "Tempest". In the beginning, I was recording alone until, little by little, help began to arrive - musician friends calling up to offer their services and family members offering support. As the album took shape, so did the small team of people who would help bring it to fruition. it is due to the efforts of this ever growing team that I have been given the freedom to follow my muse and record Gravity. I had often imagined what Spanish guitars, Andean flutes and African drums might sound like if they came together." Bound by gravity, cascading rhythms fall, like musical rain pulled into a irresistibile orbit where the pulse quickens and the blood runs a little hotter. // Enjoy this great album.
