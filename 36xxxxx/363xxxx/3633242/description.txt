Discover the fantastic power of helping your best friends in this totally new, enchanted Bratz movie that will have you looking at the world in a sparkling-new way. When Cloe and Yasmin follow Cymbeline in order to discover an explanation for her strange behaviour, they bring to light a secret more amazing than they ever imagined.
