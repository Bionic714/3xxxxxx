This is an absolutely legendary performance by the late comic genious Sam Kinison. Filmed at the Roxy in Hollywood, this is Sam before he was a superstar. He is at his best here, in pre-prodigy form. Many of his Christ-related skits and his unforgettable "alphabet" gag. This should not be missed if your are a fan of stand-up. This is better than the other 2 home videos he released, "Banned" and "Family Hour", although they are also highly recommended.
