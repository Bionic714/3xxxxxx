,Consider-Phlebas,2007-03-20T08:35Z,"Just noted that if you want the fallback tracker to work for this torrent you need to change its port number from 3398 to 3399 - apparently they use different port numbers for different torrents.
In Azureus you do this by right-clicking the tracker url in the general options tab, there is an edit function there. For other clients I have no clue."

,Consider-Phlebas,2007-10-20T20:01Z,"I'm no longer seeding these KP torrents, but as it is a multiple tracker torrent most likely you can find peers - the traffic through the other tracker used to be quite large."
