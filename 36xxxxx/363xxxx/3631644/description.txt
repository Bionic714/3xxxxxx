ABSOLUTE ELSEWHERE - IN SEARCH OF ANCIENT GODS (1976)

This is ripped from an original 1976 vinyl record, which unfortunately sometimes is clearly audible. However, since the album is not yet available on cd, I still thought that this would be of some interest. (As this is my first torrent, I really hope this works.)


An Experience in Sound and Music Based on the Books of Erich von DÃ¤niken.
