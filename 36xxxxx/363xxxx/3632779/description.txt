Synopsis
Take an ocean voyage of full-masted fright with Dead Calm, "a spare, smart, seductive piece of moviemaking with enough tension to keep us all hyperventilating for hours" -Sheila Benson, Los Angeles Times. Thriller specialist Philip Noyce (Patriot Games, The Saint) directs three splendid actors -Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut) and Billy Zane (Titanic)- in riveting performances. Joe and Rae Ingram (Neill and Kidman) do the right thing and rescue the half-delirious sole survivor (Zane) of a crippled schooner. But soon the stranger will plunge the unwary pair into an intense battle of cat and mouse. And life or death.
