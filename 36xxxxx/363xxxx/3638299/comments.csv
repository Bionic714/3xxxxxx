,sk_few,2007-03-14T10:19Z,"Thanks Kolll! Watchable release. not the best, the sound is ok, although cant hear what they say at times. Some scenes are too black, so turn off your light and it may help. Overall a very great movie. Cant wait for the DVDrip"

Dumbass! This movie is based on the comic book, and the comic books are based on a historical event, don't know how historical though (probably not much)"
,Drac0nis,2007-03-19T06:58Z,"The movie is damn near an identical filmed version of the comic book. Real fun movie to see, not realy supposed to be historical, Take it as a great action flick and you will be impressed. Go in expecting a history drama and you will be disapointed and STUPID for expecting such from a comic adaptation."
,Blaseba,2007-03-19T11:35Z,"I have downloaded this for about 5 h, and stil just got 0.6% in a 0,9kb/s speed.
