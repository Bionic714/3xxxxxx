,HelterSkelter,2007-03-19T16:16Z,"I got a similar error. I tried to shorten the file name when downloadig, and it sems to work ok... So try changing the file name to e.g. ""The Finest Electro Jazz Complication"".

Thx Kiba - great music. "
,Kiba,2007-03-22T18:26Z,"I use µtorrent; no problems. maby shorten down the name would help.
So: Eighter short the name down OR install µtorrent:)

Enjoy and seed!"
,yetihair,2007-04-22T18:23Z,"If you have problems adding these track to itunes its because of the length of the file and folder names, just drop the ""the finest elecro jazz...."" off the end of the older names, should do the trick.
Damn the 255 character limit "
,Kiba,2007-05-14T19:38Z,what are u talking about?! 
,KrÃ¤ftan,2007-05-26T18:52Z,Thanks!
,copicuk,2007-06-05T14:45Z,"Ive downloaded this file 3 times, each time I get uTorrent telling me I have downloaded 100% (1Gb) however downloaded folder is only 320MB. And although all files seem to be in the folders, only half of them will play in the variety of players I have. And I have no idea why! Any one have a clue? Is this to do with the filenames? I dont even seem to be able to change them (no rename option in windows), windows doesnt offer me the same options for these files as it usually does..!!please leave a comment here if u know what the issue is and/or how to resolve it, it benefits us all. thx"
,copicuk,2007-06-05T17:10Z,"aah, ok, I think I got it. Its this weird ass naming convention. I had to shorten the names of the containing folders. took any ""."" out too just in case. And moved the folders up a directory too. Now works fine! tiptop"
,copicuk,2007-06-05T17:11Z,"oh yeh, and thx for great tunes- sorry I cant seed since folder names changed"

,yokozuna021,2007-12-05T00:15Z,"Hey, I forgot since I was so excited to have this music deep in my ears.

There is a problem with a volume 5, 5th song, even in dos under xp I can not rename it or copy it. Tried shortening, tried everything. Deleted it at the end. One more or less is not a waste, just to let you now.

Thank you once again, this is far the best music I heard in years!!!

Respect!"

Is it possible to do a ""The Future Sound of Jazz"" discography? Or if anyone can find it anywhere, i've been looking for a long time. Thanks!"

,alfonz03,2008-03-28T18:53Z,its sayin that its blocked what does this mean? can anybody help me?
,voodoo1331,2008-04-07T17:51Z,half of those song wont play 
,atomicrabbit,2008-04-10T18:15Z,"thanks for the upload. Just to comment, if the songs aren't playing, it's probably because the path + filename is too long. A lot of players cannot play a song with a path longer than 255 characters. Your best bet is to either:

- shorten the folder names
- shorten the filenames
- move the folders closer to the root of the drive
- or all of the above

hope that helps."
,atomicrabbit,2008-04-10T18:17Z,"btw, I've had Volumes I-IV for a few years now and i love them. I can't wait to hear volumes V-IX!! thanks again!"

,opredeleno,2010-11-15T08:30Z,"Kiba, please help me, I can't seed this because of song 5 vol. 7, cd1. I have downloaded 100% of the torrent and when I try to seed, I get an Access denied error (after renaming a lot of filenames to shorten them). I tried to move it around from the external hdd to internal and when I did recheck, it stops exactly at this song and won't move anymore. I renamed it, deleted it, it won't work. 
I'm using utorrent
Thank you in advance"
