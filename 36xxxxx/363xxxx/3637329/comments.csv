,Matt M.,2007-06-11T00:14Z,"Just so that future downloaders know, the majority of these yaoi comics revolve around characters who definitely look underage. Download at your discretion."
,chris1989,2007-10-27T04:21Z,Seed please
,Miran999,2008-06-01T02:31Z,"Thanks Matt, I try to be discrete."
,pilotclan,2008-10-17T02:58Z,mhhh seeds need more 
,Frozenfucker,2008-10-18T13:06Z,Please seed? :)
,audiocode,2008-10-19T08:04Z,"I've downloaded this, but for some reason when I unzip the files, all I get are blank folders. I can't view the files through WinRAR either. Some help, please?"
,audiocode,2008-10-19T08:49Z,"...okay, problem solved. Turns out I was using the wrong program. "
,audiocode,2008-10-19T09:52Z,...I spoke too soon. I can't extract the files using WinZip either -- it just gives me blank folders. Help?
,KojiroRei,2008-11-22T01:53Z,"what extraction prgram should I use for this, is it free, and were can I get it?"
,Ravlor,2008-11-30T23:43Z,Of course they look underage! It is SHOTA! 
,emonquente,2009-03-26T05:12Z,Perhaps it was a warning for someone searching for shota that doesn't understand the concept? n.n
,astro2,2011-06-22T09:02Z,"1, where are the seeds?
