,annoyingzhang,2007-03-14T07:28Z,"Man i really hope not, but don't count on it coming back next year. LONG LIVE STARGATE!!!!!! Oh and thanks kollll your very cool! Ha : )"
,skeppstroll,2007-03-14T13:32Z,"Well, the SG Atlantis series is in my opinion made for young people, even children. So the only reason i want to watch it is that its one of very few sci-fi series at all... lets just hope those SG movies will kick some serious butt:)"
,annoyingzhang,2007-03-14T14:37Z,The movies will only be DVD release and i don't have a home theater system so no cool sound effects. I think children shouldn't watch SG Atlantis with the Wrath and all begin so dam freaky; it'll give them nightmares! 
,SDR89,2007-03-18T02:14Z,"Unfortunatly....
Stargate SG-1 will not continue..
BUT there are rumors that there will b TV movies and possiblly CINEMA MOVIES!!!
But as i say its only rumors.
