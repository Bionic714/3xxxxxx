,neasteflorin,2007-06-17T13:34Z," I back up my files online to prevent data loss, in case my computer gets a virus or I want to reinstall windows or even if get a new computer and I want to have all my files on it. It saves all your documents, music, photos, videos online for you to access  securely from any computer connected to the internet. It can even back-up a whole drive. Using it for 2 years, never let me down. I strongly recommend Mozy. Plus,you get 2GB of storage for free. You can sign up for Mozy  here: https://mozy.com/?code=J4MTDK"
