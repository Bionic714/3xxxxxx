,^FLaSH^,2007-03-11T22:13Z,Turbo Tax 2003? You need to spring ahead to the year 2007 dude!! This is useless except for those people who didn't fila a tax return in 2003. 
,2rep,2007-11-10T01:06Z,"pay no attention to the trolls..... if you ever needed to open a previous return, it's fucking impossible unless you still have the software....... Much thanks!!!"
,soccerdad,2008-08-12T21:39Z,How about Turbotax premier for 2002?  anyone hve that?
,authoriseduser,2009-04-29T00:19Z,I've been in Europe since 1992 - and haven't filed since 1991.  I could sure use some help here.  Anybody have any TurboTax applications going back to 1991???
,gladdy8er,2009-09-23T21:33Z,"Thank You! both to Synergygs and seeders for keeping this alive. It's a long story but I have to amend my 2003 return here in 2009. This U/L is a real blessing. It's going to help me not only time-wise but also from screwing it up.
Thanks again!"
