How can this be EBA 08/2003 when all the files within the RAR-file are from 2001? The PDF with the setup instructions says May 2002..."
,pontiff,2007-03-07T00:53Z,"A very good question, the answer to which I am not sure.  Im at work now so I cant check my system at home, I just went off what the CD had on it.  In the program somewhere I thnk it does refer to 08/2003.  Its probably just the actual data that has been updated rather than the actual program or the readme."
