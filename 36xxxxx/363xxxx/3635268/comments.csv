,-HK-,2007-03-30T12:46Z,One way to do it is to block some other users so youÂ´re only uploding to one or two persons.. hopefully those 2 continues seeding and the progress is on ;)  I think IÂ´ll wait to dl this one until someone else has the whole... over 20 days and only ~700mb to share is a loooong time.... But thanks for sharing this one... it will be interesting to view when the time comes :)

,Kemisten,2007-09-15T23:40Z,Is this film homemade by a hobby journalist? It is definitely full of conspiracy. Download Terrorstorm-Alex Jones or 911 Mysteries instead. Much better journalism.
