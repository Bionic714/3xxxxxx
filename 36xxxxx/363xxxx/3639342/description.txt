INTERNET VIDEO POWER HOUR v2.0
------------------------------

Oh Cany Productions is back with version 2.0 of our Internet Video Power Hour!  This is a drinking game made up of viral videos from all over the Internet.

The rules are simple: Every time the video changes, drink!

Also included are forty deleted clips that didn't make the power hour, but are still fun to watch.  If you want, you can watch the videos back-to-back and do a 100-minute power hour marathon!  This power hour is available on Google Video, as a downloadable WMV, and in DVD and Divx versions.
