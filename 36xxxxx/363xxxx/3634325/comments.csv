I'd recommend using Imgburn.

,Delichris,2007-05-14T12:19Z,"PCSX2.
But you need a great graphics card and CPU to play it at decent speed."
,LordQuait,2007-07-17T11:00Z,"SEEDS FTW!

this game really needs more seeds, especially for how friggin' awesome it is... :C"
,CoriolanusDelSnazzy,2007-08-14T20:55Z,"I extracted the iso file and burned it to a CD using imgburn... But how/where do I play it? Whenever I used PCSX2, the emulator said I needed bios files... I'm sorry, but I'm just really confused..."

,nofuture4me,2007-10-20T09:35Z,I downloaded this but it won't burn to disc. It says its not a valid image.  Don't take this as gospel though as it may work for others.  I think theres a good chance its the software (the burner built into ubuntu) thats not working. I'm uprgrading pretty soon and will report back
,Dagreed,2008-02-06T13:49Z,"SEED please ! this game is awesome !

,Imok86,2009-03-04T01:34Z,@nofuture4me: nope. the same problem here on Windows. PCSX2 wont load it because its a corrupt image
