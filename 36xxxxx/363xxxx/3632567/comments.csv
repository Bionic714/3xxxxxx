,PhilippaRM,2008-11-08T22:57Z,This one's from 1995. The other one's from 1960
,flatusgass,2011-04-07T09:26Z,"@Vinylon  Umm....IMDB is right. YOU, are wrong. 

There is a 1960 version of this film, and then this newer 1995 version. So what on earth are you going on about?  (and there is also a 1963 film called Children of the Damned)

1981 is a typo, obviously. One of the lead actresses, Meredith Salenger, would only be 11 years old if this film was released in 1981.

Do your homework before making yourself look foolish, mate."
