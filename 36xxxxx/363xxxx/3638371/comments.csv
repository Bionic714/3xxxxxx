,BaCkDrAfT86,2009-05-24T23:29Z,"Has anyone had this running on vista 64 bit?

Ive had a hard copy of this game for years but have never been able to get it to run.  I've installed it on every new system i've got with no joy.

I get to the menu no options show up or the game crashes.  

Any help would be VERY much appreciated.
