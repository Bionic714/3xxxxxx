Read the MIS Info Video 2.5 post. I voted for a 
better UI :D but what do you want? 
new UI, more codecs or more features.

It's cool because you can see a map of voters. 
P.S. Someone voted 2+ times Not cool :( 
I zoomed all the way to see it

The more people use the .MIS, the more chance to get
in a DVD Divx player :D

Info2MIS v2.0.0B10 is free. It's the app's that I 
used to create the .MIS. It can also extract
information from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, 
amazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....

Took me a few seconds with an episode on tv.com(find page)
and only 2 clicks for a movie from imdb.com(with picture)

MIS Info Video v2.5.0 is free (parental control, resume
playback, chapters...). Perfect if you want to block 
access to a 6 year to your movies(horror, action, pr0n).

It's a front end/player. but If you don't like the 
internal player, you can configure your own player.

.MIS is a metadata text file(description, credits, age,

"Building Torrent Descriptions Made Easy with bbcode.txt":
I have made a tutorial for a private site. With this, you
can create a proper description that the admins will like.
They hate, and users too, when the description is frankly 
too small. I have seen just the file name in a NFO with
no codec info or plot... Use this instead. :D 
You can copy it to other forum but [code] may not be 
supported.
