This is a commentary on the Famous Tibetan Pray of Samantabhadra


This text called The Fort of Conduct of The Children of the Buddha Explaining the
Meaning of the Text of the Prayer of the Conduct of Samantabhadra was composed
over a period of fifteen years while acting as a servant and continuously training my
mind in the Lamrim. I organized the previously rough material in a book thinking it
might be beneficial. I took on the effort of producing many copies voluntarily,
printing in both Tibetan and Mongolian languages, keeping the image of my lama in
my mind. Mipham Shenyen acted as a secretary for three years. During that period I
suffered due to severe conditions such as disputes and curses and was not able to
repay the kindness. When the woodblocks were engraved, on the eighth day of the
month of Sakadawa, during the Earth-Tiger year, the venerable Nawang Losang
newly spread the banner of victory of the teachings.
I, bikshu Nawang Pelden with virtuous aspiration and enthusiasm, tolerant and openminded,
committed this noble text to paper.
