,tattooedmermaid,2009-07-05T04:46Z,"cappiz - you are so right and a lot of anime buffs always mistaken this flick for a Miyazaki film and technically its not

""""Little Nemo"" was an American/Japanese joint project, and Miyazaki and Takahata were involved in the pre-production stage during 1982 and 1983. However, due to creative differences with the American producers, both quit the project. It was finally made into a movie with different staff members and released in 1989 in Japan."" - www.nausicaa.net
