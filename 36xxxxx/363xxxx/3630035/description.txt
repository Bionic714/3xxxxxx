A compilation made by the German television station WDR as a tribute to Belgian-born pianist, composer and arranger Francy Boland. There's much to enjoy here, including a version of 'Sax No End' that clocks in at a mere 6 minutes or so, and a far-too-brief reading of 'I Wish I Were In Love Again' by the band and Carmen McRae. Hard swinging big band jazz for those who thus desire.
