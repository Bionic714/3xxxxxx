C&C Generals Zero Hour.

Zero Hour also contains three new campaigns of five missions each, one for each side, with their chronological order being USA first, GLA second, and China last. Unlike the previous campaigns, which were noted by Command and Conquer fans for not having cinema sequences during mission briefing, the Zero Hour campaigns return to that Command and Conquer tradition, each showing a video of a reporter of the respective side giving details about the situation behind the current mission. The plot behind the Zero Hour campaigns picks up where it left off at the end of the previous campaigns.
