i'm dreaming, right?
imagining myself sitting at my computer d/lg this movie with jon voight, ellen burstyn and jeff daniels about souls and such?
and when i wake up, me and the other two souls trying to d/l this are going to laugh and, later in life, meet up somewhere and come up with this screenplay idea...but it'll probably only sell to tv...
stop me if you've heard this one before..."
