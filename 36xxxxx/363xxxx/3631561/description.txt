Based on best-selling author Mitch Alborn's book, this moving TV drama centers on Eddie (Steven Grayham and Jon Voight), who dies at the age of 83, uncertain that he was able to save a girl from a horrible accident and doubting that his life had any significance. In heaven, Eddie meets five souls who, through flashbacks, show him how he affected the lives of others in amazing ways. Ellen Burstyn, Jeff Daniels and Michael Imperioli also star.
