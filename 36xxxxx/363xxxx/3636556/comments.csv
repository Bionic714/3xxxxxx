,HAHA2FUNNY,2007-08-15T00:06Z,Does this really have a trojan?
,neocorpse,2008-01-16T02:36Z,"Be wary, most keygens and cracks will be picked up by AV software. Just by nature of what it does. All you really need to be concerned with is what the name of the file is when it pops up. Most (if not all) trojans will imbed themselves into Windows system folders, so if you think it's a real threat you can scan the entire widows directory. "
