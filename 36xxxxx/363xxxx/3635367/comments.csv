Not really surprising, you're missing the point: they get heated at times to see how you never use your brain, the thing that God gave us to make us different from other animals, and how you're only able to use a set of references you proclaim to be authority, but that are only your own. 
To debate, you're supposed to have a common prerequisite field of understanding, a respect for the other's identity not to say existence AND you have to make a move towards the other by accepting that his point of view is valid, if only for him; if you don't make this move, you're posing yourself as an absolute authority (and frankly, what can make a bug like you think he is one, I wonder). 
In this encounter, never do you show any move to accepting the people you meet just as they are, you only want to show them they're wrong. And since they can never think of a wreck like you as an authority, it can only lead to war...
Maybe one day, you will understand what an outrage it is, what an insult you're making to God by pretending YOU know what He wants, and then, you will repent."

,Squaree,2007-03-10T20:05Z,"I was quite disappointed with these two clips. Dan said ""the confrontation gets heated at times..."", but the clips had none of that. I was curious to hear some real arguments, as opposed to one-sided preaching. 

However, I have a question for you, Dan. It's an old question. The first one to ever raise it in writing (to my knowledge) was Plato. He, of course, did not discuss the christian god, but the homeric ones. Still, the question concerns all who worship a god or gods. A devout christian (I take it you are), perhaps you have already reflected a bit upon this question. In that case, I would be curious as to the fruits of your mind-labour.

The question presupposes that you affirm this statement:

""God says that homosexuality is a sin.""

Given what you've said so far, I feel pretty confident that your belief (and thus you) affirm this statement.  

Now, the question is: Is homosexuality a sin because God says so, or does God say that homosexuality is a sin because homosexuality is a sin?

Either way, it seems, the answer has severe implications as far as the concept of God goes.

Would love to hear your take on it, Dan.

,MrJapan,2007-03-11T11:12Z,Homosexuals should be put to death.  They are endangering our species...
,Squaree,2007-03-11T23:05Z,"Dan, I must have missed the part in the end.

As for your answer, I'm not sure that you can have it both ways. 

Answer no.1:

""Homosexuality is a sin because God says so.""

This answer seems a bit arbitrary. Why should it be a sin just because God says so and because of nothing else? Many cannot understand that, they want to see some sort of other reason for why it should be a sin. That the act of killing another man is a sin is in their view much easier to understand. 

If suddenly, somehow, it dawned upon us that God says that, while eating, holding the fork with your left hand is a sin, would we accept that? The most fanatic (or ""true worshippers"", if you wish) would perhaps accept it, but many others would probably not accept is as it seems not to be grounded in any other reason than God's will (which then just isn't good enough for them).

Answer no.2:

""God says that homosexuality is a sin because it is a sin.""

This answer implies that God is not allmighty. That, in fact, there exist objective moral facts that are not created by God. This view doesn't sit well with the common perception of God; that God created everything (including the moral facts).

So answer no.2 will probably be rejected by most christians. However, if they do reject it they must present a justification for answer no.1. Is it really true that something is a sin just because God says so and not because of anything else?

This position must be defended somehow. If you affirm answer no.1, then you have no recourse to answer no.2. On the other hand, if you accept answer no.2, then this answer, it seems, is incompatible with answer no.1. 

On this view, accepting both answers simultaneously is a deductive error. Without a justification for doing so, it is unintelligible.

But your forum is a much better place for this discussion. I'll post what I have written so far in it.  "
