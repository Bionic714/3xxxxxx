,Deloi,2007-03-29T13:40Z,"I think it would be quicker, with less leechers(about 10-15), and when they are finished( i hope in 1 day), the others can dl the game faster from the 10-15 seeder. But now there are 200 leechers and only 1 seeder, and we have to wait for a month to dl it...
Dangarion, you should ban the leechers, and only allow 10 leecher to dl from you, and the others can dl from him."

Try to find Daemon Tools  (http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/announcements.php

OR

http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Daemon_Tools.htm

OR

http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/


...and after the installation of it you should have a GREEN Thunder ico in your system tray (right-low corner of your screen)

Right-click on the icon to bring up a drop-down menu (well....drop-up menu) 

In Emulation select All options ""ON""

and then at Virtual CD/DVD-ROM/ device...[bla,bla] no media /  mount image  select the .iso file of the game (approx.  4,18 GB)...Leave the wizard load and install the game to your favorite directory.

After the game installation you should read the Wordpad file that I've put in the Patches Folder...

Have a nice Play...and learn - learn - learn - about ""How To Do Stuff In Virtual Life"".....All you have to DO is little more reading...

I don't want to offend you..I just try to shake the waters if you know what I mean...

,cordlessdrill,2007-04-04T11:53Z,"Thanks Dangairon, Ive been wanting this game for a long time.
Tangerine734: the installer never asked for a product key, first game Ive seen like that

I wish this site had forums, but it doesn't, so here goes. This was my first try with this torrent stuff and everything went better than expected.    
I went with the azureus program. I have my upload speed set to unlimited but it won't upload any faster than 40kB/s. My internet is capable of 385kB/s. This makes it hard to build up my share ratio. I currently have 12 peers connected and its a slow go. I been seeding for almost 24 hours straight, and my ratio is only .8
Is there any way to make it go faster?
I pay a lot for internet, I need to get my moneys worth. I dont like uploading at less than dial up speed."
,cordlessdrill,2007-04-04T12:20Z,I just looked at the azureus wiki. It looks like I'm actually doing all right. I guess I'm used to downloading game demos in 10 min. 
,Pro1337,2007-04-04T14:24Z,Seed plz!
,Oblived,2007-04-06T17:18Z,thx dangairon for the game =) No problems at all. btw i figured out my self that winrar was the program to open rar files with before you wrote it :P and everything works absolutely amzing thx again :D
,lassenissen,2007-04-08T01:44Z,"Im just wondering, do you need a cd key or something for it?"
,lassenissen,2007-04-08T11:48Z,"Hey when im about to download it says i dont have enough disc space to download it, the problem is i do have enough disc space. Anyone know whats happening?"
,lassenissen,2007-04-08T12:03Z,I think it says that its not enough room on the The Elder Scrolls 4 OBLIVION.iso file... but isnt it supposed to be a .rar file?
,killerjames,2007-04-08T19:26Z,"Once this thing has finally downloaded, will it work with no hassle, or do I need to mess about doing all sorts of complicated stuff?"
,killerjames,2007-04-08T19:42Z,I would appreciate an answer!
,Dangairon,2007-04-08T20:55Z,"Why don't you guys read the .rtf file with Wordpad?

lassenissen , I think that the .iso file is about 2 Gb...
Did you check your disk space or not?

The .iso files open with DaemonTools or Alcohol and is Not .rar files

...keep questioning if you have anything else in mind

Farewell !!!"
,shammy89,2007-04-08T21:30Z,"Heya,thx to all the seeders and Dangarion

Any info, anywhere...?"
,Okkultus,2007-06-02T12:13Z,"I never really understood why someone uploads a torrent and provides almost no info at all regarding it.
There are some of us out there who want to know more about what we are downloading, and refuse to be blind.
Anyway...no matter."

,Dangairon,2007-07-15T13:14Z,"Hello Guys!!!

RECOMMENDED Hardware!!!
3Ghz Intel Pentium 4
1GB System RAM
ATI X800 series,nVidia GeForce 6800 series or HIGHER VIDEO CARD!!! 

(I actually have a GeForce 6600GT/128MB in my system and the game runs great at 1024x768)

For all of you who complains I must say ONE MORE Time That the files ARE NOT infected with any viruses...I have scaned the files with 3 different antivirus programs (F-Secure,AVG,Nod32) and none of them find anything suspicious...

Next,
I want to tell you about the H E L P file I've put in this torrent. IT DOES NOT TELL ANYWHERE to use the files from the ""extra folder"".

This folder is O N L Y for some guys that know how to use it.

 YOU have to install the game from Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120 or PowerISO....(and I suggest to install it in a hard drive different than C:\Program Files....I use the directory E:\Games\Oblivion\Oblivion.exe for example...) then install the 1.1.511 patch(Oblivion_v1[1].1UKEnglish.exe) in the game directory that contains the oblivion.exe and then extract the files from (....nocd patch 1.1.511/tes4-dtn.rar) to your installation directory...It's so simple...It is NOT good to read that some guys have downloaded the game and play it without any problems and some other guys complain about everything....May be you Don't know how to install a game generally...

Sorry but I can't help you in any way...I'm not computer teacher...

Thank you for your understanding...and for those that currently playing the Game......THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE !!!"

Oblivion will run on any PC with: 1.5GHZ Dual core or above(dual core is more powerfull and therefore makes it equivelent to P4) and Intel's GMA 950 runs well(Even if it is limited to 64MB on the macbook) and for oblivion i would reccommend 2GB Ram for enchanced performence. Also windows Vista IS compatible with it.

Bear in mind that often just having the 'minimum' specifications means the game may not run even slightly smoothly on the lowest graphics settings.

AMD Sempron 3400+ 
2048mb RAM

I should be able to run it."

,Technocian,2007-12-27T05:06Z,The thing about graphical problems. You guys gotta understand that Oblivion is probably one of most demanding if not the most demanding game for the PC out right now. Many top of the line rigs can only run the game on medium settings and still get lag every once in awhile.
