Ys Book I & II for the TurboGrafx CD/Turbo Duo console. US release. ISO/MP3 format with CUE sheets. Not a personal rip, but burned to CD and verified to work. I'm throwing this one up here as finding a torrent, or other download source, for this game on its own seems near impossible. A great alternative if you don't wanna download the 963 meg Ys Complete PC version. One of the best games on the TG16.
