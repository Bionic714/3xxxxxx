I'm trying to get a registered copy of 1.0(unfortunately, .9 version keys don't work with 1.0), unless someone else wants to upload a torrent for a copy."

Try mounting it as an image instead of going directly off the CD.  I have a full Magic Engine and suffer the same problem if I burn CD's of these games."
,SoheiFox,2008-11-27T00:10Z,.. I just noticed:  The proper size for an image of this game is about 400 megs.  The reason why you're not getting music and cinema screens has nothing to do with your emulkator; you're missing all the audio tracks.  I'll go ahead and seed my Y's Book 1 and 2 in a few days.
