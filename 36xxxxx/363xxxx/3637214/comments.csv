,Iceburgslim,2007-03-11T22:13Z,"Shortest seed in the history of PB.

1 minute 17 seconds.

What is the problem with getting this movie?  Road Hogs was out the next day and was seeded like crazy.  And that movie was a suck-fest!!!"
,Agentk88,2007-03-11T23:26Z,WTF??? is this another fake isohunt is only seeding fakes ????
,Windsong1,2007-03-12T01:31Z,Dudes this is too weird. pb just did a upgrade to the data base . there is no tracker and no seed for this torent but I am download at 75Kb and Azureus client says everything is fine. a green light all the peers are uploading at about the same speed we should all become seeds about the same time. is this something new?
,Windsong1,2007-03-12T02:21Z,"well spoke to soon now everybody is at 22.6 waiting for a seed to pop up . sorry bout that but it would have been nice to have a seedless torrent ,but somebody has to have a complete file..... :("
,BlackOps1941,2007-03-12T03:14Z,"Am downloading right now, will report back on how good the quality.  I'll seed this sucker 24/7 for a while until we get some more seeds here."
,BlackOps1941,2007-03-12T03:15Z,Ugh... hit 22.6% and d/l speed went from 150 kb/s to about 5 kb/s... damn.
,Humpie,2007-03-12T06:58Z,even if it was real 212 megs would be sheer and utter terrible quality. 
,Straticus,2007-03-12T12:21Z,"so far, I have downloaded 2 fakes of this film...the worst was labeled www.leecherslair.com....Get this shit...I went to their board, and posted that the movie was a fake and that it needed to be fixed or removed...Know what their solution was? To kick/ban my IP LOL...sounds like a REAL classy crew...there's another labeled FLAMES...another bullshit fake...I think this is the first time ever SO many people wanting a film, and nothing but fakes being uploaded...well, I guess we'll just have to wait a few days, because I'm sure as FUCK not going to download a film that's only 212 mb as the quality (if it's even complete) would be worthless...Has ANYONE gotten a torrent of this yet that isn't fake and semi-decent quality?? If so, please tell us!

Strat"
,pigeonsmilk,2007-03-12T14:07Z,Most are fakes or piss poor quality. It's just best to wait for better versions.
,TheGamerrr,2007-03-13T00:12Z,you guys should take your asses down to the movie house to see this.  I have and its well worth it 100 times over. downloading doesn't do it justice. 
,Straticus,2007-03-13T00:21Z,"I already saw it in the theatre...now, I just want it for my collection :)"
,Adr.,2007-03-13T01:57Z,"Hey guys , i dont understand why , continue to download and upload this if i sayed in my first post that was a problem while i have upload this torrent 
STOP seeding and downloading , i will upload another torrent!

Ps:sorry for my poor english....."
,Straticus,2007-03-13T16:33Z,"I'm downloading the Canal Street release...it appears to be 100% legit...download is nearly done, and I'll let you guys know how it is..."
,cool_jay,2007-03-13T18:37Z,"Please duudes, canÂ´t u even wait for like 1 week ????!!!!! 

In  1 week i can almoust promisse u guys that this GREAT movie will be out in avi. and fucking DVD FORMAT !!!   

SO HAVE A LITTLE PAITENT PLEASE ?????"
,SeedPlz69,2007-03-13T21:27Z,Can someone who is past 96.8% Seed??? There is about 50 people stuck at this point. Thanks...
,phanatic9,2007-03-14T00:38Z,You will totally ruin this movie if u watch some lame ass screener.  go pay the 10 bucks and see it as it was meant to be.  this movie is so bad ass and deserves the respect it needs
,Straticus,2007-03-14T04:35Z,"Playing the Canal Street release now...well, the most I can say for it is that it's legit...the quality is really bad...bad frame rate, going in and out of focus, shit color...fuck it...waiting for a better release"
,lamecomputer,2007-03-14T05:26Z,"I don't understand why I keep reading peoples comments about paying for the movie and how it's worth the money. The fact that they got this far means that they were interested in this torrent. Plus, I DID see it in the theatres, now I want to see it at home. Like Warner Brothers is struggling these days anyway."
,rupert_burgerboy,2007-03-14T13:59Z,Downloading right now... its quite fast which makes me think it may be a fake. Also it keeps getting stuck! is this natural?
,Tinface,2007-06-27T21:44Z,Do you think this would look alright on an Ipod? Because you know...2.5 inch screen's aren't really all that well detailed...
