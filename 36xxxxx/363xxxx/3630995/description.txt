Transfz (pronounced transfuse) is an integrated search agent and clipboard extender, it allows the user to launch online searches from any document or application on both the desktop and the web.

* Quickly launch a lookup in any online dictionary, searchengine..etc. through the Global Menu (ctrl+d).

* Extend the clipboard; insert text by selecting among the last 5-30 entries of copied text, an immense time saver for professional users.

* Perform powerful macro editing by using the Extensions, allowing for an example direct text manipulation in ANY editable text form (i.e. perform search and replace on selected text in a webmail browser session).

* Improve Transfz's search capacity by using the build-in Plugin Creator to easily allow your favorite searchengine to become an omnipresent standard in your desktop/web experience.
