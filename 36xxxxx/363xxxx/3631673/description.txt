This film is comedic genius! 
Martin and Candy were never better than they are in this film. Every scene in is fantastic and hilarious. You obviously have the classic scenes 'those aren't pillows', Martin trying to hire a car at the airport and the both of them sharing a car before it ends up going on fire. 
When you look at the so called comedies Martin makes nowadays it is pretty safe to say that this was his last great performance. 
I have lost count of the amount of times I have watched this film but the one thing that amazes me is that no matter how many times you watch it you still laugh at the same scenes. 
Its a shame that Martin and Candy never got to make any more films as they played off each other perfectly and maybe thats what makes the film so special.
