Hideo Kojima's Snatcher: A Cyberpunk Adventure
One of the best games ever made (in my opinion).

If you've never played this game: play it.
If you have played it: get others to play it.
It's an experience like no others.

Ripped from original disk by my good self.

RARed
MDF and MDS files

Requires:
Gens or another Sega CD emulator
Sega CD bios files (google for them- this only uses the European bios)

Instructions (for Gens, other emulators should be the same):
1) UnRAR
2) Configure BIOS files in emulator if needed.
3) Go to file: Open rom
4) Make sure you select "all files" in 'type of file'
5) Open "SNATCHER.MDF"

Alternatively, you could mount the image on a virtual drive or burn it onto a disk and select "Boot Disk" in the emulator.

I hope you enjoy this great game!
