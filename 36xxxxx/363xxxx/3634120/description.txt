Like many been waiting for, Hiro gets his sword, Mohinder finds out who Sylar really are and lots of lose ends gets tied together. opens a lot of opportunities for next week episode with Clair's discovery who her real family was. people been waiting long time for a meeting between Sylar and peter recently with peters "new" abilities. Andos return wasn't very surprising but still happy that he did it at this time, no Hiro without Ando at his side. Mr Bennet who has been getting a new face in the last few episodes, and is not really the evil type people been accusing him to be lately and looks like he is in seriously trouble now. 

With the help of Janice they were able to find out that he knew about Clarie even after losing his memory. Isacc seems not to really know what to do, being heartbroken after shooting his recently separated Girlfriend.

One of the best episodes in the Heroes series in a while and Tim Kring keeps open up unexpected openings for surprising events, can only hope this series keeps up this quality in the future.
