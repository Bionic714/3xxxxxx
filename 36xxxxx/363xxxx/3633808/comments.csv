,Erik255,2007-03-06T22:34Z,Hm. How come I see zero seeds? I finally succeeded in uploading the torrent; do I need to do more?
,Erik255,2007-03-07T08:05Z,"OK, thanks, but I kinda figured that out, but how the f... do I do that? Sorry to be a pain - I swear I read the faq. It doesn't show in the Azureus-window. 

Am I the only one to think the Azureus-Wiki is not much help? For an amateure, I normally consider myself quite savvy with new applications, but this torrent-business is really complicated for such a simple operation. I can imagine a lot of people give up on seeding."
,Erik255,2007-03-07T08:32Z,"OK, I'll once more from the start. Don't dl this."
,Erik255,2007-03-08T16:05Z,"Maybe it DOES work. Give it a try. Good pics, no watermarks, no logos."
