,theduke84,2007-03-03T22:16Z,"I will later upload it to the other sites but I will wait to see a few seeders first. This way, all will be able to see it and won't have to see 0 seeders on the other trackers.

Tomorrow  you could do upload it to sites that I did not know. 

Thanks"
[M],chkin,2007-03-03T22:18Z,"Thanks, you rock :)"
,Namielus,2007-03-03T22:21Z,"omg please seed! stop tormenting me, I have waited to loong already :D"
,theduke84,2007-03-03T22:25Z,"lol
I'm 100% seeding this for now. I ""sense"" a strange force in the torrent. People are happy and jumping on it like rabbit. 

It's here so be patient my fellow Day Break fan :D"
,.TakaM,2007-03-03T22:26Z,"Oh thank you god!
stayed up all night for this!"
,sutzuki13,2007-03-03T22:39Z,"bravo !!! thank you ,very very much! "
,kin,2007-03-03T23:49Z,"just released to the site, and already no seeders? I've been waiting for this so long, and now i'm being snatched from it because of no seeders..."
,theduke84,2007-03-03T23:58Z,"I'm seeding but alone for now. Be patient. :D
You should get something from the other leechers if you don't see me.

Someone started uploading it elsewhere. Many show 0 seeders with 220+ leechers. I just hope people would had waited a bit before.  Some tracker hide it but some, luckily show it. "
,death734,2007-03-04T00:35Z,2.25 hours to get seeders on a public tracker is not that bad anyway. normally expected for a popular show.
,theduke84,2007-03-04T00:59Z,"My up speed double a few weeks ago from 30 to 60 k/s. :D

I would like more but the line(dsl) has too many errors on it. Cable is capped or cost much more for uncapped.
Speeking of cable: they testing 100Mbit but not word on up speed or cost. "
,gazcoo,2007-03-04T09:11Z,"finally! thanks, too bad this show has to end though."
,ilianasta,2007-03-04T12:13Z,Fantastic
,agitatr,2007-03-05T00:03Z,"Cheers for this, dude. Shame to see the end of such a great show.

Oh, and a big fuck you to ABC for the complete shambles in dealing with the show, first cancelling it in favour of repeats, and then dicking us all about in getting the rest of the episodes online."
,coprod,2007-03-19T16:27Z,Can't get this file to play when using subtitles (srt-file). Anyone who knows why? All the other 12 episodes work fine. A solution would be appreciated.
