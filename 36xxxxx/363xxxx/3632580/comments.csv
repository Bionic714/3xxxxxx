Initially scared off by the missing bit, I then took my chances with the torrent, to find there's a whole world of seeders who were actually leeches waiting ""for the last bit"" they didn't really need; so when I got to the 99.9%, I just went and burnt the disk, and it worked, my point being - THANKS, MATE.
