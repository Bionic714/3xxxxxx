,stapler101,2007-03-12T12:46Z,"Help a newbie! I am a brand new Mac user and I am lost!
When I download the origninal game I get the following:
Call of Duty (cod) 2 1.3 (k) dmg
COD 2 1.3 update
COD 2 sn txt
COD 2.dMg
and this new crack COD2 v1.3 nodvduub.crack

would someone give me a step-by-step install.
I keep getting the message that cod is not correctly installed, need cd, can't patch file,etc.
I don't think I know how to do the first install.

thanks for any help!"
,zeagull,2007-03-12T18:53Z,"stapler101, congrats on getting a mac :) 
My friend was having problems with cracking application, he had the same files and was doing the same steps that I did. Nothing worked, so I just zipped the app I had (already cracked) and made a torrent. 

You should be able to just copy the COD2 folder to your applications, then replace the application with this file. Good luck."
,stapler101,2007-03-12T22:56Z,"No matter what I do, I get the ""need original cd"" error.
I want my PC back!!
Just kidding, I am just so used to the pc that I am just going in circles trying this install."
,treemaker,2007-03-13T16:35Z,error: can't find resources folder... do you have this too?
,mckani7,2007-06-26T13:35Z,"seed plx :) downloaded the game already, just need this file to make it work "
,eruin,2007-11-29T18:44Z,great! I've seeded this thing to death and eagerly awaiting the completion of cod2 itself. any chance you have the cracked mp app around?
,dc4everyone,2007-12-02T12:23Z,"Thanks for posting this file.  Can I ask, was the v1.3 patch applied prior to the crack being run? ie: is this a cracked 1.3 app or the original?"
,dc4everyone,2007-12-02T12:44Z,Never mind. Just replaced my v.13 install with this file and it works just fine.
,CharlesRS6,2007-12-14T04:32Z,"anyone know some good hacked servers and how to put them in... i have the call of duty 2 multiplayer open and when i try to join a server it says ""key code in use"" how do i connect to the hacked servers???? and which are some good ones cause i cant seem to find any"
,MOkaTemoku,2008-01-12T07:55Z,"this crack is usefull with Leopard. and a MACBook 2.2Ghz

Thanks.
"
,MOkaTemoku,2008-01-12T07:56Z,you need just replace the original with this and it ask for serial. after that bum you can play.

,thabrandnew007,2008-02-05T06:40Z,"Hintzsche, this crack, along with what seems like countless others (including cs3), uses old versions of the ssl and crypto libraries, and Leopard apparently only installs PPC versions of these libs. So in your favorite Terminal, move the old versions of these libraries out of the way:

$ cd /usr/lib
$ sudo cp libcrypto.0.9.dylib libcrypto.0.9.dylib.old
$ sudo cp libssl.0.9.dylib libssl.0.9.dylib.old
$ sudo ln -sf libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib libcrypto.0.9.dylib

,Enemy04,2008-04-23T20:27Z,"GUYS LISTEN DO THIS..

1. Mount [Open] the ""Call of Duty 2.dmg""
2. Drag folder ""Call of Duty 2"" to your desktop
3. Now open the update dmg thing and update it to 1.3 version
4. Then open the crack, if it doesnt work..
5. Go to applications/utilities/terminal.app
6. IN TERMINAL TYPE:

cd /usr/lib
sudo cp libcrypto.0.9.dylib libcrypto.0.9.dylib.old
sudo ln -sf libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib libcrypto.0.9.dylib

The commands are safe, the problem is the ipatcher doesn't find a certain thing. It should work!

6. Open the game and have fun!
