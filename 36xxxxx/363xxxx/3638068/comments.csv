,gregersamsa,2007-03-13T02:01Z,Is it only me having some problems with the checksum on this one? Isn't there suppossed to be just one more file in the archive? Just asking... Quality seems fine though :-D
,sweatyrich,2007-03-13T11:41Z,"Real fast download - Nice!
Sound is fine - no buzz like the orenji release.

Picture quality ain't great, but that's not down to THIS particular release, it's the whole series.
Guess I'm used to watching the HD versions of Lost/24 etc these days :-("
,sweatyrich,2007-03-13T11:43Z,"Oh, and forgot to mention - NO problems at all downloading or extracting the RARs with WinRAR (v3.20)
Cheers!"

,amra66,2007-03-18T19:11Z,"Yes, I've downloaded a couple of versions of episode 18 now and have had problems. There seems to be one file missing. Everything uncompresses fine, but when played in Quicktime only the first 7 seconds plays."
