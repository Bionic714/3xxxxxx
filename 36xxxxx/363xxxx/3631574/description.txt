this plug-in is the main reason why I use Firefox.

it blocks those annoying ads on the net. 

it's automatically updated by volunteers and makes visiting
many websites a lot more relaxing.

just drop-n-drag the .XPI file into your firefox window.

dutch: dus ook marktplaats.nl en nrc.nl zonder reclame !

a quick way is also to modfiy your HOSTS file which has been added as well.

Just copy HOSTS to your C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC

if you use hotmail you'll notice the effects immediately.
