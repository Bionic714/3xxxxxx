Lara St.John -  re: Bach.


"Check out this adventurous disc featuring bold and innovative arrangements of the music of J.S. Bach that reframe it in new soundscapes that draw on jazz, world and pop influences. The recording brings Lara together with English composer/producer Magnus Fiennes and arranger Brian Gascoigne, along with such unusual guest artists as the Indian tabla virtuoso Trilok Gurtu and pedal steel guitar legend B.J. Cole. For Sony Classical, Lara will record both core classical and contemporary crossover."
