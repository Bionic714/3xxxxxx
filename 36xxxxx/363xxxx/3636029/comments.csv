,DeadGame,2007-03-10T19:14Z,YOU MUST RENAME EVERY SINGLE FILE CORRECTLY IN ORDER TO GET THIS TO WORK
,Sussu,2007-03-11T05:37Z,"No need to rename, just open .001 file in WinRar, works like a charm. Thx for the movie!"
,scottentot,2007-03-11T19:31Z,"thanks a lot sussu, the fix you suggested works fine. "
,xaumin,2007-04-22T01:21Z,ThereÂ´s no sound.
,canadacowboy,2007-08-23T18:07Z,I've tried winrar it does not work. What do you rename them to. What extension is it after you finally get it to open .avi????
