[T],Knaster,2007-03-04T11:25Z,why do u link to moviex it does nothing
,fuzznutz84,2008-04-07T12:36Z,Actually it takes you to another torrent site dedicated mainly for movies. There are stated rules and registration is free. Let me guess... you didn't wait for the page 2 load? Wow. It takes skill to screw up clicking on a link. lol

,zarathustra2k1,2008-07-06T01:55Z,"Actually 'fuzznuts', the moviex tracker address in these torrents is blocked by PeerGuardian as MALWARE!

What these fuckers are doing is STEALING your bandwidth for their own registered users. You will not receive ONE BYTE of data from them, you're just used as an uploading zombie for their own private usage.

Either:
(i) get Peerguardian (& the Bluetack 'Level 1' blocklist), or 
(ii) remove this insidious entry from ANY torrent you find it in...

Hope this helps,

Cheers,

And if there's anything to be afraid of it's PeerGuardian
BTW the torrent is dead at moviex"
