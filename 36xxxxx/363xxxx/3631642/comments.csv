,Muhaja,2007-03-04T11:09Z,"Branstrom.... how have you been able to miss all the other series of Star Trek uploaded by Mr_Fear under DVDR?
It is correct to upload it under DVDR. Now stop complaining before someone starts calling you names."
,Kundalini,2007-03-04T11:42Z,"Thank you :)
It is a DVD so it is correct.
TV is only TVrip"

,kenny999,2007-03-04T21:51Z,"Branstrom I trust the torrents here on TPB are dealt by the source from which they are created, not by genre.
Mr_Fear thank you :-) Just two seasons of TNG to go. And then... ;-) [stories from delta quadrant?]"
,Valcon,2007-03-05T05:53Z,Thank!!!
,prinsbernh,2007-03-05T20:03Z,"Mr. Fear, I really hope you continue with this series despite the fact that there's another person uploading ST TNG dvd's. I'm downloading this because of the Dutch subs and the Dutch subs are only on your uploaded dvd's. So keep please keep uploading your stuff.

Thanks for this great series."

,Iddiz,2007-03-06T10:50Z,"Thanks Mr_Fear, i hope you still will upload the entire TNG-series, dispite the fact that some retard is uploading TNG aswell.

Your uploads is the best ones, keep it up!"
,kenny999,2007-03-06T21:13Z,"Iddiz why retard?? He is ST fan just like you and me and Mr_Fear and anybody else who participates on the sharing. He will stop TNG and will start DS9, fyi.
Mr_Fear thank you again, and please go ahead with S6D2."
,Iddiz,2007-03-06T21:51Z,"Well, it's just upset me that he just interups Mr_Fears good work with uploading the TNG-series. Why don't he go back to seeding ""his"" DS9-series instead, that way we can enjoy all ST-series.. I guess I just ""rushed"" that comment, I'll take it back, I don't wanna complain to those who upload the ST-series, I just think it was stupid of him to do it, I wonder what the thinked he would gain on it?

Plz continue with S6D2 Mr_Fear. 
Regards/Iddiz"
