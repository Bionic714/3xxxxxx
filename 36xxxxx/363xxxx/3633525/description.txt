Everybodys Got To Learn Sometime
--------------------------------

"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime" may very well be the most compelling film yet outlining the disturbing and heavily censored facts associated with the worst terrorist attacks in American history. And while a grassroots movement worldwide continues to grow, and demand answers to the growing number of unanswered questions, the public outcry for accountability and transparency makes this film, perhaps, the most important film of 2006.

"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime" is a free movie, produced by an independent artist, for educational and journalistic purposes only. Any proceeds derived from this premier event will go towards allaying the costs of presenting this film in the light of day, in New York City, in what is left of a free America in Tribeca.

Largely ignored by the mainstream media, many of the disturbing facts surrounding the attacks of 9/11 raise deeply ethical questions associated with issues of accountability, justice and censorship in America.

The question is no longer 'Was 9/11 an inside job?' Now, the question is 'To what extent was 9/11 an inside job, and how?'
