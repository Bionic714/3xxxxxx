,ublueskyu,2008-07-16T16:59Z,fake
,IgnobleAssassin,2008-07-18T06:44Z,"Considering the movie only came out Wednesday in Australia, I can't imagine there's a DVDrip already."
,Licurgo,2008-07-18T10:12Z,"i not fake, but is not the batman movie, is other movie with the same name"
,h4ns0l0,2008-07-19T04:41Z,"Just got back from the theater, Batman Begins was better as it was based on the Frank Miller storyline from BM Year One GN. Gotta say that I found the story line a bit too convenient at points and too twisted for belief in others. Good Move but the first BM Begins movie was superior."
,fierman,2008-07-19T19:44Z,Don't be stupid all. This movie has NOTHING to do with the Batman movie in theaters at this moment. Just read the fucking description and the upload date first before you start commenting.
,maan1234,2008-08-20T19:56Z,It's uploaded a year ago... should be a big clue ;-)
