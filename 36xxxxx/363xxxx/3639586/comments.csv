,mitzerebb,2007-03-20T09:15Z,This is wonderful ... but I am also having trouble rewriting the Proof.xml file. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ...  :)
,mitzerebb,2007-03-20T09:52Z,"Scratch that -- I figured it out. 
Kept getting 'invalid path' messages, so I saved the rewritten XML file in a different location, then copied and pasted it into the Proof.en folder. Worked like a charm.
Thank you!!"
