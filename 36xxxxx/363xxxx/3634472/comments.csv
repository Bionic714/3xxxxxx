,Lonewolftom,2007-03-10T09:32Z,"60% of the songs on this album are not ""Hip Hop Classics"" they are just mainstream shit. Previous releases where better than this.

For a Hip Hop fan this is not what you want, for a n00b this is what you want.

,Ockeojoj,2007-03-12T23:31Z,"Well a classic sorta suggests that the song has been around for some time. A song release half a year ago can't be a classic.

It's got nothing to do with taste, it's just that no one knows if it's going to be around 10 years from now - which is the real proof of a true classic!"

You cannot say a classic made half a year ago cannot be a classic. Classics in all art forms do not get branded that after a certain time... they are made like that, ""born"" like that. 

They are timeless. 

Loved from the moment they are completed, until the end of time! Thats a classic."
