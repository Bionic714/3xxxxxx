 	-The Look of Film-
 	There are dramatic differences between the color, tints and look of film and video.
 	Film cinematographers use a number of devices, such as filters and lenses that allow them to 
 	control and alter the color or "feel" of the subject matter they capture. The look of 
 	film is also different for much more technical reasons.film captures images by exposing 
 	light to silver crystals while a video camera captures the light reflected off digital 
 	chips the result is that film and video have different tonal qualities. Typically video 
 	has harsher edges and less dynamic range, where as film tends to be softer and more organic. 
 	All of the Magic Bullet products let you add some of the natural qualities of film or approximate 
 	them to improve the look of your video
