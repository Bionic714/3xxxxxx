,Tournesol,2007-03-12T10:26Z,"no, it's more of a political and personal message from Langer, there's no mention of religion"
,Tournesol,2007-03-12T11:15Z,"here's a sample of the lyrics to give you an idea of what the song's about:

Turn off the evening news
It is nothing but pollution
Reclaim your right to choose
And choose your own solution"
,Tournesol,2007-03-12T11:31Z,"and to give you an even better idea, here's the chorus:

This is the breaking news: 
You will not lose by trusting your neighbour
Hope is not fading away
Despite what they say
In all of the papers"
