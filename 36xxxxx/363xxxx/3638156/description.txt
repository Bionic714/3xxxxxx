Here is a complete CD RIP of the ORIGINAL RADEON 8500 DRIVERS.  I thought I lost this disk and until now, and I have never been able to find them online.  After installing them only update the DRIVER, and keep the original ATI CONTROL PANEL. (It uses WAY less ram and works WAY better than the new one, I mean hey, it WAS made strictly for the 8500 right?).

ENJOY~~!!!
