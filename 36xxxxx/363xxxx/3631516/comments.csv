,Handonam,2007-03-05T00:05Z,"Does this have instructions on actually achieving MCE2005 + the Rollup 2 update?  I've installed the other MCE torrents, and all i was left with was a plain XP install.  Doesn't have the MCE program to mess around with.  The theme was also just regular XP, and not the MCE theme.

Unless the other sones are supposed to work, let me know what i'm doing wrong :(.  It seems like it never asks for the second disc"
,icp4life4420,2007-03-05T01:57Z,"yes this will give you the mce app itself and the mce theme.

also i made it so its in all 1 disc. needs to be a dvd though. but as long as the disc you burn it on is not dirty installation will be fine. you will have mce."
,icp4life4420,2007-03-05T02:06Z,also can everyone help out me by seeding. because you all know that my upload rate is really slow and this is a laptop and i need the internet for other things so if everyone uploaded it at like 5kbps or something just so it stays a healthy torrent. thank you
,icp4life4420,2007-03-05T18:47Z,ya right i got the disc from a friend and i scanned it before i seeded it and its not infected with anything. so get a like  badboy4ever
,icp4life4420,2007-03-05T18:51Z,and anyways i dont think you could have got the whole file iv'e only uploaded 542 mb out of 804 and im the only seeder. so i think your just trying to be a jerk.
