avi files & other media formats (mp3, pdf, etc.) are really only exploitable through the software used to view or play them, and when exploits are found in such software they are usually patched within hours.

Watching this video will only infect you with a virus known to the world as TOLERANCE which might (if you're lucky) decrease your ability to be a complete and utter DOUCHEBAG."
