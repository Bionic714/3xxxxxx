,ArrGee2008,2008-09-25T16:22Z,"I'm probably being completely thick here, but I need some help.  I have downloaded this but don't know how to install the codecs or view this in anyway. Could someone kindly guide me through step-by-step please (from the point that the download finshed)?  Thanks in advance."
