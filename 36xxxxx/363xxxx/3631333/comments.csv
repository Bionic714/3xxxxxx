,paul_prema,2007-04-19T09:18Z,"in my opinion the shows featuring this guy bear grylls is a total disgrace to anything even closely related to outdoor survival. some of the things he does (like climbing down a waterfall at close to freezing temperatures and then jumping into the water below without knowing if there are any rocks there) just to ""save time"" (or rather, to make a cool, spectacular and watchable show) is absolutely irresponsible. ray mears, for example, would never do such a thing - neither would you find such ideas in ANY serious book on outdoors skill. watch, but watch carefully, and if you've got some experience with outdoors skills this series will give you a great laugh as well as some worrying thoughts :)"
,bossberge,2007-05-07T20:05Z,there's only one episode. where's the rest?
,akla,2007-05-09T00:16Z,"paul_prema IÂ´m with you. This man is dangerous. The show should be named ""The best way to get killed in the outdoors"". One of the most important thing is to conserve energy in a survival situation, not running around like a mad man. One more thing, why does he get dirty in the face all the time. Even when he sleep in a snow cave without fire, strange."
,TraktorLeif,2007-05-16T17:53Z,Seed ?! PLZ
,felix222,2007-07-05T10:57Z,"Maybe he takes too much risk sometimes, but one thing is true: he reached the summmit of the Mount Everest, and returned alive.
So he is surely not an amateur. "
,clonestyle,2008-04-19T16:27Z,"He's also a fraud that slept in motels while filming a bunch of his shows that made it look like he camped out there himself.  If you want a real survival show, watch Survivorman by Les Stroud or Ray Mears's work.  Much more believable without relying on shock TV like eating live snakes or drinking your own pee."
,942davies,2008-09-23T14:14Z,"You freaks have nothing to worry about because i doubt you leave your front door, The idea of the show is to show you how to survive if the worse did happen, and for most of you complainers the worse that could happen to you is your morning papper not being delivered"
,ufcaza,2008-10-21T18:29Z,Well said 942 davies.
,thewatcher2012,2008-10-30T14:32Z,"I agree, its only a show! Bear deals with worst case scenarios, like using a dead animal carcass as shelter in a sandstorm. It isn't the same as Ray Mears so don't treat it as such. Its Entertainment with an informative edge - nothing more."
,yazi2,2009-03-15T15:03Z,"Why do people watch this phony bastard?

Just google what a phony this this lame loser is. If your planning on surviving on the info this loser teaches you you better take a visa card and a cell phone.
