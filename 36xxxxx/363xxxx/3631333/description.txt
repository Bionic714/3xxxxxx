Thirty odd years ago a feisty little infant made his presence felt in the Grylls household.
The family nicknamed him Bear, the name kind of stuck and, boy, did he live up to it.

Bear Grylls' latest venture consists of parachuting into some of the most inhospitable
terrain on Earth, from dense rainforest to frozen mountains to scorching desert, equipped
with nothing but the clothes he is wearing. He must use only his own strength, courage and
survival skills to get out.

Bear is a cross between Ray Mears and Rambo, with a little bit of the Jackass crowd thrown in!
