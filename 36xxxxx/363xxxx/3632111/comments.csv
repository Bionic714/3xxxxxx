,<unknown>,2007-09-22T18:33Z,"Witch file? The file you download from here you shall open with for example µtorrent ( www.utorrent.com ).
Or Do you mean how to open the image file? Then you have to download Daemon Tools. Search for it on google!

Then you can run the game
!! Wiiii!!"

Used DAEMON Tools to emulate, setup file error

,Pkshadow,2007-10-28T08:08Z,"***ISO is Corrupted ******
Further to the folder Game is corrupted and will not open. It registers as 0bytes when it should hold the game files of 173megs if not more since this is the Gold.
I know as I own both AOE and expansion and mine will not work anymore though can get into the files.
If I can combine mine and this I will make a iso and upload.
Do not keep fingers crossed though.

***ISO is Corrupted ******"
