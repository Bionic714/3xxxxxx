Eight lessons giving you the basics of Munster Irish.

"Pimsleur Irish Language program is an efficient audio training system
designed to teach spoken Irish language communication skills to English
speakers within a very short period of training.  The Pimsleur Irish audio
program uses a natural mode of interactive communication -- questions
and answers; statements and rejoinder; give and take -- beginning with
the most-frequently-utilized vocabulary native speakers use in their
everyday conversations with each other.  These are the most useful words
and structures every language learner needs to insure communication. It
is like having a personal tutor."
