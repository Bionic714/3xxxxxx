In this new History of the World, Roberts has revised his monumental previous work, History of the World, taking into account the great range of events and discoveries that have altered our views on everything from early civilizations to post-Cold War globalism. The mapping has been brought up to date and large portions of text rewritten. With his powerful vision and voice, Roberts succeeds in conveying the staggering diversity of human experience.
