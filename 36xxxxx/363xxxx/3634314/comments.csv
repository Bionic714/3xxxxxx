,ThunderV,2008-08-22T07:53Z,"Very nice. Stuff like this is hard to come by (as far as normal files are concerned). Unlike the super saturation of adult material out there.
Good show."
,TheBigHase,2008-12-01T16:20Z,"I'm looking for the Theme of the ""MegaMan"" TV - Cartoon - Show as seen on German TV. It's a fast Technorhythm and a female voice only sings ""MegaMan"" .... few times and at end .."" Supersonic Robot -MegaMan"" - maybe some one has that - kinda liked that! It wasn't in your stuff but maybe u know what I mean and you even got  that!? ;-)"
