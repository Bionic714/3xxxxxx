,Ffejzilla,2007-05-09T04:19Z,"mp3 @ 128kbps

Quality not bad...not great.  I really can't complain, there are no other uploads..."

,Hugah,2008-01-04T04:08Z,soon as i download ill seed... just seed oit now for me please =]
,Sempai_x,2008-02-11T18:30Z,"People should definitely NOT start using flac :|

Thanks for the up."
,tkoger,2008-04-17T01:07Z,Seed PLZ
,dfdeadlock,2008-05-02T23:37Z,"Why is no one seeding a full copy of the information. 
I know it came out at least a year ago, Maybe more. 
Its been out so long i bought a copy and had it stolen already. 
where are the torrents?"
,GN85,2008-05-27T19:26Z,"People SHOULD start using flac. We're not in 1999 here, downloading cheap ass 128 kbps low quality music with a 10-50 mbit/s connection is a waste of bandwidth."
,ajohnson1983,2008-06-07T09:43Z,"only problem with flac isnt the bandwith, its the need to get an external drive after a couple cd's"
,kent_finell,2008-08-06T09:34Z,The biggest problem is that flac isn't supported by most portable music devices...
,Meddi_the_Strong,2008-09-04T05:45Z,Next guy talking about flac is gonna get raped. Fuck flac. Fluc sucks your mother's untouched pun.
,dawg-gone-it-boy,2008-09-05T22:51Z,"oh man, get the flac outta here!"
,dawg-gone-it-boy,2008-09-05T22:54Z,i flunked flac
[T],fuckthesystem1,2008-10-27T12:57Z,"flac is useful because it can be converted into a nice, 320kbps mp3"
,y0ul053,2008-11-07T13:55Z,"who cares about flac, need a couple singles from Beck!  discography my ass!"
,wontgetfooledagain1,2009-01-03T12:21Z,I FLAC'ed your mother.
,wontgetfooledagain1,2009-01-03T12:23Z,"By the way, if you want a REAL Beck discography... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4496274/Beck_-_discography_(14_albums)"
,kmisa18,2009-01-08T03:04Z,thank youuu
,dm30001,2009-05-10T05:38Z,rofl screw flac...its called an E Q U A L I Z E R...i have shiiiiity headphones and the E Q U A L I Z E R makes it pretty much perfect sounding even at 96kbps
