Release Notes:

The name Relient K has always been synonymous with some of the most contagious
power pop/punk rock, tongue in cheek songwriting and feel good fun anyone could
ever ask for. But since the bandΓÇÖs infancy, there has also been an upward
evolution that includes tighter musicianship, increased songwriting smarts and a
high-octane stage show regarded by fans at sold out shows from coast to coast.
Just trace the progression from the bandΓÇÖs tracksuit wearing days on 2000ΓÇÖs
self-titled release to the plethora of puns on their breakthrough sophomore
release The Anatomy of the Tongue and Cheek to the Billboard Top 200 album
charting Two Lefts DonΓÇÖt Make a RightΓÇªBut Three Do (#38 street week debut) and
itΓÇÖs evident that Relient K thrive on raising the bar with each release.

Their latest offering MMHMM is no exception demonstrating yet another building
block upon the groupΓÇÖs reliable recipe. ΓÇ£ThereΓÇÖs been a natural progression from
the first onto the second, third and now the fourth record,ΓÇ¥ notes drummer Dave
Douglas. ΓÇ£The change has come incrementally with each disc. I donΓÇÖt feel like
weΓÇÖre taking a drastic number of turns, but the direction keeps shifting for the
better.ΓÇ¥

The reunion with longtime producer Mark Townsend comes at a time when lines are
being blurred between the post hardcore, post punk and peak emo movements,
making Relient KΓÇÖs original output level especially attention grabbing. Such
sounds are amplified all the more courtesy of mixers Tom Lord-Alge (U2, The
Rolling Stones, Oasis) on ΓÇ£The One IΓÇÖm Waiting For,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£High of 75,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£My
GirlΓÇÖs Ex-Boyfriend,ΓÇ¥ and J.R. McNeely (UnderOath, Project 86, Demon Hunter ) on
the rest of the tracks. ΓÇ£I feel like with this record when weΓÇÖre rocking heavy,
weΓÇÖre rocking heavier than we ever have and when weΓÇÖre letting up with low key
moments, itΓÇÖs more mellow then weΓÇÖve done in the past. WeΓÇÖre hitting our peaks
correctly and all the angles are really paying off,ΓÇ¥ says Thiessen.

As for the messages behind such sparse pre-production sessions, Thiessen turned
to the basic root of his personality, a combination of satire and seriousness
that runs the gamut between relationships, geography, faith and the weather.
ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs my personality to be cheesy and tell dumb jokes,ΓÇ¥ he admits. ΓÇ£For the last
four of five years, IΓÇÖve taken all the puns I think of on a daily basis and
plant them in a song. Besides that tone, this record also has personal ties.
ThereΓÇÖs a lot about making mistakes, failing, how amazing grace is and picking
yourself back up.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£Who I Am Hates Who IΓÇÖve BeenΓÇ¥ launches with a reflective piano arrangement that
builds up with intensity to address lifeΓÇÖs moments when everything seems to be
failing, while reminding all that God provides second chances. The potent ΓÇ£This
Week, The TrendΓÇ¥ speaks of breaking through daily routine and living each day to
its adventurous fullest, the spunky ΓÇ£Maintain ConsciousnessΓÇ¥ is a colorful
commentary on societyΓÇÖs need to be constantly stimulated by technology and the
blasting ΓÇ£ApatheticΓÇ¥ calls all to tone down their obsession over possessions.

There are also plenty of power chords that fall on the lighter side of the
topical fence, from the brooding vibe of ΓÇ£Life After Death and TaxesΓÇ¥ to the
hysterically framed ΓÇ£My GirlΓÇÖs Ex-BoyfriendΓÇ¥ to the thermometer based teasing of
the bandΓÇÖs home state (Ohio) on ΓÇ£High of 75.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£I So Hate ConsequencesΓÇ¥ seems to
build a bridge between the two writing styles, comically addressing all the
times we make mistakes and try to run from them, but also coming to the
realization that repentance and forgiveness are necessary components in the
healing process.

ΓÇ£WeΓÇÖre not trying to hide anything with the songs on this record, just to get
what we feel out there,ΓÇ¥ Thiessen summarizes. ΓÇ£WeΓÇÖve also found it to be the
hardest thing in the world to say ΓÇÿJesusΓÇÖ in a song and not be cheesy, so we
definitely have our own way of singing about spirituality. But in the end thatΓÇÖs
who we are and what we believe in. We hope between that and the music, it
connects with someone out there.ΓÇ¥
