I dont download anything when seeding to try & keep UL speed as high as possible."
,zzz106,2007-03-11T13:48Z,"Hey Thanks for posting this. Nice movie.
Sure we gonna help seed once it is done, but man this is *SLOW*.

We'll be patient! Thanks again"
,astratwin,2007-03-11T17:25Z,"Sorry guys.....

One of my kids had been messing with my computer & limited UL speed on Utorrent.

Should be alot faster now."
,IWantToLive,2007-03-12T04:56Z,How do add a seed?
,IWantToLive,2007-03-12T14:42Z,*How do you add a seed?* sorry for the miss type.
,davidwink,2007-03-12T18:25Z,Don't seem to be getting anythin off seedeers. R u superseeding because I'm currently downloading at between 400kb/s and 600kb/s and got a feeling that I'm going to get stuck at 10.9% like everyone else...
,IWantToLive,2007-03-14T02:56Z,Please get more seeders!!
,chec0,2007-03-15T13:45Z,Can anyone seed for a long time?  just 13.7% was completed.  Please more seeders
,Alith,2007-03-15T15:17Z,"Hey guys! I need a bit of help - what do I do with those .vob files? Do I just burn the whole thing directly to a dvd, or do I need to do something else? Thanks!"
,Azgarde,2007-03-15T16:56Z,"Alith if you are ready to burn, why dont you seed?  Burn as is, all files to dvd disk.

I will have uploaded 4.33 Gb before I've finished downloading.  Great incentives to not seed after downloading.  In any case the least I have ever seeded is 2 up for 1 down.  My current ratio is 22 Gb. download and 110 Gb. Upload.   Waiting at 14%.  Having a good share ratio helps for your down speed.  But not in this case!  Hurry up and wait."
,astratwin,2007-03-17T13:55Z,Could people who have downloaded please seed as im going away in two days & my Mrs always makes sure all electrical items in house are unplugged so i will not be able to seed.
,aonghus,2007-03-19T13:28Z,"Hmmm. The download seems to stop when it gets to 32,7 % completed as no one is sharing more than that. Would not recommen this torrent at the moment."
,osokthedevil,2007-03-21T04:43Z,COME PEOPLE SEED THE DAMN MOVIE ALREADY STUCK AT 36 % 
,osokthedevil,2007-03-21T04:47Z,NOTHING BUT FUCKING LEECHERS ARE YOU PEOPLE COME ON ALREADY SEED THIS SHIT 
,jester45,2007-03-25T00:56Z,"Please seed and use super-seeding or what ever your client may call it to help share faster as long as all the peers add up to 100% of the torrent it will get spread fast

i have 100mbit up so if i can get this done im sure most of the leachers can get maxed out

And to Azgarde, your using azureus right? well your look at the total ratio and that has nothing to do with per torrent speeds sorry to tell you. o and ps i have over 3 tb uploaded"
,Azgarde,2007-03-26T00:54Z,"Hi group.  I have now uploaded a total, for this dwnload, of 13 Gigs.  Sorry to be a party pooper, but I got tired of waiting.  I went out and rented the film for 2.50$. Ripped it, and burned it.  Strange... No copy protection on this one. Large film though, 7+ GB.  Lots of titles imbeded in the VOB.  I wish you well with your downloads.  Good Luck.  As for my ratio... Havent been on line long enough for a TBite.  I imagine one day I will get there. :0 ) Bye"
