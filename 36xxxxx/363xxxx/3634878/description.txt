One of the most startling, exciting live performances in rock history is presented here in all its glory. The Jimi Hendrix Experience were already making a name for themselves in England but were little known in the States when they appeared at Monterey in June 1967; that all changed after this gig, which saw Hendrix and his trio play an electrifying mix of originals ("Purple Haze," "Foxy Lady," "The Wind Cries Mary") and covers ("Hey Joe," "Like a Rolling Stone," and the climactic "Wild Thing," in which the guitarist set his instrument on fire).

The legendary performance Jimi Hendrix (or rather The Jimi Hendrix Experience) held at The Monterey Pop Festival is a treat for those interested in witnessing the magic Jimi could make on the stage. He was fiery, scary, magical and almost possessed - guaranteed to scare, hypnotize and blow everyone's minds (including the other legendary performers who showed up at the festival.) You've heard all those statements about Jimi: Playing with his teeth, playing behind his back, playing between his legs, playing behind his neck and other tricks. He did it all -- and you can see it all for yourself on this video.

Now, information on the video. Before the actual 'concert' kicks off, you see a crazed-looking guy/artist paint a picture of Hendrix while the live version of "Can You See Me" is playing in the background - which is the only track not seen being performed. Afterwards, you get a narration from John Phillips (a/k/a 'Papa John' Phillips) of The Mamas And The Papas, who gives some interesting background information on Jimi Hendrix and how the idea of The Monterey Pop Festival came about. Also featured is an alternate version of "Wild Thing" and a version of The Beatles' "Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band." You'll learn how Hendrix and Pete Townshend (The Who) almost got into a fight over who was going to perform their act first. So, a coin was flipped, Townshend won. Hendrix then vowed to pull out all the stops - and promised to put on some of the most outrageous & mind-blowing theatrics. The rest was history.

The first song Jimi performs on here is "Killing Floor," which is his fiery and energetic take on what I think was a classic blues song. Next, he kicks out one of his most beloved tunes, "Foxy Lady." He then pulls out a Bob Dylan cover called "Like A Rolling Stone," which is one of the slower and absorbing moments on here. Jimi makes a hilarious reference to bass player Noel Redding as Bob Dylan's Grandmother. Jimi also does a decent job on his vocals - something which he does not receive much credit for. "Rock Me Baby" is a B.B. King classic given the fiery, heavy and energetic treatment. Jimi gives one of his funkiest performances on this track. Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell also give excellent performances on bass and drums respectively. "Hey Joe" also shows Jimi putting on a good vocal performance. On here, he solos with his teeth, as well as playing another solo behind his back. Very interesting stuff.

The next two performances that follow (to me) are the highlights that steal the show. "The Wind Cries Mary" shows Jimi at his strongest vocally. The calm, empty quiet of the audience, Jimi's hushed chords (E is such a beautiful note) and smooth delivery gives this track an intimate feel. You could swear Jimi and the audience had an 'intimate' connection during that performance. The music is just as ethereal, dreamy and beautiful as the blonde-haired woman spotted in the audience (who was seen shaking her head in ecstacy.) Next comes the showstopper -- "Wild Thing." Before Jimi kicks into the first verse, he speaks to the audience and gives gratitude for being discovered. He then performs what he calls a combination of the English and American National Anthems. I'm not really sure if this was supposed to be discernible to many, but it was a pandemonium of fiery, ominous and cacophonous distortion & feedback. However, after that first verse kicks in, all hell breaks loose. He then proceeds to taunt some of the audience members with the rolling of his tongue, while playing a pick-free solo. He then solos while he rolls from one side of the stage to the other, then plays behind his back. For the last 3 minutes, he pulls out some of the most outrageous, disturbing and provocative antics. He simulates coital action with the amplifiers, which in return, bears some of the most rapacious distortion. After some other antics, he pulls out the lighter fluid and pours it onto the guitar (while simulating urination). He then kisses the guitar before he sets it on fire (then ultimately, smashes it to pieces.) However, before all this happens, Jimi gave the audience a bow (which I found clever and hilarious.) Altogether, these final moments were utterly intense, spiritual and cathartic - very beautiful to watch.

This review was pretty long, but a performance like this was worth it. If you're a Jimi Hendrix fan, you really owe it to yourself to pick up this video (while it's still available). Get it before it's gone.
