,Pontefix,2008-02-23T16:58Z,"Great stuff, EcorI. This is it, the classic. You should have the Torrent Nobel Price."
,Pixelated_Death,2008-05-24T09:29Z,"I don't often complain in the comments section but this is very poorly encoded. It skips a lot and because of the codec used, you can't skip around. 

I'm downloading the large Jimi Hendrix Live at Monterey DVD9 from here on TPB and will encode it to standard .AVI and upload it. Maybe after DVD shrink and encode I can get it down to 1.5GB-2.0GB. "
