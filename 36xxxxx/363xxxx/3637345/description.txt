2006 Alpertinth Records release.  

From the liner notes:  "The best way out is always through" - Robert Frost.  Three guys, one chick, an AKAI sampler, a half-track reel-to-reel, loads of nature samples, a Farfisa organ, and four years of finding time between their other projects (including stints in Yukon Struggle, the Hoosier Lugers, Man Act, and other Oklahoma and Minnesota also-rans).  Luther and Herot went on to form 2/3 of Buffalo Knife.  Lucy moved back to Oklahoma City.  Now we reflect and compile.  

Bonfeu thrived in the days before VST plugins, before Windows Vista, before Britney Spears shaved her head, before 9/11, an innocent time by today's standards.  Electronic music mashed together with good old lo-fi indie aesthetics.  Smeared with midwestern manure.  Rendered to relative perfection.

This compilation brings together their favorite trance, ambient, and downright sonically nasty works in a newly mastered collection.  

Cover art included.  Please seed after you grab!
