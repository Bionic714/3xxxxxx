,Sparksta,2007-03-21T05:00Z,nice to see a dts torrent yet still would love to see more about even ES or EX sounds as i have a yamaha 6.1 ex matrix amp the sound is sweet when its hit with some nice quality i have hooked up optic cable from my dhmi player  (:
,Sparksta,2007-03-21T05:11Z,"reve.... first off use DVD DECRYPTER get the files from dvd on your comp.... most dvds r over 4gb so you will need to compress or remove dvd features/extras from the ripped move... removie extras will give u less compression on the movies quality so u get near enough 100% quality n if need be just shrink extras and leave movie good quality.. loads of good programs out there for this (google search) tpb good to go!... thats about it really... now get ripping and get them uplaods good to go ((:

hope this helps.... chow"
