Is this fullscreen or widescreen?  How is the sound/video encoding, etc., etc.?"
,freebsdhost,2007-06-20T14:53Z,"it's widescreen, taken from the PAL dvd.  A/V are in sync and the quality is excellent."
,Kwakuh,2007-08-01T02:48Z,"I trust him.  I'm now watching widescreen ""Chamber of Secrets"" that he posted. It's good thus far. I just hope I get ""Prisoner"" d/l'd faster than ""Chamber."" Thanks Freebsdhost!

BTW, can yall tell me how to go about reseeding other torrents I've received so others may use them? Thanks."

,Pirate 32,2007-11-06T09:20Z,"What's the damned screen resolution?

Why review or rate a torrent with ambiguous terms like ""good quality""?

We ALL got our own definition of ""Good Quality"".

Please post scientific info -instead of crappy opinions."
