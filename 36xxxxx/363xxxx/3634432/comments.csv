,flyte123,2007-03-15T01:59Z,"Just to add to the statistics: A total of 133 Demonoid members downloaded the external Pirate Bay torrent file (as of 0100 GMT on March 15). (It is not possible to determine how many downloaded the full 782MB.)

The following comments are from Demonoid members who downloaded this as an external torrent:

from ibm650 on March 7:

""Thanks much, I enjoy these folk songs.""


From alclay on March 7: 

""Wonderful! truly a collection to be proud of. I thank you very much""


From engt on March 8

""Thnxalot for this one, mate!!!  There are 3 albums on here that I don't have, so I'm glad to fill out my Woody collection!""

from woody8 on March 13

""I'd like to say thank you. Woody is one of greatest men of all the time and this is great up. I've got most of this, but not everything.""

Now my comments:
Woody was the most American of all of the 40s and 50s folksinger songwriters. Without using anyone else's ideology, he saw us for what we really are, with a deep love of our country beneath all the pragmatic criticism he made. We've usually been a people to solve problems rather than wallowing in them, and Woody tried to make his contribution to that.

We are a people who hate to be bs'd and he, just as well as Steinbeck, pointed out the bs of what he saw around him. Steve Earle in ""Christmas in Washington"" says very well that we really need him (or maybe someone like him) now...But our alternative is not the early Stalinist silliness combined with extreme and counterproductive conservatism of Pete Seeger (his objections to Dylan plugging in). Our pragmatism and realism are our strengths, as well as our determination to try to not to let problems fester forever, although we are far from perfect in that. When we forget that we wind up in Vietnam or Iraq.

To others from outside the US, please take Woody in the sense that I just mentioned. Maybe there are some better poets or songwriters. Lots of people can sing better. But maybe you could use a few more like him.

Please enjoy this fantastic torrent and don't forget to THANK the collector/uploader."
