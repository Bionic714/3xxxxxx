,Scorpion420,2007-03-12T04:34Z,"Quality is very good for camera. Whoever did the video editing did a wonderful job so you don't hear any laughing or see anyone moving across the screen. 
Video 8/10
Audio 7/10
Thank you! :)"

,garcia vega,2007-04-07T20:24Z,video was ok but the audio was about 5 seconds behind video
,BrenJames,2007-04-10T14:26Z,"The movie is really terrible!! It should be rated brain-dead under 12's only! Plus the audio is miles out of sync with the picture! 
Travolta must be really desperate to take this role."
,BrenJames,2007-04-11T23:06Z,"Highlight all the files at once, (all the little piles of books only)and extract to any folder you choose with winrar....but don't waste your time on this rubbish film!!"
,_kebaben_,2007-04-11T23:18Z,"this is a TS-release, not a CAM-release ffs!"
,morcumith,2007-04-14T15:16Z,new guy on the block..thank you for the up.will seed
,rowborough,2007-04-16T23:01Z,"dont listen to benjames he dosnt know shit !
to extract rar files make sure you have Winrar instaled first (get it free from this site)

Then when ever you have a rar set of files just right click on any one of the rar files (it dosnt matter which one ) and just choose ""extract here"", no need to highlight all the files of pick directories as that idiot said, why make things complicated.

I would say that anyone that uploads torrents in rar format should be shot as there is no need and it actualy slows things down, just the normal file as original will be alot more user friendly and download quicker (check out Axxo torrents not a rar or zip file in site!)"
