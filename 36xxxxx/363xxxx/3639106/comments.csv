Take my advice - bust your balls, sell your granny into slavery, remortgage the house, sell your car - whatever it takes - get a ticket for this ! Got my ticket for local show and I can't wait !

RONNIE JAMES DIO.  Man, that's a rock god if ever there was one ! Seen him live numerous times over the last 25 years and he never fails to deliver."
