Greetings All!

It\\\'s been quite some time since a new demo from these parts...not since the double disk of \\\"The Soul Replenisher\\\". I am eager to announce my new demo entitled \\\"The 1-2 Punch!\\\" has just been completed. Marking the series finale of my 5 year online show on www.thewomb.com / www.wombmusic.com called \\\"Storytellers ft. DJ FX\\\", this is a 4 hour set recorded live in the womb studios with a live video mix by Psyberpixie (www.psybervision.tv).

This set is being put out there as a DVD +R DL 8.5 gb in order to preserve the integrity of both the audio and video streams.


Peace,
FX
