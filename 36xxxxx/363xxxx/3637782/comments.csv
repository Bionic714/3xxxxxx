,Krommie,2007-03-13T14:33Z,"Nice up indeed!
Is this the actual dvd with subs and stuff or divx converted to dvd?

Anyway thnx ;)"
,berlinerkindl,2007-03-13T15:43Z,"There is no ""actual"" dvd, this have never been released outside of pirated dvd's floating about. This is converted from divx w/ some custom menus i threw together a year ago. quality is ok, considering they were recorded off of analog cable (scifi's brief rebroadcast)"
,Krommie,2007-03-14T11:20Z,"I already have the divx, but still gonna dl yours.
Always nice to have a menu :)
You didn't put any subs on here by any chance?"
