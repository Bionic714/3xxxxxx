Much to my surprise,This film was actually an excellent horror flick, one that I plan to watch again some day.
I am glad a friend of mine recommended the movie to me, I am just hoping others will find the time to look into it.
Even more, if the story actually is based on a \"true story\", I will shudder at the thought of it...
