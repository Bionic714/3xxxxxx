Classic Tracks from 88 onwards. Im currently converting all my vinyl and wish to share with devoted clubbers of the present and past, most of these tunes you wont get on CD and the remixes are all there for each 12 inch. I will post vol 2 when i get another gig of tunes to upload. Pls Seed and help me out and to be honest when you hear these tracks you will oblige and i will oblige in converting the other 1000 vinyl classics, which are worth a small fortune so enjoy and seed...............................Happy Days Clubbers
