,LmEnt.,2007-05-11T21:40Z,"Hey akayal, 
When you do instructions, It might be helpfull to the beginers to tell them exactly where in the registration to copy the ""1.reg"" file morron. And it doesn't make your ""Windows genuine forever (100%)"". As soon as your try to get IE7 or WMP 11 or any of the security updates that require a Validation, M$ comes back and requests that you re-install with a different Pruduct ID # or purchase one for $199.00us. 
So If you have away around that please do tell. Otherwise everyone who uses this will be dead in the water, like everyone else.........."
