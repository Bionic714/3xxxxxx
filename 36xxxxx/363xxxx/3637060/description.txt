NOTES: PROPS TO XXL WHO USUALLY GETS THIS RELEASE UP ON A NORMAL BASIS, I ENJOY THESE PROMO ALBUMS SO MUCH I DECIDED
TO GO AHEAD AND GET THEM FOR MYSELF, AND IF ANYONE WAS LIKE ME, CHECKING IN ON A DAILY BASIS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE NEW
UP, THEN IM SURE YOU'LL APPRECIATE THIS RELEASE (WHICH COINCIDENTLY IS MY FIRST)
