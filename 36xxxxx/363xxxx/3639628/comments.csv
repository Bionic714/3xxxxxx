wtf over kill
its just a tv show."
,coprod,2007-03-23T11:41Z,Why overkill? Some people like good quality on TV-shows. This is 5.1 audio as well. Nice u/l
,Ran4,2007-04-05T00:06Z,"Yourpcguy, you're stupid. Really stupid...

Sure, this show isn't that good (barely watchable), but why NOT see it in 720p?
I'd like it in 1080p ^^"
