Season 2 looks to be working just fine, but there MAY be a small issue with season 1.  If you can't download it all, let me know and I'll try re-making the torrent (this is my first one ever).

,PreacherCrasH,2007-03-06T16:27Z,"This torrent is having very small issues.  For some reason, it tells me I have to download the file and I'm stuck at 99.8% before it'll seed fully.  So, try using the one below that works 100% and is seeding in full now.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
