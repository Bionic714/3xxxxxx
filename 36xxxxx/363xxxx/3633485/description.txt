LÃ¤r dig JAPANSKA! 


Chances are that if you're looking at this page right now, 
you've thought at one point in your life, "y'know, it would 
probably be fun to know Japanese, but how?" 


Undoubtedly, it sure looks like a formidable task, what with 
all of its confusing-looking writing and its reputation for 
having a most unusual sentence structure. 


Well have no fear. If you really want to learn Japanese, 
these lessons can give you a push in the right direction. 
If you're not already convinced that it's a good idea, 
here are: 


Six great reasons to study Japanese! 


Reason 1 

Spoken by over 130 million people, Japanese 
is among the top 10 languages on Earth. 


Reason 2 

There are a LOT of movies, anime series (and 
video games) out there in Japanese only. 


Reason 3 

Many of your family, friends, classmates and/or 
co-workers believe Japanese is hard. Show them what 
you can do! They'll think you have special talent. 


Reason 4 

"Speaks Japanese" looks great on a resume, no matter what 
your line of work. Knowing any second language helps, but 
Japanese will have a greater effect on an employer, since 
not many Westerners know it. (which can't be said for 
Spanish, for example) but to hear it and actually know 
what's being said is an even better experience. 


Reason 5 

Japan has the second largest economy in the world, 
so their language is very relevant. 


Reason 6 

Japan has a fascinating culture, much of which 
is reflected in its language. 


Actually, anyone can learn Japanese if they want to, but 
people have a way of being really impressed about somebody 
approaching the Japanese language. 


Such learning is not only highly effective, but it can 
also be stimulating and enjoyable! 


This package contains 6 mini e-books for the beginner!
