To play, download the DivX codec from www.divx.com then open the file in your favourite media player (windows media player, vlc, etc)

It should also play if you have a recent XviD codec configured to ""play all FourCC types"""

,Lustikurre,2008-07-05T02:02Z,"DL speed: 1/5
Quality: 5/5
Language Spoken: English
Subtitles: None

Download speed was very slow, but quality of the movie was super.

For swedish subtitles: http://www.undertexter.se/?p=subark&id=67
Click ""Ladda ner"" at the bottom right.
Btw this link really IS subtitles and no fucking virus link or whatever that some people links.

Thanks for upload :)"
