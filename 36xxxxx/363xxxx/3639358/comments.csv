,Naxon_255,2007-04-13T17:48Z,"ok, i have come as far as baron, i can start the game and play single player. but there are so many questions about the SteamApp.
like, should the quotes stay?
should you change the steam id to the one you have, or should it remain on 1210?
should the red orchestra folder be placed somewhere certain?
in the steaminstallpath, should i include \Steam, or just typ the folder that Steam is in, or maybe even write \Steam\Steam.dll.

seriously, it's so confusing i'm losing my mind!!"
,Naxon_255,2007-04-13T17:50Z,"also, do you know where the patch is, 'cause i've looked and i've only found patches to the MOD Red Orchestra. The mod they had before the game, for UT2004."

Its amazing though how many people are accusing this guy of stuffing this torrent with virus's. 

-Their aren't any !!!!! 

That will be because of your anti virus software being over suspicious about some files you should expect that especially if your pirating because your not putting the game through the same normal installation process most legitimate games are installed by. 

A lot of people are complaining about it not installing properly 

- You do not install you click on the exe with the R logo with a ring around it.

- If you want the most out of this fine game read kristjan09s comment 

(by the way couldnt of played the game without your comment thanks !!!)   


1. Go to the directory where you installed Red Orchestra
2. RENAME /System/Steam.dll to Steam.dll.bak
3. Rename Steam.dll.Offline to Steam.dll
4. Run /System/RedOrchestra.exe & Play in practise mode or whatever...

Note: Steam is not needed for this, nor it has to be running!!
Enjoy!



and lastly DON'T complain about it not working and go around swearing and threatening the torrents publisher  it works for me and if you do it properly it'll work for you :)


Any problems Don't threaten the publisher with bullshit and complain just email me :

so for those of you having the ""APIC error Cannot find Control block please contact info@oreans.com""

here is how to fix it first of all
do like it says in the read me Rename steam.dll to steam.dll in the system folder and steam.dll.offline to steam.dll

AFTER all of that is done Install steam 
if you already have it install good! now go to you steam directory which can be found C:\Program Files\Steam
In there will be a steam.dll COPY IT and PASTE IT in the red orchestra system folder (depends where you extracted it)\Red Orchestra\System
IT WILL ask you if you want to replace it SAY YES!

Now you can launch red orchestra with the redorchestra.exe (R with circle icon) it will work no more errors YAY!
