Sorry I don't remember precisely.

Because of that, I can't do any Windows Update
or access any ActiveX contents.

Beside IE7, what is not working with this version?

Is SP2, just released, will work?

Thanks."
,1488,2007-03-15T11:54Z,"Yes, SP2 is released, with the IE7, have a try with it, with the IE4 try to install it from microsoft.com"
,belangermtl,2007-03-17T20:58Z,"Hello,
I will try to install SP2 and IE7 but I want just to
tell exactly what I get for a message after installation:

In the ""Personalized Settings"" windows, for the item ""Internet Explorer 6"", I get a new windows where it is said:

  Title bar: ie4uinit.exe - Entry Point Not Found
  Contain: The procedure entry point ExecuteCabW could not be located in the dynamic link library ADVPACK.dll.

Thanks.

btw/ The graphical performance is tuned down by default, change it by going to the properties for the themes/desktop->settings->advanced->troubleshoot"

so wait a second... is this one single OS which kinda combines Windows 2003 server with Windows XP MCE, or  dose this thing install 2 diff OSes one being 2003 server and the other being XP MCE... or am i getting everything wrong.... 

either way i think ill try it cause i could use a MCE other than the MCE disk i got with my Dell, and im pissed off at Windows 2000 Server with trying to set up a domain... so watever... ill try it out... i hope the DL time is short....

damn domains.... why the hell am i setting up one in my house anyhow??? o_0 ... nvm...."
