,mlau,2007-03-14T07:19Z,thank you very much!
,trogdorbt,2007-03-14T07:23Z,Heh - sorry for the delays.  Azureus was doing strange things and wasn't picking up the correct tracker URL (kept defaulting to my IP).  It's up and running now!
,trogdorbt,2007-03-14T07:40Z,"And just for shits and giggles, I did the math.  At the present upload rate of my connection, it will take at least 51 hours for me to send out ONE complete copy.  I'll be leaving this up for quite some time, however, so it should pick up steam eventually.  If you want to grab a few of the individual HRHD episodes and then when those are finished you can stop this download, rename the files as appropriate, and then restart/recheck and that will speed things up.  Convoluted to be sure, but just a thought!

Trogdor!
Burninating the MPAA!"
,rc71,2007-04-01T05:10Z,"to the last comment. 
Dude if you did that it would make you a leech.  You wouldn't share the episodes you've already downloaded.  Strange Suggestion"
,narok,2007-04-01T18:08Z,well have to say many people wants to download. but not so much wants to seed.. i'm on 10/10mbits broadband.. so i'll seed it a few days when i get it... to all leechers start to share FFS.. and not just think of ur selves.......... and my wish is piratebay have a seeding rate system soon. 
,trogdorbt,2007-04-08T14:59Z,"@rc71: That was posted early on when the torrent had just me as a seed and it would take at least five days to get the entire torrent (and probably more).

The idea was you could download a separate HRHD Episode (i.e. Ep4), then rename it to the file name used for this Season 2 group of files, overwriting the file already in this torrent.  At that point, you could then restart this whole torrent, except now you would already have a complete copy of Ep4 (which you could have downloaded in about 4 hours) and that would speed up others on that particular file. Net result would be the entire torrent becomes faster.

Obviously, that scenario would only be truly beneficial if you were interested in seeding purely for altruistic purposes.  At this stage you can almost certainly get every Season 2 episode via this single torrent faster than any other source.  It's too bad that for (currently) 218 downloads there are only 20 seeds, but then if 10% are non-leeches we're still doing reasonably well.  :)

Okay, I'm done with my comments.  Thanks for downloading/seeding!"
,anomie,2007-05-20T16:14Z,Thanks for posting this!
,denthetrader,2007-06-03T09:24Z,"Brilliant. 
Big thx to trogdorbt for this piece of work! Appreciate it very much. 


"" Action stations... """
,saseniukk,2007-07-31T08:43Z,"Love the series, thanks Trog.

For others, I do what I can to seed but have alimited upload amount before I have to start paying out the nose.  Thanks for being understanding. :)"
,Kuleiro,2007-08-25T22:32Z,"Are these videos from the DVD? And what is ""Mer""?"
,rush.chevsky,2007-12-31T17:22Z,MER is my initials.
,posith,2008-01-10T14:53Z,Is the sound in 5.1 format for all episodes listed here?
,rush.chevsky,2008-01-14T19:35Z,It is not 5.1. If you click on my user name you will find links to the original files and a description of most. I encoded most in a 4 channel matrix to save bitrate for video. The original rips were from Universal HDTV.
,combular,2008-01-15T05:29Z,"Is it just me, or are some of the MER episodes glitchy? For example, S01E07, ""Six Degrees of Separation"", has frequent missing video, either in the form of frame skips or data blocks missing. Most episodes seem to be perfect or near-perfect, so I don't think it's my version of VLC or my machine or anything."
,combular,2008-01-15T05:34Z,"PS it's not unwatchable by any means. It's just annoying, considering the excellent quality of most of the rips."
,s20dan,2008-01-17T00:38Z,"These are great, better than DVD imo (Less image noise and a higher res) Thanks Trog for bringing them all together and thanks Rushfor making them. :) "
,rush.chevsky,2008-03-06T05:52Z,"combular, there is no S01E07 in this torrent.
this is season 2 check your meds."
,combular,2008-03-10T15:59Z,"I realize that. The MER episodes were available somewhere else as one torrent, and some of the episodes were glitchy. I was wondering whether that was true of the originals or just the torrent I found."
,CRUNK007,2008-08-25T01:12Z,damn it... SEED
,appulandia,2009-06-05T18:37Z,"Pls seed, i got 15% in one day :|
