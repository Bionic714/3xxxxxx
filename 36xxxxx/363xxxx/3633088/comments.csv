,evert johansson,2007-03-06T17:45Z,Varför seedar ingen? Tröstlöst!
,bÃ¸ffel,2007-03-06T20:53Z,"I have to seed one movie at the time, or else they will newer be done. I'm sorry dudes and dudets, my bad.
I will seed Bad taste first, then The serpent and the rainbow, Evil dead 2, Evil dead 1."
,iljutz,2007-03-22T17:09Z," Hey,  bøffel. Why do you then upload this torrent if you don't seed? That's like dumbest thing to do.. This sucks and you suck too.

And for everyone for info: I'm stuck @ 7,3% for two weeks now. I will never ever download any shit from user bøffel again. *deleting torrent*"
