,munkeeman,2007-04-11T23:22Z,Thanks so much for the robust torrent.  I am excited to use it but cant get the TmpgEnc Xpress 4 license file moved to the right place cuz I dont have a folder called application data in my documents and settings folder.  please help.

You do have that APPLICATION DATA folder. In Windows, it is a hidden file and you need to open any file window, click on TOOLS in the tool bar, go into FOLDER OPTIONS, then click on VIEW, then find HIDDEN FILES AND FOLDERS, and select SHOW HIDDEN FILES AND FOLDERS, and put a mark in the radio button. Then click on APPLY, then OK. Then click on MY COMPUTER, then DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS, then pick your user file (However you named it), thenyou will see the APPLICATION DATA folder."
