,Jack Sprat,2007-03-11T16:19Z,I'm still the only one seeding so far. I hope that you guys will stick around a while and seed after you've gotten 100% of this. This is a great video set! I bought it yesterday and if I can't find a good quality NTSC copy I may buy the 2nd Queen compilation as well. Anyone have it?
,Jack Sprat,2007-03-14T00:32Z,Some of you had better start seeding! I've seeded long enough.
,Jack Sprat,2007-03-22T21:55Z,"Well, That's it for me. I've been seeding this since March 11th and hope that those who are still seeding will stick around. I've received no real comments other than a whiner to ""seed"", which I'd been doing all this time. For 525 downloads, you'd think there'd be more seeding this awesome DVD. Oh well, You get what you give."
,sackese,2007-04-05T21:06Z,"Thanks, but can anybody please seed?"
,oakey55,2007-04-22T05:02Z,Over a couple of weeks I've seen up to 9 seeders listed but I have not gotten past 40%. Could someone please seed this so some of us can complete?
,kartoon1111,2007-05-01T18:00Z,been stuck at 39.9% for 3 days now. are there any seeder?
,aardvaark2,2008-03-12T17:24Z,"Almost a year later 12-02-2008. I am stuck at 39.9 too.

This is a good quality vid so why hasn't anyone stepped up and seeded? I totally understand where Jack Spratt is coming from.People just grab their own copy and take off.

Show some coutesy and respect and keep seeding until it shows 1.0 at least."
