Note: If you like MIS Info Video like me or not 
used it for awhile, can you vote on the poll here:

Read the MIS Info Video 2.5 post. I voted for a 
better UI :D but what do you want? 
new UI, more codecs or more features.

It's cool because you can see a map of voters. 
P.S. Someone voted 2+ times Not cool :( 
I zoomed all the way to see it

The more people use the .MIS, the more chance to get
in a DVD Divx player :D"

,ChubbyDirt,2008-07-04T15:24Z,"So close.. 1.02 out of 1.04GB... Can anyone seed?

Thanks!"
,hizman,2008-11-23T18:42Z,"What a pity that these closing episodes are much worse than the first 3 episodes available here at TPB. Also, the sound is lost for a few minutes, at least in episode 4 (that's the furthest I went so far).

But thanks to theduke84 anyway. I couldn't find Smith anywhere else."
