,halowarsfreak,2008-08-09T21:18Z,"i will download it because i thought it was gay, shot it with a bb gun and threw it out the window and now i want it back."
,daan62,2009-03-01T21:19Z,"this is the install exe when you downloaded it you must click the install icon. during the install you just have to wait, because sometimes it looks like it works perfectly.

my conclusion it works and it is a good game thanks man, i'll seed it for a while"
