The first songs ever recorded by Pink Floyd. Both songs were recorded as demo takes. There is some debate about the exact date, with estimates going back as far as mid 1964. Most sources however give October 1965 as the most probable month of recording.


ive put in some pics of Syd Barrett from 1966 and 70's and late 90's ish.......
