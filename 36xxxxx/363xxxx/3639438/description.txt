Papyrus Sierra Car Racing Simulations


Papyrus made some of the most impressive and most realistic racing simulations for the PC, of which some are included here:


1989 - Indianapolis 500: The Simulation
Can't say much about this title, never played it myself. It's a rather old DOS game. Included for its small filesize.

1993 - IndyCar Racing
DOS game, never could get the sound to work. Included for its small filesize.

1994 - Nascar Racing
One of the more detailled, nicely made DOS games.

1998 - Grand Prix Legends
One of, if not the most realistic racing sim ever. Extremely realistic physics, but rather difficult to play. Well worth the effort though. The graphics are pretty good for a 1998 game. The game is patched to version 1.2 and a Direcd 3D renderer is included for better looks and performance (select from the video menu).

1998 - Nascar Legends
Nascar Racing with vintage cars. Asks for CD initially, but message can be ignored. Works without CD like all other games in this collection.

1998 - Viper Racing
Not really a Papyrus game, but from a company called Monster Games Inc., which consisted partially of former Papyrus members, thus the similarity in their games. A nice Dodge Viper racing sim. Can be played in arcade as well as in simulation mode. Realistic physics. When using XP, run the .bat file instead of the .exe or set to Win95 compatibility mode.

2000 - Nascar Racing 3 + Craftsman Truck expansion pack
Purchased this together with Nascar Legends in a 3CD set, never played it much though, GPL was always my favorite, followed by Viper Racing.
