,richardbach,2007-03-08T23:16Z,"Maybe the 8 version is a crap... and I'd willingly use the 7 version (the airports are there in FSX as they were in FS2004, so for flightplanning it's all one) but  the problem it's with the databases.
I'd deleted FS2004 so I can't run the database builder needed for running the 7 version."
,richardbach,2007-03-08T23:18Z,"P.s.
But thousand thanks anyway! :)"
,nicoseco,2007-03-09T01:14Z,"I uploaded megaCity Dallas some time ago, don't seeding anymore lost the file on last format, but there's some people still seeding this! Hope that helps!!
