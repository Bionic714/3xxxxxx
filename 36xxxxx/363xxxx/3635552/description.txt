For fans of Sam's work, this film provides insight into the mind and art of one of the most off-the-wall comedians to come along since Lenny Bruce. It includes some good footage of Sam's early careers, but the viewer is left with as many questions as answers. Interviews with notables such as Jay Leno and Richard Pryor provide some needed depth. For those who appreciate "extreme" humor, I would recommend this one.
