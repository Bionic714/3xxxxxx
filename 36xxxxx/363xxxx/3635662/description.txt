After the Iranian revolution in 1979, Persian classical music enjoyed a widespread domestic popularity, and performers like tar-player Hossein Alizadeh and duduk master Djivan Gasparyan became stars in their home country. This 2006 Grammy-nominated collaboration between the two artists is an enlivening musical experience, recorded live at the Niavaran Palace in Tehran.

The Wire (p.74) - "Gasparyan carves elegant melodic contours around his terse plectrum phrasing....ENDLESS VISION generates the aura of significant art without falling prey to either stultifying seriousness or New Age utopianism."

The Wire (p.63) - "The mood is languid and understated: Alizadeh is a musician inclined to whisper rather than shout."

Dirty Linen (p.50) - "The music is sometimes meditative, sometimes mournful, and always moving....Your perception of music will be forever and wonderfully changed."

Global Rhythm (Publication) (p.47) - "[S]pine-tingling in their beauty, combining precision and inspiration amid moods ranging from delicately graceful to blazingly powerful."
