,Lugubrizione,2007-03-16T15:16Z,"The Release is fine, but the movie sucks sooo bad it actually hurts. It makes the fight/war movies from the 1980's look like Oscar winners. Dig up some old Chuck Norris stuff, Mr.T or just stare at a wall for a while. 

I paused the movie to see how much pain I had left, but realized that what felt like 2 hours was only 40 minutes.

Do not download, do not share this movie, as it is harmful to your health, both mentalyl and physically. Save other the pain: Delete!!!"
