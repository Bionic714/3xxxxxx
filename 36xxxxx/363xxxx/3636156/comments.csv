Din jävla patetiska amatör!!"
,R2/D2,2007-03-11T14:33Z,What happened to the seeding? Is 3.5 % all we gonna get?
,Staple,2007-03-12T15:28Z,"Among crappy torrents I can understand, but this is a very good film and the uploader should be an adult or..... beeeeeeehave."
,WildTorry,2007-03-13T18:36Z,"I've been looking for this for a long time.
Very disappointing when nobody is seeding.... B-("
,R2/D2,2007-03-14T16:46Z,"Damn, this is so lame! Teasing us with 3.5 % and then just disappear! "

[T],Huggybaby,2010-02-02T10:19Z,"This is a great movie, and being a Chicago fan and having lived in Arizona makes it even better. I think this was James William Guercio's only movie but he should have made more. I guess producing music was more appealing to him.

Thanks for keeping this almost unknown film alive."
[T],minifrepper,2010-07-03T12:41Z,"A great movie indeed. And the first apperance for Nick Nolte (one of the guys in the hippie gang)

The band playing the rock-concert in the movie, are Madura. Another great band from Chicago and their album also were produced nby J. W. Guercio

Check their website here:
