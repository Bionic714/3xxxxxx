,kcu,2007-03-10T15:39Z,"I think he missed the part where it says 'Mix'

Besides as 'eyerock' clearly pointed out there is no where it says it's split into 14 files.

It could have been split but since it's a mix it would mean some of the previous song would be playing when you start a song and therefore would not sound too great.

if you want it in one big file you can just burn it with no delay between songs!"
