,username666,2009-02-28T07:06Z,Normally I never seed past 2:1.  However I lost the CD to my VN-240PC and Olympus(those fucks) expected me to pay for a new CD since they don't want to waste a whole freaking 20mb of bandwidth.  So as the sincerest of gratitude I will be seeding this till 100:1.  Or one year if no one else ever downloads it >.
