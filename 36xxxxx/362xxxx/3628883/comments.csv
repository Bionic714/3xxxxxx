,GunnerBFG,2008-10-19T09:20Z,"Good grief!  Blind and stupid!
DL the PATCH and patch the ORIGINAL game files, THEN copy the crack to the obvious location.  If you can't figure out the obvious location then you really shouldn't be allowed in public unsupervised."
,ExterminatorBG,2008-12-29T21:43Z,People you shouldn't get any mistakes! You make a fresh install of HW 2 1.0 and patch it to 1.1 with clean patch and simply copy this exe in HW2\bin\release folder and replace the original file. It's good to always make a backup ;)! Maybe the crack works only for English version only but I am not sure! Please use english versions only to be sure.
,ViccyQ,2009-01-17T03:18Z,Anyone know where I get the patch at?
,xpoptartsx,2010-01-21T15:52Z,Drmaybe27 how did you fix this problem? i am having the same issue

,ROnneth,2010-05-13T22:33Z,"it gives me the same luaconfig.dll problem... i have done lots of mounte image, games and play with crack ant replacements so i know what im doing but the game crash on me this time...i hve Windows 7 btw. should be fine. no?"
,ROnneth,2010-05-17T02:30Z,"i have a prtoblem with ""Luaconfig.dll"". when I start the game using the icons in the desktop or the .exe in the folder it gives me a error with a luacongig.dll.


i have a 1.0 version vanilla and I mount it, install  in the normal location ( C:/ etc ) 

-then inmidiatly patch it with a the 1.0 to 1.1 patch english version.

-then found a 1.1 .exe crack and replace the original and then with  or without the complex mod isntalled it gives me thes issue. CAN'T play right now.

now its not giving me the luaconfig.dll error but i press over and over again the icon and never start the game. its not running the game. i think...
any idea?
 i have windows 7 but its not a problem i think. many others games 2000+ are working right no on mi PC.

anyone have the same problem?"
,ExterminatorBG,2011-12-31T11:54Z,About the luaconfig.dll error it seems you are placing the 1.1 crack on a 1.0 version. It must be updated before applying the crack! Also ROnneth I think you need to run the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP.
