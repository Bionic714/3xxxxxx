Evolva is a tactical shoot-em-up for the PC which immerses the player in a visually stunning 3D world offering a rich gameplaying experience. Driven by Computer Artworks' A-Life technology, this world and its alien inhabitants form a challenging and actually living environment. Evolva sees the player having to fight against an alien parasite that has infected a planet. This parasite has an army of guardians to protect it and they will have to be stopped if the player is to be able to ultimately stop the parasite itself. The player takes control of a team of customisable creatures called Genohunters and guides them through a unique gaming world that mixes the excitement of a fast paced shoot-em-up with the tactical elements of a strategy game.
