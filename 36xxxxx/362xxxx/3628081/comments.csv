Anyone cares to explain?"

,davidoff_1,2007-02-27T20:09Z,"don't know if you have the same problem, but it says that my ip is reg. and than 2x my screen went black!?! is this normal or bad thing?

,Massmordaren,2007-02-27T20:26Z,"Ah, thank you."
,allen_x,2007-02-27T20:57Z,"this is a pretty nice up, thanks"
,skull46,2007-02-27T20:59Z,"tweakfps actually got my fps from 10-11 to 20-25 with an improvement in the way it looks. the other stuff is fairly mundane, but useful. i have no clue about the ip thing, thats never happened to me. install the demo, then use the keygen to generate a key and register it in the program."
,davidoff_1,2007-02-27T21:22Z,"i'll be more specific : when i enterd the password a pop-up appeard. it said something about piracy and my ip reg and some more stuff.
After the warning i turned on fs load and back came the warning with 2 tims black screen.
"
,skull46,2007-02-27T21:39Z,thats weird. i installed it and worked just fine. go through the steps that you took and maybe we'll see where the bad happened.
,kNada,2007-03-01T01:23Z,"if your pasword begins with TFQW-8563 the program will ban you.
try to register with other key"
,SmiffnWsn,2007-03-03T01:33Z,"It Happened to me also. Its third tweak program in the download. try to avoid installing it, plus its not really great like the first two. I purchased the program afterwards and also contact the sales dept. They have no clue what was the pop-up.
They could be lying though.

One thing and this is very important. 
After the the screen went blank once. My firewall
went crazy, Stating that someone is trying to access my PC. Which of course was denied.
They was trying to come in at least 2x per second.

This is a good torrent though. just avoid installing the third program in the archive.

P.S. CA Firewall is the best, Trust me it has a better firewall than Norton.

Tweakfs will show you a difference in simming."
,SmiffnWsn,2007-03-03T01:41Z,"Good news I got it sraight from the horses mouth.

Hi Peter,

OK, I think I understand now. No worries I am here to help.

First, I am assuming you are referring to TweakFPS for FS2004 (which I notice you purchased - thank you kindly), please confirm this as some folks enter the registration code from one of my products into another product (I have about 8).

TweakFPS has no illegal copy protection whatsoever so not sure where this popup is coming from. When you first start up TweakFPS it may say it is a demo copy, all you need to do is enter the the code into the Registration dialog via the Settings page.

So we good. Icould sleep easy.
Its a good torrent. still avoid the third one.

Try it, like it, buy it."
