Find windows, fast. TopDesk is a quick and easy way to switch between applications. With a single key press, you can instantly view thumbnails of all open windows, display thumbnails of windows belonging to the current application, or hide all windows to quickly access the desktop.

Using Hot Keys By default, F9 tiles all windows, including minimized windows, F9+Shift tiles all visible windows, F10 tiles all windows belonging to the current application, and F11 hides all visible windows. Each TopDesk action can be assigned to a different hot key combination. Using Mouse Hotspots TopDesk actions can also be activated by moving the mouse over a mouse hotspot. Each mouse hotspot can be assigned to a different TopDesk action or disabled. Using Floating Buttons TopDesk can also be operated via floating buttons. These buttons float above all other applications and allow TopDesk actions to be activated by a single mouse or TabletPC pen click.
