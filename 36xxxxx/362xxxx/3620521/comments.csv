,magicfart,2008-09-26T02:47Z,Why is it that nearly everyone on here is willing to sacrifice up to 75% quality just to fit the entire DVD (plus extras) on one SL disc?  I HATE that!  Why not just take off the extras so the movie doesn't look like shit?  Or if you leave the extras in DON'T COMPRESS IT.  I'm not necessarily talking about this movie (even though I'm sure it's the case because it appears to be full of extras and it's only 4.37GiB).  Why?  Why are there so few full quality DVDs?  I downloaded a Disney movie the other day for my little girl and it looks like VHS because some dipshit decided it was a good idea to leave all the extras in and compress it down to a SL Disc.  I'm so aggravated.
,magicfart,2008-09-26T02:52Z,"Regardless, thanks for at least attempting this.  I just wish people cared about quality.  I mean, why download DVDs anyway?  Why not just go to a some yard sales and pick up a bunch of old VHSs?  I thought the whole point of DVD was to have higher quality video?  It's like we moved forward and then took a step back just for the sake of saving a little time.  (is that the reason?  So we can get our videos a few hours sooner?)"
,nemozeen,2008-12-20T19:59Z,fart...you dipshit.....comment on quality is good...but you whine like a leeching bich
[T],hoch88,2010-04-03T18:32Z,"When first reading ...'s piece here I thought it was a bit childish and ungrateful to the contribution, but after downloading it and analyzing the files, I agree. And I'm annoyed as well. The quality of this movie don't allow compromising. The precenteche of ""extras"" on this disc is huge. That makes one reflect when watching the fragile old pictures flickering by."
