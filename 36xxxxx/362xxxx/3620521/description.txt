Synopsis
Generally regarded to be the best - and most brutal - of the classic gangster films, Scarface tells the story of orginised crime┬┤s pinch on the city of Chicago during prohibition. Paul Muni plays Tony Carmonte, an ambitious hood with a Napoleonic urge to fight his way to number one gang boss. When the last of the old-style crime bosses is brutally slain down, the finger is pointed at Tony and Johnny Loro, a rival gangster. However, Tony┬┤s desire to move up the ladder is about to put him in the firing line of his peers and the police. Produced and directed by the mercurial Howard Hawks, Scarface is the movie which established both Paul Muri and his coin flipping aide George Raft as major Hollywood stars..
