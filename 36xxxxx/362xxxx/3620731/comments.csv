Hi Guy?s
Do you recognize this also.
You are a Service Engineer and started too work by a new company.
Part of the deal is a brand new LapTop computer with dual Core 2GB of Ram Memory and 200GB harddisc. A computer that makes even Bill Gates jealous. When you arrived a few minutes later on your workspace, and started too play with the laptop, you discovered that de laptop is protected, and much more then switch on and off  is not possible anymore. You have a computer that can shoot a rocket too the moon, and you can use only less than 5% from it.

A real Engineer can not live with that, and that?s also the reason that I have surfed many weeks on the internet until I have found this wonderful program.

Working:
This is how it works.
Put a empty floppy into the drive
Start the image file
The floppy will be formatted and the data will be write on.
You have now a bootable floppy.

Load the floppy in the drive from the protected computer and boot from the floppy-drive.
The computer start-up and write a file UPLOAD.txt on the floppy.
This is the txt file with the scrambled passwords.

The next step is:
Put the floppy in a computer connected too with the internet.
Goto http://loginrecovery.com
Put in the next data: Your e-mail and the a:/UPLOAD.txt file
Now you have the choice:
When you pays for it than then send you the passwords in minutes.
When will have the passwords for noting then you must wait 48 hours before you receive the email with the passwords.
When I used this program, I have waited 4 days before the passwords arrived.
Have patients!

Are we glad with this program?????????

In other words it has its limitations.  So worth a shot, but dont bother paying just wait the 48hrs "
,Zabeli2002,2007-08-14T19:27Z,"Crazy people! give your passwords to me better. hahaahahaahahahahaa

Naive dritseker som prøver seg på alle mulig måter å stjele informasjon fra andre.
ufff ufff"

I am going to share with you six easy methods that allow you to recover Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2008, 2003, 2000 Server and NT User/Administrator Password efficiently, safely and easily. Before that, please prepare an blank CD/DVD or USB flash thumb drive. You will need to burn some password recovery soft into the disk later on. After that, you will use this disk to reset windows password.
