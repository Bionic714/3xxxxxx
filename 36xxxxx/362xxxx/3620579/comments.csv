,FourthTry,2007-02-25T15:55Z,"Don't worry about 99,9% - just one file seems to be stuck, but it isn't. Change the file extension as .cbr and you are able to view the file. It's complete."

Which file are we supposed to change, precisely? My client doesn't tell me how much of each file is downloaded, unfortunately."
,chainsoar,2011-05-29T04:13Z,"The broken comic in question, #9 'The Crab with the Golden Claws' is already saved under the extension.cbr so FourthTry's solution is not working for me. Suggestions?"
