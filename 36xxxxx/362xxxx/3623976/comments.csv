,DSMeTailer,2007-10-23T01:22Z,"Alright, after about 2 weeks, this finished downloading!  I have been seeding for another 2 weeks, and am about to pass 9 times upload/download ratio.  I AM STILL THE ONLY ONE SEEDING!  I have given this to 9 whole individuals, yet none of them has has the courtesy to KEEP it in their torrent client, should someone else need it.  I will continue to seed to keep this alive, but the majority of you piratebayer's out there should be ashamed of yourself!  It is called a file SHARING network for a reason you inconsiderate douchebags."

,POOPIEMON,2008-04-20T19:35Z,"does anyone notice this game, while playing the colors will randomly invert. the only way i've found to fix it is to minimize it and maximize it but then sometimes you cant use ur mouse&keyboard and have to restart the level by restarting the program. any better suggestions?

anyone have swarm rampage?"
