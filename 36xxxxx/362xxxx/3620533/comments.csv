[V],Kuthumi,2007-02-18T08:02Z,How can you know about a Trojan 3 minutes after the torrent has been posted? masseur has uploaded lots of good rips here.
[V],Kuthumi,2007-02-18T17:15Z,"Thanks to kollll for a high-quality upload of a long awaited film. Just finished download, my AVG installation (updated today) finds no problems with the packed or unpacked files. Picture 9/10, sound 9/10, now playing without problems in my standalone divX-dvd player. Shame on people who spread unneccessary fear."

,wow-wow,2007-03-03T03:34Z,"Hi - I just hope that with this download i'll be able to see the whole movie because the last download was not working after 6-7 min. into cd2 - and i have tried multiple players to run it (vlc-bsplayer and winplayer10 - all failing.) ... and i am interested to see how neale copes with all his hardship on his way to succes in understanding something about himself and others - and Gods way of working through miracolous ways.

,szen,2008-03-01T19:49Z,"First part works perfectly, but I can`t unzip the second part - there seems to be an error with 2 rar parts. Anyone knows why this could happen - seems people here have managed to unpack it."
