,deterramone,2007-03-19T23:28Z,"Hey, I'm new to this and just finished downloading the torrent, but have no idea how to open it or what program to use.  Somebody mind helping me out?"
,assassinmonk,2007-04-09T06:15Z,"Deterramone: 
You probably have to use winrar to uncompress the files, then you should probably have an .avi file that you can watch.  I'm in the process of leeching.  Check back in a day or two.
Winrar is free, just search the net......."
,assassinmonk,2007-04-09T17:07Z,"Just follow the directions above.

,Posthumous,2008-04-20T02:26Z,Not all of the files are WinRar.  Only 400 MB or so are winrar.  How the hell do you open the other files?!  Why can't this just be an avi.?  That would be so much easier!
