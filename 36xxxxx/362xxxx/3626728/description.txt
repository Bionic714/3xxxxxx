   Many Java developers are now looking at Ruby, and the Ruby on Rails web 
   framework. If you are one of them, this book is your guide. Written by 
   experienced developers who love both Java and Ruby, this book will show 
   you, via detailed comparisons and commentary, how to translate your 
   hard-earned Java knowledge and skills into the world of Ruby and Rails. 
   If you are a Java programmer, you shouldn't have to start at the very 
   beginning! You already have deep experience with the design issues that 
   inspired Rails, and can use this background to quickly learn Ruby and 
   Rails. But Ruby looks a lot different from Java, and some of those 
   differences support powerful abstractions that Java lacks. We'll be your 
   guides to this new, but not strange, territory. In each chapter, we 
   build a series of parallel examples to demonstrate some facet of web 
   development. Because the Rails examples sit next to Java examples, you 
   can start this book in the middle, or anywhere else you want. You can 
   use the Java version of the code, plus the analysis, to quickly grok 
   what the Rails version is doing. We have carefully cross-referenced and 
   indexed the book to facilitate jumping around as you need to. Thanks to 
   your background in Java, this one short book can cover a half-dozen 
   books' worth of ideas: 

     - Programming Ruby
     - Building MVC (Model/View/Controller) Applications
     - Unit and Functional Testing
     - Security
     - Project Automation
     - Configuration
     - Web Services
