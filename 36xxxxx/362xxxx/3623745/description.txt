Quoted from http://www.rockunited.com:

"Intrigue" (1986) is for me the band's finest moment. Inside a weird, very un-hard rock cover lies a very good album. The band opted for a slightly harder edge and a more guitar-oriented sound, but at the same time they managed to write some great hooks and melodies. They even had their first chart-topping hit with the single "Banging On Drums" and made a video for the title track (an epic ballad), filmed in the suitably grandiose surroundings of their home area in Lapland.

The aforementioned single hit opens the album, a fierce rocker with a good chorus. "Drag Me To The Moon" features another excellent chorus, while "Angel Of Mercy" borrows a little from Kiss' "Heaven's On Fire" without being a full-on rip-off. Next up there's "Dump Me", arguably one of the finest songs of the band with a killer chorus. The stomping "No Man's Land" and more uptempo "Cut" follow, both good, solid tracks. The title track sees the band moving into a different direction, as it is a majestic, almost progressive ballad that reminds me of Queensr√øche and the likes.

The last four tracks lead us back the more familiar waters. "To The Crux" is a decent hard rocker, "Na Na Naa" a catcy, simple sing-along anthem originally recorded by Cozy Powell, "To The Mountain" a frantic, yet melodic track while the closing number "Under The Freeway" represents the more thoughtful side of the band, with some neat tempo changes and somewhat weird lyrics.
