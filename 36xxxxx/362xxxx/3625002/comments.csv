,TD0607,2007-02-23T19:54Z,"My download from isohunt has now finished.  So unless you need the HR (high resolution) version I can highly recommend getting it from isohunt.

I would post the normal version my self if it wasn't for my lousy upstream speed..."
,screenslave,2007-02-23T22:37Z,Amateur hour...go to Isohunt instead - I'm sure this season of Grey's will be finished before most of us complete this download from espux.

,espux,2007-02-26T18:02Z,"I recommend using VLC player to view the HR.HDTV clips. 
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
If you insist using Windows media player or others you probably need to install a AC3 (Dolby Digital http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital ) codec like:

,iluna,2007-03-02T16:27Z,Next Episode Airs: 15/03/07 in USA
,eightballorama,2007-03-13T10:08Z,"all of your uploads have been great quality - thanks! 

anyone uploading should have AC3 codec and DiVx support if you want to run these on Quiktime"
