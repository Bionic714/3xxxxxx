Description: Emir Kusturica's moving tale tells the story of Perhan, a telekinetic Gypsy teenager who embarks in a quest to find enough money to cure his sister and marry his girlfriend. He finds himself under the wing of a deceptively protective Gypsy mobster who steers him in a life of crime that will eventually lead him to loose all that he once held dear. This film won Emir Kusturica an award at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival for his direction and was the first feature to be filmed with its entire dialogue in the Gypsy language, Romany.

Very good DVD rip done by quequetz with first-ever selectable english subtitles done by bluesoul.
