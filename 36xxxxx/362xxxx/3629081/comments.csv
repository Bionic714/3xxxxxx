,anonomo,2010-08-22T03:37Z,"hey YUWA would love to see more yugoslavia movies!
Use Avidemux to render subtitles is best bet because works on all OS.
Or Handbrake to add subtitles as a seperate track.
Ofcourse 100s of other software but I find these one the most easy and reliable, but still not that reliable!"
