This is for restoring a softmodded (or hard modded) xbox, this has been used AND tested over 20 xbox's and they consisted of ALL xbox versions (v1.0 to v1.6)


This can help you if you wish to play on xblive but you will have to make a new account with ms

thanks for sharing and please SEED

Notes about my upload limits, I do from time to time play an online game and as these times are random please be patient when downloading this and give it a few (insert hours/days/weeks here) before you complain to me.

after this has been uploaded to a factor of 25 I am going to stop seeding this as there should be enough out there to seed this with out me

THIS FILE WAS REQUESTED! so don't chew me up about leaving after 25 seeders show in my client.

but saying that if you need this and there are no more people seeding then I will reseed if asked ^_^

once again, sorry about the discription being here"
,^eRrOR^,2007-02-21T12:00Z,"oh, forgot to add that this is for putting your xbox hard drive to the factory default (restoring to an unmodded state) you will be able to redo a softmod if you'd like but as I said, this is for restoring to faactory condition"
