Recorded Live in Forth Worth, Texas, USA, on May 9-10, 1997

This DVD is an excellent representation of the 90's era of Metallica - an era marking a shift away from the thrash metal of their youth and maturing into greater musicians (in the sense their repertoire has expanded). Exploring blues and country and mixing it with a pop flavour whilst still retaining the hard rock element of the 80's, this DVD reflects all of this.

Opening with a fun jam (a collection of riffs that would later become 'Bad Seed' on ReLoad, which hadn't been released at the time of the concert), they head into 'So What' and the music doesn't stop for another 90 mins or so. James entertains with his usual speeches that never get boring (unlike a certain someone PHIL) and the camera work, whilst not superb, is definitely above par. The lighting however does get annoying at times and a constant blue is not the most interesting
