,trosso,2007-02-28T16:13Z,"Is this the real release and not the same as ""Resident.Evil.4.EMUDVD-Unleashed""? Because that version is not the real PC release.

And that version of the game wasent free from errors and stuff. So, is this the Official release of Resident Evil, released by Ubisoft?"
,anuskasvo,2007-02-28T17:02Z,"Unleashed version IS the real one, I have played it through and it has no errors or bugs, works perfectly. Graphics are crappy, 'coz it's just a simple conversion to pc, just to maximize Capcom's profit."
,NachoVidal,2007-02-28T18:47Z,BOTH: Hatred release and Unleashed release are 100% OK! The difference between the both releases is that the Hatred release is Full DVD release while Unleashed release is EmuDVD release.
,grapedog,2007-03-01T05:34Z,whats the difference between a FullDVD release and an EMU DVD release?
[T],Knaster,2007-03-01T07:44Z,trosso is a moron. I just love stupid comments like yours lmao

Not necessarily you've obviously not played the PC version of GTA San Andreas, It blows the PS2 version out of the water"
,trosso,2007-03-02T07:51Z,UBISOFT is the official publisher of the Resident Evil 4 game. Shouldent Ubisofts loggo been seen anywhere? Its just CAPCOM. And the folder that the game is installed in is also capcom. Just weired?

,Teedas,2007-03-02T18:12Z,How do i find the CDKEY for this game?..
,Teedas,2007-03-02T18:14Z,How do i find the cdkey for this game?.
,VilleR2,2007-03-02T22:17Z,"CD-key is in the .nfo file... This game is really just a simple convertation from the GC/PS2 game... graphix sux, controllers as well... Buy the game for the Cube instead!!"
,Wiiga,2007-03-03T01:40Z,"I have to agree with VilleR2 here. This is just converted console game. Not fun at all playing on PC. I'll rather wait for a real PC version with Mouse support etc comes. 
I'll keep seeding for a while for those who want to give it a try anyways. :)"
,gordonfreeman797,2007-03-03T15:45Z,"OK got the game n looks reasonable, thanks kolll. However, anyone any ideas how to set up controls and other game settings?? Am using the normal PC & mouse set up. This dl also has a dll file missing...d3dx9_30.dll which u can find on the net, just in case it happens to u."
,lordkhan,2007-03-03T16:35Z,The real version was released the 2nd March =/ I've found no torrents with that one. This version doesn't even have lightning ;)
,lordkhan,2007-03-03T16:38Z,"And you should notice if it's the real version, the high res, lightning and stuff"
,gravyhusker,2007-03-03T19:43Z,"Yes, this is a converted console game and the cutscenes look a bit sour BUT stop being so fucking negative. It's free and that's the bottom line. Wait for the proper release (which has been put off for a year now) or go suck a nut. As for setup just press autoplay and the setupmenu will allow you to change resolution (up to 1600x1200) change between a controller and mosue  support. "
,jonwayne,2007-03-04T06:39Z,"ok my grafix card keeps reseting everytime i get to the actuale gameplay, brings me back into windows and then wont go back into the game, however i can still hear sound. 

so i tryed to play the game in a window, only this time when it crashed my grafix card my whole computer crashed with it.

i have a ati radeon 9200 and if i remeber corectly specs say it will work... so what gives?"

,Wiiga,2007-03-05T00:29Z,gravuhusker: Would you like to share that funny stuff you are smoking? Cause there is NO MOUSE SUPPORT in the setuptool! So if you have a special way to get mousesupport please explain! :P

Can anyone please tell me what's wrong. Thank u."
