,Siddhiyana,2007-02-21T15:51Z,I can't get the graphics to work. Everything turns into blue and black boxes and it seems kinda laggy. Any suggestions?
,Laos,2007-02-22T20:27Z,"Have you updated your game? 
-Version v.1.22 fixes many XP bugs.

And for the lag:
-Go to the options and turn off the ""Limit Game Speed"" option. I think it's too effective. If the game runs too fast get some kind of ""cpukiller"" software to limit game speed. 

""blue and black boxes""
-Does your screen support 640x480 res?
-What kind of gpu-card do you have?"
,e22e,2007-04-04T14:21Z,"hey i canÂ´t get it to work 
first when i update then i copy the crack and cut it in to the map and then i tryd to run the game  but it dosent work ive got a error report help."
,FalseAccount,2007-10-12T00:04Z,"Daemon tools doesn't read the second disk for me. Everytime I try to play the game it tells me to insert the correct disk, and I get nothing when I run the iso in DT."
,DANZ1G,2007-11-23T02:06Z,"Step 1: I unzipped Revenant XP
Step 2: I updated EXACTLY as the howto file told me.
Step 3: I copied the NOCD Crack files from Disk1

I get an error EVERY time I try and load the game.

If I don't install the CD Crack It tells me to insert the correct disk.

My computer is pretty new, so it shouldn't be an issue. 

Is there something I am doing wrong?"
,DANZ1G,2007-11-23T02:17Z,"I might add, that the Revenant DEMO works on my computer... So, I assume its an error with the installation/upadates/CD Crack.  Is there a missing file or something?"
,Laos,2007-12-01T18:13Z,"Game asks CD2 for playing?
-You probably haven't cracked the game.

The crack doesn't work?
-You have to install the latest update&crack from: 
http://m0001.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_revenant.shtml
-Tip: CD1-crack is only for v.1.00 -version!

Are these CD-images fine?
-Yeah. Just tested them and no errors."
,FalseAccount,2007-12-04T03:45Z,"I can't get the crack to work now, I got a message saying, ""This application has failed to start because mss32.dll was not found"". Please give me a hand here because I really want to play this game."
,Laos,2007-12-09T13:50Z,"FalseAccount:
-mss32.dll is related to ""Miles Sound System, v. 6.6.7.0""

Try to download the missing dll from: http://www.google.com/search?q=mss32.dll"
,FalseAccount,2007-12-17T23:30Z,"Ok, I have the mss32.dll but I don't know where to extract it to."
,vrts,2007-12-19T15:30Z,Hy!There's no music in the game!Please help!
,Nexus8472,2007-12-22T09:33Z,"is there a problem with the music when running the game in XP?
the character voices and SFX come out fine but no bg music. does it work for you?"
,vrts,2007-12-23T18:28Z,"Yes, but there's no bg music."
,Nexus8472,2008-01-04T14:27Z,"anyone know how to get the background music running?
ive played the demo and the musics really good"
,vrts,2008-01-13T10:21Z,this is my problem too!
,d3s,2008-02-02T14:52Z,got no sound in the game at all :/ can anyone help ???
,instantpaydayloans,2008-03-02T17:20Z,"I'm awfully retarded this morning, could anyone give me more detailed XP install instructions?"
,Klaster_1,2008-05-10T17:51Z,"What kind of music do you want? Audio CD?
With this lame ISO images it's impossible :("
,dethassault,2008-06-09T22:01Z,Some install instructions might help.
,M4rkl4r1234,2008-06-11T19:07Z,"Well I can't get this to work, it doesn't matter how I do!
First off, I use XP so I unpacked the Rar file called ""revenant.smackrazor.install.xp.zip"".
Second, I updated the game to 1.22v.
Third, I copied the crack from ""revenant.smackrazor.patch.1.22.zip""
Fourth, A window pops up and tells me ""Revenant has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.""
What to do? I really want to play this classic!"
,MerchantOfDeath,2008-06-12T03:41Z,"...The torrent won't even download to my computer. Keeps saying, ""Locating Sources..."" Then it says, ""Connecting..."" Then it goes to ""Downloading from 1 Host,"" but doesn't start to download, and then it just repeats the process."
,six10,2008-07-05T15:24Z,"How to install xp version (no one has win98 anymore anyway):

1.mount cd1 with DT
2.install patch version 1.22 (reverant update 1.22)
3.crack the game (reverant patch1.22-->reverant.exe)

Files is this torrent are named weird, so dont be confused (it is usually crack, not patch), all you need is these 3 files-->
1.revenant.smackrazor.cd1.iso
2.revenant.smackrazor.update.1.22.zip
3.revenant.smackrazor.patch.1.22.zip

Why are there other files i do not know, as i dont really know why there is a cd 2, because the game works fine for me without it."
,six10,2008-07-05T15:46Z,"There is no background music...i guess the other files are there included to fix that, but so far no luck. I tried to copy the mp3 files from the cd2 in , but it doesnt work"
,Laos,2008-07-18T21:10Z,"revenant.smackrazor.cd1.iso
-Image for CD1, use this to install under Win98.
revenant.smackrazor.cd2.iso
-Image for CD2, use this to install under Win98.
revenant.smackrazor.install.xp.zip
-I couldn't run installer under XP, so use this when CD1 installer refuses to work.
revenant.smackrazor.patch.1.00.zip
-Ah, sorry. This is crack for v.1.00 version.
-Don't use this. Just update to newer version.
revenant.smackrazor.patch.1.22.zip
-Sorry again. This is crack for version v-1.22.
-To use this, you need to update your game to v.1.22
revenant.smackrazor.update.1.22.zip
-This is update. Use it after installing/unpacking game. Needs crack or mounted CD.

,amgreenhawk,2008-08-31T18:38Z,"Thanks Laos! My CD2's music is distorted...maybe due to wear and tear...i'm downloading this to have a good backup.

And for those who're having problems, please bear in mind that this is one of those very picky game which runs preferably under Windows 95 or 98. The patch might or might not work completely according to your hardware components. 

I'm playing this in my dedicated Windows 98 machine."
,krabbesatan,2009-02-06T03:58Z,"Alright, this just isn't working, I have tried everything I can think of, including the instructions written here. I am using XP

I have tried installing from the iso files, then patching with the 1.22 update/patch. Installing it in the games directory. Then going on to copying the 1.22v crack into the directory. Doesn't work. I have done this both in my own specified folder and in the ""pre-set/recommended install folder in case it mattered, which it did once with another game. Doesn't work.

I have tried simply unzipping revenant.smackrazor.install.xp.zip, then updating with the 1.22 patch into that directory and after copying the the 1.22 crack to the same directory. Doesn't work.

It's always the same error messages, either: ""Revenant has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience."" or ""insert cd 2"" or both. Now I have tried running it with the cd 2 iso mounted in daemon tools lite ofcourse, doesn't work.

Has anyone actually gotten this to work? If so how? I'm out of ideas and starting to think that this is simply bogus. If you're a troll Laos, then good for you, you made me rage at my computer for an hour. If not, thanks for trying, but so far this download is just full of fail.

TL:DR: I've done everything I can think of, but can't get it to work. Unless it is later revealed that I totally noobed, I'd advice everyone to stay clear or prepare to rage. Also halp!"
,FalseAccount,2009-02-07T07:52Z,more or less the same as krabbesatan here. It's a shame because I really wanted to play this game
,drakekc,2009-02-11T03:12Z,"For WinXP SP2 try this:

1. Install via cd1

2. Make a folder in installed dir named 'CD' copy entire contents of cd2 into it

3. Update to v1.22

4. Copy & paste crack v1.22 into installed dir & double click 'Revenant.exe'

5. Open 'Revenant.ini' and change lines 'MoviePath=""[CDROM]""' to 'MoviePath="".\CD""' and 'Software3D=No' to        'Software3D=Yes', save and exit

6. Right click on 'Revenant.exe', choose properties, compatibility and run in windows 95 mode, apply and exit

7. Double click 'Revenant.exe' in installed dir to play.

WARNING: Do not start game via launcher as doing so will alter line 'Software3D=Yes' to 'Software3D=No' in 'Revenant.ini' which unables the game to start. If this happens go to 'Revenant.ini' and change line 'Software3D=No' to 'Software3D=Yes'.

Hope this works."
,ust2,2009-02-15T17:39Z," If you're having problems, it's most likely the game creators fault. Don't blame the uploader.

 Despite all the bugs and slow pace this game was still great!

Thx for this upload!! Seriously"
,krabbesatan,2009-02-20T00:20Z,"Many thanks to drakekc, you sir are a wizard! That solution worked perfectly for me, though I would never have figured it out on my own. 

ust2 is right, I shouldn't blame the uploader. I was just incredibly irritated from trying and failing repeatedly. It truly seemed like this game wouldn't work no matter what. This game seems to need different solutions depending on which kind of machine/OS you're on. So if drakekc's solution doesn't work, try one of the others in the comment section."
,Nelko,2009-03-30T15:12Z,"I have the original copy of this game, and I can confirm that this upload works identically to my own. 

You should know that there are methods you can use to get Revenant working on Windows XP with Direct3D acceleration (read: no software emulation). It's buggy, but for some it works.

Commonly, the feature that stops most modern computers from running Revenant is the ""Surface Fast Locks"". Disabling this under Advanced Options in the launcher will stabilize your graphics, and everything will be pretty again. 

You may even maximize cache and preload chunks, as well as enable the advanced visual features in-game.

Also note that the no-cd patch may also cause some computers to display the ""Insert Disc 2"" message even after changing the CD path inside the INI file. 

Try clicking OK. Sometimes the launcher continues execution of Revenant despite the error and runs perfectly."
,loongear,2010-02-08T01:45Z,"Haven't downloaded or ever played this before but I am pretty sure that I have never seen any other thread where people help other so well either.

I want to thank all of you too."
,danieldaluz89,2010-09-19T04:03Z,"is it compatible to windows 7 ? ...

,blackxino,2010-12-25T15:50Z,"this is retarded man and doesn't work!

I remember playing this game and it was a demo version but awesome!

I do remember the demo having bugs or problem...so the same can apply to this full version.

I've tried everything, doesn't work on vista, the bullsh Insert CD2 just keeps coming up!"
,Svefn-g-englar,2011-10-16T15:45Z,Confirmed working on Win 7 x64 SP1. Used drakekc's instructions and it fixed my problems.
