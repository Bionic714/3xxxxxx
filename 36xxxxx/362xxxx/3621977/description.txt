_____________________________________________ Game Info

Locke D'Averam is the Revenant, a resurrected warrior from an earlier age. Summoned by a powerful warlord to rescue his abducted daughter, Locke embarks on quest that will take him through a myriad of sinister locations, collecting magic items and battling a host of fearsome monsters. As he attempts to recover his fighting skills he is plagued by memories of his past existence, memories that begin to merge with his current quest in a series of stunning revelations. Revenant is played from a third person isometric point of view similar to Diablo, but adds an important gameplay element to its combat sequences: combos. Players can perform different combination attacks with different keystrokes, which adds quite a bit of depth to the game.
