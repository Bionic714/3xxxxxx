,ApeHanger,2007-07-13T04:28Z,"If you like Hellraiser or Saw, you will like this. So many ways to die, and in extremely creative and overly elaborate ways....

,MonteZumal,2011-05-31T10:38Z,"Thx for the upload I've seen these before & I quite like them.

@Rompastompa

Saw is similar to Cube not the other way around, due the original Cube was released quite a bit before the Saw movies ;)"
,MonteZumal,2011-05-31T10:52Z,"Working perfectly! Seen them before, but the trilogy wasn't part of my movie collection yet. Thanks for the upload.

3 movies in just under 9 minutes downloading, not too shabby :)"
,snowbirds,2011-12-10T23:46Z,"Started watching the first one...

Video is heavily pixelated.  I'm going to look elsewhere.

Thanks anyway to the uploader for making this available!"
