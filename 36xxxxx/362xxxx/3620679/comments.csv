Much appreciated!!"
,Fratyyr,2007-02-18T08:57Z,"That's wonderful!
Please let me know if everything works properly..?

Thank you all!"
,harryhaffa,2007-02-18T21:49Z,Meny thanks. How meny disks are there.
,Fratyyr,2007-02-19T03:30Z,"A lot, actually.. The first three series, which we're produced from 1978 until.. 1980 I believe, contain 41 episodes on 12 DVDs (4 per series)
Eight years later, in 1988 they've started filming the series 4 through 7.. Regrettably, Mrs. Hall is no more, and even Helen is played by another actress.. 

The first three series are terrific, and make a beautiful ending!"
,Fratyyr,2007-02-19T03:36Z,"Please help me keeping this torrent alive by seeding enough, I can't keep them all alive myself..

Thank you!"
,rddsm,2007-05-24T09:32Z,"I cannot play this disk on any of my software or hardware DVD players. The other two disks that I downloaded work fine, but this one will not play at all, even from the hard drive. Because it will not play from the hard disk, it is not an issue with burning the DVD.

I have done a forced recheck and it verified. Because of that, I have stopped seeding this disk.

Did anyone else have a problem with this one?"
,rddsm,2007-06-28T03:19Z,"Someone seems to have put out a different version of this disk. I just finished downloading it, and burning it. This version seems fine.

I am now seeding this disk along with all of season 1 and almost all of season 2. The others have been seeding for quite a while and my intent is to keep seeding for a while longer.

Thank you Fratyyr for making these available, and everyone who has seeded these great disks."
