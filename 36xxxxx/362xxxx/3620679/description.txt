James Herriot
All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1, Disc 2 (DVD)

In 1937, a young, newly-qualified surgeon arrives in the picturesque village of Darrowby to take up 

his first job in the established veterinary practice of Siegfried and his brother Tristan Farnon. But 

in rural Yorkshire, with few medicines available, the treatment of sick animals still seems to be 

rooted in the Dark Ages. This, together with the country-folk's inherent suspicion of strangers, 

poses problems for James Herriot in the early years of his career.
