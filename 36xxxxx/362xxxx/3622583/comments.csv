It's the old GTA3. GTA LCS didn't come out for PC.
That said, this looks like a rip judging by the size."

,IcarusBeDamned,2007-03-23T01:59Z,"@""the masta""
He means the batch file. It's called ""setup"".
You can then run the gta3 icon (the one with the picture).
It works, trust me."
,Winter Night,2007-03-27T13:11Z,"Working perfectly.

,Al2x,2007-05-19T23:52Z,"You have to download the file (obviously), then run the "".BAT"" file, it should only take around 5-10 minutes, then create a shortcut from ""GTA3.exe"" put it on your Desktop, and then run the game."

,OnyxiaKing,2008-12-05T16:24Z,"The game works perfectly, those who is woundering about the radio... you need the real GTA 3 CD to listen to the music coz its not installed with the game, it plays the songs from the CD
