If you think this war is about Oil and Empire for George Bush and company, think again. Peter Schaenk exposes Israel as the guiding hand in this Middle East invasion.

Rebuilding Solomon's Temple figures into the geopolitical goals of Israel. Don't be fooled by the claim that Israel is the only secular democracy in the Middle East. It has no constitution, as Talmudic law is the "law of the land".

Peter lays out the argument, that this war is about a "Spiritual Realignment" necessary to bring about a "One World Government". The rebuilding of Temple Mount, or Solomon's Temple is a necessary step in order to bring about this "New World Order".
