,matli,2007-04-03T12:53Z,"The title and the description of this one is misleading. It is not Pingu Forever, and it is definitely not 24 of the classic stop motion-animated episodes.

This is a DVD with 7 of the newly produced computer-animated Pingu episodes. 

Look here instead for the real Pingu Forever:
