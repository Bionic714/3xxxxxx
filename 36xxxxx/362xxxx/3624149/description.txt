Highlights: 

- BURNING LOVE an incredible new clip combining footage from both rehearsals and live performances (1972) 

- JOHNNY B. GOODE finally a ?proper? edited version, WITHOUT the talking as on the 25th dvd. 

- KING CREOLE take 18, Fantastic clip, although this version has a much slower tempo, then the released version, the editing is awesome! 

- HEY, HEY, HEY A new high-tech clip, gives a totally new dimension to this song, this could (should) be released officially! 

- ROAD MEDLEY 2006, outtake footage, combined with outtake audio, and even some unexpected surprises are included

- DEVIL IN DISQUISE, this may come as a shock to some fans, it 
is ?an ode to Plastic Pris?

- THAT?S ALL RIGHT ? live version from 1971, soundboard sound, Elvis in Black Matador jumpsuit!"
