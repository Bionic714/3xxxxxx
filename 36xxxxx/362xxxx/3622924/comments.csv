,Dadida,2007-02-22T19:11Z,"Thx for the torrent why does my torrents get like a ""White Paper with the name ""BT"" ?? and its says RAR - File somebody know i dont have a clue i cant play them, not all torrents thoo.. ?? PLZ"
,larsev,2007-03-28T23:47Z,"A .rar file is a compressed file.
You need a client such as WinRar, the latest WinZip or any other client which is able to handle the rar format"
,aberclive,2012-02-12T22:32Z,Not all files are mp3 so cannot be played.  Of the two cd's only 6 tracks are playable once the file is unzipped.
,juanelias,2012-04-11T07:48Z,"Jesus christ, there are a lot of newfags here. I'm assuming the files that ""Won't play"" are something other than mp3, probably mp4 or flac. god forbid they are wma. they will play, you jjust need a different audio player, something like media monkey or itunes. and as previously stated, to access files that are labeled "".RAR"" you need to download winzip, or some other program that will unzip these files. think of it like one big folder that contains all the music. And please, after the file is done downloading, leave it in your client for a couple days and let it ""seed"". you should see the word ""seeding"" where it used to say ""downloading"". this is your way of paying back this free download. it allows other people to download also."
