Quality?
Audio?

If you're not providing a sample, at least give some more details to save us downloading 852MB to find out if it's good quality...!"
,sweatyrich,2007-02-22T10:34Z,"OK - my bad - It DOES say DVD rip, but what region? Had audio been sync'd later or direct from DVD...?"
[V],RosaMannen,2007-02-22T11:52Z,What region?? haha :)
,sweatyrich,2007-02-22T12:03Z,"What region has it been ripped from, dickweed!

Region 5 disks mostly don't have English audio and it's ""added"" later, much like a TS.
Still laughing?"
,withe,2007-02-22T16:38Z,"Its a rip from a pre release dvd, no property of or Time Code on the screen. Good picture and sound..."
,afoulks12,2007-02-22T17:55Z,"I am the seeder and yes this is ripped from a pre release dvd, in engligh like the title says.  When I ripped it, I removed the region codes.  You should have no doubts about the torrent, it is good."
,sweatyrich,2007-02-23T11:25Z,"@afoulks12: Thanks for the extra info.
I realise that the DVD region has no relevance to an AVI, I was simply concerned that the English audio may have been 'sync'd with the picture from a different source, but obviously this is not the case.
Thanks for the u/l."
,Spherez,2007-02-24T00:14Z,Any chance we can get the DVDR?

Not to sound dumb, but I am not sure what that is.  I have the disk and I converted it to AVI, but to make a DVDR, I am not sure the proccess."

Download DVDRip, rip the DVD to hard drive - without region code, then upload the files.

That'll be a 8 GB upload though. So the next step, should you choose to take it, is to use DVDShrink on the rip to reduce the size to about 4.3 GB, so it can fit on a single layer DVD.

Probably shouldn't do this if you don't have good upload bandwidth. At least 1 Megabit/sec, preferably > 2 Megabit / sec."

It's pretty easy, though a little time consuming.

Sorry."

,jackoyo,2007-03-05T18:50Z,"Picture quality is pretty good... has been cropped top and bottom by a few pixels ..(maybe 10?) so the scrolling screener text at the bottom only shows top half.
Sound is not so good... it's been compressed quite a lot, or badly... so there is phasing in the upper-mid and higher frequencies. This becomes a bit annoying, for me at least being a bit of an audiophile."
,Maoma,2007-03-13T11:23Z,thanx
,sthener,2007-03-13T11:26Z,to convert from avi to dvd use Cucusoft AVI to DVD MPEG creator pro I'm using it and it works very good
,DooDoo Butter,2007-03-15T15:37Z,"stop wasting your time converting files so you can burn...go spend 8- bucks get a divix player and burn as data. You can fit like 6 movies on a disk, and you really dont lose any quality!!"
,DooDoo Butter,2007-03-15T15:38Z,80 bucks*

,surma884,2008-09-26T04:18Z,"The audio is low quality.   Cropping is messed up also.  I know this is an old release, but I just want to let people know before they download.  They can probably find a better rip with AC3 audio."
