Playboy cartoon comics


Playboy has always been blessed with a special stable of great artists who happen to draw cartoons. They go far beyond the ordinary perceptions of human conduct to make us take a closer look at ourselves, especially our sexual selves, and show us our preoccupations and passions in a new and delightful way. We've never been prissy about sex and we know you aren't. Our sweet young things, our terrible tarts, our winsome wives and their suitors and studs will particularly warm the cockles of those who love to belly laugh.
Thanks to Buck Brown, Eldon Dedini, John Dempsey, Alden Erikson, Michael Ffolkes, Kiraz, Phil Interlandi, Roy Raymonde, Smilby, Doug Sneyd, Mike Williams, Leo Garel, Sidney Harris, J. B. Handelsman, Tom Mason, Catherine Beaunez, Lou Brooks, Randy Jones, Gene Schwimmer, Bobby London, Creig Flessel, Virgil Partch, Frank Baginski, John Stevens, Reynolds Dodson and J. Michael Leonard for their contributions to our well-being.
