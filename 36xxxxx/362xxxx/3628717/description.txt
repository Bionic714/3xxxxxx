Audio bootleg of Black Sabbath's famous Paris 1970 show, one of the best sounding versions available.

'Paris ?70' (as it is best known) is one of the most popular films of Black Sabbath in concert during the 70's. It is one of only a few pro-shot concert films available to us and certainly the most complete one from this era. However, there is more than enough evidence to indicate that this show was actually recorded in Brussels and NOT Paris at this recording has so long been attributed to. The most likely candidate would seem to be a scheduled gig on October 3rd. However, I won't change the date on this one until I can find definitve proof, as well as a venue name.

Originally filmed on 16mm for the Belgian TV program ?Pop Shop?, it was later re-broadcast on British TV by Yorkshire and Tyne Tees Television, where it aired in 2-30 minute episodes. Footage from this show later appeared on some official releases, such as THE BLACK SABBATH STORY - VOLUME 1 and Ozzy Osbourne?s DON?T BLAME ME autobiography. The audio portion was also used for the 2002 live compilation PAST LIVES.

It goes without saying that this is one of the most essential Black Sabbath videos to have in your collection. The performance is top notch and it is the earliest known pro-shot film of the band playing a full concert. I get questions all the time about whether the band is going to release the whole thing on video. Given that they have already issued much of the audio from this show on the live compilation PAST LIVES, it remains a likely possibility.

Ozzy does sing some different lyrics for many songs and improvises some new ones during ?Hand Of Doom? and ?War Pigs?. During ?War Pigs?, he even resorts to the original lyrics for ?Walpurgis? during one verse. Although it wasn?t uncommon for Ozzy to forget lyrics, I do think makes it more likely that the songs were still somewhat new to the band at this show.

Although it is rarely mentioned in the track listings, ?Rat Salad? is performed after ?Hand Of Doom?. It would also be the last time that this song would turn up in a live Sabbath recording.
