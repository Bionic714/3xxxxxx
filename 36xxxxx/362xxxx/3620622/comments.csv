,amac13,2007-02-18T06:54Z,"WOW! I leave for a month and come back and these losers are still here commenting about how something is in the wrong category. HOLY SHIT.....YOU GUYS NEED TO REALLY GET A FUCKING LIFE. Obviously your entire lives revolves around the pirate bay and telling people that their stuff is in the wrong category. Why don't you losers go out once in a while and get yourselves laid.

P.S. Thanks so much kolll for putting this file in THIS category as most people downloading this movie wouldn't know about this fix if it wasn't in the same category as the movie."
,amac13,2007-02-18T06:56Z,This movie gets 5 stars for quality.
,rialin,2007-02-18T08:26Z,"First time commenting about wrong cat...and I know this discussion might b over but..... wrong category is like a porn in dvd section or a divx in dvd section or a game in applications.... not a fix for a dvd in dvd section

Thats totally right cat....imagine how many people would b commenting the loss of the replacement here if they didnt find it in this section.....duh

igotGOTH and MattiP...if u wanna b right cat polices learn the rules and then police all u want"
,odinstorm,2007-02-18T10:27Z,This is a DVDR file!!  Why would anyone want it putting anywhere else other than the DVDR section?
,odinstorm,2007-02-18T15:34Z,"igotGOTH - The original movie that this is the fix for is also not a complete dvd file and cannot be burnt to disc so, using your logic, that too was in the wrong category. "
,odinstorm,2007-02-18T18:32Z,"I agree with you that the torrent should have been checked and fixed before uploading, but all credit to kollll for uploading the fix so close to the original torrent when he noticed the fault, he is one of the best on PB."
,ssnielsen,2007-02-21T19:16Z,"You know this wouldn't have happened if you stopped using RARs and just seeded the iso!! 

The reasons for using rar have become completely obsolete, and the disadvantages greatly outweigh the advantages.

But thanks for the movie anyways"
,Mizled,2007-03-06T03:59Z,"GOD DAMMIT! THIS IS THE SECOND OR THIRD MOVIE YOU FUCKED UP WHEN UPLOADED KOLLLL B/C OF GOD FUCKING RAR FILES.

PLEASE FFS PLEASE QUIT UPLOADING GOD DAMN RAR'D DVDS. LEAVE THEM ISOS OR VIDEO_TS FOLDERS. SUCH A FUCKING WASTE OF TIME/BANDWIDTH TO EVEN DOWNLOAD YOUR SHIT HALF THE TIME."
,pats_brother,2007-03-06T15:55Z,"could someone maybe seed this!!!, or are you all to busy fighting over the catagory?"
,jukejunkie2,2007-09-21T03:06Z,Can someobody seed the rar fix. I downloaded the movie but there is no one seeding the fix. Thanks.
