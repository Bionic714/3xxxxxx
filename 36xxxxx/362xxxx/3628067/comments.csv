You're a moron."
,kongdvd,2007-02-27T17:44Z,"Keep on dreaming, spock123. This is the real thing and it is dead serious."
,kongdvd,2007-02-27T17:50Z,The trolls are working hard at the web for this one. Not more than TWO minutes did it take for spock123 to attack and ridicule this one. Ignore them. This video needs to be seen all over the globe. SPREAD!
,Osaka,2007-02-27T18:12Z,"Also available here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3628097

Jus1t had to re-upload it because ThePirateBay had lots of problems with all new torrents uploaded by everyone yesterday and earlier today.

I've uploaded it to youtube too under different names.

And on demonoid. There there were lots of trolls following me and one of them managed to get it deleted by asking an admin. He didn't give any reason though, so I just re-upped it there again."
,Osaka,2007-02-27T18:45Z,"Link to original mpeg that it's taken from (in case someone wants it) http://ia311517.us.archive.org/2/items/bbc200109111654-1736/V08591-16.mpg

Very large and downloads a little slowly. Make sure you use a download manager to speed it up a bit."
,jscottyh,2007-02-27T18:50Z,Yeah I downloaded this video and I guess i don't have the codec to watch it. What codec is it in.

I live in England so i should know how much the great BBC cocks up!!! 
At least twice a day!! 
Its one big joke in England
But still good footage dude!!!"
,pelgrim108,2007-02-27T20:38Z,"Great work, Kongdvd.

This is really important news.
Google is censoring it, youtube censoring it, Digg censoring. Mainstream media looking the other way.

So now the important news is on the torrentsites. Where nobody is censoring it.

I've been looking for that for ages! LOL"
,extrudedplasticdingus,2007-02-27T21:38Z,"Unsubstantiated conspiracy theories ARE very much like a disease, actually.  The Bush government doesn't know it's head from its own ass...and you expect them to pull something like this off?  

This isn't unlike the people who think a missile hit the pentagon.  If you show them photos and news footage of airplane wreckage at the scene they won't even acknowledge.  It's good when people ask questions and are skeptical, but they have to be open to the truth when appropriate.  Damn, you know?"
,Colourmegrey ,2007-02-27T21:58Z,"This is the same BBC that interviewed random job applicant live on air instead of an expert on downloading music, it was then made worse when the bbc informed peopel incorrectly that the rather reluctant interviewee was a taxi driver.

it was a disaster, things happen quickly, someone said 7 instead of 5, it was collapsing/had collapsed, jesus people get a fucking life. live broadcasts where information is sketchy at best are prone to errors."
,snikpeis,2007-02-27T23:28Z,"bobdaslob, you're the BELIEVER, we're the THINKERS. i guess it's easiest for you to just eat the crap that comes out off the US government's ass than to bother your brain with some factual information. and by the way, do you have NOTHING better to do than to spam every single torrent regarding 911 stuff?

,snikpeis,2007-02-28T04:57Z,"bobdaslob you're funny man, you should be an unemployed comedian. 
seriously, who said i fell for anything? i like to make up my own mind, which means looking into different types of info/media/aspects/whatever. i hate the idea of some guys in a tie making up the suitable truth for the mainstream media and audience. i'm not jumping to conclusions, but searching for the most plausible and probable truth. if you truly believe everything you hear from someone with a better paid job than you, you are so naive it's scary.
and i'm sorry i made you shit yourself, i'm shure your mom will clean up the mess"

We will track his treasonous ass down. We will FUCK HIM UP. After that, he can type those brain dead missives with his nose. Because there won't be anything left of him. We got a lot of cops and firefighters here in NYC who know the truth, would tear that guy limb from limb. Don't set foot in NYC, you mental slob."

,blusterboy7,2007-03-04T17:32Z,"Jesus wept. This is just desperate. Seriously, do you even think about what you're writing? Does it strike you as remotely plausible that whoever you consider was behind the 911 attacks would have briefed in advance of the attacks some ground level journo from arguably the most government-independent broadcasting company in the world? And despite being prepared for the attack, they still made a mistake?

If you consider that's a more likely slip of the tongue than the reporter just muddling up the names of the towers in the midst of all that chaos, then you're clearly a mentalist."
