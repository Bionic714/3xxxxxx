Cirque du Soleil (French for "Circus of the Sun") is an entertainment empire 
 based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and founded in Quebec in 1984 by two former 
 street performers, Guy Laliberté and Daniel Gauthier. It was an answer to a 
 call by Commissariat général aux célébrations 1534?1984 of the Quebec 
 Government for the 450th anniversary celebration of the arrival of French 
 explorer Jacques Cartier (1491?1557) to Canada. Gauthier, who left the company
 in 2001, now owns the ski area Le Massif, on the St. Lawrence River in Quebec.
 Cirque du Soleil is now "guided" by Laliberté.

  It has been described as the modern circus, and focuses upon a storyline as 
 well as amazing performances. It has several resident and touring troupes and 
 draws heavily from the circus tradition. Emphasizing the use of humans as 
 performers, Cirque du Soleil does not make use of animals. Instead, its 
 performances combine elements of street performances and busking, circus, 
 opera, ballet, and rock music. Acts include contortionists, jugglers, feats 
 of strength, clowning, and trapeze artists. Their costumes are very colorful. 
 Cirque shows traditionally do not use pre-recorded music; with some exceptions 
 all music is played live, and in many performances the spoken parts are done 
 in Cirquish, an imaginary language invented by the company.
