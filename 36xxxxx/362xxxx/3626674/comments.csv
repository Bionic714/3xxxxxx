,naerogah,2008-02-18T08:32Z,"This torrent appears to be the soundtracks for AlegrĂ­a, Delirium, Dralion, Journey of Man, La Nouba, MystĂ¨re, and ""O"". Only Delirium is in album order, the rest are in alphabetical order.

Thanks for the upload, KingKenn! I don't suppose you have the soundtrack for Varekai..? :D"
