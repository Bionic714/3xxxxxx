,Deji,2007-02-25T12:13Z,"After reluctantly battling dragons, Mayan gods and becoming a Knight of a long lost Holy Order, unwitting hero George Stobbart settles down to the life of a mundane 9-5 desk job. Who would have thought that a mysterious and beautiful woman would enter his life; a woman whose sudden disappearance draws him into a desperate search for a nefarious artifact of great and terrible power known as ?The Angel of Death? ? its primitive blueprints hidden inside the Ark of the Covenant.

Moses was the last to unleash this deadly weapon on the ancient Egyptians during the Exodus with terrifying effect ? it was the most horrific of the Great Plagues. Uncannily, it seemed to be able to kill selectively, leaving the Israelites unharmed. Later, when the Ark was stolen from the Israelites, the killing recommenced and continued until the Ark, along with the secrets of Moses? awesome weapon, was lost?

In this fourth installment of the Broken Sword franchise, you will be enthralled, challenged and drawn into a dark world of conspiracy theories, daring adventure and ancient societies."
