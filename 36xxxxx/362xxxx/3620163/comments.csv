,WcLasT,2007-06-12T19:51Z,"This is Garry's Mod 10  and it comes with CSS GMOD, DM GMOD, DoD GMOD and Megapack GMOD

However.. you can only unpack the original Garry's Mod without password.. the other packages requiers a password, there is no file in the download that says what the password is. 

I once had the password but I forgot it so now I can't unzip the other mods.. very frustrating!  

So if anyone gets the password, please give me a message..

And for those who DON'T GET IT..!!! YOU DON'T NEED STEAM FOR THIS ""GAME""  "

,Sharking,2007-09-25T06:44Z,"I've got this and I extracted the main GMod.7z. When I start up the installer and click install it reads ""Installation DONE!"" without even having done anything. I checked the folder and it hasn't added any new files, and I don't think its working, because when I click cancel it does the same thing.

Do you have any idea whats wrong?"

Summary
Backdoor:W32/Hupigon is a family of backdoor trojans. It allows a remote user access to the computer.

Back to the Top

Detailed Description
The backdoor's file is a PE executable. It is very rare if the variant is smaller than 299kB. The kit used to make this family of malware has default settings to pack the code as UPX. Unpacked the code size is 710kB. Hupigons are written with Borland Delphi.

When the backdoor's file is started, it copies itself as a file named something similar to ""Hacker.com.cn.exe"" in the Windows System folder and then creates the following startup key value in the Registry:

    * HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\system32
      ImagePath = C:\WINDOWS\Hacker.com.cn.exe


And it creates these keys:

    * HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\system32
    * HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\system32\Security


Overall, Hupigon variants have several different types of features. The following list is an example of some:

    * It allows others to access the computer
    * Allows for recording with the user's webcam
    * Can make the user's computer to attack various servers
    * Send victim's computer messages
    * Has rootkit functionality so it has a stealth component that hides files
    * Create logs from keystrokes, steals passwords, and sends this information to remote servers.


Typically, Hupigon clones itself to some installation path such as system32 and uses the following processes to make itself to look like a valid Windows program:

    * calc.exe
    * cmd.exe
    * mmc.exe
    * mspaint.exe
    * mstsc.exe
    * notepad.exe
    * osk.exe
    * sndrec.exe
    * sndvol32.exe
    * svchost.exe
    * winchat.exe


The kit that creates Hupigon variants has default settings to create mutexes. So many Hupigons have created mutexes which are in the following format:

    * xxx.com.cn_MUTEX

The ""xxx"" being a variable. Example: Hacker.com.cn_MUTEX

The following strings can typically be found in a Hupigon variant:

    * 6600.org
    * BEI_ZHU
    * GrayPigeon
    * Hacker.com.cn.exe
    * huaihuaitudou
    * Rejoice2007
    * woainisisi


Hupigon doesn't have any automatic mechanisms to spread itself, so it must be sent by its author via e-mail, through a website, or even via Instant Messengers (IM) such as Yahoo, MSN, ICQ, and Skype.

Hupigon Kit

As noted above, Hupigon variants are created using a kit. This kit software is maintained in a very professional fashion with a highly developed User Interface (UI)."
