Thanks! :)"
,4X-AXG,2007-02-25T23:59Z,"sweet, I will certainly try this one..
I'm still using FrankO 4.3, up until now my favorite one, but it's kinda old with airlines that already went bankrupt a long time ago
hopefully this will become my favorite one soon! Thanks for the effort PA!"
,BlackEight,2007-02-26T00:00Z,Thanks A LOT.
,jonasbeaver,2007-02-26T00:01Z,"adobe replacement when 4.6 is so close?
yay
i will test in fsx"
,neslesman,2007-02-26T00:12Z,"Wow, between this labour of love from pop art, the excellent utilities and the always top of the line WOP and CWDT war birds it's kinda like Xmas all over.  Many thanks to you all.

Does anyone have any thoughts about what they should do with their existing AI packages prior to installing this?  I wonder if I should uninstall my Ultimate Traffic or ?????"
,PopArt,2007-02-26T00:17Z,"Neslesman, if you're still using UT you should uninstall it. The models used in this package are much better, really. Or move the UT.bgl file to a safe place and decide what you want after seeing this package in action. You can always go back that way, which I bet you won't ;-)"
,sable117,2007-02-26T00:38Z,Thx much.  Will definitely be trying ur pkg.
[V],captainahmed,2007-02-26T00:59Z,as always u r the best (Y)
,scooby321999,2007-02-26T01:11Z,"AWESOME!!! Great work Popart!! I (as well as others, i'm sure) have been waiting for a very long time for this incredible release!!"
,BlackEight,2007-02-26T01:13Z,"PopArt, should i simply delete all the aircraft folders Adobe 4.4 created or there is a correct procedure for uninstalling Adobe AI Traffick PAck 4.4 prior to install yuo package?"
,WinnieXL,2007-02-26T01:34Z,Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you 
,Sataris,2007-02-26T01:45Z,"PopArt is my favourite TPBian
"
,PopArt,2007-02-26T01:56Z,"Thanks guys, hope you all like it!

BlackEight: I don't know if Adobe comes with an uninstaller, if not you can delete all aircraft folders starting with Adobe I believe. Just don't forget to backup or delete the bgl file it created in your scenery\world\scenery folder.

Also, read the FAQ for more info."
,GfaRm,2007-02-26T02:45Z,"hi, thanks a lot! i'll seed for quite long (when i'm on-line) coz i have a fast fiber here :) cheers!"
,jonasbeaver,2007-02-26T05:03Z,works in FSX except for distant black airframes +2NM (aircraft far enough away to be non-textured [beyond mipmaps] are black -- same as any other fs9 traffic -- coded into the gmax/fsds airframe) otherwise better than adobe in fsx (which also had the black plane problem) EXCELLENT WORK!
,blindchicken,2007-02-26T09:01Z,"Thanks!

will this package give me any improvements over Ultimate traffic and PAI models?

Thx!"
,scooby321999,2007-02-26T09:17Z,"btw PopArt, does this package include general aviation models and not just commercial jets?"
,PopArt,2007-02-26T10:39Z,"scooby321999, yes it does. Just no generic GA, but you will find plenty of GA models ;-)"
,Sangeki,2007-02-26T10:51Z,"Great work!
Thanks a lot.

Let's see if performance is better in FSX then Adobe (which is great)."
,scooby321999,2007-02-26T11:09Z,Fantastic!! can't wait to try it out!! Just gotta figure out how to get rid of Adobes stuff now....
,Sangeki,2007-02-26T11:27Z,"There should be a UninstallAdobeTP.exe if you've installed it through the installer in FS9... if not just delete their aircraft which all have the Adobe_TP prefix and the traffic file in scenery\world\scenery.

That's most of the Adobe stuff except for 94 MB textures and a few other small files."
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-02-26T11:49Z,"Thanks PopArt. Much appreciate your hard work..! Looking forward to see all these babes fly.

One question. Does your package contain military and/or GA traffic? Or do I need to install the Tantris packages ??"
,Sangeki,2007-02-26T11:57Z,"It does contain GA aircraft but AFAIK only those utilized by airlines, no private GA.

And if you read the text up there: ""including some simple military traffic"""
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-02-26T12:13Z,Thanks! 
,PopArt,2007-02-26T12:59Z,"That's right Sangeki ;-)

Dr Frikadel, if you would want some jetfighters and military cargo I suggest you install the Tantris package. Military traffic is not one of my priorities... yet."
,ceklund,2007-02-26T13:36Z,"I installed this and then my FS2004 donÂ´t start!?
Removed skAI, and itÂ´s running again!
Any thing I have missed ?"
,Sangeki,2007-02-26T13:44Z,"What exactly happened when you tried to start FS9 with skAI installed?

If the start screen came up but nothing seemed to happen then it could simply be that FS9 was still busy registering all the new files.

If nothing happened at all then... that's pretty weird."
,PopArt,2007-02-26T14:25Z,"Ceklund, I think Sangeki is right. Give FS some time to build up the new scenery files and register the new files. It can take some time, but I would say no longer than 2-3 minutes.

Let me know if it works."
,blasterpc2001,2007-02-26T14:27Z,"Thanks alot PopArt , can't wait to try it."
,spesseh,2007-02-26T15:03Z,This is great. Looking forward to check it out. Did you include Tans Peru ?
,PopArt,2007-02-26T15:15Z,"Hey spesseh, didn''t you get my PM? AFAIK Tans Peru has been defunct for a while now, please correct me if I'm wrong ;-) "
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-02-26T15:21Z,"One thing I can highly recoomend is to remove (after backing up) your default traffic file, which ships with the default installation of FS9. 

The default traffic file is called:  traffic030528.bgl
and can be found here: 
*.*:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Scenery\World\scenery

I also like to suggest that PopArt include the option to remove ""traffic030528.bgl"" automatically with the next release of 
skAI Traffic..

Danke,
Dr. Frikadel"
,PopArt,2007-02-26T17:12Z,"Good thinking Dr Frikadel, I will put it on my things-to-do-list ;-)"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-02-26T17:39Z,You're welcome buddy..It's a darn nice package. I just love the russian birds ..
,nostradamus78,2007-02-26T17:55Z,Could someone please leech skAI_Traffic_Base.xls  Thanks.
,nostradamus78,2007-02-26T17:57Z,sorry I mean seed ;-)
,subicbay,2007-02-26T18:35Z,"Sehr gute Arbeit PopArt! Thank You!


The performance with FS9 is great! "

,MCFC OK,2007-02-26T21:01Z,"Great work in putting this together for us Popart! Also thanks and greets to the model builders etc etc.

,luke97,2007-02-26T21:39Z,"Tested on FSX, and works great!! Just a little glitch with skAI_B1900D_HTAI_a folder. FSX says that there are duplicated files. Deleting the folder, did the trick and solved the problem.
Anybody knows how to solve this problem?

Congrats Pops!!! The best AI package out there."
,BaMordi,2007-02-26T22:22Z,Thanks a million :) But SAS Braathens's callsign is not Braathens anymore... It's SCANOR :) But VERY nice work... You even included Kato Air in Norway :D

In the meantime, I would like to get such comments through e-mail (skaitraffic@gmail.com) so I can collect them.

Thanks evryone ;-)"
,Goody06,2007-02-26T23:53Z,"Awesome package PopArt, thank you!!!"
,fsx_2k6,2007-02-27T10:13Z,"Thanks for this excellent AI package!!!! 

Just had one question before I install, does this package include traffic at Bangkok's new airport 'VTBS (Suvarnabhumi)'?"

Works fine with FSX, but please remove duplicate aircraft title from aircraft.cfg of skAI_B1900D_HTAI_a

Thank you!"
,seristee,2007-02-27T16:48Z,requesting pss 757 v1.2 installer
,jonasbeaver,2007-02-27T19:32Z,"To use skAI traffic with ALL military/GA Tantris pack remove the file Traffic_TAi.bgl in fsx\scenery\world\scenery and keep the files installed by tantris mil/GA 2.6 pack, else you will be filled with duplicates.  

The error in FSX of the repeated ANZX file can be fixed by removing [fltsim.20] in the aircraft.cfg file of skAI_B1900D_HTAI_a (the second ANZX config).

Looks great, and better FPS than adobe or FrankO, and WAY WAY better than any payware pack, thanks PopArt!"
,jonasbeaver,2007-02-27T20:26Z,"Actually, my fix will take a lot more work than that to work with the tantris GA/Mil traffic, there are about 100 duplicate aircraft that will have to be removed... the work begins tonight!"
,PopArt,2007-02-27T21:24Z,"@fsx_2k6: I did a quick search and find only one airliner at VTBS, One-Two-Go. 

There should probably more the next update."
,PopArt,2007-02-27T21:27Z,"@jonasbeaver: I will delete the duplicate ANZX and correct it for the next update (how did it slip my attention?). Thanks.

I might consider an option for installing the TAI_Traffic.bgl as part of the installation (including it's textures ofcourse)."
,fsx_2004,2007-02-28T11:16Z,Does anybody know how to force ai from this pack to use jetways in FSX?

,fsx_2k6,2007-02-28T14:10Z,"Thanks popart. 

I was able to use a AI program and move all the traffic from VTBD to VTBS. So far i'm loving this package! I see more planes around the world then Adobe 4.4, can't wait for the update."

,GfaRm,2007-03-02T01:45Z,"thanks again for a nice package! one comment - aero flight does not operate in the real life any more :-)
i would love to see some tool to remove or add flight plans by oneself. something like flight1 ultimate traffic has... i know it is a little bit too much i request but was just wondering :-)
so far i managed to do this with excel file (by filtering and removing planes from planes file and then recompiling traffic.bgl). it works excelent! big thank you again! i'll keep reseeding for a long time coz it's really worth! :)"

,stegrin,2007-03-03T14:55Z,This package have a lott off fault. Exempl: callsing for SASBrathens are Sacnnor or not Braathens. Scandinavian missing Airbus A319 fleet. A lott of flightplans is werry old ++++
,PopArt,2007-03-03T22:49Z,"stegrin: that's right. I resampled this package from other available packages out there (which are very old). That's why I call this a base package, something to get working on / with. The next update will contain flightplans for winter 2007 (over 250 now). It will grow.

About the callsigns: I have checked every callsign with the ones available within Radar Contact. I'd prefer spoken callsigns (even if it's an old one) over registration callouts."
