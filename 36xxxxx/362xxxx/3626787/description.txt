SkAI Traffic v1.0 (base package)
                         ================================


SkAI Traffic is a new traffic package for use with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004. A package that will continue to grow, utilizing the finest freeware models available on the web today. It will provide you with a worldwide AI population of your airports within MSFS. You will find common airliners like KLM, Delta Airlines and Qantas, but also less common airliners like Kosmos, Direktflyg and Redding Aero Enterprises.

In total this package contains over 1000 (!) different airliners still flying today (including some simple military traffic).


Some features:
==============

- All air files and models have been updated with the latest from the web.
- All lightmaps resized to 512x512 for better FPS at night.
- Most lightmaps will have correct alpha channels now.
- Your traffic slider should make a difference!
- Replaced old models (like FSP) with newer and better models, like AIA and EVAI.
- All textures have been resaved in DXT3 format without mips.
- Correct callsigns added to all airliners (optimised for use with Radar Contact).
- All airliners have been checked for defunction, rebranding and/or renaming.
- And much more...


Does this package work with FSX?
================================

This has not been tested, no support will be given.


Extras
======

After installation you will find a new folder in your MSFS root directory.
In this folder (skAI Traffic) you will find some useful tools (see complete FAQ after installation).


Latest release notes (25-02-07):
================================

This package will need appr. 4.50 GB (4283 folders with 9048 files) of free space in your FS root directory. The installer will tell you it will only need 550 Mb, this is not true. Please keep this in mind. I will fix this with the first update.

This package comes with an uninstaller in case you don't like it and for future updates.


Happy landings,
