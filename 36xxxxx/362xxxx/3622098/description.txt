Synopsis:
Happy-go-lucky party animal Chris wakes up one morning with a hangover and a hard-on. Nothing unusual there. Until he discovers a grand in cash and a note from his mum saying she?s gone away. So, like any not-so-average pill-popping 17 year old, Chris embarks on a bender to end all benders. But what do you do after you?ve thrown the mother of all parties and blown all the money? Well, you sell everything that isn?t nailed down and go again - and just hope that everything else will start to make sense. Sometimes though, life can make a little more sense than you want it to and Chris has to face up to the fact his mum might never be coming home.
