,tekky29,2007-03-06T09:15Z,"Thanks Noisemaker, this is a classic event. Not only was the action great, but it's likely the last American show for a couple of years. That snake in the grass Fishman shut down the April show. Hopefully PRIDE can go back to Japan and get a TV deal."
,padre_,2007-03-11T21:31Z,"Heh, tekky just said what I was thinkin too. The fights were great, but like always, they can spoil almost everything in the US, god bless. I was on great fury already when watching the first match. Why bother bringing in any commentators. Without that fool everything would have been much better. Goddamn how I miss Bas & Quadrois! I say this again; producers behind this americanized shit should be put in the ring with Fedor. I rest my case. Anyway, thanks for Noisemaker for bringing this for us. "
