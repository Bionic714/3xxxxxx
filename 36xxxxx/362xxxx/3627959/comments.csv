,gordonfreeman797,2007-03-01T17:04Z,Does this work? Do we need the previous TQ version or is this stand-alone?
,Ryze,2007-03-01T21:28Z,"An expansion is exactly what it sounds like, an.... EXPANSION, so yes you need the original TQ for it to work"
,gordonfreeman797,2007-03-02T11:17Z,"Can't see anywhere where it says 'expansion', plus it's 2.11 Gb hence the reason for the question."
,Szefmester,2007-03-02T16:39Z,"I have the same problem: ""i don't know why it keeps saying that i don't have enough space on D: when i freed almost 5 gigs"" any idea why, or how can i solve it."

,Alftadanne,2007-03-07T12:52Z,"Man kan visst spela spelet fasst än man inte har orginal spelet. Jag gjorde bara så här.
Först tog jag bort min crackade exe fil och ersatte den med orginalet. Sen så instalerade jag tilllägget.
Skit lätt om man kan tänka.

You can play the expansion pack without having the orginal titan quest. Just remove the cracked exe file and replace it with the orginal exe file. 
And after that just install the game.
Its easy if you can think."

,Fatal_Black,2007-05-02T14:09Z,"Is it necessary to have finished the game to enjoy the expansion (I know it's not standalone, I'm meaning that if the quests in Immortal Throne are coming after you've cleared the original game)."
,Bosse_traekuk,2007-05-31T17:45Z,"I think it continues like in Diablo 2 with an extra act or in this case land/underworld, or whatever you would like to call it"

Hey, alguien que me diga si trae el idioma español en alguna parte..."
,akinto2006,2008-05-04T22:42Z,"Sheez... a lot of whiners in here...

Q: I have more than enough space for the extraction of the archive but it says that I have no more space.

A: Use NTFS filesystem on your drive. FAT32 can't support files larger than 2GB.

Q: Is this an expansion?

A: Yes it is. If you google it, you will find lots of sites saying exactly that.

Q: I can't seem to connect online. How come?

A: Your using a pirated version that's why.

Q: I'm trying to play it on LAN but I can't get to connect it with other computers.

A: Two reasons. (1) IPX/SX is not installed on your system and (2) You all are using the same CD-keys.

Q: I can't seem to get the game working.

A: Check your system if it meets the minimum system requirements.

Q: I can't seem to stop whining about trivial stuff that even a 3 year old can answer.

A: Have your IQ tested. You might be spending a lot of time under the sun or jacking-off. lol"
