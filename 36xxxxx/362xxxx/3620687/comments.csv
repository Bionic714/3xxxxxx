,STGstylah,2007-07-07T13:09Z,"Thanks for this amusing material! Few thoughts come to mind: either he's using some very powerful hallucinating drug, or he's a cum laude graduate of the J. Goebbels University for Propaganda. Or he himself is part of this 'conspiracy' he's talking about........ Did you notice the word 'piracy' in 'conspiracy'?"

,donderdraak,2007-11-04T11:15Z,This is a must see for every human being. Michael Tsarion did an excellent job by giving out the information in this great series.
,AeronPrometheus,2008-01-04T18:04Z,"STGstylah, Don't close your mind. The worst thing anyone can do is refuse additional information for the brain to sort through (Right or wrong).

Only through accepting all knowledge can you find the truth hidden within the lies."
,caper454,2008-01-16T04:33Z,My thanks to the uploader! Michael Tsarion is without a doubt one of the greatest minds of this age.
,Amerifox,2008-03-05T20:34Z,"I agree Aeron guy, I posted this in one of the other Origins and Oracles thingies, but it is just as foolish to blindly accept something as it is to blindly deny it, since as humans we have such limited perceptions. A good example is we only see a fraction of the Electromagnetic Spectrum that we understand. ""Our observations are only good as the tools we use to observe them with"" Idr who said that but still, wise words, Thanks to Michael Tsarion for thinking out of the box and sharing it with others!!!"

,Caribroo,2009-01-05T06:41Z,"Tsarion is a member of several occultic groups most predominently the Rosicrucian Order.

I do not trust Tsarion, what you do however is up to you."
,Drumerguy12,2009-04-26T15:53Z,"This guy is possibly the worst orator I have ever heard speak. He is incredibly dry and doesn't even read his own PowerPoint slides in full sentences, pausing at the most awkward times. That being said, The information presented is really quite interesting, and if you can get past his horrendous speech and cheesy camera effects you will be quite intrigued."
