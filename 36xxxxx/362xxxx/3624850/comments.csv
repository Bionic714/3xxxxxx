,jerbe,2007-02-23T14:07Z,"Very very slow seed. Oh well, I guess uploader have some kind of problem that will be solved eventually."
,iSeal,2007-02-23T21:52Z,"I'm the uploader. Yeah, tis slow :\ I'm FTPing the file to some friends that'll seed it for me, should help boost the speed."
,naturespocket,2007-02-24T11:20Z,NTSC or PAL? TIA.
,iSeal,2007-02-24T19:33Z,NTSC.
,eman37,2007-02-25T03:25Z,Seal i'm sure you know who I am.   Out of curiosity and respect I will seed this for as long as time alows it.   I wish you the best.  Electroman
,iSeal,2007-02-27T03:56Z,Thanks to all the seeders. I can't afford the bandwidth to disseminate this any other way!
,iSeal,2007-02-27T03:59Z,"And not to spam, but feel free to leave your thoughts at IMDB as well:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0818688/

It doesn't have to be positive. Feel free to give it a score of 3.0/10 if you feel that way."
,SilverBallz,2007-03-01T11:46Z,I'll donate some bandwidth for a while!
,Alkivar,2007-03-06T02:40Z,audio on this is fucking horrible... it clips like every 5-6 seconds... staticy... its basically unlistenable.

,iSeal,2007-03-06T07:54Z,"Alkivar, try another player or something? I know of at least 10 succesful plays on different computers w/o issues. The stutter may happen if you have 2 things trying to access the same file, could be that?"
,Alkivar,2007-03-12T06:34Z,"its not a stutter... its recorded so rediculously loud that it is redlining and distorting.

,foums666,2007-03-12T18:09Z,"Looks interesting, I hope someone can dump this on Usenet...for the sake of piracy! :P"
,iSeal,2007-03-13T23:42Z,"Oh now I know what you're talking about.

Alkivar, that's because I accidentally put the battery upside down in the mic when I went to Toronto a 2nd time. I was lucky to get anything in terms of audio at all, and what you hear there is after tons of post-processing to try to clear the sound up. Oh good times."
,Trailerpromo,2007-03-18T11:16Z,"Interesting subject, but quite a lame documentary. It pivots mainly around music, leaving software and movies completely in the dark. Main themes evolve around the judicial debate, but why not tackle this from a more philosophical (moral for instance) or cultural point of view ? Also from a technological point of view it declines to bring any interesting revelations. And what up with the disgusting musac layered all the time into the interviews ? It completely turns your attention away from the subject and gives you the impression of watching some cheap promotional video you might encounter on a late night tell-sell channel."
,iSeal,2007-03-19T22:05Z,"Points noted, thanks for the feedback.

As it purports to the subject covered, we were debating whether to make movie piracy a bigger part of the issue. But as we discussed with those involved, we found that the issues very much mirrored each other. We would of just had people repeating the same things over and over.

As for not covering software piracy, we debated on it. It wasn't until after the interview with Microsoft that we decided to jettisson that angle once and for all. There just wasn't enough material there to substantiate it.

Nevertheless, it would be foolish to expect any one documentary to cover absolutely everything about a subject. We made a film about a few aspects of issues with music as we saw it, and it should not be expected that we'd cover every nook and cranny. A documentary like that would be twenty hours long, if not more! 

That said, we appreciate the feedback. :)"
