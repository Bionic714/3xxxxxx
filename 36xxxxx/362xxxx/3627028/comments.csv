,daniel.gleckler,2007-02-27T05:22Z,"How do I view them? I'm new to this. I'm running OS X. Do I have to make a disk image out of these files?

I've got Quicktime, NicePlayer, VLC, and DivX."
,guategeek,2007-02-27T06:27Z,"To use this on a Mac you need to first get ""UnRarX"" which is a mac unrar program that supports .rar files that have been split up into pices. You will then have a video file you can play in Quicktime or VLC."
,Ender_Swe,2007-03-01T22:31Z,"Use MacRar instead itÂ´s the same as winRar, but to Mac.."
,Pyro_duck,2007-03-04T16:05Z,Why would you wanna .rar a 700 mb file... That's just stupid!
