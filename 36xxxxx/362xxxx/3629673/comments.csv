[T],stupidul,2007-03-02T13:38Z,"thanks... :D

[T],stupidul,2007-03-02T21:06Z,"i'm seeding, i'm seeding...

it's just that it's gonna take a while until i'll finish seeding it of the first time."
,maka23,2007-03-03T14:44Z,"am tras cam 20%, bineinteles ca nu mai merge!in schimb am ratio peste 1,2!lol!PLZZZ seed!!!"
[T],stupidul,2007-03-06T20:18Z,"still seeding... 43,3% is already up and available to the world.

ps: patience is a virtue ;)"
[T],stupidul,2007-03-10T17:19Z,"sorry about stopping but my server mb died.

,Einhander83,2007-03-11T00:48Z,"stupidul, please get back to seeding a soon as you can. everyone's stuck at 45.1%"
,maka23,2007-03-12T18:23Z,"that's right....i almost gave up hope!!!but,as a great man once said: ""patience is a virtue!"" :P"
,Einhander83,2007-03-12T19:32Z,"I'm sure stupidul will be back and seeding soon. Until then all I can say is 'Hehehe, ain't that cute, but it's wrooooong!' :)"
,theevildonkey,2007-03-13T10:41Z,Hell Yeah! I've been searching all over for this for a while now. I used to watch this all the time when I was a kid. I'll seed this forever!!!
[T],stupidul,2007-03-13T21:58Z,"i'm back seeding - from another pc.
my server is a bit deader than i thought... :("
,theevildonkey,2007-03-21T03:26Z,"Stuck at 64.8%
=("
,orbanbalage,2007-03-22T10:50Z,"65.5 %
hey man, really now; i'm really glad that you have all of this, but if you could just seed for an hour, i have a very high speed connection (university), and it's no problem for me to seed; and you really wouldnt have to be online for a long time. pleeease :D"
[T],stupidul,2007-03-22T18:15Z,"well... if only i'd have more than 256kbps upload speed :(
my server was seeding a lot faster than i am now from this computer, but since it's been dead for 3 weeks now... keep praying, maybe i'll manage to fix it :D"
,theevildonkey,2007-03-26T01:56Z,"You should leech off the neighbors like I do. My neighbors have an 8Mbit comcast connection =)
A device like this might help http://www.engadget.com/2005/11/15/how-to-build-a-wifi-biquad-dish-antenna/"
[T],stupidul,2007-03-29T23:28Z,"yeah... well, there are no wifis in my neighbourhood (already checked).
anyway, my server is back among the living, so seeding should be complete in about 2-3 days ;)"
,maka23,2007-04-01T10:13Z,"after 3 weeks of asking ""R we home yet?"", these 2 dogs can finally enjoy the ""ball!food!ball!food!""...thx very much, stupidul!i will seed this 4ever!"

,elias_lh,2007-09-06T18:42Z,What program du you need to play the videos???? Neither WindowaMediaPlayer or VLC works!
[T],stupidul,2007-09-16T20:30Z,The files are encoded with xvid/mp3. You should be able to play them with the apropriate codecs installed.
,fradigy,2007-11-15T23:21Z,mersi omule
