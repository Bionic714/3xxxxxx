Americans have been robbed of their intelligence and their way to think critically - now they are just obese, war-mongering, ignorant fools who will be nothing and will be remembered as a people who are stupid and led by stupid people."
,fs12,2007-04-21T12:02Z,"Ok guys. I'd like to watch this file to see what this lunatic had to say to his people to convince them to take part of maybe the biggest war crimes of all time. Hitler was indeed a great rhetorical politician but he didn't have a single clue about war strategy and the most effective way to use his ""top of the line"" war material; With the exception of his officers who indeed knew this. Thanks to that he lost the war and the world could live on in peace. He was a murderer, madman and should not be seen upon by anyone today when the world has seen the results of his acts! If you are a nazi today, you should still hate Hitler because his bad judgement and lack of respect for his officers made him and Germany loosing the war. So stop saying that he was a good man!"

Der Rassismus den Ihr lebt, begründet sich wie folgt:
Zurückführen lässt sich das auf einen Minderwertigkeitskomplex.
Ihr sucht nach etwas, das Ihr für noch minderwertiger haltet als euch selbst!
Ihr seid unzufrieden mit euch selbst.(verständlicherweise)
Deshalb projeziert Ihr euren Selbsthass auf alles was euch fremd ist.
Lernt, euch selbst zu lieben und mit euren Fehlern und Unzulänglichkeiten zu leben!
Dann lösen sich eure Psychosen in Luft auf ... und der Rassismus verschwindet wie von selbst.
Ich hoffe, ich konnte euch helfen.

Shalom meine Freunde."
