,three39three,2007-10-05T18:06Z,"i'm new to torrents, but do not wnt to be a leech how do i seed, sorry if it's a dumb question"
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-11-21T10:07Z,"seeding is simply leaving the torrent file active on your client (bittorrent, azureus, shareaza etc) after you have finished downloading. there should be a info button you can click for the file that will tell you how much you've uploaded v how much youve downloaded. it is common courtesy to upload as much as you download. (if you download a 700 MB file, you should seed until you have uploaded at least 700 MB) that's it. you dont have to DO anything to seed, just finish the download and leave your client open and dont delete/remove the file for a bit. leeching is simply the downloading part.

,Tulkoju,2010-07-05T12:01Z,"In response to the hypocrite, browsing through pirate bay and telling others they should buy albums, I have purchased almost all of Claypools work, starting with my first tape of Seas of Cheese, which I also own on CD and used to have on LP. I also have Suck on This on LP and used to have Blind Illusion on LP.
The main reason I opened this torrent was to downlowd Blind Illusion since I lost almost all my LPs a few years back.
The only music of his I haven't purchased was Sausage (I once owned a copy on tape), Oysterhead because I never really liked the guy from Phish's vocals and Of Fungi and Foe cuz they released it so late here in Austria, where I now live and when the CD came out I had no money to buy it. If I made excesses of cash I would buy all his work on LP.
Thanks to ST:ALPHONZO for offering us your collection.
Do you have Blind Illusion?
What about the Sausage Demo?
Monsters and Robots?"
,Tulkoju,2010-07-05T12:31Z,"on the other hand, saying ""Buying an album lines the pockets of record executives more than the artist."" isn't completely accurate in this case. The majority of Les Claypool's solo work has been released by Prawnsong as an independent recor label. He has produced many of his own albums and I can imagine he makes a lot of money for his work."
