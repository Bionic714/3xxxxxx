....I have strong suspicions that this ""DVD9"" is the fake one that's been floating around forever (which is an old 700mb rip, horrible quality, that somebody bloated up)."
,bonnie335,2008-05-15T01:37Z,This is just a bad dvd-release which have not been restored properly. A 700mb rip of a restored dvd will look much better than this 8 GiB release.

,famemon78,2009-07-27T14:19Z,Can someone else comment on the quality of this DVD 9 release pls. ? I don't wanna download it if the quality is crap. But if its the real deal id prefer it over a rip any day coz it ll have proper menus subtitles etc.
