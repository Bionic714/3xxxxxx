Comment:
Director Anthony Mann envisioned the story (which had previously inspired operas and plays) as a motion tapestry -- an ambition recognized in this version, which, like "Lawrence of Arabia" a few years back, revitalizes "El Cid's" striking visuals and the sweeping score by Miklos Rozsa.

"El Cid" is a film in which things happen either very quickly or very slowly, but always grandly -- the costumes are lavishly colorful, the sets spectacular, the crowds huge, the passions extreme. Within the first 10 minutes, Rodrigo has defeated and captured those Moors, pardoned them on a promise never to invade again (thus being dubbed El Cid, Moorish for "one who is both compassionate and a great warrior"), and continued on his journey to wed the luscious Chimene (Sophia Loren).
