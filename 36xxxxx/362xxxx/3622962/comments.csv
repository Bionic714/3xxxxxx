             As its prequels, UFO: Afterlight is a mixture of squad
             based tactical action and global strategy with the gamer
             controlling the actions of elite ground troops, and the
             running and expansion of the home base while collecting
             resources.

             Although the basic game specifications will remain
             similar to those of UFO: Aftershock, there are many new
             additions and improvements in both strategic and tactical
             elements of the game. As Mar"

Working Crack? I'd be happy if you gave me a source. 

Becuase YASU aint working on Vista.


When u said this it got me thinking, Works when i run YASU in windows xp compatibility mode."
,Gelvin,2007-02-21T01:53Z,yasu doesnt do any more good in xp either =/
,Dancingwind,2007-02-21T03:56Z,"it works great in win Xp .. you just have to install, run YASU, disable all emulations on daemon, Start copying Data3.cab from the image and quickly run ufo.exe (it not allways runs at first time - ofen I get a timeout error but usually when i press retry it works, if you have trouble you may try copying more files or using nero drivespeed aka limit virtualdrives speed)"
,Dancingwind,2007-02-21T04:02Z,"Unfortunately .. as always with UFO series .. the game has lots of bugs, but :D I like this one the most, not counting the usual memory leaks it runs looks AND FEELS better than Aftershock ... so get newest drivers for everything I mean EVERYTING (GPU/Motherboard/Soundcard/Mouse :D/anything that needs drivers) and start playing :D and buying :D this one is really worth it"
,Gelvin,2007-02-21T04:05Z,"yeah ""just"" hehe i know that and that is just a temporary solution"
,BigFuzzy,2007-02-21T11:23Z,"Dancingwind - 
I think the question was: Does this work without having to do the ""copy large file then click on the .exe"" technique because it's been proven that that doesn't work for ALL users. 
I'm curious if there is an actual crack for this, not the above mentioned technique?
Thanks! :)"
,Shonsu,2007-02-21T15:14Z,"It says CRACKED

hasn't been nuked 

so it must be the shit"
,Dancingwind,2007-02-21T16:58Z,"Well this temprary solution might work on a pached version of AL and thats a big +
And about Vista ... on Vista a lot of things dont work .. yet. If you want games - play on XP for now."

,-Kigre-,2007-02-22T14:24Z,"Hi all! Bought the game cause i didnt wanna wait for the crack! And im telling u! The game is awesome but can snap anytime. Meaning once it does u wont get it working just like that! Gotta do this and that... why? 
Dont know really, but reading on their home homepage and CENEGA forums its told everywhere that ppl have problems with the original! WTF! These guys cant basic programming! Im not any good with fixing stuff like that, but i shouldnt be either. Just put in the cd, install and play... but no... if they dont fix this crap soon i wont be buying anything from CENEGA or Altar... and if u want the game. I suggest u get the cracked one... u might be able to play the game that way. :) 
Great game though!"

Should be able to start it tonight provided the crack works! Thanks! :)"

here is another crack that works.

PS: i have a problem with the game, for some reason my right half of the screen is missing!!!  i never had this problem with any other game before, any one knows what i can do about it?"
,pzrshrek,2007-02-25T03:46Z,"Answering my own comment:

New ATI drivers doesnt function with this game, but old works nice, i really recommend this little gem. Get it, and buy it!"

,hugoeng,2007-03-11T05:09Z,"It works fine, but on my computer it has some memory leak that makes loading of tactical maps slower and slower the longer you play until it finally crashes.

Good game, but not great."

,Kojak000,2007-09-27T04:33Z,Works fine ona P4 2.4 GHz with 1.5 GB RAM and a Nvidia Gforce card 7600GS. Just for your information.

,crashlord666,2008-02-24T09:52Z,"How to make the game work in vista=

Look on a torrent search engine for ""UFO Afterlight"" and find the patch called UFO Afterlight International 1.5.  Download it, then extract the those files into the directory where you installed UFO afterlight.  Run the patch.exe and wait for it to finish.

Then, look in the HATRED directory that was created by the patch that you just unzipped.  Take the ufo.exe file from there, and use it to replace the old ufo.exe.  Do NOT use the ufo.exe from the hatred dir on the CD, it doesnt work for Vista (at least for me)    Good luck!"
,tigpoppa,2008-07-20T08:54Z,"wish  knew how much ass vista sucked before getting  new comp.

friggin dell MADE me get vista.  

BASTARDS!!!!!
then again hope this game works now

Vista = Virus"
,Dead-Inside,2008-10-25T03:40Z,"lol @ You people. And since SP1 you can't ever, ever say Vista is ""beta software""."
,kissemisse,2009-02-04T10:43Z,"Vista is ""beta software"". Whops! :("
,-FARGO-,2010-07-29T19:07Z,Any chance of seeding this again plz guna try and download it tonight cheers
,fejesistvan,2011-03-30T17:52Z,"Damnit. This game do not works properly on newer graphic cards/drivers... the ingame windows are on each others, i cant see anything... i try to patch the game, and anything, but its still a mess... any ideas?"
,Pirata01,2011-06-09T20:22Z,"The installation works and the game also, BUT...
The game runs in a weird screen. It seems it uses a double width resolution, because part of the screen is outside my old monitor limits. When I click on ""options"" and go modify the settings, the ""accept"" button or whatever it be, is out of sight and there is no way to go back to main screen or to modify anything because you cant click that button.

So I have to ctrl+alt+del and I simply cant play the game. :,(

I took a look at the game files, but my knowledge is not enough to modify anything... do you know what to do? any ideas?"
,megabyte.povt,2011-06-24T19:21Z,after applying 1.7 patch it works perfectly
