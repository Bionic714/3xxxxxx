,Cheewie,2008-01-16T16:29Z,"Take its easy with NTSC-games on PAL-machines. You might brick(damage) your console. Newer games often include an update, which it will install if you havnt updated the Wii console by yourself. And if updates NTSC-software on your PAL-machine then it will break.

Use WiiBrickblocker 1.3 to remove that update from the burnt disc.. Happy gaming!"
,Cheewie,2008-01-16T16:34Z,"Correction!

Use WiiBrickblocker 1.3 on the iso-file, BEFORE burning the disc. (duh ;)"
,bisterdk,2008-05-29T23:47Z,How do I use the Wiibrickblocker on the iso-file?

,CraZyXHeaDX,2010-03-01T16:48Z,"DOESN'T work on softmodded 4.2U with neogamma r7. Plays through menus and hangs on loading screen. Burnt with ImgBurn on 2X. Where other games have worked, this one fails."
,aamirtariq,2011-06-28T08:10Z,"I got my wii 3.4u softmoded and downgraded to 3.3u. Using USBLoader GX to run Tiger Woods PGA tour 12th The Masters and it runs perfectly.

Call of duty 3 loads with it, makes a new profile, but it doesnt load the campaign. Waited for more than 10 minutes but the stars dont load at all.

I am uploading it whenever I am online, but I am thinking why to load when I am not able to play it. Do you guys want it? Is there anyone who is running this game successfully?"
,aamirtariq,2011-06-28T08:17Z,"If you want to use USBLoader GX, then you must install WBFS Manager and use it transfer games to your USB Drive. Find, download and then run the games. I am thinking of buying a big External HDD to run and keep wii games"
