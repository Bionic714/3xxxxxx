,IggyPop,2007-02-28T18:40Z,"You dont need to do anything with this film because the subs are already in the film (hard coded), you can just burn it. In other cases when there is a separate subtitle file, place the sub file(.idx+.sub or .srt) in the same folder as the avi and burn it.. just make sure the filenames of both the avi and sub file are the same.

But all this works only if you've seeded the film 1:1 ;-)"
