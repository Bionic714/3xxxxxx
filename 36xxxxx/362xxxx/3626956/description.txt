Live At Pearl\'s 
September 14, 1994 
  
I don\'t know if its audience or SBD recording but the sound is great 
I made the artwork for a friend and in return he sent me this wonderful show in 2 audio CDs.
I extracted the tracks with EAC and compressed to FLAC (Level 8 & Aling on sector boundaries checked).

Enjoy & share!

* Please be aware that these flacs are actually MP3 sourced. They came to me this way, and it was later discovered to be lossy. I am hesitant to convert to MP3 and downgrade quality any further, but you may convert them yourself if you choose to.*

A lossless version is not known to circulate, but if you have one, pls. share :-)


Sound is still excellent for an MP3 sourced bootleg If you love Eva, you'll love this
