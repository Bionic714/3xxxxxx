,SoundWall,2007-03-02T12:02Z,"Being a deathmule release we can expect crap.

Why would you make dvd versions of the tv rips, increasing the filesizes something enormous?

And what are those recaps? They seem like tniy parts cut out directly from the script rather than summarizations.

This 'deathmule' guy clearly doesn't have a clue what he's doing."

""Being a deathmule release we can expect crap."" 

LOL you can tell this dipshit never downloaded any of my DVDs. 

""Why would you make dvd versions of the tv rips, increasing the filesizes something enormous? ""

i can tell you never made a DVD before. do you own any DVD box set like LOST season1? there is 4 episodes on one discs and the box set has 6 discs. now the reason why they can only fix 4 episodes on one disc, is becasuse the episodes have to be in MPG format. each episode on a retail LOST DVD is 1.5GB MPG (are you still following me dipshit?) now i coverted the tv rips into that same format that retail DVDs use. this release is a 4 disc 5 episodes on one disc, and 2 episodes on the last disc. thats only 760MB each episode. now if your dumbass knew anything about DVDs, you would knew that retail DVDs are alot bigger in size. these DVDs are for stand alone DVD players and can be watched on your PC. the small 350MB Avi releases your talking about can only be watched on your PC, and cant be watched on your DVD players. now do you have any more questions SoundWall you dumb shit?

you should think before you Write a comment.  you clearly dont have a fucking clue what your talking about. now i could go on and on about, how your a fucking dumb shit, but people will read your comments and see what a fucking idiot you are, so i think thats punishment enough ;)"

I'm sorry, but most modern DVD players can actually play DivX and AVI.. Even if a crap player beneath 500SEK (Around 50$). That way u can have really much more in a DVD, and there's no problem dl'in subs and put it right in there for common people like me :)"
,Peaton,2007-03-06T08:27Z,"Since like 35% ive downloaded at like 10kb/s... It jumps up from time to time but its really slow mostly...

Or TV via TV-out.. I'm sure this is a quality release, but you sure spent a lot of words explaining ""I upsampled this video to let you guys play it on DVD players"". :-p"

LOL!!  These episode descriptions are all for EPISODE 17!  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED ON EPISODE 17 DO NOT READ ANY OF THEM!

What a retard...."
,tracer2009,2007-07-10T22:36Z,"without being too cheeky i'm pretty disappointed having downloaded these , only to find there is no menu, no quick skip between episodes and a really dodgy widescreen ratio, black bars are huge. gonna look real bad on a 4:3 tv.

....and yeah the whole recaps thing is hilarious."
,patrickzero,2007-12-13T17:19Z,"All you guys who've downloaded, please seed - I'll make my own mind up about quality, but I've been downloading this all week and only at 13%.
