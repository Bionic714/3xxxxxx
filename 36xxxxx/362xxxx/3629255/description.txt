I have encoded this CD with the ogg format because of the much better sound reproduction.


If you need a codec for the ogg format you can get it here. This is for Windows Media Player.

For Winamp

For ripping and making ogg files as well as variable bit rate mp3 files, I use CDex

There are other players that will handle the ogg format, check Google.
