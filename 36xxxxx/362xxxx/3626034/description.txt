The new PowerPoint is radically different from previous versions. Over the past decade,
PowerPoint has grown in complexity, but its once-simple toolbar has been packed with 
so many features that not even the pros could find them all. For PowerPoint 2007, 
Microsoft redesigned the user interface completely, adding a tabbed toolbar that makes
every feature easy to locate.
  
Unfortunately, Microsoft's documentation is as scant as ever, so even if you find the 
features you need, you still may not know what to do with them. But with this book, 
you can breeze through the new user interface and its timesaving features in no time. 
PowerPoint 2007 for Starters: The Missing Manual is the perfect primer for anyone who
needs to create effective presentations.
