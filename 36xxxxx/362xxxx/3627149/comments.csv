,tjalker,2007-12-19T11:01Z,SEEDERS PLEASE!!!!!
,Destaone,2008-04-03T20:16Z,"Yes. There´s one BUP-file missing (although its there!). You can watch it in comp though. 

The dvd, however, is cheap to buy (för er svenskar så kostar den inte mer än 119 spänn på cdon.com). "
,dzing,2009-01-25T02:35Z,"Please share this dvd as a divx-file someone, thanks !

It's a major pain in the arse waiting for days for the download to finish."
,zsvz,2009-09-30T23:46Z,"One file missing! Vob file too large 4,24 giga. How to save the download? I can't burn  it and I can't open with dvd shrink............Why do you share problematic torrents............??????????????"
,zsvz,2009-10-01T10:12Z,"ok, found solution. you gotta experiment with IfoEdit program. Take the largest vob strip it through IfoEDIT and it will create all other supporting files for dvd video format. For safety 
reasons I converted the outcome with DvdShrink
into ISO file and I got dvd burned successfully.
It is a beautiful concert ! "
,aabbcc380,2009-12-11T11:53Z,"DVD Shrink didn't  work because of missing VIDEO_TS.VOB file.

Made a copy VIDEO_TS_MENU_1.VOB named VIDEO_TS.VOB.

AFter that DVD Shrink could read the files and could burn a DVD+RW.
