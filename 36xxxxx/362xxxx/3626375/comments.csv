,williamevans09,2011-01-30T10:25Z,"It's huge because it is not an .avi, like you probably wanted. It is a straight dvd rip made to be burned right to another dvd. It wasn't what I wanted either. Thanks for trying to upload something we all might want though."
,jctcom,2011-09-04T07:48Z,"Thank you for uploading a quality video / audio file instead of one of those low quality .AVI file with crappy stereo audio.  It's great to see uploaders that provide quality files.
Carl."
