Over 75% of network attacks are targeted at the web application layer. This book 
provides explicit hacks, tutorials, penetration tests, and step-by-step demonstrations
for security professionals and Web application developers to defend their most 
vulnerable applications.  This book defines Web application security, why it should be
addressed earlier in the lifecycle in development and quality assurance, and how it 
differs from other types of Internet security. Additionally, the book examines the 
procedures and technologies that are essential to developing, penetration testing 
and releasing a secure Web application. Through a review of recent Web application 
breaches, the book will expose the prolific methods hackers use to execute Web 
attacks using common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting and 
Buffer Overflows in the application layer. By taking an in-depth look at the techniques
hackers use to exploit Web applications, readers will be better equipped to protect 
confidential.
