A few non-free codecs has been included, and the crack is for DMC PowerPack, which enables you to quickly view and edit ID-tags on MP3-files and all other supported files which includes ID-tag.
And much more, I don't even use everything myself :)"

[V],room101bellboy,2008-07-07T00:14Z,"Thank you very much, Ubehage.  
It's amazing that some people can think that a Mod would upload virus-infected files. Conspiracy theories are fashionable nowadays.

Perfect torrent, scanned with AVG Internet Security 8.0. Completely virus-free. 

Installation takes a while and sometimes you might think your system has crashed. Just be patient, it's the crack doing its job. 

Works like a charm.  

Good job!
Cheers
