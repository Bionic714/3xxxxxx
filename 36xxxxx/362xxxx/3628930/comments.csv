,Almighty Dread,2010-01-11T22:03Z,"In this world, there are many intellectually retarded people who want only Hollywood films to be highly acclaimed. Fortunately, there are more than a few of us who like to keep our brains in gear while watching a film, so ""Children of Men"" is assured of an audience. Thanks for this DVD."
