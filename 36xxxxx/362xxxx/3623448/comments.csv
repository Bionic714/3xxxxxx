,enick,2007-02-21T16:11Z,"Stop fucking complaining about rar files in torrents, download one without."
,zidern,2007-02-21T17:44Z,"There isn't always other torrents that aren't RAR, and there's NO point whatsoever in putting RAR files in a torrent."
,sputza,2007-02-21T21:32Z,"RAR files can cut down on the size of the downloaded file. Sometimes they help very little and other times help very much. It depends on the contents of the RAR. Overall, using a RAR lowers the bandwidth consumption overall. So shutup you uneducated moron. "
,sajon,2007-02-21T22:51Z,"Bullshit. For 5 years ago it helpt alot to compress and split a rar. But that was the time then we downloaded stuff directly from the web, from p2p file sharing network like DC, or from a ftp-server were it started. NOW there is really no point to do it, becoz the movie itself it highly compressed and how does now the bittorrent system works.. oh yeah, it splits stuff! It's just a  bad habit nowdays, and like zidern, please stop. It's just annoying.."

3.  Thanks in advance for the HD version?"
,annoyingzhang,2007-02-26T05:22Z,"just stop complaining, y'all guys are like children whining. Don't download it then WATCH it if you don't like RARed files.   "
,steppis55,2007-03-01T21:12Z,"I like RAR's , if something breaks in the middle , which do happend, you just have to replace that one RAR."
,rc71,2007-03-04T06:55Z,"Hmmm.  How ironic, but my copy seems to have a corrupted video feed.  Anyone else?   Rar's checked out fine btw."
,sputza,2007-03-05T06:30Z,"@tazzbuddy2, you're a douche. How fucking slow are peoples computers that they need to worry about taking a few seconds to unrar something?"
