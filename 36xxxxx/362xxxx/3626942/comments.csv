,afrosia,2008-03-16T19:11Z,"It clearly says ""WMA"".

Who uses iTunes anyway!?"
,turboturkey,2008-04-08T21:04Z,well you need itunes for an ipod
,dirty_cousin,2008-04-18T20:46Z,Ya'll are morons.  Itunes kicks ass it plays the universal format MP3 and is the easiest app I've ever dealt with for tagging and organizing music.  Who the hell uses wma anyway?  Anyway its pretty easy to encode these into mp3 anyway (playable by itunes and many other apps) which just makes more sense to have them in.  Thanks for upload. 
,alli1166,2008-04-24T14:45Z,"Omg... choosing a media player is just like food. Some one likes iTunes someone likes WMP.

For thoose wanting to add the music to their iPod/iPhone, just use a new version of WinAmp. Newer versions of iTunes will convert the .wma files to mp3 for ya! (="
,Rusticlys,2008-04-25T20:51Z,of course this shit works in iTunes...=)
