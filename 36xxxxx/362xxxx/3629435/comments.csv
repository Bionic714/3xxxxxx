,URAplate,2007-03-01T20:02Z,Stuck at 50%.  Please Seed!
,chiefsurf,2007-03-02T08:02Z,"seed please.....
stuck at 93.7%"
,fidofido,2007-03-02T09:59Z,"Has anyone succeeded in getting the entire film yet?

ANy word on quality?  Is it a screener?"
,funkyfraggle,2007-03-02T10:37Z,"I have been trying to download this since yesterday and have only managed to get to 52.6% which is where it has sat since 10pm last night.

Like some other people - upload has been on full but download is 2kb max at the mo and that is only for a couple of seconds. I dunno where the 295 seeds is coming from as I am only showing 96 but none are seeding....not quite sure how I am supposed to seed/share at 5.0 if i cant even get it!

PLEASE can someone seed or sort this out!"
,fidofido,2007-03-02T13:50Z,"Is a cam, not a screener,  quality ok for a cam.  sound a bit tinny as cams often are.  Some people munching popcorn in the beginning. Kind of pixelated.

Watchable, but sould easily wait for a better one.

however, thanks for the early upload."

,KopyWrite,2007-03-09T21:36Z,"This is CAM not Screener, please lable your shite right.. so people dont waste their time downloading something thinking it is something it is not... ass hole..."
,drakakis,2007-03-11T17:40Z,"Everybody, calm down! I'm downloading at a very respectable speed with 36 seeds and a whack of peers, and I'm at 70% complete.  

Yes, I'll seed when done.

Whatever problems the posters below were experiencing, they seem to have been corrected. "

,CoLLecToR 91,2007-04-03T22:00Z,this is clearly a CAM version. the quality is terrible. DONT DOWNLOAD. I went to the cinema and saw it there instead!
,georrge,2007-04-06T02:50Z,"I HATE when morons film the screen and expect me to watch it! Really, it's not that urgent. And I HATE when people LIE!!!
Don't call it a screener if it isn't! What do you get from that? LIAR!!"

,noughtymonkey,2007-06-26T05:07Z,"WTH is wrong with you people bitching about that it's a CAM rec?? the fact that the title says TS (tele-sync) pretty much gave that away.. So before calling any one Ass-holes, try to learn how to think before talking.. ay?! "
