,lino,2007-02-21T21:26Z,"Oops, sorry. Don't suppose there is anyway to fix this, is there?"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-04-04T20:52Z,"No, there isn't... but who cares...? Very, very hard to get your hands on a Powell & Pressburger film, so thanks...guess the seeds will stay long enough so I can complete...
Many, many thanks..."

,dianelady,2011-12-08T07:08Z,Thank you for having this film. I have had a memory of a scene from this film since I was very young. I am thrilled. I will seed as long as I can. Many thanks again & a Merry Christmas to you.
