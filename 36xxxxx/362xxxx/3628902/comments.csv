""Immortal throne needs to update the original Titan Quest files in order to continue!""
And when i press ok... the game exits to windows WTF should i do about this!??
Thanks for all anwsers!"
,ilikemuffins000,2007-07-05T23:50Z,"Um...I would try re-installing both Titan Quest and Immortal throne. Once TQ is installed copy this patch into the directory then install Immortal Throne. See if that works.
Have fun!"
