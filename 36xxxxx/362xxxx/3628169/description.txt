                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following Diana's sudden death in Paris, August 31, 1997 many doubts have 
surrounded the official story that she was killed in a tragic accident. No 
event since the assassination of President Kennedy has attracted more 
conspiracy theories than the death of Princess Diana.

At the last count, there were 36,000 websites devoted to conspiracy theories 
about her death, and according to one poll, 78% of the British public believes 
her death was no accident. This view is apparently general throughout the 
Islamic world too.

In this one-hour film, we examine the main conspiracy theories and look at the 
evidence. Did she fake her own death to escape the paparazzi? Did the British 
Secret Service kill her to stop a Muslim connection to the Royal Family?

Who Killed Diana? is  the story of what actually did happen on that August 
weekend, and thus whether the facts do or do not support the idea that the 
death of Diana was no accident - but deliberate murder.
