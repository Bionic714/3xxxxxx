"The Sweet Escape" is a pop song written by Gwen Stefani, featured artist Akon and Giorgio Tuinfort for Stefani's second solo album The Sweet Escape (2006). The song was released as the album's second single in early 2007 (see 2007 in music). It has reached the top five in the United States, top ten in Canada and United Kingdom, and the top twenty in Ireland.

Stefani told MTV that the song "puts me on the yellow brick road to the No Doubt record I might do. I can smell it. 'Sweet Escape' and some other melodies remind me of the No Doubt feeling."

The song's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and premiered on January 10, 2007 on Yahoo! Music. The video features Stefani in jail, and the Harajuku Girls are once again prominent in this video. Stefani and the dancers then escape with help from featured artist Akon. The video, filled with images of gold, contains allusions to the "Rapunzel" fairy tale as well as a prominent featuring of the 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe and a Buick police car. In another version of the video, the Chevrolet symbol is replaced with Stefani's "G" symbol that is featured on many other objects through out the video.

"The Sweet Escape" premiered on MTV's top-ten video chart program Total Request Live on January 16, 2007, where it has since peaked at number two. After its January 20 debut on MuchMusic's Countdown, it peaked at number thirteen for the week of February 16.
