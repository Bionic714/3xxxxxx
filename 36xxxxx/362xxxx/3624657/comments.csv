,stevobeevo,2009-03-04T00:19Z,"This torrent only has seven songs from Bolsa de Agua; El Paso, Jesus Christ, Big Santiago Bust, Recipts & Fevers, Waterbag, Hallelujah Shine, and Layin' Around the House.  The other ten songs are from Ghosts of Hallelujah: Up On High, Ghosts of Hallelujah, Gangsta Lean, County Orange, Ladies Choice, January 6, Pair of Goats, Fine Leather Truck, Bean Bowl, and Grievin' and Smokin'.  I'm not complaining, the songs sound great.  I just want to help everyone who wants to have the songs labeled correctly."
