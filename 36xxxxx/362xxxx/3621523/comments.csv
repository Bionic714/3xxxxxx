,Deezo_m1,2007-02-18T22:34Z,Ok Guys ... this is my 1st torrent so i hope it works!
,Deezo_m1,2007-02-21T00:58Z,"ok ... lookin at my utorrent it seems like a couple of you guys are nearly finished (if i'm doin this right!) 


I put this on my friends comp the other day and it didnt load the roms! simply at it was lookin for them on my pc... 


So if this happens to you .. just go to 'options' and then 'directories' then just browse to the rom folder and 'ok'

Street Fighter Alpha 3 is Wicked! 

As are the Metal Slug games..


Peace..."
,usucdik,2007-03-14T06:41Z,"ugh; one huge rar? I just wanted a few things, forget this"
,Deezo_m1,2007-03-17T14:52Z,Forget this? this is a great torrent if you dont want it ... Fuck off and get something else .. why leave comments like that? you mug!
,usucdik,2007-03-31T01:33Z,"Why leave a comment? Mug?

Uh, well, I fucking said it for the reasons I stated in it, asshole. You have many items in there and it's a fucking gigabyte and a half, I'm not gonna download your piece of shit torrent like that for a couple things."
,Deezo_m1,2007-03-31T17:17Z,"ok well people can choose for themselves... and with a name like yours you are obviously out to offend people anyway not help ..


your comments will be ignored

,traydemark03,2007-06-23T09:06Z,"None of the roms work.  Everytime I try to start one, it shows a list of all the missing files required to run the rom."
,traydemark03,2007-06-23T09:28Z,Actually they worked on a different emulator.
,Deezo_m1,2007-06-24T02:06Z,"read one of my earlier comments mate ..the emulater is lookin for the roms in the location they were on my comp .. so just go to 'options' and then 'directories' then just browse to the rom folder and 'ok'

enjoy :)"
,Deezo_m1,2007-07-25T03:12Z,"BTW did you guys know that Cps-3 has now been emulated? thats means 1 thing!!

,Deezo_m1,2007-07-25T03:14Z,"Actually search 'Cps3' for best results ...

btw if anyone knows how to get the hori dead or alive 4 stick or the hori virtua fighter stick to work with this on vista plz let me know ... ty
"
,jazzytrumpet,2008-01-22T05:49Z,man thanks for the torrent all of them work so far. I had to change the properties under display from draw to direct 3d thought after I found the roms like you said. also I saw you want to know how to get the hori stick to work in mame. heres how I did it first go to google and type in xbox360 controller mame . when you did this do a search under images on the first page of images you see a pic of  the controller click and it should take you to a blog in which somebody guides on how to do it also he gives you a like to the guide that tells you what you need to download
,Deezo_m1,2008-01-26T15:00Z,"thanks man,i'll take a look ... 

i actually picked up a dreamcast a while back with the official sega arcade stick witch is cool as they play copies straight out of the box with no modding needed so been downloading some of the capcom fighters for that :)
street fighter 2 HF is on xbox live arcade as will super street fighter 2 turbo HD remix be soon .... also street fighter 4 will be out this year ... 
metal slug 3 is on live arcade ... 
and the CPS-3 emulater with 3rd strike works perfectly with the hori sticks and vista ..... 

OLD SkOOL RULEZ hehe "
,blueconsole,2008-03-17T18:27Z,"Hey thanks for the upload.

But I do have one question. Is it possible to change resolution in the game? I tired changing it through the MAME program but nothing happened. "
,Assalute,2008-03-28T21:18Z,"why no one seeds!!!?? i really want this!!it has all the greatest oldskool games i want!!

OLDSKOOL RULES"
,latiniux,2008-05-11T03:38Z,"come on guys, this is a great torrent! please seed for a few days! Keep seeding!"
,bertomagtule,2008-05-16T15:02Z,"sir, i have downloaded ur game, it has a king of fighter 2001, 2002, and 2003, but when i open MAME, only up to KOF 2000 is displayed. Help me plz, i need to play  KOF 2002. Please Help!"
[T],ooStevo,2008-05-19T20:55Z,It works but how come the resolution is so low? Ive changed it to 800x600 but it makes no difference.
,Deezo_m1,2008-06-07T23:46Z,I'm guessing that back in the day when arcades used tv monitors the default is 800 x 600 just like the 360 ect when its not in hd ( like mine grrrr)
,PeterGrif222,2008-06-16T20:37Z,what are the controls for a keyboard for these games?
,SystemOfADownPIRATE,2008-06-27T19:13Z,Come on.........SEED...........IT IS TOO SLOW........10.0KBSDOWN AND NO UP SPEED 
,suedeb,2008-06-30T18:40Z,this torrent is excellent! thanks man! after i unzipped it took me a little while to figure out how to run them.. to open and play the roms you have to go to options then directories and in there you can set the path to where the rom folder is located..should be relatively easy to figure out from there. street fighter alpha and marvel vs capcom rocks! 
,maximus2816,2008-07-10T20:03Z,"Ok i'm a newbie and i need some help please, i've download it, but cant get any games to work, someone, anyone please help miss these classic games so much!!!!"
,Deezo_m1,2008-07-11T12:53Z,"Ok Click on the Mame32 application ... Click on 'options' in the top left corner of the window .... go down to 'Directories' and click ...... in the little window that pops up click on the 'Browse' button .... now find the location of your mame 32 folder (probably documents then downloads) open the floder and highlight the 'roms' folder and click 'ok' .... now click 'ok' agin inthe little directories folder ..... now in the main Mame 32 window down the left side it has a list (all games,available.clones ect) click on 'clones' and then click on 'available' mame will then scan your roms folder and give you a list of games with little green icons next to then ........ play"
,maximus2816,2008-07-13T10:33Z,OMFG it works thank you and thankyou again so much for some of the greatest games every!!!!!
,maximus2816,2008-07-13T10:34Z,is there any way to config a ps2 pad or xbox pad to this????
,ravenslay,2008-07-16T10:26Z,"uhmm...guys, pls seed... it's kinda slow...

-thanks"
,maximus2816,2008-07-21T01:28Z,"sorry to bother you again, but my computer had a fit so i deleted some stuff, and cleaned it up a bit, download the torrent again but now when i click to play none of the games work??? any ideas???"
,johnrivers,2008-10-24T19:23Z,oostevo to have a proper screen go to options /default game options and uncheck effects and keep scan lines as none.
,T4,2008-11-05T11:54Z,How many games do you have in mame?
,Juice_lokz,2008-11-07T08:46Z,"I just finished downloading the torrent
i click on the file and it doesn't work.

it says ""Windows cannot open this file""
I need help on how to work this thing.
I wanna  play some marvel vs capcom ASAP"
,parskahay818,2008-11-17T12:30Z,"Pretty big file for some roms, but worth the wait.  I wish it had Capcom vs SNK though, really hard to find a working rom.  Also, I enjoy playing these games on the Dos Version of Mame.  Thnx for the upload"
,acidtrip,2008-11-29T17:54Z,"the best emulators are MAME, NES and the great SNES! abandonware forever!"
,DEATHBRINGR,2008-12-06T22:10Z,"Hi there, first off thanks for this awesome emulator. But i wanted to know if anyone has been able to play 2 player on any of the games? I have 2 xbox 360 controllers that are hooked up but i can only play one player on it? anybody have any ideas thanks."
,DEATHBRINGR,2008-12-06T23:03Z,"OK never mind i found out how to play 2 player. If anyone else wants to know all you do is press ""2"" on your keyboard first and then you can use both controllers.

Now I just need to know how to configure the controls."
,tassostuna,2009-01-03T03:35Z,"dude thank you it works

,SharinganLust,2010-02-15T21:11Z,"This is a great torrent, and thanks. Love the shit out of it. I do have two questions though.

I've downloaded MAME32 countless times before, and I've never had any trouble with input besides this single time. Any preferences, maybe a download from someone who has a perfect setup? Thanks.

Second off, has anyone gotten a working copy of Street Fighter III 3rd Strike: Fight for the Future? It's the one rom I can NEVER get a perfect download of. Any suggestions? And thanks, once again. Amazing torrent."

,sonic4482,2012-04-07T07:36Z,"Ok guys, just incase some people are still having trouble with this torrent, let me explain this quick. THIS DOES WORK, but you need to set it up so it can find the roms. When you first start up Mame 32, go to options. A scroll down menu will appear. Look for the option that says ""Directories..."" and click it. A small box will pop up called, ofcourse, ""Directories"". You should find a button that says ""Browse"". Click it, and another menu will pop up, but this time it will be your computer itself. Look for where you keep your Mame 32 folder(i keep mine on my desktop). After you do, you need to open that folder and then find the ""Roms"" folder. Click it once, then hit open, then hit Ok when you get back to the ""Directories"" box. After it finishes checking the files and games you can then proceed with the final step, enjoy."
,REBEL-RASH,2012-04-17T22:14Z,"All games working, thank you"
