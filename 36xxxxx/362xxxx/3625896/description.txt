And remember, I can only seed up to 1 mbps (it is about 80 kbytes per second), so the first person will have this in about 20 hours or so. But stillit's woth to download it, cause the quality is perfect!!!
And also remember to seed after complete download so you have 1:1 ratio (upload/download). It means that you seed as much as you download!
