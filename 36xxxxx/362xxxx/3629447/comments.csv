Name: Stranger Than Fiction
Release Year: 2006
IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420223/
Rating: 7.8 (10,746 votes)
Runtime: 113 mins

Type: Original DVDRip (Re-encoded from original DVD)
Video Size: 432x240 resizes to 458x240 on playback
Video Codec: H264 (MPEG-4) using x264 ABR=460 QCOMP=.8
Video Quality: 8.8/10 (10 is and can only be source DVD)

Bottomline: Despite the low bitrate, thanks to the low res, the 
video is fairly free from blockiness and stuff. I personally can never
tell the difference between 64kbps vorbis audio and source audio.
