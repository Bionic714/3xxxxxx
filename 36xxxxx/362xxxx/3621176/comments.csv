,cmai,2007-03-02T04:24Z,"after install, when I tried fifa.exe I get error 'Please insert the DVD-ROM, select OK and restart application'. I tried to copy the fifa.exe over from the crack folder then I get error 'Please insert the FIFA 07 play disk into the drive and select Retry. Select Cancel to quit'. Can anybody help? thanks. "
,lav4,2007-03-03T19:55Z,varför säger datorn att det krävs directx 9.0c eller senare version fast jag har det?

I had the same thing.
But if you copy the hackfile and the other thing.
The other thing is a keygen you must open the keygen and autorun.exe.
Then you must generate."

,cmai,2007-03-07T17:28Z,"Volcaninho,
Thanks for your reply. I did try copying over from the crack folder (there are only 2 files, 'fifa07.exe' and the generate file 'rld-f07k.exe') to the installed folder as instructed but it still does not work. Also tried to copy 'autorun.exe' (although this one is for installation only, I guess). The generate file was also used to go thru installation.... "
