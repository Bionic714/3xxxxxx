,trosso,2007-02-27T14:27Z,"Is this the real release and not the same as ""Biohazard 4 / Resident Evil 4 w. mouse support"" that released 2007-02-14? Because what I heard that version is some guy that has converted the Gamecube version directly to PC. 

And that version of the game wasent free from errors and stuff. So, is this the Official release of Resident Evil, released by Ubisoft?"
[T],Malekay,2007-02-27T14:49Z,"trosso: yes, this is the real, working release. The other, BIOHAZARD, was a complete failure. This is the real deal!

hope u like it!"

[T],Malekay,2007-02-28T02:48Z,"Bamse_1985: what´s RS 4?

made-of-technetium: I haven try the game myself but I don´t think it is. Can´t answer that question. Someone else?"
,made-of-technetium,2007-02-28T03:46Z,"My mistake. For some reason there seems to be 2 nfos in the torrent, ""unl-re4.nfo"" about the game & ""axdvd-omd.nfo"" which seems to refer to a Korean film called ""Old Miss Diary"". Why? I don't know."

I've done everything right...
But when I try to run the game ( after copied the crack ) a box pop up: 
Unable to authenticate original disc within time limit.
Please have a look at http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=timeout for further, more detailed information.
Try again?

PLEASE HELP MEE!!?? Thanks..."

,dumbwhiteguy12,2007-03-12T21:24Z,oh wait never mind. You have to extract the crack rar to whatever folder your game is stored in. Don't worry when it asks you to overwrite the game file in it.
,Donkeylord,2007-04-12T05:20Z,downloaded 304 times and 4 seeders. Wow how good is that??
