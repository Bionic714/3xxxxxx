,load_error,2007-02-28T13:15Z,"If this movie is what I think it is, I guess KillingZoe is ready for a nomination for the next year's award... 

Just open it with Winrar (doubleclick, select winrar from the list)  :)

,zatarra,2007-03-01T22:14Z,"Yo, guys I see you had a whole discussion on how to open this movie... well let me tell you that i did not get it and well before you call me stupit (I might be a little) i would like to ask you to please explain in very simple and easy way how to get this movie open i got it and dont know what to do with it, i got winrar but can manege to open... i will apreciate your help :)"
,hornywarney,2007-04-03T05:35Z,"Use ""win rar"" or ""win ace"". Double click on the file ""epic-thdaaw"" (file 001) and extract it. Save it in a new folder and you will have a 720meg avi."
,DSMeTailer,2007-08-03T06:48Z,"What the hell am I supposed to do with this?  I have downloaded TONS of .avi movies, and have never come across this kind.  hornywarney said to double-click on 001 and extract it.  This sounds great, only double-clicking it only results in the old ""Windows does not recognize this file"" window.  Using a web service to find more information resulted only in telling me that this is only part of a file.  Great.  WinRAR doesn't regognize it as an archive either.  Is is so hard to just put upload it as a complete AVI?  Why use this useless format that leaveseven someone quite familier with video formats scratching his head.  Somebody please help me out here, I am going to snap."
,DSMeTailer,2007-08-06T22:26Z,"Alright, I got it.  Thanks load_error & hornywarney for the 50/50 explanation.  This is the most moronic way to share an AVI that I have seen to date.  Perhaps you could just stick to good old single RAR archives, or some other traditional way.  There is a reason why the other methods are so popular, because they are not confusing, annoying, and time consuming.  Anyway, thanks for the upload."

,necrocide,2008-01-15T15:48Z,"1. Find a good media player that is compatible with your system; and has an interface that works for you. Doesn't have a relentless requirement of connecting to the internet every time you try and play a media file of some kind.-everyone has their own preference.

(insert homework here)

2. Do some research on the concept of torrenting. 

3.Find a good codec pack

4. The only advantage that winace has over winrar is the good 'ol .xef files (use winrar!)

5. Right click on the file and select 'extract here'

Problem solved.

Some things you just have to figure out for yourself........

Just like the rest of us."
,necrocide,2008-01-15T16:00Z,"Err... any reviews on the download I'm rather keen on a Darwin awards doco?

These retarded comments are getting old fast!"
,gardengc,2008-03-03T10:55Z,"double click on any of the epic-thdaaw with a numerical extensions. when it says windows bla bla click select program then winrar. 
and for media player, vlc is compact versatile and stable. its not pretty but its free, and has no strange requirements. besides real and quick time all vids I've tried worked on it even corrupted ones.
and it is a funny movie. I felt bad for the car guy"
,madplumber,2009-03-07T09:50Z,"Kind of strange extract this. I have stopped double click years ago and only using right click and extract to.... In this one it seems to that you must double click and choose program. 
If you don't have winrar you must download it.

so: Double click/choose program, chose winrar, chose path there, done!

Thanks Kollll for the movie!"

,KRuZY1,2010-07-10T13:20Z,"You have to wonder about some people sometimes!nnI like the file-security of RAR files (and 001, 002, etc.).nnThanks Kollll,nK1n"
,Sierra102,2011-08-09T14:42Z,10 mb of compression no one gives a fuck
,zaroba,2012-04-26T21:51Z,"Even if they are easy to open and use, rar's are completely USELESS and a complete waste of time and hard drive space and reduce potential seeders.

AVI files work perfectly fine in torrents in this age of high speed internet.  Get with the times and stop living in the damn stone age."
