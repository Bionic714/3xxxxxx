,Stefanzon,2007-05-29T14:23Z,"It's not Nossies fucking fault that theres is only one MP3 or that the songs are mixed. It's the record company that have done it that way.  You fucking cunts. Im sick and tired of people that dont know what the fuck they are talking about. Somebody said that Nossie should learn more about trance, wahy should he? This is 100% Trance, if you bastards dont know that then its you who are fucked."
