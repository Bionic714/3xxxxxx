,donacgr,2007-02-17T14:55Z,is this good quallity?
,jayeuk,2007-02-18T00:51Z,Got a lot of time for Kollll who's uploads are usually new and good quality. This however is poor. The picture drifts in and out of focus and the sound distorts regularly. Only download if you're desperate to see it but I'd hang on for a better version.

Did they seriously think this was a good seed?"
,batman17098,2007-02-18T08:31Z,well i just got done watching this version even though it was really bad i can't complain b/c what u expect for being up so quick... i dont see how it was a gig though lol... but anyways i was disappointed in the movie it was overall good movie.. but the fight sceenes where way to short and they really did a bad job on the plot they rushed through making it so quick it seems... but i did like how they left the end open for a 2nd one just hope it's better then this one... oh and i'm hopeing that when a real good version of it comes out the movie will seem alot better lol....

,spook952,2007-02-18T20:30Z,the worst thing i've ever seen bad sound and really bad video don't download
,dacoach,2007-02-21T05:34Z,"Terrible video (crooked in frame), and audio is muddy.  Besides, it downloads into what ultimately turns into 2 VCD files when you burn the image files. Sorry, but I cannot recommend as a download.  Not that desperate to see the movie."
,SnowFire72,2007-03-01T18:06Z,This is possibly the worst cam quality I have seen to date...
