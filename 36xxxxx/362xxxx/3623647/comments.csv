this the game?"
,arand2,2007-02-21T19:49Z,"YES, this is the full CD-iso, with movies and certain additional sounds (I think), the one available at HotU is a crack. Also, the full CD version is usually simpler to get to work with the Historical Earth Patch.

This iso is also available for direct download at:

,Fisko,2007-02-22T01:58Z,Cant install it on Vista :(
,tehtechman,2007-02-24T16:18Z,Fisko: dont use vista you fucktard.  jesus people are so fucking stupid.
,arand2,2007-03-01T21:12Z,"Vista will comengetus , sooner or later. Anyhow, the game is made for win 95/98. So to install it in XP you need to right-click on the SETUP.EXE (on the CD), choose 'properties', choose 'compability', and in the drop down box set the compability for win 95/98. I have not tested the game in Vista and do not know if compability mode is available there.

,Kimberly_Janna1,2007-10-16T21:35Z,"kasseey, I just don't get it.
I have installed Win 98, but I don't know how to install the game. Can you explain a little bit more? =)"
,arand2,2007-12-08T02:56Z,"Aint able to seed now, unfortunately, being behind BT-restrictive firewall...

The instructions for installation described here are only for installation in Windows XP (using win98 emulation).

I frankly don't know how to install it in Windows 98 but I think it is supposed to just work there, as far as I remember, win98 was awhile ago now...

If you'd like to get in contact you could always email to evoiso@arand2.e4ward.com (non-direct, but forwarded email), since I seldom drop by here.
