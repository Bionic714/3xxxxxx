,SuperJoppan,2007-02-26T17:02Z,"after a quick check with google, I can inform you that PDTV is an abbreviation short for Pure Digital Television.
 It is a label given to files that were ripped directly from a purely digital source, having less resolution than HDTV"

,phatav8r,2007-02-28T01:19Z,"None of the Ep 17 torrents give me a file I can view. Either explorer crashes trying to get to the file, or Media Player crashes and won't play it. It also won't play with PowerDVD. Something wrong with the codecs or something. Go back to Xvid."
,simbico,2007-03-06T21:35Z,"phatav8r, the same to me, this is really troubling, please someone help me, a lot of people say this is the best episode:S"

,spiegelnder,2010-11-13T10:47Z,"Even though this series has a considerable popularity, I don't understant why it barely has any seeds throughout the list of torrents around here!
I have managed to download up to episode 16 so far, but lately with ep.17 I am stuck for days  at 0.0% and neither does any of the other torrents work. :("
