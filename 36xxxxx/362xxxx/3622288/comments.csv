Vad jag kan se så har du däremot bara laddat upp en musikfil på 67MB. Det kallar jag för amatör! Endast de RIKTIGA grabbarna laddar upp en sådan här serie själv."

BUT I am much interested in the movies release. Pando do you mind to place the movies first?"

Only the rate 2 per month is a little (more) slow. This tempo would take 40 months which is almost 3.5 years. Nobody's gonna follow that :-)"
