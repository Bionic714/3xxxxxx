This is Suneohair newest album. Released 2/21/2007. It also includes a DVD with a medley of his singles performed at a live concert. I have them uploaded to youtube, but will be throwing a DVD rip on here as well.

This is in Apple Lossless, so you need iTunes.  No DRM or anything. Ripped straight from the CD. Lossless gives much better quality than MP3 @ 320. I can hear the difference. You are welcome to convert to your favorite codec and bitrate however. You are starting with a great copy though :)

Also included are high res scans of the entire package. The lyrics come on different pattern swatches like you see on the cover so you can change the look of the  cover. Pretty neat. I didnt scan all the swatches though, just the lyrics on the back of them.

Enjoy this amazing CD. I will be seeding for a couple weeks.?I have pretty much every album from him. If you have any requests please let me know. I do hope that after listening, you will buy his albums.

Unfortunetly Piratebay doesnt accept Japanese input, well it does but substitutes all of it with question marks. As a note, all the songs title are in Japanese if they appear that way on the album.
