,StenilsoN,2007-02-26T17:05Z,"I tried to write the subtitles in the description in their native language, but it seems that doesn't work (that's why you see the ?????). I put the english translation behind the (/) in case it wouldn't work.
Only English, French, Dutch, Bulgarian and Arabic subtitles are available."
