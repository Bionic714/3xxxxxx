Since this is such a small file, please seed for a couple of days so that others can have a chance to grab it.

Next week, hear the adventure of how my little sister's teddy-bear attempted to scratch my balls with his nylon claws."
,shdwsclan,2008-05-29T19:11Z,"This does NOT have a virus in the replacement executable.

Scanned with Symantec Antivirus Corporate 10 (NOT NORTON) 5/23/08 defs.

All other Anti-Viruses are garbage compare to this.
FPROT is garbage because it finds viruses in files that have none.
Kapersky is garbage because it misses all the viruses that Symantec finds.
Mcafee wastes processing cycles, and doesnt find have the viruses that symantec finds.
Norton is a bloaded piece of garbageware that is so slow, that by the time it finds a virus, its already spread beyond repair.
AVG Free....hmm....i wonder WHY its free...."
,Superfazekas,2008-06-16T21:14Z,"Because SOME people support freeware!!!
you dumb fuck!"

,mrbjorklund,2010-03-07T14:14Z,"Noo.... ofcource it ain't a virus, do not look at this link where it is scanned with 24 virus scanners.

,Mainers,2010-05-17T05:00Z,"Cheers for uploading this snowhow, I will seed for a bit.
This is @ vlpronj, this file is 100% CLEAN you mug, before you start screaming ""virus"" at least use a half way decent scanner, F-Prot is nothing but a joke. Make sure you no what the fuck you on about before you leave a comment like you did !!!"
,snowhow,2011-11-28T20:25Z,"WOW! Over four years later and still going strong.

,Danimal1q2w3,2012-06-08T20:11Z,"Thank you so very very much.... I am using a 1TB external harddrive on my XBOX360 and i was using it as fat32 as that is the only file system supported officially... then i heard that it can utilize hfs+ and that way i could have HD movies over 4GB. The other explorers i used were read only and i could not write to the drive... you saved my ass man, id like to buy you a beer"
