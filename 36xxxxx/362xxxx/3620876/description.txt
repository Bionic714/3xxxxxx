"We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank" is Modest Mouse's 5th full-length album and their first with ex-Smiths legend Johnny Marr. It was produced by Dennis Herring, who was also behind 2004's "Good News For People Who Love Bad News." Once again it's Isaac Brock's vocals that take front-and-center.
