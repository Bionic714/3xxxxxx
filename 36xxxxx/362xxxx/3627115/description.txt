Plac Zbawiciela ( Saviour's Place ) 2006 < Xvid PL+English subtitles>
Drama

This is a movie by acclaimed polish director Krzysztof Krauze and his wife. His most awarded movie was "Dlug" (The Debt). And both stories are similar in some ways. They're telling about injustice in common people cases or situation from young polish capitalism. And influence of these situations on a living of this fairly normal citizens. Here we've got a couple with two children and his mother. Bartek, humble and hard working husband is working all day long in some building business and he is trying to start his own business, but with no luck. A wife is taking care of boys. They are a day before moving to they own flat. And that is the point when everything is screwing up. This social drama is telling a lot about situation of common people in Poland right now, you can say middle class, because they are bought higher educated and young but somehow can't get things straight. House developer with whom they have paid for a flat is going to be bankrupt, she cant find a job and the guy is to scared and undecided to go on his own with job. All paths are leading to tragedy. A movie will touch your heart and tell you a lot about mood and feelings of young people, couples, in Poland which didn't catch the train for opportunities of polish young capitalism. Great cinematography and direction. Worth a watch.
