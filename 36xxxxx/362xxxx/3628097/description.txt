BBC announces that WTC7 collapsed, BEFORE IT DID!!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On September 11th 2001, BBC World reported at 4:57pm Eastern Time that the 
"Salomon Brothers Building" (more commonly known as WTC7) had collapsed.

This even made the 5pm EST headlines. 
What is bizarre is that the building did not actually collapse until 5:20pm EST!

9/11 was unusual enough without BBC World foretelling the fate of WTC 7.  

What is even stranger, is that the female reporter is telling the world that the building had collapsed when you can see it in the background over her left shoulder.

Then at 5:15pm EST, just five minutes before the building did actually collapse, 
her live connection from New York to London mysteriously fails.  

Building Seven was 47 storeys, modern in design with structural 
steel throughout, yet it symmetrically collapsed in 6.5 seconds.

No steel framed skyscraper has ever collapsed due to fire, before or after 9/11. 

Most people who find out about WTC7, believe it was brought down 
by a controlled demolition. Even demolition experts agree.

Please investigate 9/11 - Time is of the essence.
