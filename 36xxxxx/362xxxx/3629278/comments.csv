Deleted it."

not in classic media player..."
,loquex,2007-03-07T06:21Z,"this is it.  Amazing quality, the dark scenes and black screens look great. Much better than deathmule which delivers the same quality of a 350 MB DivX in twice the file size. I just wished you used a different sound codec, AAC or MP3, not MS.  This file had a few erros, but was totally fine.  I repeat, incredible quality!!  Played with VLC, no audio problems at all."
