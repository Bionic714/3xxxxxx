,blue_luke,2007-07-23T14:23Z,"I installed it 6-7 months ago (not sure) worked flawlwssly until last week !?
Now I get a message panel ""SERV #001"" and ""CLED error"" And it will not boot :-(
I googled this message and it seems to be with the dongle emulation acting up, so I reinstalled it and it appears and load OK but once finished installing, I immediately get the message again.
What gives?"
,tbone_999,2007-08-11T21:03Z,How am i supposed to download this? i click download torrent and it downloads but then i cant open that file. am i doin something wrong?
,lomega,2007-09-17T22:23Z,"you need to download and install a bittorrent client.  then when you double click the torrent you downloaded, it will open up in the bittorrent client and then you will be ready to download ..  i hope "
,Tangodenoxiusrei,2007-10-11T13:38Z,"my win rar says the file is damage, and I could't fix 'em"
,suckerpunched,2007-10-16T00:34Z,the CLED error happened to me when I tried to put N3 in my new machine. I think it might have something to do with xp64 cuz it works fine in xp media center

,ryan21255,2008-04-13T20:48Z,"Why is it that everytime I try to upload this program it stops at 84%? Is it just me or is anyone else having a hard time trying to upload this thing. It installs the drivers just fine, but the program will stall everytime. "
,schrade,2008-06-04T23:48Z,"Nice upload, this is a great program we use it at my school, Seed please!"
,rayman08,2008-06-17T03:26Z,helloooooo thanks great upload does it work??????
,Ac_blenda,2008-12-05T18:01Z,"Fucking damn right. This torrent works a treat!!! Fairly quick download and an installation even my mum could manage. Oh yeah and the best thing about it; The Syncrosoft crack thingy takes up hardly any CPU whatsoever. An all round thumbs up for this one. Thanks a lot.
By the way, does anyone know where i might find a decent torrent of Steinberg's Warp VST and of the PSP84 delay unit?"
,loveseeker,2009-03-04T13:27Z,For some reason i can't unrar it. the program says there is a file missing. Don't get it. What's the problem?
,compleet,2009-06-27T16:58Z,"Thanks, works great. 

I don't know why but it would only install on my c:drive"
,perostoj,2009-09-04T21:34Z,"I bought dongle maybe a year ago, just to examine the thing... it's not even expensive... well... the dongle is empty one :) which mean I have no license for any of the steinbergs products... so I'm wondering... can I make it work with some cracked up license and how... any link mates?

thank you for your minute"
