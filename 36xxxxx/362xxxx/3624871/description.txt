Violent but never gratuitous, emotionally powerful and never afraid to portray the ugly, destructive face of ignorance and prejudice, romper stomper excites, disturbs and boldly challenges the viewer. Its angry, raw story about a brutal, lawless group of skinheads is a savage kick in the guts. This is no simplistic street-gang film, but a rivetting portrayal of the hopelessness and blind hatred of youth that is both controversial and profound. 
It is, quite simply, unlike any film you have ever seen before. 
Enjoy the difference
