,mrjujuman,2007-02-19T05:00Z,"This is quite clearly NOT Elvis...the production quality puts the recording sometime in the 1980s, and the vocals - though obviously similar - differ enough from Presley's trademark style to render it an obvious fake.

(It's also a re-written version of Conway Twitty's hit ""It's Only Make Believe."")"

,0Trolly0,2007-12-05T02:38Z,"Yeah, this is not Elvis at all. The person who uploaded it can't be an Elvis fan otherwise he or she would know the voice of the real deal.
And as some other writter has written here, it's a re-write of a Conway Twittis song and the singer sounds more like him, and yet not."
