I recorded this Cranberries live concert from a television broadcast in 1999. I'm not sure if it was performed in 1999 or earlier, the exact date is unknown.

It was recorded to VHS cassette, a few weeks later copied to MiniDisc (ATRAC SP 292 kbps). This was transferred to the PC digitally. LAME 3.97 -preset fast standard for mp3 encoding (avg. bitrate approx. 150 kbps). Despite all these steps, the quality was not degraded too much i think - it was not too great to begin with.


Tracklist:

01 - Promises			5.30
02 - Animal instinct		3.58
03 - Loud and clear		2.53
04 - Ode to my family		4.34
05 - Linger			4.33
