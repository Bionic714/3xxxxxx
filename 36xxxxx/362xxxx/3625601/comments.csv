,hunnilover,2007-03-04T02:30Z,Why are there files missing???
,hunnilover,2007-03-04T02:48Z,"After 3rd attempt to unpack, it got to 100% and then said it cannot initialise the set-up due to some bulls***. So, I had to go to my temp folder to execute the 'setup' file. Now its in the middle of setting up."
,Divnada,2007-03-29T21:46Z,hope its working! thanks man
,jamied,2007-03-31T18:20Z,@JF_TPB: Yes this is a beta.
,equazcion,2007-04-04T04:52Z,"Gee, I ain't no graduate school professor, but wouldn't it be really swell if people actually labeled their torrents as BETA if that's what they fucking are? You know everyone's waiting for the final version, you know they'll think this is it if you don't say it's beta in the title, so why exactly would you leave out that little detail? This is equivalent to a fake file. You're no better than people who share renamed porn movies. This shit is so annoying."
,djingen,2007-04-04T08:52Z,the only problem with beta is it kills the full cracked vers. of CS2 I just experianced that. or am I alone??
