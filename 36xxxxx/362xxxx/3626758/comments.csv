,My-IT-Guy,2007-04-06T11:39Z,To my disapointment - this program is for Palm OS - not Windows PPC or Windows Mobile.  All you HP users - search on - and maybe post back here should you find a PPC version..

,mbc419,2007-11-07T10:59Z,"It does work, but wen I updated the program to v.4.0.5 via palm and the registration code becomes invalid for some reason and goes back to 15 day trial mode. I reinstalled the 4.0.0 with ptunes.exe and hotsync and re-entered the same reg. number to get to work again in full version 4.0.0...sorry bout the novel lol."
,eovnu87435ds,2008-02-20T05:12Z,"Great app, but do you think someone could put up the latest version? 4.0.6"
,Rycon,2008-04-14T22:31Z,"Worked for me with my Palm TX. DO NOT AUTO UPDATE, they blacklisted the serial, dont need to update anyway. (To update you have to connect to a WIFI internet or something in your palm, just unselect Auto Update every 30 days in the settings for pocket tunes, done)"
,Rycon,2008-04-14T22:33Z,"If anybody can get me a 4.06 (Or whatever the latest is) Serial, I think I can make a torrent with the latest version."
