,nuk3r,2007-02-27T19:51Z,"mooky I tried this pack on about 10 computers and never got this error so I can't find a solution to your problem ...
You can try some of these things , maybe one of them works ... :

1. Be sure your Windows is the Professional version .
2. Be sure you chose ""Windows XP Professional VLK"" in the drop-down box of the Keygen. Some versions of windows only accept that kind of keys. Also do not use serials from the ""Windows XP Pro Serial Key Changer.exe"" window. They do not work .
3. Try downloading the validation control from this address : http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/downloads/validate.aspx . Follow the instructions on the site .
4. Download the latest updates and try again .
5. If none of these work u should try installing another copy of Windows XP Professional because your version of Windows could be the problem ...

Hope this will be useful ... If one of these worked please let me know which one(s) ."
,mooky,2007-02-28T01:34Z,"cheers nuk3r. I have a feeling it IS my copy of windows. it's about 4 years old and the serial begins FCKGW. i read in Wikipedia that there were many codes that began with this and they blocked it once they found out that ""We'd"" found out about it..  :-(
anywayz... have tried everything u said, it just keeps saying the same thing. it won't let my install SP2 either. Problem is, is that every copy of XP i have Downloaded is duff. can you reccomend a good one that works? (it needs to have SP2!!) media center edition would be cool..
I spend too much time downloading XP's that don't work and my patience is getting very thin so any links would be most helpfull.
Thank in advance."
,mooky,2007-02-28T01:44Z,"oh, yeah. i did a clean install of my windows again with same result. i even tried using some of those keys on the keygen to install it with, the only one that worked was my original key which begins FCKGW RHQQ2 YXRKT ***** *****
It must be something to do with the key being blocked (early version of XP I guess)

My control panel says the version i have is WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL 2002.
Dunno if that helps. cheers again."
,nuk3r,2007-02-28T06:37Z,"Your key ends with 8TG6W - 2B7Q8, right ? I know beacuase I also have probably the exact version on a CD . And you DO NOT have SP2 on it .... please give me a PM (just click my name up there with your email address and ill make a torrent with my version of XP SP2 just for you ."
,mooky,2007-02-28T07:36Z,"to NUK3r..

You my friend are a star...

,alienus,2007-03-07T08:58Z,"to avoid any trouble, i used a windows xp pro, with another key, to validate it.
this worked fine, and it became validated.
unfortunatly after the first updates from windows
and he asked for a restart.
he didnt grand a validated code anymore.
wherefore he said ""i became victim of software piracy"" (stupid windows :P) 
when i said, , remember me later.
i recieved an error 0x00080004
or something like that.
and couldnt start my pc anymore..

i solved this problem by installing a genuine windows xp home edition,  but, stil, i wonder why he didnt see it as genuine anymore after a restart, while he said it was ok, before it?
p.s. i have installed some security updates, which i blame. but could some features of the crack be outdatet after new securty updates from windows??

i have now running windows xp home editon fine. and wont need the special pack ..


TIP
i'd like to warn people to make a backup ON ANOTHER DISK...before doing this
the crack worked ok for a while, but if you need to reinstal windows, you can get your settings back by the backup."
,nuk3r,2007-03-07T12:48Z,For this pack to work you must have Windows XP Professional SP2 installed . The pack won't work on the SP1 version nor will it work on Windows XP Home Edition . I repeat it ONLY works on Windows XP Professional SP2 and it works perfectly fine .
,Lezduur,2007-03-25T13:49Z,"i'll tell you guys what i did.
i used the keygen from here, and i used the key update tool from microsoft.
i ran the program, and it needed the net on, and updated/checked some of my files.
i had installed a VLK edition, with sp2 slipstreamed, something i made.
before sp2, my serial was the FCKGW one.
for sp2 i used the 7XRRM one.
i created a key[not vlk, but pro], and put it in 
the program, and it said
sorry but the key has been used.

i made another, and i got it to update my installed serial.
restarted comp.
key update tool says update complete.
go to explorer, is this copy of windows genuine? link,
page opens, 
WHAM! I HAVE AN ORIGINAL XP PROFESSIONAL!
with my own personal serial.

and i dont gotta worry, coz i had a laptop, vlk, and genuine advantaged that, then tried it on the desktop, but it said, too bad key used.
so i think no one else can use the key i used from the keygen.
hopefully.
lol!"
