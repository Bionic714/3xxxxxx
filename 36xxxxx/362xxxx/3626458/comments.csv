How to Find Fake Torrents Uploaded by the MPAA and RIAA

The MPAA, RIAA and several anti-piracy organizations are constantly trying to trap 
people into downloading fake torrents. These torrents are hosted on trackers that 
are setup to collect IP addresses of all the ?pirates? who try to download these files.

To make these traps more visible, Fenopy just introduced the FakeFinder. The FakeFinder 
lists the most popular fake torrents and the latest fake trackers. It also allows you to 
search for fake torrents by keyword or infohash.

The actual .torrent links for these fake files are blocked, and FakeFinder serves an 
informational purpose only. It is actually quite amusing to browse through these fake 
files and trackers. The companies that host these anti-piracy trackers came up with some 
interesting hostnames like ?dirtydevils.cyberbox.com.br? and ?bittorrent.isthebe.st?.

Although most of the IPs of these fake trackers are already blocked by blocklist software 
like PeerGuardian, they still manage to collect the IP addresses of thousands of users who
 do fall for this trap. Most torrent site admins are aware of these fakes, and remove them
 as soon as they are uploaded. It is kind of a paradox. On the one hand anti-piracy 
organizations send thousands of takedown requests to torrent sites, while they upload 
fake files with similar titles themselves.

Some might argue that downloading a fake file is not really a criminal offense. And yes, 
it is doubtful if this evidence will hold up in court. However, the job of organizations 
like the MPAA is to scare people, and that is often enough for them. The first thing they 
will probably do is send a letter to your ISP saying that you tried to download so-and-so 
file. And even if they take it a step further, they try to settle before these things are 
played out in court.

FakeFinder shows that Bi"
