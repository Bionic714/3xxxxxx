It basically says that if you question your government (or any other authority), you are mentally sick!

That's what they said in Soviet Russia.

If you said Joseph Stalin was bad, you were mentally sick and and threat to the nation!!

If you want a real documentary about 911, watch ""911 Mysteries"" or ""Loose Change: 2nd Edition"" (3rd edition coming in March). Then watch ""The Road to Tyranny"", ""Rise of The Police State"" and ""Terrorstorm""."
,PeterFile,2007-02-19T14:36Z,"No, it is not disgusting at all. 

Just because it debunks some of the crazy, insane shit that ""Loose Change: 2nd Edition"" waffles on about does not mean it is bad.

""Real documentary""? I don't think so. Drivel like that is just pumped out by mentalists!"

,willmarks,2007-02-22T12:24Z,Why even try and debate these idiots. If you can't watch this and realise how stupid the conspiracy theory is then there is no helping you.
