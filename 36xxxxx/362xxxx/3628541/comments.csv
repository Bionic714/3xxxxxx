,aini,2008-01-15T00:31Z,"I'm also unable to change the resolution above 800x600

Previous cracked games have had full resolution choices but this one does not. Doe anyone have any idea why? 

Would uninstalling a previous EP and reinstalling after the borked seasons set up get me my graphical options back?"
,Playcircus,2008-02-05T16:17Z,"If you are getting an error or a freeze after the introduction video, uninstall The Sims 2 Seasons, unmount the image file, and delete the existing The Sims 2 Seasons folder

Remount the image file and restart the installation, when you get to the key code screne go to My Computer, find the Sims 2 Seasons icon, then RIGHT-click and choose explore, you should see a folder that says ""Crack""

Open the folder and run the key gen, it should fill in automatically, continue install, after installation, go back into the crack folder, find the .exe file, and copy it, go into the TSbin folder located in The Sims 2 Seasons directory, paste it, it has to ask you if you want to copy over the file of the same name, make sure there are no copies in the folder

When you play the game wait through the introduction video and keep waiting if you don't get an error message, the first time takes a long time for it to get going but it will work

This happpened to me so I thought I would share because it would have saved me a lot of trouble if someone had posted this for me."
