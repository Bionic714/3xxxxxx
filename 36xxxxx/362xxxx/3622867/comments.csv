,SysGhost,2007-03-31T22:46Z,"I can download the whole Internet and compress it into one byte (8 bit)





rotflmfao"
,SysGhost,2007-03-31T23:01Z,"It might contain a bootsector to show a nice ""Windows Vista is loading"" shit when you boot on it, or something like that.
The rest of the ISO-file is just plain empty nulls or some other crap that is repeating itself to fill up rest of the ~700 Megabytes. 
Compressing something that is repeating itself is easy: 

7*10^8*ASCII(7A)

I just wrote 700 millions letter ""a"". Easy eh? lol"
