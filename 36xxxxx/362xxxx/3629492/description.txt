Name: Stranger Than Fiction
Release Year: 2006
IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420223/
Rating: 7.8 (10,746 votes)
Runtime: 113 mins

Type: Original DVDRip (Re-encoded from original DVD)
Video Size: 720x480 resizes to 854x240 on playback
Video Codec: H264 (MPEG-4) using x264 ABR=767 QCOMP=.8
Video Quality: 9.7/10 (10 is and can only be source DVD)
Audio: Vorbis 2-Channel 96kbps
Audio Quality: 9/10
Container: Matroska
Subtitles: None

Bottomline: The video is sharp and any noise is very hard to detect and impossible
to see during playback. There is very mild loss of detail in faint patterns but
shouldn't be noticeable unless you have seen the original DVD. As for audio, I 
personally can never tell the difference between 64kbps vorbis audio and source
audio. Let alone 96kbps.
