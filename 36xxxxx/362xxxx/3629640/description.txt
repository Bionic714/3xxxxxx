Christopher Knight is an expert in Marketing and Advertising, with over 30 years experience. He specialises in consumer psychology and market research. Today he is a self-proclaimed historian and author who researches freemasonry, often co-authoring these books with Robert Lomas. His work has been both accused of being pseudohistory [citation needed], or praised for its lucid explanations of theoretical history and masonic ritual.There is a long running feud [citation needed] between Knight and his co-author Lomas with The Catholic Herald, who they credit in the introduction to their book Uriel's Machine for "their hilarious reviews that keep us smiling". Opposition to Knight is often levied on his claims against Catholic dogma; for example in The Second Messiah he claims that the Turin Shroud is not an image of Jesus, but of the last Templar Grandmaster Jacques de Molay (who, he claims, was tortured in the same way as Christ was believed to have been crucified).
