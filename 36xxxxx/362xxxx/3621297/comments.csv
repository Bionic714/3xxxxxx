,death734,2007-02-19T02:44Z,"the sample images and stuff look great. i would recommend watching this release over any other right now. 
but you can really judge it by the movie being out 2 days ago. rocky 6 dvdscr came out 2-3 days after the movie came out in theaters"

,zcorvine9,2007-02-26T00:34Z,"Thanks kollll

This TS of Ghost Rider is slightly blurry, the sound quality slightly murky but very very watchable.  Recommended for download.

The movie itself was below average but a must see for you die hard Marvel fans.  If I were to give it an IMDb rating, it'd be a 5-6."
,DrLacroix,2007-03-02T10:04Z,What a shite film! Good if you love your choppers but the story sucks.
