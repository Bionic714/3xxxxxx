ZAPATISTA is an inspiring first-hand account of a struggle that will 
challenge the way you think about the world. Armed with sticks and words 
against a 'First World' military, eight thousand Zapatistas have fought 75,000 
Federal troops to a stand-still. Ignored by a mainstream press that cannot and 
will not cover them, the Zapatistas have used poems and children's stories 
smuggled on horseback and distributed on the internet.

An incredible film documenting the first four years of the Zapatista uprising, 
from 1994 ? 1998. Includes interviews with Subcomandante Marcos, Insurgent leaders 
Tach and Ana Maria, Chiapas Dominican priest Pablo Romo, Zach De La Rocha from 
Rage Against The Machine, Noam Chomsky, civilian commantes David and Zebedeo, 
Medea Benjamin, and more. Narration is by Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, 
Geronimo Pratt, and Mumia Abu Jamal. Rage Against the Machine, Neil Young, and 
Ozomotli provide the soundtrack. A class production in every 
way.
