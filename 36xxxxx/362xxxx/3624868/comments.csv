Why would you pack your fonts in an exe-file..?  



Get a proper virus-scanner ! ! !  "
,nuk3r,2007-02-27T20:06Z,standonit please shoot yourself . i packed them so they copy themselves automaticaly to the right folder because there are people who don't work everyday with fonts to know where to copy them . my guess says that your antivirus didn't report anything wrong with the pack . so think before you speak :|
