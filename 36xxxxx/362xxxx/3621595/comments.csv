,staxstax,2007-03-03T06:09Z,"craagle itself is not a trojan, but the package here is. It makes a directory \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\SYS32, sets its to +S so windows can't see it and installs the trojan YERM.EXE. This trojan makes frequent screenshots of your desktop and tries to upload them to a server. YERM.EXE is NOT shown in your taskmanager thanks to microsoft.

Actions to take : use utilities from sysinternals to 'manually' monitor your PC, use a firewall with tight security (try Kerio), and install automatic full system virusscanning of your pc every night. 

Let's get those fucking assholes !!
