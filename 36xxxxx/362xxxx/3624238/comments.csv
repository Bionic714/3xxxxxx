,morsil88,2007-02-22T14:16Z,Why shuld i download this instead if the .iso?
,Delichris,2007-02-22T15:15Z,"This is smaller,isn't it obvious?You'll download it faster."
,Delichris,2007-02-22T15:17Z,"This file is compressed,morsil88.Don't make n00b comments."
,Delichris,2007-02-22T15:26Z,"You can find software to open the Rar archive at:

http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm

It may be shareware,but the trial version will do the work just fine."
,raspoutinolaf,2007-02-22T15:39Z,Does it have french subtitles ?
,Delichris,2007-02-22T15:45Z,"No,it does not have french subtitles,unfortunately."
,0megear,2007-02-22T16:42Z,"This is fake ?
It can't be PAL if there is no EUROPEAN SUBTITLES (FR/IT/DE..)"
,Delichris,2007-02-22T17:03Z,"This is the true FFXII image,0megear,but there are no subtitles of other langs in the game.This could be Square-Enix's miss,or I just haven't found where you can adjust it(unlikely)."
,0megear,2007-02-22T17:14Z,"Check out in the ""Config"" menu, please, and tell us."
,Delichris,2007-02-22T17:23Z,"I have already checked the 'config' command,but found only a yes/no setting for subs.That's why I said it's unlikely."
,scribble,2007-02-23T08:31Z,"can someone please start seeding?!

,Delichris,2007-02-23T19:07Z,"Sorry for not seeding,but I have another torrent to tend to.I will resume seeding in 1-2 days."

,Axltherudiepal,2007-02-27T21:44Z,"Anyone tried this with PCX2 or other emulator?
does it work?"
,Delichris,2007-02-28T19:05Z,"I have tested it with PCSX2 myself,but it doesn't seem to work well on my computer(2.6 GHz Pentium4 proc.,512 MB Ram,NVidia GeForce FX 5200 with 128 MB VideoRAM graphics card).At least it works(I've only tested it up to the New Game options screen)."
,Delichris,2007-03-02T15:54Z,"I will soon delete this file from my computer,so reseed please."
,Delichris,2007-03-04T20:50Z,"If you'd like to know,I've uploaded another game's PAL english version,this time it is Okami.

,mewran,2007-03-06T17:39Z,"Umh, i downloaded it, mounted the iso file with daemon tools. Then it got to this folder with loads of shitfiles, could someone help me out and tellme what kind of misstake i did?"
,mewran,2007-03-06T17:48Z,Or is this just a ps2 game?
,Delichris,2007-03-06T21:23Z,"This is a PS2 game.Did you mistake it for a PC game,mewran?Just burn it to a DVD and use it in your PS2(if you have one). "
,Delichris,2007-03-07T20:30Z,"I've uploaded another PS2 game,Disgaea.If you haven't ever played it,you should have a shot at this great game.

So a simple A to B .. This dosent work at PC ? you need PS2 Consol to play this gr8 game :("
,Delichris,2007-03-15T15:49Z,"Well,what I meant was that it was ""running"" slowly,but if you have a faster system,you will be able to play it much better.I didn't test it in depth though."
,lordkhan,2007-03-22T20:13Z,Well your PC will never be able to run it at a good speed. Needs to have a good dual core cpu ;)
,Delichris,2007-03-22T23:09Z,I know ;)
,rl_Icewolf,2007-07-13T10:18Z,anyone still seeding by chance? stuck at 62.6% with 3 other peers it seems
