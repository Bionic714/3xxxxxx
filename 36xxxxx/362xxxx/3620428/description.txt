The 96-page comic adaptation by Miles Lane and Doug Wheatley (Star Wars Empire, Superman, and The Incredible Hulk, among others) is attractive but obviously has to take some short cuts from the 137-minute film. The action scenes also are less dramatic than the Clone Wars graphic novel series. But it's a coup that this adaptation includes a late Yoda scene that was not in the film but is already rumored to be an extra on the inevitable DVD.
