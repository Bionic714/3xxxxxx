,robinson67,2008-05-30T21:41Z,to mount with daemon tools you need to install a virtual room......or answer me directly to mrv679@hotmail.com..and i help you

,nokken1337,2008-09-08T22:07Z,Seed please ! need it tonight xD
,vetlelg,2009-05-30T10:28Z,Please keep seeding. I'm downloading it atm and need more seeding. I've been downloading it for almost 12 hours i think and I'm at approximately 50%.
,vetlelg,2009-05-30T10:48Z,"One more question. With Nvidia GeForce 9600
4GB RAM
But only Intel Core 2 Duo T5800 processor with 2.0GHz.
Think it will work on highest system requirements?
(In addition I wanna say that today's laptops doesn't really have processors which is up to date tbh. Best processor I?ve ever seen on a laptop is 2.8GHz. It's ridiculous."
,vetlelg,2009-05-30T22:32Z,"THIS IS WHAT TO DO:

1. Download the torrent.
2. Launch the rar. file in winrar or similar programs, which you can freely download by google-searching.
3. Launch the new iso. file in deamon tools or similar programs, which you can freely download by google searching once again.
4. Install the game.
5. Do not run the game at this moment. Now you got to copy the no cd crack file which you got when extracting the file in winrar. Then paste it into the game folder. (The one you got when you installed the game. You may have browsed it anywhere on your computer. If not, it's probably inside program files somewhere).
6. Now simply launch the file which you just copied and pasted.

7. ENJOY!"
,bobbybigdaddy,2009-06-10T21:25Z,"where is the no cd crack? these are the only things that were there:

""mycd.iso""      ""Warhammer.exe""   and 
                                             ""please read install""

please answer back. it took me two and a half days to download this and I really want to play it."
,FANFANFANRalle,2009-07-07T16:51Z,"Please seed more, ETA 13 hours!"
,trickyhall,2009-08-24T10:51Z,pls seed guys
,lareth,2009-12-28T13:02Z,"Didn't work for me.

Unrarred it.

Mounted ISO on Daemon.

Installed game.

Took the Unrarred Warhammer.exe and overwrote the one on the installation.

Gave me an error saying 

""The system cannot find the specified path.""

I've tried this over and over again, and done all the steps, tried improvising, and nothing, always the same error, so it doesn't work, for me, simple as that. Not worth downloading."
,lareth,2009-12-28T13:15Z,"AND added to that; 

I kept the old Warhammer.exe and it keps wanting the CD (obviously). 

The error I get is only with the crack, so I'd presume the problem is with the crack then.. Hopefully, as that should be easy to mend."
,alexaras1313,2010-09-03T01:55Z,pls seed i am stuck at 21.8%
,ehabnaji,2011-04-13T04:33Z,"i will seed but how ?
