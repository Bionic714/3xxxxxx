,pitbull.,2007-02-21T08:14Z,"well it has plenty of awards but you are missing one thing, 
WHAT THE FUCK IS IT ABOUT!!!!"
,the Bear,2007-02-21T14:28Z,"if i'm not wrong it's Joel Bakan's book The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power...

about the abuse of the modern industrial era by corporations to pursue profit and power, damn everything else, including people, lives, planet earth...

everything is sacrificed for profit.. the sheer madness of it all.. "
,machbar,2007-02-23T06:05Z,"THE CORPORATION is a witty, disturbing portrait of the dominant institution of our time. Taking its legal status as a ""person"" to its logical conclusion, the film puts the corporation on the psychiatrist's couch to ask: ""What kind of person is it?"" THE CORPORATION exposes the consequences?for human beings, democracy, and our environment?of granting immense power to a structurally amoral institution whose priority is profit. THE CORPORATION includes 40 interviews with corporate insiders and critics plus case studies, true confessions, and strategies for change. 

IF YOU SUPPORT THE FILM, SUPPORT THE FILMMAKERS  

Filmmaker Mark Achbar explains: ""According to bittorent trackers and making conservative extrapolations for other P2P file sharing mechanisms, over  500,000 people have downloaded The Corporation so far. As a filmmaker and activist, one of my goals is to reach the largest possible audience. So from that perspective, it's an astounding success. But I also organized the financing of the film and have continuing obligations.""

?Over 200 people worked on making the film and getting it seen. Our outreach efforts are ongoing. Please consider using the ""contribute"" button on www.thecorporation.com or send a cheque or money order, large or small, to:  Big Picture Media Corporation*, 2676 Eton St., Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5K 1K1. Thanks!?

* Yes, it's ironic. I formed a small corporation to qualify for public funding in Canada.
