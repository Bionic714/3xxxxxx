,ThePalindorme,2010-04-22T17:36Z,"somethings not right, this torrent got deleted from kickasstorrents and my torrent client is not picking up any seeds. Dudes, be careful."
,dlarrym,2010-06-19T19:40Z,"@arneblommaer: 
Not to ust your balls, However, my knowledge of Dutch, not perfect by any means but I have some knowledge of Dutch. In any case, this is how I read your ""DUTCH"" back to English and it went like this - (Quote) "" thus yes , know thou then whether yonder Englishwoman whether Dutch subset Irishman until existence? p elderly until the movie star!""(Un Quote). It may be a sub dialect that I am clueless of. Just was curious of the meaning?? Its all good what ever it means.
