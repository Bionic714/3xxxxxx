Fortsätter seeda tills vi är minst 2-3 stycken =)"
,nukezone,2007-02-28T16:42Z,tackar för en super uppload sedar länge lovar
,sal,2007-03-01T13:30Z,"noone has ripped this to dvd5 as yet,it has been ripped to muliple dvd5's though but,a lot still had trouble.

so i would ask the uploader this:
""does this work through the game past the 10th chapter?""

if it crash's when you load the 7th chapter it is the same as the other dvd5 that was released.
:-)"
,Stars05,2007-03-01T22:39Z,"It is NOT supposed to crash beyond chapter 10 as far as i know. Alas, I have not tried this myself so I can not guarantee it. But I was told that BOTH layers of the disc shall be playable after ripping it like I did.

So if you only have on DVD to spare - wait untill someone can confirm this."
,Stars05,2007-03-03T09:01Z,"Rapportera gärna här om det fungerar för dig =)

Report back if you are able to run this game =)"
,lokostill,2007-03-04T09:10Z,"Works with HDloader, no modes.  Works past the end of chap 7 freeze!  "
,Stars05,2007-03-05T21:51Z,"Good =)
Keep playing!"
,venoom,2007-03-05T23:44Z,Doesn't seem to work for me... Nothing happens when I put the disc in my ps2. And I burned it using DVD Decrypter at 4x speed.
,Balunan,2007-03-06T18:08Z,"Thank you, works just fine. :)

But..just wondering, is it supposed to load when u press the triangle and enter the menu, during gameplay? It's just a split second.. But it makes me wonder if my disc sucks and I should use DVD-Rs from another brand.. Do u experience small loading times aswell when u enter the menu during gameplay? The music plays and then suddenly stops aswell. And starts again when I exit the menu.."
,Stars05,2007-03-07T21:58Z,"I am not expericing any loading times or stops in the music at all. So you should either try burning with another media and slower. Try 1x.
Tell me if it works =)"
,Stars05,2007-03-12T10:15Z,It's in english (NTSC).
,ibenine,2007-03-17T22:12Z,Can someone confirm that the game works beyond chapter 7?

,elektromodulator,2007-07-03T19:55Z,"What has been deleted to fit this into a single layer? The comment says something about the credits, but I can't speak swedish. :("
,koboggyn,2008-01-01T09:53Z,has anyone tried playing this game using a ps2  emulator like pcsx2 or anything else like that?
