,Taztey,2007-02-20T21:32Z,"I'm 17 years old and from Sweden. I'm pretty good at english but an average guy in eighth grade (That will say a guy who's 14 years old) from Sweden should be able to understand an episode of Heroes.  
So I don't know why they're so eeger about Swedish subtitle. But I usually download subtitles if available just so I can read if I don't here a word or so. "
,val,2007-02-20T23:46Z,"I can understand why people would want subs.
Yeah, swedish schools start teaching english in 3rd grade, and you are _supposed_ to be able to understand english communication without repetitions at 8th-9th grade. 
But this haven't always been, I know that my parents didn't start studying english until they where in 7th grade. And far from everyone in sweden who knows how to download things with piratebay and BT (which is really easy and nice :-)) are 17 year old people who care about the english language.

I just wish the people teaching them to download things would also show them how to get a player that can show subs from an external file (my guess is that they want it rendered on the movie-file).

Why the makority of people asking for subs are swedish I have no idea about, might be a remnant from when piratebay was mostly known by swedes rather than the whole world."
,efogstrando,2007-02-21T16:27Z,when will episode 17 come out?
,orderedchaos,2007-02-23T04:44Z,"The show airs every Monday night in the U.S., so I'd guess Ep 17 (and subsequent episodes) will be available late Monday or early Tuesday. "
