Galleren-Asterix is a fraud who seeks to take credit for OTHER peoples work, at least i thank the teams behind the upload, galleren-asterix just takes credit.. I wish he would keep his business away from private trackers and stay here on PirateBay, the place for newbies.. And upload the original with org nfo from Team QTX WHO IS BEHIND THIS UPLOAD, THANKS TO THEM NOT, TO GALLEREN-ASTERIX, CAN WE NOW ENJOY THE SILENCE NO MORE!"
,parlyzone,2007-02-21T14:06Z,Here is the original release without fake attempts to take credit: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3619764/VolBeat_-_Rock_The_Rebel___Metal_The_Devil

,luffelej,2007-05-24T11:20Z,"parlyzone: ""Galleren-Asterix is a fraud who seeks to take credit for OTHER peoples work, at least i thank the teams behind the upload"" , 
i suggest you and Team QTX thank team VOLBEAT for recording this album for you to steal.
Dont take credit from them and instead you should go buy their two records so they can keep it up as a band."
