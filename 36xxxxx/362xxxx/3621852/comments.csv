,Kaptennpim,2007-04-08T02:36Z,"this is a NTSC, that might be the reason. Looks like wiikey doesnt support this game..."

,berrun,2008-10-20T08:06Z,This game requires a program called GOD/WOD to unrar it properly. I unrared the game as normal and burnt it out in imgburn but it did not run so I read the information that came with it and it mentioned that program. Goodluck to anyone finding it as I have looked everwhere.
