If you got bandwidth problems use distributed tracking, but stop that crap!"

,Ju-ju,2007-02-27T23:30Z,"Hi
Sorry, have a few questions for those who are better at computers than I am
Im trying to download films and tv series, it take ages and most of the time I only get the sound and no picture! What am I doing wrong? Once it worked though. Second question; maybe a bit stupid but... how do I ""seed""? I dont want to leech but Im not sure where in my computer I have to put things for others to find em... Thanx a lot!"
,Grimpen,2007-02-28T06:40Z,"JuJu: Slow downloads could be caused by being behind a router.
I'd recommend getting started by reading up at Slyck:
http://www.slyck.com/bt.php
Playback issues could be related to the codec used to encode the video, usually Xvid or DivX.  Try a player such as VLC which includes just about everything you need:

Good Luck.
kolll:  Thanks for the Torrent!"

,blake9999,2007-03-03T06:30Z,"Something wrong with this copy. Audio and video freezes every few seconds. tried it with several players ( including VLC) and 3 different computers.
All my codecs are updated so i'm wondering if it's the encoding used."
