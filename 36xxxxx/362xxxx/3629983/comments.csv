,conjure,2007-06-25T07:45Z,"Hi. Is it possible for an original seeder to jump on for a short period of time and let us all finish this torrent.

I'm stuck at 99.8% as I believe the other 6 - 8 seeders are.

All we need is that tiny chunk and we will be ok.

Cheers"

Cheers to anyone who sees this and obliges!"
,Kinsohinta,2007-08-05T00:26Z,Thanks to who ever seeded but I'm stuck at 96%! I'm almost there so can someone please seed? 
,FD3Sman,2007-10-31T03:32Z,"I NEED HELP.
AM I SUPPOSE TO BURN THIS TORRENT TO A CD AND PUT IT IN MY PS@???


i really want to know how to play it, what do i do, do i have to download a program or something???"
,Enzainer,2007-12-11T08:01Z,"You need a modchip to be able to play this. To burn it you will need win rar extract it to a IMG. file(havent dled in quite some time so im going off memory) I myself havent gotten it to work(no mod chip) but i have gotten the beginning movie with the ps2 emulator on my computer. Oh and this WILL NOT play on a ps3. tried that : P

,Timmah603,2008-12-22T13:56Z,"First of all, I see this torrent is so old that you may not know this, but to play this on a PS2 you do NOT NEED A MOD CHIP!  You do need a way to get an exploit to a memory card, such as a Gameshark 2 v1.3, but no chip.  Go to exploitstation.com and look for the thread by slicer74 on the topic.  Oh, and thank you to the u/l hopefully it stays seeded cause I have been wanting this forever and cant find it, and as I exploit from my hdd I wont need to burn or anything so a BIG thanks."
