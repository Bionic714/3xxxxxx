In this American special, Jeremy, James and Richard are on a fly-drive holiday with a difference. Instead of hiring a car, each has to buy a car for no more than $1000. Starting from Miami, they set out on an 800-mile road trip to New Orleans via Alabama - where they find time to annoy the locals - and Mississippi. As usual, there will be some Top Gear challenges along the way; a meeting with Stig's hillbilly cousin and a lesson in cooking roadkill.

Another Porsche hits Top Gear, but will Jeremy be able to tell the difference between this new 911 Turbo and the old one? Whilst Stig plays with a Brabus-tuned Mercedes SL with a staggering 720bhp, James and Richard try to turn a Reliant Robin into a space shuttle. One small step for a small man etc...
