,JANHUBERT,2007-02-19T20:38Z,What type of files are that?
,lawin,2007-02-19T20:58Z,How do you listen to it?
,JANHUBERT,2007-02-19T21:23Z,Open the files with WINRAR and rename them to mp3.
,BlackCat944T,2007-02-20T14:02Z,"Sorry about that.... I don't know how that happened (re: the file type)

Anyhow... you can go to your command promt, cd (change directory) to the location of each disc and type ""ren *.* *.mp3""

This means... 'REName' all files in the directory with the same name and extension of .mp3

I hope this helps... Thanks"
,BlackCat944T,2007-02-20T14:03Z,"Sorry about that.... I don't know how that happened (re: the file type)

,magician2000,2007-02-20T14:53Z,"The collection is very nice, however after changing the file extension to .mp3, the files are only ripped to 96Kbs, it has a sound like listening to an old AM radio. All the files are there, but the quality of the Rip is barely above that of an old cassette player."
,BlackCat944T,2007-02-20T23:59Z,"Up untill the mid 80's CDs did not exist, let alone recording originals in digital formats.

The bulk of these recordings are from Analog masters and even the remastered CDs have limitations, since you can't re-record an Analog recording and expect it to get better.... in actuality ""better"" means being able to hear all the imperfections.... a good example of this is.... Led Zeppelin... I can't remember the track, but on a few songs you can hear John Bonams squeaky pedal on the bass and in another song you can hear a phone ring.

Anyhow, these CDs were encoded using a retail version of Nero's mp3 Pro.... Promising quality without the added space.

I will try to re-encode them in the future, so look out for another torrent ;)

What program would you suggest ?
Maybe you can tell what song in particular you would like to hear at a higher bit rate, then you can see if there is an actual difference.

IMHO... I convert Vinyl LPs and 45's to CDs.... nothing beats a huge wave file :)"
,andrejm,2007-02-23T18:42Z,"Hi guys...i did what BlackCat said, and it worked perfectly...the sound quality is very good at winamp player. 
thanks a lot!"
,BlackCat944T,2007-03-01T20:25Z,No Problems Man... I'm glad you understand ;)
,Annajohanne,2007-03-09T22:53Z,thank u so mutch!
,berlingo,2007-04-02T07:36Z,"hur gör jag för att kunna spela in dom här skivorna med Nero ? Kan lyssna på låtarna en och en i Windows mediaplayer, men vill ha dom på cd.
Tacksam för hjälp och råd."
,10Kfists,2007-04-02T21:42Z,"how do you do the thing blackcat944t said where you change the file type, what do i go to on the computer to change it? how do you get to the command prompt?"
,BlackCat944T,2007-04-04T22:58Z,"to get to the command prompt...

Click start....goto run....
and type....

cmd 

hit enter.... you will be defaulted to... C:\Documents and Settings\User\>

from there you Change Directory (CD) to where ever you extracted the files... once you get there, follow the previuos instructions ;)"
,BlackCat944T,2007-04-04T23:00Z,"PREVIOUS DIRECTIONS ;)

Anyhow... after you extract all the files, you can go to your command promt, cd (change directory) to the location of each disc and type ""ren *.* *.mp3"" 


This means... 'REName' all files in the directory with the same name and extension of .mp3 


I hope this helps... Thanks

,10Kfists,2007-04-05T16:42Z,thank you very much
,10Kfists,2007-04-05T16:52Z,"shoot, it didn't work, i think i screwed up on the CD thing, i couldnt figure out what to write"
,berlingo,2007-04-05T20:35Z,Någon som kan förklara på svenska ??
,BlackCat944T,2007-04-11T21:47Z,"When you people extract the file....

Choose something simple, for example, extract the file to:

c:\stones

then it wont matter from where you type:

cd\
cd stones

then you can take a directory listing:

dir

this will list the other directories created, and from there you would use the cd command again to enter those directories.

Finally, from each of those directories is where you would use the rename command....  ren

you can all reread my previous instructions."
,beow123,2007-07-26T08:22Z,"On linux, go to each Disc directory and run
$ for i in *; do mv ""$i"" ""$i.mp3""; done
and all files are renamed with right ending."
,big_chikz,2007-09-21T20:15Z,Thank you! Works great :)
,Wopatoolie,2007-09-29T19:04Z,how bout u re-do ur torrent the right way so that more than 2 in 10 people can figure it out. this would be a great collection to dload n seed if u knew wtf u were doing bfore u posted it
,Pkshadow,2007-10-02T10:58Z,"Is ""EASY"" guys!
If can not figure it out just go to the folder where extracted the files and ""Right Click"" then ""Rename""
then ""Right Arrow Key"" and then Type "" .mp3 "" and then click any place in the folder.
Yes it is a chore or there are plenty of mp3 programs that do mass renames."
,Pkshadow,2007-10-02T11:01Z,Of yea and quality is not bad using alternative old media player and Realtek HD Audio Equalizer.
,wennZone,2008-10-23T03:44Z,"All you guys are suck,,,, its simple don't make things complicated, Follow the instruction of Pkshadows... Very simple,,

Regards Great upload.."
,rh1327,2009-01-28T02:34Z,I'm sorry I finally just finished downloading this and I am not understanding how to listen to it.  I have a Mac so I can't follow the instructions that you have posted.  Is there any way that I can make it listenable on a Mac?  Thanks.
,emillo108,2011-01-10T18:43Z,"I don't know the fast way to change the file type on a mac, but just type .mp3 after the filename, then click 'add' if asked. Repeat this for all the files."
