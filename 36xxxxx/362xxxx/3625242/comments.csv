,AgentX,2007-02-23T22:51Z,Did you manage to get a somewhat seamless loop? :)
,Donnydad,2007-02-23T22:58Z,"unfortunately with live video that is next to impossible. I was more going for something more interesting than the samples from MS. 
The beach and rain are more of stationary camera, so the loop out isn't catastrophic but you can certainly tell when the loop happens. I hope you guys enjoy it."
,AgentX,2007-02-23T23:28Z,"You can try to copy the video and pasting it inverted/backwards after the first. 
With somewhat stationary scenes, like it should be with dreamscenes, it might work if the content is not too short.

Great effort though, keep it up :)"
,bane021,2007-02-26T17:44Z,wallpapers in mpeg format? am i missing something?
,Donnydad,2007-02-26T22:46Z,"the new vista ultimate dream scene extra plays video wallpaper in mpg or wmv format only.
unfortunately there is very little video out there and what samples there are, are very low resolution to keep the size of them small. "
,runkill.com,2007-02-27T05:06Z,I need a way to install this in businees edition. There has to be a work around.
,Donnydad,2007-02-27T20:28Z,"As of yet, MS has only made ""extras"" available in the windows update for the Ultimate edition, its there way of encouraging people to buy a bloated overpriced operating system that few of us really need. :P"
,grabbitbahr,2007-03-31T20:28Z,my dream scenes only plays .wmv and wn't play .mpg anybody have this problem or a fix
,Donnydad,2007-04-08T09:52Z,"It is possible that you do not have an Mpeg2 codec installed.
Try installing dvd software like PowerDVD or Intervideo WinDVD or just looking for a codec such as Stinkys Mpeg2 installer."
