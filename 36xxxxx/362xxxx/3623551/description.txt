Here is David Lynch's brilliant masterpiece, Eraserhead. Shot in black and white, this film is very gritty, dark, and sometimes disturbing.

****** WARNING *******

If you are NOT a fan of extremely bizarre cult films, don't waste your time downloading this film, as you will probably watch the first 30 minutes and go, "what the FUCK is this???"

For those of you that can appreciate the true genius and vision this film brings to the viewer, it is indeed a MUST SEE. This is one of my all time favorite films, and I ripped it from the full DvD. Included are the extras, including a film interview with David Lynch, and extra trailers not released.

Enjoy, and as always, SEED, SEED, SEED!
