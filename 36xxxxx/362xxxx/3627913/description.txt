Extracting Information:
 "Here it is, episode 12.  I have re-assembled
 this is what appears to be the correct order -
 the original episode as recorded from ABC.com
 appears to be edited incorrectly - it doesn't
 make sense and reveals things at the wrong time.
 Based on much web discussion and a little common
 sense, I re-edited the parts.  Enjoy!"

 "I dig a screen grab using SnapzPro (OS X) sing
 DVCPRO50, then edited and converted to divx."

 "Just FYI, the reason I used divx instead of xvid
 was that divx was the only one that was playing
 nice with the DVCPRO codec at that frame size.
 Xvid kept screwing up the dimensions or the pixel
 aspect for some reason."

 "Doing the cap takes a lot of system resources,
 and the results are best when I leave it alone
 while it caps... that said though I can't leave
 it completely alone because you have to click
 'continue' after each commercial break - so if I
 walk away the file would get HUGE, fill the
 drive, and fail. Which boils down to: I need
 45-50 minutes of free time to babysit while it
 captures, but my computer ALSO has to be
 completely free for that time..."
