,theduke84,2007-03-03T12:47Z,"Still waiting for my source but abc.com is slow(many people) and the rip will be bad. When it dies down, he said that he will rip it(good quality)

Not there this morning but maybe this afternoon. 
I will seed it for sure for all the Day Break fan.
At least, it's on abc.com so we know it exist. :D"
