On the day of January 23,1977-the greatest event in the history of the world would change the format landscape of television as we know it. Even after years later,it still to this day holds the title of one of the best television mini-series of all time.

Under the usual definition of a "series",ROOTS would not be included as a made for television movie-it was really an extended special. But in fact that it was the most-watched dramatic special in the history of television,and its considerable impact on its viewers was outstanding. The overall success of ROOTS was unprecedented. Approxiamately over 100 million viewers saw the concluding installment and it must be considered an event of considerable magnitude when nearly half of the entire population of the United States can be assembled in front of its television sets to watch a single dramatic presentation. No one,not even ABC,was prepared for anything this big. In fact,one of the reasons given for scheduling ROOTS on eight consecutive nights was that if it were a flop it would be over with quickly. But it wasn't. It became a tidalwave of a hit. And America was watching.
