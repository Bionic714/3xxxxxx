I hope 4 and 6 are ok.. thanks again"
,wankan,2007-02-17T22:48Z,"2 currently has 8 seeds in the swarm and I can see 8 peers .

4 has 6 seeders that I can see and 16 peers .

You'll be okay with 6 as I'll be seeding that on the 20th .

If anyone can help stragglers I'm sure they would be appreciative .

,wankan,2007-02-19T14:14Z,"I'm trying to upload the final torrent which was part of episode 1's torrent and thepiratebay is saying ""invalid tracker"" , so won't let me upload it . 

What's that about , anyone know ??

The trackers in ep6  torrent are the same ie:
http://tracker.prq.to/announce and http://tpb.tracker.prq.to/announce .

Can't I use these any longer ??????

Help !"
,wankan,2007-02-19T14:34Z,I just started upping ep6 for a couple of minutes to see it the trackers are valid and they both work and I got peers connecting . Yet I can't upload the torrent onto the bay and dht isn't on . WTF is happening ? I've tried contacting Admin to see if they know . Looks like I may have to create a new torrent for episode 6 if I don't get a reply from anyone before tomorrow as I still intend to seed then .
,wankan,2007-02-19T15:43Z,"Well I tried the ""Contact Us"" link at the bottom of the page to ask Admin and the message merely bounced back to my email address as the contact link goes to nobody@localhost.prq.se (a little useless perhaps ?) .

So looks like I'll have to create a new torrent for ep 6 using http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce as the tracker ."

,wankan,2007-02-21T13:02Z,The quality of these divx's are imo very watchable so are sufficient for my needs . With the crap isp I have it would take me too long to down multiple dvd's . Kind offer though . Thanks Raggaty .
