NOT the reggae singer-this Bob Marley is the comedian from Maine.  He's had several CDs of his stand up, 3 DVDs, and bit parts in a few movies, including Boondock Saints.  These first few albums are hilarious if you're familiar with Maine at all, but they're also pretty damn funny if you're not.  I'd say he's one of the best stand up comedians working today.
Give it a try-if there's any interest, I have quite a few more of his albums.
