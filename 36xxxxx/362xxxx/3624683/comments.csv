,sscsr1,2009-01-18T23:33Z,Did anyone ever get past the 97% ?
,brimack67,2012-08-29T04:36Z,"It's still stuck at 97.3% almost 5 years after it was uploaded so it's obviously never going to complete. That said it still plays fine in vlc player or kmplayer or mediaplayer classic on any pc. It will just have a few tiny 'burps' here and there where the missing 3% is, which only amounts to a few seconds anyway."
