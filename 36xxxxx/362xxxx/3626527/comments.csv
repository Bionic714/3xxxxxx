,dreddhk,2007-02-26T15:37Z,"Hi there - some of you may be having installation problems with this thing on Vista - heres how you get to your local settings folder ... open my computer -> right click ""C"" -> select propoties -> security -> advanced -> owner -> edit -> click [name] of who you want to give permision to (your user name!!) -> check the box [] Replace owner on subcontainers and objects ... click apply. Vista will hold on to a couple of things (like the hibination file) but when it's done, you will now ""own"" your own pc ... which is nice! - hope this helps any Vista Users."
,nodo,2007-02-26T19:51Z,"ok!
ihave installed the
emailadress: stupidnodo@noobcity.com 
and
serialnumber: 666
but it still dont work.
maybe its maj yojstick"
,EDVN,2007-02-26T20:54Z,"nodo
please read the ""read me"" in the folder ""crack""

1. go to C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp
2. start the Helgoland installer
3. select a language
4. go back to the 'Temp' folder. two new directories will have been created. open the one at the bottom.
5. inside you will see two files and one folder. open that folder.
6. copy the 'ascrypt.dll' from the 'crack' folder to that folder you just opened.
7. now proceed with the installer and leave all the registration fields open :-)

Viel Spass"

A bit tricky to install due to the temp-folders... ""Which one is it ...?"" but who tries will succeed ! I did, and its really good scenery."

,dbuster,2007-05-28T14:55Z,"My crack does not work in Vista  Ultimate. I started the installer and chose a laguage. Then I went to the Temp folder and open a directory. It had 4 files and 1 folder. I opened the folder, pasted the crack but it still was asking me for a serial and e-mail adress! Any help would be much appreciated"
,bjorne83,2007-06-28T19:17Z,"for oss som har Windows Vista hvor finner man denne mappen som det skrives om i crack readme fila?
kan noen gi med den eksakte sti til å finne disse mappene??
Håper noen kan hjelpe meg"
,bjorne83,2007-06-28T19:24Z,finner ingen nye mapper under den stien. å i vista er det ikke dokument and settings. bare brukere. men her kommer det ikke inn noen ny mappe. va skal mappa hete så det kanskje går ann å søke etter den?
,pilot_eb_red,2008-04-02T20:42Z,pliizz seed ;) thx
,dotcomvictom,2008-06-02T00:54Z,"Thanks 4X-AXG, U R THE MAN!!! I just discovered your treasure chest of FS. I will gladly seed your stuff until I drop 

unless you advise otherwise, but first I need a little seeding help from your loyal followers.

Thanks soo much for the great upload :)> 

BTW, can anyone suggest where I can purchase some used HW (peddles, etc..) to play these little gems more efficently?"
,mkaimer1,2008-08-30T17:41Z,"PLEASE!!! I need help! What´s the name of the two new directories? I can´t find them Would be very nice, if anybody writes an answer :)"
,ESA1178,2008-12-02T18:13Z,"OK, I'm no dummy and can follow directions. I have VISTA and downloaded the torrent into a temp folder. I see the CRACK folder along with the readme.txt. In the CRACK folder is ascrypt.dll and readme. When I run the installer and choose language  there is no new folder created, everything remains the same. Then I get the: ""I am sorry. but the serial number (or email address) you provided is wrong."" I am following the directions to the letter. Am I missing something?"
