,emoless,2007-02-26T21:52Z,"Haha guys, It's the real deal, I pre-loaded the game from fileplanet since I'm a subscriber and already wrote all info here,and. 
As soon as the file got unlocked I pressed the upload button! Enjoy!"

,Gambit_2K,2007-02-26T22:09Z,"Typical! Im getting a dx9 error when i try to start the demo. I tried to download the newest version of DX9 but it says I already have the newest version.

Conclusion, it's Vista that's stopping me =/

,lordsearry,2007-02-26T22:29Z,Check that you have driect draw on.
,Jiimpa_,2007-02-26T22:42Z,"OMG, Please seed!  I'll continue to seed when i've downloaded it (I have 24 mb/s).
//Jimmie"
,Gambit_2K,2007-02-26T22:50Z,"I got it working in Vista, I just downloaded DX9 instead of using thw webinstall that MS want's you to use.

Im seeding @ 3,3 mb/s"

,Jiimpa_,2007-02-26T23:53Z,"can someone help me.. i get the message ""This is not a valid Win32-program.""
What should i do?"
,slackern78,2007-02-27T00:01Z,"Not sure but sounds like it got corrupted or something, if you can maybe you have a option in your torrent software to recheck the downloaded files to see that they are correct, utorrent has this option."
,-OLDBOY-,2007-02-27T00:23Z,"I have now played for about an hour, and its great, i love it! G2g play again :D"
,chevron,2007-02-27T00:37Z,"Come on people, SEED! uTorrent reports over 4000 peers (was 1500 a long time ago) and only 78 seeders (was only 6 some time ago) and it took me almost 3hrs to download. So quit beeing so selfish and seed until you reach a ratio of 1.0!"
,emoless,2007-02-27T00:42Z,"chevron
People do seed, they just haven't had the time to download the whole file yet..

The torrent is only 3 hours old, have patience =)"
,freakBYnature,2007-02-27T00:44Z,Demo? You suck! Get the whole game and seed that instead... I can get the demo anywhere else!
,empis,2007-02-27T00:49Z,"Helping u guys with seeding, i have a 100/100Mbit connection SE located! :)"
,emoless,2007-02-27T00:51Z,"freakBYnature

Shut the fuck up, if you don't want this, then don't download it.

Just so you know, the demo was exclusive for fileplanet subscribers, and I uploaded it here the second it was released, and nobody else except subscribers could download it, and about one hour AFTER that i uploaded the demo here, you could find the demo on other sites besides Fileplanet.

Plus, the full game isn't out yet and all the sites are almost dead from the heavy trafic."
,Geraldoaj,2007-02-27T01:15Z,"I give up
The FREE public server from fileplanet is much more faster than this CAUSE PEOPLE DON`T SEED!!!"
,JamesDeane,2007-02-27T01:43Z,"I'd love to download this but I keep getting ""connection close by peer"" in the tracker status of utorrent."
,slackern78,2007-02-27T02:35Z,Bah hotlinking not working but copy/paste it :)
,Soondead,2007-02-27T06:34Z,"ppl who complain this is just the demo... you know, some people actually take a general interest in computer games, not just the ""0-day leet warezzz""

If you don't like it, then move on with your life. Quietly please. "
[T],Knaster,2007-02-27T07:04Z,Hey BoeingX F***** moron this game will be the game of the year and the demo ROCKS so shut the fuck up

,-OLDBOY-,2007-02-28T12:39Z,"FreakBYnature, you obviously don't understand this thing with the demo. This is a game who we fans of C&C have waited for so many years, and can't wait to play the game. Apparenly you are no fan of C&C, so stfu..."
,shawnrc,2007-02-28T16:55Z,"FreakBYnature, guess you will go see a movie without even seeing a trailer, just becuase its made/produced by someone you know. Naiv."

Yes man, I have the same problem, but it seems like most dont...I gonna try another file..."
,-OLDBOY-,2007-03-02T01:27Z,"The games in the Tiberium universe is the best ones. This far Tiberian Sun is the best one. Strikenight, is that true :P Ill try :)"
,-OLDBOY-,2007-03-02T01:35Z,"it worked, thanks for the tip Strikenight :)"
,Devirune,2007-03-02T13:21Z,well i aint a huge fan of C&C but ill say this looks great and well i base this on how many that seeds that this is the best Strategy Game so far from C&C

,Jompizzz,2007-03-04T15:21Z,Can't wait for the real release :|| I'm ashamed.. But i have been thinking of  actually buying this game.
,-OLDBOY-,2007-03-04T15:49Z,"I have already pre-ordered, Kane edition. "
,MadMagz,2007-03-04T20:40Z,"Too bad there is no Scrin edition (the alien race, you know). What's the diff between the editions anyways? There's a campaign for each side, but no Scrin edition, that must mean that you can play all faction on one single dvd, right? =/"
,skeppstroll,2007-03-05T05:39Z,"Thanks for upload:)
Will definatly buy this once in stores.

But there are a few annoying bugs in this demo, but i assume it has been taken care of before it hits the stores. "

Yes, yes and yes i totally understand and furthermore you shouldnt feel so guilty because you ""like"" BoingX, you can be fuck buddies for all i care but i wonder why did you post a comment at all since you apparently don't like demo's!"
,fallguy1970,2007-03-05T10:53Z,"I just tried the demo and it is awesome. Not to demanding either. I have a 3.2ghz prescott 2gb of ram and 7800gt and I am running ultra high.

Can't wait for the whole game !"
,-OLDBOY-,2007-03-05T12:29Z,"MadMagz: Of course you will be able to play as Scrin wether you buy Kane edition or the original one. There are only those 2 versions. Kane edition is only a Collectors Edition, with another name, and is exacly the same as the other one except that with  Kane ed. You get ""Deleted scenes"" ""Makin of"", a couple of maps and so on."
,thimiesama,2007-03-05T16:12Z,BEST....GAME.....EVER!!!!!!!:D

For those that asked, the full game ships worldwide on the 26th of this month."
,Tranceallstars,2007-03-11T22:58Z,The Game reminds me of Red Alert 2 and Tiberin Sun but has a much better graphic.
,Acid-Kun,2007-03-18T17:45Z,omg INTERNET FIGHT! just stfu or talk about something less immature

,Mirshann,2007-03-26T12:40Z,"Tried the Demo, and imo it's just new graphs to the old games =/ Didn't find any extraordinary new content..

Although, the game is a classic. And with new graphics it's going to the collection i guess =)"
