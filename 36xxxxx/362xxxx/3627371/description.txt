Star Trek: Beyond the Final Frontier Summary

For forty years Star Trek has engrossed our imaginations and sent us on
voyages across the galaxy. Through ten films and five series this
entertainment juggernaut has become a pop culture icon and a window to our
society. We will look at the impact that Star Trek has had on fans around the
world. From the conventions in Europe and Las Vegas to the billionaire
collector who scours the world for memorabilia, we will try to find out just
what it is about this supposedly 'silly' series that has meant so much to so
many. Leonard Nimoy hosts.

Features interviews with many cast members: Uhura, Sulu, Picard, Riker, Troy,
Janeway, Sisko, Quark.
Also many of the production team: Braga, Berman, Okuda etc.
Ends on a hint that Star Trek will be back in the future.

This is for trekkie fans :)
