Fenton Meeks (Matthew McConaughey), comes forth to tell the FBI that his brother Adam may be the serial killer who calls himself God's Hands, who the FBI has been searching for. The film uses flashbacks to show Meeks' childhood with a father (Bill Paxton) who believed he was on a mission from God to destroy demons that inhabit human bodies. Adam saw his dad as evil, while Fenton saw him as a hero.
