skAI Traffic v1.0
                               =================


As my very own \"AI Traffic\" project comes near completion, I thought it would be a nice idea to give you guys a sneak-preview of it.

You will find a simple Excel sheet in this torrent, which sums up pretty much everything I have been working on for the last few months (hence the silence).

Remember it is still in beta, but the changes made in the next few days will be minor. It should give you a good idea of what to expect.


I am planning on releasing the base package late this weekend, early next week.

I am also planning on releasing updates once every quarter.
The first update (2007-1) will be released in the second quarter of the year, update 2007-2 in the third quarter and so on. Right now I am working on finishing the base package, but also on 2007-1.

Ofcourse I will give you the quality you would expect from me, so only the best models with the less impact on the FPS are used. The package is fine-tuned with all the lightmaps in place (some custom made) and the right callsigns to be used (giving Radar Contact priority over Editvoicepack).

More info comes with the initial release!


Happy landings,
PopArt ;-)
