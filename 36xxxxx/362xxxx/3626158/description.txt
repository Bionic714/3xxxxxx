Filmed in Berlin in 1997, this good-looking production finds the aging bluesman mixing his classic covers with more recent material, all for an appreciative audience in a startlingly dramatic venue. Warming up with "Could You Be Loved" and "Feeling Alright," Cocker soon finds his footing and launches into the Scotch whiskey soul of "Have a Little Faith," the kinky comedy of "You Can Leave Your Hat On," and the gospel-flushed agony of "When the Night Comes." A take on Van Morrison's "Into the Mystic" is welcome, while "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" mines the old Animals chestnut for further blues testimony. The crumpled valentine of "You Are So Beautiful" is touchingly familiar and dedicated, on this occasion, to the late Princess Diana. In all, Cocker is in very good, professional form here, a tempered force of nature, perhaps, but an expressive stylist of mature conviction. --Tom Keogh
