Frantic, Frustrated, and Female (aka F3): 3-episode yuri series with a pinch of heterosexual scenes thrown in, but nothing you can't fast forward past.  I tend to stay away from episode 3, but that doesn't mean other people won't like it.  The basic storyline is, Hiroe is a beautiful young woman, perfect in every way except for one: she has yet to experience an orgasm.  Once her friends find out, they try to help her in every way possible.
