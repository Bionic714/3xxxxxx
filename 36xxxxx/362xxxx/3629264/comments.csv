,williamhlomax,2007-04-12T16:19Z,"Slow download speeds, stopped at 99.9%.  These could are the telltale signs of someone trying to report people who download this torrent, watch out."

,Bongster,2007-06-19T06:43Z,I have dl all of the planet earth series they all come out being an image file. How do I convert this to a disc so I can watch it. I cant even watch it on the computor either would rather burn to a disc. Can someone help me out thanks. Noob. 
,8675309,2007-06-19T07:05Z,"Hey Bongster: I use a program called ""cloneDVD2"" Just click on ""burn iso/udf image"" and go from there...Works great. "
,Bongster,2007-06-21T10:11Z,Thanks 8675309. do you know if the image file that these planet earth are formatted in can be burned useing nero 7. And if so how do I do it?That clone dvd2 is a huge file. Ill try to get cloned to use but would like to use nero if I can. Just a noob tryin to make it work.
,Bongster,2007-06-21T10:44Z,my bad I thought it said gb and it is only a mb so the file isnt huge like I thought. I really need to learn to read and figure this stuff out.
,8675309,2007-06-21T13:07Z,"Sorry Bongster...I never thought about nero. I tried my nero6 and it worked too. Open nero startsmart and select ""DVD"". On mine, there are six icons in a row. I held my curser over the one that said ""copy and backup"" then I selected ""burn image to disc"". Open the ""planet earth"" file and then burn. My nero may be different than nero7, so just look around until you find the ""burn image to disc"" icon...I hope this helps...I'll check back to see how you made out. "
,Bongster,2007-06-22T09:43Z,8675309 Thanks alot I wanted to see this. I found the image thing and burned it. It went pretty quick to. The picture is a little jerky though is that normal for an image file? I wasnt messing with the computor because I know that if you burn and use your computor it can make a video seem to skip so I didnt touch it. The sound seems to be ok it is just the picture. Since you said you will checking back do you know how to burn a video ts file it looks like a gold dvd with a blue arrow thing up in the top right of the gold disc. I think that I had problems burning those as well. Im glad I didnt delete this since I couldnt burn it now I can check it out. Well anyways thanks alot I appreciate the help. 
,Bongster,2007-06-22T09:50Z,Why I have you here do you know why this doesnt play in my dvd player which is a sony playstation 2. That is what I use to watch dvd's on the tv and it wont play. It play on the computor though. Is that just the way it is? Its not easy being a noob. Thanks again at least I can watch it on the comp.
,8675309,2007-06-24T03:45Z,"Hey Bongster... My copy was a little jerkey at the start but was fine after. I don't think you can play burnt dvd's on a playstation. And those video_ts files are actual dvd files and can be burned with nero. Open startsmart and under applications, select ""nero burning rom"" It's kinda hard to explain but this link should help http://www.videohelp.com/nerodvd.htm
Also, I use google all the time. Just type in your questions and you usually get the answers...Good luck!"
,Bongster,2007-06-24T04:25Z,Ok thanks
,Bongster,2007-06-24T04:30Z,"Oh yeah, I can play most movies avi files I burn on the playstation and any movie I rent I just couldnt play these planet earth image files on it. I guess I'll just watch it on the computor. Thanks again for the help."

Instructions!

To burn this DVD

To watch on computer

2. Open the program and go to image finder
3. hit search...right click on the file and select add to alcohol
4. Close that window (may need to open alcohol again)
