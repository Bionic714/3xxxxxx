,Misee,2007-03-07T15:14Z,"Hi Kaireser!

For mds mdf files use Alcohol 120% I burned it out also with this prog.Adjust nothing by the prog.first extract the rar files. select the first piece then say eytract... 
1. just use image burning option ,
2.search the file MDS/MDF
open it then burn it on 4x speed!-(DAO-disc at once) dont need to adjust it.
thats all.
ohh and use the latest alcohol 120% 
it must work ,if you do these things ;)
good luck."
