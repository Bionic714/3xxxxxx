Rageh Inside Iran
BBC 4 Thu 15 Feb, 21:00-22:30  90mins

 Rageh Omaar embarks upon a unique journey inside Iran in this investigative and 
insightful programme that looks at the country through the eyes of people whose 
voices are rarely heard ? ordinary Iranians. 

It took a year of wrangling to secure permission to film inside Iran but the result 
is an amazing portrayal of an energetic and vibrant country that is completely 
different to the usual images seen in the media.

A complex and contradictory place, Iran is a country which bans women from riding 
motorcycles but where 60 per cent of the student population is female. It has the 
world's fourth-largest blogging community and worst record for road deaths.

In Tehran, Rageh visits people's homes and travels through a rich variety of 
neighbourhoods in a bid to get to the heart of what he describes as one of the most 
misunderstood countries in the world. As local people ? from wrestlers and businesswomen 
to taxi drivers and Iran's leading pop star ? share their personal stories and feelings 
about the current state of affairs in the country, Rageh uncovers a city of extremes, 
of wealth and poverty, where some people survive on less than a dollar a day and others 
shop till they drop in glitzy shopping malls.

Iran is also a youthful place; two-thirds of its 70m population is under 30. While 
filming, Rageh is invited to write an article for a leading youth magazine. This takes 
him on a journey to discover what life is like for young people and, in particular, 
young women in Iran ? and opens his eyes to the country's strict censorship rules.

Rageh Inside Iran is a film which transcends images of angry demonstrations and burning 
flags to reveal a country that isn't without its problems but which is also fascinating, 
dynamic and hospitable.
