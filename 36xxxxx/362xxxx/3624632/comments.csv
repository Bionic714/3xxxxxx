,Halbermunken,2007-02-23T04:51Z,"Scott Ritter, former weapons inspector and author of Target Iran: The Truth About the White House?s Plans for Regime Change, says it is a deception that the U.S. government is concerned about Iran?s nuclear program or that they mean to use diplomacy to put an end to it, but instead is determined to have regime change in that country regardless. He also discusses some of the likely consequences if America does attack.

On Thursday, January 11, 2007, Congressman Ron Paul of Texas (R) (but he's really a Libertarian) hit the house floor and put on the record what many Americans fear might be coming down the pipe; a new Gulf of Tonkin incident to initiate a shooting war with Iran. 

""The truth is that Iran, like Iraq, is a third-world nation without a significant military. Nothing in history hints that she is likely to invade a neighboring country, let alone America or Israel. I am concerned, however, that a contrived Gulf of Tonkin- type incident may occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran.""

Anything starting with BBC should be banned on this site."
,mistabusta,2007-07-15T11:46Z,"mopkob. i have seen this docu, and it isnt as anti-iranian as u making it out to be. its good, shows how iranians are so 'Zebel' or sly when it comes to propaganda, and manipulative, but thats the regime which i can't stand. the people are the opoosite of that slyness. secretly open. warm and friendly, but still keep ur eyes open ;)"

,delahaya,2008-01-09T02:26Z,"Pure propaganda showing selective, positive slices of Iranian life while glossing over most everything else.  But then again, Jimmy Carter kneecapped the Shah and lead us straight to the Ayatollah and current Iran, so we have to make it look good."
