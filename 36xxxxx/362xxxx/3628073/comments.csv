,Never_Get_Busted,2007-04-14T17:32Z,"Download a program called ""Alcohol 120%"", install it and open this file in the program.

The program creates a virtual drive and makes you think you actually have the DVD in the computer. The .ISO file in this torrent is the DVD."

,eastern876,2008-08-08T04:50Z,"BARRY COOPER IS AN AGENT.    He actually advocates waiving your constitutionally protected rights and CONSENTING to police search requests!     THIS IS THE WORST THING YOU CAN EVER DO and the consequences may destroy your life.   Talk to a lawyer before you listen to anything this guy says.  

Watch the ACLU video ""Busted: The Citizen's Guide to Surviving Police Encounters"" instead. 

LEARN YOUR RIGHTS and ASSERT THEM!     Do not EVER waive them, and do not EVER consent to police search requests, or inquiries into your private affairs.

If you're being questioned and are unsure what to do, just say ""Officer, I know you're just doing your job, but my attorney told me NEVER to talk to police officers.""   PERIOD."
,eastern876,2008-08-08T05:19Z,"Another piece of SUICIDAL advice from Cooper are his suggestions on ""how to answer the questions"" police may ask you, when they have you stopped or out of the car.   There is NO safe way to answer questions.  Police are trained to trap you into saying something that can be used to further an arrest.

DO NOT ANSWER _ANY_ QUESTIONS !!!    Again, just tell the cop your lawyer told you never to talk to police.  "
