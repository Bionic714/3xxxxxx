,pebi_mail,2007-05-24T09:45Z,"Hi, is there anybody out there who can share this lovely tape in a direct way? 

Indeed, it was just one of the greatest concerts ever. I´ve been to Essen with a few friends and our last video copy is lost 10 years ago.
By the way, i´ve been to a JW Concert in Bonn on the 12th of May 2007.
WDR TV will send the whole concert on Sunday morning 3th of June 2007 at 00:30 till 4:00 o´clock.
You will see Johnny and Edgar Winter and Rick Derringer together and with their Groups. It was a nice evening but nothing compares to this concert in 1979.
I remember the finest version of ""Mississippi Delta Blues"" and ""Suzie Q""  i ever heard.
