,Jas-Is,2007-02-21T23:28Z,Any way of playing this on the PC?
,rumpage22,2007-02-21T23:36Z,"Search google for ""pcsx2"" and you'll find an emulator.

Thanks for the upload, just started looking for this. I have 100mbit up/down so there weill be speed here I hope :D"
,Delichris,2007-02-21T23:57Z,"Sorry rumpage22,but I have a 1024\256 Kbps connection,so you won't see much speed from me.You should seed when you're finally done,though.Patience :)"
,D@guett,2007-02-22T00:59Z,"No French!!
Multilanguage or only english ??"
,Delichris,2007-02-22T07:04Z,"About the language,there's only english.But I'm not sure about the subtitles.I'll look into it."
,Delichris,2007-02-22T07:07Z,I'll stop seeding this for some hours.I 'll be back soon.
,Delichris,2007-02-22T13:55Z,Update:you should download the rar archive at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3624238/FINAL_FANTASY_12_PAL.rar
,morsil88,2007-02-22T14:25Z,Do i HAVE to download the .rar?
,Delichris,2007-02-22T15:24Z,"No,you don't ""HAVE"",I will keep seeding this one.But you can download the smaller one faster.You can find software to open the Rar archive at:
http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm
It may be shareware,but the trial version will do the work just fine."

,champy89,2007-02-26T15:45Z,i have learn how to do music and pc games using deamon tools is this download 1 file and do i just play it on emulater i got all the bios? also has anyone tested this to see if it works???if it does thx for seeding will keep me busy for years to come 
,Delichris,2007-02-26T17:09Z,"The download is one .ISO file only.I had already burned it and tested it in my PS2 when I uploaded it,and nobody has complained about it not working(more than 50 ppl have already dl it)"
,Delichris,2007-02-26T21:01Z,"I can't stress this enough,but please *reseed* after downloading!(Forgive me for repeating myself)"
,Speedman3000,2007-02-27T14:58Z,"It does not work for me :(
I have a hdloader and tryied with some diffrent modes...still it does not work Plz HELP!!!!"
,Delichris,2007-02-27T16:43Z,That doesn't help;please explain your problem in detail.
,Speedman3000,2007-02-27T16:45Z,I only get black screen..why??
,Delichris,2007-02-27T16:54Z,"Well,I didn't know what HD Loader is,looked it up in Wikipedia,and found this:
""...The HD Loader software does not require an original Sony hard drive to function properly; most generic IDE drives can be attached to the PS2 using a Sony Ethernet adapter and formatted for use by the software. This does not, however, allow the use of a non-Sony hard drive with PS2 games such as Final Fantasy XI, which require the (official) HDD peripheral...""
The same issue must apply for FFXII
."
,Delichris,2007-02-27T17:06Z,There are patches for HD Loader to allow you to play incompatible games;you should search the net to find one. 
,DevilGamer,2007-02-28T19:31Z,"THIS DOESN'T WORK!
I have mod chip, i burned this to a dvd, but it doesn't work. FUCK IT"
,Delichris,2007-02-28T19:54Z,Which program did you use to burn it?
,DevilGamer,2007-02-28T20:24Z,"NERO and IMGBURNER. I have european version of PS2, (PAL)."
,Delichris,2007-02-28T20:53Z,"You should try DVD Decrypter(there is at least one torrent here on TPB which provides it).You should also make sure that your drive works properly,it could have gotten dusty or something."
,DevilGamer,2007-02-28T22:13Z,Every other PS2 games that i've downloaded here
,Delichris,2007-02-28T22:30Z,"...work?And mine doesn't?Strange;about 70 people have downloaded it and you are the first to complain.This could be because your modchip gets lazy and doesn't work.How many times have you tested it?I sometimes encounter that sort of problem with my own modchip(it shows the""insert PS2 or PS format disc"")and reset until it loads the disc."
,Delichris,2007-03-04T20:50Z,"If you'd like to know,I've uploaded another game's PAL english version,this time it is Okami.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3632080/Okami_Europe-PAL_EngSubs.rar"
,Mumpleaser,2007-03-06T09:58Z,I also get the black screen after the Playstation 2 logo has come up but I think it is probably a laser issue rathe than a dodgy image.
,Zerphed,2007-03-07T15:44Z,Does running this game require an mod chip and if so where can I get one? I just bought my PS2 so I'm a newbie (;
,Delichris,2007-03-07T16:03Z,"Yes,to run a pirated copy of a game you will need a mod-chip OR a utility/boot disc like Swap Magic."
,Zerphed,2007-03-07T16:26Z,"Just a question about swap magic, does it actually leave your PS2's DVD hatch open? Or how does it work?"
,Delichris,2007-03-07T22:55Z,I've never used one myself(I only use a modchip).You should ask someone else about Swap Magic.
,Delichris,2007-03-07T22:57Z,"I've uploaded another PS2 game,Disgaea.If you haven't ever played it,you should have a shot at this great game.

,sinner_1337,2007-03-12T00:29Z,"heey guys!! Just a quastion about this game, can you play this one over emulator ? To be exact, can i play it on ePSXe.exe emulator ? and is this the Final and the real FF12 now ? "
,Delichris,2007-03-12T09:35Z,"Yes,this is the real,the one and only;I ripped FF12 as soon as it came out in Europe.About PS2 emulation,I would recommend you PCSX2,it can play FF12(and many other games). "
,sinner_1337,2007-03-12T17:21Z,"Anyone who knows where i can get a nice Guide "" swedish "" would be gr8 but english is ok too.. how to install it and what plugins i should use and so on! would be gr8 thanks alot "" Kisses "" "
,sinner_1337,2007-03-13T01:42Z,"Whant to update what i wrote before and put in, CAN ANYONE PLZ HELP ME :P

I have downloaded both rar / iso, and i have the PCSX2_0.9.2_ and i also have the epsxe152 and i have wrote everything again and again how to configurate it and it works with FFIX on the epsxe152 but not on PCSX2_0.9.2_ .. but this game that your seeding cant do anything on both emulators.. Can you even play this wonderfoul game over Emulator or do you need the PS2 unit to play ?.. and its all black when i trying to play it, and the funnyest thing about this.. its stands that its 3.77GiB but when you open the iso its like only 4mb.. :S ? 

So sry for my whineĂ˝ day.. but someone plz help a dear FF fan out plz.. 
/ Love sinneR"
,Delichris,2007-03-13T15:47Z,"PCSX2_ONLY_SUPPORTS PS2 games,that's why FFIX (PS1) can't be played, and ePSXe_ONLY_SUPPORTS PS1 CDs,so FFXII(PS2) is incompatible.If you can't play it in PCSX2,try another CDVD plug-in (and play around with the plugins and their settings generally) until it works.You can find PCSX2 along with a nice selection of plugins here on TPB (just use the search function)."
,sinner_1337,2007-03-13T19:48Z,"well iam kinda big hit noob on this :P so if anyone would be so realy kind and mabey past out some sites or FTP download to direct plugins would be gr8 for me and for maney other ppl too i guess.. i cant be the only noob on this or :P ? 

/love sinneR"
,Delichris,2007-03-13T20:28Z,"Sinner,you should download http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3628079/PCSX_0.9.2
This torrent has PCSX2 0.9.2 with a variety of plugins,all in one file(BIOS is included!)."

Btw...does any1 else get this work than Delichris??"
,Kyrbyli,2007-03-14T21:47Z,Yiiha...i burned it again and now its work :O Thnx m8
,sinner_1337,2007-03-14T23:27Z," Delichris - 2007-02-28 19:05 CET:

I have tested it with PCSX2 myself,but it doesn't seem to work well on my computer(2.6 GHz Pentium4 proc.,512 MB Ram,NVidia GeForce FX 5200 with 128 MB VideoRAM graphics card).At least it works(I've only tested it up to the New Game options screen).

-------

So a simple A to B .. This dosent work at PC ? you need PS2 Consol to play this gr8 game :("
,Delichris,2007-03-15T15:50Z,"Well,what I meant was that it was ""running"" slowly,but if you have a faster system,you will be able to play it much better.I didn't test it in depth though."
,lordkhan,2007-03-22T20:15Z,Needs to have atleast a dual core and like some geforce from 7000 series ;)

,Delichris,2007-03-24T21:04Z,Try limiting the speed and burn it again.But have you tried other games as well?
,b0skin,2007-04-03T11:06Z,"Hi there !

Just wonder what kina file it is  - SLES_543.54 ?
What a strange extention !

Excuse my ignorance, but the total files' content is only 5.41 MB.
And where is the rest ? Don't see any ""hidden"" files. LOL"
,Delichris,2007-04-07T11:17Z,"b0skin,this is a PS2 game.Just burn the .ISO file using a program like Imgburn.PS2 programmers use strange files and hi-tech protection methods to make games inaccessible via a PC,that' s why you can only see only a few of the game' s files."

""Haha Delichris. Your game doesn't, it's a piece. God Bless.""

I read your posts one by one and I see that you do not have any intention of fixing the problem, you are just spamming and pretending to be an expert.
You might even not have downloaded the file."
