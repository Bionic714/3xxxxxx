,traxzilla,2008-05-01T07:26Z,"nils333, chicks321, and j3d11 are all very much incorrect, please do not pay any attention to them.

This is ""The Invincible Iron Man""

This is NOT ""Iron Man""

It is a direct-to-DVD movie from 2007.

It is a really, really bad movie.

This should not have to be repeated so many times, LEARN TO READ."
