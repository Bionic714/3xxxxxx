Guardian Review :
    The second stunning revival of the week comes by way of Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 war movie, which tells in typically sombre, deadpan style, of the French resistance and their operations against the Nazi occupation forces. Forget about the bullet-ridden hell-storms or raffish derring-do of your conventional second world war picture: this is a world of cold, grey-painted rooms, as often as not containing immobile figures dripping with blood. Melville's own history with the Free French is well-known, and Army in the Shadows, an adaptation of Joseph Kessel's novel was his third time with the subject.
    Central to events is the apparently mild-mannered civil engineer Philippe Gerbier (Lino Ventura), leader of a resistance cell in Marseille, who is taken by the Gestapo and, against all odds, manages to break out before the interrogation can get going. Vengeance on his betrayer is swift and, in a scene possessing an almost unimaginable level of icy brutality, execution meted out by hand. Gerbier makes his way to London, there to meet and receive a medal from de Gaulle; but another arrest, this time of his fellow resistance fighter Félix (Paul Crauchet), forces his return. All this sets up a finale in which a third cell member Mathilde (Simone Signoret), organises an attempt to get him out.
    It's certainly true - as has been often pointed out - that Army of the Shadows owes much to Melville's gangster films, in the particular attention it pays to the same stately codes of loyalty, sacrifice and honour that the director put to such brilliant effect in Le Samourai and Le Cercle Rouge, the two films he made either side of this. Melville makes no concession whatever to the tide of Nouvelle Vague-inspired realism that was sweeping world cinema in the late 60s, and in some ways Army in the Shadows is as stiffly arranged as any of the old black-and-white films that Melville himself idolised. But in its devotion to, and forging of, the mythology surrounding the French resistance, it remains a work of moving ideological commitment as well as beautifully detailed orchestration.
