,deaneth,2007-02-24T19:48Z,The above serial number is incorrect does anyone know of any more?
,xenn00,2007-02-24T19:55Z,"You should have a serial number among downloaded files, if you don't so send me a message to get it!"
,smk131,2007-02-26T14:18Z,It's nice! The key included the torrent works fine. Thanks for the prog!
,chinita2007,2007-02-28T20:18Z,i have windows xp and when a itry to donwload this torrent it tell me that windows can open this file can u help me !
,ohiojoe,2007-03-24T10:52Z,"VIRUS Alert. Installed this, but left my computer for a few hours. Came back with my profile gone, my email gone, all my settings gone, and Windows One Care had a warning box up saying it found a virus (the title was partially obscured, I didn't try to read it and just had Windows One Care remove it, but it started with ""TrajanDownload..."" . Anyway, beware. I used Windows Restore to get back my settings and email. Don't knwo what info might have been sent back via the virus those few hours though."
,pooper55,2007-05-04T16:40Z,4363 downloads and 1 virus alert?
,raveburt,2007-05-30T23:43Z,"Just a question out of the ""blue""...How on earth did you restore your emails with windows restore? Hilarious. This torrent works fine...see 5479 times actually."
,Teknokrat,2007-06-01T10:16Z,"Just a quick thought:
I wonder how many of the 5535 ppl who downloaded this actually have installed it and tried it =)

Just because thousands of ppl have DLd a torrent it doesn't automatically mean it is fully working/clean.
I can't say anything about this particular torrent - just had to comment the ""so and so many have downloaded""-remark."

I have a 22000kbps feed here in my office and want to seed this to show my appreciation, but my Utorrent says it's seeding, but it doesn't show any connections or uploading. Any ideas please? "
,stillbourne,2008-10-22T19:20Z,"Okay, got it seeding, must have just needed time. Drink it up people, I'm done here at the end of the month and will have to find a new connection so take what you can while I got this thing going. Right now is uploading between 125kbps to 225kbps. Is there any way I can make it send faster?"
