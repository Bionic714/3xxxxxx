I'll keep the files on the HDD and seed on...
but I nedd some assistance :-)"
,Whopperz,2007-03-01T06:49Z,burn the img file to a DVD using DVD Decrypter.
,Merlin242,2007-03-02T08:29Z,"Just rename the .img-file to .iso
Nero can read it then."
,olav66,2007-03-03T18:47Z,"Thanks Merlin,

I had inadvertently turned on ""Hide file extension for known files"" in Windows and when turned off it showed the file extension"".img"". I followed your advice and substituted it with "".iso"" and brought the file to Nero and it burned like a breeze...

Thanks for helping me out; I owe you one!

,MissSheherezade,2007-03-04T12:23Z,I can't watch the film on any of my dvd players...it works fine on the computer but when I put it in the dvd player it tries to read it but then stops...why is that? does anyone know?
,olav66,2007-03-04T15:50Z,"Oh, kind miss,
Follow the thread above and do the same; rename the file extension .img to .iso and burn it... most likely it will play in your DVD player as it finally did in mine!"
