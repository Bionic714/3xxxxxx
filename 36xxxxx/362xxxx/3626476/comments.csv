,TigersWin,2007-11-05T22:12Z,"rar file is corrupt.  don't waste the time downloading it.  When you extract it, it says there are no files present."
,SparroHawc,2007-11-06T03:49Z,"Downloaded, attempted to run.  RAR files unRAR'd, contrary to one poster.  Installed fine; crack failed to work on the FAT version despite appearing to work - still cannot copy files from the recovery tree.  

Have not tried NTFS as that is not what I needed to recover."
,fr33z3r.burn,2007-11-06T18:05Z,"Unpacked just fine, however crack for FAT version does not work.  When trying to copy rcovered files, it prompts with a ""must license to copy"" message."
