"Two Roads to Baja" is the story of one of the greatest off-road races in the world from two very different points of view.  Watch as two Baja adventures unfold, one from off-road legend Rod Millen and his Millenworks Race Team and the other from amateur driver Kevin Necessary and his crew of misfits.  Armed with Toyota FJ Cruisers, each team will show what it takes to be left standing when the dust finally settles.
