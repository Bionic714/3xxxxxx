Concurrent Remote Desktop Sessions allows you to connect through Remote Desktop to a system that someone else is logged on to, under a different user account, and access the system without kicking the other user off.
In Windows Vista the Remote Desktop feature is available for the Business, Enterprise and Ultimate editions. However, the Concurrent Remote Desktop Sessions feature is not available.
By using a patched version of termsrv.dll, located in %SystemRoot%\System32\, this feature becomes available.

The package contains 7 files:
Vista_Concurrent_RDP_sessions.nfo:	This file
termsrv.dll.original32bit:			The original unpatched termsrv.dll file for Windows Vista 32 bit
termsrv.dll.original64bit:			The original unpatched termsrv.dll file for Windows Vista 64 bit
termsrv.dll.patched32bit:			The patched termsrv.dll file for Windows Vista 32 bit
termsrv.dll.patched64bit:			The patched termsrv.dll file for Windows Vista 64 bit
patch_termsrv_32bit.bat:			A batch file for automatic patching on Windows Vista 32 bit
patch_termsrv_64bit.bat:			A batch file for automatic patching on Windows Vista 64 bit

How to patch (Automatic):
Run either patch_termsrv_32bit.bat or patch_termsrv_64bit.bat, according to your operating system, AS AN ADMINISTRATOR. Use right-click, and select "Run as administrator".

When for any reason this fails, try to do it manually:
Take ownership of %SystemRoot%\System32\termsrv.dll and give yourself Full Control permissions.
Rename or delete the original termsrv.dll.
Copy the patched file (termsrv.dll.patched32bit or termsrv.dll.patched64bit) to %SystemRoot%\System32\

You must reboot your system for the patch to take effect!
