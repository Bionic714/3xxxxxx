,XSYLUS,2007-04-10T03:26Z,This is the right movie and it's in english (for those who may be suspicious.)  Video taken with camera as stated in title and thus not the greatest quality.  Audio is descent but the bass-tones were a bit high probably due to the camera microphone absorbing the sound from all the speakers in the theatre.  At times it's difficult to understand what people are saying either due to the characters not speaking very loud and occassionally due to noises caused by people in the theatre.  This torrent will give you a resonable idea of what the movie is about but I don't plan to keep it due to the degraded quality.
