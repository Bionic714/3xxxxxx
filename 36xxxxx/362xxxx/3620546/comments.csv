,JJCHM,2012-03-01T15:06Z,"At the time I'm writing this, there are no seeders for this torrent, but several leechers with 99.9% completion.

If you download the 99.9%, all you will have lost is the mp3 file containing the theme song.

BUT - The first episode will be corrupt and unplayable. Because it's the beginning (file header ) that is missing, most file fixing programs can't fix it. But this one can:

Hope this helps..."
