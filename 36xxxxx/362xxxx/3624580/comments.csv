[T],__X-Man__,2007-02-24T12:14Z,"Hmmm using very large Torrent Parts seem to be a bad idea. Even if the default settings say 2MB per hash, the initial seed overhead is huge. This here which is 700MB large used 2,2GB upload to make it to 100%.

I can recommand to build 256K Hash-Parts. Overflow for Initial-Seed is at 10% or less."
