,st.EVIL,2007-04-04T12:59Z,User Rating: 9.9/10 at IMDB. Thats nice    : )THX a lot !
,jrock636,2007-04-07T01:50Z,I know its broad casted in HD is this file HD? I know nothing about HD burning will most dvd burners do it or do they have HD burners?
,Fito33,2007-04-10T22:42Z,"This seems to be educating... something useful for a change... thx, respect!"
,jokker,2007-04-12T18:08Z,Hmm this was funny my upload is hier than my down loads on all of the 5... dont understand
,nightsongz2,2007-04-15T03:46Z,Nicely done...has dvd menus & everything...plus I learned stuff!! Thanks for the upload...great quality dvd iso.
,nightsongz2,2007-04-15T04:43Z,"The only thing that sucks is that these Planet Earth dvd iso's are in PAL format so if you are in the U'S' or Canada and burn these to dvd, they will not play in your dvd player...unless you have gone out and bought a dvd player just for PAL format dvds. Still watchable on my pc, though. Also, you can convert to NTSC but it's not easy and I believe there is a bit of the quality lost in conversion."
,DocHOL,2007-04-17T23:41Z,"That's just wrong. All relatively modern TVs are capable of showing both PAL and NTSC (or atleast the ones sold in Europe). Even my previous 10 year old TV had no problems. 

Your DVD player shouldn't care whether it's PAL or NTSC. You must be thinking of region coding. "
,ukbsktbll,2007-04-18T16:44Z,how does this look compared to watching it in HD?
,kennyg101,2007-04-21T09:49Z,In the U.S loads of players only play NTSC. Thats why the yankee doodles sometimes whine about PAL.
,ReXChalle,2007-04-23T19:32Z,this is a great show but its a shame theres no swe sub :(

,m1ck3y,2007-04-26T03:32Z,"When i play it on my computer, it seems to just play the rear channels for a surround sound system. When i write it on media will it still be like that when its in a DVD player? Is there anyone who had this that can please help me?                 Listen to Bob Marley..."

I also am having the same problem. It says file to large for disc drive. It says file size 4.4 and only room for 4.0 on my disc? I have tons of room left???
 This has never happened to me before. Can anyone help with this?

,notred,2007-05-09T14:48Z,i got two questions 1. what's the different between NTSC or PAL? 2.what subs is included?
,dentman,2007-05-10T07:16Z,"NTSC is for USA and Pal is mostly you other guys. Some DVD players will play both. Most will not. You can load this awesome ISO with PowerISO or such and play on your computer. Remember LCD monitors are HD quality. It looks great  on my 22"" Samsung. 
English subs only on this one. "

For that torrent, there are a bunch of us stuck at 99%. Since you are the original uploader, I'm wondering if you could please seed it for some time? 

You'll make a lot of us happy! Thanks bro"

,ilurk,2007-06-09T20:48Z,to DocHOL:regular dvd players and tv's in north america will not play PAL.PAL has more lines of resolution.Will play in a HDDVD.At least it does on my XBOX 360 HD drive.
,war59312,2007-06-18T06:16Z,"You can easily trick your dvd player into thinking it is NTSC using Ifo Edit.

Or you can convert it for real using Vob Blanker.

Never had any issues with losing quality.

My Sony dvd player only plays NTSC so I have to convert all PAL releases and have never had a problem. Not once!"
,Bongster,2007-06-19T06:42Z,I have dl all of the planet earth series they all come out being an image file. How do I convert this to a disc so I can watch it. I cant even watch it on the computor either would rather burn to a disc. Can someone help me out thanks. Noob.
,beeferoni,2007-06-29T22:31Z,"Bongster: Download and install the free tool ImgBurn from this address: http://www.imgburn.com/

After that, just right click on the .iso file in Explorer and select ""Burn with ImgBurn"" to make a playable disc.

Huge thanks for these DVD's!!"

,iegorshkov,2007-09-03T22:32Z,For PAL/NTSC DVD players try a Coby Model 225 or 215; Sabre also makes an inexpensive PAL/NTSC DVD player (dual voltage). I use a Coby 215 instead of converting PAL to NTSC. Also for USA residents try: http://www.dvdoverseas.com

,THE-REVIEW,2008-09-28T12:10Z,"----------------------------------
Instructions!

To burn this DVD
1. Download Alcohol 120%
2. In the program hit image burning wizard
3. Select the iso. file
4. Burn (btw...this is a copy of the dvd, so it has menus, ect...)

To watch on computer
1. Get alcohol 120%
2. Open the program and go to image finder
3. hit search...right click on the file and select add to alcohol
4. Close that window (may need to open alcohol again)
5. Right click on the file in the main window and select mount on device (pick one. In alcohol you can make virtual drives btw...)
6. Now the DVD should launch as if in a DVD player. If not go your DVD drive and open it (under my computer)
7. Thats it!
8. When you are done, you can un-mount the dvd using step 5

ENJOY!
