,serpentine5,2009-07-18T06:32Z,"Very cool. Went to share this movie with my son today, I dug my dvd out, brought it over to my PC and had him sit down. He is just shy of his 4th BD so his attention is short with things that arent attractive to him. Put the DVD in and nothing... got the menu to play, but nothing else, started freezing my system. Tried it in my actually stand alone DVD player and it told me the dvd was screwed... Talking about being pissed. Hopefully this will DL quick enough for him and I to watch it tomorrow evening.
According to my client surprisingly there are 8 leachers and 6 seeders. Cool for something that has been uploaded 2 1/2 years ago.
Thanks again."
