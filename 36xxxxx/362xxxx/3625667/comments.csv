I am new, and I don't understand!!"
,triple,2007-02-24T16:03Z,Seeds are people that have the WHOLE file (film in this case). Leechers are people downloading and having nothing or a part of the file. The more seeders the more people having a whole file = faster downloading!
[T],trackers,2007-02-24T16:22Z,"Ni kan lika gärna skita i att ladda ner denna, den är helt kass en bit in på andra halvan av filmen, närmare bestämt 1.08.28 och framåt. Kvallen är hel värdelös."
,w1ldd0g,2007-02-24T17:05Z,This release is nuked (no.ivtc): http://nforce.nl/index.php?switchto=nfos&menu=quicknav&item=viewnfo&id=111631
,Amerialb,2007-02-24T18:50Z,"Though the rip is good, the movie itself is totally lame!"
[T],trackers,2007-02-24T19:07Z,And so are you.
,itsduffman,2007-02-24T23:09Z,"Nuked: Eragon.DVDRip.XviD-SaGa [stolen.source.from.cc]

Run don't walk when you see a SaGa release.  They steal everything they release."
,#Gobbi#,2007-02-25T12:29Z,"Do NOT download.
Quality = Shit.

Wait for aXXo released."
,sweatyrich,2007-02-25T12:47Z,"Sound and picture are initially fine, but the last 1/2 hr or so the picture gets REAL blocky and unwatchable!
Don't say I didn't warn you..."
