,be-sick,2007-02-27T22:12Z,All I needed to do is run batch file (system32\Autoexnt.bat) and import the registry settings. No file copy nor installation.
,akayal,2007-02-27T22:25Z,"For be-sick
If u did what u said your windows well not be genuine after you restart your computer ...
after copying the files and runing the command
your windows will be genuine forever ."
,Tony73,2007-02-27T23:14Z,"Tyvär. vet ej. hur upstod felet?
vad är egentligen Genuine Forever 100%"
,Himlabein,2007-02-28T19:47Z,"ved en feil ble det lastet ned en ny variant av windows genuine advantage validation fra microsoft her i går eller forrigår. Nå er jeg igjen tilbak ei steinalderen (hvis det kan kalles det pga feil validering)
Etter å ha kopiert disse filene til system32 katalogen, skjer det igjenting. Jeg restarter og ingen forbedring...
I tillegg har jeg kjørt Search&Destroy etter omstarten og da finner den en del windows valideringsfiler som den tar å setter i karantene... 

Noen som har gode tips?"
,Himlabein,2007-02-28T20:03Z,"As you can see, no validated copy yet....

,cleared4landing,2007-03-01T19:54Z,"Thanks for the torrent.  When I copy files, run ""instexnt install"" and restart it workes great (temporarily).  Th e WGA tool says that my copy of XP is genuine, and I do not get the ""You have 20 days to activate"" bubble that used to come up.  

BUT when I shut down the computer and load it up again, I get the bubble again saying ""You have 20 days to activate"", and the WGA tool says my copy has not been activated.  

I just installed XP on this machine recently, as it used to be Windows 2000.

When I restart and it reverses itself the files I copied to /system 32 are still there.  But it says my copy of XP still needs activation and is not yet ""genuine"".

Any ideas?"
,bejjo,2007-03-02T11:57Z,Works! thank You!
,Demorgon,2007-03-05T02:29Z,I used this is worked great...  Until I restarted then it told me a program was blocking product id or soemthing and I couldn't log in???? Do you have to disable this after you get your update??? It kinda sucked I had to re-ghost... Anyone have this happen or maybe I'm and idiot and you have to disable it after getting updates...
