Unnerving, discomforting yet absolutely compelling, "Little Earthquakes" presents Tori Amos, one of the most exiting musical discoveries in recent years. Featuring the videos for "Silent All These Years", "China", "Winter" and "Crucify", this revealing collection also includes conversations and behind the scenes footage with this unique singer/songwriter.
Tori is also captured live from the Bottom Line in New York City and from a special concert in Rotterdam, Holland, performing songs from "Little Earthquakes". Included in these concerts are two additional tracks not on the album. Also captured is the debut television performance of "Me and A Gun" filmed in Hong Kong for MTV Asia.
