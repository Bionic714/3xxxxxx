They hail from the great Northeast and are rumored to share members with another great reggae group, John Brown?s Body. Their shows are rarely announced or promoted. In fact, like a yeti sighting, they seldom occur. Anyone who has seen them live, or owns one of their albums, can attest to the fact that no other band has captured the 70?s spirit quite like this crew, that 10 Ft. may be the best roots group in America."
