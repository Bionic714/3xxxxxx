,WogerWabbit,2008-05-20T17:33Z,Any tips to play this on non Windows machines? Even VLC doesn't like this (and it usually play anything).
,AntiJuw,2008-08-12T11:09Z,"Thanks! Codec (that makes it playable in MPC, but contains a player also) for this, that works in Win-XP and Win-Vista here:

,AntiJuw,2008-08-12T12:02Z,"Never mind my comment about codec :P The one included in the torrent (awarent.exe) is the same, it works for Vista also."
,AntiJuw,2008-08-12T12:05Z,I meant the awarent.exe that is inside the file Motion Pixels Video Codec for XP.zip
,avatar2012,2008-08-14T05:54Z,Thanks AntiJuw -= good to know it works with Vista
,ArrGee2008,2008-09-25T16:23Z,"I'm probably being completely thick here, but I need some help.  I have downloaded this but don't know how to install the codecs or view this in anyway. Could someone kindly guide me through step-by-step please (from the point that the download finshed)?  Thanks in advance."
,slkslk,2008-10-25T14:12Z,"Excellent post, thank you for sharing.  

I bought this film in VHS from Radio Shack all those years ago.   The tape was long lost and I've wanted to replace it.  Seems  when I tried to recall the name I  wasn't quite getting it right.   I found this posting by accident,  but I'll settle for that.

The follow-up videos would be great too.  Thanks again"
,cjs1,2009-04-18T21:10Z,"Exact ISO from back in the day.  If you are looking to get it out of the long extinct MIV2 (Motion  Pixels) format, there is a simple way to convert it to modern AVI. Once converted to modern AVI the format possibilities are endless (change to MP4, burn to DVD, etc).

All you have to do is mount the .ISO and extract the AVI file from the ""VIDEOS"" folder. Once extracted, begin the recoding process via a great open source application called VirtualDub.

http://www.virtualdub.org/download.html

Open VirtualDub, choose the AVI file and then go to File->Save as AVI.

Let it finish the process and you're good to go. After that, it is no longer using the MIV2 codec, so you are free to throw the file into Handbrake or Nero and encode away.  I hope this helps someone out there. It would have saved me two hours of research. :-)"
,jackson5more,2009-05-05T07:44Z,Big thanks for that one cjs1 - soon as I figure out how to use the software this should play on the big screen!
