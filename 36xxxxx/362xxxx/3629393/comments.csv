The site has become a ghost town. Many members left after they got word Tauro lied to the VDF community. My advice, stay away from porno forums and stick to torrent websites buddy."
,Smut_Pile,2008-07-18T22:36Z,Hi Shoey. Thanks for all your work posting here & at the forum. Vipers Den has been giving me 403 notices for several months now so I don't know if it's officially dead now or what. Glad to see your work elsewhere. you're a boon to the community.
