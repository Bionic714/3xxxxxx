,Silentxelone,2007-10-02T05:27Z,Can someone please seed this. I wanted to see this forever. The last time I saw it i was 12 years old (I am 27 now) so immagine the wait...
,avatar2012,2007-10-05T03:53Z,"I seed this on a semi-regular basis silentx - if my connection cant reach you, post again and we can find another way to get them to you."
,DjCheshire,2008-05-01T00:15Z,you should totally post up chronos.
,avatar2012,2008-05-13T17:18Z,OK will do.  Seeding of these has died down so will up it tomorrow and post link here.
,avatar2012,2008-05-13T18:55Z,"Actually, strike that - Chronos is already available on torrent =- and in DVD quality."
,WogerWabbit,2008-05-20T17:33Z,Any tips to play this on non Windows machines? Even VLC doesn't like this (and it usually play anything).
,avatar2012,2008-05-27T03:27Z,The codec used in these films is so rare that I havent been able to decode the avi's onto DVD - leave alone found how they might play on non-windows machines - sorry *
,AntiJuw,2008-08-12T11:07Z,"Thanks! Codec (that makes it playable in MPC, but contains a player also) for this, that works in Win-XP and Win-Vista here:

,AntiJuw,2008-08-12T12:08Z,"Never mind my comment about codec :P The one included in the torrent (the file awarent.exe inside the file Motion Pixels Video Codec for XP.zip) is exactly the same, it works for Vista also."
,ArrGee2008,2008-09-25T16:23Z,"I'm probably being completely thick here, but I need some help.  I have downloaded this but don't know how to install the codecs or view this in anyway. Could someone kindly guide me through step-by-step please (from the point that the download finshed)?  Thanks in advance."
,avatar2012,2008-09-27T09:45Z,"Dont worry about being thick = knowledge comes with experience - not genius.
The ISO file (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image) is a compressed copy of the original CD.  Once you have taken it out of the zip file, some options are; (1) Burn the image onto a blank CD and then run the setup that is on the CD itself (- or if you are using Win XP, use the seperate setup file). (2) Using software like Daemon Tools or Power ISO, you can look inside the ISO file and remove just the video to watch (the video is an .avi file).
Problems may arise due to the rare codec used in these films, meaning that Win MP may not recognise the video stream - hence the reason for the seperate updated codec for XP systems.  Install that, and you should be able to watch the movie in Windows Media Player.
I recommend though, that you use the Motion Pixels Player that comes with the torrent (select the option for Hardware Scaling in the player setup) for optimal viewing experience.  Need more - merliina_x@yahoo.com :)"
,kchri,2011-05-11T11:00Z,Question: Do you need an XP platform in order to watch this? My machine is Windows 7. I can get the audio to work but no video shows in the file. I tried installing both the codec setup as well as the media pixels application setup (lot of junk!) but I still get the same result when playing the video file. thanks in advance for the help!
