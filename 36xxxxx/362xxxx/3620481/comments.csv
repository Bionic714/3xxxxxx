,himmelstrutz,2007-02-17T12:53Z,Thanks for this; I wanted to see it on the Gothenburg Film festival but I missed it.
,namrehs,2007-02-17T17:53Z,Are there any English subtitles?
,namrehs,2007-02-17T17:55Z,"Sorry - it looks like the poster said that it's in English. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476298/ says it
in Spanish. It looks too interesting to pass up a try."
,shoeshoe,2007-02-17T21:08Z,"Yeah, I'm gonna wait to hear if the subs are included with this before I download it."
,namrehs,2007-02-18T05:37Z,Yeah - I confirm that it's in Spanish.  I hope we get some subs soon b/c it looks great.
,shoeshoe,2007-02-19T11:13Z,Thanks for confirming namrehs.
