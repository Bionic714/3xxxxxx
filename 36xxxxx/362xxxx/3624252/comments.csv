Ah well, nevermind. Thanks for the correct links DataPumpHer."
,Softwarezer,2007-03-10T16:03Z,"Awesome work putting these torrents together. This of the greatest game music of all time, especially the Oblivion, Planescape: Torment and Halo tracks.

The karma gods must be very pleased."
,Threedots_dead,2007-03-20T21:58Z,"Indeed. Spread the gospel of the Planescape Music!!!
The Karma gods called me yesterday and said I should stop because I make them run out of points.
(OK, that´s enough of megalomania for one day)"

,Threedots_dead,2007-06-29T16:28Z,"Tanuss: My pleasure, but onfortunately that collection wasn´t complete, and I haven´t been able to find the full TW soundtracks. All the best songs are there though imo."

,DjinnKid2,2008-08-08T03:31Z,"I have compared, those music's are not Heroes of Might and Magic 2, nor are they from any of the Might and Magic games. I also did not hear them in any of the special sections, or in the material stock. They are something else."
