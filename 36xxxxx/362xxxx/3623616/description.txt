This is a one of a kind, masterpiece, six minutes long fan film from The Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess. A film not only with great editing but also wonderful music by Meat Loaf "I'd Do Anything for Love (but I Won't Do That)"

This fan film was created by recording material from the Nintendo Wii through a TV-adapter. I used material all though the game and focused on the lovelier scenes in the game.
