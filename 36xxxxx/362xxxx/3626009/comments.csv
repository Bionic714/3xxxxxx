,sin250,2007-02-27T15:48Z,"I will upload Lost series 2 Episodes 5-8 on the 8th January if this file is seeded succesfully. 
It's completely in your own hands seed and I will keep uploading Lost. 
Big thanks for the 2 who are seeding at the moment. Bollocks to the nasty git who Leeched and run.
The problem with older episodes being uploaded is hundreds do not want it just a few but that few really really want it so they tend to respect others by seeding. Then you get some kid runt arse who probably calls himself Zero Cool or Neo leeching and screwing us all over.
Guess thats life...   ;)
The point-------------PLAY NICE & PLEASE SEED..."
