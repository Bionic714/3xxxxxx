,Panodilo,2007-02-19T13:50Z,"Yes, it sure is, Zulzul. In the game you take on the role of feisty gook Icarus and wreak havoc from above with a kalashnikov."
,4X-AXG,2007-02-19T20:48Z,"haha Panodilo, you ain't seen nothing yet
I often post FS2004 addons under the name 'FS2004 Aircraft Add-On' or 'FS2004 Scenery Add-On' and people will ask me 'what is this' or 'do I need FS for this?' the level of dumbness amazes me on a daily basis..."

,belga1,2007-02-22T06:54Z,"amir_swe 
When you ""Packup"" those rar files ...the result is a ""image"".. :)
You MUST burn this ""image"" on a CD (use a burning utility as Nero ..or any other able to handle ""images"" files.
OR
Use a virtual drive as provided by Alcohol or Daemon Tool.
Capice ?????"
,Buck-Danny,2007-03-04T13:21Z,"Hello guys,
I try to burn the image with Nero, but it doesn't run the game
Afterwards, I try with Daemon tools (v.2.0): right mouse: virtual CD/DVD: Device 1: I entered the registre of the image, and a 2nd DVD player (is it correct?) appears.
I click but ""wrong disc inserted"".
Thx for answers ;) 
and sorry for my english :p"
,lancelot8080,2007-03-25T01:11Z,"helo i hav two question

,Bobadabub,2007-09-16T12:10Z,"Everything downloaded fine burned perfectly and installed, but when i try to run the game it says wrong disk inserted, is there any way around this?"
,Bobadabub,2007-09-16T12:28Z,"never mind figured it out, once everythings installed copy the WOV.exe from the hoodlum directory on the CD into the folder on the hard disk and it works =D"
,Mathew1990,2007-09-21T00:59Z,hey i cant find the crack where do i find it guys ?
,randomgy101,2008-12-24T22:35Z,"If we can get at least one person to seed until I finish downloading, I'll seed this 24/7"
,randomgy101,2008-12-25T03:01Z,Seed for God's sake...  I'm stuck at 81.7%....
,randomgy101,2008-12-25T07:43Z,"For all the idiots like me out there who just don't get it, how about including a decent fricken readme with step by step, so that all the morons out there(once again,like me)can get it installed"
