,uhura,2007-02-18T18:04Z,"Any version of Highlander: The Source that is currently available is not the final producers' version of the film. Peter Davis and Bill Panzer of Davis/Panzer Productions, the producers, in conjunction with Lionsgate Entertainment, are presently editing and remixing the film. This final cut will be delivered to Lionsgate on or about March 15, 2007.

Lionsgate will be releasing the film in September, 2007.
