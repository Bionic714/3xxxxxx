Synopsis:
Jal is not your average ghetto girl, nowhere near. But what?s the point of having the Young Musician of the Year competition within hands reach, if those around you don?t even notice? Jal?s problem is her dad - he may be Bristol?s answer to P Diddy, but when it comes to his daughter he?s lost the plot. Sid has got a big problem of his own - a problem who goes by the name of Mad Twatter. Mad T won?t rest until he?s got his hands on his drugs, his money or Sid and, as usual, Tony has left his best mate to take it on the chin - literally.
