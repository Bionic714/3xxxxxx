 You say if you were Kollll you would not bother uploading. I just ran a check on what you have bothered to upload and you were right you don't bother to uploaded anything.
Don't get me wrong I hav'nt either but I appreciate the fact that Kollll does. Sometimes they are great sometimes ordinary but Kollll is consistant and early.
If you don't contribute don't complain or hav'nt they taught you that at school yet.
If you are still looking for a DVD copy try mpaa.com

Thanks Kollll"

This has never occured to me before, and I'm skilled at computers. I think it must be Windows Vista's fault, not the seven mediaplayers I've tried.. Any ideas?"
