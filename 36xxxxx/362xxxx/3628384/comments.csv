,rustydanielle,2009-01-18T04:58Z,"Its pretty simple acually. THIS WILL WORK!!! It worked GREAT for me!  Just do these steps exacly, and it will work for sure.
  mount the cd image (the crack i guess) 
 goto the cracked folder. there should be two applications one for the cd key generator and another for the crack. the crack is the bottom exe file.now copy the crack then goto c:program files\ea games\the sims 2 seasons\tsbin. now all u have to do is right click and scroll down to paste, the should be something that automatically asks you if you would like to copy and replace, click this option. next open up your game and there you go you should be able to play.   I saw how frusterated you all were, and I was too, So I found this out, and now im posting it to help you all out!"

,CoolSims,2010-07-30T13:16Z,"If PirateBay sever says that user who provides this is trusted, I don't see why you all say that links are either broken or fake?

I downloaded this link months and months ago, and I'm pretty sure it contains no viruses whatsoever. Game works properly and has no crashes. Download speed is great (103.4kB/s).

Thanks for sharing :)"
,CoolSims,2010-07-30T19:18Z,"Ok, I might have screwed up a bit with my last comment. I get an error, but different from what others get.

When I try to unzip (whatsoever) the files, I get message that they weren't extracted correctly. I tried to mount image, to unzip .iso file and start it with setup - won't start.

Help?"
,ChaseUbito,2010-08-26T22:59Z,Is there anyway to make this 1440x1280? or any bigger res? It looks ugly on my screen..
,LadyAshlie,2011-01-30T22:05Z,"I realize this is sort of an older torrent and no one may check it anymore, but I've tried to download this (as well as another version of Seasons on here) and while they both work really well for the most part, I have the same issue with the both of them, and I assume this is a post-Bon Voyage issue dealing with Securom, maybe. But the game installs perfectly, up until the very end when it says ""The game will now check to make sure everything is updated."" I click OK and a box in the background pops up that says Apartment Life, but the box itself is white, and a new box pops up saying ""An error has occurred in the installation. The game will now uninstall"" and it does exactly as it says it will.

Does anyone know what may be causing this/a fix to it? I've tried installing without internet turned on, as well, and I have no idea. I've never encountered this sort of error with the games before. :/ All help is appreciated. "
