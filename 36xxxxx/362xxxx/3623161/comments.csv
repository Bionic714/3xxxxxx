,TrentDavey,2007-02-21T20:21Z,Seems like a lot of duplication in the utilities. How many web browsers or undelete utilities do you need?
,hlse,2007-02-21T22:11Z,Isn't great to have a choice ? Pick one !
,vkp1970,2007-02-28T21:17Z,"Hi. As the original uploader I just wanna let people know that I'm stopping seeding in a few days. So one or two of the 138 people who have downloaded it should step up and seed a bit... :-). Well, I can dream a little, can't I?.

Sorry about the 'trackerless' sentence. It was before I understood how this torrent/tracker thing worked.. :-)

Info about direct ISO download and request for burning of the CD and physical mailing is available on this page: 

http://www.pricelesswarehome.org/2007/2007PL-CD-about.php

Or just ask in the newsgroup 'alt.comp.freeware newsgroup' and will start seeding again."
