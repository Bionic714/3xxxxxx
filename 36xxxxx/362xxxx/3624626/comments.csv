""Metallica - We all love Ennio Morricone - The Ecstasy Of Gold

Track 5 of Album: We All Love Ennio Morricone.""

Its from a album containing covers of Morricone,  done by various artists: Including Metallica

The new Metallica album is probably out sometime in the early fall"

,Nizzwe,2007-03-01T18:22Z,Metallica rules!! \m/ \m/.. Nizzwe was here..
,Rid.Iculo.Us,2007-05-01T14:06Z,"Thx, Breadfan,  a good quality torrent!"
,NeVeR2DiE,2007-12-07T15:59Z,"Good music,thx for sharing!"
,p121213,2008-02-19T02:53Z,"Metallica should not be downloaded! The greatest band in the world should get the money and respect they deserve, besides there is much better quality on the cd's"
,VenomOfRivia,2008-03-27T13:56Z,why not the whole album? i cannot find it anywhere to buy it. i download only the ones i cannot find. please put the whole album breadfan866
,ravenheart1982,2008-06-21T23:46Z,"This is riddled with skips and flaws. It's not Metallica missing notes, this is a terribly encoded mp3. Hopefully at some point someone will seed a clean version."
,Breadfan866,2008-08-27T12:14Z,"@VenomOfRivia:
This was only a tribute song for Ennio Morricone. On the whole album of this song there are only non-Metallica songs from other bands who are covering Ennio Morricone. You can find it on Isohunt.com I think. Album is called: ""We all love Ennio Morricone"".

@ravenheart1982:
Are you sure you downloaded the file properly? Because I don't have any skips or anything in the file and I have listened to it a lot.

Okay, I compared the file sizes of 'my file' in Winamp and 'this file' and it seems that the is a little difference, so I will upload it once more."
,Breadfan866,2008-08-27T13:13Z,"_______________________________________
