,markhamm,2008-03-01T14:25Z,"Subtitles show when I play the mp4, but when i try recording to DVD (tried TMP, Nero and ConvertXtoDVD) there are NO subtitles!!!

This is driving me crazy, help please........"

,gelbherz,2008-03-28T17:51Z,"WTF? I can't get subs to show up in windows media player, vlc, quicktime, or realplayer. 

Whatta load of horse shit!"
,gelbherz,2008-03-28T17:55Z,"But it is quite good quality, just a little blocky in bland scenes, like undersea or foggy sky. Typical."
,michaelrwatson,2008-11-24T05:40Z,"The subtitles DO work---you just have to find the right player!! VLC Player 0.9.6 (latest ver.) plays them but you have to manually enable them in one of the vlc menus. On the other hand, i could not get them to play in QuickTime Player, although there may be a way.

Quality is very watchable. Keep in mind that it's a looong movie. Nice rip--Thanks!"
,jordack,2009-06-11T04:37Z,"still fucking gay, who even uses vlc, this is the only movie out of about 50 movies ive downloaded where the subs dont work."
,SilasMo,2009-08-14T10:30Z,"You're such a breeder, jordack.  vlc rocks.

Stupid breeder."

,RogueTrooper7,2009-09-08T20:02Z,"jordack get back to  spankin of at kiddie porn u spotty cunt.
Fab movie, VLC Rocks :)"
,chengfongfai,2009-10-03T17:37Z,vlc or whatever.. subs dont work at all
,gaston_pinamar,2009-10-07T16:24Z,"Good video quality but the sound is a little bit quiet, you would have to turn the volume good up.
The subs ARE working. With VLC go to ""Video"", ""Subtitles Track"" and choose Track1 for Dansk or Track2 for English. They are embedded in the Das Boot (D.C.).mp4 file. Thanks!"
,Falkkon,2009-10-30T01:06Z,"VLC Works fine. It's been shown above how to get it work so I won't go into that, but on top of reading just about every video format, it's FREE (and not free as in ""I got it from TP"" free).

I got this to work on DVD without any hassle. Drag to ConvertxtoDVD3, and check your subtitles. Both Danish and English should be there, I happened to right click Danish and remove it so when I push my audio options button on the remote, English subs pop on. 

Doesn't get much easier than that."
,hagriddenrules,2009-12-23T13:30Z,"Great quality for a 3hrs movie.
in fact not even an hour long movie sized 1 gb is nearer to this in quality."
,hagriddenrules,2009-12-23T13:31Z,Man plz upload some more classic movies in this way.
,werte22,2010-01-08T14:16Z,"Excellent quality,thank you"
