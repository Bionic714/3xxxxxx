James Herriot
All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1, Disc 4 (DVD)

In 1937, a young, newly-qualified surgeon arrives in the picturesque village of Darrowby to take up his first job in the established veterinary practice of Sigfried and Tristan Farnon. But in rural Yorkshire, with few medicines available, the treatment of sick animals still seems to be rooted in the Dark Ages. This, together with the country-folk's inherent suspicion of strangers, poses problems for James Herriot in the early years of his career.
