Ultrabots is one of the best DOS games made. It\\\'s the precursor to all the mech games.

You control one or more \\\"Mech\\\'s\\\" in a series of battles. The action takes place like a flight sim, where you pilot the bot from the cockpit.

All manual etc... are included.

Just UnRar and install with DOSBOX (Just enter DOSBOX into google), it will install under WinXP, but runs very slowly.

Have Fun!
