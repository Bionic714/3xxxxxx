,bass_hit,2008-10-20T13:35Z,"Hey there folks,

I had posted this video originally under my cruelmemory member name and now, almost 2 years later, I need to get this torrent back up and going again.

I lost the original file so I need to get a copy. If I really need to I can get the original project files in iMovie and re-export them but this torrent needs to come back!

I had also posted this video on YouTube around the same time (Feb. 2007) and NOW (Oct 20, YouTube about it and it is now being blocked.

If possible, seed please. If not, I will re-release the torrent with information in the torrent, video and copyright dispute.

Thanks all."
