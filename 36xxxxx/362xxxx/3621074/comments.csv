,DeShon,2007-09-20T18:47Z,Anyone feel bad about stealing the Bible?
,Speedlad,2007-12-07T00:23Z,"Just wanna say this is a great project.
Dont really care if you're gonna flame me for posting such a comment, but regardless if you believe in something or not the Bible is a huge part of the history and the most important collection of literature from that time. Disregarding it like any rebelling 14 year old is simply immature or disrespectful to the hundreds of historians working with the documents.
I personally believe in deeper meaning behind it, and think this is a great initiative.
If it turns out to be as good as people say it is, I will definately buy the collection. Feels better to support the project and have the physical product aswell :D"

Thanks!"
,markiewarkie,2008-02-09T15:54Z,"Great audio, highly entertaining fiction .
Can't believe that there are so many highly talented and gifted famous people that are nieve and gullible enough to put their time to this but I am glad they did as our culture and behaviour is based entirely on  the world's biggest lie which is fundimentally good, despite the Church being the most evil institution known to man. 
Had Constantine not rocked the world by being the first person ever to suggest Jesus was immortal in 325AD destroying any testiment that suggested otherwise then the New Testiment could be considered believable despite it's thousands of contradictions. 

Can someone do the more believable Old Testiment rather than a prophet and his highly exaggerated magic tricks ?"

,physixmaster,2008-02-20T23:57Z,"Tis a great work of fiction. Not to offend but has anyone got the opposite of this the one that states the facts and what really happened? Like the fact that noah's ark would need to be bigger than the whole of europe to contain every animal in existance at the time, and food to keep them alive oh and about 100yrs to build if you had say 50,000 men at hand. But that aside it has to be given credit to have survived this long though history has shown it was through questionable means.  Really I just wanted to say that a more light harted approach should be taken toward this as we enter into a more technological age as  with science advancing at the rate it is it won't be long before there will be just too many facts to ignore and brush aside in the face of belief. Like whats gods take on Aphophis, you can't say that doesn't exist and in 2029 the whole of europe will just need to glance skyward and look for a fast moving object just slightly dimmer than the north star to witness it and it has the potential to WIPE US OUT only the potential not for sure but still if it goes through the keyhole then a few years later we will be feeling it! so, in face of complete anihilation...WHERE'S GOD?"
,Binary-Data,2008-03-20T03:15Z," The First Council of Nicaea was the first of two ecumenical councils of the early Christian church, held at Nicaea (now Iznik, Turkey), in Asia Minor. (The Second Council of Nicaea was in 787.) The Council of 325 a.d. was convened by the Roman emperor Constantine for the purpose of settling the dispute over Arianism, a heresy that denied the full divinity of Christ. Arius, the doctrine?s author, had been trained at the theological school of Lucian at Antioch. Many other supporters of Arianism had also studied there, which suggests that Arius was actually distilling ideas commonly held at Antioch. He was ordained as a priest in Alexandria, but there became involved in a controversy with his bishop (Bishop Alexander) over the relation between Jesus, the ?Son? of God, and God himself, the ?Father.?

Arius believed that the Son could not be God in the same sense that God the Father was, and that the Son was not generated from the divine, eternal substance of the Father, but rather was created out of nothing as were all of God?s other creatures. Those who leaned toward the view of Christ as existing only by the will of God felt that recognition of God?s transcendence would be undermined by the theological view that Christ was consubstantial with God the Father.

But by the fourth century, the Christian church was already fairly well organized and distinctly intolerant of any ?incorrect? practice of Christianity. Although there was as yet no empire-wide church government, there was an approximate unity among the districts on matters of teaching and ritual practice.

In 324 a.d., Constantine defeated and eliminated his eastern co-emperor, emerging as the sole emperor of Rome. He had already extended his patronage to Christianity within his own part of the empire, and he viewed the schism over the Arian heresy as a threat not only to the church itself, but also to the civil and political unity of the empire.

Bishop Alexander had excommunicated Arius over their theological dispute, but many bishops continued to support him. In order to heal the schism, Constantine summoned all the bishops of the church to a council at Nicaea in 325. Of the 1800 bishops in the Roman Empire, about 300 showed up. (The number is traditionally given as 319, but there is some doubt as to the authenticity of that count.)

The First Council of Nicaea opened with Constantine?s plea for peace, followed by an opening address given by Eusebius of Caesarea, one of Constantine?s most influential ecclesiastical advisors. Eusebius was himself suspected of sympathizing with the Arian heresy, and in later years Constantine, under the influence of a number of pro-Arian advisors, would call other councils to readmit Arius, who was excommunicated by the First Council and exiled to Illyria, and to condemn Athanasius, Alexander?s successor as Bishop of Alexandria.

The council was held at Nicaea because Constantine had moved the seat of civil government from Rome to Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople. Constantine provided transportation and housing for the attending bishops, and despite evidence that he might have harbored Arian sympathies himself, he implemented the Council?s decisions, including the exile of Arius.

In settling the dispute over Arianism, the First Council also adopted a creed--a confession of orthodox faith--that all Christians would be required to assent to. This Nicene Creed was enforced by the state as well by the church. In addition to banishing Arius, the Council also banished the only two bishops who refused to sign this creed.

The Nicene Creed, which with some minor modifications is still recited in Catholic and Anglican (Church of England) worship services, is as follows:

""I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus Christ His Son, the only begotten of the Father, God of God, Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten not made, being of the same substance with the Father, through whom all things were made both in Heaven and on Earth; who "
,Binary-Data,2008-03-20T03:19Z,"It is very important to clarify exactly what role the Emperor Constantine played in the Council of Nicea, what the purpose for the council was, what happened at Nicea, and briefly how the canon (the Bible as we know it) was formed. Constantine was a Roman Emperor who lived from 274 to 337 A.D. He is most famous for becoming the single ruler of the Roman Empire (after deceiving and defeating Licinius, his brother-in-law) and supposedly converting to Christianity. It is debated whether or not Constantine was actually a believer (according to his confessions and understanding of the faith) or just someone trying to use the church and the faith to his own advantage. Constantine called the Council of Nicea (which was the first general council of the Christian church, 325 A.D.) primarily because he feared that disputes within the church would cause disorder within the empire. The dispute in mind was Arianism, which was the belief that Jesus was a created being. The famous phrase they were disputing was, ""There was when He was not."" This was in reference to Jesus and was declared heretical by the council and thus resulted in the following words about Christ in the Nicene Creed: ""God from true God?from the Father?not made."" It was determined by the council that Christ was homoousia (meaning, one substance with the Father).

Concerning manuscripts that were burned at the order of Constantine, there is really no mention of such a thing actually happening at the order of Constantine or at the Council of Nicea. The Arian party's document (about Christ being a creature) was abandoned by them because of the strong resistance to it and was torn to shreds in the sight of everyone present at the council (see Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology). Constantine (and the Council of Nicea, for that matter) had virtually nothing to do with the forming of the canon. It was not even discussed at Nicea. The council that formed an undisputed decision on the canon took place at Carthage in 397 (60 years after Constantine's death). However, long before Constantine, 21 books were acknowledged by all Christians (the 4 Gospels, Acts, 13 Paul, 1 Peter, 1 John, Revelation). There were 10 disputed books (Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2-3 John, Jude, Ps-Barnabas, Hermas, Didache, Gospel of Hebrews) and several that most all considered heretical (Gospels of Peter, Thomas, Matthaias, Acts of Andrew, John, etc.)

Liberal scholars and fictional authors like to purport the idea that the gospels of Thomas and Peter (and other long-disputed books) contain truths that the church vehemently stomped out; but that simply has no basis historically. It is closer to the truth to say that no serious theologians really cared about these books because they were obviously written by people lying about authorship and had little basis in reality. That is one reason why a council declaring the canon was so late in coming (397) because the books that were trusted and the ones that had been handed down were already widely known."

Helpless children fooled by parents and society to believe there faith..... All religions are fairytales, sure they have all some good morale rules. But have we not evolved beyond all this crap and have laws to guide us to do the right thing. And finally you retarded shitheads who hate people with a different religion than yours, can´t you just pretend its the same god you are praying to and stop fighting about it in your gods name and all that bullshit.

,laracroft3k9,2009-04-16T20:44Z,"i thought at first being a little god fearing that it is wrong to get such things for free or btter say to pirate it, but thinking about it deeply or as i thought about it in a broader way, i think there's nothing wrong in having good intentions to spread the word of god where people can access it more easily and be inspired by it, so that the word of our god will be widely known, specially for those who have every intention of supporting its publishers but is just finding it hard to evn fit their budget for a day. but of course being god fearing they know very well that they shouldn't hurt any1s feelings in any way, and i know being inspired by god the publishers of this particular multimedia did not create this to earn profit from it for their bnefit but their definitely doing this for a good cause. so those who created, shared and those who wanted this so bad all has good intentions in their hearts, and those who created this if not for the high cost (of everything...) of creating such thing as this, wud be wanting to inspire people w/o any costs, and those who have a budget for this or those who were able to save money for this would definitely buy it instead of trying to get this for free, coz we were thought not to offend but love, the people who are using the name of god for their own advantage doesnt really know god for sure, and what would the author of these scriptures in the bible get from writing it, considering that during those times some countries doesn't approve or doesn't want to acknowledge the true god... anyway there are things that cannot just be taken literally it helps if well always keep an open mind..
