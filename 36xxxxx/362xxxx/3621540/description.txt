Doom 3 Ultimate includes "Doom 3 & Doom 3: RoE" plus many (now old) extras! 
This ISO is created by me, it has been confirmed to work mulitple times! 

In the name of God - Read... below:

(Ignore this if you want and look for: **UPDATE 20/Nov/2010**) 

Ok good community (even those with less patients), I think the best way is to share with us all the good experience from those who got the game to work... even if someone has wrote the same solution once, the more the merrier. 

Plz there's no need to write anything else, even your appreciations are shown through your accomplishment of getting it to work ;) Share it!! 

I will yet again start to upload it myself since it was ages ago I created this torrent, many things have changed, the newer patches may block some things and not make it to work as the day I played the game. 

But think like this: at least you have the best source for the game for free!!!, after that you may choose with your own experience how to make it work, feel free to ignore my dated Extras inside the ISO but it will give good ideas of what Extras to get newer versions of ;) 

Ps! Don't allow the game to communicate with the internet, any game for that matter if the pirated version is not made for online play.. its unnecessary and may give you problems to tackle.. Try first to install all of the "games" (both Doom 3 and RoE) as if it where originally bought before you try out any crack/edit or any illegal horse shit :P... take care and Peace! salam aleykom!

(Ignore this if you want and look for: **UPDATE 20/Nov/2010**)

I've successfully downloaded and installed the game... even played it using the same ISO which I created long ago, with same stuff inside "Extras" folder. 
"I use Windows Vista, HP laptop PC" 

1. Install both Doom 3 and RoE, insert the serials as they are being requested (they can be found both inside the "Extras" folder or read one of the members comments for the serial).

2. After you finished then take the "1.3 update" included and install it (there may be newer but im satisfied with the one i've got and this's NOT the 1.3.1 update).

3. Just to be sure I used compatibility mode for "WinXP Service Pack 2" and finally started the game... voila!! (make sure you cut off internet connection for the game.. note! I even used the Doom 3 crack included to get rid of the request for serial inside the game) Enjoy!!!

**UPDATE 20/Nov/2010** 

I cannot type the -backslash- letter when describing folders on piratebay... 
I will type it as * instead like this: * 

And my Computer is a 2008 model HP Laptop, now with Windows 7 32bit.

Remember! The tools located in the ISO such as the DirectX and Daemon tools are old by now, try to download the updates for the tools in the folder: Extras*Doom 3 - Tools 

I now deactivate my McAfee Anti-Virus Plus and will terminate my internet connection. 

Successfully located and mounted with Daemon tools at "UNIT 0:" DOOM3_ULTIMATE.iso 
and I ran the Autorun.exe (it can be started automatically if your Windows settings allow it).  

But I quit the Autorun.exe so I could instead start it with compatibility mode of Windows XP (just to be on the safe side). 

It should be located by "seeing" hidden files and then just search the main folder for that file and it will show up three of them, at least what it did to me... 

I have now clicked install and now it prompts me for the CD Key, it is located at: Extras*Doom 3 - Key & Crack*Doom 3 Keygen.EXE 

So thank God the CD Key entered appears to be valid and they will never ask me for it again... we shall see to it!  

During install I felt the urge to change the destination folder in the HDD (not start-menu) for a more preferred one. 

Now it has begun the installation... 

At the end of installation, I created a shortcut on desktop, I didn't want to register and I didn't install the DirectX. 

Now it went back to the Autorun.exe, just quit it now (don't play the game yet!). 
________________________________________

Try like I did, mount the next file with a new unit in daemon tools at "UNIT 1:" 

Successfully located and mounted the Doom 3 - Resurrection of Evil.iso located in Extras*Doom 3 - Resurrection of Evil and I ran the Autorun.exe (it can be started automatically if your Windows settings allow it). 

But I quit the Autorun.exe so I could instead start it with compatibility mode of Windows XP (just to be on the safe side). 

It should be located by "seeing" hidden files and then just search the main folder for that file and it will show up three of them, at least what it did to me... 

I have now clicked install and now it prompts me for the CD Key, it is located at: Extras*Doom 3 - Resurrection of Evil*Doom 3 - Resurrection of Evil - Serials.txt 

The serial I chose from within the text is labeled: "For the installation". 

So thank God the Serial entered appears to be valid and they will never ask me for it again... we shall see to it! 

After just click next and it will start to patch the original Doom 3 before installing Resurrection of Evil. 

When it is done it will automatically go back to the prior installation. 

It asked me for the directional folder I wanted in the start-menu, so I felt the urge to change that to this time around: "Destination Folder:  Doom 3*Resurrection of Evil" 

Now it has begun the installation... 

At the end of installation, I created a shortcut on desktop and I didn't install the DirectX. 

Now it went back to the Autorun.exe, just quit it now (don't play the game yet!).

Wow now that is done, I located and installed the patch of 1.3 (this is not any patch above 1.3(0)... NO IT IS NOT THE INFAMOUS 1.3.1 !! 

Anyways it is located at: Extras*Doom 3 - Update*Doom 3 v1_3.exe 

Finally I also applied the Infamous CRACK... Yes! I did. 

It is located at: Extras*Doom 3 - Key & Crack*DOOM3.EXE 
Use it by overwriting the original, do a backup before if you will... I didn't.

Congratulations Driss! Both games work out perfectly, even by dbl-clicking the shortcunt from your desktop :) 

Definition of "work out perfectly": They don't bother me for serial or any crap, just make sure not to let the both games sense or know that the internet exists!
