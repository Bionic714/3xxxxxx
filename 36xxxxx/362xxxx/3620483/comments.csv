I watched this movie recently. It was OK, but ultimately disappointing in that it presented a shallow view of how someone goes from promising a promising youngster to a desperate adult."

,Amerialb,2007-02-18T19:13Z,"Best movie of the year.

I have no clue as to what ""promising a promising youngster"" means or were in the movie this might be, but it wasn't in this movie."
