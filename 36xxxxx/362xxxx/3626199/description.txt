I posted this torrent on mininova a little over a week ago, so I decided to post it here too.

These versions of the Harry Potter books are complete and very polished. I read through them multiple times, and editing them on the way, so there are few errors, and any errors, which will be a very small amount, will probably go unnotcied. I used multiple sources of each book to get the correct content, but as previous stated, there will probably be some very small errors, and I doubt anyone will notice them since I haven\'t on multiple read throughs.

These are the US versions of all six Harry Potter books. I also added chapters to all of the books for easier navigation.

Once again, these are very polished and clean copies of the six Harry Potter books, without a doubt the best copies of these books you will find on the internet... So please enjoy and share them.
