,jAf,2007-02-21T20:20Z,"i have this from a private torrent site, its the real official multiplayer beta
played 5mins before, runs better than the beta before"
,Eroing,2007-02-21T21:18Z,Is this a multiplayer add-on for Stalker so you need a key? Or have you added a keygen or something nice in the torrent?
,jAf,2007-02-21T21:39Z,"@Eroing

,yog_,2007-02-21T22:07Z,"It says ""Invalid CD-Key"" when i try to connect to any servers... Help?

I used the auth-key i got from fileplanet..."
,yog_,2007-02-21T22:36Z,"Yeah i have alredy done that and got a mail with a account-key, it still wont work."
,ConanDLibrarian,2007-02-21T23:58Z,"I'm not sure if something has changed but I already had an account, logged in, and clicked the link to get the key for the dl and it doesnt work. Says its closed, I still put my e-mail in the box it gave just in case it was glitched, and still nothing. I'm not sure whats goin on. I also went to the tinyurl and it brought something up about a key distribution and i did that then it brings me to the main fileplanet page....im not sure what im doing wrong.

help pls lol"
,bltsponger,2007-02-22T00:01Z,"Ok, I also had some problems at first with getting the CD key to work.  Try entering the CD Key, then pressing enter.  Also, try making all the letters in uppercase or lowercase.   

offtopic: jAf, you forgot to credit me for this :P"
,Jiimpa_,2007-02-22T00:02Z,"DAH! The key wont work cuz it's already in use by the ""original"" user (who probably won it in the competition)..."
,agent_9000,2007-02-22T01:37Z,how do you get a beta key? the tinyurl link just goes right back to fileplanet...
,arctic89,2007-02-22T01:47Z,"Damn beat me to uploading this torrent, lol i'll seed too.. ya i got it from fileplanet and yes at horendous speeds...

,bltsponger,2007-02-22T17:50Z,"Sorry, bad news for everyone who missed out.  This was a momentary exploit in Fileplanet where you could get a beta key with a free account instead of having to use a payed one.  People who got it in time got it, people who didn't are outa luck.  "
,jonlfc,2007-02-22T18:39Z,Is this the hole game?
,jonlfc,2007-02-22T18:40Z,is it the hole game?
,arctic89,2007-02-22T21:19Z,"yea the exploit was good for like 12hrs or so where free accs can gain a key.. if you missed it oh well, play with yourself


@jonlfc
no its not the whole game, like jaf said

""and follow the instructions and open ur eyes^^""

the title states MP-beta and its only 445mb you really think its the whole game?? think again..
"
,Hideaki,2007-02-23T05:56Z,"The game runs fine, but I can't even create a server to mess around with or play on LAN. I get an invalid CD-Key error no matter what. Is there any way to work around this? It's no longer possible to get CD-Keys from fileplanet."
,Hideaki,2007-02-23T06:02Z,"I was able to get in-game by using the Stalker MP DS shortcut. You can only mess around with it though, I doubt LAN will work."
,Arabking,2007-02-23T14:58Z,"Hideaki: Got same problems myself, but I heard there will be a public beta out someday next week so you don't have to delete it. "
,Andrei68,2007-02-23T22:41Z,"The Beta looks good, I like the lightning effects.
Now I'm gonna echo the words of others here, I've tried editing the file in relation to the cd key but still I get an error no cd key, So LAN looks out for me, Hideaki is correct the only way in is through the DS shortcut, Anyway nice preview
Cheers"
