Movie Info:

In Venice Beach, naive Midwesterner JB (Black) bonds with local
slacker KG (Glass) and they form the rock band Tenacious D.
Setting out to become the world\\\\\\\'s greatest band is no easy feat,
so they set out to steal what could be the answer to their
prayers -- a magical guitar pick housed in a rock-and-roll
museum some 300 miles away.
