,Himlabein,2007-02-28T19:53Z,"ved en feil ble det lastet ned en ny variant av windows genuine advantage validation fra microsoft her i går eller forrigår. Nå er jeg igjen tilbak ei steinalderen (hvis det kan kalles det pga feil validering) 

Etter å ha kopiert disse filene til system32 katalogen, skjer det igjenting. Jeg restarter og ingen forbedring... 

I tillegg har jeg kjørt Search&Destroy etter omstarten og da finner den en del windows valideringsfiler som den tar å setter i karantene... 


Noen som har gode tips?"
