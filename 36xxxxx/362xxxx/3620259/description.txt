SUBBERS   INFO:

Added custom perfect synchronized and quality (medium size) subtitles.         
Removed the FOX TV logo from the right corner during the encoding with CCE.      
We have nothing against their logo, but the subtitles are more visible without it. 
The sample was build as ISO image, if you want to check the subtitles.
