,Suggs,2007-03-02T12:43Z,"eh! I have downloaded 2,6 GB and still missing 2MB even though I dl w/ 95 Kb/s...... ??????"
,mantix,2007-03-06T21:51Z,"Nothing is wrong. THINK - If there is any problem, then how come it has been DL 2150 times. And by the way... i'm still seeding."
,mantix,2007-03-07T22:21Z,Suppedraken pls answer this: Peerguardian is now installed. Is the solution to avoid this problem making a new torrent file for this video? - or what to do ? Any suggestions.
,AnotherStranger,2008-10-27T00:45Z,I'll have a try and let you know the result...
,AnotherStranger,2008-10-30T04:19Z,"VTS_01_1.VOB is corrupted. I managed to watch the video, but there is no sound.

VTS_01_2.VOB is fine though, so you get about half the concert. Can't believe they subtitled the lyrics (in Danish)!"
,AnotherStranger,2008-10-30T05:34Z,"Now this is extremely weird - I took a chance and burned the whole lot to DVD - and my standalone DVD player played it all without any problems!! And, VLC could play it as well, although it couldn't play it from the harddrive! Guess Nero did some wonders to it while burning...

So, many thanks for a great upload!
