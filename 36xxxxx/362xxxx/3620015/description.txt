Closing night Las Vegas Hilton on September, 2 - 1974
Released in 1996 by Fort Baxter

Considered by some as one of Elvis' worst shows, here we see the King open is heart on stage as he never did before and would do after... with Priscilla and Lisa-Marie in the audience, Elvis will talk about his divorce, his numerous girlfriends, his music, his karate and break loose about his drug abuse rumours.

It's extremely revealing and eye opening and incredible. This is REQUIRED listening for any Elvis fan.

It's a 2 CDs set, here in WMA 192 KBps.
