Synopsis: Hollow Man 2 takes place some time after the original film. Michael Griffin (Christian Slater), an American soldier, is administered an experimental drug which will render him invisible. (The drug is based on the research seen in the first film.) Griffin is assured that he will be given a "buffer" which will allow him to become visible again. But, he's lied to and no such buffer is given. Enraged, Griffin is now searching for the scientists involved in the procedure hoping that one can supply the buffer. After Dr. Villiers (John Shaw) is murdered, the authorities assume that Dr. Maggie Dalton (Laura Regan) will be Griffin's next target. Police detective Frank Turner (Peter Facinelli) is assigned to protect Maggie. When an attempt on her life is made and a police officer is killed, Turner begins to realize that Maggie is in serious danger and he proceeds to hide her. But, how can one hide from an assailant that one can't see?
