,gurugt705,2007-02-19T06:33Z,thanx...this is a great episode
,opposite,2007-02-19T10:14Z,im up to 2000kb/s... insane!
,Opera_of_Death,2007-02-19T11:48Z,"Thanx :)

Kollll could you upload the new episode of American Dad here too??? It's 2HD that has released it... Please!!!"
,kango99,2007-03-04T01:00Z,"Yeah, I'm another one who never got why these ""scene"" fuckwits keep mislabeling seaons and indeed episodes to confuse everyone. Not just this, but other torrents too.

But Worse, much, much worse and even more fuckwittier, WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH THE RAR'S??

If you retarded h@ck3R-k1dd13 dudes want to play around on usenet, then go fucking do it. 
This is BITTORRENT......B.I.T.T.O.R.R.E.N.T (in case you are distraced by your latest ""trek"" episode open in another window). It is specially and deliberately designed for distrubuting large files that people can watch, listen to and use whatever the fuck way they want whilst STILL SEEDING. You fucking misfit morons are actually hurting torrent speed and it's time to wise up. 

It's getting more than a little fucking pathetic."
,chandler9222,2007-03-10T19:34Z,Kango you knob
,torpsta1,2007-06-09T11:18Z,thanks dude
,SoundWall,2008-03-11T10:56Z,"Episode 11 isn't out yet, so this is either mislabeled like kango says or it's fake.
Also it is indeed annoying with rar files."
,natanaelcd,2008-03-21T09:17Z,FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,vuoto,2008-03-24T19:54Z,"I like the fact that these avi files are archived into RARs.  It makes it a little harder for my ISP to try to filter my bandwidth and throttle me down because I'm downloading a big media file.

What, does it take all of 15 seconds to un-rar the files?  You've got something more important to do while sitting in your Mom's basement waiting to watch a freaking cartoon?  Let's be honest, if you had a job you could afford the 25 bucks a month for cable TV and a TIVO.

Maybe you ought to just shut up and be grateful that someone is putting this all together for you.

Thanks, kollll.  Some of us appreciate what you are doing."
,cascadeorca,2008-04-05T10:10Z,"This is not the right episode, FAKE."
,Kabu_the_DC,2008-04-09T11:17Z,"this is season 5 episode 11 morron, if you idiots are not sure about labeling, check wikipedia episode listings or something..."
,_JustSomeGuy_,2008-04-15T03:44Z,"Un-raring the files isn't a big deal.  The problem is that, in order to watch/use the file and continue seeding, you need two copies of it.  That means a lot of people who *would* have seeded had it not been rared won't.

Rar is great for usenet and irc, but doesn't really have a place in the bittorrent community.

P.S.  Insulting people isn't exactly a great way to  make your point . . ."
,The_Harvester,2008-04-26T17:38Z,"lol nah, 100 little rar files is good but not the best, there is beter! 100 little rars with 100 little zips inside. I guess it aint easy living with permanent acne."
,danzigod,2008-04-30T09:31Z,I was told the seasons were different outside the U.S. Plus episode 11 must have aired already b/c it's up on fartoons.org.
,danzigod,2008-04-30T10:09Z,...this however is not season 6 episode 11.
,ymir3719,2008-05-03T22:04Z,this is season 6 in europe i know that because i have season 5 on dvd and this episode isn't on it 
,crapshitname,2008-05-31T02:38Z,Whats with the rar?? You already made your fucking name in the header compressed files will be uncompressed and removed for space.
