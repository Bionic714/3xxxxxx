,fosterfoxtrot,2008-05-23T21:21Z,why are the subtitles so dark
,dean10003,2008-11-01T07:02Z,"Do I have to do anything to see the subtitles. I'm not seeing them. I do have the .idx and .sub files, though. Do all media players know to look for these when playing .avi files? Thanks."
,EmptyDoor,2008-11-23T17:24Z,You could try something like VLC player if the subs don't work.

,cccp1992,2011-03-14T12:07Z,"Thank you, EmptyDoor. Films like this are very rare and not easy to find. 
The subs worked fine on my pc. I recommend VLC if your subs didnt work."
,indiaman,2011-11-14T18:06Z,"Thanks for this great movie.In VLC ,the sub-titles are in grey-black and hence a bit difficult to read but you can with some effort."
