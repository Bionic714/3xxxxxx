Getting this monster to work in both dos and windows is a pain.
Here\'s a hint how it might look in the autoexec.bat (no entry in config.sys)

SET PATH=C:\\GUS
SET INTERWAVE=C:\\GUS\\IW.INI
C:\\GUS\\GETIWENV.EXE > C:\\GUS\\SETIWENV.BAT
CALL C:\\GUS\\SETIWENV.BAT


Doing like that, It won\'t use any base memory. :D
