,Emod,2007-02-22T09:55Z,"Ok, I don't know where the double slashes came from in the description..  I also posted the wrong startup files, here's what it should look like:

Config.sys:
DEVICE=C:\GUS\IWINIT.EXE ID=GRV00001 INTERWAVE=C:\GUS\IW.INI

autoexec.bat:
SET ULTRADIR=C:\GUS
SET INTERWAVE=C:\GUS\IW.INI
SET IWDIR=C:\GUS
C:\GUS\IWINIT.EXE
C:\GUS\GETIWENV.EXE > C:\GUS\SETIWENV.BAT
CALL C:\GUS\SETIWENV.BAT

Still won't use base (or any) memory."
