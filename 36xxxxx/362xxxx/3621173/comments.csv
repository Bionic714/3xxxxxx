[T],TheSkaffer,2007-03-09T12:15Z,"For all You guys not able to burn this on one DVD-9:

Burn one dvd containing all setup files and CABS-files 1-8. Burn another with the rest of the CABS. 

Installing the game it will ask for the location of the Cabs. Just insert the next DVD and the installation will continue.

All NoCD/DVD cracks work from /CnCFD-NoDVD.rar directory, but I don't know what the other files are for in /CnCTFD-px777.RAR.

Some games do not need a crack, like Renegade."

,mister_playboy,2009-06-13T11:11Z,"I encourage all TPB members to REFUSE to purchase this game. EA spent zero time on this release, and it is a buggy piece of trash. EA released two patches that fixed only a small portion of the issues with the game, and then did nothing more. They already had our money, after all.

Due to the hard work of a group of dedicated fans, a v1.03 patch has been made available which transforms TFD into the game it always SHOULD have been.

You can get it here:

http://www.commandandpatch.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=3052997b44b9fb260711682723f68518&cat=54

Pirate The First Decade, and consider giving the money you would have given to EA to this guy's site instead as a donation (donate button on the right side of the screen). They are the ones who deserve it. "
