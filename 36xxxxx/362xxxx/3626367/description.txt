                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Malalai Joya is famous and infamous. She is a controversial and outspoken 
28-year-old Afghan woman, a folk hero and a women's rights activist, who, 
despite four assassination attempts and many more death threats, was elected 
to the newly formed democratic parliament in Afghanistan in 2005. She's also 
the focus of this year's World Cinema Jury Prize-winning documentary at the 
Sundance Film Festival.

Enemies of Happiness tells the inspiring story of a young woman fighting for 
change in Afghanistan, a woman who's been described as "the bravest woman in 
Afghanistan". It all began in 2003, when Afghanistan politicians met to lay 
the foundation for a democracy in the "new" Afghanistan. It was at this 
meeting that the outspoken Malalai Joya challenged former Mujahidin leaders. 
Her comments ignited outrage among the mostly male group, who demanded that 
she be immediately removed from the sessions.

Undaunted, in September 2005, when Afghanistan held its first parliamentary 
election in over 30 years, Joya was one of the candidates running to become 
a delegate in the National Assembly. Enemies of Happiness follows the final 
weeks of Joya's political campaign, when the death threats and assassination 
attempts forced her to conduct her campaign in hiding, surrounded by security. 
Directed by Eva Mulvad and Anja Al Erhayem, Enemies of Happiness provides a 
snapshot of life and politics in war-torn Afghanistan, but more importantly 
tells a story of personal courage and the belief that an ordinary person can 
make a difference.
