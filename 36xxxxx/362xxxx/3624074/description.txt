This release is the entire collection of songs released into the wild by the musician KarmaKat.

This torrent includes 95 songs that were created over the past 10 years since the artist adopted the moniker of Karmakat.

Ranging in flavour from IDM, downtempo, electronica, video game infused, glitch, 8-bit, trance, big-beat, to experimental, KarmaKat\\\\\\\'s music has been enjoyed by many people in the underground electronic music scene. Karmakat first appeared on mp3.com/karmakat in 1996, long before the web became densely populated with users using the handle of karmakat. Since then, a small global following of KarmaKat has taken place. Hand distributed and internet releases of the albums Toy Songs, Hopscotch Thought Blocks, and The Lounging Hurtbox as well as many other assorted mixes have been floating around by the thousands among listeners who have enjoyed live performances at Toronto venues, including Art System, the Kathedral, and XPACE. Karmakat performed for many different art shows and Ontario College of Art & Design functions (OCAD). Karmakat\\\\\\\'s music has also graced the soundtracks of several of the short films and interactive DVDs of the Toronto public art crew The City Beautification Ensemble (CBE) and the short film CONDOMINI at the Tranz Tech Media Biennial in 2003. Many copies of a special release of KarmaKat\\\\\\\'s music were also distributed by the VendArt Collective, as free art and music, in their art vending machine projects in Toronto and New York City. KarmaKat\\\\\\\'s music has also been heard on Toronto\\\\\\\'s student radio 89.5.

This release was put together by the artist prompted from fan mail that has continued to pour in even several years after the artist has moved on to other artistic and musical projects.
