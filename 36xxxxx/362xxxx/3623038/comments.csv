,ricciricci,2008-10-16T17:06Z,"Was the ""AIDS virus"" manmade or is ""AIDS"" just a new name for old diseases exacerbated by being given a death sentence followed by toxic treatments?
Celebrities have become custodians and promoters of ""incurable"" diseases and have growing links to drug companies and think tanks.
It is easy to ""cure"" ""AIDS"" when it is understood that it is the diagnosis, prior health challenges and the treatment, sometimes in combination that can kill.
If ""AIDS"" (29 old diseases) is caused by one virus that is supposed, on the one hand, to be so deadly and yet on the other hand have a laten period of 20 years perhaps we should question whether the virus has been isolated properly, whether the tests do detect a virus or just general antibodies, whether the meds prolong life or shorten it. What about Africa?????
