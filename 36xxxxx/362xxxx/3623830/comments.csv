,s72g,2007-02-22T05:24Z,Det ska finnas nåt att ladda för alla. Inte för att JAG tycker så mycket om Gud. Jag har inte träffat Gud. O inte kommer la jag göra det. Det blir nog Satan. :))
,mesohony,2007-02-22T14:49Z,What are all those .exe files for???
,s72g,2007-02-22T22:12Z,I downloaded it and the .exe-file was some kind of media player.
,carcass2,2007-02-22T22:42Z,"You fucked up christians have been saying that the rapture is upon us ever since your fictional character ""Jesus"" supposedly ascended to your heaven. approx. 2000 years ago. You are so gullible and dumb!"
,pusa,2007-02-23T03:18Z,"Seeing is believing for me, I had to go on Faith until I searched for Him with all my Heart and Soul and he appeared to me just like the Bible said. Eternity is upon us Jesus Freaks. You can be born twice and die once or be born once and die twice. You choose. He knew us before we were born and has chosen YOU. YOU just have to except his free pardon for all your sins."
,made-of-technetium,2007-02-23T04:26Z,"BEWARE!!!!!!
Say anything bad about this freaks superstition & he'll send you a personal message in the vain (a sin by the way) hope of bringing you into the heart of Jesus.
God made man in his own image (the ultimate vanity), So if
we're dumb then God is dumb, & maybe just a little ugly on the side."
,made-of-technetium,2007-02-23T04:42Z,"For anyone interested this was my reply to his personal message:-
No thanks, I think I'll just be born the once, have a life, then die just the once (unless I die on the operating table then get resuscitated). After that nothing, it's as if I never existed in the first place.
I can accept that, unfortunately those who can't have to dream up some superstitious mumbo jumbo to make themselves feel like there is a purpose in life, Jesus  just one of a plethora of supreme beings dreamt up to fulfill that need."
,pusa,2007-02-23T18:29Z,"So tell me, where have you gotten your information, or is this just what YOU THINK? Worship Jesus or worship Satan, the choice is yours because Yehweh gave you Free Choice. I have seen Heaven and Jesus, I know the truth, this is my testimony, a first hand witness, good in any Court of Law."
,pusa,2007-02-26T02:15Z,"I don't claim to be a Christian, I like the title Jesus Freak better. The Bible says a woman is to obey her husband. The man should honor his wife however. You can have a rowdy wife under Bible rules and misbehavin if you like."

,KingKongFetus,2010-05-11T07:12Z,"Seriously, pusa should have the freedom to upload any torrent he wishes and if you don't like it... just move onto the next torrent. So childish to start ""religious"" wars because you don't like or agree with pusa's believe or the bible. it is nonsense to even comment if you it is not something you are interested in."
