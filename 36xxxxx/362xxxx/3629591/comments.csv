,therainmaker,2007-03-01T18:51Z,One of the best singers ever all categories (my opinion)
,resonator,2007-03-05T22:49Z,"As the filesize says this is audio only. Avoid this one because its very low sound quality, although a high bitrate was used. Could be the source media, but I doubt it because some retard has encoded /recorded it with such an incredible low level (i.e. you have to increase the volume knob on your speakers and / or computer's mixer  very much to hear anything at all.)"
