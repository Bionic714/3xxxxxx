Indulge in the massive visual live onslaught in front of thousands of cheering Russian fans in St.Petersburg - of course also featured as a live CD to feed your stereo. Aspiring six-string wizards can also join the DVD guitar workshop with grandmaster Victor Smolski, or get exclusive private footage of frontman Peavy Wagner introducing his impressive skull collection.

Of course, RAGE fans will be delighted to hear that video clips and a second live show at the Masters Of Rock festival in the Czech Republic will be included as bonus material. No fear indeed - this is the perfect RAGE package.
After more than 20 years of history, RAGE is one of the most experienced german metal bands still around. The band released an album nearly every year, among them milestones like "Perfect Man", "The Missing Link", "Black In Mind", the "Lingua Mortis"-Album recorded with an orchestra (long time before every metal band used an orchestra) or "Unity".

"Full Moon In St. Petersburg" is indeed everything a RAGE fan needs. All classics performed with passion and competence.
