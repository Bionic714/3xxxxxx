,Nerd42,2008-07-02T20:34Z,you can convert them with CrossFont http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3914707/CrossFont_v4.2_(Cracked)
,Rumudiez,2008-09-17T07:04Z,"i would dl, but its just too many fonts. im not about to jump in line to wait 5 min for comp to load the font list everytime i change fonts"
,danelectro,2008-10-03T17:56Z,"Rumudiez: You don't have to install all of them. I personally don't use more than 10 basic fonts. Besides, you can always try a font manager like Font Explorer X or FontExpert."
,nomdeguerre,2008-11-11T15:41Z,"Hello, I am also having the same problem as merzdoat. I am using a mac, and thought the linotype gold edition was compatible with mac? I tried to use Cross Font, but it is for windows. Would someone mind explaining why there are no fonts in the download and what to do with the files in the font folders so I can use them? Will I have to convert them one by one? Thanks in advance"
,ordinaryradio,2009-08-09T20:25Z,"this up does NOT contain all the neccesary elements. Do not waste your time with it. Screen fonts have been removed as have the printer fonts for the mac. there is another upload on here somewhere that may contain all the elements but I""d check first. this up is a waste of space and time."
,AlmaChua,2010-05-03T15:15Z,"Yes, is's dirty. I can't understand how slipshod some People do their work. The second dirty Linotype-packing, which for I wasted time and transfervolume. If you don't have to give some stuff - LET IT BE!

fuck you!!!"
,word304,2011-09-03T01:28Z,"I know it's been over a year but.. wtf @ AlmaChua's comment?!
1st - Don't bitch abt ppl's ups not reaching your preferred standards (especially w/ porn or cracked software). 
2nd - Don't whine abt ur wasted time or ""transfer volume."" a-it's the gamble u take w/ every torrent and b-no one cares.... ""~~~~wahhhhhhhhh""
3rd-  If you decide to ignore Rule1&2, and absolutely HAVE to, at least make sense with your bitching.
Example: ""If you don't have to give some stuff - LET IT BE!"" ........ ur broken-ass english makes 0 sense."
,word304,2011-09-03T01:30Z,"In conclusion....

No AlmaChua, FUCK YOU!"
,braaah,2011-12-14T15:18Z,"This is a fine torrent, better than the Mayhem torrent because this one is simply in one Zip file. You can search the font you are looking for without having to unpack the whole Zip file."
