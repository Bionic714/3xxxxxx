Can burn all files but not in VIDEO_TS folder to make it a real DVD.
Please, help!"

,Wotererio,2010-06-14T15:57Z,Another Brick In The Wall (Part2) is fucked up by that woman. She really sings it like a bitch. Roger Waters has to sing it! Mother is really beautyfull with    Sinead O'Connor thoe. I'm going to the concert in Arnhem and maybe Berlin :D

We slept in our BMW while parked in the Templehoff parking lot. The crowd without tickets wound up trampling the fences and gates. Considering the stage was 187 meters wide and the crowd consumed that width and then again 5 times as deep, I would say the estimated attendance of 200,000 is less than HALF of those who attended. People were climbing the light poles in the middle of the audience to obtain a better view. I was close to the stage at maybe 80 yards away. The audio dropped out during Another Brick In The Wall Part 1 and again during Mother. I'm GLAD there was a backup audio source for recording because the live audio was dubious at times. Wow! What memories."
