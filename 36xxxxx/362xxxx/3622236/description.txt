SINOPSIS: Getting into his grandfather's pottery workshop at night, a little boy finds an unusually large vase. Fascinated, the child feels the still-warm material, which - wheather by a miracle or hand of a magician, who knows? - at once changes into a magnificent piece of chinese porcelain. Presently, from behind the great blue-enamelled trees, there appears a fisherman in his sampan... That's how the story of The Nightingale, told all in music, begins, as the waking dream of a child in the land of chinese art - and of mobile phones and webcams.
