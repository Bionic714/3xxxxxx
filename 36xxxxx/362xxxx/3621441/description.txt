Synopsis

For DUSTIN HOFFMAN, acquiring the right voice was the biggest challenge he faced portraying a 121-year old man, not the daily five hour makeup regimen. He achieved the perfect sound through closely studying the speech patterns of several elderly men.
In this sweeping epic that swings from high comedy to drama, DUSTIN HOFFMAN gives a "virtuoso perfomance" (Hollywood Reporter) as the 121-year old sole survivor of Custer´s Last Stand. Narrating his colorful life story, he tells about everything from his adoption by Cheyenne Indians to his marriages and friendship with Wild Bill Hickok. His tall tale indicates he just may be one of the biggest liars who roamed the West. Oscar-winner CHIEF DAN GEORGE, FAYE DUNAWAY, MARTIN BALSAM and RICHARD MULLIGAN co-star.
