,JUGOSLAVIJA 4ever,2007-02-20T14:09Z,great uppload thx
,snikpeis,2007-02-20T14:57Z,"to the whiners:
before you start harassing the uploader and the seeders, maybe you should check your own transfer/seed settings in your BT client. if you don't upload shit while downloading, YOU are one of the assholes contributing to the slow DL speed.  if you're using azureus, check this link to adjust your settings: http://www.azureuswiki.com/index.php/Increase_download_speed
the wiki tells you everything you need to know about your settings in general, check it and get your shit straight
just a thought"
,NoHate4,2007-02-21T00:13Z,"thxs for the tip....i wasn't complaining about speeds, just wondering why mine were so much slower than everyone else..........switched to azureus and speed increased magnitudes.  

thanks for the torrent as well.  "
