,James R. Bath,2007-02-25T21:27Z,"The sample included is DVD quality, widescreen, and in English.  Guys in sample look like those in IMDB photos.  Only thing wrong is that it was released as a split RAR instead of a single video file.  Can't confirm the RAR contains the actual film.

BT intro 101:  this is not usenet.  You do not need to split files in order to upload."
