Notes: 

Although this is a reading of the hardcover edition (not the re-released soft cover with the addendum), not all of this audiobook is verbatim of what is in the hardcover edition. In particular, the "Word from Congressman John Linder" was truncated when read by the narrator. 

"Introduction A" is the quote that is between the  "A Word from Neal Boortz" and "Introduction". This quote section is not listed in the physical book's Table of Contents.
