This application might be useful to some who are still downloading from RapidShare. As we all know RapidShare has a time limit and a download limit for every IP address that connects to their service. Now, what would be a great way to circumvent those limits? Right, change your IP address and you are ready to download again. You could do this by manually changing the proxy server in your browsers settings or you could use a tool like the grabber.
