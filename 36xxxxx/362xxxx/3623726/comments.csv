That is why most people stay in the pack, and some people rise from it. Those some people are open minded and the pack (""normal people) is not (or is just too scared to show it). 

Yup, that was quite philosophical, but it's sure is the truth.

And yes, to call Judas4ever a liar is a weird form of outlet, but he is a closed minded person, if he thinks the message of this movie is a waste of time. Nothing wrong with being closed minded, but he will just not be a big person some time, and yet, he might not want to be that. That way, everyone is happy, right?

I'm working a lot with positive thinking, the law of ""equal attracts equal"" and such, and I can truly recommend both ""Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting"" by Lynn Grabhorn and ""Think And Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill. Be open minded, read the books and get ready for a transition!"

""Baz70 at 2007-02-22 04:02 CET: ""This is a movie ALL should see..."" ""

Actually... This is a movie NO ONE should see.

It's very dangerous for weak-minded people, they will easily be blinded and buy into this... then they're trapped.

9/11 was an inside job, check out http://thepiratebay.org/user/lkobescak for lots of great torrents of documentaries and films that expose the truth of 9/11 and a lot of other things..... but, this ""movie"", the ""Secret"" -- is 99% bull, and should not be watched by anyone... unless they have a strong mind and are not easily fooled.

Didn't you hear what Alex Jones said on his show about this ""film""...?

Anyway... Stay awake everyone, and don't be distracted or misled."

PS I agree with lkobescak"
,radicalscope,2007-06-10T03:17Z,"gentlemen,

i would say that those who wish to change and prepared to do what it takes to make the change should watch this, along with some other books on positive thinking and life transition, such as napoleon hill's think and grow rich. if you are one of those people who are satisfied with your current life, great. but don't try to impose on people who want to change.

,ejputz,2008-07-28T15:44Z,This movie does well to explain why all those Smiley-Happy people are always so fucking clueless!
,evilthief,2008-08-11T07:32Z,"svendk, ""The Pack"" is made up if gullible people like you who at one point actually BOUGHT forgiveness from Catholic priests because they were so afraid of Eternal Damnation, or traveled all the way to Jerusalem to murder women and children for land and jewels because they believed they were doing God's work.

I can't believe I actually sat here and listened to this video tell me that I can make my debt go away by simply pretending it doesn't exist.

This video is in rather high quality and makes me think I have a pretty good idea the type of people who are behind it, same people who have ruled western civilization for centuries.  Widespread ignorance has always been their goal."
,loc0000,2008-08-12T11:23Z,"check it out..ithink the movie should be percieved for the best, also , i think its saying theirs a destinguishment between Listening, Thinking, and Actually doing...hmm something like , do wtvr makes you feel good, and then listen to whats working, not just the short change, kind of like not seeing outside a box to not know their wasnt a box ,hmmm kind of like a funny calculus to X directly without argument toward higher order...hmmm maybe im applying some lunacy i cant be sure LOL"

Do not waste your time reading peoples egos bloat pro or contra the content here - if you really have to know and just watch the movie to build your own picture.
You will be delighted you did.

In case these teachings suit you - also check out Dr. Robert Anthonys material for even more helpful information."

That is not how LoA works - you can manifest abundance for yourself by focusing on being in the PLUS and how that feels. It does not say you should not be aware of what is. On an emotional level however feeling you are in debt will help fuel or create it. So emotionally speaking one must overlay the feeling of being broke with the feeling of security and living in abundance (whatever that gives you on an emotional level).


The premise is pretty simple:
When you can get yourself to feel good most of the time (choosing your thoughts and WHAT you think about) then you will attract good things into your life.
You might also explain this interpersonal because you will be a totally different person when you feel good - so communicating your desires is effortless. If the whole ""universe"" concept is too far off.

This stuff is not a religion - it is a model for getting what you desire. It does not explain everything - it doesnt have to. Like in NLP - its just beliefs and strategies to deal with life. Do whatever works for you and dont care about the rest. Thats my motto. The results so far (and I have done A LOT of self-improvement and development) with this LoA-stuff (especially Robert Anthony) are amazing and I am enjoying my life more than ever. Furthermore this does not feel like dogma - 
if you apply it INTELLIGENTLY and dont treat it like a religion.

Do what works.
