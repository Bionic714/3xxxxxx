You need to use THE CRACK!

If you use WinRAR Archiver to explore the ISO (disk image) file, You will see a folder called ""Crack"", open it, the file called, something like ""Sims2EP[THERES A NUMBER HER. $GOT WHICH].exe"", you copy n paste this in ure program files, EA Games, Sims 2, Sims 2 Seasons, TSBin.

Open up the .mdf file with Daemon Tools and in it should be a CRACK folder. You have to take the cracked Sims2EP5.exe file from that folder to the Sims 2 Seasons folder in Program Files.

X:\Program Files\EA GAMES\The Sims 2 Seasons\TSBin\

""X"" is the drive you installed it in, such as my ""C' drive.

If you want, make a backup of the original ""Sims2EP5"" file and then replace it with the cracked file. It's as simple as that. Then just run it, no disc needed."

,-iDragon-,2009-08-02T10:49Z,"This download worked great for me! :D

I do, however, have something biting at my brain. Will it be compatible with other cracked installations from the piratebay? I'm currently downloading the Pets expansion and whatnot, but I'm worried they won't work together with having to hide and restore the whatever file all the time.

But yeah, this is a great download and thank you very much for putting it up!"

Thanks a lot.

Btw, I am going to seed."
,Saulll,2010-02-03T20:54Z,"For those of you who don't know how to install and play the game here's how:

1) Install Daemon Tools lite if you don't already have it (You can download it from: ""http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads/dtLite"")

2)Add the Sims2Ep1 image to Daemon tools. (The .mdf file)

3)Mount the file (Click the icon with the CD with a green triangle on Daemon Tools)

4) Install it, when the screen prompts for the codes use the Key gen that was in the Torrent files. Use the Orange Disc icon on the key gen and then click get ""get key/code""
-Copy the code into the sims 2 seasons window.

5)When finished installing remount the Sims 2 seasons .mdf file and then open up the sd4hide.
-Click hide then load up the sims 2 seasons game and play!
**Don't forget, after you're done playing hit restore on the sd4hide**"

,Jamster1,2010-04-24T12:56Z,visual22x is that it??? i get 600kb/s-800kb/s i sometimes even reach 1.1MB/S!
,DeeDee90,2010-04-25T12:36Z,"I have a big issue... I install the whole shabang, i understand it all, and then the game asks me to hold on while it updates, which is fine, it tells me that the sims 2 has already been updated, all is well. And then, another window pops up saying, (AFTER IT TOLD ME THAT SIMS 2 IS ALREADY UPDATED) saying close the sims 2 before updating. I go, ok, the sims 2 is already closed, and click ok and then the bastard tells me, the update has failed, the instalation will now terminate. Please help, i am so pissed off right now :P"
,Moodlily,2010-05-09T01:26Z,"I am so confused. This is way more complicated than I thought :( . First off, I have no idea how to do even the first part, and while everyone is talking about how to crack files and whatever, I'm sitting here for an hour trying to figure out how to do this shit. Argh I'm so frustrated, but I can't really afford to buy Sims. Well, if anyone can explain step by step how to do this for me, it would be extremely helpful :)"
,linkous309,2010-05-15T02:44Z,"thx for the download, I know it's old but... seed much, anyone?"
,colacocabmaster,2010-05-24T14:06Z,"okay here are the steps,
I assume that you have downloaded and installed daemon tools, from the helpers up.
1:look down at the taskbar for a little blue logo,called daemon tools(move with your arrow over it)if you can't find it, run daemon tools fromyour deskop or where you've installed it.

2;okay daemon tools is running now.
press the logo with your left mouse button.A menu will open. press one with ''no media''.
3; now you can find your file. for ex. C:\Users\Me\AppData\Roaming\Bittorrent\The sims 2 seasons.
THIS IS A EXAMPLE

it will say that the folder is empty if you are there,BUT  to the bottom of where you've entred the path, there is another menu. press it.
press ''All Files'' and double click the MDF file.


Wait a few/10 seconds,
then go to my computer, and double click at the game! open the keygen for serial and copy the sims 2 exe file in the download map to the installed file(LIKE:C:\program files\sims2\TS BIn

play game from deskop"
[T],HaUnTiNg.SuMMeR,2010-05-25T10:20Z, i am unable to install this one.. m getting prompt. this product requires a installed copy of sims 2. is it a full game..or just  update/expansion pack...
,Dutchy131,2010-06-08T21:49Z,I installed then there was the cd4 popup tried mounting the mds and mdf file with safedisc on and off exactly doing what the instructions say but won't get any further anyone please help?
,Dutchy131,2010-06-08T22:05Z,It worked just terminated the update progress where it says insert disc 4 
,Dutchy131,2010-06-08T22:16Z,"tough i sometimes see some like sims when they move you see fragments of a second ago where they walk it cannot be a pc problem(3 gb ram and nvidia geforce gt 9500)
Probably not from this expansion because i had it when i installed the game weird ... runs sims 3 no probs"
,Bridgesfolly,2010-07-05T02:14Z,"Slight issue with mine. I do all the steps and get it all ready to go and it starts up just fine up until the loading screen (after the preview with all the little sim people dancing and whatever else they do) and then I get a pop-up that says ""The Game has crashed. The Application will shut down""

Whats that about and how do i fix it?"
,Bridgesfolly,2010-07-05T02:30Z,"Everything works up until I'm playing the game. When it's loading i get a pop-up saying the Application has crashed and will terminate.

I did everything you said to do but it still doesn't work!
In the folder (this torrent download) I have two MDF Files that say
'Sims2_EP5_1'
And the first one that has 730,560 KB wont even come up when I search for files to be mounted.
The other one which is only 10 KB installs the game when I mount it but when I go to play Apartment Life ( I have to play this one to make the game work) a box comes up that says:
'A required security module cannot be activated.
This program cannot be executed (5014).'
What do I have to do to make it work?"
,ash1998,2010-10-09T21:33Z,"game works great

'Once again, right-click on the DaemonTools icon in your taskbar, choose Emulation > Safedisc'

Weel 'Emulation' didnt come up!

So i started playing and the game was loading like when it says all that weird stuff , and it just stopped at 'Consuming Snow Travjecories' or something ..

,eleanor24,2011-03-12T13:13Z,"I can't change my screen size, it can be only 800x600. Is is because of this torrent, or always when seasons are downloaded? If I try to download it somewhere else, will it change? I have all expansion packs released before seasons, and everything was fine before I downloaded this."

,CupidKills,2011-03-16T21:00Z,"This torrent works perfectly fine for me. The download took a bit under two hours (and I have an extremely slow internet connection).

For those of you confused about the instructions that follow putting in the key, I didn't bother with any of that, because my DAEMON TOOLS wasn't picking up anything but the one file. I used the No_CD crack found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4576455/The_Sims_2__Seasons_No-DVD_Fixed_EXE


Works like a charm. ;)"
,ajpopo,2011-03-27T00:59Z,"@AyaseFanatic Right click the icon of daemon tools, then, choose virtual cd/dvd rom, select an empty device and mount image, there should be a window appear right? change the file type to all files and then you can mount sims2_ep5_1. "
,issa97,2011-04-13T07:39Z,"When it asks for The Sims 2 CD 4, all you need to do is do nothing with that window. 
Do not close it since it will automatically uninstall The Sims 2 Seasons. 
All you have to do is restart your computer when that message appears.

Thats how I solved my problem with other expansion packs. I hope it works. :)

And when it asks for the original The Sims 2 Seasons CD or whatever it was, Just download the No-CD crack that can be found here
