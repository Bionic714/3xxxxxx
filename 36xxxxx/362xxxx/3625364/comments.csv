,rowdy,2007-03-05T10:48Z,"This looks genuine, but I haven't tested it yet, just browsed the files.  Anyone tested it for real, maybe who knows how to xfer the files from PC to Wii?"
,jorritleemans_10,2007-03-08T14:41Z,What is this? something like a bootloader or a PAL to NTSC converter or otherwise?
,wombat0893,2007-07-29T00:15Z,Please seed! this is very important for me!
,rowdy,2007-08-07T11:50Z,"It appears to be lacking the C:\CW_RVL directory. Also, this will (probably) only work on NDEV consoles.. We'll probably have to settle with NGC coding for Wii until another devkit is available..."
,barf.nz,2007-09-18T17:16Z,C:\CW_RVL is just the codewarrior working directory. 
,WB3000,2008-05-24T05:17Z,Just need the DarcD.exe U8 Extractor and compiler.
