,dreamrafa,2007-02-28T02:59Z,"Thank you very much RipperSeregon, but could you dedicate your upload speed to the Romavarium DVD first? its running terrible slow, and uploading another DVD at the same time will make it even slower... just an idea... thanks again"
,RipperSeregon,2007-02-28T10:06Z,"Yeah, of course. Stupid of me, really. I'm putting this torrent on hold till we have some seeders at Romavarium :)"
,kjelleper,2007-03-01T18:27Z,"Someone out there has the following fan club cd's and want to upload?

Graspop Festival 2002
Scenes From A World Tour
The Making Of Falling Into Infinity


Thanks in advance!"

ciao from Italy"
,ektakrome,2007-03-02T04:02Z,Wow. thanks for putting this one up too. Cheers to you RS. I just hope I can get the Romavarium within the next day.
,RipperSeregon,2007-03-02T15:17Z,"@Kjelleper: I have them, but they ain't encoded by me. I could upload them later though. Just wait till we have enough seeders on FCDVD2005/2006 since my upload speed is pretty bad.. :)"
,nuggster,2007-03-03T16:56Z,When do you think this will be fully available? Date estimated? Thank you for sharing this!

,nago,2007-03-09T21:39Z,Stop complaining. You should be grateful you are getting this at all.
,kjelleper,2007-03-09T23:10Z,I am NOT complaning! I am grateful as hell for getting this as you can se above. I just thinks its sad that people download this torrent and not seed it for a while. Its better for all - it will go faster!  
,RipperSeregon,2007-03-10T02:17Z,"I'm sorry it's going so slowly with me, but I have a crappy upload speed.. But even though it's going slow, I will seed till we have at least 10 seeders! :)"
,nago,2007-03-13T09:00Z,hooray!
,ektakrome,2008-04-15T23:49Z,"if I had a computer with a bigger hard drive. I'd be seeding this, even though I got it over a year ago and seeded it to a ratio of 5."
,zhezow,2008-04-28T16:33Z,I'll seed that 'until have people downloading that. :)
,StrangeBones,2009-11-14T17:43Z,Thanks a million! 
,dirkgently84,2011-05-27T15:34Z,is this originally a dvd5 release or compressed from dvd9?
