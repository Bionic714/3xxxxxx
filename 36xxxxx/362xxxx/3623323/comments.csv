Mexico's Government-in-Resistance, led by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, broadcasts a weekly program called La Verdad Sea Dicha - Truth Be Told.

This clip includes highlights from the broadcast of 20/FEB/2007, with English subtitles (SRT format). It talks about the great bank rescues and white collar crime that have impoverished the nation, the movement's background and plans, Fox's admission of wrongdoing during the elections, and the upcoming National Democratic Convention on March 21-24.

,peoplayer,2007-02-21T07:16Z,"Fox never admitted any ""wrongdoing"" during the elections. He simply said he rooted for one of the candidates.

This is pure bullshit propaganda. Lopez Obrador is just another Lula / Fidel / Chavez wannabe, that was stopped in his tracks by his own wrongdoings..."
,usr0022,2007-02-21T07:46Z,"You're right Fox 'merely' admitted rooting for Calderon, but he certainly admitted being behind the desafuero, which he vociferously denied at the time (""do I control Congress?""). As his purpose was AMLO's political disqualification for the 2006 election, and breaks the law in more than one way, he admits of at least this wrongdoing, if not the other.

Your other point, however, I do grant. This is pure bullshit propaganda, in the sense of a political message clearly biased to present facts favourably to the movement, which leans to the left. Production quality is so-so, and some numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. Ain't that true of everything?

It is certainly not without merit, and speaks more than a few truths. What most Mexicans need is a good hard look at the mirror.
