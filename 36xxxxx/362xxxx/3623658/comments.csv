,Petter_W,2008-04-01T16:54Z,"I've had problems playing this movie on my DVD player.
I wrote the files to a double layered dvd without problems, but when I try to play it on my DVD player it just gets stuck on the language selection menu, I can't choose a language nor do anything else.
Any ideas?"

,fantasticfred,2008-07-23T05:25Z,how do i play the movie once ive downloaded it?? sorry im new at this!
,xJaeihx,2008-09-07T03:45Z,"Absolute waste of time. Waited close to two weeks to download and I can't get my conversion software to acknowledge it. Out of hundreds of movies, this is the ONLY time I've had this to happen. 
If you just want to watch it on your computer, it's fine. It plays through InterVideo. "
