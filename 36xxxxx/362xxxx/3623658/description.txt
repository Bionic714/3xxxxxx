QUADROPHENIA

London, 1964. Two rival youth cults emerge ? the mods and the rockers ? with explosive consequences. For Jimmy (Phil Daniels) and his sharp-suited, pill-popping, scooter-riding mates, being a mod is a way of life, it's their generation.[/B]
[B]Together they head off to Brighton for an orgy of drugs, thrills and violent confrontation against the rockers. Will Jimmy emerge a hero or will he be disillusioned by his way of life? ?I don't wanna be like everybody else, that's why I'm a mod, see?? Jimmy.
