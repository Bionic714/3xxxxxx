,carr084,2007-02-27T19:52Z,please seed
,timmyj72,2007-02-28T16:02Z,"Really, what is the point of uploading a torrent here is you're not going to seed. Currently this program has been downloaded zero times ..."

If you don't know what SPSS is, then you don't need the software.

If you work in STATS... then you know what SPSS is.

SPSS is the known name for the application"
,Leffeslog,2007-03-04T20:43Z,"Den här snubben seedar inte, man kommer till 10,5 MB och sen är det stopp. Jag har försökt i två veckor. Jag skulle verkligen vilja ha det här programmet som är marknadens bästa statistikprogram. Med tanke på hur många som försökt ladda ned så verkar det finnas ett stort intresse från fler. Kan ingen idealistiskt lagd hackare försöka hitta den och lägga ut, snälla? Jag ska använda programmet för att rädda världen ;-) och jag är trött på virtual PC

This guy is not seeding, only 10,5 MB is possible to download and then it is stop. I have tried in two weeks now. I would really like to have this software since it is the best program for statistics on the market. A lot of people have tried down load during the same time as me so it seems to be a common interest. I should really appreciate if some idealistic hacker could help us. I am going to use the program to save the world ;-)"
,RaVeNouS GoD,2007-03-06T17:47Z,I only got to download 10.5 MB too...I was excited to see how fast it was downloading and then BAM! Nothing...
,Leffeslog,2007-03-06T18:08Z,"Who is Mr sixty-threee(!) security boss of SPSS? Thirty guys are for the moment trying to download this software, all with very little success, could it be a trap? Maybe it is best to avoid this torrent."
,RaVeNouS GoD,2007-03-07T08:22Z,SPSS has excellent security - one of the hardest programs to find cracks for that work without problems later...they usually crap out!

,Joseh K,2007-08-24T19:27Z,Would someone please seed this file? Thank you very much in advance. Where can I find the latest serial box in order to get the serial number? I am currently not in the US.
,Joseh K,2007-09-02T02:44Z,"Serial number, please! Someone help!"
,Joseh K,2007-09-09T20:04Z,"To install we need:
- Serial number AND License code
Otherwise it is USELESS!
What is the purpose to upload a file that people cannot install or use?"
,keallach,2007-11-11T17:11Z,Where can I get the sn & lic. code?
,sesilu,2007-11-22T20:54Z,"This is the newest SPSS for Mac. A working serial can be found in the latest serial box.

,kevinrf,2008-09-03T08:00Z,the license number still doesnt work. where can i find this? 
,garbuhj,2008-10-17T23:42Z,"Working serial number and password are given in the comment that's 2 above this one, but they mixed up which is which.  The one they called lic is actually the serial number, and vice versa."
,keepinitraw,2008-11-07T21:02Z,garbuhj is correct regarding filthybass's numbers.
,Stjani86,2008-11-11T11:33Z,"i cant get it to work. you can´t open the applivation ""spss13 installer"" because it is not supported on this architecture. this is the messeges that i get"
