,Lazydogmic,2007-03-06T22:41Z,seed then????
,ektakrome,2007-03-20T23:33Z,"Hey, why is there over 39 people with 76% and no one with 100% done. It would only take about one more day to get more people at 100% so they and I can seed as well.

Come on guys!"
,ektakrome,2007-03-24T19:42Z,Still stuck at 76.3%...where the hell did everyone else go that was also waiting on it....did you get it and then decide not to seed it.
,PekkaPuusaha,2007-03-29T08:45Z,"I'm stuck on 77% and I've been there for 2 days so how about someone would seed this.

Cheers!"
