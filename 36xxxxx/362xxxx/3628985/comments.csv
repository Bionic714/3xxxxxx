Might I suggest superseeding? It goes slower overall, but picks one person to seed to, then as long as that person doesn't have too much going on, it passes down to others in the process. Then it's a simple process of superseeding to finish off a few more people, which is just another 60% uploading. Just a suggestion, am wanting to see this one."
,kirschwasser,2007-03-05T17:43Z,The reason why it was stuck is that my windows dies at me and i have reinstalled it so it should be up and running again now.  -Kirschwasser

,ReduxDengaku,2007-04-22T10:23Z,@khardankov: No problems with vertical flipping here; you may want to give up on divx 3.11 though; somewhat antequated.  Look into ffdshow; it'll cover everything but Matroshka.
