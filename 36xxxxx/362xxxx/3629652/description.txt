A fine bit of television jazz that, before I transferred it to DVD, ran the risk of being played to death. While Wes Montgomery was in Europe in 1965, NDR in Hamburg had the inspired idea of putting the legendary guitarist together with some legends from the European jazz scene, and a fellow American who had made his home in Europe (namely Johnny \\\\\\\'the Little Giant\\\\\\\' Griffin). Watch and listen out for the underrated greatness of the late Ronnie Stephenson on drums. Apologies for the general grottiness of the picture and the occasional glitches on the soundtrack (I\\\\\\\'m hoping one of the German networks will re-show this again so I can get a first generation recording), but I think these are easy to ignore when you have so much great music made by so many great musicians.
