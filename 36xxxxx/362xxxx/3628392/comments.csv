,xlazyx,2007-03-13T16:00Z,"Which region is this?

If it's NTSC, can someone confirm it it's working with any of the ""region free"" modchips or ""offline"" patchers?

,tikitak,2007-03-23T03:15Z,"This is the first game I have tried with my modded Wii (Using a WiiKey). So far I have had no luck with this game after burning it 3 times using 3 different computers and 3 different programs. My WiiKey does accept its configuration disc, so it does work fine. Just waiting on a few other games to finish downloading, if they work then I guess this WiiPlay ISO is just a dud."
,bhzard,2007-03-25T18:39Z,"This ISO its NOT GOOD, dont waste ur time downloading this game. I Just burn it using NERO, ALCOHOL, but dosnt work. All the games that i burn plays good, so its not my WII, or DVDS."
,tikitak,2007-03-25T19:59Z,I'd just like to add additional reconfirmation - THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
,axemanhelo,2007-03-26T23:51Z,This game dosent work.
,AbsolutePwn,2007-04-17T06:19Z,do not download... it DOES NOT WORK!
,lakersforce,2007-06-24T21:29Z,Doesn't work? Duh...game has not even been released neither have a release date been reported. No wonder it doesn't work. The game simply does not exist yet. Fools :)
,FineAppz,2007-07-26T10:36Z,"Sluta snacka skit om trasiga ISO filer och lär er hur man gör när man bränner, denna ISO fungerar utmärkt i mitt WII med WiiKey."
,keepquiet,2007-07-26T12:04Z,"Är det PAL, NTSC, eller JAP?"
,FineAppz,2007-07-26T22:36Z,Detta funkar bra på min PAL maskin
,filip_xb95,2007-08-01T23:11Z,"ok it is not hard or something just burn it i burned it with a werry bad burner but it workt at 100%
and it's fun play it =)

jag är svensk he he"
,filip_xb95,2007-08-01T23:12Z,works fine
,pattelatte37,2007-08-07T18:10Z,Fungerar fint! Brände med Nero och inga problem alls. Använde t.o.m billiga DVD +R från ÖB.
,iLensi,2007-08-15T13:04Z,Is it necessary to brickblock this?
,4nr-,2007-09-27T11:20Z,works excellent on PAL wii with wiikey
,smegpot,2007-12-07T17:30Z,"Thanks for uploading

But this iso is fucked - the system will recognize the disk as WiiPlay, but it won't load at all - freezes the entire system.
 - USA NTSC with WiiKey 1.9g"

,bajs86,2008-03-24T22:28Z,e de bara svenskar som fattar nåt
,SpiderMan-35,2008-07-08T01:56Z,FUCKING YOU WiiCube ! ! ! YOUR GAME IS A SSSHHHHIIIITTTTTTT ! ! ! GO TO HEL ! ! ! 
,redwings765,2008-09-22T11:22Z,ATTENTION!!! this is a PAL iso. IT DOES WORK. just dont use it on an ntsc wii. i dont have a pal tv so i cant use it so now i have another coaster... stop cursing and leaving bad comments if you dont know anything about modding. youre just telling everyone here that your a n00b. and giving bad rep cuz of your bad comments. THIS ISO DOES WORK BUT ONLY ON PAL WII  CONSOLES!!!
,redwings765,2008-09-22T11:39Z,"sorry, i meant to say it works on all consoles but you need a pal tv and a pal compatible modchip. i have the d2pro with wiiclip. it work on my console but since the tv is ntsc the video looks wrong. had i a pal compatible tv it would run perfectly. also, you are a moron if you use wiiscrubber or anti wiibricker software. wiiscrubber makes it a pain to burn the game and use it cuz most people forget to include the key file in the download. anti bricking is stupid cuz if you just update your wii to the latest firmware of your own region the game wont ask you to update. if you are dumb and brick your wii anyway then just use a modchip compatible autoboot wii firmware restore disc. an autoboot disc will force the console to forget the menu and just boot the disc. good luck finding the firmware for your console though. also, you could use the wii recovery and diagnostic mode if you cant get an autobooting disc. basically what im saying is: if your a n00b, shut up, i dont want to see your stupid comments or questions online ever again. READ FIRST ASK LATER. that way you wont ask stupid questions like if the sky is blue or if grass is green. --the best and true hackers arent proud, bold or leet, theyre simple and discreet."
