,Shinn101,2007-04-15T00:43Z,"i don't know how to download games, after i use the torrent to download it, do i have to put it on a disk to play, or can i play it as soon as i download it."
,deathpanda,2007-04-22T07:13Z,Is there any fix for the Gm_res music file not working? Is it incomplete? Install gets stuck on it every time and won't finish.
,eci247,2007-10-11T21:56Z,"(above comment)
Happens to me too! WTF"
,matthew9823,2007-11-03T00:56Z,after you unpack it then what do you do?
,dregozo,2007-11-10T16:00Z,when i click setup.exe it tells me cannot find setup config file setup.env!!!! wtf
,Fainkviji,2007-12-14T19:27Z,no idea what to do. some more detailed instructions would be nice. >.>
,PurganMan,2008-03-03T02:25Z,"Here is how I installed the game:
1. Opened the containing folder with all the .rar's that were downloaded
2. Double-clicked bblack.part01
3. Extracted everything to the folder with all the rar's
4. After everything was done extracting, I mounted the ISO and everything installed."
,PurganMan,2008-03-03T02:26Z,"I forgot to say, when the folder comes up when the ISO is mounted, double-click setup."
,SamAJr1,2008-06-20T02:23Z,"i don't understand how to mount the ""ISO"".  maybe i'm stupid but what're you talking about???  after i extracted everything it gave me a ""bblack.bin"" file and a ""bblack.cue"" file but i dont know what to do with them"
,Azy_ano,2008-06-23T20:24Z,"SamAJr1, google Daemon tools
It creates a virtual CD/DVD drive than you can put (mount) an image file (bin/cue in this case) into."
,chamelion117,2008-07-21T07:21Z,"Unpacked with Winrar, mounted with PowerISO, and installed no problem.
20 minutes into a new game now and everything seems to be working fine.

Thanks for the upload"
,lewiscypher,2008-07-22T21:54Z,"Unzip with winrar or winzip, you only need to unzip the first rar file to the same file your already in. There should now have a bin file and an image file. You need Power ISO, Magic ISO, or I used nero complete. ( all available on the pirate bay) Left click the image file. That should bring up the program to mount the file. Insert disc. Mount. Use disk to install. P.S. you were all noobs once so don't be such douche bags and try to explain things clearly instead of making fun of people who don't understand."
,w00t13,2008-07-25T23:08Z,DAMN IT! why does nobody ever seed for a while?!
,BloodEngel,2008-09-07T11:55Z,do you need to use a cd-r or a dvd-r disk when you mount it
,lukeshep,2008-10-17T23:58Z,"Hmmm, unpacked it, mounted it in both powerISO and magicISO and same error message when using both programs...

""cannot find system configuration file [setup.env]!""

Any ideas anyone?? I'm using vista - is that likely to be a problem? Might try downloading it again."
,AriesRedRam,2008-11-30T02:11Z,"I don't have to burn anything to play this game, I just d/l it and mounted it and then the game title screen comes up and says install. Great game, especially if u love the hentai! I love this series.
Does anyone know how to burn this type of file though? If u wanted to make it into an actual cd-rom game so u wouldn't save it on ur pc?"
,countrave,2009-01-05T10:47Z,"....please help seed after you download

,lolerz69,2009-06-02T00:37Z,"can u help me guys..cause after i extract and use power ISO its says ""configuration file [a98sys] cannot be found! Start up from the CD-ROM"""
,almightymike666,2009-07-08T09:59Z,thanx for this game! its great that i finally got it. il continue to seed as long as i can which is a very loooooooooooong time.

,GermanSteel,2011-11-04T08:50Z,"ok people, i looked and almost all of you didnt know what to do, so that tells me that most of you are torrent noobs that just want pron, well im going to help you learn"
,GermanSteel,2011-11-04T08:52Z,"first you wanna get a ISO mounting program, try magic disk, power iso, daemon tools lite, or alcahol 120%. download the file,you wanna click on the iso file, then mount it using the program you downloaded"
,GermanSteel,2011-11-04T08:53Z,then after that just go as it were just the same as a disk in a hard drive..the only way you could fuck that up is if you didnt follow this guys directions
,Halibel,2012-03-17T00:08Z,"Thx for the sweet UL, Azy!!
