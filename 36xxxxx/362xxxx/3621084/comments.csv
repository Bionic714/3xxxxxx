,YourMomma,2007-02-19T06:06Z,Any chance we could get the 02/16/2007 Secret episode on Oprah converted to a smaller size as well?  Perhaps the 02/08/2007 aftershow that airs on oxygen?  I have DSL so it takes a while to download something that big.

I will convert those also as soon as I finish downloading them."
