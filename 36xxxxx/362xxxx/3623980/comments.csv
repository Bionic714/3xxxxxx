,infocom4ever,2007-02-27T17:59Z,"Boken var toppen men filmen satsar mest på att återuppleva illegala mexare och white trash(lite som en usel collegea film utan bara bröst, knulla eller  bira) men och andra sidan skulle alternativet vara att ha en berättarröst som malde i minst en timme. Ger tre pungsparkar eller tre polare i röven."

,rabbit182,2010-07-04T21:44Z,"Still downloading, surprised it's still being seeded. Taking a look at the comments and was curious as to what infocom4ever was saying in his awesome Swedish language. Using Google Translate, I was perplexed:
""The book was top but film invests most on to relive illegal mexare and white trash (a bit like a lousy collegea film but only breast, knulla or bira) but and other alternative would be to have a up as ground for at least one hour. Giving three pungsparkar or three pals in take ye the spoil.""

I couldn't agree more."
