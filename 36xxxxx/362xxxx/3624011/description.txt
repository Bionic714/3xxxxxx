Works like a charm under Windows Vista unlike Spy Sweeper. Detection rate is almost as high. Very good alternative instead of Windows Defender that doesn't seem to protect any system at the moment. Not sure if it ever will...

(My own scans validates this software as clean. Never hurts to check again before installing.)

CounterSpy V2 is the Only Antispyware with: 

Hybrid Engine. CounterSpy is powered by a hybrid engine that merges spyware detection and remediation with Sunbelt's all-new VIPRE (Virus Intrusion Protection Remediation Engine). VIPRE incorporates both traditional antivirus technology and cutting-edge antimalware techniques. This marriage of technologies enables CounterSpy to respond more effectively than other products to today's increasingly complex and blended threats.  

FirstScan? is a scan and remove on-boot technology that runs when triggered by a CounterSpy scan to root out deeply embedded malware, before Windows loads, where it can run or install. CounterSpy V2 is the only antispyware with FirstScan technology.
