,DanTheTrueMan,2008-06-24T09:03Z,"OK... I've been keeping this torrent alive by myself for a few months now.  I'm stopping if the the next person that completes this torrent off me doesn't seed.  I'm member of private torrent sites, I'm seeding public torrents for you guys.   If you are too selfish to seed, then screw you, I'm not gonna help you guys anymore."
