Uden serial nummer er spille intet hver.
Er der en der er 100% seriĂ¸s og kan ligge et rigtig serial nummer?"

,nutmaniv,2007-07-07T06:55Z,"I cannot get it to work. I mount it with daemon, install it, install the update and use the serial from the .nfo file and when I start the game I get a black screen(except for the start bar) and windows freezes for about a minute until I get an error that says ""AWD Executable has encountered an error and needs to close"". 

I'm gonna try redownloading it..."
