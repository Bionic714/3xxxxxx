,c1spike,2007-03-18T15:08Z,"How did you get this seen as it's not released until tomorrow? Just curiuos... Downloading as I type this and getting a d/l rate of 247KB/s 8-D
Cheers"
,letzsalsa,2007-03-20T10:11Z,Be warned before you download this... although Pirate Bay has indicated there has been more than 1 seed on-line for the past 48 hours I am yet to see one appear in the swarm.  I got stuck on 35% for a while but it now seems to be moving again at a snail's pace (1kb).
,letzsalsa,2007-03-20T14:19Z,"Still no seeds, this must be the slowest dl I've ever had from TPB!  Note: since my last post I have reached the dizzy heights of 36%!!!"
,letzsalsa,2007-03-20T16:46Z,OK... think we can safely asume this one isn't going anywhere from now on.  Anyone know why it says there are 3 seeds but in uTorrent there are zero of zero showing.  Plenty of peers on about 90% but I can't even reach that target!!!
,markyus,2007-03-25T03:55Z,Seed plz
,styroporgiraf,2007-04-06T10:55Z,Why are a lot of us stuck on 33.8% when many others have higher % ? All the ones with higher % uses Azareus 2.3.0.6. Why is that?
,GridVista,2007-04-13T22:38Z,what is ratio? plz seed! i'm also stuck at 33.8% :(
