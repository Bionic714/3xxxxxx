,Jay2oo6,2007-03-19T08:54Z,"Tom Tom 6 is a GPS (Global Positioning System), to help us with the roads and directions and yes, it is a mapping application. Overall, a very good and popular mobile application but it's necessary to know that which countries map does this download have ..... So, whoever post ""Tom Tom"" please make sure you also mention the map content. "
