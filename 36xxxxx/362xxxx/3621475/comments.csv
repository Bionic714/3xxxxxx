,EnhÃ¶rning,2007-02-18T22:47Z,Please help me seed this and spread the word about this torrent and the Hamachi server so perhaps one can get some capture the flag games going!
,EnhÃ¶rning,2007-02-19T00:27Z,Ok for some reason it does not start for some people in Win XP if you start it in compatibility mode for Win 98. If the game crashes on you when trying to start it then switch to compatibility mode for WIN NT 4. Sadly the read me file can be miss leading :(
,sneakyhenk,2007-02-22T08:17Z,"You can just start nox up via...

The directory were your file is installed, then click on game.exe works with all microsoft versions."
,Mlinker80,2007-02-24T20:13Z,"i d/l works fine. when try and run the 2nd online Program, to register says its down, this just for maintenence or is it like this always? ( i use toplay nox all the time been a while)"

,lordrogue,2007-04-14T01:30Z,"You don't have to use the hamachi server, there is still the USA master server which EA hosts (?) and usually there are some games up..."
,lordrogue,2007-04-14T01:30Z,"Not sure if you can play with invalid serial number though, I already bought it when it was new but I'll help seeding."

,natursweden,2008-03-08T17:06Z,Oh man!! This is one of the best games iv'e ever played! Back in the days I played this everyday. Nice upload and thank you very very much!!!
,darlakk,2008-03-23T08:17Z,Warning!!!! Avast Virus Scan found an imbedded trojan in this torrent! Do not download!!!!!
,Antonix16,2008-03-28T00:06Z,"greetings from Ukraine ;) please seed seeders, i need this game..."
,prod,2008-03-31T20:40Z,"NOD32 says it's clean, but my friend using Avast says he saw a few trojans in it.

Can anyone else scan with different AV software and confirm?"
,prod,2008-03-31T23:14Z,"Scrap that - I've tried with a couple of scanners (AVG Pro, NOD32) and it seems the release is fine. Avast seems to be pulling a few false-positives... I've not seen any rogue processes or any strange behaviour through zonealarm and wireshark.

The 'keygen' isn't a keygen anyway - it's a list of about 5 keys on a random pick when you press 'generate' (typical of the Eye Group). So if you don't want to risk running the keygen here are the keys it cycles between:

018242-676109-162214-8592
017934-718048-114782-5775
017988-148677-811020-0366
017896-376549-071924-5507
017989-190334-175336-2528
017964-168698-899296-3624

Hamachi can also be downloaded from www.hamachi.cc, and I don't think you really need the 'westwood online' tools unless you're planning to connect to the 'replacement' community westwood servers in the US."
,chucha00,2008-04-04T21:14Z,"Are there people who playing via hamachi?

Networks Nox! and Nox!2 are dead!"

,ComX,2008-05-25T12:30Z,Hamachi var en dålig idé. Man måste köpa hamachi pro annars kan man bara vara 16 free hamachi >.

,iwhatever,2008-09-23T13:28Z,"FYI: Since Diablo III won't be out for a while and Diablo II doesn't run very well under Vista, Nox is a good overhead dungeon crawler if you need a Diablo fix, PLUS it runs on the craptastic Intel 945GM graphics chipset and Vista."

,tobias6666,2008-11-20T19:05Z,"I hail you for this great game, and that wonderful walktrough to install the game! used to play this as a kid. How is the multiplay? never tested it. is it like you can kill other players? And get their items and stuff."
,DDDank,2008-11-26T20:47Z,can someone seed this beauty please...
[V],gansuk,2008-12-05T23:22Z,"torrent was fine, i have no audio ingame for some reson, but movie audio is fine, any ideas?"
,Petsumies,2009-01-13T15:08Z,Worked fine. Had happy time playing :) Thanks for seeders and author!
,godlikekiller,2009-05-25T21:34Z,"before instaling make sure you dont have any nettwork online, shut down nettworks before instaling and then you dont need to worry about virus and trojans"
,JackXIII,2009-07-13T08:42Z,"Game runs fine, got no virus pop ups, torrent is good, and the game is in ENGLISH!  And it's not key-protected, so you can just trash the KeyGen and go 11111111111111111  all across if you want.

Also, got one issue.  Graphics are all messed up, and I mean really messed up.  I can see what I'm doing, but it's just... a bunch of lines with fragments of other graphics all over my screen.  I'm running XP, I've tried compatibility mode on all ways, and all my drivers are up to date, what is my problem!?"
,drg0nzo,2009-08-13T20:42Z,"@JackXIII

You have to set Nox.exe and Game.exe to run in Win 98 compatibility mode. Will make those garbled lines go away."
,moopster,2009-09-15T08:35Z,"game crashes at start every time...
boo..."
,moopster,2009-09-15T22:12Z,"ah n\m...
apparently, turning on the option to unlock dx surfaces in the options caused that error...
so, i wouldn't bother with it...
though, it is safe to turn up the resolution...
also, gansuk...
it looks that by default the sounds are turned off, go to your options and turn them up ^_^
anyhow...
+rep and ignore my previous comment..."

,FyrixXemnas,2010-10-03T04:08Z,"Some of the software that comes with this download is not compatible with Windows 7. Just thought you might like to know, perhaps to advise future downloaders. I found that Deamon Tools and the Key Gen wouldn't work."

,dispatch88,2011-03-13T22:10Z,Yes! Thank you so much for this.  Brings back some good times.
,dispatch88,2011-03-13T23:09Z,"noooo, it was working but now its not.  I installed the game fine, I accidentally chose to play immediately after installing (despite the directions saying to change the compatibility). It worked anyway (the opening cinematic was flikering, but worked).  After the cinematic I quit so I could change the compatibility, but now when I start it, it crashes before getting to the menu.  "
,DixonNxn,2011-03-30T21:58Z,I had the same problem as dispatch88 - it crashes before it gets into the menu now
,Raener,2011-04-22T16:22Z,"Anyone having problems running NoX:

If you find the game is crashing/insta-quitting as soon as the screen goes black, a solution for me was manually setting the screen colour depth to 16-bit. You may also need to run in compatibility mode Windows 98. Finally, check if ""UnlockSurface"" is correctly set to 0 inside nox.cfg as it may cause crashing. You also need to have the nox.nfg mounted to play otherwise you'll need to find a NoCD crack for it. Always make a backup of the *.exe before cracking it in case it doesn't work."
,Raener,2011-04-22T16:49Z,"One last thing: Turn Windows Aero off before playing as it looks as if NoX can sometime have a hard time turning it off itself. It needs to be off.

Win7: Right-click your Desktop > Personalise: Scroll down and click Windows 7 Basic. (You might wanna save your current theme first at the top)."
,Blargh_7,2011-05-15T20:43Z,"thanx ""EnhÃ¶rning"" for torrent, and all seders!
