lyrics: 
Down on your knees, 
You'll be left behind. 
This is the beginning. 
Watch what you think, 
They can read your mind. 
This is the beginning. 
I got my moxie, and in my eyes 
This is the beginning. 
Well, my reflection I don't recognize 
This is the beginning 
We think we've come so high 
Above all the backs we've come down 
We face no consequence 
This is the beginning of the end 

You wait your turn, 
You'll be last in line 
This is the beginning 
Get out the way, 
Cause I'm getting mine. 
This is the beginning 
There are someones that can help themselves. 
This is the beginning. 
May be too late, as far as I can tell. 
This is the beginning. 
We think we've come so far, 
On all our lies been taken. 
They say no consequence. 
This is the beginning of the end. 

Edit: Thanks RewritingYesterday for moxie. That makes more sense."
