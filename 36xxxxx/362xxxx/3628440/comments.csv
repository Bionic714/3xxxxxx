,Arby,2007-03-01T08:18Z,"I would use different language but make the same point as the poster above.

I don't say thanks every time I grab something, but I'm acutely aware that someone is taking the time and making the effort to do something for strangers like myself for no gain, other than the pleasure of sharing. And I feel guilty (and should someday do something about it) about not doing the same. (I'm not tech savvy.)

THANKS uploaders!!!!"
