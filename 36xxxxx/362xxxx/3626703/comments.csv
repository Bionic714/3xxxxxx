,wankan,2007-02-26T12:41Z,"Is this better than your recent attempt at ""Night at the Museum"" (torrent since taken down) where the sound was out of synch ?"
,afoulks12,2007-02-26T14:47Z,"Yes it is...Night at the Museum was my fault I checked the beginning and end of the movie which was in synch, but from about 11 minutes to 55 minutes, it was out. Sorry about that, and that is why I took it down.

I checked this one about every five minues, and i could not see any problems.  Hopefully some of the people who have downloaded it now will comment."
,wankan,2007-02-26T15:26Z,"Okay , thanks . I'll give it a go then ."
,wankan,2007-02-26T16:12Z,Looking at the audio wave from the sample it looks as if the volume is set too high as the peaks flatten . Was this originally AC3 audio on the DVD . If it was I believe you need to drop the audio around -3db to get decent quality sound . Could be wrong though .
,wankan,2007-02-26T16:36Z,"afoulks12 . Have a look at the screenshot here to see what I mean (it's only a jpg) :

,hj34j3421,2007-02-26T18:06Z,All his stuff is CRAP.
,afoulks12,2007-02-26T19:19Z,"Let me see your ""stuff"".....thats right, all you do is download and bi@tch ...never contribute"
,hj34j3421,2007-02-26T20:24Z,"You think tricking people in downloading CRAP is contributing?
You suck."
,afoulks12,2007-02-26T20:25Z,"how is it tricking when I provide a sample....

you suck"
,hj34j3421,2007-02-26T20:29Z,"You said: ""Audio 9/10""
wankan says: "".. the volume is set too high as the peaks flatten.""
I believe wankan since your previous 'contributes' were crap too.
And yeah, I call that tricking."
,TimHortonsAddict,2007-02-27T07:19Z,So! Is it any damn good or what ? 151 Seeders... someone must know?
,ss4mbo,2007-02-27T18:51Z,how do i open a bin file? downloaded a couple now and don't know what to do with it - other than bin it
,nohead,2007-03-03T17:16Z,"Well, the quality is fine. I don't know the AR of the source, but it looks a little weird to me... Maybe it's because of the full screen..."
,che1800,2007-03-03T17:58Z,"I watched it with VLC, so, for what it's worth, here is my opinion:
	- decent image quality, aspect ratio not so ok at first, but VLC took care of that problem
	- audio ok, even if sometimes very slightly out of sync, but it's hardly noticeable.
 On the whole, decent quality and certainly viewable. Many thanks to the uploader anyway, it's an amazing movie."
,Wombat71,2007-03-03T21:34Z,"thank U it was good I think, and U who complain: U dont HAVE to dl ffs"
,Philcore_The_Loud,2007-03-10T23:57Z,"I'll give this a shot and even if it's not too good a quality I promise I won't bitch but just delete it. I think it's good to try and learn, so I give you the credit any"
,Philcore_The_Loud,2007-03-10T23:58Z,"... way... Okay, I dunno what the hell just happened. lol :)"
,Philcore_The_Loud,2007-03-11T01:15Z,"One hour three minutes, that's not too bad :) And as of now I am seeding. Get it while it's hot hehe. The picture quality is not too bad indeed, although for some reason the ""full screen"" doesn't fill up the full screen :) But doesn't matter. The sound however is a little out of sync, as mentioned above. And I think it is noticeably. Unfortunately I don't know enough about ripping and all to suggest anything ro help it, so I won't bitch, either, as promised :) I'll seed this for a cpl more hours although there's like 40 seeders online, what the hell. Thanks for the upload anyways. And don't worry about the out of sync thing, in Germany we say: Practice makes masters. :)"
,Ttes,2007-03-15T15:29Z,This one is really out of sync!... The sound is about 5 seconds late!
,Kalaha66,2007-03-29T01:01Z,Does anybody know where to find subs for this one. Swedish or English I don't give a f--k but I need subs!
