Sorry folks, this is a no frills torrent. I don't have the time to figure this stuff out. It's a clean DVDR, the spoken is English and I don't see any other text languages but then again, I wouldn't know how to look for them.

Feel free to ask questions and if I can find the answer, I will. If you have nothing better to do with your life than flame me for a cheap torrent, rock on. I couldn't care less and I'll refund you double what you paid for this.

For those of you who know and/or enjoy this torrent technology, bless you and don't forget to wipe your feet......no, I mean don't forget to seed!
