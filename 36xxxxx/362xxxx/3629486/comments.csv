,BDLidd,2007-03-01T21:16Z,"Pretty mediocre book: a pathetic fantasy about killing white women who sleep with black guys: sounds like it was written by a complete loser who never got laid. Of course, it was an inspiration for Timothy McVeigh to kill all those children in Oklahoma City. Another complete loser who never got laid...."
,aaron_fsp,2007-03-08T10:15Z,"Thanks for seeding this book.  
Obviously the systems followers
dont like it very much.  "
,Elohssa,2007-04-27T22:26Z,"Clearly this is an important work, in the same way as Mien Kampf.  It gives rationale people a window into a twisted mind."
,Warsie,2007-09-26T19:47Z,This book is fucking awesome. Reading it now/
,sam322,2008-01-21T18:58Z,Many thanks! 14/88
,intoxicatedemon,2008-02-01T05:45Z,"The Turner Diaries is a 1978 novel by William Luther Pierce (under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald), the late leader of the National Alliance, a white separatist organization. The novel depicts a violent racist revolutionary struggle in the United States that escalates into global genocide, leading to the extermination of all Jews and non-whites.[2] For Pierce, this was not a dystopian outcome, but rather the fulfillment of his ""dream of a White world.""

The novel was initially only available through mail order and at gun shows, and partially serialized in National Alliance publications. The novel is now available for sale through mainstream book sources or freely available from white supremacist websites. In 2000 it was reported to have sold about 500,000 copies.

The novel has been associated with a number of real-life violent crimes. Most notably, some have suggested that it served as the inspiration for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.

This is the book which the FBI and the controlled media have been claiming hysterically is the ""blueprint"" for everything from the Oklahoma City bombing to the takeover of the U.S. government by ""White extremists."" It is the ""Bible"" of the ""racist right,"" they say. "

,Dicedude,2008-09-12T21:53Z,Why on earth would anyone upload a pdf file that is secured? It's so lame.
,Tremors12,2008-09-13T02:35Z,"Great, thank you!"

,viedma,2010-07-03T20:42Z,ItÂ´s just the sick dreams of a neo-nazi that expresses the wishful thinking future as conceived by a very pathetic minority tied to its pet hates and frustrations. A very sad and ignorant bunch of eternal losers indeed. 
,DisOrder08,2011-03-08T11:11Z,"@viedma
