Use WinRAR to extract, then follow the directions in the NFO file.

Hope you like it!

(And please do your part and seed for a bit after you're done downloading so we can all enjoy these games/software!

,Gamma Mike,2007-02-23T21:49Z,"Sorry finka-05, all I see is ?????.

If you or anyone else has any questions or needs help installing the game, just post here (in English, preferably!).

I also have the complete Formula 1 Grand Prix series, from the original back in the 80's up to GP4. Anyone interested?"
,Gamma Mike,2007-02-23T22:38Z,"A little clarification on how to extract and install this game. It's a bit different compared to more recent releases. Sorry, it's not my fault, blame Myth! :)

Open one of the ZIP files with WinRAR. Click the ""View"" icon, and select all 65 ZIP files. Extract them into a folder. Open that folder and double-click the ACE file (WinRAR will start, or WinACE if you have it). Extract all files into another folder. Double-click ""setup.bat"" and let it finish. Then run F1Config.exe to setup your video card. After that, click on F1_2001.exe to start the game.

I'm considering re-packing it as an ISO to make things easier...

Have fun!"
