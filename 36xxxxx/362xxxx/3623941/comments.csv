Wow, nice work putting together the Complete Package of The Secret.  I been trying to find a seeder for: Oprah discusses The Secret - After the Show 08 Feb 2007- Is it possible to have that show re-seeded, there is also alot of peers waiting to have this as well.  I want to say thank you very much for allowing everyone to learn about the secret, it is appreciated.

Is it possible that perhaps your negative side wants to have nothing be nothing and therfor learn NOTHING. You poor soul. I pitty whatever made you so. (directed to mr. forever). P.S. Take the good and remember this: there is no such thing as can't just ""don't want to"""
