Download rate is only 5kb/s and it says 
good share rating.. (2.034 :-)) ?

Im using bittorrent.. I cant handle working those
firewall settings what the bittorrent advices me
to watch ""Please look into routing BitTorrent through your firewall in order to receive
the best possible download rate"" ...?

,shgirlfan,2007-08-19T00:32Z,"Don't bother downloading this!!  The sound is VERY quiet.  Even with the volume turned up to the max, you can only just hear it with headphones on.  Plus there are subtitles which is a pain if you're English-speaking.  Find a better torrent!"
,madmack2000,2007-08-24T23:06Z,"great quality, audio and video wise.. however, no goddamn subtitles when they speak russian/german etc..."
,Candide78,2008-05-19T19:26Z,Hi. Why are there several different file sizes for this movie? Is the movie resolution better for the 1.05GB compared to the more common 700MB file size?
