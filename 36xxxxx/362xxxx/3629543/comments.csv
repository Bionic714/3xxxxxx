,cvag003,2007-06-13T03:51Z,"THIS TORRENT SUCKS, IMHO! Why, 90mb is on the gamily guy episode. The wallpapers are just that, pics one can save from any website, in fact ONLY 14 pics/wallpapers!!!

Themes? JUST  3 THEMES!, of which the Vista one is the best! BUT you can download it by itself for less than half a mb!

Save your bandwidth, google k800i themes and get better themes, better wallpapers! Watta waste!"
