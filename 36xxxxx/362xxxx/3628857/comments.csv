http://imdb.com/title/tt0346491/

Some reviewers gave it top rating,  others said it was the worst film in human history."
[T],Knaster,2008-04-24T23:24Z,WTF this movie is full of homosexuals. damn gaypride propaganda
,josh2015,2008-05-21T23:00Z,"Knaster: 

Didn't you know, Alexander was bisexual :-p

And, what's wrong being gay, didn't you know that around 1500 species (animal species) have homosexual tendencies?

8% of all sheeps are gay
5% of all seagulls

and New york had gay penguins"

Lay of Knaster. I have gay sex with him most nights. He likes to pretend he's super straight so he can recruit other bi-curious college jocks at keggers. :P"
,nordhedning,2009-04-02T11:10Z,which languages are subtitled?
,Phoenux,2009-11-29T05:36Z,"There is nothing wrong with Alexander being a bisexual - which historicaly he was - my complaint with this film is that it overuses his homosexual side to make him appear weak and wussy. Historicaly, traditionaly and realisticaly, Alexander was a great leader who commanded his troops with poise, grace and the authority worthy of the tribute paid to his title - Alexander the Great. In this film, it can be interpreted that he was indecisive, weak and led by his advisors. 

The film itself is fantasticaly shot and is another masterpiece of cinema but the personalities that are exposed are a little off.

Thanks for the upload"
