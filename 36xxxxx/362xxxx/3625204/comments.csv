,Sunesnusk,2007-02-25T01:35Z,Thanks deathmule.  Doing a great job for us
,Poseurpete,2007-02-26T14:07Z,Why these have become so LARGE files suddenly? 350 mb files were quicker to download and the quality was good.
,jerkyboyz,2007-02-26T23:12Z,"Another great DVD, thanks.

Could someone help me with a problem. When I burn these files using Nero the film is in a strange ratio.  Its in 16x9, but the picture is stretched.

I have played with the settings in Nero but I cant seem to get a proper widescreen picture ????."

there should be a button on your DVD player that can change it so it wont be stretched"
