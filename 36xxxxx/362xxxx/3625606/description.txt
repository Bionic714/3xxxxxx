A complete reference for new Linux users who wish to set up and administer their own Linux home computer, workstation and/or their home or small office network.  The answers are meant to be simple, with just sufficient detail, and always supported with a readily usable example.  The work is still in progress, but we hope the Guide can be helpful already.


ENJOY :)
