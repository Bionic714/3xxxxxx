,the65thsquare,2007-02-19T05:00Z,"You're welcome. It was quite simple actually. I just ran a search & replace in the srt file. One or two HTML tags might still be there, but a quick glance shows that most, if not all, have been removed."
,anyzOK,2007-02-19T23:56Z,"you are pure greatness,,,

,OedipaMass,2007-02-21T05:16Z,how do i get the subtitles to work.  I tried the old and new file with no luck.  do i need vid editing software?
,the65thsquare,2007-02-21T05:47Z,"Use Video-Lan Client player (Google for it). If you are using Windows MP, then you would need to install a plug-in (Google for it too).

My recommendation? Get the VLC player. Select File-Open and then load BOTH movie and subtitles in the correct fields.

I used to have the subtitle plugin for WMP but after a reinstall, the plugin went missing and it is just too much bother to keep reinstalling the whole list of plugins including those for Matroska and other audio/video codecs for WMP. Besides, you can run multiple VLCs but not multiple WMPs."
,the65thsquare,2007-02-21T05:53Z,"Oops. Forgot. Usually helps to have both the movie and the subtitle with the same name. They should be in the same folder too.

Eg: ABC.avi and ABC.srt or XYZ. avi and XYZ.srt"

,-OLDBOY-,2007-02-23T14:19Z,"Seed, please! Very thankful for this!"
,the65thsquare,2007-02-24T15:59Z,"I'm always seeding, 24/7.

Please be patient, when it moves, it will move fast because the file is so small. I guarantee at least a month of seeding, maybe more if there is sufficient demand. After that I might place it on a webpage for direct DL. We'll see."
,SnowFire72,2007-02-25T13:29Z,I'm using VLC Media Player and when I loaded the subtitles I get  in front of every line of text. Anyone know how to fix that?

,sosolid,2007-03-04T21:24Z,"65th says ""and replace it in the  movie\'s directory for it to work?   
How is that done I don't understand that bit. So far I have the .avi file and the movie looks great but I want subs so now have srt without html named the same. How do I replace it in the movies Dir Please and thankyou aXXo and helpers. I"
,sosolid,2007-03-05T02:55Z,This HTML removed file came in handy as I was able to print out and read the subtitles during the movie. So thanks
,lozory,2007-03-05T04:09Z,"@ sosolid: haha u dont hav to print it out and rad it, u do as 65th said, rename it to exactly the same name as the avi (exept not .avi at the end of course) put it in the same folder as the avi folder, then using VLC click 'open file' then u can see there is also an option to open a subtiles file so u open both there (the avi and the srt) then when u play it, the subtitles r there sweet az"
,the65thsquare,2007-03-05T14:38Z,"@lozory:

You can burn it to DVD but it won't work in a regular DVD player. It will work on your PC though.

Conversion to DVD format requires some special burning software, but why would you want to do that since it is better to store this smaller AVI version as it takes less space.

I'm not sure how you burn subs and movie into one clip. I know it can be done but I've never bothered to learn how, preferring to have a 'clean' version of the movie with optional subs."
,lozory,2007-03-05T20:49Z,Yea i know that ay and i agree the only reason i want to convert and burn to DVD is so i can send the DVD to my parents cuz they want to see the movie but they dont have the means or inclination to watch it on anything but a normal DVD player. I usualy use ConvertXtoDVD which works great but it doesnt allow for subtitle addition. avi2DVD does but it cant read Xvid or DivX encoded avi movies! thanks for your answer anyway
,lozory,2007-03-05T21:28Z,"oh actually this movie is for a friend and his family but same situation, babel i wanto burn for my parents and that too needs the subs (aXXo supplied them this time)"
,wendy313,2007-03-12T06:36Z,Quality on this is outstanding. aXXo is truly awesome. Thanks for your hard work!

,userone666,2007-03-13T10:27Z,Yes.. thanks.. but it would be nice to seed a little bit too... please...
,lozory,2007-03-17T20:41Z,stupid me convertXtoDVD DOES support subtitle addition when burning to DVD!! i just didnt have the movie highlighted when i went to add them unbelievable
