In this movie (Kevin Chan) Jackie Chan impersonates a Hong-Kong cop, 
who scores his first big hit by virtually single-handedly arresting and 
capturing a very big drug-lord. The drug-lord is upset about this and 
frames Kevin with the murder of another cop. The cop Chan has to clear 
his name, whilst keeping himself from getting killed or arrested, and 
keeping his girlfriend from leaving him..For more information go to
