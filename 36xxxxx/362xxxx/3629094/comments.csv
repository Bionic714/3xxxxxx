,newt4208282,2007-03-04T20:25Z,"That sucks cause it worked fine for me, burned with nero and alcohol and ftp into a system and all of them work."
,mesohony,2007-03-04T23:47Z,does your xbox have a mod chip?
,jasonp6,2007-03-06T15:45Z,did you use a double layer dvd and what nero program did u use
,newt4208282,2007-03-07T16:40Z,"Is your system pal or ntsc? If its ntsc then clean your cache on the xbox, and burn it with alcohol or dvd decrypter. If you cant get this to work then you have to be doing something wrong. Could your burner be shot? Or possibly your dvd drive in the xbox? Last chance would be to try extracting the files out of the iso w/ qwix and then ftp them into your hard drive. This is a sure thing."
