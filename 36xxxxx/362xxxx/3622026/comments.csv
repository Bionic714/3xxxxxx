,candykane,2007-02-20T00:05Z,An updated 10.4.9 build has been released to ADC today.
,adisor19,2007-02-20T00:19Z,"This is a beta build of the 10.4.9 Update for real macs only. It would be nice if the uploader would post the build number.

[T],nobody2007,2007-02-20T10:54Z,"I don´t need any alpha, beta or delta if its not tested yet from anobody here. After installing this delta, my system says ""good night"" and shut down?
thnx for sharing, but I think that I can wait some days for real final updaters."
,pythonx,2007-02-20T18:55Z,"nobody2007:

""Delta"" is NOT a version or build stability indication. It is just a word for the update that can be used to update previous systems

There's ""Combo"" and ""Delta"" versions of the update. One to update all previous versions and one only to update the last one."
,pythonx,2007-02-20T19:03Z,"Where Delta is the one that can only be used to update the last version (in this case 10.4.8) and Combo is the one that have the combined updates for all previous systems of that generation (10.4.x -> 10.4.9)

Not to say that this isn't a Beta or Developer release (which it is), but don't get Delta confused with Alpha/Beta material as it isn't  an indicator of the code stability as those other two are.

10.4.9 seems to be on-hold from apple, it's been nearly 5 months since the last update. This is one of the longest times ever for a OS X system update to come. Apple is waiting for something else to release this update (or maybe they are just holding off to get a last, really stable, release of tiger on the streets)"
,emacnuel,2007-02-24T20:53Z,is 100 % real 
,ThreeDee,2007-03-04T23:21Z,"There's no real point is this torrent. No new features in this ver., and it's still being tested."
,emacnuel,2007-04-05T00:59Z,already this expired download from apple.com
