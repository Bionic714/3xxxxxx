,wankan,2007-03-01T01:01Z,"The only reason ""I"" asked was because it can be a bit irritating to see text being shown at the bottom of the screen that isn't needed ""for one's own viewing"" and can't be turned off . Kinda get's in the way and degrades the enjoyment of the film . A bit like seeing a Norwegian film with Chinese subtitles if you know what I mean . Thanks anyway .
