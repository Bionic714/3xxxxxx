|         |  | Image Line Software    has   released   the   much |  |         |
|         |  | anticipated   release   of  its   complete   music |  |         |
|         |  | production environment, FL Studio 7.               |  |         |
|         |  |                                                    |  |         |
|         |  | Representing the culmination  of more than 9 years |  |         |
|         |  | of  sustained development,  FL Studio 7  is set to |  |         |
|         |  | become the most flexible virtual music studio tool |  |         |
|         |  | in the industry.                                   |  |         |
|         |  |                                                    |  |         |
|         |  | Chief  Software  Architect,   Didier Dambrin   has |  |         |
|         |  | realized    his    vision     of    creating    an |  |         |
|         |  | open-architecture virtual studio environment where |  |         |
|         |  | the  only  constraint  on the users  is their  own |  |         |
|         |  | imagination.   This  philosophy  is  reflected  in |  |         |
|         |  | FL Studio 7's  flexible  audio  and  control  data |  |         |
|         |  | routing,    free-form    Playlist    design    and |  |         |
|         |  | interoperability     with    industry    standards |  |         |
|         |  | (VST/VSTi/VST2,  DXi,  DXi2,  Buzz,  ReWire, MIDI, |  |         |
|         |  | MP3,  WAV , OGG).  Didier  notes  "We don't try to |  |         |
|         |  | protect our data & come up with  new formats  only |  |         |
|         |  | for marketing reasons.  We use existing  standards |  |         |
|         |  | as much as possible, and allow  FL Studio  be used |  |         |
|         |  | as  a  plugin  in  other  hosts".   In  version 7, |  |         |
|         |  | particular  emphasis  has been  given  to improved |  |         |
|         |  | workflow  through  enhanced  interface design,  so |  |         |
|         |  | that  ideas  can be  crystallized  and  creativity |  |         |
|         |  | captured.                                          |  |         |
