Here they are, all 34 episodes of the Wacky Races from Hannah Barbera.
Originally they were transmitted in pairs to fill the 1/2 hour slots but here each race is a separate clip. On clip 29-32 english commentary is included as a second audio track (hence the slightly increased filesizes there. Also included as zip archives are the french and spanish audio files.

If this upload is proven popular (hint:seed, don't hit and run), Dastardly & Muttley will return shortly in their flying machines. TC & a (long) trip to the stonage may follow.

BTW, I'm probably not online 24/7 but rather from 7-22CET so just stay around and you'll get everything. And while my maximum upload speed is 1024kbps I seldom reach that during seeding. 768kbps is more normal if there is enough peers.
