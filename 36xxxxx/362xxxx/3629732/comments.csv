By the way, the first song is not instrumental, it was my mistake, becauce I wrote too fast.
That first song has a reputation as ""The anthem of Rhodopi"""
,cornel_tree,2007-03-01T22:36Z,"And another note:
In the late 80's some journalists asked Robert Plant (singer of Led Zeppelin) about what kind of music impressed him in last time.
Robert Plant answered that in the last weeks he's in love in the Rhodopean music."

,Negob,2007-07-27T12:57Z,Great upload. I've heard these kind of bagpipes played live in Varna and it was really cool. It was during the international choir competition. There was also a womens choir who were really fantastic. If anyone here knows where i can more bulgarian bagpipe music or bulgarian womens choir please write a comment about it.
,XenoSilvano,2010-12-22T14:24Z,Is there any chance of an FLAC version of this?
,gotaborr,2011-04-05T22:08Z,"Yes, I remember Carl Sagan's SPACE, where he said that song 8 was included on the gold disc on Voyager together with the Pytagor Theorem, Einsteins e=mc2 and a schematic pictures of male and female bodies as the ONLY musucal piece our spieces has produced. They chose it before Mozart and Bethoven!
If I had hair on my back it would stand up when I listen to this song :) it is somewhat so wild, scary and beautiful!
If any aliens manage to play that disc, they think twice before they decide to invade us :))"
,Crispapplestrudels,2012-06-29T22:40Z,"Thank you for the wonderful torrent!
About the bulgarian women's choirs there is a great torrent here on TPB! Just type ""Le mystere des voix bulgares torrent"" on Google and you'll find it.

Thank you again and best wishes from Romania!"
