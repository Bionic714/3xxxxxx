My first torrent, so be nice!

Hours of Fun -- is a collection of SNES, NES, Sega, and N64 Roms + Emulators.

-A gig or so of ROMS
-Most all roms work
-Play vs. HU/PC(depending on the game)
-Hook a game controller and use instead of keyboard, if you'd like
-Emulators are for Windows(but apple users can play too, I just don't know what emulators there are).


I'll be upload for...a while, until the majority of people have 100%

(please tell me if the torrent works/comments/whatever)
