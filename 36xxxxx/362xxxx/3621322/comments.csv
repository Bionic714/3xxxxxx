Are you a member of the group that releases these, a founding member of the Moviex site, or just someone who uploads their torrents elsewhere?  I just noticed that lately whenever there's a new torrent on moviex.info, it's not long before the same torrent is posted here.. by you.  I've yet to look into moviex's rules and such, but private trackers generally don't like their stuff posted around on public sites.  "
