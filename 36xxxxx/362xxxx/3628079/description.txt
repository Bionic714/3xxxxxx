PCSX2 is a PlayStation 2 emulator for Windows and Linux, started by the same team that brought you PCSX (a Sony PlayStation 1 emulator).

The PCSX2 project attempts to allow PS2 code to be executed on your computer, thus meaning you can put a PS2 DVD or CD into your computers drive, and boot it up!

The project has been running for a little over four years now, and since it's initial release has grown in compatibility. From initially just being able to run a few public domain demos, it's current state enables many games to boot and actually go in game, such as the 'famous' Final Fantasy X or Devil May Cry 3.

I have added various plugins as well as fixed exe for patches also utilities to input code breaker codes and to transfer gamefaqs.com savestates to emu memory card.

Enjoy this awesome Emu that runs FFX, FFX-2, Disgaea and other cool games I have yet to try!
