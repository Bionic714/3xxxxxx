,asdfen,2007-02-28T14:46Z,by the way has BIOS and everything included to play. What I mean by patches are cheats and hacks and it is a known bug that emulator crushesh when patch menu is accessed someone on NGEMU forums attached fixed exes that I have included here. Other then that this is official release. With god game pad plug in and some over plug ins that were not included in the official release.
