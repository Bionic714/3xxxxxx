,roopoo,2007-03-03T15:04Z,Any chance of a reseed? Havin probs with the download
,DjDesidera,2007-03-04T10:03Z,"Reseed? No m8, why reseeding a torrent that is not dead or corrupt?? 

Just hang in there and I'm sure everything will work out just fine...

regards"
,DjDesidera,2007-03-04T10:09Z,"""These movies were ripped/released by AnimeHQ
Stop posing.""

I'm not ""posing""...
...just sharing things I recently encountered.. The only thing altered is the .nfo

Stop waisting energy on these sort of comments, it's not like its going to get U what U want.. I think it never has.. 
Just appreciate the gesture and leave it with that.

N-Joy!!"
,DjDesidera,2007-03-04T16:01Z,"I guess that Ur just not one of the 15 peers that I allow to download from me directly, the rest of the peers will receive data from all other peers (leechers), nothing from me directly.  But no worries.. if U are connectable U will receive and complete this release through others then me. This evening it wil be completed by 15/20 users.

,Ignition1,2008-06-28T15:46Z,"this torrent doesnt work.
i downloaded it and it says
cant play because of codec 
problems. i couldnt even burn
the files on a dvd disc because 
of the patent restriction.
can anyone help me on this?
is it because its ntsc and im living
in PAL country?"

Google VideoLAN and download it, that should clear up codec problems for watching on the PC at least"

,GokuVegetta,2009-04-10T17:57Z,"thx for the great upload but plz seed
as soon as i finsh dling i would seed at 500+ "
,Naruto_TB,2010-04-18T08:16Z,"Thanks for the upload,i already had all movies but my HDD got formatted when some dummy was installing there OS with my HDD plugged in still.I recovered main all my software files but couldnt get my DBZ back.THanks alot for this.Downloading via torrent allways seems better than bearshare(old versions)"
,canopener,2010-05-16T03:35Z,Thx for the up. Though the audio seems to be Ocean Dub instead of the Funimation Dub. Goku and the gain sound really weird.
,dlarrym,2010-06-21T06:33Z,"@Ignition1: Your are mistaken, I just finish this download ad it works and plays AWESOME!! Your Media player is most like the problem your having. Try downloading QUICKTIME and then google PERIAN vs 1.1. This has the video an audio codec's for Quicklime then I have ever seen and the basic quicktime and perian is totally free. Quickime is also ported for PC's an and Intel Mac's and PPC Mac's about every format I have encountered. Give it a try.  VLC is another good player but if you start messing with the advanced options you can male it where ANY movie is not playable. Or it might not have sound or has sounds and NO VIDEO, (UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING) If you have a MAC, CHROME vs/ 9000.1 by mirailabs. GOOGLE 'mirailabs home website' and you can find it, it's not free. but for 19 US dollars considering how powerful it is, It was well spent as far as I am concerned"
,em0rox,2010-07-13T12:09Z,Anyone willing to seed this so I can get it and seed? I want my children to be able to watch it....
