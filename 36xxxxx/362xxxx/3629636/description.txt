-----------------------
Bay Area metal masters Machine Head are back with The Blackening, a glorious
follow up to the critically acclaimed Through The Ashes of Empires. An
evolutionary album, The Blackening features Machine Head staying true to their
roots with some of the heaviest riffs ever recorded while incorporating many
beautiful, melodic choruses. Produced by Robert Flynn (Machine Head
vocalist/guitarist) and mixed by Colin Richardson (Fear Factory, Cradle of
Filth, Bullet for My Valentine), The Blackening marks Machine Head's strong
return to the forefront of the metal world. A heavy, technical album that, while
rooted in 90s metal, pushes the boundaries of hard music well into the future
with songs like "Aesthetics of Hate," "Halo," "Now I Lay Thee Down," "Beautiful
Mourning" and more. Machine Head are Robert Flynn (vocals/guitar), Phil Demmel
(lead guitar), Adam Duce (bass/harmony vocals), Dave McClain (drums).

Enjoy!
