,Hypnosis4U2NV,2007-02-19T01:06Z,"Id use ZoneAlarms firewall and NOT their AntiVirus.. Alot of shit slips through so be warned.. Theres alot of other AV products out there, just dont use Norton or McAfee either.."
,theaterofdream,2007-02-20T20:52Z,Don't use this shit! Try the sygate! ZoneAlarm is weak.
,Security718,2007-02-21T12:59Z,"For theaterofdream....You should know that Sygate was purchase by Symantec all the way back in 2005. As far as ZoneAlarm firewall goes, it is one of the best available. It is tried and true."
,skaneskogen,2007-03-19T22:44Z,How to use the key generator?????? i dont figure out how it works.

,olifantje124,2007-09-09T21:46Z,It's just the old version 7.0.302 and not the 722; but works.
,ailsa1208,2007-10-07T05:14Z,This doesn't work for the latest 7.1 version anymore. I'm running vista 32bit version. Everyone said that zonealarm has found out and updated so this keygen doesn't work anymore.
,Athrael,2007-11-25T11:27Z,"It works great, thanks for uploading!!!

Zonelab is still working on 100%, I had a fucking trojan apr.2 month ago and it downloaded all its shit, and want to download many many advertising, and completely slowed the net, so I couldn't do anything... I tried all the antivirus shits I heard before, but they couldn't clear all mechanism of that shit. For last I just gave a chance to that zonealarm, enabled the antispyware and the antivirus and It worked!!! Still fucking slow, but It's working guys!"
,MicThaiSin,2008-02-11T03:41Z,"Its installed and everything but when I try to do the upgrades for the virus scan it is coming up ""Encountered a problem"" or something like that....Anyone know what I Do?"
