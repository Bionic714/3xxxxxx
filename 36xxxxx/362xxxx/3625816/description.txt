     The title is norwegian and in english it would be something like: Touched
     and Untouched. This is because some of the bands are unknown and are up and
     coming with no record deal (hence untouched) and some are established
     (touched).

     10 of the bands on this album are chosen as the best out of 17.000 bands
     and 33.000 songs, just to give you the picture of a camel through a needles
     eye. The 10 other bands/artists songs is expected to do well in 2007. 
     Now, press play.
