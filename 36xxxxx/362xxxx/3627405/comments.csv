,saggeklumpen,2007-02-27T19:07Z,I don't get it. You posted this yesterday but you are not seeding anything. What's the purpose? Are you fucking with all of us? Seed or redraw you upload.

[T],rkimble,2009-02-02T17:41Z,"Great rock film. Thanks.

Why make an ISO? Just put the VOB and IFO files in Nero and burn it."
,nemosrings,2010-12-22T08:50Z,"Midway down the description it says:
o Available Audio Tracks: English (PCM Stereo)
at bottom it says:
Available Audio Tracks: Englisch (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo) 

lol obviously the PCM lossless audio stereo was stripped away. Instead is an AC3 stereo track at 192 kbps.

I also wonder if the video on this has been 'shrunk'.  So unnecessary. What's a couple more GB for decent quality. But at least they're genuine dvd VTS Video files & not one of these crappy XviD or divx or other down-converted pixelated conversions. Wish DivX & XviD were banned & people got with the times. lol

I've been seeding this on & off for 18 months. It's obviously not a common torrent. Yet I see so many 'Hit & Runs' .. people running fast away as soon as they finish downloading & not sharing back to others.  Where's their brains for selfishness !!!!  And they wonder why torrents become seedless & die (no longer shared for download.)"
