,Doc Lithius,2008-09-06T03:49Z,Seriously.  Are those first three movies the Ocean Group dubs or the FUNimation in-house dubs?  I'd like to find out before I spend time downloading (and seeding) these.  ;P
,pseudome,2008-09-07T20:27Z,"Thank you for this, I love ""World's Strongest"" and really enjoy the other three in the pack, haven't seen all of ""Lord Slug"" though, and I haven't seen ANY of the others. I appreciate you making them available."
,Doc Lithius,2008-09-08T16:12Z,"Okay.  Movies 1 through 3 are the Ocean dubs (with Ian Corlett and Scott McNeil among others) while Lord Slug uses FUNimation's in-house crew.  All movies are in their UNCUT forms with swearing and blood intact as well as scenes cut from the TV releases.  Yes, even Ocean's movies are intact."
