,kiwi-guy,2007-03-06T07:35Z,"Hey, first of all thanks for the upload. Only thing is im experiencing this everytime i go to convert a file.

CLI Encoder has not been configured, open the file \Program Files\Illustrate\dBpowerAMP\Encoder\CLI Encoder\encoder.txt and change the extension.

All very good and well but what does one change it to?

Can you help please?

It still works but is annoying as it comes up every time.

Also - will we need to register this at all? I see no crack is needed, just curious as to why - how?

Many thanks on the upload."

,camposanto,2010-03-30T12:07Z,"Answering to kiwi-guy:

CLI Encoder uses external compressors (not native to dBpoweramp) to handle compression.

Using a CLI encoder requires intermediate to advanced computer skills.

If there is a choice to use a pre-created dBpoweramp codec (such as dBpoweramp's Ogg Vorbis codec, rather than oggenc.exe) then use dBpoweramp's instead, it will have better error reporting and ID tagging abilities.

If your CLI Encoder isn't configured for dbPowerAmp and doesn't like to uninstall it, open encoder.txt in CLI ENCODER folder at: \Program Files\Illustrate\dBpowerAMP\Encoder\CLI Encoder\encoder.txt
and change "".ext"" text into file to "".cli"" (ej.).

It's all. DbPowerAmp will never report this error again."
