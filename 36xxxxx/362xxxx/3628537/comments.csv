,KMHP,2007-03-04T08:05Z,It does work. Something I have noticed while using various bittorrent clients is that sometimes they will misreport having the entire file downloaded. If you run into a crc error while unpacking or an installation error it could mean that you don't possess the whole thing. I haven't used bitcomet in a while but in uTorrent once the file is done stop uploading then right click and force recheck then go back to uploading. I've seen it say 100% done a recheck and have it drop to 98%. If bitcomet azaerus etc. has such a feature can someone add that kind of information.

,Preed2,2007-03-14T20:36Z,"IMO the game is alot worse than i thought it would be, it has cool characters and the fighting is entertaining. But the dialogue options seem very thin for Bioware and i dont like them. Also the game is constantly interupted by boring movie sequences that only seem to be there to make the gametime longer and you are constantly interrupted and it makes it very annoying to play tho. 

The torrent and game works however, u need to open the CD and press setup for it to work tho, atleast i had to, cant install it from autorun."

To install this on Win. Vista

Step 1:
I had to extarct the whole iso to HD and the right-click the setup and choose run as admin.
(Do this if mounting it on Daemon doesn't work)

Step 2:
Once installed past the crack where the origenal exe is then right-clicked it and changed compatabilty to Win. XP (not sure you have to do this Step but it doesn't hurt either)

Step 3:
Right-clicked the Crack again and choose run as admin. Doing this enable you to save your games.

Hopefully this helps you :)"

,bloodstainer,2008-09-24T09:12Z,hey could some1 put out an unziped edition so people could just decide which one they would want to download i'm way to tierd atm to get this game seems like it's easier to go buy it some times
,Athmel,2008-09-26T18:43Z,"Too tired? To do what!? Download? You aren't doing ANYTHING! It just downloads! While you're in the bathroom, or sleeping or going out for a stroll. 

Fuck, is breathing laborious work too?"

Open the extracted ISO with Power Iso and select the Setup.Exe then a dialog pops up asking if you want to only run the setup or extract everything in a Temp folder. Select the second then it will(for some weird reson :S) Work, Thanks Jay-J for this solution(check his comment at page4 ;) )"

But there's no fucking charge for this, so stfu you whiny bitches, didn't your fucking parents teach you not to be such fucking douchebags."
,kraziaznvtboi,2009-02-23T12:05Z,"Anyways, I've got a problem besides a zero installation and not being able to unpack.

It's where the setup aborts the installation of certain files required to run the game like any executable files or dlls.

It took some figuring out to but instead of using the setup, just manually unpack all of the .rar files in the data subfile in the image to the installation folder and it will be like a full installation.

This can solve the zero kb problem and the one I just mentioned.

After that just crack and run.

If your system specs can't handle the game, try 3D-Analyze, it changes the settings of the game that it's normal configuration settings won't allow you to do, so you can hope to run it, just google it.

After setting it up, select the crack in the installation folder, and check Force SW TnL in the Performance category, and press run.

To increase frame rates, adjust the config in the game to disable Bloom, Soft Shadows, etc.

Happy Playing!
Never complain about free beer."
,kraziaznvtboi,2009-02-24T11:22Z,"Oh yes, and you can also disable vertex compression if you experience some funk.

Open JadeEmpire.ini file in a text editor.  Under the [Render] section will be a line that says:

VertexOpt=1

Change the 1 to a 0 (zero) to disable vertex compression and try running the game again."
,theguru62,2009-04-07T03:52Z,"im having the same problem as someone else here, i extracted one of the rar files when i first opened the folder. got the iso and then installed the game, but then when i try to load it up i get 

Wrong disc inserted.

Please have a look at http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=wrongdisc for further, more detailed information.

I've solved this problem this way: I tried to setup the game one more time - so I've already had the destination folder - and setup showed right 6.9 Gb in the 2nd tme. Luck!"
,Arion221,2009-09-15T17:45Z,I also got Zero installation but it's solved by open up the rom and install it by the setup icon rather then auto.

,iamtempo,2010-03-18T00:10Z,"I can confirm this works just fine. This version also includes the intro and movies. 

1. Get the crack with this game.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3628918/Jade.Empire.Special.Edition.CRACK.ONLY-ViTALiTY
2. After extracting, open iso. (I used Power ISO)
3. Use setup.exe, not autorun.
4. When finished, extract crack and replace it with the jade empire.exe. (Located wherever you extracted it to, Program Files etc,.)
5. Double click the cracked exe and play.
Loved this game back on the original xbox and still do today."
,Kyo250,2010-04-02T13:50Z,"So I downloaded this one, the whole extractingprocess went fine but like so many others I got this 0.0Gb install problem.
The installfolder is empty and the whole installation takes like two seconds, so I tried going ""into"" the disc and going trough Setup.exe, the thing is that I get the exact same thing as with normal autorun, zero files in the install directory. 
Any fresh ideas?"
,HeeroValentine,2010-06-09T23:20Z,"Kyo250, read the post above you...
just explore the disk and you'll see the setup.

use that one and you'll be fine, autorun isn't working correctly."

,GrandmastaL,2011-05-31T02:46Z,"I can confirm that THIS TORRENT WORKS. Here's what I did to the best of my knowledge. Make sure you have an ISO file reader. And see last comments at the end of instructions. 


1.Download Torrent(no shit)

2. Klick on Torrent, in your preferred Torrent-Downloader, and see if you can open kontaining folder which holds all the files inside.(Torrent should say Jade.Empire.Special.Edition-ViTALiTY) 

3*.This may be the most potentially confusing step...when you open file folder you should see lots of files named vty-jese and vty-jese.r(x) (x will be a number i.e. vty-jese.r30). Click on ANY VTY-JESE .RAR (the ones that say WinRar and what lookz like kolored books) FILE NOT VTY-JESE.R(X), leave those alone. 

4. When you klick on a vty-jese winRar file, it should open up another window with the selected file, then you should see an vty-jese iso file (Well i have Magic Iso so it looks like a small disk). klick on it and extract it to wherever yonder i dont think it matters. I extracted mine to the deskTop.

5.When you see where you extracted it right click on it and you should see an option that says open folder. When you do click on the file that says setup make sure you do because THE AUTO-RUN INSTALL DOESN'T WORK. 

6. Wait awhile till its finished then go here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3628918/Jade.Empire.Special.Edition.CRACK.ONLY-ViTALiTY. And download torrent from there

7. Once new torrent is done kinda follow steps 3 & 4 which is to extract the crack and replace old (or should i say recently downloaded??) jade empire.exe. (Located wherever you extracted it to Program Files, Desktop, etc.).

8. Click on newly cracked jade empire.exe then play

*Just Click only one of the vty-jese.rar files, there are all the same...i think
--------------------------------------------------------
Feel free to ask about my instructions if they dont make sense, Im only on Ch.2 past bandit Leader in Ch.1 and so far no crashes, but i do admit im early in. 
And make to read the past (or who knows, future lol) comments to fully clarify things. I know it sounds nerve racking to install but its actually easy just know the basics of cracks, torrents, torrent-downloaders, and iso readers."
