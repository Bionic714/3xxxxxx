It's available for free from the website of the author or on thepiratebay."

Thanks! Also now I can recommend it to my non-muslim friends who keep asking for books. I advice other muslims too to share this book with as many of their non-muslim firends as possible.

I'll be checking on your torrents for other good downloads too."
