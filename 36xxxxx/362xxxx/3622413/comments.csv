,eleseur,2008-04-28T02:31Z,"@crankycracker

You have been nominated for the biggest douche in the universe award. Go suck your own nuts, no one wants to hear those retarded comments about buying albums and supporting the RIAA. You are on a fucking torrent site, don't be a little faggot. Just kill yourself and make it easier on the rest of us. God bless."
,NoffDaddy,2008-04-28T18:59Z,"Crankycracker i do by albums, i work on a nice 1:3:4 ratio. Buy one, download three, seed four! "

,phatman54321,2008-06-20T06:46Z,"once you have downloaded the file... leave in on uTorrent and it will automatically seed

if you remove it from uTorrent... you stop seeding

thank you for the great torrent!!!"
,FunkTrooper,2008-06-21T15:59Z,"Just thought I'd point out that the version of The Sufferer and Witness here it the pre-release (leaked) version.

Thus, you get an extra track, but the sound quality is not as good as the final release.  Having said that, it's not as dynamically compressed and it has less clipping than the finished version.  Also, it lacks the ""This is noise"" intro on the first song."

,MikePush,2009-09-26T15:44Z,"Thanks a lot for this pack! It works just perfectly, I use 
1) ESET NOD32 SmartSecurity Business Edition v4.0.417 Retail Precracked
2) Nod Enabler 3.0
Of course I update it manually, *by clicking update* [wow that is soooo bothering >:O] and it catches all of these fucking trojans and bans all the fucking ips I wish it to ban!
Thank you once again, have a great day!"
,MikePush,2009-09-26T15:45Z,":O pardon this... it was offtopic... I meant to say I really like this band since I heard Drones... Thanks for this torrent, I'll try to help spread this for a while ^____^"
