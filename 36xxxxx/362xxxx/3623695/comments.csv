Why do people keep compressing albums?

1. Garantees integrity
2. Simple management
3. Why do you even bother commenting/and/or downloading?? If you don't like what's offered go elsewhere.
4. It more 1337 :)

1.compressing stuff is very good thing to insert a virus 
2. U can't see how long are these songs,
3. won't touch this - hence lost seeders"
