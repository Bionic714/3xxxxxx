If you use the mht file to direct download the avi's, please share the load of seeding, as I am in New Zealand which is renouned for having the slowest internet in the world (average person is still on dialup)."

,NDog,2007-04-14T22:57Z,"This torrent has reacahed +100 % now, so I will be pulling out of it. After 3 months uploading 20GB at 7kb/s on a laptop is pretty good eh lol. Anyway just read the mht file to get the megaupload links from there, if noone is seeding from now on!"
,ArghMatey2006,2008-06-17T21:01Z,Why are there 70 episodes? I thought there are 56.
,NDog,2008-08-08T15:58Z,"@ArghMatey2006

This is the DVD version which are slightly shorter than the TV-Series version which is about 56 episodes i think. Hope that answers your question."
