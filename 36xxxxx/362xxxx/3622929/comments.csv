,kolokythis,2009-10-29T16:00Z,"Keep in mind that the key provided is no longer valid for updating in newer versions, and it's essential to apply the patches in order to get rid of the numerous bugs. It's better to download and use Razor's keygenerator (in TPB the torrent still have seeders). Then install 1.05, 1.08 and 1.14 official updates. From gamecopyworld.com download and apply a 1.14 crack (preferable Skidrow's) and that's it."

is it possible to crack this game so you can play online without the CD-Key invalid pop up then returning you back to main menu???

i have looked at a few articles on the web about disconnecting to play on LAN with HAMACHI but i really wanna play this on internet!


Dont give me crap like ""JUST BUY IT!"" kinda thing.   yes i know i should just buy it but this game is nearly 4 years old and i dont feel like paying 20-30 Dollars for it.


Thank You"
