,Ninjachaser,2007-02-21T22:47Z,material I haven't seen before. thnx man
,made-of-technetium,2007-02-22T11:31Z,Picture & sound quality is excellent.

,MASTER_NINJA,2007-02-24T11:24Z,"is this the zappa queer version if so it sucks big time

dont waste your tume on this crap

besides since this is an offical release i guess the little bunck of girls were to scared to torrent it at their pathetic web site !"
,Drew51,2007-02-25T13:18Z,I think somebody's jealous!
,made-of-technetium,2007-02-25T14:56Z,"""It kills me the world thinks it's about us, hates us more than the terrorists. We are the same people as helped in WWII. We have not changed at all. Germany never attacked the USA. Are you glad we were pre-emptive in WWII? Are we going to learn, or are you going to put your head in the sand? It's about time you guys grew some balls.""
No you where NOT pre-emptive in WWII. You joined in because Japan attacked you, before that you were quite happy to sit back & watch, rubbing your hands gleefully together as you managed to lift yourself out of the great depression by milking as much money out of Europe selling us arms so that by the time the war ended Europe was skint & America was on it's way to one of the most prosperous times in it's history."
,made-of-technetium,2007-02-25T15:22Z,"""Nobody spends more money than us on the world's problems. We give more to help feed, and prevent disease than any other country. It's not even close. We have shared our wealth big-time.""
Not true America only gives about 0.1% of GDP compared to Europe giving about 0.39% of GDP "
,Drew51,2007-02-26T22:52Z,"You not counting private donations, and we rebuild Europe remember? I agree we sat back, the democrats didn't want to fight, and like today they were the majority. The right wanted to fight from day one. So yeah the dems are the same, and us conservatives were always with you. Why? I'm not sure, the way we are treated, your post is a perfect example."
,Drew51,2007-02-26T23:00Z,"Your numbers are wrong anyway. I think you sight the whole problem in Europe, you expect the government to do everything. Here...no thanks, we know how poor the government handles things. Fact is our standard of living is rising, soaring beyond yours...keep counting on the government. And the amount of hate there, jeez, nobody likes anybody, you all bitch about each country. Here, the states are cool with each other, it's all good. Private institutions donate more than all the world together. As private industry capitalism is the only way to go. "

,DLHotch,2007-03-06T15:57Z,"I find it amusing that a comment I made about Drew in an entirely different forum and context would suddenly show up here, where until today I would never have registered or logged in because the general kharma of this particular tracker makes me want to puke.  However, when I saw my comment reprinted here, without my permission, of course, I figured I'd better log in and thank ninja for posting my message.  He obviously thinks highly of my opinions and knows they are expressed much more distinctly than he could ever manage or else he'd just stick to making his own insipid comments.  I find this use of my comment as quite a compliment of my thinking skills and an acknowledgement of my superior talents over his in general, however I must turn the tables on him.  After all, we've all seen that his lack of knowledge of the rules of spelling and rules of grammar along with his annoying use of capitals instead of a developed vocabulary to make his point shows an incompetence in formulating and expressing opinions as well as others can, especially mine in this case.  Moreover, the use of someone else's comments in such a manner shows a lack of social skills and manners and indicates a childish, self-centered mentality at work.  So far I've seen nothing to indicate otherwise in his comments and actions here or anywhere else.  Since he does hold my opinion in high-regard or he wouldn't quote it, here's another opinion for him.

MASTER_NINCOMPOOP, (I use the same caps you do in appreciation of your fragile ego as you expresses it by the belief that large letters look important), if my comments against Drew are so precise that you feel the need to quote them in your own defense then the comments I've made against you quite frequently must be equally valid, right?  That comment of mine that you went to zappateers and stole, (wait a minute, you hate them because they're all liars and thieves, don't you?) was cut-and-pasted and begs the question of just how pathetic that kind of behavior makes you look.   In contrast, this comment was put here by me in The Pirate Bay so everyone has the opportunity to know all about the background that led to it.  MN, you are without a doubt the lamest, dumbest, most worthless human being I have ever encountered anywhere in my life.  Having been banned from every legitimate torrent tracker for fraudulant posts and assinine behavior, you've now proven fully at this one as well that your torrents suck, your comments suck and you most certainly suck since every time you try to defend yourself with your own words or the copied-from-elsewhere words of others you just make yourself look even more ignorant and foolish.  Your best defense is to vanish from the internet and never post anything, anywhere, ever again.  Can you handle the pressure?  Clear enough?  Indisputable?  I know you can't resist, so go ahead and post this comment anywhere you like, since you and everyone else who reads it knows it's more credible than anything you'll ever come up with yourself."
,DLHotch,2007-03-06T16:21Z,"I see that the lack of an editing function in this cheapass program has left a grammatical mistake in my previous post but I doubt that my target will find it.  Reading back I also see that my quoted comment was not credited to me, so here it is:

i am in possesion of over 150 zappa master tapes from 3 differant tapers

but due to the lies of the zappaqueer's

,MASTER_NINJA,2007-03-15T09:08Z,"I had a chance to listen, and the pitch sounds ok, though yes, you can tell a different source. Some high end missing, louder mid-range in fill. I also noticed my wife speaking in the left channel in one sample. Sorry about that! Notice I didn't say anything and my frantic attempt to shut her up, failed. Anyway if you make it mono, by channel conversion, and then slightly change pitch, of one channel, it blends better. You can eliminate the talking. Yes, you will hear a little change, but the talking is worse I think. Another method that would lessen talking would be to redo left channel by making it 80% right, 20% left, and this way you still have a stereo image, less change in sound, talking would be lowered, trying different percentages may yield better results. Also heard a little static, which would be harder to eliminate, though same method may work, sounded as if one channel only. To me, this is not mastering it's repairing.





good to see the zappaqueers have finally release  its important to master so as not to spread crap !

GOT RID OF THE NOISE !


Hiss happens. So does ground hum, computer noise, and any number of unwanted sonic artifacts. Bring on Z-Noise, and hear them disappear. Featuring real-time noise profiling, innovative transient preservation, and increased low-frequency resolution, Z-Noise truly is a revolution in noise reduction.

,MASTER_NINJA,2007-04-24T09:47Z,"Recently it was suggested to me that the USA was responsible for the destruction in Lebanon. I didn't hear a reason, I guess it was because we gave military weapons to Israel. 
This is like blaming the gun. Using that same logic I argue it's Saudi Arabia's fault as they gave us the oil to make the weapons. They got it from the dinosaurs, who were made by God probably so it's really god's fault! 
You know you target children, you get bad Karma. No let's not blame Hezbollah or however you spell it? Before 911, Hezbollah killed more Americans than any other terrorist organization. So they are on the list baby. We're coming... 
It just surprises me that one would blame the USA, and not this organization. The world is one fucked up screwy place! 
I was also told we can't be trusted (the USA) because we killed the Indians. Yes, this is very strange, nobody alive today was involved, but I guess that doesn't matter. To make it even more strange this guy was Italian, you know the Romans! So this Roman is lecturing me on pillage, death and destruction. Is this a fucking dream? You have to be kidding me right? No, he apparently doesn't know his own countries history and had the nerve to lecture me on mine, and suggested a book on American history. OK.... 
So what I need is a recommendation he should read on the Roman Empire? Any suggestions? 
Just kidding, I swear, some people have some very bizarre logic, and I'm just glad I'm over here in the USA, as a movement against freedom no doubt is developing in Europe. The resentment of the USA spreading democracy has been met with stern resistance. I never thought I would see the day so many believe that one should not have choices, should be told what to do, where to go, etc. Not be their own man. Not have the freedom to choose, or to leave. In other words, not democracy. But this is a growing trend, the youth culture resents the USA big-time for giving people choices.

One of the 7 circulating shows from the MOI 10 Years Anniversary tour, never seen as lossless according to The Catalogue. 
When I located the tape flip in Inca Roads, I recalled a little 10 min snippet of this show that was in circulation before this tape surfaced in 1999. Didn't that snippet include Inca Roads? I knew I had it as filler on a tape somewhere in my messy collection, but I couldn?t find it. Luckily enough, Drew had it, and yes indeed: the missing piece of Inca Roads was there! 
Still this is not the complete show: Son Of Orange County cuts near the end, and the recording doesn't resume until late in the More Trouble Every Day solo.
