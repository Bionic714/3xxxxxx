Use the Serial in the txt

Restart the program nad its not trial anymore :D"

,HeadfulOfHectic,2010-06-21T15:54Z,"Just a reminder for future downloaders: On Vista or W7, run MilkShape as admin when registering or else it won't be registered when you reboot the app.

Thank you! Works wonderfully. :D"

,starwolfff,2011-06-23T14:28Z,"I'm writing the serial, with a capital D, and it says ''thank you for registering, blablahbla, you need to restart the application'' All of that is normal, but when I open it up again, it says: 31 days left to the trial. I tried many times, with or without the D capital at the end of the serial."
,JenMog97,2012-04-12T17:39Z,"mines the same, i have registered with a capitol D and lowercase D, it tells me 'thanks for registering' then it tells me to restart the application, so i do and the message comes up saying it expires in 31 days, any ideas, thanks."
,JenMog97,2012-04-12T17:41Z,"its ok now, thanks HeadfulOfHectic."
,nikolajo,2012-06-20T19:43Z,"i have a problem...
I installed the trial a few months ago (before this download) and it expired.
now when i register it and than re-run it again...
it says:
""You seem to have registered after the trial has expired. Please run for atleast 2 minutes to complete registration."" 
So i wait 15 min doing a project , than i try to save it and it says: 
""your trial has expired , please go to ""website"" to register"""
,Cool7days,2012-07-24T18:25Z,Wow! Thanks mate.
,undomove,2012-08-25T17:21Z,"i hope this will help
problem with the 30 trial etc...
first install the application
second disable internet conection
go register your new app
enter code or key
enable internet 
and start your program
this is primary for most code or key problems
worked for me billion times 
cheers!!!"
