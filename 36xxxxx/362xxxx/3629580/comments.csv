,wjs,2007-03-01T17:59Z,"I only wanne say ?thanks dude?,
I live in the south of France (but I?m Dutch!), here, the 3rd season off Lost will start this summer, but it?s in French, I mean, they don?t speak English, they translated it into french! So I can?t express how great full I?m! I downloaded them all! And in excellent quality!
Great serie, keep them coming!

Again, thanks!

,breagen,2007-03-04T00:48Z,"Hi, I downloaded a couple of these but can't seem to get the audio to work.  The video feed is fine but no audio is coming through; do they have to be burnt to disc to get audio or am I just missing a codec or something?"
,alkira_77,2007-03-05T00:56Z,Thanks deathmule : ) loving yoru work
,Old Grey,2007-03-05T12:59Z,many thanks Deathmule - my cable company stopped showing the 'lost channel' (sky one) in the UK 2 weeks ago after getting us all hooked - your a lifesaver and all my friends and family salute you!
,urkazz,2007-03-05T23:27Z,"Next time please use .avi instead of frekking .vob. Sure it works, but it messes up everything. Dont know what sub to use and the aspect ratio is wrong. And you can actually burn .avi stuff aswell. Who uses .vob anyway? The quality is just the same as avi. :\
But next time, try to upload quality stuff instead, like 720p and ac3 sound etc. Puss o kram. ;o"
,besk1,2007-03-11T23:43Z,Can anyone tell me how to burn more than one episode to a disc? cheers. I'm a bit of a n00b at this.
