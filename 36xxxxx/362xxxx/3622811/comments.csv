This is an awesome, jawdropping solo of Marcus Finnie playing the song ""Slightly Dirty"" of legendary guitar player Larry Carlton... This clip was shoot with an a tiny camera, sound is aweful and saturated but image is good (640x480) and I was afraid some security crew took my camera. But I keep it there and this is a great memory I want to share of this this concert... "
