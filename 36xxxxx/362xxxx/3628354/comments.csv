[M],Lollash,2007-07-08T21:05Z,pretty boring film. Seems more like a girl movie.
,bc1990,2010-11-22T22:09Z,can't have girl movies!
,chopper2009,2011-01-16T08:37Z,"Haven't seen the movie yet, but the last comment was really stupid. Girl movie?
I'm so fed up with american action movies I can't take it anymore. This sounds much more interesting.
I have seen anaother film, Fish Tank, by the same director as Red Road and it was great if you like realistic drama in modern urban life. You would probably consider that a girl movie too, but at least I feel something after watching that movie unlike after watching an action movie."

,gillpatt3,2012-08-11T13:07Z,I'm fed up with people saying whether or not they liked the film on torrent sites - this is not the place. Please comment on the quality of the video and the audio!!
