,Thecandyman,2007-02-25T17:06Z,"Audio is better than video, but it's watchable.. Seems the camera will focus in and out every now and then, perhaps he had auto focus on? Anyways, it's not bad.. Great upload.. Thanks!

charged if I go over 20 gigs up!,thank you for the OCR Alert of this film that would have been a waste of bandwidth on my end.The cam is good."
,chigonzo,2007-02-26T17:13Z,"Wow.  Is everyone who uses this site an immature 12-year-old with horrible grammar and spelling?  Grow up, people.  Download it or don't.  Wow.

/I bet the weather's real nice outside of your mom's basement.  Not that you would know."
,mongoose84,2007-02-26T17:22Z,"You hear people caughing in the cinema, and people opening soda cans, and even how they are making noises when opening their bag of potato chips! lol!!!! kind of annoying but u get that cinema feel "
,dan113,2007-02-27T11:53Z,audio and video dont match up by any strech of imagination is there anyway to sort this out. good visual copy though
,shagster,2007-02-27T18:20Z,dont waste your time downloading this people its not a very good copy even for a cam its poor. my advice is wait a little longer for either a screener or the real dvd rip save your bandwidth download something from aXXo
,DarthMaulVaderC4,2007-02-27T19:42Z,"GOD! The idiot who filmed this obviously has no concept of how to use a camera. IT'S CALLED MANUAL FOCUS, FUCKTARD! Jesus, you cant even tell what the hell is going on half the time because he left it on auto-focus. Spend the 8 bucks and see this in the theater."
,ferreno,2007-02-27T21:06Z,i am going to look at this movie at the cinema and i am so exited!!!!
,Allisoj3,2007-02-28T08:41Z,"I wouldn't bother, this movie stinks beyond pungent. "
,bren72,2007-03-05T00:13Z,"poor quality due to auto-focus blurring, especially at climactic moments, and the constant sound of someone eating popcorn close to the camera"
,pmsbull,2007-03-08T10:45Z,"SAW THIS AT CINEMA LAST NIGHT. Very long and drawn out leadup to an interesting half hour conclusion. Would have been MUCH better if lead up had been handled better and paced better, but worth sticking with to get the answer...""What is 23?"".
Well I know, but that would be spoiling....
7/10"
