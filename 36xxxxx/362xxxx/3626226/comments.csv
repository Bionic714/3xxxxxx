,wissing_the_one,2008-11-21T20:06Z,Hey davbax you can burn any movie whit Nero. are there any of you ho now where i can get Eragon 2?
,Z3lph3r,2008-12-17T23:16Z,"wissing_the_one, if you mean the second movie, it has not been made. This is the only movie made about Eragon, i believe.

And, how do you get the subtitles to work? I only get English audio when playing the ""VTS_01_0.IFO"" file, which seems to be the movie...I'm using windows media player classic (CCCP)"
