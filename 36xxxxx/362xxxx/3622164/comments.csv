,shoeshoe,2007-02-19T21:13Z,"orvon,

I'd love to grab this, but can you provide any info on the rip specifcations? There was an earlier rip that had Qpel and GMC, and therefore was not playable on my standalone.

You can use mpeg4modifier and click 'video info' to get specs if you'd like."
,sextuse,2007-02-20T21:18Z,Looks like a vhs-ripp. I'll rather buy the dvd. 
,worthajob,2007-02-22T20:41Z,"all torrents and seeds welcome but info
on quality etc is always helpful

this is a poor quality (vhs?) video with an
annoying hiss on the soundtrack and oversized
english subtitles

this is a brilliant film - only d/l if you cant buy or borrow a dvd"
,meg7m,2008-08-08T19:19Z,"thanks so much for this! the picture quality was quite good for a VHS rip. The only thorn in my side was the gradual loss of the synchronization of the audio and video, which i could deal with because i don't understand italian anyway and the subtitles are great. :) wonderful movie and a worthwhile download.  grazie:)"
