,LR777,2007-03-26T23:49Z,"I cant unpack and install correctly.  Where do I unpack rar file to?  My NFO file is corrupt

I cant figure where .exe file is in here.  Also, my system says that NFO file is corrupt.  I tried unpacking RAR file, but no luck.  How do I  unpack and install properly?  Thanks..."
,Spartan25,2007-09-12T20:56Z,Open the nfo file in word pad. Then don't use rar to do anything but unpack it. Use Alcohol 120 to load the .cue file.

Can anybody tell me what's wrong?"
,gravenicholas,2008-01-14T01:43Z,Downloaded and installed this game fine but it runs kind of slow and laggy. Have tried changing the compatibility for win 95 and 98 and in 256 colours but it makes no difference. Anyone got any ideas ?
,paukas1,2008-01-30T13:38Z,Thank you comrades will never forget this!!! Motherland will remember your heroism!!!

,kleistgrun,2008-05-30T18:40Z,"Confirm Trojan please? Usually i ignore alarms but already 3 people out of 14 comments said so.

Thank you."
,aa331100,2008-07-11T16:47Z,"Well, I remember installing this quite a long time ago and  there were no problems for me. Antivir stayed quiet. I use windows only for playing anyway, though, so trojans don't bother me that much.

More seeders would be appreciated, by the way."
,SS-Kommando,2008-07-23T15:11Z,"This torrent contains a TROJAN. So do not download it, and be careful when it comes to torrents uploaded by slitex. There are many douchebags out there unfortunately...

,Deppe309,2008-09-06T00:27Z,"i downloaded all without a problem, but, how do i get it to work??? there are a bunch of Winrar files, all of them seem to have the same file, which is useless. There is only a MSInfo Document, which only leads me to system information and doing nothing productive, please tell me what to do"

I wish someone would upload a proper version of CoI, I'm sure I'm not the only one. "
