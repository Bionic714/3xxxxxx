,Twilight99,2007-02-28T21:12Z,Thanks! I've been wanting to see this. And I love the DVD9!
,Ubehage,2007-03-26T01:40Z,"This torrent is slow...

Doesn't matter to me though, I'm just wondering why nobody is complaining. Or is it just a conspiracy against me at TPB ?"
,todu,2007-03-26T14:38Z,"@Ubehage

I'm seeding the ""Matrix Ultimate Collection (10 DVD9)"" torrent at the moment. But I'll come back and seed this torrent too, from time to time. What speed do you get and what is your maximum you have ever gotten from TPB?"
,Ubehage,2007-03-26T16:03Z,"todu>

I have gotten this with 15kb/s, and my maximum on TPB is about 800kb/s.

Though, I don't mind. Things take time - and good things take more time :)"

Now I'm seeding this torrent for a while. It should be faster now."
,mrhenriksen,2008-01-16T23:04Z,what do you use to burn this movie? with I used nero the movie stopped when the second layer started. any oone with the same problem?
,Vaaki,2008-07-01T17:28Z,"This movie is so beautiful. I highly recommend it to anyone who's thinking of seeing it. 
Thank you for this. Really."
,fredfan,2010-01-04T20:54Z,"Haven't watched it through yet, but it seems to play beautifully.  While burning to a DL DVD9 disk with IMGBurn, I got the following message: 

""Optimal L1 Data Zone Start LBA:  None Found! (VTS_02)  This image has not been mastered correctly to burn onto a double layer (OTP Track Path) disc.  None of the cells meet the 'DVD-Video specification' criteria for a potential layer break position.  Do you want to continue anyway?""

I chose to sacrifice a DL disc and will let you know if there is any problem with switching between layers later.  Otherwise, thanks for sharing this great movie, and thanks also for preserving the quality of the original release.  Glad to see it's still a healthy torrent.
