I ripped this movie in full quality (DVD9) and removed copy protection and region protection. You need a double layer DVD if you want to burn it. Else mount it with Daemon Tools and watch on your computer with for example VLC media player:

Plot summary for
Pay It Forward (2000)

Young Trevor McKinney, troubled by his mother's alcoholism and fears of his abusive but absent father, is caught up by an intriguing assignment from his new social studies teacher, Mr. Simonet. The assignment: think of something to change the world and put it into action. Trevor conjures the notion of paying a favor not back, but forward--repaying good deeds not with payback, but with new good deeds done to three new people. Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself, his mother and his physically and emotionally scarred teacher, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him.

Message from the ripper:

This is such a good movie I am shocked nobody shared it as a torrent. Especially considering what the movie is all about. Sharing. So. Don't just download this movie. Share it! Or like they would say in the movie: Pay it forward.

I'll burn a few copies of the movie and have them in my car. Every time I see someone whose car has stopped working, I'll stop, offer to tow their broken car to the next gas station, and when they offer me money in return, I'll just say no and give them a copy of this DVD instead. Let's all do the same (this is just an example) and see if we can start a trend of sharing and unselfishness!

Peace!
