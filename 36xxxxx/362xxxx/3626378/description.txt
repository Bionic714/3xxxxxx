Out of the Blue (1980)

"This is Gorgeous, does anybody out there read me?"

Cebe is facing some problems at home, beyond the usual adolescent troubles with bad skin and boys. Her convict father's a boozer, her mother a junkie. And she's only 15. So how does she grow up - when every adult lets her down?

Brimming with sharp-eyed realism, great performences and uncanny intelligence, this off-beat drama about a girl's coming of age - and coming to grips with her harsh realities of life features a superb performences from Linda Manz, Dennis Hopper and Sharon Farrell.

An often gritty look at the trials and tribulations of being a teenager - with the cool, curveball spin of having the parents more screwed up than the kid - this one-of-a-kind movie will hit you hard, with a message from... Out of the Blue.
