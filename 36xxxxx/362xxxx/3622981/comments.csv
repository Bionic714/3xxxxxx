(XP and win2k platforms only) When you get those annoying ?Yellow question marks? in your device manager, Just pop the Universal Driver CD in and Windows will automatically search the comprehensive drivers base that?s on it. This CD, (Iso format about 600 mb) contains software drivers for over 25,000 hardware components from brands such as Dell, HP, Compaq, IBM, Sony, Toshiba, Panasonic, as well as hardware component manufacturers Intel, 3Com, VIA, nVidia, ATI, SoundMax, and many more."

(*) NOD32 antivirus (Virus Signature Database Version: 2072) which DIDN'T find anything ""suspicious"".

(*) Webroot SpySweeper (168.766 known threats) which DIDN'T recognize some potential threat."

,DR>DOWNLOADER,2007-02-24T11:40Z,"Hi mevsem, what is an ISO file?"
,mevsem,2007-02-25T00:38Z,"An ISO image (.iso) is an informal term for a disk image of an ISO 9660 file system. More loosely, it refers to any optical disc image, even a UDF image.

As is typical for disc images, in addition to the data files that are contained in the ISO image, it also contains all the filesystem metadata, (boot code, structures, and attributes). All of this information is contained in a single file. These properties make it an attractive alternative to physical media for the distribution of software that requires this additional information as it is simple to retrieve over the Internet."
