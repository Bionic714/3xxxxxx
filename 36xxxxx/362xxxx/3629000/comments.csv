,Scudmeister,2007-03-02T13:38Z,"Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit.

In reality you dont die in 10 minutes by Zyklon B not even under the right conditions which the Nazis so called Gaschambers couldn't obtain.

In reality you dont burn up in 20-30 minutes and all that remains are ashes.

It takes 2½ hours for a normal size body and then there is still the bones left that takes another 20 minutes to grind.

Experts doesn't belive in the Holocaust Why should we?"
,Saverok,2007-03-02T17:51Z,"So you mean that most of the experts don´t believe in the holocaust ?

Lol!"
,Pete-J,2007-03-03T03:31Z,"Scudmeister, i dont know where you heard that.
If you have a look at this serie, they say that they where 30 minutes in the gaschamber.

And one guy from the Sonderkommando said that after a few hours in the crematorium you dosen't exsist anymore. They never said that it just took 20-30 minutes."

,Scudmeister,2007-03-03T19:13Z,"3 guys in 2004 stayed in a Gaschamber with Zyklon B for 1 hour and was perfectly FINE afterward.

Experts on Cremating people say that it takes 2½ hours to burn a body and then the Bones are still left which takes another 20 minutes.

Go check your nearest crematorium if you dont belive me and bTW this is SUPER HEATED crematoriums not some ancient crematorums that was used back then."
,Saverok,2007-03-03T22:02Z,"Just face it, Scudmeister is to afraid to watch this as he know it reveals the truth."
,Saverok,2007-03-03T22:05Z,"""3 guys in 2004 stayed in a Gaschamber with Zyklon B for 1 hour and was perfectly FINE afterward. ""

Hahaha! Lol!
Give us the link please, would you ?
Hahaha!"
,wankan,2007-03-05T12:43Z,I think it was this one http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3512722/Judea_Declares_War_on_Germany . Something about the floor being too cold for the gas to vapourise on a cold floor . Something like that .
,wankan,2007-03-05T12:55Z,Though the larger file size version is here . http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3437649/Judea_Declares_War_on_Germany__A_Critical_Look_at_WWII
,tomtomx,2007-03-17T18:54Z,Neonazis really have an incredible low regard for their idols knowledge. So it would have been a totally impossible obstacle for the nazis back then to heat the gaschambers or the Cyclon B crystals? Guess the neonazis of today assume that the nazis back then were just as stupid as the ones today. (Download and watch these films and they'll tell you how it was done.)
,tomtomx,2007-03-17T19:18Z,By the way. Zyclon B ws the brand name for Hydrogen Cyanide. The same gas as is beeing used in executions today...

,starfish294,2008-03-12T18:06Z,"Interesting that the holocaust was only coined in the 1970's. Plus the Polish government admitted in 1995 that there were NO gas chambers at Auschwitz. 

So the title of this film is crap and probably its contents."
,burf,2008-03-18T14:02Z,"Thanks, Pete, for this upload!
Me thinks, a Clockwork Orange situation (ie: forcing the many ignorant people to watch this) may be in order, for people like Scudmeister et al.
And by the way, starfish, just because you weren't *born* yet, some of us were alive in the 60s, and *holocaust* was *coined* long before the 70s.
Really amazing how many people live with their brains closed."

It's incredible how neonazis try to deny historical facts to satisfy their petty hatreds against jews and probably everybody else (except guys like Goebbels who murdered his six children...), there are SS members who testified to the gas chambers and who were disgusted by the executions, described them in all detail (gassing) and refused to do it even at the risk of being shot, one got away with saying he was a catholic and didn't want to risk going to hell, the top SS brass laughed at him and let him off as a weakling... These neonazis revisionists deserve to be despised and spat on for condoning and denying such proven and  disgusting atrocities. "
,Geemonster,2009-03-29T22:59Z,"Aha!  The English version.
Holocaust,call it what you want!  It happened!"
,Geemonster,2009-03-30T17:12Z,Beats me why this things so bloody slow!
