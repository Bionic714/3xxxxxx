------------------------------

It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bit later than usual because I had to wait for another source. The usual 700Mb source (Stargate SG1 S10E17 HR HDTV XviD-hV) had too many corrupted frames and borked audio.

FAQ updated a bit: http://users.pandora.be/sniber/yumi.html .

High resolution, high quality.

It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s important to have the best and latest codecs!
