,Danlars,2007-02-24T10:29Z,Is this one equal to the usual HR-releases??
,Ran4,2007-04-05T00:07Z,"No, of course not, the quality is extremely low, only an idiot would watch this.
It's probably not a real release anyway."
,konvertor,2007-05-19T07:54Z,"Either Ran4 is uninformed, or being sarcastic.

Yes, this is equal to the usual HR release, just much smaller because much better codecs are being used."
,death734,2008-04-05T05:58Z,no way is it equal to the hr but its not to much worse then the 350mb xvid video quality wise
