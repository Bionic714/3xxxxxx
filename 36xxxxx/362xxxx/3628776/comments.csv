Can only concure with MFriendly. =)"
,kenny999,2007-02-28T21:42Z,"Mr_Fear & everybody who meets the problem with ""no playing"" at once; I face the same problem. The disc is not encrypted or whatever suggestion appered here. I think there was somehow screwed up an attempt to ease the copyright warning at the disc beginning. Why I think so: 1. if I play the ""VTS_01_0.VOB"" segment alone it runs too quick; 2. other segments are playable normally. I got to the DVD main menu by pressing ""Menu"" button - then I can operate the DVD normally.
Give it a try, it may work on your systems too.
Mr_Fear, although I appreciate your contribution to ST fans so much, I suggest to fix up season 5 and from season 6 to return to old method you used for seasons 1-4.
Live long and prosper \\//"
,kenny999,2007-02-28T21:57Z,"Heh... ok it's running ""too fast"" on other discs too. Seems like I was too quick making conclusion.
So ok, I have no idea why is it so.
Anyhow, pressing ""Menu"" on your remote can bypass the 'no-playing' issue."

,phoem,2007-03-02T14:14Z,"How to fix the ""PROBLEM"":
1. Get PGCEdit (it's free)
2. Backup your VIDEO_TS folder (for paranoics!)
3. In pgcedit open DVD (File->Open DVD
4. Click Yes To ALL questions and let it do its job (scan VOBs). After that, click Close
5. Double click on ""(JumpSS) Jump to VMGM Title menu"". A new window pops up.
6. Choose from menu ""Jump and Call->From VMGM menu->to VTSM Menu->JumpSS-VTSM""
7. Be sure both Text boxes that appear are set on ""1""
8. Close and when asked, save.
9. Play.
Mine works perfectly after this. If you're not satisfied with the result, you have backups from pgcedit (""PgcEdit_backup"" folder)."
