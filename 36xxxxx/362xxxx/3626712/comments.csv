,ThaiWhip,2007-03-04T18:58Z,"please seed http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3626712/Blue_Oyster_Cult_-_Then_(1976)_and_Now_(1999)
if not, please remove the torrent.."
,ThaiWhip,2007-03-11T22:14Z,"Whats the deal here with this torrent..
Is the plan to seed about 10% then go away for a week, then return to seed another 10% and so on ??"
,merza,2007-03-17T19:56Z,Is this torrent finish at cristmas time ????
,dynasoar,2007-03-28T07:53Z,"The torrent lists both TPB and Demonoid, and it's still going strong at the latter. I have no idea why TPB is disconnected from it. I'll try feeding here directly as though I'm downloading but leave the upload speed wide open. If that doesn't work, I suggest peering it at Demonoid."
,dynasoar,2007-03-28T18:48Z,"I've tried seeding, and TPB still shows nothing. The few who've tried to download haven't gotten very much. I really recommend getting it from Demonoid (I'll send invitations if I can). Over 60 people have completed it, and at this moment there are 4 seeds and 5 peers, while TPB still shows 0 and 0 which I know is wrong. Besides, I've tried it myself here and get stuck at 99.9%. I can't find a reason why -- I created this and the Demonoid torrent at the same time. I also don't understand why people here can't pull from Demonoid, because it's listed as tier 1. If you get it from there, you can just continue it -- it's the same file even though it might have a different torrent name."
,ThaiWhip,2007-03-29T04:41Z,"Seems to have started again for a short while, another 6-7 % so far..  "
,ThaiWhip,2007-04-05T00:48Z,Stuck at 99.9% now.. + this torrent is no longer on the demonoid tracker..
,dynasoar,2007-04-07T12:27Z,"The reseed is on Demonoid. Make sure you get the reseed. You can download this torrent with there. It's the same files.

Lots of people have figured out that when it's stuck at 99.9%, it'd done. It burns fine.

Sadly, no one bothered to repay for the download by seeding. Greedy brats. I'll post at Demonoid from now on. There's  people seeding this there, a month after downloading.
"
,ThaiWhip,2007-04-08T18:11Z,"Yea, well... no1 seeds on demonoid either so.. 
and 99.9% doesnt burn, not with the programs i've tested..  cause .bup and .ifo files are missing.."
,PBayX,2007-12-10T03:44Z,"Yes, unfortunately the file is stuck at 99.9% (thanks @$$hole).  However, you can create the necessary IFO & BUP files with IFOEdit & DVDFab and it will burn and play just fine - except with no chapter menu."
,Zappaweb,2007-12-23T04:20Z,"Fruktansvärd kvalité både på ljud & bild.
Sen funkar inte nedladdningen heller 99,9%, måste göra om den i Nero.
Lovar att lägga ut en bra video om jag får tag på det."
,Baldibiff,2008-01-28T00:22Z,Anyone seed this please?
,cmg,2008-04-12T08:14Z,"I'm stuck at 99.9%. Some one, please seed the rest."
,zazabichi,2008-06-29T15:38Z,"Please Seed !
