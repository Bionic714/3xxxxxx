Due to all the leechers on the pirate bay I reposted it with Demenoid as the top tracker Apologies to people who downloaded on the previous torrent, you can simply save to this one and probably get the last .5%

This is my Dolby Headphone release of Dark Side of the Moon
It will work with any standard set of headphones but it is important that you listen to it through a pair
of headphones, and not through normal speakers, this is just the way Dolby Headphone works (it assumes
that one ear cant hear what the other ear is hearing).
I did this mainly to be able to listen to DSOTM in 5.1 while on the run :)

How I did it was simple, I managed to get a copy of the DTS version of DSOTM and played that through
PowerDVD with Dolby Headphone enabled, then I used Total Recorder to record the output to wav files
and then CDEX to reencode them to MP3's

Please note if you dont own a legit copy of DSOTM, please go out and buy one or else delete this, I do not
condone piracy, I simply want OWNERS of DSOTM to be able to appreciate it that bit more. I bought my copy
for 6.99 in the bargain bin, im sure you can buy yours even cheaper! Worth every penny.
