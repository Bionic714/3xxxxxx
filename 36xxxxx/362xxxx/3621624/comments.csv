,donutface,2007-02-19T09:17Z,"well roger waters himself said you havent experienced DSOTM until youve heard it in surround. As far as the bullshit goes, how about you test the two versions of Money side by side and hear a difference yourself?"
,donutface,2007-02-19T09:37Z,"Oh and for those of you who dont know - Dark Side Of the Moon was originally recorded in 3D Quadrophonic sound, but had to be downmixed to 2 channels due to limited technology at the time - recently a surround sound SACD version came out, and that is what this is based on."
,Mick Jagger,2007-02-20T21:40Z,"This is garbage. It sounds overly compresed, and loses fidelity of the original recording so badly it's unlistenable. A regular mp3 rip even at 128 kbps, is vastly superior to this, and it's a lie to claim that this reproduced a 5.1 mix it does not. It sounds overly compressed, and dampened. It's as if you're standing outside the door of a room, and inside the room someone is playing dark side of the moon. It's awful.
Hope this helps."
