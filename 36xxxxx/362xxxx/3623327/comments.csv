This is the raw ISO from the original release by MicroProse in 1997. Please note that this was originally developed for Windows 95. This torrent includes no patching for use with anything above Windows 95.

You should be able to run it fine in Windows 95 or 98, and you may be able to get it to run under NT based Windows. Here are some tips:

1) Disable DirectDraw Acceleration from dxdiag
2) Set all executables (including the installer) to Windows 95 compatibility mode
3) Or, just set up a tiny little VM with Windows 95/98 installed, and install the game in there. This way should work no matter what.

Other than that, installation is fairly standard: Mount the ISO with Daemon Tools, etc., and either run the installer (setup.exe) from the CD in compatibility mode (for Windows 2000/XP), or let the autorun take care of it (Windows 95/98).

Cheers."
