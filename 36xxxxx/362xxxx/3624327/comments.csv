,gunsmokez,2007-02-23T04:06Z,"The video quality is good 9/10

But, the audio is messed up. There is an echo after the voices. So, you will hear everything twice as if you were listening through a hollow can. 

Might wanna look for another version. "
,nightbreed1931,2007-02-23T15:07Z,from what i've read it depends on what player your using weather the sound is funny or not has german or some thing in front of english audio
,JesusEatsBabies,2007-02-23T23:08Z,"I didn't hear an echo, I didn't watch the whole movie yet but I clicked at a few random spots and watched 10 or 15 seconds and everything seemed fine, and its not a fake, its DVD quality. BTW i used Realplayer"
