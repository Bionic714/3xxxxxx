,pentry1973,2007-02-21T12:39Z,"This somewhat odd and humoristic English band mixed their speed metal with some thrashy elements and with a fair portion of punk. As their labelmates at Neat Records, Venom, they played as a trio and somewhat resembles them too. This is their second album and I will upload their third one later. This is also a vinyl rip.
