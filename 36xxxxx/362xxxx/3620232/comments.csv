,thewinwizard,2007-02-17T15:22Z,How about some seeders please?
[T],zZoooZz,2007-02-17T16:00Z,I can download only to help seed! =)
,Dukessa,2007-02-17T19:30Z,"Im seeding (im the only one atm), but my ISP has gone spako these days....so, hopefully more seeders soon."
,anver0819,2007-02-18T07:49Z,"I've tried these two given keys, but it says in red letters: ""The key is incorrect.  Verify that you have the correct key, and then retype it."""
,Dukessa,2007-02-18T16:15Z,"I installed this Office release on 4 different PCs already. With the same key (first one). 
Worked smoothly.

Did you install my Office release ?
Or you were trying to put those keys in another version you downloaded ?"
,Oliwish,2007-02-21T18:28Z,"Very good torrent... fast dl, all programs works perfectly. Credd to dukessa and seeders!"

,Xlogiclabs,2007-03-07T08:29Z,"Looking for a good realese to do our own beta testing.If its all good ,We Will Super Seed."
,jragates,2007-03-11T00:07Z,i installed this on vista but outlooks keeps giving me a missing MSVCR80.dll  and/or  RTFHTML.dll error i installed and reinstalled also tried 2 other versions but keep getting the same thing.any ideas?? 
,rebeiro4,2007-03-24T20:25Z,How do you burn the BIN file?
,Dukessa,2007-03-25T16:53Z,"jragates:
Those are Microsoft library files. Means they're broken or missing. Its't not Office fault, it's cose your SO is f**ked up. So reinstall it and try again to install...I'm sure it will work then ;)

rebeiro4:
You don't have to burn the files separately. Use Nero, or Alcohol 120%, or a decent burning software and it's gonna do all the work you need."
,caspish,2007-03-30T11:34Z,How do we install it? 
,Dukessa,2007-04-01T12:26Z,"What do you mean ??
The installation screen should appear once you mount the image, or put in the cd that you burnt. If it doesnt, run the setup manually.
Im not giving assistance for such questions anymore. 
This release works perfectly with the keys I provided, if you cant burn an image then look for a tutorial, if you have missing files repair them on your own, cose it has nothing to do with this release of Office."
,danga294,2007-04-14T17:39Z,"Dukessa, can you please seed?"
,danga294,2007-04-14T18:25Z,"Hey, I need to learn Unix/Linux for a job I plan to apply for. If anyone can help guide me to a site or place I can learn this, please let me know. Message me if anything!

--Thanks"

,kd1,2007-06-28T13:32Z,"Sorry to trouble you on installation again, I can see it's pissing you off.
I'm a newby. Downloaded .bin and .cue on mac. burn't to CD. transferred to windows pc. doesn't run from CD. made image file in Alcohol 120%. no joy running from that. tried extracting with ISObuster and it just copies the .BIN file. I'm obviously missing something here. Should the .bin and .cue files just work from a CD by double clicking on the .bin? or autorun? When I double click the .bin file Stuffit tries to open it and has error."
,badkarma5833,2007-10-23T05:33Z,"when i try opening it with the torrent i get this error message: Unable to load ""wink-o2k7e.bin"":Not enough storage available to process this command.

any ides what i do"
,alec456,2007-11-27T16:39Z,Worked fine! Used the first cd-key and everything went smoothly
,kg43123,2008-01-19T20:52Z,"Ok well I dont know how you guys arent getting it to work

this is what i did and it worked fine
download torrent using bitorrent
than
when it is done downloading
you have to download daemon tools..thats all i knwo how to use..its simple
than with daemon tools locate the .cue file and mount image after that 
it well should autostart "
,andrewh817,2008-02-17T22:33Z,Seed please!! need powerpoint for a school project! thanks
,andrewh817,2008-02-18T06:01Z,"By the way, all you have to do is use MagicIso and convert it to an ISO file and then open it with WinRar and it works just fine."
,2.Kernen,2008-04-23T11:04Z,"Nice upload. Thx a lot.

I dont get how people STILL can't figure out how to install a goddamn piece of software from an image file.. 

WTF is up with all the Nero, MagicISO, Imageburn, and so on ?! 

###MOUNT THE THING WITH DAEMON-TOOLS###
( http://daemon-tools.cc )
Then just follow the ****ing onscreen installation.

It's easier than formatting a floppydisk ffs. And that's pretty goddamn easy.

Many thanks to Dukessa for the first working office 2007 torrent I found so far."
,Fredrics01,2008-06-13T12:23Z,"thanks first cd key worked fine. 

Remeber to mount with daemon tools, it is the easiest way"
