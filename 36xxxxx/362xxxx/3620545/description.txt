"You are a private in a special military defensive force, and your job is to protect your underwater civilization from invaders and hostile wildlife. If you are successful in your missions, your people will be able to build a giant mother ship and fly to safety, escaping the dangers of the deep. You?ll have to pilot one of eight submarines through missions that range from straightforward battles to more complex search-and-deliver objectives. As you work your way through the missions, a wide array of gadgets, including a grappling hook, are available for you to use. Because you are underwater, you can move freely in any direction, so when you encounter hostile units you can try to outmaneuver them or blast them with a variety of weapons and special attacks. Hopefully, you will give your civilization enough time to escape the planet in DEEP FIGHTER."

It's a great game, and only a few have played it - it's a shame. It's like wasting good cookies :(
