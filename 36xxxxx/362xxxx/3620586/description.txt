Moi! Torrentti on Os/2 Warp 4.0. :)

Hello! Torrent is Os/2 Warp 4.0. :)

Have you ever wondered who wrote the Windows95 UI? Or have you ever thought about why Microsoft came up with so brilliant UI? Well, infact, they didn't. IBM developed nextgen user interface for their newest operating system developed together with Microsoft. Windows NT is in fact Os/2 Warp with some additional features and fixes.

We should question about these "additions" but since Windows Vista was released I want you people know what is the real OS behind NT, it's not buggy, it's not unsecure in terms of WindowsNT and it's newest generation Windows NT 6.0 aka Windows Vista.

It's lighting fast and extremely resposible, only problem is to make it run on your computer, althought changes are great it's not gurantee.

Why to test OS/2? Well OS/2 is still used in ATM-machines, Nuclear PowerPlants and that sort of places. It's _iron_ solid and _rock_ stable.

Have fun testing it.

In case your computer is "too new" (there is 90% it is), then most easiest way to get this thing running is to use ironicly Microsoft VirtualPC.
Unless you make it bootable you need to make out boot discs. There are lots of HowTos if you just turn your browser towards google.com
