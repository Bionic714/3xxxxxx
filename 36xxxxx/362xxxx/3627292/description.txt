SYNOPSIS: Homicide detective Tom Hardy, a fifth generation Pittsburgh cop, is paying dearly for testifying against his partner (and cousin) Jimmy Detillo in a police brutality case. Since spilling the beans, life has been hell for Hardy, and it gets worse when a serial killer murders his chief of homicide father. To top it all off, he's practically kicked off the force for insisting his father's murderer is a cop.
Two years later, Hardy's been demoted to the river rescue squad, and all this trauma has almost driven him to an alcoholic state. The black-sheep of the fraternal force, Hardy receives little encouragement from his team-playing uncle Nick Detillo, who has been promoted to chief since his brother's death. But as the killer's body count gets higher, Tom gets closer and closer to the truth.
