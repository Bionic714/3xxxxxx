,Bobinette,2007-02-22T05:03Z,"Strange, supposed to be hundreds of seeders, but getting 0 kb/s, while Jericho posted later downloads at 60 kb/s...  I usually get 200-300 kb/s on shows with same seeding...

Seems to have been posted 2 hours earlier then usual...  Anyone actually has this thing?

The other RARed version seems to download ok, but not very fast at 25 kb/s."
,Shirty123,2007-02-22T05:23Z,"be patient

,blue_tomato,2007-02-23T17:44Z,"Used to love the first season, but ever since its been going down. This episode is the last nail in the coffin. Disappointing, non conclusive and leaves everything to your imagination - because the writers were too lazy to come up with a sensible explanation themselves."

,Ju-ju,2007-02-27T23:29Z,"Hi
Sorry, have a few questions for those who are better at computers than I am
Im trying to download films and tv series, it take ages and most of the time I only get the sound and no picture! What am I doing wrong? Once it worked though. Second question; maybe a bit stupid but... how do I ""seed""? I dont want to leech but Im not sure where in my computer I have to put things for others to find em... Thanx a lot!"
,eKi100,2007-02-28T01:25Z,"LoL, nice to see this for change, more seeders than leechers :)

Seeders only 4782 & leechers half of that :) 
Nice"
,eKi100,2007-02-28T01:31Z,"Ju-ju:

If u get only sound & no picture, u need to install more codecs, divx etc codecs, i recommend this package, includes all:
http://www.free-codecs.com/Codec_Pack_All_in_1_download.htm

And that seeding question, u can make ur own torrents of ur files(with torrentmaker) if u like and seed those, but also, when u download those movies & tv series, u can seed those, while u download & after that.. Just make sure, u dont remove that whatever downloading, until share rate is at least 2.0, wich means u have seeded it fully to 2 other persons.. More u seed, bigger share rate = more peoples have got it cos u seeded.
In ur bit torrent client, u can set up upload rate, depending on ur connection speed."
