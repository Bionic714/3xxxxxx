,Dusty8485,2007-10-17T01:57Z,"First and foremost you must have a modchip installed in your Wii before you can play any downloaded or copied game.  Search google for more information about Nintendo Wii ModChips, which one you will need for your current hardware revision, and where to buy, etc. after that... Just Burn the image to a blank DVD using your favorite burning software.  Voila!

BTW... thanks for the uppy!  been looking for the US version of this!  Keep up the seeding folks!  I'll return the favor :P"
