,dark_gable_64,2007-03-14T22:17Z,"Copy this DVD file  to a hard drive folder and use DVD Fab Plantinum to read the DVD folder  and then split the DVD into 2 discs. + or - R disc, it does not matter.

This, or upgrade your system to a dual-layer support.

,dodsy2008,2008-09-02T00:58Z,Use DVDshrink to fit it all onto 1DVD. Quality mightn't be as good though. Cheers for the upload BTW...atuc.
,neutral2009,2009-12-21T21:49Z,"This is the best ever download from TPB for me a real dvdrip. Use dvd shrink/decrypter to open the file and burn the dvd keeping the original mastering and the quality is as normal as any dvd disc.  Use normal single layer dvd disc you will not loose quality plus if you burn it properly, and keep the origanl authoring,  you can enjoy the interactive menu where you can create your own video playlist and. Very cool. 10/10 for this. Thanks a lot."
