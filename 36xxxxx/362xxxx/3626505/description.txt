This is the Insanity DVD from Yoga Book Hyper.  This is not the book itself, only the DVD, which contains complete X-mania coverage, SSF2X and HSF2 casual play, glitches, combos and some SF2: World Warrior spotlight.  Awesome content for Street Fighter fans, but of course, I recommend you still buy the book (get it at www.play-asia.com, which now comes with either a different DVD or a second DVD in addition to this one).
  
This is encoded as a MPEG-2 program stream, containing H.264 video and MP3 audio.  This said, you need a current mid-end PC (at the least) and a media player that supports decoding H.264.  If you do not have both of these, do not waste your time with this content, and do not complain to me due to your lack of a good system or computing knowledge.

Enjoy, and please seed.
