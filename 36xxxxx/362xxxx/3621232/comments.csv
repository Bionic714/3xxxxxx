,Ianpb,2008-11-02T12:45Z,"Unfortunately, some of the subtitles have not been formatted correctly and disappear at the edges."
,Ianpb,2008-11-02T22:34Z,"This is a bad job. The picture has been made smaller too, thereby losing ability to have full-screen picture plus subs. The text is unnecessarily bold. If you must hard code subtitles, you should check they are formatted correctly. It is also better to place text on bottom of picture with darkened background. Otherwise do as others usually do and just provide a link to subtitles file."

Ha magyarul akarod megnézni, érdemes olyan verziót választanod, nem ezt, amelynél a feliratok nincsenek beleégetve a filmbe. Csak keress itt rá a kalózöbölben a címre, és HU feliratokat a podnapisi(pont)neten talász: 1285767"
