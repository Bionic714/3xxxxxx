With our own Afghan conflict stretching on interminably with no appreciable gains made, seemingly daily reports of new clashes with Taliban forces that just refuse to fade away, and no end in sight, big budget Russian blockbuster 9th Company is a remarkably timely piece of film. The biggest budget Russian film ever made at the time of its release ? that title has since been claimed by a pair of other films currently in production ? tells the powerful true story of a platoon of Russian soldiers simply forgotten and left to die at the tail end of Russia?s campaign against Osama Bin Laden-led fighters in Afghanistan. With an approach highly sympathetic to the Russian youth caught up in a fight by forces they never had any hope of understanding and highly critical of the incredible ? and incredibly pointless ? waste of life the film is thematically strongly reminiscent of Oliver Stone?s Platoon while it is shot with such high gloss and incredible production standards that it could easily be a lost Michael Bay picture.
