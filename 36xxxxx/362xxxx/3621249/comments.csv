,wargen62,2007-02-18T19:47Z,PLEASE SEED...Thanks.
,FlexnÃ¤s,2007-02-19T18:20Z,"Everything is ok. I´m seeding 24/7, but my connection is a bit slow so please be patient."
,speedcop,2007-02-19T18:30Z,"Flexnäs, please enable super-seeding in your bittorrent client. It really helps, especially when you have a slow upload!

With super-seeding your client only uploads each block once, instead of 50 clients all getting the same block of data multiple times from your slow upload, making the whole swarm suffer.."
,FlexnÃ¤s,2007-02-20T16:56Z,"Speedcop, the client i use dont have that option as far as i know. The reason its slow is i only have 50kb/s up and seeding 5 torrents, each 4,35 GB. So please be patient is all i can say."
,speedcop,2007-02-27T16:52Z,"Yes, we are trying to be patient, but it is just a bit frustrating to see such innefficient behaviour.

I would strongly recommend switching to a bittorrent-client that supports super-seeding, because after 8.5 days of seeding we only have 40%. That makes an average of 6 kbytes/s (I guess you meant so say you have 50 kbytes/s upload and not 50 kbit/s which seems to be the effective speed).

Just check your upload stats for your torrent. We have got 1.75 GB of data, and if you have uploaded more than that, then it has been wasted due to inefficient seeding.

But you have to do make do with what you've got. I really appreciate you uploading this movie ! A couple weeks more and we all can enjoy it.. :)"
