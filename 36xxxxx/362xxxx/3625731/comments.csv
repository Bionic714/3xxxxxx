,archmage23,2007-07-14T01:40Z,"yes.. why the hell do you guys rip & upload 1.6 GB movies but you can't remember to rip that little .idx file with the subtitles. 
i wan't to know what the greeks are saying!
PLEASE RIP THE SUBS !
Goodguy, be a good guy and rip the subs off the DVD?"
,archmage23,2007-07-28T20:05Z,"anybody? subtitles ? 
rar+idx ?
off the dvd ?
please?"
,archmage23,2007-07-30T06:30Z,is it so much trouble???
,goodguy,2007-08-07T09:36Z,"archmage23:

I don't have the DVD. I found this rip elsewhere and figured that I'd make it available to more people by posting it here (and the 1100+ downloads speak for itself). I've been searching for subs for years but havent found any, so don't be such a winer. If you're englis speaking - make your own subs and post them here and you'll see that it will be translated into more languages."
,archmage23,2007-08-07T13:40Z,"But i have no problem with english!!
This movie is full of greek dialogues!

Like i said - i can't understand what the greeks are saying. so i can't make subtitles because i don't understand greek! 

Anyway, would i be asking for subtitles if i had time to make them??? 

Sorry i bothered you... but the message is really out to anyone who has the DVD - it's gotta have the subs and they are easy to rip.. the file is small and can be posted anywhere
Anyone? Please?"
,pryll,2007-09-17T21:31Z,"canÂ´t help you with the idx, I used subrip for the first time tonight, so I hope you will be ok with the srt-files. I have uploaded the enlish ones on opensubtitles.org, they are synched to work with this release.
