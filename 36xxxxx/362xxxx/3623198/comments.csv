Original Air Date: 2 November 2006

Derrick's sister comes to Seattle for a visit, and seems more into the extended family and gossip surrounding his divorce from Addison than into him. Meanwhile, the interns are not the only ones jealous of Cristina's opportunity to scrub in with Preston on a ""Humpty Dumpty"" procedure, and Bailey takes it personal when she learns she's been scrubbed, herself. George works with Addison on a very unusual case and Alex envies him.
