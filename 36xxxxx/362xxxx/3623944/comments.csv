,dilbertgeg,2009-04-05T06:49Z,"AMAZING.  People bought SUVs bcz that's what they were sold.  GMs ads amounted to anti-advertising for EVs, GM sold potential customers on limitations, but still could not force down consumer demand.

People were LINED UP WITH BACKORDERS for EVs. People who leased them were FORCED to return them to be destroyed.  They offered GM $1.9M to buy out leases for more cars than GM had left, but GM preferred to destroy them rather than satisfy customers.

Consumers even got arrested trying to protest destruction of these cars.

So much for ""The Free Market"".  In addition, USGov under Bush offered a $4000 subsidy for EVs, but offered a $100,000 subsidy for Hummers and big SUVs.

The sheer amount of financial and political pressure in to STOP sales of these cars is astonishing."
