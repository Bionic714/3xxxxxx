you need a torrent client, like utorrent or bitorrent
i reccomend uttorent"
,swampmatt,2010-12-09T19:51Z,"@john_john_john - I always thought the point of English subs on an alredy English movie was to allow the *automated* translation to any language. If you don't need it, ignore it. It's a small file (relatively) and not like it wastes any serious amount of bandwidth."
