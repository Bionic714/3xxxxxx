,tommiex,2007-02-26T23:19Z,i am new to this but a fast learner. i seem to not get how to dl the KeyGen.exe file.. can someone help me?
,whyfour,2007-02-28T01:11Z,"Hi Im fairly new myself-you need shareza or bit torrent or similar to organise your torrent -you then click on ""download this torrent"" open it and shareza (the one i use) really sorts it out itsself . It gets saved somewhere (you can set this) and you then open it and it should give you a key. the prob i have is ive dl the 30 day trial-how do I register it now before the 30 days are up"
