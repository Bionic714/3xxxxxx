,Marcus1917,2008-09-11T16:33Z,Is this in the original Japanese or is it translated?
,shankytown,2009-01-19T02:51Z,"It's translated into English (with right-to-left reading orientation).

For easier reading, you may want to archive the chapters or volumes, then rename the extension to .cbz (provided that you have CDisplay installed).

Thanks for the upload, meat4u2!"
,yodalr,2009-07-08T16:55Z,"This torrent is shit.

1. It's impossible to read it, cause the .jpg/.png arrangement is a mess. Everything is in one folder, and u can arrange them by name or date or which ever way... it's still a mess.
2. Some of the pages are missing, wtf?  Like where's GANTZ_v03c23p007 ?

DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!"
,chocolatebear,2009-08-10T07:10Z,"Thanks for the upload, everything seems to be in order :D"
,Peterus,2010-01-05T17:53Z,If u want to upload graphic novel - pack up orderly numbered pages from each chapter into single .zip files and rename zip to .cdr (opened with free CDisplay program for browsing comics).
