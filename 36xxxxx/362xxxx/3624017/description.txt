Story:

When a drunkard falls onto the subway tracks, no one is willing to help him except a high schooler name Katou. With the help of Kei, who was a childhood friend, they save the old man but get crushed by the train in the process. Mysteriously, they find themselves still alive, but transported to a room in Tokyo along with a few other people who also recently died. Just when things start settling down, the reader\\\'s attention is drawn to a large black ball in the middle of the room. Words appear on it, telling the room\\\'s occupants that ?a new morning has come.? From then on out, a tale of conspiracies and extraterrestrial criminals unfolds, adding action to the already eclectic mix.
