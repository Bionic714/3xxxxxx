Peter Kayis without doubt the fastest rising star of British Comedy and the funniest man to come out of Bolton. He is on a roll! Creator and star of Channel 4?s critically acclaimed ?That Peter Kay Thing,? he is the new face of the hilarious John Smiths Bitter TV ads. His unique brand of humour is based on the acutely observed and painfully funny things from everyday life.

Mum Wants A Bungalow!

Peter Kay?s ?Mum Wants A Bungalow Tour? was a phenomenal success, sweeping across the country and seen by over 300,000 people. The 180 night record-breaking run in arenas and theatres lasted an epic 9 months and left people desperate for more.

Recorded in front of Peter?s hometown crowd (including his Mum and Nan,) Live At The Bolton Albert Hall is guaranteed to be the funniest stand-up night you?ll ever experience.
