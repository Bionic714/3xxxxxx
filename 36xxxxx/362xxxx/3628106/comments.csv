winrar can repair part01, but the other 3 must be missing necessary information contained at the beginning of the file. if anyone knows a way to fix them, maybe by copying a section from the other rar files (i could do this with a hex editor pretty easily), let me know and i'll repair the files so they can be seeded.

if anyone has the full download, please seed. i only need 384kB, so you wouldn't even need to do it very long."
