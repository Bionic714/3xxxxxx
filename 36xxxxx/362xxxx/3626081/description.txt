Plot summary: Set in contemporary London, DEAD CREATURES follows a group of seemingly-normal young women who have all contracted a terrible, degenerative illness that forces them to murder and feed on human flesh. Adjusting to this inhuman way of existence, the girls read fashion magazines, talk about shagging boys, and try to eke some joy out of "living" in the time left to them. Their only concerns are where to find human flesh and how to avoid a zombie hunter. However, things change for everyone when a newly infected girl turns up...
