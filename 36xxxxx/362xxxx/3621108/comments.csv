,mechka,2007-02-19T01:35Z,this is a VIRUS...
,stalebeer,2007-02-19T04:01Z,"No virus. 
Works great.. Thanks for the upload."
,zabeel,2007-02-20T12:00Z,"No virus people... Everything works like a charm, no messing around with keygen... Thanks alot... DOWNLOAD THIS!!!"
,The_Pilot,2007-02-26T09:14Z,"AntiVir found a virus in keygen...

Virus or unwanted program 'TR/PSW.Zapchast.D.23'
detected in file 'C:\Downloads\ZoneAlarm Pro 7.0.722 + keygen\keygen.exe' [TR/PSW.Zapchast.D.23]."
,Ssithl,2007-04-08T12:17Z,"DO NOT RUN OR DOWNLOAD THE KEYGEN.EXE FILE

As has been stated above, this file is virus loaded, and is completely unneccessary for the program to install. "
,Ssithl,2007-04-08T13:32Z,"You will however need to locate a serial to run the product after it's trial - give google a shot, worked fine for me :)"
,rotisman,2007-04-10T17:08Z,"No problems or viruses, excellent"
,SoundWall,2007-04-23T19:39Z,"AVG says: NO VIRUS FOUND.

I haven't installed this yet, but from what I can tell this seems to be clean."
,HooglyBoogly,2007-05-11T01:56Z,"I don't know how many times I have to say this: The keygen is NOT a Virus and/or Trojan you stupid ass pieces of shit. How about you go scan every single other keygen on here. They all show up as a Virus or Trojan because of how they are made. Now, stfu you stupid ass noobs who think keygens contain viruses."
,reptaboy,2007-05-12T20:42Z,Yes people that Say that this has viruses is wrong because i scanned it with the best virus program CA ANTI VIRUS and it said it was clean as could be but the bad thing is finding the stupid code you could of put on in 
,ManUnited4Ever,2007-06-25T22:11Z,It's not working. It won't accept the serials.
,ManUnited4Ever,2007-06-25T22:12Z,"Or more precisely, the Security Suite keygen."
,redtheghost,2007-09-09T01:10Z,Does this work for Vista?
,Hugoku,2008-02-19T19:25Z,"Don't gimme that ""keygens are innately detected as trojans"" bullshit. I've had a few keygens and none of them had to access stuff it didn't need to (Vista has that part right) or show up as a trojan or virus anywhere."
,milerx,2008-03-10T21:58Z,"no viruses, AVG Trusted.

No hay virus, AVG confirmado"
,venkysuniverse,2008-06-07T15:05Z,Thanks
