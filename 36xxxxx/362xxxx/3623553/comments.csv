,speakeasy,2007-02-23T00:53Z,"Thanks for this.
And, of course, DVDs *don't* all need to be 4Gb in size.
Now waiting for deathmule's latest episode of Lost."
,death734,2007-02-23T06:23Z,"good quality, but is it just me or is the aspect ratio really off? looks like 2.05:1 when it should be 1.77:1 (16:9)

""And, of course, DVDs *don't* all need to be 4Gb in size.""
yeah that be a little to much considering the 720p mpeg-2 TS are around 3-4gb"
,speakeasy,2007-02-23T10:51Z,"Aspect ratio is fine.  I'm in the UK, so on my DVD player I set the format to NTSC.  I have a widescreen TV and so I also set the AR to 4:3.
Everything then looks fine :-)
I will confess to not having a really good understanding of AR issues :-/"

,robswfcuk,2007-02-27T22:16Z,"Im from uk, and was wondering where episode 18 is? im a mad fan of the series and all i can find on the net is up to episode 17. Im guessing it hasn't aired in the US yet. If anyone can shed any light on this, then thankyou very much."
