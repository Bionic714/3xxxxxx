Episode 217 "Bad Blood" 
Airdate: 02/19/2007

Sara walks to the back of the cigar club and unlocks the door to the humidors. She looks over a wall of private lockers but before she can find her father?s, the manager calls to her, ?Ms. Tancredi, I need to have a word with you.?

Michael sits at the bar, looking over a pamphlet about the club. Something in the information makes him pause. He looks outside and sees a local squad car drive by.

Sara moves towards the manager but then moves quickly to the front door.

Michael makes his move to exit also. He pretends to reach for a few mixed nuts, but instead steals a man?s cell phone.

Sara and Michael collide in a hallway. Michael whispers, ?It?s time to go.? The two hurry into the kitchen, and then exit out an emergency door. They land in the alley where a squad car turns on its lights and speeds after them.

Inside an airport terminal in Minneapolis, Mahone talks to his son on the phone. Cameron is still in Montana, recovering from the hit and run that Agent Kim arranged to force Mahone back on the job. Mahone tells his son that he should have been there with him, looking after him. Mahone?s other line beeps and Agent Lang confirms reports that C-Note was at the diner. Mahone grabs a teddy bear with ?Get Well? written on the stomach from a kiosk. Lang is sending C-Note?s mugshot to the hospitals in Southeastern Minnesota after they learn about Dede?s condition.

Micheal and Sara find the car and tell Lincoln and Kellerman they didn?t get what was in the humidor. Michael says that they must get back in the club because once the Company finds out where they?ve been, they?ll clean the place out. Michael wants to take the car because he knows of someone who can help them. He hands the cigar club pamphlet to Lincoln. Lincoln reads over the charter of members and mutters, ?Pope??

There?s a knock at the door and Henry Pope bellows ?Just a minute!? from inside the house. He answers the door with a smile and sees Sara standing on his doorstep. Sara tells Henry there?s something he needs to hear, but she needs to make sure he?s open to it. Henry wants nothing to do with her and Sara pleads, ?Please. Just five minutes. After that, if you want us to leave, we?ll leave. Henry asks, ?Who?s us??? Michael slides into Pope?s view, his jaw drops.

In Henry?s living room, Pope lectures Michael about how his actions have affected his life, ?What the hell you thinking about, waltzing in here, you?re a wanted criminal!? Michael defends that his brother is innocent and tells Pope that the proof is in a locked humidor at the cigar club. Henry orders them out and Sara begs him to listen. She shows him the key and Henry pauses. Maybe they?re telling the truth.

The Hollander station wagon rolls into Conecuh County, Alabama. The kids sit silent in the back seat and T-Bag presses on. Susan tells T-Bag that the family needs to eat. T-Bag swings the car down a drive way and stops in front of a worn down home. T-Bag curses the people who have covered the walls with graffiti and broken the home?s windows. Susan whispers, ?What is this.? T-Bag pauses, and then with a hint of sadness tells them, ?My home.?
