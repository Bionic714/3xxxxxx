http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3623843/FINAL_FANTASY_12_PAL.ISO"
,Gringorilla,2007-02-27T00:42Z,"Oh, so you're back seeding now? I tried to DL your ISO for almost a week without you seeding.

Anyway, this file is PAL.

Excellent game btw. Been playing for 13 hours now, so I know this file is working. No lagging in the videos, no slow loading times, or nothing."
,FFXII,2007-03-07T18:31Z,Whenever I look at a burned disc (or emulate it in Tools like Deamon tools) it's almost empty (only about 4 MB of files) and any emulators refuses to work with it. Anyone who know what I've done wrong?

I've tired burning this with alcohol, nero and dvd decrypter at 4x but sadly it won't run on my chipped ps2.

It gets to the memory card load screen and from there it chokes out while trying to play the opening vid."
