Here's finally an english version of FF12.

Now, all you people who have struggled to get hold of this, remember how bad it was and show consideration enough to seed so that others can get it.

I will be seeding until there are 5 or 6 other seeders.

But seriously...do NOT Hit&Run this torrent!!!


Btw, I'm not entirely sure if it's PAL, but it worked on my PAL machine.
I burned it with Nero and a DVD-R disc and it worked perfectly.

Oh and...SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING!
