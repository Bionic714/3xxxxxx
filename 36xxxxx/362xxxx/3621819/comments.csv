,the_curious,2007-03-05T19:15Z,"I have about 50 percent of this, and no one has seeded for a few days.

PLEASE keep seeding. If you give me 100%, I promise to keep seeding this great torrent, at least 20 hours a week, for at least two months."
,the_curious,2007-03-21T08:44Z,"I almost lost hope, but I finally got 100% of this superb torrent. I will seed mostly in the nights GMT. When I seed, I will most likely be online for many hours, so don't shut down your computer. I will try not to be off-line for more than 48 hours in a row, in the next two months. Have patience and don't forget to seed."
