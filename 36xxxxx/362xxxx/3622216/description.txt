The skeleton of 250,000 years of antiquity of "homo heidelbergensis" hominid with a brain of the same size discovered us to the first one that ours. The discovery of lances, test of the existence of an organized system of hunting, and of the division of the work, suggested it human intelligence had evolved of spectacular form and that the hominids ones were able to communicate among them of effective form. The first indications of ornamentation, destined to increase the sexual attraction, indicate the sprouting of the first biparentales families and, who knows, perhaps also of the love.


The 6 first documentary ones are of the BBC and respond to numerous questions on our evolution: Who were our ancestors? When they walked for the first time on the Earth? What other homønidos coexisted with them? Why survived our ancestors whereas other homønidos were extinguished?
 Reconstructing the crucial moments of our evolution, 'APE MAN' our trip of 5 million years vividly answers these questions when recreating from the origins of our species to the appearance of the man. This extraordinary history has been reconstructed by the scientists from numerous findings of fossils, prehistoric paintings, stone tools and rest of old genetic material. Step by step, the surprising drama of our history is kept awake. We will be witnesses of the old pain and fear of the man before the brutality of the life, and its love and joy before its beauty.
 The 4 documentary rest are of History Channel and present/display the incredible history of the human evolution through the last progresses, interviews with scientists and anthropologists, and amazing simulations by computer. The series is presented/displayed by Walter Cronkite and rolled in Africa.
