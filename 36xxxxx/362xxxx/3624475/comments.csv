,nytemare909,2007-03-07T19:02Z,"Hey guys, just to remind you.. Some of the presets, like the ""Matrix-View"", is a gradingpreset.. so if you want to use it, simply doubleclick ""grade objects"", and then right-click on the pink bar that just appeared in your timeline, and choose ""Apply Preset""... voila!... works for me.. found it out when trying to find a way to create that ""matrix"" effect... SOMEONE PLEASE UPLOAD THE FORCE LIGHTNING AND SUPERMAN HEAT VISION PRESETS!!!!

,pineconeman79,2009-12-11T23:35Z,"director player error thing means that you still have some files to extract. look around for ""49 presets and 51 presets and extract both of them. It should work after that, thats how I did it. P.S. this works great!!! Thanks"
,hyteck,2009-12-16T10:37Z,"HERE'S THE FIX

""Director player error"" will go away if you disconnect from the internet when starting the program, once the program is running you can reconnect to the internet.

It took me a bit to find this out but it works."
,hyteck,2009-12-16T10:41Z,"Also, make sure you have the latest versions of Quicktime and DirectX."
,iRaccoon,2010-03-22T19:15Z,"HERE'S WHAT I DID AND IT WORKS.

Once downloaded and installed I extracted the preset effects and added them to the folder C:\Program Files\FXhome VisionLab Studio\presets.

When you load FxHome it will ask you to locate the file ""VisionLabStudioWindows.programKey"", this is located within this torrent. Then it will install the preset effects then ask if you want to update to a later version, when you download and install the newer version you will no longer get the director errors.

Hope this helps."
,BBBIIHeaven,2010-03-30T22:16Z,PLS  someone  I need PHOTOKEY yazka  do you have it ?
