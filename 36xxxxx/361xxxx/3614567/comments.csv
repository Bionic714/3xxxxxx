,klabautermann,2007-02-10T00:42Z,Thanks for the upload! Im downloading it right now. Unfortunately the speed turned from 500kb/s to 5kb/s when it turned 85%. Ill tell you whether it works for me as soon as Ive got it. 
,klabautermann,2007-02-10T02:03Z,It works just great! Thanks for the upload again.
,Blackwing Dragon,2007-02-10T13:01Z,I f*ckin love you! XD.
,Blackwing Dragon,2007-02-10T14:28Z,"Problem. I got it, overwrote the file with the crack , and all I get is a black TellTale Games window in the middle of my screen that doesn't do jack sh|t. Explanation?...bad? I hope not."
,Blackwing Dragon,2007-02-10T14:52Z,"And who the hell asked you to come in and advertise?GTFO before you lose your PC, freak, I don't need idiots around when I'm pissed >-"
,Almaxaquattl,2007-02-10T14:58Z,Love! :)
,freelancerx,2007-02-10T23:04Z,"awesome! it works :) finished it this morning, can't wait for episode 4"
,Blackwing Dragon,2007-02-11T01:32Z,"Lovely, now to figure out why mine still won't work -_-. At first it tried to get me to enter a code, I forgot to crack the exe file. Exited, cracked it, and now, all that happens is I get a damn black box in the middle of my screen DOING NOTHING."
,Adamskilou,2007-02-11T03:48Z,"Hi Blackwing err, Mr/Mrs/Miss Dragon! 
Have you tried getting the latest graphics drivers for your card ?  and checking theres no conflict with the soundcard? Check out the official help/trouble shooting pages here -----> http://www.telltalegames.com/forums/archive/index.php/f-25.html"
,Blackwing Dragon,2007-02-11T15:25Z,"...how on bloody earth would my sound card cause a visual conflict with something that doesn't even run?
...-_-.
I doubt my drivers have anything to do with it either. I finished Episode 2 3 days before I got this one and nothing happened in-between."
,k-t-m,2007-02-11T23:03Z,"same problem here, black screen after the telltale logo. and my drivers aren't to blame, ep 2 ran perfectly fine a couple of days ago."
,Blackwing Dragon,2007-02-13T05:25Z,"I figured it out. I deleted this torrent and got a ""similar"" one that might have infact been the same. Anyway, I spotted 2 executable files. The one on my desktop linked to another exe file, odd enough, to maybe a ""launcher"".
After I set a link to the CRACKED file on my desktop, it worked.
Sad to see this game tho. Short, far shorter than the other two.Plus episode 1's memory leak is back."
,zooka,2007-02-13T16:50Z,"Wow go speed ! :P fan va gรถtt med en ny episod, tackar"
,werxie,2007-02-15T16:42Z,"Who cracked this? They ought to make a crack that will run under windows 2000. Doesnt run ""procedure entry point AddVectoredExceptionHandler not found"". This wasn't introduced till windows xp, however the trial runs under 2000 so it's whoever cracked it's fault :)"
,Ratmanslim,2007-02-21T22:01Z,"Windows 2000?!
   You could just ask for a crack to Windows 98! This is a new game, perhaps it's meant for the 4 year old windows XP? 2000.... please..."
,Bumpfel,2007-03-18T13:22Z,"Isn't the newest game out yet, i.e. no.4: Abe Lincoln must die?"
,Adamskilou,2007-03-19T18:09Z,"No crack for Win 2000 as far as I know. Been looking for ep4 for a while but no luck so far, it just doesn't seem available. if anyones got it please either post a link to it in a comment here or up the torrent on this site. Thanks!"
,jasperdg,2007-04-29T12:05Z,I found a site witch include Sam and Max 4 Abe Lincoln must die but you'll have to be member(and to be member you have to pay). anyway here it is:  http://www.ddlsite.com/abe+lincoln+must+die/crack-serial-keygen-torrent/free-warez-full-download-1.html
