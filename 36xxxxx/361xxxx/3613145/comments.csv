[T],Knaster,2007-02-08T17:03Z,"Well  Persian and Arabic is the same, they are both sand nigger language"
,hoskeblaffa,2007-02-10T03:21Z,Arabs living in advanced cities and making machines? They sure have degenerated a lot during the last centuries LOL. 
,rlzoom,2007-02-10T03:55Z,"Well, empires rise and fall. The arabs/persians/muslims had their turn, and they fell. Now the cycle continues.... Don't know history? That's your problem, but here's a little nugget for you to chew on; the term Algorithm is derived from the name of an Islamic scientist, Al-Kawarizmi."
,Fryy,2007-02-11T11:12Z,"Knaster, since you are a language expert you should know that these languages are completetly different. Ok, here it goes:
You use one to ask your mama to spread her buttcheaks and the other one to open her mouth so you can come on her face.

How is that being a sand nigger now? "

,Fryy,2007-02-14T20:09Z,hahahahaha whatever you say jimz81 :)

I wasnt referring to their empires. Its extremely rare to find an arab or persian gifted with the understanding of technology. All their shit is imported and they just work the levers. Look at the iranians, they bought the blueprints and machines for making a 70's british car, which they are immensely proud of. Saddam tried to stop the americans in 1991 with ancient and poorly maintained tanks firing projectiles made of recycled scrap steel. It was the best they could do. "
,Fryy,2007-02-19T17:04Z,"Hoskelblaffa?? How long did you spend looking for ""arabs/persians/muslim with understanding of technology"" ?

And where you looking?
Not to forget just why you were looking?


My tip to you is that next time you look for something dont call youself ""hoskelblaffa"" and act like you are impressed of stuff such as can-opener.

Thats kind of stupid, mr technology ... hehehhe
