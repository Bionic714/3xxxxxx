Features:

Prepared
LiveSurface images are high-resolution, print-quality photos with pre-built layer masks, surface data (Vanishing Point planes) and image components (such as shadows) on individual layers. Unlike flat stock photos, LiveSurface images are ready to accept your artwork without additional work. 			

High-res images
Every LiveSurface image has been photographed as a RAW file and saved as a high-resolution lossless TIF. All images are high enough resolution for final offset printing at an average size of 6 x 6 in. (15.25 x 15.25 cm.) and 300 pixel/in. (118 pixels/cm.). 	
				
Sizing templates
Included with every LiveSurface image is an Adobe Illustrator sizing template. Paste your artwork onto each surface represented in the template to ensure that your artwork will fit proportionally. 			V

anishing Point planes
LiveSurface images include pre-built Vanishing Point planes so that CS2 users can simply paste, position and scale their artwork on the desired surface to achieve realistic dimensional results every time.
