A crusty old General leads his dotty family on a relaxing weekend at the seaside, and comic chaos ensues.

This is true classic British comedy of the 80's By the Sea is an hour long TV special, which combined with The Picnic (1975), featured as a double bill on the BBC Video Laserdisc release. Although there were several years apart in the making of both of these, the cast remains the same.

By the Sea was made in Dorset, England along the coast between Bournemouth and Swanage. Ronnie Barker plays the part of a saucy old Gentleman who always game for a bit of slap and tickle, and Ronnie Corbitt the young man bringing his girl friend along on the family holiday.

Family is the word for this, the whole plot is set around their holiday. The opening scene is Swanage bay, or as we get to know it "Tiddly Cove".

The most fantastic thing about this short film is the script. There are no words! Music, sound effects, and murmurs and noises like "ah!" are all that exist. It works so well, and a truly international language anybody can understand.

Typical Two Ronnies humor throughout this, made even more special by the family, notably Madge Hindle playing the shy and slightly geeky companion. Barbara New plays the Aunt, and adds her touch of magic as well.
