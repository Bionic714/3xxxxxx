,hereitcomes,2007-02-06T04:14Z,I have pissed a lot of people off.  Sorry.  All I can do is post it again.  I will not remove.  A friend was helping me with this because I had no idea what I was doing.  I have since learned he was wrong by telling me I had completed several uploads and nobody was seeding.  I will open up my bandwith and I apologize again.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3611997/WARGAMES.ISO
to the same iso as before. The new download will append to the old iso-file."
