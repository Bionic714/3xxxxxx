Lots to cover tonight:

Another helicopter is shot down in Iraq as Sec. Gates says the \"surge\" is not the last chance in Iraq. I guess the Decider still has some decisions left to decree.

Meanwhile, crates of hundred dollar bills go missing in Iraq under L. Bremmer\'s watch and no one much seems to care. Hmmmmm . . . can Tom Delay account for his whereabouts during that time?

In move sure to make Dick (and therefore Lynn) Cheney happier than a shooting gallery full of sedated doves, several states are considering boosting the number of crimes that can be considered for the death penalty. Hmmmm . . .. I wonder if leaking a covert CIA agent\'s identity would qualify? 

Speaking of the Scootster, key testimony by Tim Russert today could bury Cheney\'s Number One at his perjury and obstruction trial today.

And its a miracle! Ted Haggard\'s no longer gay - guess he averted his eyes during Prince\'s Superbowl performance.
