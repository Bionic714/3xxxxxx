,c3bhm,2010-11-28T08:22Z,"Quality is poor considering the filesize, but it's completely watchable.  (Poor encoding, basically.)

English subs synch well, here:

,c3bhm,2010-11-28T08:24Z,"Aspect ratio is off, so use VLC and change to ""16:9"""
,c3bhm,2010-11-29T22:50Z,"Ack - sorry - those subs only synch properly for disc #1.
The subs are all there for the whole movie, but split unevenly - so I'm not sure how to get part 2 synch'd.
SHEESH.
(Sooo glad the days of splitting movies for burning onto two 700mb CDs are GONE.  God that was lame.)"
