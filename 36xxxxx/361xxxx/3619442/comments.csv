Fifty Pills (2006)

Darren Giles has lost his college scholarship, can't work up the courage to ask out the girl of his dreams and doesn't have the cash to stay in college another semester. Unless he can survive the teenage dominatrix, New York's largest drug mogul, convince his parents he's not gay, write a paper on Dante's Inferno, escape three thugs chasing the wrong guy and sell fifty pills of ecstasy in time to make his tuition payment, he'll never get the chance to date the girl of his dreams."
,countoppie,2008-06-17T05:32Z,THZ TORRENT SUCK ASS   i tried to watch it on windows meda player and i only got about a 3 min video 
,RakaDisciple,2008-08-12T06:22Z,two things. idk what the problem is but i would bet its not the torrent since its impossible under any format to make a 3 minute video thats 722Mb. what im really hoping for the sake of laughing at a moron is that ur watching the little sample video because u dont know what a .Rar file is. LOLOLOLOLOL Thx alot for scarin all the seeders away tho noob. now ill have to dl it real slow.
