DVDR = DVD Recordable, NOT DVD Rip"
,akalliaridis,2007-03-08T01:30Z,"> English subs included

This is incorrect, there are no subs in this package. Why write such a thing?"

Looks like a wicked torrent, don't let it die!"
,flobie11,2007-07-30T05:59Z,"Can someone please verify if this has English subs or not??? Thanks!

Someone said 'no subs' but the subs might be part of the AVI and just need to be enabled in DivX Player or VLC. Someone let us know."
,frenzyface,2009-08-04T01:13Z,"No, there aren't any subtitles, but I just got the first movie's subtitles from allsubs.org. I think there's also opensubs dot something or other."
,jemdem,2010-05-10T20:54Z,"yeah I don't know for the subs, they're clrealy not there, neither integrated to the avi files...

But anyway, thank a lot to the uploader !!
