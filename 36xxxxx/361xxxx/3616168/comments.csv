,Â¤Â¤LOKENÂ¤Â¤,2007-02-22T16:29Z,"PLZ SEED... Can only download in 1,3 kB/s... SNÄLLA SEED... Går i bara 1,3kB/s..."
,azirithdor,2007-02-22T19:51Z,The game is locking my computer at the end of the first allied mission when you try to go to the main menu or next mission. Anyone else having this? 
,masseus,2007-02-23T09:37Z,I have the same problem with the game freezing after the 1st mission finnish and when you klick the next mission button or any other button. I have only tried the german side. In my eyes this download is a waste of time since it does not work as it should.
,daneren,2007-02-25T15:53Z,seriously... dont go through this.... IT REALLY SUCKS...
,jimbob22,2007-02-25T22:03Z,need a private server crack - you cant LAN play with this game - even if you use different serials. bummer. tis a fun game but not even close to company of heroes. not sure why so big - must be lots of movies/cut scenes like Direct War. thx for this up!
