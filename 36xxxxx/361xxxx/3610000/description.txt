This package includes everything you need to host your own website on your own P.C. ,
using your existing broadband connection. (HTML editor not included, but some tools to start up your website with are..

You need a webserver. Three are included. The simplest is Server2Go, which can run from a
CD or even a USB keychain drive. The CD mode is sloer than HDD, but hack-proof,
portable, and good for a post-crash recovery.
You need a free URL redirection service which will cloak your origin IP addres (from your ISP
among others) and let you use a port of your chocie, since your ISP likely blocks Port 80.
The homepage for DynSite (see next item) lists many. Recommended : 2mydns.com .
The Dynsite software updates your records with the redirection service with your current
IP address, which with some/most ISPs will change with each reboot. Dynsite runs at
bootup time, so that HTTP requests for the front-end URL the redirections service gives you
will immediately start going to the changed IP. Dynsite FAQ is included here.
We also include an FTP server, Button Studio 2, Amara Flash Menu and Button Maker, 
PayPal Shop Builderm and Shop Factory.
With this an basic HTML skills and/or software, you can run your own ecommerce website.
The servers handle PHP and MySQL, so with Vbulletin (not included here, as we wanted to
keep the package down to one Rapidshare download, but readily available) you can set up and operate your own forums.)
