1. Download and install CCCP from www.cccp-project.net/
2. Play the file using Media Player Classic (not the one that comes with windows) that gets installed along with the pack. Done!!

Surefire way to play this on a relatively slow machine (will jerk but will still play decently well).

1. Download and unzip mplayer from www.mplayerhq.hu/ 
2. Drag the file into the executable called mplayer.
OR
2. (Harder) Run the program mplayer with the file as parameter using the command line."

,Matrixfart,2007-02-19T04:35Z,"Matroska is the most annoying codec/container I have ever experienced. The first time I encountered it I spent 5 days trying to get it to play, installing k-lite and many other codec packs until I finally found cccp and got it to run. Barely. Since it plays like s*** on older machines.

May this codec/container die and make it easy to play video once more.

I do however appreciate that the the seeder of this file was curtious enough to include a short description on how to get it to play properly, thus saving many people hours of their valuable time."
,ga82,2007-02-20T02:00Z,"Easy, Easy, MKV is the best there is. MKV cannot play slow on any machine because it is not a codec. it is only a container and barely takes any time to decode. Probably the fastest there is too.

It is the advanced codecs the come inside MKV (and can only come inside MKV) that takes long time to decode. If you have playback issues, I suggest you try mplayer (www.mplayerhq.hu). Its might be a bit difficult to set up (far easier than before now that it has a gui). But it plays latest codecs as best as possbile. I watched Full dvd res vid in h264 with high bitrate and full options on a Pentium III 1GHz."
