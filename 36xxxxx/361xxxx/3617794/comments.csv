,DeadlyBro,2007-02-14T21:55Z,soo does this mean my psp firmware 3.03 can be conmverted to 3.03OE-C? and if so can i play downloaded games on it? and also is there anyways i can brick my psp from doing this. plx reply thanks alot :P
,DeadlyBro,2007-02-14T22:55Z,where do u actauly find the program for this?
,neeka1,2007-02-14T23:10Z,go to PSP-Hacks.com and look for the downgrading section best thing i ever did
,neeka1,2007-02-14T23:47Z,and the new custom firmware is 3.10 OE-A and by doing this there is a small chance of bricking your psp but 0.000000000001% if you do it properly you cant brick it
,DeadlyBro,2007-02-15T01:50Z,so so can u just downgrad fw 3.03 to 1.5? 
,NeedMachine,2007-02-26T13:37Z,Note that you'll need an unpatched GTA LCS  UMD-disk to perform the downgrade to 1.5!!!
