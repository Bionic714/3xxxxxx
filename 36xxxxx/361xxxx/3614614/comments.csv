,billybud,2007-02-20T22:03Z,this isn't a fix - it just sets back the date on your pc and can stop some programs from working
,davi367,2007-07-31T14:35Z,billybud is right this is pish all you need  to do is go into control panel>time/date and change the year to 20006 before you open auto data then change it back when your finished because the new setting will interfere with certain programmes and if you print invoices check the date.
