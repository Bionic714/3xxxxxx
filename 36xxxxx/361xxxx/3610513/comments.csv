,gamerdude545,2007-03-05T02:12Z,which file is the crack content?
,Evil Bastardo,2007-04-07T01:46Z,"Sorry it took so long to reply.

1) The Patch and several different No CD Hacks are included on the CD. Burn or mount CD image and crack content can be found in the first folder that appears on the CD (#Dave's Hacks and Patch). Install game, Run Patch, copy crack for updated version, I think it's v. 1.1, to Hitman folder on Hard Drive, Restart stupid computer.

2) This game has worked fine for me on 3 completely different computers. Seems to run best on my current one. As for errors, see above, or check my read this file or check official readme on CD. Make sure computer specs. are within Minimum requirements (Located in readme on CD)"
,caggar,2007-09-29T11:55Z,it just says wrong CD inserted! and theres no crack folder....
,MikLarh,2007-11-11T17:29Z,It isn´t working. WTF am i doing wrong.wich files must i use daemon tools on? please help this is f*ing irritating
,blemishednicely,2007-11-16T16:01Z,"I can't get it to go, either..I've literally tried loading every component into Daemon's  mount, but no dice....so far my luck has been shit with RAR files, too-I haven't seen success with ANY of the games done in RAR YET!...Obviously I've gotta be completely unaware of SOMETHING IMPORTANT in there, cause I haven't had any luck at all-kinda getting pissed now...anyone know of a Functional, easy to run version versus the ""Oh, my God you make me so mad I wanna shit my pants and hurl it at you!"" variety's I've come across (ie NOT RAR)? Something Daemon will actually mount? Doesn't look like I'm alone in my difficulty setting up....FUCK!!!"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-16T16:56Z,"'Kay, so I was just buggering about with it before trashing it (I was honestly just about to shut it off, and now whatever meandering avenue I took got me through my Daemon mount to the installer (up until that point I hadn't done it right, so some of the files he mentions aren't evident yet-probably why so much confusion in which ones to mount), did that, but instead of running the game & tossing up a read-me or whatever, it behaves as if I didn't mount the cue file in Daemon at all...some message about needing to insert disc & restart...this rar shit really confuses the hell out of me...dammit I thought I had it, but essentially it's still just about as useful as before I got that one step closer. Anyone know what the Hell you do? It's JUST finished the installer, so the ""C:/Eidos/Hitman....etc."" folder has just been created and I haven't done anything beyond running the install (not really by choice) Hey let's act like it's high-school where I sleep while you tell me things I need to know!!! Hope to finish up 2morrow this' like the 2nd/3rd version i've tried (2 were my fav.app. the dread-fucking rar, & the other only had partial SFX. It worked & had music but no dialogue, footsteps, door noises etc. FUCK! Repeat as necessary)"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-17T09:47Z,But the note in my orange lunchbox says you can BURN & RUN or MOUNT in Daemon...like without burning it-I just pooped myself...
,blemishednicely,2007-11-17T10:40Z,"(If you didn't get the reference, kids going to the ""special"" school used to carry orange lunchbuckets-kind of an easy-identifier...before they got all progressive and ran busses they walked & got lost a LOT)  Not trying to be a dink or anything, but I'm outta discs so I can't burn the disc to make my own startup right now and he even says himself that a cue/img compatible program (like Daemon, which I'm using) can mount it in a virtual drive and run it alternatively. 
Mounting it seems to do no good even though the EIDOS file is now where it should be-I don't know why it won't do it..."
,Nullify1029,2007-11-21T08:34Z,"I have the game running, but the dialogue gets cutoff mid-sentence. What's the dealio?"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-22T07:29Z,"-Nullify1029- How'd you get it to run? I didn't even get that far...my computer shows it as being there in the menu, but it won't run when I pick/reinstall it...what did you do/use to open it? RSVP"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-23T03:08Z,"'kay now I've found the items everyone's looking for (right click on the hack folder & OPEN FOLDER not left click & EXTRACT/(&)RUN in IsoBuster), but now it says globals.dll is missing & nothing...what's all that shite?"
,iwantgta,2007-12-04T06:55Z,seed plzzzz
,Evil Bastardo,2007-12-07T06:26Z,"My simplified Instructions:

1) Unpack all Archived folders (7zip, WinRAR, Winzip ETC.). The main file needed is the 4 image files, which is the CD. The rest are bonus stuff.
2) The image files were created with the program CloneCD (find a torrent or download from Slysoft.com). These image files are also compatible with PowerISO, Daemon tools and Alcohol 120 and possibly Nero7.
3) Mount the image with one of the above programs as a virtual CD OR Burn to a CD.
4) when virtual disk starts Autorun should bring up start/loading screen.
5) Follow on screen instructions for installing the game. 
6) after game is installed open windows explorer and find the CD (either virtual or CD Drive) then copy the crack folder to documents or where you can find it. Run the patch (Double click on it).
7) Copy the crack for version 1.1 into the Hitman main installation folder in your Program files. 

If all is done correctly you should be able to play the game without the CD. I think that the game will not play from the copied CD. It Must Be Cracked.

As for the sound problem, I think it may have to do with the crack file, Not all cracks work perfectly with every game and every computer, You may expect some glitches. Try Uninstalling the game, Re-install it, don't patch it and use the crack for version 1.0 This may solve the sound issue. There is a readme for the game located on the CD. You may find an answer to some problems with the game itself.

As for My torrent. I have personally tested the copied CD on 3 different computers and the game works fine."
,Evil Bastardo,2007-12-07T06:30Z,"P.S. I personally seed from 11:00pm-7:30am Central stantard time US with lowest leve DSL.
"
,Evil Bastardo,2007-12-08T09:01Z,"OK, it seems people are having problems with the RAR file. This is an Archived, or Compressed file, and was created with WinRAR (find a torrent on this website), I think it is also compatible with WinZip and 7zip. Use one of these programs to Extract the files, when asked where to Extract them, try My Documents or Desktop.
Everything in this package was compressed to make the package smaller, hopefully so people with slow download speeds will still be able to enjoy a great game in a short time.
Once files are Extracted look for the files marked .ccd .cue .img and .sub. Start your Daemon tools (or whatever, I prefer PowerISO, very easy to navigate & operate, has Extraction tools, compression, burning CD & DVD, & will mount up to 9 virtual drives). Open the .img file and burn the image to a CD. Patch & Crack's' are in a folder on the CD. For game cracking instructions go to gamecopyworld.com.

I did have some sound annomolies on one of the computers I tested it on. It showed up as speech being cut off and sound effects overlapping, such as door closing sound twice. This is why I included 2 different cracks for version 1.1, the thing is I'm not sure which one solved the problem, and which created it."
,Phuda,2007-12-12T03:17Z,"evil bastardo do you have problam with sound in game, i mean voice when conversation in started beatvin hitman and some other character. there is no so voice. send me e-mail if you want >>> loshmy@hotmail.com "
,ragemaniscool,2007-12-15T09:17Z,"I am glad you uploaded this game Evil Bastardo, but after all that hard work getting it going, I come to find out that I can't use a joypad controller!!! I hate games like this. I use a laptop;("
,Evil Bastardo,2007-12-16T08:06Z,"I did have a problem with the sound on one of the computers this was tested on. I believe what I did to correct that, was to go into the options in the game and turn off the EAX sound option. Not all audio cards are compatible with EAX. It worked but made the sound different, no depth.

As for the controller issue, I hate that too. ""F""ing around with the Mother ""F""ing Keyboard to play a game, especially with racing/driving games. You can't drive a car with the ""F""ing KEYBOARD!!!!!!!!!!! 
I have found that some controllers come with software which allows you to map keystrokes digitally to a controller button, but no axis. This may help.
I thought the game was good enough to play all the way through many times on all difficulty levels. Many, Many, MANY, Hours sitting in front of the ""F""ing keyboard and mouse.

One other piece of information which I neglected to put into my readme is:  The game disk .img files were created with CloneCD, But the actual .img file itself was altered with PowerISO to include the cracks, Patches, etc. Therefore CloneCD will NOT work to open or burn this image, It shows up as an error because the cue sheet and other files were not altered. You must use PowerISO or any other image file reader, which will read .img files, and with burning capability (Nero Burning Rom, PowerISO, Alcohol 120, Daemon Tool, maybe Blindwrite), Or the .img file can be mounted with a virtual drive on the hard drive as a CD with all of the above mentioned image readers.

Appology to those who may have purchased or downloaded Slysoft's CloneCD for the purpose of burning this file. Although, it is a very powerful and easy to use program."
,Sarethi,2007-12-17T10:28Z,Thanks for this CloneCD!
,Tarpic,2007-12-18T05:12Z,Does not work.
,david21ss,2007-12-24T15:24Z,I cant go down the elevator in the beginning i cant use the action on it? Anyone knows why?
,louty,2008-01-01T10:22Z,Jag tycker inte att hit man är ett bra spel....Men andra kanske gör det!!Seeda
,Evil Bastardo,2008-01-08T05:43Z,"You are having a problem with the elevator, in the first level? I seem to remember having a problem at first with the elevator buttons, but found that if you back away slightly and tilt your view up and down the action for the elevator will come up. Then, I think, you have to hold and move selection down to highlight the down on the elevator. I think maybe you are just standing too close to the elevator button for it to come up. 

See my included Walkthrough for some hints and learn a cool move or two."
,wscarblade,2008-01-24T21:57Z,Thnx evilbastardo...really thnx for the file
,wscarblade,2008-01-24T22:00Z,"btw, how come some weapons from your walkthrough in a particular mission is not available during my mission like the silencer handgun from the jungle mission, its not on the list in my mission. Does it depend on how you complete the previous mission?"
,wscarblade,2008-01-24T22:37Z,this thing works!! nice game
,Evil Bastardo,2008-01-24T23:59Z,"In the Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, and all following hitman games, in order to keep a certain weapon in your hideout collection you have to have the weapon on you as you finish/exit the mission. That means you have to be carrying the sniper rifle when you complete the mission, for it to be available in the next and following missions. (you can have multiple weapons at the same time, like pistols and small machine guns that can be concealed, and then carry the shotgun or sniper rifles, however you can only carry 1 rifle type weapon) I found that if you find several rifle type weapons in the same mission, as long as you completed and saved the mission, you could go back and replay the mission to bring out other weapons that you could not carry the first time around, and then add them to your collection.

Anyway, the point of this, is that I'm not sure if the same rules apply to this game, since it was the first one. I will say, though, that if I wrote in my walkthrough that I used a certain weapon during a mission, and it doesn't appear on the weapon equip list, at the beginning of the mission, then I may have picked it up during the mission.

Wait, are you talking about the 3rd part of the jungle mission where, after you feed the tiger, then crawl through the tunnel, and on the other side is the fenced in and heavily guarded camp?
If so, you need to equip the silenced pistol on the weapon select screen at the beginning of the jungle sequence (where you first come into the jungle off the helicopter and have to find the plane wreckage). Since the three parts are considered all one mission, the game will not allow you to access your weapon collection, while in the middle of a mission. Also, if you do equip the silenced piston at the start of the mission, and use up the ammo, you can just drop it, because you do find another on the second floor of the main house in a side room with a guard in it. His back is toward you so you can open the door, sneak and garrot him, without making a sound.
I know I carried the silenced pistol throughout both of the early parts of the mission just so I could use it in the last part at Pablo's camp.

I hope this answered your question. "
,SlayersBoxer,2008-01-28T12:58Z,"Hello people! I am new to downloading games, so can anyone help me with this ""crack"". What am i suppose to do with it? Could someone explain in a simple way ? :)"

,Evil Bastardo,2008-02-04T00:04Z,"Ok, cracking made simple:
1) After burning or mounting the game CD, make sure the CD is in the drive.

2) Using windows explorer, (Start/All Programs/Accessories/Windows Explorer) click the '+' In front of My Computer then click on the '+' in front of the Drive letter that contains the game CD, below that line several folders should appear.

3) Click on the '+' in front of the folder which contains the patch & crack files. (should be the first folder below the game CD Name). 

4) Four other folders should now have dropped down under the crack folder. I recommend installing the patch first so click on the folder Hitman 47 Patch to 1.01, the patch file should show up in the larger right explorer window. Double click on the patch file to run it.

5) After patch is successfull, go back to the left explorer window and click on the folder Hitman 47  V. 1.01 No CD. Two files should now be showing in the right explorer window.

6) Back to the left window and click the '+' in front of Local Disk C: (or whatever your boot drive is), Then click on the '+' in front of Program Files, Then scan down the list to find The Eidos Interactive folder where Hitman 47 Is installed. Click on the '+' in front of Eidos Interactive so that Hitman 47 folder drops down under it, do not open the folder. 

7) Right click and drag and drop the two crack files (Hitman.exe and System.dll) into the Hitman 47 folder, when the drop box appears, click copy here, and when the file replacement window appears click Yes To All.

That's it, in the simplest way I know how to explain. You can find more information on how to Crack and Copy games at gamecopyworld.com and on the homepage On the right side of the page under the heading ""Main"", click on Newbie Hints.

Bravosniper47, are you using Windows Vista? Not sure if this game is compatible with Vista. Make sure you used the correct crack for the version you have installed. If you don't use the patch, you must crack with one of the cracks for version 1.0, if you use the patch, use the crack for version 1.01. If all else fails, try uninstalling and reinstalling the game, and then re-do the patch and crack process.


Remember, The game will NOT play from the copied CD, which I offered, and you all are downloading. You MUST use one of the cracks or Patch and Crack V. 1.01, in order to play the game. I included more than 1 crack for version 1.0 because I remember I had a problem with one of the cracks on one of the computers I tested on, but unfortunately It's been so long ago, I can't remember which one. So if you are using version 1.0 and have this error after cracking, try using the other crack. And Again you may need to uninstall the game and reinstall it fresh."

Zell: Maybe check in the readme file on the disk for information on video problems, you may need to adjust settings on your video card or download and install updated drivers from the manufacturer.

edc1022: I think this was explained in earlier comments for this torrent. The Patch and Crack files are included on the CD. After mounting or burning the CD image (.ing file, burn or mount with PowerISO, Daemon Tools, Alcohol 120%) locate the CD with windows explorer. When you browse the CD, it is the top folder in the selection."
,Jensokking,2008-03-01T13:59Z,"After patching (to v. 1.01) and cracking the game it shows the following message: 

Only part of a ReadProcessMemory or WriteProcessMemory request was completed.

1) Patch the game to V1.1

,blemishednicely,2008-03-23T03:51Z,"I think I know how to get around my sound problem    from before, and am trying to reinstall but now I am running into issues. Trying to read your instructions, but these FUCKING side ads are blocking half the text! Tried asking TPB how to get that shit outta the way, but their submission code generator is a total stuck-up cunt and won't accept its own fucking password. Anyone know how to stop this shit from overlapping all the text? Instructions only work if you can read them!!! To clarify, I AM talking about TPB, NOT Evil Bastardo's Torrent. Also, if anyone else had an issue with partial sound loss (ie: game DOES have music, etc., but NO footsteps, voices, door noises - hinges/slamming - etc.), then try looking in the ""options"" menu (in-game), choose ""sound & music"" and make sure the ""use hardware"" box is UNCHECKED-it's right of the ""sound effects volume"" bar at the top. I can't believe I was that fucking stupid, but yeah I'm sure my issue was a result of an in-game option setting. Now if I could only read the instructions to reinstall it and see for sure..."
,blemishednicely,2008-03-23T03:53Z,"P.S.-Fucking ads! I get why they are there, but they shouldn't obscure the text in the key focus area. WTF happened to the margins???"
,blemishednicely,2008-03-23T04:12Z,"Answered my own text question...hope Evil Bastardo doesn't mind this quick sidetrack...if you are trying to read people's posts in TPB, but can't see all of what's written due to ads overlapping the text, just check out ""view"" in your toolbar, go down to ""page style"", and change it to ""no style"". pretty much all the photos/ads are gone, replaced by a sprawling text-filled utopia of previously obscured/cut off info. Didn't check it out for long, but I don't think you can post in this ""style"" (layout changes a bit, so I may've missed it, as the ""download torrent"" option carried over), to go back simply revisit ""page style"" (in the ""view"" area o/ toolbar), and choose ""basic page style"". Kinda roundabout, but at least I can read, now...hope that helped someone, sorry for the sidetrack, Bastardo!"
,blemishednicely,2008-03-23T06:53Z,"Awesome!!! I had some issues, but I followed Evil Bastardo's instructions (once I could SEE them), EXACTLY and I finally got it back!!! I found my only difficulty was with the patch/cracks, really. For me, the best solution was moryman's way a few posts up (run patch V1.01 & use the last V1.0 folder). Had some trouble until I noticed the ""search"" button to place the patch & then felt like an idiot. Was then further emasculated when I was assured I was, in fact an idiot, and yes my ORIGINAL problem with sound was definitely caused by ""use hardware"" being turned on in the (sound) options menu (this is on by default, I believe). Finally, I am mounted up in a virtual drive (Daemon), and it seems to prefer my starting the game by mounting up & following the lead. It seems to get a little pissy when I leave it mounted, and say come back later and try starting through the start menu. It DOES definitely look like it runs perfectly fine now, though. I will gladly seed this game 'cause I simply damn well LOVE it (and it's a real bitch to find for $ now, too)!!!

,Evil Bastardo,2008-09-09T00:14Z,"The problem I found with the elevator, happens on all the Hitman games. In order for the controls to come up you need to stand directly in front of the buttons and then back away from the wall, then tilt your view angle and the controls should come up."
,Evil Bastardo,2008-09-12T07:34Z,"First you gotta decompress everything. Move the font and picture files into the Windows folder to access in windows. Then burn .img file to CD.
Use CD to install the game. Patch and Cracks are included on the CD you just burned. Using windows explorer, browse the CD, locate and execute the patch update. When patching is finished, use windows explorer to move the Crack file(s) from the CD into the folder in program files, I think it is Eidos Interactive/Hitman Codename 47. Find the hitman.exe file in the program files folder. Move the Crack files here and when windows promts for file replacement, click 'yes to all'. If windows doesn't ask if you want to overwrite the original file then that is not the right place.

All of these instructions are included in a readme file somewhere in the package.

Also there are 3 pages of comments here that other users have written of what they have done to get the game to work. Some of the latest comments say to run the patch and then crack it with version 1.0 crack. I included several cracks for the patched & unpatched version. You may have to try different cracks to get your version to work or download your own crack from gamecopyworld, or megagames.

This is a great game, enjoy."

,Koshorox,2009-04-04T18:40Z,"I was wondering if anyone else is having speed problems with the game.  When I run the game, all of the speeds are increased dramatically.  When you're in-game, your walk is almost your regular run, and everything is faster than it's supposed to be; it's ridiculous.  This is very annoying, and I've had the problem before with another copy I had.  Does anyone know anything about this?"
,e1894,2009-04-14T17:37Z,I have the same problem as Koshorox :(
,deathanode,2009-05-11T03:56Z,"It wont let me progress through levels. i do the training, watch the cutscene, and it freezes. i tried getting a savegame, to see if it was the level. it wasnt. all the levels except the first crash the game for me."

,maorifabio,2009-06-27T12:51Z,"Game works fine, but movement is a little fast. I'm running Xp sp2. Tried to run in different compatibility modes, didn't help. 
Also, at the beginning of every mission, i get my guns and stuff, but no ammo. Is there a way to get some ammo to start the missions with, instead of empty guns?
Thanks."
,LiveInABox,2011-09-30T01:50Z,it works but is unplayable. The speed is ridiculously fast
,LiveInABox,2011-09-30T02:54Z,"ok scratch that comment, if anyone finds the game running way too fast just try playing the game in OpenGL instead of the default D3D. It works. "
,abandonfan95,2012-02-08T15:58Z,if game run too fast disable a core at taskmgr :)
