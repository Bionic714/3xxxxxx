                         Torrent By Evil Bastardo


   The very first in the Hitman Series from Eidos Interactive. A very excellent
game, from the makers of Tomb Raiders and many others, only available for PC.
System requirements are relatively low by today's standards, but still the graphics and sound are awsome. I absolutely love the Hitman series, and have played through this particular one so many times that I composed my own walk- through to complete every mission and get all weapons. The last time I played through on the hardest difficulty level, I found I had to make some changes to my walkthrough to include different strategies.

   Included in this Pack: 1) CloneCD Image files of Hitman: Codename 47 V.1.0 (1 CD), with Official Patch from IO Interactive, and No CD crack files for Patched and unpatched versions, included on the CD. (I did not crack this game myself, but got the files from www.megegames.com. I left the info files intact with the crack files so credit can be given where credit is due. Props to the peeps who really do this shit!) 2) The Hitman Font, Put a hit on your text docs. (Downloaded from the website www.hitmanforum.com. A Hitman Devoted website, for news, trailers, wallpaper, demos, Chat & more.) 3) Official and Fan art Hitman wallpapers for your desktop from all Hitman Games. (Also downloaded from www.hitmanforum.com.) 4) My Walkthrough, in case you get stuck. (Written and composed By Me, and can be found on www.supercheats.com among others) 5) CD Case cover (slim front only) and CD Face JPEGs, for use with various label making software.
