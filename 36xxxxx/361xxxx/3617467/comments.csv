,byblos,2007-02-13T16:52Z,Pleeeeeeease ! :-)
,sakuto,2007-02-13T17:13Z,Hi Craig you are a very big pirate!
,N537JB,2007-02-13T17:55Z,"@ sakuto,

No one cares about who you are! And neither do we care about if you know this guy's name!

But we (Atleast I) do care about that you, on Cloud9, are unprofessional. One example is that you hang around here at TPB ;) Explains pretty much to me..  And that's why I will never ever buy any of your illegal-products from Cloud9.

Well, not to mention Aerosoft, who is also around here at TPB :)...

People will never ever stop sharing addons...

Thx, green_leader :)

Peace Alessandro Cucinotta and Alberto Sangalli and Aerosoft :-)."
