ItÂ´s god Quality, but no sound."
,ArghMatey2006,2008-01-05T17:44Z,"Please seed!

Sampled one episode and sound works fine, use VLC."
,P.K.Dick,2008-03-22T00:42Z,"Nice quality of both sound and video.

Please, seed. Speed is like in the time of beeping boxes called modems..."
,toonman361,2008-03-26T06:18Z,Thanks. I recall this one from the 90's. Much better than Terrahawks.
,toonman361,2008-03-27T05:49Z,"As for sound on the Mac, try the 3IVX codec. It seems to handle all audio.

You NEED an audio codec to actually get some sound, i used AC3Filter. It's free, just google it.
Sound and picture quality is perfect. Brought back some great memories...
And damn that Simone Bendix (Officer Castle) is gorgeous..."
