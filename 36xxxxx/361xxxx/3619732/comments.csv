,Dansk101,2009-06-17T14:01Z,"Great speed... 440 kB/s!
Now I'm just curious if the
game is working or not...
I will report back!"
,Dansk101,2009-06-17T14:29Z,"I mounted the ""VT""-iso file and installed the game by clicking the ""Setup""-exe file. Then I clicked the ""Autorun"" file and selected ""Play Virtua Tennis"". The only small error I found was that when I just started the game by clicking the ""Play Virtua Tennis"" in ""Autorun"", I could not press the start button (the start button was ENTER) so i changed the start button to SPACE and now it works!
So yes Kreese, it works ;)"
,Dansk101,2009-06-17T14:31Z,"BTW i mounted the iso file with ""WinMount 3"""
