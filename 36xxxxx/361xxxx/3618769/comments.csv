I wrote a detailed comment in the page for the other ISO of R&C:SM with instructions: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3619521/Ratchet_and_Clank_Size_Matters_USA_PSP-pSyPSP

To summarize, you need to enter the recovery console, and then enable the NO-UMD option in the recovery console, as well as set the UMD/ISO CPU speed at 266.

Check the link for more details."
