Bootable Windows 98SE - ISO.
I had it on my hard drive for who knows how long. Figured I mind as well seed it. Good for anyone who needs an OS for an older computer I guess. =)

CD Key -

I'll be seeding when I can - my computer is usually online 24/7 unless I "somehow" killed on of my parts and have to buy some new stuff.

Have fun. :)
