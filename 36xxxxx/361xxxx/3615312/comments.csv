,fidofido,2007-02-14T19:07Z,"It's mexican, but based in spain during the civil war 1944 franco nd the whole thing.

Very good movie. Well worth the download.  A different type of show but good to watch. A good kid show as well for a little older kids.11 and up or so"
,ronaldl,2007-03-14T20:24Z,"Fantastic movie, not suitable for kids at all because of the violence. This is an adventure/horror movie, and one of the best I've ever seen!"
,kilz,2007-04-17T23:40Z,dont download this torrent i have been downloading for 5 days and at 75% but over 9 gigs of rubbish data droped.not good for anyone on a limited account
,Evileyed,2007-04-21T22:51Z,"Same problem her.. DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!(Been trying to download serveral versions of this movie, and I always get a lot of wasted data.) 

I'm currently stucked at 99,9 %, missing only 2 pieces, 113 and 561. It consantly resets the download for the 2 pieces, because of hash fail. 
Among all the other hash fails (1,4 GB wasted), its stuck at these to pieces!!!

I doubt this download will work for me.. Its the third time Im trying to download this movie... "
,Evileyed,2007-04-22T12:49Z,"I finially manage to download the last two pieces .. I burned the image and the it works great..

Make sure you some patience when downloading this copy. Because of all the wasted data..
