,drslobb,2007-02-13T09:22Z,Seth have made 5 production seasons. When it fucks up is in season four. becouse Seth made one seasons while Fox wanted it as two season and made a long brake in the middle of season four. therefor it is 5 prod. ses. and 6 seasons
,greysanatomy,2007-02-14T22:07Z,"Listen to drslobb, he's right about this, they have just made two different things about this.. Anyway, naming it season 6 shall we?"
,F3LIIX,2007-02-18T13:33Z,"okay yaeh it's accually season five, but it's easier to call it season 6 just for th recor, and anyway, if one episode a week is aired, its more than one season, i think, cause if there was 29 (27 eps one double and movie) like all the other torrents, the season would be more than half a year, which seems a bit incorrect, especislly since they where cancled for a while, but what the hell do I know?"
