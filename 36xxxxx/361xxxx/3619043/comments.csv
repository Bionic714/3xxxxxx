,otros,2007-02-21T03:52Z,Thankyou for the torrent Emptydoor could you tell me how to add the subtitles
,EmptyDoor,2007-02-21T15:13Z,"As long as the three files are in the same directory, they should be added automatically, as long as your player supports them.

For Linux, you can for example use mplayer, while VLC Player should work for both Windows, Linux and Mac.

,stelfy,2008-04-04T03:34Z,"is anybody else having trouble playing this movie with subs?
every time i try to play this movie, it shuts down my vlc with an error message saying ""vlc has to close, we apologise for incovenience"" etc...
i tried downloading it again, but the same problem occurs. it will play if i don't use subs in open capture device, but my russian's a little rusty,so...
any suggestions, people?"
,stelfy,2008-04-04T03:53Z,"never mind what i just said... i downloaded mplayer, and it's working fine on that.
thanks for the upload, looks like a great film."

,marijumanji,2009-02-09T05:25Z,Subs DID NOT WORK on my (newest) version of VLC player. Mplayer is a piece of shit. Will look for working subs in another place.
,marijumanji,2009-02-09T05:30Z,"UPDATE:
DLed subtitles from http://www.nowsubtitles.com/movie/4323/the+cranes+are+flying.html
and they worked. Would recommend using SRT subs for VLC media player."
,georgem1,2009-11-29T16:02Z,New English Subtitles for this version of the Movie could be found at opensubtitles.org - http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3601589/letyat-zhuravli-en
