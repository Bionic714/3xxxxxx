,OttifantSir,2009-11-13T12:35Z,"There are no passwords, but then again, some of the .rar-files report sizes of >150 MB and are empty, so why bother password-protecting something that isn't there?

And some actor names aren't correct, such as Liv Tyler being named Taylor, Cameron Diaz is Cameran, Alyssa Milano is Allysa, Keira Knightley is Kira Knightly, etc.

Apart from some of the .rar-files being empty, and some of the names are (rather understandably) spelled wrong, I salute village1diot for compiling this collection. You never knew how many actors actually used their birthday suit on film;-)"
