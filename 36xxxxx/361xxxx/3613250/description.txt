"Stiff Little Fingers exploded out of Belfast in the late '70's with their brilliant mixture of top quality tunes, politically charged lyrics and bundles of punk attitude. This DVD captures the band live at the Hackney Ocean on the 9th of October 2004."

This really is an excellent show and shows that Jake Burns and co. has still got it. The (rather useless) bonus interview and photo gallery had to go.
