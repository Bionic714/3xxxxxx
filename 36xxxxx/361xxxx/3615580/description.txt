"What we have here is Elvis on July 24 1970, rehearsing for the forthcoming Las Vegas concerts and in special the That's The Way It Is filming of it.

Volume 1 starts out with the intro-drums, before Elvis sings That's Alright, Mama. After this he jumps into I Got A Woman, just like a real concert. This is typical for this CD. It reminds very much of a Concert-rehearsal. Elvis is serious almost all the way, except for a corny reprise of Don't Cry Daddy.

Volume 2 is much more loose and lacy than the first one. Elvis is probably starting to get tired of rehearsing and he doesn't give his all in any of the songs.

It's taken two decades since his death for these recordings to surface unofficially. It'll probably take another decade before the official record company makes a decision on these recordings, by which time, original music fans who grew up with the King probably won't be around either. Recorded live at RCA Studios, Hollywood CA, July 24,1970 Sound quality is excellent."
