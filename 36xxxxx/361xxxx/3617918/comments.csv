,tczupta,2007-02-14T05:25Z,"This torrent contains all the files found in the virtual machine created by VMware 5.5.1. It was created using Jas's 10.4.7 OS X install disk with SSE2 enabled. This should work for most people even those with SSE3 machines. If your a total noob heres what you have to do. Go to vmware.com and download a program called vmplayer, its free. Then choose to open a VM, and direct it to the vmdk file that is within the torrent. This is obviously after unrar-ing the file. Good luck, post any problems."

,suprxz,2007-02-14T20:17Z,Hi there wouldn't it be better to Upgrade it to latest 10.4.8 and then release it as a torrent. 
,tczupta,2007-02-14T21:44Z,"I tired installing with the 10.4.8 disk, it proved unsuccessful, but if you'd like to do that go right ahead... then post the link here.

,suprxz,2007-02-15T15:37Z,I think you need to apply the_defiant patch. http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?showtopic=38125

,supaphr33k,2007-09-02T06:18Z,"If you get the rebooting problem, change the ""Guest OS"" setting from ""Free BSD"" to ""Windows NT"".

,Mr-OsX,2007-09-13T16:01Z,"2 things:

1. Is anyone working to get v10.4.10 functional in VMWare?  This version is required to run iWork '08 and it would be really cool to be able to run this software in my VM.

2. I ran into the reboot issue as well and I changed ""Guest OS"" to ""winnt"" and it worked just fine.  Now to figure out how to get a display setting in OS x86 higher than 1024 x 768.....

,darkguard10,2007-09-13T18:31Z,It appears that it doesnt work on AMD systems - i have the reboot problem on my AMD system and it started right up on my Intel system.
,Mr-OsX,2007-09-13T20:22Z,"I appreciate the size of the RAR File.  Anything bigger would have been too big.  Any suggestions on the best way to extend the size of /dev/dsk0s1 from 5GB (with about 2.5GB useable) to something larger?

Any suggestions on how to run with a resolution higher than 1024 x 768?"
,karakkas,2007-09-16T22:31Z,Will this run under a Mac with the latest VMware Fusion?
,velmanny,2007-09-22T05:17Z,It will work under VMWare fusion. Be sure to edit the FreeBSD.vmx file and change guestos to 'winnt'.

I have tried to change the guest os to winnt (and other windows), to various unixes, to FreeBSD, to other, etc., but without success. Do you have any idea what can help to boot in order? thanks in advance"
,Bravo3000,2007-10-12T21:33Z,"why you don't buy a real mac?
Since Lisa the PC is just rubbish"
,karakkas,2007-10-14T15:21Z,"After editing the ""Network Port Configuration"" within OS X in the System Preferences, bridget networking functions. I also had to change to ""winnt"" guest.
Changing the screen resolution doesn't work, my main problem is I can't get USB working. I'm using VMWare Workstation 6, and the USB port shows up as ""Cypress USB Device"" but OS X does not recognize the attached USB HFS+ device. 

Bravo3000, I own a Mac, still I have need for this. BTW what are you doing here if you don't need it yourself?"
,drunkrd,2007-10-23T23:38Z,"For those who want to expand the disk size...

1 - Create a new virtual disk with the wanted size.
2 - Use something like Symantec Ghost (win32) or G4L (Linux) to clone the  original virtual disk to the larger virtual disk...

,hxh103,2007-10-25T23:13Z,"Yea, I am getting the same problem as a lot of people on here regarding the reboot. How do I change the guess OS setting from ""Free BSD"" to Windows NT like it has been suggested above by supaphr33k?"

The guest operating system you are running is using the Physical Address Extension (PAE) processor option.  

Tried going there, but suggestions  from their site did not work.  I also went to the patch that someone posted earlier, but looks like all the patch links are down. Any help?"

Working on VMWare server console 1.0.2. 
Network and sound working. 

.

GREAT DOWNLOAD ! TK'S TCZUPTA.  !!!!

.

Some issues:  ===========

---> rebooting loop. 

Changed to guestOS = ""winnt"" in FreeBSD.vmx and this was solved.

---> network not worked first time, but using Mac OS network config wizard solved the problem. (vmware in ""bridged"" network configuration)

---> don't needed to remove FreeBSD.vmss  (haven't this file)
