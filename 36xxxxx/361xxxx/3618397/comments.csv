Stupid sweedish people. Have to have text on everything even when their language is pretty much related to english in some ways.//

Well, since it is american english, and not brittish english, in this movie, we prefer to have subtitles.

And if you think that swedish people are stupid just because they don´t understand other languages, then you truly are a jackass.

Så lite svenska undertexter på denna hade varit rena grädden...

BIG THANKS TO kollll FOR A GREAT UL

,kukaster,2007-02-16T23:32Z,have prob with extracting these files..... corrupt files??  what 2 do?   tryed winace and winrar..... help anyone? 
,crimm2887,2007-02-16T23:43Z,"i got corrupt files part15.rar and part74.rar, anyone else have this problem, or have an answer???"
,bobaah,2007-02-17T04:28Z,well I think the average swede knows english pretty well. But theres a difference in writing and understanding speech. We got the education but not the experience to catch subtle things which is why many want swedish subtitles. Although it's amazing how people can make a big fuzz over nothing^^

Filesize on rar015 is 36739 kB...it should've been at 48829 kB
Filesize on rar074 is 47262 kB...it should've been at 48829 kB

Any chance you can check if no. 015 and 074 matches 48829 kB ???
If so Plz put those correct parts out on TPB.

If they dont match, Please repack the movie and put a proper working torrent out on TPb once more ...PLEAZZZE kollll
