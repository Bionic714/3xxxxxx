,Pazze86,2007-02-16T12:40Z,Skuggan vad i helvete är det som är patetiskt med dubbelposT??? snarare din enorma röv som täcker solen som är patetisk...
,garlic_b,2007-02-16T18:21Z,hi. Anyone else getting rar errors on this?
,onair77,2007-02-16T21:09Z,Is this another corrupt file? Last weeks was and I don't want to start downloading this one if it is. Anyone else having probs?
,skuggan,2007-02-16T21:13Z,"the pathetic part with doubleposting is that were spreading the seeders over several identical torrents, and that means that speed will decrease very much overall.. but hey, its your call guys.
And for the fact that 70% of kolll's uploaded torrents contains incomplete and broken rar-files dont bother you at all?

I've uploaded my last torrent to TPB, sayanora suckers."
,triniboynkosi,2007-02-17T01:20Z,"skuggan I was trying to download yours when you posted it but it never came although I left my pc on all night.Don't give up on posting torrents?kollll has a good reputation thats why people will download his torrents over yours even if he double posts.

P.S. I never had a problem with his torrents."
,skuggan,2007-02-17T03:41Z,"It's not about ppl not downloading ""my upload"", i couldnt care less.. im just trying to do something for the community, some kind of  automatic dupe-check or warnig on already exixting torrents would be nice tho.
Cause duplicate torrents is in fact extremely unecessery. Not only does it spread the seeders, in the long run it makes the tracker slower, and the users confused (wich one to download etc..) i have not been uploading to TPB for long, but every single tv-series episode i've uploaded has been reupped by someone who either can't search, or don't give a fuck. from now on ill stop uploading series, because it's really no point.

The main reason i uploaded at all was so ppl could get the episodes as fast (or faster) as any other serious tracker (tb, sct, etc..) not 4 hours after them."
