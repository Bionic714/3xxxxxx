,Dr. Frikadel,2007-02-06T15:08Z,"So where did this v4.6 come from. Because it's the koreans themselfes who refuse to share the stuff with the rest of the world...

Almost to good to be true....

Danke,
Dr. Frikadel"
,FrozenPenguin,2007-02-06T15:16Z,"Hi Dr, it came from a usenet post by Virgin747 on Dec 15th. I am seeding at the moment. Cheers, FP"
,4X-AXG,2007-02-06T15:40Z,"ehmm this is by far not complete..the 4.6 version consists of three files:

AdobeTP4.6_1.exe
AdobeTP4.6_2.exe
AdobeTP4.6_3.exe

and this is only the third (and last) part"
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-02-06T15:42Z,mmm....4X-AXG do you have the other files?
,FrozenPenguin,2007-02-06T15:46Z,"Hi 4X-AXG, well I guess something is better than nothing. The usenet post on Dec.15th by 747virgin consists of the following:

Folder: Tantris GA & Military AI Addon (compatible with Adobe)

File: AdobeTP4.4_1.exe
File: AdobeTP4.4_2.exe
File: AdobeTP4.6_3.exe

If someone else has access to AdobeTP4.6_1.exe and AdobeTP4.6_2.exe I would love to see them. 

Cheers,

FP"
,4X-AXG,2007-02-06T16:53Z,"well nobody has the full 4.6 version
both versions consist of three installation files each..only 4.4 is out 'fully' and only two out of three files are out for the 4.6 installer

and no, something is not better than nothing, because installing only 1 or 2 out of three install file will leave you without a lot of models..so a full 4.4 is way better than an incomplete 4.6"
,FrozenPenguin,2007-02-06T17:10Z,"Hi 4X-AXG, I was under the impression that 4.6.3 adds to your basic Adobe Pack 4.4 AI. I was not aware it deletes any 4.4 planes on the install if that is what you mean.

If you mean you are missing some 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 planes but still still have all your 4.4 planes and the 4.6.3 planes, well...I'd love to have the 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 planes also.

I installed it and do not see any reduction in the number of old planes. I see an increase. Perhaps others will confirm yay or nay.

Cheers,

FP"
,FrozenPenguin,2007-02-06T18:00Z,">>both versions consist of three installation files each

Hmm...the 4.4 files I d/l from TPB consist of only 2 files.

AdobeTP4.4_1.exe
AdobeTP4.4_2.exe

These same two files were in the 12-15 usenet post by Virgin747. If I am missing a third file from 4.4 I'd love to get that one too.

Anyways, my FS9 is a changed beast after ATP. It's like night and day.

Hopefully others will chime in and we'll know more.

Cheers,

FP"
,4X-AXG,2007-02-06T20:04Z,"4.4 and 4.6 are stand-alones..sno 4.6 is not an udpate to 4.4

the link you've provided to the 4.4 share should contain all 4.4 files..I 'don't have any of them anymore since I've deleted the package"
,Maxpower1985,2007-02-06T22:11Z,"The Flightplans from Pack 4.4 are quite old. But it will be a great basic to update into current flightplans.  since one month, I have changed the A32X Models from FSP to Evolveai, changed several liveries into current and add a lot of new airlines. With ttools from Lee Swordy you not need much skills to do it for your own"
,scooby321999,2007-02-06T22:14Z,"Well I have (on my comp already):

AdobeTP4.6_2.exe

AdobeTP4.6_3.exe

But all that is missing is the key file, the first one!! These last to are available publicly if you have a look but the deliberately left the first one needed for the installation. The only way of getting it is for a Korean here to ask a Korean on the Tantiris (Korean) site to give it to them. They will only share the first file to a Korean...

Before you flame me for being racist or whatever, which I am not trying to be, this is the truth and has been discusses here on TBP ages ago...."
,PopArt,2007-02-06T22:37Z,"Maxpower1985, that's what I am working on atm. Replacing old models, adding new plans and planes, new lightmaps, versions etc. I have been working on it for a couple of months now (using Adobe 4.4 and 4.6 as a base package, it is extractable) and every spare hour goes into it. Once done, it will be uploaded here. Truth is, I am never satisfied and new flightplans are released every day..."
,Dr. Frikadel,2007-02-06T23:07Z,"@ scooby321999: Good god man..you said you have AdobeTP4.6_2.exe. LOAD UP!!

Danke,
Dr. Frikadel"
,richardbach,2007-02-06T23:29Z,"Yeah! Load the second file!
We begin to download (and share, of course) the already aaible last twos.
maybe someone could share the first one meanwhile. ;)"

I can't login anymore?
Anyone managed to today?"
,neslesman,2007-02-07T23:12Z,"On the face it looks like flying bytes are having trouble with their service provider or something over the domain.  This from a non expert, just passing thoughts.
Today you get re-directed to https://www.proinet.se/ which seems to be some kind of hosting outfit. "

,Saied,2007-03-02T04:09Z,"Ok everyone. I HAVE ADOBE 4.6. the whole thing. 

BUT when u want to install it, you need a password. SOMEONE who is good at hacking or figuring out passwords can talk to me and ill send them the file. 
till then good bye."
,Rubber_Duck,2007-03-15T18:56Z,"Hi Saied,

please seed the whole package. Then we all can try to find out the password.

Thx"
,cheechm,2007-04-23T18:28Z,"Just use the PMDG 747 ""enable button"" to skip the password"
,Saied,2007-04-27T22:59Z,"adobe ai 4.6

,Chriscram1,2007-04-28T14:28Z,"What do you mean by the PMDG enable button?
when i download It brings up the installer but dosnt let me click next. Cant understand what it says with it being Korean or Japenese"
,Chriscram1,2007-04-28T19:44Z,Oh and another thing.....do you need 4.4 installed for this to work?
,Saied,2007-05-05T21:51Z,nope u dont need adobe 4.4
,Saied,2007-05-11T03:59Z,just download it and run it man.
,Sibalo,2007-05-28T18:26Z,"Said bro .. I get the same thing where I can't click next :(

tried with both 2 and 3"
,knightsthatgoni,2007-05-30T13:41Z,"This file will allow you to install Adobe's Traffic pack 4.6, parts 2 & 3. 

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3502904/PMDG_747F_Cargo_crack

Place the Enable Button & Adobe's Traffic pack 4.6, parts 2 & 3 into a folder. 

Run the enable button before you open the Adobe files.

Now, when you run the Adobe installer you should see that the ""next"" button is now clickable, keep trying different buttons until the installer works. 

Point the Abobe installer to a specific location or folder to allow the installer to install all the files."
,dayocks,2007-06-04T17:49Z,"So, we know that parts 2 and 3 are here thanks to saied. Can someone confirm that the PMDG crack allows install? And now, the question is, where can we get the 1st part?"
,knightsthatgoni,2007-06-04T23:42Z,"YES the PMDG crack allows install. You'll end up with 3 folders. Aircraft, Scenery and Texture. 2.45 gigs of the best AI traffic bar none."
,atav4156,2007-06-08T21:32Z,so can wnyone find part one?? i can tell i'm missing some 737s 
,knightsthatgoni,2007-06-18T01:35Z,"Copy and paste all the aircraft folders into your Flight Simulator 9\Aircraft folder.

Copy and paste all the texture files into your Flight Simulator 9\Texture folder.

Copy and paste the Traffic_AdobeTP_4_6 file that's in the Adobe\Scenery\World\Scenery folder into your FlightSimulator9\Scenery\World\scenery folder.

That's it.


"
,avionix,2007-06-20T14:23Z,"erm, may i ask, how come there's no file 1?

is file 1 totally not needed? so files 2 and 3 will be sufficient to install the whole ATP 4.6?

thanks -"
,charonB,2007-06-21T09:24Z,"I have the first part (AdobeTP4.6_1.exe), but it is password-protected. Instead of babbling around, I will seed it and hope for anyone to give us the PW.

I won't recommend installing only Part 2 and 3 with the enable.exe, because the ""continue""-button is disabled, because the installer doesn't find the first part of the installation - a good reason, I think! Who knows, what he's missing? Many fine aircrafts and flightplans - that's for sure... :)

So, let's hope for the best,
