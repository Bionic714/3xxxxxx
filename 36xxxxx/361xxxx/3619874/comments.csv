,Nargathos,2007-05-08T02:04Z,uhm. does it matter what audio type its in aslong the quality is nice?? media players are named that for a reason so np if its ogg or wma or mp3 etc...
,Mijmanxx,2008-03-14T23:30Z,"As long as the wma is good quality, it'll still convert to a fine mp3. (Wma does suck, but it's not the end of the world)"
,lightsinthebay,2008-10-24T17:56Z,"excellent band, thanks!"
,xiphos809890,2008-11-26T19:19Z,One of my favorite albums of all time! I urge everybody who downloads this to support the band and buy the CD!
,usulpsychonaut,2009-04-22T00:29Z,"Im not a big fan of doom metal but this is good stuff. Note, unable, or I don't know how, to convert to mp3 on my mac, can't add songs to itunes..."
,mad_nate,2009-05-11T03:54Z,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this album. When I saw the term ""doom"" in the comments here I wasn't impressed, but I decided to download it anyway based on the nice review posted here. My first thought when I heard the first song was ""this is just like Black Sabbath."" But not exactly. There are a lot of riffs that really evoke Sabbath, but a lot of the soloing evokes Iron Maiden, and there are clearly some more modern influences as well. The vocal aren't spectacular, but the melodies are interesting and at least it's not a ""death metal voice"" -- I'll tolerate about anything but that.

Overall, thumbs up, I'll be spending a while listening to this."
,mad_nate,2009-05-11T03:55Z,"Oh yeah, and I agree about the format, it would be nice if it were MP3. On the other hand, I noticed that there's another MP3-encoded torrent of the same album on TPB with no seeders."
