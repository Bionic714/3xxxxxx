,rhs05d,2007-02-13T04:45Z,Newb question...how do I actually install these files on my computer?
,kawa_ninja,2007-02-13T16:57Z,"whats the difference between enterprise edition and prof edititon?

what's enterprise edition anyway?"
,markxing,2007-02-16T00:06Z,"Sorry, but to clarify... What's MSRP?  But Retail price is like... around $300- $400."
,jasonbr123,2007-02-16T18:38Z,Newbie question. How long should you seed the torrent? I have 10 mb conection speed.
,markxing,2007-02-17T22:37Z,"@jasonbr123

Please seed as long as you can please.  The file is pretty small (558 MB)compared to the expanding hard drives."
,gordonfreeman797,2007-02-18T12:01Z,"can anyone confirm what is on this? Word, xl, ppt, access etc? does it really pass validation? does it have the pdf add-ins? does it allow add ins to be d/loaded? can u get ms updates?"
,anver0819,2007-02-18T12:47Z,"The extracts from the rar file is exactly the same with Unloosed upload on: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3586709/Microsoft_Office_2007_Enterprise_Edition.  Absolutely, this will not pass the Microsoft Genuine Validation as well. The Office Enterprise Edition available in the market now for retail is the one which include the ""Communicator 2007"" which for sure will pass the Microsoft Genuine Validation if you have one.  Maybe, just maybe, this will encounter a problem later, nevertheless, for the moment you can use and enjoy it.  On my home computer, I still have the Office Professional 2003 and it didn't pass the Genuine Validation but it still can be use without any problem and it even got security and software updates, last week is the latest.  I just noticed, this has no problem as long as the Windows Operating System is registered and genuine like Windows XP SP2. If you are leaving in the US and you need this program to integrate with your Microsoft Office Accounting 2007, of course there is a big problem particularly in Microsoft Money and in your on-line banking."
,markxing,2007-02-19T21:06Z,"This does pass the Validation for Microsoft!  Use the serials from the keygen.  I'm telling you, IT DOES WORK!!!  So the retard says it does not work is a dumbass."
,markxing,2007-02-19T21:07Z,"This includes: Access, Excel, Groove, Infopath, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher and Word."
,one4themoney,2007-02-20T00:54Z,Will this work in Vista 32bit?
,anver0819,2007-02-20T02:05Z,"For those who were able to pass the Genuine Validation and were able to update the add-in(s) or plug-in(s), please be so kind and generous enough to upload via this torrent the six items stated on the latest comment on: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3586709/Microsoft_Office_2007_Enterprise_Edition
It is a simple act of sharing and many will be grateful especially for those who cannot download these plug-ins because they did not pass the genuine validation.  A milion thanks in advance. . . "
,anver0819,2007-02-20T04:15Z,"By the way, for further info, this is the Office Genuine Validation Microsoft home page: http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/office/FailureScenarios.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=e5f4f9c7-1a6a-484b-99fd-c231442deaa4&cCode=PHL&Error=114&sGuid=ac0a3d67-8382-41a3-946d-9cfdcfaf7ca2
Of course this download works good basically, however, for those who are using the earlier versions of Office programs intensively with versatility for a long time, there is not much difference without these plug-ins or add-ins update which can only be downloaded and installed after this genuine validation. Good luck. . . "
,cordlesskent,2007-02-21T04:45Z,Sorry for the dumb ass question...does this work for XP? Thanks in advance if it does!!!!
,paapaa22,2007-02-24T13:15Z,Anyone knows where to get Finnish version?

I don't need Office trying to download stuff without me knowing about it.

,agoodfella,2007-03-06T22:26Z,"My worry is that this will either: 1) stop working all of the sudden, 2) Microsoft will release a stealth bug to invalidate the programs later... how likely are these worries? Thanks"

,Rush Evo,2007-03-07T22:29Z,what is keygen
,markxing,2007-03-08T05:29Z,"@rush evo

Dude... a keygen is a program (Usually an executable) that can randomly generate a series of numbers for a particular program or whatnot."

,Toyz,2007-03-15T20:32Z,What is .DAA file??? Shoyld i rename?
,legrandbisoux,2007-03-17T11:58Z,".DAA file is a CD/DVD image file processing tool, which allows you to open, extract, create, edit, compress, encrypt, split and convert ISO files, and mount these files with internal virtual drive. It can process almost all CD-ROM image files including ISO and BIN. DAA is a format for an image file, which supports some advanced features, such as compression, password protection, and splitting to multiple volumes (similar to .RAR and other compression formats).

Ypou can use POWERISO to burn it here is the link : http://www.poweriso.com/"
,markxing,2007-03-18T00:08Z,This download does NOT contain a .DAA :)

then run the keygen for a code... put that in-BOOM DONE. then come here and post a thankyou.

this is my thanks~ freew33d"
