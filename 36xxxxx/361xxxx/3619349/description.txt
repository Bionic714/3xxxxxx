I\'m an amateur photographer from BC, Canada. In 2003, I started a b&w project on Crescent Beach. The fifty photos featured on this disc include what I\'ve termed \"dungeness\" and \"tides\". The former shows 25 photos of the Dungeness crab, a prominent sight at the intertidal zone, and the latter abstractly looks at the tide itself, with swirls of seafoam and electrified water. 

By enabling closed captions, you can view the exact time, date, shutter speed and aperture of the 50 featured photos. 

The DVD-ROM feature includes an archive of all the photos which were considered in the final 50. They feature alternate compositions as well as those shots or subjects which fell short of my expectations. Browse the disc to find the \"archive\" folder which includes over 600 photos. 

Questions and comments are welcome, my email address is included on the disc.
