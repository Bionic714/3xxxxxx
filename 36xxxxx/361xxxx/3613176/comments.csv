A hip-hop tale which explores the social subculture of street dancing, focuses on a pair of friends, named David and Elgin, who want to open their own hip-hop dance and recording studio. However, in order to make that dream come true, they must first win a street dance competition against another group of dancers to prove that they have talent. When Elgin and David have a falling out, it threatens their shot at the big time."
