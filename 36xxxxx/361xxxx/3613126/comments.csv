You don`t know what a .torrent is? Take a look at wikipedia."
,emma81,2007-03-07T13:23Z,"Currently it`s not possible to add maps from other country to the Navman F20. The maps on the microsd-card depend to the serial of this mircosd card.
We first have to deactivate the security check of the navman.
Anyone interessted in a image of a german Navman F20?

You find the microsd-card under the serial-label on the backside of the navman.

good luck ..."

Just hate when you buy something, and have to buy something as simple as a connectionkit, witch obviously should have been in the pack when you bought the product..  "
