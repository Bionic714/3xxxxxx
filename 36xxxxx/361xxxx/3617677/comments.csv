Is this working for you guys??? "
,tallen90,2009-03-28T13:11Z,"Amazing :)

Really fast download and took only a few minutes to install. Also virus-free with AVG and Malwarebytes.

Anyone confused about the RAR files - extract the first one, and open the extracted folder. Open setup and you're done."

,vinstern,2009-12-09T03:23Z,"If u find that the menus are in Spanish and you want to change them back to English. Follow the procedure below

1. Uninstall Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 and extension manager.

2. Go to C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR ACCOUNT\Application Data\Macromedia
In some cases the folder Application Data folder may be hidden. In that case select 'show hidden files' from folder options in tools.

3. Delete the folder Dreamweaver 8 from the folder Macromedia.

4. Reinstall and you will find that the menus have changed back to english."
