,infocom4ever,2007-02-15T19:16Z,"Dont get me wrong and thanks for the upload! Its always a pleasure to watch witch mailbox he gonna get his beard stucked in. Under siege was ok but the others? Tea cures anthrax, speaches about the nature (after blowing up a oil rigg??!!), petting the natives or odd ginseng cures? And of course the mandatory leg and arm fracture. "
,JesusEatsBabies,2007-02-15T23:28Z,"thanks for another crappy seagal movie, i still want to watch all of his shitty movies but i dont want to waste oney on them"
,yucatundra,2007-02-16T07:09Z,segal is fake  is not whorth this movie
,djfirestorm,2007-02-21T07:55Z,"This isn't as bad as his other movies. Yes Underseige 1 & 2 are good movies, but infocom4ever, there is one more movie that was good...Fire Down Below. Although his movies are not that great, I do however watch them all.lol Its not his acting, its just his scripts and self directing. If you put him in a good story, he could make some amazing movies. And the legs and arms thing...lol...it is actually quite realistit to what would actually happen in a kung foo fight...unlike Jet Lee who flies and does impossible things. Mabey a bunch of us should write him a script for a REAL movie. Oh wait, there is one GREAT movie he was in...Executive Decision (that is the one where he dies 15 minutes in hahahaha)"
,madhouserevival,2007-10-05T11:27Z,"I entered a class in Miami that was an extension of his school and I have to say that the shit you see happening in the movies is exactly what the techniques look like in real life. Personally, I suffered both shoulders dislocated, fingers and toes broken and literally flying through the air across the dojo during demonstrations (I was the tallest guy in class, so I got to be the tackling dummy)."
,madhouserevival,2007-10-06T04:33Z,"This movie is terrible. It's just not interesting or believable. The fighting is why we watch Seagal, but there's just not that much of it. The script is just full of unnecessary dialogue and the music is ridiculously overbearing.

Urban Justice was way more fun to watch."
