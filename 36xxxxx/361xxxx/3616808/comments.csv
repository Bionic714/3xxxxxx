Thanks alot in advance for the help.

,ps2cho,2007-02-19T17:45Z,could be a tracker problem. Try using uTorrent and see if it does it. uTorrent is better than Azureus as AZ has big memory leaks as its java based.

Regarding the game crashes and missing files, all I did was unrar, mount with D-Tools and install using the serial key someone put here on the first page, then cracking it using the crack in the other Supreme Commander torrent.

The game works fine for me except my GPU is having a hard time with it. I'm guessing it has something to do with your torrent client and/or your computer."

you have to put the crack in game's bin folder, that makes it start up. but for some reason when i play, it crashes. like as SOON as its done loading it crashes to desktop..any1 know wats wrong?? i have placed the dll's from the win2k folder in my game's bin folder and in the root directory, and ive also placed the win2k folder itself in both. i have also put that HATRED.exe in both. any1 know what this is?? i dont know what it does."

just because baby cant play or understand the game doesn't make the game bad, makes the baby a simplition.

Ta was always about 90% Prep 10% action, building massive bodies of war while defending your base, vs other players your going to get your ass kicked if you dont understand that, and how to quick strike to reduce your enemies forces, its not a, i build more war factories, and tanks so i win game, its a tactical thinking game while most your attacks will be routed to slow your enemy enough to have a way to stomp him at some stage.

(that is how Ta was) 
i've not played this on a computer able to handle it, and am going to try it now, if it is at least as good as Ta it will be better than some of the junk Ea has passed in the last couple of years since they decided to kick westwood in the nuts."

I recommend 7zip for unzipping which is open source - http://www.7-zip.org/

Most people use Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120% for mounting and installing.

I know this version of Alcohol 120% works fine http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3620657/Alcohol_120_v1.9.6.4719_full"

hours of research and playing with peer guardian 2, I
found 100's of connections per seconds comming from
two sources. media defender and some other (forget).

I added this to my firewall ACL.

Deny All Protocol ANY 216.73.85.0-216.73.88.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 209.62.175.0-209.62.177.255 ANY Any

Deny All Protocol ANY 64.93.0.0-64.93.255.255 ANY Any

Boom, 400k a sec downloads once again.

As soon as I started peer guardian I noticed the

added those to the ACL.

                     Supreme Commander (C) Gas Powered Games

Release Date: 02-11-2007 Protection: SecuROM Release Type: DVD9 Game Genre: Strategy

                             -=:Release Notes:=- 
For a thousand years, three opposing forces have waged war for what they believe is true. There can be no room for compromise: Their way is the only way. Dubbed The Infinite War, this devastating conflict has taken its toll on a once peaceful galaxy and has only served to deepen the hatred between the factions. After centuries of struggle, the battle for supremacy has at last reached a turning point. Under your strategic command and leadership, only one faction will reign supreme. Will you be victorious and elevate your race to domination? Or will you lead them into the hell of defeat and ultimate extinction? Delivering one of the most advanced and innovative features of any RTS game, Supreme Commander establishes a breathtaking new standard for sheer scope and scale of gameplay. Massive battles unfold across maps of unparalleled size and scope and thousands of units fight to the bitter end.

                                -=:Scale:=-
Witness tiny assault bots get crushed underfoot by towering mega units, or watch as smaller attack bombers try in desperation to bring down a gigantic experimental unit.

                                -=:Scope:=-
Concentrate on individual ground battles or zoom all the way out in a single, seamless motion that reveals the full theatre of war. Plan and unleash multiple strategic attacks from this strategic vantage point. Dominate your enemies by coordinating strategic ground, naval and air attacks. Initiate a crippling air strike with your attack bombers and support them with a ground assault of heavy and light artillery that demolish the opposing faction's main base. Exterminate your foes once and for all by sinking their aircraft carriers with a surprise submarine attack.

                             -=:Install Notes:=-

,Exodus_D,2008-03-26T18:31Z,"Everyone: This torrent downloads and works perfectly. If you are having problems unzipping the file, use winrar and unpack all files. Then, delete hatred.exe from the folder you saved your uncompressed files to, then run the install. Works perfect. Grade A Torrent HATRED. Keep up the good work. (P.S- Not sure why hatred.exe shows as viral. I deleted it just to be safe. Ran AVG after install and fount nothing, so...)"
