,Surfer_Girl1,2007-02-10T07:03Z,"I have to agree with badvista, linux rocks, ive tried several versions of it, Suse Pro required me to know some commands but wasnt bad, and if Linux has a virus that can infect it, it's in a test tube, sealed in a vault in some lab.  Hate is bad so i feel sorry for the pathetic people who upload this crap. If i hated them i would play into their game,  so i just view them as pathetic nobodys living in mommies basement with no life. and especially no surfer girl. Surfer Girls Rule"
