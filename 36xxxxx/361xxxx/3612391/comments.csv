,rifles,2007-02-06T21:42Z,downloaded and it's in an MKV format - don't know how to open so I assume it's fake
,rifles,2007-02-06T21:43Z,OK - my bad it's real
,hexmex,2007-02-06T22:56Z,thats funny - somebody isnt able to open and so it has to be a fake!.... strange logic in particular because sN1b wrote down the necessary codec in the info... strange people here sometimes...
,tazly,2007-02-07T18:46Z,"This is real and coded with the best codecs available! h264 and AAC have much better compression than xvid and MP3, so smaller file sizes."
,death734,2007-02-07T20:39Z,"this actually looks real good for the file size and high resolution (aka low bits/pixel) but way better then i expected. the video is as good if not a little better then the 350mb rip
does anyone know what the audio bitrate is?"
,sN1b,2007-02-08T00:22Z,"It should be more or less 32kbits. But audio isn't encoded using bitrate. Aside from mp3, which would  probably kill your ears at 32kbits."
