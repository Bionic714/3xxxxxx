You must have the old torrent you too.
I accidently uploaded the first torrent
that was up for ~1 Hr then i delited that one
because i saw it was the wrong one *sorry*
And then uploaded the right one. (This one)

And there is so many downloading it now
so you must see users in your client if you
have downloaded this right one..."

,whocares401,2008-02-15T19:40Z,You had better be a Fan of this Show to download all of it.  It's taken me 12 days and 6 hours to get it.  Better to get just a season at a time.  Now I have to transport to Planet Zemar.  C-ya.

,asdasd123123,2008-06-12T13:28Z,"Been downloading for two weeks, at amazing 6-30kb/s download speeds. -_-
How can it have a ratio of 35 anyway?

People need to reduce their upload capping, this is ridiculous."
[T],Ametz,2008-07-22T02:35Z,"asdasd123123
No one have said that you need to download this one, if it is to big for you, then find smaller parts and shut the fuck up.. Its alot easier if everything is complete, instead of being forced to miss some episodes because you cant find it.. So no whining pls, if you dont like it, well then don't download it, as simple as that.."
,tribalwar,2008-08-29T14:29Z,"season 5 is crappy quality. where the hell can I get a better copy?
