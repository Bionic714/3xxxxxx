She was one of the most intelligent, diabolical, dangerous people on earth. If anyone was capable of taking down the NWO it was her. They are now targeting the ""trio of enlightenment"" (Lohan, Spears, Hilton), as they are known in underground circles."

Video, and especially sound quality are bad."

,mmmandie,2008-01-13T20:01Z,"Is anyone else having a hard time downloading this?  It's very strange.  I have to keep force starting it.  Every couple of minutes I either get a torrent error warning and it stops activity (then I do the forced start) or I get bumped from my internet connection and have to reconnect.

I am downloading some other torrents without any problems and I keep running spyware and virus scanners but this one is still causing me a problem.  It is making me paranoid but I am stubborn and determinded to download this.

Anyone else having a problem?"
