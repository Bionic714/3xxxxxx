Havent found one for cd2 yet that I like tho."
,muon,2008-01-26T00:54Z,"The subtitles from:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3615931/02.09.07.Curse.Of.The.Golden.Flower.DVDRip.XviD-NeDiVx

WORK with this release.

Make sure the .idx & .sub files are in the SAME Folder as the .avi files. 

NOTE: subtitles will not display unless BOTH .idx & .sub are used {I learned this the hard way!}

[You need VobSub to be installed. VobSub of course is included in K-Lite Codec Pack]

First time you play this it will show Chinese subtitles, but if you want one of the other languages [English, Malay, Indonesian] then Right-Click the green arrow (VobSub icon in the SysTray) and then select your choice.

 :)  and of course if you like it do the right thing  :) "
