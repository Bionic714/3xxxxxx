No Stress - Reflections

Sheer cinematic genius, a glorious moving gallery of photography by David Fortney. A spectacular and often breathtaking marriage of film and music. There simply is no one alive with a better eye for the beauty of nature. "Reflections" is a stunning visual journey of the American continent. Music by Grieg, Mussorgsky, Mendelssohn and Ravel.
