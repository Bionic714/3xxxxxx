,daveshelper,2007-12-15T05:04Z,"More of the TEFL video course:

http://thepiratebay.org/user/daveshelper/

This video course is much better than the Live class offered by TEFLINTERNATIONAL.

Thanks to Dave Hopkins for lending the DVD's.

Without his help this posting of the course would not be possible."
,daveshelper,2007-12-17T09:49Z,"NOTE: Teaching Grammar Scott Thornbury disk 16 and disk 17 are NOT the same.

There are 2 sessions of this Lesson."
,daveshelper,2007-12-19T05:29Z,"Available for download via email:

ONE ONLY per person...

Disk 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, OR 24 (more soon)

These can be forwarded to Gmail (email) only.

Each file is split into parts small enough to send by gmail.  

Suggest using Firefox browser with Gspace plugin.  Makes downloading/uploading a long list of files with single click.

send request to: thenave.dave@gmail.com"
,fatbird,2007-12-21T01:47Z,"The following files available through gmail:

01
02
04
05
06
07
08
09
textbook
workbook

Same as above - sent through GSpace in files approx 9meg, split using GSplit, with an *.exe that will recompile them when all finished dowloading.

enquiriesTEFL@googlemail.com

As suggested to me by davethenave, I've set up some accounts just to keep these files in, then I can easily send them to others, or download them to any computer with Internet access! Works for me!! (you'll need 3 accounts if this is what you want to do, too!!)

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.

,daveshelper,2008-01-06T03:43Z,"Thank you:

All who  seed this series of 25 disk. It's a long list and large files.

I'm asking your help. 

Please... After you complete a download Leave it to seed until a couple more people can take your place.

I've tried off and on for more than a year to make this teaching course available.

This is my last run. 

I'll be off the net in a couple of weeks. 

It's up to you whether these torrents live or die."
,daveshelper,2008-04-14T04:24Z,"BEFORE you put down money for any TEFL / TESOL course take 3 minutes to download and read:

How did you find these files?
