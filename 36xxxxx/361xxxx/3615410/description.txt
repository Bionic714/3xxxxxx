Grabbed this from usenet seems to be a pretty decent copy of their new album due out in march but its not quite retail quality.

1. The world was a mess but his hair was perfect
2. little superstitions
3. we danced together
4. trouble
5. suspicious eyes
6. on a mission
7. down with moonlight
8. when tom cruise cries
9. time to stop talking
10 leave the city and come home.

these guys are quality so buy tickets to see them.
