A tongue-in-cheek look at the history and future of the BSD movement. Modeled after the presentation styles of Lessig and Hardt, the talk  ... all ┬╗ provides a light-hearted introspection of the leaders, technologies, and community that forges ahead despite having been left for dead some 15 years past.

This presentation was given by Jason Dixon at the NYC BSD Conference at Columbia University on October 28, 2006.
