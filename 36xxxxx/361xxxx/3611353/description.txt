Ok, I received a copy of this CD in some very bad quality of audio encoding I had ever seen. Someone had grabbed this CD, re-encoded it to even worsened quality, and I received it afterwards. I went ahead and re-encoded it myself to 192kbps at the maximum quality possible with Lame MP3 Encoder. I had initially tried 320kbps and 256kbps, but the size of the archive would have been well over 150MB when I did so. So, even at 192kbps, maximum quality, it sounded so much better. Especially since I eliminated jittering too. It took about 20 minutes to rip all 27 tracks, but I got it up and running to sound real nice. 

This album is mainly in my opinion similar to the other mixtapes like the ones Eynce, Greenlatern, etc have made so far. It contains his two hits from "Konvicted": Smack That & I Wanna Love You, along with Open Fire with 2pac, Ghetto Remix with 2pac and Biggie, and many others. Here's the official track list.
