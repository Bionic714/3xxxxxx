I release this since i got tired of seeing bad quality releases, and with bad quality i mean releases which have lower quality than the actual dvd that's released ( which seems to be almost everything here)

I'll be seeding this for as long as i have it. Could be a couple of weeks, or maybe even months. (At least for as long as is needed to get a couple of other seeders)

Band Of Brothers All Six DVD's

All contents untouched, except for removal of the region2 "encryption"..

And since it's region 2, it's PAL.

Video Format is: 1.78:1
Sound Format is: Dolby Digital 5.1
