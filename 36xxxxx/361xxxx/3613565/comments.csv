greetings sjaantjuh"
,cetex,2007-02-08T14:37Z,"No problem, i'm glad there's more people out there who like clean releases. :)"
,Silverstrom,2007-02-08T15:10Z,Cetex you are one of them few people I know with a feeling for a good quality. I can't understand those who decrypt DVD media to a 60 percent of its  orginal size. If u send that picture to a big teve or a projector picture of 100 incehes  it certainly looks like crap. An unwatchable picture and all this because of people want to fit the dvd-9 into a one single dvd-5. It's way better to seed a original DVD-size like you do. Extra features can be removed. I don't mind. But the rest of the film I rather see untouched. If someone still want to fit in a DVD-5 they can use a program to do so. Its so easy. The most of us have a great internet connection so 1-2 GB extra doesnt takes so long. +++++ to you cetex. 
,Silverstrom,2007-02-08T15:16Z,"If you encrypt DVD to 60-70 % of its level. It's better to decrypt it to mpeg4 xvid with 192 kbs ac3 and 1800-2000 kbit/s videorate.
You get a better picture of doing so. DVD is a lossy format which is very sensitive to loosing bitrate. Xvid and Divx handles it much better but it takes a lot more time."
,ClaudiuS51,2007-02-08T17:02Z,Are you sure it has danish subs on dvd 6?

,cetex,2007-02-08T19:34Z,"So far, 5hours since i started seeding, uploaded: 100gb. :)
will probably continue like this for some time.."
,cetex,2007-02-08T21:58Z,"i'm seeding at about 10MB/s, and there's ~70leechers.. so it's not broken, thepiratebay's statistics are broken though.."
,ClaudiuS51,2007-02-08T22:35Z,I still miss a clear answer: Does that count for DVD6 as well?
,cetex,2007-02-08T23:03Z,"i've checked and the languages available are:
english 
french 
deutsch 
espanol 
nederlands"
,cetex,2007-02-09T14:06Z,"And it's only Disc6 that's with fewer languages.
24hours have passed now and i've uploaded: 357GB."
,cetex,2007-02-11T13:48Z,"3days (72hours) have passed, uploaded: 1718GB (Ratio ~48)
I think i'll continue until i've got a ratio at 100."
,persille,2007-02-11T22:27Z,In DVD 6 the VTS_02_2.VOB is missing..........
,cetex,2007-02-13T22:30Z,"Oh, i'm sorry. I'm gonna fix that as soon as i have possibility to. Probably tomorrow (Wednesday february 14th)"
,cetex,2007-02-15T13:09Z,"Heres the missing File:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3618843/Band_Of_Brothers_Uncrippled_Only_Decrypted_Disc6_And_Missing_VOB

And i've also made a completely new Disc6 in the same torrent.
So the contents are both a Disc6 ISO and the VTS_02_2.VOB

Just select the one you need for download.

And of course i'll also seed this until i've seeded it to a ratio of 100. (if people are interested in it)

/cetex"
,cetex,2007-02-17T13:48Z,"There. I've seeded 3.56TB now. (3560gb)
So i'll stop seeding now.
At the moment there's 6 Seeders and 108 Leechers.

Everyone who downloads this from now on, _PLEASE_ seed to a ratio of at least slightly above 1.0, If you want the torrent to stay alive and be in good health, seed it to a ratio of 2.5.

/cetex"
,Spix76,2007-02-20T10:57Z,"Need some help here...   How do I get a 5,5GB ISO to fit on a 4,5GB DVD...   I´m using NERO and IMGBurn...   Thnx..."

,BluesTraveler,2009-03-10T01:32Z,"It looks like this was a pretty well established torrent at one point. If folks will reseed, hold the seed out there till I hit 20:1. PLEEEASE SEED!"
