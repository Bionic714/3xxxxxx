,Peter Suleimey,2007-03-07T18:07Z,"On the movie the guy continuesly says ""Ciao matteo"" which means ""Hi Matteo"", Matteo appearantly is a boy's name. Nice little gift. The teacher is talking to her pupils about her political views, she says that she is conservative. When asked in Italian media, why she had a thong (string panties) she commented that it was elegant and classy, just like her :-D
No woman alive (unless actually numb in the back side) could let such advances from all the boys go on without her reacting to it. She is lying and she's not the first. I also wish I had her as a teacher :-D Nice!"
