,cub91,2007-03-03T23:41Z,n00b-question: how do I make these episodes into a dvd?
,nemuitomato,2007-03-09T13:29Z,"UMe2 ---> Great set of DVD's thanks a bunch. They all play on my 5,000yen DIVX DVD player too! When's #9 going to be upped?

cub91 ---> If you want to make a DVD with menus and all that you'll need a DVD Authoring program... Otherwise just burn the files as-is onto a normal DVD and playthem in a DIVX compatable DVD player. You can find them online (e-bay, Hong Kong exporters) or in stores that deal with imported movies (like goasia).

,UMe2,2007-03-09T23:07Z,"AAAARGGHH!! Bad news everyone!

My beloved provider (THE biggest and most expensive provider in germany) screwed up and pulled the plug. Here's the story: In october'06 I moved to a new town because my employer asked me to by waving with a packet of money (who could resist?).  The first thing I did there was to apply for DSL (anyone can life without?) A kind of exceptional request, because it took almost two month, about 15 calls at the service hotline and lots of nerves of steel to connect my new home. But some evil person forgot to register that line in my customer account, so no bill was sent out to me. About four weeks ago some even more evil person noticed that unregistered line, got confused and pulled the plug. And now everyone is too confused to put it back in. I'm still calling my new friends at the service hotline at regular intervals, but I don't know how long it will take - but the missing DVDs will come - in a few days, maybe weeks, maybe months. I don't know. Please hang on and keep seeding DVD 01-08 until my server is back :-( I'll keep you informed. Have fun watching DVD 01-08."
,ffmdrazil,2007-03-10T08:20Z,Thanks for the update. Alles ist klar.
,nemuitomato,2007-03-10T14:18Z,Yep! Thanks for the update! Sounds like your in customer service hell. Good luck with getting all that sorted out.

,woodpusher69,2007-04-30T02:49Z,Until UMe2 comes back try my MST3K DVD's. Playable in all DIVX players with higher resolution. ...and they tried to kill him with a forklift!
