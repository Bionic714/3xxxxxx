I checked this archive was ok before seeding so hopefully should be error free."

**Install**:
-Copy all FOLDERS to memory card (in root)
-Run TomTom (either starts automatically or do it manual) [Use file manager to launch tomtom\TomTom MOBILE.exe]
-Close the program (by selecting 'manual activation' and thereafter 'cancel')
-Copy 'TomTom MOBILE.exe' from the 'Crack' folder to 'tomtom' folder and overwrite.
-DONE!"

mrmond1 tomtom 6 isn't comaptible on all WM2003SE devices, v 5 has a better compatibillity with WM2003SE"
,JoltIsTheSh1t,2008-01-18T23:23Z,haha the reason it doesnt work on your touchscreen htc is becuause you have a POCKET PC not a smartphone. all you need to do is download the pocket pc version.
,JoltIsTheSh1t,2008-01-18T23:26Z,sorry about that i commented on the wrong post XD my bad.
