,domigus,2007-02-10T17:02Z,No sample clip.....
,Bzzzt,2007-02-10T17:21Z,"This is bullshit. We're stuck at 0,3%, and the guy is offline 30 minutes after uplodaing the torrent.

Hoax."
,jammer699669,2007-02-10T18:18Z,"No I am not offline. It could be a problem with the tracker. I tend to seed for about a month at least


Jammer"
,papermana4,2007-02-10T20:48Z,"I have the same problem, it has jammed up at 2.7% HELP. This is the 2nd version of this film I have tried to download, the other one I cannot get to play. Perhaps sometime someone will get it right."
,Nathan_,2007-02-10T22:02Z,"Is this being super seeded or can you superseed? How is the audio quality, is the audio from the DVD or is it from that theater audio release? Thanks."
,backups,2007-02-10T22:16Z,Hey jammer what about audio quality? thanx for ur upload...
,jammer699669,2007-02-10T22:34Z,"The Audio seems to be quite good. I don't know what the problem is with the seeding because I am fully connected. What I would like to point out is that if even seeds at a low speed It will make it faster for everyone. I tend to seed a new torrent for about 1 month.

PS the only reason I included www.TrueLiars.com is because it is an intertesting site that is detined to grow
Plus I have a warped sense of humor

Jammer
Look for more releae in the future
for speed I use Torrent-Damge.net ( private tracker)"
,jammer699669,2007-02-10T22:40Z,"More on the AUDIO , it is ripped from a R5 DVD rip so the sound is good and not a theatre sound track. As well it is a NERO MP4(codec) so the best player will be Nero Showtime ( if you look around a bit you should be able to find the latest Nero PKGs 

Jammer"
,Nathan_,2007-02-10T23:31Z,The R5 DVD rip currently floating around out there does have theater audio dubbed over it. It had perfect video though.
,crimescene,2007-02-11T18:47Z,PLEASE SEED!!
,crimescene,2007-02-12T00:37Z,please seed to 100%
,PinkSpider,2007-02-12T11:20Z,"This sounds good, thanks for seeding, getting 170-240kb/s -- I'll help out when it's completed."
,PinkSpider,2007-02-12T11:32Z,Up to 1.2mb/s now
,BanZa,2007-02-12T16:03Z,"Damn. I got jammed up at 64%. Well, I'll be pacient and see what happens."
,BanZa,2007-02-12T16:07Z,Great! Working again :)
,PinkSpider,2007-02-12T18:55Z,"17kb/s and at 70.8%

,GOOFYDUDE,2007-02-13T06:54Z,"the picture quality is good, but the sound quality for me is horrible, but thanks for the upload"
,backups,2007-02-13T08:28Z,"hey jamm thanx for the upload, sadly it has mono audio"
,PinkSpider,2007-02-13T10:39Z,"Sound fix:

Yes the sound was a bit crazy at times but I changed it to ""Large Hall"" in VLC Player and it sounds great :)

Go to Audio > Equilizer > Large Hall

Much better than the original settings."
,prabhuit,2007-02-13T15:31Z,"audio is crap..try this..
