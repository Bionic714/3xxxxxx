,Mick Jagger,2007-02-11T03:20Z,"Me too, I've been using it since... 1998. but having said that, I'm not quite sure what 'Win98Final2k7', might be, how it is different from plain old win98, and why someone would need it?

Can  anyone shed some light on the matter?
Thanks"
,Mick Jagger,2007-02-11T03:22Z,"Here's a bit more thoughts on the matter.
Why use Win 98, in 2007?
Try installing it on a modern p4, or dual or quad core processor.

Talk about fast!"
