Did you happen to notice the big ol'  "".CAM."" portion of this torrent name? The poster is being honest and trying to give you as much information as possible in a small amount of space. Unfortunately, there isn't a dictionary for some of the terms used for torrents but you should get a clue before you criticize....especially since it costs you nothing! Spend more time studying the different torrent formats. 

This movie is new in the theaters and it's no surprise that this is a CAM. As time goes by, you will find better and better quality torrents on the web. One big clue is the size of the torrent download. If it's less than 1gig, chances are the quality will not be great (although many are very good). If you want top quality pic & sound, wait for the DVDR torrents which are typically 4gig or larger. In the meantime, quit yer' bitchin' and learn something about what you're talking about.

Thank you for this sneak preview kollll!"
