Syn this is the synthesist David T. Dewdney. In 2002, he had impressed me with the publication of his first opus Soundwave Traveller, classified 5th best New Age EM title of the year. At the time of an interview, he mentioned to possess more than 70 hours of recordings. The Glass Bridge did therefore leaves this gigantic musical bank that rests in the intrants of his creativity.
After an intro very floating, where the synthetic strates multiply themselves in softnesson of frugal laments, The Glass Bridge Parts I-III animates itself towards the final minute with a curled sequencer that recalls strangely the analogous dialect of Jean-Michel Jarre on Equinoxe. Piercing the rhythm progresses on of beautiful ones put to bed syntheticmellotron's, atmospheric percussions and a synthé blowing silky synthetic agreementsand sharp, in the even grinds that Jean-Michel Jarre on Magnetic Fields did. Shadowfall is a long title floating and very atmospheric. A crossroads between Meddle of Pink Floyd and Music for Airports of Brian Eno. Long, floating and very very touchy. Heart of Orion is a long tiraillement between the dense atmospheres and musical brightnesses that arise here and there, without really to taking form.
Syn's Glass Bridge, well.. is a personal opus. The creation kind that some says long on the character of an artist? Syn did big things, notably all from the beginning. For a reason that I am unaware of, the personage became bigger than its fans, than the music itself. This is an opus to the unfinished atmospheres. A title that should have remained in the the bank of Mr Dewdney. This squarely the production kind that did the delights of the journalists, and columnists, that would want to fall to shortened arm on the MÉ to disparage that this is cultural masturbation. Abstracted art. I do not like negativism, but with The Glass Bridge, Syn uses the reheated that already outfitted, fully and with more of originality, of others ta
