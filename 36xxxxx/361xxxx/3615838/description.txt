Synopsis: Whether you're large or small, a little kindness goes a long way. So join Winnie the Pooh and the Hundred Acre Wood gang as they discover why getting along helps make the world go round. Let your imagination take flight as you team up with Pooh and his pals in four tales of adventure. Watch Piglet realize that even a very small animal can have a huge heart, and find out why a Tigger without stripes on the outside is still a Tigger on the inside. Through story and song, you'll learn how honesty, helping friends, respecting others, and trusting in yourself can solve even the biggest little challenges. It's just one more way that Pooh makes growing up fun!
