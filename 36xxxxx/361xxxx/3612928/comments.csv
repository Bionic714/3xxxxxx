,astralmeadow,2007-02-07T16:32Z,"Pentagram was formed in ?stanbul in 1986 by guitarist Hakan Utangaç and drummer Cenk Ünnü. By 1987, bassist Tarkan Gözübüyük had joined and they started doing live shows. Their first release came in 1990, with their self-titled Pentagram album. By 1992, a second guitarist Demir Demirkan and vocalist Ogün Sanl?soy were added to the line-up. They released their sophomore album Trail Blazer in the same year and enjoyed a now rapidly-growing fanbase - both in Turkey and worldwide. In 1993, while he served in the Turkish Army, the first guitarist of the band Ümit Y?lbar was killed in a battle with terrorists on Mountain C?raf.

For the next three years, they toured in their homeland and abroad. In 1995, vocalist Murat ?lkan replaced Ogün, and they started working on their next album, Anatolia. Anatolia was released in Turkey in 1997, and several weeks after the release, Century Media approached Pentagram for a worldwide release.

They released a live album in 1998 called Popçular D??ar? (literally Pop musicians out). Guitarist Demir Demirkan departed, and was temporarily replaced with Onur ""Mr. Cat"" Pamukçu.

They started recording their next album in 2000 in their own studio in Istanbul. Guitarist Metin Türkcan officially joined the band during the recording session. They composed 17 songs, and decided to split it up into two different CDs. In 2001, Unspoken was released worldwide. Bir (One) was released in Turkey only in 2002.

For their releases in Turkey, they use the name Pentagram. However, due to an American doom metal band called Pentagram, they go by the name Mezarkabul (literally Acceptance To Grave) for international releases."
