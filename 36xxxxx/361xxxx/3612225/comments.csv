,styret,2007-02-06T17:31Z,Thanks
,RipperSeregon,2007-02-08T16:17Z,"When downloaded, please seed!"
,vandal109,2007-02-09T00:13Z,"Great upload, so I hate to complain, but I have been stuck for a while at 24% with no seeders"
,RipperSeregon,2007-02-09T18:22Z,"I am seeding, but it seems like I'm the only one seeding too. So it's going a bit slow. Unfortunately.. :( I have turned off all other uploads, so all my ul speed is on this torrent."
,RipperSeregon,2007-02-09T18:23Z,"And of one or other reason, it seems like everyone is stuck at 24.7%.. :|"
,Prog Snob,2007-02-09T23:02Z,tsk tsk tsk
,ektakrome,2007-02-11T03:03Z,"Now we're all stuck at 44% last night i saw 1 person seeding. What happened to Borgis, he's the one who started this...where did he go?"
,hellfog,2007-02-11T19:54Z,"Jepp same for me, stuck at 44%"
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-12T11:24Z,"The same here.
Sometimes I can see a seeder but he keeps going online and offline. 
Borgis, please,  let someone download the whole iso before leaving."
,wagen666,2007-02-13T18:18Z,"Yep already stuck for 1 week. Ratio 3,227 and download of 44%"
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-13T19:08Z,"WTF, please seeders, whare are you???"
,ektakrome,2007-02-14T07:31Z,"Yeah I saw that seeder person too, the asshole only will stay online for a minute or two. What kind of person does that, when they know there is a ton of us with much help needed."
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-14T08:43Z,The problem is that I can't see him anymore since 2 or 3 days... at the beginning he went online and offline but percentual went from 22% to 44%... 2 or 3 days online would be enough to have more seeders... please seed file again
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-16T13:06Z,yuuu anybody alive? borgis? RipperSeregon? why don't you answer to PMs?
,kawmic,2007-02-16T15:59Z,Could you seed please?? All are stuck at 45%!
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-16T18:01Z,If someone else is a member of Dream Theater Fanclub and received Romavarium DOD please make another torrent and seed it! Pleeease
,hellfog,2007-02-16T19:14Z,"I haven?t received the fan club DVD 2006 yet, but I have 2005 Fan club DVD, if some one doesn?t have it, and wants it. "
,kjelleper,2007-02-18T02:29Z,Nice one! Thank you very much! I would have loved to se the '05 DVD as well! :-) Keep the dream alive!
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-18T11:00Z,"hellfog, when you'll receive 2006 dvd could you make a torrent and seed it please? People who already received it say it's awesome! And this is dead...
I already have 2005 dvd and it's good too.
Thanx a lot!"
,kjelleper,2007-02-18T13:46Z,Can somone please re-post this DVD? And can somone also post the 2005 DVD? Hellfog or dr. fix...  Thanks in advance!
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-18T18:40Z,I can't stay connected to internet for seeding so it's better I don't make releases if I cannot let people download it.. I also have a low upload speed... but if soumeone has romavarium and a fast conenction please make a torrent ;)
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-20T11:47Z,"I found this file on the mule, but I don't know if it's complete or a torrent part... "
,RipperSeregon,2007-02-24T12:01Z,"Ok. I'm trying again. I'm seeding at full speed, and I hope ppl can get past 47.8%! Sorry everyone! I'll keep it seeding for a couple of weeks now :)"
,ektakrome,2007-02-25T02:30Z,"I appreciate that we finally got someone to seed it, but now we're all just stuck at 51.9% I guess this means in about a month I should finally have the whole thing."
,RipperSeregon,2007-02-25T15:19Z,"Ach.. *hate* My friend whom I'm living with keeps deleting my files on upload, and it usually takes some hours before I find out. I've told him to not delete them now. It's up and running again, and I hope we can get some finished downloads soon! ^^"
,Suspended Animation,2007-02-25T23:30Z,"I'm so happy this torrent it's working again, thank you very much RipperSeregon, really appreciate your contribution!"
,Dr.Fix,2007-02-26T11:09Z,"Really thanx a lot! I'm not home in these days, please when someone other finish seed it too :)"
,RipperSeregon,2007-02-27T14:04Z,I have uploaded the first DTFC DVD from 2005 on someones request. Enjoy! :)
,dreamrafa,2007-02-28T02:57Z,"Thank you very much RipperSeregon, but could you dedicate your upload speed to the Romavarium DVD first? its running terrible slow, and uploading another DVD at the same time will make it even slower... just an idea... thanks again"
,hellfog,2007-02-28T16:11Z,"Why is dowmload speed soooooooo slow, this is taking forever."
,kjelleper,2007-03-01T18:27Z,"Someone out there has the following fan club cd's and want to upload?

Graspop Festival 2002
