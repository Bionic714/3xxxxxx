Hello, Pirates. Bringing this album to you was a labor of love. The album has already appeared online, but it was barely listenable. Unsatisfied, I tracked down the guy who bought the album on eBay for over 1000 dollars.

Because the CD has copy protection (MSI Copy Control) on it, which we were unable to brake, we recorded it analog to the computer. Playing from a portable CD player he recorded the songs and sent the files to me uncompressed. I spent many hours on the audio to get the best possible sound and I'm pleased to say it turned out quite good.

It is a shame this album will never be released commercially, but at least the world can now hear it. Enjoy... and please seed.
