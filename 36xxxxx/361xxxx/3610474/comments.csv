,sarrip,2007-09-01T21:19Z,"Is it possible to get Eng. subt.?  Seems to be a funny question for many people, since there is the English audio, but they may be very usefull to those that can read english but have difficolties in understanding spoken english. They allow or help  to enjoy movies with their original sound. Thanks anyway for posting this great movie. Other question: is it the full dvd? If not there is a reduction of the image quality with a compression or just removals from the menu?"
