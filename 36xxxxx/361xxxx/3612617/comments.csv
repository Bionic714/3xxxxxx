,lazur-e,2007-02-07T18:16Z,"FYI - language: 

Windows Vista is multilingual, meaning you download your language pack from windows update. I downloaded vista ultimate in english about two months ago and converted it into swedish when the language packs were released. 
This will switch language in everything; menus, login screen, images with text, help, calendar - all of it. Changing language in vista is as easy as changing wallpaper!"

,tiggntampa813,2008-05-21T02:26Z,"SKREW SEEDERS!! I HAVE A BETTER WAY THEN THE PROGRAMS THEY TELL YOU TO USE TO DOWNLOAD TORRENT FIELS... USE LIMEWIRE... FOR DOWNLOADING THESE FILES.. ALOT OF PEOPLE DONT RECCOMEND USING LIMEWIRE, BUT I DO. I NEVER HAD A VIRUS FROM ANY SONG OR MOVIE. ONLY TIME I GOT A VIRUS IS WHEN I DOWNLOADED A MUSIC VIDEO FILE FOR MY IPOD TOUCH. SO I DO RECCOMEND THIS ITS SOOOO MUCH FASTER!"
,Roland19303,2008-06-03T19:11Z,"Theres way less viruses from torrents than limewire. For one theres no comments on limewire. 

Oh and did I mention that torrents are a lot fucking more effeciant?"
,Roland19303,2008-06-03T19:12Z,Limewire is for the dark ages
,malcr001,2008-06-13T20:20Z,"The only good thing about vista is that it looks pretty and they have done a good job at making it look good. Thats why I've installed a couple of  things that make xp look exactly like vista with a couple of features vista has too like the search bar where you click on start, preview window feature, 3d window flip thing and the desktop dreamscene. "
,mjui123,2008-07-08T05:29Z,"what does this do does it give you windows vista?
and limewire is faster but so far it's got alot more viruses"
