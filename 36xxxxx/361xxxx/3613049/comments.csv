  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This is the story of three gentle persons: Paul Rivers (Penn) an ailing
  mathematician lovelessly married to an English emigr? (Gainsbourg), 
  Christina Peck, an upper-middle-class suburban housewife, happily married 
  and mother of two little girls, and Jack Jordan (Del Toro), an ex-convict 
  who has found in his Christian faith the strength to raise a family. They
  will be brought together by a terrible accident that will change their 
  lives. By the final frame, none of them will be the same as they will learn 
  harsh truths about love, faith, courage, desire and guilt, and how chance 
  can change our worlds irretrievably, forever.
