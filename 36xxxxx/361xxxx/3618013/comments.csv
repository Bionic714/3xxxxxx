,Wabit,2007-02-14T11:42Z,And what makes you say that?
,_nyl_,2007-02-14T14:32Z,'cause he doesn't know any better
,Wabit,2007-02-14T14:46Z,"Exactly nyl

DVD rips = perfect quality

You cant get better than this"
,madjock56R,2007-02-14T14:59Z,"No Wabit.

You dont know what you are talking about, you have ripped 4 DVDs and resampled them to fit on 1 DVD 5.

So the audio is shit and the video bitrate is shit.

So stop talking shit.

P.S - The reason its not in the shops, is because nobody would buy the shit."
,_nyl_,2007-02-14T15:06Z,"No, i will trust these revioews from people who have actually downloaded these disk and watched them

-I just wanted to join in and say that my experience with the KDVDs has been excellent as well. Loved the American Pie Trilogy 10/10 for pic and sound and loved the menu. Great Job

-everything that i have gotten off of him has been excellent, 2 big thumbs up from me.... more ntsc please...

-I downloaded the termanator trilogy, watched and checked it out and it was perfect.

-KDVD's are ace mate

-so far, so good - i'm loving them. my stepdaughter and i just finished
the Scream Trilogy tonight. Excellent work, please continue.
Picture on those that are DVDRiP = 10/10, Sound = 10/10.
Consider the source


I think you naysayers are just bored and go around flaming others 'cause you can't encode."
,madjock56R,2007-02-14T15:11Z,"lol naysayers.

So you are saying a 4x movies with probably a bitrate of 1000 Im guessing, and audio of 192 will be the same as a 4x DVD5 with a bitrate of 4500 and DD 5.1.

Cmon you are having a laugh.

And yeah its really hard to stick a DVD in the drive use a DVD rip program.....click"
,_nyl_,2007-02-14T15:25Z,"ok, no it is not the same as a 4x DVD5 with a bitrate of 4500 and DD 5.1.

and it is a bit more than just clicking and ripping. the movie vobs are isolated and reencoded with CCE multipass using kvcd templates. it is not shrunk, or transcoded. 

up to 1o hours can be put on a disk, this one is about 6. the video is much better than kvcd because theres 50% more room to play with and also there is a bonus in keeping the resolution dvd compliant versus kvcd (352x480).

and your bitrate guess is off by more than double.

go look at kvcd.net for samples of kDvd"
,_nyl_,2007-02-14T15:39Z,"ok, i think i see the problem. this page is reporting it as 2GB, but the iso is 4.22GB. the tracker will show it correctly. that may have been why some have thier doubts"
,B-manSwe,2007-02-15T00:41Z,"Mr Wabit 
you are a jackass , dont try to tell me that you ripped 4 dvdÂ´s down to 4.23 GiB all together and still can maintain dvd-quality, then your a wizard...
This must be like a vcd-quality..."
,madjock56R,2007-02-15T03:20Z,"nyl

what are you on about ?

""dvd compliant versus kvcd (352x480)""

errm he states that the res is 1/2 DVD Resolution (352x480) which is not DVD compliant for a start.

""up to 10 hours can be put on a disk, this one is about 6""

6 hrs is still crap, more than a 2hr DVD on a DVD5 is grainy as fuck, so thats rubbish as well.

""and your bitrate guess is off by more than double.""

Considering its all relative to mb ber disk, you are saying you will have a combined bitrate for all 4 films at 8000, I dont think so you madman.
When a disk is 4.3 gig max, so the bitrate is just over 4000 at most on a dvd and thats with dolby 2, why do you think groups release 3500 bitrate and add 700 mb ish for 5.1.....

You really are clueless, but enjoy anyway mate, we know what we are talking about..



"
,Wabit,2007-02-15T15:17Z,"Why dont you just download it and see what the quality is like.

The if you dont like it dont but im sure theres plenty out there who will enjoy it

ffs no-one is making you download it ive posted loads of these kind of KDVD's and had so many good reviews thats why i decided to share it with everyone on here"
,madjock56R,2007-02-15T15:23Z,"Fair point.

But what does piss people off, is people like yourself saying something is, what it isnt.

As in

""Amaze your friends when you tell them you own this""

""DVD rips = perfect quality""

ffs stop talking crap.

,_nyl_,2007-02-15T22:56Z,"you can fit over 6 cd-r per dvdr, so this would be like putting 3 2-cd svcd on a dvdr, but compliant (1/2dvd is compliant). and svcd video can be just as good as dvd if done right."
,madjock56R,2007-02-16T14:35Z,"nyl

DVDs are only pence now, thats why nobody uses SVCD anymore.

The point you still seem to be missing is, if the movie is worth getting its worth getting with 5.1 sound and a good bitrate.

Maybe not these slapstick crap comedys, but if you think The Terminator films, would not be better with a higher bitrate and 5.1 or DTS sound, then enjoy....."
,_nyl_,2007-02-16T20:19Z,"of course a retail with 5.1 is superior. but svcd if made from dvd can be very close to the same video, and a dvdr has the same diskspace (approx) as 6 cdr. so there is no reason the quality cannot be about the same as svcd.

The point you still seem to be missing is:

-people like these BECAUSE they have all the movies on one disk (this is a good thing, if you want 4MB/s and 5.1, go rent/buy it). It's a good thing, not a bad thing. Get it!?! 

-they are dvd compliant and WILL play in your standalone (some player will not play avi/vcd/etc...)

-they quality is far from shit, these basically look like svcd, and if done right they are very not at all blocky or shitty.

i just do not understand, again, why people who have not seen this release or even another kdvd are so certain it sucks. try it out or not, but your comments so far were simply not fair."
,madjock56R,2007-02-16T21:27Z,"I think we have said far to much on the matter but...

I know what an SVCD looks like you daft bugger, its not a case of not knowing that an SVCD is watchable.

You need to get with the times, if its bandwidth you are worried about, download 700mb Xvids of the Scary Movies, and watch them on a Divx Compatible DVD Player, get with the times mate, SVCD is so old its unreal, and KVCD or whatever is just for stuck in the old days numptys.

""If you want 4MB/s and 5.1, go rent/buy it""

No you download it.....if you search Im sure you will be able to download DVDs of these crappy convertions.

But an SVCD type quality version of a Terminator film is a fucking joke. Be it on a DVD or not.

You seem to be confusing what can be done, as in stick 6 disks on a DVD as some type of new thing, thats what we all used to do, till blank DVDs became so cheap, and bandwidth so fast.

I suppose you have heard of DVD9s, you can download those DVDs as well now, and amazingly buy DVD9 blanks.

Enjoy your Walkman Cassette, tell me when you get out of your cave. :)"
,_nyl_,2007-02-16T22:30Z,"ok, you win, in the future i will make sure i only upload and download whatefer you think is ok. will this be enough for you?

i was nice and did not get personal or rude or such. some people just prefer to have threir media in another format. that this gets your goat amuses me, tbh. 

impress me and resist the urge to send more profanity my way."
