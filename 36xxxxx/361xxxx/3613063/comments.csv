I tried it with vlc player but it doesn't work...

thanks"
[T],Knaster,2007-02-09T02:54Z,pippi put the sub file in the same directory as the movie and name the subfile exactly like the movie then start movie with vlc and choose your subs!
,divac,2007-02-10T00:31Z,"yeah, but those subs are not good ;
use these instead :
