,THEBOYNORM,2007-02-06T13:23Z,HOW DO YOU SEED?
,harm82,2007-02-06T13:37Z,well just started to leech it so i'm hoping there will be 100% ;)
,Thany,2007-02-06T13:43Z,"I hope so :).
Now we're at 78%..."
,dB145,2007-02-06T13:48Z,"i Think it is extremely well done to start a torrent at 9 o'clock, and stop seeding 2 hours later!
As soon as I am finished, I will at least seed during the night. (10Mbit, after 4 PM)
I hope it will get that far that I can start seeding!"
,harm82,2007-02-06T13:55Z,"i'm on 89,7% and leeching in 10 kb/s now uploading in 600 and will atleast seed untill tomorrow"
