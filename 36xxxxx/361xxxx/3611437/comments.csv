,MovieDork,2009-12-31T09:25Z,"I'm really disappointed in this rip. I just watched ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and this version is a full 13+ minutes shorter than the original.

The version you get here is slightly over an hour long (65 minutes or so). The movie should be 78 minutes long (1hour, 18 minutes)

What the hell is up with that??!?!?!?!?!?!!?"
