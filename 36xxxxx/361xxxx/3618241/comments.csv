,freestyler6,2008-08-17T00:04Z,"hello,
i have a speed problem when i play sonic. it looks like the whole game is 5 or 10 times faster than the normal speed.
nobody seems to have this problem on the net (i searched google).
i'm running XP service pack 3 with dx9 and a nvidia 6600gt
i tried this : enable vsync and force refresh rate to 60hz. the game was only 2-3 times faster.
how can i have the normal speed ?
thanks in advance."
,freestyler6,2008-08-25T01:15Z,"looks like the problem solved itself (?)
thanks again for the game"

,LorenzoTheComic,2011-05-09T05:49Z,"Ah, nostalgia as I listen to the Sonic CD music, and check out the icons and wallpapers, etc... takes me back to 2003 when I had a collection Sonic games on my PC. About the Sonic 3 PC games running too fast, you probably have to run it in full screen so the frame rate goes back to normal."
