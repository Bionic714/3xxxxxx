,MorfDK,2007-03-21T01:35Z,"Why do you sweds allways bitch about the subs.(no swedish subs.) You are aware that 85% of the users on TPB isn't swedish, right!? If only swedish people came here, the only thing you could find in here would be Pippi movies and ABBA music. And even dough that might sound all good and sweet to you, that would be like an torrent from hell to the rest of the world. So pretty please, with a cherry on top.. Shut the fuck up and learn english!"
,Zarkx,2007-03-24T02:22Z,"MorfDK: People has asked for subs in general and not specifically Swedish sub. So what are you whining about?
By the way, learn some English please. You spell as a Danish.
Danskjävel!"
,Zarkx,2007-03-24T02:31Z,And by the way. If people write better descriptions of what they upload there would not have been so many questions about the contents.
