This is the easiest way to create a wow private server. THIS ONLY WORKS ON WOW 1.12.x VERSIONS! Ill try to find a stable TBC Emu but its very rare.

You can find the GM commands here: http://thegoldenknights.forumcircle.com/viewtopic.php?t=6&sid=fc5fb0f23cc57a2821379c15160c61e3


Try and upload it as much you can. I have a small bandwith.

System Requirements
:

Minimun:
800+ MHz
256 Ram
Windows Server 2003

Recomended:
2 GHz
1 GB Ram
Windows XP

(No special video or sound card is needed for the server)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instalation:



1. Install ManGOS Platinum

2. Go to mangos server folder and copy the file called ad.exe to your wow root folder (for example C:Program filesWorld of warcraft). Then make a folder called "maps" inside the WoW root folder.

3. Run ad.exe

4. When ad.exe has finished, cut the folder "maps" and paste it into the Mangos server folder.

5. Run Mangos.exe, and click on "start-SQL". Two web pages will pop up. If they are showed without any problem, then the Mysql server is completely opened.

6. Once the Mysql server is opened, go to Mangos.exe again and click on "Start Realmd" and "Start MangosDB". It will take up a minute more or less (depending on your PC) to completely load.

7. Go to your WoW folder, and open the file called realmlist.wtf with notepad. Change the us.login..... to 127.0.0.1 . Save and cose the file.

8. Open Wow and play!


Note 1: Be sure you dont have Skype open! This program makes the SQL database (run.bat) unable to run correctly.

Note 2: Be sure you dont have any MySQL or Apache running when you run start.bat! Close down your current MySQL server if you have one running (uninstall is not required, just close it - Use: ctrl+alt+del, and find process "mysql-nt" and close it.. Also close "Apache" if any of those are running.)

Note 3: To make sure that start.bat is loaded successfully, a webpage comes up. When it comes up, wait 5 seconds, and then refresh it. If the page cannot be accessed or showed anymore, you have something that blocks for mysql to start! If it comes up with the exact same page again, loading was a success and you can go on.
