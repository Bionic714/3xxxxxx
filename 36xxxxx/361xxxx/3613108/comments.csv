,Wieeeeeee,2008-07-12T13:58Z,"To all who are interested in this: use your head.  In case you believe anything that is said, you should get your head checked.  It's another ""feel good"" method that is just a cover-up for obtaining your money.  This is the first torrent where I will never buy the original copy for.  I only buy things made with quality and for a sane reason, not with the clear intention to take the money out of your pocket.

I seed this forever so neither me nor you have to waste money on lies/crap like this."
