,master breeze,2007-02-14T18:34Z,in that case you are the first in the world to have a working crack for vista.

,spectral2k,2007-02-14T18:47Z,I haven't tried it because I dont have Vista yet but I did scan this with the latest Nod32 and it was reported clean.
,kkkao,2007-02-14T18:49Z,is this one of those time stopper crack or its the real thing that lets you activate?
,kkkao,2007-02-14T18:51Z,this is just a time crack
,glazenwassertjuh,2007-02-14T19:18Z,"its fuckingworking!! vista is validate

then you can use the valida patch 
only"
,davidstjohn1,2007-02-14T21:34Z,"Very good job clony_patcher , And for anybody doubting his work, I am saying absolutly no viruses or anything wrong with this and works perfect NICE!!!"
,woofy007,2007-02-14T22:04Z,The only thing for me is explorer will not work..so i am not sure if validation is working..any suggestions? time crack works fine..does it matter if it is a retail version?
,Pilgrimen,2007-02-14T22:15Z,"I am really confused.
Some of you are saying this works but in my case both windows defender and mcafee antivirus 2007 stopped working.
For Me it is obvious it is VIRUS

Still no working crack for vista"
,numba107,2007-02-14T22:24Z,"everything worked smoothly but im still hesitant to download the updates cause i had to reinstall vista about 5 times and its really frustratin, anybody tried the update which stops the time stopper yet??"
,clony_patcher,2007-02-14T22:46Z,"@ Pilgrimen 

No virus...I think that are false positive caused by my compiler.

@numba107 

If you installed without key you can update."

,Vashx22,2007-02-14T23:39Z,QmAn Thank you for saying that or it would of not passed my mind and it would of been another vista for a day and back to xp AGAIN..... so ty... so i ask like QmAn is it for retail also?
,yamahafox,2007-02-15T03:44Z,well i ran this and everything seemed to work and it said validated on the website now i just have to wait and see oh if you already did the 2099 time stop just run the check to make sure if you get the 4300 min the just run the validation and you should be good
,piratbayd,2007-02-15T05:54Z,"I'd previously installed the automated batch-install TimerStop crack on Keznews dated 10.2.2007. It failed on my x64 Vista Ultimate installation - the timer ticked on for 4 days.

This CLoNY package consists of 3 exes: crack, validate & check. ""Crack"" cracks, reboots, then verifies itself on first re-log-on. ""Validate"" takes you to M$ where you (may if you're a gambler) download/install Genuine Advantage and ""activate"" the Vista installation - it (appears to have) worked. Finally, ""check"" runs the Vista check routine and indicates you've an activated Vista installation. Simply amazing... I hope it lasts."
,numba107,2007-02-15T06:32Z,iz there a difference between the regular vista and the RTM vista
,Vashx22,2007-02-15T06:47Z,I just could not wait SO i installed the retail version on windows vista AND CRACK WORKED OMG I AM SO HAPPY I DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT WINDOWS XP BACK ON YES THIS MARKES THE DAY I DID NOT HAVE TO REFORMAT BACK TO XP!!!! TY COLONY_PATCHER TY YOU ARE THE BEST
,yamahafox,2007-02-15T07:06Z,"ok here is a little tip if you did the 2099 time stop then follow these steps:
1. Download the the file

2. unzip the .rar file (via winzip)

3. once you unzip the files just run the Check Utility and when you run this in a moment you will get a pop-up and at the bottom you will see 4300 mins (if you see this continue)

4. Run the Validation Utility and if all goes as planned you will see the Validation Completed on the web.


Now if you have NOT done the 2099 time stop then follow these steps:

1. install you windows vista and DO NOT ENTER A KEY (use any format you wish:ultimate,home basic etc.)

2. once installed (i recommend NOT running any updates) run the Crack file.  You should see a command prompt style page come up and will say now installing.

3. Once that is done you will see a pop-up and it will prompt you to RESTART! DO IT!!!

4. Once you have restarted your computer you want to run the Check Utility and you will then see a pop-up and at the bottom it will say 4300 mins. close this out

5. Now finally run the Validation it will take you to a web site and if all goes well you will see Validation Complete!!!"

I download this crack, installed, and it worked great! It said 30 days for a couple days... BUT

I noticed the time was wrong, so I set it back. Now it says I have 29 days left! Please help! If I install this, does it mean I can't have the correct time?"
,yamahafox,2007-02-16T06:54Z,well the time will depend on whether you did the crack right after you installed vista on the computer thats all no big deal so go ahead and do it again you will be fine
,davidstjohn1,2007-02-16T22:12Z,Just wanted to update you clony... I did download your patch and it works perfect I installed vista ultimate x64 ran the patch according to your instructions and two days running and it is still at the 30 days mark. Thanks so much for the patch. I didnt have the money to buy vista and this was the answer.... Thanks again...

I did the 2099 time stop over 2 days ago now, but today my Windows says ""29 days left.."" - so I downloaded this thinking ""well I might as well, as iv only got 4 weeks of usage left"" - but is it normal for the timer to count down a bit and then it stops?

Anyway, I followed the steps here and Microsoft validated my copy online, does this mean my copy isn't gonna continue count down to zero?

Thanks"
,yamahafox,2007-02-23T22:40Z,"@ danm003

Well if you did everything correctly and if you ran the check  and you got the pop up that said 43200 mins left and you did the activation everything should be fine
Now for you doing the 2099 activation yourself you have screwwed something up cause it should start and stop again did you run the crack from Clony? if not i would say restore to a point before you did the 2099 and then run everything from Clony and see what happends"

i've scanned it with avg antispyware and avg antivirus 100% virus free "
,danm003,2007-02-24T01:27Z,"@yahamafox

I initially installed Vista and didn't know about this crack; I had done the 2099 BIOS change as way of stopping activation check - Then when I noticed it had changed from 30 days to 29 days I thought it'd fuckedup? 

Anyway, when I noticed that I immediately searched for a crack.. found this and followed the instructions.. I did it, got the 43,000 minutes thing up, Microsoft validated it online, should it be ok?

What if it keeps counting down, 28 days.. etc? It hasn't changed as I expected it to now (its 12.22am now..) so just wait and see?"
,yamahafox,2007-02-25T00:56Z,well i did the 2099 trick before i did this and when i did it i didnt go into the bios i just did it through command prompt with the rearm but if you did the vaildation and it was ok you should be too i would just keep a eye on the days and see what happends just keep an update and let us know if anything happens

It's down to 28 days.. hmm!"
,yamahafox,2007-02-25T02:18Z,"ok man bad news now what i would do is go and do a system restore and get it back to before you did anything cause it sounds like something you did went wrong and it didnt activate the time stop so if you can get it back to day one with the vista 

then you need to try running the Crack from Clony again and then the check to make sure that everything went through and then see what happens"
,danm003,2007-02-25T03:25Z,"Well soon as I installed Vista I got loads of updates from Microsoft.. that's bad I think..

I am thinking just install again and do the crack?"
,yamahafox,2007-02-25T03:31Z,yea if you did the installs there was one about the activation and you shouldnt have done any updates really untill the crack was run 
,danm003,2007-02-25T06:18Z,"Aha - that's prolly what screwed me up then!

So if I do this, reinstall vista with the 2099 thing done.. then run this crack what should happen? In My Comp properties should it show that Vista has been activated and no ""29 days left"" message will appear, or..?"

For x86 windows vista (32 bit) there is a new my crack that really activate your Vista.

NO Timerstopper
NO modify your Vista bootloader!

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3631799/Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator.4st.March-CLoNY

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY' 
you can install the new one with no problem without fresh installation.

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.1-CLoNY' or
'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.2' you can use Vista Manager Pro
to rebuilt the bootloader and than you can apply the new one.

Download the software:
http://www.vistabootpro.org

Guide:
In Vista Manager Pro select 'BootLoader', select 'Reinstall the original bootloader'
and then click 'Apply'.

For x64 Windows Vista (64bit) I suggest, for now, to continue to use
'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY'

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3618299/Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY

,rs12345,2008-01-26T13:05Z,"avg is not a very good antivirus program at all. zonealarm detects nothing, neither does kasp. remember this is a crack. 
--------
can someone answer this? clony/anyone....

CAN YOU UPDATE FUTURE UPDATES WITHOUT THE COUNTER UNFREEZING AND COUNTING DOWN (for example upgrade to sp1,sp2, ect...)?  ALSO WILL THE CRACK WORK MORE THAN ONCE (when i upgrade to different service packs)?"
,rs12345,2008-01-26T13:09Z,"dotnet: also this is what you call a false positive. avg and even avast detects false positives. download trial versions of zonealarm internet security and/or kasp. they DETECT nothing.

***also need an answer on my question above, thanks!"

,Krisshoffa,2008-02-12T09:12Z,MICROSOFT AND TORRENT HATERS WANT`S TO CONFUSE US WITH SPREADING RUMERS ABOUT TROJANS AND VIRUSES IN EVERY SINGLE CRACK FOR WINDOWS VISTA. YOU HAVE TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF IF THE FILE IS INFECTED OR NOT. DONÂ´T BELIEVE THAT ALL TORRENT UPLOADERS PUT SHIT IN THEIR UPLOADS HERE - WY SHOULD THEY?
,Krisshoffa,2008-02-17T13:24Z,"THIS WORKS GREAT!!! IF ANY1 SAYS IT HAS VIRUS OR TROJAN THEY ARE MICROSOFT LOVERS OR TORRENT HATERS. IT REALLY WORKS GREAT! THANX CLONY, YOU ROCK!!!"
,some0neX,2008-02-22T19:57Z,"CAN ANY1 ANSWER THIS:
Does this work with vista SP1 (service pack 1)?"
,Genewitch,2008-03-14T20:21Z,"irc.zapchast in all three executables. Correct me if i am wrong (false positive excuse) why would all three files, which do DIFFERENT things, have the same trojan, and not just any trojan, one that installs an IRC client that allows your machine to be used as a zombie?

I'm not against MS or TPB or torrents. I am just curious.

BOTH OF THESE FILES(of the same size) ON TPB HAVE THE SAME TROJANS.

odd, two uploaders, two files, same trojans."
,rednroll,2008-04-01T17:52Z,This does not work on Vista Ultimate x64 retail.  It makes a newly installed OS corrupt and won't boot.  A new install of the OS was required to fix.
,drbits,2008-04-06T09:47Z,"The ""integrated"" antivirus (AVG, Symantec, etc.) give you Trojan messages when they recognize ""Hacker tools"". You can turn those off in Symantec. I don't know about the rest."
,drbits,2008-04-06T09:51Z,"AVG, AVAST, etc. are very good antivirus tools (among the best). This is not a false positive. They just detect something we Want to be there and think it is malware."
,wombat49,2008-05-03T15:32Z,"http://virusscan.jotti.org/
Reports numerous problems in these files, can it be trust? Some of you will say no, but are you really willing to gamble your computer on it? I'm as pro-crack as the next guy, but there's a lot of bad things on these sites."
,drow209,2008-05-07T00:44Z,webroot spy sweeper said it was a trojan... i think it just detected that it was a crack idk... plz help 
,PlateSpin,2008-06-10T18:30Z,For all you bleeting sheep out there saying this is a virus or some sort of spyware- what the hell do you think Vista is. It's one massive spyware/virus pretending to be an OS!!! And yes - this worked for me but I'm going for 100% file compression and formating my drive. Loads of space for a real OS now!! (now where is my DOS 2.1 disk)
,T-Rave,2008-09-24T00:55Z,This is FANTASTIC! Worked on x64 Ultimate. For giggles I tried an update. My system is completely updated to the newest with no issues. I did do a check again on the time to make sure it was still working and the time did decrease. I did the crack again and reset to the 30 dayz. Very nice work.
,kusho50,2008-09-24T16:01Z,"Okay.  I need help.  Serious help.  This thing fried two of my PCs.  It works GREAT if you run it PRE SP1.  DO NOT and I mean DO NOT run after SP1.  When SP1 downloads the timer will restart to count down.  (I saw someone on here that had that happen, and that's my guess for what happened, as it did to me.  I tried it on one clean install after SP1 downloaded, and another that I had patched once, that SP1 fixed and was counting down again.  Both after patch wouldn't run most programs.  Colonysoft Anydvd, Trillian, Symantec, Yahoo messenger, UTorrent would run, but wouldn't connect to anything.  After format and reinstall same symptoms.  I found that my BIOS was set to 2035 afterwords as the date, and changed that on one box, and am reattempting to install vista on it currently, but it keeps locking up during the install.  This one won't let me get into bios to change the date, as usb keyboard, and keyboard doesn't detect until AFTER the press delete to enter bios setup thing goes past.  Need to search my house and find another keyboard...

I got up and running on Ubuntu to read, and post this...  Thought to just istall that on one box for now so I don't take myself completely down, but i have 40 gig partition for os, and 200 gig partiton full of backup files, and can't get ubuntu to load on the 40 gig of free space, partition.  it wants the whole drive, and i dont want it to kill the 200 gig partition as thats where all my itunes are, downloaded stuff...  etc...

Anyway...  Anyone know if other than a date change in the bios what else I need to fix?  I say again, After SP1 with vista, now any install of Windows has the same issues, and I found that my date was set to 2035 in the bios.  Even the old SP1 of XP install I have still has issues and won't run anything.  (One program popped up and told me that my clock was set to 2035 and that it wouldn't run)  That was what keyed me in on the issue.  Anyway.  Changed the date, and one pc is up to 37% on vista installation.  going to reapply hack and leave it so that I get to tell it when it finds a new update, turning off autoupdate...  and run it without SP1...  Tell ya all if that works.  For this pc need to find a keyboard that will plug into a PS2 port so that I can get into my bios and check the clock.  Anyone else had this issue.  I had it on two boxes...  so have proved it not some funky issue with one...  and both have been pretty hosed after running the patch on Vista after SP1 had downloaded."
