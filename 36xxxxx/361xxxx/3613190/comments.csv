,Ratbite,2007-02-14T14:09Z,Please upload the The Blade krack by itself
,apple_mac_man,2007-02-18T03:57Z,This torrent is being traced by the ESA.  It would be prudent to avoid this one.
,oligore,2007-03-12T15:07Z,how well does it work on macbooks
,deSteini,2007-03-18T12:19Z,"Well it's not really worth trying on macbooks... Even with the lowest graphical settings, gameplay is not fluent enough to play decentely... I got a 2ghz macbook, with 2gigs of RAM."
,thekeyofd,2007-04-06T22:35Z,Does anyone have the game key for this one?  No serial was included with the torrent.  
,thekeyofd,2007-04-06T22:53Z,"Oops found the blade patch, had a bit of a brain fart, game looks great, cant wait to dig in.  Thanks to all that seeded. "

,sthprkn64,2007-12-30T20:25Z,You cannot play this game in leopard due to the NOCD crack not working. Does anyone know if the windows ISO of the game cd would work to remedy this?! Someone should try with a faster connection than me. :(
,ndrc,2008-01-20T19:58Z,"great game! thanks for it MacInheimer!!!

,CatFauve,2008-09-08T18:37Z,"The game launches, I can enter the serial, but then looks like I cannot click on Accept (nor Clear) - the button's color changes but it doesn't work... 
Anybody knows why?"
,Jerk990,2008-10-04T08:33Z,it's because the ESA hacked your computer and shut you down

,Shmil,2011-05-08T18:14Z,"*PLEASE READ*
The NoCD [k] patcher inside this torrent does NOT work. You need to update a file inside it. Now there is, on piratebay, another torrent with the supposedly fixed ipatcher unix file. 
You do NOT need this torrent to make Prey work.
Actually, if you use Snow Leopard, it won't even work (because it is meant to make iPatcher work on Leopard, not Snow Leopard). What you have to do to make the patcher work is 
1. Go to ipatcher.org and download iPatcher.
2. Right click on the .app, click show package, contents and then resources. 
3. There, you will find another .app called iPatcher. Click show package again. go to Contents, and then MacOS. Copy the iPatcher unix file inside it.
4. Go to the NoCD patcher you downloaded with the game. Show package again. Go to Contents, and then resources. Overwrite the iPatcher file inside it with the newer one. 
5. Launch the NoCD patcher. And voilÃ . "
,habydlg,2011-06-06T17:55Z,"@Shmil I cant get it to work properly I AM SEEDING EVERY NIGHT PACIFIC TIME BTW

and there is no iPatcher unix file in the no-cd crack"
,habydlg,2011-06-06T17:58Z,"@Shmil

FIXED VERSION FOR SNOW LEOPARD:
1. Go to ipatch.org and download iPatcher.
2. Right click on the .app, click show package, contents and then resources. 
3. There, you will find another .app called iPatcher. Click show package again. go to Contents, and then MacOS. Copy the iPatcher unix file inside it.
4. Go to the NoCD patcher you downloaded with the game. Show package again. Go to Contents, and then MacOS. Overwrite the iPatcher file inside it with the newer one. 
5. Launch the NoCD patcher. And voilÃƒ . 

Kudos to Shmil for finding this first... DOES WORK AND SEEDING EVERYNIGHT PACIFIC TIME"
