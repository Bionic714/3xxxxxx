,bailey239,2008-01-29T22:31Z,"@ Kumpao
there is an easy fix to the problem your having
 If the ""path to the executable"" is in the following sub- directory, ""G:\Shared Files\Downloaded Files\E-Learning Programs\Lynda.com\Tutorials\Lynda.com - Photorealism with Bert Monroy\         WindowMode.exe"", the path to the executable is 129 characters long   This will cause the user to get the error.                            
      To avoid this, make sure to save the ""path to the executable""          (WindowMode.exe or FullScreenMode.exe) closer to the root directory       (i.e. ""C:\Lynda.com - [Whatever Training]""). This is why burning the files to disk solves the problem for most people."
,ATLien1,2008-02-06T21:16Z,Anyone know where I can get Lynda com - Access 2007?
,vijayroja,2008-02-07T01:29Z,"torrent say "" no connection to be made because the target machine actively refused it"" ;-(

what solution?  "
,Olphus,2008-02-26T03:24Z,@bailey239: your tip actually worked!!
,East Lansing,2008-07-18T20:32Z,@bailey239: Your comment helped me as well.  I still had an issue with an ambiguous error message after getting into the program.  It turns out I needed to download Quicktime from the Apple web site.  Now I'm up and running with it.

I tried burning and mounting with Power Iso."
,giantblue,2010-10-04T02:58Z,What else can I try to do?
,giantblue,2010-10-04T03:30Z,"never mind. I tried to burn the folder onto a disc again, and it works fine now.
Thanks!"
