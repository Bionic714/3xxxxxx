This is the best version of Mac Intel OS X 10.4.8 I have ever used! All my hardware peripherals work; including, my ATI X1600 Pro Video Card, D-Link Ethernet Card, & on-board Intel sound. Plus, I'm able to use Apple's Software Update without my system crashing. A real PLUS! Keep up the good work! I'm hoping when 10.4.9 comes out, you are just as successful."

,paulina156,2007-02-17T23:24Z,Can anybody tell me does this version have SATA support.. cause I've downloaded 10.4.5 and my SATA hard drive was not recognised. 
,dot_ambient,2007-02-18T14:37Z,"yes, all the http link works.

the trick is fileho servers have some limit on cocurrent downloads.

you'd better download two of them at the same time, not more than three, otherwise you will get some 404 not found error.

"
,dot_ambient,2007-02-19T09:50Z,"



make sure you are on the earth:)

just tried the http://fileho.com/download/0c73d8877493/JaS.10.4.8.AMD.Intel.SSE2-SSE3.part02.rar.html

it works with firefox's download as well as flashget.

without any proxy.


btw,i've finished my downloading and the iso is good, install fine."
,dot_ambient,2007-02-19T11:08Z,"try this url first:

http://s9.fileho.com/download3/0c73d8877493_u1ssio9v67tph4qr/JaS.10.4.8.AMD.Intel.SSE2-SSE3.part02.rar

if not work, this one:


http://edn.redswoosh.net/http://s9.fileho.com/download3/0c73d8877493_u1ssio9v67tph4qr/JaS.10.4.8.AMD.Intel.SSE2-SSE3.part02.rar

notice the ""s9"" ? i assume it's the server number of fileho.

so make sure you have no more than two(maybe three) connections on the same server.

for example,  you download two file from s9 , at the same time, you try to do another file from s9, fileho will give you some error.

 if flashget or firefox download don't work. use wget for windows.

i finished my download by using wget under linux. also got some 404 php error occasionally,  after tried it several times (don't keep doing this better  wait for several minutes before do it again)

 i can confirm that all the http links work, thx a lot for the people who upload them to fileho because i can't download the bt version, either no seed or slow speed.

above link, works fine (file size is correct, 4XX M ).

either in firefox (built in downloader, just paste url into firefox,and enter, then ask for your save directory.) 

or in wget for linux.


so i think you have some problem s with the networks (maybe isp problem? )

that's strange."
,dot_ambient,2007-02-19T15:58Z,"sorry but i don't save the rar part files here because of hd space.

you'd better check it later.

i think it won't be deleted by fileho because so many people have downloaded since last week.

good luck.

,BLuNTeD,2008-11-23T02:46Z,"been looking for this release for a while, as I have tried at least 5 different distro's of OSX86, and I get them all to work perfectly out of the box all accept the audio which is driving me mad, I have an Asus M2N4 SLI mobo that uses the Realtek ALC850 AC97 audio, and I have tried everything that is suggested over on the osx86 forums, and nothing has worked so far.. someone said that they have the same audio and that they use this version and it works fine without any issues,,, though I really prefer leopard to tiger, but if my audio works in Tiger I don't really care, I guess I should be able to find a way to patch this up to the latest version but still retaining the working audio from this version,,, or that's the theory anyway!

Thanks for the release, I always seed on my torrents til I have a ratio of at least 1.5, sometimes I just leave them to run indefinitely, depending on how long I keep my PC in tack before I format and reinstall my OS!!!"

In the installation screen install only x11 and intel DO NOT install no drivers for your PC
