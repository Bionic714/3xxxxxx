Then the text file did not match the hash of the torrent so I had to delete and reupload the torrent a second time. 

Everything should work now. I cannot have made another silly mistake. "

,swamiolsson,2009-04-23T10:50Z,"Almost 1 year since someone gave a comment to this torrent. My tracker says: 10 peers, no seeders. Many of us seems to be stuck at 96,9%. 
NikephorosPhokas: Couldn't You seed for a couple of days, so the torrent can be resurrected? This is a film of lasting values, so there should be a continous demand for Nature-lovers."
