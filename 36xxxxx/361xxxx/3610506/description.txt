Various Cover Art Version 1.0

                         Presented By Evil Bastardo


  Here is a collection of DVD Movie cover art, and Music CD Cover art (mostly rock and metal). Mostly JPEGs some Bitmap. CD Face, CD Case covers, Vinyl record covers, DVD Face, and DVD Regular Case Inserts. Most are full size and scanned with a Visioneer 5300 one-touch, and a few were scanned with a HP Scanjet 3200c (Sadly the HP was dying on me, so pardon a few lowsy pictures, hence the upgrade to a maybe 3 year newer used scanner, but Hey, it was only $13.00 American at the thrift store, complete and in the box with software, and looked only slightly used. It Works, OK!)

   Use these pictures with your favorite label making software to make authentic looking copies of Movie DVD\'s and Music CD\'s. Some include the case inserts for Regular sized DVD Cases and Jewel Cases
