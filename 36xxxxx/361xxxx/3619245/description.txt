how to burn: use nero open and then click cancel and then go up to recorder and down to burn image and direct to where the iso is and burn easy as pie.


add girls after you do all the updates in the updates and 
skins folder which you will have to explore the image after burning to view and install. using manager settings  
then your on your way to nudity.

enjoy and unless someone has a crack out there you will need to keep the cd in the drive but if you do all the upgrade patches in order you should not need the cd in while playing 

Enjoy from Slickinator. 


a note: when the serial window pops up just click ok and play that popup is only if you add more girls
