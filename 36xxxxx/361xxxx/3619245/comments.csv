Have you got same code?"
[V],Slickinator,2007-02-19T01:25Z,the code has nothing to do with the game just make sure you installed all the upgrades in the skins and update folder and then all u do is click ok and start and play the code is only if you add new girls but if you downloaded the extra girls just add the girls but Don't Play them untill you use the patcher on all the girls that were recently added after that the code will always come up just click ok and start and play ok let me know if still having problems but if you did not do the upgrades in order from 1.43 to 1.44 then to 1.45 then you will have to uninstal and reinstall and try again because everywhere else i have installed it worked perfect enjoy
,theaterofdream,2007-02-21T11:44Z,Thank you very much! I try it!
,Sance231,2007-02-28T13:49Z,"When I add a new girl, patch it up, and try to play, the game always quits with an error messege saying ""Access violation"" WTF is that?"
,stefcho1231,2007-02-28T18:17Z,how do i burn it on a cdrom??? i dont get it...
[V],Slickinator,2007-03-03T02:18Z,what you do to burn is extract the iso file that is in the rar files by useing winrar and double click on anyone of the files and go and click extract and click ok and it will put all the pieces of the files back together again and you will see the video strip poker iso now you open nero and click cancel if using  nero burning rom and then go up to recorder  at the top and down to burn image and then direct to where your video strip poker iso is located   example mine is in my documents/my music   if using nero express click where it says open disc image and then direct to the iso and burn its that easy
[V],Slickinator,2007-03-09T08:48Z,maybe for less problems install in safe mode might make a difference
,zero000,2007-03-21T22:17Z,Which girls does this cd inculde?
[V],Slickinator,2007-04-01T23:57Z,they include 1-5
,Daywalk3r,2007-04-09T01:58Z,"When i got better cards, the girl move but it is stuck and the same action is over and over again so i dont can see any nude girls"
[V],Slickinator,2007-04-16T05:57Z,"the girls move around during the hands and stop at random times its supposed to do that as they don't have constant video streams
and each piece of clothing gives them like 300 dollars that you have to beat to get a piece of clothing off at a time thats why i always bet high but watch how many cards she takes when you draw because that dictates sometimes if she has a good hand also lol "
,ongr8xtc,2007-05-03T19:05Z,"Cheat Code
The following cheat will allow you to view your opponent's cards at any time by pressing the 'Q' button on your keyboard after typing the appropriate 3-letter code.

The cheat code was designed to change from one day to the next. To obtain the proper code for today's date?

Using Notepad or Wordpad, open the .bot file of the desired opponent (such as ""devi.bot"") located in VSP's ""data"" folder. Remember DO NOT SAVE THE BOT FILE OR ALTER IT IN ANY WAY before closing it!!! Otherwise you will have to reinstall the entire game and all opponents again! 
Scroll to the bottom of the text in the .bot file. Near the end of the file, you will find a set of 31 letters set between the {} brackets. -> example of Olivia's .bot file: {zxikaghjirkolenkdkioepwlaqmncvi} 
The first thing you have to know is that the cheat code you enter when playing an opponent consists of three letters (such as ZXK). The first two of those letters (Z & X in this example) represent the month and the third letter (K in this example) represents the day of the month. The year is not used. This means that the cheat code needed for any opponent will be different and will change every day. It will also vary from opponent to opponent depending on the string of letters located in that particular opponent's .bot file. To get the proper cheat code for the current month and day using any opponent, follow the following instructions? 
The first two letters of the string always represent the month of January (in Olivia's case Z & X). To get February, use the second and third letters (X & I in this case), March would be the third and fourth letters (I & K), April would be KA, May is AG, etc? 
The third letter of the cheat code represents the day of the month. To get the third letter, use your current date such as the 10th. From the last letter in the string, start counting back until you reach the letter the tenth from the end. In this case, it is the letter P. 
So in this example, Olivia's cheat code for January 10th is ZXP. Her cheat code for October 12th would be RKO. June 26th would be GHG, etc. 
Alternately, if you have a hex editor such as UltraEdit32, you can open all of your opponent's bot files and change all of the letters in between the brackets to 'A'. Now the cheat code for any day and with any opponent is AAA. But remember, this only works with a hex editor! Using Notepad or Wordpad will corrupt your game.

,Daladorn,2007-06-04T20:42Z,"Why does the game freeze? It freezes on all girls except the Polish one...and the Polish one I can only win against 1 time? So she takes top-dress off and then the game sorta freezes??

The other girls: I click them, the game page pops up, BUT no deck of cards pop up. It's just that psycho Girl-stream...no deck nor gameplay?!"

,SiLoB,2007-08-09T16:01Z,"Hi.

Ive downloaded the game and all the opponents, but I dont get to play.

Ive burned the game on CD, installed all updates, patched the opponents and tried deinstall and reinstall a few times.

But I just get the opening video (where the girl enters and pick her cards), but nothing more happends. I dont get any cards, or the ability to bet.

I run it on Windows XP Professional Edition. Am I doing anything wrong?"

,denizzo,2009-01-08T11:22Z,"i cant install upgrades 
it says runtime error 53. has anyone got this problem. thanx"
,deadbydayinblack,2009-01-16T10:10Z,"runtime error 53 means it cant find the correct file I think

I finaly got it installed by running every exe and update file in xp mode, 640 res with admin rights. ( try that)

unfortunetly  the videos dont run something about .vid files ( could be only with vista ???
I played the old version 1.42 on xp with no problems)"
,pazzy1,2009-04-20T19:45Z,"i saw deadbydayinblack had the same problem, but no solution: after finding the right version & update, the game runs until i try to load a girl and get an error about the file being .vid* which is not compatible with the game. the file is of course not .vid but .vsp, like it should be. i'm guessing this is a windows problem for i'm using win 7 beta (which is exactly like vista).

can anyone help? 
thanks"
