,Deadich_92,2007-02-10T20:24Z,u should compress it someway. 15 gig is way to big.
,ari.man,2007-05-03T18:50Z,Could sum1 SEED this?
,Vampyre_Byte,2007-05-23T15:13Z,"15 gig too big for almost 100 episodes... wow.  compress it? wake up and do yourself a favor and zip a movie file you have on your computer and see ""how much"" smaller it gets...

eg: smallville 6x22 not rar'd: 366,465,242 bytes.

rar'd: 363,303,563 bytes

doing this to 100 files of this type would save you................300 mb!  Wow... that would be just under 1 percent smaller!  What's 1 percent of 15.52 GB?  155 MB.... 'nuff said."
,darkzeratul241,2007-06-26T16:51Z,if it was compressed... i wont download it.. if it isnt then ill download it 1 by 1
,montyrob,2007-07-02T00:15Z,"can play the avi files fine but how do you play the first few episodes in mp4 ? have tried winamp,real player and windows media but all they do is play the sound...thanks for providing this !!!! awesome stuff"
,maccentric,2007-07-03T23:53Z,"montyrob, try using iTunes/Quicktime. Also, I find when all else fails, VLC comes through (especially on the Mac)"
,batkinson001,2007-07-06T05:08Z,"is anyone able to play the AVI files in this torrent?

WMP, Media PlayerClassic, Itunes, Winamp, all these cannot play the avi's, however i can agonizingly and slowly convert them to mp4, but i would rather watch the avi's now."
,whaaatever,2007-07-09T21:23Z,use vlc media player
,halofubar,2007-07-10T22:04Z,"I think by compress, it was meant to re-encode to DivX or XviD or another codec that makes much smaller sized, superb quality files that can play on PC or standalone DivX player. That's how I'd take it, anyways."

,jwilljan,2007-10-06T01:31Z,seed me plz.  my favorite cartoon all time!
,BigRob2k8,2008-01-06T18:11Z,"o stop ur complaining about the file being too big, its the right size for HQ and good video"
,jetfire4,2008-02-15T06:22Z,"A ripper by the name of slipfist and some others made a standard 175 meg per ep set of rips for this but I found some 233 meg rips and searching for the rest.  230 megs is the perfect size for one of the best cartoons of all time and much better to burn to dvd.   Why would there be an issue with them being too big, most people have 500 gig hard drives and dvd burners.   DVD quality is key."
,BofferTroll,2008-02-29T00:22Z,"Come on everybody, seed! Do it for all the kids out there, and the kids within you ;)"
,lominopee,2008-07-31T18:22Z,"This torrent is amazing. Every video is in awesome quality and it has a great download speed. It only took me about 2 days, not even 24/7. You can watch this videos on fullscreen and they look amazing. Quit whining about compressing it, go to youtube and see how shitty they look, and thats what you'd get if it was compressed. This in an awesome collection"
,bryan_x,2009-03-24T23:14Z,"i am really looking forwards to watching this, come on guys. please seed. dont hit and run"
,irishman1874,2009-06-25T18:43Z,thanks for the upload
