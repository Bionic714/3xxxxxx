,eclipticalfly,2008-05-07T05:29Z,"Anyone else having problems with Episode 2 and 5 not working? I havent tried to see if any others aren't working but so far those two havent,"
,thecow99,2008-08-25T04:53Z,"If you are having problems with your episodes then you need to do a ""Hash Check"" on your files. It's a way of testing whether your downloads were corrupted somehow, about 1 out of every 10 have been corrupted for me, but a hash check will catch it and redownload the corrupted portions.

Cheers!"
,hollylindin,2009-01-29T06:45Z,"I've downloaded this, and in season 1, episodes 46 through 52 all have glitches.  Every few minutes, it skips forward, and there's no way I can fix this.  Would you have time to put together a season 1 fix like you did with season 4?

Your putting these episodes together is so appreciated!  I live in Canada, so it's hard to get the DVD's - this is the best alternative, thanks to you!  :)"
,hollylindin,2009-01-29T07:15Z,"Actually, it doesn't just continually glitch - every time it glitches, it shuts the file down completely so that I have to open it up over and over again.  (Forgot to mention that part.  :P)"

Are there any missing, or is it just badly numbered or something. Checked an episode guide, but didnt solve the problem."
