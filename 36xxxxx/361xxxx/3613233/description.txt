I GOT IT WORKING WITHOUT A CRACK AND NO TIMELIMIT!!!

I JUST USED 3 SIMPLE STEPS!!!
There are 2 ways:
(having xp installed, clean pc)

1st option (xp installed)

1 restart pc, go to bios using delete button on startup, change youre date to 50 years from now. start youre pc

(REMOVE INTERNET CABLES! DO NOT CHOOSE UPDATE AND DO NOT ENTER AN SERIAL!)

2 mount youre version of vista with daemon tools or whatever and install vista 
( you do not have to burn vista on dvd, just directly mount it from youre pc).  
If you can you have to keep youre old files, you van select this during the installation. 
when you cant you will have to live with the fact that you cant install vista without removing youre xp files. 
in the last case select the bottom option. note: vista will put all of youre xp files in a folder in windows vista, so you can always get them back.

go on with the installation.
vista will restart a couple of times.

3 whatever you do never download updates, you have to set the time to its original state, 50 years back in my example. 

(CLEAN PC)

just use the same steps but you have to do 2 things different:

step 1 change: change youre boot sequance in bios to:
 1st cd-rom 2nd hard drive 3rd disabled

step 2 change: you will have to get youre copy of vista on dvd, fully unpacked (not in iso!)



This is how i got working vista and no time limit!

plz mail me with comments!


and remember never download updates!! NEVER! only language packs:)
