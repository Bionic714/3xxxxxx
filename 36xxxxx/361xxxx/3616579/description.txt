The titles are listed in the Sveriges Radio files as "Listen to This," "Nefertiti," "About That Time," "'Round Midnight," and "Directions." There are two recent re-broadcasts of these concerts, both with introductions and announcements by Lars-Göran Ulander and Lars Westin -- the version issued on Mega Disc has introductions (5:03, 4:09) and closing announcements (0:57, 1:07) with Davis's "Milestones" and "All Blues" in the background. There is no background music on the version listed here.

Corea begins the first concert on a malfunctioning electric piano but he gives up on it; after a short interval, he plays acoustic piano for the remainder of the concert. Davis's choice of tunes ("Paraphernalia," "Nefertiti," and "Masqualero") was probably influenced by the lack of an electric piano.

The Davis Quintet toured Europe in October-November 1969 as part of the Newport Jazz Festival in Europe produced by George Wein. The itinerary was as follows:
