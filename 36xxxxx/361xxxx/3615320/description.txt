Moebius is set in the tunnels under Buenos Aires, deep within its labyrinthine subway system, and centers on a metro-train containing 30 riders that has mysteriously disappeared (much like political dissidents tended to "vanish" in Argentina during the yers of dictatorship). The citis subway officials are greatly troubled and so call in a topographer/mathematician to help them find the train. The mathematician soon discovers that the subway system, with its countless add-ons over the years, has become so incredibly complex that a gigantic moebius strip has been created on which the missing train is now trapped in a fourth dimension.

"Those in tune with the complexities of Argentine politics will have the best understanding of the subversive, satirical points made in this off-beat low-budget parable. Those unfamiliar with the country's history and problems, but who have a taste for intellectual and academic filmmaking, will still find much to enjoy" - Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide
