,nickepekka,2007-02-12T08:37Z,"I followed your instructions:

1. Intall Game
2. Run 1.3 Update
3. Run 1.3 [k] (The Blade)
4. Start Game And Enter Serial Number

1. After I installed the game it says ""please insert the original disk"". I never got any further. 2. Then I ran the update, which seemed to work ok. 3. Then when I tried to run the Blade crack it says: ""You can't aaply patch on this file"". I don't understand what I'm doing wrong or is this torrent a hoax? Please help!"
,nickepekka,2007-02-12T14:15Z,"OK. I figured it out. For those of you that have problems.  Here are the instructions for dummies:

1a. Unzip ""Call of Duty2.dmg""
1b. Drag the ""Call of Duty 2 folder"" to your applications folder.
2a. Double click on the ""Call of Duty 2 Multiplayer"" icon. NOT the Call of Duty 2 icon!
2b. Insert the serial number that is inside the ""Call Of Duty 2 SN.txt file"".
2c. Call of Duty 2 Multiplayer will launch. You can quit it then.
3. Now unzip and apply the ""2.1.3 Call of Duty update"". After it's ok, close the dialog.
4. Finally double click the ""Call Of Duty 2 1.3 [k].dmg"" file and apply the crack. You have to locate the ""Call of Duty 2"" that is inside your application folder. NOT the Call of Duty 2 Multiplayer"". 
5. Start ""Call of Duty 2"" from your application folder.
6. Enjoy!   "

I recently downloaded this torrent and tried to get it to work on my mac. I am trying to follow the instructions given on this page, but I still can't get it to work. Every time I try to run the single player and multiplayer games, it always says ""please insert original disk."" Also I tried running the crack, and that doesn't work either. It says can not run patch on this file. I also ran the 1.3 update, but that doesn't seem to help. Please Help!!!! I would love to be able to play this game.

,Minervabarn,2007-04-12T02:58Z,"Okay, for all of you that really really (really :P) would like to play Multiplayer CoD2 without buying a real serial key. all you got to do is NOT to update to 1.3, the 1.3 CoD version contains Punkbuster.. wich is blocking the so called ''Multihack'' from working. Multihack does something with the IP-adress u got that enables online play. It works perfectly fine for me in CoD2 1.0, Just find an MP Crack for cod and skip the updating, thats about it. The only thing you'll miss from patch 1.3 is two maps. (and punkbuster ;P)"
,bradfantin,2007-04-12T21:28Z,"thanks Minervabarn. i will give that a shot, but that means i have to reinstal the game now, right? becauase i already installed the 1.3 update... oh well. at least i know how to do it "

,outlikeariptide,2007-11-14T11:34Z,"Here's a major issue I ran into. If you have the CoD2 Demo installed then there is a way to get around the ""insert disc"" and ""cannot patch file"" problem. Go ahead and copy the CoD2 folder over and run the update. Then run the multiplayer version that is in the demo folder, it should prompt you to insert the CDkey. Then run the blade on the CoD2 Icon in the demo folder. Finally copy the CoD2 Data folder from your main COD2 folder to the Cod2 Demo folder. Now when you start the CoD2 icon in the Demo folder the real game should start up.
I guess maybe you could just uninstall the Demo folder and then run the regular setup listed before, but this is what worked for me. So if you have the CoD2 demo installed and you can't get this dl to work, I think this should fix your problem."

3.  Download newer version of iPatcher from megaupload/?d=9NNRG75L
4.  Extract the [k]
5.  Right-click the NoDVD file and click Show Package Contents

7.  Now just replace the iPatcher with the one you've downloaded.

,echologic,2008-04-13T18:36Z,"Ok, here is a detailed installation guide as requested:
1. Open ""Call of duty 2.dmg""

3. Unzip ""Call of duty 2 1.3 Update.zip""
4. Run the update program
5. Open ""Call of duty 2 1.3 [k].dmg""
6. Drag ""Call of duty 2 v.1.3 No-DVD"" to the ""Call of Duty 2"" folder in your Applications folder
7. Open ""Call of Duty 2 Multiplayer"" (i.e. NOT Single player!!)
8. Enter the Serial Key (which is in the ""Call Of Duty 2 SN.txt"", located in the downloaded folder
9. Create a new profile in Multiplayer mode (input fields show up automatically)
10. You can now close CoD2 Multiplayer

Now you can play!! Have fun!!"
,skibilatore,2008-04-13T22:48Z,"It works fine.  I cant connect to games though.  Either because of cd key or because i need punkbuster.  And i was wondering those instructions you gave, do those include single player, because when i click on call of duty 2 (not multiplayer) it asks for the cd."
,skibilatore,2008-04-13T23:01Z,cd key is in use.  Is there way to play SP.  And any other way to find another SN?.  Thanks for help
,echologic,2008-04-14T15:40Z,"Hmm..I read some earlier comments here and it seems that this particular crack doesn´t work for OSX Leopard (10.5+), only for Tiger. So now I will try this crack instead, recommended in this forum:

,echologic,2008-04-14T16:01Z,"Yep, it definitely works. Downlad that other crack! For those who haven´t read the discussion: The crack in this torrent does NOT work for Leopard; if you have Leopard you want to downlad this one instead:

2. Drag to your CoD2 folder in your Applications folder

,Enemy04,2008-04-20T18:04Z,"GUYS TO MAKE THE CRACK WORK FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. Open terminal app (found in ""applications"" and in ""utilities"" and find the terminal)

2. type this exactly:

cd /usr/lib
sudo cp libcrypto.0.9.dylib libcrypto.0.9.dylib.old
sudo ln -sf libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib libcrypto.0.9.dylib

3. Open the crack and it should work

I know you ppl think it's weird but it works because the crack is supposed to find file and when you type this the ipatcher it finds it.

Single Player works then
Multiplayer will work by mounting the dmg file with toast.

Anyway how do you play multiplayer games because i finished single player!"

Just replace the singeplayer file with this one and things should turn out fine.

I was having problems with the crack too, but i solve everything thanks to this  new crack:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3633272/Call_of_Duty_2_(Mac)_app_cracked

The process of intalation is simply.

1) Once you downloaded the ""Call Of Duty 2 1.3 Including [k] And SN "" just unzip it and run Call Of Duty 2.mg
2) Now, drag the Call Od Duty 2 Folder to you hard disk
3) Go back to the original Call of Duty folder (the one you unzip it) and run the Call Of Duty 2 1.3 Update.
4) Open the new crack from 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3633272/Call_of_Duty_2_(Mac)_app_cracked

and drag it to the Call Od Duty folder in you mac HD.
