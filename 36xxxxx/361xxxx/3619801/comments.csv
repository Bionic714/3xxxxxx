Thankz and Please everybody jus keep seeding, I'll seed for as long as these are on my hard drive if ya'll can jus hang in there and help me complete the download.."
,n1nj4Lo,2008-06-01T10:19Z,"#digitaltv whats up with the audio on season 3? It's really extremely low in volume, Are seasons 1 and 2 jus like this as well? Needless IDK Yet becauz I haven't really watched seasons 1 and 2 becauz of how reluctantly NickTOON's has rerun both those seasons altogether, So I haven't felt a real need to watch them yet... I jus grabbed them to have the whole collection, But I am still seeding all of them and they've been finished since May 8th all of them.. Like I said before I'll help to seed for as long as possible...

Jus one more question, Does your IRC Channel have the complete collection of Catscratch? LoL, If so I might wanna join so I could grab it myself.. Thankz again for this awesome up.."
