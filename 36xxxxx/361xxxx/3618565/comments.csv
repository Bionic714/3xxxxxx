,PRIMEALPHA9,2007-11-17T23:59Z,"There is an alternative to running this program.
I will upload ""Cubase SX The BIG pack all VST's"". download this and install. The Crack in this progam will ultimatey affect Nuendo 3. you must leave cubase sx installed on your system for Nuendo to work.  

Your Welcome.......

,sonicmyst,2008-02-21T19:39Z,"I have H2O Nuendo releases 2 and 3 along with loads of other cracks. This thing freezes when you go to install. I have the dongle emulator and it detects it and keeps on going through the set-up procedure. When it gets to the last screen and you install it, it just freezes. Does anyone know what to do here?

Thank you in advance..."
,germzzzz1,2008-02-24T07:31Z,HEY sonicmyst  U JUST GOT TO GIVE SOME TIME TO COMPLETE THEN IT SOULD WORK TRY HIT THE WINDOW SIGN THAT IS FOUND BETWEEN CONTROL AND ALT ON UR KEYBOARD
,sonicmyst,2008-02-26T18:01Z,"Hey thanks germzzzz1!

I did figure it out. It works flawlessly. I was afraid to install it as Nuendo 3 because it would overwrite my current Nuendo 3.0. I thought if it didn't work, I'd be outa luck. I called it 4. After I took a deep breath and called it 3, it worked immediately. 

Thanks so much!

,cyclone303,2008-02-27T08:01Z,"I can't get this to work, I install it, then run the asio config, and while its registering the vst's it just disappears, closes itself out for no reason, with no error, and thats as far as I can get, I get the same thing with cuebase, and I've uninstalled a few times and retried, if anyone can help I'd appreciate it, cyclone303@yahoo.com "

,npegg,2008-11-26T22:05Z,it only works with SP2 if you are installing and keep getting errors uninstall SP3.
,IamTheWalus,2009-02-02T22:19Z,does anybody know if there's a way to make this work with vista 64? I think the H2O driver at the beginning of the installation is only for 32 bit OS
,qwenlander,2009-02-16T19:31Z,"Dear Lord Walus ;)

Just recently I managed to make this work on Windows 7 64-bit beta (which is superb, by the way). I combined the two cracks as follows:

I installed the h2o Nuendo with ye olde dongle crack, ignoring the errors with cled. Then, with msconfig, I disabled the cled (h2o dongle) from startup. Then I placed the SYNCOACC.dll in Nuendo folder and dbgeng.dll in System32 folder, and lo, it worked. And still does, but hey, I've learned to expect total absolute ultimate tandruff blowing crash any time with these tits of a cracks.

But keep fiddling with them, good sirs, something good is bound to come out of it sometime.

PS. This worked with Win 7 64, so one could safely assume it works witn Vista as well, eh?

PPS. I myself am so bleeding tired of tweaking this shite that I can see the day drawing nearer when I actually purchase one of these overpriced monsters. Scary."
,qwenlander,2009-02-16T19:38Z,"Oh forgetful me.

SYNSOACC.dll and dbgeng.dll are from one of them Cubase 4 feeble cracking attempts. Can't bring myself to recall which distro. Sorry. Something to do with uhmm... Smack Jack?"
,jonaza24,2009-02-23T16:27Z,"I have looked for help but i can´t find any answers. 

I have installed it, (Worked), and have started it (Worked several times) But after having restarted my cpu a couple of times something about a ""H2O Cled shit"" crashes and i have to re-install the whole thing, somebody having the same problem?"
,lucidpaul,2009-09-03T09:52Z,"Dongle rules in the end so we have to buy it if we want it
Cause no one have cracked nuendo 4 cleanly neither 3 "
,perostoj,2009-09-04T21:32Z,"I bought dongle maybe a year ago, just to examine the thing... it's not even expensive... well... the dongle is empty one :) which mean I have no license for any of the steinbergs products... so I'm wondering... can I make it work with some cracked up license and how... any link mates?

thank you for your minute"
,Lovesmovies,2010-04-04T15:12Z,"jonaza 24...couple of times something about a ""H2O Cled shit"" crashes and i have to re-install the whole thing, somebody having the same problem""
 I had the same problem and this causes me to not be able to click on the task bar aT THE BOTTOM.. ON XP A SIMPLE RESTART IS ALL IT TAKES TO SORT OUT AND ON VISTA ALL I HAD TO DO WAS TO LOG OFF THEN LOG ON AGAIN... I NEVER NEEDED TO REINSTALL AT ALL HOPE THIS HELPS ;;;;;;) although i have now tried to install cubase 5 by air and that didnt work but also the fucking thing fucked up my nuendo .. so heed that ppl.. dont install ncubase 5 if ya still using nuendo.. "
,toph75,2010-10-02T23:07Z,"Can someone just tell me where i can get a dongle crack or whatever? I get a message that no protection device is connected.
