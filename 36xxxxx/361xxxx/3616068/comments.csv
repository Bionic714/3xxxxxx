,rheina,2007-06-19T13:47Z,"yeah, sure! And i am hanging on a 99,7% for about a week now like some idiot. I am asking then - why i cannot finsh my download?"
,valeriamdp,2007-09-14T00:16Z,"rheina I´m sorry if you had problem with the download, but the torrent is a bit old, but still active, if you look u can see that 96 times had been dowloaded only from this site...., so research first after be so cruel.
Good luck "

,TheInfernal,2010-08-29T13:41Z,"I downloaded it, no DL problems except for very few seeds, but the video itself doesn't work for me, it's split up into about six different parts and none of them work on my DivX player. I know it's not my computer because I have used it all day today and have had no problems from any other torrents. So I have to say I will not be downloading from valeriamdp again."
