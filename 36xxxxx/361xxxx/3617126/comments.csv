,bubach,2007-02-13T05:50Z,"eh, not to be an ass or anything, but the quality seemed slightly lower then usual. is it really hdtv source?"

,Kapox,2007-02-13T08:42Z,"I don't get why everyone whine about .rars ^^

Just open the first .rar file and unrar it straight into vlc!"
,kocksy,2007-02-13T09:40Z,"Just like to thank you guys for putting heroes on here week in week out, i love your work! Many thanks."
,Yaaraer,2007-02-13T11:51Z,"bubach: Yes, I too feel that the quality is slightly worse than before. According to the video info, it should be the same, but still... Anyhow, Heroes it always Heroes :)

And to you others - what's the big problem with rar:ed TV-shows? It'll take like 30 seconds to unrar it, and then you can do whatever you want with the rars (but, please seed to at least 1 ratio). 30 secs is like nothing as it will probably take you 10 minutes to get it down and another 43 to watch the show; if you ain't got the 30 secs, do you really have the time to sit through 43 minutes? :P"
,Kalaha66,2007-02-13T13:09Z,"Yaaraer, it's not about that. I agree with wabdal2. The thing is that if you like me wan't to seed for at least a day or so you have to keep the rar files. But you also wan't to watch it so you unpack the file and then it takes up double the space.

What I'm saying is that rared files fuck up the seeding."

,AeneasLordaeon,2007-05-30T15:06Z,"I was wondering why i have to let all these episodes stand for about a night before i have them, everybody says they download in like 10 mins but i get a max speed of 33kb/s... is this because i'm downloading 5 eps at the same time? i'm also seeding 9 eps"
,Negerkalasparad,2007-11-03T20:13Z,9 seeders and 19 leechers.... seed pl0x ;)... thanks
