Some nice screenshots here.. I hope more people will play this game soon :)

The official server has a ranking system too which
can be viewed here:
http://ranks.mp-gaming.com/
It is still under construction but eventually it will be
just as advanced as a BF2 statspage :)

Hope to see you on the battlefield ^^"

Players in the server can see their rank details by
typing !rank in F2 (public chat)."
