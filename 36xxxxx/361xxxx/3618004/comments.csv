,miffe,2007-02-15T01:10Z,"Just pass -kb  to unrar and it will unpack enough for it to be watchable, and pass -idx to mplayer if you want to seek in it. "
,roostra,2007-02-15T07:40Z,"miffe,

sorry that i don't understand - what does ""pass -kb to unrar"" mean?  i would love to watch, but i can't figure out what to do.  thanks."
,odietamo,2007-02-15T11:19Z,"Run the winrarfile, klick on ""Extract to"" as usual, and after choose ""Keep broken files"", its a box on the bottom left side."
,vicci,2007-02-15T11:40Z,can't somebody post another episode please??
,meu56th,2007-02-15T13:43Z,"***** FIX THIS ARCHIVE AND PLAY THE FILE - INFO HERE *****

Oki, this rar archive is corrupt, sad, but thats just how it is...

If you have WinRAR installed you can still extract the video file by doing the following :-

Right click on the file called gilmore.girls.714.hdtv.xvid.notv.part01.rar and select EXTRACT FILES from the WinRAR options.

This opens a new window asking where to save the archive, look in the bottom left corner of this window for the option that says KEEP BROKEN FILES.

This will extract the video file, it will still complain it's corrupt, and it is, but at least you have the file now !

Ok, now you will probably find the video will not play, I got a message along the lines of 'this file does not appear to be a valid avi file'.

So, to fix this, you can download a program called Video Fixer from this link :-
http://www.achensoft.com/download/vfjSetup.exe

Install this program, run it (you get 10 days fully working demo so you can uninstall it after the fix if you don't want to keep it).

Once it's running, drag the gilmore video file in to the window and click the FIX button on the left, it will take about 1 minute and it will create a new file in the same folder as the original, this new file plays just fine !!!!

There you have it, a working copy of this epispode... Enjoy...

Thanks goes to kollll for all his time and all his uploads, it seems we just got unlucky with this one.

,mixal,2007-02-15T14:17Z,"Nice fix! thx a lot. :) To bad the ending is missing, but shit happens"
,meu56th,2007-02-15T14:50Z,"Your welcome :-D

Im don't think there is anything missing from the end except the titles, the total run time seems right give or take a couple of seconds, he probably just cut it a second or two before it went to the titles... I think..."
,bassiss_3874,2007-02-15T18:49Z,fuck you kollll! not nice... go with this insted guys: http://www.isohunt.com/torrents/?ihq=gilmore+girls

,r1ckard,2007-02-16T23:46Z,I have WinRar but I don't get the option to keep broken files. It just complains that no archives are found. What version of winrar are you using.
,MariMor,2007-02-16T23:49Z,"thank you for the video fixer... it really worked

,meu56th,2007-02-17T01:09Z,"@r1ckard - my WinRAR is 3.61, you can grab the current beta version right here on PB :-

,Kapox,2007-07-11T12:50Z,"Thx, the fix worked... VLC seems to be able to repair the vid aswell. It said that it was broken and asked if I wanted to try to repair it and that it could take some time. I pressed ok and vlc fixed it in no-time..."
