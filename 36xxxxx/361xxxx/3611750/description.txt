Unleash hits High King Maulgar 
January 31'07

On the first available server reset we gathered our best players and went into Gruul's lair to fight High King Maulgar and friends. Our first tries went awfully slow but once the killing order was in place and the first minion saw the dust the kill of High King Maulgar was in sight. Unleash gets server first Gruul's Lair epics, and you know what they say: 
loot for the win!
