,volcomhackzor,2008-01-10T02:54Z,"3 imporatant thing about the internet 'KnoxsMom':
*****************************************
1) you should never double, let alone TRIPLE post in any forum-like comments section
2) torrents are legal because you are only sharing small clips of the file(s) (TV news channels do movie reviews this way)
3) some people live in other countries than US (ie: in Russia and Pakistan, there are hardly any laws governing the internet)
********************************************
If you really think that legally downloading clips of file(s) is illegal, then you'll have to find some way to shut down the internet..."
,mc_spella,2008-03-16T07:52Z,Seed please!!!!!!!11!1
,shapsinator,2008-05-05T05:18Z,seed please. Ive wanted this for a long time. i have a fast modem so if anyone seeds for an hour or two i'll be good. 
,shapsinator,2008-05-05T22:08Z,"i'm also at 99.7!!! please, please, seed! sorry for double posting, but seed for 5 minutes!!!!1"
,DemonsDog,2008-06-15T16:38Z,"hey knoxs mom

everyone, don't bother downloading this

1: it has no seeds, so it will download super slow

2: buy the dvd, to get all the super sexy features

3: if you don't buy it knox will get pissed and throw dead birds and canculators at your parent and put his old socks in your mouth...

4: it'll just be quicker to buy it, you'll get it in 2 days intead of two years by downloading it...

knoxs mom, tell him that he has a friend in the FBI (Me!)"
,HippieJoe,2009-02-25T02:28Z,Is this the new or old DVD. Also how do i get this on a DVD?
,HippieJoe,2009-03-08T20:08Z,Seed PLEASE!! I'm at 99.73% it will take less then 1 minute. Please. 
,HippieJoe,2009-03-09T23:24Z,Ok mother Fuckers sorry but please seed i need this.
,Quatroking,2009-04-14T18:07Z,"According to the release date, its the old version. I can know, as I own the original one, which is AWESOOOOOOME.

Anyways, don't bother downloading this. 0 seeders is equal to doing nothing."
,Spider-Kenny,2009-06-12T19:10Z,"This is going to take hours for my comp. Does seeding slow my computer at all?
It doesn't need to be any slower."
,Neondangel,2009-12-24T05:16Z,can anyone tell me if this works fine or not?
,bbsawyer7,2010-01-31T21:56Z,"Hey guys, Just extract it even id it is stuck 99.7%. Then burn it and watch it from the CD on your computer. If you watch it from the files without burning it, it wont be with the correct voices. I burned it and it works good though there is a bit missing at the end since it did not finish downloading."
,fakebest,2010-08-21T04:33Z,this has been stuck at 99.7 % for weeks and the one seeder probably the uploader comes ounce in a while but yet some how no one connects to him and no one gets to 100% just let some one get to it so there will be more seeders because what is the point if no one finishes.
