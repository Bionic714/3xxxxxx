Description: Alain Resnais's Nuit et Bruillard is a landmark documentary that is arguably the foremost film ever made about the Holocaust. Intercutting black-and-white archival material of Nazi concentration camps with new color footage of the deserted camps as they existed in 1955, the result is an incredibly powerful and horrifying experience that no fiction film could ever possibly hope to achieve.
