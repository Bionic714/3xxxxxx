,sofiet,2007-02-19T15:42Z,Hi! Got a question; The episodes of greyÂ´s that has 22 or 28 files doesnÂ´t work on my computer. I open them with VLC media player. I can only watch the ones that has 1 file How do I do? /Jen
,Zatzumas,2007-02-19T17:23Z,Seed please!
,jora-,2007-02-20T18:39Z,"The episodes with a bunch of files is packed/compressed with WinRAR (similar to WinZip). Google for ""winrar"", download and install. Then rightclick one of the archive files (the file ending is .rar) and choose ""extract here"". Now you have an .avi file which you can open with Windows media player. You may delete all the .rar files after you've extracted them.
Good luck! :)"
