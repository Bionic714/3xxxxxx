These are the highest quality AVI files for season 17 I could find.  All are Xvid, AVI format and are 170mb and above.  Got a Grainy crappy release? Doh?!... NOT here.  All clear tivo quality Simpsons.  

On Liberty Bell, Two Liberty Bells, Doh... I mean Woho, three liberty bells! It's a Great release!

The files are names a little differently, however the file sizes remain the same, as do the episode numbers and names.

Happy Valentines day.  Some classic love advice Simpsons style....LOL

Grampa: "Hot diggety! I'm gonna smooch her like a mule eating an apple! I even bought me some special novelty dentures. See?"

Homer: "Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you gotta play it cool. Now what you gotta do if you wanna get a kiss, is act real smooth and make your move like this." [yawns, and puts his arm around Grandpa's shoulder]

Grampa: "Oh, I see! So if I take your advice and make your patented move, then my chances for love will slightly improve?"

Homer: "Now what's that rule?"

Grampa: "Play it cool."
