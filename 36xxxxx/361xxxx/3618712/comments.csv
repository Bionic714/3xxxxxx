Originally I was going to upload a torrent from another tracker, but I was stopped short since PB would not allow this.  So, instead I re-released with my own file naming using their tracker.

,elyk1212,2007-02-15T16:14Z,"BTW, to clarify the left had side reading #M = #Mb, e.g.176M = 176 MB file size.  It is not part of the file name."
,strove,2007-02-21T10:24Z,it would have bin nice with a little more seed;P
,elyk1212,2007-02-22T06:07Z,"Yeah, only one doing so right now... me....:( 

But this is due to no completions yet.  All in queue are about 99%.... so they are almost there.  At that time, there should be at least 30 seeders.  Hopefully they don't bail ;) "
,elyk1212,2007-02-22T08:58Z,"Please help me all out with seeding now that a few are done!

Let the seeding begin...!  Excellent...."
