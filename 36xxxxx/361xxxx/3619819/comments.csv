Question: Are these liveries the same as the older ones, or is there any change??
"

Uhm, to be honest with ya, I don't know.. I just got these from the PSS 757 installer."

,neo258,2007-02-18T14:11Z,Possible to reseed captain sim 757 V1.2 (FS9) with the bug fix for the flaps?
,seristee,2007-02-20T19:48Z,can someone seed the original installer for the PSS 757 v1.2
,A-Wings,2007-03-03T20:04Z,"Liveries come out grey but the tail, anyone knows how to fix this?"
,the_alchemist3,2007-05-24T04:55Z,"I had the same problem with the textures - gray body with the tail ok - but only with the 757-200RR Rear Hatch Exit version.  The problem seems to be with the model.  Go into the ""...\Flight Simulator 9\Aircraft\PSS-B752R"" folder and open the ""aircraft.cfg"" file.  Do a search and replace, search for ""model=h"" and replace it with ""model=o""

This worked for me."
,hejmeddig123,2007-09-29T21:48Z,Is this only the livires but not the plane..?
,airman123,2008-01-17T15:56Z,"If you have downloaded this torrent, then you have helped put PSS out of buissness. That means they will make no more addons. For proof, go to ""http://www.phoenix-simulation.co.uk"" and see for your self. I hope your happy!"

**chuckles** Yeah . . . . Okay, kid.  So if you are so anti-pirate, why the fuck are you trolling around the Pirate Bay?  OH!  Wait . . . . You are one of those hypocrites that came HERE to download your product because PSS went out of business WITHOUT notice and refused to give their customers ANY chance at al to FTP their product for backup before just ripping down their site.  But you want to justify YOUR form of piracy by leaving a comment slamming other pirates.

By the way -- it's on record that you downloaded the torrent, too, so you WILL (and his IS an order from a Captain) learn to do the following:

-->Quit being a hypocrite

-->Learn some grammar (such as the VERY obvious difference between ""your"" and ""you're"" that they teach in grade school -- you know -- the school you dropped out of).

-->As another poster suggested on one of the many torrents you posted on: ""Shove your head up your ass"" (Note that THIS is the proper use of ""your"").  This will make it a bit easier to kick you off the plank.  **laughs at you**

And, yes, I do have time to copy/paste this to you in a few of the torrents you commented (AND downloaded) because I, too, am downloading these files which I legally paid for thru PSS and rudely found out I have no access to after a hard drive reformat.

**shrug** I am guilty of not backing the files up to a CD or source separate from my computer.  But, hey, thanks to P2P clients and sites like the Pirate Bay, pirate or not, we legal users can now rectify this situation.

Have fun playing with your downloaded files while blaming others for your own guilt, hypocrite, kid."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-04-02T18:18Z,"AH!  I forgot to mention a big THANK YOU to those of you sharing these files for those of us to back up.  I don?t care about pirate status or not ? it?s awesome to be able to get these files after they conveniently disappeared from the server without notice.  PSS was still in their legal right to stop trading without notice, but it was bad business practice and it is guaranteed that if the ever go back into business, such shady business practice history will fuel pirates even more.  Sorry, PSS, but that?s sad when you don?t at least give notice and force customers to go to P2P sites to get their files.  The proper way to do it would have been:

Send an email:

?Hey, sorry, we?re going out of business in ? say ? 1 week.  Please log into your accounts and you will now find an FTP RAR (or ZIP if they are that cheap) copy of your files to download for a proper backup.  We apologize for the inconvenience.?"
,yeoldecaptain,2008-04-02T18:19Z,"Okay -- not sure why TPB converted my quote marks to question marks, so I apologize to other readers if this post looks funny O.O"
,Aviator-ONE,2008-05-30T17:30Z,"Hey friend yeoldcaptain, donÂ´t waste your time with that guy airman123, your job is great friend THANKS A LOT, you make happy to many people who  loves to flight FS, continue in the same way  !!!! you have the support of many people  friend,.... see you"
