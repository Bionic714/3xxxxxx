STORY - Thirumalai sees director Ramana working within two big limitations. He has an age-old poor boy-rich girllove story in hand and has to contend with Vijay's mass image. Considering these restrictions, he has done a commendablejob. By fashioning the hero's character a little differently and designing a fast screenplay that contains several stocksituations but resolves them differently, he overcomes those negatives to deliver an entertaining feature.
