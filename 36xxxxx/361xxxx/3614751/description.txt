Definitely don\'t let the lacklustre effort of the first White Noise film put you off seeing this creepy sequel.

Although the ties to static \'noise\' from electrical appliances are stretched somewhat thinly (was this film written as a stand-alone then tied to \'White Noise\' later???), this is a nice little horror film with loads of atmosphere and great performances.

Nathan Fillion (Sliver, Serenity) has a good 95% of the screen time and does a great job as a man whose family has been murdered in front of him. There are ghosts a-plenty and some nice \'can\'t mess with the future\' themes - if you like the Final Destination movies, you\'re gunna love this.

Don\'t wait for DVD... this film is worth the download.

Sorry no sampull.

The pic is good and so is the sound one of the best cams I have seen in a long time allmost a TS.
