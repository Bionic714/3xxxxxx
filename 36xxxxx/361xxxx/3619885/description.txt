I found a vinyl copy of this album in a record store the other day in great condition, and I was curious as to what this group had done besides their two Top 40 hits, "Hooked On A Feeling" and "Never My Love".
The rest of the album is OK-there's a few interesting remakes besides those two songs. In any case, there was never a follow up in the US as far as I know, but I'm sure if there was, someone will let us know.
This is kind of tough to find, so if you could seed it for a while, it would be appreciated by others.
