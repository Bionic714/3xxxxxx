The rock music definitely was an opposition of the communism. That's what I know from my personal experience, because I'm living in Eastern Europe. 
The Comminist party here rejected the rock music."

,sneakygerry,2007-12-09T12:21Z,"Cornel-tree, if your from eastern Europe you've also had a dose of this bastard's ideology. Remember Hitler? He thought you were untermensch (sub-human) and so does this guy. More fascist assholes dreaming of the days when they had the power to gas six million Jews and slaughter entire villages. When they dream of freedom, what they're dreaming about is an England free of eastern Europeans, Africans, Irish, Italians, etc. Better again, they'd like to go back the the British Empire. Grow up, Cornel-Tree. Think about it."

,boozemonster616,2008-12-11T17:30Z,"remember communists called Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin? they didnt cause any deaths did they?

if you dont like the music dont listen to it, dont go spouting off about how you dont like it, you have the right to your own opinions, everyone has a right to their own too. 

so do yourself a favour and stop wasting your own and our time trying to change people to your opinion... the people who download this dont care."
