Professor Nick Cutter and his research team are recruited by the government to investigate a series of dinosaur sightings and struggle to find answers.

With the help of zoologist Abby Maitland, his research assistant Stephen Hardy and student palaeontologist Connor Temple, they try to uncover the secrets of the temporal anomalies. As the prehistoric investigation intensifies, Cutter begins to suspect that the these events and the disappearance of his wife eight years ago are somehow linked."
