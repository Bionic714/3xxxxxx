The Wii is unique in that each of its "channels" features original music. There are some main channel themes like the Mii and Shop channels' tunes, but then it goes deeper in the Weather and Photo channels, with the latter having 9 songs. 6 of these are tunes that you can choose to have played while a slideshow of your photos is shown, and I have to say they're pretty cool. They're actually full songs, not just short looping melodies.

It's amazing to me that Nintendo has tunes for all these menus. This is one of the things I love about them. The fact that someone took the time to compose songs for all these screens is just fantastic, as it's certainly not something you'd expect in most consoles. Of course, the Wii's channel setup isn't exactly ordinary, but still, you get my point.

Here's a breakdown of the tracks: 

1 - Mii Channel (1:53) - What you hear when you're watching your Miis walk around. 
2 - Shop Channel Title (0:35) - The short ditty that plays before you actually enter the Shop Channel. It lets you know, "Aw yeah, THAT song is coming up." 
3 - Shop Channel (1:58) - THAT song. It makes spending money enjoyable. 
4 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Calm) (2:44) - A nice piano song. It's the only one (iirc) that doesn't loop. 
5 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Fun) (3:09) - As the title suggests, it's a fun, bouncy ditty. 
6 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Bright) (3:06) - A very up-tempo track. Parts of it remind me of Super Monkey Ball music. 
7 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Nostalgic) (2:31) - I guess it's nostalgic? Piano & strings. 
8 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Beautiful) (3:18) - This one's a misnomer; it's actually an up-tempo jazzy song. Although, I guess you could consider that beautiful. One of my favorites. 
9 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Scenic) (5:44) - Ambient music. The longest by far, since it takes awhile to develop. 
10 - Photo Channel - Fun (Doodle) (2:10) - A slow, jazzy vibes thing. 
11 - Photo Channel - Fun (Puzzle) (0:44) - More mallets! This time, it's a cute little xylophone melody. 
12. Photo Channel - Message Board (1:14) - Happy, I guess? Not a whole lot to this one. 
13. Weather Channel (2:07) - This one's nice. It's a cheerful tune featuring pizzicato strings, a flute, and yet more mallets. 
14. Weather Channel - Globe (2:45) - Ideal globe-viewing music. 
15. Weather Channel - Globe (Location) (2:44) - A more low-key version of the above song. It doesn't have the deep strings.

I hope everyone enjoys and appreciates this music.
