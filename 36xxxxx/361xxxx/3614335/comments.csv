Mathematician, scientist and inventor Wayne Stahnke became fascinated with the idea of designing his own reproducing piano when he visited Disneyland at the age of thirteen. ?They had a player piano?and it was playing all those notes, with perfect accuracy, and amazing rapidity,? he said. ?And something clicked in my brain.?

It was to be an enduring fascination. After earning a degree in electrical engineering from U.C. Berkeley, and enjoying a successful career as an aerospace designer, Stahnke returned to his dream of designing and building a reproducing piano. ?I wanted to build one that would record and play in a way that would satisfy the finest musicians,? he said. His technology took more than a decade to evolve into the state-of-the-art Bosendorfer SE reproducing concert grand piano. Pianist Earl Wild said of the instrument: ?The reproduction is wonderful. It reigns supreme over any reproducing piano I?ve ever played, and I?ve played every kind over the last 50 years.?

Stahnke next turned his attention to the creation of a pioneering method of sourcing and transferring historic music roll performances to compact disc. This technology was also a labor of love, taking several years to invent and perfect. The results of his efforts can be heard in the current Telarc recordings, A Window in Time: Sergei Rachmaninoff performs his solo piano works, and A Window in Time: Sergei Rachmaninoff performs the works of Bach, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, and others.

Rachmaninoff is by far my favourite composer and to hear him play his own pieces in this quality is simply amazing. It just can't get better. Thanks, you are my hero. I'm going to buy the CD as well if I can find it. Maybe even LP."
