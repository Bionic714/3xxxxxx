,heyhurray,2007-02-15T21:44Z,Thanx.
,nkslaughter,2008-03-23T00:20Z,Would have been nice to know this was in PAL. I can watch it on the PC. Anyone know of a good NTSC version I can get my hands on?
,hereitcomes,2008-03-27T15:28Z,You could conveet it to NTSC yourself. A good idea would be to purchase a dvd player that will play both NTSC and PAL. It would open a whole new door.
,nkslaughter,2008-04-01T16:51Z,Convert it huh? Any suggested tools for that?
,AxelVanHorn,2008-05-14T18:04Z,"Yo nkslaughter,
Get a DVD that play both,
no tools,
no huh!

It cost only 25 euro here in Europe to get such a DVD player."
,SvenGoody,2008-05-29T02:35Z,"If you use a Mac, you can convert any PAL file to NTSC with Visual Hub."
