I am stuck at 99.5%...but I will at the least make certain that you get 99.5%....plus I will open my pipeline so you are not sitting at a paltry 10kbps...  

Eventually the SEEDER of that Torrent will pop back on and give me the remaining .5%....

Hopefully...


Seriously Creative... Fuck you ... I will never purchase another product from you bastards again making me and others go through this BULLSHIT to replace a CD for a piece of hardware that is already 200+ dollars..."
