,white_fox,2007-03-26T22:36Z,"title:arnold1965 a sad truth
****************************************
you want to know a sad little fact about arnold1965 
he only uploads these movie so he gets attention because he has no friends in duetchsland he craves the little thx for the upload crap. if you didnt tell him this he would probably kill himself so talk to him and make the poor guy feel wanted also he spams people and takes there 40 dollars with clickbank affiliate programs.
arnold1965 i want my 40 dollars back id rather donate than give it to you, you loser.
arnold1965 please stop spamming tpb just upload the movies and give proper cred to the original release you stole this from and made your own. teafortwo,sisco etc. 
arnold if you need some friends join a sports team or something and get off your lazy ass clicking buttons on your pc and spend some time with real people.
instead of your ""e-friends""

,cherrybabe,2007-03-26T23:07Z,"SERIOUSLY PEOPLE. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO NOTIFY TPB ABOUT THESE 2 white_fox  & jroc261. WE COME TO TPB TO DOWNLOAD MOVIES, MUSIC AND GAMES BUT WHY SHOULD UPLOADERS LIKE ARNOLD1965 BE HASSLED?
NO UPLOADER SHOULD BE HASSLED AT ALL.

PLEASE EVERYBODY - SEND A MESSAGE TO TPB AND HAVE THESE IDIOTS BANNED FROM TPB.

THIS HASSLING/HARRASING HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH AND I'M SURE SICK OF IT.
JUST LET US DOWNLOAD IN PEACE AND THE UPLOADER LEFT ALONE.

THOSE WHO HAVE UPLOADED ARNOLD1965 MOVIES AND HAVE APPRECIATED THEM COULD DO HIM A FAVOUR BY HELP STOPPING THESE IDIOTS."

,Laila63,2007-05-04T05:54Z,"Hej! kan någon vänlig själ tala om vad jag gör för fel med daemon tool?
När jag fick hen Babel så var det 3 olika ""grejer"" varav en IMG-fil som jag inte packade upp innan jag tog hen Daemon tool
När jag sen fått hem DT så blev IMG-filen ""förvandlad"" så den fick daemon tool märket ..och inte går att klicka på??

Fattar ingenting ?? Går ju inte att packa upp
