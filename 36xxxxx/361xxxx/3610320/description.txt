Lovecraftiansk Grunge med gruppen The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets.

Lite obskyr, lite svårhittat. Men bra om man som jag gillar Cthulhu-Mytos.

The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets is a rock band that is dedicated to promoting the literature of H.P. Lovecraft, who wrote of lost cities, tainted geneology, alien gods, and that fabled tome, The Necronomicon. The Thickets haven't been able to get ahold of the ancient spellbook, but they've got their own brand of corruption. They're on a Lovecraft binge of madness, and they mean to take you with them. The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets have a reputation for entrancing and inciting their live audiences with their melodic blend of energetic punk and rock, while wearing graphic costumes that help bring their good-naturedly macabre songs to life. Their latest project is the soundtrack to the much-anticipated film Spaceship Zero, based on the classic German TV show from the 1970s.
