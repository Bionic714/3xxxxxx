,connerj,2008-04-02T20:13Z,"Personally, when I bought the game I picked up an Xbox 360 controller (the wired kind) and installed the drivers from MS website. The game plays like a dream with this pad! As for the gfx, make sure you download the official patch (just google it). I'm not sure about the patch on TPB, anyone know if its any good?"
