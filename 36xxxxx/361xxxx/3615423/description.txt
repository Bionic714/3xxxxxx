"Isham created a number of wonderful records over a span of 5 years in the last half of the 1980's: "Castalia", "Tibet", and "Mark Isham". Of them Castalia is the most inventive and musically complex, Tibet is the quiet one, and "Mark Isham" has the best "songs". Tibet was originally music for a laser disk "movie" and as a result it is not surprising that it is quieter than the others. However, it is a subtle record of great beauty and unpredictability. 

I love it when the slow synth "washes" are suddenly interupted by the wierd guitar and horn duets (as happens in part II). The spoken haikus also just appear out of nowhere and are then followed mysteriously by a complex two minute segment of horns, guitar and percussion (David Torn on guitar, Kurt Wortman on percussion) as happens at the end of part III.

To me, this is a perfect record for thinking, for contemplating the world, to lose myself in thought."
