After implementing Wii interface sounds into WiiNintendo?s sister site, Wiifii.net and using Wii Sports sounds in a video, I?ve been asked dozens of times if I could send people some of the sounds recording directly off the Wii. I decided to release WiiNintendo?s first album entitled ?Wii Sounds?, this album is a free download via SendSpace or Torrent and includes such classics as:

- Wii Menu Background
- Wii Channel Startup
- Wii Channel Rollover
- Wii Channel Rollover Bass
- Wii Channel Select
- Mii Channel
- Forcast Channel
- Wii Sports Intro
- News Channel Startup
- and MORE!
