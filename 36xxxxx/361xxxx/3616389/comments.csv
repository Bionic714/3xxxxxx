,zoneone,2007-02-13T08:56Z,"It's going very slow.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3565524/The_Prisoner seems to be the same files...

And that torrent is still active. Just a hint..."
,zoneone,2007-02-13T20:43Z,"...And yes, I'm doing some ""cross-seeding"" too. :P"
,zoneone,2007-02-13T22:51Z,"Bah... stupid idea.
You better try that other torrent...
Or you can wait, and wait, and wait."
,minckagirl,2007-02-23T18:13Z,"Sorry for the slow upload, but I promise it will be fully seeded. I know how bad I wanted this! That's why I reseeded it! The source was Pirate's Bay, so this is a re-seed, and the actual pedigree is unknown. Enjoy!  - Mincka"
,minckagirl,2007-02-24T19:48Z,"LOL - of the first 40 or 50 people who downloaded (Pirate Bay Website says only 10, my eyes say different) were ALL LEACHERS! This is a huge file and I'm on a sketchy connection. When you've reached 100%, PLEASE SEED for a few days, and do your part. Thanks.  - Mincka"
,Smoho,2007-04-03T01:30Z,"I promise , to pay the bearer, on demand .. at least a few days seeding at good bandwidth! just let me get this one ! !  :)"
,FREEtheMOVIES,2007-08-14T21:54Z,This is one of the greatest shows ever made! I haven't been able to find it anywhere else! Thank You!!
,CaptButler,2008-02-15T22:01Z,"This is a healthy torrent (at least it was when I downloaded).  The first episode, ""Arrival"", appears to be a transfer from videotape.  There are some brief video gliches in a couple of other episodes.  However, this is very much worth the time to download.  Many thanks, Mincka!  Keep seeding everyone."
,OV32LO2D,2008-09-12T05:32Z,"I remember catccing the re-air on the sci-fi in the late 90's. Was a teen at the time, forgot the name later in life, buddy referenced it other day, found it here. Thnx minckagirl.... Amazing Show!!!!! Will seed until 10/11/08."
