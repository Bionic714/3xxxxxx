Any suggestions....

,passaroazul,2012-01-23T18:28Z,"followed the advice of skywise, and it worked.
I used avast firewall to block access to the net, and registered using the address first@last.com. and the serial number 00FN3-S3U3T-MNDWY-4FH4V. in fact already had installed acoustica, but as others, mine also stoped working. I do not know how long it will work, but at the moment Skywise solved the problem. I got this message from Acoustica: ""Congratulations! You're a registered user now. Thanks from all of us at Acoustica. Maybe we're prejudiced, but we think this is the finest decision you've ever made.
Many happy labels"".
hope this helps.
Thanks Pyrates, and Skywise."
