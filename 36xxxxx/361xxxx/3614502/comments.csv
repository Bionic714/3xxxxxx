I don't think the keygen actually is a virus/trojan, it's just flagged as a keygen trojan because it's used for illegal matters (register a commercial application).

This is the results at virusscan.jotti.org :

A-Squared  Found nothing 
AntiVir  Found TR/Keygen.S  
ArcaVir  Found nothing 
Avast  Found nothing 
AVG Antivirus  Found nothing 
BitDefender  Found nothing 
ClamAV  Found nothing 
CPsecure  Found nothing 
Dr.Web  Found nothing 
F-Prot Antivirus  Found nothing 
F-Secure Anti-Virus  Found nothing 
Fortinet  Found Keygen.S!tr  
Kaspersky Anti-Virus  Found nothing 
NOD32  Found nothing 
Norman Virus Control  Found nothing 
Panda Antivirus  Found nothing 
Rising Antivirus  Found nothing 
Sophos Antivirus  Found Troj/Keygen-S  
VirusBuster  Found nothing 
VBA32  Found nothing 

Only 3 antivirus shows a ""virus"". 

So I checked it myself by simulating an install with the application Altiris Software Virtualization which keep track of everything and installs/runs everything in a seperate memory space (i.e. it's safe to run infected exe's).

After doing that I went into an edit mode where I can check all changes done in the ""installation""  and nothing was added/changed in the registry and no new files added on my harddrive, it just generated the keys.

So I'm pretty sure it's safe.

But for you who don't want to use the keygenerator, here is a couple of serials, but remember, it's only for testing out the application, if you like it, buy it ;)
