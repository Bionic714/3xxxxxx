US release of the Ã¼ber-classic RP game Final fantasy 6. And yes, it will play fine on your european GBA. Funny thing, i didn't see this anywhere on TPB so i thought i'd better upload it. I won't seed for very long so please share and seed at least 2:1. This isn't my release since i leeched the rom from some anonymous angel who shared his ripped retail. I only repacked and upped it here on tpb. Hope the torrent works, if it doesn't i'll fix it tomorrow. Have fun, this really is one of the best.games.ever.
