To get all of them, plus a few more things, try this torrent instead: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3652189/"
,BloodLogic,2007-04-16T19:07Z,"What does ""accreditation removed"" mean?"
,zikman23,2008-03-09T09:19Z,it means you're redistributing the Geophage rips without giving due credit
,Lyph3,2008-04-05T15:59Z,"Well, when aXXo rips off other releases nobody gives him shit.

Thanks, BloodLogic.  I've found at least 8 of your uploads that are exactly what I've been looking for!"
