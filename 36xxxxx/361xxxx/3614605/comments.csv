,SmogTM,2007-02-11T15:38Z,YogyBear: you should try to start the game as quickly as the copying starts. Also check if Yasu is enabled cos it disables itself every time you restart your computer.

,entrecote,2007-02-11T18:50Z,"People, if you like this game you should buy it.

I´m saying this because the previous title from this series (aftershock) was starforce protected, and this was not well received by fans of the game. Now they´re not using star force protection due to popular demand, and the thank the developers get is a top rank at thepiratebay instead of copies sold.

In my opinion you should try this game, rather the demo. And if it´s the pirate version, do not seed it if you like it. Then go buy it when it becomes available where you live.

By buying this game you are saying, ""Thank you for not using starforce"" and ""Thank you for making a good game"".

There is another nice UFO game available [UFO - Extraterrestrials]. I think it will also be a good game."
,YogyBear,2007-02-11T21:27Z,"Heh, i finally managed to run the game ^^
I was really desperate, coz i tried like 70 times (really) without any luck. Just hope that i will be able to run it again sometime.....
I better won't quit the game before i finish it... XD"
,Alekz1,2007-02-11T21:39Z,"well, i finally too managed to run the game and here is the way :1) mount image in daemon 4.0.6 2) of all emulation option 3)run secuRom loader v 1.2   4)chose as target ufo.exe on c:\***\ufo afterlight and fun!!!"
,razor64,2007-02-11T21:43Z,"@ entrecote

I ABSOLUTELY AGREE!

I will be purchasing this game as support for the developers. It lives up to my every expectation, so far at least after 10 missions a few base enhancements and personnel training sessions.

For the folks still having problems running it; the copy file method works. Try copying the file, then quickly running autorun.exe from the mounted disk image, then hit RUN in the loader  window the applet shows. Wait 3 to 5 seconds and cancel the copy... The game starts right up on two of my machines, every single time.

Again thanks goes out to SMOGTM for working out the method.

Honestly though, the game is SO TIGHT, so well made, so seamless, so smooth and looks incredibly sleek___it's well worth the purchase. Also, I am sure some MODS will come out of this, the engine has a lot of potential to launch the X-Com series into a new era.

Greets Everyone!"
,xkxax,2007-02-11T22:38Z,"1. Disable all Daemon tools emulation functions.
2. Install newest Alcohol 120% 1.9.6 4719
3. Reboot
4. Start Alcohol
5. Click on ""Emulation""
6. Make sure ""Launch ""Burning features of Alcohol 120%"" without ""Ignore Media Type"" function"" and RMPS are both activated and only these two, no extra emulation options.
7. Insert a DVD+R and burn the image with RMPS at 4x
8. Make sure Alcohol 120% autostarts on Windows startup
9. Reboot (to enable alcohol rmps function in explorer)
10. Make sure alcohol is running
11. Start Yasu 1.07
12. Start the game
13. If you did it correctly this should work, however not all burners support the neccessary features, I know the Pioneer-111 series work.

,saabas,2007-02-12T15:28Z,"Thanks xkxax
I had done same thing by a guide somewhere else, but forgot to keep Alcohol running. So after reading yours and keeping Alcohol running i got it to work "
,ssid,2007-02-12T18:18Z,"Thanks a *LOT* xkxax! I can confirm that this method works, and loads the game every time.

I tried the file copying method with absolutely no luck - it's a non-deterministic method due to the fact that people may have mounted the images on separate buses or drives of different speeds. If you have a fast PC or storage subsystem then it may work; if not, it will time out like it does on mine.

You'll know you've cracked it when you put the burned disc in and the label reads ""Ufo Afterlight"" instead of ""NEEDS RMPS2_0"". Just remember to reboot after you enable RMPS in Alcohol's emulation options, and use the most current version of YASU that comes with this torrent."

You're clearly to lazy to do what's needed to make it work but not too lazy to come on this site and vent your anger. 
But like many, I'm too lazy to do what it takes to make it worse, so i'll just wait and buy it since I was going to anyway.

These morons can't even crack a game, or test if their shitty instructions work on anything but their own system. Fuck that."
,GT Ranma,2007-02-14T00:24Z,"DrJonez is right, I use to release games a few years ago when I lived in Japan. I would _NEVER_ put my name on a PoS release like this. I would be embarrassed to have this associated with my releases. 

There are two types of people who release games: ones that do it so other people can play games they normally wouldn't (or in my case, couldn't. Back then buying Japanese games was not an easy task), and ones who want recognition, or to be 'cool.' Procryon prolly falls into the latter, have you seen some of their 'tags' for their releases? OMFG, Look at their Battlestations torrent here. That ones is crap too, but their Scar Face is doing well... *shrug* 

I am going to buy this game when it comes out, I've been planning on it since they said they would release it in America. But who the hell knows when that is... It just annoys me that n00bs like this get anyone to dl their junk.

------------------------------------------------

- Procyon's recommendations...didn't work.

- Searching for a crack...none available yet.

- Wildly copying files while starting...bullsh*t.

- Putting tinfoil over my head, praying to god, etc. ...no success.

- Burning the image to DVD-R...worked great!

Here's how:

1) Burn the image with Alcohol 120%. (Default settings, exept for ""RMPS"" enabled.)

2) Start YASU.exe

3) Activate ""RMPS"" emulation in Daemon Tools. (Should also work with Alcohol's own ""RMPS"" emulation, but i never tried it.)

4) Start the game and have fun.

5) When satisfied, consider actually *buying* it! Seriously, this is one of the not-so-many games, worth donating a few bucks for!

Details for the record: YASU 1.07, Daemon Tools 4.08HE, Alcohol 120% 1.9.6.4719, burned with 2x speed to DVD-R (didn't try DVD+R or other speeds and btw. my burner is >3 years old, i.e. nothing fancy.)

4) make UFO.exe low priority

It's strange but it works.
Seems high CPU/file usage confuses the protection system. It took me about 7 attempts though.
PS: I was using the mini image from gamecopyworld"
,tutike2000,2007-02-19T13:31Z,"the copy from disk trick did not work for me either at first, but this is how I made it work:

1. Set all Daemon Tools Emulations OFF
2. Start copying 2 files from the image drive AT THE SAME TIME (so two 'copying' windows will show up)
3. Start the game exe
4. Once the cursor changes to a disk, turn all Emulations ON and cancel ONE of the file transfers.

it takes the game about 15-20 seconds to start"
,Twilight72,2007-02-20T13:10Z,"Maybe u Guy´s should smoke some more weed!!

Windows Vista Ultimate on my system!!
This Great Game works...If u do like this

1) Burn the image with Alcohol120%, remember to put a mark in ""Burn with RMPS"". 

2) Now Unmount all drivers in Daemon (V4.08HE the one I use), Remove all options like Secure Mode and Automount and so on, 
Only put a mark at ""RMPS""under Emulation"" in Daemon.
When done correct Daemon icon turns from red to green in active taskbar (low right corner in ur screen).

3) Install the Game from disk, when done!

4)Go down low left corner in ur screen press the Windows Start button:choose Play UFO Afterlight.

5) And Bing the game starts...Have Fun!!

NP. If Securerom pops up...just hit ""ok"" 
and run YASU..and then run game again(4)
Remember no mount in Daemon at all!!

If ur lost go ask Twilight in the Zone

"
,krezeb,2007-02-20T23:33Z,"I got it to work.. Mount in Alcohol 120%, restart the computer. Run YASU, go into the short-cut properties and change the Compatability Mode to Win2000 and play.

After that, just run YASU before you play."

,cycklas,2007-02-21T17:55Z,Hi every body!! I most be freaking Einstein because I went to GameCopyWorld and downloaded the crack for this game!! Instead of tearing apart my computer like the most of you have done....:P

it works!!!"
,Gambit_2K,2007-02-24T03:38Z,"The whole start a virusscan and lowering priority of game really works. It starts maybe 2 times out of 10 tested though. Raising the priority of your antivirus scan to high might help.

Although in Vista the game crashes back to desktop with an error message for me. Something about not being able to read memory. I can watch the whole intro and make it to the mainmenu of the game, but as soon as i klick the mouse on any option it crashes. Same thing if I try to bypass the intro. I've set the compatibility mode to WinXp but still doesn not want to run. 

I've read that people got this game working with the same setup as me and Vista, som I haven't got a clue what the problem is

Systems specs:
C2D E6600
2 Gig ram
Ati X1950 256 mb
Catalyst 7.2 (tried 7.1 too but same prob)."

So what now???
Thanks to anyone that replies....."
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-10-03T16:58Z,"@DaRumpel

against my better judgement I'm going to help, but first I'm going to tell you why no-one else has, and why I nearly didn't.

RTFM!

Ok, it's an nfo file not a manual, but same rules apply. There were instructions with those files.

Download daemon tools (google it) install daemin tools, when it's running in your task bar right click the icon and select ""mount image"" navigate it to the .mdf and mds files and select."
