Plot outline from DVD box:
Lucky Luke is the fastest gun in the west - Even faster than his own shadow. He's also the sheriff of the merry but very unruly frontier settlement, Daisy Town. Together with Jolly Jumper, his trusty and loyal talking horse, they maintain law & order. That is until the Dalton Brothers show up and all heck breaks loose!

When the townspeople find themselves surrounded by Indians, the future looks grim. Can Lucky Luke & Jolly Jumper save the day?

Or is Daisy Town destined to be another forgotten page in history?

My comment:
I recently went looking for this movie online, and was only able to find it on Ebay. So I got it from there and thought I'd share it.
Enjoy.
