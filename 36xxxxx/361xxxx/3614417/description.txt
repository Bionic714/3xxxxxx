 Two ordinary guys on a mission to get as close to the most feared  
 sharks as they possibly can and film them as never seen before!    
 Nation Geographic sponsored Rob Torelli & Mark Priest, as they     
 free dived with Great Whites from the tip of South Africa to New    
 Guinea. This extraordinary experience brings them face to face with 
 feeding sharks, a great manta, and even a Bryde's Whale!
