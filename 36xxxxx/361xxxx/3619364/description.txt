Release Notes:

DJ Kawasaki's made quite a name for himself with
his richly collaborative Beautiful album -- and
this set follows in similar format by offering up a
host of Kawasaki mixes done for other artists! As
on Beautiful, the groove here is soulful house at
its best -- done in a style we haven't heard this
well from Japan in a long, long time -- really
taking us back to some of the best days when
Japanese artists were first starting to win us
over! Kawasaki's touch is amazing -- simple,
soulful, and very direct -- the kind of groove that
so many others have strayed from in recent years,
and which is still plenty darn vibrant! Titles
include "Release The Light (Kawasaki rmx)" by
Jazzida Grand, "Let's Get Started (Kawasaki rmx)"
by Seikou Nagaoka with Kellie Sae, "Endless Flight
(Kawasaki rmx)" by Kyoto Jazz Massive, "Bright Like
Light" by DJ Kawasaki with Lena Fuji, "Shine (radio
edit)" by Shuya Okino with Diviniti, "Let Go
(unreleased version)" by Ernesto, "Isn't She Lovely
(Kawasaki rmx)" by Studio Apartment, and "Promises
(Rasmus Faber rmx)" by DJ Kawasaki with Terrance
Downs.
