,tpontow,2009-05-31T03:36Z,"I would really love to play this game, but I get the same 'Wrong Disc' message as so many others.
I'm really not sure what to do now.
I have, obviously, mounted the ISO on Daemon and installed the program, but when I press play, I recieve the message: 
""Wrong disc inserted.
Please insert the original ""Equestrian Challenge"" CD/DVD.""

When I click on the NFO file, it says that it cannot be opened because it is corrupted or an unrecognized version.
What do I do to be able to play this game?"
,Sewenn,2009-07-18T15:21Z,"Instructions for hacking:

1. In the folder G:\HATRED find file EquestrianChallenge.exe
2. Replace this file the original exe file in game directory where you installed it
3. Done!"
,Sewenn,2009-07-18T15:33Z,Note: Folder G:\HATRED is located at the image CD
,Sewenn,2009-09-18T00:20Z,"Stay on the distribution, plz!"
,how2b,2010-01-26T16:15Z,Can't find the No-CD patch? 
,Sewenn,2010-01-26T22:08Z,"how2b

NoCD is located in the folder \HATRED (located on the disk image). This is a file ""EquestrianChallenge"".
Copy this file to a folder C:\Program Files\Red Mile Entertainment\Equestrian Challenge (default).
Play!"
,tpontow,2010-05-01T21:16Z,"I can get the program up and running, but when I get to the loading screen, I keep getting a Runtime error, saying that the program terminated.

Help?"
,Sewenn,2010-05-04T01:20Z,"tpontow

If you mean the error Microsoft Visual C + + Runtime Error, then try to refresh the library or the operating system. What is your operating system?"
