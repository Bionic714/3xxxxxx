"Angels of the Universe (Icelandic: Englar Alheimsins) is an Icelandic film from the year 2000 directed by Fridrik Thor Fridriksson. The leading role is played by Ingvar E Sigurdsson. Sigurdsson was nominated for the European Film Awards for best acting. The story is based on Einar Mar Gudmundsson's novel of the same name. The novel is a semi-fiction and is about Einar's brother Palmi, though in the book and movie he's called Pall or Palli. A lot of the book is true; his brother was mentally ill, which is how he was portrayed.

Plot

Englar Alheimsins, which has often been called an Icelandic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, is the story of an Icelandic man and his slow descent into madness. Along his journey he meets Dagny, the initial cause of his breakdown, among other more interesting characters in the asylum. Other people he meets are committed for various reasons, such as signing checks for Hitler, believing to be writing songs for the Beatles and telepathically transmitting to the long broken-up band. The film is a beautiful tragedy, with brilliant imagery taking us through a sorrowful life.

Soundtrack

The movie soundtrack features the compositions of Hilmar Orn Hilmarsson, as well as two songs of the popular band Sigur Ros. Mixed in the film adding an interesting element are several American rock songs, though they are not present on the soundtrack CD release." (via Wikipedia)
