,chuKKus,2007-02-14T17:17Z,"English subtitles of disc2 seem to be out of sync BUT in the link provided by zcorvine9 (tnx!!) there's a sub tagged ""not out of sync for disc2"" that COULD be OK. I will try..."
,chuKKus,2007-02-14T22:03Z,"I found on zcorvine9 suggested site the fixed sub and it's perfectly on sync.
It's called: ""Curse of the Golden Flower (Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia)  English   Curse.Of.The.Golden.Flower.DVDRip.XviD-NeDiVx. (SUBFIX. CD2 was not synchronized properly)""
It's a .srt with only English text.
Tnx again zcorvine9!!"
