,dev22,2007-02-14T10:34Z,"""It's messed up. First off, it's 1h 52 min on a single cd...is it supposed to be like this?
Second, heh, it's out of sync since the beginning, badly. I'm not even sure the first part belogns to the movie...maybe it's an extra or something. The film is obviously unwatchable as it is now.
This is strange, especially from Diamond.""
