,laglÃ¶s,2007-03-02T16:56Z,Could have something to do with there being like a 100 other torrents of this kind
,Lindane,2007-06-08T12:07Z,"greedoch-
             Your an idiot, ""hahaha...nobody download this:)"" well maybe because it was only 9 hours old when you posted, and it was uploaded at 1am?
2 albums 7 cds, not 1 unsuccessful band has more then 1 album/cd so the must be doing something right.

Great upload, thanks ;)"
,Gludan,2007-08-21T17:09Z,"yea Greedoch. i got like 7 friends that have the meteora album. and it has been downloaded 2755 times when im posting this.

Good torrent :D"
,XaLTzeR,2007-09-02T14:44Z,Thanks! Looked for this torrent long time ago..
,Thekenreaper,2007-09-06T01:51Z,"Flipping sweet, i lost my Underground 2 cd and now i have it back"
,onanizer,2007-09-26T09:41Z,good speed
,FrIeK,2007-09-27T00:30Z,"Haha greedoch.

You must really feel stupid. ""nobody download this.""

Think again. Its on top 100 over downloads. So I think that someone is downloading it.

By the way: THANKS for nice upload:-D"
,DSMeTailer,2007-10-10T21:23Z,"I am sick of ThePirateBay's bullshit!

Downloaded:
3325 times
Seeders:  39
Leechers:  35

I download it, seeing as how it is so healthy, only to be stuck waiting in line with 78 other peers with NO SEEDS!!!

Fucking assholes just don't get the nature of file-SHARING, do they?  They take GB after GB and give NOTHING in return!  We need a new network with proprietary software that ensures at least 1:1.01 sharing, that way no torrent would ever die with 80 people waiting for a seed.  Bittorrent, TPB, Utorrent, and all of the other major players need to all be involved and agree for this to work.  Spread the word people!"
,Czerw1n,2007-10-13T11:37Z,"Linkin Park's good

Seed plz!"
,Otria,2007-10-28T02:27Z,"greedoch, eat a cock kid Linkin Park owns"
,echoecho03,2007-12-08T10:00Z,"who''s the dumbass that said two albums? do your research again...

,The_Notorios,2008-01-22T20:15Z,I already got all Linkin Parks albums and stuff... XD

,pirate_swe_rob,2008-02-02T18:50Z,Fuuuck yooou ivoted
,Boobyhead,2008-02-04T18:00Z,Why do some of the underground folders only have 2 or 3 songs? 
,staticradio,2008-02-16T20:55Z,"Please could someone seed, Thanks"

,u96,2008-03-03T20:36Z,FUCK YOU greedoch!! What is the matter with you? Linkin Park RULES!!! Thank you so much for this torrent!
,DylPyl,2008-03-06T02:56Z,"Like it or not, people like Linkin Park. That doesn't make 'em faggots or retards or anything else... people like indie music too. I like both, it's just musical taste, whatever. Yet bashing people and misspelling words because you're frantically trying to express your hatred for some band and their fans (or because you can't spell) DOES make you a stupid asshole. Sorry, but it's true. Kiss my ass."
,heeman1119,2008-03-09T21:09Z,"Don't flame flamers you lame lamers!
Don't whine over music and bands you don't like, we (the fans) realy don't care for it, so please stop.
Share files and spare some money :) it's all good.
Be happy damnit!
Shout out! Obama for president!"
,whitekid77,2008-03-15T17:49Z,"@ DylPyl
Thank you for saying one of the most sensible things I have heard on TPB. I completely agree with you.


Linkin Park rock! =D"

,Juhemi,2008-04-08T17:01Z,"Really nice, thx a bunch! And for all those whiners who don't like Linkin Park:

Why the fuck do you enter the torrent if you don't like the band? You stupid or just need attention?"
,ImPrettyMuchSexy,2008-04-30T19:11Z,"I don't understand the logic in coming here and ranting about a band you don't like. Why are you here in the first place? No one wants to hear anyone rant about a band that they like. 

And to be honest, I don't really like this band either. But I am not going to flame people for it. I am just collecting."
,avengerkay,2008-05-07T22:32Z,thanx!

THIS DISCOGRAPHY DOES NOT COME WITH THEIR NEW ALBUM ""MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT!"" BUT THAT DOWNLOAD SHOULDNT BE HARD TO FIND."
,TheGreyFox,2008-05-31T15:42Z,"Only 'Hybrid Theory' is particularly good. After that, they slowly give in more and more to commercialness and selling out. Although, 'Meteora' has a selection of alright songs."
,keaganf,2008-05-31T16:18Z,"all of this sounds EMOOOOO!

*cries, crawls in a corner and drags razorblades while blacking eyes with black eyeliner, listening to Dashboard Confessional, thinking about how life is so miserable, so I think I'll tell the world on thepiratebay.org. SOB*

HAHAHAHA"
,SiDiZ,2008-06-03T12:45Z,"keaganf as mather of your post. Keep your breath to something more importent mater... And don't say against yourself and come back with real information that can surport your misplaced comment.
