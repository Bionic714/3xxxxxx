,Mcgreag,2007-02-11T11:58Z,Not sure what happend to the seeding here but this torrent have been stuck at 99.7% for several days now.
,mesohony,2007-02-11T14:27Z,Giulietta??? you gonna finish seeding this torrent or what??? or was this just an ad for another web site???
,mesohony,2007-02-11T14:57Z,"If your stuck like everyone else at around 99.4% you'll have to sign up for this jerks web site to get the rest of this upload!!! your now getting a tracker error telling you to go there and sign up but don't do it!!! that site is full of spam, pop-ups, virsus's, trojans, and keyloggers!!!"
,Giulietta,2007-02-11T18:58Z,"Sorry. There are problems with the seeding in my computer, my client don't recognize the 100% of the files from the torrent, so be patient until I can fix that (if I find out how!). THANX"
,Giulietta,2007-02-11T21:34Z,"IMPORTANT NOTE: ok, I hope it works now! anyone who's been dowloading this torrent before, try change the torrent for this one: 

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3616186/Pocahontas_DVD_Disney_(engl_span_portug)_-_FIXED

This is the one that works, so just delete the old torrent and download the movie from this new one.

THANKS."
,Giulietta,2007-02-11T21:41Z,"Do not delete teh files from the movie, just the torrent, and then when u download the new torrent (FIXED), u pick the folder where the old files from POCAHONTAS were and then ur client will just recognize the percentage that u had downloaded before-."
,mesohony,2007-02-12T02:00Z,"If I was wrong about your motives I apologize...
BTW i made up all that stuff about the DVD quorum site..."
,Giulietta,2007-02-13T19:45Z,"I know u made that up, because that's one of the best spanish sites of DVDs ever!

www.dvdquorum.es

just that they were changing the host of the tracker this weekend and the torrents didn't work out properly, now they do and it works perfect."
,pokeyuoh89,2008-02-26T19:02Z,"same thing happened to me as the first guy, I'm stuck at 99.7%. can someone seed the rest of it plz?"
