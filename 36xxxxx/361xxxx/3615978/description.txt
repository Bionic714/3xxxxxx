Wheelchair Racing Entertainment presents First 
Gear Pinned 3, This racing,jackass to party movie 
has catched the FGP crews' sickest and most exciting 
moments of 2006. From the sandy berms of 
Vingaker, the dropping gate of Drapslaget, the sunny 
FGP Compound to the treacherous, heat-scorched 
hills of Hallsberg.This movie is probably the stupidest 
ever made.....so far.....Follow as Rikard Fälted rides 
thru muddy shitholes, Marcus Björklund falls on his 
face from a 9 meters cliff, David Säflund threws up 
after only one beer, Richard Olsson drops the 
SCB-stairs and Gustav Persson wrestles in 
sumo-costumes. The dust may have settled, but this 
movie will take you back to the raw and brutal 
moments of various extreme sports as motocross and 
wheelchair racing. With no money, no factory support
and no brain.....well, only a fool's brain......you will 
now be shown what it takes to ride with heart.
