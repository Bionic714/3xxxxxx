,ubermenschen,2007-07-28T12:05Z,"It really annoys me that people are downloading this music, go buy the CD instead, it doesnÂ´t cost you much and the money you pay goes to a good cause.
Comeon support Bound for Glory, they are a great band and they deserve it!"
,Mister22,2012-01-05T23:38Z,"Yes, buy the fucking CD too!

But if you're like me, you bought this CD three times already, because you loose them at friends houses, your house, in the car...they get beer all over them and are used as coasters by drunk skinheads or you use them as weapons on communists. 

You need to have this on mp3 just to have it safe. I don't know how many empty white power cd covers I have, but they outnumber the ones that have a cd in them..."
