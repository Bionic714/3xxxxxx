,Anti-Noob,2008-03-09T21:19Z,"Heya, to play the files you need to get real player or real alternative... Id go with real alternative though...

anyway I just watched episode 12 and there are subtitles in some language I dont recognise... theyre quite distracting and I would like to know if episode 12 was the only episode with subtitles, or whether there are others... thank you for the upload and im seeding right now"
,Anti-Noob,2008-03-09T21:25Z,"I just checked out the rest of the episodes for subs, and I can safely say the only disappointment was episode 12, and to be honest... subtitles aren't really much of a problem"

,scoopnohlee,2010-07-03T17:37Z,can someone explain to me why these files get used now instead of RAR and AVI?  How do I play these or extract them?  If someone could answer these questions you'd be my new idol
,DickDickstein,2010-07-30T21:56Z,"While the quality isn't superb I found them to work fine with VLC player. A few little glitches like the video stopping towards the very end of an episode and having to restart to finish it once in a while for me anyways. All the videos work with VLC player though so you can at least see these as this is the only Season 4 torrent on Pirate Bay. 

If you d/l torrents you should all have VLC player anyways as it is by far the most compatible with everything:

http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

Also, I scanned these with a few programs and they are virus free. 

thanks for the up, but this format isn't really useful for most people.

If anyone wants to you can convert rmvb files to avi. Just search ""convert .rvmb"" in Google and the first link is quite helpful. "
,DickDickstein,2010-07-30T22:02Z,"Oops...should say ""convert .rmvb"" as that is what these files are. (Real Media Variable Bitrate). 

I didn't need to convert them using VLC, but if you want to it IS possible according to a couple sites I looked at with some 30 day trial freeware available aroudn the web."
,L0000000L,2010-07-31T17:05Z,"Download Real Alternative ( http://www.free-codecs.com/download/real_alternative.htm ) and you will be able to watch these rmvb files with your favourite player ( i prefer Media Player Classic - Home Cinema)

Are there subtitles matching for this version?"
,Hattmannnen,2010-08-29T13:08Z,please seed i'm downloading in like 0 kB/s
,Vicinity123,2010-10-24T13:51Z,"Please seed,

,hakuna_matata,2011-01-01T09:42Z,"rip is good but subtitles plz?

I tried .subtitlesource. but the subtiutles there are in frames formatso they arent synced.

,hakuna_matata,2011-01-01T10:26Z,"Found It

thanks anyways people... now you dont have to search for it :-)

thx mlody00843 for the Up !!"
,zingo_punkbuzter,2011-02-01T16:36Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD ! This is a waste of time.
I've downloaded this and the audio seriously have issues.

--- :known problems: ---

Windows Media Player - This player does not have support for this format (rmvb). Addidtional codec is needed

VLC - This player have serious lag-issues during playback (experience of low frames is the common problem). Additional codec is needed.

Winamp - This player does not have support for this format (rmvb). Additional codec is needed.

Real Player - This is the player that did handle the format ""rmvb"" best, but still, the biggest problem is not a missing codec.

The greatest problem is the one that ripped the videos. HUGE volume changes from episode to episode, plus there is a hard-sub of unknown language to me, very anoying.

I'd give this torrent an F (as FAIL) !"
,razorraj,2011-02-28T03:56Z,Use KM player..works good for me...
,OMGnigga,2012-02-14T14:27Z,bwahaha HDTVrip in epic RMVB format. You guys are fucking geniuses!
