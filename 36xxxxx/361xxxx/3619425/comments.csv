,Chimairo,2007-02-16T10:07Z,"Next EP is the last. Ashame but true..

I knew from the start. Josh Schwartz ran the show to the ground by writing marisha off, and got desperate and started to exprimente with the camera etc. for exemple... starting the show with a happening like that earthquake... the rewinding it to 24 hours before or whatever it was.
Josh Schwartz created it, still i blame him that it ends like this.

THANX for the ep."
