The Swedish Police have permission to sniff/read/listen on network/phone trafik to prevent unnatural porn sutch as Childporn, incest, animal (maby in a wile animal), rape etc etc.

It is extremly easy to detect locate and read traffik on the net. They just use programs as Optnet, wireshark and sniffer pro. (Read about this) 

I am telling you this to give you a chance to stop this. Shore public shower cam is exating, but prob not leagal. Stop sharing this shit, Swedish police have the right to trace outside sweden aswell! They prob already have MAC, IP and your names, but they cant use non of them becouse of one reason. It was never leagal to listen to the trafic before.

Once again, remove all dumb material on TPB manly.

But OFC KEEP other porns for me ;)"

,weezul_fenderson,2007-02-25T12:24Z,"I'm sure real rape video is illegal in most westewrn countires.  And hopefully interpol makes sure that men appearing in real rape videos are convicted.  However, this ain't a real rape video since Gauge is a porn star!

Anyway, this video isn't even porn, it's just Gauge dressed up as a little girl & some scary guy looking through a window at her for 2 min."

,boogerbutt69,2007-11-04T04:28Z,"Uh, hey RSL_Mongoloid?  ""Swiss"" means from Switzerland, not from Sweden.  There's no such thing as a Swedish army knife.  I guess you don't learn geography in those ""special"" classes..."
,steffan664,2007-11-06T14:08Z,"Actually, there is a ""Swedish knife"" used by the army, it is made by a company called Frost and is a very nice, inexpensive knife."
