,Hojibad,2008-07-17T06:27Z,"What quality are you playing to upload them in? If you do start, how long do you guess approximately.

Just curious if it will be an upgrade from this one."
,WalrusMongler,2009-04-06T09:01Z,"This made me so angry, besides it taking me about a month and a half to download; I open it and for some dumb reason after I read everyone's comments, I was hoping it would all be in Japanese with English subs. But no It's all in English with very obnoxious and inaccurate dubs. Fuck this torrent."
,h1vem1nd,2009-04-07T10:57Z,"Maybe you should have read the comments better, WalrusMongler.
And the file info might have helped you, too.

Before you start whining, take a moment to actually read more than 3 or 4 words.

Anyway, I found the dubs to be accurate enough; it's sometimes a pain to have to read the subtitles, anyway. I'll DL an English dub of the 3rd OVA from another torrent, I think."
,blessphemy,2009-08-15T20:51Z,thank you thank you! english or not fuck it its tenchi!!!
,blessphemy,2009-08-15T20:53Z,p.s. dont fucking complain about what your getting if its FREE....assholes
,Veind,2009-09-12T05:12Z,I'm honestly a fan of subbed videos but this download is great if you love dubbed videos. Best tenchi muyo on the site. Can we get one on here that is dubbed?... ill definitely download that one.
,darthellisd,2009-09-26T20:57Z,its a shame would be nice if it was in an avi format cant watch it on my 360 means i dont download it
,sukotsutsu,2009-11-26T01:52Z,"you know people, these files are mkv and ogm format, that means that if you spent the time to go into your filters and select the secondary audio stream and turn on the subtitles you could watch it subbed. honestly why the hell do you think the fandom started using those formats in the first place. its because they support multiple audio streams and the standard formats dont"

,bigj2002,2011-11-28T05:09Z,Missing the original Tenchi Muyo series. Just letting everyone know. 
,bigj2002,2011-11-28T05:22Z,"nm ""in tokyo"" was the first one. just ignore me..."
,KillerSpecialK,2012-02-03T01:59Z,"Everything is here. Except for the very last episode of OVA 3, called Final Confrontation. I haven't watched all of it yet, but i'm pretty sure it's not there since it was technically a ""special"". Sucks cause this episode ties up the entire story. Someone prove me wrong or show me a place to download it. It is on youtube though...

As far as an order to watch them....
-OVA file which has ova 1 ((watch movie Daughter of Darkness after episode 6))and 2
-OVA 3
-GXP
-Universe
-The other 2 movies
-Tokyo
-Mihoshi Special
-Sammy"
,KillerSpecialK,2012-02-03T04:00Z,I take back the Daughter of Darkness comment. Watch all 3 movies after Universe. >_
