,blackleotard,2007-02-13T15:25Z,"There is a problem with the audio, LordDragor.  It is encoded badly (MP3? why?) and can cause an error on some players.  Mine worked OK with the CCCP codec pack."
,tiquisito,2007-02-13T17:03Z,"I can´t get any audio and I have downloaded all the codecs necessary, including the new Xvid codecs, still no luck, any help, please?"

,mpomy72,2007-02-16T00:04Z,I want to burn this to a DVD- without having sound synch issues.  How can I do that?
,Azilect,2007-02-17T15:34Z,"Something odd with the audio - vocals muffled but still listenable. Using VLC but same with Quicktime.

Not the greatest of episodes - a bit of a filler
