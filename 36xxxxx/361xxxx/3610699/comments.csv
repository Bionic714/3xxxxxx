,andba836,2007-02-07T05:45Z,"When selecting the .cue file in daemon tools, I got an error message saying that the file was busy. Turned out to be a misspelling of the .bin-file name in the cue-file. "
,Serria,2007-02-07T12:52Z,"to fix the cue file so it works properly,  rename both the bin and cue file to goldium.bin and goldium.cue
that will take care of the errror,  works great.  thanks"

,Darkk_Nights,2008-03-31T00:47Z,"Man, It does't work for me. When I try to mount with Daemon Tools, there's a message saying: ""Unable to mount image. File not accessible.""
How can I solve this?"
,Darkk_Nights,2008-03-31T00:52Z,"Ok, it's solved. That's what I did:

-Opened 'goldium-srk.cue' with notepad;
-At the very start of the file, where it says 'FILE ""GOLDIUM.BIN""', substituted it for 'FILE ""GOLDIUM-SRK.BIN""'.

Thanks!"
,double.ott,2008-06-02T14:16Z,"Im sorry for this comment, but I am very new to the whole mounting thing.  Could someone give me some descriptive instructions on doing this whole thing?
thanks a ton!!"
,adnandemir,2008-06-24T14:50Z,seed please
,taiiat,2008-08-18T18:08Z,"double.ott,
go to http://www.daemon-tools.cc/ and download daemon tools, then you download this torr(ent), and then open the torr, and tell daemon tools to mount the .cue file after fixing this weird mistake in the file ;). then you install like you have the disc. "
,xdorsih,2008-09-22T00:02Z,"Darkk_Nights:
Yes, that does fix it, but a significantly easier fix is to just rename the .bin and .cue to Goldium. Much easier than editing the files themselves."
,Neidig,2008-09-22T02:28Z,"I need help - here's all I got:

mge-retailproof1-srk (a picture of the game disk)
mge-retailproof2-srk (a picture of the game case)
mge-retail-srk (???)
mge-retail-srk.(17 files that end in "".r00"" to ""r16"") (???)
mge-retail-srk.rar (??? don't know how to open rar...)
mge-retail-srk.sfv

I read that there were problems with .bin or .cue files... I have deamon tools ... but I don't see any ""Goldium"" files or any files with .cue or .bin...

Any help would be appreciated.
"
,Kjetil94,2008-10-28T15:05Z,I need cd key for this game !!! Does someone have one?
,djelectro,2009-09-11T22:16Z,"thank you very much 
free software f***ing own"
,MAXlBON,2011-10-09T14:43Z,"**INSTALL, open the download and unzip the zipped folder within the folder, change each of these names to just goldium.cue / golduim.bin instead of goldium-srk...

mount the .cue file with deamon tools and play the flash file wich is listed as start"
,Scyrthis,2012-04-12T15:49Z,"Umm, Whoopy, i see that this takes 250 mb, but the other torrents i see takes 70 mb, what's different with this one?"
