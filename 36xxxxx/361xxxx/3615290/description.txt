Hi guys, and thanks for watching.

This movie was supposed to be my own movie, but suddenly, my friends came up to me "Oh, I made this frag, and that frag, put it in your movie!" Soon after, the movie was more of my friends than me, so I decided to make it an 'insider-movie' - Only with the danish topplayers which are my friends :p

I've been working on this movie since May 2006, so the clans present may not exist anymore / Have other players. Some of the clips have a blue hud, which I played with shortly back then, its removed now, but I couldnt do it from the clips, so bear with it :D

Every clip with the "Danish ===-*" tag is the danish national team.

The players starring now plays in following clans:

krogh, jerome, orga and vnG = #Copenhagen-eSport
h0lm, inCre and rytme = #rl:rejects
