However, this shouldn't be labeled PROPER. LOL was first releasing this."

Thanks for upload :)"
,r0tt3n,2007-02-12T19:13Z,"Question:  What is more ignorant?  Pointing out a mistake and calling for it to be corrected, or telling the person who pointed that out that they are ignorant for doing so.  Sorry, but you're the asshole here fukal.  I'm just doing my civic duty for the scene."
,drslobb,2007-02-13T09:22Z,Seth have made 5 production seasons. When it fucks up is in season four. becouse Seth made one seasons while Fox wanted it as two season and made a long brake in the middle of season four. therefor it is 5 prod. ses. and 6 seasons
