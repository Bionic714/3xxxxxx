,cagerage,2007-02-06T23:53Z,"yeah, but it's the rar file that is corrupted in the entire dvdr, and that's mentioned in the d/l box. So, maybe you'll get the ""Douchebag Mouthpiece"" award. BTW, what's a price? Genius."
,Tiny Turtle ,2007-02-07T07:50Z,lol@MattiP - keep the price for yourself!
,vizzer,2007-02-10T03:02Z,"Someone who got the file that NOT are corrupted??

Who wants to download ""The corrupted r41 file""??  lol.. "

This IS the good (uncorrupted) r.41 file.

Thank you Cagerage!
