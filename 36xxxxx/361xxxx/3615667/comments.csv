,slacker41,2007-02-12T05:09Z,"Actually it can be done in the USA as well. One just has to follow their procedure for getting a new social security number.

This is a one time shot though, it can only be done once in a persons life."

,slacker41,2007-02-22T23:31Z,"They don't track you by your date of birth you dildo...lol...

They track you by your SSN idiot, which can be legally changed and not reporte to the credit agencies, can't you fucking read?????"
,Mike727,2009-03-02T04:10Z,can you seed this please? I'm interested to read it!
,caaach,2009-12-12T06:04Z,its feasable in the us but i would like to hear from someone that accually applied this.  You can get a replacement number if fraud is suspected to be extensivly dammaging. But do they link them??? intresting read. slacker was at least thinking a little...
,Truth333,2011-04-23T06:28Z,"I got a new SS#. There are a few pitfalls. 
#1. being 35 years old w/o a credit history gets plenty of attention. Most people thought I was in the witness protection program. 

#2. No credit is the same as bad credit.

#3. Everyone is finger printing. When they do, if you have EVER been finger printed-both identities MERGE. A real pisser. 

#4. Any and ALL education is lost-at least the transcripts. With an Ivy League degree, I had to get a G.E.D. and lost all of the benefits of my educational credentials.  "
