,harigata,2008-12-19T19:53Z,"Watched it with a friend and didn't like it. I loved Ivan Grozny (I & especially II), but in Nevsky the reek of putrid patriotism blocked out all other impressions for me. Maybe I should watch it again & try to ignore what they're saying (Stalin's heavy hand....), concentrating on HOW it is done.

BTW - Nevsky never opposed the Golden Horde. Because: I) it would have been futile and II) he'd have rather had the Horde's patronage against the west than participate in the rickety western alliances, risking the Horde's wrath and knowing his 'allies' won't help him in such an hour of need."
,harigata,2008-12-19T19:57Z,"The way the movie tells it - ""we will fight and defeat all invaders"" is bullshit. Russians were fighting as much amongst themselves in those days as against polities of other nations. And a small state could never survive on its own - it needed allies.

The last has actually been true all throughout history."

,bookstackerbob,2012-01-20T20:04Z,"schnitzelfritz666 is so angry because Alexander Nevsky ditched so many of his compatriots who otherwise surely would have done to the Russsians the same what they did to the unknown presently Lithuanian tribe Prusses, whose name 'schnitzelfritzes' so brazen-facedly appropriated tothemselves."
