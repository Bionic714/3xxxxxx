,BloodGulch,2007-03-19T18:04Z,"alltså cracket ligger på skivan!
gå in i den här datorn och högerklicka på SimsLS (cd/dvd-enheten) och sedan öppna.
gå sedan in i mappen crack.
öppna en till den här datorn, klicka dig fram till där sims är installerat. (Standard: C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\The Sims Livets Historier)
klicka in på TSBin.
Kopiera över 'SimsLS.exe' från crackmappen på cd:n, till TSBin-mappen på hårddisken.
Sen är det crackat. Du kan nu starta spelet.
Lätt som en plätt!"

,tom1181,2007-06-26T18:55Z,"excuse my language, but ihave looked at a couple of pics of this game, and i was wondering, whats the fucking difference between this and sims 2? i dont see the point in this!"
,tatterdemalion,2007-07-03T03:28Z,"Yes, it works.

After downloading:

1) Extract the .rar files (they'll become a single ISO file).

2) Mount the ISO with Daemon Tools.

3) Install it.  Serials given by someone in an earlier comment here:
2FWE-7VJC-YSJM-WYSJ-RRLD
AGPX-MGNZ-7SAR-27SA-VRLD
AMR9-ZSM9-Y7AR-ZY7A-VRLD
SWS2-58D2-XWAG-MXWA-LRLD
S92S-58KG-34JN-334J-SRLD

4) Don't try to play it yet after that; you'll only get an error message saying to insert the proper DVD.  

Go to My Computer and right-click on the mounted ISO in the virtual drive. Select 'Explore'.  You'll see a folder called Crack.  Open it.

5) Copy the SimsLS exe file. 

6) Go to your C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/The Sims Life Stories/TSBin folder and paste it there, overwriting the original SimsLS exe file.

7) Play!"
,emama92lovisa,2007-07-08T08:45Z,"1 . Mounta .iso filen med deamon tools eller alcohol120%

2. instalera spelet.. när installationen vill ha en cd-key öppnar du ""den här datorn"" utforskar enheten som heter Sims2_EP5_1 blablabla... du letar reda på Crack mappen och öppnar keygeneratorn... kopierar å harej...

3. när det är dags att spela kopierar du cracken, som är den andra filen i Crack mappen i .iso

4. klart att spela...

(glömde; cracken ska kopieras in i installations mappen för året runt, in i mappen TSBin.. där ersätter den en annan fil)"

,hplek,2008-01-26T17:55Z,"I opened the game and there was only tutor mode to choose. Then I got the error message, saying the game was crashed, when I tried to play the tutor mode
If you have the same problem with me. Here's the solution:
1. start>run 
 2. then type ""regedit"" 
3. look for: 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Electronic Arts/The Sims Life Stories 
At ""display name"" change from ""The Sims? Life Stories"" to ""The Sims Life Stories""

Finish! :3"
