,wankan,2007-02-19T15:49Z,"I can't upload the torrent for ep6 included with ep1 as thepiratebay says it's using an ""invalid tracker"" (same tracker as I've used for the 5 eps I've already upped but wtf do I know) so I have to create a new torrent for ep6 and use a different thepiratebay tracker ."
