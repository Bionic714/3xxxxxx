,EWare,2007-02-03T21:10Z,"I read the perl script from linuxgenuineadvantage.org - the comments in the code really made my day ;-) .. and the fact that you created a crack for this WGA spoof had me laughing out loud.

From the script: ""we're past the grace period. this most likely means the user is a criminal""

If you install Linux Genuine Advantage on your friends box I guarantee you he'll beat you to death with a shovel. Unless, of cource, you apply this patch (making the whole thing even more pointless)."
,BigRadi0Head,2007-02-03T22:22Z,"Linux crack,that's very ...... intersting
i hope it creates another crack in ur ass"
,unix_pro,2007-02-04T00:25Z,you must be an idiot...
,Plux,2007-02-04T19:37Z,"Well first things first about this. 
This is more a funny thing I found around, and well.
Look at it as a parody of a another popular system :)

And last, I did not create the crack, I just uploaded it, the guy over att alienos.com shall have the creds for it :)  "
,EWare,2007-02-05T23:38Z,"The joke is obvious IMO, at least if you read the code. Anyone who doesn't get it probably didn't take a close look.

I'm amazed someone actually took the time to write the thing ;)"
,jennysalala,2007-02-23T01:43Z,"your a joke PhXAnarchy. First you say why people pirate microsoft products, now you say shuns about microsoft. these aren't hate forums or even forums for that matter. go talk shit somewhere else. "
,goonz0r,2007-03-05T21:43Z,"haha, This is brilliant."
,mailnotwanted,2007-03-08T23:49Z,hahahaha 
,SeBas94,2007-04-29T20:45Z,Ă­sn't linux free? why would you use a crack for something that's free?
,neo2kdk,2007-05-04T01:54Z,"Feels good to use linux, heh ... they'll all learn some day ;)

Joke of the day =]"
,booster2k2,2007-08-29T21:05Z,someone please seed this! ;) :))
,cr00seffer,2008-03-01T04:57Z,"jennysalala, i didnt find phxanarchy's comment hateful or offensive as it seemed no one else but you, did. hes probably dead on about the win users comment and your comment probably verifies that. Perhaps you should practice what you preach and heed your own advice because we are entitled to our own opinion and you sound about as hypocritical as the very ppl he was commenting about. I think the linux genuine advantage is a great joke and like any joke you have to be able to see the forest for the trees. It  is designed for fun, and you cant define that."
