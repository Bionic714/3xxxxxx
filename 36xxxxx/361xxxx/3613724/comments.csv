,job_NL,2007-07-04T22:42Z,"great upload, including exspansion, 4 cd's, working crack, great torrent and great game :D"
,NeverRAR,2007-08-11T13:38Z,"No sound and/or game won't start is usually due to the lack of proper drivers. Make sure you have the latest drivers for both your sound- and videocard as well as the latest version of DirectX (I believe it's 9.0c June 2007 update as of right now). The DirectX part is really important, and more so that it really is the latest release, since there are several updated packages of 9.0c.

A recommendation is that you DO NOT install the expansion packages, becuase I've realized that the expansion packs are really buggy (talking to the wrong person at the wrong time can prevent you from being able to complete the game). I know, since it happened to me personally. :("
,TIPoland,2007-08-18T14:47Z,"It seems that crack provided on disc nr1, doesn't work. In addition I received few meassages about suspicious code contained in those files. 
 But I checked out the crack from gamecopyworld and I can confirm that version 1.32 works well. 
Thx HollySeed
Have a nice play."
,job_NL,2007-08-27T16:16Z,"i just burned all 4 images to cd, then i installed all 4 cd's (incl. night of the raven) on my computer, then i copied the crack files from cd 1 to the game map (in the game map is an other map ""system"" you have to copy the files there, like ""C:\Program Files\JoWooD\Gothic II\system "") and everything worked fine... so it seems the crack works. (i haven't got a fast pc, but here are the specs: 1.33 Ghz, 512MB RAM, ATI Radeon 8500 with 64MB and a Creative soundblaster soundcard) i hope it can help you, because it is a great game! and.... dont mind my english, i'm dutch :P"

4: As the game SHOULD start now, but the dialogue sound and text will disappear, you will have to change the file endings of two files:
