,Tiny Turtle ,2007-02-13T20:08Z,Danish subs indicate a Nordic release so why remove the rest of the nordic languages while keeping Arabic and Hebrew?
,arnold1965,2007-02-13T21:49Z,"Tiny Turtle:

luczi gets the movies from another torrent site and just uploads them here, so that's why. 
luczi hasn't made the movie, just copied them from other sites."
,WildFlowerx,2007-02-14T02:47Z,"Thank you so much for  this (and for the Portuguese subs)!
I just wish I could leran how to upload a torrent so I could share some of the movies I own here."
,AlienHand,2007-02-14T23:18Z,"Tiny Turtle:
I could say the same for movies with swe sub and NO danish  ... thats just stupid. Now you know how we fell ...
I would gues it's a muslim in denmark who has uploaded since the arabic+hebrew sub .. or just a random thing and there was no swe sub."

,Domino191191,2009-03-08T23:06Z,"If you want to upload, then get the ""maketorrent"".
Not so difficult then."
