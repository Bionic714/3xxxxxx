,netfire_,2008-08-01T21:04Z,"Good quality, great download speed. Thanx!"
,larosh,2008-10-01T16:32Z,"just to mention what bothered me and i couldn't find out until i finished the download: this is 2'17'' uncensored version, compared to FXG's 2'11'' censored one. in case you wondered...
and also, i don't have any complaints on the quality, considering the length of the movie. for a better quality, download bigger size torrents!
and finally: thanks, weasel!"
,daniel.d,2009-02-18T03:43Z,"exactly what i was looking for, nice!"
,Snacko0,2009-07-20T01:32Z,"It's a shame that Kubrick ended the story one chapter early, but this is still a fantastic, thoughtful adaptation of a fantastic, thoughtful novel."
,auguraeon,2009-07-31T22:26Z,I cannot see the movie - just hear the sound. Scene  seems pure gray. any idea why?
,auguraeon,2009-07-31T22:30Z,oop sorry - I found the source of the problem - shows great now - thanks
,iShare4u,2009-08-17T06:30Z,"Thank you for this! I have this on VHS, but have been wanting it on DVD for ages!

Just a head's up regarding English subtitles -- These worked very well for me:

http://subscene.com/a-clockwork-orange/subtitles-10.aspx

Just look for ""English"", uploaded by Bassemrr.

I only watched the 1st half of the movie, and those subtitles lined up with the scenes very well. Occasionally, a few words were omitted, but nothing major.

I'm going to watch the movie in its entirety now, so if I find anything funky with those subs, I'll let y'all know. :)

Thanks again, iamweasel, for this wonderful classic!"
