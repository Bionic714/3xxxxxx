,supergrease,2008-03-04T18:29Z,the cdkey is all over internet...
,D3vel,2008-03-16T00:10Z,its a VLK so its ok whereas if you install a pre sp2 version of 2k3 you cannot install sp2....which is what has led me to this torrent :)
,dukysta,2008-04-01T01:21Z,Tnx 32 bit it is at works like a clock. If you are looking for win 2003 server then this is it.
