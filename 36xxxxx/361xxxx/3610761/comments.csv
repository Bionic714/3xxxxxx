,Glenn74,2007-02-21T01:38Z,"This movie is corrupt. My DVD player freezes before it reaches the menu, and I had to unplug it. It was not possible to copy the burned files back to the computer either, as CRC sectors prevented that. Anyone else had this problem?

I tried to burn with Nero, everything went fine then."
,trixiehobbit,2007-02-22T20:54Z,"@Glenn

Burn it with DVD Decrypter and it will work nicely."
