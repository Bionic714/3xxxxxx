THIS VERSION WILL ONLY WORK WITH WINDOWS VISTA SO DON'T TRY INSTALLING IT ON EARLIER VERSIONS OF WINDOWS BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK.


This torrent was previously posted however it contained adware
so I removed the adware, repacked it and have now uploaded it for your stress free enjoyment.

Feel free to check for adware/spyware but you won't find any... now :-)


The previous torrent had an adware program embedded in a fake setup.exe file.  The fake setup.exe file was actually a self extracting executable that would launch the adware program silently in the background and install symantec antivirus so if you didn't know better you would think you were ok when you were actually getting infected at the same time you were installing something that was supposed to protect you... disappointing, I know.

So, what I did was use WinRAR to extract the TRUE setup.exe file from the fake one and replace the fake one and then repacked it for your stress free enjoyment.

Here's how to install this
First off, it doesn't need a serial key in order to be installed so no need to ask for one.
Second, just use a program like WinRAR or WinZip to extract the contents of the .zip file.
Go to the folder
\SAVVISTA
look for setup.exe and run it

easy as pie :-D

You will of course need to download the lates virus definition updates from Symantec after the installation is complete.


AGAIN I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THIS VERSION WILL ONLY WORK WITH WINDOWS VISTA SO DON'T TRY INSTALLING IT ON EARLIER VERSIONS OF WINDOWS BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK.

Feel free to ask me any questions but I think this is pretty self explanatory.
