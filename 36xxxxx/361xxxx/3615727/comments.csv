,trikkievic,2007-05-27T16:26Z,"Did not play audio in bsplayer pro with codecs installed. Installed k-lite codec pack and played in windows media classic. That worked fine. (Even though GSPOT said it should have worked in bsplayer as well, but it only played video, no audio.) so, use windows media classic player. good quality movie."

,Tomek84a,2010-12-27T07:31Z,"ToeringsandThongZ: Yes, rar files are definitely less convenient than a single avi file. To unrar them (make an avi file from many rar files): 
1. Download and install 7-zip program 
2. Right click first rar file (rar or r01 or r00), choose ""7-zip"", then choose ""Unpack here"". Then a window should pop up with an information about progress, after it finishes you can play avi file and delete rar files."
,Tomek84a,2010-12-27T07:54Z,"Update: You should right click rar file, not r00 or r01. At least with 7-zip."
,doubleKO,2011-04-05T13:53Z,"Thanks olav.  If it is, you gave away the ending you fucking tool."
