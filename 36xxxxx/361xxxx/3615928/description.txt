The Convent of Hell

Noe & Barreiro

A convent in Spain. Nuns going about their routine in the name of God. But all is not quite as it seems. There are cracks on the surface. Some nuns seem to harbor secret lusts for each other. Then there's an accident in the cellar revealing a very old condemned door found on no plan. One of the less holy nuns has a satanic nightmare about it. She decides to find out. What she unleashes is an unholy bedlam of depravity and lust! Beautifully painted and full of very raw sexual energy!
