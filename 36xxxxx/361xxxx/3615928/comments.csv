The thing is that I first tried to include all images in a zip file before I created the torrent, but it was impossible to upload the torrent afterwards. I don't know what the problem is, maybe thepiratebay server can't handle torrents with zip files in them? I don't know.

Anyway, I decided to use the folder instead of the zip file when creating the torrent, and I forgot to change the text before I uploaded it."
