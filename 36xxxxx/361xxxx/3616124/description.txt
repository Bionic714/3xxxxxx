The Ultimate in Top Trumps!

Did you ever want to see a match between the all-time top wrestling legends? Well now you can with Top Trumps. Nowhere else could you get Big Daddy against Hulk Hogan.

Where else could you get possible match ups between the Mega-weights of soap? Yes, you heard it, Fred Elliot may be able to beat Frank Butcher on Girth, but how well would he do on hair? Surley Carlos Valderama has the edge in that category?

The all time greats in this game include Mr. T, The Fonz, and of course the Ultimate Legend, the Hoff!

Not forgetting the likes of Steve Irwin, Kermit the Frog and of course the insurpassible, invicible and uneclipsable Don King.

All of this adds up to what will surely be, the best game of top trumps ever made!
