Those who are having problems do the following

1) After downloading it mount it with daemon tools (you can get it at www.daemon-tools.cc) 

2) The cd-keys are located in the reloaded folder in the DVD image

3) After Installation is complete go to BF2 DVD Image>Reloaded>Crack and copy Battlefield 2.exe and the .dll file and paste it into main folder of Battlefield 2 it will ask for replacement say yes.

Thats it enjoy the game"
,jp_aligator,2007-05-30T16:52Z,"Bara ni följer istruktionerna som funkar det oftast bra.  (^_^)

1. Ladda ner BF 2 (Torrent) 
2. Starta med daemon-tools
3. instalera spelet
4. Kopiera crack filen som lokaliserar i Crack directory på DVD:n för din istalations directory
5. Spela spelet

Viktigt: Deamons tools och winrar behövs!

you need to find out your video cards refresh rate and go into your battlefield 2 folder in ""My documents"", find the user folder and go into the settings folder. you will see an ini file called video, open it and look for hwre it displays the refresh rate and change it to the correct refresh rate, save the ini file and overwrite the old one.

Ofcourse you can play online but not on the EA server as flo1989 said he is right about this... 
BUT there is a program which kinda converts the LAN into INTERNET but your friends needs this program also to play with you..
What I am saying is that your playing in the LAN but your playing trough the INTERNET...

Youll need to search the program in google or something since I don't remember the name of it... I really dont remember what the name was but I could search for it. 
NOTE: I didnt earn anything telling you this ;)

EDIT: I didn't find the program I used but I found this one instead I am not sure how it works but you could try it out. 

Search for ""LAN IM2001Server"" on google then youll probably find it :)"

Jag måste ju ta å kommentera det här eftersom jag själv just har problemet. För det första Finns det en exakt likadan torrent här: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3808010/Battlefield_2

Och visst kan det fungera, prova att söka på www.justfuckinggoogleit.com efter tillexempel Battlefield 2 crack. Så svårt är det. 

OBS: 
Om ni får en svart skärm
1. Gå in i Mina dokument\Battlefield 2\Profiles\Default
2. Öppna Video.con med anteckningar
3. Här kan du kolla Resolution, och dessutom lite annat. Du kollar grejer på grafikkortet såhär: Högerklicka på skrivbordet, välj egenskaper > Inställningar. Klicka på Avancerat, sedan på fliken BILDSKÄRMSKORT. Jag hade exempelvis Ati Radeon 9000 på 128 MB. 

Kollar vi runt lite efter SYSTEMKRAV på spelet hittar man följande: 
- Minimikonfiguration:
  Processor: 1,7 Ghz
  RAM: 512 MB
  Grafikkort: NVidia GeForce FX 5700, ATI Radeon 8500 eller ATI Radeon 9500

Längre ner hittas följande. 
- Rekommenderad konfiguration:
  Processor: 2 Ghz Pentium 4
  RAM: 1 GB
  Grafikkort med minst 256 MB RAM-minne.

Nu borde min dator och grafikkort kanske palla detta, men det verkar inte så. Se efter själv.

heres what you can do. You can just install it on a decent flash drive. you can play the game through the flash drive. or even better. Get one of those passport harddrives from western digital. they have a feature that will allow you to boot from them (most hard drives can do this now) and then have the game on there. Then all you have to do is connect it via firewire or usb 2.0. any slower and it will suck. 

hope this helps you brainstorm better ideas.

Good news is, well, it works.  Full version and im able to get online multiplayer.  Don't install a .exe fix, punkbuster will get ya.   just mount fixed image no. 3 posted on gamecopyworld and BF2 will load up.  

Bad news is that i am unable to play any ranked servers with the chevron icons.  This game is only 9.99 now so ill prob just end up buying it if i actually think its fun after a few times.

fyi - keygens are always trojans to norton anti-virus and the like, because its software intended to hack, they flag it as trojans.  Never once have i d/l a keygen from a good release group (paradox, 1911, razor, etc) that actually was a virus.  So all you dolts continue crying its a trojan.  

Join the countless thousands of other posts on every other game torrents comments with similar un-informed nit-wits who think the hacked exe and keygens actually cause harm to anyone but the software maker. "

,coffe_94,2009-02-01T11:17Z,Is the crack OK? Or is it a virus?
,trex1210,2009-02-03T09:41Z,"I downloaded and installed patch 1.41 and when I go to start the game it crashes back to desktop after like 3 seconds of a black screen. Anyone know how to fix this?
I used to have this game but my disc got scratched really bad so I have to use the ISO and my cd is legit. "
,lmctrials,2009-02-03T21:16Z,"For anyone who is having problems go to gamecopyworld.com it will tell you what to do...

you must install the official 1.41 patch first from somewhere then download the 1.41 no dvd crack from gamecopyworld.com and copy to game directory replacing the old exe. there you go have fun...

is there anyway to play online though??."
,purekana,2009-02-03T21:59Z,is this crack really working and where can is that mini disc image found :S this isn't first torrent that im downloading and i will ask too that can i play this game with my bro (LAN) ps.

,trex1210,2009-02-03T23:49Z,"thanks for the help lmctrials. To purekana, the crack is located in the ISO in the Reloaded folder. Mount with dameon tools then click on ""open folder to view files"" then open reloaded folder. Copy into game directory and there you go. Hope that helps. "
,lmctrials,2009-02-04T10:42Z,"Right everyone you must download the official patch from somewhere just google battlefield 2 official patch 1.41 , then after running the patch go to GAMECOPYWORLD.COM and look for battlefield 2 no DVD crack 1.41, extract the crack using winrar and Copy to your game directory located In /c , programfiles/EA/battlefield 2.  note the crack in the reloaded file will not work you must follow the steps above and it should work,, the game is quality!!

,jegernorsk,2009-03-09T20:12Z,"now i am going to give all u noobs who doesn't get a fucking shit about anything a little ""help"" that contains every little step:

1. download torrent
2.download daemon tools and mount it by clicking on daemon tools>mount image>battlefield 2
3.install it
4.serials are in the a file in the bf2 WinRar file:
RELOADED>bf2_serials.txt and voila! or just use this one:EMS2-F7SC-FJDJ-TM5X-3PR4
5.go to the same file (RELOADED) and click on the file ""crack"". there it should be some files and one bf2.exe i think. copy that one and go to my computer>programfiles>EA games>battlefield 2 and put it there.
6. make a shortcut on the desktop.
7.play
8.have fun!

PS! this is excactly how i did it and it worked fine so you should do the same unless you still wanna be here complaining about the lousy torrent..."

1. How players play  it legally??
answer. With original DVD.
2. If you want to play with no Original DVD you need deamon tools and 2 files:
    1.  BF2 DVD_MINI.MDF
    2.  BF2 DVD_MINI.MDS

,waqs1989,2012-07-16T08:07Z,"It is working. If you have trouble, read this:

For people with ""insert cd"" problem, it mean you have not crack it.
1. use daemon or anything to mount
2. install
3. check the contain of the iso in your virtual drive using right click and explore
4. open reloaded folder
5. copy the exe and dll file
6. paste it to C:Program FilesEA GAMESBattlefield 2
7. rewrite the old one
8. play it using the new bf2.exe

for the black screen problem, it mean your computer does not meet the requirement spec.
1. download swiftshader (google it guys! i recommend using the version 2)
2. you will got 2 folder x64 and x86
3. copy the .dll file in x86 folder
4. paste it in C:Program FilesEA GAMESBattlefield 2
5. run the game and pray it work"
