I tried the demo of Arma released before christmas, it was really awful.  I can't believe the english version will be much better since the programmers were too lazy to create a modern game engine.  Arma uses the original Flashpoint engine and that's just not acceptable."

First, install WinRAR from http://www.rarlabs.com

When your download it finished, go to your
Download section, where the torrent downloaded to.

Then, you should see pro-aras.r00 in that folder.

Move that .rar to your desktop.

Open up Daemon Tools.
Right click Daemon Tools at the bottom right corner of your screen.

Click ""Virtual CD/DVD-ROM""
Click ""Device 0: [ LETTER:] No Media""
Click ""Mount Image""

Browse and find your .RAR you extracted to your desktop.

Double click on it.

It should automatically install from here.

If you need any more help, just comment. =)"
