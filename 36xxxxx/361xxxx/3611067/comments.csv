,standOnIT,2007-02-06T00:25Z,"Hi tejash ! 
if You have problems with rar-files you should probably download something like: http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable 
if You have any problem with any file just go to 
http://filext.com/detaillist.php?extdetail=rar 
Just switch the last letters 'rar' to what ever extension the problem-file have..!
