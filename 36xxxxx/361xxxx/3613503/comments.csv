I have never seen people go crazy for a torrent on Dime like this one. Seriously at this point there are 2500 peers. That's more peers than there are for the latest episode of ""Lost"". The most downloaded torrent on Dime _ever_ has only been grabbed 5,500 times, and that's in THREE YEARS.


well this here torrent has out done that !

13001 downloads !

and that is in 6 months !


so if you still believe the conspiracy against me by

jon naurin, walk, deiter ,drew fignar, rolf maurer and the rest of the zappaqueers 

then your either deaf or just fucking dumb !



TIME TO COME CLEAN YOU FOLKS ARE RUINING THE ZAPPA COMMUNITY !

MAYBE WHEN ONE OF YOUR TORRENTS IS DOWNLOADED 15000 TIMES 

SOMEONE WILL TAKE YOU SERIOUS

BUT AS FOR NOW THE FOLKS THAT TAPE THESE SHOWS THINK YOU ARE SCUM !
