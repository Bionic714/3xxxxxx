[b]El retorno de Don Camilo[/b]
 Trying to avoid major clashes with the communist mayor and for happiness of this one, the bishop decides to send Don Camilo to a new and distant parish. But in the village they want to construct a dike and the owner of the lands refuses. Probably only the strong personality of the priest will be able to persuade the landowner. Will it be accepted by the pride of the mayor Pepone?
