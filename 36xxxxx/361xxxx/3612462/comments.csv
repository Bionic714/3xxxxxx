,spok70,2007-02-06T21:25Z,"Thanks Clony_patcher!

This version works with my 64 bit version ;)

It also more easy to use thi one!"
,Postal76,2007-02-06T22:37Z,"I followed the directions and instead of freezing my timer, I got a message on startup that said my trial period was over!  What the hell???  This hasn't happened with any other cracks I've tried, so I'd have to say that this one sucks."
,adam0606,2007-02-06T22:39Z,"After using this crack, is it ok to turn on automatic update?"
,jamicque,2007-02-06T22:59Z,"does windows update work after that??
and does any windows update f**** this putch up??"
,Postal76,2007-02-07T00:04Z,"Oops, my bad.  This crack DOES work, but you have to make sure you run it from a completely fresh install of Vista.

Now, can time synchronization be turned back on?  And can I use Windows Update?"
,Postal76,2007-02-07T03:17Z,"I mean, you can try it to see if it works, just be prepared if you have to reinstall Vista.  When I first tried it, I hadn't applied any cracks yet, all I had done was browse the web and download a few updates that I thought were ""safe"" -- and it didn't work.

If you follow the instructions exactly, it should work, and the timer will never count down from 43200 minutes."
,dkitzman,2007-02-07T19:40Z,"well I have tried a couple dif ways to crack so I will tell you. If you do the bios crack without updates you will be fine. If you happen to fuck up and update like I did, look for a rearming program. or go into regisrty and change key values. the command is like slmgr -rearm... you can only do this 3 times unless you change registry then you can keep on doing it. Thats where I am at and I can download all updates... so It works pretty good. don't get discouraged fellow pirates. keep on hacking away!"
,Postal76,2007-02-07T20:08Z,"Well, the crack stopped working.  Initially it would NEVER count down from 43200, even after running Windows Update.  Then it started counting down, but the timer would reset upon restarting my computer.  Now the timer ALWAYS counts down.  I really don't think any of these cracks work.

Would rearming every 30 days have the same effect?"
,maksimAMD,2007-02-08T22:23Z,i got instaling failed whot i do now
,AlNaDmY,2007-02-10T05:12Z,Hey after using crack can u use updates?
,666md666,2007-02-12T22:04Z,can someone give me a product key for windows vista premium?
,Sanicle,2007-02-13T16:42Z,"I have used this crack and it works like a charm. once installed I took the risk of allowing all automatic updates since I'm running dual boot, and nothing has detected my copy of vista as illegal. I even used the genuine software validation tool, and it told me my copy was legal too. Thanks so much!"
,clony_patcher,2007-02-14T17:58Z,"I suggest you to download the new version:

,clony_patcher,2007-03-04T21:29Z,"Good news for us!
For x86 windows vista (32 bit) there is a new my crack that really activate your Vista.

NO Timerstopper
NO modify your Vista bootloader!

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3631799/Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator.4st.March-CLoNY

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY' 
you can install the new one with no problem without fresh installation.

If you have installed 'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.1-CLoNY' or
'Windows.Vista.Crack.Activation.Beta.2' you can use Vista Manager Pro
to rebuilt the bootloader and than you can apply the new one.

Download the software:
http://www.vistabootpro.org

Guide:
In Vista Manager Pro select 'BootLoader', select 'Reinstall the original bootloader'
and then click 'Apply'.

For x64 Windows Vista (64bit) I suggest, for now, to continue to use
'Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY'

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3618299/Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86.x64.Final.Crack-CLoNY

,Breadfan866,2007-03-19T20:20Z,CloNY rules.
,Schizzo,2007-06-09T16:56Z,"The only way for this crack to stop working is to enable integirty checks (this can be done either by a program, or by windows itself if they fail to start for some reason). To disable integrity checks open an administrative command prompt and type bcdedit /set {current} loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS.

Also this crack doesnt work if you have apply the crack with the beta keys which gets you into evaluation periods and possible if you have apply any other cracks."

,"chad10,000",2007-12-03T04:02Z,"Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator Is OEM emulating
hardware-embedded BIOS ACPI_SLIC license information of so called ?Royalty OEMs?.
   BUT BELOW IS A LINK TO A MUCH BETTER PROGRAM WITH NO EMULATING NEEDED, AND IT CAN ALSO WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO DO A CLEAN INSTALL. 
  ""Crack for Windows Vista All Versions""

""It is necessary to install Windows without CD key.
This Crack does not block the period of validity, but gives a real licence to Windows, a key, and makes it valid.
It is completely operational.
It must be running with the Administrator privileges to work, and must be run 2 times, while starting again once between the two.""
