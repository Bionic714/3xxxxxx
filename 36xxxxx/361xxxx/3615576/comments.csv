,Revanant,2009-06-18T23:46Z,Great torrent! A/V is good quality and in sync. Thanks!
,Sublime865,2011-02-13T02:40Z,"I'm no fan of WMV either, it IS a waste, for the same quality I can get a better codec to make a file half the size. 

I don't think anyone was criticizing the uploader (whom without him and others like, would be no TPB) but the ancient codec used for this video. And that isn't a hit to the uploader either, maybe he got the file like that. Maybe that's all his software supported for a transcode, I know I've been locked into using crappy codecs before because the input file was only supported by certain software... 

Again, props to the uploader for giving us all a laugh with good entertainment! And an upload is nothing without a good seed, so props again! "
