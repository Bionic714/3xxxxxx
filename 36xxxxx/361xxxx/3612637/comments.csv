I do everything acording to the instructions but i never get that warning i the systray so there´s nothing for me to allow... Any idea why this is happening to me ( or should i say ""not"" happening to me)

,XweAponX,2007-02-08T20:28Z,"Phxanarchy - I actually sympathise with your POV but seeing as how my clients are going to buy computers with this stupid POS OS I have to learn it and how to bypass the bullshit that's in it.

Maybe we can be more creative here? I agree that vista is worse than ME, and ME was so bad that they took it off the market in a year.

But that was because it had incredible flaws and crashed almost incessantly.

That is not the case with this though, it seems like it does not crash.

Anyway, I have downloaded about 10 diffrerent cracks some of the are the same as others. We need to find a way around all of the WGA and Activation Shite

,felix222,2007-02-09T10:40Z,"LINUX is easier?
What are You smoking?"
,XweAponX,2007-02-11T08:35Z,"buying an oem version of vista is not expensive at all. definitely worth the money to avoid these temporary cracks.

Say again? How is spending 400 bucks for s fucked OS less expensive than getting it for FREE from here?

Oh Yah: I guess I am sucking my ""selfs"" cos I think Vista sucks buttcracks from Norway to Nebraska.
"
,XweAponX,2007-02-11T08:37Z,"I just had the chance to fuckin try this out... as of today... It works GREAT. Still says 43200 hours left.

We'll see if tomorrow I have 29 daze left.

I got to back toi sucking some more ""selfs"" later."

,XweAponX,2007-02-12T22:53Z,"STILL says 43200 Minutes. Cool Beans. Even got a bunch of downloads,no problem whatsoever, M$ can kiss my arse.

This os SUCKS DOG BALLS- FUCK anyone wo is SHILLING for Micro$$$$$$$$oft.

It takes approximately 4 days to set it up so that it will fucntion without nagging you to deth, and then to top it off, it DETECTS my MIDI hardware, but refuses to let it WORK.

So, MS can SUCK Them ""Selfs"" - I have decided I will NEVER EVER pay for this fucking piece of shit.

This crack works great, whoever developed it deserves money. So when I get some I'll hunt the guy down and by god I'll pay HIM."
,The Hitman One,2007-02-14T00:21Z,"yeah vista is far beyond worst then ME everytime i fuckin start my pc i gotta disable that driver shit and my webcams aint working my sound card is incompatible , i cant fuckin voice chat becoz of some deep shit server tags .
vista is the shittiest OS wellit will be the best one after it will have a sp-2 and one more thing once you install vista its hard to install other OS becoz its fuckin with virtuall memory +cache of the machine yeah you might have to reset the bios or even worst unplug the cpu . VISTA ROCK ..S yeah it makes yoru pc a ROCK a still one no use"
,tsakaran,2007-02-15T10:15Z,"Crack works fine, but... Does it popup every time you start Vista? For me it does, and then I have to click FINISH... Is it possible to hide it or something, or do I have to fix something? Thanks anyway. Vista sure does look nice..."
,mulrich,2007-02-18T13:24Z,"XweAponX, you are an idiot.

He said the OEM version which is, what, 140 dollars?

$140 and no crack hassle > Free, (almost) no updates and crack hassle."
,Fregne,2007-02-18T17:14Z,"What a good laugh this is.

One says Vista is worse than the other.. and Microsoft sucks and so on.

Still, you all use oceans of time trying to get it to work without having to pay for it.

If its really that bad, why even try?

I bought the OEM, and up until this minute, I have had 0 problems. It supports every piece of hardware my computer has."
,Humba Magalo,2007-02-20T07:48Z,"Okay... I dunno if this works yet cuz I have yet to try it but I am installing the Retail Windows Vista and I dont plan on reformating SOOO I wanna know if this will work for what i need.

And also to all thouse people who are like
    ""Windows Vista is the worst OS ever""

I installed Windows Vista yesterday. For safety I partitionated a drive and installed it so I have both Vista and XP installed. My Vista works great, does'nt have any error or problems at all. But this crack does not work for me. when i trying I get this text in the log in the crack program:

I think you are the worst stupid guys in ""The pirated bay"" 
Guys , I think you are a fucking unfortunate peoples that do not  have enough money or can`t afford to buy a good video card and good hardware to run VISTA. And come here to talk bad about the OS.
Go and ask your Mama for some money and buy a good video card and 1GB Memory also get a genuine Vista in the store and run in your sisters`  boyfriend  computer and you will think different.
Still, you all use more than 3 months of time trying to get it to work without having to pay for it. 
Why do not Get the fuck out of here !! and get your FREE LINUX or MAC and do not ever come here.!!
If  its really that bad, why even try?  Why lose time in this shit?  If MS sucks why are you fucking idiots are still using PC?
You guys look like your sisters. When she say: ? Ho my boyfriend sucks, I do not like him anymore, I want to broke up with him. But when he sticks his dick in there, she turns out to be so happy and forgets everything. ?
Microsoft is the best!  It owns the world !!  Even if we like it or not.!
I?m using a pirated Vista at this moment whit 0 problem, and you know why I have 0 problems? Because I have 2GB of memory and a good hardware,, IDIOTS !!  
 But I am going to buy the Ultimate version this weekend when I get pay because It rocks and will rocks more when the service pack will come out! But when it come out I want to have the genuine version?
 I also do not like Microsoft because the software is so expensive. But I love the OS. Is the only one in the world that can run the thousands and thousands  of the best applications you can get, cracks, clones, videos, audio, games and more and more ..
Can you do that with Linux and Mac ?
If you answer Yes, Than you are a FUCKING beginner that use Windows just to play games, chat, and look porno in the internet, that means you have shit in your brain and DO NOT KNOW THE LIMITS OF THE COMPUTER WORLD?.!!"

,Soul_Traveller,2007-07-31T05:09Z,"WARNING: IF YOU USED THE TIME STOP CRACK LIKE I DID, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE FOLLOWING MICROSOFT UPDATE:

MSXML 4.0 SP2 Security Update (KB927978)

A vulnerability exists in Microsoft XML Core Services that could allow for information disclosure because the XMLHTTP ActiveX control incorrectly interprets an HTTP server-side redirect.

More information:

Help and Support: 
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927978

AFTER INSTALLING THIS UPDATE, MY CRACK WAS DISABLED AND TIME SHOWED 29 DAYS LEFT. I QUICKLY LOOKED IN ADD AND REMOVE PROGRAMS BUT DID NOT SEE THIS UPDATE, SO I DID A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH AND FOUND THIS LINK EXPLAINING HOW TO UNINSTALL IT:

http://help.lockergnome.com/windows/MSXML-SP2-Security-Update-KB927978-ftopict537590.html

THIS PERSON DID NOT HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AS MYSELF, BUT IT DID SHOW ME HOW TO UNINSTALL THE DAMN THING.

AFTER I UNINSTALLED THE UPDATE MY I WENT TO CHECK IF THE TIME STOP WAS BACK TO 30 DAYS BY DOING THE

START > RUN > slmgr.vbs -dlv CHECK,

BUT ALL I GOT WAS A RUNTIME ERROR.

I THEN TRIED REBOOTING AND THE CRACK WAS WORKING AGAIN SHOWING 30 DAYS LEFT TO REGISTER ( 43200 MINUTES)

I THINK THATS THE LAST VISTA UPDATE I WILL BE DOWNLAODING FOR AWHILE WHILE USING THE TIME STOPPER CRACK.

HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE,

OEM is fuckin 200 bucks, I have seen it ""Without Licence"" for like 125.

AT THE TIME I posted that RETAIL is 400 bucks, CompUSA was FUCKING Selling VistShit Ultimate Edition RETAIL for Four Fucking Hundred Bucks you FUCKASS.

And before you piss about home, busfuck, and masturbation editions of VistShit, keep in mind that thre is ONLY ONE EDITION of VistSHit worth getting, which is Ultrafuck Edition.

-Why should I HAVE to buy a 1 GB Rammed Video card, WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO BUY 8 GB of FUCKIN RAM to Run just a shitty OS?

-To buy 8 GB of RAM to run a fuckin Movie Editing program a CGI program, or an Audio Editiong Program _ THAT MAKES SENSE.

To FUCKING have to buy 8 to 16 GB of DDR 4 Ram JUST ATO RUN THE OS-

That is just stupid.

XP runs fantastic with a K7, and 256 MB of 333 MHz Ram with an AGP 4x Video Card with 32 MB of RAM

XP STILL runs fantastic with an 8-core, 3 TB Rammed, 4 TB of Disk Space computer.

Vista NEEDS this high end SHIT just to fucking BOOT you JACK ASS.

ok:


""Go and ask your Mama for some money and buy a good video card and 1GB Memory also get a genuine Vista in the store and run in your sisters` boyfriend computer and you will think different.""

I got a better Idea - I'll keep running KRAKED versions of Vista Ultimate Edition, for FREE.

Then, I'll ask YO mama, for 10,000 bucks and I'll buy a 16-core AMD machine with 32 GB or DDR IIII Ram and 15 TB of hard Disk Space- And I'll LOAD IT WITh XP and it'll still fuckin run 152 times better than VistShit you ASSFUCK.


""Still, you all use more than 3 months of time trying to get it to work without having to pay for it.""


You shitface, I've never spent any mroe than 4 minutes getting the CRACKS to work...

Where the 4 to 5 month project applies, is THAT IS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO REMOVE ALL THE BULLFUCK out of Vista. Just to turn OF all the fucking DEP and Security NAGS takes one week.

Fuck You: CrACKING vistshit is a 15 minute MAX endeavor, taking out all the MEMPORy WASTING POOP is a lifelong endeavor.

I have 2 GB now, and by default 1 GB of Ram is ALWAYS being used.

On the 4 laptops I just instaled Vista UE... All of them either Dual Core x64 Turions or Core Duos, they have 1 GB of ram, DUAL CHANNEL, and by default ALL of that Ram is ALWaYS Maxed Out.


""Why do not Get the fuck out of here !!""

No... I got a better Idea, MICROSOFT SHILL: Why don't YOU got to HELL? and tell Bill Gates to get ASSFUckED while you are at it.


""and get your FREE LINUX or MAC and do not ever come here.!!""

Why don;t you just go and buy a LINSPIRE machine you shithead?


""If its really that bad, why even try? Why lose time in this shit? If MS sucks why are you fucking idiots are still using PC?""

I'll tell you why- It is not that it is BAD ENOUGH with FUCKING SHILLS like you invading TPB-

Microsoft was FORCED to keep developing XP, because of guys like Me, and the other two guys you mention.

It is equally BAD that 90% of all Computer Users are fucking stuck with NON producing machines, because VistShit ether Prevents THEIR EXPENSIVE PROGRAMS FROM RUNNING, or the Fucking UPDATE for the program costs from 1200 to 2400 dollars, and why should they have to BUY a new version when the one they have WORKS? FUCK YOU.


""You guys look like your sisters. When she say: ? Ho my boyfriend sucks, I do not like him anymore, I want to broke up with him. But when he sticks his dick in there, she turns out to be so happy and forgets everything. ?""

You look like a Bitch for fucking BILL GATES... Do you take it up the ass in his HD-DVD Den?
