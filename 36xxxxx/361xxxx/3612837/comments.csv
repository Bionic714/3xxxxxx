I didnt knew that they filmed more movies."
,Hei_p책-deg,2008-02-14T21:11Z,They didn't film much of this theirself. Looks like a break.com compilation.
,slayermaximus,2008-07-08T20:51Z,"his is more of a jackass movie compared to the first one. Exept its thousand times better than jackass, since here they show the clips where things went terribly wrong for the idiots...As usual, not many real bums in the video, the bumhunter from bumfights 1 isnt even in it.No ridiculing of homeless this time. dissapointing. And a ridiculous low violence level. Why dont they pay some desperate heroin addicts to kill each other? Now that would be controversial..."
,slayermaximus,2008-07-08T20:59Z,"and i thought roofus the bum from the first movie was going to be their mascot throughout the series, he was awesome, and now hes not in it anymore... If you are new to the series, i would go for volume one. Though i have only seen nr. 1 and 4 so far."
,slayermaximus,2008-07-08T20:59Z,miss roofus from bumfights one...
,pirateman24,2009-04-20T03:44Z,Hi. please can someone upload LSD riders thankyou
,mitk0o0o0,2010-09-19T18:34Z,"Volume 4 sucks.

No roofus, bling bling, and donnie.
Fights are ok.
Stunts are so damn stupid, just some lil kids doing shit.
Almost all the clips are bought from LSD Riders, Appetite4Destruction n other related films.

IMO, volume 4 doesn't deserve the name and label ""Bumfights""

Thanks for the upload anyway. This is just my opinion."
