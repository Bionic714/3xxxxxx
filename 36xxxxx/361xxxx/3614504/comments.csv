,modal,2008-04-18T04:38Z,"Has anyone noticed that a randomly named 14,848 byte file in the system32 directory is being generated each boot? SuperAntiSpyware says it's a ""Unclassified.Unknown Origin.BHO"" and wants to delete it and the associated registry keys, although I have scanned with other anti-virus/trojan software and come up with nothing. The random file keeps appearing unless I delete WgaTray.exe.

Any thoughts?"
,filecore,2008-04-18T21:03Z,"@modal

The BHO at the end is short for Browser Hijack Object - ie, something that's potentially trying to change your homepage on your web browser. However, if that isn't happening, then it means that the antivirus is taking a guess at the content and maybe making a false positive. Also, any legitimate change of homepage BY A THIRD-PARTY PROGRAM may be considered as a browser hijack, because (obviously) it's not being done by the user; the program has no way of knowing whether it's allowed or not, so it flags a warning. Now it's my turn to download this and see what I can make of it..."
,modal,2008-04-19T08:45Z,"I downloaded the rar archive BTW. 

The dll file names it creates are very similar to other files in the system32 directory, e.g: TCAMHWAC.DLL is a legit file by 3Com and the most recent creation is named TCAMHWBC.DLL, no file info."
