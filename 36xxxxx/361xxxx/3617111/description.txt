WNEW TV New York, documentary of "The Hoboken Sound" (New Jersey).

A look at a small but influential musical movement in "The Square Mile City". Famous for its favorite son Frank Sinatra this documentary focuses on the bands that made Hoboken N.J. famous for its music and clubs in the '80's. 

Featuring a look at The Cucumbers, The Bongos, Gutbucket and The Feelies, this documentary is a really nice step back in time and if you were there or have even heard of any of these bands this is a great way to get reacquainted.
