,Clarasophie,2008-12-18T09:38Z,"Hi Beksinski, you have a lot of wonderful films. I wonder if you would give a novice a piece of advice: What do I do with avi-files and the other files attached? I would like to copy the film to a dvd and play it in a dvd-player. Hope you will help out even though the question is trivial. All the best!"
,colinreynolds,2008-12-29T13:52Z,thanks a lot!!!!
,damonstrong,2009-02-23T09:06Z,Answer for Clarasophie:  convert it to a mpg file and then you can burn it to DVD.  I use Prism Video Converter which you can download and use for free.
