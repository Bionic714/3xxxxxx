,BruzeWill,2011-05-26T21:29Z,I can’t wait to see this again in 16:9 on my new HD LCD.  I didn’t know that the Cinematography was by Douglas Slocombe (he also did Raiders of the Lost Arch’s Cinematography). I just saw the 2001 Gale Edwards version and all I could think of was how good this 1973 gem was. I hope this PAL version plays on my North American equipment. Thanks in advance.
