Use software called 'transmission'. works like a charm. 
The 'I'm better than you because of my computer' people have some growing up to do.."
,daredevil23,2009-05-16T01:33Z,"I have four computers, two of them are DELL computer's, lots of problems with them over the years. I said fuck it, and bought myself a imac, and I have been trouble free ever since, easier to use, much faster, just can't say enough good things about mac's. Anyone who says mac computer's are shit, don't know much about computers, or has never owned a mac, or maybe because they can't afford one, so think before you talk about things you know nothing about. Like everything else, anything new, takes a little getting use to, switching from xp to mac is a big change, hopefully the new windows 7 will be better than the xp, which makes me wonder, because they struck out with vista."
,OttifantSir,2009-11-13T12:33Z,"There are no passwords, but then again, some of the .rar-files report sizes of >150 MB and are empty, so why bother password-protecting something that isn't there?

And some actor names aren't correct, such as Liv Tyler being named Taylor, Cameron Diaz is Cameran, Alyssa Milano is Allysa, Keira Knightley is Kira Knightly, etc.

Apart from some of the .rar-files being empty, and some of the names are (rather understandably) spelled wrong, I salute village1diot for compiling this collection. You never knew how many actors actually used their birthday suit on film;-)"
