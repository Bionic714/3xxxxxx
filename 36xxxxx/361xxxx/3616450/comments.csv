,LunarHigh,2009-02-13T11:20Z,"Thank you very much indeed for this upload. Perfect on the size, quality is great. A note for people wanting to download this particular torrent: this is a TS folder, meaning you need to burn this download to a blank dvd in order to watch it on either your computer or tv. You may be able to convert it into a playable video file like mp4 or avi but I haven't tried. It burned just fine for me using Toast; it's just like the retail dvd version with menus and extra's and everything. Just thought I'd give everyone the heads up. Thanks again conexn!"
