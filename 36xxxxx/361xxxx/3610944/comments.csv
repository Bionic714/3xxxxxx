,grathiam,2008-03-27T12:34Z,"excellent copy, excellent flick...and subs for TLF work fine. Other subs, not for the TLF copy, are not sync'ed to this copy. Also, noted I didn't have sound, using VLC player, until I realized I must set sound for  mono or stereo in the VLC player"

I use a program called subcreator to sync the subs. It's good and easy to use."
