- YOU MUST CREATE YOUR OWN DATA.DXAR FOR YOUR OWN PSP! IF YOUR MODEL DIFFERS FROM THE DXAR IT WILL BRICK YOUR PSP!!!!! I SUGGEST THE UPLOADER OF THE OTHER TORRENT REMOVE FOR THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE HERE!
- THIS FILE INCLUDES EVERYTHING TO MAKE YOUR 3.10 DATA.DXAR ! THIS IS THE SAFEST WAY! WHY RISK BRICKING YOUR $250 PSP!
- THE DATA.DXAR MUST BE MADE FROM YOUR PSP TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL WRITE TO FLASH! YOU ARE BASICALLY ASKING TO BRICK YOUR PSP IF THE DXAR WAS MADE ON SOMEONES ELSES PSP WITH A TA-082+ MODEL"
,lap87,2007-02-05T13:58Z,"Don't bother with OE-A, go to www.psp-hacks.com to get the latest hacked firmwares, directly from the authors. NO RISK OF BRICKING!"
,SugArdaDdy,2007-02-06T19:14Z,"Mindphased:
You must be one dumbass motherfucker.
The DXAR doesnt change if you have a ta-082 or a TA-086.
The downgrader itself detects it and patches the motherboard.

Do some research before posting. Sigh.. All these dumbasses....

,ThetaRepublic,2007-02-11T10:53Z,"Hah, Sugardaddy, you should try doing some research yourself. The DXAR does change with a TA-082 because you have to patch it using idstoragechange. If you need any more info, post a comment. (By the way, I'm a Lua coder from LuaZone, so I know what I'm talking about :P"
,ThetaRepublic,2007-02-11T10:54Z,"Oh, I also forgot to say.

I don't recommend downloading this torrent. After all the fake brickers that have been released, I wouldn't take the chance. If you want to be sure it's the real deal, go to www.psp-hacks.com. They have the most recent Open Edition firmware within 2 days."
,NeoSabin,2007-02-11T23:22Z,"...it works im not trying to brick anyones psp because i wouldn't want it to happen to me, im just letting people have a shortcut in steps to 3.10oe...said and done do what you like

,stratman71,2007-02-17T23:25Z,"The DXAR in this matches the MD5 checksum of the   official one at psp-news.dcemu.co.uk/3-10-open-edition-rev-a-supports-latest-firmware-51865.html

which is BF1862F73FDF4B7458279ACFF4F6DAA2.
So it seems valid."
,stratman71,2007-02-18T02:07Z,"Just installed this.  Verified It works great, saves a couple of hassle steps.  Nice one NeoSabin!"
,stratman71,2007-02-18T02:08Z,Oh and be sure to use recovery to flash back to 1.5fw before upgrading to be sure of a clean upgrade.   whew!
,ricky4502,2007-02-25T19:02Z,"i'm a complete noob at this, i just sucessfully installed this now i just need to know how to play psp and psx games off the memory stick? where do i store them?"
,Turbis,2007-03-02T01:52Z,"stratman71: ""saves a couple of hassle steps"" is not really true... downloading from eg. www.psp-hacks.com will include a readme... Not that noobs read them anyways"
