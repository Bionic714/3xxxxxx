,Vasco.Simoes,2008-12-02T02:00Z,This game won't work in Microsft Vista. Works fine with Microsoft Xp. 
,angelbabeok,2008-12-18T08:03Z,"Actually this does work with vista, you just need to download the fix from microsoft"
,Thlump,2009-01-02T18:51Z,"Great torrent, should have been compressed though, that'll save at least 100MB on the download"
,Thlump,2009-01-03T19:26Z,"For those who can't get it to work:

1. Install the game and the patch (Pandora10a.exe)
2. Go to the crack2 folder and replace Pandora.EXE with the crack
3. Get a program that can make ISO files, such as MagicISO. Get it in TPB
4. go to the extracted folder, and press CTRL+A. That should select all the files. 
5. Right click, then go to MagicISO, then select Add to Image File...
6. If you done it right it should say Total Size: 544MB on the top. Now save the file as an ISO file (name it whatever you want)
7. Now go get Daemon Tools Pro (it's in TPB), install it and mount your new ISO.
8. If you have Autoplay enabled, what until the menu loads then press play. If it's not enabled right click and click on AutoPlay.
9. If you done everything correctly, then the game will let you play. Have fun!

NOTE: Yes, I know you're going to install two programs, but if you install Daemon Tools you never have to burn a ISO file to a CD, you simply mount it :)
