Every album, nearly every song!! (obscure tracks besides) from the LEGeND that is John Lydon. Will seed this nonstop for a few days (as long as my aging PC can handle it)

All albums in numerical order, all ID tags in order, every single track has the relevant album cover encoded in the mp3 so it looks cool on the old iPod.

I will upload a lot of rare, live gigs if this proves popular.
Am I the only PiL fan out there??? NJoI
