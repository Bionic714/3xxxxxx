,silvermink,2007-02-10T17:02Z,"avatar2012; If you have the DVD's, the absolutely easiest way is to have AutoGK make the DVD-rips. Go to http://www.autogk.me.uk/ to download and install AutoGK.
Then create a torrent with your torrent software, I prefer utorrent, http://www.utorrent.com
Then go to http://thepiratebay.org/upload and upload the torrent. If you need more detailed help, pm me and I'll help you out."

Could someone kindly guide me through step-by-step please (from the point that the download finshed)?  Thanks in advance."
