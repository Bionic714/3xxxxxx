,oldmcgroin,2007-02-16T22:37Z,"Has anyone had problems with the pss-b757.gau causing FS9 to crash? When I load the 757, as soon as the panel displays, the screen goes black and eventually I get the ""FS has encountered a problem and needs to close"" error message. The module listed in the message is pss-b757.gau. Thanks in advance for any assistance.
"
,N537JB,2007-02-17T00:14Z,That is caused to 99% by the voronoi.dat file. Did you unrar it to FS9 folder? It should be there.
,oldmcgroin,2007-02-17T00:52Z,"Yes that was it. I deleted V1.1 and forgot to replace that file. Thank you very much for your help. 

Great upload, its very much appreciated."

,presamerican,2007-05-28T00:16Z,"OK I downloaded everything. It seems everything is working, the only problem I'm having is finding out where to put the PSS folder that came along. It has 2subfolders (boeing 757 and NavData) and a bunch of DAT files. I dont know where to put this. I'm wondering if some of you could help me. If you want screenshots I can post some.
