[T],Spikkie,2008-12-09T11:39Z,"I have Fad gadget by Frank Tovey (2CD & 2DVD)box set . I'm converting it now to Xvid. Somewhere end this month I'll post it, because it's quit hard and I feel I have to do this as a tribute to this great artist. He was a beast on stage and a beauty in his real life.
R.I.P. , family man Frank. You're music keeps spinning in our heads while you're there in our hearts."
,IvyDrop,2009-01-22T17:03Z,"I downloaded this torrent, and I was somewhat surprised that it was all Vinyl.  In my opinion, that needs to be stated in the details of the torrent.  Just a heads up, suggestion, etc.  :-)"
