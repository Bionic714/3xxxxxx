,I_Vivaldi_I,2011-12-27T00:47Z,"If you don't wish to have FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) which is perfect professional sound. There is a torrent for I believe 320KB/s MP3 (if you're not an audio engineer you won't hear the difference from FLAC.) 

DL it here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6131900/Cannibal_Corpse_-_15_CDs_-_MP3"
