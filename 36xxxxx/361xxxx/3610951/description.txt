Tantalising glimpses of this album have been available as far back as 1989 when 'Xiological Sky' appeared on the 'Surreality' sampler CD. Glyn's previous two cassettes displayed his uncanny ability to harmonise sequences with breathtaking melodies. His third album continues this theme...... 'Ocean of Serenity', like so many of Glyn's tracks, is based around a stunningly beautiful yet simple theme which manifests itself in many guises. The opening refrains build to a climax then relax to a solitude which initially hints at, then leads into, the sequenced section. Here a rhythm is woven around a trademark synth lead which embellishes the main theme. A quality opening. 'An Alternative Reality' is again based around a superb chord sequence which Glyn seems to reel off at will. The way the sequence interacts with the main theme is a revelation. Initially the sequence is fired off in harmonic packets, to great effect, before being let loose. The whole thing works magnificently and is probably the highlight of the album ... along with the next track. If 'Return Flite' was described in its constituent parts one would not believe that such a concoction could work. Laid back synth themes combine with complex sequences, a cuckoo-like call sits alongside a guitar axe, choral voices mingle with bass rhythms. Pipey synth, flutey synth, reedy synth, synthy synth! It's all here bar the proverbial... and it all sounds fantastic. 'Xiological Sky' is very much a follow on from his previous album 'Icesteps'. The glassy synth leads combine superbly with the sequences which increase in complexity as the track draws to a close. 'Hymn' again has all the GLJ ingredients and the choral voices which open are magnificent. However, somehow this track doesn't quite click like the others seeming to climax too early leaving itself nowhere to go. 'Ocean of Serenity' proves conclusively that Glyn Lloyd Jones is one of our top New Age artists. The release of his previous two albums on CD cannot come a day too soon.
