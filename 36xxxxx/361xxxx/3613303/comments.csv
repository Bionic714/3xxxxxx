,admireme,2007-02-08T19:33Z,Isn't it amazing that some people can live through their whole life by only knowing around 800 words?
,ThaiWhip,2007-02-08T20:12Z,So many as 800 ?  his vocabulary is max 80..
,vevlaa,2007-02-08T22:49Z,"Thanks for this!

,Pando111,2007-02-09T10:30Z,"More than the reduction level porcen, we would have to see bittrate? 
This one in an old series, with chapters of 45 minutes and I do not believe that more quality can be removed to him. 
Thanks to all for the support messages.
Have fun !!!"
,a4lloxo,2007-02-09T14:23Z,@bz..................of all the sperm you were the fastest???
,Artak,2007-02-09T15:03Z,"Good stuff Pando111, thanks! We need more people like you. :-x

Maybe in the future you could also write what the particular disc is about, because I already have the Original Series and all of the movies.

Also, maybe somebody can tell me if this set really has finnish subs as written on the description above, but left out in the readme's list? I've been trying to get my hands on The Next Generation with finnish subs but with no success. :(

Cheers"
,Pando111,2007-02-09T20:14Z,"I feel it, but indeed the sub in Finnish is not including. To be a failure mine. I really feel it. Sorry :(

Ok, you are right.

This collection begins with the seven seasons of the New Generation.
In each DVD 4 chapters are included.

This first DVD corresponds to the first season of the New Generation (TNG). It includes the chapters:

Encounter at Farpoint, Part I
Encounter at Farpoint, Part II
The Naked Now
Code of Honor

It will try to do it in the next one better 

Thx for all."
,Artak,2007-02-09T23:46Z,"Thanks for the reply Pando111 :)

Aww.. Still no TNG seasons with finnish subs for me.. oh well, maybe I'll win the lottery and buy them all for 120 euros per season. :)"

,Pando111,2007-02-12T10:24Z,"Thanks for the commentaries.
