By a certain request, I am torrenting the movie Ponette, a really great, touching French film, I thought. I'm not going to divulge anything about the plot (if you'd like to know more, just use the IMBD link), so yeah.

This is the R1 DVD and seems to be kinda hard to come by nowadays. The only downside is that it's in 4:3 format.

I made the image with Alcohol 120, so the torrent contains both the .MDF and the .MDS files. Fits perfectly on a DVD5 (I didn't downsample or otherwise alter the original image).

Instructions: Burn (or mount) with Alcohol 120%. Pretty simple really.

Enjoy and please help seed. My upload is slow so any help I can get would be really great.
