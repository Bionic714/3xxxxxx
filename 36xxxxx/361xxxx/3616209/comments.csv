Great torrent!"
,Pando111,2007-02-16T13:41Z,"The correct thing is to begin by the Original Series. But it does not pass anything that you begin by the New Generation, because the chapters of each series are not related to others. 

The New Generation is more modern, and usually pleases more to people for that reason ;-)"
,El Jafar,2007-02-20T13:15Z,"cub91: It does not matter which one you watch first. 
The original series (TOS) and The next generation (TNG) are quite similar and the most drama like.  TOS might feel a little old nowadays.
Deep Space 9 (DS9) has most war of them. 
Voyager (VOY) is the one with most Borg confrontations and quite much confrontation.
Enterpris (ENT) first two seasons are lame, but the last two very action dense.
Generally, the first two seasons of every series are not so good."
