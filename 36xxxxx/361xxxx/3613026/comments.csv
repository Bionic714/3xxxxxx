,minifly01,2007-02-09T05:03Z,"This movie is not worth downloading. I donÂ´t get it, why all the ""real"" critics say this should get an oscar. ItÂ´s really a waist of time!"
,highstakes,2007-02-10T12:54Z,just fuck it!!!
,Morit,2007-02-10T13:47Z,"http://imdb.com/title/tt0449467/

,echoes14,2007-02-11T04:15Z,"Anyone who thinks this is a ""waist"" of time probably just doesn't get real art in movies.  "
,voystar,2007-02-11T10:43Z,"Muhahaha I don't know how anyone could think this is a bad movie. Definately worth the buy on DVD once it's out here in Europe. You have good actors in a total non-hollywood movie, very artistic. The plot just all fits together in the end and the deeper meaning of it how a ""little"" thing can change so much is just awesome. Making a mountain of a molehill..."
,Hacklol,2007-02-11T11:03Z,"Excactly anyone who thinks this movie suxx got no sense for good movies. Go watch Pirates of the Caribean 89 more times piz. Nerds. '
This move is Art"
