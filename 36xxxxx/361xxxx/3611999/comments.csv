,myprivatetorrents,2007-02-06T04:47Z,i have 10mb/sec upload speed; if u want to superseed me 
,bubbleblues,2007-02-06T04:50Z,"Thank u Thank u Thank u... Its now almost 5 o'clock in the morning where I am, I've been waiting all nigth for this..."
,FaTaL MiStAkE,2007-02-06T04:52Z,"Awesome, I'm still seeding 12 and 13. Thanks for the prompt upload."
,pire2pire,2007-02-06T04:55Z,"I have 100Mbps upload speed, we (top 5 leecher) are about at 85%.

In 2min i think we will finish and there will be multiple seed.

Anyway, usenet was faster (i started 1min later, and it took 10min to download).

Start your download, if you share at 10Mbps, it will be fast to get ;)"
,bubbleblues,2007-02-06T04:56Z,"Please seed people, I'm giving more then I'm gaining for fucks sake"
,crushernovski,2007-02-06T04:57Z,Alrighty then.... my first download. Been waiting a long time to do this all. I've seeded this one with no limits... lets see how we go!!!
,crushernovski,2007-02-06T05:02Z,Just to let you all know... I'm running two 8mb connections through this machine and I can only muster around 40kB/sec. If anyone knows how I can give you all more/faster upload speed let me know and I will promptly oblige. 
,pinuppamig,2007-02-06T05:06Z,The reason that it`s so slow is that there are over 700 who downloads and 6 seeders
,pire2pire,2007-02-06T05:06Z,"Use utorrent client with default settings and share at 75% of your upload speed.

Choose 20 upload slot for 1Mbps
100 for 10Mbps or more.

And always wait 5minutes before looking your speed, because bittorrent is slow to start, then it's super fast.

PS : there is 60 seed now, enjoy ;)"
