but The info that says that the band is from Denmark is totyly wrong.

it's Almost a world-wide-band;
Andre Andersen Is from russia, but he has studied in Denmark.

Mark Boals is from Ohio, Usa.

Per Schelander is from Stockholm, Sweden has studied in L.A.

Marcus Jidell is From Stockholm, Sweden.

AND. . .

Allan Sorensen is from Copenhagen, Denmark.
So a conclusion of this, the band 'Royal Hunt' is DenUSwedussia'n :P And NOT from Denmark!!!

So please, read about REAL info before ju say anything else!"
