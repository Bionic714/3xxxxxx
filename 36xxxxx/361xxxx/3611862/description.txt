Sorry. Last week i uploaded this brilliant video. But i was so drunk that I didn't notice that my grandfather had borrowed my new SCART-CABLE and replaced it with a 
cool but not that fancy cable from 1753. So this is a really great STEREO-version of Peter, Bjöööööörn And that Johnny boy. And since my dvd-recorder is not itself anymore please plase send me a little gift. Wappbabbeelooooba.
