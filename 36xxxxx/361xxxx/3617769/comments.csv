I never thought I would ever find anything like this on TPB. I am glad that I am not the only one around here who appreciates the elegance and beauty of Julia Childs thoughts, opinions, and techniques for fine cooking!
A little bit of trivia:
Julia Child was a researcher for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the agency that became the CIA. "
