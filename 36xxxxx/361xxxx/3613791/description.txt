Unpretentious psychedelic punk from one of the more accessible bands hatched by Texas' International Artists label. The most striking aspect is the fast and fluid guitar work, closer in spirit to Bobby Fuller than some of the more solo-happy guitar gods of the day. "Hot Smoke and Sasafrass" was the surprise hit off the album, although most of the other songs continue in the same vein, with harmonies reminiscent of some of the better Haight-Ashbury bands.
