Here's an obscurity plucked from the vinyl bin at random...
Obviously, you know who these guys are. They had three Top 40 songs in 1974-"The Heartbreak Kid", "Who Do You Think You Are", and the #1 song, "Billy Don't Be A Hero". They hailed from Cincinnati, and Bo Donaldson apparently still gigs even today, most certainly concluding his set with "Billy".
None of those three songs are on this album-nothing from this LP even charted in the Hot 100, but it does have some interest, as it was produced by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, who were certainly hit makers (more so in the UK) during this era. The Chapman/Chinn song "Teenage Rampage", a song they wrote for Sweet, leads off this album, and the LP as a whole rocks harder than their bubblegum days, but there are some curious inclusions-Todd Rundgren's "Hello It's Me", Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell", and Buddy Holly's "Oh Boy". The one track that will most likely catch your ear, however, is "This Is Your Captain Calling", a bizarre novelty song from the perspective of an airline pilot.
Comments are certainly welcome.
