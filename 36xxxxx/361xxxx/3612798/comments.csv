,alpha-omega2007,2007-03-26T11:01Z,To the comments above.make sure to mount the program with daemon tools or with alcohol120.These programs create a virtual drive so after installing the program then u do not need a disk in your disk drive to play the game.Do a search for these torrents on piratebay and download them.Then if necessary read there help files to learn how to mount a program.thnx.peace and out!
