Release Notes: Falling To Pieces has been tearing up Northern California since early 2004 with their brand of thrashy melodic metal infused with hard hitting, groove oriented structures that'll make you want to slap your grandmother in the face.

Rising from the ashes of the East Bay's own Fellatia, Falling to Pieces took form after finally settling on their current line up after many auditions and relentless let downs. But finally, with Eric Stewart and Erik Ruxton handling both dualing lead and rythm guitar duties, Jason Lewis providing screams, growls, and a touch of melody, Nick Benigno with his solid and punishing drumming, and Kimo Sanborn holding down the low end on bass, this band combines each member's abilities and attitudes to give way for some of the most intense, epic and brutal song writing in the scene today.

After releasing 2004's "The EP to Kill By" to much acclaim and praise from both online webzine reviews around the country and from the fans themselves, Falling to Pieces has been relentlessly playing shows and unleashing an onslaught of metal fit for a killing spree. Having shared the stage with national acts such as Dry Kill Logic and Hell Within, as well as many great underground and local acts, this band has definately proven that they can hold their own. Keep an eye out for them. Falling to Pieces will teach you what heavy fucking metal is supposed to sound like.

Enjoy!
