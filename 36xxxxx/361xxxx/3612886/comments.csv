,DadoBong,2007-02-12T09:49Z,"Should be on its way, see you."
,masseus,2007-02-13T09:30Z,"After watching this so called ""documentary"" one has to be so fcked up in the brain to belive that the so called ""journalist""  did'nt just go to a forest theater. Ohh and it was pure luck that everytime the Secret Service and alike showed up, the camera was off. You have to have an IQ less then 60 and have no concept of academic review to belive this sht."
,masseus,2007-02-14T08:55Z,"So what you are saying is, if no one answers it must be a yes? And if all is true in this ""documentary"" why are'nt there some living proof of high status members and i dont think that the black and white photo is proof since it could have been taken in some other matter. Also like I stated earlier one has to be really stupid if you belive that every time the Secret Sevice, Police and Securty arrived the tape had to be changed, second do you really belive that the most protected president in the world, would let 4 ppl just walse right in and be as close as they where??
Regarding my IQ I allready know that it's above 100, but thanks anyway. "
,masseus,2007-02-15T09:11Z,I never said anything about that there was no sort of an event. I do however question most of the claims about Presidents and alike to be in that cult at that place as mentioned in the movie. Sure there are many sick fking sects over in the US.
,masseus,2007-02-15T09:12Z,By the way are you even an american?
,Bennu3924,2007-05-11T17:51Z,"Hey MASSEUS for a self proclaimed smart person you sure act stupid...you see most people when confronted with something that is controversial or unsavory they use a well documented method you may have heard of ""the scientific method"" & through this method you attempt to dissprove claims therby proving them to be true or false. Had you an iota of integrity you would have first attempted to disprove your statements before making an ass of yourself because any two bit researcher can find BUSH on Meet the press admiting he is in the skull & bones as well as many confrentations with members that ALEX JONES made where they were clearly displeased that the secret meetings they attended to commit mock human sacrifices were exposed to the world. So before you EVER questions someones patriotism try doing some research beyond your remotes power button & stop speaking on things you refuse to learn or understand it only exposes your ignorance"

,thomasanderson911,2009-05-21T02:39Z,"So ""Order of Death"" and ""Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove"" are two different films. Which is this???"
,thomasanderson911,2009-05-28T07:37Z,"Okay, just finished downloading this. This does NOT have ""Order of Death"" included, but only the original release of ""Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove"". Just an FYI in case you are looking for ""Order of Death"" and hope you've found it here...you have not."
,asdhokker,2010-04-11T01:13Z,"it's probably downloadable here:

Meh. 

How else are they supposed to keep a secret meeting secret?

By inviting broads and transexuals?

Dumb hippie."
,monk-ee,2011-03-03T05:28Z,"I'm really having a hard time with the validity of this 'documentary'. In fact, I have a hard time with any kind of 'journalism' that tells you what to think. "
