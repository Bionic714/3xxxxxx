This isn't a official release.


The reason why I made this one is to enlight some people who want to get in touch with Swedish Melodic-Black/Death Metal bands and for those who already know about the genre but who wants to get to know some new bands. Some songs is quite common, others quite rare. I know some bands might be more "pure" melodic-black/death metal and others not, but we can argue about that somewhere else, wether they should be labeled as something else etc..

Some of the mp3 are ripped by me, and others not. But all of them are top notch quality.
