In the corner of the desert in Zelda: Twlight Princess lays a dungeon that is arguably the hardest to beat in the entire game. It has 50 levels, each harder than the one before but is entirely optional.

This video is something as rare as almost a frag movie on a console game basically showing of "Link's" skills with his sword and items. Rob Zombie sets the tone with two songs and is followed by Ilia's Theme that ends the movie.

This is a smaller project with high quality that also serves as a trailer for the upcoming A twilight love story. (The Cave of Ordeals contains some minor spoilers in the beginning.)
