,cfghyt,2007-02-04T14:22Z,does it work...?
,cfghyt,2007-02-04T14:26Z,"i get it.  the only thing it does is that it renames a file named application.sif to BACKUPapplication.sif, which is a temporary solution that was released a while ago."
,QmAn,2007-02-04T19:23Z,"it works only 30 days, that is it"
,addelito88,2007-02-06T12:51Z,Works fine for me!
,BuNgi3 HuNt3r,2007-04-06T22:42Z,Thanks this worked great. Just download the torrent and drag the application into the Adobe folder and run it. It'll say successful and it will have worked. It has NO VIRUSES as well. =)
,gmerriment,2007-04-12T17:53Z,"cfgyht and QmAn are right.  Changing the name of application.sif only suppresses the dialog box requesting a serial number.  After thirty days the program will simply fail to load.  This can be remedied by re-installing the software and renaming application.sif again.

Pain to have to do it every month though."
,Dig1taL,2010-06-14T23:04Z,"After using this, photoshop gave me an error saying that it could not run and I needed to re-install.

This doesn't work.

There are plenty of working activators, don't use this one, which doesn't."
