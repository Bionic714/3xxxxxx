Release Notes: Self titled Industrial-Electronica-Jungle-Death Metal. Violent Work of Art is an industrial metal band from Sweden. Violent work of art has been around since late '94, starting out as a Metalcore act. After two self-financed five-track albums, the line-up changed and the music transformed into a more industrial sound. During the years the sound has become more and more aggressive but yet melodic. The band has performed a lot live over the years, at festivals, clubs and other events and
even performed live on Swedish national radio.  

Enjoy!
