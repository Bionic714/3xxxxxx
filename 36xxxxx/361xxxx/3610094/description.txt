This collection of short stories was published on the web during early 2007, due to the fact that publishers won't touch a collection of short stories if you're not at least Chuck Palahniuk, thus the beginner seeks other ways to be read, which the Internet can provide.

In order to save bandwidth, this collection is posted here instead. Also available from the writer?s website.

iNFORMATiON
In the Name of the Future is a journey throughout the centuries to come. While each story can be read independently, various themes, developments and breakthroughs in mankind's history build and shape each following story.

SYNOPSiS:
Beginning with a pilgrimage to find telepathy in ?Mute World Order?, the discovery is studied and perfected in ?Vox Dei?. The possibilities of new means of entertainment and domination arise in ?Moron Land?, while the supply and demand for specialist telepaths rise leads to "Actual Image". While humanity reaches into space in ?Building Better Worlds?, some remain in oubliettes of confined consciousness in ?Transplant?. The two technologies and ideologies are combined in ?Cluster?, becoming new weapons of stellar military conquest. After a stranded time traveller tries to comprehend the world in the far future in ?Son et Lumi√®re?, mankind is facing extinction in the ninth story ?Good-Bye to All That?.
