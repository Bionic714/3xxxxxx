I'll be continuing seeding this one for a long time and I'll add other torrents as soon as I figure out how to balance my HD space. Is there any interest for other rare docs like ""Rolling Stones: Cocksucker Blues"" or ""The Making of DSOTM""?

""Who says what isn't as important as what is said."" - not sure who said that but it sure sounds right."

Any more Thompson stuff is grately appreciated, video footage of the king of gonzo is hard to come by.

Again, thanks a bunch."
