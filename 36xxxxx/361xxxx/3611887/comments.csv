[T],Shoey1964,2007-02-23T13:13Z,"A quick word about Vipersdenforums.com...
The co founder (Tauro) of that website LIED to forum boasting there was a RIAA law to take effect last November 2006. Turns out this was nothing but a bullshit lie and thus his aliby to edit posts at the forum. Tauro cut a deal with File Factory and majority downloads are text files that link directly to File Factory. Members are FORCED to reply to gain access to porn. The File Factory account is in Tauro's name and God only knows how much this thief STEALS money from the VDF community."
