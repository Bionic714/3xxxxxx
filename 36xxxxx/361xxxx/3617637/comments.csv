,eus2,2007-02-13T23:23Z,"There seem to be different opions about this film: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281190/ quote:  If you have to choose between watching this movie, or shoving dull pencils through your eye sockets, grab the pencils."
,cregmac,2007-02-18T12:35Z,"Eus2 Yes some people didn't like the movie, but Jamaicans and many other people were very proud of the film. The story and dialog are very real. Hoolywoodland couldn't do something like this"
