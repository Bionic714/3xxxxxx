[quote] GunZ is an online game that enables you to realize such a dream! GunZ is not your ordinary gunz fighting game. It allows you to imitate a famous hero, create your own fashion style, and perform a number of different actions such as shooting or stabbing whilst running and jumping on the walls. 


What makes GunZ ever better than other games is the fact that the game is available online to all users! In addition, GunZ is 100% FREE to play.

But they have left international version half-completed and began to work on Japanese , India , Brazil and North American versions! I dont get it. Why they dont finish one version instead of making new and new unfinished versions"
