,togo,2007-02-08T16:10Z,"I'll give you some movie info. Chevy Chase lost it many years ago, around the time those mediocre National Lampoons movies were doing well. He has not made anything actually funny since saturday night live. So as you can imagine this movie sucks ass in a big way. Imdb dont tell you that!"
,paulsmedia,2007-02-10T17:08Z,not a good film but lets thank the uploader and quit your moaning. If you want info about films get it yourself. its not hard is it.
