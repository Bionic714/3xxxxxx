,hesselurken,2007-02-20T03:30Z,Mången tack BhangWalla! Underbart fina filmer och dokumentärer du lägger upp. Jag hoppas att Hästmannen dyker upp bland dina kommande dokumentärer.
,harvey_weinstein,2009-04-15T21:11Z,"Good torrent, but the film is absolutely boring as hell. There is no dialogue, no talk or discussion at all. As a ""documentary"" I was expecting more. It's just a bunch of imagery of animals floating around in slow motion and sleeping monks and dreary music. I guess it's supposed to be some meditative piece. If that seems to suit you, by all means, download it and drift away... but if you're looking for good dramatic material or classic documentary type of film work, skip it!"
