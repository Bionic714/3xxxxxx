IT'S A DAMNED FORUM!!! And there was no info about this torrent. At least not directly accessible.

Which means that the torrent description is COMPLETELY USELESS.

Kollll: You're just a lousy SPAMMER! :(

If you can't provide a proper description, or at least a imdb link, you don't deserve to get your torrents downloaded.. or your spammer link clicked.

If you can't do a good job... bah, never mind my whining.. I just really really hate spammers."
