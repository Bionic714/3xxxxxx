Episode 216 "Chicago" 
Airdate: 02/05/2007


Sara steps off the train and looks around for Michael.

Kellerman watches her from a distance. His cell phone rings, it?s the President. She tells him that she?s in Chicago and she can fix everything if he takes care of Michael and Lincoln.

Sara slowly walks towards Michael and the two share a long overdue embrace. Sara reveals the key, tied around her neck. She shows Michael and tells him that she doesn?t recognize the insignia on it. Michael eyes Kellerman, and knows that he must tell Sara they?re working with him. Sara turns to see Kellerman, and she stands frozen in fear.

T-Bag cuddles closely to Susan Hollander in bed, T-Bag pleasantly waking her up. T-Bag says he?s going to unlock the kids and make them a nice breakfast, but Susan is defensive and insists that she do it. T-Bag angrily rolls out of bed and pulls a large knife from the nightstand. He storms around the bed and pulls the pillow from under Susan?s head to reveal he tied her to the bedpost the night before. He uses the knife to cut her free. Susan sits up and tries to rationalize with T-Bag, telling him that there?s no way they can work as a family now. Susan goes on to tell T-Bag that a woman named Patty from the neighborhood welcoming committee is coming later that day and she can?t cancel. Susan tries to use the opportunity to convince T-Bag to leave, but he insists that it won?t be any trouble.

Michael, Lincoln and Sara walk to Kellerman who does his best to apologize to Sara. When they?re clear, Michael and Lincoln pounce on Kellerman, and slam him against the train station wall. Michael growls, ?You didn?t tell us you left her to die!? Kellerman tries to explain with Michael?s hands around his throat, he pleads, ?You need me and you know it!? Sara says they don?t need him, they can figure out what the key is for on their own. Kellerman looks at the key on Sara?s neck and chimes in, ?I can tell you what that key is for right now. It?s to a private cigar club.? Lincoln asks where the club is, Kellerman catches his breath and says, ?Chicago.?

Haywire scrambles to finish his boat, he knows he?s done something wrong. Mahone barks orders to agents in the office; he wants wanted posters on every gas pump on major freeways. Agent Wheeler quietly interrupts and says they may have a lead on Haywire fleeing the scene of a homicide. Mahone tells Wheeler to notify the Madison, Wisconsin field office to handle it. Wheeler says he?ll notify Headquarters which angers Mahone and he accuses Wheeler of not following orders. Instead, Wheeler tells Mahone that he is following orders. Headquarters has told Wheeler to no longer take orders from Mahone, only orders from Headquarters. Mahone is furious and sends Wheeler away. Agent Kim calls Mahone and tells Mahone that he needs to eliminate Haywire.

Kellerman escorts Michael towards a ticket taker. Kellerman tells him that he?s escorting a fugitive to Chicago and needs a train car emptied.

Lincoln finds Sara sitting alone and tells her that it?s going to be alright. Lincoln assures Sara that once they get what they need from Kellerman, they?ll get rid of him. He also apologizes to Sara for getting involved and it means a lot to him that she did.

Kellerman tells the ticket taker that he should not alert the passengers; just keep them out of the car. Kellerman whistles to Lincoln and Sara and gets them on the train. Sara sits across from Michael, nervously fidgeting with the drawstring of her hooded sweatshirt. Kellerman reclines in one of the seats and smugly looks over them.
