A rare bootleg of the hour long talk Robert Anton Wilson gave for "Disinfo Con" at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City on February 18th 2000. This is from the same convention much of the Disinformation DVD Set came from, yet this segment was not included.  

This is a hand-held with poor audio quality and poor video at times, but this is R.A.W at his finest, talking on religion, drugs, sex, politics, taxes, death, drugs, and much more.

Delivered in 720x480 NTSC/DV Divx 6 with 24khz audio.
Running time: 47:13
