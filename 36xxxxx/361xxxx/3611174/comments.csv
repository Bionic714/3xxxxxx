So since no one has commented on this movie I though I would give it shot. Hoping that this movie would be good I was greatly disappointed. The story/plot is ok I guess but the research behind this does not appear that truthful I think. The most obvious problem is the type of uniforms that the soldiers wear which is completely wrong. Anyway if they can't get that simple thing right then what else is wrong!? 

Video: 8 out of 10 for the scaled down screen size
Sound: 9.5 out of 10

Verdict: Quality of the movie is good although it has the Portuguese subtitles. Bottom line is that I though this movie sucked."

1. first off, the movie was not focused on the actual Nazi's, it was suppose to focus on the struggling gay protagonist. I know the uniforms were off but that is beyond the point, the movie is about standing up for who you are and being proud.
2. give the guy some credit for uploading it, yes it may not have had the perfect quality with the sub titles and all but at least it is up.

In my opinion i thought the movie was decent, I would recommend watching it."
