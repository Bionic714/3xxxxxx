A collection of mp3s from a rap group called Crazy Crakaz.
They're on myspace.  
www.myspace.com/crazycrakaz


This torrent is all 4 songs that are presently on the MySpace page along with some extras as well.
The 4 songs on the MySpace page are:
Da Black Market (a remix from the SNES game EarthBound)
Funk Out (off a DJ Potatoe compilation album)
Happy Birfday, DCT (a birthday treat to a friend, remix of Super Mario Brothers)
DCT DED OMG RIP (a mock tribute to a friend who isn't even really dead)

There are also clean versions of Black Market and Happy Birfday as well as a demo version of Funk Out, a demo version of Black Market featuring VGMix artist Ailsean on guitar (it's unfinished, sadly), an early and unfinished song called Betrayal (which is slated to be finished soon, I hear) and another good song that isn't on the myspace page called Believe in Jesus.
This probably isn't for everybody, it's more on the silly side of things and there's plenty of profanity.  There's also appearances from nerdcore rapper Shael Riley (a.k.a Disk Masta Smokabitch) and myf among others.

Maybe this will get a few more people interested in the Crakaz.
Again, they just got a myspace page up and some new songs are apparently in the works.

And by "they" I mean "me" because I'm blatantly trying to leak my own material online.
If anybody has any comments or questions, let me know!  I'm here to answer!
