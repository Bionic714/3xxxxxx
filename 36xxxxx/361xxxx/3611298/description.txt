NIRVANA - The Untold Stories


Nirvana was arguably the most important American rock band of the 1990s; merging the angry energy of punk with the aural impact of heavy metal, Nirvana brought the sound known as grunge to the masses and proved that guitar-based rock was still alive and well at a time when it was widely regarded as a spent force. Nirvana: The Untold Stories is a documentary which charts the group's unexpected rise to fame, as well as the troubled life and tragic death of guitarist and lead singer Kurt Cobain. Please note that Nirvana: The Untold Stories was created without the participation of the members of the group and features no music or performances by Nirvana.
