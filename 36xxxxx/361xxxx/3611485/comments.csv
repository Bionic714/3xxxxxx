,zepirate,2007-02-28T00:12Z,"Just to let you know, I'm actually seeding via both bittorrent, and Shareaza, I would suggest you switch to something like Shareaza, instead of the normal bittorrent client, becuase it can download both torrents, and stuff from gnutella/edonkey, but di whatever works for you, I don't care."

,zombix12,2008-07-18T20:05Z,"Um, I downloaded the torrent, I burned both disks to separate DVD+R. Everything worked up until the point of actually playing the game, when I received the ""Insert proper disc to continue"". I tried both disks, I still got the error. Then I tried the patches, which didn't help at all. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated."
