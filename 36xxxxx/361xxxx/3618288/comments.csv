,maxx99bx,2007-02-16T08:04Z,"GAY PORNO!!! The description sounds like this movie is a candid look at sexuality in America... not exactly.  It is a film about gay sex, and shows multiple scenes involving hardcore gay porn.  Do not download unless this is your thing. I am definitely not homophobic, but I am not interested in seeing a guy eat out his buddy's a**hole, no matter how artistic the presentation."
,daatorrentfinder,2007-02-21T11:04Z,"max99bx is right!

This movie contains a long scene with 3 guys faging each other. If you are straight and want to go blind, see this movie, otherwise dont. you have been warned!"
,Onk,2007-02-22T21:17Z,What is wrong with people like maxx99bx and daatorrentfinder? Maybe I should shout out comments like this for every film that contains hetero sex? 
,KingDor,2007-02-24T00:14Z,"I agree with maxx99bx, nothing against homosexuals, but be warned to those not enjoying watching the types of things described.

Just as violence is warned about in some movies, these are nothing but warnings to unsuspecting downloaders. I don't think any of us here have anything against homosexuals."
,nuflux,2007-04-27T07:08Z,"To maxx99bx, daatorrentfinder, et al:

Grow the fuck up you little pussies.

Oh, your fragile little eyes!  Not to mention your masculinity under siege.  Maybe you even got a little excited?  Curious?  Better ""warn"" everyone else!

If you didn't know what this movie was about, and the fact that it was directed by John Cameron Mitchell, an out and unapologetic gay man, then you shouldn't have downloaded it.  But considering the fact that this movie wasn't exactly Mission fucking Impossible IV, I'm guessing you looked into it first.

Oh, and max, a candid look at sexuality in America would look at bi- and homosexuality, since those forms of sexuality EXIST in America, moron."

,normsy,2007-06-22T07:43Z,"How about you homophobes stop talking about how you live in the stone age and comment about the fucking quality of it.  Picture/sound, anyone?"
,Pink_Chili,2007-06-22T13:13Z,Great movie! Thx!!!!
,Plantin,2007-07-08T00:20Z,Looking forward to this. Thanks!
,edmlds,2007-07-25T07:40Z,"maxx99bx and those who agree with him , watch the trailer of movies before downloading or at least research the title first.  Then you can actually deside if you want to add something to your hard drive.  The trailer clearly exlpains what this movie is about.  If you listen to the words and not just look at the screen you will also understand the context....not just viewable content.  

BTW...thanks for the movie kolll!  I just heard about it a few days ago and cant wait to see it!"
,insane cancer,2007-07-26T17:57Z,"this is a homosexuall movie... if you are gay - watch it , if ur not - dont  yuk"
,yo_mama,2007-08-15T07:22Z,"some homosexuals doing their thing! is that soo hard for you to watch? what's the fucking problem? 

You don't Necessarily have to hate homosexuals so much so you can't watch this movie, just because you're not one of them. You hate everything you're not? Or are you just to weak to look at it? Maybe you are afraid you're acctually one of them, a homosexual?
What if you were born a homosexual? ""yeah well but i'm not!"". right.. what's the world come to.. just fucking retards everywhere.

Anyhow. these comments should be posted on sites like IMDB etc. I agree with normsy, post about quality etc instead. -.-"
,momo1805,2007-10-04T12:51Z,Thanx for the warning guys.. really appreciate it
,andrnorge,2008-01-05T20:16Z,is this the shortbus movie or another movie?
,hex1,2008-01-19T15:21Z,"God some people are pathetic. I like the bloke who equates warnings about 'gay content' to warnings about violence, that's shockingly idiotic.

If you're here, you know what this is. Art-y movie about love and relationships. If you're a moron you better run off to watch hunky half-naked men display idiotic bravado in shit like Mission Impossible XVI. That's much more realistic and 'straight'.

PS: I'm not gay."
,WarpWar,2008-02-25T15:13Z,"I thought it was pretty good, you do want to skip the gay scenes though.

I just covered the screen, but it was kinda funny seeing a man sing the star spangled banner into another mans ass. (I am not making that up)

I would recommend the 2.4 gig version that has the making of, which was very interesting."
,WarpWar,2008-02-25T15:16Z,"this one
