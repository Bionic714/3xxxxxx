,4X-AXG,2007-02-14T02:08Z,"thanks :) I'll have to cap the speed for a little bit, but will seed at full speed ASAP"
,byblos,2007-02-14T03:20Z,Your the best !! Thanks sooooo much !
,Sataris,2007-02-14T07:01Z,PMDG's in 2011 is going to be better :P
,byblos,2007-02-14T08:02Z,"What´s this ??? Can not download more than 64,6 % !!! How about seeding when uploading?...makes things so much easier. !?!?"
,byblos,2007-02-14T08:09Z,Or is it me who is doing something wrong maybe? ;-)
,byblos,2007-02-14T08:13Z,">PMDG's in 2011 is going to be better :P<

Don´t think so. PMDG is very much overrated. I wouldn´t hold my breath for a good MD-11 from them....if ever....LOL I mean,..how long did it take so far. A already finished freeware panel which has to be configured with a aircraft model. How long can a thing like that take....;-)"
,blasterpc2001,2007-02-14T08:45Z,"Thanks alot 4X , hope it works for me."
,rikzter7674,2007-02-14T12:25Z,"I have experienced the CTD when I press ""Fly Now"" using this plane. However it looks like it's a gauge problem because when I delete all the SKYMD11 gauges the sim loads up perfectly without any CTD. But all the gauges are missing."
,4X-AXG,2007-02-14T12:28Z,"I got the same problem, but for other people it works fine..argh..I don't get it :P"
,-=Sukhoi=-,2007-02-14T12:55Z,"im have problem too. :\ But thx for sharing.
Req PSS 757 1.2 hxxp://www.phoenix-simulation.co.uk/
Slow VC texture loading times - FIXED"
,4X-AXG,2007-02-14T13:24Z,"damn it..well folks, my apologies for this, but we'll get it working :)"
,4X-AXG,2007-02-14T13:44Z,"well my observations can't count anymore..I'm experiencing similar crashes with totally different aircraft, so I think I was right in the first place..the CTDs are connected to my setup/system/FS and not necessarily to the MD-11"
,PHBFO,2007-02-14T13:49Z,"Thank you!!
By the way, at the Avsim forums are some fixes, maybe they'll help?"
,B744,2007-02-14T15:14Z,"works fine here. tho gotta admit you aint missing much, flys like a fighter jet lmao its amazing how many tricks you can do with this plane"
,Panodilo,2007-02-14T15:17Z,lolol - read the user review section at Simmarket. This numb nut Clifford Knowles is putting on a tour de force in the art of reasoning for single cell organisms. With every retarded posting he gulps up a third of his mana.
,N537JB,2007-02-14T16:13Z,Thx man :)
,PHBFO,2007-02-14T16:55Z,"Allright, works fine here, thanks!
Anyone has FSForce? Just got a new FFB joystick."
,krystczar,2007-02-14T17:35Z,The plane works fine but terrible fps. I had around 8fps in 2d view. And the autopilot is far away from accuracy.
,dickneuf,2007-02-14T19:56Z,This works just fine 4X-AXG thanks
,rjr13666,2007-02-14T23:08Z,I hope it works good thanx

,FSSR.Keyno,2007-02-15T19:39Z,"Hey, was a bit reluctant to install, because of CTD. But no problems. I kinda had fun with this Behemoth. Boy is she BIG.
All went fine till coming out of descent. And landed like a Ultralite with a blown 454, oh and with B17 snow tires.
Thanks with the upload.
ciao baby"

,Golf3188,2007-04-16T02:11Z,"Excellent upload 4X-AXG! Works perfectly fine for me, no crashes what so ever. Thanks alot mate."
,xldie,2007-04-16T20:40Z,"This jet loads in the ""create a flight"" section, with its horizontal stablizer all the way down, no gears, and a pushback tug near where the nose gear suppose to be. Doesn't look correct. When click OK to start the flight, the FS does not show the load status bar and simply exits, without warning or error messages. This happens on both an existing FS2004 installation and a new FS2004 installation with absolutely no 3rd party add-ons."
