Long live the MD-11!!!

PLEASE NOTE!!!

this rip causes my FS to crash (CTD); however, I believe this is a problem with my system/FS/setup/whatever. I have at least two other people who have confirmed the rip works perfectly. So, IF you encounter CTDs...1: I warned you and 2. please let me/us know!
