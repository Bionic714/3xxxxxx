Same episode, another release, better upload speed.
(Not for those who love .rar, though... this is just the .avi file.)"
[V],profiled,2007-02-14T11:44Z,this release got 270 seeders atm.. so speed wont be an issue now :)
,zoneone,2007-02-16T09:57Z,Not anymore.. But it _was_ an issue when I wrote it. :)
