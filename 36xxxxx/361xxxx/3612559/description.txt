Sorenson Squeeze is a professional application that allows you to convert files into many formats, including .flv with the Sorenson Spark encoding. Useful for YouTube users, as your file won't be recompressed into a lower bitrate if it is saved with a .flv extension.

As always, virus and spyware free!
