But please SEED!!

,elister,2007-02-05T14:35Z,"I am seeding.  BTW, this is just the game.  No pre-game, no post game, no halftime.  Just the national anthem, coin toss and game. "

,QsD1,2007-02-05T17:13Z,Have the commercials/adds been cut out? :)
,gav18,2007-02-05T17:29Z,"Thanks for this, couple of quick questions, does this show the teams running onto the pitch, as for some reason I love the atmosphere when they do that, and like QsD1 asks, have the ads been cut out?"
,elister,2007-02-05T18:11Z,"Ads have been removed.  You want ads, turn on a TV. "
,gav18,2007-02-05T19:18Z,"elister, I meant that as a positive thing, I'm very happy that the ads have been cut out.

Just checked and it does indeed show the teams running onto the pitch, woooooo !!"
