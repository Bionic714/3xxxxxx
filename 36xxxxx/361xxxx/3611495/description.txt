I found another set, which I guess is quite an exclusive one, as I havent seen it anywhere else yet!

Seems this is some promo mix for the winter music conference or something.

Lots of great tracks in this one imo.....

Again I tried to ID all the tracks, and came up with this tracklisting:

1 Cassandra Fox ? Touch Me (Mike Koglin Vs. Jono Grant Remix)
2 Kupon ? Zoom In
3 Luminary ? Amsterdam
4 Lorraine ? Transatlantic Flight (Axwell Remix)
5 Sander van Doorn ? Grashopper
6 Martin Landsky ? 1000 Miles
7 Karen Overton ? Your Loving Arms (Club Mix)
8 Leonid Rudenko ? Summerfish (Scandall Sunset on Ibiza Mix)
9 Patrick Markus ? Liftoff
10 Jose Amnesia ? Louder (Blake Jarrel?s 190Db Mix)
11 Cicada ? The Things you Say (Dirty South Remix)
12 Cosmic Gate ? Analog Feel
13 Supresa ? Poseidon
14 Matt Abbott Vs. D.S.E. ? Far from Home (Patrick Markus Remix)
15 Richard Durand ? Slipping Away

Length: 1 Hour 19 Mins and 48 Seconds.
Quality: 160 kbps

More quality mixes by tiesto and Armin van buuren coming soon!

I hope you guys enjoy :)
