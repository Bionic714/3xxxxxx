,Velq,2008-11-06T23:03Z,"@ 6FtUndr001 You're the one being idiotic here, sure pls plz plczx is annoying but 'the fuck do you know if someone decides to start seeding because of that one plz, it does no harm, and sitting on your ass sure as hell won't change a thing.

@ GOGO89 Splitting hairs, it's cool to show you like the band but no-one likes that. And for curiosity, tell me the differrence between those two."
