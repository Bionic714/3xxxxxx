\\\"Taking a cue from Altman and \\\"New York Stories\\\", with a healthy dose of Kevin Smith and \\\"The Kids in the Hall\\\" thrown in for good measure, they?ve created a series of interwoven vignettes about a group of guys unlucky in the realm of love. And they?re funny. Really funny. Tear inducing, laugh out loud funny. (Especially Jeremy Catalino, whose performance as the mostly nude Vincent is the highlight of the film; he?s a natural born comic whose line delivery?high-pitched, whiny, and ham fisted?provides comic gold throughout the film.)

Following six co-workers of a local movie theater, the film takes place over one night, after they get off work, while headaches and women problems?from vicious ex-girlfriends, sultry neighbors, and phonebook throwing bad mammas?intersect their lives and disrupt their plans of getting together at a local hang out.

Consisting of four short films interwoven and book ended with scenes featuring all the characters at the movie theater, Night of the Dog feels like a singular, fluid story?closer to \\\"American Graffiti\\\" than \\\"New York Stories\\\"?rather than a series of vignettes, an astonishing feat considering that an undertaking such as this could have produced an unbalanced, stilted film experience; one misplaced scene, one badly timed cut or flawed segment would have derailed \\\"Night of the Dog\\\" and turned it into an unwatchable mess.\\\"

That\\\'s a direct quote from one of the Directors, Peter Atencio.

Anyways, he hasn\\\'t been able to get it distributed by pretty much every company becasue of the risk they feel they would be taking with it.  He still wants people to see it however, and that\\\'s why I\\\'m putting it here.  You\\\'ll definitely enjoy it you filthy son of a bitch.  (not porn)
