,cr34m,2008-09-27T14:50Z,seed please... stuck at 99.7%
,gharkoja,2010-02-19T20:02Z,"Dear God! I'm downloading after 17 months after the last comment by cr34m, but meself and four others are still stuck at 99.7% !

If the file were a simple avi, this wouldn't have been a big problem. But since the avi file is split into 48 parts using winrar... I don't know how to rectify that problem... will have to seek help from some techie forums i guess.

Another option is to somehow contact this ""kollll"" uploader and ask him/her to have some mercy on our poor souls by seeding for just one day, after which I vow to seed for at least one month."
,gharkoja,2010-02-19T20:22Z,that should have been 15 months.
,gharkoja,2010-02-19T20:23Z,"Put up a re-seed request at suprbay.
