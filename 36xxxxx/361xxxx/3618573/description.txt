A song from the forthcoming album, this describes a love of English erotica, and how it's better than that from anywhere else in the world. It touchingly reflects of the preferences of the Russians and the Japanese, and the obscurity of certain Mongolian practices. This is a song that means a lot to its writers, and we hope that it will mean something to you as well. The video is the live recording of the song, which took place in Hertfordshire, UK in early 2007, (although it has been performed in numerous bars and clubs since it was written in 2005.)
