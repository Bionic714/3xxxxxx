,AWBoy666,2007-02-06T22:55Z,"WARNING!!!  This torrent appears to have a CORRUPTED ARCHIVE.  I was unable to extract anything from it.

Can someone confirm this?"

,Felgard,2007-02-07T00:43Z,im getting strangely annoyed by this file every time i do a force recheck after i compleated the file i en up getting a random % compleated.
[T],Knaster,2007-02-07T09:27Z,Im pretty sure this game wil suck tremendously but appreciate the upload nevertheless
,Felgard,2007-02-07T11:53Z,"considering the amount of hype so yes.

never seen any largly hyped games to not suck"
,Electricall,2007-02-07T17:00Z,"Yumm yumm. It truly is awesome to use piratebay. Tried downloading off fileshack, but I quickly got fed up with the excessive ads and whatnot. Piratebay is faster, slimmer, better, and resumable. ^^ Can't stop this feeling of wonderment, even after the endless gigs I've downloaded here."
,Me-LoDon,2007-02-07T19:36Z,"WTF!

Fileshack ownz man!!

pb is okay "

,Geraldoaj,2007-02-08T00:27Z,"I played this and i must say. Oh god I love demos. Sure itÂ´s a demo, but still we can sense what the game is or what it will be, and IT SUCKS!!!, boring, horrible music, poor history (remind me homeworld 2 somehow)...If you loved RTS like COH, Age of Empires or Command and Conquer i think you will hate this like me...good luck"
,msdash,2007-02-08T20:41Z,"In my opinion it's pretty good, deffenetly something to check out."
,MILKOD2001,2007-02-08T21:50Z,"there is no problem to download it and to install it, BUT this demo sucks, if full version will be the same/what is probably going to be/ then fuck it, i have played this shit only 15 min. but it was enough to tell that this game is shit, graphics looks like 5 years old and game sucks as well, do not  get me wrong but i was expecting some great game....but this was shit if u did not play dawn of war yet try it it is 100000000 times better or wait for new C&C"
,pilot172,2007-02-12T07:13Z,"Thanks for the upload.  The TA crowd should love this...  PS if you kids are playing this for missions and storyline, you WILL be disappointed.  Much like TA, skirmish and multi the only way to go."
,rieka9411,2007-02-12T10:12Z,"is this game great!?
