A Note From Chris Taylor

Supreme Commander was more than a labor of love; it was the completion of a
journey we started a long time ago and was a game that we?ve wanted to make for
a very long time.  To see the game complete is an incredible reward for us,
especially because it delivers many of the goals we set for ourselves back in
2003.  And now the journey is complete, and we will soon embark on another. 
From all of us here at GPG and the SupCom team, to all of you, we hope Supreme
Commander brings you many hours of entertainment and delivers a new and
exciting experience.  And most of all, we hope it?s everything you had hoped it
would be...we worked very hard to make that happen.

All the best!
