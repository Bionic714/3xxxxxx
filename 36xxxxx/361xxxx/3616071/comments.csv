,JDErickson,2007-02-11T21:32Z,Steadicam - Did you ever think of advancing past infancy DUDE. Problem with my client. It's seeding now. Get a life
,Steadicam,2007-02-12T21:33Z,"Hate to be the one to point out the bleeding obvious, as it would probably be put, were this a Monthy Python skit - but no, your client is still not working properly. Your effort seems to be appreciated, counting from the number of leechers still hanging on, so don't be a sour face. It's the thougth that counts - right, dude?"
,JDErickson,2007-02-13T06:38Z,"Always amazed me how pencil necked geeks get froggy hiding behind a computer screen when in real life they would be bleeding on the sidewalk.

Client works fine, I just don't spend all my time staring at internet porn like you do. 

Get a life DUDE. If you decide to put your money where your mouth is I live in Salt Lake City. Let me know when you are nearby and I will come and kick your ass DUDE."
,Steadicam,2007-02-13T14:37Z,"Jeez, youÂ´re a cheerful kind a fella, man... But obviously not so bright: In my comment above I said ""Thank you"" for the torrent in a way which was evidently too obscure for you.
And regarding coming to Salt Lake City - I donÂ´t think so. Morons like you live there, dude."
,JDErickson,2007-02-13T15:00Z,"Nice - A coward too. You are amazing. 

Do the world a favor and commit suicide now. No need to waste anymore resources."
,mac2007,2007-02-15T15:03Z,"JDErickson, break it a moment with Steadicam (if you didn't do it yesterday, on Valentine's - hehe...) and tell me if your mp3s are really good, I mean no over 0 dB, like many downloads on Internet.

ThankYou."
,JDErickson,2007-02-17T19:37Z,"Mac2007,
All my MP3's are MP3gain'ed to 93. I find this perfect for Ipod use (not too soft) and not clipped as most internet MP3's are. 

As I said before they are ripped with DBPoweramp (secure mode) and encoded with Lame 3.97 with V0 and Q0 methods (the best VBR qualities) available. They would be compareable to CBR 320 but with a smaller size. 

Have a look here for more info:

,fear_the_oblivion,2007-07-11T06:04Z,"Uhm... this kind of hostility on an Enya torrent? Weak. Great upload though.

Sensitive assholes, never woulda thunk it."

Thank you so much."
,PedreS,2008-10-14T17:13Z,"Niiiice!

Thx from Holland =)"
,Gryph0n,2008-11-10T00:15Z,"Sorry playing spoilsport, but this is missing ""I Want Tomorrow"" from Disc 1, as per the track listing at Wikipedia

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Time_-_The_Collection

Anyway, seems to be a good quality torrent. 

Cheers !"
,SouthernDeathcult,2008-12-11T18:23Z,"Nice torrent although songs are not completely tagged as claimed. Songs of a multi disc set should be tagged as belonging to CD1 , CD2 etc not all lumped together in one folder with no reference to which CD they came from."
,Kip23,2009-05-09T13:55Z,Amazing tracks! Thanks for uploading this!
,Tolle44,2009-09-11T08:09Z,"I didn't realise this was a forum ^^

I had a fun time reading SteadiCam and JDErickson's comments ^^

And mac2007 - you're gay....

Thanks for sharing!"
