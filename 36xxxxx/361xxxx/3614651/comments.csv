,gomzi,2007-02-21T20:40Z,"very nice art76, excellent job, they are actual models/p0rnstars."
,FifthCenturyAdvocate,2007-02-23T19:52Z,"Is this a demo or full game?
if not, where can I find the full game?"
,BP OMowe,2007-02-25T00:18Z,"By the filesize I'd say it's the full game.
Just make SURE you follow the instructions or you'll  only be able to use the demo part."

,DarrenTheCruel,2007-05-21T04:50Z,"Works Fine, Thanks LOADS!!!"
,Najtiii,2007-05-29T07:58Z,"The readme is poorly written, but I managed to get it to work (says corrupt file sometimes when I start it though, but if I just restart it works). Anyways to clarify:

1. Install it. The install file is VirtuallyJenna, which you got with the package. 

2. Now you need to get two files (fcVirtuallyJenna.dll and fcVirtuallyJennaRun.exe) from the  'Launcher' folder and copy them to the \VirtuallyJenna\Binaries\ directory.

3. Now copy the files in the Addon folder (not the folder itself, just the files) and add them to the \VirtuallyJenna\Archives\2.029.002\ directory.

4. Use fcVirtuallyJennaRun.exe to start the game.

5. Go to the members section, enter any password and name you'd like and you're set. Hope this helps. By far the best 3D sex game I've played. "
