,axxxxe,2007-02-12T14:05Z,I've been offline (not seeding) for maybe 2 hours total since posting this torrent.  Don't be a dick.
,invaliduser,2007-02-12T14:10Z,"Damn! been looking for this for years. Last I knew it wasn't even availible. Thank-you very much, I am a big Nick Cave fan and had read much about this."
,axxxxe,2007-02-12T20:49Z,"If you like NC, check out The Proposition, too.  There are interviews with Nick, Blixa, etc on the Ghosts DVD - should I torrent those, too?"
,invaliduser,2007-02-13T03:31Z,"I have The Proposition. Really enjoyed it, and I think this is by the same director as well. If it's not to much trouble to up the extras I'd be interested.

Thanks again Axxxxe. Got this in less than 2 hours. "
