,DbLoki,2007-08-21T06:58Z,"K, i've been going through all the ""Season Six"" files and have noticed a lot of argument over which season it really is.

To clarify: Volume one of the DVDs contains both seasons one and two, so volume 2 is season 3.

It gets a little confusing from there because voulme 3 is called season 3, and volume 4 is called season 4. 

Really i'm not sure if this is technically season 5 or 6, but I'm pretty sure that's where the confusion comes from."
