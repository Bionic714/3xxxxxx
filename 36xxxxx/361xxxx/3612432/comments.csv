,Mr_Fear,2007-02-06T21:47Z,"Well, i can follow you in howto make a really good dvd copy, but this is the way i prefer to do it:
Put the dvd in the dvdrom drive (AnyDVD removes protection), start CloneDVD2, press start and you got a descent copy in approximately 18 min.
That's all it takes and i'm pleased about this way."
,Valcon,2007-02-07T05:15Z,Thanks!!
,prinsbernh,2007-02-07T07:52Z,"Yet another great part of the series. And I'm happy with the way it is (quality). It takes a lot of time and effort to put this series online, so don't nag about the quality, but be very thankful Mr. Fear puts it up here.

Thanksssss....
                 :-)"
,Iddiz,2007-02-07T09:26Z,"Mr_Fear your work is deeply appreciated... thanks! And to the rest of you guys, seed when finished."
,Iddiz,2007-02-07T09:34Z,"Guys c'mon seed, i'm downloading at 10kB/s, and the average completion is about 0.5.. =/. Hurry upp and bring this ""new"" disc to all TNG-fans out there =)."
,Iddiz,2007-02-07T15:45Z,Now the speed is below 10kB/s... Fear what's your upload-speed anyway? Well I dont wanna nag.. I'm uploading in 200-300kB/s for you guys.
,knarf2006,2007-02-07T20:14Z,"hi mr fear i don't want to nag about the quality

you put this series .so i,m very thankful Mr. Fear 
 and keep up the good work knarf2006"
,kenny999,2007-02-07T20:18Z,"Iddiz: make up the DL speed with your ISP. I dl almost 100kBps w/o problem. Change your client (uTorrent is good).
Mr_Fear: secretly hoping for VOY after TNG ;-)"
,mrhex,2007-02-07T20:19Z,"Its going awfully slow, though. Thankfully i got flatrate cuz atm i have shared 22x my downloaded ratio and i dont see only one seed after 24h of downloading.
i will seed till 100x after i am finished if i ever finish ^^."
,Iddiz,2007-02-07T22:31Z,"kenny999: Thanks for the concern, but it's no problem what'so ever with my connection or ISP, from time to time I dl at 200 up to 300kB/s, but it still hooks up sometimes, and right now the speed is ZERO.. And there's no problem with my client (Azureus 2.5), it works just fine.

Guess Mr_Fear got a slow upload speed, or perhaps it's due to he's still seeding the older disc, tried seeding them, but wouldn't make any difference... anyway I'll seed this disc ~300kB/s when i'm finished, and to quote mrhex ""[...] if i ever finish"". No hard feelings guys... >."
,Sweden(We Try Harder),2007-02-08T13:23Z,THX 1138 Mr Fear
,PLAKPLAATJE,2007-02-09T22:19Z,harstikke bedankt
,Mr_Fear,2007-02-10T03:21Z,"Just for info:
My upload speed on new torrents is 50 kb/s, and on older torrents it's 5-10 kb/s."
,eldard,2007-03-18T11:13Z,Forget this. Go here for 90% quality: http://thepiratebay.org/search/star%20trek%20the%20next%20generation/0/0/0
