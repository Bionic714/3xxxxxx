,Pepswe,2007-02-13T00:14Z,"Finaly!!! vg comment hazylazy! justf-ing google how you burn a dvd, this is not a got damn forum thread! And I would also like people to sharpen upp their english grammatics, sometimes its so bad you can´t even make out the purpose of the comment. And take a second thought before making a comment, don´t waste space. I think its important that the first comments are relevant. I think I speak for all of us when I say that I hate when the first five comments are the same questions and the next five are ""I don´t know.. etc etc...."" then on the next page the real answers and facts take place! Alltough this most often depends on bad info by the uploader so maybe the main problem lays there? Thanks for the word! / Pete"
,ianwilly,2007-02-13T20:22Z,"I'm very happy with this as a CAM, If I wanted better I would go to the cinema and watch it........

He/she didnt write proper, he/she wrote ""And I can write good english""... its a big difference between ""proper"" and ""good"" UFLA"
