,Kalidasa,2008-01-21T06:58Z,Very interesting handwritten and hand illustrated guide book. Really good example of alternative publishing from the 1970's. Fun to read.
,ToddPhilly,2008-03-21T01:42Z,"p.37 has a recipe for the legendary hash from the Mountains of Mexico. 

Fascinating glimpse into hippie scene that existed more than three decades ago. 

Sadly, the people, places, and culture in this guide have changed over time, but the mushrooms persist. 

A great demo of the usefulness of torrents!"
