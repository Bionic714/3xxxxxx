,k8em420,2007-02-24T22:09Z,"Please seed! If I ever get this thing downloaded, I promise to seed!"
,krisgothic,2007-02-25T11:54Z,"No need to request seeds, I am currently seeding and will be seeding for awhile. Nothing worse than an incomplete file (leechers). Please be patient, i will notify when finished initial seeding, downloads will go quicker after that."
,121Y,2007-02-27T13:42Z,"everybody is stucked at 32,8%.... Come on Krigothic, pliiiiiiizzzzzz seed a little more! NO seeder at all!"
,121Y,2007-02-28T12:07Z,"how come did 314 people already download the torrent? Everybody's stucked now at 37.4%, which should mean you're uploading the torrent at a 5%/day rate.... I guess we'll need another 12 days to get it completed.... Pitty, especially with amazing download speed with peaks at 550Kbs! Thanks anyway Krisgothic"
,krisgothic,2007-03-01T11:19Z,"I'm doing the best i can guys i don't have the fastest connection, at least it's crawling around 12 - 20 kb/s almost constantly and i promise you guys won't end up with a crap or incomplete file. We're up to 42.8, the estimate of 10 or 12 days until more seeds is about right. sorry about the delay, please be patient, will continue to seed."
,121Y,2007-03-01T12:43Z,"OK Kris! I just would have liked you to upload the files in sequence: 201, 202, 203 etc... it worked till 203 then it went nuts... That way we'd get our episodes little by little, like on TV! ;) Or posting 1 torrent for each episode....  Thx again and Keep the good work Kris!"
,krisgothic,2007-03-06T03:59Z,"Thank you for your paitence guys, i've finished initial seeding, 100% of file is available. Please enjoy and help others get it by seeding (as i will continue to do). Seeders makes everyone happy!"
,Gissy84,2007-03-06T04:45Z,Why are there 2 of episode 17? and which one is the right one? I've opened both and they're not the same... and the one without the title seems to be the one that goes first but then does that make the one With the title (As we know it part 2) episode 18?
,Gissy84,2007-03-06T05:06Z,I saw something else.. episode 13 is the special one.. so that means episode 14 should be (Begin the Begin) and Ep 15 should be Tell me Sweet little lies... but you got that one as episode 14... where is Begin the Begin??
,krisgothic,2007-03-06T05:57Z,"Honestly i didn't make the recordings nor did i name the files, or know if the name of the episodes are correct,  but i do know that the numbers (201, 202, etc) are in the correct order, it took me a couple weeks to get it all straight. There are 2 episodes 17 because it's a two part special which is why one says part 2. 213 make say 'special' although i do not believe it is. The episode numbers are correct."
,121Y,2007-03-08T02:39Z,thx! just loosing lots of sleeping time watching all that! pitty I watched ep 17 part 2 before discovering there was a part 1.... thx again
,tvjohan,2007-03-08T18:11Z,"i'm getting my head turned inside and out... the episode listing is totally wacko! i've been looking for detailed episode guides everywhere, without success. ep. 16 is part 1, ep. 17 is part 2. but which part 17? probably the unnamed one. Or is part 16 another episode all together? Jeez... Would be nice to sort this out before one starts to watch..."
,tvjohan,2007-03-08T18:57Z,Can it be so simple as to put episode 17 before 217? And hope for the best? That everything will be in correct order then? Has anyone watched it that can comment?
,tvjohan,2007-03-08T23:35Z,"Okey... I've sorted it all out on my own, but unfortunately it was so messy at the end that I can't tell you exactly how it is.

Episode 213 is the special, and 214 is Begin the begin (ie ep 13 according to episode guides...). You have to change the titles subsequently.

Episode 17 is It's the end of the world, and 217 is As we know it.

The other special isn't there, instead it's a double of episode ""17 seconds"". I don't remember were, though. Sorry... But I understand there's some cliffhangers there, so you don't want to get it wrong.

Look at http://epguides.com/GreysAnatomy/ and http://www.greysanatomyinsider.com/episodes/season_2/ to get it right."
,Gissy84,2007-03-09T00:21Z,"Hmm.. and he seemed so sure of himself that I was wrong! :) I just trashed it and downloaded this one instead...


great quality and shows are in order so no confusion! It also downloaded alot faster.. this one took me almost 2 weeks, and the 2nd one from the link took half a day!  Enjoy"
,Gissy84,2007-03-09T00:23Z,It won't let me post the link so... just search for Grey's anatomy in torentspy and its the very first one in the list.
,krisgothic,2007-03-09T03:07Z,"Okay guys, because of the contreversy i rewatched the whole file and regardless of the file names they are in the right order, 213 is a sort of special because it's a collection of what's happened in the series so far. Regarding the double episode of 17. watch 'episode 17"" before ""217 as we know it part 2"" (this is the bomb in body cavity episode - 2 part special). Because of this file name issue over episode 17 in limewire putting together the rest of it in the right order was a little difficult, because some files named the same thing would be different episode numbers. I admittedly got mixed up a bit, so episode number 25 and 26 is the same episode (a double). I'm sorry guys. However the good points are that i understand it's downloading well, it is in the right order (numerically), it is every episode of season 2, good quality and widescreen. Other than the filename issue does anyone else have a major problem? Please download, share and enjoy, seeders make people happy."

,ashleydrury,2007-09-20T02:34Z,can people please seed......
,GreenDorkness,2007-12-13T00:40Z,"Audio is a bit iffy on these -- sometimes some episodes are as loud as you would expect, others are very quiet (need to turn it up to near max to get a reasonable output).

Really irritating mixup with the naming, because if like me, you only download one episode at a time, it will mean you end up downloading one episode out of the correct order. It helps to standardise the format for episode names before seeding.

Otherwise quality is fine. Thanks."
,darkvineyard,2007-12-17T03:32Z,"I so know how it feels to not be able to download something because of the lack of seeders, so I will definitely seed for a while when I get this -- thanks!"
,liinisparrow,2008-01-06T17:56Z,"Can somebody please start seeding this, going for 10 KB/sek... I'll promise to seed this when im done since its really annoying to go this slow.. I know!"
,cosminmihaiu,2008-08-19T15:17Z,"come on guys. PLease, I beg of you, seed a little. I'm at 99,9%, the speed is 1-4 kb/s; the remaining Time: 99:99:99. I can't watch the last 2 episodes. Please seed. I`m uploading with the speed of 231 kb/s right now, and I will seed for one week after it's done. BUT PLEASE, seed.! :( thanks in advance!"
,Marcyss,2008-10-05T01:21Z,"How long will it take to download this ? If it's about several weeks then I won't start it, but if it takes a few days, then I'll seed 200%."
,mongokatten,2009-01-17T12:48Z,Seed please :D
,GabD,2009-06-25T08:20Z,"Where are all the seeders?? 
Can you please seed? "
,chupete,2009-11-07T15:13Z,"please seed... IÂ´ll be seeding too at least for a month, but please help me out now. Thanks..."
,hauntnut,2010-04-05T18:26Z,The incorrect naming of episodes in this torrent is just nuts. I had to go through each episode and review the beginning and end to get them in the correct order. 
,ck85496,2010-06-28T14:59Z,Shame on the leechers.
,TheBoxNinja,2011-04-20T22:22Z,"I had this downloaded in about a day and a half, the speed was fine, the seeders were fine.

As pointed out before, the audio is quite wonky. In some episodes it is quite loud, and in several episodes it is quite quiet.

The episode names are sporadic at best. The names vary from 222, to 2x17, to season 2 episode 6. There are also two episode 17s in this file, and 29 episodes (when there are only 27 episodes in the season)."
,bella292,2011-09-19T15:49Z,"seed please...
thanks.."
