Date last published: 1/29/2007
Download size: 1.5 MB  
This version of Remote Desktop Connection (Terminal Services Client 6.0) can be installed on client computers running Windows XP Service Pack 2. It can be used to connect to terminal servers or remote desktops running earlier versions of Windows, but the new features are available only when the remote computer is running Windows Vista or Windows Server Code Name ""Longhorn."" 

Is tis the same update @ SoLaCe
Why the difference in size ??? "
,SoLaCe,2007-02-09T20:49Z,"TBH Win I am not entirely sure what the difference is, this IS a different file to that one....

... but one thing I can tell you is that this DOES work. I have it running on my XP machine and it is communicating with my Vista setup perfectly!"
