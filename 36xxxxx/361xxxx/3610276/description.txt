In the remote sands of the Moroccan desert, a rifle shot rings out - detonating a chain of events that will link an American tourist couple?s frantic struggle to survive, two Moroccan boys involved in an accidental crime, a nanny illegally crossing into Mexico with two American children and a Japanese teen rebel whose father is sought by the police in Tokyo.
