,dexter_ioio,2007-02-09T22:46Z,"stop crompressing these files... it only save one or two megs and then i delete them after extracting them because it take twice as much space on my drive therefore i dont share as much as i could because of a poor method o sharing already compressed movies????unless anyone knows how to watch movie in mediea player still  rared

,djetm,2007-07-28T13:35Z,"dexter: Compressing is the way that it's done - and the best way. If you can't figure out why, and you hate it that much - don't download."
,Fjetland,2007-08-04T02:17Z,"djetm: well it's not anymore.. its longe time since the torrent clients started to devide the files by itself, so it's true what dexter says that it's just anoying. But before the torrent clients started to devide the files by itself it was smart so you would not need to download the whole file again if something went wrong... but thats ages ago..."
,athomsk,2007-08-26T12:45Z,the reason these files are compressed is so that if 1 rar file is corrupt by file transfer all you have to do is download 1 rar instead of the whole set off rars again !!! 
,latruffa02,2007-09-04T17:29Z,one of the best films i've seen in a long time! strongly recommended...
,illdoya,2007-09-22T16:43Z,"how do i watch this, its a bunch of files instead of a single avi, do i need to convert it or something? and if so, what program?  thanks in advance to anyone who can help me"
,kenzo69,2008-04-06T10:54Z,"I agree that it harms filesharing by rar'ing the files. Nobody cares to seed by duplicating the files before unrar'ing them!

And how often do you experience a corrupt rar file that you redownload??

In my downloading experience it's been maybe 5 out of a 100! 

Rar and bittorrent dont go hand in hand!!!!!!!!!!!!
Its just annoying as hell and hurts the leechers coming later."
,kenzo69,2008-04-06T11:28Z,"By the way, the subs made for this release are spread out on 3 lines.

Does anyone know how to get them back at 2 lines without reading through the whole God damn thing before watching the film???

And to those who makes subs: Your efforts are highly appreciated - but PLEASE make them into 2 lines instead of 3, or even worse 4. The screen is WIDE you know...not high..."

,Hshin,2008-05-13T17:12Z,"If you guys want a better quality version try and look for the iMBT one. I've downloaded this NeDiVx and found the playback a little too choppy due to repeated frames. kolll, might want to check your NTSC>FILM stepdown method, must be a mistake in there somewhere."
,bucsfan,2008-09-22T13:55Z,thx
,jambuban,2010-05-31T06:05Z,How is the quality of this print??
,roua-mat,2010-06-05T23:07Z,to illdoya: right click on ONE of the many rar files and choose extract here.  This will create an AVI file.
