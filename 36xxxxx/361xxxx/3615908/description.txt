Matt Smith reviews yesterday's action from the Championship, including extended 
highlights of Plymouth Argyle v Sunderland at Home Park, where crucial points are at stake, as the sides continue their battle for a play-off place. Plus, Derby County v Hull City, West Bromwich Albion v Southampton, Preston North End v Wolverhampton Wanderers and Birmingham City v Stoke City.
The cameras go to Coventry for interviews with Cyrille Regis and Dennis Mortimer; but why did they ignore Willie Carr? There's also a trip down to Bournemouth to see how 'sick note' is getting on.
All the goals from CC league 1 and 2.
