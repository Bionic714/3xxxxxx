once you open the cm.exe file inside of this editor it will say searching for names etc then u type the name u want like frank lamaprd a screen opens and you can adjust contrac times attriburutes and many more things once you change 1 person simply close the little window that opend for that player and type another name in and repeat this until you have finished changing thing then close the editor and start a NEW game on championship manager 2007 the ganges will have been made"

,Fubarish,2007-12-31T18:51Z,"hey 

first of all.. tyvm for this editor....

but I have some troubles thou... After I´ve made the changes I want...the game doesn´t start???

what parameters should I use when changing a players abilities?

Between 1-255 or can I go higher like 65500?"
,Fubarish,2008-01-01T23:23Z,"hey..nvm my previous comment... I´ve figured it out on my own... to every1 else... 1-100 is the scale when youre altering a players abilities... and of course... 1 is bad while 100 is good....

,jonbeee1,2008-01-02T19:50Z,"hmmm, I usually dont have problems with stuff like this but this one... I dont get it...

All I got from the download was en exe.file. Tried to start it, then error.

So I started CM first and then this exe. Same problem... Is this version sensitive or what?"
,Fubarish,2008-01-14T20:46Z,hmm seems like this only works if you use vista as OS.... I had vista before...and it worked... now I have xp instead..and now it doesn´t work.... :( it refuses to start....
