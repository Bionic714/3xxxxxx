here we have a game editor for championship manager 2007 simply download and install then open the program and open your cm.exe file with the program when typr in a players name which it will find for you to adjust.

you can adjust attributes,contract,age,name,club playing for.etc etc etc

i have used this to great affect making every attribute for a team 20 and changing ages 2 16 please not if you make lowwer than 16 you wont be able to select them in your 1st team if you would like to just say get j.terry for leigh rmi then you can just change the club he player for.

once you have finished changing what ever you want then start a new game and the changes will be done please make sure that the contract start date is before the date in the start of the game i made a mistake and selected 4th feb 2007 to find out i had to wait till then cos the game starts on a date of 1-7-06.

have fun with this.
