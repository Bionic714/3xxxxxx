This is My Revised version of RipIT4Me
In the zip file are two versions a install version 
which just copies the files to C:program files and makes shortcuts
and a NON INSTALL version to just place on the desktop and run

installer changes
1.the installer now DOES NOT copy shortcut.exe to your system
(I am assuming this is what everyone was crying about)
2. the installer now uses messagebox.exe to prompt the user
   the installer DOES NOT copy messagebox.exe to your system

OK if you don't want the shortcuts DON'T use the installer.

The installer places shortcuts to the following locations

C:documents and settingsall usersstart menuprogramsRipIt4Me
C:documents and settingsall usersdesktop

the installer copies the files to C:Program filesRipIt4Me
the uninstaller is available from the start menu and in 
C:Program filesRipIt4Meuninstall.
