When John Klein, a Washington Post journalist, and his wife Mary finally find 
the house of their dreams, they just can't believe their luck. On the way back 
from the bargain, Mary nearly runs over a caped, winged figure, jerks the wheel 
and skids into the sidewalk. She hits her head badly, and dies in the hospital a 
little later. John, completely devastated, soon finds some sketches his wife 
made after the accident. They all show a winged creature, yet there is no angel 
resemblance at all. Two years later, John all of a sudden finds himself one 
night in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He has no idea how he has journeyed the 
400 miles in less than two hours. In the small town, local cop Connie struggles 
with many sightings of a mothlike creature taller than a man being reported, 
while John believes that an explanation for his wife's fate can be found. The 
deeper John digs, the clearer the mothman's purpose arises - only to leave his 
life in immediate danger, as it seems.
