Release Notes: Mourning Dawn is a depressive dark metal band from France. Mourning Dawn was Originally born as a one man band, created by Laurent (from Inborn Suffering). In 2002, Mourning Dawn released 2 demos and one Ep that received very good feedbacks from the critics, especially for their unique extreme vocals and the melancholy that emerges from it.

In October 2005, Laurent decided to propel Mourning Dawn into a full band, and found a line up with JB (guitar), Nicko (drums) & Toxine (bass) (also in Funeralium). At the same time, Laurent composed and recorded the songs for Mourning Dawn's full debut album.

Some call it dark metal, others talk about depressive black metal while many say it's a sort of black/doom metal... Mourning Dawn don't care about styles, don't care about nicknames or meaningless photos, its aim is to play its music and to play it in the most depressive way... So here you can find doom metal, black metal or dark metal like bands as Shining, Deinonychus or Bethlehem, but all is played in a unique and personal way... Simple, sincere and sick, three words that fits Mourning Dawn's music, and will stay engraved in your heart...

Enjoy!
