And still these bloodthirsty murderers who control everything haven't been able to make AJ disappear in a car accident, staged robbery or in any of the other thousands of ways people like that could kill someone... Could it be that Alex Jones is only a a) commercial psychopath that discovered how much money he can earn by feeding feebleminded conspiracy freaks. b) yet another paranoid lunatic that discovers conspiracies in everything from his dirty laundry to the pattern in his neighbours dogs crap (""Hey, that pile looks just like a pyramid... Be gone wicked Illuminati dog!"")"

,tomtomx,2007-02-10T11:30Z,"ikobescak: ""Does that make the fact that John Kerry and George Bush are cousins any less important? ""
Cousins is a mild overstatement. They're obviosly ninth cousins. Meaning that the shared ancestors of both men are Thomas and Welthian Richards of Weymouth, Mass., early 17th century Plymouth Colony residents who were some of the original Pilgrims, emigrants from England.... Wow, this must really have i BIG significance. I bet the pilgrims planned the Bush takeover all those hundreds of years ago... (Wait a minute. If you write the letters Bush and Kerry in a triangle, you end up with a... PYRAMID!)
Btw Kerry is obviously even closer related to Hugh Heffner. I'm sure this also have some big significance concerning the power structure in the US. Beware, the next president is a bunny.

Anyways...those ppl that dare question US politics within the Bush-administration are brave enough to go public with their information. 

Something fishy is going on within the walls of the White House, and especially on those meetings where ""13 families"" meet. Those are the most powerful families in the world. They own pretty much everything on this planet. And they have means to control everything. Even as unthinkable as presidents of USA. Money buys everything. And money has always bought and sought power. Because human way has always been greed and power. Everyone knows this.

,Chrabnet,2008-06-23T22:46Z,"Why Alex Jones isn't dead yet:
Two words:
Conspiracy Theory

Since the public is so accustomed to seeing ""conspiracy-nuts"" on tv and in films being ridiculed, there is such a small chance that Alex will be believed by the masses.

Plus, his cases will rarely be mentioned on tv, and NEVER aired.

Those of us that has had more than 2 years in school will soon recognize the fact that WTC couldn't have fell by planes alone and that by using common sense, we can also see that Alex is dead on with his investigations...

This is NOT an American problem, we see evidence of the same power tripping here in Norway.

Article DOUG SAUNDERS


BRUSSELS ? A week ago, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel found themselves strolling together through the cobble-stoned streets of Colombey-les-Deux-Ă&#x2030;glises, a tiny village in the northeast of France, where they were attending a war-memorial ceremony.

The town is known as a place where French leaders, from the time of Charles de Gaulle, have gone to escape the world and restore their energy. There was much retreating and restoring to be done last Saturday: The previous day, their finance ministers had rushed home early from a Washington crisis meeting after stock markets had crashed dramatically and expensive national schemes to restore the credit system had failed.

None of the patchwork of plans appeared to work and the world economy was threatening to seize up. A few hours earlier, the head of the International Monetary Fund ? a Frenchman ? had declared that the world financial system was ""on the brink of systemic meltdown."" Both leaders had been on the phone with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and they had agreed to follow his plan for governments to purchase major stakes in their countries' failing banks, at huge expense. With that done, anything seemed possible.

It was during their stroll, and over lunch afterward, that these two often-feuding leaders arrived at another conclusion: Nothing would be truly fixed, they believed, until there was a new world financial system in place, a new economic watchdog supervising the world's economies.

 That was a view that had been pushed strongly by Mr. Brown, in a memo that he had begun circulating among associates and leaders, and it agreed, on the surface, with something similar to what Mr. Sarkozy had been saying for weeks: That this was an unprecedented global crisis, beyond the scope or powers of any national government.

The next step, they agreed, would have to involve the whole world, and would require rewriting the rulebook of global capitalism.

With that lunch, Europe had reached a consensus, at least superficially, on a solution that had not been attempted in 64 years: a major global meeting that would attempt to redesign the world-finance system. It was an acknowledgment, at a high level, that with the current crisis, the entire postwar economic system may have come to an end. What comes next will be a matter of heated disagreement.

By Tuesday morning, the Americans were on board, at least as far as attending the proposed meeting ? expected to be held in New York shortly after the Nov. 4 presidential election. Prime Minister Stephen Harper, fresh from his re-election, said Friday he also supports holding the meeting. All the G8 industrialized nations have agreed to attend, at least on paper, and it is expected that China, Brazil and India will take part.

While there's no consensus on what the new financial order should be and there are signs of deeply divergent views, these countries appear at least willing to talk about a new international order at a meeting the three European leaders are calling Bretton Woods II, after the 1944 meeting that started it all.

""Merkel became convinced at Colombey that Brown and Sarkozy were correct that the whole postwar system of finance does not work any more, and something new will have to take its place,"" said a European Union official involved with the talks.

Saturday morning, the Europeans will try to take Washington a step further. Leaving early from the Montreal summit with the Canadian government, Mr. Sarkozy and European Union Commission president JosĂŠ Manuel Barroso will fly to Camp David to sit down with President Ge"

Until this week, that is, when government and money came crashing back into one another. Suddenly, governments are the major providers of loans, and the major shareholders in banks, and the ability to keep the money flowing is beyond the authority of any one country. The idea that central banks can quietly stick to keeping inflation at bay is gone. Once again, we are aiming for the prevention of catastrophes.

On Monday, Mr. Brown arrived at a meeting of the 15 countries that have the euro as their currency and laid out, behind closed doors, that vague but sweeping set of proposals he would make public two days later.

""We now have global financial markets, global corporations, global financial flows,"" he told them. ""But what we do not have is anything other than national and regional regulation and supervision. We need a global way of supervising our financial system.""

The idea became surprisingly popular in Brussels on that day, partly because Mr. Brown's vagueness turned his seven-page plan into something of a Rorschach test on which could be projected each country's economic fantasies. Italian President Silvio Berlusconi talked about a world without the dollar, where the euro might become the reserve currency.

The otherwise conservative Mr. Sarkozy declared in a grandiose speech that ""we need to found a new capitalism, based on values that put finance at the service of companies and citizens, and not the reverse."" Such lines play very well in France, but are not likely to win any high-fives from Mr. Bush this morning in Washington.

Before a meeting date could even be set, the leaders squabbled over who had invented the idea. Mr. Sarkozy, through his aides, make it known that he had been proposing since Sept. 23 that a new global regulatory system be built.

Mr. Brown, in turn, had his aides point out that in January of 2007 he had argued that international finance regulation was ""urgently in need of modernization and reform.""

All of this sounded a bit rich to a community that had watched these European leaders, notably Mr. Brown as Britain's finance minister in the late 1990s, participate in a deregulation and neglect of the financial system that had allowed the complex network of mortgage-backed debt instruments to spiral out of control and destroy the debt-burdened banking system.

,satisfaction,2009-03-07T02:28Z,"I getting sick of morons thinking Alex Jones is inventing all of this. He's just a small part of it. The spin masters are associating all conspiracy information with Alex Jones then poisoning the well. What people will do is dismiss all conspiracy information as ludicrous by association. I've been arrested and accused of conspiracy by the United Sates Government. They believe in conspiracies; And, only a fool would think a trillion U.S. dollars and global domination isn't enough of a motive to conspire to commit crimes in America. So shut up, fuck off, and sit down, - you stupid simpletons."
