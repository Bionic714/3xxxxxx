,ZenMasta,2008-12-23T20:42Z,I downloaded this and couldn't get it the bin.cue to work with daemon tools so I used magiciso and converted it to an ISO. It installed fine but when you try to run it it says CD NOT PRESENT. we need a no cd crack :/
,faszagyerek77,2009-01-26T19:19Z,"This game does not handle CD drive when it's drive letter is over the F: (when using daemon tools use F: E: or D: for drive)

And of course, you need the nocdcheck .exe too from the CRACK dir..."
,faszagyerek77,2009-01-26T19:22Z,"when running from XP, use the compatibility mode (right click on the shortcut -> properties -> compatibility tab -> windows 95 mode)"

,chinz1337,2010-11-07T00:08Z,"This one doesn't has music, nor any other version I found, heck I even found 4 PSX ones, but non of them had music.

But I'd rather play that PSX one because playing this game with keyboard was lame."
