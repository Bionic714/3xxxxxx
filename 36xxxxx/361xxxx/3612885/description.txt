these are three bootable cdrom iso image files with ghost 11.0 for dos.
Please read the read me text.Ghost will back up linux partitions also
even though I have only done an ext2 system.
1 Multi boot manual everything means you use the ghost gui for everything
 this version can not make bootable images.
2 multi boot standard makes bootable CD DVD images and I made a restore menu item
  that can grabs your image from the CD DVD and automatically starts the restore  process you can also do it manually.
3 single boot just like #1 this can not make bootable images.
1 and 3 use eltorito.sys cdrom driver that even works on the newer sata DVD drives
2 uses a standard oakcdrom type driver.
