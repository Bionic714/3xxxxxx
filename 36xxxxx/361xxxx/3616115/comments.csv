I met Skandal in the freezing cold outside Plan B in Brixton where he was selling his CDs out of a cardboard box. That's what the UK Rap scene is like. Fuck the major labels, but if you can afford an internet connection you can afford to buy penniless independent artists' hard work. 

Give them the recognition they deserve."
