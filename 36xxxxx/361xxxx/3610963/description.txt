These bootable cdrom iso images contain "ghost dos version" and will let you image your hard drive for backup/disaster recovery. 
Please read the how to text document.

this application works on other file systems besides ntfs and fat,fat32
I have personally abcked up an ext linux system with this.

There are two versions in the zip file

one does everything manually and can not make bootable images

the othe has an automatic restore feature and can make your CD DVD backup image bootable.

It is all detailed in the how to document.
