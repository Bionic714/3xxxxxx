Thanks anonoymous_2012

I just want to note though that my other backups are made with ghost 8.3.

The standard version of this which makes your cd/dvd bootable is ghost 8.2  which wouldn't even touch the image made with 8.3.

Hope that helps.

I went ahead and made a bootable back up with this and verified it. No problems found.

Is this common procedure for ghost not to work with it's own files?"
,DarthBubba,2007-02-06T09:24Z,"So how do you tell which .ISO is which?  They both have the same names.  The dates and sizes are a little different, but that doesn't help."
,bapb454,2007-02-06T13:20Z,"In my torrent there are two folders. Each has a ghost torrent in them. The folder named ""multi standard with image-restoremenu"" has the .ISO in it that makes the image bootable which is 6.68 MB in size. It is the smaller of the two files.

There is a HOW TO USE text file also. Might help if you read it. Might not... :)"

The folders are only visible in Winzip if you run it fullscreen; the Path is truncated if Winzip opens as a smaller window.  A simple mistake, much like expecting an older version of Ghost to read an image made by a later version.  :)

The How To isn't written very well.  Giving each .ISO a distinctive name would've been more helpful."

umm. I don't believe I wrote that I was expecting anything other than what was offered. I noted my observations, asked a question, and answered your questions truthfully.

Did you get it figured out or are you still reading the HOW TO USE.txt?

The HOW TO USE.txt file is written well enough that I understood what was going on with one read of it. 
Maybe if you trash winzip and use a respectable file archiver those problems you are having wouldn't exist.  Try winrar if you use windows, IMHO it's a far superior program than the proprietary archiving winzip uses,  and also the default zip manager in XP will let you view the hierarchy of the file system...
With Linux I use fileroller as the archive manager http://fileroller.sourceforge.net/.


Hope that helps you :)"
,anonoymous_2012,2007-02-07T15:27Z,"thanks for the feedback.
I'm not perfect and the files were zipped with winrar
and put into seperate folders with different names.
as far as the iso sizes they uses different drivers and etc.the menus are just text in a config file.I just posted a newer version with ghost 11.0"
