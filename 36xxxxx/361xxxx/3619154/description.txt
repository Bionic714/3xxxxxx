uTorrent has just been upgraded to version 1.6.1 (February 14th), and since I had major problems getting through and fetching the file from utorrent.com, I decided I'ld share it with you guys once I got hold of it (took me an hour or so to get it!).

I read that the last version (1.6) supposedly has some security issues, but for all I know this alledged problem could be just a gimmick to get some free PR for the latest version.  

Either way, here it is - enjoy!
