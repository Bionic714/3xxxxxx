""Changing your thinking changes nothing out there, in the vast universe surrounding you. It changes something inside of you. Changing your perception, your focus, your emotions and your thinking from negative to positive (from what you lack to what you want) has an enormous effect on your motivation, energy and creativity and that's why you will then be more efficient working towards your goals. It's that simple.""

but in relationships there is another principle governing: the principle of reciprocity. So if you focusing on your partners positive sides in your thinking, that will come back to u."

If you are a cleaner, parking attender, live of wellfare, alcoholic, druggie, a hillbilly ( or from Hisingen/Bromma in sweden) , gayhater, rasist, pedophile or close AND you spend your days looking at other peopels faults ( classic projection) in order to avoid seeing and feeling your own misery....

... AND you enjoy it and have no intention to change your life: 
THEN DO ABSOLUTELY NOT DOWNLOAD THIS - it may cause strong reactions to you and you might see how you COULD live - this of course may have you to post stupid comments here and farting through your mouth as some people already have.


IF THIS IS NOT YOU .... then ""the secret"" is nothing new- it is a way of living. However in this movie it is presented in a maybe more appealing way to the modern western person. What may have scared the, as mentioned above, lonely and scared people from the outskirts of Sweden who listen to rasistrock and drink beer on tuesdays watching the exciting game of ""Handboll"" - is the unfortunate hollywood way of presenting it where they focus on wealth, money and building expectations through music etc.... 

But however, I downloaded this( with many other resources like this) 1 year ago and my life has become just the opposite. You see I was like the swedish scared people before - and I came from a background where my father constantly complained and projected his own fear onto others. I was lonely, scared, angry, and had accomplished nothing ( else than jerking off twice each day ).

I was 25 when I decided to change this and these resources helped me alot. Today I am 26 and I am always happy, positive ( might not look like it here he he ;) smiling. All my friends returned after they saw that I wasnt complaining anymore, I got hundreds of new friends. I fuck at least 2 new women each week and trust me they are hotties from the age 20 to 45. 
I have now sold my first succesfull comany for 1,2 million swedsih kronor ( not much, but it keeps me going). 

LOOK, its all up to YOu and how YOU WANT to view it. Of course its easier to not beleive in this, but waht are you then doing here and downloading it?? Just keep on with your live - but if your not satisfied - then do something about it and The Secret is a great way to start.

Thank you for reading this far - it means that you are serious. 

Puss p책 rumpan. "

,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:29Z,"If you are interested in this subject matter, you will definitely want to get the following torrent: 

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.
