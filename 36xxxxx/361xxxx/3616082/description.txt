Well, the label itself wanted to have these spread (orginally at my
little page http://www.eurobeat.se/) so I'll upload them here so they
can be even more spread :) Whats the point with music if nobody her it?

This must be my first legally music torrent :)

The genre is eurodance and I like the songs. Here is the homepage for
the band: http://www.joelkalsi.com/dc-10/
