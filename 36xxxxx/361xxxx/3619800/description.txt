SYNOPSIS:
During the late 1980s, a Canadian social worker, Paula Jackson, investigated a commune run by a leader who referred to himself as Moses, a messiah figure with eight wives and several children. Her findings shocked Canada when the body of a dead child turned up. It was not long before Ms. Jackson uncovered disturbing mental and physical abuses of the members of this cult by its maniacal leader. Having come from an abusive background herself, Ms. Jackson found herself fighting to save those who were followers of this brutal, manipulative, and murderous leader. Polly Walker plays Paula Jackson and Luc Picard gives a truly frightening performance as the cult leader in director Mario Azzopardi\\\\\\\'s film version of these terrifying events which shook Canada.
