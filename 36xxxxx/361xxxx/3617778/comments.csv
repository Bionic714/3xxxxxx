,Daedric35897,2007-02-20T01:05Z,"LAWL, This TOTALLY SUCKS! ""Hamachi Beta Demo"" and the only thing we can play is on LAN (Local area network) 

wich means, cant play over internet, and only with your buddys in the same are as you.. 

dont download this, its not worth it...

besides, there is no npc`s, mobs... not all weapons are available or items etc.. 

we have waited for this game to long to play it like a Counterstrike version, by a noob LAN Version!

it will be out at bout the 26:th just gnna buy it, and dont trust ret versions!"
,bltsponger,2007-02-20T02:14Z,"You sir, are a moron.  Do you know what Hamachi is? Look it up. Not all weapons are available because you have to unlock them.  45 kills gets you everything on the chart, with various incremental upgrades along the way. There are no NPCs because it's a fucking MP beta, not a SP beta.  Read the name of the torrent you download next time."

Cheaters, campers, bug exploters - you name it. Every type of worthless, unfit-for-life retard can be found in the beta, which is damn sad. It prevents you having fun, which is the POINT of a game.

Gonna pirate the full version instead of paying to get idiots up my ass XD: Suggest you do so too."
