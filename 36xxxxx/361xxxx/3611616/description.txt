        Synopsis

In the not-so-distant future, Earth is controlled by a giant corporation called Men-Tel. After escaping from a maximum security prison known as The Fortress, renegade John Brennick and his wife and son are fugitives on the run. But Brennick is soon apprehended again and placed in a futuristic state-of-the-art maximum security prison recently completed by Men-Tel. Orbiting 26,000 miles from Earth, the prison houses the planets most fierce criminals, forcing them to perform dreaded space labor amidst meteor showers and other harsh elements. Here, Brennick is locked down by hi-tech security jail cells and surrounded by an elaborate system of computer surveillance devices, including a camera placed inside his body. If Brennick ever wants to be re-united with his wife and son, he has no hope but to try to escape -an idea that was never thought possible... until now!
