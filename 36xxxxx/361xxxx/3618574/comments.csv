,cultleader,2007-03-10T18:33Z,"BAD TORRENT...
Picture quality: Excellent
Sound quality: Excellent.

BUT...

The movie is incomplete! It lacks around 5 min of footage! And I don't mean it doesn't have the credits or so, but the missing scene(s) are from the middle of the movie!

If you like to watch cut, incomplete releases, go for it. If obviously you don't, then don't bother."
,Cucamonga,2007-03-12T22:06Z,"After 65 downloads only you reported problems. I guarantee that movie is ok. Probably you had any downloading problem. Force a recheck of downloaded files and you torrent client will discover the damaged part and download it again automatically.

Good luck."
,Gomorra,2007-06-14T03:42Z,huh? what is a Mac? something used for gfx?
,miensch,2007-07-22T06:57Z,"This is the 1964 movie filmed in black & white. Good quality widescreen 1.85:1 video and sound in English. Great movie, worth the download!

,jslind,2008-02-03T12:24Z,"Why the fuck can't you just use the usual codecs, instead of forcing people to install random shite like that??"
,rm1beavis,2008-02-07T03:59Z,"Thanks, saw this first a long time ago, but just late last year read the book, which was quite good as well.  My appologies for the folks that get something for free, then proceed to whine about aspects of it they don't like."
,442mike,2008-09-07T20:00Z,"This doesn't play with VLC Media Player, damn you and you crappy codec!  Use something standard, 'cause I'd love to watch this movie!"
,Cucamonga,2008-09-27T15:04Z,"Look, if you don't want this ""weird"" or ""crappy"" codec, then don't download this film! Simple that.

I use these codecs because they gave me much more quality than shitty DivX/MP3. If you don't want that high quality just search for another release and don't bother me."
,vietvet52,2008-11-21T02:52Z,"the movie is on t v right now, and i got on PB and thanks for the upload,.."
,Cucamonga,2008-12-14T13:05Z,"If you could put two brain cells working together, install the codec and use the bundled player (Media Player Classic) to open the files. After that, you will need only someone to explain to you what the movie is about because I believe that you will not understand any reasonable english dialog, asshole!"
,zombino,2009-03-24T23:26Z,"First ever clip in over two years that doesn't play on VLC. Kinda weird, cuz i have other ogm stuff that works....
No wonder this pisses some folks off. Gotta install SMPlayer to handle this. I don't blame them, they want to watch a movie and not fuck around trying to install new software to see it. Thanks anyway Cuca."
,Kanuck88,2009-04-27T12:55Z,I just spent three hours trying to get these random codecs to work!!! WTF!? Use something standard you asshole!!!
,MrSmartyPants,2009-05-02T07:26Z,"I was about to DL this, but I definitely WILL NOT now, after reading the comments. Thank gawd for comments. I've got better thing to do than to search around for codecs and troubleshoot a simple desire to watch a classic movie.

Screw that. looks like you're makin' friends real quick, Cucamonga.

xvid/avi. 'nuff said hoser."
,MPI_Mallard,2009-05-04T01:13Z,IDIOT!!!
,Cucamonga,2009-05-29T02:12Z,"I'm not worried about getting new friends. My only concern is quality. If you prefer XviD/MP3, God help you. Go ahead and search again. By other hand, if you really want good quality, try this but remember: install KL codecs."
,boxorats,2010-05-22T22:10Z,"I can't believe all these filthy animals cursing out someone for taking the time/effort to upload something for them! Unbelievable! He's trying to get people to take a look at some different codec that might be better than the crappy codecs a lot of people use -- which is well worth doing! It boggles the mind that rather than everybody else cursing out the first retard to curse _him_, you've got a lot more scumbags getting on the bandwagon instead! It never ceases to amaze me how stupid -- and pointlessly disgusting -- people are. I kind of wish I'd been born a peregrine falcon or some other elegant creature rather than sharing the same DNA with these pieces of filth! Sorry, Cucamonga, man -- all I can do is sympathize in amazement and disgust."
,boxorats,2010-05-22T22:11Z,I mean he even takes the time to very clearly explain exactly what the deal is with instructions and everything! It's not like it's incoherent and confusing! Christ!
,moshster,2010-08-23T01:29Z,Why oh why can't people just use x264/ACV/MPEG4 like normal people.
,moshster,2010-08-23T01:30Z,"A more standard release:

,saligrama,2010-10-09T10:54Z,dude cuca..do you work for KL codecs?? plz help me out by adding a few URLs man..am a tech retard..just add a few links on which site gives me these codecs..plz..
,Cucamonga,2011-01-31T21:51Z,"Dude, you can get KL Codec at www.codecguide.com 

There are different packs with different codecs. I suggest you Mega or Full packs. Just install it keeping default settings. Then, use Classic Media Player (bundled with packs) to watch the movie.

Good luck."
,velcroman0001,2011-09-21T13:17Z,Why could you not just rip the movie and leave it as an .AVI?  Oh no you couldn't do THAT that would to easy!  After all you're EGO is so low you have to make yourself look clever.  Well guess what you failed.... again.  You still look like a prat!
,goodmoons,2012-05-19T23:45Z,TY!
