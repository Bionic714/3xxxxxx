,flightrisk,2007-02-20T05:51Z,"To activate the serial, simply unpack, install, and run quicktime. in the file dropdown, go to preferences and click the register radio button. copy and paste the user name and pass code from the .txt file and you're now a pro. good luck..."
,flightrisk,2007-02-20T05:54Z,"so it's actually in the edit dropdown and one just has to scroll through until s/he gets to the preferences and from there the registration. regardless, it's fairly simple, no?"
