President Bush sent a $2.9 trillion spending plan to the Democratic-controlled Congress on Monday, proposing a Pentagon budget of $624.6 billion for 2008, more than one-fifth of the total budget. According to the AP, the Pentagon included details for the upcoming budget year on how much the Iraq war would cost -- an estimated $141.7 billion for fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the cost of repairing and replacing equipment lost in combat. 

The Democrats were dumbstruck. Defense Secretary Gates called it "sticker shock." 

Part of his plan to balance this behemoth includes $78 billion in cuts in the government's big health care programs -- Medicare and Medicaid -- over the next five years. He'll also push Congress to make his tax cuts (for the wealthy) permanent.

What a compassionate conservative.

I would suggest that the idea that Bush can balance THIS budget without raising taxes is like believing in the tooth fairy; a tooth fairy that leaves your teeth AND pockets your money.


We'll crunch the nuumbers tonight.
