SKINNY PUPPY - AINT IT DEAD YET


This is from the original DVD. The audio was originally fucked.

I assumed they simply ripped the VHS audio and transcoded it to AC3. The original audio was really, really awful. It cut out, there was no bass
and sometimes certain channels would go out completely for a while.

I took the FLAC rip of "Aint it Dead Yet" and just upsampled it to 48KHz then put the resolution to  16bits. Then I sync'd it using Cool Edit Pro.... it was a pain in the ass but it's well worth it. You can hear some oversampling, but it still sounds very very good. And loud.

Also, the original menus were quite fucked as well. After a song would finish, it would bring you back to the main menu. I just decided
to get rid of it all together. Make your own if you want.

Hope you enjoy. :)
