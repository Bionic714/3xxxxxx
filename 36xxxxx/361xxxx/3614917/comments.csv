was just doing a trial torrent to show a friend how to upload to the pirate bay! :)
just so u know as it is allready uploaded, it is version 3.0.0.214 beta
but in future any one downloading should maybe check what they are downloading, if u had checked you would see that skype is a free download as dasbot said above http://www.skype.com/download/skype/windows/downloading_beta.html"
