STORY - After 'Thiruda Thirudi', which was a massive hit, director Subramania Siva's next venture is 'Pori' (meaning Spark) produced by Sambandhan Karthi of Nivi-Pavi Creations.

The movie is packaged with romance, action, dance, celebrations, smiles and tears according to Subramania Siva. Amidst all this, there is also a message that 'a good man never gets defeated and a man who is defeated could not be a good man.' No one is free of problems in life.
