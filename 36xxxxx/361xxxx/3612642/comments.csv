,pomares,2007-09-18T20:14Z,"k, seems to be working fine. :-)"
,Yesmaniac,2007-09-26T03:10Z,This is a different gig than the Japanese release. That was sourced from Shoreline Amotheater in Mountainview CA and is only about half of the show. This came from Denver and is complete.
[V],n0b0dyh0me,2009-09-29T14:37Z,"excellent picture and sound???

the images are blurred most of the time
the guitars are ""raped"" in the background and in general there's no a decent mix off all the instruments

Ok, it's a bootleg and I loved it as a memory of Yes and I appreciate them even if they're played in the bath tub, but the audio and picture are hardly sufficient... anyway thanks a lot :))"
