For those of you who don't already know, the Union tour blended the two most recognizable lineups of Yes; 
the classic '70's version and the 90125 era of the band. The result is among other things, that you get to experience two guitar 
virtuosos in the persons of Steve Howe and Trevor Rabin. The presentation on this dvd 
is impeccable and should not be missed if you are a fan of any era of Yes. Enjoy!
