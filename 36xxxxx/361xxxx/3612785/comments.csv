Have  you noticed that the only people that complains are always them who never upload anything"
,deviantmaster,2007-02-17T05:01Z,"I am so tired of hearing everyone whine about this uploader. This guy is doing his best to gove of everything. Not everything is to everyones taste BUT he is one of the cornerstones here. So, unless you have comments about the quality of the files/seed/rip or similar...pour yourself a nice hot cup of shut the fuck up. "
,sherbert,2007-02-19T16:21Z,"Your getting shitty with a guy thats down loading on his own time , comment on the quality and type of movie. "
,brasko,2007-05-26T21:18Z,"Obviously, the ratings on IMDB are based purely on taste. I kinda have a different taste, so kollll, please keep them coming!

BTW, I like arthouse, foreign cinema, hollywood blockbusters, martial arts movies, blaxplotation, cheap comedy and everything in between. Always remember, there's a market for every movie.

(Well, expect for Gigli ;-) )"
