LEAKED ^^

Informations about VAC2 Detection

Some people say memory hacks are detected already(they didn\'t use coconuT I guess), most people say its undetected(It is, since coconuT alpha :P).
Fact is that coconuT and the versions before 2.3 never(!) got detected by Valve\'s VAC2.
If you don\'t believe what is written here, simply don\'t use coconuT.
