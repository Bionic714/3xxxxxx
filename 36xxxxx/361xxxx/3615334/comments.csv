This video course is much better than the Live class offered by TEFLINTERNATIONAL.

Thanks to Dave Hopkins for lending the DVD's.

Without his help this posting of the course would not be possible."
,daveshelper,2007-12-17T09:50Z,"NOTE: Teaching Grammar Scott Thornbury disk 16 and disk 17 are NOT the same.

There are 2 sessions of this Lesson."
,daveshelper,2007-12-19T05:30Z,"Available for download via email:

ONE ONLY per person...

Disk 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, OR 24 (more soon)

These can be forwarded to Gmail (email) only.

Each file is split into parts small enough to send by gmail.  

Suggest using Firefox browser with Gspace plugin.  Makes downloading/uploading a long list of files with single click.

Same as above - sent through GSpace in files approx 9meg, split using GSplit, with an *.exe that will recompile them when all finished dowloading.

As suggested to me by davethenave, I've set up some accounts just to keep these files in, then I can easily send them to others, or download them to any computer with Internet access! Works for me!! (you'll need 3 accounts if this is what you want to do, too!!)

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.
