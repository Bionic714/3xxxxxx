,jonis500,2007-02-10T01:00Z,"thanks man, really need this one.. can you confirm that it wont brick my unit?"
,jonis500,2007-02-10T01:00Z,Or do I need a cd-key/serial?
,rdschwan,2007-02-14T23:48Z,"You can only use this if you have either a basic or advanced Dell Axim X5 with Pocket Pc 2002 installed, no key is required and make sure you backup your current rom (It gives you the option!) just incase something happens. While upgrading besure your devive is plugged in and dont mess with it while upgrading (itll mess up!)"
