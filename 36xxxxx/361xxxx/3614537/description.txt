Release Notes: KEEN OF THE CROW, the Southern California-based quintet featuring drummer Rhett Davis and bassist Justin Christian of renowned doom druids MORGION, has just released a three-song EP, entitled "Premonition", via Grau Records. Described as "a mixture of doom, death, and black metal yet eclectic in nature," KEEN OF THE CROW's music "derives from a very melodic in intent yet punishing heavy culmination. Imagine if MORGION, CELTIC FROST, CANDLEMASS, PRIMORDIAL, and NEUROSIS joined forces, it would be labeled appropriately KEEN OF THE CROW."

KEEN OF THE CROW is rounded out by guitarists Ron Slater (NEPENTHEAN) and Seth Arthur. A full-length album, entitled "Hyborea", is expected in the spring. Kris Verwimp, renowned fantasy/conceptual artist, shall render the visuals for "Hyborea" along with the graphic and photographic expertise of Gary Griffith (MORGION).

Enjoy!
