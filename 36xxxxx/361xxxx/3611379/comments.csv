,Nugem,2010-01-21T12:50Z,"The game data is around 3MB the CDA takes up the remaining 645+ MB. Thats why this was one of the only games you could play and take the game out of the CD-DRIVE and replace the game CD with an audio CD. 

The game was small enough to completely load into the Sony PlayStation RAM.
