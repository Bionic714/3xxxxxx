Aspartame - Sweet Misery, A Poisoned World
------------------------------------------

Video Chronicles Medical Horrors of Aspartame

An industry case study of a food supply in crisis 

After 7000 miles, and 25 hours of footage, "Sweet Misery" reveals one of the most pervasive, insidious forms of corporate negligence in the history of the industrial revolution. The toxic long-term effects of aspartame are often dismissed as a "hoax" by the sweetener industry and at least five other Internet websites. The real footwork, however, unravels something less comforting than a mere "Hoax." "Sweet Misery" is a documentary just released by Sound and Fury Productions. 

"Aspartame is inherently, markedly and uniquely unstable in aqueous media" is a quote from the congressional record in 1985, yet it was approved for use in soft drinks and other beverages. 

So what happened? 

Is there credible evidence if you look beyond the smokescreen of corporate medicine? The primary research and interviews have been quite disturbing.
