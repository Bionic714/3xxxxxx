"According to this installment of the series, the war of the future will be quite 

different from past conflicts, with their body counts and destruction of cities. War will 

be fought with new weapons that don't necessarily kill or maim, but render the enemy 

unable to fight or defend. Tanks, bombs, and other convention weaponry will be dated 

objects of the past, unneeded in a war that utilizes the highest technological 

instruments. Ultrascience 2: War 2020 discusses what these weapons will consist of, and 

provides a look at how computer networks will have a critical role in future battles."
