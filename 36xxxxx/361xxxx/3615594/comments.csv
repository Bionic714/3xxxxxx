,atlantisisdead,2008-10-05T02:54Z,"It's too bad this torrent has been so leeched.  A handful of us sat at 93% - then a seeder somehow appeared but didn't stick around long enough to bring the availability to 1.0 .. it was .93 matching the 93% we were sitting at, wouldn't have taken very long. Now it's under 1.0 again.. which means (for newbies) that we don't get to have it. Someone please rejoin and seed. Leave when availability becomes at least one whole copy."
