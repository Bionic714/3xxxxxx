,ballzack10,2007-08-09T06:02Z,"ok this dose not work when u first get it but u can get it to work, u just need to get the demo of it and  right click on the installer and go to ""show package contents"" then open the Contents folder, you will see a folder called ""MacOS"" take this folder and replicate it in the same place as the one you downloaded.                                                  ""this should work for you it did for me"""
