,penis123,2007-02-14T20:00Z,does anyone think it's a fake?
,Derc,2007-02-14T20:54Z,"Fake?? Absolutely not from what I can gather. NForce has this listed here .. http://www.nforce.nl/index.php?switchto=nfos&menu=quicknav&item=viewnfo&id=110853
I'm not sure about the NETSHOW group though. From what I can tell they are a fairly new Japanese group with only two releases. This one is not nuked (full version). Thanks ohno.. I'll rate after I install and run it a bit. 
;0) 
My question is... this is in english from what I've read?"
,GissaVem,2007-02-14T21:27Z,"hmm mouse support, sounds good, my biohazard is not with mouse use... anyone can confirm this is real?"
,Derc,2007-02-14T21:43Z,Hmmm just noticed... only one file is packed. So no .sfv to keep files from corrupting during download. Hope everyone has a good torrent program. This might need to be repacked once someone has a good working image.
,penis123,2007-02-14T22:32Z,nice
,Karras,2007-02-14T23:42Z,"Its probably not fake, I downloaded this from Torrentleech some weeks ago and it work fine!"
,Derc,2007-02-15T05:33Z,okay loads good and the Mouse loader works too. Thanks again ohno..!! I'll continue to seed this for another 9 hours. :)
,Derc,2007-02-15T05:36Z,"Oh BTW... you'll need to go into your install directory and run SetupTool.exe, run the setup if you want to change screen resolutions. I think the default was 800x600."
,x-Zon,2007-02-15T07:02Z,this is not a fake i am installing it now..thx man good work
,x-Zon,2007-02-15T07:36Z,i have a problem my game cant find a dll file..but it becous i have windows vista i think
,Derc,2007-02-15T16:33Z,@x-Zon: Did you install the .dll that came with the mouse loader? Follow the directions if you havent already.
,Nele,2007-02-16T00:19Z,ni som har problem med dll. gå till den her sida och lada ner och klistrai biohazard mapp http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_30
,shararm,2007-02-16T01:15Z,Hey  I downloaded and I dont understand how to make my mouse work plase help
,PetePetePete,2007-02-16T15:17Z,thx :)
,Xiphias83,2007-02-16T20:50Z,"I think this game is fake big time!
I have read that it is some guy that has converted the Gamecube version directly to PC.
This version has been on the net for a long time but with no mouse support. Ubisoft is the developer of the real version of Resident Evil 4 to PC and has added extra material. There is no sign of Ubisoft in this release."
,U-MEN,2007-02-16T22:22Z,worst graphics i have seen in a long time... 
[T],Knaster,2007-02-16T22:32Z,"Xiphias83 if this is fake then the frauder must have made a new sound intro with the same voice cause he says ""Biohazard 4"" in the voice of all the other resident evil games. No mister this aint fake u idiot"
,VilleR2,2007-02-18T00:13Z,"THIS IS NOT THE REAL RESIDENT EVIL 4 FOR PC. This is more like a conversion from the GC/PS2 game. So, buy it for Gamecube or wait for the real version!"
,brainz,2007-02-18T02:02Z,Unfortunately it's not a fake... why? First of all it goes without saying that this is a very quickly made conversion. Arrow-keys on the keyboard for moving the camera - HEY COME ON! And the graphics... oh god the graphics. Well if the game would be at least somewhat playable I might let it go with a warning :/
,PersonalJudas,2007-02-18T08:14Z,"Is this real? My bro sold my PS2 and my copy :(
If it is, can I burn it to a DVD? 'Cuz I know the comp I'm using can't handle it."
,josyp,2007-02-18T18:32Z,"I have big problem with this game, when game starts and after video ends i get message VPU Recover has reset your graphics accelerator or it was no longer responding to graphics driver commands ... 

does anybody else have this problem?

,Spyke88,2007-02-20T18:29Z,"I've got it for the ps2, and it completely and utterly rocks! :D
Don't go for some crappy conversion!"
,-OLDBOY-,2007-02-20T19:22Z,"I also have it for PS2, is it worth to try it on PC as well?"
,GissaVem,2007-02-20T20:43Z,you guys who plays this game to pc with mouse support must be fucking retarded all of you... why use a mouse to a first shooter game? i tried this mouse support and it was fucking worthlessss!!!!!
,lordkhan,2007-02-21T00:27Z,"The pc version will have improved graphics. This ain't the real pc version, it's just more like an earlier version. xD"

,anuskasvo,2007-02-22T09:12Z,"Hmm I'm now in chapter 5.2, so we'll see soon if this crashes at 5.3. This game is very good to play with mouse support (unplayable with just the keyboard), the graphics look like they're from 1998 but hell... it's still a good game."
