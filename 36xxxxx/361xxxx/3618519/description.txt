Filmed in Clacton-on-sea in Essex! :) From a PAL VHS Copy, as it has NEVER been released on DVD.

A very odd and arty \"concept\" film, you have to see it to make up your own mind - personally i quite like it. One of the more amusing elements is the appearance of Barbara Windsor as Neil Tennant\'s Aunt / Mum ! It\'s definitely a must for any PSB fan who does not have it in their collection.

Was ripped to MPEG-2 DVD-5 size using an Adaptec AVC-2410, and a Hi-Fi Stereo VCR (on \"soft\" picture), and then converted to DivX5 using Handbrake on OSX. 

The results are quite good, but some of the beach scenes \"white out\" a bit, plus there is the usual VHS noise (for example, the black sky during the night scenes is a bit speckled). Some of you more knowledgable types may be able to clean it up by applying filters.

Format : DIVX5 (ffmpeg)
Audio : Stereo 128kbps MP3 48khz
Dimensions : 720 x 448 25fps
(the MPEG-2 when ripped was the usual PAL size of 720 x 576), however there were black borders top and bottom of the picture, so handbrake was set to trim them off).

I\'d like to see more video torrents in the universe have this level of technical detail with them (hint, hint...) so i can make up my mind whether to download or not!!!

Enjoy :)
