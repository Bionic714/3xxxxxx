,Enzio_Ferrari,2007-02-16T14:08Z,"I've wasted 2 discs trying to burn this with Nero 7. Each time the disc will not verify compared to the original file and installation fails.
If I attempt to install from the downloaded file directly it will not install without a serial number.
If you've installed this please let us all know what you did differently."

,kruder111,2007-03-25T00:29Z,"Why doesn't anybody care if this version is good enough for a genuine validation at microsoft.com? Nobody care? I can tell you all: THIS SHIT DOES NOT WORK! Please make sure it's good enough for validation before you upload rdj550.

This is what you get at microsoft, when trying to update:

Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003:

Validation Failed
The product key used to install Office has been blocked by Microsoft.

,Sazs,2007-04-21T00:23Z,"Where is Frontpage 2003?

I have installed it, and no frontpage, can someone please help me to find it?"
,Sazs,2007-04-21T00:25Z,"Thanks rdj550 for this great torrent :)

Would be so nice if someone would answer my question just above. Downloaded this because of frontpage 2003."

,rdj550,2007-04-26T04:56Z,"sorry i haven't answered any questions
not in order....
1)this was my first torrent thanks for all the comments and as of right now 5300+ downloads i think speaks for itself...
2)
this will not be able to be updated above sp2 for office...i will upload sp2 for office as well as 3, but 3 doesn't install on my machine...so good luck...
3)as for any problems and programs that need serials, i have never needed a serial and have burned, installed,  and given to many people  with many different computers and none have required serials....and as for ""frontpage""...that was my mistake, shouldn't have put that up...sorry...if u want to get mad, get mad....ill try and answer any other questions that you may have...."
,Chris Rose,2007-06-17T22:34Z,"Ok, this is my first crack at this. I ended up with a file that has an ISO extension. What do I do with that?"
,part7,2007-06-18T01:37Z,"@Chris Rose

Either mount the file on a virtual drive with Daemon Tools(google it), or burn it to a CD with any decent burning app(sonic, nero)"
,gnohiew,2007-07-19T06:53Z,Can this version pass validation ? 
,equalmc3,2007-08-16T03:07Z,"cripes, my office 2000 disc 1 CD just exploded in my cd drive, can somebody seed it?"

,Mr-OsX,2007-09-27T16:30Z,"Burned the ISO to a CD and when I went to install it setup.ini couldn't be found.  Downloaded a free Windows XP utility (by Microsoft) to mount the ISO directly and that worked just fine.  No license key required for this ISO.  Thanks!
