Near Valentine\\\'s Day 2007, a song from the album, \\\"My Violent Heart\\\", was found on a USB drive in a bathroom at a NIN show in Lisbon, Portugal.

A clip of what appears to be the chorus to \\\"Survivalism\\\" can be heard by calling the telephone number 1-310-295-1040.

I hope you all enjoy this as much as I do. Call the number.


On February 12, 2007, fans found that NIN\\\'s most recent merchandise designs contained highlighted letters that spell out the words \\\"I am trying to believe.\\\" It was discovered that iamtryingtobelieve.com was registered as a website, and soon several other related websites surfaced, describing a dystopic vision of the world some fifteen years in the future. Several numbers on the websites seem to reference passages in the Bible. Also, a lot of the text is scrambled on these pages but if you highlight it with the mouse it will unscramble.
