I reccomend to put FS2004 / FSX in front of the title in your upload ;-)

FS2004 - Stopworks Falcon 4.0 Pits *ALL*

(for example)"
,FlankerBoy,2007-02-11T01:33Z,"dude, he said falcon 4.0, does that sound like MS2004?"
,Korick,2007-02-11T01:35Z,"Thank you Flankerboy ...

THIS IS FOR FALCON 4.0 FROM MICROPROSE!!!!
Read the forum link I posted for the updates about the most realistic combat flight sim you could ever own! 
For the time being that is.."

,chuchupocket,2007-02-11T02:13Z,"Hi, does anyone know where the new Open Falcon 4.3 is at?  They are talking about it over at frugalsworld but only OF4.1 seems to be on piratebay.  Anyone have it and feel like putting it up? "

It is slow as hell .. so.. if somebody beets go ahead and seed this little puppy!"
,chuchupocket,2007-02-11T05:37Z,"Thanks korick!

Also do you have Hitiles for Freefalcon?  The F4AF tiles that were on here before can be made to work in OF, but it doesn't look like they work in FF4/RV and didn't in FF3.1 either.  "
,PHBFO,2007-02-11T11:34Z,"These are mods for Falcon 4.0 Allied Force. It gives you a beautifull cockpit, thanks Korick!"
,FlankerBoy,2007-02-11T20:43Z,"It can be made to work with AF, not necessary for AF. Read the description. Could anyone make the OF 4.3 into a torrent? Its wayy too slow on that link. "
,bakermiaz,2007-02-17T03:28Z,nice1 thanks
,cray1000,2007-03-16T12:44Z,how is this made to work in AF? Link to instructions?
,DrStp,2007-08-14T18:28Z,"For a COMPLETE download, a helpful install readme, a current .dat file that WILL actually WORK (this one doesn't) with Allied Force, and friendly tech support from the sole owner and operator of this company, visit www.stopworks.us. 

We appreciate honesty and reward it with a quality product. This site has good porn, though. ;-) "
,DrStp,2007-08-20T19:18Z,"We keep purchase records and I can report now that ""Korick's"" bank record is on file and is being investigated by the FBI."
,pbransford,2007-08-23T01:28Z,"I would CONSIDER buying this if you could navigate your website without Flash.

Fuck flash.

Show me some screenshots please."
,CD X,2008-10-20T23:49Z,DrStop it's not your business to decide who will share and what. That's the point : you create some bullshit with photoshop and we share this. So stay at home and keep drawing...
,d1007,2009-12-27T05:03Z,THANKS!
