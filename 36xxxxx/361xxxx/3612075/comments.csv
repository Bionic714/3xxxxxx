,shryke,2007-02-06T13:58Z,"Not nuked ! Compared to the higher resolution release that came out at about the same time it has  some seconds around 36/37 min that the other one has not.
But yes, there is a black screen (apart from the logo) for some seconds. But itÂ´s all there."

[M],chkin,2007-02-06T17:31Z,It might be nuked but it's just ridiculous. The release has blank screen for 15 seconds in the middle of episode but you miss *nothing at all* (just fast forward it if you really need to)
,EmoStar,2007-02-09T01:01Z,"lol. wtf is ""nuked"". NEVER heard that 1 b4"

A film can be nuked for various reasons. Individual sites will nuke for breaking their rules (such as ""No Telesyncs"") but if the film has something extremely wrong with it (no soundtrack for 20mins, CD2 is incorrect film/game etc) then a global nuke will occur, and people trading it across sites will lose their credits. Nuked films can still reach other sources such as p2p/usenet, but its a good idea to check why it was nuked first in case. If a group realise there is something wrong, they can request a nuke.

NUKE REASONS :: this is a list of common reasons a film can be nuked for (generally DVDRip)

** BAD A/R ** :: bad aspect ratio, ie people appear too fat/thin
** BAD IVTC ** :: bad inverse telecine. process of converting framerates was incorrect.
** INTERLACED ** :: black lines on movement as the field order is incorrect."

episode 15 is on NBC at 09.00 PM 12 february... so i think we that need to download this probably have it on the net about 06-08 Am (GMT +01:00) the 13 february, due to the time sone difference and upload time."
,zxchaosmunkixz,2007-06-07T22:31Z,"so this comment may be a bit late, but this really shouldnt be nuked at all. it blacks out for 15 seconds for the commercial break, and it resumes regularly afterwards. *you don't miss anything at all*"
