Here is Windows Vista in 14 seperate *.Rar files.

Reason I did this, is that people might want to get *.ISO files
in smaller pieces(I don't).

This is a copy I downloaded from Torrentportal.
It said this should be Business version.
(don't know, but there is all versions)

The Date on files in DVD are November.2.2006

ISO Image name is LMRCFE_EN_DVD.ISO

So I think it's a RTM version

It works 100% (tested), when you "crack" it with timerstop.sys
(not included)

You can get that "crack" from here or elswere in Internet.


This is only for giving fully working copy for those who
know what they are doing.

I will share this at least until I see 1 copy on Azureus.

But if people dont download this I'll stop seeding.

Any complains, I wouldn't care less, download or not.
