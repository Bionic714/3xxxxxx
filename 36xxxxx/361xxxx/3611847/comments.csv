,joke66,2007-02-05T23:40Z,"Well, don't know about you, but for me it works, Vista seems to be lot (20-40%) faster than XP with all its upgrades."

,lazur-e,2007-02-07T18:22Z,"FYI - language: 

Windows Vista is multilingual, meaning you download your language pack from windows update. I downloaded vista ultimate in english about two months ago and converted it into swedish when the language packs were released. 
This will switch language in everything; menus, login screen, images with text, help, calendar - all of it. Changing language in vista is as easy as changing wallpaper!

btw all the idiots who says vista sucks doesn't know what theyre talking about - if you have a decent computer, get vista now you won't regret it :)"
,Omikron611,2007-02-07T19:25Z,"if you guys think vista is so bad, why do you then keep visiting this site so many times? he said download or not. didn't said complain as much as you can"

,VxOsx,2008-02-03T04:42Z,"Vista is good and bad,
It runs faster, it looks better
But when your on an ""administrator"" account
you still have to ""run as administrator"" which can get annoying :S"
