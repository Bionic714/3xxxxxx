,FridrikVald,2007-02-12T14:22Z,"It´s not the best but I´m working on improving it
-FrikkZ ;)"
,nanaem,2007-02-12T18:34Z,"holy crap man, that's one big up :) i'll wait til there are more seeders on this one. *thumbs up*"
,gustavlidingo,2007-02-13T10:20Z,i think i'll wait untill there are atleast 4 seeders... 
,makrium,2007-02-13T15:44Z,Could you upload just the Naruto episodes in a torrent plz?
,Eyji1,2007-02-13T16:58Z,"Always remember you can just choose what you want from your torrent program and skip the other series/moves ^^

Enjoy"
,mogto,2007-02-13T18:45Z,"Some more info would really be appreciated.  Anidb links, codec/resolution info, subbed by, etc...

Nevertheless, this is quite an amazing upload.  I'll be looking out for the next collection, I guess there's a good chance it will have something I've missed.  And a more detailed description.  :-)

I might take a chance on some of the things in this torrent too.

gustavlidingo: Good luck on getting four seeders on a monster torrent like this, you'll be waiting forever.  I know I wouldn't ever get more than two or three series.  (I could  be uploading my ass off and still be listed as ""leecher"".)"
,moonlightofdeath,2007-02-16T05:20Z,"I wouldn't mind seeding but since I am getting only 1kb/s, I don't think I will be downloading this torrent anymore :'("

,sealjo,2007-02-20T22:05Z,FridrikVald - Make sure you only seed to 4 or so persons and not everyone! that will make it much more efficient
,Nephania,2007-02-22T14:47Z,Please Seed! Snälla seeda!

,Evalon,2007-04-17T17:09Z,Omg how slow this shit is going :/
,cichli,2007-04-19T03:48Z,"I hate to be a whinebag when speaking about this beautiful monster of a torrent (I'm truly grateful for it), but what we need is more seeds! I'll be keep seeding this for a few weeks or so once the ball gets rolling, but at this pace it's not likely to happen anytime soon - at best, progress is in the range of 0.1-0.3% a day!"
,jioop,2007-04-19T13:50Z,"Ahm, guys... Are we aware of taht this torrent might be kindof dead? Thus far after slightly mroe of two months old, there are no seeders left, i have never seen anyone above 42% seeding, and we don't know just what series those people have picked. Me for instance hate all the crap of more than 26 episodes and maximum of two seasons, such as never ending Naruto... Its always the same thing happenign over and over and over again. BORING. But there are some mighty good oldschool anime here and some fresh too. NGE might be the most famous, if not Furi Kuri. Remember tehse from my early years... Anyway, to the point. If noone is willing to seed this one, you could make smaller torrents of 20-25 GB a piece, that way they are more likely to stay seeded, since tehre aren't alot of, lets be frank here, there aren't alot of people as old as me downloading with 2.3TB disc space, the most common is Olle at 14 years with maybe 60-80 GB disc...

So, to end this in a flashy way:
1 Start seed
2 or Remake the torrent into smaller ones so ""Olle"" and the rest of his kin can stay seeding

There are no options to this, I would love to have these again since my VHS tapes are all trashy and out of date by now, the sound and motion is pretty crapy, rusty so to speak.

so FrikkZ and moonlightofdeath, or anyone with more than 50% of this would even be apreciated, please keep seeding, or dl the torrent again and seed what you have. We need to work togetehr to get this ship floating again.

Thank"
,gnunard,2007-04-20T22:59Z,"I downlaoded my 42% at about 1mbyte/s now its at 1-3k/s
im thinking of stoping the seed so peeps dont get their hopes up"
,Evalon,2007-04-22T02:09Z,"I never get this done, I'm stuck at 45% and I'm only downloading Gungrave and Basilisk. It started out really well with 400 kB/s but now it changes between 0.1 kB/s and up to 1 kB/s. Can someone who has this done seed so I at least can get Basilisk done ? 

Ps ! Does some one know where I can find a Basilisk torrent that works, because I've been looking all over the intenet and nothing works :/  "
,lucrezaborgia,2007-04-23T10:41Z,"I am agreeing with one  of the above comments in that it would be much better to break this torrent up into smaller torrents and release them as ""packs"" "

Why not break them up into smaller ? Like one torrent for each Anime ? "
,Mr.Ninja,2007-05-11T18:41Z,"I have been downloading from this torrent since the day it got here and I wanted all there is, but I'm still only at 33% or so.
For those of you who want Basilisk, I recommend that you get it here.
I did, and I tried to rename the files and switch'em with the one in this torrent to help you guy's out, but it didn't work.

If you have a good line it will all be yours within 4-5 hours.
But episode 23 and 24 are not in avi but mkv.
Just so you know it.

,FridrikVald,2007-05-14T05:23Z,"We will probably just give out torrents with one series in them from now on, seems like that is the best way to keep them from dying.

Then it wouldn't be called collections ;)


Seriously, I like the idea of packs, how i usually download anime. But the best ones are with about 2 - 3 series where the whole torrent is 10GB ish~

FridrikVald 
I don't think you should give up the idea of packs. Just this one was about ten times the size that usually work out.
10GB would be optimal for a pack.

And I'm not that deep into anime these days, can't keep up with what is hip or not. To recieve a pack that syas like ""Really good anime pack"" and its sized to 10GB, I never hesitate.

Its alot easier to figure out also with the comments, if the anime is worth while or not.

Also, its alot easier to FIND all the different anime series when all you have to type in ""Anime pack 1"" ""Anime pack 2"" and so on. Or similar to that.

To me its very important that it is easy to find. I don't have alot of sources anymore where i can find info and ratings of various anime, new - let alone - old anime.

So, I hope to see more collections/packs in the future, only a tad smaller.


Thank you for your time.
Have a good one
ciao
