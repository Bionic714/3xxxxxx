This is the first of many Anime Collections we plan to share in the future. This Collection only has full series or movies, the only exception from that is Naruto. 
Everything in this Collection is in Japanese with English subtitles. We do not include in the episode names the teams that provided the fansub but they are mentioned in the beginning of each episode and we are really thankful for their hard work, sorry to not include you in the titles.
If you have any questions about the Collections or want to make a suggestion about what series we should include in the next Collection please feel free to e-mail us at animecollections@hotmail.com and we will try to reply as soon as possible.
p.s. leave an e-mail address for us to send replies.
Hope you enjoy it. This Collection was created February 12th 2007.
