,Milkywaycenter,2008-09-26T20:21Z,"Saw it when it was first released in theaters in 1971 great then, great now.  De Niro and Pacino changed movies for the better in the late 60's early 70's along with directors Scorsese, Peckinpah and Arthur Penn.  Thanks a ""bunch"" for this great download"

,nonaht,2010-07-17T21:41Z,"I grew up across the street from needle park, and knew many of its inhabitants.  What made Panic so good was its \""Documentary\"" value.  While not really a documentary, it was so close to the real needle park as not to matter.  A=10, V=10. THANKS!n"
,jorunn9,2011-03-31T22:59Z,Love this movie. Saw it many years ago. Thanks for shaering :))
,zomvid,2011-06-05T06:54Z,"sorry, not a hater but i think people should know that this movie is shrunk (screen) maybe to improve quality which is pointless cause it's one fucking GB, go to bitsnoop you'll find the same movie with only 700 mb and not shrunk! k thanks."
,WolfPunk,2011-07-08T08:25Z,"If you like this film (which I do) check out a little known Dustin Hoffman film from 1978. Not many seeders, but well worth the wait. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6204164/Straight_Time_(1978)_Dustin_Hoffman_XviD  And thanks for this classic Up, man."
