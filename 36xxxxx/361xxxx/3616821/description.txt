The year is 1972. As a Kung Fu actor in Hong Kong, you have been cast as a young farmer's son, out to avenge his father's death at the hands of an evil tyrant. As this is a 70s Kung Fu film, there is little dialogue - what is important is the action! Playing the part of Chang Pei, you must fight your way through hordes of Shao Ping's henchmen, each a master in the Martial Arts, who are guarding his palace. After fighting your way through these guards, you must take on the end of level boss - but beware, each boss has abilities far surpassing those of their minions! Can you fight your way through each of the chambers and defeat the big boss?
