,laurie0236,2007-02-17T13:51Z,"Required please
Dirks Software FS Force for FSX"
,pilatuspilot,2007-02-17T22:46Z,"Well I couldn't get this out of demo mode. Both DLL's are same size-date-time. They are the same.
Shouldn't a cracked DLL be a different date and / or size?
Any rate, I am in demo, only useable at KSEA.
Didn't like what it was doing to my MS FFB2, any way.
Maybe the fact that my registered FSUIPC is sort of 'taking care' of my controller.

By the way, don't use the installer from Dirks,  then uninstall it. It will remove your forcefeedback settings, with the uninstaller telling you to go back and reactivate.

Thanks for sharing, any how."
