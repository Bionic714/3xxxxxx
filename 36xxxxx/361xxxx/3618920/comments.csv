,raildude450,2007-02-22T21:16Z,"what the heck, i downloaded this and all it gave me was a folder called, video ts and a bunch of crap in it that doesnt do anything"
,supasoja,2007-02-27T06:39Z,"This is a DVD rip. You can either watch the VOB files with the right player/codec or burn it. If you can't figure that out, then go buy the video. These guys deserve it anyway."
,Pawnzor,2007-03-03T09:15Z,haha its nice to be a local in Alaska tryin to get a copy of this. thanks man really appreciate it. lol i feel bad for the riders worked hard on it but this gets me so stoked to ride.

,jheels7,2007-04-19T23:24Z,"what codecs do i need to watch this, i wanna see it so bad"
,argotera,2007-04-27T12:20Z,"to all the people asking how to watch the movie: 

1.create a dvd with two files in in it. one named VIDEO_TS and one named AUDIO_TS.
2. put all those files of the torrent in the VIDEO_TS file,
3. burn it.

Igf you use nero and choose NEW->DVD video, it will automatickly create these folders for you."
