,misterdig,2007-02-22T22:06Z,"Oh-mi-God! - TOTALLY OVERJOYED!!!! - Thanks dude, i've spent eve after eve installin' then scrapping Xvid to DVD converter / burners in the hope of finding an 'all in one' that gives no hassle or messin about! AT LAST, my Grail - Happy happy joy joy!! Patch woz a bit of an arse for a no brainer like me to get right but now fully tested, no watermark, no time or usage limit. DOES WHAT ITS MENT TO - Cheers Monsuier Dalileo! :D"
,bac0n,2007-02-24T22:07Z,"wow like a year ago when I tried to convert my AVI's into DVDs, i had to read all this crap and download a gazillion different tools.. if only I had known about this. 
this is an amazing program, it recognizes like any video/audio format, you literally just drag the avi's in, drag in any subtitle files, customize the dvd menu/functionality and blam convert.. you have a ready to burn dvd, which it burns for you. but it already says all that in the nfo, just trust me this does what it says and does it well. 
galileo have my babies?"

,Galileo_2005,2007-03-04T02:29Z,if any one had an alert with his antivirus comment it please. Thank you
,bac0n,2007-03-04T08:23Z,"I had avg the whole time and it never said anything when i ran the patch last week, but today when i went back to the original DL folder (to delete the original files), AVG popped up an alert about some backdoor trojan. I clicked heal and it deleted the patch file. Pretty weird."
,Galileo_2005,2007-03-04T12:26Z,"My guess is that maybe a part of the code matches the virus tha tAVG reports so when they upgraded their definitions it detected it. As i said If you think you can't trust it, find it somewere else. Also i searched the Virus Encyclopedia on the avg site and couldn't find something about it. Maybe with the next definitions the detection will not be there."

,Galileo_2005,2007-03-05T09:46Z,its probably a codec. download ac3. if you already have it install it again. also you could go to cdfreaks forum.there you can find threads about the same problems other people had
,zephxiii,2007-03-06T22:49Z,I scanned it with AVG pro updated and it didn't find anything....
,unconditional1,2007-03-28T17:03Z,Extremely new at this...downloaded... but can anyone explain in detailed terms how to install the patch?  Can't open it and apply it to the program..always wants to know what to open it with.  Any help apprecitated.

,stumblerdavid,2007-03-30T03:14Z,"Downloaded fine and installed fine with the patch, just got to try out the program now:d"
,Galileo_2005,2007-04-01T11:53Z,Close ConvertXtodvd before applying the patch!!! Patch Use: Open ConvertxToDvd_patch.exe > Patch > Yes > go to the directory where you installed the program and choose the exe > Open and you done. Also disable automatic updates in the settings. Enjoy

,Bumpfel,2007-04-05T19:37Z,hope this works better with subtitles than v2.1.10
,Bumpfel,2007-04-05T22:07Z,I can't get the subtitles to work with this version either :(
,Bumpfel,2007-04-07T15:10Z,"got the subtitles to work. a few tips for others having problems with this:
1. Don't use Nero (or whatever) to recode DVD, use the built in burn function in ConvertXtoDVD
2. You have to convert the whole DVD, to get the subtitles, because they are created in the end of convertion (they won't show on the preview)
3. If you try it in PowerDVD, you will have to press ""Choose source"" in the program and pick the VIDEO_TS folder, otherwise if you just open a vob file, the subtitles won't work
4. Don't use big font sizes. Default is 24 Tahoma, I would recommend size 20. Also don't lower the subtitles too much, then they won't show"
,Caspiandk,2007-04-08T14:37Z,there is serius malware in the patch file not the program and first downloaded i cant delete file and bullguard keeps stoping file
