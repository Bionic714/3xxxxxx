I discovered that nVidia Firewall and Network Access Manager were negatively affecting the performance of my computer, not only in BitTorrent downloads, but also in other Internet-related apps, and even in some non-internet-related apps.

This torrent contains the method I used to uninstall the Firewall and NAM.

Please realize this worked (very well!) for me - I have no idea if it will work for you.

Be sure to read the entire /Read Me/ pdf - it contains the whole story and instructions.

Sorry about stopping this torrent yesterday!
