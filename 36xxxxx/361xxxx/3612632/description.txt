In this groundbreaking book, best-selling author James C. Foster reveals for the first time the methods hackers use to attack and exploit the core components of operating systems and their applications. He provides working code and scripts in C/C++, Java, Perl, and NASL to detect and defend against the most dangerous attacks. The book covers in detail the five most important disciplines for security professionals and software developers: Coding, Sockets, Shellcode, Porting Applications, and Coding Security Tools.
