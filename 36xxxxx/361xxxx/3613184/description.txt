The latest in the \'fill that disk\' Screensaver series; OpenSuse 10.2 for Windows.

New features

    1) Packaging as a \'zip\' file, to address the common complaint that Microsoft don\'t bundle a utility to burn bootable ISOs; and also to reduce the cost and environmental impact of buying and burning DVDs.

    2) 50% Penguin in the graphical boot 

but apart from that it is the OpenSUSE 10.2 you know and love.

Un-zip the thing and double-click the \'autorun.bat\' to start it.

If you\'d like an autorunning DVD, just drag and drop everything from the zipfile into your favourite burning utility

If you\'d like a bootable ISO, there\'s one in the zipfile.

To end the screensaver, Ctrl-Alt-F and click the red X
