,raisak,2007-02-05T17:42Z,"Okey peepz since it was a good episode and i get in a good mood when i watch a good episode here are the guide how to use the very complicated rar fix..

After you have downloaded this torrent you do as follow:

1. Download the rarfix

2. Copy the rarfix (omi-ufc67b.r39) into youre UFC.67.All.Or.Nothing.PPV.DSR.XviD-OMiCRON\CD2 folder.

The rar fix is simply one rar file in 2nd video who was corrupted and needs replacement for beeing able to extract it.

You can grab winrar (program itself) here:

Good luck and enjoy this great upload!"

,mike_goteborg,2007-02-16T15:11Z,"Kan någon vänlig själ tala om hur jag seedar? Jag har en extern hårddisk på 250 GiB full med kampsport. Mycket UFC, Pride, Instruktionsfilmer, dokumentärer m.m."
,karhuhandofdoom,2007-07-17T23:58Z,"vad e det där rarfix för nåt?
fattar ingenting!!"
,jeg420,2008-05-18T04:52Z,"seed, people!  there are only 5 freakin seeders and 42 comments!  that means a shitload of you freaks just take what you want and give nothing back.  typical childish bs.  just so u no...if you keep doing that, your torrent program will limit your dl speed (if it hasn't already) and then it'll take u dayz to dl anything.  you assholes should be barred for your dl/ul ratio"
