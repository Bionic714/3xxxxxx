Ian Dust - Lonesome Traveling Madman

In Ian Dust?s bio (as short as it is) he muses being a reincarnation of Guthrie or some other lonesome traveling madman. It?s assumed that he is referring to Woody Guthrie who had a guitar labeled "This machine kills fascists." If you are wondering what kind of music Guthrie played you can listen to one of his more famous songs This Land is Your Land hosted by the University of Virginia.

Back to Ian Dust. Singer. Writer. Guitar player. It was mentioned that his bio was short. Being only 26 years old you would think he hasn't had much time to accumulate a lengthy bio but then again let's consider what he's accomplished to date.
Ian roams around the earth playing his songs. No tethers, he has unchained himself from normal life (what ever that is) in London when he was 20. Like most struggling singers on the road paying their dues Ian has sung in a few bars. No real surprise there. Singing in the subways of New York City as Ian has is definitely something that should be included in any vagabond singer's biography. Add singing songs in London, Amsterdam, Ecuador and Vancouver should move the bio up a notch or two. Writing in excess of 300 songs is an accomplishment not many 26 year olds can boast nor is making a record or two. Sounds like his biography is off to a good start!

Being the lonesome artist, roaming around the earth with his guitar and songbook, Ian plays depressive dusty blues folk songs. Life. Loneliness. Depression. Sadness and irony.
