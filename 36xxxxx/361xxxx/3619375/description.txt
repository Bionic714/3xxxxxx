Space Shooter 2000 by Gollum is just what it sounds like: an amazingly fun space shooter.  Sadly, it was long forgotten.  It was created for the DirectX 7 Software Development Kit.  But it was too good to be a demo, and somebody had to revive it.  So here it is:  SPACE SHOOTER 2000.  (Note that Microsoft no longer offers the DirectX 7 SDK for download.
