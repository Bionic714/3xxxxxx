""The Vanilla Tapes were demo tracks recorded by the English punk band The Clash- in essence, an early version of their album London Calling. Roadie Johnny Green was to deliver the tapes to the band's new producer, Guy Stevens; Green fell asleep on the train ride to the studio. Waking up at the station where he was to disembark, he panicked, and in his rush left the tapes behind. After that, the tapes were considered lost until March 2004, when Clash guitarist Mick Jones was moving boxes and came upon a copy of the tape.

The newly discovered Vanilla Tapes were released as a bonus disc when London Calling was remastered and rereleased as the Legacy Edition in September 2004.""

Imagine being Johnny Green at that moment ... *smile*"
