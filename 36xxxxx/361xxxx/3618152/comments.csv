,ang3l2006,2007-02-14T13:39Z,"Is there any trojans or spyware in it? becuse it is ""hacking"" tools"
,overclucker,2007-02-14T14:44Z,"there is no spyware.
there are inactive trojans called ""server.exe""
it's usually a good idea not to trust a server.exe that ""you"" didn't create. all the rats have the ability to create a server trojan to your specifications.
the rat client is registered as a ""trojan-gen"" by hopefully all anti virus programs."

,overclucker,2007-08-23T16:36Z,"these tools are clean, as far as i know. virus scanners pick them up because they're malware themselves. thanks for posting the virus warning, however, in the future try to include info from the vscan report(the virus name), as well as the name of the vscanner used, and any info on the definition file used.

,overclucker,2007-08-23T16:59Z,"pwdump2 uses dll injection to dump hash values from lsass, you then use a password cracker like cain&abel to crack passwords of the acquired  hash file, hopefully giving you passwords of windows user accounts.
rats are another approach to pass stealing. sinces most people just rotate one or two passwords, rats can gives you access to anothers' computer from a remote location. use the bundled keylogger to get email passes an such, which can then be tried on other email accounts, as windows logon pass, and whatever else requires a pass. thats how i use them, at least."
,Crackzter,2007-08-29T18:37Z,"Sorry Overlucker, you are right, this is clean, but I would appriciate alot if you could upload sub7.

,overclucker,2009-11-03T09:55Z,"wow. I had left this for dead ages ago. but anyways what an earlier comment refers to; that sub7 is a back door, it's true. it isn't there on purpose though, its just a programming bug. i wouldn't rely on it as a tool, but it is a piece an excellent example tool. btw, you can get any of these tools by searching google.
