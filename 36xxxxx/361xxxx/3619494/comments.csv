,Ztropp,2008-01-28T21:19Z,"Works perfect with D2CKey! thx a lot - great game!

Hi all noobs! Yes, you need to chip yr console (what d'ya think?). Use DVD-R, burn with ImgBurn, speed 4x should do the job. One final word: google!"
,MainframeF4,2008-10-17T21:52Z,"These game can be played on unchipped Wii's as well. You need a backup loader and other files to make it run though and even then the loading times can be a nightmare. Running them on chipped consoles is less of a pain in the ass.
Either way, they can be played on both just ones easier than the other."
,puttesweden94,2008-11-30T21:37Z,"har ännu bara laddat ner monopol, tv-show king och wii music, men är snart klar med denna. kör allt via backuplauncher!!"
,puttesweden94,2008-11-30T23:02Z,"huh.. can't extract it to get iso, cause 1 file is missing!! f*ck"
,HardcoreAndMore,2009-01-03T17:20Z,"i'm new to this, so, i just need to extract all the files in this .iso and just burn it on a dvd, and then with gamma (and stuff like that) to read the cd? "
,tizerni,2009-01-31T19:10Z,"i unpacked this and the iso size is too big for a dvd (4,589,824 kb) can anyone help with this? I would really appreciate it!"
,drewkrew,2009-08-31T20:39Z,"I run a soft-modded Wii and i don't agree that 'chipping' is a lot easier than the other.
You are assuming everyone using soft-modded wii's uses Backup Launcher, and has to set it up for each game.
My soft-modded wii loads a copied disc straight into the disc channel exactly the same as an original disc.
Loading times have only been an issue with 2 out of 78 games i have burnt, and were hardly an issue at all. 
One was Soul Calibur Legends as the intro sequence stuttered a bit, and the other was Super Mario Galaxy where the intro stuttered once again. Both games play fine.
(Original discs run at upto 6x speed, DVD-R run at 3x speed on the average Nintendo Wii drive. Chipped Wii's can run DVD-R at upto 5.5x speed)

I soft-modded my wii in an hour, following a step-by-step guide that came with the soft mod pack i downloaded FOR FREE!
Mod chips cost money, and invalidate any warranty, and you have to make sure you buy the exact right one to gurantee compatibility with your wii's chipset and dvd drive. Then you have to find someone you trust to fit it, or be confident to fit it yourself.

Beginners to running backups on Nintendo Wii can use Backup Launcher with a simple soft-mod and be up and running in half an hour, 
or better still do it proper and use a professional full soft-mod pack like HACK THE WII ETH pack by Ethereal which can be found on The Pirate Bay (make sure you use his latest pack)
This pack covers everything you need to do to soft-mod the proper way, and i have used it on many nintendo wii's.
Games run perfectly, no [002 Errors], no setting up each game to run properly, no worrying about bricking your wii or having to remove the updates from each game disc image, JUST INSERT DVD-R AND PLAY!!!

So don't just judge chips to be best simply because thats all you have tried... soft mods can be just as good and much much cheaper! (can't get cheaper than free)"
