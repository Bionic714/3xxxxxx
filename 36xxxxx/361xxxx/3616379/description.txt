Paullelujah was recorded in New York and San Francisco with MikeTheMusicGuy, Phofo, MF DOOM, and Prince Paul. Paullelujah, the title track, is the graduation speech Paul would have made had he won the office of student council president. Cock Mobster(MP3) is a fabulously filthy smash hit except it's too dirty for the radio. On Cleanalujah, the clean version, Cock Mobster is Schlock Mobster. But how can you clean up "I want to get in the hairy scar of Terri Garr"?

Old Paul, from the viewpoint of an old man, looks back at the smiles and fibulations. Bleeding Brain Grow says some funny stuff regarding race and religion and busts out the crazy ill rhyming rap-topic palindrome style.N.O.W. tells the story of an opportunistic left-leaning young man meeting women at a protest rally in the District of Corruptia.

Excuse You is pleasurably irony-free. Do you ever feel like you are forced to rhyme pop culture vocab because all the improper nouns have already been used? Do you ever feel like indirectness is as direct as you can get? "Life is fickle. Hellish. Anemic. Sickle cellish. Dude: You'll get chopped up like pickle relish. And when we perish, we're--what's the term, dude? Worm food. Friends memories fade. You're remembered by what you've made so I intertwine my mind and my rhymes in a braid."

Vulture Shark Sculpture Park is a field trip to a place cooler than Kykuit. Anarchist(MP3) Bookstore is split into two parts, both produced by MF DOOM. It is about the Internationalist infoshop in Chapel Hill. Burping and Farting is pure science. Talking Time Travel is a sweet ass departure from the vocal booth and was made with Etienne de Rocher on guitar. The album concludes with a true story recorded moments after it happened. Make No Mistake is available thru a value added offer from sandbox.
