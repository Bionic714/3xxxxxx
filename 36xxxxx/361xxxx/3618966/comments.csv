,carioca,2007-02-16T08:13Z,Can I use this even if I have had the demo installed before?
,Downloader++,2007-02-21T09:37Z,Fraps is the best and then use Windows movie maker...... It's much better than sony vegas or moviejack..  :D

,Ch!l!f00d,2007-02-21T20:28Z,"I had the demo installed, then I uninstalled it and installed this program. The program refuses to launch. When I execute it, a whole lot of nothing happens, I just get the waiting icon for a sec or two then it goes back to normal again. No main window comes up at all. This is probably some kind of protection against piracy. Anyone have a solution?"

,"Lies,Inc",2007-04-27T22:46Z,"I can't comfirm this right now, but I believe that you should remove the demo from the registry. Just typer regedit to your Sart>Run. It's not that hard to find from there. It's probably somewhere called something like Local_Machine and Software. It's there even if you uninstalled the program."
,Wolf 10,2007-05-27T23:05Z,I see that some of you are having the problem that after instalation it doesnt start up. I was reading another comment from a different fraps version and someone said if you had the demo installed before it the cracked one wont instal. So im guessing you have to get rid of all traices of it.
,Codee91691,2007-06-28T21:25Z,"Ok, what u do is go to Start menu and where it says My Computer, Right click on it and click search, search your entire ""My Computer"" Directory for the key word Fraps, delete anything that comes up, then reinstall fraps and it should work. (Note: Make sure no Version of fraps is installed while doing this)"
,Codee91691,2007-07-07T14:56Z,"LOL first of all i dont have the first 2 steps in my comp, they dont show up anywhere sooooo i think its diffrent for all comps or just some...this sucks lol"
,beedatopytia,2007-07-22T08:41Z,His instructions will only work if you have had demo version of fraps installed before installing the crack.
,johnburt,2007-07-23T19:29Z,"It won't work for me. I ran regedit and deleted anything that had to do with fraps, and it still won't work. What am I missing?"
,johnburt,2007-07-23T23:31Z,"I can't do this step.

4: Open up regedit, do a search for {06D25F1D-4E4A-614E-267F-6AE746520B43} (ctrl + F)

My registry search isn't finding it."
