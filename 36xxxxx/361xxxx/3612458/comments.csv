,seutef,2008-01-09T15:09Z,"well i dled it because it has good comments and i found out it also has some bugs. at some precise times in the movie it is not stable. for a minute or more each times, it repeats like 30 frames in loop. this happens 5 or 6 times. quite annoying!
i've been dling movies and else for some time now and that makes me think it is not a bug from my cpu or any other program i use to play this .iso.
have a nice day."
