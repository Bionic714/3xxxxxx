Thanks to Brad Friedman for manning the mic for Mike last Friday! Mike returns LIVE tonight!

Bush releases his budget with - for the first time - detailed war cost figures. How much more should the American taxpayer spend to send so many people to their early graves? So much money wasted on death that could b e spent to save lives (AIDS, cancer research, stem cells, nutritional programs, alternative energy research . . . . sigh)

According to the National Intelligence Estimate, which was released Friday, Iraq's growing polarization, the persistent weakness of its security forces and the escalating violence paint a bleak picture of the current state of affairs.

"Unless efforts to reverse these conditions show measurable progress during the term of this estimate, the coming 12-18 months, we assess the overall security situation will continue to deteriorate at rates comparable to the latter of 2006," the report said.

Here's more proof of the Bush/Cheney delusion that progress is being made in Iraq: another US helicopter was downed outside Baghdad. The fourth in 14 days. Elsewhere in Anbar, gunmen assassinated the Sunni chairman of the Fallujah City Council, Abbas Ali Hussein, an outspoken critic of al-Qaida, the third council leader to be killed in a year. And over 130 civilians killed in Iraq's civil war on Saturday.

What does it take to make them realize the New Way Forward is not working?
