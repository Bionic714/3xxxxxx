,bradfantin,2007-02-10T06:52Z,"actually albert, with a few clicks around, you can get parallels desktop for mac, witch enables PC OSes, such as vista enterprise. Ultimate in my case, and then enables it to be run alongside to your Macs OS at the same time.
Of course, youd have to be an idiot not to realise you need a new intel mac 32 or 64 bit."

I'm gonna try this on my MacBook Pro with 
Parallels..... let you know how it go's."
,bradfantin,2007-02-10T22:14Z,"lol i totaly agree, i was just saying that its possible. and you are right again. MACS RULE!!!!!!! :)"
,007Spekkie,2007-02-11T17:10Z,What about the crack??
,jojojoost,2007-02-11T18:04Z,"I can't get this to work in parallels, it starts up and then i get a just a white window where i can click okay. Then it reboots, and loads all the files and then it reboots again..."
,scunky,2007-02-11T20:19Z,"yeah Macs rule!

but come on!  get out of the dark ages!
all this ""them and us"" mentality really is quite
pathetic. I love my mac but sometimes I need
to use PC only software. I'm glad I can now have
both!"
,scunky,2007-02-11T23:34Z,"Installed via parallels onto my Macbook Pro.
Vista runs great! ....Thanks for the upload!!

having trouble getting airport to work tho!
vista cant seem to find it.

You have to burn the image to a DVD
to mount Vista"
,scunky,2007-02-12T11:14Z,"Airport working now!
Just needed a reboot after setting up network

hem1800 I really need the activation crack!!"
,bradfantin,2007-02-12T23:48Z,"yes i used this tottent and after awhile... llol, i finished. then i burned wiht apples disk uility. this way parallels could saee the mouynted disk, and installation caried out from there. i dont really like the way M$ installs vista tho, you dont knwo if youve crashed the installer or not at times. but other than that, i can use my mac for most things and vista for the others.! :)"
,mikejanzzon,2007-02-13T17:34Z,"youve got a crack here

no dude, use apple disk utility if you want to make a physical disk. also, if you are using an updated version of paraallels, i belive there was a button to push for advanced options when your just statring to begin the instal, and you can target the iso image from there, without a real DVD, but like i said before,  use disk utility if u want the real CD. if i were u id make the actualy CD. try that "
,oliv,2007-02-28T13:13Z,"thanks bradfantin.
It's great!"
,gecko21,2007-04-21T20:47Z,"For some reason when I try to boot it up, whether I am targeting the ISO or from a DVD I mounted the image to, when I press the ""play"" button in parallels to get it to start my computer crashes everytime. Any suggestions?"
