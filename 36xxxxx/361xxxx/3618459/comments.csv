I wonder if I will ever find the original 12 inch again my friend had. It was 3 songs, original lineup, before the DC Lightning Cassette. It has 3 songs. One is Coptic Times and it is an alternate version. I swear ( FYI ) its worth looking for. It has so much emotion. Nothing will ever compare to it. But this version will be okay. Once again, thanks."
