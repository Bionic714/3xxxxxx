If you're a John Waters fan, you're aware of his subversive sense of humor, and that carries over to this album. A bizarre selection of unique love and anti-love songs, Waters has a knowledge of obscure and unusual music, and this fits the bill. This is probably the first album in history to feature performances by both Dean Martin and Edith Massey, as well as the punk classic "Jet Boy Jet Girl".
Seed and enjoy!
