,scrapetorrent,2007-04-08T00:23Z,"When trying to install with parallels and selecting Windows XP in the menu - it just says file not found :( -- If choosing Windows 98, it just hangs.

Any ideas?"
,scrapetorrent,2007-04-08T00:30Z,"Oh, what I've done is ctrl+c or something out of the menu, then ran dir to see all the files available and say XP.BIN there, so tried run XP.BIN and it's in the middle of the installation already - hope this helps anyone trying to install this using parallels desktop."
,scrapetorrent,2007-04-08T00:34Z,"Small correction, you press ""q"" to get out of the easy boot thingy, then you execute ""run XP.BIN"" and voila."

,stlmoto,2008-04-15T06:57Z,"umm installs and says file is corupt, could that be due to that you messed something up installing the 2 viruses in there ? So just so that everyone know it does install fine after you get past the ONE Error but if you scan the .iso before you burn it, it will show the 2 viruses i am talking about, i will be posting a 100% clean version shortly, because i am getting real tired of getting  viruses from these torrents"
,ltla9000,2008-05-07T15:48Z,This works ok but has 2 flaws on installation and some programs error out on install. Please find the corrupt files and repair and upload again as this will rock when right.
