,thomsol,2007-02-08T21:26Z,"LOL! I opened the .torrent in BitLord, and the extension is .rar.torrent... Do not download, people. If you wanna check out new games that are up for release, or allready released, this is a good site:

Cya!"
,redhammer,2007-02-08T21:28Z,"Yep! Either that or this person clearly thinks we are all dependant on torrent sites for getting news from the gaming world :P
533 bytes :P even if they were screenshots they would be very very very small and ugly quality :P"
,1887,2007-02-08T22:26Z,"The rar file contains 3 diffrent screenshots, with a nice quality. "
,b17tony,2007-02-09T06:11Z,"FUCK YOU 1887 fuckin uploading fake shit that you think people will download. This isn't something new you're trying. People do it everyday and we know what looks real and what obviously isn't. Three great quality screens under a kb? extremely unlikely. I can tell you from past experiences and from reading other fellow poster's experiences that these things are not what they seem. So do us all a favor, if you are going to upload something, upload something that is useful and what people want. You use this site to get programs and stuff that you want, and in return you try to spam the people that you are recieving from? Shame on you."
