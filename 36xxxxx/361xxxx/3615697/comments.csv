ILL DO MY BEST TO PLAY ALONG ! 




Lineage: Aud master->DAT->cassette->CDR->EAC->SoundForge (speed correction, re-tracking)->FLAC Frontend 


The first show of the famous 1981 Halloween run at the Palladium. This recording, transferred from my tapes by JS, is 1st gen if you only count analog generations, and sounds quite nice. The sampling process also revealed that very small portions (0,7/1,9 secs) are missing here after the tape flips in the Drowning Witch and Yo Mama solos compared to Drew?s version, but I chose not to patch them in as there?s a little difference in sound. Unfortunately, we weren?t able to find any fills for the tape flips. 




this is what you call 1st . gen you cant be serious 


looks like 3rd gen to me dat is not lossless it uses tape! 





first of all this was recorded by steve h. 


ZAPPA FRANK NEW YORK NY 10/29/81 130 VG+ M tape # 93/47/221 


i have the master he never transferred it to dat 



but i did a long time a go ! 



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 



BTW, as I have mentioned in other threads, it appears that this was NOT recorded by Grape, although it was traded by him to Hot Rats. 




AS I POINTED OUT OVER A MONTH AGO ! 

WHEN WILL PEOPLE STOP BUYING YOUR LIES ! 







IF YOU TRUST THE ZAPPAQUEERS YOUR FUCKED !

I have never seen people go crazy for a torrent on Dime like this one. Seriously at this point there are 2500 peers. That's more peers than there are for the latest episode of ""Lost"". The most downloaded torrent on Dime _ever_ has only been grabbed 5,500 times, and that's in THREE YEARS.


well this here torrent has out done that !

13001 downloads !

and that is in 6 months !


so if you still believe the conspiracy against me by

jon naurin, walk, deiter ,drew fignar, rolf maurer and the rest of the zappaqueers 

then your either deaf or just fucking dumb !



TIME TO COME CLEAN YOU FOLKS ARE RUINING THE ZAPPA COMMUNITY !

MAYBE WHEN ONE OF YOUR TORRENTS IS DOWNLOADED 15000 TIMES 

SOMEONE WILL TAKE YOU SERIOUS

BUT AS FOR NOW THE FOLKS THAT TAPE THESE SHOWS THINK YOU ARE SCUM !

,MASTER_NINJA,2007-03-21T09:21Z,"Dear Andrew, 
Why do you keep flooding this forum with this republican shit, in fact very right wing republican shit ? We're all here for the music and the FZ community and nobody, really nobody, will change his/her mind by reading your crap. And yes, we all know your points of view by now. So no need to go on and on and on........  
Unless of course you are fucking CIA and monitoring peoples reactions and behaviour. Putting them on a black list, destination secret jails in Poland  

regards 
LudzNL 

p.s. There's only one thing you really need to explain to me. How come you love Frank, who really detested everything you stand for? I don't get it at all
