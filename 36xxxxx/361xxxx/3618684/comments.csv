,juneau4321,2007-02-15T11:10Z,It's a rar fix lol.
,speakeasy,2007-02-15T19:19Z,"igotyGOTH - you are a fucking ingrate.  Not only does kolll upload probably the *best* stuff on TPB, but in this case, he's taken the trouble to post a fix to a broken scene release.
What have you posted recently?"
,jenkinsgto,2007-02-15T23:44Z,"First of all, thanks for the fix, but can you tell me how to apply this fix in detail please.

Thanks so much!"
,speakeasy,2007-02-16T00:41Z,"igotGOTH: remember - I wasn't criticising the original uploader.
And yes, I have also upload to other sites.
I hope that when *you* upload, you get nice comments; just remember to leave nice comments for others.
If you are going to criticise, at least say 'Thanks' first."
,speakeasy,2007-02-16T00:42Z,"Oh, and at least I have uploaded more than you to this site:

,Raziel36,2007-02-16T21:25Z,"jenkinsgto:
Simply place these two .rar files in your original movie folder, and allow them to replace the original files.  Once done, extract the files and burn."
