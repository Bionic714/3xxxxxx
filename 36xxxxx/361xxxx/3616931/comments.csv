,CollTek,2007-03-09T06:01Z,"This sounds good, but it would be nice if you could give some more info on how the compatible rate are in general. I mean, how many Windows programs really run ""SMOOTH""? Thx for the upload anyways, but if there is anyone who have tried it, please post a comment and share with others on how it works. Well i downloading it now, but still it would be nice having some info before downloading. Thx everybody.  :P"

,~,2007-03-18T02:34Z,"I dunno about this release & posting here, but I had v5.0.3 working under Suse 10.0 or 10.1 a while back, with a couple Windows apps installed and working OK.

What I recall of it, it was a bit tricky, but I still had some Windows apps running under it.

I've got some new work-related software to see if I can get it to run OK under it, saw the newer CrossOver version, and guessed it'd be a good way to go.

Thanks for the upload!"
