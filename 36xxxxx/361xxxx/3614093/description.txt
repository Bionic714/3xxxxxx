- Notes
*Release came out the next day because the show was capped
multiple times due to the surprise 23.976fps by disc ch and 
the file was encoded multiple times differently to get the 
best result with the ivtc and no visible interlacing lines.
after a couple encodes it is done right. and also i was 
waiting to scene if it would be capped by the scene and spread
around. future episodes will come out sooner.
*I know discovery ch is mostly 29.97fps shows but this
show was actually aired at 23.976. 
*Enjoy the show!
