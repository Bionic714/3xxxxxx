theres seems to be a lot of peers 90 right now but NO seeds that i can see, i assume theres some as its trickling in VERY slowly ATM so i hope it will ecentually finish.

 but if you have already downloaded it can you make sure you feedin gto at least two other peers at as fast as you can for a few hours now to get these peers finished and also seeding. thanks"

It's indeed a tad slow atm, dunno why, isp has prolly fucked smt up. The speed will increase a lot once the initial upload is done."
