Plot Summary for 
Jason X (2001) 


In the future, Earth is no longer inhabitable. A school field trip leads the class and a few marine grunts to the remains of Camp Crystal Lake where they discover two croygenically frozen bodies, one of a beautiful young woman, and the other, a vaguely familiar looking man in a hockey mask and carrying a machete in his right hand. The group decides to bring the bodies back for testing and re-animation. But what was the first mistake, bringing the two bodies back with them or thawing them out so that the unstoppable Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) can return again to wreak havok and murder everyone in his sight? But what if Jason was upgraded, making him more dangerous than he ever was before?
