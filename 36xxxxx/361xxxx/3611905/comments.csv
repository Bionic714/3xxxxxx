,raiden395,2007-08-26T08:37Z,"wow, guy above me, you're a fucking loser, be happy you're getting it for free you cocksucking assclown.  Shut the fuck up and if you actually like the band that much, buy the music yourself...

fucking ungrateful fucks."
,OMary,2007-09-24T15:51Z,raiden ur so right!
,thesnowballeffect,2007-10-28T01:21Z,"raiden395, if you can even remember taking back sunday when Jesse Lacey from Brand New played Bass and sung backing vox i would be shocked :0. Why call something a discography when it really is not, FFS, and as for buying the music, lol, if you can find and post a link where i can buy the demo EP i would be a happy guy, The EP and Tell All your Friends are the only 2 real TBS CD's the other are pointless crap IMO :)"
,mdeadsy,2007-11-22T18:15Z,either way who gives that much of a fuck.

New TBS sucksss"
,fuckyoukenny,2008-08-24T06:21Z,no discography but some good TBS none the less thanks 
,Kasiox,2008-11-02T15:50Z,Thanks for the music : ) great download speed !
,neondog,2008-11-16T18:44Z,"Jesus fucking christ you guys.  The top guy there was just mentioning that for someone hoping to get everything TBS did in one go, that this was a lot of what they did but not everything.  

He/she isn't saying that this torrent sucks because of it or anything.  Just saying that there's more to go find if you want an uber-complete collection.  

So calm the hell down.

also, Slash19x, pretty nifty torrent.  If I end up getting my hands on the rest of TBS's stuff, I'll add it and seed."
,kylemac14,2009-05-16T02:57Z,"Hey guys, here's a good link for the demo. http://extratorrent.com/torrent_download/1890844/Taking+Back+Sunday-Sink+Into+Me-Promo+CDS-2009-XXL.html 
By the way, it is great quality, so enjoy :D"
,stratmanlv,2009-12-15T00:09Z,Wow snowball your retarded...Jesse Lacey never played for TBS It was John Nolan from Straylight Run and he was the guitarist before fred not the bassist. You really showed raiden
,Zephyr442,2009-12-21T04:45Z,"Wow, Strat.

It'd be nice if you would have done the tiniest amount of research before posting here and calling someone 'retarted'.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taking_back_sunday

Jesse Lacey DID play bass for TBS. Please get your facts straight before you call someone out.

Wowwww, you really showed Snowball, didn't you? :)

And learn the difference between 'your' and 'you're'.

Great torrent Slash! Thanks for it!"
