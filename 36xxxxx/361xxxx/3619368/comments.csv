,samnav,2007-02-18T04:33Z,"man its really wierd 
the tracker size shows 4.85 GiB
and the no. of files = 1
now the file ""Windows Vista RTM Build 6000 and Crack by BANDIT.zip"" size is just 2 GiB
can anyone explain this"
,ramboliini,2007-02-18T12:57Z,Seed plz.
,lineker1962,2007-02-18T14:13Z,"I've just looked inside the zip file and there is a text file explaining the size. Aswell as rtm build 6000 it also contains vista rc1 build 5600, as this has to be installed before the 6000 build in order for the activation to work correctly. It also states that activation by this method will take ""at least 5 hours"" oh, and you need a flash drive or a floppy!"

No, I haven't read the instructions but if this is an upgrade only option... wow, that sucks."
