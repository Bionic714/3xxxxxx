Synopsis:

Dead Man Walking is the compelling true story based on the experience of Sister Helen Prejean, a Catholic nun caught in a moral crisis; her role as a spiritual advisor to a convicted murderer on death row leads her to become an outspoken advocate against the death penalty, but her confrontation with the grieving families of his victims throws her into a deeper crisis of faith than she could ever have imagined.
