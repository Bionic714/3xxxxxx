This is a DVD ISO image of a Yoga DVD compilation I made to save myself time in the morning.  I got rid of intros, credits, FBI warnings, etc.  There's a simply menu to choose 1 of 6 workouts and off you go.  It's about 120 minutes of Yoga-bliss total.

Here's what I included:

1: Crunch Yoga: Fat Burning (Sara Ivanhoe) 
http://www.amazon.com/Crunch-Perfect-Yoga-Workout-Fat-Burning/dp/B00005NQGR

2: Crunch Yoga: Joy of (Sara Ivanhoe) 
http://www.amazon.com/Crunch-Perfect-Yoga-Workout-Fat-Burning/dp/B00005NQGR

3-6: Yoga Zone: 20 minute episodes (the ones that are most seeded such as: Intro to Power Yoga and 40 Minute workout)

Enjoy and please seed it for a while.  My dedicated torrent computer will lock up and my ISP is poor.

Cheers,
Brian
