Nåja Jag får väl ladda hem o kolla... 

Tack förresten rh128592."
,speakeasy,2007-02-11T16:53Z,Thank you
,rh128592,2007-02-12T00:34Z,"Stick with this for a while.  I can only allocate 20kb upstream which means it's going to take a few days (a week?) to get the entire thing out there.

After that, keep seeding it please.  I think you'll find it's worth it.

Cheers,
Brian"

I tried to translate.  Here's what it said:

""Mine standardfråga : Have I this? Nåja Self sheep welfare fraught home un collapse. Cheers incidentally rh128592.""

I guess free translations still need some work."
,rh128592,2007-02-13T04:48Z,"I'm very surprised how many people are interested in this torrent.  It's coming, albeit very very slowly but surely.  Hang in there, seed it when it's done."
,davematband41,2007-02-21T16:16Z,"Yoga, Yoga! mmm. mmm. good."
,patrickmaher,2007-02-23T11:01Z,Are you using a seeder setting on this torrent so you don't send the same data to more than one person?
,scragz,2007-02-26T23:26Z,So close >
,121Y,2007-03-22T20:36Z,"zero seed, zero peer...... looks dead to me.... someone?"
,rh128592,2007-04-06T13:53Z,"I stopped seeding.  Actually, my server died and I just haven't made the effort to get the new one going.

Looks like others are seeding.  Thanks!"
,rh128592,2007-06-04T20:28Z,I put together a second version with new videos since this one is somewhat popular.  Once I get my ISP issues sorted out I'll seed it.
,rh128592,2007-07-04T16:26Z,"Here's the new one:

,saabas,2007-08-01T13:13Z,"Any hope for DVD rip of this? Also i have 2 Dummies routines with Sara which are great for beginners, maybe they would fit with the Sara theme."
,rh128592,2007-08-01T22:14Z,"I borrow these DVDs, rip them, butcher them, and then return them.

Which one, in particular, do you want a rip of?  I'll see if I can manage it.

Then again, it would be the same thing, maybe higher quality, but with all the other garbage.

Sarah's hot."
,MoonliteSymphony,2008-02-24T22:40Z,So I can't get this thing to work.   Computer says it's either not formated right or an invalid file type or something.  And I'm trying to open with power ISO and mount as usual.
,df3434,2008-05-31T16:10Z,THANKYOU x
,yopo,2008-09-17T20:43Z,"I love it, good work! And the second DVD too.

I've been looking for these yoga zone videos for a while, so special thanks for bringing those back to me.

Now, going back to mountain pose..."
,rh128592,2009-02-18T12:45Z,"2 years on this torrent.  And to think I was just messing around...

I don't know why your ISO didn't work.  Maybe some corruption?  IsoBURNER is a good PC app.  Toast or DiskUtility will burn and verify (verify is th e key)"
,emmaa_uk,2009-04-23T16:22Z,"great dvd and without those dreaded subs- cant believe what that instructor sara has done to her hair, she looks like a complete dogs head now!
thanks brian"
,fiesty99,2009-12-14T14:33Z,Could we get the titles for the yoga zone videos? Thanks.
