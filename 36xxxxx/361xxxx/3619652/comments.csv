,Harry_Jihad,2007-02-23T20:46Z,"could the uploader please give us the last 0.01%

And thanks for the torrent"
,smarty9797,2007-02-23T22:12Z,"I have a stupid question: File 1 is not an iso, not a zip, no rar.
Anybody got any idea what format it is?
2 and 3 are ok, I was able to mount them with daemon tools and could burn them.
But file 1? My hex editor shows no hint..."
,jaraeez,2007-02-27T19:25Z,"Thanks for the torrent - Oh & it would be nice for the other 00.1%

@smarty9797 -- hey so your one of the two who have d/led the complete torrent? if so seeding would be nice, &  file 1 is an iso (already burnt both 1 & 2 to DVD'rs --)

00.1% left fuking typical ;)"

,kmarx,2007-03-08T13:10Z,"Don't mind the 0.01%, just rename the .bc to .iso and burn the disk. It works alright."
