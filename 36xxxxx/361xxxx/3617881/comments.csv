,bburge,2009-01-17T10:46Z,"only like 6 of these actually work.
they seem to all be the same format, but the rest just have audio.
Can anyone help? I was downloading this for like a week and really excited about it...now im just choked."
,frozenray,2009-02-11T07:44Z,"I appreciate the effort, but these resolutions are awful. 

Looks like Im gonna have to buy the DVD collection."
,YpsiFrog,2009-05-05T23:45Z,any idea what went wrong -only have audio and its choppy?
,ZetaRed,2009-05-28T11:09Z,I actually took the time to register just to tell you thank you. I have been looking for this show for ever. I doesn't get enough air time. Now i can satisfy my cravings. Thanks sooo much!
,Slag12345,2009-07-31T18:28Z,"bburge, the video on some of them doesnt work because your most likely missing some codecs, i know i couldnt watch 4-5 of the episodes with vid until i updated my divx codecs, so you may want to give that a try"
,neblin7,2009-11-14T05:09Z,"I have the entire extra cd ripped that came with season 4.  I'll post it by 11/16/09.  Also, does everyone know that Brendon Small is also responsible for Metalocalypse?"
,fucci,2009-12-03T05:24Z,Just glancing at the frame widths and heights of these rips a lot of these appear to be ripped by Geophage from myspleen.net. I have them from years ago and the quality's fantastic. You can get the entire series box set for around $90 too :)
,kaptain_kompost,2010-06-26T02:14Z,"Just wondering if anyone knows anyone who would upload minoriteam.  Adultswim.com isn't available to people outside the US, so there's nowhere to get it."
,JynxfromFUS,2010-10-22T01:16Z,"Thanks for your torrents they're great =)
(also thanks very much for the Libertarian Socialist Revolution, it's always nice to learn some new info ^.^ (you might also like Naomi Klein, she has some interesting books with positive reviews from Noam Chomsky))

,mikep480,2010-12-12T05:31Z,"Thank you SO much for this torrent, it's very good quality for such a relatively obscure TV show that I didn't think anyone else would be hosting or seeding. Turns out there's quite a bit of support for it and I shall keep seeding it when I am able. Thanks you thank you thank you!!"
,Occular,2011-01-09T17:48Z,"is this rip from before or after they removed ""squigglevision""?  Will seed regardless.  Also, I like pizza Brendan."
,i4gotmy_sn,2011-05-20T02:10Z,"B/c I appreciate this upload more than any other upload that I've downloaded from TPB, I will forever seed the s*** outta this! Everyone should be able to enjoy this show. This upload is over four years old, that's amazing! Whenever I have ÎźTorrent open, I'll be sure to seed with high bandwidth allocation.

Thank you SO much, BloodLogic!
