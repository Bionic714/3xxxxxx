Just saw ""Zeitgeist"" (2007). There were some fine clips from this movie. ;)"
,magnus3994,2007-10-13T21:40Z,"yea me 2, just saw zeitgeist"
,Luxifer,2007-11-09T12:24Z,"Of course, Zeitgeist was where I first heard of this movie. The scenes taken from Network are just great samples, so I had to see if the rest of the movie was just as important. I must say, it is. Great movie, worth watching and spreading to all your friends and family.

I will continue to seed this for some time."
,ChrisSkills,2008-01-14T01:58Z,"Like ya'll stated before me, Zeitgeist got me looking for this movie (which by the way was one of the more eyeopening documentaries I've seen). Powerful stuff indeed. 
The second part had little new substance, but the first and the third... you just got blown away by the mere thought of it all."
,dragon_slayer,2008-01-22T23:11Z,"Found this trough ""Zeitgeist"" movie. This movie is fresh if you know how the world works. Might be pointless if you don't.  Its about a news anchorman that gets tierd of all bullshit and starts speaking his mind on live tv."
,followingsun,2008-01-23T22:13Z,me too! looking for network after see zeitgeist
,NobleBear,2008-02-01T20:29Z,"Ha! That's hilarious, I also found this film thru Zeitgeist. Z is having quite an impact, eh?"
,rinufe,2008-02-03T20:55Z,What is the resolution of that video?

,summd15,2008-03-06T05:24Z,"Yea, I found this through Zeitgeist as well."
,eddielagato,2008-03-16T20:26Z,"Zeitgeist here as well, hmmm... do I sense a pattern?"
,dealornodeal,2008-03-27T17:08Z,Go and see the music video with this movie on youtube made by Hypnoticcus .It is combination of this movie and the simpsons.
,Donate,2008-03-28T21:58Z,"Did _not_ found through zeitgeist. Zeitgeist seems, from what I read various places on the internet, like a retarded movie. Entertaining, but retarded. Hmm, maybe I should watch it..."
,tolzkutz,2008-04-01T00:51Z,yet another I-have-seen-it-on-Zeitgeist here :)
,eggontoastman,2008-04-15T00:49Z,"Yep Zeitgeist got me here too!
If you haven't seen Zeitgeist yet... what you waiting for?"
,macgabriel87,2008-05-16T00:14Z,"After watching Zeitgeist, the scenes from this movie kept coming back to me. Thankfully the movie placed the source right next to the scene so I can easily find it!

iTunes does not have this movie unfortunately, so I'm here hoping people are still seeding! :)"
,eikon805,2008-05-28T10:51Z,"thanks for the UL, i just caught the end on TV and had to watch the whole thing again.
this is one of those rare prophetic films, more relevant today than when it was made, over 30 years ago.
I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANT MORE.
(now i'v gotta check out this 'Zeitgeist' thing)"
,eikon805,2008-05-28T11:05Z,"nevermind checking out 'Zeitgeist' turns out, it's just more ahtheist garbage."
,mordikia,2008-06-04T06:30Z,"in b4 Zietgiest, heard about this from my uncle first, watched zietgiest, piled on more evidence on why i should watch this film."
,Gz4Galvanize,2008-06-08T16:24Z,Zeitgeist brought me here too... kind of crazy to find so many other people on the same page
,sweaterpuppies1,2008-06-10T06:38Z,"Indeed I saw the clips from Zeitgeist, however that movie was essentially conspiracy drivel filled with anti-corporate sentiments.

I'm hoping this movie will be much better."
,Vitalise,2008-07-23T21:30Z,"Holy shit, I saw Zeitgeist a couple of days ago, and searched for this because the ""WE'RE IN A LOTTA TROUBLE!"" speech is still stuck in my head, fucking epic!

Can't wait for this to finish downloading! :D"
,ejputz,2008-07-26T00:44Z,"Ahem... About Zeitgeist...

,raheesen,2008-08-19T03:57Z,great movie...excellent quality...great movie
,davevan,2008-08-31T09:57Z,"zeitgeist brought me to this movie too.
and there are traces of the mad as hell scene in ren and stimpy also. probably the best cartoon ever created. 
"
,davevan,2008-08-31T10:24Z,"1:25:20 through 1:25:30. in zeitgeist

its not how much money is in circulation that gives money its value, its the fucking people. its just a piece of paper, get over it. 

money is like sex or drugs. one taste and your hooked. dont give in."
,stormseeker77,2008-09-13T05:26Z,"My history teacher showed us this film like 10 years ago. Good teacher, awesome film."
,deepthoughtdevil,2008-09-17T00:56Z,"People, I suggest you DO NOT DOWNLOAD this torrent, coz the video quality is for s**t. It was recorded from TV, I can clearly see TCM on the bottom right corner of the screen and the audio has some kind of beep to it, which plays throughout the movie. I'm writing this after I just finished watching this very movie, from this very torrent, so spare yourself. Find another torrent or buy the DVD. Hope I helped. Thanks."
,thuerrsch,2008-12-27T08:43Z,"I must second deepthoughtdevil, the video and audio quality is indeed lousy."
,deepthoughtdevil,2009-02-13T10:56Z,"Here's a better torrent
