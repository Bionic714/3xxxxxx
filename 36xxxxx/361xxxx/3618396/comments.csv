,rednaxela74,2007-08-11T21:02Z,"It must be a fake! The Key-gen says ""are you kidding me?!"" on every word or sentence i can think of! And those people her who wrote thanx and works 100%... Why dont they help us in need?????"
,Marinko420733,2008-02-28T15:52Z,"rednaxela74 and others, who may it:
It is not fake, just downloaded it, and installed properly in few minutes. It is so tricky, but to avoid kaymaker saying ""are you kiding me?"", you need the follow few simple steps:

Install under XP:
1. Login in XP as admin
2. Run PTPXL310.exe (the upper versions do not allow phone activation, so you MUST start with this one)
3. When install of 3.10 finished, it will ask for reboot your machine. Do so.
4. After restart, it will ask you for activation, start it, but take care, choose PHONE activation.
Click next, it will give you ""request code"" which is 6x4 numeric caracter.
5. Start Keygen, and in the proper place (there is only one where you can write :-)) you shold TYPE the 6x4 numeric caracter of ""request code"", but take care, do NOT use Copy/Past, since you shouldn't make spaces between the 6 groups. (type it without spaces, the 24 caracter in one lot - If you make spaeces between, or copy past, THEN you get this ""are you kiding me?"" from Keygen).
6. Press the ""generate"" button on Keygen, it will give you 17x4 numeric caracter, this you may copy/past to PTP install to the proper place, where it ask for it. 
7. You finished with install (i'm not sure, maybe it needed restart at the end again? Nevermind :-)

Than, if you like, you may upgrade to 3.11 or 3.12 also included in torrent, to do so, simply exit from PlexTools, Run the exe of version you need, it will not ask for reregistration, or whatsoever (just reboot :-))))

Note: the latest update (version 3.12) of PTP XL you can d/l from www.plextools.com, and after siply install it (it will upgrade with no question, I just did it).

I hope, now it is fully clear, how to use, to install it :-))) It is ""sz?ken?-kompatibilis"" I hope :-)

Thx for upload to XZoli (kĂśszike)"
,fendermental,2008-12-20T09:06Z,"Thanks XZoli. I followed Marinko420733 instructions for XP, but Keygen only worked WITH spaces between numbers, so copy and paste worked for me. Then go to http://www.plextools.com/download/download.asp to download v3.13."
