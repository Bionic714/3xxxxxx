,mikelmoore100,2007-12-30T14:56Z,"Hi,

Please can someone help? I have around 75% of this torrent and I dont seem to be able to download the rest.
I am new to this torrent stuff and it might have seemed that I was a leecher, but having read the tutorials and helps, I now give back.
I will seed this for along time ie. weeks.
I am currently doing degree level advanced psychology and this would be of value to me.

Kind regards

Michael"

,p.prosper,2009-12-27T05:21Z,"Apparently it's going to take 5 days before my download will finish courtesy of 8kib download speeds (max). it'll be next year before i get this :/

Can some of you guys up the sharing speeds as this will help to share the knowledge a lttle quicker (i have my upload limit set to 300kib)

Thanks"
