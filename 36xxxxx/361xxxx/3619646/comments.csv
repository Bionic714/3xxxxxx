,k2kkonen,2007-02-22T00:39Z,"Great machine! Have You managed bounce patterns or sequences to aiff, wav or whatever? i tryed it from File ""Write to a file..."". it says ""start writing a file"", then it runs the seq but there's no aiff or anything. also i tryed to play it with Logic. i could sync it but couldn't get the sound through logic. i'm probably just stoopid..."

,lumo123,2007-03-06T19:59Z,help how do you delete/remove the RegistrationPanel.nib help
,k2kkonen,2007-03-08T10:59Z,has anybody managed to bounce anything? is this still demo version although you can take registration panel off? pretty useless if you can only use it as a standalone machine and connect it with nothing. 
,tyand78,2007-10-11T01:02Z,"Damn, how do I remove the RegistrationPanel.nlb thingy?

When I try to put it in the bin, I get a message that ""you are not authorized"" bla bla.

Please help!"
,tellag,2008-02-15T02:40Z,"Removing the ""RegistrationPanel.nib"" returns a ""file is broken"" message. I have tried removing each of the files inside the folder but that doesn't work. Any suggestions?"
