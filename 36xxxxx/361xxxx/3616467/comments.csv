,Psycho0124,2007-02-12T07:41Z,Quick release! Excellent quality on previous episodes. Im betting no less for this one. Much thanks man!
,ShaneKorte,2007-02-12T07:44Z,"Thanks for the release, I work on sunday nights and cant catch it on HBO. 

Uhm, in the future, please dont use the .rar format. Use 7zip or zip or just post the .avi because 9 out of 10 times rars are passworded or they are corrupt or they contain fake content. 

I really just hate the format, please dont use it in the future. 

Thanks."

Any ideas how to view this?"

,barbararar,2007-02-13T14:58Z,"i get an error on file 9. for some reason its smaller than the others...
Damn annoying"
,Lord_Kamiizumi,2007-02-19T08:24Z,"I ran into some problems with another release of this archive that had a corrupt no9.  I downloaded the torrent for the complete no9 but in my haste I saved it in the same directory as the others and it being so small it downloaded first and then got saved over by the torrent with all the parts.  And now, no one is seeding the complete no9 for the other release.  This release, I'm hoping, doesn't have this problem."
