,bellicose,2007-02-14T00:39Z,"Once Ive downloaded; how do I get the files to play?  XOR files   Each one ends in .r00 .r01 etc

Is there a way to merge these files to a file that will play on windows media player?

thank you in advance."
,llamasamurai,2007-02-14T03:17Z,"Yeah. You need a program that can extract .RAR files (WinRAR, or StuffIt Expander for Mac). Then all you have to do is extract the first one, and all the rest will be extracted. When it's done, you'll have one file.

The file probably won't play in WMP, though. You need something that can decode DivX."
,madhouserevival,2007-02-14T08:46Z,3 of the rar files are corrupt. can't repair it.
,madhouserevival,2007-02-14T08:49Z,"Actually, make that 4. Numbers 7, 11, 13 and 15. Super fast download, though. Maybe someone can up load the fixed files."
