,sosofake,2007-03-04T14:24Z,"Good quality, but the non-spanish subtitles have been ripped out."
,Uncle_Fucker,2007-09-21T16:48Z,"Thank you very much, pacarre!
It's been a long time since I last saw this movie. Time to see it again and re-educate my perspective on the state of movie-making since 1927. Back then, movie-making was a genuine craft. Today it's mostly a job and a business. The motive is money -- cranking out crap with happy endings based on test audiences. Bah!

Again -- thanks!"
,phreakker,2008-01-20T12:40Z,"So, guys.. is there an english audio track on the DVD? I'd really like to know this before I finish downloading.. Thanks"
,bammeu,2008-02-10T22:24Z,hmm its a silent film... so i guess that there is no english audio-track ..
,Vadim Makarov,2008-04-05T00:39Z,Spanish subtitles only. Rest of the languages stripped off. Phew.

,Maharaja-Krishna,2010-05-26T21:25Z,"For those (like me) who did not know... This is a (very old) silent film. Thus only classical music as background audio track (2 tracks AC3: 2 and 5.1 channels).

Additionally there are 2 'director's comment' audio tracks. One in German and the other one in English.

The original text is in German.

Unfortunately as previously stated the original subtitles have been (stupidly...) ripped out with only the spanish subs left hence NO English, NO French, NO Italian except for the start menu which is off no importance."
