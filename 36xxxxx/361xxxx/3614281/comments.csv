,elyk1212,2007-02-09T17:31Z,"Hey, it got good reviews 8.7/10 for that link listed... I've never had a game that received good reviews that wasn't worth trying."

,c0ng0bong0,2008-03-22T00:53Z,"Could some of you guys that finished downloading come back and seed please? I saw 3 people finish then leave after they were done. Now I don't see any seeders.

P.S. If anyone cares, this game is awesome. I bought the PS2 limited edition box just for the extras even though I only have an XBOX (no xbox versions were in the store.)"
