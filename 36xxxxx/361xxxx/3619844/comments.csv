,Blutstolz,2008-04-04T22:21Z,Are you sure? Pretty sure it's the Berliner Philharmoniker with Simon Rattle.
,Blutstolz,2008-04-05T06:31Z,"Correction: Symphony No. 10 in this torrent is the BPO with Rattle; the rest are assorted (CSO/Solti, etc.)"

My father enjoys Mahler very much, and has him as a high favorite."
