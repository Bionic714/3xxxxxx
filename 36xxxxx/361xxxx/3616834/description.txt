You have been trapped in another dimension. In order to rescue yourself from the nightmare you have to collect multiple items and pass over thirty rooms until the happy ending.

You control your hero using arrows and the stylus for jumping. You must avoid dangerous creatures that live in the rooms. When you collect all the items the door will open. You must exit the room before the time passes. You shall get one point for every item collected. Every 100 points gives you an extra life. Falling from the large height makes you hurt a lot.
