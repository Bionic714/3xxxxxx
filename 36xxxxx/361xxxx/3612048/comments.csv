,danis22,2007-04-19T15:09Z,"Hi,

I have dowloaded and copied this map on my tomtom one v2, but it does not see the map and so, does not ask for the activation code. I alredy have France and Germany on my tomtom and for both the installation was obvious. Could someone tell me what is wrong and what should I do?

thanks"
