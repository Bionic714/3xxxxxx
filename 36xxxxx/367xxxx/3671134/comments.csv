This one works too, maybe not for those 'less fortunate' as to not have the ability to follow detaled instructions.

It works great...
But, I cant unzip with winrar, I have to use 7zip, but I found it on google very easy.

So - thanks for a great - working - torrent!
Wuuhuu!

- I'm wondering. Why zip it?
Its only 1-200 mb less... And I must admit, I not very fond of having a large sized zip file on my computer. I cant use it, and I've got limited space on my harddrive.
I think you should think about zip'ing your files.

I think, you've got windows right?

But if your windows arent in english, it might be called something different.
In danish, ""Dokumenter"".

That file can be found at http://www.dll-files.com/search.php?s=d3dx9_29

Or you can install DirextX 9.xx ...

I had the same problem.. It was because of missing files in the Battlefield 2142 folder that you put in My Docs.   I just extracted it again and it worked.

Compare the folder to the one in the rar file should be around 961 files"
,BobCFC,2007-06-04T18:59Z,"...to set a resolution of 1280x1024, go to your BF2142 launch icon, right-click on it and select Properties. Then in the Target box put a single blank space after the last character and insert +szx 1280 +szy 1024, substituting any other number for the 1280 width and 1024 height...

,DarnBoy,2007-12-02T06:01Z,The other way to play online is if you download a demo of it from fileplanet.com but it only lets you play several maps online but it's still fun. I would recommend buying the actual game kuz you don't have to waist any memory on your computer or on your blank CDs to play the game. :)
,DarnBoy,2007-12-02T06:04Z,By the way for those ppl who are having trouble playing the game on the great computers it's probably because you are running windows Vista. It slows the hell out of every game. XP can handle games way better and Vista only slows you down so just switch to xp.

if you do not see the ""Dopeman"" in the login screen, make sure you put the Battlefield 2142 folder in ""My Documents."" 

for those saying that there is no password, don't worry. just hit 'login' or w/e button there was and it will ask you if you want to play offline. Hit ok, and it'll continue.

3. Now you got 2 diffrent folders, named 2142 and Battlefield 2142.

The thing to do now, which i think most didnt quite understand is very simple. Copy the folder called ""2142"" over to ""My Documents"" ""Mina Dokument"" Or what its called depending on your operativ program language.

4. Go into the ""Battlefield 2142"" folder and just dubble click on the BF2142.exe file.

,Basse94,2008-04-13T18:14Z,and dopeman next time you load up a gam4e here search for the system requirements and past it in the information text so that noone hopefully downloads the games that they cant play
,robyablind,2008-04-25T04:19Z,"well why should dopeman give sys specs???

 he has already put effort in and risk by uploading the game!!!! 

it doesnt take long to google the game spec anyway......show your apreciation else 1 day these guys are gonna say f*ck this why bother.. too many ppl i read their comments and ask this and that and give their opinions, without a thankyou, do we really live in a world where we dont know manners ffs"
,Fredricko,2008-04-28T06:28Z,"Thanks dopeman, you allways deliver.

Is it really that hard for you to use google to search for the fucking specs that the game requires???

Dopeman is spending his time making these rips for us, and you have the fucking cheek to tell him to post the game specs in the commentary for the torrent to, you are a clown son!"

,Spikey00,2009-08-09T03:05Z,"Weapons/etc. are only unlocked whilst you play online, unfortunately."
,LordxDeath,2009-08-24T07:45Z,"Dear Dopeman

This is really important.

I'm Have troble with a few of your games, but this is about this one.

When I log on as you, its ok, I press Single player, set it up and then it goes to the loading screen. It say ""optimizing"" which I assume is ok. After it loads, the most of the screen (exept the map and the text) gone black. you can only see the map, and the words - Recon Assualt Engineer and Surport. You cant even see the done buttom! So i go on the internet and find out what it really looks like, i find out, then i go back yo the game and press *Where th DONE button is suppose to be, and then it say ""Changing Squard"" then it goes bact to the Black screen.

Thank you very much for reading this.

If you have the same problem.....

Please comment because I really like this game and we just can't afford to buy it.

Thank You
LordxDeath"

,Pwnzorz,2009-10-24T01:49Z,"YES THX SOOO MUCH MAN!!!!HERES HOW IT WORKED!:
=========================


Here's what happened to me. First downloading took toooo goddamn long, but.... finally i finished. after i unziped it and put the stuff where they belong, the bf2142.exe DID NOT WORK! maybe you guys might be complaining about that. but after doing some research, you need to update your directx so just download a direct x updater (maybe it doesn't matter) but then the directory where the .exe game was, needed this directx file called  d3dx9_29.dll or something so after you update (or whatever if you needed to) then go to your C:/Windows/system32 folder and  the directx file should be in there (d3dx9_29.dll) then copy it, (DON""T MOVE IT) copy it to the directory folder where the .exe game is and then try running the game again. It worked for me, and also after doing more research, you could play online if you get the bf2142 demo's .exe file and put it in the same directory as your full bf2142. So far the game is awesome and i hope i recommended more seeders XD any questions email me omfgwtfzomghax@gmail.com (and also you can't lvl up without hamachi or somethin)"
