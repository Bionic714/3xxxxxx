The Shaolin Plot (1977)

Plot:	An evil prince scours the earth, collecting kung fu manuals--usually by force. He disguises himself and enters Shaolin Temple as a student, hoping to get at their sacred manuals. But once he's found out, he resorts to desperate measures.

Overview:	Chan Sing plays a greedy evil prince whose favorite pastime is collecting kung fu manuals--usually by force. When the Shaolin Abbot refuses to hand over the temple's sacred manuals, Chan disguises himself and enters the temple as a student, waiting for just the right time to strike. Once his evil plot is about to be uncovered, he has to act fast, and kidnaps the Shaolin Abbot, demanding the kung fu manuals as ransom. Not a good idea. Now all of Shaolin Temple will make it their goal to see that he is destroyed.
