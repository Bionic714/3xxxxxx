,chillnoutt,2008-06-16T05:10Z,"bs, not all keygens are trojans.

here's the deal... there's a trojan in the keygen but i can get it to work... you have to set your computer clock to a specific date. this will also prevent the authorization warning from coming up after response code has been entered which is happening for some...

=====================
Sharing is caring!"
,sharealike42,2008-08-17T00:50Z,"Nesta08 - 

I had this issue initially as well. More than likely you need to set Sonar to automatically load the plug-in by pointing it to scan the directory where it is installed. (If you did not select the \program\files\cakewalk\vst plugins\ directory as your install location)

Do this one of two ways:
1. In Sonar by going to Insert>Soft Synths>PlugIn Layouts>Manage Layouts. Click the options button in VST Configuration and add your trilogy install path. 

2. Move your trilogy.dat file into the cakewalk plugin path.

Hope this helps!"
,sharealike42,2008-08-17T01:00Z,Sorry for the overposting here but choice 2 above does not quite work. You have to copy the entire trilogy directory into the vst plugins folder for cakewalk.

However, I did manage to bring with me my laptop with precious Trilogy keygen on it! 
I'm now hiding in one of the trash containers, from where I will continue sending authorization codes, until I'm discovered or until batteries runs out. :)))

It seems that all the peope with keygen problems have AVG antivirus. It will detect keygen as a trojan and block the path to file. 
Note that, when you reinstall the system in future, your challenge code will be different, so if you really need Trilogy, installing Kaspersky or Nod32 may solve the problem.  "

Obviously i'm quite weary to carry on using the keygen but maybe i should switch avast off and go ahead with it... After all i've re-installed the os and all of my software about 4 times in the last two weeks, i guess if i got a virus i'd have to re-install everything again.

Keygen is on Disc 1. It is not a trojan horse. I'm using the one provided with this torrent. Some antivirus programs  mark it as trojan, and block the path to a file. So, disable your antivirus protection before executing the keygen, especially if you have AVG, Avast or others. It should work fine with Nod32 and Kaspersky.

A note to everyone, the keygen is on disc 1, TURN OFF YOUR ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE, then open it. You shouldn't have any problems, if you do, try opening it as an administrator. If that still doesn't work then consult jollyroger,
the all powerful lord of all keygens!

If you get the error message when you enter your response code (could not find authorization, consult your reseller) , run your DAB (cubase, ableton etc.) in administrator mode. If you get another error message (Could not load .dat file), then figure out what to do and tell me! Please!!!!!!!!!!"

i am having the same problem with second error code (cannot load .dat file)

i tried disabling  my security and opened it under admin, no go

i dont know how to move the keygen back to its original folder like you suggested though, this is because could never move, open, or copy the keygen in the first place, i could only get to it, never open it though

any help would be greatly appreciated, HAIL TIMBADD, LORD OF KEYGENS!!!  RAGE!!!"

theguy155-
Its not the keygen you need to move. When you ran the installer, before all the keygen stuff, it asked you where you wanted to install the program, and where you wanted to put the data files. They need to stay there! If you have moved them, move them back to their original location. If you didn't or you forgot where they were supposed to be, maybe try reinstalling if you can...?

StayTwisted - Jolly Roger is no hero, he's just a cheap wannabe. I am lord of keygens, give me your weed and chips!

,TriggShy,2009-04-04T01:15Z,"Hi everybody!

For those who couldn't find the keygen in the package here a few more responses:

Name - Challenge - Response

fat_hands - 263862737 - 545945782
beyondcashed - 298691064 - 548482700
royeq - 276074006 - 522994342
Buddyboi - 291235373 - 528446686

I found the keygen in this package but in your case perhaps your anti-virus software put it into quarantine or deleted it.

If you have administrator privileges there's no need to start up in safe mode. I didn't have to.

Previous user is correct: you need to start your host application. Could be Cubase, etc. or in my case FL Studio 8. It will then ask you to authorize that's where you need the keygen for the challenge/response.

Hope this helps someone. Cheers!

I have norton and all you have to do is  disable your security software and open the keygen..It has no virus...its in DISC 1 and will open once you disable your internet security......ALSO FOR THOSE WHO HAVE VISTA...it said authorization code invaled contact selller...all you do is open FL STUDIO (or what ever you use to make your music) by right clicking and click RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR...Then you type in the response code and it will work flawless."

claymore69 - 301093393 - 520723084

I agree with Beatmaker. The keygen is on disc 1. If you disable your anti-virus software before you launch the keygen it should work. However, I noticed that some anti-virus programs might remove the keygen automatially already during the download. I use Avira AntiVir and I was able to stop it from deleting the keygen, since I saw the popup in time. If you know where your anti-virus software stores suspicious files (aka ""the vault"" :-)), you might be able to retrieve it from there."

,unfinishedreverend,2009-10-10T20:22Z,"Hi,

For all those of you struggling with the KeyGen, the way I got mine to work is by starting Windows in Safe mode. (btw if you don't know how to do this look here - http://www.pchell.com/support/safemode.shtml)

The Keygen wouldn't open on my computer until I opened it in safe mode.  Just jot down the challenge Trilogy gives you and then open the Keygen in safe mode.

Hope that helps!"

,goldfizz,2010-03-03T21:56Z,"SOLUTION: For those with Windows 7 (might work for other versions as well) that are having the issue where Trilogy cannot find the authorisation after you put in the correct response code, do this:

Right click your DAW (i.e., Ableton Live, Sonar, Cubase) executable within the start menu or the program file location and select 'Run as Administrator'.  Then load the Trilogy VST, input the response code and click ok.

Mine works perfect after doing this.  I'm running Windows 7 64-bit with Ableton Live 8.  Hope it helps some of you."

,schranzx,2010-07-27T21:45Z,"ok people,the keygen only works in SAFE MODE you gotta boot your system into SAFE MODE,now in case you dont know how to do this ill tell you,go to start menu in the search section type in msconfig 

Then go to boot,down close to the bottom left you will see a box with boot in safe mode or something to that effect,tick that box then press ok.

reboot,go to your host application for trilogy,open trilogy then copy your challenge code.

go to your keygen and enter your challenge code,copy response,go back to trilogy and paste.

Job done.

i had problem but if you read back on some comments there is COMMENTS TELLING YOU THE KEYGEN ONLY WORKS IN SAFE MODE.

thanks for the upload moe_zart works like a dream ("",)"
,schranzx,2010-07-27T21:47Z,oh to change the setting from booting into safe mode everytime just type in msconfig again and uncheck the box in the boot section again.
,Spiritfire123,2010-07-28T00:20Z,"Schranzx is completely correct. What I was doing wrong was that I wasn't entering the provided response while still in safe mode. You must boot up trilogy, get the challenge, use the keygen, and enter the response, all in safe mode!

Thank you Schranzx!"

I try the safe mode method won window 7, the keygen still doesnt work. THX !"
,Ockspra,2010-10-22T01:29Z,"To everyone who is having trouble with this let me reassure you.

- You do NOT need to be in SAFE MODE access the Keygen.

- As far as I can tell the Keygen is CLEAN, NO VIRUS' my AVG didn't pick up anything wrong with the file.

Here is what I did to get the the keygen.

(This is for PC) Mac you can do the same thing you just need a similar program to Daemon Tools. I think Toaster might be on program you can use not sure.

1.) I downloaded Daemon tools so I can load the ISO. 

2.) After you download Daemon tools, download torrent.

3.) Once torrent is done downloading, then open up the file where you downloaded it too. Example, My Documents, etc.

4.) Open up the file with Winrar or Winzip, then extract it the document by ""right clicking"" then ""Extract to Spectrosonics - Trilogy."" -It will extract in the same folder that you downloaded it too.

5.) Once you extracted open up the the file, and click on Disc 1.

6.) Load it up in Daemon tools or what program you choose to use.

7.) Then once the image is loaded in Daemon tools. Go to ""My Computer"" and look for the loaded ISO Image.

8.) Right-click on the Icon of the loaded image and go to ""Open folder"" so you can view the files on Disc.

9.) Locate the the Keygen, plug in your Challenge if you have one already, and hit generate!

These are the steps I did to get my Trilogy up and working, seeing that one on on here wants to help explain how to use or access the Keygen. Plus, I have the legit copy I just had to reinstall Trilogy.
"
,Ockspra,2010-10-22T01:32Z,"OH! Almost forgot! To get the Authorization with Trilogy to work. Just load up Cubase, Nuendo, etc. Load it up in ""Run as Administrator."" 

Right-click then look for ""Run as Administrator""

Your all set!"

*Once downloaded mount the .ISO (1 out of 5 disc) and run the installation.
*Proceed with installation
*Mount the next disc, etc.
*Once fully installed open your software (Pro Tools, Reaper, Sonar)
*Open the VSTi
*Copy the Challenge
*Open the keygen, paste the challenge
*Click Generate
*Copy the new code and paste it in the opened VSTi

If you get this error ""could not find authorization. please contact your reseller of plugsound for further information."" MAKE SURE YOU'RE RUNNING YOU SOUND SOFTWARE AS ADMINISTRATOR (Right click, in my case Reaper, and click Run As Administrator)
