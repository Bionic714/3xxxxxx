,Kothoga,2007-04-30T22:56Z,"This time I remember to make multiple trackers so you don't steal the upload from me Phlebas :D

and remember to upload this after downloading this"
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-05-01T10:42Z,"I'm so happy that I don't have to do that job :-)

I usually seed to 20-30 times the download, wished more would do that..."
,Kothoga,2007-05-01T11:56Z,I usually try to seed about 9999% of the thing I seed...that way ppl get the thing I upload
