,Secondhandthoughts,2010-11-08T18:45Z,"Oh and 'When The Tigers Broke Free"" is from 'the wall'"
,niggyniggnigg,2010-11-23T17:49Z,"well when the tigers broke free was orignally on the wall the movie, but it is not from the wall the album.

however, it was released as track 4 on the remastered version of the final cut that was released in 2004.

,niggyniggnigg,2010-11-23T17:49Z,"oh, but everyone else is correct that this track listing is from darkside, not final cut.
