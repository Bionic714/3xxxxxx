,458stargt,2008-08-25T00:42Z,"hi, with this cracked version, i just can't install the full liveries pack from the maddog site..., it says that this file contains invalid data.

i have another version of the installer, but there the installation finishes and it says: invalid data bla bla, and error 21FC

i know this is because of the invalid version we have, but does anyone know how to fix it?

thx for help,
458stargt"
