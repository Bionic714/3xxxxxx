,Mouchi,2007-12-06T22:37Z,"Smart att lägga upp en film som cdr format, det går inte direkt att bränna ut den som en dvd-film!
Sure, man kan se den via datorn, men det är ganska bra om man skriver det så folk vet det när de laddar ned filmen!"
,bobochko,2007-12-13T10:51Z,"This is Gumball3000 2006, not 2007"

,elvis_lever,2009-04-26T23:16Z,"you are fucking ritarded, the movie was released in 07 but it's filmed in 06"
,Quiet_German,2009-05-08T04:32Z,"To view these you have to unzip a file at the bottom of each folder you get when you download it.  Look towards the bottom (like, next to last file) and you will see a rar file.  Just unzip it.  That's the movie."
