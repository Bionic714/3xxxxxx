Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed, Die (1926)
Directed by Lotte Reiniger

Collector's Edition Restored from Original Tinted 35mm Archival Material

When The Adventures of Prince Achmed premiered in Germany on September 23, 1926, it was hailed as the first full length animated film. More than seventy five years later, this enchanting film still stands as one of the great classics of animation- beautiful, mesmerizing and utterly seductive. Director Lotte Reiniger was able to create pure magic with her hand cut silhouettes: with her elegant, intricate designs, she could bring characters vividly to life and give the story a rare lyrical quality.

Taken from The Arabian Nights, the film tells the story of a wicked sorcerer who tricks Prince Achmed into mounting a magical flying horse and sends the rider off on a flight to his death. But the prince foils the magician's plan and soars headlong into a series of wondrous adventures- joining forces with Aladdin and the Witch of the Fiery Mountains, doing battle with the sorcerer's army of monsters and demons and falling in love with the beautiful Princess Peri Banu.

This cinematic treasure has been beautifully restored with all its spectacular original color tinting and with a new orchestral recording of the magnificent original score by Wolfgang Zeller. Thrilling, sensuous and dazzling, The Adventures of Prince Achmed will enthrall children and film enthusiasts of all ages. This collector's edition includes a marvelous 60 minute documentary on pioneer animator Lotte Reiniger.
