i bought the game!! and i got everything! a little box and a CD :P !!
And a lot of other things!
You just get some kind of files and no CD or something.
if you burn it to a CD ju just have a copy of the CD. Not the game!
But you can run the game, but you dont have the game anyway!"

,adrian4408,2010-04-02T17:42Z,"I'm with Alex on this one TOED is a worm virus as picked up by Avast.

However the image works fine, mount it, install, job done! No patches or cracks needed.

Thanks for the upload, but why is TOED a worm virus?"
,SachBro,2010-05-20T20:46Z,"I dunno why but the game hangs and lags like hell on my pc and I have a good enough rig to run Crysis, I mean Crysis for God Sakes, any advise would be greatly appreciated. "
,bfg666,2010-09-06T22:17Z,"@jeff-ffej: Dude, what's the point of ""abbreviating"" the word ""upload"" with ""u/load""? I mean, the whole purpose of abbreviation is to shorten words, right?..."
,Rayment,2011-06-30T01:27Z,I downloaded this game extracted the files and run the program and norton blocked trojan horse threat may contain virus
