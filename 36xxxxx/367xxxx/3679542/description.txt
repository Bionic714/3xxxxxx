
The One Eyed Dude strikes back with...


Title:

.:. URBAN CHAOS! (c) EIDOS/MUCKYFOOT 100% -RiP n FiXED- .:.
 

Ripped:

not really much!


About:

The fact that Urban Chaos is an enjoyable third-person action 
game with no switch flipping, box pushing, or key finding should 
be reason enough for you to purchase it. That it's also great looking,
inventive, funny, and even a little tactical makes it a must for anyone
who can appreciate stylish but relatively mindless console-style action.

Note about CMR Rally 4

During Installation appeared an error msg, but you might be able to play 
it anyway by keep pressing "Enter" (when error msg appears!) unfortunately 
i did not make a backup so there wont be any kind of fix or something!...
keep pressing "Enter" till Install has been finished! 
You can play! the game. the only thing which fucks up are the SFX...
