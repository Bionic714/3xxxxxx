  Hot Rods To Hell is really a good look at late sixties culture. The acting by onetime stars Dana Andrews and Jeanne Crain, is fine. They are well supported by Mimsy Farmer and Laurie Mock, both of whom would soon be seen in \\\'\\\'Riot On Sunset Strip\\\'\\\' that same year. The Sam Katzman production may be low budget, but it still looks decent. the Fred Karger score is suitably dramatic. The songs are...(oh well, you can\\\'t have everything) undoubtedly an oldster\\\'s idea of \\\'\\\'rock and roll\\\'\\\' though the authors also wrote material for Elvis! It moves pretty fast, both in the theatrical version which ran 90 minutes, and the 100 minute version first seen on ABC.TCM has the latter print, and shows it occasionally from time to time. Strangely enough, TNT used to run the theatrical one. One critic, in his review stated \\\'\\\'Jeanne Crain is still lovely to look at.\\\'\\\' She was, indeed. An enjoyable film.
