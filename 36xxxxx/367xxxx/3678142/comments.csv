I also have this problem. I can also hear that windows error sound but no window shows up. At first the game worked just fine for me and then one day it stoped working i have tried unpacking again and also the Vitality release all with the same result. Also the information on bioware forums is completely useless and they seem not to be interested in releasing a patch.

Has anyone figured out a workaround yet?"

It plays great, and thanks for that, but I want me some cutscenes!

I have the movie folder in my JE folder, as I was told to do.
So, what's up?"
,par4dr00p,2008-01-05T15:17Z,"It is possible to play this release with movies. First, download a full ISO release (a 6,4gb torrent), mount and extract the ""movie*.rar"" files from the ""/data"" folder directly into your game folder.

This will copy all movies to your ""/JE/movies"" folder where they belong. If you previously installed the black screen fix, you'll have to overwrite all existing files."
,par4dr00p,2008-01-05T15:20Z,"This is a very good release, although you won't be able to see the movies.

However, it is possible to play this release with movies if you extract them from a full image release. Download and mount the ISO, extract all ""movies*.rar"" files from the ""/data"" folder to your game folder.
This should create a folder called ""/movies"" in your game folder. If you previously installed the black screen fix, you'll have to overwrite all existing files.

Enjoy."
,par4dr00p,2008-01-05T15:22Z,"The ""movie"" fix does not in fact add movies. It just prevents the game from freezing due to lacking movie files."

,riplikethat,2008-03-23T14:40Z,"WARNING: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT.

Not because it has viruses or doesn't work. It works fine and all, the problem is that it 'does not' have any in-game cutscenes even though dopeman said that he left ""..all of the actual gameplay/story vids.."".

Yeah well, he didn't. There are no movies, and that sucks because in-game plot is forwarded using those cutscenes. In an RPG, leaving even simple cinematics can fuck up the game and in JE it gets worse because the game actually shows in-game plot scenes through pre-rendered cutscenes.

So avoid this torrent, download the full DVD ISO instead."

,Veroryn,2010-09-28T02:58Z,"This is a good game, and deserves all the praise it's gotten, but there are two main ways to judge a games worth: gameplay (how smooth or rough, does the flow of the game feel natural, is the command interface user-friendly, etc.) and storyline (does the tale the game is telling captivate you, are there to many distractions, how well is the story presented, etc.)

I mention these because, while the game itself is a good one, Dopeman has officially desecrated the storyline by removing all non-gameplay (meaning cinematic-only) movies or videos from this file. Most of the story is told through these cutscenes. The first example I can really provide is Master Li destroying the Assassin's ship. Suddenly Li is present, and the boat is destroyed and on fire in the background, and the Assassin is dead. Two cutscenes gone, and it leaves new-comers wondering what the hell happened, and old hands at JE are saying ""Where was the action? That was a good part!"" It shows a whole new light on Li, and it's gone. The player must infer much of what is happening throughout the game without the videos, which demolishes immersion and the smooth, well-presented storyline of the Jade Empire game.

That said, I am currently looking for a new copy of the game. If you really, genuinely don't care about the storyline, then by all means, download this game, but for myself and the rest who love the story, look elsewhere. Good job, Dopeman.

Not to say that this is not a good copy of the game itself. The .exe based program is wonderful, and the copy is good, but the best part of this game, in my opinion, was the story, and that was taken from me. I understand that this is a free copy, so I shouldn't bitch, blah, blah, blah, snore, but if you're going to present a file, give all of it, not just some of it."
,a1s,2011-02-12T15:09Z,"""I left all of the actual gameplay/story vids."" 
THIS IS NOT TRUE!
*All* videos have been removed from this game, you can usually guess what is happening from the dialog (I got to chapter II, and had no problems), but it is annoying.
(BTW, if someone knows where I can get just the movie files (the ones in the 'movies' directory, with the .bic extension), that would make me a happy person)


""it started to load and then said 'Error loading saved file'""
Run the game 'as administrator', that fixes it.


""I reach the beach and kill the pirates, it goes to the cut scene where the captain issues a further challenge, the screen then goes blank""
fix dopeman's fix (it's on the site)"

The first three times it happened it happened to the override folder, and then it did it to the launcher folder on my fourth try.  Can anyone explain what's doing this?  Did the torrent get corrupted while I was DLing it maybe?"
,lilstone,2011-08-10T17:46Z,Well I got past that error but now the game doesn't even start.  I double click JadeEmpire.exe and nothing happens.  JadeEmpire shows up as a process in my task manager for a split second and disappears.  I've tried to launch it from the launcher as well.
