For the time being there is no working way to play dumps of the games on the PS3 !!!

Stop wasting any body's time with your bullshit !"

For all whom do not already know, you unrar this or whatever, until you have nothing but a .PUP file. put this on a big flash drive, or external HDD, it should be like this, for this game:
(LETTER):\GAME\GUNDAM.PUP
OR try (L):\GAMES\GUNDAM.PUP
OR if that STILL WONT WORK:
(L):\PS3\GUNDAM.PUP

Note that all folder names need to be in CAPSLOCK!!!

Your Welcome."
