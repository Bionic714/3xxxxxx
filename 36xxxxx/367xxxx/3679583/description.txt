Lords of chaos - Rise of the satanic metal underground!

I was suprised this book wasn't anywhere to find here on TBP, so for all the black/death metal underground maniacs out there...here it is!

This a handscanned .pdf version of the original book, so all the pictures and the like of the original book is in this file.

It features the string events which happened during the early 90's in Norway, the killing of euronymous, church burnings random murder etc etc.

Featuring interviews with Mayhem members, Emperor, Darkthrone  etc.

Enjoy!


Horns up!
