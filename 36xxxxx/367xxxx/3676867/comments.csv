,jnd,2007-05-19T18:54Z,"Unfortunately, cracks that change the Directory Opus executable's digital signature like the p-Hell patch makes Directory Opus after some hour or so switch to viewing short (DOS ""8.3"") file names. You only resolve that by restarting the program, but unfortunately that gets old quick. :-(

I think the only good fix for this program would be an in-memory crack, not something that changes the EXE."
