You shouldn't have more than maybe 4 pieces per MP3, all the micro pieces will take forever to connect to."

thank you !"
,marcus_ivo,2007-07-31T14:41Z,cheers!
,artvandelay2007,2008-03-21T12:42Z,"128kbps is really awful. Also, don't you know how to tag your mp3s?  

But hey, thanks!"
,stuart38p,2008-04-27T00:09Z,"Thanks very much.
With all those seeders around it down loaded in a flash."
,ubbe1961,2008-05-01T16:41Z,Thank you
,Makewa,2008-12-03T03:45Z,"Thanks very much.
Tags aren't too relevant - I can just 'find album info' and its all there.
The smaller pieces are great for those of us on a slow connection - hash failures waste smaller bites of data - and for those who want only selected tracks small pieces are more efficient.
Great torrent!"
,dave1235,2009-01-20T00:58Z,"Note that the size is apparently 128kbps
Notice the size is small for a two album set."
,debakaputite,2009-05-30T03:45Z,"small / big who cares ??
thanks !! 
if something is too small for you - there are pills to make it bigger :)"
,caliwillbemine,2009-12-10T02:13Z,"debakaputite: 
i care, not everyone has a crappy audio system"
,debakaputite,2011-09-12T00:51Z,"you got me here - I have no audio systems at all :)  
so I prefer small files to carry around. 
But if you open ur eyes , you will see, that 35 songs in 123MB is about right for 128kbps  / 1MB per minute/
So if someone is unhappy - don't fucking download and don't complain !!!!
Thanks Ekolb ! Your torrents are great, movies and all !"
