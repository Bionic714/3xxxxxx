Queen are an English rock band, formed in 1970 in London by Brian May, Freddie Mercury, and Roger Taylor, with John Deacon joining the following year. Britain's most successful band of the past three decades, the band rose to prominence during the 1970s and still retain a large international fan base.

Greatest Hits is a 1981 Queen compilation. The record, released on November 2, 1981, is the UK's all-time best-selling album. Combined with Greatest Hits II it became the definitive Queen compilation. While a domestic release with different tracks but the same cover art was available in the US in 1981, the British release was available to United States customers only by import until the 1995 release of Greatest Hits I & II, which combined the two discs. The seventeen-track UK Greatest Hits disc was released in the U.S. on its own for the first time, with a few bonus tracks, in 2004 under the name Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition.
