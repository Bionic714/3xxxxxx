But America do suck! 20 % of the people live in poverty. 20 f...ing %, that's 60 millions! 10 % can't read a simple sentence, that's 30 millions. USA is f...ed up. Even the president can't read a simple sentence."

This is just within the first 5 minutes of downloading."
,Petter92,2008-07-31T19:18Z,somebody knows about a good sub for this?
,BioWerks,2008-08-04T10:19Z,"Non-American FAGGOTS, if it weren't for us than you wouldn't even have this Internet to bash us on. 
Or this show to watch while you fuck your same sex partners. 

P.S. Thanks for the up I haven't really watched this show yet... Hope it doesn't suck as much as these socialist douche-bags."
,Hedelma,2008-08-04T22:01Z,"If the internet wouldn't exist we wouldn't miss it. 
If television wouldn't exist we wouldn't want anyone to make television series.
If America didn't exist as we know it the world would be quite different.
If..

If we really were a bunch of socialist douche-bags we wouldn't have computers to get on the internet and mock you guys with.

And most of all why would we want to have sex while watching a TV series about a peculiar doctor?

Thanks for the up!"

,ScarySquirrel,2008-10-03T00:24Z,"This season runs well on Ubuntu Linux VLC player, with the fluendo codecs set."
,ScarySquirrel,2008-10-03T00:26Z,This does not strike me as the right place to vent political opinions.
,ScarySquirrel,2008-10-22T03:16Z,"I downloaded this season with the Transmission Bittorrent client.
It played well, but with some skipping on Ubuntu 7.10 Hardy with the xine codec set. It had no skipping on Windows.
Neither the premise or storyline require suspension of disbelief.  Still, it's interesting. "
,bugler18,2008-11-01T23:35Z,could people please seed? getting only 80 kb/s!!
,syrix,2008-11-23T22:59Z,"BioWerks: If it wasnt for germany and ww2 usa would have been quite annother country today.. No great scientist would have moved from europe to Usa to create all the technologies you have today. Spacetravelling who laid the ground work? germany.. Usa would be NOTHING today if it wasnt for ww2..
And socialism seems to be the only thing that actually works.. Look at usa and how screwd it is now? And the reason people mock, riddicule and hate USA is because of ignorant and stupid people like you BioWerks"

On a side-note about the whole political thing, it's too bad there's so much animosity towards Americans.  Being American myself, I've been interested in traveling to countries other than my own.  I hope this American hatred is only you few and not the mass-majority of people in the above mentioned countries."
