,mr.merrick,2007-04-29T16:28Z,"Any seed? - btw, the Flash video encoder lacks a patch..."
,Roffles_The_Mighty,2007-04-29T17:55Z,Sorry i stopped seeding for a bit; one of my hard drives was overheating because of the massive amounts of seeding to the massive number of peers from like 4 different sites and crashed for a bit. Anyway im back online now
,mjf7419,2007-04-30T00:35Z,"If you have any problems installing on VISTA (i.e. error 2739), open a command prompt as an administrator and run the following commands:

regsvr32 c:\windows\system32\vbscript.dll

regsvr32 c:\windows\system32\jscript.dll

To open an admin command prompt, clict on START, then type ""cmd"" (without quotes), then right click, then click ""run as administrator"", then type in the above commands or copy and paste them in.  Voila, it will work."

I unzip all the files (Z01,Z02...) and I get the application size 1.74 GB,and can't install it. Everything freezes when I click on the icon...
Don't have any idea left, so I would really appreciate if somebody could write what do I have to do..."
,Roffles_The_Mighty,2007-05-02T06:10Z,Yeah its gonna freeze like no other when you do that. its copying all the installer files to a temp directory or wherever you told it to. give it a few min and then you can run the actual cs3 installer

,3atM3Aliv3,2007-06-23T19:29Z,Is this clean from viruses and trojans?
,jillbates,2007-07-08T18:23Z,"MKDEVs cracks are loaded with backdoor trojans

scan the cracks with any anvirus program and you will see this immediately

I personally don't see why they bother  they must get lucky sometimes I guess...

but why screw the community, poor people and students and those trying to get into design are the ones downloading these programs so if they are looking for lots of lucrative credit card details then they are looking in the wrong place"
