,Roffles_The_Mighty,2007-04-26T08:23Z,"Did you follow the instructions in the nfo? You might need to reboot though, as people are reporting issues with this across norton distros. Its gotta reinit some of the main norton components or some such. Anyway, reboot and follow the nfo."

How the HELL can anyone call this Norton 360, when even the files included is namned Norton Internet Security 2007 (NIS2007) ??

/edgeiso.nfo 3.57 KiB 
/keygen.exe 393 KiB 
/nis2007v102030.iso 196.66 MiB 

Just click on Files/Filer up under the name of the torrent, and anyone can see this!
