,whozze,2007-08-09T18:09Z,"HAHA evryone wel to all you ppl out dere wondering how to downgrade etc you will find your aswer with google search or try to google psphacks 

anyways for the one in post above that wonder if he needed to dowgrade hes psp and running a version 3.11 
Answer: Yes you need to downgrade your psp but sadely it isent any 3.11 dowgrader but you can use the 3.50 downgrader but then you need a UMD/Game Named Lumines so then you need to order lumines insert that in your psp and use the 3.50 downgrader so all hope isent lost for you either =)  hope this helps olmokram. and for all you other confused ppl :P ISO folder can be found/created on you psp when you use the usb cable so my last advice to all off you READ Info about downgrading upgrading evry thing that you need to know about stuff like this either search on google or try PSP-HACKS.com and read dont ask here READ 

NOW i want to ask a question about the GAME =) how is it ? i have read abit about the game but any one of you alredy downloded it could give an feedback what you think about the game then i would be realy happy thx agen for a great torrent and keep going ppl happy summer "
