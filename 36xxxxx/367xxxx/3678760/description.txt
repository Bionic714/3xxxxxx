Hi!

This is my first ever torrent, and I sort of taught myself how to use this. Let's just hope it works!

Air have already carved a name for themselves with their romantic ambient/electronic/lo-fi work. With Pocket Symphony, Air member Nicholas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel add new instruments such as the koto and shamisen to their repertoire - largely a result of Nick Godin's travels to Japan before production on the album began. The album also features guest appearances from Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker, as well as Neil Hannon.

Les Premiers Symptomes EP (1999)
