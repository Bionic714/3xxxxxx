INFO:

When Izzy is looking through her telescope at the nebulae, it is bright and colorful. A telescope that small can not pick up color from objects that far away. Also, when she calls Tommy to come and look at the nebulae she does not readjust the telescope at all. Looking at objects that far away very quickly move out of view due to the spin of the earth and thus by the time Tommy got to the telescope the nebula would no longer be visible.
