Disasterpieces is a live DVD featuring the band Slipknot. The DVD was quite successful, due to the popularity of the band and the quality of performances, which used intricately placed cameras on the headstock of a guitar and a "first person" point of view of several band-members. Including the DVD-ability to pick your preferred camera-angle during the show.

Disasterpieces has so far sold over 3 million copies in America alone.[citation needed]
