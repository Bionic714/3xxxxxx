,malanzirotti,2008-04-10T03:13Z,"No subtitles show up in the video, which I see with an up to date VLC player, even though the downloaded directory included subtitle .srt files. The VLC's ""video""  scrol down menu does not include the ""subtitles"" command for this video.  Evidently, VLC is failing to upload the .srt files automatically.  Is there a manual way to ""persuade"" VLC to show the subtitles? or some other way? Please, help, if you feel you know the solution."
