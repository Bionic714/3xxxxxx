,Spooge1,2008-01-15T13:00Z,"The show's theme song for the first two seasons is an adaptation of the United States Marine Corps running cadence song ""Fired Up... Feels Good"" and created by the Los Angeles based composer Robert Duncan. The new theme song for the third season, also by Duncan, is called ""Walk the Fire"".[1]"
