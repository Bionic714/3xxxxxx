A real shame no one is seeding when you went to the trouble of creating and upping this.
How did you get the songs to digital? Is the sound any good? These albums have sadly never seen a cd release right?
4 out of 5 are one of my true fav bands ever. I too am still, to this day astounded that they did not get noticed with 2nd opinion when i listen to it (it was for me the masterpiece, while the debut is wonderful too). Great melodious pop music and the band were certainly a little above average when it came to the musician stakes.
I have nice LP's of both albums. I recorded 2nd opinion to pure uncompressed high quality digital in one straight file a while back. I must go and split the tracks and up it.
I pray that one day soon these albums get an official cd release. Does nobody else absolutely love this band? They sure are one of the most bafflingly under-rated in history.
Good work. Thanks again."

My download has stalled at 88.2% for the past week, I hope the rest of it is still out there...so close, yet so far!"
