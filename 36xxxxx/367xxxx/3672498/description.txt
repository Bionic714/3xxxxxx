This Delaware based band released two albums on Nemperor Records in the early 80's.  This, the first, has much more of a nu wave sound than the other, but both are pretty good.  Tongue in cheek lyrics and catchy pop melodies abound here, and it's astonishing that this didn't catch on back in the day.
If anyone's interested, I'll upload their second album.
Enjoy and seed!
