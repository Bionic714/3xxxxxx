The two attached files are repairs/returns to about normal for Adobe Fireworks CS3 splash screen, which had the splahscreen, startup page and About logos hacked.

1.  copy the "Fireworks resources.dll" to the fireworks install directory/English/resources/ and replace the "Fireworks Resources.dll" there.

2.  copy the banner.png to the fireworks install directory/English/movies/resources/images/ and replace the banner.png there.

Ciao.
