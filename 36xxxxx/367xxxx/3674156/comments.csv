,xyz001,2007-04-28T22:37Z,"If any of you are downloading with like 5-20 kb/s it is not because there is not enough people seeding. 


In Azeurus your active download should have a green icon next to it. If it is yellow your connection is not perfect. 


If your router supports UPnP (universal plug n play) you should go to your router settings (type the router adress in the browser) and switch UPnP on. 


When I did that, the icon turned green and download speed went up to 200-400 kb/s. 


If your router does not support UPnP it is more complicated. Then you have to set it up to forward connections to the local adress of your pc. Read about that on the Azeurus Wiki.

Now i got some of the programs to work.

You need to download another torrent that has all the crack files. (All the .exe files needs to be replaced). 

Easiest way to do this is to find one here, and then in azeurus select only the crack files, and not the entire package, so you dont have to download 2 GB again.

The thing is. Acrobat doesn't have a crack, but illustrator, photoshop and indesign are working fine.

This torrent is basically kind of uncomplete. It misses the cracks, and the cracks only exists for some of the programs.

,La_fertilidad,2007-05-13T14:59Z,"Nice find

Type: Documentary

Rating: NR

Running Time: 96 Minutes

Directed by: Walon Green

Soundtrack: Stevie Wonder

The thesis of this visually stunning documentary feature is that plants have feelings, too, and that they have a variety of ways of expressing them. Based on the best-selling book by Peter Topkins and Christopher Bird, the custom of talking to one's houseplants is strongly recommended by the filmmakers. Though scientific in tone, the film does not air the opposing view advocated by, perhaps, a majority of scientists. One highlight of the film is its original musical score by Stevie Wonder. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide

i dont' know how else to help you if you won't follow instructions.  there was no need to use the cracks.    my instructions tell how to install and activate using a keygen serial number which activates the software as if it were legit.  that way it will update as it would if you bought it.  the cracks obviously do not work. 

now you might be screwed because you already have adobe stuff on your computer so it might not activate correctly.  but maybe try removing all adobe products from your computer and reinstalling using my instructions or ones in previous comments that are similar."
