I've seen enough about this guy's previous presentations to seriously doubt his credibility. I love it when people see conspiracies everywhere.  

Don't believe everything you see.  People, especially supposed ""expert"" professors, can twist words and doctor up evidence, probably just as much as a government can.  "

but i don't think these ""expert professors"" who see theories of conspiracies & as u put it are capable of doctoring evidences would have the same agenda as your government's ""managed-terrorism"", right?"
