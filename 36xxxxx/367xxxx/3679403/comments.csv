,Xsoldat,2007-07-19T14:23Z,"I got a problem which i hope someone can help me with. When i download Stronghold 2 i get folders with 1 bin and a cue file. When i try and mount them on daemon tools i get autorun error. Since i have VLC installed my computer also says that the files are VLC files. What i understand u are supposed to unpack them somehow but i have no idea how, tried soo many things, please help!"
,mr_fong,2007-07-20T21:39Z,"Xsoldat:

u did everything right. just mount with daemon tools and it should install from there. u got an autorun error so u successful mounted the image but autorunning is not working. make sure u downloaded the whole torrent. maybe there is a missing chunk. do a force recheck on ur bittorrent app. sometimes the app will tell u ur torrent is 100% complete but doin a force recheck will confirm that. if ur refering to VLC media player then i dont think they are the same. dont open it with that."
,flipyens1,2007-07-27T00:07Z,"This game is NOT working, when installing from cd 1  to cd2 i get an error saying that something is wrong. Then i checked cd2 and found out that the file Data3.cab (which is the biggest one) is damaged. First time i downloaded it i thought, oh, it might happend something when i dowloaded it, tried again with the same result. When installing i used Daemon tools to mount the file. All other files on the cd seems OK. If anyone have any idea how to fix this, please say it. "
,flipyens1,2007-07-27T00:28Z,"NVM! the file is not damage, its just me. Seems like something else is wrong... Could someone that have made this working please tell me how they did it. thx"
,flipyens1,2007-07-27T13:21Z,"ok now, this is what i have done:
Mounted the cd 2 .cue file and when the installing ask for cd 2 i take it into the Disk2 folder where the data3.cab file is, then i click OK, i get the error:
***IS_NOT_DEFINED*** then the install shuts down. i tried using the different emulations on Daemon tools like RMPS but nothing changes..:/ need help with this. I have the original game on cd tho the cd2 is broken so i have only downloaded the second one, can it be becuase of different versions of the game or?"

It's on disk 2 in the HOODLUM directory.  It's an old crack so you should probably update the game and download an updated crack.  Saying you can't play the game because you can't find the crack is silly, they're all over the place.  Try gamecopyworld."
,Ankstek013,2008-04-27T16:56Z,"flipyens1, you dont mount the .cue file its the bin file you have to mount (if its the larger of them). if u cant find it when u browse it in daemon tools u have to set it to all files and not just all image files and it should work =)"
,Destroy850,2008-04-29T05:31Z,"yeah i dunno
i cant get this to work at all.
everytime i mount the disk it tells me wrong disk inserted.
i've tried just about evrything.
but i cant get it.
if someone had the same problem and found out how to get it working comment it on here!"

,EliteSniper,2008-06-12T09:57Z,I downloading the game now but it downloads very very slow i download with Azureus Vuze! If someone knows better download programme then tell me! Sry about my bad english!
,jan-the-pirat,2008-12-22T01:22Z,"azureus vuze is fine, but i think utorrent might be a LITTLE better.. BUT the reason its going slow is because therer are so few seeders...
OR you need to change the network seting..
And to get it to work you can:
1: mount cd 1 (it will most likely give you a autorun error, just open the cd's and find the install file) then the install begins it MIGHT give you a error when its finisht, ignore it. and go online and find the lattest patch (1.4.1) and install it, the go to gamecopyworld.com and search for sronghold 2, the browse the site you find and find someting called a mini image, download it, and mount it with daemon tools, then you get a autorun error, ignore it a clik the shortcut for stronghold (on your desktop) and press play, the game starts and  youcan play ofline-LAN and last time i cheked also online... :D:D:D:D:D
2: Install the game, download crack to stronghold 1.0 copy it to the gamedir (you can right click and cose options the press find location, and windows willl take you to the game dir, in there you extrakt/copy the crack to, then PLAY..."
