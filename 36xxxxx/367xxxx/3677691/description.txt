Shared torrent with demonoid, made a tracker list out of it to try keeping the swarm together. Hope it works.

I do not abandon my torrents, but myPC is not always on and I never seed at night, (CET). Fair upload speed.

Original comment:
"Jim and Tim decide to take on the duties of the Middleton Mascot since Ron is now a football player, but this is much to his dismay. However, he eventually sees that it is for the best and trains them himself. Meanwhile, Drakken finally gets broken out of prison by an alien named Warmonga, who thinks he is the The Great Blue, a greatly honored one on her planet, after she sees his rap commercial from Rappin' Drakken. When Shego stops by to see Doctor Drakken, he fires her and replaces her with Warmonga. Doctor Drakken and Warmonga decide to rid the world of Kim Possible with Warmonga's alien technology. Kim only succeeds in stopping him when Wade gives the battlesuit an invisible power upgrade.
