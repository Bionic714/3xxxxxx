    ??     Making music should be as easy as powering up a computer, loading up a          ??
    ?? powerful piece of music software, and getting down to business. And it is. Reason   ??
    ?? 3.0 is a virtual studio rack with all the tools and instruments you need to turn    ??
    ?? your ideas into music. And it's more than just a set of excellent synths and        ??
    ?? effects. It's a complete music system. Step into the age of Reason.                 ??
    ??                                                                                     ??
    ??     As a Reason user, you can forget about the downsides of music production.       ??
    ?? Forget malfunctioning modules and confusing connections. Reason's cablesdon't       ??
    ?? tangle. Forget about tiny backlit displays and steep learning curves. Reason is so  ??
    ?? direct you'll learn it in minutes. And forget the tedious process of gathering all  ??
    ?? the different disks and sound banks needed to load up a song. With Reason, picking  ??
    ?? up where you left off ??? be it last night or last month ??? is as simple as        ??
    ?? turning the power on. When you save your music, your whole studio setup is stored   ??
    ?? along with it. You can even include your samples, loops and drum kits in the        ??
    ?? Reason file, for easy web publishing or email collaboration with other Reason       ??
    ?? users. For once, total recall is truly total.                                       ??
    ??                                                                                     ??
    ??     And so is the sound. The audio quality is everything you would expect from      ??
    ?? Propellerhead Software. But pristine sound quality is only half the story; the      ??
    ?? instruments and effects in Reason are loaded with character and attitude. Although  ??
    ?? easy to learn and a breeze to use, Reason is an extremely flexible system that's    ??
    ?? as complex and advanced as you make it. And with sophisticated tools such as the    ??
    ?? MClass mastering suite, or the Combinator, which lets you build new instruments     ??
    ?? and effects by combining and layering Reason devices, Reason will not just          ??
    ?? impress, but inspire you.                                                           ??
