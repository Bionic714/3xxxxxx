,Acha Mallacha,2007-05-06T23:54Z,I'm new at this... How do I seed?
,merkery,2007-05-12T01:36Z,"bru cifer is right.

you need to use ""PowerISO"" or something similar to either burn each nfo/bin/cue/iso (it'll be one of those) to a disc, or to a virtual drive on your computer. the help page on PowerISO will explain it but basically it tricks your computer into thinking there is a disc in there. 

then just ""open"" your virtual discs and click install, or follow the instructions that came with the torrent. e'voila. "
,CabStyle,2007-05-12T17:46Z,"to seed just keep the torrent going after you downloaded it and
please do that as i've got no speed right now!"
,CabStyle,2007-05-12T17:51Z,"btw i've never needed to burn an iso to a cd. just open the iso file with the program ""acohol 120%"" wich is seeded here at pbay if you want it
or Deamon Tools, but that is usually packed with virus xP"
,Deezo_m1,2007-05-13T17:09Z,"Well I have just installed with no probs without even burning a cd ... 


For you guys having trouble try this :) 


Use Alcohol 120% 


Click on 'Image finder' 


Alcohol will then find the the 3 reason iso's from your reason folder 


Now right click on each one and select 'add selected files to alcohol 120%' 


when all three are added just click on the 1st and away it goes .... when it askes for the 2nd disc just click on it in alcohol 120% and off it goes again ...same with the 3rd 


then its serial number time ... then just click on the 3.04 update in the disc 1 folder and that goes to work :) 



Now i just have to work out how to use the f....kin thing :O)"
,Deezo_m1,2007-05-14T14:15Z,"when the image finder found the iso's did you right click them and 'add selected files to alcohol 120%'?

when you do that they appear in your main alcohol screen .... now they are labelled disk 1 disk 2 and disk 3 so just click on them in order when it asks for the cds"
,Bamse_young,2007-05-27T13:52Z,"Can't I just burn all of them on one DVD or must it be three different cd:s 700mb each?
If it goes fine with a dvd disk how do I do then. I'm also stuck at the files on the main screen.
But if I right click them I can burn them one at the time."
,joejamin121,2007-05-27T21:03Z,how do you get thorugh the bit where it asks you for a licence?
,yentertainment,2007-06-10T17:47Z,"The Reason program can't detect the Orkester CD. i might be missing a file. on the Orkester CD theres: Autorun, Orkester.rfl, and Reason30osb. Am i missin any files??"
,yentertainment,2007-06-20T17:00Z,"The Winrar file is the actualy ISO file that you need to mount or burn, for those who have problems with that, don't unpack it and burn the contents onto a cd, that won't work.  anyways, I lost my reason key, can anyone help me out?"

,NaXxOr,2007-08-19T19:19Z,"@ ChazLongfella:

Step 1: Download and install DemonTools, if you dont have it. (or any other imageApp)

Step 2: Then when you get ""waiting for CD"" popup,  left-click on the DemonTools icon in you systray.(right_down_corner)

Step 3: Click on the ""no Media"" button and select your Reason 3.0 CD 2 image file. (its in your reason folder)

Step 4: Now Reason gonne install (Copy) the first soundbank... when its done you need to do it again (Step 3 that is), this time with the Reason 3.0 CD 3 image file thuoo.

Peace !"

,Xzontar,2008-03-31T21:14Z,"Thanks for this. Works great.

To anyone curious, it asks for the SERIAL (refered to as ""license-key"") after the program starts and loads the sound banks. If you installed the 3.0.4 version after the 3.0 version, then the two serials will not work. Go to the folder where you clicked the 3.0.4 installer and there should be another serial number in a .txt file which works."

,NiGHTSx2,2008-05-21T06:58Z,"For anyone having trouble installing this program, I found it easiest to use Alcohol 120% (DL it here or just grab the trial version).  You won't need to burn any CDs this way, and it's quite simple with these instructiong.  Here's the step by step:

1.  Open Alcohol 120%
2.  Click ""Image Finder""
3.  A new search window will open.  Navigate to the folder that contains the 3 Reason ISO files and confirm.
4.  Image Finder should locate 3 Reason ISO files; Right-click on each of them and select ""Add selected files to Alcohol 120%"" (or just hit the Insert key).
5.  You can close the Image Finder window now and return to the main Alcohol window.
6.  OK, here's the trick to get this thing to work.  On the left menu bar click on ""Options - Virtual Drives.""  By default, Alcohol sets the number of Virtual Drives to zero.  Change the number to 1.
7.  Back in the main Alcohol window, Double-click on Reason file #1.  The installer should launch and begin installing the program.
8.  Eventually, the installer will ask for the ""Orkester Sound Bank"" disc (aka Disc #2).  Go back to Alcohol and Double-Click Reason File #2.
9.  When the installer asks for ""Factory Sound Bank, return to Alcohol and Double-click on Reason File #3.
10.  When prompted, enter a valid CD key, and Reason 3.0 is installed.
11.  Quit Alcohol.
12.  Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Reason ISO files.  Open the ""Reason 3.0 CD 1"" folder, and then the ""Reason 3.04 Update"" sub-folder.
13.  Double click the ""Install Reason"" application, and you're updated and ready to rock.

Hope that helps anyone having issues."

Back to the ""screwing up"" part... i used Virtual CloneDrive for the ISOs and it worked absolutely perfect... Virtual CloneDrive is complete freeware from SlySoft.. google it. It installed without a hitch, after i put in a serial, i went back and updated via the folder update, and it worked like it should.

like the gentleman said earlier, it worked, now i just have to figure out how to use it!!!

check this out.. when you're playing with the buttons and stuff... hit TAB.. it flips you around to the back of the rack... WIRES!! and you can move them around!!"
