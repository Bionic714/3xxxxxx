,biggjoe,2007-04-25T04:08Z,Chinese?  It must be Japanese dude!
,tribosi,2008-04-02T22:14Z,lol Chinese.  lol old.  Classic is a better description.  Japanese you bet.  It is such a classic that it influenced American and European cinema for decades.  I am still laughing that it was described as old Chinese lol.  It is like describing the Homeric  classic Iliad as a bunch of Roman dudes in togas with a wooden pony.
,D0gmeat,2008-06-27T00:32Z,By chance the uploader was referring to the moving being dubbed in Chinese...?
,LezDawson,2008-11-21T22:55Z,"What a fuckwit.  Even after the comments, he still hasn't edited his post to correct it to 'Japanese'.  What kind of ignoramus describes this classic as 'must be seen' and yet still thinks it is Chinese?  Even the word 'Samurai' in the title didn't give it away.
Fucking ignorant twat!"
,LezDawson,2008-11-21T22:57Z,"Just look at this dick head's other posts, and wonder no more at his description of this as 'Old Chinese Movie'.  What a schlong."
