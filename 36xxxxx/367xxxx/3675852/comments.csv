,KamenRyuki,2008-05-10T17:05Z,"Downloaded game, recorded a CD, but when I was playing in my dreamcast, the hero team, after the City Escape, the Boss, the game gives error"
,orcishlad,2008-05-20T11:55Z,"Downloaded and unzipped, burned to CD, popped into Dreamcast and won't load with either Utopia or the autoboot that came with it... It recognizes it as a  music disc, not a game disc."
,orcishlad,2008-05-20T12:24Z,"Alright, got it to work. My Dreamcast will randomly recognize it as either a music or a game disc; I just kept resetting my Dreamcast until it loaded the game properly."
,microape,2008-06-23T17:10Z,"I've allready burned this game twice, but it won't boot! Isn't this game autoboot anyway? Am I supposed to burn the .cdi file only, an none of the other files? There are two other files in the folder as well."

[Checked with HashCheck Shell Extension, Confirmed individually with 7-zip]

I use µTorrent, and i trust the built in hash-checking, yet other users seem to have successfully extracted.

Any help is appreciated."
,g0d,2009-10-05T04:51Z,"Sorry to double comment, but also tried joining files using FFSJ (Fastest File Splitter and Joiner) to one large 7-zip archive and then extracting withe exact same results/error messages."
,g0d,2009-10-05T05:31Z,"Followup: After deleting offending files, and doing a Recheck, Force Start... the files are fine now...
not quite sure as to cause of problem, as I have always had confidence in µTorrent's hashing capability, and never had a problem like this. 
Maybe this will support the people who still post torrents of split archives... if it hadn't had been arked i would have had to spend extra time dl'ing 600MB again, as it stands, only had to wait a short while to dl 28MB.
Has anyone else ever had an issue with µTorrent concerning file verification/hashing?"
,ivansego,2010-05-20T20:48Z,"I havn't downloaded mine yet, it's still uTorrenting away, but i see it was in loads of chapters and a few people struggling to extract it

Most situations like this with DvD's etc.. you just extract the first one, and it auto extracts the rest

hope this helps you... and me :O"
,ivansego,2010-05-20T21:08Z,"Right, cool.. 

I downloaded, and winRAR does NOT work, but if you search google for a program called HJSplit, (it's just .exe so you don't need to install it)

then target the input at the .001 file

then it'll join all of them together inside a WinRAR folder, lol.... so then you have to extract them AGAIN... into a .cdi file :D

Good luck"
,brandonb00zed,2010-06-19T23:20Z,how do you access the internet in Sonic to download  stuff?
,Haroids,2010-07-06T19:31Z,"Hm, what on earth did I download? xD
This isn't a .rar file.
There's nothing to extract.
There's no iso.
All I got was a random file containing tons of a random files.
Could it be the torrent program I was using?"
,Haroids,2010-07-06T19:32Z,Wow Ivansego! Why didn't I read your comment before I deleted the file?! ROFL!!!!!
,profhardcore,2010-08-12T21:16Z,Thanks onespiece. Out of all the methods here yours is the one that worked for me.
,MrMclainy,2011-02-28T01:55Z,"Download a freeware program called ""HJSplit"" (I've used it for years, works fine), use it to join the "".001, etc."" files, burn the "".cdi"" it makes to a CD-R with Alcohol 120% or DiscJuggler, pop into your Dreamcast and play!"
,un4gvn_1,2012-03-25T14:29Z,"I will continue to seed this everyday after work, I would appreciate not being the only one."
