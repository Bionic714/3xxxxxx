F.M. Einheit - Sensation Death (1997) @ 320 kbps

Re-seed. Difficult to describe this music. It's a kind of electronic/synthesizer music for a kind of ballet. Does remind me of old German electronic sounds (i.e. Kraftwerk, DAF, Klaus Schulze).

Hope the files stay healthy this time.

Download, listen, seed, and if you like it, purchase the original. These bands are worth it (IMHO).

Enjoy & seed!
