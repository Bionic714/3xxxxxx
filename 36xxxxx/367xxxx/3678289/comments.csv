,dilligaf?,2007-08-11T01:37Z,"""We Care A Lot""   was not sung by Mike Patton.   It was actually done by a guy with no singing voice at all - Chuck Mosley.    Even tho the dude had a shocker of a voice, he did make it big enough to earn himself a Wiki page... here's part of it...
Chuck Mosley is an American singer and songwriter and a pioneer of the music genre commonly referred to as rapcore. Mosley was the original front-man of the ground-breaking and highly influential band Faith No More. He was featured on their debut album We Care a Lot and on their second, Introduce Yourself.

Mosley was born in Hollywood, CA, but raised in South Central Los Angeles and Venice. He joined Faith No More in 1985 replacing Courtney Love (Hole) as lead singer.

Chuck parted ways with FNM in 1988 for a number of reasons, including creative differences with his band members and rumors of substance abuse.



Anyhow, chuck could sing (and hold a syringe) just as good as Courtney so he got ditched too, leaving the way for Mike Patton who came in for the release of The Real Thing."
