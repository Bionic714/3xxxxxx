Synopsis: Set in 1951, the film begins as film director Wilson (Eastwood) summons an old friend, writer Pete Verrill (Jeff Fahey), to recruit him for his latest project about a hard-drinking boat captain and a schoolmarm who take on the German navy in Africa during WWII. All Wilson really cares about is that the film will give him a fast infusion of cash to put a dent in personal debts totaling a quarter of a million dollars. Even more important, it will provide him with an all-expenses-paid opportunity to fulfill his longtime dream of going big-game hunting.
