,logruszed,2007-04-27T19:14Z,"Q: Why upload a torrent to a torrent?

Ans: Makes it harder to track those who fileshare.

Many of the BT trackers issuing DMCA type complaints are going for those who are sharing a file, and most of it is fairly automated. 

Doing it this way gives you a layer of protection.

I just wish someone would upload Entorage, and Battlestar this way. I have been hit with two DMCA violations and can no longer grab TV shows because I'm being monitored.

No one seems to care about games or comics here."
