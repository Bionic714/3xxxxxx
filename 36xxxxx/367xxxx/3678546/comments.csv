,xxxx4,2007-05-12T23:16Z,"I can see why people become fustrated using torrents when they are the only seeder and no one else takes any responsibility to help.  ""Leecher"" is an apt term.

I beg others to help seed this, because I'm only going to do it for so long."

,lacus_odii,2007-11-28T02:38Z,"I presume that the files came from the PAL DVD. I will try to seed as long as I can, but I'm on a laptop ;-)"
,lacus_odii,2007-11-29T05:17Z,"These are from videotape recordings off of what looks like satellite or digital cable. It has video tracking warbles and at some points the cable signal mosaics. The video/audio quality is correspondingly not very high, but it is tolerable. I don't want to complain too much because someone did good work recording and converting this.

It should be noted that the series is presented as fact when it is very arguable whether it is correct at all. Watch, learn, but do not accept uncritically..."

,bazquux,2011-08-29T23:46Z,"Curtis has a lot to answer:
""Ask him why he has failed to respond to the articles and letters that have been sent to him. Ask him why The Century of the Self gave so much detailed attention to Guatemalan history, and yet failed to mention U.S. responsibility for the 150,000 civilians killed as a result of its assault on Guatemala. Ask why the series focused on this isolated U.S. intervention without mentioning that it was a small part of similar interventions elsewhere in Latin America and in the Third World generally. Is this wider pattern not central to understanding the real significance, and costs, of corporate control of domestic and foreign societies in the 20th and 21st centuries?""
