- Release Notes
* yes I'm not joking, this is the full 59.94 progressive
fps that the show is aired in. 29.97fps interlaced 
video when played on the tv deinterlaced gives 
59.94fps (each unique field as a frame) 
http://100fps.com
* if you don't believe me then check out video frame 
by frame, but note that the opening scene is 
telecined but check out the monologue and other stuff.
* compatible on interlaced TV's because the output
device will interlace it and still give the full 
60fps motion look. compare to 29.97fps scene release and
its quite a difference motion wise.
