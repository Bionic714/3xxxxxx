Note: The first episode, The Shakespeare Code, screen size is smaller than the standard size and is due to the original file that I got. I've downloaded others and was not able to fix it. There is also one flaw also in the file that when I tried to fix it caused the audio to become out of sync and the image slightly fuzzy. The flaw is a single pixeled line that last for about 1 sec late in the episode. The other episodes seem fine but I don't have immediate access to a big plasma tv so can't tell you how well they will look on a hdtv. I just know if they look decent on my 54" rear projection they look even better on my other family's 60" plasma.

Enjoy
