,fringe_lunatic,2008-07-11T03:13Z,Seeders--please! There are 2 of us at 99.1% for Disc 2. That's 20 pieces! Seeders needed for disc 4 & 5 also. Please seed if you've got this disk/set!
,fringe_lunatic,2008-07-19T01:58Z,"If anyone saw my previous and helped out--Thanks. 1&2 are now being seeded. But still need help with 3, 4, and 5! There is no one seeding 4 and 3 & 5 have 1 ea (very slow seeders) --TIA"

,drronin112,2009-01-15T06:17Z,"Looks like Seasons 2 & 3 Have no Seeders anymore. Which is a Shame because I love the Season 4 with Menus I got from Blacknoon. 
I did get an average of 20 Some MB on the Season 2 and 3 Downloads From Blacknoon here (The ones that downloaded any at all), then they all just kinda stopped.  And I notice Season 2 disk 2 both have comments that their not being seeded anymore.  Makes me a Sad Panda, Blacknoon does great work."
