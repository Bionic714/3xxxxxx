A.'. A.'. The Complete System
This has all the guidelines & books for your own personal spiritual development of self inituation into the order formed by Aleister Crowley


A.'. A.'. also known as Argentinum Astrum[citation needed], Argentinium Astrum[citation needed] (Latin for "silver star"), Astron Argon[citation needed] (Greek for "shining star") (According to the Thelema Website[citation needed], A?A? stands for Arcanum Arcanorum; Latin for "Secret of Secrets" or "Mystery of Mysteries"), is a magical order created by Aleister Crowley in 1907 after leaving the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.[1] The organization also appears in the series of novels of Robert Anton Wilson, with the portrayal in the Masks of the Illuminati containing one of the finest fictional accounts of someone utilizing the A?A? curriculum.[citation needed]

It is a Thelemic magical fraternity, the goals of which are the pursuit of light and knowledge. Heavily influenced by Aleister Crowley, the holy book of the order is Liber AL vel Legis (in English, The Book of the Law). Its mottos are "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," and "Love is the law, love under will." (The A?A? shares these mottos with the O.T.O.. While the A?A? was not part of the O.T.O., the O.T.O. did consider A?A? to be a close ally.[2])

Various lineages of the A?A? claim to survive today that can be traced back to the founders Aleister Crowley and George Cecil Jones. One such lineage is that founded by actress Jane Wolfe (known as Soror Estai). Other lineages run through pupils of Marcelo Ramos Motta, a student of Karl Germer, who studied under Aleister Crowley. The secrecy, however, makes it difficult to say that any particular lineage is the true descendant of the original society.

Good luck and 93/93
