,jameshall,2007-08-24T13:51Z,"Hmmm, I know this is kind of late but I wonder what happened to disc 1B? Is this intentional or is anything missing here? If there is a disc 1B missing I'd very much would like to get that too in order to have a complete collection."
,Cyberpro60,2007-09-11T05:32Z,"This is an extremely dubious collection that probably has little if any connection with Time Life. I say this because Time Life simply wouldn't release a botched up set like this with many incorrectly labelled tracks, completely duplicated pieces, totally missing movements, etc etc.

More than likely this is a compilation from a total idiot who knows little about classical music and even less about producing properly documented disc information for download. Where is the cover art/album track list?

All in all - download this only if you are truly desperate and don't give a damn about the names of the pieces you are listening to!"
