Otherwise, we swedes understand english very good but have a tendency to even thou want swedish subs. Why? Who cares? Germans dub every damn film.

Surely it is a ugly language, but I am still more proud of beeing Swedish than beeing American (I am both). We have nordic pride, not american fat-culture patriotic acts with a tiny president."
