,mrpink6,2007-07-03T13:19Z,Warning: This has a big timecode burned into the image for the whole film.
,screff,2007-10-01T05:38Z,how do I get both sound and video to play at the same time?
,smiledskateboarding,2008-03-16T02:06Z,for all electronica lovers check this out ! http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4082618/(electronica_musik_Hermany_-_electronica_soundz
,leon938,2008-05-25T00:47Z,get the right codec
,ceilingtracer,2008-06-12T23:49Z,no offense to the uploader but it sucks that this is the only copy with a good number of seeds.  the timecode is ridiculous. 
,wesgizmo365,2008-06-25T08:20Z,what the fuck i can't hear any sound... and im pretty sure Daft Punk wouldnt make a movie without sound.i installed a decoder thing but i cant figure out how to use it because it wont let me.
,spartan777,2009-04-07T07:28Z,"from 45 to 46 in the movie, im pretty sure its zooming in from the feet to the vagina of what appears to be a woman lying down. i thought that, then I saw the bushy, hairlike thing growing at where the crotch would be. am I the only one who saw that?"
,Tosca12,2009-04-29T03:29Z,How do you get sound to work on a mac?
,tjpett,2009-06-05T07:15Z,The timecode is supposed to be in the movie.
,matbonucci,2010-04-13T02:05Z,no way... there are some horrible timing for editing in the video
,goatpants,2011-01-08T03:14Z,"@mrpink6 

The timecode at the top of the screen is part of the movie. :)"
,gyaradon,2011-11-28T07:29Z,"The Blu-ray rip, available on other torrent sites, most certainly does not have a burned-in timecode."
,lespaul166,2011-12-23T03:27Z,"@spartan: you are absolutely right. the producer put it in as an artistic touch. 

@all: the timecode is part of the movie, another artistic touch. this isnt really a movie, more of an artistic venture."
