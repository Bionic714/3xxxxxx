Walter Matthau was in another movie around the same time in which he played a cia agent trying to retire, or something like that, its been years since I've seen it so I don't remember the details... anyone got any clue?"
,crookedtree,2007-10-03T09:51Z,BTW I have to say a big thanks to the uploader mike18xx for this flick.. Its nice to find some classics
,mike18xx,2007-12-19T07:41Z,"Crooked, you're probably thinking of ""Charley Varrick"" (he's not an agent, but a bank-robber trying to retire)."
,crookedtree,2008-02-02T14:54Z,"Wow!, Thanks a lot Mike! I'm gonna go look for that right now."
,schaffner,2008-08-09T00:12Z,"The movie with Walter Matthau as the CIA agent who wants to quit is called ""Hopscotch""."
,TonyBear,2009-04-30T21:51Z,"I already own the DVD version, but I have to comment on this quailty classic. 

There is a new one coming out with Denzel Washington and John Travolta. The trailers look ok - there is another done in Canada. No offense to the Canadians but that version SUCKED. 

*THIS* version is the best - close to the book and is one of the best NYC classics out there, bar none. 

If you've never seen it, I'm telling you know, DOWNLOAD this Matthau gem!"

This & ""GoodFellas"" are the 2 best NYC movies ever made.
