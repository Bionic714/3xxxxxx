This is a unique torrent for all Keane lovers.
This EP was released as "Wolf At The Door", and was basically a promo - production of these was limited as each one had to be made by hand - with CDRs. If you pull the covers the right way, the front and back outer slips line up to say "keane". Click here for a picture of this. 
The version of Call Me What You Like is different to that on the Call Me What You Like single (which is much slower); and She Has No Time is a different recording to that found on the Hopes and Fears album.
