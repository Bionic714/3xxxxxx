[T],HDTV CHINA,2007-05-07T23:43Z,"only one way,change your computer.
Recommended: INTEL Core2 DUO or AMD X2 4800+ and NVIDIA 8500GT"
,oswald1234,2007-05-12T12:10Z,core2 duo (AT LEAST 2.4) and a freeking fast video card. Throw in  at least a gig  of memory. I have a 8800 gts and 3 gigs of memory and a lot of these releases dont work. Not recommened=  mandatory-srry
,hurrafor,2007-05-19T11:32Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

,Hybrid R600,2008-05-11T17:43Z,"Looks really good :)

You can also play it with KMplayer..."
