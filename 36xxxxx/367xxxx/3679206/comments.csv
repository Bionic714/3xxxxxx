,Autobogg,2010-01-11T23:27Z,"It's a Filmation company series from 1979. The 1980 movie with Max Von Sydow is heavily based on its visual style. Filmation animated over live actors (rotoscoping). Same as ""Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle"" from 1976 and ""He-Man and The Masters of The Universe"" from 1983. You can even see the same MoirĂŠ pattern effect (that weird orange glowing moving background) in the show. Very realistic looking for the time. No CGI whatsoever! They also did both animated and live action shows and combos like ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids""."
