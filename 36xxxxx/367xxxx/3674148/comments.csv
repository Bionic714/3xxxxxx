,bell0q,2007-04-29T21:07Z,"It's been seeding since it was posted and has been seeding all day long when you posted here. I've personally seeded 4GB so far and we're close to having multiple seeds some time today based on curent speed. 

I hope you can get it started."

,thribbone,2008-03-28T08:51Z,The interlaced format of this download makes the quality rather poor when compared with other 1080p downloads... but thanks for the upload none the less.
,thribbone,2008-03-28T08:55Z,"...and in answer to the question asked by atarilover, I use FFDShow and Haali Media Splitter for playing back HD content (works a treat). You can download these for free using the following links: http://www.free-codecs.com/download/FFDShow.htm

Oh and MKV format kicks ass. Hell, I never had problems with it when I wasn't even using dual core CPU."

I know I'm kinda late on downloading this torrent, but please, everyone; seed! I'll be seeding this as much as I possibly can."
