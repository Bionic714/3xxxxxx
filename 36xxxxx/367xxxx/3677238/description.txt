Info
----
 THE FUTURE OF FOOD offers an in-depth investigation into the 
disturbing truth behind the unlabeled, patented, genetically engineered 
foods that have quietly filled U.S. grocery store shelves for the past decade.

From the prairies of Saskatchewan, Canada to the fields of Oaxaca, Mexico, 
this film gives a voice to farmers whose lives and livelihoods have been 
negatively impacted by this new technology. The health implications, government 
policies and push towards globalization are all part of the reason why many 
people are alarmed by the introduction of genetically altered crops into our 
food supply.

Shot on location in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, THE FUTURE OF FOOD examines 
the complex web of market and political forces that are changing what we eat as 
huge multinational corporations seek to control the world's food system. The film 
also explores alternatives to large-scale industrial agriculture, placing organic 
and sustainable agriculture as real solutions to the farm crisis today.
