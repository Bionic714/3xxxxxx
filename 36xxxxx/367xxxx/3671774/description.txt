Coffee is the world's most widely taken legal drug. It is the second most traded legal commodity on Earth, and provides a livelihood for over 25 million people; 100 million more depend on it for survival! This three hour documentary traces the unique and volatile history of coffee. From its discovery on an ancient Ethiopian hillside to its role as a contemporary elixir, coffee has dominated and moulded the economies, politics and social structures of entire countries.

Part 1: 'The Irresistible Bean' carries us back to coffee's origins in Ethiopia and its triumphant spread over five continents, sparking revolution, controversy, creativity, business and slavery all along the way.

Part 2: 'Gold in Your Cup' uses an elegant contemporary competition to elevate the quantity of coffee in Brazil to frame a portrait of 19th century coffee-fueled oppression in Latin America.

Part 3: 'The Perfect Cup' heralds what some coffee experts have called 'the romantic age of coffee'. North-Americas re-discover what their European counterparts have known all along- that coffee is better when it's quality coffee, and the best place to find it is in the relaxed and friendly atmosphere of a cafe.
