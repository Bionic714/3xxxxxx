These are six tracks from Tim Armstrong's (Rancid) new solo album A Poet's Life. He made these tracks freely available from different sites on the internet as a thank you for fans, however, they are hard to find and only the newest are still up, so here's the 6 that have been released so far. I believe the full album will be out by the very end of May.

Hold On
Wake Up
Into Action
Take This City
Inner City Violence
Lady Dementer
