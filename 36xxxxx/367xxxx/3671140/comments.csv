,Sunduc,2007-12-14T11:07Z,"I am both happy and sad to see a Happy Rhodes-torrent here. Happy, because that might contribute to making this seriously underrated artist better known. (and truly: she is seriously, seriously underrated) Sad, because she is one of those artists who need to work another job to make an income ... so whether she produces another album or not is up to us, up to whether we buy her albums or not.

So ... if you downloaded this and liked it, or if you went to last.fm and heard her and wished for more -- buy!
