Call of Duty (released October 29, 2003) is a first-person shooter video game based on the Quake III engine. This war game simulates the infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II. The game was published by Activision and developed by Infinity Ward.

In September 2004 an expansion pack to Call of Duty was released titled Call of Duty: United Offensive. It was produced by Activision, and developed by Gray Matter Interactive, with contributions from Pi Studios. The Mac OS X version was ported by Aspyr Media, Inc. In Late 2004, the N-Gage version was developed by Nokia and published by Activision. Other versions were released for PC, including Collector's Edition (with soundtrack and strategy guide), Game of the Year Edition (includes game updates), and the Deluxe Edition (which contains United Offensive expansion and soundtrack in the USA. However, in Europe the soundtrack is not included).

A sequel, Call of Duty 2, was developed by Infinity Ward and was released in October 2005. There are also Call of Duty games developed for consoles, but with separate storylines, such as Call of Duty: Finest Hour by Spark Unlimited and Call of Duty 2: Big Red One by Gray Matter Interactive and Treyarch. The third installment, Call of Duty 3, was released in November 2006 exclusively for consoles and developed by Treyarch instead of Infinity Ward. The fourth installment, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is the only one in the series to not be set in WWII and is slated to be released in the Fall of 2007.
