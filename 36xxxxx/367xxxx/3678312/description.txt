This paper discusses the costs and benefits of drug prohibition. It offers a
detailed outline of the economic consequences of drug prohibition and a systematic
analysis of the relevant empirical evidence. The bottom line is that a relatively free market in drugs is likely to be vastly superior to the current policy of prohibition.
