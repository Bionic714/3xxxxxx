Closed was formed in early 2005. We immediately started to mold and hammer a musical style into shape. And Soon to be crafted was what we call Grungecore, a "punch-in-your-face" mix of Metal, Hardcore and Grunge. Currently Closed has released two demos. First one is Unwanted/Ungifted, second one is Soleniod Serum. Both recorded year 2006. With high goals and the drive to achieve them there's no limit to what we can accomplish, and we plan on proving that!
