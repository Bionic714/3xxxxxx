,XwrisOnoma,2011-04-28T20:00Z,"Thanks for the upload, excellent movie.

Anyone has a good subtitle file for this version? I am not from Australia or New Zealand and I have a really hard time to understand the dialogs (it's mostly ANZAC military jargon and slang from that period).

There are some 2-CD and 3-CD .srt files floating around the Internet but I have been unable to successfully join and sync any of them, with this torrent.

Your help will be much appreciated.

Thank you!"
