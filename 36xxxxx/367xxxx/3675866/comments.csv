,mogore,2007-11-07T21:19Z,i've downloaded the game now how can i make it work?:)
,BulakVol21,2007-11-10T17:24Z,"since this is a dreamcast rom, you will need a DC emulator."
,billvp,2008-01-24T03:58Z,cd2 doesnt work for me either
,billvp,2008-01-24T23:33Z,"never mind, cd2 works ... unlike cd1 however, you cd2 does not self boot -- you need to get a boot disc from http://segahub.org/smf/index.php?topic=136.0 (burn it)

You should save the game at the end of disc1 when it asks you to, then when you are ready to play disc2, put the boot disc in, then when it says to insert the non-bootable disc in (which is disc2), do so -- disc2 then works (you'll have to do the 2-step process every time you start the game).  Then just like resuming any time, select load game, and your saved spot ... and it works"
