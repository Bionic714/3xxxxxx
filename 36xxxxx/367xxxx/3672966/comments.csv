,RunerBoy,2007-04-27T20:11Z,"I'm new in handling these kind of files, so just some questions if anyone could help me: Torrent size is 4.45 GiB, there are 95x50mb rar files at 4.75 GiB total not unpacked, and image size is said to be 4.36 GiB...? Do I unpack the 95x50mb files before I burn them, and just make a data disk with Nero? Sorry for noob question.. ;-)"

,123Enjoy321,2007-05-03T12:30Z,"@staf

4,45 GB * 84 = 373,8 GB

For me it look kinda impossible for you, to upload 1000 GB? :) Or is i just me?"
,Dr.Pepper,2007-05-03T16:32Z,For faen! Er videoen komprimert?
,staf,2007-05-04T11:37Z,123Enjoy321: The download stats are hopelessly incorrect. This torrent has been downloaded several thousands of times.
,drimor,2007-05-06T09:24Z,"Runerboy: Yes you unpack then there is .iso, or video_ts or something those u burn. You can still unpack .iso if u want, or just burn .iso to DVD, DVD decrypter is nice for burning .iso, atleast my nero cant burn em."
