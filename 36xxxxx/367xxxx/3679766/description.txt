Keith Jarett has written and performed for quite a number of different formats.
Large scale solo improvisation, short precise piano gems, music for his American
Quartet and his Scandinavian Quartet, Trio music, Symphonic works and Duo work
with Jack Dejohnette etc... On Luminesscence, one of a number of must recordings
of his, Jarrett writes parts for Mladen Gutesha and the Strings of the Sudfunk
Symphony Orchestra, Stuttgart. Jan Garbarek improvises to these string parts.
The result, sweeping , contrasting strings with Garbarek's searing and sometimes
bittersweet tenor and soprano playing is very special, very emotional music
making. A must for anyone interested in Jarrett, in Garbarek, or in modern music
making. If you like this you may also want to pick up Jarrett's In the Cave in
the Light and Arbour Zena.
