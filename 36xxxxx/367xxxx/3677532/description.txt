During the 1970s and early 1980s, the National Film Board (of Canada) produced a series of vignettes, some of which aired on CBC during commercial breaks. The vignettes became popular because of their cultural depiction of Canada, and because they represented its changing state. Indeed, the vignette Faces was made to represent the increasing cultural and ethnic diversity of Canada.

The films are split into their respective compilation reels.
