,b9AcE,2007-05-03T08:07Z,"For a moment there I was actually thinking this was ""Adobe Creative Suite 3 Production Premium"".
You know, the new generation...
But considering the versions listed it's obviously not."

Because CS3 versions of After Effects, Premeire, Encore is NOT NOT NOT here yet.  

Adobe will release those in late June/early July.  Until then, this is STILL the latest stuff from Adobe.  If you go to Amazon or Adobe, they will let you PRE-order the CS3 versions of these apps -- but they have not even finished them yet.

Adobe has released CS3 versions of Photoshop, Acrobat, DreamWeaver, Flash, etc.  Maybe that's what you are thinking of.  "

After Effects CS3 Professional Preview Limitations
This preview version does not include the ability to encode the following video and audio formats:
MPEG-2, HDV, H.264, Dolby, MP3, MP3 Pro, and AAC/AAC+. In addition, you will not be able to import most non-QuickTime MPEG compressed files.
Bundled third-party effects (Synthetic Aperture Keylight, Cycore Effects, and The Foundry Color Finesse) are not included in the preview.
The project file format of the preview is not compatible with previous versions of After Effects. Projects created in or saved from the After Effects CS3 preview will open in the final release version
of After Effects CS3 Professional.

Are these limitation in this software?"
,4everWhatever,2007-05-30T03:17Z,"Hi:

""Are these limitation in this software?""

This torrent is supposed to contain the CS2 full commercial product, not CS3 ""preview"" or trials."

,tallblondblueeyed,2007-07-10T00:04Z,"Hi!
Does someone know how to get Encore CS3?

hope someone can help me... ;-)"
,jtoolman,2007-07-22T04:11Z,You CAN'T just get Encore alone. It is now integrated with Premiere CS3
,tallblondblueeyed,2007-07-28T18:41Z,"jtoolman!
I have only Premiere CS 3 installed, not the entire collection. 
The following text is copied from help files in Premiere CS3:
QUOTE: Export to Encore or to an MPEG file:
The File > Export > Export To Encore command brings your sequence, or any portion of it you designate with the work area bar, into Encore. From Encore, you can burn it directly to a DVD without menus, or add menus and buttons before burning. You can burn the project to disc, or you can save it to a DVD image file, a set of DVD folders, or DVD master files on DLT tape.

Alternately, you can export a DVD-compliant MPEG-2 file from Adobe Premiere Pro that you can use to author a DVD in most DVD-authoring applications.
END QUOTE

This indicates that Encore still is a stand alone application!!!! 
It is this one I would like to get..."

,KMarch,2008-04-16T15:44Z,"For those who have Licence expired I have of two fixes that can fix your adode without unistalling or adding patches

SERIOUSLY NO UN-INSTALLED NEEDED! NO CRACKS NEEDED! READ CAREFULLY!!! andenjoy!! because I am so great!

FIRST FIX!! (TRY THIS FIRST)

(Tested on XP - Vista should be same!!)

Run Control panel
Run Administation Tools
Run Services

CLICK - FLEXnet Licencing Service

NOW! - set to MANUAL and click START!!!


Your adobe is now FIXED!

If not! dont worry heres the second fix!!!


FIX NUMBER TWO!!!

If your product took a bad key and you need to enter a NEW Key then you MUST delete every key (sorry but it the only way)

Click Start and RUN!

Type this

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache\


DELETE! cache.db or back it up (no good if its expired your products)

Start photoshop or any adobe product 

TA-DA enter your key again (This time a better one) 

If you got lots of adobe products and a key works back upup your cache.db in case you enter bad one



ENJOY!!!!!!!!"
