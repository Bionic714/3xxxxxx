,figmang,2007-05-03T02:15Z,can anyone help me get this to play? It asks me to insert disc...
,RolfDaShiznit,2007-05-03T08:40Z,"It shouldn't be any problems, since i can just install and then run it...... If it ain't working you will maybe (Notice the """"MAYBE"""") need a crack.
You can search for it on www.gameburnworld.com"
,Mountainmaxx,2007-05-03T14:58Z,"Åh, tack, jag är hyfsat ny på detta, och är osäker på om man får skriva på svenska, om detta inte är tillåtet ber jag om ursäkt..

hursomhellst.. TACK som F-N för denna torrent.. Har spelat och i princip klarat ut detta spel flertalet ggr.. Spelet försvann i flytten för några år sedan och nu håller jag på att bli tokig, sitter på nätet och spelar flash-versoner utav detta underbara spel och nu ska jag få spela the real deal.. tack RolfDaShiznit"
,KlartSomKorvspa,2007-05-05T22:15Z,"I have a very good question wich no one has answered yet..

When you scroll in-game your scroll-rate is still superfast even if you have set it to ""very slow"".

This destroys all the fun playing this game, anyone has a cure for this?"
,RolfDaShiznit,2007-05-05T23:41Z,"Well... tht has troubled me a lot to, have spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to turn the scrolling speed down... Well, my friend has got the game to and his scrolling speed is perfectly normal, on my old comp, the scrolling speed is normal there to. I think it maybe has something to do with what comp your using... (or not)
Just guessing, since that is the only thing i can think of..."
,snakeballs,2007-06-14T13:49Z,has to do with v-sync active or not on your graphic card i would think. if it is deactivated the fps can go up way over 60 and thats why your scroll speed is suuper fast
,pigdestroyer,2007-07-12T09:55Z,"thanks a lot!
seeds if possible. 

this should be very fun."
,Hyper_Trance,2007-11-11T12:24Z,"I wouldn't recommend downloading this.

1) You need a crack in order to play the game. 
Easy to download yes, but I think a crack should at least be included.

2) No movies. (I love the movies).

3) No music, which I think is really bad.

4) No voices at the beginning of each level that tells you about the story, etc.

5) First the game was running well, but now it's started to lag and the sound is very, very weird.

I've tried running the game using DosBox, the music then worked and the lag was gone. But the game wanted the CD, so it didn't matter since I couldn't play it."
,RolfDaShiznit,2008-01-28T13:17Z,"Well..

1. You don't need a crack.
2. There will be a whole lot of problems if you got a new or kinda new computer. This game runs best on an old computer using Windows 95/98.

The point is that it at least works..
The music, movies and the voices worked on my old comp back in 98... but ever since i haven't been able to play it without problems..

My advice..
Get an old computer :D At least i'm going to."
,SPAMLORD,2008-03-06T11:09Z,"please seed!, love this game,"
,SparkManFFS,2008-03-10T10:03Z,I love this game. Remember how me and my brother always played against eachother in lan :D
,kburts,2008-03-25T04:35Z,will it work on a 486 Windows 3.11 machine??
,Illian9,2008-04-03T21:14Z,can´t get it to work (do u need to burn a cd to this game or whot?)
,Rusty_rod2000,2008-06-08T15:01Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS
it doesnt work,
simple as that"
,mrmagicstick,2008-06-09T19:06Z,det e fejk för den vill ha cd för det har du nåt svar på det?
,nerdo,2008-10-19T05:11Z,   > så ska ni se att det funkar!
,nerdo,2008-10-19T05:15Z,":edit 
Höger klicka på installfilen/spelikonen 
tryck på egenskaper 
välj kompatibilitet
välj windows 95 eller windows 98! 

PS: när du installerat spelet gör samma sak me spel ikonen!  (or just play in dos box)

funkade för mig! tack å hej."
,xovius,2008-11-29T23:19Z,Well this thing about windows 98 or 95... I'm not going to get a new computer just to play one game!!!!
,RolfDaShiznit,2008-12-17T14:24Z,"Just follow nerdo's instructions and it will probably work out :P
My version stopped working a while ago and then i tried dosbox, now it works perfectly fine..

Anyway.. I'm planning to seed a new version of this including a crack/patch including instructions for dosbox.. Until then, ppl have to figure this out on their own ^^"
,RolfDaShiznit,2008-12-17T14:26Z,"Ups, forgot that he(nerdo) wrote that in swedish XP

Anyway, he suggested that you should run the program in compability mode((Windows 95/98)) or just run the program in dosbox."
,GTMistral,2009-01-12T18:33Z,"It seems to be the original version of Warcraft 2 that has been release over a decade ago. It was designed to play in DOS mode with computer as powerful as Pentium 1 200mhz and slower... lot slower. I played this game too much on a 4-86 66mhz.

Warcraft 2 Battle.net Edition does not have the scrolling problem and you can mount the ISO file and run the game with it with all the sounds, musics and voices!"
,sotos256,2010-01-06T14:55Z,thanksssss
,shadow455,2010-01-27T01:49Z,"You need to mount it to make it work
easy as that"
