,Marxist,2007-04-27T16:28Z,"finally i have been waiting for english release of this game for years? This is The Fall in eng language if i understand correctly? Hmm , this is a fan mod or official?"
,tehtechman,2007-04-27T21:38Z,So is the the just the full game with the english patch from NMA or will it actually work?
,Marxist,2007-04-28T10:09Z,i hope its the full game in english...
,Zanzamar,2007-04-28T15:35Z,This is either the german or someother language version of the game. The English mod is fan made.. and in the torrent there are both the rars & the extracted iso file.. which means that you are downloading double of what u need..
,Mad_troll,2007-04-28T23:57Z,"You don't have to download the ISO, in most torrent-programs you can de-select the files you don't want, shouldn't be too hard to figure it out."
,zapagog,2007-05-01T16:01Z,Seed! Damn it....
,Big-Bang,2007-05-01T19:38Z,please seed for a few houres more. we are stuck at 98.5%
,Mad_troll,2007-05-01T20:21Z,Just a note to you who just started downloading. you only need the ISO or the RAR-files. You don't need both. Will save you a lot of time to only download half. And when it asks for CD 2 just click OK since there was no info in the readme about that. 
,Mad_troll,2007-05-01T20:21Z,Same goes for CD 3 ^^
,Ninja-Tå,2007-05-03T21:48Z,StarForce protection.
,Marxist,2007-05-04T15:16Z,its in english? 
,Marxist,2007-05-04T16:13Z,what about the crack?
,Marxist,2007-05-04T16:44Z,this doesnt work...
,Marxist,2007-05-05T14:26Z,"is there any tutorial on how to use the translation , the scirpts and zones are folders , not the ubn files"
,fertzel01,2007-09-23T06:39Z,"Seriously bugged. First up it tries to install Starforce. A NO-NO. Got the no-cd patch from megagames. Tried playing. Never mind which character I chose, male of female, I always get the same dude in underpants as char. Always male voice. Equipping and unequipping clothes/armor has no visible effect: underpants rule. Not. Tried to explore the first zone. No NPCs visible or find-able, bugged collision detection (got stuck behind things I wasn't behind) and listening to ""I can't find anything in this barrel"" and ""a bed, looks uncomfortable"" for nearly an hour I decided to wipe this from my harddrive. Definitely not worth the bandwidth. It stinks. Moreover the game constantly tries to call home over your internet connection. My firewall stopped that, but it's behaviour I do not like one bit. "
,tholille,2007-12-04T11:19Z,"do any1 have this on 100% ?

been on 91% for a long..... time now"
,Mereck,2007-12-18T03:09Z,Only 2.6% left... and still stuck
,tholille,2007-12-21T16:42Z,now I only have 0.3 % left.....
,elseven78,2008-01-28T03:25Z,"Just downloaded 2 versions, and they both give me the same error message when I attempt install. #1: what is ""DT4"", and #2: I get ""No such file or directory: 'install source' File 'setup_res\setup.py', line1173, in main"" ........so, any takers there??"
,shade19,2008-03-21T11:15Z,"The Fall: Last Days of Gaia ""Extended""? Is this the same thing as the ""Reloaded"", which I hear is the latest one and does not have StarForce?

Oh I dunno, I got it working, but it is sort of buggy; the game freezes now and then, and I have to exit and start it up again.
Anyways, here are some links:

And... To those who have played it for a bit; is it possible to repair vehicles, and how exactly does item combination work?"
,siresmithnj,2008-05-05T15:39Z,"Help please Line2 or anyone...
I am playing this great game, and have hit a wall. I have the listening device, and have the quest update to put it on the car of the two delivery guys by the prostitute to get into the drug lab.
But I can never find the car, I have camped outside the prostitutes area for 24 hours... constantly checking the screen and nothing.
What am I missing???
Where does the car show up???
How do I trigger the event, do I need to move to somewhere, talk to someone else?
PLEASE I beg of you, help, this is an awesome game, even now 4 years after its release. :)"
,Unfound,2008-05-28T16:12Z,"if anybody needs help what fertzel01 wrote is true, if you don´t apply the patches btw. the starforce prtoection is gone too with patch 1.10 greetz"
,Unfound,2008-05-28T16:17Z,"And siresmith^^ you get the car after you got into the Headquarter at 10:20am the 2 guys come with their jeep to have some funny hours with the old prostitute, the you install the ""cia_bug"" which you get from this guy who wants som kinda girl i think Dana was her name then you put it under the truck and if you´re shot all ratskulls you get it
P.S: Just a little hint for you there´s an old humvee on the weapon storage map where you used the C4 on that bunker. It´s situated on a little sideway in the very south of the map have fun greetz"
,shit.kicker,2008-08-23T01:45Z,"Can anyone seed for a few hours, a day tops? I've got 70% and with on seeder it should only take a few hours"
,Kigre,2008-09-28T09:45Z,"This seems to be too much of a hassle! 

Im not complaining about the upload, just me not wanting to tear my hair off thats all.

But what i really wanna complain about is: Why on earth would they not release this in an english version!??? Can anyone give me an answer to that!?? Did someone that developed the game seriously fuck up ? Did they do on purpose ? And if, WHY ??? I was to believe that game developers wanted to make money and fans all over the world... and they didnt implent an english version!!!? Just cause of that i dont wanna spend time making this game playble. Just thought i check if i could find an english bugfree playable version.

Maybe the dudes behind fallout 3 (Bethesda) didnt want them to release a game so simular to the game they were making then...
(fallout 3) so they made em not to release an english version !? Im just speculating here. 

Im waiting for Fallout 3 anyway... WICH IS IN ENGLISH !!! :) Im not wasting anymore time on this game. Allready forgotten."
