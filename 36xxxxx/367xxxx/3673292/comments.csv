,gallaghersen,2007-05-10T02:29Z,"Thanks! Gonna buy this one. This is something special. Instead of people making money off of things that shouldn't be released at all. Like Jeff Buckley's ""Sketches.."" which is awful. Let's hope they don't start a 2pac thing with Elliott. This is an album ""made"" with love. Thanks for sharing. And remember: If you dig it, buy it!"

Thank you for sharing - I, like every other Elliott fan - will buy this album as soon as I can.  Thanks for sharing!!!!!"
,mpilting,2009-03-15T22:57Z,"I'm all for sharing, but there are some things that maybe should be purchased. This album is one of them.

From wikipedia: A significant portion of the proceeds (from the sale of this album) will go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon, the city where Smith resided for a significant portion of his life.
