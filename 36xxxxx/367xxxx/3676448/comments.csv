He was and will always be remembered as a superstar an a kiddie fiddler. Wonder if Garry Glitter will get the same loving send off?

oh well read this too lol Gary Glitter has filed a lawsuit on the heels of pop star Michael Jackson's death. The lawsuit contends that the contents of Jackson's Little Black Address Book has an equal amount of names contributed by Glitter over the years.

The book supposedly contains the names of over 7,000 young boys in the LA area and was only recently discovered by a maid working for Jackson. "
