,skrjj,2009-05-31T05:34Z,"Excellent Album.

It'll probably take you forever to download, but it's worth it if you can't find the CD."
,calicojax,2011-06-05T08:23Z,howz about someone seed this please??
,S1nthet1c,2011-06-06T02:30Z,"Know anyone who has the rest of the catalog available for DL? I lost my CDs several moves ago, and I only have Burn, Baby Burn, Empathy for the Devil, Kiss the Goat, & Witness the Millenium on my HD. I'd LOVE to rebuild my collection!"
,y3n007,2011-07-02T00:45Z,"Thank yo for the upload, but I think this was their weakest album, musically was pretty simple and just kind of did not have the strength that ""Kiss the Goat"" has......I was expecting a bit more from them....."
