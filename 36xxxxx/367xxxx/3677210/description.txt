Song information 
 
The song was primarily written by Michael Jackson[citation needed] with co-writer credits 
also going to Darkchild (who produced the song), Fred Jerkins III, LaShawn Daniels and Nora 
Payne. 
A comedic spoken-intro was recorded by Chris Tucker and Jackson, which involves Tucker and 
Jackson talking about their attraction to a woman, and the two arguing about whether or not 
Jackson can \"pick her up\". 
Michael Jackson and Rodney Jerkins played all the instruments in the song, which was recorded 
at Record One studios in Los Angeles in 2001. 
There is a remix to this song that features rapper Jay-Z. 
In the UK, the song was held off number one by Kylie Minogue\'s \"Can\'t Get You out of My Head.\" 
 
Music video 
The music video for \"You Rock My World\" was premiered worldwide on September 21, 2001. 
The USA premiere was delayed until September 26 due to the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York. 
Like many of Jackson\'s music videos, this one takes the form of a short film based on a story written 
by Michael Jackson and Paul Hunter. It follows a story in which Michael Jackson and Chris Tucker 
spot an attractive woman (played by Kishaya Dudley) and follow her into a nightclub (called the 
\'Waterfront Hotel\' in reference to the famous film starring Marlon Brando, who plays the club\'s 
owner in this music video). Obviously, they are not wanted there, because it seems the woman already 
has a love interest (played by Michael Madsen). However, Jackson is determined to meet this woman. 
 
Jackson serenades the woman with a song (\"You Rock My World\"), as well as performing his famous 
dance moves. He is then challenged to a fight by one of the regulars at the club (played by Billy 
Drago). When asked by Drago to \"show me what you got,\" Jackson (backed by line dancers) pulls off 
a dance sequence choreographed by himself, Anthony \"Tone\" Talauega and Richmond Talauega. After the 
dance sequence Drago says to Jackson, \"Is that all you got? You ain\'t nothin\'\", in response to this 
Jackson punches Drago, which elevates to a fire in the building. When he evacuates the building and 
meets up with the attractive woman of his lust, the two share an intimate moment before driving away 
in Tucker\'s car. The music video also stars one of Jackson\'s confidents, Frank Tyson (who only appears 
in one shot). The music video won a NAACP Image Award for Best Music Video in 2001. There is a short 
film version and music video version of the video, with the music video version being shorter. There 
is also a longer version of the video featuring more dialogue between Tucker and Jackson, along with 
various other changes available on the web. There is no word on whether or not this third version is 
official or a homemade edit from outtakes.
