The sex film experts at Vivid Video were reportedly so impressed with Ray J's X-rated skills, they want to give him the chance to get paid for filming others getting hot and heavy.

Kardashian has been reported in the tabloid press for her friendship with Paris Hilton and like many celebrities for their romantic interests in singer Justin Timberlake, and a graphic sex tape that depicts Kardashian and her then-boyfriend Ray J performing various sexual acts. Prior to the release of this film, Kardashian announced her intention to pursue legal action to block distribution of the tape.[1] This was the first public acknowledgement of the existence of the tape, which she had previously denied. Despite the impending lawsuit, adult retailers started offering the tape for pre-order in February 2007.
