,Mopper,2007-04-24T14:58Z,"ThnX Mauser23, I'm hoppin' in today, starting with S1-D1, cause Mr_Fear is almost ready with TNG and the most logical thing to do for him is start uploading STV(Star Trek Voyager) and let you finish with DS9 , hope i'll get by soon and S1 stays seeded 
Thank You. 8)"

Sorry if this is too off topic, but I am kind of desperate... I have downloaded all ST Enterprise disks, except for S3D5. 

There are at least 10 leechers stucked for many days at 46,3 % at this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3506410/star_trek .

Is there anyone here who can help?
