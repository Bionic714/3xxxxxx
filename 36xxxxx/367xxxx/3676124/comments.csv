,neslesman,2007-04-30T06:06Z,"I don't think this one will install the animated VIP vehicles scenery, correct me if I'm wrong.  If I'm correct install this one and find yourself a rip version to add just the scenery part manually as you would any other.
Or do without, no big deal."

But can't get this one to unrar.  Tried renaming as suggested by b2bp2p but still get the same errors.

Anyone else have the same problem?  Downloaded several times but still have broken file.  Help Please!!!"
,.VipeR.,2007-05-01T09:29Z,"Thanks a lot!

and yea, i also didnt make to unrar  the files.."
,.VipeR.,2007-05-01T09:37Z,"The weird thing is, that it asks me for n55-cit and n54-cit, but when im trying to browsw, is only shows the n53-cit..."

Anyone got the precision Aerobus Jetstream 41?"
,b2bp2p,2007-05-01T11:58Z,"Ok... rar files and working, at least for me, are named liked this... n53-cit.rar    n54-cit.rar    n55-cit.rar    if anyone want I can upload these files..."
,b2bp2p,2007-05-01T12:03Z,"Ok boytal... seeding pc12 from F1... you are ate 89,7%?"
,.VipeR.,2007-05-01T13:18Z,"b2bp2p, can you upload the installation file in one rar perhaps?"
,neslesman,2007-05-01T14:08Z,"All you have to do is rename the two files and it will work fine.  There is only two possibilities so you can only be wrong once, then you have it.  There is no need for another upload."
,b2bp2p,2007-05-01T14:28Z,Rename the files to n53-cit.rar n54-cit.rar n55-cit.rar and begin unrar with n53-cit.rar... that worked for me...
,N537JB,2007-05-01T15:21Z,"It can't be that hard?


If you use WINRAR then just extract N53-CIT.RAR! Shouldn't be harder than that. And if you don't have WinRAR, go and get it @ hxxp://www.rarlab.comc! Enjoy ;-)

If it's STILL not working, rename n53-cit.rar to n53-cit.part1.rar and n53-cit.r00 to n53-cit.part2.rar and so on!"
,.VipeR.,2007-05-01T16:01Z,"Ok i uderstood what to do eventually, the problem was that it didnt find the 54 and 55 when i tried to browse, but than i checked ""all files"" and it found 'em. no problem now, awesome plane :)"
,mkeflyer,2007-05-01T17:38Z,Thanks! Keep the great FS things coming!
,Rampstriker,2007-05-01T17:53Z,"Thank you N537JB!
I Love that Plane...."
,moto13,2007-05-02T04:29Z,"All working now. The problem unpacking seems to happen when using 7-zip to unrar.  Using winrar 3.62 the archive works fine without renaming. 

Thanks again. Great package."

The only record from the FAA as to N357JB is an exported BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON CANADA model 412EP to Australia.  On the other hand Airliners.net shows MANY photos of a B6 Airbus A320-232 with the registration N357JB.   Know anything about that ?"
