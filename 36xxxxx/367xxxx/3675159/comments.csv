I shamefully regret I had a cracked version of this software, but I am BUYING this software because I have learnt what a brilliant man Steve Gibson (the creator) truly is (and that goes for his product too). Spinrite saves reputations and businesses, it deserves its fee and more. YOU CAN CHOOSE the right thing and purchase SpinRite here: http://www.grc.com/spinrite.htm

You can also listen to Steve Gibson's superb free security podcast here:

,irregularjoe,2007-07-20T05:17Z,Does not work. There is no iso included.
,irregularjoe,2007-07-20T07:49Z,Disregard the above post. It works on a floppy.
,spartan777,2007-07-28T03:58Z,"i can't afford the 89 dollars at the moment, being a student in college and barely able to keep up with the payments atm. however, in a few months, when I'm more financially stable, I will absolutely buy spinrite. Gibson already is such a service to all computer users the way it is. besides, he doesn't use drm of any sort! everyone ought to support steve gibson!"
,daggitenator,2007-10-16T01:21Z,"even placing this file up on TPB is a slap in Steve's face.. Steve's fucking awesome, and SpinRite is the fucking G!
buy this software!!! it's the fucking greatest thing ever, and well worth 20 times over Steve's price.. (which is admittedly high.)

DONT FUCKING DOWNLOAD! DONT FUCKING SEED assholes."
,catfish182,2007-10-23T14:33Z,What its ok to DL what ever you want but not this? Fuck that! Its all or nothing bitches
,agramar,2008-04-18T01:56Z,"this file should not be downloaded by anyone, this guy deserves every $ he gets, it is one thing do download a $1000 program that you need to use only once or twice / month and downloading a program that is by Steve Gibson, who gives all his software away for free (except for this one) this is how he pays his bills. if you still want to dl this file, use it as shareware. if you need to use it and it works (witch it probably will), BUY IT that day. check out his site at

,WebDawg,2008-04-28T06:16Z,"You guys are pathetic.  You will download any other software but as soon as you find something here created by GRC its a big deal.  Just because he has his own site and explains his entire life in detail on it does not mean that you should not download this.   In fact download away!

Stop downloading windows script kiddies and get with the program here."

,prod,2008-07-14T18:26Z,also those saying 'don't pirate this... (but other stuff is fine)' are a bunch of hypocrites
,-RENEGADE-SOLACE-X,2008-12-07T00:21Z,"so wait, r u guys saying download it, than if it works buy the freak'n program??? personally why doesn't Steve release a trial version that only handles files up to 5mb or something like that! just my take on this whole issue.  
don't be so serious;-]"
,hectbp,2009-01-21T22:08Z,Thanks i need that works fine if u wanna pay i pay it but ii am going pirated  Why did u are in a pirate community saying all people 2 buy a program lots of idiots  asssholes morons motherfuckers!!!!!   Enjoy
,Lonelytravler,2009-06-16T18:12Z,"TO be honest I have a cyclic redundancy check errors and bought 2 prg saying it would fix the problem on a new Seagate 500gb drive I bought at xmas time and even Seagate said buy this $129. program to fix it that I told them this file should of been on the CD that came with the drive and like a dummy I get it and NO it did not work, so now I'm the asswhole for buying it or feel like one, so yes Steve should release at least a 14 day trial and if it works people want to keep it buy it, but buying it first and find out it doesn't work? nota again, but I'll DL this and use it like a trial and yes if it works, I'll go to the site and pay him for it, I have 4 500gbs drives and a 1.5TB and a MyBook 1TB usb drive on this system and would be worth the $89. to me."
,Lonelytravler,2009-06-16T18:24Z,"Oh and yes I feel what your thinking and NO, even though Seagate bent me over with no vasiline for the $129.00 to buy there prg, they will not replace the drive, NEVER with I buy another F*cking thing from them, I had a Western Digital 250gb and 4 years later called for support and they said not to worry, send it in and we'll get what we can back for you and so I did and they send the data back on a 500gb at no charge, even paid the shiping, I called up there custmer care and had to get one of the big shots on the phone and made them take a $100. for there troubles cause it was WELL WORTH it to me.... "
,x2rob,2009-08-05T14:19Z,"Thank you very much!

What you all wrote in the previous comments makes sense. You are right!

This software is worth buying, IF you have the cash available...

Best regards to all

,DogNo7,2009-08-08T23:59Z,"Steve Gibson is a git.

Don't bother buying this cowflop.

If you want it, download it.  Use it.  Be happy.

If you want to do a good deed for programmers, give to your favorite open source project.

If you think Gibson deserves your money more than you do, then by all means, buy this off of his website.

Just please, don't buy into Gibson's meglomaniacal ego, or think he knows a frickin thing about security.

Steve Gibson is a worthless turd.

I've said it, and I feel better."
,kristo_th,2009-08-10T18:30Z,I agree - it is great stuff and should be bought - but I am using it just once and cant afford the price right now - anyway credits to Steve for his great tool ! 
,1560,2009-12-13T11:08Z,Nighthawk why are you so mad about this If I were you Id be trying to get you mom off 4chan S
,hujorgen,2009-12-29T03:43Z,"I used this on a client computer (XPMediaCenter 2005) that blue screeened with ""unmountable_boot_device"". I used UBCD4Win disk and it did see the c: partition only as a 1 MB size. I ran this and no sh*t it booted into XP as normal. I was able to recover all user data!!!

Do what you want. I'm just saying it worked for me.
Hu said that."
,MJKW2Ab,2010-09-07T05:56Z,"Steve Gibson is likely on here as he has been programming SpinRite since the 1980s as I recall (I THINK it has been that long...). I also think it's safe to assume he has heard of the pirate bay.

I believe Steve must feel customers will pay for his program if they like it and have the money. He does not even really bother with any real copy protection does he? Of course I'm speculating. I respect programmers more that do not run around online uploading copies of their programs full of trojans and worms.

I treat this as shareware. If the program actually works for me I know the right thing for me to do is to pay for the program when I can. Like some others I am unemployed and actually trying to repair some computers for money. Otherwise I am so poor I am very lucky I am not living on the streets, as jobs are very difficult to find for me. Nevertheless, if I end up making a profit due to his program helping me from losing out because the computer-owner will not pay for a new hard drive, then I feel I owe something to Steve."
,sinand99,2010-12-08T05:26Z,"Did you morons read what is written at the bottom of this website?  ""We love free software."""
,R2d6.51,2011-01-22T00:44Z,Some of us have moved beyong calling people names.  If youcan't be civil then go live in the busdh with the animals.
,Zeptinune,2011-04-16T13:13Z,"Seriously, this is a torretning website. I'll download whatever the fuck I want. Tons of people who make their living from software have their stuff shared to death either way...

That's just the cards that life dealt them. You guys have to remember not everyone is as resourceful as us torrenters. There are tons of lame-brained fuckwits who buy everything they think they need because they don't know about bittorrent or p2p. Hell, there are still morons who buy everything if they cant find it on fucking Limewire!

Steve has already made tons of money, and he stated himself that it wasn't hard to create this program. It's not like it's his life's fucking work.

Just download it, thousands of others will buy the fucking thing if they need it.

As for me, thanks much to him, but thanks a fucking shit ton to the uploader lol!

If Steve wants more money he should think about making a better website that doesn't look like it was made in Ms Dos Paint 1991..."
,Clache,2011-06-25T00:30Z,"I've been using Spinrite since the old DOS days.  And, it has been very reliable.  I own version 6, and use it for work.  If I loose my disk or don't have it on site, I come here for a backup copy.  

I recommend supporting the author.  It's the right thing to do. How would you like your chosen career to be in an industry rife with theft?  If I am broke, then pirating is about sharing.  If I'm just a cheap bastard, then pirating is stealing.

It is all or nothing, but you don't have be a dick.  Pay for what you can. If you use the product to make money or in your daily job, then it's worth paying for."
,whiterussian74,2012-04-01T15:31Z,"If you can't afford the $89, then you can ask to DONATE something via PayPal, etc.
 I'm sure Steve would appreciate $20 if you like his product. You don't even have to say why you are donating. Just say you enjoy his software and want to contribute to his design efforts."
,kraker18,2012-05-23T23:06Z,"fuck outta here asshole, with ur propaganda bullshit."
,kraker18,2012-05-23T23:08Z,sorry that was for dicksuckinator or what ever his name is....fucking tool this is a p2p site flog off
,shesashairy,2012-05-25T04:45Z,Fekkin A! I'm gonna download this shit just to see what the kerfuffle is about... If it works then well done uploader... Avast Tagscanner Spywareblaster Utorrent EAC blah blah blah all free... No idea who the dude prog creator is but he has at least 5 TBP IDs!!!!!! IF NOT wtf are the braindoners moaning about. Why are you here?  IF and only If this software makes you money or more efficient to the point of saving at LEAST the price then possibly yeah pay the new messiah his silver... I never charged for fixing PCs cos my family and friends are all scumbag povs like me... therefore the chances of this software making me a dollar are greatly reduced.
