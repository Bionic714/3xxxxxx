This is a collection of Led Zeppelin albums in FLAC format that I had one hell of a time finding.  I had to fix tags, filenames, headers, you name it, these had issues.

The early days (1969-1970)
    * Led Zeppelin (the first album)
    * Led Zeppelin II
    * Led Zeppelin III

The biggest band in the world (1971?1975)
    * The fourth album
    * Houses of the Holy
    * Physical Graffiti

I don\'t remember all the original uploaders because I had to take bits and pieces from so many.   If you want credit, become a recording artist. :-)

I\'ve left the album art that was in the original Torrents and added some more from the Wikipedia.  There\'s a bunch of info on these and the other releases here:

I\'ll only be super-seeding so if you like this, seed for your fellow torrent pals.  If you don\'t like it, well, don\'t waste your time or mine.

\"Presence\" is missing from this to make it a complete collection (I don\'t count re-releases like Coda, Remasters or The Box Set).  If you know where one can get that in FLAC format, help a guy out and post a comment?
