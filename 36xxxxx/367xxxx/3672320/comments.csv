,metalhead1993,2008-11-16T20:48Z,this is a message to everyone that is telling people to seed : fuck you people dont have to seed if they dont want to faggots
[T],stanky1219,2008-12-28T06:36Z,"hey metalhead! what do you mean people don't have to seed???

how do you think this shit works??

if people dont seed you dont get your files.

and if people dont seed then there is no need for the p2p system or bt system at all.

imagine that......no more file sharing sites for you to post moronic comments like your last one.

yoo racka dissapwinn yung grass hoppa."
,smashead666,2009-01-04T05:18Z,"yeah metalhead, your a fucking moron. fucking 15 year olds.

thanks bro, priest is awesome! I don't get the point of putting th best of cds in the torrent, but its your shit, and i'm very thankful regardless. "
,zed255,2009-01-08T03:13Z,"I will seed this as long as I can, once it finishes! The last 200MB is really slow. Share ratio now over 5 (over 20GB out) currently. Thanks very much, some of these albums just aren't readily out there anymore, at least not locally to me."
,tvhead,2009-01-10T15:47Z,Great up.  Thanks.  I used to have most of these on cassette but never replaced them on CD.

,Nosferatu666,2010-02-07T02:30Z,"Nice torrent but oh so slow download.

Its at 40% after almost 10 hours of downloading, and it says that more than 11 hours remains.

Averages 63 kB/s

Can someone explain this, or is it just that people doesnt seed after they have finished downloading?"
,solamande,2010-02-18T03:04Z,Thank You Mister Molfest Man Sir.
,BERO1707,2010-03-18T17:32Z,Nosferatu666 that is pretty fast for torrent. don't complain!
,razzell2,2010-03-28T14:09Z,"I would think that a download this size would appear to be very slow. It must be 4 gigs of data.
I show 266 seeders but more leechers than seeders. Still, with 266 active seeders, you should be getting top download speeds.
And yet, even at top download speeds, a huge, multiple cd share like this is gonna take hours to download.
Thanks Molfest! Im gonna give it a try and see how long it takes to dl.
Love the share.....just, you know, dont be ""BREAKIN' THE LAW, BREAKIN' THE LAW""!
(see, that was a funny, a joke..ah nevermind!)"
,Fighterlegend,2010-05-20T23:54Z,"Stop leeching, start seeding!
