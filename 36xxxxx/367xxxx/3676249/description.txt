Forgiving Dr. Mengele is a documentary film about Eva Mozes Kor, a victim of the Holocaust and her decision to forgive the Nazis who killed her family and in particular Dr. Josef Mengele and his staff, who experimented on her and her twin sister Miriam Mozes as well as approximately 1,400 other twin pairs.

The documentary was directed by Bob Hercules and Cheri Pugh, who also served as producers. They followed Eva for over four years, chronicling her story and her journey to Israel. Her decision to forgive the Nazis has been met with incredulity and hostility by some, particularly other Holocaust survivors, and these views are portrayed as well.

Forgiving Dr. Mengele premiered at the Gene Siskel Film Center in Chicago, Illinois, on February 24, 2006. It was scheduled to play for a week, and then travel to other cities in the US. The film is distributed by First Run Features which handles independent films and documentaries.
