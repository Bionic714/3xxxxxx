,spacey41,2007-05-04T01:18Z,"I read the fake one .

Its fucking brilliant, JK Rowling couldnt have done it better seriously

I dont care about the real one !"
,Bamimi,2007-05-04T06:19Z,"the last one was ok. this one obviously is written by a less then talented writer. its only a meg, certainly worth the minute it takes to dl, but not even close to as good as she will hopefully write. whomever is writing this obviously hasnt had a girlfriend and certainly doesnt understand relationships as he painfully clogs through harry having a relationship/obsession with ginny and Ron having one with herm. the plot isnt so bad, but the dialect is horrible, and the plot really isnt  even close to good enough to make up for it. I applaud the effort, seriously. but this is why one is a writer, and the other is a poser evidently."

,Errand,2007-05-21T20:35Z,"Why do u even care? Its a dog writing, not even close to JKR and the REAL one is soon on the streets.

Start supporting the good ones and DL the crap, like the rest of us on the warez scene"
