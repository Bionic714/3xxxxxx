It was just in the nfo of the mooncube release, when it was released back in 2003."

What now?"
,17eacon,2008-05-21T22:44Z,"So yeah, after you have all the files what do you do?"

Depends on what method you would like to play the ISO with.  In my situation I use XenoGC2 laser chip mod, and just burn to a Ritek G05 or Yuden TYG03 or any other quality DVD-R and play... that's it.

 You understand the GC filesystem used is not a standard ISO9660, right?  You should read about these computer science basics by checking out ""file systems"" in particular .... the Gamecube linux project may give you some insight into this.

Basically, You cannot mount the ISO with Deamon tools... unless it understands the GC filesystem.    Personally I don't touch Windows over here, so I wouldn't know.  I use VERY flexible Mandriva Linux ( distribution flavor doesn't matter, they are all great).

You may even be able to play this on a GC emulator.  But I would search for an open source version ONLY, other versions tend to be Trojan viruses masquerade as an emulator.   However, if you use Linux, you won't have these issues, but I digress ;)"

Hey, see your cell phone... see your router... see your LCD TV... um just about any modern electronics you can imagine... well ... low and behold, about a 90% chance it was designed on Linux (or at least a Unix or Solaris flavor).  

Not to mention  a bulk of routers run Linux as the driving embedded OS.  BTW, I am a hardware engineer, so I do have some insight into these things.

To say Linux is ""stupid"" would imply that all your other ""toys"" are as well.  But, as a desktop user, which is likely all you would use it for, you would notice a complete lack of virus and spam-ware availability on Linux :( .  Disappointing for you I am sure.

Just because you lack understanding doesn't mean it is ""stupid"".  "

,johntrau,2011-04-19T01:01Z,"just a question... is there any way to make this play on a wii? if not, is there a site where i can download games that i can load directly onto my wii? sorry if this sounds like a dumb question to some, but i dont usually download games other than for pc... thanks :)"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-07-12T06:40Z,"1. Linux is stupid, and really only for the hardcore nerds. Its has massive advantages over windows, but to do even the most minor task requires amazingly unneeded skills. Just use windows and stop being a non-conformist little bitch.
Unless you just don't want to pay for windows - then your fine...

2. You can't mount and run a Gamecube game. Don't be retarded.
Use dolphin to load the iso, or gcm or whatever file you download if you wish to play this on PC.

3. This can be played on wii - if you payed for a wii chip - you're a retard.
You can play this on a softmodded wii by burning the file to a good quality dvd-r. The load using neogamma, or about 5 other programs.

You can load it on a softmodded wii using mios dios lite - using sd card

You can load it from a usb harddrive on your wii using mios dios 2 - slightly more effort to get it started.
