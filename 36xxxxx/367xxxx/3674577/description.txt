Here is your chance to hear Swedish music act DayBehavior s 2-disc second album in dts surround.

NOTE that you will need a dvd player with a dts decoder somewhere in your sound system, and a five-speaker set-up to benefit from the multichannel programme. If you have no dts decoder, there will be no sound or all you will hear is awful digital noise.

Burn the isos, one for each disc, as audio cds, using Nero or whatever. 300 dpi covers are included.




I think this album failed commercially because it is too moody and often too slow-paced to hit the dance floors. Frankly, it is also too musical. Dance music must be very simple and easy to follow to work out, but DayBehavior seems to be wanting to make music meant for LISTENING to; yet it has a lot of the attributes of dance music, so...anyway, it is a good album, I think, and the surround mix is playful (even too playful for my taste) but it comes with the genre, I suppose. Enjoy!
