mkv is better then avi and x264 pisses on xvid
this version is much better then the xvid version. higher resolution, better compression, higher quality. its near HR quality and yet the same file size as the xvid release."
,death734,2007-05-21T09:37Z,"by the way incase you have been in the dark, all 720p releases (not that this is one, but there are a lot of them) are x264 codec in the mkv container because the overall quality is much better then xvid in avi at the same file size

so x264 is slowly taking over, so get use it and quit acting like a 70 year old guy against change. after all, years ago everything use to pre dominately be vcd and svcd then divx (mpeg 4 part 2) came in, gave much better compression and was used, and now x264 (mpeg-4 part 10) has been around a while and gives much better compression then xvid or divx. so yeah its slowly  making its way into releases. already owns the 720p releases its just a matter of time until you start seeing more x264 at 350mb and others"

Included viewer doesn't seem to be working for me and every other converter/viewer seems to hate me as well.  

Please spare my laptop the trauma of being thrown out the window and hook a girl up!"
