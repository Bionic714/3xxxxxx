Anyone who was downloading previous torrents that are in .zip file, download this.

Sorry all about the last couple of times I tried to share this, with failed attempts. The file ended up corrupt and I had to repair it.

This is the latest Dolphin Release Game Cube Emulator capable of running commercial games.  It is version "1.03.2 BETA," so it might not work perfectly on all games and systems. Includes Super Smash Brothers Melee ROM. This was a little hard for me to find so once I got it I figured I would share. Keyboard Plug-ins are added for those who do not have joysticks.


Virus-free guaranteed, scanned with AVG Suite Professional 7.5, anyone who says otherwise? lol. You're funny.
