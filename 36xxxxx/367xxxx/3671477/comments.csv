,janihunyad,2007-04-23T20:49Z,ok ok ..nice...but seed?
,silencedassault,2007-04-23T21:11Z,"I am seeding... but utorrent is saying upload 0.0/kb, is it or is it not downloading for you? Since I am the only seeder for now, people may experience a few disconnections but it will continue. That is me kicking my ISP's ass to get things right, otherwise I'll switch over to cable. I'll be seeding 100% all night tonight."
,silencedassault,2007-04-23T21:32Z,"Ok, so we're all good. I am the only seeder at about 50/kb. Please, please... please after download. Seed for a little while so other people can get it. ;) "
,silencedassault,2007-04-23T21:35Z,"Also, If anyone has any recommendations or games/Roms/Emulators/Programs they want, let me know. More than likely I have it or can get it. I'm just new to this uploading/seeding torrents."
,silencedassault,2007-04-24T06:45Z,"I'm really hoping someone is going to give me a hand and help seed, at some point or another whether tomorrow or the next day I'm going to have to stop... I've done 2GB now and still going and I'm still the only one. I know there are people who really want this, but there are also people who're selfish... help me out here..."
,Tomaz82,2007-04-24T16:48Z,"I was one of many that got stuck at 46.9% on the old torrent.
Once I get home from work I'll start downloading this and once I'm done I'll keep seeding it for some time."
,silencedassault,2007-04-27T05:44Z,"To the people who are wishing to download but don't help seed, the reason why torrents don't last or are dead is because you leech and refuse to seed. If it were up to me, I'd cancel you before you got the chance to download it. To the small loyal few who have been seeding with me to keep this torrent alive and available to others, thank you kindly."

,halo37253,2007-08-03T23:43Z,"this runs pretty good, getting 25-60fps not bad for an emulator. Still was they were working harder on this Delphin its not that fun to play if your not atleast getting 45-100fps range.

,Rajiore,2007-09-11T02:15Z,Could someone help with getting the keyboard plug-in to work?
,Recka50,2007-09-24T09:59Z,"BoldAsLove Anything from PS2 or GC or newer emulators aren't ROMs they are the CD ISOs and you need an incredibly good CPU and GPU and shitloads of RAM like Intel Core 2 Quad 2.4 Ghz, 2 X Nvidia 8800 GTX running in SLI and 2 Gb DDR3 RAM (only got the PC two weeks ago :D) to run in perfect quality, It also has 2 X 500 Gb SATA 2 HDDs with 22"" Widescreen monitor + FLOPPY DRIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have full detail list for my PC if anyone wants :P BT I have been seeding this since it fully Downloaded, (1 week ago) and WILL continue to seed as much as I can"
,Pyrocx,2007-10-01T16:39Z,How do i get it to work with a keyboard?
,silencedassault,2007-10-15T23:48Z,"Ahh, feels nice to be back again. Anyhow, I remember when I uploaded this torrent that I believe I included the file necessary to play with the keyboard. It should be in plugins. You need to select that from the preferences within the player. Also - The player needs to be installed. :P Lots of ? about that. It works perfectly on my computer, some computers need to be fine-tuned. This is a very demanding game for being an emulator."
,Klinefelter,2007-10-29T00:56Z,"Coolio.  I've been looking for this ROM for awhile.  Probably can't play it, though, since my computer runs choppy on the 64 Smash ROM... yeah...  Anyway, I'll download it if for nothing else than archiving and seeding purposes.  I'll warn you, though, I won't be able to seed 24/7, but I WILL be seeding when I'm on."

,Warriorphill,2008-01-24T21:02Z,how do you play the game without a joystick?
,icester,2008-02-16T15:38Z,"*** PAL not USA ***

This is NOT USA it is PAL - use Dolphin to verify.  Note that a lot of people cant' get PAL SSBM to work on a USA Wii.

,mscollins,2008-05-09T23:03Z,hey guy's looked into this before dl and it is only supported on a 64 bit system if you cannot get it to run this is most likely your problem 
,_Lugh_,2008-08-05T19:46Z,"its PAL vers.... downloaded it just to play on my USA Wii, and didnt work... damn Liar!"
,RicoRehn,2008-08-14T14:37Z,"Does who not get have joystick , i think u need to load the keyboard plugin, but havent dowloaded it yet so^^"
,narutomaaan,2008-08-14T17:18Z,just so everyone know... gbc games will not run without lagg so try out the new dolphin 64-bit emulator and maybe it will work better. but i suggest you all to wait a few more years before play this games ^^
,rimirilar,2008-09-07T01:18Z,"Every time I try to run Smash Bros, or any other ROM, all I get is an error message: Failed to load ansi_font.bin, failed to load sjis_font.bin, and couldn""t init the core. What do i need to do to get this to work?"

,aakash435,2010-07-28T22:05Z,He is fucking his mother nothing works the game is slow & it hangs on options.pls do not download this.The worst torrent downloaded in my life.
,Bluefire4,2010-10-02T16:03Z,"Ok first things first people... If you don't have a quad core computer don't even bother downloading!!!!

Emulators DO NOT use your graphics card even if you do have one. I myself have 2 Nvidia GTS 250 in SLI and they run great but the emulators don't touch it. ALL the graphics calculations are done using the processor. This is why some of you have UNBELIEVABLY slow fps. Nothing is wrong besides that your computer just can't handle it. Dual core gaming rigs won't cut it here.

Also the emulator version this uploader has uploaded is trash. He is also incorrect when he says his version is the last to play commercial games. I have version 2.0 and everything runs fine. Go to the Dolphin website and download the newest version!

If anyone continues to have issues check the Dolphin forum and/or email me at thebluepowers@gmail.com.

Best of luck ye pirates!!"
,tetsuHaduken,2011-01-30T01:20Z,for people who are using dolphin...dolphin wii emulator uses the proccessor and on the graphics card so if u have really good comuter but have a dual core or lower or if ur using dolphin on laptops..it's gonna be super slow...i recomend using it on a quad core desktop computer...or go to ur proccessors webpage and dl the optimizer..so if u have amd turion x2 64bit u can go to the amd site and dl the dual core optimizer...but i dont guarantee really good fps...
,narcodicts,2011-05-10T00:59Z,The reason this torrent isnt up to date with dolphin is because it was uploaded in 2007. now idk which version of dolphin was out back then. but i think im sure he uploaded this when it was up to date.
,ripper564,2011-05-11T11:41Z,awesome upload man. didn't think you could get GQ for pc. Thanks a lot man. Will seed :)
,ripper564,2011-05-11T11:44Z,"ok. 2 people have it but there selfish just like every other p2p. ""typical"". you find something good and no one shares it. i can see 2 people with 100%. seeeeeeeeeeeed"
