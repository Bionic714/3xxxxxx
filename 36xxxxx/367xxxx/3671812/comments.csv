,MasterBate,2008-06-05T13:01Z,"This upload is nice but you, like everybody else here on PBay, have forgot the latest game (the one that put the Triology in AvP) Extinction.

It was originally intended to be a XBox exclusive but I saw it a few times on the PC-shelf in the stores.

I had it to XBox ATTB, but stupid as I was, I sold it and now it's impossible to get to both PC and XBox!

Can't find it anywhere!!!"
