
Big talk from a small-town Texas girl, but Lambert's got
 the goods to back it up. The old-school passion and 
power of her nearly platinum-selling 2005 debut KEROSENE
took it to the top of both the country charts and the 
critics' polls. Now the two-time CMA Horizon Award 
nominee returns with Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, on which she
raises the stakes both musically and emotionally.

"My songs talk about real things," says Miranda Lambert.
"Things that I've been through or I've witnessed through 
my friends and family - even my parents' private
investigation business. If I feel it, I can sing it and
make anyone believe it.
