,LlamaMaster,2008-04-11T22:54Z,"Well, the game works good so far with an emulator except for one thing:  On level 2 there are invisible bullets which are impossible to dodge.  I know for a fact they are supposed to be visible, but they aren't."
,fullArmor,2009-04-21T09:43Z,"LlamaMaster: Go complain to the emulator developer or try a diff emu. Don't blame the rom.
