Let\'s face it. Capcom and SNK both have been slaving away with the fighting genre for eons, and if there are any two companies out there who know their stuff, it\'s those two. From Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting to Street Fighter and DarkStalkers, the legendary masters of the fist rarely miss the mark. And while both companies have had better efforts in the past, Capcom vs. SNK Pro still rates extremely high on the playability factor.

Not nearly as complicated as CvS 2, the fighting modes are broken down into two basic types: Capcom Groove and SNK Groove. While the Capcom version fills its power meter through defense and offense that\'s eventually unleashed into some nasty super moves, the SNK alternative requires the player to charge their own power meter through discretionary button pushes (and special non-chargeable attacks called Desperations).

Once you\'ve picked your groove, it\'s Street Fighter as usual with the typical fireballs, hurricane kicks, and dragon uppercuts. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t stray too far past this mold. Discouraging juggles, parries, and air battles, Capcom vs. SNK is a more straightforward struggle than most of today\'s modern entries. And while the familiar system responds well to direction input and moves just as quickly as you\'d expect it too, a good-corner trapper can own the competition. Luckily, you should have enough retro fun with it for that technique issue not to matter.

Surprisingly, the game is still a lot more balanced than it\'s previous pre-Pro incarnation, with various gameplay tweaks and character adjustment to make fighting a little fairer. An absolute monster in the initial release, Blanka has been made quicker while weakening his damage limits considerably. So while the hit and run ball tactics may have worked in repeated succession back in the day, it\'s going to take of powerful hits to gain a victory in the rebound. Other fighters have been strengthened and tightened up as well, with a healthy dose of move swapping between the EX and regular versions of the characters.
