,tomtomx,2007-04-22T23:06Z,Was this before or after he was imprisoned for fraud?
,battlewounds,2007-04-23T20:46Z,"Well I accidentaly included the cnn interview with this torrent, but the donahue clip is way before he was charged with fraud. I agree he had problems which is why to this day I will not donate him money. I'm not going to give money to a gambler that's not smart. He has good ideals, a great way of speaking, and stands up for whites. Anybody can be bad with money, as is he and he got punished for it!"
,battlewounds,2007-04-23T20:48Z,wow that sentence made it look like I was sayin he's not smart. It's suppose to say That I would not be smart to donate money to a gambler.
,tomtomx,2007-04-23T23:51Z,"Well, he isn't smart. And he's one of the biggest scumbags of our time. 
On May 29 2004, David Duke brought together in New Orleans leaders of the European Nationalist movement to sign an agreement that would ""mainstream our cause"". The New Orleans Protocol signatories pledged to avoid violence and internecine attacks. It was immediately signed by eight white supremacist and neo-Nazi representatives, most representing organizations, including the notorious National Alliance, and Stormfront. Duke signed on behalf of his new organization, European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO).
In 2005, Duke has teamed up with Don Black of Stormfront and now delivers a one-hour webcast six days a week."
,tomtomx,2007-04-24T00:14Z,"And he wasn't imprisoned for ""being bad with money"". He was imprisoned for fraud (ripping of his followers) and tax crimes. "
