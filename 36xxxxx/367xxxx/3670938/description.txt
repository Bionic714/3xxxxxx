MGTEK dopisp - The ultimate iPod plug-in for Windows Media Player?

MGTEK dopisp is a plug-in for Windows Media Player that enables 
you to sync your MP3 music to your iPod directly from within Windows 
Media Player. There is no external user interface, no fluff, not even 
a program icon to click on. Just connect your iPod, fire up Windows Media 
Player, start moving your music to your iPod, and forget that the two 
once didn't play together.
