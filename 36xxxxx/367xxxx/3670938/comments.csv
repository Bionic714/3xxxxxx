,tchad,2007-04-27T16:08Z,This is an evaluation version only working for 30 days? Why is that?
,tchad,2007-05-14T18:56Z,"I still only got an evaluation license which expires 21-05-2007, even though I select retail edition and enters the provide serial.

I've tried to delete the MGTEK entires in the reg, with no luck."
,SubZane,2007-05-23T08:47Z,"Serial is an evaluation key that has already expired, pointless ""release"" Two thumbs down"
,honk555,2007-05-26T20:46Z,"This download is no hack, but the original installer package. You may as well download it from here
http://www.mgtek.com/dopisp/

The serial is an eval key, and it is expired!

TRB_FC5, you suck!

I guess it is worth to spend the 15 bucks..."
,tchad,2007-05-27T15:07Z,"Thank god I'm not the only one, having problems.

Thought I was going noob.."
,slimshady26,2007-07-17T05:23Z,"You can install this by setting your Windows date back to 4/17/07.  The installer package expires after 30 days, thus if it thinks your pc is within 30 days, it will install...."
,Trushka,2007-08-15T07:39Z,"Where's the product key?

The zip file only contains an msi and an nfo file that cannot be opened by System Information."
,Trushka,2007-08-15T08:02Z,"Ok.  Opened the nfo file and found the product key.  But, like honk555  said,  it is an evaluation license key and it is expired.

I followed slimshady26's advise to roll back the date. That didn't work.   I still got the expired message."
,mrmangina,2008-03-23T23:18Z,"Torrent works perfectly

Follow these steps exactly to install:
1) Change the date on your system to 04/17/07
2) Run setup program
3) Select Retail and enter serial

If you don't change the date on your system back to 04/17/07 before you install, the program will leave an entry in your registry and you won't be able to install at all. Hope this helps."
,babyshaq90,2008-03-30T06:50Z,"Works perfectcly.
folow mrmanginas guide and it SHOULD work.
the nfo file opens with winrar."
,gatomartin,2008-04-29T18:15Z,so what's the product key? i can't find it .. what's an nfo file..?
,misstq,2008-05-12T17:57Z,i tried many times. cannot open the file. not with winrar not with other. so no serial at all. it sucks wasting time...
,markuska,2008-05-14T16:15Z,"if you cant open the readme file, try leftclicking it and open it in wordpad, it worked for me. Combine this with setting the date back and it should be working!"
,1987FX-16,2008-07-15T00:43Z,hey when i tryed to open the readme file it said it might be corrupted or an unrecognized verion so will someone send me the serial @ 1987FX16@gmail.com thanks
,brent7890,2008-11-28T04:16Z,"Ok ok. I'm going to simplify it for you. This is a freeware version, or trial version, I'm telling you this right off the back. (BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CANNOT USE IT FOR AN ETERNITY) It's simple. First, extract the items to your desktop, or wherever. After, take the read me, and right click it. Open With: Word pad. It says in the read me ""IF YOU LIKE THIS SOFTWARE THEN BUY IT!"" Don't get discouraged. Set your clock (Yes that thing in the bottom right corner of your computer ""OHHHH, That clock!?"") Yes, that clock. Now right click it and click, 'Adjust Date/Time' And set your clock you April 17, 2007. Then make sure you click 'Apply'. Now install it with the key, ect. do whatever. After you install it, go into windows media and right click the minimize button for windows media (Yes that dash button next to the 'X' button at the top right of the screen.) Right click and go down to tools > Plugins > Options. Under the plugins tab, go down to categories. Look for background, and click it. It will say MGTEK dopisp. Select it, and click on properties. Now you can adjust the bit rate it will decode at, and if you click the 'about' tab, it tells you when it expires. Don't worry about the date or anything, you can even set your clock back to normal. However, if your clock is anywhere past the date, which is, 5/ 17/ 07, it will not work, it will be expired. Whenever you want to use it, set your system date back to 4/ 17/ 07, it will work every time, then simply switch it back if you desire the correct date. Hope this helps, Have fun."

http://www.copytrans.net/copytransmanager.php

Yes, it's a pain to switch to another program to sync your iPod, and there are a few limitations to the free version... BUT it will sync your MP3's without screwing up the MP3 tag data."
