One theme rang true, one we have seen in many movies like this : those who are ON tv don't actually own or watch a tv! LOL Ok, so it is a bit predictable, but the filming was good, the music will keep your teeth on edge and you will be entertained... Michelle fans will be sadly disappointed, I know I was... but it is a fairly creepy ride, sort of following the Halloween storyline. I didn't see the '74 version, I just love Mitchie! "
