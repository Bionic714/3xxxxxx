,Skarmory,2009-06-15T14:50Z,"ok fuckers ill teach you how to get this shit working

1 - Get CFW 3.71 m33 or above (latest verison out is 5.00 m33-6)
2 - After doing that connect your psp to the computer and in ur flash1 (your psp's memory card) make a folder called ISO   if u havent already MAKE SURE ITS ALL CAPS

3 - Extract the files and rename the file too GTA LCS or wateva u want but the name of the file MUST be kept short
4 - copy and paste the iso/cso file into the ISO folder
5 - turn off ur psp to the max...
6 -  HOLD THE 'R' TRIGGER and turn on ur psp (keep holdin on to the r trigger)
7 - Once ur in Recovery Mode go to 
configuration>umd mode and change it to sony NP9660 -NO UMD-

8 - ENJOY THE FUCKING GAME NOW FUCK OFF"

Size on disk: 893 MB (936,804,352 bytes)
   but is laggs a little too much....so i uncompressed it (of course its now bigger, now its 1.57 GB (1,696,006,144 bytes) BUT NOW it doesnt even lag at all )  then i decided to compress it with my favorite cso compresser and it ended up being almost the same size and now it just laggs a little(almost not noticable) !!
