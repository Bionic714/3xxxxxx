Internet Favs Icon Keeper from PC Magazine - Keep icons of your internet Favs permantely displayed

I love this proggie for it's simplicity. 

I don't really use it to check my favs but....it can do that also.
 
I personally use it to keep my bookmarked sites icons set forever to the sites image...not the generic big E that they turn into after you reboot.
 

This is a full version which I got for becominging subscribed to PC magazine, way back when.

I subscribed in order to get this version because it was better & quicker than the real paid version at that time. Although this is an oldie, it works & is the only proggie made to date which can accomplish this task.

This proggie will ask you where to save the fav icons it finds...I recommend that you save 'em to your fav folder in a new sub folder. Once the fav icons are DLed they will be set forever & not lost when you dumpyour temps.

This proggie also has the capability to check for dead links...



Enjoy!
