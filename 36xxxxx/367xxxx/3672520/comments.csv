,robban1983,2007-04-29T08:33Z,"how do you play this? I've downloaded the first part ( ...disk1.ts) but I get no video from it, only audio. I've tried with VLC, mediaplayer classic, PowerDVD 7.3 etc. I also tried to split the ts file with tsconverter and ProjectX but no luck to get any video out of it.
 Is it because I haven't downloaded the par2-files yet?
I've got other ts movies to work with my computer."
[T],HDTV CHINA,2007-04-29T19:51Z,"You need install Media player 11 for got WMVideo decoder DMO,and install  Haali Splitter, and then use KMPlayer to play.
any information to see doom9.net"
,Olaffublive,2007-04-30T23:07Z,"I've downloaded quite a few of these that HDTV CHINA has posted.   Not ONE will work and I have tried almost every player out there.   Thanks for posting cool shit, but post cool shit that works right next time.   ""You need install Media player 11 for got WMVideo decoder DMO,and install Haali Splitter, and then use KMPlayer to play.""  what the fuck are these programs?  If VLC or PowerDVD doesnt play it, I'm not fucking with it.  Too much work...
"
[T],HDTV CHINA,2007-05-02T00:51Z,"if you dont know what is Splitter and decodec,what is KMPlayer MPlayerc and BSplayer and how to config them, so do not download what i posted, because you dont have enough level to play HD REMUX. take a knowledge at www.doom9.net first then come back download."
,alpher,2007-05-04T23:24Z,HDTV CHINA: Dont listen to the negative remarks...just keep up the VERY good work! ;)
,oswald1234,2007-05-12T11:22Z,"Dude, core2 duo(2.4)  is minumum. AND a kick ass card. Still it glitches(sometimes). At least you got it it to work. Halli splitter, i always had. Just download the smallest video file on high priority,stay away from the VC-1 and the AVI files if your not a real smart guy.If it dont work...shit can it,if it did... post how you you ""actually""got the biatch to play.(player,codecs ect...)"
,oswald1234,2007-05-12T12:29Z,"Ths seems to be the ""how to play the shit "" spot. Can one of you nerds  like ""alpher"" (who thinks its so great) Tell us how to play these VC-1 files. Step by step in english, please, your the stud...spit out your secrets."
,oswald1234,2007-05-16T04:03Z,"Download the complete media player 11, For some reason the codec alone didnt work for me(dunno why,drove me nuts) Downloaded the complete media player 11 and (boom) it worked on the KMplayer. You need core2 duo on Bigscreen TV I meant, You could get by with less on computer monitor."
,hurrafor,2007-05-19T11:32Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

http://www.dvbportal.de/projects/hdtvpump/

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

http://haali.cs.msu.ru/mkv/

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
,AVandelay,2007-05-22T19:41Z,"How do you 'digg' to get this rolling?

I have installed the programs you have listed I have KMPlayer,zoom player are able to se all files accept for these HD / Ts files where I only get sound. Can some one apply some details please?"
,Krokkedille,2007-05-22T23:18Z,"What is the situation concerning DTS-HD since i dont get sound from these tracks.
Yes i am a New in these matters, but i got some of the HDTV CHINA releases to play in PowerDVD -  but now i get no sound from HD DTS or DD PLUS. As far as i understand PowerDVD is supose to do THAT.
Please Help"
,Krokkedille,2007-05-23T01:02Z,"Thanks a lot, for all info. KMPlayer did play with sound and video. I admit that i dont understand much in details how it work, but it does work, and i can enjoy the many GB i have downloade.
Surely a faq about demux (or is it remux) will be apreciated, and all the talk about ""splitter"" is in the dark for me too. Some good links about it, will be helpfull. (basic INFO) A few notes  in the ""torrent INFO "" will help all the newcomers geting started in the HDDVD Business (for real). Again thanks a lot."
,StingerRecords,2007-05-27T14:16Z,"Hi,
Thanks for the upload... but I'm really getting confused. First off I have WMP 11 so I muust have the WMVvideo codec... next I downloaded Haali Splitter the newest one. Then I downloaded KMPlayer. Thos were the instructions of HDTV China. However, it didn't work.
Next I tried what hurrafor said to do... download the HDTV pump 1.0.7. I did that... and now it still doesn't work.
Well, only the AUDIO works but NOT the video... no matter what program I used. On top of that.. now that I have downloaded HDTVPump WMP11 glitches and closes right away when i open up the TS files of King Kong.
Please, any help on what settings I should put KMPlayer on or what settings I should put my codec on would be a great help.
Thanks alot. Emailing me at selkhafif@hotmail.com would be better."
,StingerRecords,2007-05-29T00:40Z,"OK!!
Here is the problem.. I tried EVERYTHING possible... downloaded a million gazillion codecs.. no! that aint it!
Downloaded a bunch of crap I didnt know WHAT was....
Hmmm... I was so near to deleting this torrent and downloading the other one.. 
All you gotta do is download WMP 11 .. if you already have it and your getting no video and only audio from this movie.. then REINSTALL IT... that was what i did. You must reinstall it... download matroska splitter like he said... and download KMplayer and play it with that (Windows media player sucks the way the sound is played). OFC if you don't have ATLEAST a dual-core Processor and a x1900 ati or similar Nvidia card it will not work (and you will still get spikes even with those specs).
Hope this help. As a conclusion here is what you must do:
1.) INSTALL or REINSTALL windows media player 11.
2.) INSTALL or REINSTALL matroska splitter.
3.) INSTALL or REINSTALL KMPlayer.

If this doesn't work then i dunno get at me by email selkhafif@hotmail.com with specs of your problems.
PEACE."
,rc71,2007-05-30T18:48Z,"Crap!  It DOES Work.
StingerRecords is right.
Reinstall a few hundred times and it DOES work.
A nice little write up with the needed software would probably be a good idea.  It would speed up the torrent too as more people share it."
,KillerBob666,2007-08-26T21:37Z,"It didn't work at first for me either, even after installing every shit ever mentioned in this thread. What finally solved it was when I ran SetCenter and switched all options from ""Gabest"" or similar to Haali that I could find."
,piffy,2007-09-23T12:09Z,Wrong category!!!! Should be in DVD section!
,187mr,2009-01-28T06:54Z,"hey is anyone know how to put the file back together?
