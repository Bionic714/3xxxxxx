,ilive4harleys,2007-12-04T22:23Z,James Kees you are truly da bomb (as the youngns say). Thank you so much for your wonderful uploads. You are filling a much loved genre of Asian martial arts films which are usually only available dubbed in English. I repeat my statement from Drunken Monkey...you sir are a gentleman and a scholar ;-)
,xkexkexke,2008-02-22T15:09Z,"Very nice movie with the superstar in martial arts Jackie Chan. In this 
movie Jackie Chan impersonates Dragon who is a student and his martial 
arts school is in competition against a more affluent rival school. The 
two groups face off in an annual lion dance competition in which Chan 
finds himself up against his own schoolmate Tiger, who is secretly 
being paid to perform for the rival 
school....wing-chunws/The%20young%20Master.html"
