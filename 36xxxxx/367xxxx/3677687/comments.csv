,Donate,2007-08-01T11:09Z,"Thanks for the movie. I wonder whats the point of raring movies though? The difference in size is insignificant and most likely the filesystem will spend far more space all in all on the harddisk because of the very large number of files which must be handled. But more importantly, you can't preview half-downloaded file, select to only download one file in case the rar archive contains more than one file, its inconvenient to unrar the files after downloading (cleaning up space on the harddisk), and most likely people are less likely to seed rar files because you already have the unrared version somewhere else on the harddisk.

Is there any good reasons to rar torrent files at all?
