This is an eboot file for PSP of Spyro The Dragon from the PSONE, you will need Dark_Alex's OE custom firmware to run this.  Runs perfect, unlike the other Spyro torrent floating around, the music does not skip!  I ripped this myself from a new copy of the game. ^^  Has image files too so you can tell what it is on your PSP.

EDIT

As others have said, you will need to change the file name to EBOOT.PBP, but that's a given for Eboot files. ^^;
