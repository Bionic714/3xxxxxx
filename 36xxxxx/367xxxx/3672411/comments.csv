,made07,2008-01-04T18:58Z,"then just don't use the cue if it doesn't work for you! you only need it for burning back to cdda if you care about gaps displayed on your player. if you don't care whether it shows '-'-times (-0.02, -0.01, ...) you can just as well burn the flacs, it'll sound perfectly the same.

that said, it probably just doesn't work with your software... try Burrrn! and it'll work. Alternatively, as said above, delete the cue and don't worry about it anymore."
