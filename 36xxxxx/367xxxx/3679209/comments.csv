,mike18xx,2007-05-03T21:29Z,Brought to you by an inconsiderate bastard who couldn't be trouble to spend a couple minutes un-RARing before making his torrent. Much better for *thousands* of people to waste a couple minutes each.
,Callistox87,2007-05-03T22:05Z,"mike18xx - Fuck you.

Why don't you reupload the movie then                             unrarred? I'll tell you why, because you are a lazy fuck that just leeches and whines when something isn't perfect.

Get off of this website, society doesnt need people like you. Cunt."
,mike18xx,2007-05-03T22:13Z,"Fuck you right back.

I *am* going to re-upload it, just as soon as I have it. If piratebay permitted user-torrent searches, you'd see that I've three full pages' worth of uploads here.

Meanwhile, it's a pity ""Deity"" also couldn't be bothered to use to the x264 encoding standard (rather than long-in-the-tooth XviD) -- as is required in their own site's new FAQ."
,mike18xx,2007-05-03T22:23Z,Someone has already posted an unRARed copy: dem(remove)onoid.com/files/download/HTTP/1142001/3277073

Have you even read that document? It says to use rar, to store as rar, to not repack and to unrar it every time you want to watch something ? that's laughable ? but it doesn't say why! I know it's a workaround for a weakness in DirectConnect but this is BitTorrent! Still it's much less bullshit than hardsubbing which in most cases utterly destroys the movies for me ? so thank you for not doing that."
