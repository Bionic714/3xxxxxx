Dead Man's Walk [1996]


This was originally a TV series that was made into a 3 part movie. Each part is around 6 episodes each. I've included the trailer, so watch that if you're not sure if you want to watch it or not, but in my opinion the trailer doesn't show the movie anywhere near as good as it actually is.
I personally give this 9.5/10, it has everything you could ask for in a western, plus more!
Just so you know, the DVD didn't come with subtitles.
I ripped this movie myself, so if you have any complaints, suggestions, or comments about it, the quality or whatever, leave a message :]
