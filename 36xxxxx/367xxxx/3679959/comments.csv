,nyck2007,2008-02-29T22:47Z,"wow...thanks for this one...even it is merely a glimp of fallout atmosphere i will anytime play even a shitty piece that resembles any fallout game anytime...i'm really afraid that bethesda will ruin those fallout games into that fuckin oblivion or that kind...i mean oblivion it's ok...but why all the games be like that, overly colorfull and super dupper graphics for the happines of 8 years old pups?...hope it will be ok in the end...i'm not a heavy gamer but i really really love this game..."

,Frice,2008-10-22T17:52Z,"Will Fallout 3 (from beth) Suck in terms of a fun game to play?

No. It will be enjoyable, a little better than Bioshock imo because of the sandbox aspect to it and the storyline/mythology is better known from F1/F2 (because they were so amazing).
[yay for leeching off the success of others!]

Will Fallout 3 have the same style of gameplay and rhythym to it as the Black Isle counterparts.

No.

It is meant for people that would prefer Diablo over Morrowwind which substantially lowers the difficulty of the game in terms of patience and tactics because they are catering to the lowest common denominator of gamers (the console users).

Was fallout 1/2 ever realeased for console? No.
The only fallout title to be realeased to console SUCKED but it was the last ghasps of black isle trying to make some money so we can't really be to mean.

In conclusion yes Fallout 3 is going to be fun especially if you kinda liked the original fallouts but weren't that hardcore about it.

Everyone that picked up fallout 1 back in the late 90's and played it in such a way that makes WOW gamers look harmless are going to be downright pissed at how this game works. No turnbased combat (which was the cornerstone of fallout 1/2 (and to a degree tactics). Not to mention the creator of Fallout 3 (bethesda) said that he didn't think monty python type humour belonged in a fallout game or a game in general that was at all serious.

Look it up fallout fans. Fallout 3 doesnt believe in Monty Python. 
And queue the angry comments!

,w33n,2009-03-17T17:37Z,"The funny is you can find the unfinished version of Van Buren on the internets.

Just google ""Van Buren Cancelled Download""
There's a shitload of bugs, i.e attacking an enemy will make the game exit."
