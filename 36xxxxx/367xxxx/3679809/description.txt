For her second album in almost a decade, Charlotte Gainsbourg (also an actress known for films such as My Wife is an Actress, The Science of Sleep and 21 Grams) teams up with both Air and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker (who, incidentally, also worked with Air on their 2007 album Pocket Symphony) to provide a downtempo selection of romantic, moody, introspective songs on a surprisingly diverse range of topics. These begin with the glamorous plane crash of AF607105, and stretch out to musings on morning on 5:55, or explorations of childhood on Little Monsters.

Charlotte Gainsbourg's previous works:
Lemon Incest (1998)
