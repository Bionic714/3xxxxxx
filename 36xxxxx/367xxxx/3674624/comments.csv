,Diodecity,2007-05-28T12:21Z,Thanx man. Lots a good stuff!
,hobachit,2007-06-19T10:37Z,"I really appreciate the effort to collect all of these tracks but the sound quality on some tracks(90+)is not very high. Being 50 something I decided to run the tracks thru EncSpot Pro to check my ancient hearing against another info source and discovered the tracks were collected and encoded in many places and were not ripped from the CDs by one person.  Please be aware that many early MP3 encoders SUCK and even a quality encoder like LAME can make a bad sounding mp3 if you use the wrong settings.
  Please take these things into consideration when you submit a 1.5 GB torrent and try to give a heads up so people (especially on dialup) can make an informed choice.
Thanks.
