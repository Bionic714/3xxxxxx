This download is going to start VERY slow, until I complete a prior upload. I merely wanted to get it up so all of you with my RIP, dont bother downloading the other version Dragon Storm.

This again, WORKS with ALL versions of SP2.

Cheers."

,noekk,2007-04-25T23:38Z,"""I did resample about 300mb of very short vids.
decreasing the size of vids by only ~ 150mb""

What does that mean ? Did ""dopeman"" alter the original game ?

I thought the scene release for this was from the great RELOADED ?

Who is this ""dopeman"" guy anyway ? I see his name on a lot of shit."

,Eclipse8804,2008-06-29T22:02Z,Hey used ur version of the first game in this series worked great many thanks. downloaded this one and then unzipped to the folder with the games files. It apparently had created its own folder so i copied and pasted these files into the other folder and allowed them to replace any that were there as told but now when i try to open the application it just says it has stopped working and doesn t continue. Any suggestions? I allowed the application to replace as well even though it was much smaller?
,tikkig0d,2008-08-01T03:57Z,"eclipse, most likley you replaced these files with the main game files? you need to reinstall the original game install the addon to its own folder then actually go into all the sub folders in the add-on, copy the files in there and find the folders by the same name your game folder then paste. its really not that hard to understand. you should have noticed when it asked you if you want to replace the game files"
,tikkig0d,2008-08-01T03:58Z,not folders....files....copy the files

Win 7 doesn't permit drivers that are not digitally signed.  You have to disable that at boot up by pressing F8 and selecting the appropriate option."
