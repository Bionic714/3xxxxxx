,rsssorincs,2007-05-03T07:20Z,"It is a beta version, which means that the producer is still testing it, but that does not mean that it doesn't work great. You can also download it from www.kaspersky.com with a 2 month license key. The good thing is that I have found out from here about version 7.0.0.55 and 7.0.0.60 and not from the official web site. :)"
