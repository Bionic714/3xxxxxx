Bootleg Comments:
An awesome show by all 3 bands (Machine Head, Megadeth, Heaven & Hell)
Incredible show. Tony Iommi is the man, what else is there to say?
There was about 5 or so different banners that people threw up onto the stage throughout the concert and gave to Ronnie in which you can sometimes hear him talking about. At the very end of the show, right after Neon Knights is finished playing some guy gets on stage and goes up and hugs Tony Iommi, Ronnie James Dio & Geezer Butler before a security guard completely swallows him whole and drags him off the stage lol.
El Cajon is a suburb of San Diego.

Bootleg Proof Comments:
At 6:00 on "After All" Ronnie James Dio says "This must be San Diego!"
At 15:41 on "Heaven & Hell" Ronnie James Dio says "Cheers San Diego"
