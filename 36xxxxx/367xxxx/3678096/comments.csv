,dmsuperman,2007-05-07T05:42Z,"Zombie, that's not the right folder. Go to My Computer, then C:\, then Program Files, then either Siarra\FEAR or just FEAR. Paste it over the other fear.exe in that folder (backup the oroginal just in case)"
,oden74,2007-07-28T14:24Z,You can look for the FEAR  No CD/DVD crack
,madcapper66,2008-02-13T10:46Z,Don't bother with this.  There are no sources past 97.2% and the download stops so it's a waste of time.
