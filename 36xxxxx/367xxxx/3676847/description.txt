Recode by khanibal at cinematik. Thanks to him !

Menu is untouched and french subs are the first subtitle track. So if you hit eng subs on the menu, french subs will be activated. To view it with eng subs you'll have to hit the subtitles button of your remote.

Now enjoy and please seed. Don't hit and run if you want me to upload more stuff.
