Working.... Seeding

Thanks heaps, guys

:)"
,xyz001,2007-04-30T20:33Z,"What to do when you are in the ""active by phone"" dialog?

Do you have to call the number?

Im not shure how to use the serial generator. Can anyone help?"
,xyz001,2007-04-30T20:40Z,"Sorry i was a bit slow.....

What you have to do is:

When you reach the ""activate by phone"" dialog you just enter the activation number in the serial generator, and then press activate.

Then you get a new number, that you can fill in the dialog.

It works!

Thanks alot!"
,VladimirMolotov,2007-05-01T11:37Z,The activation is not working. I get the Invalid number error each time. :-(
,VladimirMolotov,2007-05-01T11:42Z,I'm sorry....I pressed the generate serial instad of the activate button. It works perfectly! Thanks guys!
,acell2001,2007-05-01T11:54Z,"fantastic!

works a treat.. if you can't figure it out, you shouldn't be using a PC"
,bvdh,2007-05-01T20:16Z,"Jus to be sure.. Is this for Web or Design premium? on which torrent of the software package have used this keygen without any problems? 

Thnx Bart"
,duskom,2007-05-02T12:38Z,This is for design premium suite
,bvdh,2007-05-02T13:50Z,"Dear All,

When I start the program it askes me to enter the product serial code. I've entered the one from this keymaker. After that it asks me to activate it via the internet? What do I have to do with this? May be a bit of a stupid question, but i'm new here.... Thnx in advance!

regards,

Bart"
,duskom,2007-05-02T14:28Z,"@bvdh 

You should select Advanced or More Options or something similar, I don't remember and select Activation by phone.

When you reach the ""activate by phone"" dialog you just enter the activation number in the serial generator, and then press activate.

Then you get a new number, that you can fill in the dialog. "
,bvdh,2007-05-02T15:18Z,"Thnx!

This works perfectly! awesome! Gonna have a lot of fun now! Is it ok to let the programm update itself or should I block the internet acces?

,dvint1,2007-05-22T10:18Z,"hmm I keep getting a red cross when I enter the serial.

Any ideas?

I did get a green tick with this, tho I have no activation code then:
1045-1082-8042-9666-8675-7102"
,Bloodsplatter,2007-05-24T18:49Z,"I keep getting red crosses, what should I do?"
,headhonchousa,2007-05-25T21:06Z,none of the generated serialz works - all I get is red x's
,duskom,2007-05-29T18:34Z,"Ok people, for those who are not aware how the key gen works.

After installing Adobe CS3, start some of the applications, let?s say Photoshop. 

Use the Keygen to generate serial number by pressing Generate Serial button.

Step two is to enter that serial in the CS3, and click next. The page for activation will show up. Click the More options link, select By Telephone and click OK/Next.

On a new page pay attention on a code written below the serial number you just have entered. Copy it. Change to Keygen window and paste it in the field bellow the Generate Serial button. Click the button Activate.  

After you press the Activate button, text:  ?Let me know your request first, then Press GenBtn to get your Serial!? will be replaced with the activation code. Enter it in the Activation code field in the CS3 suite window, and click OK/Next.

That?s about it."
,b0zie,2007-06-01T13:09Z,"I don't think these serials work on CS3 Design Premium for OSX..

I used my PC-laptop to generate the serials, and 0/10 didnt work.

Any other suggestions?"
,b0zie,2007-06-01T13:10Z,"""0/10 didn't work"" :P 

I guess you understood what i meant. No serials gave me the green V.."
,duskom,2007-06-01T13:49Z,"I guess this one is for Windows only as stated in nfo file:

PLATFORM      : WiNALL 

I saw on demonoid that there is mac design premium download with serial, maybe you should try thatone"
,b0zie,2007-06-01T16:01Z,"I found this serial;

http://rapidshare dot com/files/28888330/Adobe_Design_Premium_keygen.rar

and it worked :)"
,shadedred,2007-06-02T15:17Z,"bozie,

did that work on the trial version directly from adobe? and what app from the creative suite exactly? i can't seem to get any serials working in osx"
,jaredbomb,2007-06-02T21:49Z,"duskom at 2007-05-29 18:34 CET:

What you said here is perfect.

I finally got it to stop saying I only had 30 days to get it registered.

Thanks!"
,DBrooke,2007-06-05T20:56Z,"Okay everyone, I'm an idiot. I downloaded this thing and now have no idea how to make it work. I don't even know what to do with it. Can someone please clue me in here?"
,ArnWaldan,2007-06-11T04:43Z,"Thanks a lot team !
All works fine with the Full Magnitude Release !"
,ArnWaldan,2007-06-11T04:46Z,"It works fine with the Web release :
Once the Magnitude Release files are overwrited by the Released Patched ones, i used your keymaker, chosen by telephone,  and all works fine !
Thanks."
,Bucca-Gerry,2007-06-13T13:59Z,"Great work TEAM Z.W.T , it works like a charm. 

Thanks to duskom for posting & for the great directions for us dumbasses!!  
Good Shit!!"
,scunky,2007-06-17T18:38Z,"dead link!!!!
what a load of SHIT"
,moezeke,2007-07-12T14:37Z,"For Duskom: remarks 2007-05-29
I achieved the fist step and generated a serial number.
But I failed to find ""the CS3"" for the 2nd step, and thus the ""page for activation"" in which I should find ""More options"""
,moezeke,2007-07-19T10:04Z,"Could it be that I made the mistake of installing the trialversion before I generated a key?
The screen gives me the choice between 'Continue with the evaluation version' or: 'I have a serial key number'."
,duskom,2007-07-21T00:05Z,"@moezeke 

Try with I have a serial key option and then try to activate. If that dosen't work deinstall entire suite and install again and enter serial at th einstallation process"
,ShadowKlown,2007-07-24T08:36Z,It's doesn't matter if it works or not if noone seeds ;)
,moezeke,2007-07-26T15:37Z,"for Duskom
Thanks for the hint. I uninstalled the complete CS3 and reinstalled it, using dreamweaver. But the program apparently recognized the existence of a prior trial version and confronted me with the same window, where I could only ""continue the evaluation version"".
I try again with an other component, "
,bananaboy17,2007-09-21T02:06Z,"When I entered the serial number generated upon pushing ""Generate Serial"", the dialog box in Adobe transfered me to a screen that said the serial number is an ""upgrade"" serial number. It then asked me for the serial number for the product that I already own. I'm not sure what to do here. I can't find where to select the ""activate by phone"" option. Can anyone advise?"
,bananaboy17,2007-09-21T02:36Z,"Got it to work. Re the 'serial number on an older product' problem I had. A friend of mine provided me with some old serial numbers, which worked as an Adobe 7 Prof. number (various number generators online, but the programs may contain viruses, I understand). I used the serial number given, and was told that I couldn't activate online, but must activate by phone. I was given an activation number, which I entered into the program provided here, pressed 'activate' and was given an activation number which worked."
,ruandriy,2007-11-03T15:53Z,"Don't download this shit. I has a virus, backdoor. Bitches! "
,hyphen79,2008-01-25T00:27Z,"All you people need to do is run a scan on the keygen on www.virustotal.com. It's the most thurough scan site out there. Whenever I run a scan on this file, I get 4 hits.. 2 of 'em say ""suspicious file/worm/trojan"" -- the other 2 sites say ""Virus.Win32.Agent.HGE"" and ""Heuristic: Suspicious File With Code Injection Technology"".. If that doesn't scream ""Hi, I'm a file, and I contain a VIRUS"", then I don't know what does.. ;-) BEWARE! I really don't know why n00bs feel the need to attach trojans/malicious files to keygens. Friggin' idiots."
,djchad818,2008-01-31T21:32Z,"This contains no virus. Either you guys are propagandists working for the software companies(which seems likely, considering your strong remarks trying to establish your intellect), or you don't understand that some scanners will hit on just about anything. Either way, I have a solid history on this site, and I'm saying this is not a virus."
,djchad818,2008-01-31T21:34Z,"For that matter, this works so well, it even let me run the updater."
,yurt101,2008-05-03T13:54Z,"if anyone is an idiot its probably you.. because every keygen out there.. pretty much.. will be red as a viruse through most all ""not everyone"" but most all.. anti virus programs.. for the most part.. avg hasn't detected it as a virus.. but avast for the most part will read any keygen as a trojan.. and you can belive me or not i know the truth cuz ive downloaded them all and they work just fine no problems at all pc never crashed once"
,Ondonttr,2008-06-22T12:02Z,nice upload works perfectly had no troubles.
,m8s,2008-08-03T14:39Z,"when i click on the keygen program it says that i do not have the permision to open it, and i can't find the key to enter it..!

yes it works thank you"
,Shannaranelf,2008-10-29T15:41Z,"ok. I downloaded and used keygen. I type in web premium and design premium to give me keys.

They do not work on installation get big X.  also the keygen has this activation button on bottom left corner. I thought maybe I get key then click activate. but this doesn't do anything either. PLz help. I am confused. I followed your very minute instructions and it's still not working"
,slickjesus,2009-11-19T16:01Z,duskom on page 1 of comments nails it. Until I found his comment I couldn't pour water from a hammer if the instructions were written on my head.
,themate,2010-01-31T15:21Z,"Works quite fine unlike other i tried. Just, need to run it while nod32 disabled. nod32 keep deleting keymaker because it thinks the file is ""probably"" an agent/trojan. 

disable nod32, use the keymaker and keep it in the rar file for further uses."
