,thesmokestack,2007-04-30T01:59Z,amazing experimental adventure music game. my favourite dreamcast game! apparently there is some talk about creating a new REZ for the current gen consoles.
,deusmeister,2007-06-17T06:24Z,"Uhh, why are there 18 files if you only need one of them to play? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm new to this type of thing..."
,domientius,2007-06-19T10:28Z,those are the compressed RAR files.
,BrentonSucks,2007-09-07T04:23Z,"Yup. When you download the file, select them all and unrar them all together. They'll extract into one file, which is what you use. 

This makes it easier and smaller.
Happy pirating!"
,administron,2008-03-29T19:41Z,"RARing it is all well and good, but why split it?"
,DZlife,2008-04-12T22:40Z,"@administron:  The files were probably found on a DC Rom/ISO website, which usually hosts the files split, and Hellraisertw probably simply uploaded as is."
,DZlife,2008-04-12T22:41Z,"@thesmokestack:  They already have. A PS2 version was released.
A hi-def version was also released on Xbox Live.

Both versions are true to the original game. The only differences are minor touch-ups."
,fireseed,2008-08-03T11:23Z,"I tried this game once on an emulator (chankast), but couldn't get passed level 7 i think, it kept crashing. Anybody tried on an emu and get passed all the levels?"
,highxfive,2009-06-01T06:52Z,seed!  i miss this game!
,bloodonmysuit,2009-08-01T21:59Z,Is there anyway I can put all these files together? I really don't want to have to burn 18 discs.
