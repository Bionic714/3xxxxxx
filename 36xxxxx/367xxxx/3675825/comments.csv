I support you on your Windows XP Professional
Corporate SP2 intergrated for April 29, 2007.

My name is Eugene. 

I have some questions to ask you if you can
help me with some leads.

I'm from the U.S. and I have downloaded
a Windows XP Corp. SP2 from 2006 and
with product key included. It worked on
2 of the old DELL Lpaptops and an old IBM
laptop.  However, trying to use it on a desktop
with the latest motherboard and Pentium Core
2, it won't accept the downloaded WinXP Corp.
SP2.  It just won't accept it, because from what
I learned that the motherboard and Pentium Core 2 doesn't have it's software unless if
you insrall the ORIGINAL WinXP SP2, instead
of the downloaded ones from Pirate bay.

Now I'm planning to build a desktop PC.

So, my question for you is, if I want to download
YOUR LATEST Windows XP Corp. SP2, do you
know what makes or manufactures on the
motherboard, and pentium processor, like
P4 or CORE 2 that would ACCEPT YOUR
LATEST Windows XP Corp. SP2???

Because I don't want to end up finding out
that the motherboard or pentium core 2 won't
accept it when attempting to install. 

So, I thought that maybe if you know something
out there, other than you couldn't in the U.S.
I thought I could get infos from someone like
you from other country or somewhere in the
U.S. that maybe isn't listed to shop on the
internet, like 'Newegg.com"".

Any suggestions that you might have, would
be helpfull for my NEW desktop PC to be buld.
You can reach me directly at
ECruz68007@aol.com.
Thank you for taking the time to read my inquiry. 
Regards,
Eugene
