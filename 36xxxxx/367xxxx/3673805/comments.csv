LONG LIVE THE CLASSICS!"
,mischiefkop,2008-02-02T12:03Z,"honestly not worth the effort, took forever to download, of 19 files only seven are worth anything. had to convert each of the seven episodes before I could burn them off on discs with Divx, and even then the playback quality was horrible. thanks for the effort but you need to restructure this torrent"
,Kzin,2008-11-15T22:14Z,"mischiefkop, I disagree, this is a DVD, cant get much better quality than that.  No added compression, thats why its sooooo big.  Worth the wait.  I'll seed, I've got T1."
,Kzin,2008-11-15T22:16Z,"Oh I should add, I used VLC to play the files directly so I don't have to burn a DVD.  Perhaps you lose quality because you are using DivX?  Perhaps its because you aren't used to the grainy quality of classics?"
,daniell83,2009-12-28T15:33Z,greatttt dvd pleaseeee more seeds more more :D  better portuguese subs :D :D :D
