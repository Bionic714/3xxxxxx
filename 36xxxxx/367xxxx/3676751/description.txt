There is only one true God (Isa 44:6, 8; 46:9). Thus, only one true religion. Scripture declares "all gods of the nations are idols" (Ps 96:5). All false religion and idolatry is by definition involved in demon worship - whether or not the participants recognize it (Acts 26:18). Hence Paul's concern. The spiritual power and reality behind idols involves demons (I Cor 10:20, Ps 106:37). The Bible tells us to shun occultic practices.
