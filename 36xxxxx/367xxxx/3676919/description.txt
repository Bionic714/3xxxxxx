PROPER REASONS:
Yeah we know this is a few days late but no one else propered it and it's been
nuked for a couple days now. Luckily CTV iN Canada airs this show on Sunday
afternoons so we can swoop in and grab a better copy after the fact.
It seems Scrubs always suffers from less then stellar encodes. Anyways, LOL's 
release suffers from massive video breakdowns in the last minute of the show 
causing missed dialogue, missed visuals and well ruins JD's voiceover. Time code
of these errors is 20:17 till the end. As always visual proof can be found in the 
Sample directory. Just another reason to trade samples folks.
