The Kinks were an English rock group formed in 1963 by lead singer-songwriter Ray Davies and his brother, lead guitarist and vocalist, Dave Davies. The band's early hard-driving singles set a standard in the mid-1960s for Rock & Roll, while albums such as Face to Face,[1] Something Else, Village Green, Arthur and Muswell Hillbillies are highly regarded by fans, critics, and peers alike, and are considered amongst the most influential recordings of the era.[2] In the United States, The Kinks are categorised as a British Invasion band, along with the other members of the so-called Big Four (The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who). Despite being less commercially successful than these three contemporaries, the band is frequently cited as one of the most important and influential rock bands of all time.

This album features the Kink's greatest work.  It is a marvellous tribute to the instrumental and vocal vitality of the band and a salute to the exceptional writing skill of Ray Davies.  It is a definitive collection which captures the Kinks at their very best and showcases the versatillity of their output.

Released 1989 BMG.
