By request, here is the full DvD version of John Waters\' Hairspray. This is the first film he did with Rikki Lake, and the very last movie Divine ever made, before he died of a heart attack, the day after this movie opened.

Although it\'s not as hard core as much of Waters\' stuff, it\'s still quirky enough for  everyone to enjoy.

As always, PLEASE SEED!

Cheers,
