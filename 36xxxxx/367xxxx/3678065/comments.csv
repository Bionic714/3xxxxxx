You've been so kind, I'm look forward downloading more of your John Waters films soon, take care!"
,radagastb,2007-05-08T11:09Z,"Straticus, I know, I nag all the time, but it would be really nice if you also uploaded Psycho Mom. My John Waters collection will so soon be complete...;)"
,Straticus,2007-05-11T08:52Z,"Rad, it's ok, you don't nag, you just ask me to upload films you want to see :)

Unfortunately, Psycho Mom isn't one of them. I prefer his older, less main-stream stuff...I am going to upload really twisted, older films of his in the next week or so...Look for:

Mondo Trasho
Eat Your Makeup
Multiple Maniacs

If you like the twisted, dark side of John Waters, you'll LOVE these...They're old black and whites, done long before Pink flamingos...

Watch for them in the next week or so

Strat"
,MisterKing,2007-05-16T17:40Z,"Wow dude! If you would upload the really old stuff, that would be so great! Pink Flamingo's was my favorite, but maybe this other old stuff is even better?"
,guppygrrl,2007-06-14T20:57Z,"Oh, I adore Multiple Maniacs!  Have you uploaded that yet?"
,txguy49,2007-07-14T10:49Z,I love eat your makeup!!! please upload that one i seen it years when i was a kid.

,Art_Vendelay,2007-12-03T06:17Z,"i downloaded the NJT relewase of another torrent site & when it went to unpack it, computer siad there were no files to unpack...wasted 4gb...can anyone confirm that this one works, my mom really wants to see this version"
,bhobson333,2008-01-13T16:08Z,"Download complete, DVD works like a charm.

I had to create the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folders and put the extracted files into VIDEO_TS, but after that ImgTool created a working image & the DVD looks good.

Thanks for the post!  I was hoping to find the 1988 version to show my daughters what the original movie looked like."
