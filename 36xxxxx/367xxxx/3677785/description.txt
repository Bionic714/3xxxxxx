Description: This is Antonioni's powerful drama about alienation of the individual and psychological anxiety in the over-industrialized modern world. Set against the bleak landscape of an industrial zone in Italy, an emotionally disturbed woman strives to find solace and peace in an environment that has become intolerant of human emotion. Antonioni's amazing use of color only adds to the impression of an artificial world that lacks any true color. It is the use of color in this film that impressed Fellini enough to start using color in his own films. Much can be also be said about Carlo Savina's experimental musical score.

Ripped from the russian Prestige Film DVD. Not my rip. This is a much better looking replacement of my VHS-rip torrent.
