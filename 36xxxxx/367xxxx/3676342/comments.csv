,Tieden,2007-09-12T17:38Z,Yeah I'm wondering that too. Should we use some boot disk for this?
,Mok3sp33d,2007-10-31T10:31Z,Get the utopia boot disc.  It's free.  Just find it on the internets.
,thepiratemonk3y,2008-06-21T20:41Z,"all CDI images are by default self boot, or at least they should be."
,cdtext,2009-01-29T01:03Z,How about trying Utopia Boot 1.2 ?
,cdtext,2009-01-29T01:04Z,Does anyone know of a boot disk which is VGA compatible? Utopia 1.1 and 1.2 are not. I've got both.
,jNerd,2009-03-26T21:30Z,This doesn't require a boot-disc. I used DiscJuggler & it works fine on my DC. REMEMBER TO SEED. I am seeding until 4/20. Keep the DC alive by sharing with your fellow gamer.

,demongodcrush,2009-07-27T00:55Z,I can't burn it for some reason. Clone cd doesn't even recognize it as a valid file. Someone plz advise.
