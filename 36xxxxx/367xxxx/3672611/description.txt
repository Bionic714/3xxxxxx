A really touching story about Spider-Man looking back on his relationship with Gwen, and how it opened his heart for his relationship with Mary Jane.

I tracked this down after a website recommended it, and stripped it out of the back of a Webspinners comic. Then I ran each page through a few Photoshop filters to get rid of the old, grainy look. I think it's been restored pretty well.
