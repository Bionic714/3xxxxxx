CLASSIFIED, CENSORED, & SUPPRESSED



HISTORY MAY BE REVISED EVEN AS IT IS BEING WRITTEN



\"Evidence of Revision\" is a 5-DVD, 8 hour long documentary series whose purpose is to present the publicly unavailable and even suppressed historical audio, video, and film recordings largely unseen by the American public relating to the assassination of the Kennedy brothers, the little known classified \"Black Ops\" actually used to intentionally create the massive war in Viet Nam, the CIA \"mind control\" programs and their involvement in the RFK assassination and the Jonestown massacre and other important truths of our post-modern time.



The U.S. Government\'s Orwellian \"Office of Public Diplomacy\" has been in existence in various forms and under various names since World War ONE. The union of American governance and American corporate interests began in Abraham Lincoln\'s day and the massaging of \"public truth\" began even before the Roman Empire. The more you know about \"real history\" versus \"official history\", the better equipped you are to see behind the lies of our times, even as they are told to you. Some of us knew what was really happening even before the second plane hit the tower.



\"Evidence of Revision\" sweeps \"official truth\" into the dustbin of history.
