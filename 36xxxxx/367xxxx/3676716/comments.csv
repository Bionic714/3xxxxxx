,stinkhole,2007-04-30T06:07Z,"Michael Hedges, an acoustic guitarist and composer known for his unusual two-handed picking style, was killed in an automobile crash. He was 43. Hedges died in a one-car crash on State Route 128 in rural Mendocino County, about 100 miles northwest of San Francisco.


A fund for his two children has been set up. Hedges did not have an insurance policy, so any extra money would be a boon to them. Please send donations to:
