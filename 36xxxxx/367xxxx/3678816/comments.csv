,tptxo,2008-08-05T00:13Z,"What version is this?
I (used to) have the CD and some of the pieces here is different. Also, Amelie is one of my fave movies I watch it again and again I lost count, but I never heard some of the pieces in this torrent on the movie.

Here, some different tracks I noticed:
La noyee: Longer, sounds like a live session? And the crowds applaud at the end?
A quai: Longer, with additional tunes at the start.
La dispute: What is this??? Completely different song here. Who is that singing??
Sur le fil: Longer, with additional tunes at the start.
La valse des montres: Different instrument.

Well, anyway this is a nice addition for my Amelie addictive mind, lol. Thx"
,tptxo,2008-08-05T00:26Z,"Okay... so I googled the lyric I in this torrent's La dispute (yes this one has lyric, not instrumental). Guess what, it is Yann Tiersen song and it's called La dispute too, but it's definitely not Amelie OST.
Or is it? huh?"
