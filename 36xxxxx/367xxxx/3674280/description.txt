Dick Strawbridge and his son James venture out from New House Farm 
in Cornwall to meet aspiring individuals and families who want to 
try and make their lives greener. 

Eco-campsite sisters Jake and Candy get their wind-turbine in 
Cornwall, but not before being tested by Dick on their knowledge of 
electricity. 

How do you insulate a centuries old cottage if you still want to enjoy 
the timber beams? In Lincolnshire, we meet Zannah and Arthur who 
discover that going green in a conservation area isn't easy. They've 
got their solar panel, but will they be allowed to keep it? 

In Somerset, we meet the Warrens, who with Dick's help start 
sustainable livestock farming when they get their first Gloucester Old Spot pigs.
