At the end of the 1985 World Slavery Tour Iron Maiden took 6 months off, in the meanwhile Mr. Adrian Smith with no personal life in that moment only musical life decide to work in a solo project with the help of Nicko Mc Brain, they started jamming with some friends like Dave Colwell: guitars (Samson) the one who wrote Reach Out (Wasted Years B-side), Andy Barnnet: Guitars (Urchin & FM) he is part of the writers of That Girl (Stranger in a strange land B-side) & Martin Connoly (Nicko's Friend), their set includes songs from all the members and some covers from Thin Lizzy, ZZ top and two Adrian's songs Lady & Silver & Gold.

Nicko arranged two gigs one under the name The Entire population of Hackney & other under the name The Sherman Tankers. This Audience recording was taken from the first show and was the beginning of ASAP (Adrian Smith & Project), Bruce Dickinson & Steve Harris joined the band on stage only for the Encores: Losfer words, 2 minutes to midnight, Rosalie & Tush.

As you can see 3 guitars is not new for Iron Maiden members (This also happened at the 1992 Donington Festival when Adrian Joined the band for Running Free as you can hear in the official recording).

Anyway this is not the full show the song Lady is missed by the bootleg company and you can find this one on the other version of this bootleg London Secret Gig.
