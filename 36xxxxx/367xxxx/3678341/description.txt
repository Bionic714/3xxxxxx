Review
Cap De Craniu's first ep is what we'd call a good way to start!  
This album can be described as a powerful blend of grind and metalcore with some black and techno-death flavors. The lyrics range from sarcastic and funny to highly macabre and are delivered by a voice assembled of screams, pig squeals and whispers.   
Support the independent artists and buy what you like!
