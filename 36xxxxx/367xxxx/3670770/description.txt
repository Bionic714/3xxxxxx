Movie description: 

Plot: The lovely Ching Li and handsome Chang I star as star-and-sword-crossed comrades who take on the vicious Black Tigers gang in a quest for hidden wealth.

Overview: ?Without a doubt,? it was written in the seminal Study Of The Swordplay Film, ?Hsu Cheng-hung is one of the key figures in the Mandarin new style.? And this is both one of his key films and one of his last for Shaw Brothers. The lovely Ching Li and handsome Chang I star as star-and-sword-crossed comrades who take on the vicious Black Tigers gang in a quest for hidden wealth. There?s action galore, until the final, fiery fight in a temple of treasure.
