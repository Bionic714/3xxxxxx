,Karl Mundt,2007-05-01T09:43Z,And what is the Pasolini connection? He didn't direct or write it.
[T],Artleo,2007-05-01T09:57Z,"> Karl Mundt. Pier Paolo Pasolini did write and did direct it. Original title is ""Il Fiore delle mille e una notte"".

,roma_barca,2007-05-01T12:15Z,"FRENCH SUBS BY LUCK ???

GREAT MOVIE :!"
,Karl Mundt,2007-05-01T14:03Z,"Artleo, thanks. I see the words 'trilogy', 'Decameron' and 'Canterbury Tales' in the description so it might be Arabian Nights (part of that trilogy). Still, i looked up Las Mil y Una Noches on imdb and it is a film from 1958. ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241725/ ), so i'm still not sure what doesn't fit here: the title or the description?

,kovesp,2007-05-01T22:07Z,"If its Pasolini than presumably it is this: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071502/. 

Does anyone know if there are subtitles?"
,Karl Mundt,2007-05-02T12:36Z,"Looking at the preview, it is Arabian Nights. I believe there are two subtitle tracks: one is Spanish and the other one Italian."
,roma_barca,2007-05-03T18:38Z,"Karl Mundt, or someone else : when you know the langage/subtitles, could you inform us ? Because my Hard Disk is too small...I could make unbelievable efforts if there was french subs...

There is only one Pasolini movie : ""1001 notte"", this is it, superb ! I can only recommand it !"
,givemeitall69,2008-03-14T20:19Z,everyone is stuck on 83%. thee have been NO SEEDS for 3 weeks now. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
,monkeystuff68,2008-08-21T13:54Z,"FYI: this DVD comes only with Castellano subtitles or dub. No English.

I have a poor ripped copy of the film with EN subtitles. Does anyone know how to plug them in? Can one combine the two somehow?"
