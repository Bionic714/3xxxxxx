,randyass,2007-10-26T12:11Z,"Why doesn't it work on my computer?!:/
I have VLC, I opened the movie in VLC and it started playing. Then I draged the subtitle-file into the VLC player, but then the movie just stopped and it won't play again. I tried to stop the movie before I draged the subtitle-file into it, but that didn't work eighter.
Can anybody help me please?:)"
