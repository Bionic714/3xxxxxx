[===== Stuff =====]

Vampire - Darkstalkers Collection

PS2 DVD game, originally NTSC Japan disc, never released outside of Japan.  I rebuilt this as NTSC for America and to remove over 3GB of garbage data.  I can't translate to English because I don't know Japanese, but fortunately you don't need to read to play the games!  The only other torrents available before I released this are Japanese NTSC, might not boot on USA consoles, and unzip to the full 4.37 GB which makes for a bad play disc.

FYI, lowering the size helps the disc load faster, more reliably, gives fewer read errors, and reduces stuttering that's otherwise present when games stream like the GTA series or when streaming audio from the disc.

I did add a single dummy file to cross the 600,000 sector boundary, otherwise the PS2 mastering tool doesn't allow DVD builds, but I only had to add 300MB.  No, it wouldn't have fit on a CD, but PS2s prefer DVD media to CDs anyway.  Someday I'll crack Sony's tool to ignore the 600k sector requirement.

Please be patient while downloading, and please stay online until this gets a few distributed copies.  My upload bandwidth is terrible at the moment compared to my downstream.  Thank you.


[===== What to Do Next =====]

Run the EXE file to extract.

Burn to DVD at the slowest speed your burner supports, or at 4x.  I recommend certified Taiyo Yuden media, which is even better than Ritek RiData.

Plays perfectly on any properly modded PS2, including fliptop/Slim Kit with Swap Magic DVD.


[===== Bit Twiddling =====]

Packaged as a self-extracting UHArc archive, better than ZIP and RAR all around, much faster than 7zip and usually the same compression as well.
