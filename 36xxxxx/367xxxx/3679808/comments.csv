Why don`t you go give your father a rimjob instead of posting stupid comments on torrents you don`t like.
Fucking `tard!!
I hope you get cancer in the head a die a horrible death kicking and screaming.
Your parents should be touring schools all over the world preaching proper condom use between brothers and sisters."

,space.ghost,2007-05-08T10:19Z,"As Fuckface Frankie so eloquently illustrates (reluctantly, but still): You have to have an IQ of 60 and a pitbull on steroids personality in order to enjoy this movie. I would think that mr Fuckface himself is a deaply disturbed sadist serialkiller (or wannabe) and use this movie to jerk of to. It's the only explanation that makes any sense, to why he would defend the quality of the movie to that extent. 

Watch the movie at your own risk. I turned it of after less than ten minutes. It's a flick for people stripped of empathy and compassion. It's just an orgie of senseless violance without any analysis or meaning. It was not only deaply disturbing to watch but it's also an extremely lousy movie. Bad acting and no storyboard. The movie is about a bunch of hillbillies torturing and raping other hillbillies, thats it. Be thee warned!!"
,dr.drndrn,2007-07-26T01:04Z,"I liked it and the music was great.
Its not for everybody some people like this and other think"" I know what you did.../Scream"" is very good...NOT !"
,doggelito0,2007-09-10T22:41Z,"Great movie,but it will get better if u see House of 1000 corpses first =D"
,DingoDude,2008-11-19T19:35Z,"This movie is GREAT.
Got a bad taste in my mouth, though.. but still...
Great music as well.
Rob Zombie makes Tarantino look like a child..heh..
I highly recomand this movie..
But not for fragile people...
