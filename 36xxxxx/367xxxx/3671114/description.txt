In the early 70's, before we knew "Doom Metal", there was "Downer Rock" which encompassed the Sabbathian sounds of the time (Iron Claw, Monument, Hard Stuff, etc). Iron Claw definitely applies to the terminology of the time, with hard, negative blues riffing, awesome guitar work and some cool use of the mellotron . These Scots were compatriots, some say rip-offs of Sabbath and Budgie, but it's damn good anyway. "Ugly music for ugly droogs".
