Sorry I took so long to reply. Piratebay doesn't alert me to comments.

I managed to track down the info for the Beethoven Concerto only. I'm afraid the Sonata recordings you mentioned came from compilation cds from back when detailed filenames weren't important to me :(

The Concerto is played by Stefan Vladar with the Capella Istropolitana orchestra, conducted by Barry Wordsworth.

In future, I will try to make sure there's enough info in each filename for people to search the origin."
