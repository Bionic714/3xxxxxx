,tombaker,2007-05-20T01:03Z,"kris, im a bit new to all this torrent stuff. got the iso installed and emulated, running it in dosbox, did what you said about the game asking for cd but it still asks

any ideas?"
,Kris.NL,2007-05-20T12:32Z,"have you copied the ""bud"" directory  (from the image) to the SH folder on your HDD?

that ""BUD"" directory must stay in the same place as the ""shpath.ini"" file.
The shpath.ini  must look like this:

BUD =BUD\ 
DATA =DATA\ 
ART =ART\ 
SFX =SFX\ 
SPEECH =SPEECH\ 
CINES =CINES\ 
SCEN =SCEN\ 
SAVE =SAVE\"
