Bootleg Comments:
An awesome show by all 3 bands (Machine Head, Megadeth, Heaven & Hell)
Great energy and a great set for the shorter amount of time than Megadeth usually has
Dave only talks a few times as he states why in track #6 "Dave Mustaine Speaks"
El Cajon is a suburb of San Diego.


Bootleg Proof Comments:
At 0:01 on "Holy Wars...The Punishment Due" Dave Mustaine says "There's no place like home"
He's referring to San Diego. He was born in La Mesa, which is another suburb of San Diego.
