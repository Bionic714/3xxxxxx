,Fulgrim,2007-05-03T17:06Z,please split it up and reseed... 
,lespen,2007-10-08T00:07Z,"If you really want them in single tracks, you should pay attention to what I'm saying now:
When you unpack the files, there's a .cue file, open that .cue file in ""Cue-splitter"" it's a program that you can get here: http://www.shareup.com/CUE_Splitter-download-30218.html
Then just make ""Cue-splitter"" split the tracks, and you will have both Hardbass Chapter 10 CDs, but in single songs.
Hope this was helpfull, so we don't have to hear more silly questions about why the CD is one big mix :)"
