Written in 1959, this book gives about 115 chemical demonstrations varying from fiery explosions to colorful and loud. These experiments should not be practiced without extreme care; they are very dangerous (particularly those using white phosphorous, currently used by the U.S. military "to illuminate battlefields"). Recommended for chemical educators and stuntmen.
