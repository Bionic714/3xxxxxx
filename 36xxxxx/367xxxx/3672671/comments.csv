,ZiONLY,2007-04-25T16:11Z,Is it the full suite and not the bundle?? Also did u add any keygen 4 this m8.. take care
,EasternBloc,2007-04-25T17:43Z,"Any cracks/keygens for contribute cs3?
Cheers!"
,richardbach,2007-04-25T17:44Z,Is it multilanguage as the CS2 Suite?
,svarognsa,2007-04-25T18:32Z,"What is Extra Content, maybe new ""Developer Toolbox""???  :-)"
,petola80,2007-04-25T19:04Z,SO-NO crack or keygen or serial? Anyone know where to get it-or am I missin`smth here?
,EasternBloc,2007-04-25T19:04Z,The extra content is the bonus package - stock photos and a folder full of fonts! ;-)
,EasternBloc,2007-04-25T19:06Z,All the software apart from Contribute CS3 has been cracked. You just gotta look around (search for the MKDev cracks). So all we need for this package to be complete is Contribute. Still no full suite keygens out though. There is for the stand-alones but not the packages.
,hb5gq316ab,2007-04-25T20:41Z,"Searching for MKDev works out well.

Fireworks + Acrobat Crack is missing tho.
Acrobat Distiller and the main app claim that Activation is required to run."

Installed without a hitch, Found keygens on Pirate Bay.

Try Searching for

Again, Thank you.

(The fonts are also a cool thing!)"
,TheRealDevil,2007-04-26T22:53Z,I may be the most stupid person here but I dont get it with the fonts..??
,hex1,2007-04-28T11:25Z,"(I'm assuming, as still downloading) the fonts are simply extra content. You install fonts either manually by copy and pasting (not extracting or anything else, just copy and paste) them to C:\Windows\fonts, or automatically by right clicking them and going ""Install"" (under Vista anyways)"
,eizwan,2007-04-30T07:22Z,im wondering is this a complete set or it just combined programs?

,Renegade_Master,2007-09-15T20:47Z,"On ""Product License Expired"" Googling for an answer says to turn back the computer date a few months."
,elenril,2007-10-02T21:13Z,"the fucking key Adobe Web Premium CS3 Keygen don't work! What can i do, so i need it! Please help.^^
It tell me to activate, what I can do? First i just enter the serial like all poeple, and the trial is already finish?? You now?"
,volcoff,2007-10-05T02:21Z,"after installing you use the keygen provided by loseyourself: HERE:http://www.crackdb.com/get_100425_Adobe.CS3.Web.Premium_crack.html

so step 1. when its asks you for the activation code put in the top generated number that you get when you press generate serial, then choose other  activation options and go to activate by phone. Copy and paste the code it gives you into the input box below the number it will then give you the authorization code. Put that in and it should work. Oh yeah, disable your NIC or modem."
,irieeyes,2007-10-10T06:47Z,so after i enter the serial number is it okay to activate it?  It says I have thirty days to activate . . .
,surfj1213,2007-12-31T00:40Z,"I have used the serial gererating software, and tried to activate by phone, but it keeps saying that the activation process is unsucessful.

can this be avoided somehow?

VISTA DOES NOT ALLOW THIS SW TO INSTALL L THINK?"

,deca_321,2008-02-18T12:49Z,"hi, can you please give us the authorization code to activate this by telephone?

this is the only method that it may activate!

please!!!! l want this so bad!"
,wowGexo,2008-02-19T01:46Z,"well reading from several sources i finally figured this out here is what u have to do to activate it
1.- download http://www.crackdb.com/get_100425_Adobe.CS3.Web.Premium_crack.html
2.- generate the serial with that keygen
3.- once you click next it will tell u to activate it, select the phone method
4.- it will provide you a new number, enter it in the key gen and click in activate
5.- Paste the new serial on CS3 and click ok
6.- theres something wrong with the licence so it will tell u that it Expired already
7.- Change the date on your computer (i just changed it to 2007 instead of 2008, some months ago might work but i just did this to keep track on what day im living lol
8.- Voila it works :)

Thanks for the upload :D"
,latrina_100,2008-04-04T16:22Z,damn license has expired!! can i make it work again without setting the time back to 2007???
,latrina_100,2008-04-04T18:03Z,"1) First off, delete C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache\cache.db

-nota: C:\archivos de programas\archivos comunes\adobe\adobe pcd\cache\cache.db

2) Then run any of the CS3 (Encore in your case) programs. Click Accept to continue, then enter your serial that used to work. BEFORE clicking next, you'll notice that you have a NEW cache.db file in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe PCD\cache

3) Right click the file, go to properties and make it READ ONLY, and then click next on CS3 after entering your key.

4) Next, after you get to the register software screen.

Click ""Register Later""

5) Now it should be working, technically speaking that is, but you're not done yet.

The register screen should have popped up again. This time, remove the check for ""Read Only"" from that new cache.db file and select ""Do Not Register"" from the the top of the register software menu.

6) Now, as soon as you click continue, make the cache.db file read only again, and LEAVE IT THAT WAY to prevent a possible reoccurrence or Adobe trying to send the patch through again disguised as an ""update"".

Remember that if you need to reinstall the serials of any CS3 product which was working prior to the creation since you have created a new cache.db file you must temporarily uncheck the ?read only? properties box for the cache.db.

Then after inserting the serials and reactivating them close the program and then recheck the box. "

help me "
,masicno,2008-06-11T05:47Z,"Okay. Got the serial, it worked fine. Having trouble with activation though. I call up the phone place, give them the info, but it says that activation was unsuccessful. The phone system says I can chat with a live person but I didn't know if I should. Did you other guys actually talk to someone to activate or is there just a problem with mine. I've tried activating both with my internet on and off (was instructed to in a past post). I've also tried it with two different serials (one from one keygen the other from the crackdb.com place). Can someone help?"
