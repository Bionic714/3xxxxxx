Type: Documentary
Rating: NR
Running Time: 96 Minutes
Directed by: Walon Green
Soundtrack: Stevie Wonder

The thesis of this visually stunning documentary feature is that plants have feelings, too, and that they have a variety of ways of expressing them. Based on the best-selling book by Peter Topkins and Christopher Bird, the custom of talking to one's houseplants is strongly recommended by the filmmakers. Though scientific in tone, the film does not air the opposing view advocated by, perhaps, a majority of scientists. One highlight of the film is its original musical score by Stevie Wonder. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide"
