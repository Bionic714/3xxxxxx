,RadicalMotE,2007-04-29T17:08Z,Please seed liek u nvr did before KeKlInGs?
,Trinsec,2007-04-29T20:10Z,"@rezzal:
What nonsense is this? It's a legal rip off my legal CD. Unless you're implying the makers have been supplying trojans?"
,Trinsec,2007-04-29T20:42Z,"@rezzal:

If you found those, it'd help if you mentioned the filenames so others could keep that in mind. I've found nothing on my own virusscanner. Kind of funny to have malware in there. The only 'foreign' file was the patch file, but it patched fine here. And yes, I've tested this iso before I uploaded it."
,Trinsec,2007-04-29T20:47Z,"Rofl! Gamespy? Heh, yeah, those kind of 'tools' are annoying as heck. But it came with the game, and I've not altered the CD in any way except adding that patchfile. Well, while you're installing the game, you can tell it not to install Gamespy. That's what I did too (Gamespy and similar suck anyway). So, it's completely up to the users to install that 'malware' or not."
,RadicalMotE,2007-04-29T22:58Z,"it is perfectly clear of any viruses, and it works perfectly:) ill be seeding this for a month or 2"
,Trinsec,2007-04-30T10:02Z,"Thank you, RadicalMotE. :) Hope more people will seed this little gem. I'm still seeding it, but at least 15 people ought to have gotten it complete now."
,Azirophos,2007-05-30T19:36Z,Thanks a lot for the upload. Very appreciated.
,Saibot1008,2007-06-18T08:48Z,Plz seed this guys! :) 
,Fenith,2007-06-24T20:54Z,"Seriously... How do you play the game?
I've mounted the .iso, and installed the game. But when i try to play, it just say ""Please insert the correct CD-ROM, select OK and restart application.

Help plz."
,MalcolmReynolds,2007-06-25T15:59Z,There is a patch included. Use the patch then the game won't ask for a CD anymore.
,timsk,2007-07-05T21:35Z,"could someone seed this from tomorrow for about 2 days please? really want this game my cd is scratched to fuck, thanks :D"
,skrilaxx,2007-07-16T04:18Z,"What the shit? I installed the game and i get the same error as Fenith. All i got was a .iso , abolsutley no patch. Only thing i could install was gamespy arcade. i installed that and still says wrong CD."
,cqp,2008-02-23T02:47Z,Someone is still seeding the game? I want to download but it won't :(
,cyclobs,2008-06-16T07:59Z,seed people
,timeforfunstuff,2009-11-14T03:01Z,this is super slow without seeders it may take me a few days to download... sadly. thats the downfall about Âľtorrent.
,timeforfunstuff,2009-11-14T03:02Z,or maybe it might take like 18 hours.
,timeforfunstuff,2009-11-15T02:10Z,"man I'm going to seed this for a while for you guys out there, and it took me forever to download because thepiratebay's tracker kept timing out everytime it got fast. Meaning most of the time my max download speed was 1.something. Well I hope I don't have any problems with this and good luck with any future downloads for people out there."
