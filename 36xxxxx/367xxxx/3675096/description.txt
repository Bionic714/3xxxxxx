Well...I think I uploaded this before somewhere here. But that was before the little problem with the Swedish government, which luckily got solved. :)

This is a homemade Anime Music Video containing clips from Macross Zero (one of my absolute favourite series). The music is from the group Gackt, and the song is "Redemption".

Now a warning, the AMV does contain SPOILERS! Not many, but some.

Hope it works and that you can enjoy it!
