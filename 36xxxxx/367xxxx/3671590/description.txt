Many of you people have seen the Spongebob Squerepants episode: Band Geeks. In the end of the episode a song is played called: \\\\\\\"Sweet Victory.\\\\\\\" If you go to limewire to find this song you will only find the song from the Spongebob episode wich is 1.30 min long. Many believes that the song is made just for that episode. There you are wrong. Here is the original song wich is 3.51 min long.
Well there you go. I\\\\\\\'m happy to share this song, because i love this song.

And the person i should thank is: Luke. If it wasn\\\\\\\'t for him i would never had gotten this song. 
So thank him.


Thank you Luke:)
