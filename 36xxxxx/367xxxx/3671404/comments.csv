,sunshinestate,2008-04-10T10:36Z,"the audio on this is pretty terrible. very bad compression settings, everytime somebody talks you can hear the volume dropping 20db and then right afterwards the background noise shoots up. its almost impossible to listen to."
,BloodLogic,2008-08-20T04:16Z,"@sunshinestate:
Hi there, thanks for the interest in commenting. But, I went back, pulled up the disk, and it actually has stellar audio and video quality. You're probably not using VLC player, or you most likely have some bad codecs installed, because the files are perfect."
,Shadowtheweak,2008-09-14T04:55Z,"This show was canceled unfortunately...  I think most people didn't understand the premise of the show and that there were real people on it, not just actors."
,annalator,2009-07-24T01:10Z,"this show is hiarious

,macbookwhite,2010-02-04T06:11Z,"another awsum show that aired on comedy central, wish it would have had most seasons, the characters are just flawless and zach galifinakis (allan finger) reminds me of his character in the hangover."
