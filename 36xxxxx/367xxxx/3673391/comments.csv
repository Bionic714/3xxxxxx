,Schopenhauer,2007-10-19T03:25Z,"I we known about fuckforforest for some years now and they are very sincere, honest, kind and good people most people that know them say. The industry has used the power of sex to get our cash for eternity, through their marketing techniques. This is sex being used in a much more radical and less hippocitic way. A damn fine way to make a point. Also the point made is not a bad one, as one dont have to be Al Gore to figure out. Most people would chicken out doing an argument for something in this way. Raddical but better than hurting someone to get the messege out. If ALL porn had an ethic goal, it would be unethical NOT  to support porn. If that would be how things work out in like 2766 A.D love and sex would have something in common again.Haha in a world like that maybe only true Saints would get the privilege of being nominated to being pornstars :-D (Yes im on drugs now)"
