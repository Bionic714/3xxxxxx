,tvspot,2007-07-08T01:37Z,"Hi all, what is the best program to use to convert and or watch this MKV file type. Also what is the best format to convert it to if you want to keep it in HD? I am currently using Movkit Batch Video to convert this to mpeg 2 at original frame size, etc. and it says it will take over 12 hours to convert. Thanks for any info!"
