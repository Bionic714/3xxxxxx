,forest hunter,2007-06-24T13:26Z,"ok that still doesn't make sense
what does it NoDVD patch do?"
,forest hunter,2007-06-25T14:37Z,"dont worry I worked it out
works very well
thanks"
,fgpaz13,2007-07-06T09:34Z,the above link is dead..can you provide another link for the patch @ macgamefiles.com?
,.shorty.,2007-08-31T14:59Z,seed
,Bisgaard9000,2007-09-01T16:03Z,Are there anybody how can tell me how i seed? in danish... im all new in this computer stuff
,sunstriker69,2008-01-28T23:20Z,"Is it possible this crack doesn't work under leopard?
The app crashes on launch..."
,zqq,2008-02-12T00:29Z,"For users with Leopard the crack will not work right away. If you open the terminal and type the following commands you will be able to run the app.

$ cd /usr/lib
$ sudo cp libcrypto.0.9.dylib libcrypto.0.9.dylib.old
$ sudo cp libssl.0.9.dylib libssl.0.9.dylib.old
$ sudo ln -sf libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib libcrypto.0.9.dylib
$ sudo ln -sf libssl.0.9.7.dylib libssl.0.9.dylib

When the app crashes if you click the ""Report"" button you will see that it is referencing the file libcrypto.0.9.dylib ... I guess Tiger used a different filename for the same library.

The crack works great for me now... hope you guys enjoy!"
,zqq,2008-02-12T00:32Z,Okay well the patch opens... but when I drop my generals app file onto it it just gives me an error and doesn't work.. i'm stumped at this point..
,bnetqc,2008-03-03T21:24Z,"Same For Me get a error
"
,frostie89,2008-04-17T14:15Z,"Ive downloaded the patch, tried adding the official patch but it wont work(says i need a dvd) and tried this patch but it dont work either(just gives an error). is it best if i burn it to a dvd then run it? the game runs ok but its really slow."
,Franklint,2009-02-26T09:48Z,"Yeah, I'm getting an error message when I try to apply the crack as well. Any way someone could upload their pre-cracked app?"
,olmokram,2010-05-07T18:48Z,"im gettin this error all the time. tried to change the library names, still not working

/Command & Conquer Generals/Command & Conquer Generals.app/Contents/MacOS/Command & Conquer Generals"
,olmokram,2010-05-07T18:49Z,"also, first it tells me it needs to change permissions, so i type my password, cause it needs it, and then it crashes with this error:

/Command & Conquer Generals/Command & Conquer Generals.app/Contents/MacOS/Command & Conquer Generals"
