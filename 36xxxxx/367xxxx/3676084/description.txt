MaNGOS TBC v2.0.12 SERVER F.A.Q.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

What client does this server support?
You will need ONE of the following clients to access thie server...

    * WoW TBC v2.0.10.6448
    * WoW TBC v2.0.12.6546

If you dont have a client... scroll to the bottom of this post...

What do I need to run this server?
You require a mySQL v5+ server and an apache websrver running...
if you dont have either already... i would check out XAMPP...

How do i install the SQL database?
After all my SQL work... i have found SQLyog to be the best...
Install the \"Community version\" so you have all the features enabled...
After which you can open it and login to the SQL database...

Are the new Teir 4 & Tier 5 & Tier 6 items included?
I know the Tier 4 & Tier 5 & Tier 6 are now included...

Are the all The Burning Crusade items, quests & etc. included?
No... No... and No... Sorry guys.. There maybe a few...
But... No one has made them all yet...

Commonly found bugs?
If you find a simple spell not working and / or items not working 100%...
i am sorry but we cannot offer support for your issues...
for the amount of data included in the repack is rather excessive...
and i myself do not have the time to do this...
