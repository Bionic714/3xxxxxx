,MBenjo,2007-05-10T14:05Z,"Monsumie! Wait until   mangosd.exe   loads up (the text stops scrolling in it) and there will be a list of commands (or if not, type .help). There you can find the commands like:

.create - create and account
.setgm - set someones account to be a GM

if you only type .create or .setgm you will see the syntax like:

syntax: .create  

syntax: .setgm

-------------- 

btw, if you want to make your server L@n; press in the control window ""server administration"" and then follow the steps. Use the ip; 127.0.0.1 (this can differe with routers. You have to use CMD and use the standard gateway ip! 


To make is a ONLINE server, do the same but then use the IP found at http://www.whatismyip.com
