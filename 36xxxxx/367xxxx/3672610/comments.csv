,Evilcaller,2007-04-27T04:29Z,"Perhaps a stupid question, but what am i supposed to do with this?  the rar files contain a .cue file and a .bin file.  I have no idea what to do with them."
,NbAlIvEr100,2007-04-27T08:53Z,just extract the .rar files...don't do anything with the .bin
,Evilcaller,2007-04-28T01:28Z,"Ok.  Thanks for that.  :)  I've never done much with those kinds of files, so I didn't know that the .cue file is used for cd burning.  Had to find that one out.  Got it now :)"
