,urban89,2007-12-18T01:03Z,"""Language: Serbo-Croatian""
WTF?? Va fan är det!!!?
Lär er! Det finns skillnad!

What?! 
Learn it is a difference!!!!
Hate the fucking term ""Serbo-Croatian""!!!"
,pechorin,2007-12-19T12:48Z,"Bila jednom jedna zemlja, tamo su govorili srpsko-hrvatski!

I had the same discussion at the now down demonoid... 
If you have seen the film and can step aside nationalist ignorance you will probably understand the purpose I wrote Serbo-Croatian.

The film follows some people through the history of - Yugoslavia, the most-spoken official language of which was (bet you guessed it) Serbo-Croatian. The downfall of this multiethnic country is mourned in a way, and that's the reason I find it legitimate to call the spoken language as I did.

Having studied Bosnian, Croat and Serbian Languages at university, I know for sure there are differences, but they are not that big, just variations of one south slavic dialect (stokavian)
and people speaking these languages do understand each other, if they are not too stubborn. Of course there are some (nationalist) tendencies to make these languages more different (e.g. in Croatia TV, Radio and Schools are advised to use original croatian words instead of ""serbian turkish"" words. I have some Croat Friends who were surprised when they went back to their home country and sometimes couldn't understand their people because they suddenly used words they never used before the war...)

That's all, folks! (for now)

Cuvajte se,
pechorin"
,urban89,2007-12-20T23:20Z,"Tanks for the torrent.
And what can I say.
I am a nationalist!
Sorry man you cant change me."
,anarhije,2007-12-29T12:09Z,"I've wanted this film for a long time. Can't get it to work at all :( I'm sure I'm just doing something wrong. Not had this problem before with DLs. Clearly it's me that's doing something wrong. . . .

Help!"
,pechorin,2008-01-15T00:19Z,"Regarding the language issues: I'd like to add another thing... I'm Austrian, and though my dialect differs from the variant spoken in Germany I would never think of denying we speak the same language.

@anarhije:
sorry to hear it doesn't work for you. I'm sure it has to do with codec issues on your computer. Try VLC player, which doesn't install the codecs to your system, but uses built-in decoders. If this doesn't work, I don't know what could be the matter..."
,smartnsassy,2008-02-25T16:05Z,"Thank you!
This is a great movie and I have seen it many times. This is for once again.

BTW. The directors name is Nemanja Kusturica."
,lizzers,2008-04-14T02:42Z,er how come he is billed on his movies as emir then?
,raheesen,2008-09-25T08:43Z,excellent quality...great movie...thanks.
,Joaqii,2008-11-13T10:07Z,"Amazing piece of cinema. Thanks a great big huggy bunch. Anyone got problems running it, VLC did the trick for me (as usual). You change the subtitle track in the video options. KATASTROFEEEEE!"
,Miganiya,2009-01-18T18:56Z,"Pechorin, that guy was right... Serbo-Croatian isn't a Serbian and Croatian language. Now, you say you study Bosnian... I must tell you that there is no Bosnian nationality, and thus there is no Bosnian language. In Bosnia you find three major ethnicities - Serbs, Croats and Muslims (just Muslims-leftovers of turned Serbs and Croats during the 500 years of Osman occupation)

Croatian is a language that has root in Serbian language only. It is a different dialect, but since Croats wouldn't admit it's Serbian language they speak, they thought of calling it Serbo-Croatian. Not till 5 years (or so) ago, they couldn't legally name it Croatian ('cause it's not), so they put 5000 new nouns in Croatian ""language"" and it became internationally accepted, even though no living Croatian uses any of 5000 new nouns! (that happened 5-10 years ago)

So the term Serbo-Croatian is just a political mean to make Croatian people a bit more independent. It's no language.

And Serbs, ""Bosnians"" and Croats are not all stokavian. Only Serbs are, that's the main difference, Croats are kaykavian. And in Bosnia-Croats are kaykavian, Serbs are stokavian, and muslims are muslims, they mainly use stokavian serbo-turkish.

Another division in Serbian language is: yekavica, ikavica and ekavica, depending on how you pronounce certain vocals (a e i o u), whether you add ""y"" to ""e"", make ""e"" to be ""i"", or just say ""e"". So don't bother...just know that Serbo-Croatian is bullcrap.

And thanx very much for the torrent! It's probably the best Serbian movie ever! (even though it was a Bosnian muslim who made it, but he became Serbian orthodox recently... lol)"
,pechorin,2009-01-19T20:47Z,"Just checking in on the torrent after months and lo! and behold, another language regarding issue.

Dear miganiya!
I am well aware of the fact that there are other south slavic dialects being spoken by many on former yugoslav territory (the mentioned by you kajkavica, and maybe even chakavica), but I was speaking of OFFICIAL (i.e. written) languages, and you can't deny that for writing all three countries use stokavica, and it is absolutely no problem to read and understand each other's writings.

As for the term Serbo-Croatian: Once more, this movie is about Yugoslavia, and at that time the language(s) was (were) called that way, and that's the reason I chose to use it (the reason being both Yugoslavia and Serbo-Croatian are no more). So you are right

As for the Question if the language is more Serbian or Croatian and who invented it or used it first - I won't meddle in these matters, for neither is this my responsibility nor do I deem nationalist questions important (bas mi briga, j**** nacionaliz(a)m!!).

One last point: Only ijekavica and and ekavica are used in written language - ikavica only verbally (e.g. in Dalmatia).

And yes, I agree - Underground is one of my all time favourites."
,stsparrow,2009-01-26T20:59Z,"Pechorin, all of the sub files appear to be in German, even the ones that say English.  I would really like to obtain English subtitles - and those free subtitle websites won't be of any use, since you have the film split up into 2 separate AVI files.  Please help! "
,stsparrow,2009-01-28T01:37Z,"oops! my mistake.  I separated the two sections into different folders, and they played fine.  Thanks!"
,Bela-I,2009-04-17T02:24Z,"I'm so sorry but there's one thing I don't understand. I'm Croatian and not  nationalist at all. I have never heard of Serbo - Croatian language. There is Serbian and Croatian and although similar those are two different languages. And Emir Kusturica is well known for being veliko-srbin, pro-Milosevic` s idea of great Serbia. Don´t get me wrong I love his movies but not his political orientation."
,Bela-I,2009-04-17T13:39Z,"Miganiya, Hrvati su imali svoju gramatiku napisanu jo? davne 1620. godine, sastavio ju je jedan od najslavnijih Hrvata Bartol Ka?i? sa otoka Paga. 

Croats had their grammar written since 1960., of which the author is one of the most famous Croats Bartol Ka?i? from island of Pag."
,pechorin,2009-06-05T13:10Z,"Just one last comment on the notorious language issue. For information on the history of the term Serbo-Croatian and an (imho relatively unbiased) overview of today's situation of classification of South Slavic Dialects used in the territory of former Yugoslavia - you see why I prefer the albeit politically incorrect but oh so simple and handy S.-C.? - take a look at:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian

As you will see, Serbo-Croatian had been official standard language for 37 years."
,ali-baba-novac,2009-08-15T15:14Z,"I'm searching for this movie for many years, but all there is available is this 170 minutes long version which I can't watch without disappointment;

only saw the 320 minutes director's cut version taped on VHS from ARTE TV channel, was it for TV only and never released on DVD? 

I love this movie and would like to see it again sometime, not just an abridged version; no one cares to upload it or no one have it?"
,cooky75,2009-08-21T21:58Z,shudup you fucking serbo-croation
,pechorin,2009-12-03T03:34Z,"@ali-baba-novac
The long version as of now has not been released on original DVD, but there exists a Russian DVD-version of the TV-series you are referring to, but this is only in Russian without subtitles, as far as I know.
The possibility, however, to download the mentioned earlier arte-version remains. It can be found on the freakyflicks-forums (see torrents description above, just search the forums for it).
@cooky75
Thank you for your priceless contribution to the discussion!"

but where are the german subtitles?
doesn't matter, I love it."
,pechorin,2010-09-29T18:21Z,"@wishihashi
soft subtitles included (separate *.srt files). Any decent player will show them to you (if they are stored in the same folder as the avi). Recommended freeware players (successfully tested): vlc player, media player classic
