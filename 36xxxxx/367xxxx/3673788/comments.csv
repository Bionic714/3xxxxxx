,sebzapata,2007-06-26T18:53Z,is 'answer that and stay fashionable' included. cant seem to find it. good torrent none the less
,got_me_our_urs,2007-07-28T17:22Z,someone do a incubus discography
,007ace,2007-09-12T18:46Z,"Man I was going to download this torrent, but it is so poorly organized...
half the albums are set out properly but the rest are just a mess, mp3s track numbers start at 00...? my cds dont normally have a 00 track do yours?

Some are sorted AFI others A.F.I.
itll take me more time to organize this than to find and download it all seperately."
,G_a.s0ndr3,2007-10-08T22:24Z,"y, sorry.. first torrent i uploaded.
i actually just uploaded it for fun, and to see how it worked, but then somebody acctually downloaded it..."
,RaveDjay,2007-11-09T19:18Z,"To 007ace.
Of course there are no ''00'' tracks. But maybe the upploader had about 100 or 1000 tracks in let say winamp... then it coud had stand 001 etc 011 etc. up to 101 or 1001 if you wish... so there for there are 001 to 100 or 00 just for 01... but anywho... i dont care and i dont know why the hell i wrote this comment... anyway over to the upploader. Thanks for upploading! Great torrent, easy to fix the poorly organized tracks just as 007ace said via pressing sort by name icon.. Thanks again for upploading! Give uss to me!"
,LaMacabre,2008-03-06T16:39Z,"Nice one, Thanks!"
,yortyskank,2008-05-20T23:34Z,answer that and stay fasionable is definately not there
,Judaz81,2008-05-27T12:13Z,"Yup, this torrent takes more time to organize than to download album by album. And, as there are tracks missing altogether, I wouldn't have bothered with this had I realized this."
,darkflare000,2008-06-13T20:47Z,"For those of you ""complaining"" (i'd use harsher language, but dont feel like it), go get Windows Media Player, and tell it to sort it for you. Problem solved. How hard was that? Geez."
,darkflare000,2008-06-13T20:48Z,G_a.s0ndr3; thanks for the upload! :) Sorry I forgot that in my last post.
,smashing_machine,2008-06-27T07:09Z,"you guys complaining about the organization of the tracks should just stop listening to punk (kinda free and loose with the word punk for AFI) im 34...when i was a kid we traded punk comps on cassettes that were taken from 7"", 10"" and lps...then dubbed over and over again with no track listing or even a case for the most part...thank you for uploading the files...i only wanted the ep with the halloween cover on it, but when i saw the mommie punk comments i figured i would help seed it and say thanks...listen to NOMEANSNO's ""wrong"" album and ANTiSEEN's ""eat more possum"" album...and you guys worried about the organization of music files should turn off the pc and meet people..."
,smashing_machine,2008-06-27T07:16Z,"oh yeah, i realize it was posted a year ago and the person who left the post has probably hung himself in his jail cell by now but FUCK INCUBUS...heavy metals U2! "
,screamo1337,2008-09-30T23:11Z,"Save your time, get this torrent instead: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3763060/AFI_Discography

it has more albums. Alot more. And it's better organized. But thanks for the effort uploader!"
,SeberHusky,2010-12-23T16:32Z,"Where's the  ""The Days Of The Phoenix EP"" ?
