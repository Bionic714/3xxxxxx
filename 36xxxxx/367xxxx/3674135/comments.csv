It was fine at first, but after a while, I was unable to unlock more characters even though I beat Time Attack, and even though I set the difficulty meter to 2, arcade mode was always stuck on the hardest difficulty. Very annoying."

,SaDinski5,2008-03-24T19:35Z,this is the only mvc2 for ps2 on tpb? kinda unstable...
,True_astoroth,2008-04-26T18:15Z,"Do not bother downloading, I can't even get the game to load at all, it gets to the black screen before the intro and stops.    Waste of a torrent, people need to make sure their stuff works, or atleast next time you upload an iso, only use winrar to compress it, the extractor that comes w/ it is junk."
,True_astoroth,2008-06-03T09:03Z,"I may be able to get my hands on a legit copy of MvC2, if I can I will rip it, test it, and when i get it working I'll put a torrent up.   Keep your eyes open for it!"
,guidancezero,2009-03-12T22:29Z,I have PS2 Slim w/flip top and Magic Swap. Extract Exe = ISO. Burn image to dvd and there you go. Works great and plays smooth and short runtime like you said it would be. Thanks for the upload. =]
