To their detractors, they were Crosby, Still, Nash and Young Lite, but nonetheless, this premature career retrospective of soft-rock icons America holds up extremely well against most pop records of the early to mid-'70s. In part, that's due to ex-Beatles producer George Martin, whose considerable studio expertise nudged country-ish tunes like "Sister Golden Hair" as close to power pop as they were feasibly going to get. But the fact is that America had a genuine knack for crafting catchy, radio-ready singles, and this album offers just about all of them, including the Neil Young-esque "Horse With No Name," and the genuinely lovely "Ventura Highway."
