,scumbag7240,2008-12-29T21:28Z,"There appears to be a working fix for the video problems users were having when playing ShellShock on some nVidia GeForce cards. First make sure the game is installed, and you have a save profile created in the game. Open My Documents and open the ShellShock_Nam67 folder. Open the ""TOD_PC"" file and find ""PostRenderingEffects"" and change it to Off. Then save the file and close it. Start the game up, and it should work correctly now. "
