,Adde96,2008-06-16T10:19Z,"Hey, check this out!!

I've download this file 1 time befour.
Then I dont get a cd-key, so i was serching at the internet (www.google.com). I've got someone cd-key and install it.

Look what happen:

*  I only can join "".ro"" and "".lv"" servers.(They don't look at your cd-key, some servers.)

*  But I got one problem:
I can't get many maps in my ""New Game"" list (Local Game) so when it's too many it will remove the oldest maps like ""de_dust2"" and ""de_nuke"" and... yeah you know.

*  And i can't change my cd-key or reinstall the Counter Strike 1.6 Final Release!. I can, but everything is saved in the install-box.

You people are really noobs, you have to test something new!
- Hey I cant get out online, it say something about a cd-key...

Guys, THINK OUT THE BOX!!

Hope someone will see this...
