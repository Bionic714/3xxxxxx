,freddydude94,2010-01-30T13:29Z,"how come people dont download DVDR?? its so much more fun to watch a movie in good quality, and if they have an external harddrive, like every pirate should, its no problem with 4 gigs"
,BloodyxCape,2010-06-15T22:14Z,i don't think its a PAL because it played on my region 1 dvd player. it does have all extras. great upload! i will seed for a while.
