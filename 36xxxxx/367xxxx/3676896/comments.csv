,kanoten123,2007-04-30T13:05Z,"First you must download a bitorrent klient (http://www.utorrent.com/download.php), then you download this torrent.

When you're finished you get winrar and extract the files and then you can watch your movie with VLC or whatever."
,avalonic,2007-04-30T22:52Z,Is this version without the annoying twennieth century fox? How's the sound quality?
