I can't get this to work. Had same problem with Aeon Flux. I have tried Final codec and nero showtime. 
There is no sound no video. Can you please describe in details how to play these files correct.

,hurrafor,2007-05-26T17:39Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
