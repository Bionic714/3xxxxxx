,tallguy989,2008-11-23T06:04Z,"Hey buddy....try VLC player...it has worked for DVD's for me in the past...also, InterActual DVD player might work...I am sure you can find a download for it somewhere....if you can do either of those, check your codecs for windows media player...K-Lite pack full or AceMega Codec pack should do the trick...."

,drako314,2011-11-30T20:56Z,"Hey all, firstly yes the video does skip but that's only bcos it is unable to be played in the right format as far as i know.

Its a good porn, but for some reason the menus therefore the ability to select different scenes does not work. I have VLC player and have successfully worked the tori black interactive porn, which has the same 'BUP' type file for the menus as this one but this one does not work!

So.. i must come to the conclusion that there is something wrong with the 'BUP' menu files bcos they are not recognized by VLC.

If it worked it would be good the quality is average on 1080 hi def screen."
