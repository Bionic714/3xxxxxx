,Pando111,2007-04-23T10:08Z,"For all: 

A thing: one forgot to me to erase these archives that are created when you use the RipIt4Me. He is advisable before recording the DVD to erase them.
These are the archives that there are to erase:

VIDEO_TS/ButtonInfo.txt 3.98 kB 
VIDEO_TS/DVDDecrypter.log 3.54 kB 
VIDEO_TS/FinalPSLFile.psl 0.05 kB 
VIDEO_TS/RipIt4Me.log 5.17 kB 
VIDEO_TS/RipIt4Me.psl 0.62 kB 

and del folder: 
VIDEO_TS/OriginalIFOs

 I feel the forgetfulness and the caused disadvantage."
