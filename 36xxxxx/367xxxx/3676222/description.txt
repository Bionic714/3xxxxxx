IMMIGRATION IS A TIME BOMB
Library Synopsis

Looks at the impact of immigration on social and health services, the economy and British cultural identity. Rod Liddle, takes a critical look at current immigration policy and raises concerns about problems that need addressing in order to prevent growing resentment and anger from many people in the country. These include practical concerns about overcrowding, jobs, criminality and education; worries about the impact of immigration on freedom of speech, human rights and the nature of our multicultural community in the UK; and a fear that, particularly since 9/11, some of the people we are letting into Britain have beliefs and lifestyles that are incompatible with our modern democracy. @Channel 4 Publicity
