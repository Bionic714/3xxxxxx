,nwpullman,2007-07-01T22:01Z,"Why 192kb/s???

Why making people download more than they would have with 44.1/16?

Stupid..."

""Why 192kb/s???

It can be ""44.1/16"" and 192kb/s at the same time.  Please try to know what you're talking about before you start talking trash to people who are nice enough to upload such a great peace of music for ungrateful assholes like you."

,PPKLP,2008-01-03T16:46Z,"and it was first released in 2002 (for the people like me, who care about those kinda information)...

This is a lame excuse for a Portishead discography."
