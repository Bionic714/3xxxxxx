The Amazing Spider-Man Season 1
Live Actor Series (1977)

I had a problem finding a working torrent of season 1 so I found the individual files and reseeded them. I hope there aren\'t any problems. This is the first torrent I\'ve made.

The adventures of freelance photographer Peter Parker, who, after being bitten by a radioactive spider, discovered he had gained superpowers, such as super-strength and agility and the ability to climb sheer walls and ceilings. After inventing a super-sticky web serum, he donned a red-and-black costume, and began fighting crime as the superhero Spider-Man. During the day, Parker worked for the Daily Bugle and skinflint editor J. Jonah Jameson.
