,dbqp,2007-05-19T19:43Z,"Ty, many people recommended this game for the psp and i really want to try it out. Hope you have a awesome life"
,Chriscyco30,2007-05-19T21:18Z,"does this work with a PSX emulator?

if it does is this made by Europe or America?

dose this also need a custom firmware?

TY if u answer my questions"
,xJooNzZ,2007-06-05T15:31Z,what do i do with these files....  can u write a step by step tutorial on what to do with them after you download it?
,Mr. Master D. Evil,2007-06-30T01:43Z,"This is what to do:

1. Download the torrent!

2. Seed a lot! =)

3. All the files are compressed .rar files. Disc 1 and 2 in two splited ones, and 3 in only one! Extract the files in them to a drive with enough empty space! (like 500MB per cd!) You can use programs like WinRAR to do this or a free program like 7zip!

4. Each of these folders you get when you extract the .rar files is one disc!

5. You need to have installed the latest Open Edition Firmware... 3.40-OEA! Anyone can get that now! (Newest sony firmware is atm: 3.50)
You need to downgrade to 1.50 before you can install some open edition firmware! I recommend doing it, but read a lot about it before you do it and be sure about what you do! If you do something wrong, may you never be able to play on your PSP again!

6. After installed 3.40-OEA, connect the PSP to a PC!

7. Remember I said, each folder is one disc? Well, now you're going to add one and one (or all at once) to:
X:\PSP\GAME
(X = whatever character your PSP/memory stick driver has got)
If the folders doesn't exist... make them yourself!

8. Disconnect the psp from your computer and on your PSP, go to Game -> Memory Stick -> There the game should be now, called Final Fantasy 7! =D

It's not that easy! I'm not making a guide for downgrading! thats for you to search up! (Just use the search word ""3.40-OEA installtion"" or something in google.)"
,Mr. Master D. Evil,2007-06-30T01:46Z,"It's not that hard*
>_<

The downgrading may be scary the first time... but I've downgraded 5 times or something and upgraded a lot! =D Just be sure you know what you do, and that you do it right!!!!!"
,JR87NY,2007-07-13T07:16Z,it says i need a password??? Do i just drag the folders to psp/game? or do i drag each individual file inside the folder??

,modus.operandi,2007-11-23T05:48Z,"sorry. but i'm just wondering.
when i'm done with disc 1, how am i going to proceed to disc 2? when the option appears to change disc."
,AngelonAcid,2007-12-23T11:47Z,"Does this work on 3.71-33M ?
This probably sounds really dumb but since everyone's saying you need 3.40 i'm not sure anymore. "
,minipulator,2007-12-24T15:58Z,"AngelonAcid: Confirmed working on 3.71 M33-2.  Just make sure you put the folders in GAME and not GAME150.  

Can anyone tell me how disc changing works?  Right now I've got 
\PSP\GAME\FF7-1
\PSP\GAME\FF7-2
\PSP\GAME\FF7-3.

If this is correct, is there any way to hide the other two CDs icons?

Thanks guys."

,vstrtz,2008-02-04T16:52Z,"gr8 game.. i downloaded bt i am able to save the game, i am not able to press the save game option in the game menu.. i am on 3.80M33-5
plz help!!!"
,t0nyLiCi0us,2008-02-04T17:06Z,hey guys im new hir.. i just want 2 ask about the disk changing thing...=(  it really gives me a hard tym figuring out how 2 jump 2 disk2...=( the save file from disk1 isnt working in disk 2.. could anyone hir kind enough 2 plz teach me how to do it?. thnx in advance. tc.  
,Pedro_Sarmento,2008-02-04T19:26Z,"It's simple. De gameID and SaveID MUST be the same for both disc. For example, if you have Final Fantasy VII PAL disc 1 with GAME ID 00867 and SAVE ID 00867 cd2 MUST have GAME ID00867 and SAVE ID 00867 when you convert to Eboot.PBP.

Btw, please tell me what converter did you use to convert this Final Fantasy VII NTSC."
,t0nyLiCi0us,2008-02-05T16:43Z,"oic, so thats how its going 2 work?! but i stil have 1 problem left. how will i know what ID type de cd is?!"
,Pedro_Sarmento,2008-02-06T00:10Z,"That's the easiest part. When you first put your ISO/BIN image in the converter, it automatically tell you the IDs. Then, you just have to put the same IDs for the other discs.;)

One more time, please, team$$, tell me what program did you use to convert this game????? Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Pedro_Sarmento,2008-02-10T17:43Z,Is there someone who can answer my question???????????????????????????

,indobjork,2008-04-27T23:30Z,"Hello gank,
Newbie with the PSX eboot. Need help please. I have OEM V. 3.30 and I have transferred all three FF7 folders into the PSP drive. If I check, only the first CD has data in it. The other two shows as corrupted data. Does this mean I have to transfer one by one? Or should I combine the folder into one big file? Help is appreciated."
,sand0storm,2008-05-20T06:49Z,"Put each eboot in a seperate folder 

ex. FF71,FF72,FF73 in the game folder"
,gabya,2008-06-03T18:01Z,"anyone know if this works on 3.90 m33-3?

,kentakluring,2008-07-01T14:45Z,how do i change discs? is it just to quit when it asks for another cd and then choose it from the game meny?
,kentakluring,2008-07-01T14:46Z,do i have to use popstation? then how?
,Chimpy135,2008-07-15T18:19Z,"I have tested this with Popsloader on a PSP with custom firmware 3.90 M33 and it works perfectly. Not a single glitch anywhere, and the saving is perfect!

Only downside is that the pic1 and icon0 images are really gay, and you can't change that easily."
,jkillah1,2008-07-16T08:23Z,"I'm loving everything about this download except for one thing:  Why the hell did you password protect this?  It's like you're trying to stop pirates from pirating your pirate software which is located on a site dedicated to pirating!

Arrrr!"
,Mattx2,2008-07-27T09:07Z,"PLEASE HELP!! Tasukete - NOT A ROOKIE

Hey can someone please help me.  After I upgraded my PSP to 4.01m33-2, my ""Final Fantasy 7 Disc 3""
save from this eboot got messed up and the game wont read it now.  For some reason the picture changed to dracula from castlevania.

All Im asking is that someone send me a save file of Disc 3 (the whole folder found in the SAVEDATA folder).  I don't care where it is on Disk 3, I don't intend on playing the save I just want to compare the files in the folder to get me save to work. I recomend you use sendspace and send me the URL or whatever you prefer.  My email is:  MattX2@gmail.com
Thank you fellow rpg fans."

,Combinednathan,2009-07-29T19:49Z,it works. thanks =)
,Varkrath0,2009-09-14T09:07Z,"@Sad_man
You don't actually change CDs.  When a PSX game is ""converted"" to PSP (ie EBOOT) is it actually packaged with the PSP software as well.  POPS (the PSX emulator for PSP) assigns each game it's own virtual memory card.  If the conversation is done properly, each CD of a game should have the same SaveID and therefore be able to see save games for the other CDs.  I hope i explained that decent."
