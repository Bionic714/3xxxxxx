*** I, Parasite - Four Last Remixes remix contest ***

Hey, thanks for downloading the I, Parasite remix kit for the song "Four Last Things", which will appear on the forthcoming album, The Sick Are Not Healing.  

This remix contest is a little different than others, partially because no one has actually heard the original song yet, but also because the "kit" you have here has been randomly chopped together using Argeiphontes Lyre, by Akira Rabelais.  Instead of getting full instrument and vocal tracks, you're getting random bursts and bits of sound from the song.  Use these bits as you see fit to create a blind reconstruction of the song.  Please note that as a side effect of the chopping process that some bits of audio may be de-tuned or pitched oddly.  I leave it up to you to decide what to do with those bits.

When you're done, email me a link to the file (NOT the actual file) to remixATiparasiteDOTnet.  YouSendIt and the like are perfectly acceptable.  Please submit your final mixes as 16 bit, 44.1 kHz WAV or AIF files (NO compressed formats, like mp3).

My favorite top 4 remixes will be posted on the The Sick Are Not Healing MySpace page until formal album songs are posted.  My absolute favorite remix will remain on the MySpace page after formal songs are posted and also appear on an enhanced portion of the new CD as high quality AAC/MP4 file.  You will of course be credited for your work.

Good luck!
