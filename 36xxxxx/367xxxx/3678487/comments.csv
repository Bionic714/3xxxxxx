,chimpakawanzelu,2007-11-28T02:13Z,"Thank you soooooooo much, dopeman!!!!!!!!  F'in' cool game - and I'm only just at the third level or so, but I had to post this now.

Works great on Vista 32bit.  Unrared game and then unrared/installed guns updated before I started playing and everything works great.  That's my point.  Do those two operations before you start playing and everything will work great.  Any problems?? - just post them.  I keep my eyes on these pages to help out other Vista folks.

Cheers!!
