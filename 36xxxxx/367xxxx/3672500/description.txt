This Boston band released one album on a small independent local label in 1981, and it's a new wave gem.  "Tune In To Me" is just as good as anything that was a pop hit at the time, and received some airplay in New England.  
This is a good quality rip from the original vinyl-if you enjoy this, please seed so that others can also.
