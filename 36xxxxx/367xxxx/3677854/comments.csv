,boriszorg,2007-05-02T15:08Z,"Tout Ă  fait normal :-)
It's normal, when you download a torrent choosing just a few files. At the end you become a seeder, even you have not downloaded the full torrent."
,superkokot,2007-05-03T20:26Z,thank a lot for explanation :-)
,CelticL0,2007-05-11T14:14Z,"Thank you for such a great torrent.
I'll d/l the lot and seed when done.
(Though I'm going to prioritise certain stories)"
,meute,2007-06-26T15:18Z,"thanks for uploading this for us. it would have been nice to sort the comics by language to make it easier for everyone to get what they want to get, but it is no big deal for me. i already have some manara comics, he is a great artist. "

You won't believe how desperate I was to find even some of Manara's work. I do love his girls!!!
You have done some amazing work in collecting all this material. 
I just love you for that!!!"
