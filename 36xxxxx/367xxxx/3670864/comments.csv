,grusimaskineriet,2007-04-23T13:44Z,"165 downloaders with an IP-number starting with ""38.100"" and they are the only ones that can download this. Feels a bit fishy when everyone else (whos IP-number doesnt start with 38.100) are stuck att 11,1%..."

,todu,2008-01-20T15:50Z,"Thank you very much for this torrent. I'm waiting for the game called ""Spore"" to be released and in the meantime I can listen to music that is probably going to be similar to the music in the game:

,watty64,2008-09-12T22:43Z,Thanks a lot for a brilliant upload mate. Downloaded it a while back but forgot to say thanks.
,ektakrome,2009-08-14T06:43Z,"The worst thing about this torrent, is that the uploader encoded all these files with VBR. I can't stand VBR. In this day and age we should be sharing nothing smaller than a 320k Mp3 or FLAC."
,BlockJuice,2011-05-21T21:40Z,"@ektakrom: you're a fucking idiot, there is no difference between v0 and 320 and FLAC, unless you manage to spend over 5k on a ballin sound system to tell the difference."
