I hope you burn in hell. Too bad it won't happen though for there is no hell :/
people of the 21st century really should realise there is no god. Or at least in the form sold by religions. When will they wake up?
Excellent documentary btw."

,phishvideos,2007-08-21T20:35Z,Haha how ignorant....the jews did not create this evil.  
,fehersolyom,2007-11-06T22:39Z,"Agree with tomy77, jewish propaganda ('Amy Berg'). Of course, bad things should be contemned, so let's make a movie about killing children in Palestina by cootieswingers living in mounds or how they are driving other nations with the usage of fear and manipulation to gain support for war. 
And notice that all the new movies are containing jewish symbolism, rabbis, etc. even in nonsensical situations. This is real evil!"

,bt86bt,2009-03-15T11:09Z,"When did atheism become a ""closed system religion""?"
,kendangle,2009-04-15T01:07Z,"an incredibly powerful, interesting and emotional documentary that doesn't deserve this stupid bickering above. i'd urge you to see this whether you are interested in Catholicism, religion or are completely atheist.

,Erich505,2011-08-22T21:35Z,I want to hear the Catholic church speak out as loudly about pedophilia as they do any other moral issue.
