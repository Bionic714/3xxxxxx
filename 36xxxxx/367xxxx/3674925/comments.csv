,catchow58,2007-07-04T03:48Z,"OMG, this is a dream come true, and easily the awesomest thing that I've ever downloaded that isn't a gnu/linux operating system.  I just got it today, and needless to say, I've barely scratched the surface.

I started with richard the III.  The performances are delicious! "

,Bazzard,2007-07-07T10:15Z,How do I know which file is which ? They all have the same name and I just want to download Twelfth Night. . . I am so confuse.
,kennyg101,2007-07-18T12:13Z,"They do not have the same name. They are contained within a folder within a folder so if you only have a small window on the client you cannot see their full names since the file name string is long. The solution, drag your window out.
  Anyway, good news about Harry Roberts, his appeal is coming up...

,kennyg101,2007-07-25T02:24Z,"They have been downloaded and played hundreds of times. They are standard mp3 files. 
 What are you using to try and play them back? "
,myulk666,2007-09-01T17:56Z,"Tristanlxboyd, I had the same problem as you until I tried to copy the folder the files comes in, and past them somewhere els. Then I just replaced the original files with the one I copied and they all worked perfect!  "
,krum,2007-12-12T00:15Z,"Thanks so much for sharing these, will share back to 200% so long as there are leechers."
,embla,2008-01-08T16:09Z,"Thank you very much, I'm really grateful!"
,Dicedude,2008-01-09T02:52Z,Can't download this ... says the the filename exceeds platform limit. Any suggestion?? Thanks!
,Mumbleman,2008-04-02T00:44Z,"Brilliant. Quick to dload, excellent content. Acting is acceptable to superb throughout."
,Drystonius,2008-07-26T07:42Z,"Hey dicedude, the error may take the directory path into account.. try saving the files in the c directory or something.. otherwise upgrade from windows 3.1"
,Drystonius,2008-07-26T07:44Z,"oh yeah, kennyG, you're a star, thanks m8"
,kennyg101,2008-09-09T15:14Z,"Yep, www.radioarchive.cc is a good site. When I was uploading these I was trying to concentrate on Shakespeare and classic dramas. 
 Unfortunately (fortunately?)  I don't have a weekly six hour drive into the Japanese mountains anymore to devote to  radio dramas, plus a couple of young children don't really help. 
 Anyway, pleased to see that the files continue to bring pleasure, (and exam success) to so many. And don't forget Harry Roberts, still inside after all these years."
,gordontoon,2008-09-10T22:12Z,"I've dowloaded this torrent, but not all of the files play (roughly half). Of those which don't play, when I hover over the file with my cursor it states that the file is empty (when it quite plainly isn't). I have tried to play these fiel in Windows media player and I get this message ""Windows Media Player encountered a problem while downloading the file."" when I click on the web help button I am told I have ""encountered error message C00D0FEA"". Can anyone help?"
,falcott,2009-05-18T12:19Z,"Thanks so much, Kennyg101, and all seeders!
I had the same problem as some others, that many files wouldn't play. However, I found that Myulk666's solution, of copying and pasting, allowed them to play. I wouldn't have believed it had I not tried it!"
,PirateKing1975,2009-09-17T00:25Z,seeeeeeeeeeed!!
