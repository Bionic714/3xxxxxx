,Spectre67,2007-04-22T19:33Z,"Hey community,

Know of a fix for the issue of freezing during loading. When you've done an install, you should set your shortcut to run in Windows 98 compatibility mode.

Can somebody who has downloaded this give that a try and let me know if it works?

Thanks all."
,ckount,2007-04-22T21:57Z,Mount CD 1 after installing. Use YUSE to hide Daemon Tools. Take to the Nam skies.
,chitragupta,2007-04-22T21:58Z,"Please can someone explain me how to use loader  YASU included in this file?
I have instaled game, with new deamon ver. 4.09, and if I click YASU.exe I get msg that I must insert original CD, same thing without YASU...
Thx for help"
,chitragupta,2007-04-22T22:04Z,"1. I have install game using new DEAMON.
2. Mount CD1 with DEAMON
3. Use YASU to hide DEAMON drive
4. every time got this msg:
Please insert the original disc instead of a backup (4002).

 Please have a look at http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=copy&c=4002 for further, more detailed information."
,Mantori762,2007-04-23T22:16Z,I get CRC errors on a few files during install
,ignesti,2007-04-25T23:30Z,"It's great to download this game here, as they haven't dared put out a demo.
This game is truly crap. The gameengine is horrible, the graphics stalls and the framerate drops big time as soon as you reach for the skies. The manual is extremly thin and not even a hint on how to fly a heli. As an old sim'er I had no problems flying and can also say that this was a horrible experience. Look at what GameSpot.com had to say:

3.6 in score = B.A.D.

Download, install, ""play"", uninstall and thank PB that you didn't spend your hard earned money on this P.o.S."
,finnor69,2007-04-26T14:58Z,"Thank, It's work but make to bad FPS. 

chitragupta: when finish install cd2 just mount with cd1

Mantori762:  just Ignore that errors

,Bonez,2007-04-29T02:04Z,"It doesn't work for me, I get the splatscreen (start image) and then the game just quits by it self.

Anyone?"
,Bonez,2007-04-29T03:07Z,"Nvm my last post, THIS is how I got it to work.
Used latest DT.
mounted CD1
then mounted CD2
When the install is done, mount CD1 again.
Launch YASU
I then used Spectre67s method, I went in to the shortcut and switched to Win98 mode, which made the game work"
,Oma_trekkie,2007-05-02T01:50Z,What Bonez said...
,COLINBUCCI,2008-05-11T15:52Z,i cant even get to fly WTF it crashes when it starts to load
,randomgy101,2009-01-03T04:32Z,".mds and .mdf files are foreign to me, why can't you guys put it in ISO format...  Much much easier...  Either way, maybe the reason I can't get it is because I have Daemon 3...  I'll go get Daemon 4..."
,randomgy101,2009-01-03T18:26Z,"Well I got it working, but it's a big piece of crap...  It's just taking up a gig of space on my drive...  I'm getting rid of it..."
,RnRking,2012-04-13T11:53Z,Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed please . !!!!!
