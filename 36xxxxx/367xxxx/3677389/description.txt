Sharking:
Sharking refers to a form of malicious prank that has supposedly become fairly popular in Japan.In the act of sharking, the perpetrator sneaks up on a victim in a public area in open view and forcefully exposes the victim's intimate parts to be seen by the public for a brief moment before running away. It is very similar to the common schoolyard prank of pantsing practiced by bullies, although sharking is done for the sexual stimulation of the perpetrator, whereas pantsing is done solely for the humiliation of the victim.
