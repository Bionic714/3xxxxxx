,nightsongz2,2007-04-23T17:31Z,Wow! This IS 100% real!!! It's totally Rowling's writing style as I've ready all the books numerous times and am completely positive that this is a leak of the actual book. The guy above me is just a moron who doesn't want to believe it....his loss.
,Shylock,2007-04-24T00:33Z,"well the link he shows pretty much says it all. doubtful he wrote a link especially for that. personally I don't care though honestly the fan series that was written (not sure about this one) was actually as good as she wrote, so I'm glad I read it, and enjoyed it. The only reason publishers are against others being able to write such things is because 1)the quality and 2) the money. 2 being more important than 1 to them. the quality was decent in the one fake I read so good going imo."
,meytipeyti,2007-04-24T16:28Z,"Marvelous!
I nearly killed mysalf .............."
,meytipeyti,2007-04-24T16:29Z,I am going to read a chapter a day till the book is on the shelves .......
,meytipeyti,2007-04-24T16:32Z,"Oh!
about the differences.........
well......
if you have been reading JKR you know everything may change ;as the nearly headless Nick song.
It is the pace of things that is important .
And I can say by reading the first chapter that it is the good old JKR herself."
,mannyhavok,2007-04-24T21:49Z,"i hope you guys know this book is fake, it was a fan-fiction written like 2 years ago .. here's the link.

sorry to burst people's bubbles. but the truth had to be told."
,e_cathedra,2007-04-24T23:18Z,"Yep, it's fanfic and doesn't pretend to be anything else. On the other hand it's fairly well written (with a few minor lapses) and has some truly excellent plot ideas.

Personally, I'm really enjoying it (on page 460 at the moment). "
,storli90,2007-04-25T19:07Z,"Yes!!! its the real thing!
"
,torty,2007-04-27T03:39Z,This is the best fan-fic I read so far. The person that wrote it really did their homework. The url above confirms it's a fan-fic. If it wouldn't have been for the url and the comments written in between a couple of paragraphs I would have believed it was real.
,GeneralissimusX,2007-04-27T10:38Z,"I am sorry to say that having read the first paragraph I could tell that its a fake. 
First off this first part is written in third person limited from Harry's point of view. There is no way Harry would call his friends freaks even when talking to his cousins. It goes against the whole spirit of the series. 
But more importantly, it takes no brains to sit there in a universe created and work with established characters. If this person is so good why not write his own and publish it. Its ok for those who know that this is a fake to see it as such, to dismiss it but what of those who do not . Think of the pain. End of rant.    "
,shypys,2007-05-01T06:06Z,"All you need to know about this upload:

1. It is a fake.
2. The author tries to imitate JKR's style and fails(miserably).
3. It's not as good as the previous comments describe it.
4. Read it only if you have nothing better to read(which is unlikely(if you have nothing better to read, download the ""Enlightened Man's Book Collection"" from here, it really contains some books that are worth it(PS: no I'm not the uploader on that torrent)))
5. FFS, someone upload the leaked book. lol jus kiddin."
,Tjokka,2007-05-01T17:06Z,I know its a fake. But I think the book is really good! totaly worth to read!
,shypys,2007-05-01T22:51Z,"Its unbelievable, they've used the word ""shagging"" many times in a children's book, and the plot is weak. 
I went on with a rant about it.
I'm almost hooked to.
Not that i have nothing better to read, but its just that anything to do with Harry Potter so intrigues the loyals.
Download this, but from http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/ and give the original author Melindaleo some credit.
Cheers."
,Maeldox,2007-05-21T15:01Z,"LOL! Are you kidding me? Anybody who says this book is great obviously doesn't read very often. Just by reading the book excerpts in the description, I can see that the author is overly verbose and a complete amateur to writing. I feel sorry for JK Rowling that people would liken her writing style to this rag..."
,Errand,2007-05-21T20:40Z,"Get real n00bs!

If this was JKR, she would still be asking for coins at the sidewalk. The author tries butfails BIG as he steals the characters.
Thanks the real (youth ;) book will be available soon.

And remember ALL... The ones in the scene BUYS the goods that is good and only steal the crap like this and BF2 ;)"
,obelus 4,2007-06-01T15:40Z,"i have read these books many times but in their greek edition. i feel that it's a fake but you should read it. 

nice effort to the writter but a very femaled point of view"
,antaries,2007-06-12T10:51Z,This is not the 7th book from the Harry Potter series. It is FANFIC. It is a very well done story. I have read it three times so far. For the most part it is done in J.K Rowling's style but there are some parts that are of a different style. It kinda feels like there were more then you person writing the story. But it's very well done. I found it well worth the download. It will tide you over till the real 7th book comes out next month.
,Galbatrorix,2007-06-28T23:13Z,Om Denna Är Fake Så Är Alla Det På Denna Siten Har Kollat Alla Alla Har Samma Text Men Olika Storlekar På Stilen Vilket Gör Som Ni Kanske Förstår Till Olika Antal Sidor
,rune_15,2007-07-02T03:29Z,"This book is fake but still a good book.                                                            
you can see that it is fake when you are reading it it isint J.K Rowling style on it to bad becuse it was a good book and i hope the real one is better then this if it isint then i take this one as the real shit "
,severus_lexx,2007-07-02T14:57Z,"This is a fanfic, and it was written quite a long time ago by a person known as Melindaleo. The name is ""The Seventh Horcrux"". You may check for yourself whether this is true at melindaleo.com.
Nevertheless, the book is good, JKR style and all, though there is a bit too much romance and sexuality.  Melindaleo's other fanfics are written along the same lines, I guess that this is her style. 
I suggest you read ""The Seventh Horcrux"", it will help you pass the time until July 21st. "
,japanasian,2007-07-07T00:50Z,This is a fake because I have the original pre-copy of this book and word for word both books aren't even close to one another even for a fanfic it is really good reading but to all who dont have the actual book yet I'd wait you will agree that the 7th book is a by far the best I'm on chapter 3 of the new book I read this fanfic within 3-4 hours  and I havent even finished the real copy...
,tigerdon13,2007-07-08T20:49Z,"This message is for japanasian

If you have the original book could you post (upload it) so that we may read it?

Please do so. We would like to read it too.

Thanks"
,w8010i,2007-07-12T13:05Z,cool a good book
,shypys,2007-07-14T19:46Z,"1. 100  Seeders! Has the world gone crazy!!!
2. japanasian is a dumb blond probably to think that we will believe him/her"
,nedzweet,2007-07-18T01:22Z,"""stared morosely at the familiar visage"" - clearly the subtlety of JKR's writing is lost on the people that think this could actually be her work. A fake, and obviously so from the very first sentence."
,kjellijemt,2007-07-18T08:21Z,"This is a actuall real copy of the book and all the doubters will have to eat their own words about JK's idividual wrighting on the 21th. and of the note the last word in the book is not ""scar"" if you have followed what JK's said in her last interview.

When asked about whether ?scar? was the last word in the book as had been reported, she said: ?Scar? It was so for ages, and now it?s not. Scar is quite near the end, but it?s not the last word the last word now starts whit ""D"""
,eddywatson,2007-07-18T19:10Z,"LOL what a loser who ever wrote this! For starters the writing is in AMERICAN! the words are spelt in the American way, and not the English way

what a n00b"
,lord_death,2007-07-18T20:10Z,readable?
,raymonttcherian,2007-07-22T13:32Z,wer can i get the book itself... not some duped version
,Tinface,2007-07-24T06:06Z,"If I had the time I could copy mine, seeying as I finished it Saturday at like 11 PM...but its to damn hard and only costs 45 bucks...people reading a book on a PC? Are you stupid? 600 pages..."
,Shedek,2007-07-26T16:14Z,"Wow, a lot of you are rather abusive towards an innocent fanfiction author...

The author of this fanfiction actually went through some legal troubles when a publishing company in Mexico printed this about a year ago as the seventh book under the title of Harry Potter and the Serpent Shadow.  When she found out about what they were doing, she cooperated fully with Rowling's legal team.  She in no way was trying to fake a book seven for her own profit or to trick Rowling's fans, she was just writing a fanfiction for her own and other's reading pleasure."
,nyusz33,2007-08-04T11:47Z,"Minstryofsnd!

It was great! It is a superb fanfiction. I read it, and after finishing, I didn't care about the real one. I'v got that one too, but still gathering the will to read it.
Please upload the 8th book from this fanfiction writer if it will be available!"
,Weras,2007-08-26T23:46Z,This is better than the original! much better story. 
,HarryPMK,2008-09-15T10:15Z,Thanks for this. I was stunned. Thanks man !
