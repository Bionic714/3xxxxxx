This is the special edition of Nero 6 (6.6.1.3) for NEC Labelflash drives. It features a tweaked version of Nero Express 6 which contains the Labelflash label designer.  Install it with the default serial to give you the OEM restricted version of Nero 6, or use this serial 1A23-0009-9130-2306-3193-5946 to give you the full Ultra edition.  I use this program frequently with my NEC ND-4571A and it gives good results.  Have fun!
