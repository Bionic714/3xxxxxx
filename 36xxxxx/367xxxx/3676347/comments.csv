,the_crazy_swede,2007-11-12T16:42Z,it's real. and has no virus in it. but i think theres missing some stuff in the games since it's only a build...never released.
,tyupoop,2008-12-07T06:54Z,ok downloading...
,jNerd,2009-03-26T21:26Z,"This torrent rocks. It's 100% clean & self-boots. I'll be seeding all the DC games I've torrented until 4/20. After that you guys need to help-out.

& ""the_crazy_swede"" I haven't noticed anything missing from the build. The finished the retail game, it was just never released. + it includes Blue Shift.

This game has some of the highest-res graphics I've ever seen on the DC, especially B.S."
