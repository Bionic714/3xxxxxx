Ever since the very beginning in the year 2000, the BS.Player has been one of the world's most popular multimedia players. It is popular for many reasons, one however should be pointed out: BS.Player is the first player ever to enable its users to focus on watching the movie instead of dealing with poor computer capabilities or running around looking for a proper setting and codec.

The multimedia playback has not been and will never be disturbed by any annoying technical problem often experienced with software of this kind.
