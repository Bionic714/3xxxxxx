,millemis,2007-05-10T20:05Z,"Could not try it out yet - where are the seeders (downloaded 33 times!)??

But if - someday - it would finish, I would buy a double-layer dvd-rom - or run it through DVD-Shrink to make it fit to a normal dvd."
,ruisdb,2008-02-11T15:08Z,"I ear a lot of hiss.
Am i the only one?"
,BjornZweden,2008-03-27T10:26Z,"Thanks very much for this DVD !!!!!!!!

I've used DVD shrink to make the DVD fit on a 4.7 GB DVD+R - DVD Shrink could not do this at once. I shrunk the 6.9 Gb DVD and after that I had to shrunk the DVD that I had shrunk the first time again to make it fit. It's still a very good quality !!!  I quess you can also shrink the DVD with DVDfab to the size of a 4.7 GB DVD+R"
,PiratSA,2009-10-05T12:18Z,Not a good quality Video.
,SmauG69,2010-01-12T01:09Z,Thanks a million!  Absolutely appreciate and will continue to seed :)
