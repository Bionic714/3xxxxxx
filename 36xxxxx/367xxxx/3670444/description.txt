In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of
Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the
mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the
Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last
stands of history. Persian King Xerxes lead a Army of well
over 100,000 (Persian king Xerxes before war has about
170,000 army) men to Greece and was confronted by 300
Spartans, 700 Thespians and other Slave soldiers. Xerxes
waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or
withdraw left with no options he moved. The battle lasted
for about 3 days and after which all 300 Spartans were
killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected as a
local shepherd named Ephialtes defected to the Persians
and informed Xerxes of a separate path through
Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the
Greeks.
