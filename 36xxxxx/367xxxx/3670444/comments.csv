Quality is coarse overall, maybe adequate for a laptop/portable DVD player but I was disappointed when viewing on my 21"" iMac monitor.  I thought the 3.75 GiB size might indicate problems... but I wouldn't have had to guess (and waste 2 days of bandwidth) if the poster had bothered to write a real .NFO for this and not just cut and paste the IMDB plot synopsis."

By the way, you can play the movie on your PC by opening the .IFO with Windows Media Player."
