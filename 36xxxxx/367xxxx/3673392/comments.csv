,terraplane,2007-05-13T19:00Z,Anybody check this show out or what?
,Avocacado,2007-12-09T17:08Z,I was there!  We weren't allowed in at first b/c it was sold out so my friend and I just hung out behind the corner door and listened it- eventually the owner gave us the green light and we caught the second half- it was one of the best concerts I've been to this year...  Thanks so much for making this track available.

Many many thanks.

I hope others pick this up, I'll keep seeding it for while.  "

I'll be very glad if you could send me the original files (the 1.2 Go's one) if you still have it !

Thanks"
