,chillong,2007-04-24T14:51Z,"i am seeding. sorry but i have no clue why its uploading so slow, and why it wont show me as seeder (there are 3 guys downloading from me)"
,chillong,2007-04-24T15:38Z,"ok, upload is now on 5mb sec. but i will leave in about one hour, then il stop seeding. if u wont upload to eachother urself, the file will not be done!!! open your fukin upload-slots so this will be uploaded asap. i already upped 2 gb of those 3.5, but most of u guys are still at 3.5% :S"
,Olive74,2007-04-24T15:40Z,"Is this the multilinguage version ? Or only US version ? Hav u the multi one ? Seed it plz if u hav this one, THX"
,chillong,2007-04-24T15:47Z,they will come later...
,chillong,2007-04-24T17:51Z,"fast speed is over now, uploaded 20 gb. noone further than 40 %, not my problem. open your stupid upload, bitorrent wont work like that!
now u have 300kbit..."
,puggy,2007-04-25T07:04Z,Does this have a keygen? Does it include a volume license serial? Thanks.
,chillong,2007-04-25T14:20Z,"[k] included, if you can read. means: crack"
,puggy,2007-04-25T15:24Z,"Okay, nowhere did it mention crack or anything. And second, a crack is not a keygen. Learn to fucking communicate better, nerd. "
,cooter,2007-04-25T15:46Z,"first of all, you just insulted the guy who posted the torrent, at a time when the torrent is DEAD at 80% asshole. 

I was about to make plea that he might help us ALL by re-seeding long enough that we ALL could get the last 20% because the 4 or 5 people who grabbed the whole thing bailed as soon as they got it and left everyone else hanging.

But after your Einstein move, I wonder if any offer of appreciation can make up for the sheer insulting stupidity you put forth."
,cooter,2007-04-25T16:41Z,"further more not only are you arrogant, insulting and ignorant your just plain wrong, . assuming you even knew what [k] means, and apparently you don't when CLEARLY says ""[k] for all final apps guaranteed..."" yes , there is a fucking crack, not a keygen, learn to fucking read. 

266 people who have been dl for 20 hours thank you for your petulance"
,puggy,2007-04-25T16:59Z,"Then so be it. Since when did participating in the torrent network about ass-kissing and fluffing and all this emotional shit. If he can't handle it then that's his choice. Besides, there would be hundreds of seeds from other releases soon, and it will include a nice keygen. Do you realize that if Adobe Update does a patch it will render your stupid crack useless? Finally, here's a tip: Don't get insulted or emotional over an internet post. And seeders are not gods to behold. I'm out."
,chillong,2007-04-25T18:28Z,"ok, chill now
im continous UPLOADING, if u cant see that, then my bad...
its just, i am seeding with 300 kb, and this is slow, if you are not uploading to each other. i uploaded now on this line about 1.5 gigs. at the office, i upped nearly 20 gig. this is torrent is 3.5 gig, do the math. tomorrow (thats in about 12 hours) i will seed it again with 100mbit, then it should be finished by time. but, when u read the descriptino (i was too lazy to write a good one), there is [k], what means crack. this version needs a sn, but with the crack u get around the activation...
volume version would be better, but there is any out yet...

about ""emotional stuff"". normally i laugh about people u stop seeding, when u get fucked by other. i just said, a bit moore upload is needed, to get this fucking torrent seeded, again, 20 gigs uploaded should be moore than enough to get enough seeders... but again, now lets chill, and pls dont think that the other version is final. 2.5 gigs is NOT the final, that would be the latest beta, which is definatly not the same... (i mean the one that got uploaded just after mine. i have this verison also ( maybe already deleted))
and sorry for that maybe a bit weird comment (concerning language and phrases) but im totaly stoned right now, its beautiful weather here since about 2.5 weeks :)"
,chillong,2007-04-25T18:32Z,"sorry for this fucked language lol, i cant even follow myself when i reread it :)

as i cant edit my comment:
""emotional shit"": i wanted to say, that i laugh about seeders who complain about the leechers, and they are definaty not gods :), but still, u also have to understand the situation a bit"
,all_souls,2007-04-25T22:39Z,"I've got my ratio set to 1:2.
So, when it's done, it'll seed until it's uploaded twice over.
Is that adequate?"
,WorldFamous,2007-04-26T00:03Z,90.2% ... c'mon people - SHARE!
,chillong,2007-04-26T01:02Z,"yes, this is very good.
Important:
I will be offline now untill 8 clock GMT. then it will be 100mbit again... sorry for this slowness, but too many leechers for 300 kbit =)"
,ashattar,2007-04-26T05:05Z,great thx!

,goofus29,2007-04-26T21:18Z,"Seemed to download ok, but double clicking on Setup did nothing. Is this just for intel Macs or am i doing something wrong?"
,all_souls,2007-04-27T03:24Z,"Out of curiosity, will I need to get rid of all of my CS2 applications before I install, or was it just the CS3 betas?"
,No_Doubt,2007-04-27T07:31Z,all_souls - you can keep your CS2 programs. I've installed it and used the CS3 remover (I had the pre-release installed).  It didn't affect my CS2 programs so all is good there. =)
,all_souls,2007-04-27T16:01Z,"Thank you, No_Doubt."
,CherubRock,2007-04-27T19:12Z,what is the CS3 remover?..some kind of app to remove the ps3 beta properly?
,Unfrozen Caveman,2007-04-27T20:26Z,"Installed and running great ! The crack [k] works great as well - nicely done. Best loooking crack I've seen. (insert joke here) I ran included script to remove Photoshop beta but it missed some stuff in application suppport, in both the user/lib. ans system/lib.

Thanks, Chillong !"
,all_souls,2007-04-27T20:27Z,"This is a universal binary, correct?"
,Patjak,2007-04-28T09:21Z,"Maybe a stupid question, how do you use the crack file?"
,all_souls,2007-04-28T10:15Z,"Just installed a few hours ago.
Works absolutely flawlessly."
,jandk,2007-04-28T17:18Z,"Thanks for a great upload, chillong:-)

I've installed and applied the crack to all applications.
Do I need to add a serial number for each application? All of them seem to work ok.
What happens if I don't add a serial, are the programs time limited?"
,Patjak,2007-04-28T17:40Z,Can someone please tell me where to put the CRACK FILE?
,jandk,2007-04-28T22:11Z,"Patjak...just install CS3, then double-click the crack file, then double click on the icon in the new window that comes up.
Now a ""drop zone window"" pops up. Drag & drop each of the Adobe apps from the Applications folder and wait for the ""successfully patched"" message after every drop. Done!

Watch the QT movies in the dmg file.

Where can I find serials?"
,all_souls,2007-04-29T18:11Z,"I'm pretty sure you won't need serials, my friend.

I've used this every single day (with the crack) since I've gotten it, & there has not been a single time-limit notice."

,kyotograph,2007-06-19T15:38Z,"I really need help.

I had a previous version of Photoshop CS3 installed, but it had no crack, so I downloaded this one instead. I uninstalled my previous version by dragging the app to the trash (I realise this was my mistake) INSTEAD of using the uninstaller under Utilities. Unfortunately now I can't install Photoshop anymore because it conflicts with trace files left over from the previous version.

HELP.

I tried CS3Clean but I can't even type my password into the Terminal window. I tried typing but nothing comes out.

Is there a way I can wipe out all traces of the previous version of Photoshop? The uninstaller under Utilities does not work."

,akkhan360,2007-08-10T22:26Z,"INSTRUCTIONS TO GET CS3 DESIGN PREMIUM FULL VERSION (ENGLISH ONLY) FOR MAC:

1. Download these torrents:

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3656499/Adobe_Creative_Suite_CS3_Premium_Crack.3656499.TPB.torrent

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3653464/Adobe_CS3_Design_Premium_Suit.3653464.TPB.torrent

2. Delete the following folders:

Macintosh HD> Library> Application Support> Adobe

Home> Library> Application Support> Adobe

3. Open the .dmg (the on from the second torrent above) and install.

4.  Go to ""Applications> Adobe Photoshop CS3""

5.  Run the .dmg (from the first torrent).  The .dmg should have a CS3 logo as its icon picture.

6.  You can double click the ""[k] MovieGallery"" and watch the movies for further instructions or continue to read below.

7.  Double click on the Photoshop icon.  Drag and drop the installed Photoshop application (from step four) onto the blue window.  Let it do its magic and leave it alone for a while.  It may seem frozen but its not!  Once its done it will give the following message: ""The application has been successfully patched"".

8.  Do this for the other CS3 Design Premium programs but make sure you use only the corresponding crack applications.

This has worked for me.  There should not be any problems.  I would like to thank the torrent community for the seeding of CS3.  Thanx guys!!!"

but since i've installed leopard.. its giving me lots of problems..

so i tried to follow akkhan360s instructions..
and downloaded both those (and i suppose that crack is fixed for leopard by arcticblue)..
now i had uninstalled everything from the previous install.. and removed the library/application support/adobe folder as well.. 
but i was totally confused when he said to find the home/library/application support/adobe... I just could not find that.. i figured they are the same exact thing.. just different locations for maybe different versions of macs... 
once i downloaded the two said downloads (the dmg for the install and the new leopard crack), i installed the application and ran the patch process as described. I keep getting the This patch cannot be applied to this file error that a bunch of others on here got as well. 

i even went ahead and did the Terminal code things and I dont even know what that did. I am so frustrated that I am almost considering reformatting and going back to the old OS just so I can use my photoshop... please someone HELP...
