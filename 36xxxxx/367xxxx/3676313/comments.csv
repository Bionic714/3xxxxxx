,gladiator310,2007-11-01T16:46Z,"how can u burn this on a CDR if its 750+ mb

there can only be 700mb on 1 CD so how do you burn it on a CD? the rar file is 500mb but the .cdi file what you have to burn is like 780 mb"
,gladiator310,2007-11-08T17:22Z,"hey man someone answer please.. 

you dont have to tell me how to burn but just that im doing it fault then i know if i delete it or not"
,itzlogan,2007-12-19T15:38Z,You have to use Pades DiscJuggler to burn and it will use the extra 89mb as info as to how to specially burn the other 700mb. I haven't tried it with this game but I've done it on 12 other games w/o problem.
,gladiator310,2007-12-25T02:20Z,"ok, thanks man now it works ;)

and i had another problem when u try to burn, it says error something with the disk then diskjuggler ask you to try solve it and i always pressed yes but u just have to press no =)"
