,Amezis,2007-11-19T16:48Z,"This doesn't work for me. I've installed it and it seemed to work fine: The new languages have an ""ABC""-icon next to them, but when I select a language and start typing, it doesn't detect any errors even if I misspell words on purpose or if I try to write gibberish."
,distill,2008-01-30T19:43Z,"Well didn't work for me! And then I found http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3999985/MS_Office_Proofing_Tools_2007_(The_Joker) which works LIKE A DREAM!! So this torrent seems to be useless, unfortunately.."
,I-MrKnox-I,2008-07-26T15:58Z,"This torrent was meant for those unable to put their hands on the real 2007 LP... As this has now become available, I do not recommend anybody to download this torrent... "
