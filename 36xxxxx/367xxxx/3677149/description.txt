This is a "language pack" for Microsoft Office 2007!

It contains the following languages:

German, dutch, danish, norwegian, swedish, finnish, russian, italian, croatian, Hungarian, polish, romanian and portuguese (brazilian).

The pack only provides spell- and grammatic checking for the languages. It will NOT translate the menues etc. like the real SLP or MLP, but still, it's worth the money ;)

Take it or leave it!
