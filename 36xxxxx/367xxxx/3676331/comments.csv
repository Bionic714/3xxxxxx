Ive downloaded this and burnt it onto CD with DiscJuggler, which has worked with all my other DC discs.

However, when I put this in the console, it treats it like a music CD and doesnt play.

Please help

,Rigo84,2008-07-03T01:27Z,"This works GREAT. For those of you that haven't figured it out yet, these games are SEGA GENESIS games with a program that lets you play GENESIS games on a SEGA DREAMCAST. Just open up this file with ALCOHOL 120% and just burn it unto a CD-R(I used Memorex brand) I didn't even need to change anything on the options or settings, just BURN it and play it on a DREAMCAST console. It is going to ask you to play the CD, and do so. Then go all the way down to ROMS and choose it and then click on a game that you want. There are a few games that are not playable and most of them show up nicely, although the sound effects for mostly all games will remind you of NES or even ATARI sound effects. You may have to hold down start button for a while every time you choose a game or ROMS section."

,bloodonmysuit,2009-08-01T03:39Z,"Awesome emulator for DC!
Thanks so much.

I do have a question though, is there a way i can improve the audio quality of the games? 

The music seems choppy and broken on all the games, is this because they are roms and the audio quality is stripped when they were ripped from the cart?"

,abzilla,2010-02-21T22:53Z,"for those of you having trouble burning this game.  use BootDreams.  It's a great program that burns .cdi  games easily.  Just pick the last tab after installing, look for the .cdi file, and burn it.  

For the audio of the games, it seems like someone played around with the files, so you wont have the proper sound.  I'm trying to figure out what the different modes do, but to no avail.  If anyone knows, please post."

,FaerieGrl,2012-08-29T07:57Z,"It doesn't seem to work at all . I've d/led this same file from here more than 4 times this week. I've tested all of them and all I get is this....  ""bad checksum LoROM, Corrupt, Rom+Ram+Bat, NTSC, Sram:Corrupt, ID:_(tt, CRC32:8B841E0B""
They all open with the same error message.
Thanks anyway, It's very much appreciated."
