,rubberkeith,2007-04-25T19:40Z,"Downloading much, much faster than the other CS3 torrent :)

@chillong: What do you mean by 100% not final?
More importantly, does everything provided with the torrent actually work?"
,quiproquo,2007-04-25T20:15Z,"Be careful, folks. The ONLY no-activation version for ACS 3 is the ENTERPRISE Suite. Premium Suite still needs activation, Enterprise only a serial. The usually krack-solution is a problem for future updates..."

,ryapeter,2007-05-02T06:38Z,"Hi, 


I just want to clear up one thing. It seems there' 2 version up on the Internet. 


The crack work for 20070222 (I think it's release date) 


The other version I'm talking about is 20070321. I personally downloaded this one from another torrent site (basicaly because it's smaller file size (and my slow 5kbps download speed) 


The problem is the [k] is not working with the 20070321. I realize some people here having hard time with it. So I suggest you to check your version number before posting that the [k] not working.

,akkhan360,2007-08-10T22:23Z,"INSTRUCTIONS TO GET CS3 DESIGN PREMIUM FULL VERSION (ENGLISH ONLY) FOR MAC:

1. Download these torrents:

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3656499/Adobe_Creative_Suite_CS3_Premium_Crack.3656499.TPB.torrent

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3653464/Adobe_CS3_Design_Premium_Suit.3653464.TPB.torrent

2. Delete the following folders:

Macintosh HD> Library> Application Support> Adobe

Home> Library> Application Support> Adobe

3. Open the .dmg (the on from the second torrent above) and install.

4.  Go to ""Applications> Adobe Photoshop CS3""

5.  Run the .dmg (from the first torrent).  The .dmg should have a CS3 logo as its icon picture.

6.  You can double click the ""[k] MovieGallery"" and watch the movies for further instructions or continue to read below.

7.  Double click on the Photoshop icon.  Drag and drop the installed Photoshop application (from step four) onto the blue window.  Let it do its magic and leave it alone for a while.  It may seem frozen but its not!  Once its done it will give the following message: ""The application has been successfully patched"".

8.  Do this for the other CS3 Design Premium programs but make sure you use only the corresponding crack applications.

This has worked for me.  There should not be any problems.  I would like to thank the torrent community for the seeding of CS3.  Thanx guys!!!"

,zottty,2007-11-06T01:09Z,"A tip for those who installed Web Premium and removed it because the Crack didn't work. 
Doing this, the Design Premium setup quits after Initalizing.

To solve these issue, update your localdb (sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb) and find all the installer files (locate Adobe). Remove all the files which were part of the Premium Web installer or the Application itself. After this, the Design Premium setup works fine. "

,touchworks,2007-11-14T22:50Z,"Look ya'll, it's easy, no crack needed.  Turn off/unplug your internet connection, and set up normally.  No need to rename anything, no fuckin' about, just use a crack that works (there are a bunch to choose from, such as 1326-0651-7402-0424-4066-8309, which worked for me), and it will prompt you that it was unable to register online.  It will give you the option of saying ""never register,"" and bob's your uncle... the only caveat is that you can NEVER get an update.  It will ask you if you want tl update the first time you use any of the programs with an active internet connection, and you just hit cancel.  I'm sure in the next few months someone will put a cracked update on here anyway so no one will miss out.

INSTRUCTIONS TO GET CS3 DESIGN PREMIUM FULL VERSION (ENGLISH ONLY) FOR MAC:

1. Download these torrents:

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3656499/Adobe_Creative_Suite_CS3_Premium_Crack.3656499.TPB.torrent

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3653464/Adobe_CS3_Design_Premium_Suit.3653464.TPB.torrent

2. Delete the following folders:

Macintosh HD> Library> Application Support> Adobe

Home> Library> Application Support> Adobe

3. Open the .dmg (the on from the second torrent above) and install.

4. Go to ""Applications> Adobe Photoshop CS3""

5. Run the .dmg (from the first torrent). The .dmg should have a CS3 logo as its icon picture.

6. You can double click the ""[k] MovieGallery"" and watch the movies for further instructions or continue to read below.

7. Double click on the Photoshop icon. Drag and drop the installed Photoshop application (from step four) onto the blue window. Let it do its magic and leave it alone for a while. It may seem frozen but its not! Once its done it will give the following message: ""The application has been successfully patched"".

8. Do this for the other CS3 Design Premium programs but make sure you use only the corresponding crack applications.

I already downloaded a bunch of CS3 trial programs -- do I need to uninstall these before using these two cracks?"

5. opened up the 2nd torrent above.

6. went into applications, opened the photoshop folder and dragged the icon into the (k) window that the 2nd torrent opened.

7. waited for it to unscramble/setup/crack/ the program - (took a good minute for me)

8. double clicked on the new and improved photoshop icon and walla - it works!!!

So I used the key: 1326-0110-5569-6121-4741-2255 
to register the program.

Then I used a Windows keygen to generate the activation key.

Stupidly, however, all keygen I could find do not accept my serial.
They all insist to gen their own serial and activation key. But their gened key dont work with my Photoshop.
Only the key above does.

What I did is, I used the key above.
Then, tried to activate by phone.
Then I got input the activation code to the keygen. (Although the serial in the program and in the keygen are different.)
And I used the activation key from the keygen to activate Photoshop.

And it works!

,awstevenson,2009-06-16T13:03Z,"Can someone help me at all - I'm using Leopard, have just downloaded this torrent and all was working perfectly until installation.
I previously installed a trial of CS4 Illustrator but then couldn't get it to work so uninstalled it and downloaded this one. Yet when I get halfway through installing it asks me to insert my Adobe Illustrator disc...which obv I don't have. How come it does this :-(

Does anybody know a way to completely wipe from my mac the fact that I ever tried Illustrator CS4!? Please please help :-)"

,sewcial,2011-03-24T13:08Z,"I'd like to thank the people who offer these downloads. I am new to this so I am learning as I go. Last night I got the Mac OS 10.5 and it looks good so far. I would like to know how long I need to leave the uTorrent window open for seeding after my download has finished. I left it open all night, but his morning, when I looked at it, it had an exclamation mark and a red error alert in one of the columns. I deleted that so I don't recall exactly what each column said. 

I would like to do it right. Can someone please give me tips?  My Leopard disk looks good and I will try it as soon as the new HD I've ordered arrives to resurrect my Powerbook G4. This CS 3 will also go into the G4. I certainly can't afford all new stuff for the G4 when I just bought an iMac so I really appreciate all you guys who do this for us. 

One more thing. Can I use my browser and other multitasking things while the torrent is downloading to my computer? "
,aphrospice,2011-07-12T04:26Z,Some please seed been searching this to install on my old emac! Thank you in advance!
,citizen_a,2012-03-11T18:30Z,"Great torrent!! I've been looking around for days to find a CS3 version that works...

This one really is a volume license version, so with the proper serial number (1326-0651-7402-0424-4066-8309) there is no activation needed. Just install, put the serial, click ""Never register"" and you're done! The crack included in the torrent is therefore useless...
