Mozy (version 1.8.2.3) will allow you to backup up to 2GB worth of data online for free. Here is a list of features from their site:

* 2GB of free, secure storage (Or go Unlimited for $4.95/month!)
* Open/locked file support
* Block-level differential backup
* 128-bit SSL support (to secure your data during transport)

Oh, also: If you decide to try Mozy out, feel free to use this link to register (it has my referral code). If you do, then both you and I will get an extra 256MB free. ;)
