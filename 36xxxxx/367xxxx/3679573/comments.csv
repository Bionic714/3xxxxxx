,tgies,2007-05-04T01:43Z,"the hell do you mean ""seed more"" genius

deal"
,Ridskog,2007-06-01T00:00Z,I'm comfused. is this two games really? Jedi knight 2 AND jedi knight mysteries of the sith?
,Ridskog,2007-06-01T00:00Z,Nevermind i figured it out...
,dhelor,2007-07-10T18:59Z,"There's a minor problem with the CUE file for Mysteries of the Sith, but it's easily fixed.  Just open the file using Notepad.  the first line of the file will say: FILE ""mots"" BINARY

What you need to do is change that line to: FILE ""mots.bin"" BINARY

That will make it work properly."
,closetpervert,2007-08-05T03:02Z,"Are you sure this has all the songs in it? Becouse yes, John Williams kicks ass and i'd hate to download a copy of Jedi Knight that hasn't got the songs in it for the sixth time, especially since becouse this is going to take forever."

,Jmuerte,2009-09-10T01:12Z,does this work on vista?
,Magog56,2010-05-12T23:16Z,"Yes this game does work on 64-bit Vista, but you have to manualy install it.

How to manualy install:

And if the game crashes when you start, try this:

Creating a shortcut with a -windowgui parameter fixed crashes for me.

Other than that the game works fine! Great torrent, will seed for a week."
,Pretender77,2010-12-01T16:13Z,Thank you!
,Nomadif,2012-02-18T21:04Z,Theres no sound for JKDF2 as in level music. If your playing any level there is no music.
