Unique in the history of modern music, the Clash was one of the most explosive and exciting bands to come out of the fertile late-1970?s London scene. The Clash took the manic anger of British punk and transformed it into a political and aesthetic agenda. The classic line-up of the Clash was together only seven years. In that time, they defined punk rock from a British perspective, celebrated the American roots of rock and roll, and embraced Jamaican ska, dub and reggae sounds. Their debut album became the best-selling imported record when it was denied a U.S. release. Album after album, as they railed against the status quo of corporate rock and safe middle-class values, the Clash was a burning reminder of why punk mattered.

The Clash's 1988 double-disc, 28-track compilation The Story of the Clash, Vol. 1 presents a relatively thorough overview of their career. It is a Platinum album in the United States. In some ways, the double-disc, 28-track compilation The Story of the Clash, Vol. 1 does its job quite well ? if the job is indeed presenting a relatively thorough overview for casual fans. The great majority of the band's hits and signature tunes are here, including album tracks and such non-LP singles as "Bankrobber," "Armagideon Time," and "Capital Radio," albeit in nonchronological order. While there may be many worthy tunes missing, nothing here is undeserving of inclusion, and its expansive method of operation works in its favor, since it hints at the richness of the Clash's music. After all, it's no great loss to have such official singles as "Hitsville U.K." missing, since there are some extraordinary album tracks included.
