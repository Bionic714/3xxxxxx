A little something I flung together yesterday.
The intention was to create some dark, slammer techno
but instead it turned out to become some kind of
full-on, happy retro trance tune.
A bit gay, but maybe someone will like. Someone gay.

Btw, "Ex Machina" refers to "deus ex machina" which means
"god out of the machine", a term surfaced from theaters
way back in the days. The magic created on stage, illusions
of worlds an so forth created by the machines backstage,
gave the expression "Deus ex Machina".
"Ex Machina" in this case is with some irony since I sat 
for 13 consecutive hours composing, but still some morons
say "all you do is press play and the sounds come out".
The text is from "1984" - "Listen to that, how do you make
a song written by a machine sound so beautiful".
