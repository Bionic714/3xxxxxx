Release Notes:

Manic Street Preachers return to an ambitious,
edgier and energetic rock sound this spring with new
album 'Send Away The Tigers' . The first single to
be taken from the album, 'Your Love Alone Is Not
Enough' is a duet with Nina Persson of The
Cardigans, of whom the band have been long time
fans. The song was recorded in New York earlier this
year and is described by Nicky Wire as "Keith Moon
drums, Pete Townsend power cords, sonically similar
to Hole's 'Celebrity Skin' - 'Everything Must Go'
era - euphoric rock.. lyrically a two-way
conversation in my head about love, religion,
democracy and Richey".
