,rockstar11998,2008-03-12T04:10Z,"You gents that believe Islam is wonderful and peachy keen need to open your ears and eyes a little more.  Watch Undercover Mosque if you want to know for a fact what Muslims are saying about Muhammad's teachings today.  Leaders of Islam are saying its ok to rape young girls and that it is ok to kill the Jew and the Christian.  That doesn't sound like a prophet or spiritual leader to me.  Satan's minion maybe but not anything I'd want to ascribe to.  Don't get me wrong.  The Islamic Empire probably helped server some of God's purposes and help fulfill prophecy but no doubt Satan was rooting for Islam rather than the Chosen People of God who were slaughtered by both Catholics and Muslims.  I am Christian and know that the Jews will once again be ""remembered by the Lord"" at the last days.  Islam is not a religion to be understood except to know your enemy if you are on the side of goodness and righteousness.  Anything that promotes Jesus Christ as nothing less than the Son of God is a church/religion of the devil.  One of Satan's many names is the great deceiver."
,rockstar11998,2008-04-03T20:46Z,bodthedog - no fairytale.  Just facts and evidence.  Prophecies are coming true today and will continue just as they are explained in the scriptures.  The book of Revelations states that the Jews will rebuilt their temple.  Don't be surprised when this happens ok.
,rockstar11998,2008-04-08T06:25Z,"bodthedog - I don't know where you get your facts but they are dead wrong.  The book of Revelations chapter 11 verses 1 and 2 has the scripture that talks about the Jewish temple being rebuilt.   Right after this happens comes the two prophets (literally) to preach repentance. So how can you say it already happened.  Tell me the date that it was rebuilt since the Romans knocked it down??  Apparently you don't know the scriptures at all.  If you did you certainly wouldn't be arguing with me.  The same goes with the majority of the Christian community.  They just don't know the true meaning of the scriptures or even study them completely.   I really suggest you read Isaiah chapter 5.  If you can read that and not say it's happening today then you are not worth any more of my effort.

I can give you one date you might be interested in and can research.  The year 1830 is when this passage was fulfilled: Isaiah chapter 29 verses 11 and 12.  Also Acts chapter 3 verses 20-24.
Thanks for making me look up passages to what I'm sharing with you.  It made me stumble once again upon a verse that describes why you won't grasp the things I share.  Isaiah chapter 28 verses 9 and 10 describe how you need to learn the first things before you can add more knowledge to it.  It is like giving a baby meat when all it can handle is milk.  Sorry for trying to shove the meat of the Gospel down your throat when you are just a babe when it comes to spiritual things."
,rockstar11998,2008-04-08T17:01Z,bodthedog - I have to make one more comment about yours.  The notion that I can give you a prophecy that came true from the Bible 'THAT THE WHOLE WORLD AGREES ON' is simply ridiculous.  How many signs were given of Christ's birth and yet the very people Christ came to save ignored them and dismissed him as their Savior.  Do you think people are any different today.  God sends witnesses to prove his words.  People that are too blinded by sin and carnal lusts will not even notice these signs.  That's why he says WATCH for them.  Just because the whole world won't agree upon something says nothing of the truth of th matter.  You truly don't understand how God operates yet.
,rockstar11998,2008-04-10T02:17Z,"bodthedog - It's funny to me how the Book of Mormon mirrors these days so perfectly.  Here is your statement: 'GIVE ME THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE, NOT WORDS FROM A BOOK, EVIDENCE THAT I CAN SEE, FEEL AND UNDERSTAND'.  In essence you are saying show me a sign!, show me a sign! right?  There are a few gentlemen in the Book of Mormon that have the exact same attitude as you have - no matter what you're told you just ramble on about something else and deny deny deny the truth right in front of your face.  Here is what happened to one gentlemen such as yourself Alma 30:43-49 - And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words. But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and call things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator. And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is no God? And yet will ye deny against all these witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show me a sign. And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed. But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more. Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe. Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.
Now I'm not saying this will happen to you but this is the way you are headed Korihor!!!!
It's funny I just remembered this story after taking a nap.  God works in mysterious ways."

""Leaders of Islam are saying its ok to rape young girls and that it is ok to kill the Jew and the Christian"" - by rockstar11998. 

Damn idiot dont talk if u dont know shit. In Islam Nationalism is FORBIDDEN. It is the Christian and the Jews that says it is ok to kill Muslims.
I live in Sweden and alot of these Swedish ppl (Who is Christians) rape their youngers. I hear it on TV and read it on the papers almost every week if not every day.

,Serkone,2008-05-20T12:40Z,"I hate when people talk without knowing anything. Dont talk crap about islam if u dont know anything about it. Media is bullshit, 90% of the information u get from there is bullshit.

I have nothing against christians but ive seen many of them wearing a cross around their neck and still going around and doing sins like beating, killing, ppl and so on. i mean damn is that normal?

When i ask ppl who use a cross around their neck if their religious here in sweden they say "" No im atheist , i just use it cuz it looks good "" hmmmm..... =|

Not all self bombers are terrorists. read more about that. ask the right ppl and u will learn why they do it. in fact i can say it now, if u live in a country like that and some west pricks come to ur country and starts killing inocent people for fun and for some oil ink ur whole family but u. How the hell would u react? stand in a corner and do nothing while they kill ur son, brother, mother and so on? ofc u would do anything in ur power to stop these men from killing more of ur brothers and sisters. abviously u cant just run in with a AK cuz skilled marines would popp u in a sec. so u get a bomb and sneak into a whole squad of marines and blow them up. so u get ur revenge and save ur country at the same time.

,rockstar11998,2008-05-21T17:51Z,"Serkone - The United States has the right to step in and help out these countries because they are trying to be helpful to the innocent who are dying at the hands of evil dictators and rulers who let their people starve and let one ethnic group kill off another one.  We don't do that in America.  If the rest fo the world is too chicken to step in and help them out or if the UN won't don't anything but try to negotiate - which of course these people don't care one bit about - the US step in to be their savior.  Quit supposing we are doing worse to these people.  The problem is when we go in to help resolve situations some innocents get hurt because the murderers hide within the homes and crowds while shooting at our soldiers.  Or when we bomb certain areas of tactical importance some innocent people are bound to get killed.  The greater good outweighs these deaths tho.  I'll never say that your view is right Serkone.  I don't know where you get the idea that America is so bad but I can assume you are middle eastern and have been fed all sorts of lies about what our country's true intentions are.  We are not seeking power.  We are seeking stability in the world and sure we benefit from it some economically too.  But we've spent more money on military helping others than we are benefiting if you looked at the numbers.  Our presidents have given oaths to preserve liberty around the world and we intend to keep our promises.  Just because we are now on the offensive here and there some of you backward thinking goofballs think we are trying to dominate the world.  Wrong.  We are just trying to maintain peace in the world and help those that are unfairly treated by their governments or groups within countries that are oppressed.  So no matter how much you rant and rave about our actions we are intending to do good no evil.
BTW Islam is a religion for those who like to be pushed into heaven and have no free will.  Islam is based on a bunch of lies and perversions of Judaism and Christianity.  Satan is the one who gave Muhammad the words to speak which became the Koran.  He would go though seizure like states before he would dictate his sayings.  If that's not being overtaken by an evil spirit I don't know what is.  Muhammad was the messenger of Satan not God.  The Koran is isn't worth its weight in toilet paper.  Over a billion people have been deceived.  To say that Jesus Christ is less than a divine son of God is to deny the atonement and resurrection.  This makes Muhammad a type of anti-Christ and of course a false prophet.  All true prophets testify of the mission of Jesus Christ and the atonement.  Edgar Casey was also another type of false prophet.  He was overtaken by evil spirits - in a sleeping trance - when he did his readings.  His eyes would flutter shortly before he would give his readings.  Satan uses men like these guys who want to help others but instead they end up teaching all sorts of false doctrines and ideas which lead people to stray from the Gospel.  Jesus Christ said there would come many false prophets and there are many more to come I assure you.  If you don't believe Satan can take over someone and teach them to speak evil things just look at Hitler as a prime example.  He also tried to do a good thing for his country but he ended up trying to establish an empire and wanted to exterminate all of the Jews.  Islam also wants to exterminate the Jews so you can see how Satan used both Muhammad and Hitler to try to thwart the words of God.  The Jews are supposed to rebuild their temple before Christ comes again.  If you take away the Jews then that would make God a liar.  I have much more to say about the matter but this will suffice for now.
Thanks for quoting me too.  You need to watch ""Obsession"", ""What the West Needs to Know"", and ""Undercover Mosque"" to know why I said those things.  There are many other videos about how evil radical Muslim is and more and more so called ""peaceful"" Muslims are joining their ranks.  Jihad is overtaking the majority of Muslims.  As you know are two type"
,Serkone,2008-05-21T22:22Z,"Wow... Great story. i actually liked one thing u said: "" I totally agree with this being hypocritical. My church doesn't use the cross as a symbol of our faith. We use our actions and the way that we live our lives as a symbol of our belief. I've never worn a cross my whole life. I wish other Christians wouldn't either. The cross focuses on the death of Jesus Christ rather than on his life and resurrection. He did so much more for us than die for our sins. That was by far the greatest thing he did but we should be living for Christ not dwelling on his death. ""

i've allways thought about that why ppl wearing crosses, that its just a symbol on what jesus was killed on.

I've heared many ppl talk almost the same words before and all come from a american not some other ppl. but u are the first to say that Islam is a satanic religion. but i understand u, u do not know so much about Islam. So i have no comments about this. this is a patriotic speach :|
and u ARE the best ppl in the world. no other man is better than u. no man should be called a man but u. u are the superior race. OK?

Dont say u know anything cuz as i said earlier: If u knew anything, anything at all about Islam u wouldnt say these things. u just keep living ur sweet american life and denie the real throuth.

hate brings only hate man. u christians/ americans have not learned it yet it seems. u are no better country than germany was back in Hitlers time. dont use terrorists as an excuse for all the innocent peoples u killed in the east, ur beloved marines were competeing with eachother who kills the most arabs. raping, killing little girls. there is no end for what u have done to the peoples down there. enough of this. its impossible to talk to brain washed peoples like yourself. bye bye and may Allah help you find the right path."
,rockstar11998,2008-05-22T07:12Z,"Serkone - This is no patriotic speech when I speak of Islam being contrived by the Devil, although I am very patriotic.  Islam is a bunch of crafty lies Satan has put together drawing from the Christian and Judaic beliefs.  Race and superiority have nothing to do with my sayings.  Although Islam focuses on superiority as you well know.  Or have you not watched Undercover Mosque or read the passages in the Koran where it says that Jews and Christians are no better than pigs and monkeys.  I know what I know about Islam because I am indeed American and the freedom of press and freedom of speech has allowed me to see Islam for what it truly is.  Try saying that in Saudi Arabia or Iran.  They are told lies daily about other countries and their beliefs and actions.  Quit saying I know nothing of Islam.  I know way more than I need to know to know it was designed by Satan and is his greatest tool at deceiving so many today and causing all sorts of wars and death.  Your speech about hate is amusing.  I've been told to hate the sin not the sinner.  I hate Islam because it causes many to sin.  Islam teaches murder is ok, rape is ok, subjugation of women is ok, intolerance is ok, and so many more negative things.  I know Islam.  It's sad you don't.  I take no responsibility for the 'Marines' that did those wicked things.  Just like you don't have to claim responsibility for the wicked things the terrorists do.  But instead you choose to befriend them and be sympathetic towards them which would make you somewhat responsible for what they do.  If the so called 'good' Muslims won't stand up for goodness then apparently Islam isn't very good after all.  By brain is washed of the confusion and lies spewed out by all of the false religions out there including Islam.  I like having a clean brain where i can think and be inspired rather than led around without true knowledge and be blinded by all of the ideas of men."

u say: ""Islam is a bunch of crafty lies Satan has put together drawing from the Christian and Judaic beliefs""

dude back in the old days u christians were murdering all the jews like Hitler. all the jews fled from the west cuz of that. Thanks to the Turkish empire - Ottomans ( muslims )  who ruled back then, they warmly got accepted becouse Islam have no Nationalism, and accepts all people inc religions . )  they live yet today not mainly cuz of the empire but a huge amaount of them, i can easily say that isreal wouldnt exist if the empire wasnt there. again.... READ. Why is the american facts right and no other? Where have you read that Islam aloves rapeing? subjugation for woman? whaaat??  where have u seen / read that =| Murder?? man you do not know anything... Murder? you are keep saying hate words, i dont say its not normal coming from a patriot but whatever. Murder??  hmph.

Jesus Christ is our prophet as much as it is yours. and so is Abraham.

READ man its kinda hard to speak with a guys that doesnt know anything. u say its satanic but read the Koran it will be easier to talk and u will understand more much more im 100% sure of it.
im gonna get a Bible too so i can read about it and see if ur comments and attetude is accepted by ur religion. my brother knows more than me about these things but he says that he can found over 5000 wrongs in the Bible. not as a muslims aspect. just wrong scientistly. i will bring u the wrongs here in time so u can see them.

so if a Muslims Murders someone, im talking about killing a innocent people and wanting to kill those innocent people. that man who does it IS no Muslim. if a Muslim rapes a woman he IS no Muslim. If a Muslim subjugations a woman, he IS no Muslim. and by the way those kinds of sins like raping for an example doesnt happen within muslim peoples at all. Americans rape there not the muslims. Americans murder not the muslims. ("" the Iraqi peoples shot one rocket and hit its target wich is the marines. americans get mad and sends one rocket and randomly destroy every living man on the area inc innocent peoples like childrens and so on""). 
so pls dont talk about americans going to save them and all becouse they dont give a shit. join the marines and look for urselves. but i bet if u did u would prolly go and help the marines popping even more innocents.
please man dont get me started i know alot more what you have done there. more than u know. many americans i've talked to admits it. but their are not patriots/ nationalist like u.

how can the good muslims stand up when the americans popps them. there are still many peoples at the east. in the war zones. the most of the peoples just sits in their homes. its WAR man and they are not even defending themselves and their country. doesnt that say something about if murder is aloved in Islam? if the muslims had the tec u had and we went into ur country and started to bomb every house we saw and every christian we saw would u sit in a corner and wait for them to take over and mess things out in ur own country? dont say yes cuz u would lie. u would find a rifle from somewhere and help out. but this will not happen cuz muslims are not interested of creating weapons of mass destruction like u do. u see what im trying to say? or are u too blinded by ur patrioism. im supposted to hate u now cuz all of the evil thought u have about Islam but i dont cuz u are one of many millions of peoples who dont fully understand Islam. they only say what they been told and what they've read in the papers and think that is enough to say what Islam is but it REALLY dont.. 

Im telling u again Islam has more to it than u know. its not that simple. please look into it i would appreciate it. 
by reading more about Islam will also open ur heart more and isolate the hate u got for other peoples like muslims."

dude back in the old days u christians were murdering all the jews like Hitler.'  Since when? which group of people are you talking about.  Certainly not America.  Lol you are talking about the Nazis not Christians you retard.  Christians had nothing to do with driving out the Jews.  Satan was leading that cause.  You are just trying to create a circular argument which is just what Satan would do.  Since Islam is so peaceful and accepts all religions as you say, why can't a bunch of Christians migrate to Saudi Arabia and worship freely.  How about if they tired moving to Iran or Pakistan.  Ya, I'm sure they'd be warmly welcomed if the they were forced out of their country.  Same goes for the Jews.  Those places would kill them before they would welcome them in.  You want to know where I got my nformation right.  I already told you.  But here is the list of videos to watch again. ""Israel, Islam and Armageddon"", ""Undercover Mosque"", ""Obsession"", ""Lions for Lambs"", ""CNN - God's Muslim Warriors"", ""BBC - Unholy War"", and ""What the West Needs to Know"".  If you don't get good links here try emule and mininova.  I've watched a few more since then including Secrets of the Koran - from the History Channel.  This all mention books that can be sold at Mosques Islamic book ships that teach these sorts of teachings about women, girls, murdering unbelievers, and of course how wonderful terrorism is.  Don't say I don't have the full story because I do.  I've seen Islam: Empire of Faith and a few other pro - Islamic videos.  But I already knew before seeing any of these films that Islam was evil and steers people away from Jesus Christ.  Satan is the founder of Islam and Muhammad was his tool for spreading its injustice and perversions of Christianity and Judaism.   To claim Jesus Christ was only a prophet is blasphemy  He was a son of God with a greater mission than you could ever know. If you take away the atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ then you are no better than the Hindu or Buddhists. Jesus Christ is vital to us having the forgiveness of sins because of the judgments of God. Without his sacrifice we have no way to be cleansed from sin.  Without that we cannot return to God's presence.  No unclean thing can dwell with God.  You keep telling me to read but sorry I don't like to read that much.  I do read the Bible and the Book of Mormon a lot though.  I'd rather watch a video and have others do most of the research.  Time to time I go to the internet and read some articles and statements.  I'd just rather watch something.  I find lots of mistakes in the Bible too.  I mainly blame the Catholic church for that.  I'm so grateful I have the Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price, and the Doctrine and Covenants to back up everything I read in the Bible and clarify its mistakes.  My understanding of how the Holy Spirit works and teaches me also helps me know what things are wrong with other religions such as Islam.  I've been a missionary before and have spoken with Muslims time to time.  I way more than you give me credit for.  I just choose to be more on the warning people side of things now versus have a nice kind discussion about how wonderful some of its teachings are.  We need to be worried about the non-wonderful teachings that teach killing in the name of God is great and making others your slaves and such.  I don't want America to be taken over like Europe is already.
Now you try to talk about the Iraq war.  If your soldiers wouldn't hide themselves within the homes and markets of the innocent they wouldn't get hurt.  They randomly bomb whole crowds with car bombs just so they can kill a few soldiers or those who support the US.  You have no argument and everyone already knows you are a terrorist sympathizer. I am not saying the US doesn't do bad things but we have to resort to bad tactics like the terrorists in order to make some ground on winning the war.  As Nostradamus says it will be a fruitless war.  I know this already but I'd rath"

Now about Jesus Christ.  Yes indeed Jesus Christ is a type of God.  He is the God of the Old Testament, he is Jehovah, he is a glorified being with the power to create worlds, he created this world, he has the power to forgive sins, he had power over life and death.  He will be just like God the Father and create many worlds.  In the Bible it speaks of God saying let US make them in OUR image.  That is the plural form of God. (us and our)  My church is the only ones that believe in this doctrine so don't be surprised if this is new to you.  I never said we should pray for him or to him.  We are supposed to pray to God the Father (Heavenly Father) in the name of Jesus Christ.  Just like Jesus showed us to.
You won't be able to speak to me because I already know the truth and you are not able to question any of my beliefs.  Islam is flawed and everyone knows that.  If they don't know it then they need a history lesson.  You need a history lesson too.  There is no God but The Eternal Father and Jesus Christ was his son.

,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T00:45Z,For some reason my repsonse to Carl wont go through all it says is database error.  I'm going to try to chunk it apart here so it make look weird.
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T00:46Z,"CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist - I have to respond to this statement - 'Mormons are Christians but conveniently disassociate themselves from the ?mainstream?'  Yes you finally admit we are Christians!!!  Yes we do not associate ourselves with the false doctrines and limitations that mainstream Christianity holds to.  We believe in revelation and additional scripture and of course Authority.  Let's not forget a living prophet to lead us and teach us what is wrong and evil so we can avoid it.  Sure the Bible helps with this but today is so complex it takes a little more guidance to steer clear of the Grey areas of sin.  It's interesting that you mention fastest growing religion.  Last I checked the LDS church was the fastest growing Christian church.  We do it God's way through missionary work, not Satan's way through fear, force, and punishment."
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T00:50Z,"CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist - 
I'm glad you brought up this statement - 'Just turn on your TV and check out the allegations of incest, pedophilia, child molestation, forced sex, rape, polygamy on FLDS flock in Texas!'  "
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T00:51Z,"CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist -   Wake up Carl! They are a split off group from us.  They in no way associate with us or we with them.  Our church has abandon polygamy because God willed it.  The FLDS church are polygamists and that is against the law.  Last I checked the LDS church's Articles of Faith states we believe in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law."
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T00:52Z,CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist -   So stop trying to make us all look the same.  They don't use the same scriptures as us or follow our prophet and current church policies.  That's like saying oh look at the Baptist preachers who molested these kids and try to pin it on the Church of England.  Are you retarded or just very uninformed?? 
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T00:54Z,"CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist - Seeing how you associate The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (aka LDS Church or Mormons) with all of the polygamist groups I understand why you are so against 'Mormons'.  We try to steer away from being called Mormons because the first thing that comes to mind are those polygamist groups.  They are allowing themselves to be called Mormons because they use the Book of Mormon (to a point) and because of their history that is linked with our church before they broke off.  So saying all members of protestant religions as protestants doesn't work too well either.  I think they'd rather be called Baptists. Methodists, Presbyterians, Born Agains, or whatever. "
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T00:55Z,"CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist - We prefer the shorter form of LDS church Members rather than Mormons.  Thanks for allowing me to clear all of this up.  I am totally against what is going on with the FLDS folks in Texas too.  They should all be imprisoned and paternity tests should be given to see which men are to be punished the most.  The women are conspirators so they should also be punished.  Yes, Rape and Incest are against the policies of the LDS church."
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T01:11Z,CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist - We do not engage in such practices and never have.  Before we stopped polygamy it was basically a way for the widows to be taken care of and a way for the church to grow.
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T01:15Z,CarlWilfilUranus - aka Korihor - aka Antichrist -   Please give me more topics to clear up for you.
,rockstar11998,2008-06-13T01:16Z,It's weird how I wasn't unable to say something about the daughter of noah or it would just give me a database error.

,angryheathen,2008-11-16T01:45Z,"This movie is nothing but pure propaganda.
It omits all the evils of Muhammed. The evils of Muhammed are written down in the Quran and the Hadith so it is no use to create propaganda like this as anybody can check the facts from the Quran and Hadith and see for themselves that Muhammed was an evil person and his religion a scam for money, sex and power."
,realturk,2008-12-14T04:32Z,you guys don't now a shit about islam so shat ta fuck up. watch the movie maybe you all learn something 
,ssj5legend,2009-03-02T03:21Z,"Dumb witted numb nuts, all you who are against/unbelievers in/of Islam... You are people of little, if any, understanding. Islam in short means Peace (acquired by submitting your will to almighty god) in the Arabic tongue and following his commandments that he has sent through many warners/prophets (including Jesus/Isa) of previous nations, before the Arabs also, and the last revelation was indeed revealed to Mohammed (PBUH), bear in mind that every other religious scripture has changed since it was revealed, and many contradictions are now therein those scriptures of old. WHY? Because of human intervention, surely if it were the case with the Quran then there would not be such an increase in people accepting Islam today, and believe me they are not brainwashed..."
,ssj5legend,2009-03-02T03:23Z,"Its simple truth, Islam is the only religion that gives solutions to the problems of today weather or not you like it. (We shall soon show them our signs unto the farthest horizons and into themselves until it becomes clear to them that this is certainly the truth. *Quran Chapter 41 Verse 53*)"
,poktav,2009-03-03T13:52Z,"it seems to me that some people are modern Abu Jahl, enemy of the prophet. he used to be called Father of wisdom and thought to be very intelligent. still, he would not see the beauty of islam,bcoz he was dumb and blind. he was destined for hell. likewise, there are many Abu Jahls wandering around spitting venom against Islam bcoz they can't see its beauty. to hell with them. we should have no sympathy for them nor should we bother about their last abode.

,Wolf_359,2009-06-01T20:47Z,"Thanks for the torrent, I never thought I'd find The Message on PB.  It was a quick download."
,PakistaniDragon,2010-01-24T22:34Z,"Aslamu-Alaikum,

I hope everyone is well. This movie is in English with no available subtitles. The picture and sound quality are very good and the movie is in four parts. The making of the movie is a separate file and there's also a 2 minutes and 46 seconds long stills compilation from the movie.

A very good effort.

Thank You

From what I have learned thus far, this movie is the best representation of the truth about Islam. With all that is going on in the world today and many people's misconceptions about Islam this is a must see for all.

Not only is it an educational masterpiece... The Message has a brilliant musical score, beautiful cinematography, a wonderful script, and terrific acting. If your video stores do not carry it, order it from Amazon.com and learn the truth about the origins of the worlds fastest growing religion and what it stands for. "
,barton101,2012-08-09T15:35Z,"Next time, please at least include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
