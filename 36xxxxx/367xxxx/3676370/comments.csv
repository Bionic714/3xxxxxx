CDI's are pretty much meant for Sega Dreamcast CONSOLEs and not emulators. and yes.. people still have them :P

1) Get the Utopia Boot Disc 1.1 and DC bios files (dc_bios.bin & dc_flash,bin), unzip both on the Chankast folder

2) Load the Utopia Boot Disc first on Daemon Tools, start Chankast and emulation, then wait until this screen appears 


3) Swap the UBD with your CDI iso file, and wait some seconds.

OR

Maybe this one can help you out
