Between the 15th and the 19th Centuries up to 15 million people were forced to migrate from the African continent to the New World, where they were forcibly enslaved.
As part of the commemorations for the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the British transatlantic slave trade, Free at Last investigates the unexplored history of black and African resistance to slavery.
What were the acts of rebellion and sacrifice that brought the slave trade to an end? Who were the heroes of the story?

Part Three: Cultural DNA

At the time of the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade in 1807 one's African roots were not something to be proud of.
Civil rights activists such as Marcus Garvey changed that.
In a speech in 1937 he told his black audience: "We are going to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery because whilst others might free the body, none but ourselves can free the mind."
Part three explores the diaspora's reconnection with Africa.
