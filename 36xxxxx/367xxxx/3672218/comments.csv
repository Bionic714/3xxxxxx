cd2 
Triple X - Andy Jay Powell.. is it not Savon - Break the silence??? 

and Chemistry - Prophecy - ??? I have an other version from this.

Not the best cd I have heard...."

Chemistry - Prophecy"
,Moodsi,2007-04-25T17:18Z,this isn`t the original
,Moodsi,2007-04-25T17:19Z,"I know why.. this isn`t the orginal HDM.10 If you are looking at the length on eks. A1 Project- Lost then you can se its over 6 minutes long, but the original A1 Project - lost (gollum & yanni rmx) is just 2,55 minutes, so you should download the HDM Vol 10 on another torrent site there you can find the original=)=)"

,Seijiro,2007-04-26T07:17Z,"I don't know if this is the original Hard Dance Mania 10. As all the preview vols was made like one big song, compiled together with no breaks. But each song here ends in fade out then a whole different song starts. Downloading the vol. 10 on another site gave me another result, where it was compiled together.

I downloaded this once and I don't want to download it again to see if these songs match the ones' from the other site I downloaded. But I deff wouldn't download this. 

I have all DJ Pulsedrivers CDs and this is not his style. I will buy 10 too when I find it. So to all you Hard Dance Mania fans, don't download this, IMO it's fake."
