,420dopeman,2007-05-02T07:02Z,"mattmos, you are most correct.

I will post as small a fix as possible  very soon, then it's time for a much obvious needed BREAK thats two games and two fixes too many for me. 

Please try and leave the comments below this to  minumum so that those may see this fix. My apologies for not spotting this sooner.
The fix looks only around 4omb.

cheers as always. B

,chimpakawanzelu,2007-11-28T02:14Z,"Thank you soooooooo much, dopeman!!!!!!!!  F'in' cool game - and I'm only just at the third level or so, but I had to post this now.

Works great on Vista 32bit.  Unrared game and then unrared/installed guns updated before I started playing and everything works great.  That's my point.  Do those two operations before you start playing and everything will work great.  Any problems?? - just post them.  I keep my eyes on these pages to help out other Vista folks.

Cheers!!
