,Hirkef,2007-10-14T15:39Z," does anyone know how to fix the ""error loading saved game"" thing? like when you are leaving the school to fight the bandits it just says error loading the saved game and quits the game for me. have tried to reinstall it but it still wont work. Can anyone help me plz?"
,DiabolicMinds,2007-11-23T22:26Z,"Got the fix put into the main Jade Empire folder ""JE"" and I still get no movies in game. Not sure what the problem is. 
Did it exactly like you said. 
Great game and awesome upload aside from this problem..."
,HungerIM,2007-11-28T16:44Z,"""Error loading saved game"":

This is NOT a problem with game, this is a problem with VISTA, and in this case it's easy to resolve...

I make two step (don't know which one is help me, so make both):
At start, bring Properties of installed folder ""Jade Empire""
Step 1: Uncheck ""Read only"".
Step 2: In ""Security"", give ""Full Control"" to Users of your system.

And - Voila!!!"
,IssacRx,2007-12-17T03:17Z,"Has anyone got the cutscenes to work?
It plays great, and thanks for that, but I want me some cutscenes!

I have the movie folder in my JE folder, as I was told to do.
So, what's up?"
,moebius-t,2007-12-19T12:34Z,IssacRx > All non-story cutscenes have been removed from this _ripped_ version of the game.
,par4dr00p,2008-01-05T15:58Z,"This Fix will not add cutscenes to the game. If you want to see the movies, you'll have to download a full Image release (about 6.4gb).

But you don't have to install the game again!

Simply extract all ""/data/movies*.rar"" files from the newly downloaded Image to your game folder. This should also fix the black screen problems."
,AIVARO,2008-01-05T18:42Z,Thanks.

,reafer,2008-06-28T12:29Z,a great job once again.every torrent i have download so far is by you so this is 4 now.its worked fine for me
,heavenzmovi3,2008-07-22T22:43Z,"dumb ass jals posting spoilers. seriously, how old are you fuckers? have a little consideration for others"
,Shauncakes,2008-08-12T19:36Z,"This is a fix for the black screen problem. If you wan't to get the movies then you will actually have to download another torrent. And it's 30KB because it's like tiny .bik files that are what the movies are formatted in. So the game thinks the movies are there, allthough they arent. Which is why it's small"
