,kauken,2008-01-28T22:01Z,"READ THIS FIRST BEFORE U DOWNLOAD.

If you are a cleaner, parking attender, live of wellfare, alcoholic, druggie, a hillbilly ( or from Hisingen/Bromma in sweden) , gayhater, rasist, pedophile or close AND you spend your days looking at other peopels faults ( classic projection) in order to avoid seeing and feeling your own misery....

... AND you enjoy it and have no intention to change your life: 
THEN DO ABSOLUTELY NOT DOWNLOAD THIS - it may cause strong reactions to you and you might see how you COULD live - this of course may have you to post stupid comments here and farting through your mouth as some people already have.


IF THIS IS NOT YOU .... then ""the secret"" is nothing new- it is a way of living. However in this movie it is presented in a maybe more appealing way to the modern western person. What may have scared the, as mentioned above, lonely and scared people from the outskirts of Sweden who listen to rasistrock and drink beer on tuesdays watching the exciting game of ""Handboll"" - is the unfortunate hollywood way of presenting it where they focus on wealth, money and building expectations through music etc.... 

But however, I downloaded this( with many other resources like this) 1 year ago and my life has become just the opposite. You see I was like the swedish scared people before - and I came from a background where my father constantly complained and projected his own fear onto others. I was lonely, scared, angry, and had accomplished nothing ( else than jerking off twice each day ).

I was 25 when I decided to change this and these resources helped me alot. Today I am 26 and I am always happy, positive ( might not look like it here he he ;) smiling. All my friends returned after they saw that I wasnt complaining anymore, I got hundreds of new friends. I fuck at least 2 new women each week and trust me they are hotties from the age 20 to 45. 
I have now sold my first succesfull comany for 1,2 million swedsih kronor ( not much, but it keeps me going). 

LOOK, its all up to YOu and how YOU WANT to view it. Of course its easier to not beleive in this, but waht are you then doing here and downloading it?? Just keep on with your live - but if your not satisfied - then do something about it and The Secret is a great way to start.

Thank you for reading this far - it means that you are serious.

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.

You can also improve your life style, through those techniques, but as we all know money will not make you happier.

,Fusse,2009-02-09T08:24Z,"I'm currently studying a B.Sc. Psychology degree at one of Europe's top 10 universities (obviously British, obviously Russell Group, which means cutting edge research)

Psychology is a hard subject to study, because there are a vast abundance of views on how our mind works. Everyone seems to have their personal account for why people kill, why people help strangers, or even why some people get rich and famous. However, we must bear in mind that in order to make a knowledge claim we must be able to provide support for it. For example, I could easily say that people that are rich and famous carry a certain gene, which is activated by a specific environment, the purpose of which is to ensure survival of the species by providing proper leadership. Supporting such a notion is, however, a lot harder.

As far as I am concerned, there is no support at all for the idea presented in this video. Sure, positive thinking might enhance your life. But this whole concept of 'a sixth sense', transmitting thoughts and a collective mind? Until the people behind this theory provides some serious support, which isn't really hard to do if it's true, I maintain that this is utter crap. And yes, I did watch the video. And yes, 'The Matrix' was infinitely more convincing."
,Fusse,2009-02-09T09:01Z,"Furthermore, there are two people in the video posing as psychologists. I took the liberty of checking their credentials. Wikipedia
may not be the most reliable source available, but it usually points in the right direction.

Denis Waitley - ""In 2007, Denis Waitley resigned from his post as a member of the board of directors of Usana, after it was discovered that he did not have a Master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. In addition to this USANA informed the Wall Street Journal that they were unable to verify Waitley's Ph.D. from the unaccredited La Jolla University.""

John Gray - ""After high school he attended University of St. Thomas (a liberal arts college) and the University of Texas, but did not receive degrees from these institutions. [...] He received diplomas called BA and MA in ""Creative Intelligence"" from the Maharishi European Research University in Iowa. John Gray received his PhD from unaccredited Columbia Pacific University after completing a correspondence course in 1982."""

As far as the quality of the video and torrent goes, 10/10

But the secret is just more new age crap. Don't buy into this stuff. They attempt to use science to back the case up and fail completely.

It is clear they do not understand quantum physics and they way the universe works. Most of the statements they make are either general assertions or straw-man arguments

If you think of something/pray for something, sometimes it will work by chance. If it doesn't work they will say it just hasn't happened YET or you didn't pray/try hard enough.

From the movie:
""We don't even know how electricity works""...

,eondick,2010-02-24T22:27Z,"@people wishing to tout their emotions of why this movie makes their pride hurt (take it easy it's a joke)-

This movie is not about anything new. It is howevery contemporary.

It may be challenging to your world view.

  -note: if you immediately challenged the last statement it is my pleasure to be the first to inform you or at least remind you of the little voice in your head.

Let's start with the basics.

Placebo effect: proven observable effect, measured, in fact. If you contest this, stop reading now and do some research.

  -What you think and how they integrate with your emotions has a direct relationship to the neurochemicals produced in your brain. These chemicals are responsible for many things, including but not limited to subsequent thoughts and emotions, and regulating all of the functions the human body is capable of (Which happens to be a lot, ask a doctor).

Fact. There is still plenty that the top universities and wikipedia etc. does not know about the brain.

Cool. So far so good.

Here's another fact, we can measure some of the brainwaves our brain produces. This is a frequency thing. Just like sound, light, or any other physical thing in the universe.

So do brainwaves work anything like sound? When you play a 2 notes on the piano, they produce not only the frequencies of their individual notes, but an infinite array of super and subfrequencies that all interact with eachother backwards and forwards. The human ear can not hear all of these, and they may get quieter and drowned out but never the less it is an excellent example.

Fact: Experiments with EEG machines have shown to have an effect on the human brain by effecting the brainwaves via producing fields that exhibit an interaction similar to that of the sound example.

Here is the theory- and by theory this is a product of my observations and conclusions that I am going to call a theory- Person A has a thought, and Person B has a thought, and in the collective mass of frequencies that we broadcast and receive with our brain, somewhere along the line a harmonic frequency represents a joining of the two and many other subfrequencial signals to an infinite number of other subconsiously participators by means however convoluted appearing has the effect of bringing 'results'.

That there is the most basic scientific example I can give. It's not too far fetched, It's not necessarily true, but you would find many among those devoted to the pursuit of knowledge of the human mind that would give it a chance, or at least have no conflicting evidence of the contrary.

With that I leave you to the continued exploration of human mind, may it rock your socks and bring joy to you whatever roads it takes you down.

To those that are right there with me in intent I implore you to check out Burning Man if you have not yet. It's a trip worth taking no matter how old or young you are.

,TopherHunt,2010-02-26T01:11Z,"eondick.... D. M. Tea... nice.... I have never had the chance to partake.

As long as it doesn't develop some kind of preachy almost religious following."
,eondick,2010-02-28T02:06Z,"@topher- Referring to your curiosity of the business man's trip, it really depends- flying through complex unfolding levels of superconsciousness could leave someone feeling anxious, but the trip is a much more coherent one than sage so it really depends on the person. In my quote however, I was referring to the constant drip of dream that is the part of waking consciousness, sipping- vs above as being completely submerged. It's fun to swim.

And as far as the preachy side of it, the majority of these guys are genuinely ecstatic. The lady seemed a bit of a goofball to me and an odd choice to put in the film, but I don't have the same view as this movie's decent chunk of target audience (those already absorbed in the new age movement) and perhaps, the movie gave them a new perspective to work within that is more in line with what they actually wanted from jumping onto the new age movement initially.

As far as quantum physics goes, we are going to keep breaking down particles and for all we know, new smaller particles will emerge from our measurements until someone figures out a way to tie what we see and know of the physical world to a fundamental blueprint of the underpinning geometry of the universe (including time). There are already those who claim they know the fundamental building blocks. The two I know of make pretty big claims, but have poor websites and do not go into enough detail in my opinion, although the work they have done is remarkable. The main reason I mention this is because this guy built and tested a magnet field generator based off his math that has never been demonstrated in modern science. Marko Rodin is one who has worked for a very long time in this field, and his concepts and math are very interesting (he's got a 4.5 hour video where he teaches the subject). Another site that I have not personally studied but at a glimpse may be relative is the ""coral castle code"". It has structural similarities and both may just be different expressions of a common thread. But hey, delve into the deep end if you must!"

I pity you. I pity you because you refuse to step outside the tiny confines of your very limited and ignorant mindset. If you feel that this is such a load of crap, then take a look at some other things in your life, and you WILL find that they are not so different. 
1. Christianity. now before i begin, i would like to apologize sincerely to anyone i might offend. What is christianity if not just another way of phrasing all the things in this movie. ""tell yourself that good things will happen, believe it and they will come true."" against ""pray that good things will come true and believe it and it will happen"" i understand people will argue this with the existence of a higher being, which i am neither affirming or negating, i am simply pointing out the hypocrisy in the views of some.  neither the existence of a higher being or the existence of universal forces of energy can be proven, therefore, theoretically, either could exist. and whos to say that they aren't basically the same thing, just phrased different ways? think on it. And i challenge everyone who doesnt take this movie seriously, try it. try it for a week, or a month, or a year i dont care. just try it! and if it works, then im very happy for you and your new positive view on the world. and if not then youve still gained the experience and can say that you have seen both sides.

Just some background here, i am at college in england doing a levels in Physics, Maths, Geography and ICT.
I have just watched this video through its entirity.
It seems that the overall message being portrayed by this video is just common sense.
If you are positive about your life and believe that you will succeed, you are much more likely to than a person who thinks they are a failure. Isn't that just damn right obvious? correct me if im wrong but i dont think that 'the secret' is really much of a secret at all, it just brings to our attention what we want to believe is true. 
If you say that you want a relationship, and you believe that you have the ability to find a girlfreind and have confidence in yourself and your personality, you are much more likely to find one than someone who wants a girlfreind but doesn't believe they can get one because they aren't 'good enough' or 'why would she want to go out with me if she can go out with someone who is better looking?' you just gotta get out there and do it and believe that you can!
Now ive kinda written this to you guys but ive also written this to myself, as writing or saying what i think helps me to make sense of what i think. Ive never had a proper relationship, but i want one, so ive decided that im going to put myself out there more.

There is nothing wrong with that at all. Some things def. need academic approach to be explained. As you say, psychology may be one of the hardest things to explain, because we have no idea of how powerful our mind really is. Which means, you either set a limitation to: I cannot do these things, or you decide and believe that you sure can do! You`ve probably heard about people that have experienced accidents where someones child or a close friend gets trapped beneath a car or a boulder. And for a few seconds these people get superhuman strenght where they actually lift something they normally cannot lift! Even when asked if they could repeat that, they are unable to.

Law of Attraction is nothing more than pure persistance and belief that you can achieve whatever you focus on! Where attention goes, energy flows. 

I myself have not been ill/sick/flu or whatever since I was 11 years old. I am 28 now. In my mind I tell my self I cannot get sick, and I believe in it. 

Some things you just cannot explain, not even with the latest science or technology. We didn`t create ourselves, something else did. Which means we are the product of this universe. The laws that are governing this universe apply as much to us as everything else. We are not above it, and we probably never will be. "

,efeffess,2011-08-23T22:49Z,"After having some experience with Shamanism (a combo of traditional and new age), I can state from experience it is quite possible to affect your environment using solely your mind. I had learned how to set up objects or areas with specific fields that others could easily detect (blocking malevolence or issuing an emotional energy). I knew a guy who could form energy from his hands, pouring it into mind like a strange liquid, with mass and everything; another one could turn himself ""invisible"" by bending his perception of reality around himself.

At the time, the strongest drug I ever did was tobacco. So, I trust you will rest, assured that I ain't talking out of my posterior orifice here.

I have been seeking deeper truths of the nature of reality since, which has brought me to Buddhism (currently studying the 10 Tibetan Breaths and the 5 Tibetan Rites). It's a good thing I have a couple of decades of computing and Web search experience, or I'd have a hell of a time finding this information. It's very much hidden.

Many videos that claim to produce results are, indeed, Western or ""whiteified"" rehashes of valuable spiritual philosophies that induce nothing more than a temporary state of peace and calm. They teach nothing about how to actually live.

You can have a degree in anything, but without practical application of the knowledge, you haven't verified shit yet. Try this out with an open (or even gullible) mind for at least a month. Conduct a reality check every so often to gauge your progress.

I'm looking forward to this video as a seeker of truth. It's up to one to make up his and/or/nor her own mind. At best, all of our comments are best viewed as an insight into how humans deal with information.

It has now finished downloading. Many sincerest thanks to the seeders. Let's see what the universe has to say about all this, now."

If Rockefeller can enslave the human race, so can everyone else! [grin]"

,anthraxtheterrrible,2012-08-04T06:40Z,"I want mankind to forget dogma, monetary gain, racial differences and ego - I can visualize this, I can feel it, I can hear it and even smell and taste it.
I want us to evolve and become symbiotic rather than cancerous.

Stop feeding the media energy through your attention."
