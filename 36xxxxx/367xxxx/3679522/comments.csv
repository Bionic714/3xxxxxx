,Kallzing,2007-05-12T10:51Z,"Morseman21, That is -very- true indeed, But where I live, I will have to buy the CD over the net to get it; / And i'd rather have their music spread to my friends like this, than not having it spread at all. 
The world Deserves to hear Megadeth!"
,BlisteringDDj,2007-05-14T21:17Z,"Iwill not download this album ever!!! I'm gonna buy it :-D

Just wanted to check if it was out here :-P

I'm really looking forward to tomorrow! 
BTW, if you want to rip top quality, use EAC(Exact Audio Copy) :P"

,slahser,2007-06-01T08:14Z,"Well i am a poor student, and i think megadeth already have enough money as it is. The poor gives to the rich? Nah."
,JPQsat,2007-06-01T23:06Z,"I agreed with you, go buy this CD. I, too buy every cd or singles that i listen to more than 2 or 3 times in the week that i download them for free. 

I no it's not ''legal'' to download here first, but i
've spent a lot of money on cd that were crap before and it's more like an insurance that i get what i pay for. I spent about 40$ a week on itune and buy at least 2 real cd a week, so if the music industry whant to call me a pirate for been here...... shame on them."
,divisiblebyzero,2007-06-02T04:18Z,"For the record, I bough the album on iTunes, but that hard drive died before I had time to back it up.  Great album and they definitely deserve the money, but I'm not buying it twice!"
,EbnoC,2007-06-03T15:34Z,Like BlisteringDDj I did buy this album :D it's so rocking! Just checking it here :D
