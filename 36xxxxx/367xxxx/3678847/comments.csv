,kulpims,2007-08-01T15:56Z,I'm surprised to see this vid has only been downloaded 54 times(?) cause I think Bill Moyers is one of the few journalists with balls big enough to cover the controvertial issues and official stories most of the big media simply ignores or never investigates deep enough to see them for the utter BS that they are - point being: I'll seed this for a while if anyone wants to be enlightened ;-)
,Eilonwy05,2007-08-23T00:32Z,"Wow... just -- wow.  I would ask why there are so few people who care about this great documentary, but I think the answer is pretty simple:  They're all marching to the beat of the war drums being hammered on by the media and administration Moyer so expertly exposes in this very documentary.

Such a shame..."
