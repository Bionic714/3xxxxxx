,DrChandra,2007-04-29T20:45Z,"Reg, not sure. try 'mediaplayerclassic' and ffdshow in a recent version"
,mmm_2000,2007-05-01T06:31Z,"do a google search on matroska codec or mkv files and you will find links on where to get the codec.
The quality is amazing on these 720p files !

But u also need a 3.0 Ghz + computer in order to play the files !
Enjoy

p.s.: almost done uploading the torrent !"
,MrMansson,2007-05-02T18:36Z,"Use VLC for MKV and all other files.

It's a very popular end flexible media player that comes with codecs allready installed.
