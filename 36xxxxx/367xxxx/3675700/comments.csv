,R_I_P_61,2007-05-14T21:14Z,"Don't listen to AndreasViking, it's just one of those noob f**ktards at a MPAA/ATAA/RTAA or something like that.

He spammed every torrent with Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 with the exact same message (duh, didn't you think we'd see though you?)..."

Please help!"
,krajblo,2009-03-16T09:06Z,Just copy the given crack into the folder adobe dreamweaver cs3 and start it.
,Pappegye,2009-04-19T21:40Z,"k, does this one work? no trojans or some shit like that??

Really want this program, need it fast..."
,zombiekangaroo,2009-05-19T06:36Z,"alright, i downloaded it and wow did it download quick (at some points i hit 700 kbps)  i ran the setup and im having the same problem as everybody else, it says failed shared components and failed dreamweaver, so i ran the setup again and chose ""reinstall"" and when i did it the second time i noticed a ""setup.exe"" appeared in  C/Programfiles/adobe folder, i ran that nothing happened, i cut it and put it in the dreamweaver crack folder i just downloaded from this torrent and ran it, and it looked like it was going to run, a .gz file appeared, and then it just stopped,  ive never seen a mkdev torrent fail yet so im not thinking that this is a bad torrent, i would just like to know how to install it"
,2distorted,2009-05-29T13:56Z,"This is the only valid, working, virus free and shit free torrent available on entire internet related to dreamweaver cs3. Alllllllll the rest of torrents are bogus or fully packed with virus.

All you have to do install it and copy the Dreamweaver.exe file from the crack folder and put it into the real location of installed dreamweaver and over write the original file  with the copied crack file. AND thats it good to go."
,LinkYeah,2009-06-04T15:54Z,"Damn, 700kbs! No Bull"
,boltning,2009-08-14T22:49Z,"Works like a treat.

For those looking for the crack. 

Its in the second crack folder, but still zipped up. Once unzipped, rename dreamweaver 2.exe to dreamweaver.exe  Drop it in your dreamweaver program file folder and replace the original.

Those looking for a keygen. Forget it - you don't need one. If your still having trouble getting the program to work, go back to playing with your lego.

,RefreshClothing,2009-12-10T01:07Z,"Hi, I have been experiencing some problems. I am pretty sure it's my computer, since I couldn't download Adobe flash. Every time i start the setup menu, it would say it wouldn't start because internet explorer is open. I checked and it isn't open. I also went on the task manager and tried to end processes and it still hasn't worked. I have downloaded in the past and didn't experience any problems. Please Help."

,ivansama,2010-01-04T18:54Z,CS3 is way better than CS4 in my opinion as it still has the image viewer application without it you can't make a simple slideshow 
,ivansama,2010-01-04T19:17Z,Sorry for double posting but it doesn't work
,tuxfx,2010-01-06T04:45Z,CS3 > CS4
