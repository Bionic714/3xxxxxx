Cant wait to play James Pond 2 again :)
Do you know of an Emu for Pc, for cd32 games?"
,Gres,2007-04-25T19:25Z,i think WinUAE is able to emulate a CD32. Havn't tried it though.
[M],Q91,2007-04-25T19:46Z,Pretty sure Cloanta comes with a bios for CD32 aswell
[M],Q91,2007-04-25T20:02Z,"it's on the Amiga Forever ISO that I bought, so I can play >:)

anyways, i will help seeding this"
,Gres,2007-04-25T21:16Z,I don't have my computer on when i sleep. But i'll seed until i go to bed and then continue seeding tomorrow.
[M],Q91,2007-04-26T14:41Z,Cannon Fooder needs some kind of key
,Gres,2007-04-26T15:44Z,@Q91: hmm no it doesn't. I just ran it in WinUAE (with the CD32 kickrom). Only tried two missions but it worked fine.
[M],Q91,2007-04-27T14:01Z,"I also used WinUAE, but after the Amiga CD 32 logo, i get a screen with a key that goes into a thing that has a red and green button"
[M],Q91,2007-04-27T14:02Z,"and I think i need a special configuration for James Pond 2, when it comes to the ""movie"" (i think), even tho the framerate states 50Hz, the movie moves less than 1 frame per 5th second"
[M],Q91,2007-04-27T17:22Z,"funny, Cannon Fodder Works :P"
,Clint.e,2007-09-25T15:49Z,Please re-seed :(
,deicide1979,2008-07-31T20:36Z,Seed plz...
,deicide1979,2008-08-01T13:16Z,come on' seed... plz
,Gres,2010-05-18T18:40Z,"you're right, James Pond 2 doesn't seems to be working. the screen that shows up is for write protecting save games thougn and not a manual protection or something like that."
,Gres,2010-05-18T18:48Z,"Just noticed that James Pond 2 does work, you cannot run CD32 games from images directly but you have to mount them with Daemon Tools first."
