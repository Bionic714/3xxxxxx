can somebody please uppload this whit swesub"
,sunshine.nightmare,2008-12-01T00:41Z,"I can confirm that this DVD works fine.  Just burn the ISO image directly to DVD.  

Unfortunately, it's not ""The Three Amigos"" with Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short.  This is three stand-up comics I've never heard of in concert.  Some more detailed item description would have been great so that I could have avoided wasting my time and bandwidth on this."
