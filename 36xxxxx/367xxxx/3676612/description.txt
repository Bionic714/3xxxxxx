| Release note |
----------------
A two-disc DVD set titled The History of Beavis and Butt-head was scheduled for release in September 2002 containing the program content of four of the UK-exclusive VHS tapes. However, its release was canceled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owns approval rights for video releases of the series. Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled.

The set started selling on eBay at very high prices, sometimes over $300 US.  So share it, otherwise it will be lost again.
