,reelfiles,2007-04-30T03:38Z,"There is no such release as ""Beavis and Butt-Head - too hard to handle""  This is ""The History of Beavis and Butt-Head"" just as it's labeled. 
 If you have info on the rlease you're looking for let me know, and I'll try to get a hold of it."

,dalis llama,2007-06-02T04:56Z,"Thank you reelfiles!

do you have any rips of B & B with the music videos still in?

that was the biggest disappointment, buying the collections, only to find that the best parts were removed (prolly related to copyrights).

I'll be sure to seed this one!"
