John MacLaverty - The Curse of the Omen (2005)

Because of the release of the remake of the classic 1976 horror film, on the 6th June 2006 (06.06.06), and a 30th anniversary of the old one, they showed this documentary. It was basically explaining many terrifying coincidences during the making of and release of The Omen. For example, the scene where Damien and his Mom are attacked by monkeys in the car, the zoo keeper that looked after the monkeys was killed. Also, a stuntman who doubled for Lee Remick suffered a terrible fate when he felt a push jumping off a building and missing a large inflatable bag, and no-one pushed him! But the creepiest coincidence of all was the guy who designed David Warner's beheading scene, he and his wife has a crash. His wife was torn apart by glass, and he escaped only with injuries, and the scary part was that there was a sign showing the town Ommen being 66,6 miles away! Spooky. With contributions by people who worked on it, such as director Richard Donner, and narrated by Jack Fortune. Good!

NOTE: I waited literally half a year for this download to completely finish. But to of no avail as I got stuck at a tantalizing 98.5%. Due to this there are three minor glitches in the film, at 10, 30 and 40 minutes of playing time. You need to manually skip through these tiny sections once the playback starts to jam. ~grinreaper AKA ephilution
