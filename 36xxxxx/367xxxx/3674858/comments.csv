,avizz,2008-09-16T22:40Z,"I have tried this and everything installs okay, but when i try to save a file in .ai format i get the msg...an unkwon error occtured. 
I have also tried another installation using tel. registration and installed fine but the same problem.
I saw in one comment about getting missing dlls but when i went to the url about 75% of the zip downloaded but did not finish and now the url no longer seems to exest.

Anyone have any suggestions?"
