yes when you complete a download is when you become a seeder and actually begin to give back what you have leeched. 
so yes, just leave in your 
BT client as long as you can mate. Every little bit helps everyone else.

To everyone else, you are most welcome for the game(s)
Happy you like guys."

Winrar doesnt work for dopemans rips, you must use 7zip..another archiver as in fact isnt even close to winrar bcz winrar cannot handle 7z files..i was THIS close to just erase the crap bcz i thought it was damaged due to download lag or somethin..

NOt to call you a moron, or a genious, spending good jerking off time writing about your games, yourself, everything about the skies above..BUT NOT that you must use 7z archiver to unrar the files..so please...add this..""Note: must use 7zip archiver to access files""

,anderwold1,2011-11-30T03:57Z,Old games rock. Why can't modern games be this good?
,urieaal,2011-12-12T09:44Z,"old games are better, simply because the majority of developers are catering to the QQ's from the xbox live crowd. In other words they focus on graphics and very little on story and game play."
