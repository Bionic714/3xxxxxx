Led Zeppelin Remasters is a 2-CD (or 2-cassette or 3-LP) compilation album of remastered material by English rock group Led Zeppelin. It was initially released in the U.K. and Japan by Atlantic Records on October 15, 1990. The 1992 U.S. release includes a bonus CD featuring promotional interviews with Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones. The album is essentially a scaled-down version of the 4-CD Led Zeppelin boxed set.

Rising from the ashes of his old band the Yardbirds, session guitarist Jimmy Page formed Led Zeppelin, one of the most powerful, influential, and enduring British bands to emerge in the '60s. Despite the presence of such classic thrash-o-ramas as "Good Times Bad Times" and "Communication Breakdown," what set Led Zeppelin apart was the depth and range of their music. Their sound was bathed in the blues, from rootsy covers of Willie Dixon's "You Shook Me" and "I Can't Quit You Baby," to the crunching rhythm changes of "Dazed And Confused."

Few guitarists before or since possessed Page's sense of pacing and dynamics, as exemplified by the traditional acoustic folk elements framing the arena gestures on "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You," and the raga-flavored acoustic mystery of "Black Mountain Side." These elements would continue to evolve on subsequent albums, leading to some of Led Zeppelin's greatest moments.
