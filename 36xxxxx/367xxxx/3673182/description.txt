This is an indenpendent movie that was made in Sweden during late 2006 and early 2007.
Spoken language is English (warning for swedish accents)
The only cost to make this movie was all the junk food we bought while recording it :)

There currently aren't any subtitles as we didn't know how to implement it.
Any help would be deeply appreciated.

Any feedback can be posted in comments below :)


PS. Something got screwed up with chapter selection during production of the dvd.
There is one chapter selection page which just looks screwed. Just skip to the next page please.
