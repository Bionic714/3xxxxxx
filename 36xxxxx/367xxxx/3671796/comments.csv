,glandula,2007-04-24T13:53Z,either you're an idiot for spreading viruses OR stupid for being inconsiderate enough to not think about the fact that there might be people NOT using windows that might be interested in these downloads
,defoi,2007-04-24T22:24Z,Don't use EXE-files!! It's only useful for Windows and could seriously be infected by viruses!! 
,residentweasel,2007-12-28T07:57Z,seed plz

Had it ever occurred to you that they are trying the best that they can, I downloaded things from USsoldier and they are clean without a virus. If you don't have windows, then kindly offer USsoldier instructions on how to change it so that it is not an EXE file. Be kind.....we are all working together to help one another so stop being so self-righteous. The only time we should be alarmed is when there is an actual virus. Then report it."
