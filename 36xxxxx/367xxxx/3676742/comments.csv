But I noticed the times where there was no downloading at all, so I decided to get an alternative bunch.  This was the only one I saw with seeders.  only 1-19, but I figured I could get the other 5 from someone else.  

Episode 8 does not work.  I tried Win Media player 11 and VLC player 0.8.5.  All other episodes appear to be playing ok.  Thank you so much for this.  I will seed until ratio exceeds 1.0  "
