Soundtrack to the 1983 cult classic comedy movie starring Bob and Doug McKenzie (Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis). It was a spinoff from their recurring characters on SCTV. It also roughly parallels the plot of Hamlet, by Shakespeare. This soundtrack includes some dialog and music from the movie, and a few things that are not in the movie. The music is surprisingly good in places.

QUALITY
I did not rip these -- I downloaded them off an obscure and hard-to-find fan page. They seem to be 128 kbps CBR MP3s. Encoder unknown. Quality OK. MP3 tags complete.
