,sviskon,2007-04-29T13:05Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

The game freezes after about 20-30 minutes of play, you need to reboot then

Displaybugs in form of cars changing colors all the time, really annoying

Other displaybugs with black squares all over the screen

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"

when running  race_steam  an error occured i.e
""please submit file""minidump\race_steam1.1.0.....dmp""""


please help any idea"
,mshl8188,2010-05-21T19:21Z,"Hello Dopeman, Thanks for uploading this game. I think I have the same problem like ""virusbox"".  Please dont tell me to install direct x 9. coz the pc has direct x 10 or 11 I guess. This game is for my younger bro, his pc config has many other gmaes, but I found the same problem when I downloaded the same game from another uploader called "" detonation"". Please help. Once again to be clear, the error message I get is something that asks for Minidump file and some file name and number. I dont know whether it is a crack file that needs to be pasted somewhere else or what. But, I downloaded your version coz it only sid unrar and play. Simple as a pimple. Somehow its got a bit complicated like acne. Please help."
