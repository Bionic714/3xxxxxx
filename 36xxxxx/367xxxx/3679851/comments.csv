,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-05-21T11:06Z,"there are only 8 episodes to Season 4, genius. #9 is the christmas special.. great upload."
,alienjesus,2008-07-25T03:36Z,"These are not ""great quality"".  These are the same fucking digital distraction rips with the shitty audio that seem to be in every other god damn TPB torrent."
,DrDemento,2008-09-28T11:04Z,"Well alienjesus instead of complaining why don't you rent the DVD's and rip them yourself?

I love the show and the convenience so the quality is good enough."
,sunshinestate,2008-11-18T06:14Z,these are very low quality tv rips. i feel like i'm watching a blown up youtube video. the first 3 seasons were low quality but they weren't as bad as this. 
,oggologgo,2008-12-08T13:15Z,"What kind of retarded idiot ripped these.

And don't tell me to go buy them and rip them myself.

Fucking learn to rip properly. You have to be retarded to rip something, then watch it and see that it's this crappy quality, and then still release it.

Fucking redo it."
,oggologgo,2008-12-08T15:29Z,Looks like fucking youtube videos. Worthless
,diarrhea_jones,2010-05-04T08:53Z,"Can't play these on PS3.

Thanks for absolutely nothing. "
,Daruna,2010-07-29T01:52Z,"You are all pretty fucking ungrateful for a bunch of poor fucks who can't afford a single season of this great show. God damn, this is why I go to private sites, at least they aren't as fuckwit retarded as the general public.

Thanks for the upload."
