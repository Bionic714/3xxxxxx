Deadliest Art: Best Of The Martial Arts Films (1990)

HKFlix Says:  	4.5 Stars

While slightly dated, this documentary has an amazing selection of clips of Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung, and more. By far the best and most fun compilation of martial arts clips we've come across. Perfect for parties!

Plot:	A superb selection of clips from some great martial arts films of the '70s and '80s. Includes footage from out-of-print films, and some great alternate takes that are hard (if not impossible) to find elsewhere.

Overview:	A superb selection of clips from some great martial arts films of the '70s and '80s. Includes footage from out-of-print films, and some great alternate takes that are hard (if not impossible) to find elsewhere. Each series of clips is set up by host John Saxon (A Nightmare On Elm Street), and is informative and fun. You'll also see rare interviews and behind the scenes footage with your faves: Jackie, Sammo, Cynthia, and others, which (as far as we know) are unavailable anywhere else.
