[T],Perlite,2009-03-22T12:24Z,"I would like to say a few words about this crap. If you are thinking about using this script - use the latest nulled version. There is NO reason why you should pay to use this script, and if you are worried about not having customer support availabile, do not worry. You wouldn't get much of it even if you payed. The guys at TemplateShares are charging $75 bucks for this script + $35 for support, which is just wrong. Also, when a new version is released, you will have to pay another $35 for the update. I absolutely love that this script has been nulled and uploaded via BitTorrent, because the guys over at TemplateShares deserve nothing!

1, The design is absolutely terrible and very difficult to modify, as the code is very badly organized. There are many ""skins"" available for this script, but they all look just as bad as the default style. 

2, Even though this is not an open tracker script, passkeys are retarded and goes agains everything that filesharing stands for. It is, however, possible to switch off this option, though it is set to ON by default.

3, The tracker struggles to get peers from external sources, and very often will not be able to even on scrape-enabeled trackers. The creator of this script has no idea why this is happening, and will try his best not to admit to it by simply ignoring the issue. How do I know this? I asked him myself.

All in all, this is a bad way to go if you're looking to make a nice looking and functional torrent site. Using this script on our site was a bad experience. I decided to rebuild the the site from scratch. As of January 2009, we're 100% Xamware free! If you want to run your own tracker, use WhitSoft's OpenTracker. This is the same tracker that TPB and many other sites use. Information on how to Bdecode/Bencode is not too difficult to find. Try googling it. If you are in need of a Content Management System to build around your tracker, I recommend Memberkit.
