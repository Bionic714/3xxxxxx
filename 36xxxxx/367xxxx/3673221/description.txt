Robert Greenwald's Brave New Foundation (the foundation connected to his Brave New Films, producers of Iraq for Sale, Uncovered, OutFoxed and many other progressive films) has constructed an online video memorial for the US troops who have died in Iraq (iraqmemorial.org).
As we think about the four year anniversary of the start of the Iraq war, it's important to reflect on the human cost of this war, and the ongoing cost if we refuse to end it soon. Please take a few moments to watch some of the videos.
Then thank a friend or family member who has served or is serving or has family serving. And then write a letter to your democratic representative (congressperson, senator, president, ...). Support the troops. Bring them home.
