Arggg Thanx Mehearty!!!!!"
,allen_x,2007-04-23T23:46Z,"the craft bounces quite alot on the runway, hope that's normal."
,neslesman,2007-04-24T02:47Z,"I suppose losing your virginity in a P-38 would be as good as anyplace.  But that damned yoke sure would get in the way, whose idea was that for the sim?
Lets stick something in front of and in the middle of the cockpit so that simmers will have to go nuts trying to get at the functions or seeing outside.
Yep, great idea goober, lets do it."
,Boogie73,2007-04-24T05:06Z,"im not really sure about the bouncing issue as i dont have that problem with the FS9 or FSX versions. Only time it bouces on me is at a few runways that i use in Australia that are bunpy with all my planes. As for the yoke, i would try moving the eye point around. I also dont have this problem since i use a Track Ir so the eye point is high and allows me to see most of the switches and gauges with no problems,"
,Boogie73,2007-04-24T15:37Z,lol...thanks

,Boogie73,2007-06-14T21:15Z,how did this end up on page 4??
,papa12213,2008-05-17T21:37Z,I liked the models better in this 1 but i prefer the skyinlimted p38 as its feels more manouverable and the textures are better and there later modles such as the F-5E photo recon plane and the K model with better engines. This 1 isn't that good at handling unlike the real steel! worth it for glacier girl so thanks for the upload!!
,Boogie73,2008-06-06T22:38Z,"Papa, the P-38 was never built as a turn and burn A/C. The P-38 is BOOM&ZOOM. It could always out-dive and then out-climb it's enemies which is what made it so successful. You get into a turning fight at low altitude with a single engine A/C such as a Zero and you are DONE!! The 38 is not an aircraft to be trying to barrel rools in at under 1000ft. It just doesn't roll that well. Thanks for the comments though!!!!
