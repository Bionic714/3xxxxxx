,scott112687,2007-08-29T06:18Z,"dopeman, please help o wise one. my bia.exe just doesnt work. i double click and i get the hourglass for a few seconds, then nothing happens. i am using windows vista, could this be a prob? any help would be appreciated."
,Geezguy,2007-10-26T21:57Z,"The game works with Vista, so that's not the problem. I think it's the exe file that's corrupted or something."
,m2rt,2007-12-13T23:55Z,"having the same problem as scott112687 is having.. the bia file just stays on the backrgound and does nothing... it just is on the process manager...

Oh and btw I am using Vista too ;) ;)
So Dopeman do you have a patch for it`????"
,iampower,2008-01-26T07:09Z,"It doesn't start because it uses Starfuck (Starforce) protection, and it's incompatible with Vista (P.S- theres no need to bash me for using Vista, I regret it already !)"
,gamer612,2008-01-31T19:57Z,"I am using Vista 32-bit and was having the same problem where bia.exe would only run in the background and nothing would happen.

Get the nocd crack for version 1.0 from gamecopyworld and the game runs perfectly now."

,maddog4u31757,2008-06-13T00:10Z,"To those who click the startup and nothing happens, this usually happens when your videocard is not supported by the game. I know because I had the same problem when I bough BIA EIB. Check and make sure your comp can handle it =)"
,Danne9200,2008-06-28T00:49Z,"If you search on google "" Can you run it"" you will come to a website where you can shoose a game, and the website will test if you caomputer can handle the game. Then you can see if you dont got enough good videocard or something like that....
