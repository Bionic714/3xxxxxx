I'm interested in knowing what I have to do in order to view movies with subtitles (but not in VLC).  Is there a way to use the subtitle files in Winblows Media Player 11, or other media player?  (I'm not particularly interested in using VLC, given that I would like to use a media player with the codec pack I've already installed in my XPSP2 OS.)  Please advise."
