Plot:

After the death of his younger brother, a troubled 19-year-old
street dancer from Los Angeles is able to bypass juvenile hall
by enrolling in the historically black, Truth University in Atlanta, Georgia.
But his efforts to get an education and woo the girl he likes are
sidelined when he is courted by the top two campus fraternities,
both of which want and need his fierce street-style dance moves to
win the highly coveted national step show competition.

Repack Notes:

QPEL removed, bad.ar my ass settings were perfect in gknot,
if you didn't read it the 1st time compressability was fine for 1cd,
it's funny how NEPTUNES DVD SCR wasnt nuked for having CBR audio <-- fkn joke...
Now i've included a audio track of the directors commentary, i dont know too
many SCR's with director commentary on it but w/e.


Group Notes:

Enjoy our 1st Rls!

Quote from the encoder:

"I tested it, compressability said 42%
which is damn near perfect 40-60 is ideal"
