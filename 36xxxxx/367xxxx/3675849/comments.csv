,jrhaieuy,2007-08-07T05:12Z,"Yes, it works. I've found the easiest way to get these to work is with BootDreams. It's a free program, google to find it. In the options you can associate cdi files with BootDreams, so all you have to do is click the cdi file and then click burn.
Good job getting all these games up here, Dreamcast is an amazing system."
