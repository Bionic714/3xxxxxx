,anarchivist,2007-04-26T04:52Z,If you aren't going to answer me then the least you could do is seed this thing so i can find out for myself.
,The Beckster,2007-04-26T05:01Z,"No, it's Syntax, not Sintax (in Deepspace 5).

I'm seeding and have downloaders, so if you can't download it, it's a problem from your end."

,Driv5r,2008-09-09T13:26Z,Best Album Ever! Great quality too...
,fenderbenderr45,2008-09-14T01:19Z,"i have been looking for these songs everywhere
thanks"
,The Beckster,2009-06-30T12:42Z,"I wish I could get a copy of the Japanese release but I haven't found it anywhere. I did find a guy who had the song Love Song (I Wonder Why) and an extended Club version but I'm still missing Sexograph and Woman.

This version was hard enough to get in Canada. Most major stores weren't carrying it. I found it through a small company that does imports and for relatively cheap too!

Can't wait for the new album! ETA, Late 2009!"
,Noddist,2009-09-24T15:09Z,"Thanks girl, you saved my life :)"
,The Beckster,2011-01-18T04:50Z,"Hi All,

Please see my newly added torrent for the rare Meccano Mind Japanese Edition bonus tracks to supplement this torrent. It also includes additional non-album remixes. You can easily find the file by clicking my name at the top!
