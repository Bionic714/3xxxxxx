,RCBEG,2007-06-24T16:07Z,"Thanks a lot for these compliation

What a nice cheese!"
,swollusss,2007-07-12T12:28Z,"Eh! ""Funky House!?!?!""

What a crock of commercial shit! Surely pop hits from a funky house perspective would be, for example, James Brown, Giorgio Moroder, Donna Summer, Arthur Baker, New Order, Human League not the cunting Backstreet Boys or Culture Beat!!! Culture Beat!!! Did Jesus die on the cross so we'd be forced to listen to cocking Culture Beat!

I'm not knocking you for sharing tunes you like but this is about as mistitled a torrent as you could possibly find. Unless there's one out there titled '1000 great Italian recipes' that contains nothing but pictures of circuit boards on fire...Idiot."
,softsofty,2007-07-22T00:15Z,"Correct, this is not a collection of pure funky housemusic. As described, this is a collection of all the mainstream hits over a period of 40 years, that includes a lot of funk from the 70's and 80's, and a lot of house from the 80's, 90's. The majority of the house music can be labeled ""Deep House"", especially housemusic from 1990 to 1995, but some techno can be found here as well."
,KylePIB,2007-07-24T07:10Z,This is awesome^^
