,Challenge6,2007-12-13T19:57Z,How can this be downloaded
,Oda Dorothea,2008-02-21T21:45Z,"By using a BitTorrent program. I suggest uTorrent, very simple to use.

Open this link to download uTorrent: http://download.utorrent.com/1.7.7/utorrent.exe

When you have downloaded it, you right click and copy the link address and paste it into the torrent download box. (Click the earth symbol beside the sheet of paper with a plus on it.)"

,eduparise,2008-10-26T16:24Z,"Thanks for that, any chance of someone uploading the full Norwegian course with 30 lessons?"

Could anyone advise whether this would be possible... and where from ?

Thanx."
,malmalmal,2009-01-17T22:38Z,"thats a total time waste !! go and learn some majority language like Chinese, jappanese , standerd arabic , german etc why would you learn that ??? its even better to learn some far African language and more useful"
,Rustnail,2009-05-28T04:35Z,"Hey everyone! I just uploaded the comprehensive Norwegian I. It can be found here:

,Sephyncloud,2009-07-22T08:02Z,Norway is the Home Of BLACK METAL! I MUST LEARN IT!
,GeoAm,2009-08-08T23:25Z,"To malmalmal: If you don't want this torrent, why click on it? You have no idea why any of us want to learn Norwegian. I'm never going to China, so why would I learn Chinese? Get a grip.

odoinn, thanks SO MUCH for uploading this! I've been looking for it for ages, didn't want to pay the 100 quid though haha!"
