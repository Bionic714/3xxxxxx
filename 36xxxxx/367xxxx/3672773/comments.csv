Linuxant is a company who took it upon themselves to go out of their way to get an NDA for these chips from the company, and develop a driver for linux where otherwise there would not be one, at all.

They hope to eventually work the cost of development into other areas so that it is not expensive, and it appears that Dell is paying them so that the new Dell Ubuntu laptops can use the driver.

The reason they cant just give it away, is the NDA required to write the driver. Their source is technically subject to Conexant copyright because it was not reverse engineered and thus they cannot release their own source and probably cannot even help anyone else write a driver, though we are free to reverse engineer the binaries they release like the bcm43xx people did."
