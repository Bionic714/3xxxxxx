I'm also looking for episode 4... have they changed their copy-protection method or something? What is making it so hard to find these new episodes all of a sudden?"

The internet wizard will guide you through the installation of Sam and Max - Reality 2.0.1.0
It like to update relevant system files, That i'm not shure about, if i like,
 i don't know if it's a internet game, i don't like that.
I don't like to Click Next to continue. i click Chancel.
I think i have to make a backup on my system, before i maybe try that."

HangLoose, this is a downloadable game that checks it's serial and updates online. Many games have been doing this for years, no need to be paranoid. Just block the program with your firewall, or disable your internet connection while you play - these games only take a few hours to finish anyway."
,postalfrek,2007-05-07T22:32Z,how do i do to get it to work????
,cooljammer00,2007-05-30T01:57Z,"i too cannot get it to work on Vista.  Which is a shame, as the first 3 worked with just moving a .prop file around."
