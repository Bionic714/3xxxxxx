,ottobus9880,2007-04-29T03:49Z,DRAG DROP AND PLAY. SIMPLICITY ITS THAT MUCH MORE SIMPLE LOL
,Snake_f,2007-04-29T14:51Z,"ehh okay :P first download, open with winrar type inn psp.stm-gaming.com as password and place it in your ISO folder in your memorystick ^^ just as simple as that **"
,elyk1212,2008-02-03T07:06Z,"What is up with all the password torrents, dude?  On most trackers that isn't allowed.  It's not a huge deal with me and all, but I have to look up the torrent to find the password sometimes.  Kinda annoying.  You could just write a script to unrar (w/ pass) and rar back up without a password, or if you are doing the 'raring', you could ditch the password option.

Just a suggestion.

Anyway, thanks for the game!"
