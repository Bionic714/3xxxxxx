,wsshadowspeak,2008-07-06T21:00Z,"SIntf16.dll & SIntf32.dll Trojan Vius attached
Win32:Trojan-gen
Why would you place that within your uploads?
If it is not your doing at least you should have notified us downloaders beforehand, and/or fixed it so its not an issue.
Now the game is useless unless i accept the loading of the virus, which starts a Vinundu worm services within the system.

Thank but nothanks Skyl3lazer"
,HamSammich,2008-08-31T02:50Z,its not a Trojan/Virus its a False Positive and has been confirmed as one by AVG but it'll still pop up as there 17 variants of the file general consensus is its part of Sony's sucur rom reportss of the file go back as far as 2004 from what I'v found to get around it if your picking it up add the path file to exceptions in your scaner
,Spaglia,2009-10-14T01:23Z,"Did this stuff today. Game seems perfect.
