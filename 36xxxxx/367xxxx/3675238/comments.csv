,handyman1918,2007-12-23T16:14Z,"Although I appreciate the high quality rip, if you truly wish to perfect your rips, you NEED to use Exact Audio Copy with AccurateRip. Firstly, EAC rips in a mode called ""Secure Mode"" which rips every sector AT LEAST twice, making sure that both reads are identical. This further insures error-free rips. Secondly, EAC allows you to detect and set the correct read offset for your drive. Almost all drives read either before or past the actual calculated read point, resulting in the ripped audio being offset. The offset is more severe for some drives, but for almost all drives this offset is a constant number of sectors which can be detected and then corrected. Third, AccurateRip is a vast database of audio track CRCs. When utilizing AccurateRip functionality in EAC, every ripped track's CRC will be checked against the CRCs in AccurateRip's database. AccurateRip will also return a ""confidence"" number, which essentially tells you how many people returned that same CRC. For example, if I rip a track and it passes the AccurateRip check with a confidence rating of 41, then that means that my ripped track is identical roughly 41 other people's rips. I can then be fairly certain that my rip is perfect. The Exact Audio Copy website has thorough documentation on all of this. You should really check it out.

EAC ""Secure Mode"" + Correct Drive Offset + AccurateRip = Flawless Rips. Combine this with EAC generated CUE sheets, and you can ensure that your FLAC releases are bit-for-bit IDENTICAL to the original disc. For examples on how such releases are done, search for ""NEORIP"" on other torrent sites. These are a few releases that I beta'd for a little while, to test the method. I'll hopefully be making more of them soon.

Anyhow, you may think that I'm being a perfectionist and overly paranoid, but the true purpose of a FLAC release is to losslessy archive the contents of the original disc, and it's not an archive if it's not truly bit-for-bit identical. Good luck."
