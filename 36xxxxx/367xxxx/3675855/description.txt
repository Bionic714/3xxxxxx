*One thing to note is track #10 Angelmoon was originally released down in South Beach Miami and the version was done at a faster speed. When they commercialized it and rerecorded it for mainstream radio they decided on slowing it down a bit and totally ruined it. The version I included on this compilation is the original right off the record. Enjoy.....
