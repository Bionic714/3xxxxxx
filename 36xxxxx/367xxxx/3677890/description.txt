Kung Fu Genius (1979)

Overview:	Cliff Lok is the kung fu genius, a master of all styles of martial arts. On the suggestion of his friend (Cheng Hong Yip) he decides to open a school, but runs into conflic with Chan Lung's Spiritual Boxing gym. When a local brothel owner (Lee Hoi Sang) hears that his son was seriously wounded in the conflict, he brings in his brother, fan-wielding killer Wilson Tong, to deal with the genius style.

Cliff Lok's inspired fighting, coupled with first-rate action (orchestrated by Wilson Tong) combine to make "Kung Fu Genius" an awesome martial arts comedy. Watch out for Chan Lung's duck fist--it's a quack-up!
