,walindour,2008-03-06T18:51Z,Get a new computer then. If you know how to use your eyes then you'll see AVI's asshole.
,bell0q,2008-03-15T03:22Z,"Wow. Someone's got MKV envy. Frankly, AVI sucks for video-audio sync for high-bandwidth.

I could encode it into Quicktime, which is even better for A/V sync, but then all you Mac-envying gomers would really have a cow."

Thanks "
