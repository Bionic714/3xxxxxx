THE SMELL OF PARADISE
First Shown on: BBC Four Tue 24 Jan 2006, 1:55 - 2:55am

For over 10 years, film-makers Mariusz Pilis and Marcin Mamon have travelled around the world, talking to warlords, clan-leaders, emirs and mullahs, terrorists and godfathers, but foremost to many common believers of Dar al-Islam, the abode of Islam. All to try and understand what drives people to wage war with the western world. What makes people sacrifice their lives, utterly convinced that this is the only way to save or create the world as they want it to be? What is so irresistible about The Smell of Paradise?
