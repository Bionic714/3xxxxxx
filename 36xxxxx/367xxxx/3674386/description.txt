About the video:
----------------

90 minutes of demolition evidence and analysis, laced with staggering witness testimonials. Careful deconstruction of the Official Story, set right alongside clean, clear science.

911 Mysteries is a very good and interesting documentary about 
the events that took place in New York City, on September 11th, 2001.

It talks about things that almost no other documentary has ever talked about.
You will see and hear things that you have never seen or heard on TV.

It raises a lot of questions that you have probably never thought of before.
 
For example, the documentary goes in-depth about the physics of the collapse of the towers, and also talks about WTC7, which has always been more or less ignored by the news-media.

Firefighters, survivors, New-Yorkers, and the people who worked inside the 
towers tell the previously untold story of what they saw and heard on that day.

Just some of the questions that are raised and looked at in detail are: 

- Why no large steel building has ever collapsed due to a fire.
- How you get a 110-story pancake collapse in 10 seconds or less.
- Why Building 7 (WTC7) suddenly imploded, although it was not hit by a plane.
- How hot an uncontrolled open air, kersosene-fuelled fire actually gets.
- Why people inside the towers heard explosions everywhere, including the basement. 
- How and why the nearly-indestructible core of both towers simply vanished.
- How the towers could disintegrate into fine dust in just 10 seconds.
- Why New-Yorkers who live near Ground Zero have now developed lung cancer.

The documentary compares real science and witness testimonials of people who actually were there, against the Official Story that 19 cavemen somehow defied the laws of physics.

The documentary compares real collapsed buildings with buildings 
destroyed by demolition explosives and looks and the differences.

And much, much more...
