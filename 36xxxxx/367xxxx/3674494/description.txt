┬╖   The most realistic fish motion and behavior of any virtual aquarium.

┬╖   A fiddler crab that cleans the bottom of the aquarium and chases fish.

┬╖   Fish have articulated fins, moving eyes, gills and mouth.

┬╖   Beautiful shifting light rays, ground ripples, gently waving plants that fish can swim into, soft shadows cast by fish, configurable bubble streams, auto-feeding.

┬╖   Add well over a hundred fish, and change settings without having to exit the aquarium.

┬╖   Free demo aquarium screensaver contains NO adware or spyware.

┬╖   Widescreen formatting, multi-monitor support & much more!
