I dont need to download this to know this is the same exact thing i posted at the end of february... the size is EXACTLY the same as my torrent.
I do not appreciate people stealing my work, i worked hard has hell to make these books in such high quality. I dotn care if you release a different version of the books, but to re-release the identical copies of what i released is BS.
Please go to this link to download the torrent, dont download this one, he just re-released the identical books i took time to create.
I dont care that you are releasing harry potter, i am not jk rowling, but i do care that you are simply releasing the torrent i released, without first asking me, and not giving credit, but even then you are just re-releasing the same thing i released, which i created, i didnt steal it from someone else. This is the second person to do this on this website, and someone else did it on mininova... so annoying.
Here is the link:

,dkiraz,2007-06-03T01:16Z,"the difference wub is that i created the identical content, even though i stole the material from JK obviously, it took a lot of work to get the books in his quality. Now someone who did no work at all just repost the identical thing, doing no work at all... that is why i am so irretated. I dont care if anyone posts harry potter stuff, makes no difference to me, i am sure JK hates all of us that steal her work... im just annoyed that this guy would just repost the identical thing i posted."
