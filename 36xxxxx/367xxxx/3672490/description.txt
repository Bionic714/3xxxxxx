DONNY AND MARIE OSMOND - I'M LEAVING IT ALL UP TO YOU (1974)

This is a vinyl rip from an excellent condition album. Cleaned up and encoded at 356 kbps.
Donny and Marie were at the top of their game when this album was released in 1974, and they scored two huge hits singles from it-the title track and "Morning Side Of The Mountain". In addition, they do a remake of Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell's "It Takes Two".
In retrospect, they may be considered somewhat of a punch line now, but this was clean, harmless pop that worked well back in the day.
Seed and enjoy!
