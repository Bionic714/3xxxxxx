the rar file is split into 2 parts, but if you unrar either one it automatically unrars the other one as well. "

,sean-nirvana,2007-11-23T16:50Z,"hey, just wonderin what folder on the psp you stick the game files into"
,Eotale,2008-03-03T18:06Z,"Okay,
First download the torrent, open it with Bitcommet or whatever.
Then when you downloaded the file you open the map, you'll see 2 .RAR files, Unrar them both (PASSWORD =psp.stm-gaming.com)
Then Put part 1 on ur PSP Folder called ISO and ur set.
And when you finished playing part 1 you just save the file at the end en start the second part.
Easy as cake.
-Eotale OUT! XD"

,PaT2090,2008-03-26T01:54Z,"This is missing cutscenes after the first boss fight. 

But it does fit on a 1gb. You can either download a full rip or download this and watch the missing cutscenes on youtube or something. 

That's what I'm doing...unfortunately"
