,Temptation,2007-04-27T07:35Z,"well.. I'm not really interested in this torrent as Windows ME is legendary as one of the worst Windows operating systems (you're better of using Windows 98SE for older systems than using horrible ME), but about your seeding problem.. what client are you using to seed?  I know BitComet has problems with seeding if you're downloading something that has lots of peers.  So try using utorrent or Azureus "

,warpengi,2007-10-30T04:40Z,"Windows ME is the worst excuse for an operating system ever.  Take Win95 1st edition, add fragmentation and file system issues, registry corruption from installing 3rd party apps and MS patented Give-Everything-Root-Access (tm).  What do you get?  Regular BSOD's, a system loaded with malware that runs slower and slower by the day until you do a complete reinstall of the OS and all applications.  Well you only have to reinstall about 3x/year to keep it running smoothly.

Rumours of people running ME trouble free have never been confirmed.  Mostly just trolls claiming impossible miracles or schizophrenics who heard it from Bill in the grooves of an old Beatles record."
,yogi_bear,2007-11-04T08:00Z,"I have had a PERFECT record from ME!!!  It is seriously THE BEST operating system EVER!!

,PeterAichinger,2008-02-13T17:43Z,"Take the diskdefragmenter of WinMe to replace the defragmenter in your Win9x. A lot faster defragmentation.

Beside that I don't know much about Me. Was the original CD bootable at all or is this only a fault of the image in this torrent?"
,Halomaster,2008-03-07T16:41Z,"all u dumbasses who keep talking shit about Win ME: STFU!!!    i've had it, worked great for me, no problems at all, and it was damn fast! booted fast and when it got to the dashboard, it was all ready"
,805566,2008-03-18T12:56Z,"Let's set the record straight.

Windows Me is in the books as the worst MS OS ever (with good reason--it is entirely unstable). Most just opted for 2000 since it was actually released in 1999 (a year before Me).

Me's only advantages:
vs. 95/98: The networking stack from Win2k.
vs. 2k/XP: The Win9x codebase (not NT)--very fast and compatible with DOS and Win3.1 apps.

System Restore is a hunka shit. Don't use it.

If I were stuck with a 9x-based OS, my pick would be 95c. It supports FAT32 and USB, and if you install IE4, you get 98's Active Desktop (but really.. it's a feature you've been spoiled on.. Convert your favorite wallpaper to BMP format, edit the Start menu using Explorer, and you'll NEVER notice the absence of Active Desktop, other than keeping a fast and solid system. I'm getting to the solid part.)

For whiners, two options.
One: Don't use 95/98/Me. Shut up.
Two: Use 98lite to strip the Me source of all the extra shit that makes it crash so much. Not hard to figure out. There's small words and lots of colors. Once it's rebuilt, THEN burn it and install.

Much like XP is hardly any good without applying nLite to the source (search 'tx4' on TPB for my nLite/XP ISO), Me takes a little tweaking as well. So understand that before running the full-bloat installation and getting the same shitty results that everyone else did eight years ago.

Kudos on the torrent, Security718."
,tengeta,2008-03-22T08:58Z,"no idea why i want it, but i do.

maybe because i always played diablo 2 on my win98 machine next to a friend who had winME and it just raped him everytime anything processor intensive happened... GOOD TIMES!

other than that, i guess i just want all the OS'es i can download because i have enough disk space to make endless virtual machines... so i really don't care how much it crashes, thanks!"

,ai.unit,2008-06-28T07:15Z,"For those curious to know why some people may still want to use Win ME, there are things called compatibility issues that force some people to revert to an older OS in order to have a program to work properly.

,LifeSympathy,2008-09-09T07:23Z,"@ HelloKiddy

If you are trying to install this to a clean HDD, you must have a DOS startup disk (floppy drive):

1. When booted from the floppy type ""fdisk""

2. When the program loads, select option one and let it perform it.  Say yes to everything and then when it comes to the label, just push enter.

3. Restart your computer.

4. When up in DOS again, type ""format c:""

5. When done, type the letter drive of the CD and type ""setup.exe"""

I installed it on a computer with 700mhz, 64mbs of ram, two cd drives, and one floppy drive.  I followed LifeSympathy's directions and it worked.

-Here's the specific image i used:

http://www.answersthatwork.com/Download_Area/Downrights/Win98SE_Boot_CD_USA.zip

Once I burned the windows 98 image to a cd, I booted it up and followed LifeSympathy's instructions. 

This version also requires a cd key, luckily I had one on the side of the computer i was working on. 

If you are new to DOS, it might take a little research to figure everything out. This Windows ME version installed without any problems and so far has been stable and clean."

,koman90,2009-05-21T05:39Z,"apending to what 805566 said

windows ME was just a new name for windows 98
and windows 2000 was a new name foe windows NT

the only new features added were:
-support for USB mass storage
-support for Multimedia devices 
eg, Digital Cameras, MP3 Players, webcams, ect.
- and ""enhanced"" plug 'n play support

these to oses are still a good alternative for those computers that are just a little to slow to run XP though"
,crook16 ,2009-09-22T06:18Z,"yeah foos i dont care if its title is THE WORST OS EVER and i dont give a wet slap if you can sit there and throw me 20000 reasons why i shouldnt get it and how much you think it sucks
I SEARCHED FOR THIS BECAUSE I WANTED THIS

you haters searched for it just to bitch about it so please go get laid and stay away from the torrents you hate cuz i dont care if its unstable  i want it for my own reasons and i think i speak for everyone with a brain cell and a tad of logic"
,fanman93,2010-01-26T15:53Z,"I found that the only major issue is that the CD isn't bootable. I did find a solution, though, although it is a bit lengthy. I know that it doesn't boot setup directly, but you have to create a DOS partition for it anyway, so this actually is the best way to do it.

1) Download Magic ISO or any other program that allows you to fool around with ISO files

2) Open the ISO file

3) If you don't have a floppy image of DOS 6.22 with a CD driver, it's about time you got one. You can't continue without it.

4) In Magic ISO, go to Tools=>Load boot image...

5) Find your copy of the DOS boot image (Make sure the option selected is ""From bootable image file"")

6) You're done! Just click save, and you've made a bootable Windows ME CD!

For installation (clean install):

1) When MS-DOS loads, type ""fdisk"" and press enter.

2) Follow the instructions for making a primary and secondary DOS partition. You can do this as many times as needed, since for some reason known only to Microsoft, Windows ME doesn't support FAT32 while installing.

3) Now, here's the part that I really don't know why I have to do: exit fdisk, and reboot your system. Type ""format_c:_/s"" where ""_"" is a mandatory space. Do this until all your partitions are formatted (each one should be labeled in order from c:\)

4) Odds are, your CD drive is labeled ""r:\"" in DOS. Type ""r:\"" and press enter. Then, type ""setup"" and press enter. You're good to go! Just follow the instructions, and when your computer reboots, just repeat this step.

I hope this helps. I think it would be much easier to just upload a torrent of this, but my bandwidth isn't very good right now, so I'll just hope that this is enough."
,DJShocker,2010-02-18T17:23Z,Wow thanks fanman...i was sittin here tryin to figure out why the DOS wouldn't connect to the CD drive and noticed you said R: u kick ass bro!

,Drmgiver1,2010-08-26T20:58Z,Thats because ME wasn't actually an operating system.  It was an application finder that ran on top of DOS.  XP was the first real Windows operating system.

,LittleMrJ,2011-12-03T21:44Z,"This torrent works like a champ.  
It installs perfectly on older systems, & the key is accurate. 

Use Windows ME to salvage older systems that wont recognise newer OS, then upgrade from there if you want. 

If you can't get this to install, it's either because you don't know what you're doing, or you have a newer motherboard with chipset limitations. 
You MUST download Windows ME Startup (from any of a hundred websites), & save it to a floppy, to create a boot disk. A floppy boot disk is required for EVERY copy of Microsoft ME.

If your modern system doesn't have a dinosaur floppy drive, then you shouldn't be installing ME in the fist place. Very few programs work with ME anymore anyway, & Microsoft stopped updating & patching it nearly 8 years ago.

Good OS for it's purpose, great torrent.

Thanks man, this helped me rebuild 5 old computers I found in a deserted warehouse. I then upgraded them to XP & gave 'em to my friends' kids."
