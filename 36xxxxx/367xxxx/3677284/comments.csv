Did any one else have problems playing the DTS HD or DOLBY PLUS?
I have tried PowerDVD 7.3  but no sound.
It did play THE BOURNE SUPREMACY but this came with AC3 5.1.
Also NERO does not play it (it ask for the HD-PLUGIN, and i dont find it in any of the downloads) Now i have tried many downloads of both players but non can play it!
Please anyone HELP!"

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

,valdyn,2008-01-04T21:31Z,"Unfortunately mplayer cannot decode this movie properly. That wouldn't be that bad if it was possible to remux and/or transcode it. However even though haali media splitter is capable of demuxing it to _view_ it on windows, dsmux.exe / gdsmux.exe ( both part of the haali package )fail to convert it.
I assume the movie has errors, but might aswell be that abovementioned programs are broken.
