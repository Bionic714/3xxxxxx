,nihilast,2007-05-05T22:45Z,"Are you seeding this torrent at all, Mr. uploader?
Everyone has been stuck on 74,9% for some time now.

,DXMage,2007-05-06T07:55Z,Seed please
,DXMage,2007-05-08T00:22Z,I give up this is a bullshit torrent.  A seeder that shows up once in a while and thats it.   Five days of trying isn't worth it.  Two days and half a percent of progress is too much with this many people hammering away at it. 
,infiniter,2007-05-08T22:09Z,"I can't help it. It is in the upload queue amongst others, I can see it uploading constantly. For now I have uploaded it nearly two times, so actually there gotta be many seeders. Dunno why there's only 1."
,infiniter,2007-05-08T22:11Z,"I guess it's the fuc** piratebay tracker. I created this torrent only with TPB tracker in it and uploaded it here. There is another torrent for this DVD, with other trackers. Find in at the usual places and copy the trackers over to your download. This should solve the problem."
,Bong-o,2007-05-09T02:58Z,"1.7 meens there are 1.7 copies!!! You have 1 and all the others have .7!!!  You did not do it right with the other tracker. I dont see the file with password they require.

Try deleting the other tracker torrent file and use pirate bay only. they may be corrupting things because you didn't follow there rules.
Also, Why does the file size at the top of this page not match the file size shown when you click on the ""1"" at the top to see the file?

I think you messed up with this one. Maybe try again it looks like a good movie."
,Yamipirogoeth,2008-06-30T10:26Z,Is there anyone who could finish seeding this? I've been stuck at 93.7% for months.
