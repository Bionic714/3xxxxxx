Synopsis

Released in 1971 to critical acclaim and public controversy, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW garnered eight Academy Award┬« nominations (including Best Picture) and was hailed as the most important work by a young American director since Citizen Kane. A surprisingly frank, bittersweet drama of social and sexual mores in small-town Texas, the film features a talent-laden cast led by Jeff Bridges (The Mirror Has Two Faces), Cybill Shepherd (TVs "Cybill") and Timothy Bottoms (The Man in the Iron Mask). Cloris Leachman (TVs "The Mary Tyler Moore Show") and Ben Johnson (Rio Grande) each won Oscars┬« for their work in supporting roles. This modern classic is a must-have for every movie lover.
