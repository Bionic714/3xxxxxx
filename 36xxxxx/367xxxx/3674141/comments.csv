How do convert these using WINAVI to fit on numerous DVD's so I dont have to reduce too much of the quality

Burned plenty of movies, but usually only 700-1400MB (2.7GB when converted to DVD), so they always fit on one DVD and never had the problem.

Thanks"

there are also alot of guides here:

Having problems playing this.  Have downloaded fully the first few episodes, but when I try to play them I get audio but no video.  Have latest CCCP and have tried Zoom, Media Classic etc.  

Any suggestions?  Thanks"
