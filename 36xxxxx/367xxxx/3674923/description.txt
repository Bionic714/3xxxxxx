This is the never released 2nd album by the real singers of Milli Vanilli. (Not the 2 guys as seen in the videos) It's actually a good album and a few of the tracks were sold to other groups. one of them, "When I die" was a huge hit for the group No Mercy. Anyway, I'm sure if the scandal never happened this album would have been another multi platinum selling hit. I happened to be close with some of them and I felt that the public should get a chance to enjoy this work of music. Enjoy.....
