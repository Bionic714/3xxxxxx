Thanx a lot!!! "
,jrbrewin,2007-05-05T22:08Z,"glad you enjoyed it, and i'm glad so many people have downloaded it, and hopefully enjoyed it too.

the mixing, i think, is quite progressive and different to a lot of other DJs.

let me know if you want more from previous years, as well as some dub / chillout / psychedlic / breakbeat mixes."

Used MixMeister (great prog, by the way). I'm really curious about hearing this. Really good idea to separate it into different files. Excellent!"
