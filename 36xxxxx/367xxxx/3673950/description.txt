as the bald man, and eskimo's 'radio sucks' says.

"cds like this one spare you from all the chart-topping, teeny-bopping, disposable happy horseshit that brings up the bile from the back of my neck. I have no time or tolerance for those shitty, whack acts like that. I wouldn't piss on their cds to put out a fire. And I'm tired of those lame-ass, tame-ass, pre-fabricated, sorry excuses for singers and musicians who don't even write their own songs. What the world needs now is a musical revolution. We need some rock, we need something that has balls! We need something with substance, depth, something with soul, some edge, some passion, some power. Shit, if it's gonna be mellow, fuck, man, it better have something, it better mean something. I'll tell you, you gotta hit 'em with something hard. I'm so fuckin' tired of the shit that I'm hearing on the radio. Radio sucks!"
