"More inventive than Quentin Tarantino, Takashi Ishii continues to explore his
distinct vision of Tokyo as a dark, forbidding Technopolis, a city of faceless
chrome and marble structures, cold lights, and deep shadows.

The Black Angel stars Riona Hazuki as Ikko, the most powerful female action
heroine ever to hit celluloid. At age 6, Ikko was safely put on a plane to Los
Angeles by underworld hitman Mayo, who goes under the nom de guerre Black Anglel -
but not before seeing her Yakuza boss father and mistress mother killed before her
eyes.

Flash forward 14 years Ikko returns to Tokyo seeking revenge for the killings. She
too calls herself the Black Angle styling herself after Mayo, whom she remembers
as a towering, almost superhuman figure. Wher her target realises that she is
after him and his gang, he enlists the original Black Angel to wipe out Ikko, and
the stage is set for a violent reunion..."
