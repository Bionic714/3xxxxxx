The singer?s greatest attribute is how he seems like he?s not of his time, but resident in the barren and beautiful recording studios of the ?50s. This is particularly true during the tender, dirge-meets-slow dance sway of ?Hurt to Try? that kicks off like something Andy Stochansky might attempt before veering into a sweet pop melody. Here Brosseau fleshes out the tune with drums and electric guitar, not breaking through the surface, but just brimming underneath. It makes for some nice tension as it evolves. There are some spacey keyboards that saunter in near the conclusion too. From there Brosseau gets back to basics on the rootsy ?Mary Anne?, which feels like it was nailed on the first take, leaving the listener to provide the percussion with either finger snaps or tapping fingers on some hard surface.

Brosseau is at his best when he keeps things to a minimum, whether it is instruments or his rudimentary but appealing wordplay, even if it something as mundane as fishing or farming during the strange and somewhat unnerving ?How to Grow a Woman from the Ground?. And he drops this little gem of a phrase early in the offering: ?The night was a chalkboard with a fingernail moon.? It is also where he hits some of the higher range, effeminate notes crystal clear. Brosseau might not be a household name yet, but it?s these first songs (some of which were included on earlier recordings like Late Night at Largo, North Dakota and a five-song demo entitled Outtakes v. 1) that should make you seek out what else this guy has done. And hopefully continues to do?
