FRANK FONTAINE - SONGS I SING ON THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW (1962)

This is a vinyl rip-I did my best to clean it up, encoded it at 320 kbps, and I think it sounds pretty good for a 45 year old record. If you must, it is available on CD, according to Amazon.
Frank(ie) Fontaine was a comedian best known for his character Crazy Guggenheim which recurred on Jackie Gleason's popular TV show. When Gleason found out that Fontaine was a tenor with a tremendous voice, he spotlighted his singing ability, as well as his comic ability, on the show. This album, the result of his national exposure, shot to number one on the Billboard album chart in 1962. Fontaine died in the early 70's at a young age of a heart attack, and is pretty much forgotten today, but this album of standards fits like an old suit, and thanks in part to Gleason's band leaders/arrangers, sounds great today.
Enjoy and please seed.
