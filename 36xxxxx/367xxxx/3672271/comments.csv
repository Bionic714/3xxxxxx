It would be better if u seeded only this torrent for a while so speed could increase! Just a tip!

,funkysnair,2007-05-05T21:11Z,"i am a funkyhouse nut myself but i would not have label'e this torrent as it is label'd

it is mearly commercial pop.....

hed kandi is funky house as far as i can tell funky house evolved from old school disco.

good torrent though, you put some time and effort into it A+"
,softsofty,2007-05-07T10:08Z,"Correct, this is not a collection of pure funky housemusic. As described, this is a collection of all the mainstream hits over a period of 40 years, that includes a lot of funk from the 70?s and 80?s, and a lot of house from the 80?s, 90?s. The majority of the house music can be labelled ?Deep House?, especially housemusic from 1990 to 1995, but some techno can be found here as well.

And you are absolutely correct, Hed Kandi makes some very fine collections of funky housemusic :)"

Once  more thanks a lot for these nice cheese"
,swollusss,2007-07-12T12:25Z,"Eh! ""Funky House!?!?!""

What a crock of commercial shit! Surely pop hits from a funky house perspective would be, for example, James Brown, Giorgio Moroder, Donna Summer, Arthur Baker, New Order, Human League not the cunting Backstreet Boys or Culture Beat!!! Culture Beat!!! Did Jesus die on the cross so we'd be forced to listen to cocking Culture Beat!

I'm not knocking you for sharing tunes you like but this is about as mistitled a torrent as you could possibly find. Unless there's one out there titled '1000 great Italian recipes' that contains nothing but pictures of circuit boards on fire...Idiot."
,mc___cool94,2007-07-16T08:58Z,really good music!!! thanks for this torrent!!!

What is house music to you?
2 Unlimited, Benny Benassi, Culture Beat, Technotronic?

Thanks for the effort but no thanks."
,softsofty,2007-07-30T14:00Z,"Wow, look who?s talking. With an upload like this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3298365/melodifestivalen_2005, you must be the biggest House expert out there. 
HALLOOO, this is a collection of HITS, if you read the first line in the description of this torrent it clearly says that this is mainstream. BUT: you will find some funky house stuff in here as well.
You obviously do not know any of the good house stuff from back in the 90?s, you were properly running around and shitting your pants back then. You recournize the mainstream crap like 2 Unlimited, Benny Benassi, Culture Beat, Technotronic, and think: ?Ohh, that must be what he think is house music?. 

I?ll give you some Deep house examples:
  Alcatraz - Giv Me Luv (1996)
  Clubland - Hold On (1991)
  Crystal Waters - Makin' Happy (Hurley's Happy House Mix) (1991)
  Double Dee - Found Love (1990)
  Heller & Farley Project - Ultra Flava (Vox Version) (1996)
  Kym Sims - Too Blind To See It (1992)
  Mark Morrison - Return of the Mack (Joe T. Vannelli Light Mix) (1996)
  Robin S - Show Me Love (1993)
  Rosie Gaines - Closer That Close (1995)

And just because some of those tracks made it in to the charts, does not make them any less funky!

If you do not want to download this? just stay away and shut up, you moron!

But I?ll give you this? The Trance Aumatic Remix of 2 Unlimited - Faces from 1993, is fucking funky deep house to me?"

Common!! Guns and Roses??????? Pearl Jam?!?!?

Can you get any less funky or house like then those? 
maybe if the compilation was called ""years of hits from a rock and grunge perspective"" ok

but a load of tracks have nothing to do in this list, if the list has this title.

It's like posting a list ""greated rock & metal tracks of the last 40 years""...
 And then have Milly Vanilli tracks in the list...

there's no particulary funky or house perspective  or red line throughout the list, as such the correct title should have been
""40 years of hits""

no more , no less. "

This comp probably took weeks or even months of time not cause of the songs but every single file is sorted correctly w/genre name...everything!

Yet, you won't take a few minutes to go through the list and uncheck what you don't want.
