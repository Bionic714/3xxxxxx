,MrMackey,2007-04-28T20:21Z,"Is it really that simple? I remember having a hard time installing this game in Dosbox, let alone a real Dos-machine. Perhaps these images are different?"
,Sabercat,2007-04-28T22:06Z,The game should work fine under Windows XP with compatibility mode.
,MrMackey,2007-04-28T22:57Z,"Well, have you tried it? There's a text-file on one of the images saying that the game can only run under Dos and not even Windows 95."
,Sabercat,2007-04-29T15:37Z,"I have tried it under Windows XP with compatibility mode, yes. It works fine for me.
It's come to my attention, though, that on some computers, the installation program will only detect one CD drive/virtual drive, which means the game needs to be read from the primary drive.
Other than that, there shouldn't be any problems."

,Aequitas,2008-06-17T01:29Z,"I NEED to get this game! I have the discs right here, but they're all scratched up. A friend borrowed them without permission once. :(

There are two seeds now, so please stay on!"
,Aequitas,2008-06-17T15:36Z,"It's finished thanks to an awesome seed from whom I reached speeds of several hundred kilobytes per second, thank you!

The game works perfectly for me, after a little tweaking in DOSBox (with D-Fend)."
,Bondeolsen1,2008-06-20T18:13Z,"I am going crazy here...

i got the game installed through Dosbox, but i cant start it. It says a DRASTIC ""sounds serious""
error has occured.. It cant find PANEL file.. what the hell is a panel file."
,Aequitas,2008-06-23T22:28Z,"That just means you need the disc. Have it mounted, both on your computer AND as the ""CDDrive"" in DOSBox."
