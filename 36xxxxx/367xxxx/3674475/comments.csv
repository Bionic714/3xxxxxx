,thefinalsound,2007-09-21T15:38Z,"it's nice that they are ""complete"" albums.  BUT, they are generally low bitrate, tagged wrong(no correct song sequencing), also, some albums you get the song you want to hear but it happens to be the live version not the studio version for some reason.  whoever put this together was laaazyy."
,calicyco13,2007-10-02T22:10Z,"What a horrible download. The tags are all wrong, the files are a big mess. You'll have a hell of a time sorting it all out with your mp3 player. Whoever put this together did a really lame job."
,krait,2008-02-06T16:09Z,thx krait /budapest/
,supergrease,2008-03-08T18:15Z,gött att du fått med soundhose och live från göteborg!
,druss666uk,2008-03-09T12:09Z,"I have to admit, most of these files are tagged correctly, however a few of them are not. The singles are fine, but the live releases are all messed the hell up.

I will release my own version of this torrent, only done correctly some time soon."
,g0t_snaks,2008-03-20T18:38Z,"And again, the eternal question...

What's the bitrate values?

COME ON.. Why just don't add it to the description?"
,bigfjell,2008-03-25T02:31Z,"if ure so great maiden fans why do u download their albums? it isn't very supportive...
i have almost every maiden cd and i paid for it altho i could have downloaded them. 
i'm grateful for this tho cuz then i don't need to bother ripping all my maiden cd's to my computer. 
all i'm saying is that u ain't real maiden fans until u pay for it =P"

,spikeymikeydoa,2008-06-22T16:23Z,"Why do we download their albums? Hmm... Let Me think...

I have all their albums on CD AND Vinyl, most of them I have on picture disc also, and about 70% of them on tape. All bought & paid for with real cash money in shops. So why am I downloading this torrent... well, can you double click a picture disc or CD? And just how long do you reckon it would take to rip all the CD's? And to get the obscure B-sides from all the 7"" singles would need special equipment. This way is just easier. We're not all 'on the rob' in here you know."
,Helmfriden,2008-07-20T22:28Z,Seed please!
,WushuTricks,2008-08-07T21:48Z,What the fuck is with all these horrible torrents lately? Ever heard of lame mp3 converter? Uploading mp3s in VBR or 320 kbps is a fucking standard now so why fucking rip them in this shit quality. Fuck this garbage failure torrent.

,Jimself,2010-07-04T02:45Z,"limewire automatically deleted this for me, saying it was a ""Dangerous file."""
,asifq666,2010-08-08T04:18Z,hey guys what is the bitrate for the studio albums
,elcapizzo,2010-08-18T10:55Z,one or two of the songs were shit quality. otherwise all good.
,KrOmY,2010-08-25T15:33Z,please seeeeeeeedddd
,j800r,2010-09-04T10:13Z,"fake. the guy has pieced together tracks from multiple albums and passed them off as the genuine studio albums in some cases. the Fear Of The Dark album is a joke. half of the tracks are live. Sorry, but people saying this is a GOOD torrent have something seriously wrong with them. Great band, awesome music, CRAP torrent. This should be taken down and sorted out. I'm deleting what i've downloaded and i'm not gonna seed. I have been mislead and I wouldn't want anyone else going through the same shit. Sort it, uploader."
,thantos123,2010-09-27T20:47Z,"""Fake"" ? 

What does a couple of incomplete albums have to do with being ""fake""? If this torrent was in actuality a Justin Bieber discography, THEN such a comment would be justified.

Anyhow, I'm pretty sure the uploader wasn't deliberately trying to mislead anyone here. The issue is probably caused by the file names for album and live versions of certain songs being the same, resulting in studio tracks being overwritten by live versions and vice-versa. 

So yeah, not a well made torrent by any stretch of the imagination, but hardly anything to get your panties knotted over. There's plenty of other IM discography torrents available. :D"

,jdog777,2012-06-12T19:07Z,"Looks like i cant seed, and even if i did, it would be like 1 or 2 kb a day, would take months to reach 1.1 ratio.  But 4 some reason the Megadeth is uploading like 30 kbps. dunno why, but its hogging up my download bandwidth, and im not sure how to decrease it until its done downloading. plus im more likely to get caught if im seeding. but im encrypted and using a proxy, and the worst that can happen is i get a warning letter, right?"
