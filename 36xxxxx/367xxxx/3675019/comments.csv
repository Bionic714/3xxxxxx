,lawin,2007-04-28T17:34Z,IÂ´m quite sure that is not THE HERD from the sixties but HERD from 2005??!!
,anic8038,2007-04-29T02:00Z,This would be the Australian Hip Hop band The Herd.

Wouldn't by any chance have their other albums?
I did but they're all scratched up bad now and living in norway it's not so easy to get hold of this great music."

Peace out"
