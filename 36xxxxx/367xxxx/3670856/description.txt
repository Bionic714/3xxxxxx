Featuring Magnus "The Giant Swede" Samuelsson and presented by Svend "Viking Power!" Karlsen.

It's a heady title, but it's really only partly true: we'd guess that Magnus Samuelsson also has the World's Strongest Hands, because if you're familiar with his best performances on the No. 4 Captains of Crush Gripper or on the Rolling Thunder, you know why we say that. Learn from the best. About 1 hour; DVD has NTSC version on one side, PAL on the other. A Colin Bryce production.
