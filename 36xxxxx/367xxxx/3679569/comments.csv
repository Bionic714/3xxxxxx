,Xwolverine,2007-05-03T15:23Z,the question for the info was about subs probably...so are there any subs ???
,God.Hunter.89,2007-05-05T03:43Z,"You people need to look a little better.
Subs etc are in English. And by the dvd box,that is all it is.
If you want more details, check out IMDB, a user posted a link for it here. I forgot to put it up when i listed this.
Any more questions?"
