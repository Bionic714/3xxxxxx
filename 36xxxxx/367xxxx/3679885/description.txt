Plot:
A comedic satire of films that are large in scope, 
reputation and popularity


Notes:

Epic.Movie.DVDSCR.XviD-NEPTUNE isn't a true dvdscr, its
a workprint with too many different scenes, angles and
too much things not present in the theatrical version.
Also the watermark "PROPERTY OF TWENIETH CENTURY FOX HOME
ENTERTAINMENT" its fake because company name is "TWENTIETH 
CENTURY FOX" and not "TWENIETH"
...majors dont do this mistakes...
Our version is the theatrical movie with all scenes, no fake
watermarks and nice line audio... quality is also really 
better than neptune release, have fun!
