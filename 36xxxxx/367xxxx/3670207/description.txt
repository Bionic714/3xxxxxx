Robin Leonard Trower (born March 9, 1945 in Catford, South East London, England) is a preeminent English rock guitarist who achieved success with Procol Harum during the 1960's, and then again as the leader of his own Hendrixesque power trio.

He grew up in the seaside resort of Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England.

In 1962 Robin Trower formed a group that would come to be known as The Paramounts, later including fellow Southend High School pupil Gary Brooker. The Paramounts disbanded in 1966 to pursue individual projects. Trower then joined new band Procol Harum in 1967, and where he remained until 1972. After going solo in 1973, he found the individual identity and style that have brought him acclaim to this day.
