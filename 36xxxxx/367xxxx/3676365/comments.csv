**                                                                **  **
**  The idea of a video game emulating the mechanics of a board   **  **
**  game is nothing new; there have been digital renditions of    **  **
**  board games on most every console made. However, with the     **  **
**  recent success of Mario Party, game companies are tapping     **  **
**  the ""party game"" genre with a renewed fervor, this time       **  **
**  adding popular video game mascots to the mix.                 **  **
**  Unfortunately, not all of these games are able to reach the   **  **
**  same level of revelry as the new party game archetype,        **  **
**  Mario Party. Sonic Shuffle, Sega's entry into the genre, is   **  **
**  not only a poorly realized party game, it's also a boring     **  **
**  one to boot.                                                  **  **
**                                                                **  **
**  Sonic Shuffle takes characters from the Sonic universe -      **  **
**  starting off with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy -- and      **  **
**  puts them into what's essentially a 3D board game.            **  **
**  Characters move around the board via a set of randomly        **  **
**  assigned cards; the number on each card dictates how many     **  **
**  spaces your character can move in one turn. The spaces        **  **
**  themselves trigger different events, such as giving or        **  **
**  taking away rings, which can be used to buy power-up gems,    **  **
**  move to other spaces on the board, go into a card battle,     **  **
**  and go into a minigame.                                       **  **
**                                                                **  **
**  In Mario Party, Sonic Shuffle's primary competitor, the       **  **
**  minigames make up the bulk of the game time, and the board    **  **
**  game is simply a means to access them expediently. Such is    **  **
**  not the case in Sonic Shuffle. The spaces that trigger the    **  **
**  minigames are sparsely scattered across the board, and it     **  **
**  is by no means necessary to play the minigames in order to    **  **
**  complete the game. In fact, it's entirely possible to go      **  **
**  through a game of Sonic Shuffle without playing a single      **  **
**  minigame. The minigames, once you actually get to one, have   **  **
**  the tendency to be confusing and pointlessly complex. The     **  **
**  joy of minigames comes from their ease of play - anyone can   **  **
**  pick them up, and from there it's simply a four-way test of   **  **
**  skill. In Sonic Shuffle, more often than not, the minigames   **  **
**  are a test of who can decipher the needlessly bewildering     **  **
**  gameplay first. For example, one of the minigames puts you    **  **
**  on a beach, with a big, evil, Robotnik-shaped sun overhead.   **  **
**  There is an umbrella in the middle of the sand, and all       **  **
**  four players are jockeying for control of the umbrella.       **  **
**  After a set amount of time, the big, evil, angry sun blows    **  **
**  heat waves at the beach, knocking a handful of rings out of   **  **
**  everyone who doesn't have an umbrella - unless, of course,    **  **
**  you're standing under the stationary shade in the lower       **  **
**  left-hand corner of the screen. Whoever has control of the    **  **
**  umbrella when the heat blast comes can then run around and    **  **
**  collect any rings on the beach until everyone gathers their   **  *"

,frozen_dude,2008-05-29T00:04Z,"Just for the record: ""backup"" DC games that are not patched with an auto-booter can only be started by first inserting a special boot-disc, and then switching that disc with the game disc when prompted. (not needed for emus tho)
There are many variants of those discs, and you might need to find the right one that works with your DC (japanese, european, US...)."
