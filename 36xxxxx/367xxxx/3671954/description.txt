C: The Contra Adventure starts out with a meteor crashing to Earth. Suddenly, the Mayan temple near the crash site is infested with evil aliens planning something sinister for Earth. The elite Contra Force sends Tanya to scout the area and gather intelligence for a possible attack. Unfortunately, Tanya disappears while exploring the area. Only one person has dealt with the aliens before, and only one person can save her: retired Contra Commander Ray. Guide Ray as he uses machine guns, shatter guns, grenades, rockets, and smart bombs in nine levels of alien-killing, tank-busting, UFO-destroying action. Will the commander be able to save Tanya and foil the plans of the aliens? Play C: The Contra Adventure, and find out.
