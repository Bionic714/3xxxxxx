To Queensryche fans, Operation: Mindcrime is the hard-rock equivalent of Pink 

Floyd's The Wall in its ambition, scope, and theatrical pomp. This 1991 filming of 

the band's live presentation of the album is no substitute for its electrifying 

stage show, but as filmed concerts go, it's a pretty good replacement. Visually, 

director Wayne Isham and his editor Jeff Richter do their best to keep up with the 

multimedia production: films, lighting, cued sounds, and dialogue are as important 

to Operation: Livecrime as the music. But enough of the convoluted story comes 

through to allow even the uninitiated to follow it. Musically, the band is in top 

form, especially singer Geoff Tate, who seems to hit notes most rock singers 

didn't even know existed.
