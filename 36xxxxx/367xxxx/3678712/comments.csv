from TOED:
the Install Process! doesnt work correctly, my mistake and unfortunately i did not make a backup before, but you might be able to play it anyway by keep pressing ""Enter"" (when error msg appears!) during the install process, keep pressing the enter button till Install has been finished!
You can play! the game ... the only thing which fucks up are the SFX... pah! ... too bad!
once again sorry!



i have tested this... and after 3523456356 times pressing ""enter"" when msg appears he continues installing!... and worked!.... but no SOUND FX guess they are brokeN!"
