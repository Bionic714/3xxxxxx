Synopsis

It┬┤s the cozy little Boston bar where everybody knows your name... welcome to CHEERS - the Emmy┬« Award-winning, smash-hit television series that kept the laughs uncorked for 11 years. For Season 4, a new face joins the CHEERS regulars as Woodrow Tiberius "Woody" Boyd (played by Woody Harrelson) joins the cast as the watering hole┬┤s new bartender. Another highlight of Season 4 is the first appearance of Dr. Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth) - a character that eventually became a recurring, Emmy┬« winning role. Along with Sam┬┤s bluster, Diane┬┤s neuroses, Carla┬┤s ire and Cliff and Norm┬┤s various schemes, it┬┤s another classic, hilarious season of CHEERS - with all 26 episodes of the unforgettable TV sitcom presented in this 4-disc set..
