,phoem,2007-05-04T11:57Z,"First of all: Tkans a lot Mr_Fear!!!

To MacGyverNL:
1. DS9 S6D3: Get it from Mininova. It's the same tracker, maybe it's copied from TPB.
2. DS9 S5D7: The same situation as you and many others: 98.1% (80 Megs) :("
,phoem,2007-05-04T15:15Z,"To MacGyver:
You can try something else: Find DS9 torrent with all episodes in ratDVD format. If you have Azureus you can select wich file you want to dld, so you can dld only those two episodes. Then get ratDVD software (free) and convert those two files to DVDs. I tried with S5D7, it worked but I'm not satisfied about quality, sound AC3 2ch and only english subs"
,kenny999,2007-05-05T23:31Z,"First of all - Mr_Fear thanks for all the time you spent by spreading Star Trek around. I am one of many grateful fans.
And secondly; I do have 100% DS9 S6D3 and I just started seeding. I will keep it up unless there will be at least 2 more seeders. But be patient, my upload speed is very slow."
,kenny999,2007-05-05T23:33Z,"Yeah and thirdly; I am also one of those cursed on DS9 S5D7. Anyone with this disc available, please be kind and help to finish."
