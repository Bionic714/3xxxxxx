,leeaf,2007-04-30T20:38Z,"if you want the hole song in english, you should look at this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cvaF-Sz644 . (The Song on english)"
,Merdre,2007-04-30T22:32Z,"Thanks again, I really appreciate your mixtapes!"
,bluegamba,2007-05-03T08:19Z,"Thanks Shankly, for keeping me up to date. (But how about Feist, Tori Amos and The Field?) The cd's that I make from your torrents are forever in the player! I don't know how you find the time to collect all this. And with excellent taste! Kudos and respect, man."
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-05-04T01:21Z,"Thanks for all the thanks. I wouldn't do the mixtapes unless I knew they were enjoyed :)

Thanks for the help with the S채kert - my man, 'ossieardiles' got me all the lyrics in english - from a Spurs fan to a Liverpool fan :) 

Bluegamba - as for Feist, Tori Amos and The Field - didn't quite make the grade - according to my taste at least. Have only heard one track by the Field (but have the album now), didn't really connect with the new Tori Amos stuff, but have enjoyed the new Feist album and might put some of theirs on in the future. 

Hope you'll all be supporting Liverpool on May 23rd :)"
