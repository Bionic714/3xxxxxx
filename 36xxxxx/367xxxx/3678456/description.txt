Dennis Lee - Free Energy - Dennis shows various products including his electric motor resonance optimizer (back-emf saver)

Dennis Lee - Free Energy Demonstration: he starts out by running an engine with a novel carburator on gas and water.

I built one, and it works great until the gas and water mix good...

then it stalls (also explosion hazard). He does have some interesting products though...


I think everybody should buy one of his things, and report on whether they work or not.



I think this video is even better:
