Well, yeah... this is a brilliant idea as usual....

Armin.Only.The.Next.Level.2006.2DiSC.PAL.CUSTOM.MDVDR-NAH

This is a CUSTOM _NON_ Scene release (so please stop bitchin) of
Armin Only in Ahoy Rotterdam 2006 event. Not 2005. 2006!

Reason for this CUSTOM MDVDR is CopyCat's release has alot of
trouble playing in both my computer and my stand alone DVD-
player. So this is the result of an reencode of an XVID 
DVDRip (yeah, I totaly agree its lame).
QDR isn't 2006 years event... and DELERIUM's release was a
complete mess up... so none of these three releases doesnt
work as they should. 

But still. Use it if you like it. If you dont, I DONT CARE! =)
