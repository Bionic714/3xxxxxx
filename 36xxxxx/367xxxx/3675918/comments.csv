,Triggerlol,2008-12-02T01:49Z,So how would I go about decoding this with the proper tags using xACT (Mac)?
,jonxjquee,2009-02-13T23:35Z,"dude i appreciate the commitment to lossless audio but you do realize an iso file is so much better... they can mount it and convert it to they're prefered format with internet the tags come automatically, or they can burn it to a disc but flac for audio is more popular than iso's and i don't know why"
