,matothett,2007-10-11T17:44Z,how do i burn this.  it keeps saying that the file is to big.  please help
,robertjose08,2008-02-02T08:02Z,I finished downloading this. Burned it using a dual layer dvd+r. Put it on my stand-alone dvd-audio player but the burned copy won't play the dvd-audio portion of the disc. Anyone have similar problems playing the MLP tracks?
,spngbob,2008-02-14T22:35Z,"This is seriously worth waiting for. I would have converted my car stereo to 5 channel just to hear this!!

Get an alpine with a center speaker and a 5 channel amp. Trust me, everyone is impressed. SEriously badass DVD!! I cannot wait for more artists to do this, only other okay 5.1 Iv found (in stores) is Chevelle.."
,Gabrief,2008-05-05T16:44Z,"DVD-Audio part is broken. Only DVD-Video is playable. 

I DL'd it for the DVD-A part, so to me was definitely not worth. 

Now it's up to you!"
,lukas9875,2008-09-01T21:09Z,how the hell do u put that on dvd ? its to big 
,Lusikov,2010-03-03T03:48Z,workz fine.
,frXNtier,2010-04-25T14:33Z,"@Gabrief: How is it broken? does it just not play in a DVD-Audio compatible player? If its broken there's no point me going to get a DL disc to burn it to.... (and the DVD-Video portion is 5.1 but it's all compressed and shit, so there's no point if the DVD-A part is corrupted or whatever)."
,obi_tpb,2010-10-23T01:05Z,"Yeah. The DVD-Audio part is licensed, and can't play without buying license from internet. DVD-Video part is OK."
,heroxXx,2010-12-05T18:51Z,"THIS IS THE MOST CREATIVE AND MOST INCREDIBLE DVD-AUDIO I'VE EVER SEEN, I WISH LINKIN PARK AND ALL OTHER ARTISTS MAKE THEIR RECORDS LIKE THIS FORMAT; 5.1 SURROUND SOUND WITH MAXIMUM QUALITY (AC3 5.1 CHANNELS WITH 48 KHz AND 448 Kbps, WOW!!), ALL LINKIN PARK FANS MUST HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE DVD, THANKS Infotek, IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THIS FORMAT PLEASE UPLOAD IT :)"
