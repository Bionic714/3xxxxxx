Such as: You can kill a horse by hitting the ""sprint"" key simultaneously (wtf im not english xD); at the first missions when you need to kill wolves the wolves move, but don't run so they're like statues that have wheels xD and much more xD Anyway... THANKS! :D ;D"
,Reinkaos,2008-03-23T19:28Z,"why i can't get any further than mission: Escape the jail. when i go to speak Port he says ""if were blablabla that debuty gotta die"" and he doesn't say nothing more. and that guard doesn't come close to bars(i watched the escape the prison mission from youtube.) but why that game doesn't go further than that????!!!!! could somebody tell me what's the problem."

To bad the game is so short dough..."
,kummi90,2008-09-28T19:33Z,"BLOODY HELL IM PISSED!!! I just spent many hours playing, i was after killing the mean guy in EMire, and off to Dodge, when the game lagged itself to hell and had to ""terminate"" i entered the game again, and i had to start over again!! i was like FUCK THAT!!!. Good game and torrent, but remember to

SAVE THE GAME!!!"
,boozemonster616,2008-11-08T18:03Z,"the cutscene crash has nothing to do with the torrent, it is a bug that was never fixed, there is a way around it though..

save the game before the mission starts (pre cut scene) then do nothing for around a hour or do all the side missions. for some reason it wont crash after that, dont know why. 
someone said 20mins was a long enough time, but i left it on while i went to the pub and when i got back it worked.

there is no patch to help this problem, to my knowledge this is the only way around it."

,AFAIK_im_cool,2009-01-16T19:23Z,"for the last boss,throw some dinamite or use the loco dinamite bow to throw it on the sulphur patches(grey geyser things on the ground)your timing must  be correct and it needs to explode near magruder's legs,after that magruder is on a rock thingy.shoot him in the head and then use yer quickdraw to shoot the bundled dinamite he throws.after some dinamite shooting the dinamite an amusing cutscene will appear witch I won't reveal because of spoilers.congrats,youve finished the story"
