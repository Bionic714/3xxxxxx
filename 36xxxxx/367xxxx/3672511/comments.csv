Try watching the movie you downloaded with the last torrent though. I know the download didn't complete 100% but the file should work ok."

found this machine translation for ENGLISH subtitles for this film. may be of some use to someone."
,brunosc,2007-04-27T14:32Z,"Great! Thank you very much for that: I hope this will help push people to download a little bit of Rouch.

And by the way; the link to the movie speedx008 looks quite interesting (a documentary about Rouch), but it is not the movie in this torrent.

Thank you! "

,brunosc,2007-05-04T19:22Z,"I'm sorry, I've been out of town for a few days and I am having problems with my DSL.
There is no problem with the seed. Besides, I am not the only one, there are 4 other seeders. I have seeded 1.5GBs so far, so maybe the problem is with you.

If you can't download properly then don't make any comments."
