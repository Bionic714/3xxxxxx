IMDb......: http://imdblight.com/id/aGsSenhyMgdifXQE-Illegal_Aliens
Genres...: Comedy, Sci
Year.....: 2007
Plot.....: ""Charlie's Angels"" goes sci-fi, with a touch of ""Men In Black"" thrown in for good measure, when three aliens morph into super-hot babes and arrive to protect the earth from the intergalactic forces of evil. Guided by Syntax, their holographic mentor, these Illegal Aliens are willing to use every trick in the book and every sexy outfit in their wardrobe to accomplish their mission! This film is filled with high-energy action, lowbrow spoofs and the high-camp acting reminiscent of the classic B-Movie genre how else could this film get away with Anna Nicole Smith saving the world? ""Illegal Alien's"" pokes fun at today's Hollywood and pays tribute to the so-called ""Bad Movies"" we all love to hate!
Filmed in: USA
Language.: English"

,davidj40,2007-04-28T18:20Z,This has to be one of the worst of the century ! I don't think it was intended to be so bad either ! This movie is one that skips theatre and DVD release and goes straight to torrent.   ;-)
