,sandrew77,2007-04-29T22:15Z,super!!!! thanks
,mudlu,2007-04-30T07:36Z,You have been seeding for 27 hours and we got about 11% so with your 100 hours of seeding we never got to get this film :-(
,gene_Cann,2007-04-30T12:44Z,I will continue to seed this until you have it....
,Mr.Mengele,2007-04-30T13:57Z,Tack/Thanks gene_Cann :)
,noname_maddox,2007-05-06T23:26Z,Next time seed or don't upload anything. It shouldn't take 2 weeks to download something.
,gene_Cann,2007-05-07T02:06Z,I think you need to find out how the torrent world works! I have allready upped over 20GB'S!!!!!!! it will be any of the other 39 leechers who have paused or cancelled uploading. everyone has a small piece of the pie.
,BOMM2,2007-05-09T19:14Z,"Hi gene_Cann: Your software has been seeding tiny pieces - ie a few hundred KBytes - to each recipient. This makes it very difficult for the receivers to complete any piece he needs in order to seed a full 4MB piece to others. My Azureus has discarded about 90MB of unusable data so far. Multiply this by the 70 odd people in the swarm, and you'll find where your missing data has gone.

Please enable Super Seeding in your bittorrent client if possible, or give Azureus a try. I would like to finish and keep this torrent alive, since it is the first time I have seen it with subtitles in my native language."

although, in the details, gene_Cann says there are Greek subs, but i'm afraid, there are not :/

only English for the Hearing Impaired, Chech, Danish, Suomi, Hebrew, Maguar, Icelandic, Nordish, Polish, Portuguese and Swedish.. :(

very innacurate details, Gene.. :("
