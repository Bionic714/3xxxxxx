But until they take hold and a lot of people start seeding, 38.48 GB will take forever to DL."
,knoxy2006,2007-04-26T03:47Z,"pretty please would u folk seed i always seed and now im losing faith in this torrent business p2p will win - im gettin films of bearshare quick than utorrent i have a 8mb line as im next door to my telephone exchange yet i get 5kb a sec - this is no good - if to keep this alive we need programs that hide from people the upload limit!

,Krokkedille,2007-04-26T15:59Z,"I gues you are right, nobody cares, but for them self! they donÂ´t want to give, just want to have!"
,Krokkedille,2007-04-26T16:02Z,"By the way, looks like a great film (quality) the sound must be out of this wold"
,Magmaman,2007-04-29T14:39Z,"This one doesn't play for me. I get only still pictures when playing it using Power DVD. Suggestions anyone? Downloaded it a couple of weeks ago with the same result. This is the only one that I can't see. King Kong for example, runs just fine."

,Kurt-Sune1,2007-05-11T08:24Z,"I have downloaded the whole movie and tried VCL Media Player and all three players in FinalCode Player. I get picture in all players (a bit dark compared to other movies) but there in NO sound. All my other downloaded movies have good audio.
Anybody know how to get the audio working on Kingdom of Heaven?"
,hurrafor,2007-05-19T11:28Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
,Kurt-Sune1,2007-05-20T10:25Z,"THANKYOU ""hurrafor"" for info!
Now I get HDTV CHINA movies working in FinalCode Player. 

Many THANKYOUs to HDTV CHINA for his great work. KEEP IT UP!

Now I have to get more HDDs to my 800 GB HTPC to fit all movies."
,kasmi,2007-05-23T20:48Z,My God!!! Are you crazy? For 3 movies like this I need another 1 hard disk and another 3 years of my life!
,elefantpik,2008-06-17T11:15Z,Please seed ppl ! This is the greatest film of all times and i so want to watch it in this QltY ! Love u all ! 
,kokousic,2008-08-21T23:30Z,Is this comparable to a blueray disc?
,Barbarossa_1985,2009-02-23T16:43Z,"okay guys...This worked for me :)

I have the older version of MKplayer 2.9.3.1339
I downloaded and instaled hddvd pump from 
http://www.dvbportal.de/projects/hdtvpump/

Now the player would play this video file perfect :)

for some reason the newest KMplayer would not give me a picture...only the sound. "
