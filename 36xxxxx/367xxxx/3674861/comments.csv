,melx,2007-04-29T17:09Z,"Ja, tyvärr är det de..  Men det kanske finns bättre subs någonstans? "
,Iceman87,2007-04-30T11:34Z,"Har letat på alla möjliga sidor..alla engelska subbar verkar vara ""rakt"" översatta från nån fransk..grammatiken är helt fel.."
,Bjurran,2007-05-01T12:11Z,"For all of you who don't speak Swedish... The english subs is just a joke.... The translation is just too bad, so you'll have to wait until there are other subs available.

If you understand French, go for it, as you don't need the subs anyway...

And btw, even if I haven't watched it all yet, it seems to be great video quality"
