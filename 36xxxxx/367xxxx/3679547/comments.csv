,MxLuvr,2007-06-03T18:46Z,"Is a double layer dvd require to burn this? How could you still burn using a normal 4.7gig dvd?

Been dowloading this file for nearly 2 weeks and I'm under 50% done. Lot's of seeds and peers but very very slow. Set aside a month to be on the safe side."
,korpblitz,2007-06-04T12:45Z,"Thank you for this great upload, good speed from Denmark too, about 700kb/s :) Thank you Denmarker"
,MxLuvr,2007-06-05T02:58Z,"Really? Damn, lucky you. In north america with cable I can only get 40k/s and often down to 1k/s with this file.
But yeah, indeed a super upload. I only wish I could stick around to get all of it.

Can someone please reply to my question regarding burning this to a single layer dvd?"
,_j0n_,2007-09-10T07:41Z,"dual layer DVD needed. yes, you will have to spend the extra cash on a DL DVD"
,atlasthomeagain,2007-09-17T17:11Z,"Hi, is this still available (new here) I notice that I have 
38.100.xx.xxx.xxxxx which was meant to be blocked on another torrent of The Wall should I do that? I have already been downloading for 11 hours and 2days+ remaining  will it be corrupted?
Confused
 Thanks."
