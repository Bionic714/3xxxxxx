,populous,2007-12-29T08:08Z,"Samae problem, missing screen/charset.bmp

I made a bogus screen/charset.bmp and the error message changed slightly but the game still won't start. any advice?"
,cmorgan256,2008-02-01T12:36Z,"To populus & TheElholn:
You are probably using WinXP. Download the 1.08 patch from the official site (http://www.digitalreality.hu/index.php?process=select_game&item=3). That should solve your problem. For addition, with this patch you won't need to crack the game to use with ImageDrive."
,Actaaa,2008-06-07T19:26Z,"cmorgan256 is right. You need the patch, and if it doesn't solve the problem there is an another non-offical patch 1.14 for the recent hardwares.

This image don't need any crack because it's the first copy of the original disk.

gamersfun: if you downloaded them and also the instal disk (search in my torents if not) you have to mount them in DaemonTools or Alcohol (or other program like these) or if you want you can burn them to cd by nero."
