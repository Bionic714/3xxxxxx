,t1da1,2007-05-25T01:13Z,Yes it's in english. You'll need ffdshow to view the files though. the klite codec pack has everything you need.
,BloodLogic,2008-03-05T22:37Z,"Actually, you don't need to download any of that codec crap to play these videos on your computer. All you need is VLC Player, which has the most popular codecs all properly auto-installed in the player. No need to hunt down random shit after examining your ""acquired media"" with Gspot or some other codec-detection software. VLC Player is also 100% completely free (no trials, no shareware, no 30-month test only, no ""super-improved executive version"" -- it's free now and it'll be free in 100 years). Videolan.org -- programmed by rebel French students (yes, just like the ones that overthrew the French state in the 60's). And yes, this is an English torrent, as noted above in the torrent description.

If you want to download any of my other material, by all means, check it out. I highly recommend Cheap Seats, Baby Blues, O'Grady, and Crossballs, all uploaded in complete season torrents, among at least 40 other television shows that have been uploaded in complete collections. Enjoy the viewing!

,damianleiy,2008-05-22T21:50Z,Actually this isn't Adult Swin before it was on AdultSwim is was on Fox Kids
,LadyAmbar,2008-05-24T07:36Z,"I'm still surprised this was on fox kids, obviously this show is not for kids.  Let's do the ass dance!"
,freaker104,2008-08-24T17:32Z,"First of all: BIG thanks to BloodLogic for such good quality movies cause shin-chan is rare in english and above all Adultswim versions of good quality.
Second: When can we expect the second season, ...?
Looking forward to it!"
,Beatsta,2009-01-01T02:16Z,"LadyAmbar: Shin-Chan was dubbed by a different cast then the adult swim cast. The script was significantly different, compared to the adult swim one."
[T],cesarth,2009-03-09T23:18Z,Thanks bloodlogic for a very good show!
[V],Katkwaraye,2009-05-01T06:02Z,Thanks dude.
