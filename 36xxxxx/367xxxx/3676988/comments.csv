,lamon01,2007-05-02T08:02Z,"Anyone else but me who is unable to unrar this file?
Seems that there some problem when processing the .rar file. (autentification or bad CRC). Have retried the download, with same problem. Any suggestions? "
,N537JB,2007-05-02T09:29Z,"What application are you using when trying to extract it? Read this, as I wrote in another torrent-comment:

If you use WINRAR then just extract N53-CIT.RAR! Shouldn't be harder than that. And if you don't have WinRAR, go and get it @ hxxp://www.rarlab.com ! Enjoy ;-)

If it's STILL not working, rename n53-cit.rar to n53-cit.part1.rar and n53-cit.r00 to n53-cit.part2.rar and so on!"
,lamon01,2007-05-02T12:56Z,"Thanks a lot!
I renamed the files, part1, part2 and so on.
Using WinRar. Still got some error msg but the unrared exe worked ok.
Every day you learn something new!!!
Thanks again."
,tpbfsx,2007-05-02T14:12Z,"Hello everybody!

First of all I want to thank everyone who are seeding ""our"" torrents! TPB is the best! BUT! I've got some questions... And I already aksed many people to answer me but no reactions so far.. 
- Where can I find Fly Tampa's St. Maarten for FSX?? Because I heard the one on TPB doesn't work..
- Also I tried to install the 757 blocks from TBP but this doesnt work for me.. I've got FSX and it keeps getting errors when I try to install the blocks.. (I used just some codes for the serials..) Can somebody tell me why it doesn't install or is this torrent just crap??

I WANT ST. MAARTEN SOO BADDD!! XD 

THANK YOU ALL!!"
,Zetlander,2007-05-10T02:16Z,"Thanks for the share. There is a problem with unraring the files but all you need to do is browse to the 2nd part when it says it can't find it... all continues OK after that. BTW, the Wilco site says there is a known problem with running this plane on Vista... they are working on a fix."
,dbuster,2007-05-28T15:00Z,Thanks a lot.
