,omikias,2008-02-06T18:23Z,"Please do seed! I've been looking for this game for awhile, as I've got the sequel. "
,omikias,2008-02-12T02:42Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION! IT IS FRENCH/ITALIAN ONLY! There are NO ENGLISH options available with this version. Sorry folks, freshly tested. "
,ChrisPCD,2008-02-29T12:46Z,"Would someone please seed this?  I, and from what  I can tell a handful of others, have been stuck at 95.8% for more than a couple days.  I'm dying to try it out.

Thanks for the up."
