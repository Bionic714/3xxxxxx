i myself have a problem when i launch the game.. ""an error has occured blablabla"" as for many others who has the same stupid problem.
I've tried a bunch of cracks that are available now but none work..

Hopefully when the game launches tomorrow more cracks will be up after a couple of days maybe. This just blows.

,spykar,2007-05-04T14:04Z,"Yup WhiteIce89.. i found out last night on demonoid that you have to disable the human interface thing.

1. Click on start button and right click on ""my computer"". Choose ""properties""

2. Click on the hardware tab and then ""device manager""

3. There should be a tab called ""devices for human interface ( or something like that).
Right click on HID-compatible device and disable.
There may be more than one HID-devices, you just have to check wich one is the right one!.

NOTE: This may not work for everyone and if  you have any game controllers (gamepads, steering wheels & etc) attached to your PC, un-plug it first before starting the game, then you may not have to do the steps mentioned."
