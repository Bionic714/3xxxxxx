A play based on interviews with people involved in terrorism around the globe,
 and those seeking to counter it. The writer, director and actors involved

Reviews from the national tour 
'sensitively and intelligently provocative.' Daily Mail
'involving throughout with a first rate cast.' The Observer
'Robin Soans's powerful and probing piece of theatre expertly selects, cuts 
and interweaves the verbatim accounts from former terrorists, their victims 
and the politicians who attempt to negotiate with them.' Mail on Sunday
'Max Stafford-Clark draws fantastic performances from his outstanding company. 
 The result gives a platform to voices either never heard before or heard only as gunfire or tears.
  It opens your eyes and alters your attitude.' Mail on Sunday
'an arresting piece of work.' Independent
'Max Stafford-Clark's Out of Joint company, previously acclaimed for The Permanent Way,
 has produced another superb investigative docudrama (in conjunction with the Royal court).
 Talking to Terrorists has been deftly woven together by Robin Soans using interviews 
with militant resistance fighters and people they've targeted, with ministers, diplomats,
 an army expert, a psychologist and everyday folk from London, Belfast, Uganda, Turkey and the Middle East.'
 Independent
'I will be astonished if the year turns up a more important, illuminating or moving play then this.' Daily Telegraph
'Soans seamlessly interweaves the testimonies, creating a flow of evidence and graphic details that has you hanging 
on to every word...
 Yes, surprisingly, the play isn't entirely depressing.  We hear of great courage here, as well as great suffering, 
of triumphs of the human spiritas well as its collapse into barbarism...
The eight actors are flawless, playing up to five parts apiece with great versatility, 
and resolutely refusing to milk the traumatic material for easy pathos.  
It is all the more moving as a result, but this is in every respect, a truly remarkable piece of theatre.' Daily Telegrap

'It sheds light on a dark subject. It forces us to think about what actually constitutes "terrorism".
 It shows that people acquire a strange eloquence when talking about subjects close to their hearts. 
 It also proves that edited memories can achieve the potency of art.'The Guardian
