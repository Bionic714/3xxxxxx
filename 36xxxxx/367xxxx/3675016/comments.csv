,Dr. Frikadel,2007-04-28T16:02Z,"Damn...just noticed: Downloaded 11 times already without anyone saying ""thank you"".  These spineless people are a bunch of weed smoking self centered smacktards who really need to get a reality check, or keep it simple ..They just need a big dick in there tiny weeny holes and than hang 'm with help of a violin string..

Thanks,
Doc."
,rrodger99,2007-04-28T19:05Z,"LOL Doc...tell us how you really feel. Don't hold back any.

Haven't dnloaded it yet as I am hunting my basics back down after a raid controller melt down but thanks for when I do."
,neslesman,2007-04-28T19:52Z,"The scenery is great for screenshots.  If you've got a slow computer be sure to pay attention to the install options, this scenery can really drag down the performance.
And for all the silent leechers.......you're welcome.  It already made it's way to Wingz but at least credit was given."

,rrodger99,2007-04-29T16:09Z,"Not quite dead yet...just on life support.

When the controller went it killed everything I had for FS2004 which sucked...but at least I have plenty of space on my drives now.

Of course the question will be asked ""Why didn't you back it up? All I have to say is give me a good cost effective way (read that cheap) way to back up 600gb."
