Highly recommended."
,Jeff1961,2007-05-22T15:42Z,"This is an excellent documentary.
But it won't play in any of my media players except VLC.
If you experience this problem, get VLC for free at www.videolan.org
It is a small reliable program."
,Jpdeveau,2008-08-26T20:37Z,"Get KMPlayer.
It plays anything."

This is a big story. It's an attempt by the Illuminati, working through their number one propaganda production factory, the Tavistock Institute in the City of London, to create the illusion that the world is rapidly running out of oil and within a few short years, we will experience unemployemnt, wars, famine, and all manner of horrendous strife as a result of the fallout from the now ""rapdily vanishing"" oil supplies. It's a scam from top to bottom. If you've noticed that gasoline prices are beginning to rise at gas pumps across America, you can thank this deception for that jump in gas prices and you can also expect those gasoline prices to continue to rise over time and possibly remain at unprecedented high levels from here on out, UNLESS enough Americans wake up to this deceit and demand an end to it.

There are large numbers of people out there trying to promote this scam through books, articles, lectures, films, television and talk radio. In America, Michael Ruppert of From the Wilderness is apparently the lead disinformation meister of this flimflam. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now is a Ford Foundation & Rockefeller Foundation funded Left Gatekeeper who, with her brother, have joined with Ruppert to not only promote the Peak Oil scam, but is a regular propagandist for the Global Warming hoax fronted by Illuminatus Al Gore.

KPFK radio, a 100,000 kilowatt FM radio station out of Los Angeles, is one of the five national radio outlets owned by the Pacifica Foundation and has been unrelentingly hammering out the Peak Oil and Global Warming propagnada mantras since Ruppert kicked off this Tavistock-hatched disinformation campaing in 2004.

The only two people, that I am aware of, with any sizeable readership who have been trying to expose these outrageous lies and monstrous distortions of the facts are Dave McGowan through his newsletters and Joe Vialls in articles published at this web site. I'll use this page to post articles from writers and researchers who are trying to expose this pretense, starting with Dave McGowan and Joe Vialls. (Update: Jan 21, 2004. Found a good article exposing Ruppert from Patrick Mooney of www.unlearning.org).

,butttfukirr9,2012-03-05T00:20Z,"This knucklehead called Ken Adachi thinks their are mice on a hamster wheel turning our millions of barrels of oil a day to keep the underground aquifers of oil loaded with oil, so that it never runs out.

You don't even have to be a scientist to figure out that peak oil happens, because I was working in Houston in the worlds largest refinery in 1973 when US production peaked. 
We then had to start importing more oil from Saudi Arabia to make up the demand.

How much we use everyday is not rocket science. It's common knowledge. The only people studpid enough to not belive the earth has enough oil to pump to hell freezes over are exactly that. Numskulls.

Ive been in this industry for 40 years and now retired. There is no other energy source in liquid form that can fuel 1 billion autos now on the road, and in everything we use from toothpaste to cosmetics. 

And the earth doesn't have any liquid form of energy we can pull off the shelf that can match 80 million barrels of oil the world uses every day.

 That ought to tell you something. What can match that demand? Peanut butter I suppose?
Ask yourself the most basic question: 

Who benefits the most by you not believing it? Them! Why-because of money-that's the business they're in.

They killed the electric car in 1994 in CA-I had one and had to give it back made by GM.

If you do believe it is there money in that? No only in developing alternative fuels-so which is against that? Oil companies.

 It's as basic as hell. The truth don't cost a dime, but your ignorance will cost you your life and your money-so its obvious."
