This on-rails shooter will provide plenty of excitement for gamers looking for a shooter fix. You have a host of lethal weapons at your disposal including homing missiles, lasers, and cluster bombs. Another unique feature of this game is the fact that you have control of your mech, even though the game is on rails. What this means is that you can dodge incoming fire and missiles or rotate in search of the best shot. Control-wise, a targeting system has been implemented with both manual and automatic lock-on firing, which puts you in complete control. There is also a special gallery section that allows you to check out all the big mechs in the game.
