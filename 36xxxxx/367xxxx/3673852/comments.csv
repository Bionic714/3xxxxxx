Genre...: Comedy
Year.....: 2007
Rating...: 6.2/10 with 1,467 ratings
Plot.....: Mr. Bean enters a church raffle and ""wins"" a vacation trip to France as well as a camcorder when his ticket can be made to resemble the winning number. After boarding a Eurostar train and arriving in Paris, the French language proves a barrier for Bean, as he struggles as a tourist to order a meal or find his train to the south of France. At the Gare de Lyon he meets Emil, a Russian film director on his way to be a judge at the Cannes Film festival. When his continued endeavors with his camcorder accidentally result in Emil being left behind at the station, Bean attempts to cheer up the director's son Stepan as the train continues south. Matters are made more hectic by the fact that Emil has reported his son to have been kidnapped and Bean losing his essential travel documents. Heading in the direction of Cannes, Bean finds himself interacting with other filmmakers including the ""artsy"" director Carson Clay and the young actress Sabine. Events finally lead to a further interaction by Bean and his camcorder with the premiere of Clay's film.

,Snakes621,2007-04-27T23:32Z,"I burned it, watched on my TV and it looks perfect. The sound is not as good as the picture but its still good.

This copy is watchable unless you are a cranky person that needs every single thing perfect. In that case: Wait."

,luke8352,2007-04-28T14:30Z,"Hey, i was only trying to help you out and pre-warn you! i said that picture is good and the sound is only cam but still very watchable. i'm one of the good guys that gives people help and advice instead of swearing all the time and not giving useful info about the torrent! I used the latest version of nero, and the sync was out...next time i won't bother!!! GameGuNotNigger you really are twat though!"
,rowborough,2007-04-28T19:27Z,"Trick there dont use Nero its wank!

Try a proper encoder, and get the latest Codecs and the sync is perfect, dont tell people bogus information about a torrent if its you inability to keep your system up to date that is at fault.

Good torrent and if anyone dosnt  think its funny your from somware other than the u.k so you dont count !!"
