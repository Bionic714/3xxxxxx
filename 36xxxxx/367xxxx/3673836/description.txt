Denis Leary - MTV Unplugged [1993]

A fun episode of MTV Unplugged from back in 1993. 
Songs played include:
"Asshole", "Elvis and I" and "The Kennedys" among others...

The quality is very poor, but since it is made from a old VHS-tape there was no way of improving it.

Format PAL 4:3 DVD (no menus)

If some one have a better copy please upload it!
