,etrain_31,2007-04-28T17:32Z,seed please
,FieroGT42,2007-05-01T04:36Z,"Are you an idiot?  It IS being seeded.  It's still on initial/super seeding due to hit & runs that dropped the initial seed to something like 50% ratio, thanks to the rude and inconsiderate n00bz out there.  If people hadn't been wasting data, it would have been done long ago."
,FieroGT42,2007-05-02T04:16Z,"My ISP is doing network maintenance for at least a few hours tonight so my connection may be down for a while, but I'll resume seeding very soon. It will be done tomorrow."
,SpaceMonkey2000,2007-05-02T14:48Z,looks great! Thanks!

,chuckn16,2008-04-02T05:14Z,"So Fiero, will this mess my PS2 up?
Cause I've tried burning a game before and Sony puts a sensor that reads burnt games, and renders a PS2 usless...all you get is a ""Disc Read Error"". For any game even orginals."
,111andreas,2008-05-09T10:59Z,with 146 b/sec the game will never be downloaded!

This game is really rare, since I traveled to japan with my parents last year and I asked for that game in every store, and they said they didn't have the game. Gotta pray for that download to finish in time. :D"
