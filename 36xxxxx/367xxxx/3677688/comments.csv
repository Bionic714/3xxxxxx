,btpicko,2007-05-01T23:23Z,"It seems not to be 5:1 suround :-/ mplayer says:
AC3: 2.0 (stereo)  48000 Hz  224.0 kbit/s"
,staf,2007-05-02T00:32Z,"It is an R5 source, which means the sound quality is ok but not good. The video quality is however very good."
,masterkimmen,2007-05-02T14:56Z,Seed plz!
,penol738,2007-05-02T18:28Z,"audio sounds like it comes from a CAM, rather poor quality. picture is great thoug. I suggest downloading the Sample first, before taking the whole movie"
,koffbeer,2007-05-02T20:48Z,"Swedish subs? Where? The movie just starts, without any sub-options. How do i fix that?"
,strangelove9,2007-05-03T05:23Z,"Can someone please comment on the quality and give us a FEW DETAILS ABOUT THE AUDIO AND VIDEO? Are they in sync?

Thanks much!"
,hixxy12345,2007-05-03T11:25Z,"picture. 10/10 dvd quality.
sound5/10 very poor. loud and tinny,too high pitched. some kind of subs that pop up for ten mins or so cannot be turned off.all in all...
worth the d/l but not for keeps tho.
if u want to have a keeper,wait for the replica.hope that helps"
,Herman_von_Salza,2007-05-12T21:19Z,"It was exelent.
The picture was perfect, the sound was almost perfect.

And most imortantly the movie was great fun!
I'll recromend this to everyone.
I'll keep on seeding it for a while (200KBs)
And don't fucking complain about the subtitles, just ignore them, if you read them you will miss a lot of puns

Thanks for the up staf"
,rogle_bk,2007-05-16T10:16Z,halmbal1: I have had the same problem before. If you are using an extern HD you should try to extract on the regular HD on the computer. (I'am using WinRar).
,Randomshit,2007-05-23T16:02Z,Why only Swedish sub????????
,Ethra,2007-06-02T21:01Z,"Appreciate it, Staf... good one =)"
