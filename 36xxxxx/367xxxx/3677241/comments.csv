,fitbrit,2007-08-05T07:14Z,"Yeah, my system handles most h.264 files fine, but chokes on this. Tried MPC with 5 fps, PowerDVD 7.3 Ultra, VLC etc. No go."

,xtofermagnus,2008-05-19T22:33Z,dd+ 1536kbps and dts 768kbps what is the best quality?
,Jakethe,2008-06-08T12:55Z,I got it to run with KM Player but with audio file 1 the picture freezes so you have to change it to either 2 or 3 for it to run.. in kmplayer or matroska.
,rasku,2008-07-01T21:19Z,"please       seed when your finished.
i only got 5% in a week. but now its temporarily a lot better.
i dont understand most seem to quit on this one as soon as they have the whole themselfs. if not there would be a bunch of seeders.
file this size needs lot of seeders.
mostly there has benn 0-1 seeder.

bad habits!

,rasku,2008-08-04T23:57Z,"I can only play this with mplayer if everything else is turned off. it was too much with vlc. and vlc can handle an other 1080p. film i have.

i have 3ghz core 2 duo, 3gb ram, geforce 9600.

and the sides of the film is always out of screen. 
seems you must have a screen with the required resolution. but this is not a problem with other videos thats not in h264.

and its hard to find good info on how to play the h264. format.
how do you play the video files alltogether without a playlist pause between them?

,bbutton1,2010-04-02T15:49Z,Have you guys ever heard of BS.Player or VLC player. Works just fine.
