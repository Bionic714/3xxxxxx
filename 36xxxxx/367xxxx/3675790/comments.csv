,MSGuy,2007-05-06T04:50Z,I DL'd Web Premium from the Adobe site and ram setup. I then used the serial this key provided. I then activated DW by phone. DW and ALL the apps activated at the same time. BEAUTIFULL. TX duskom
,hyphen79,2008-01-25T00:32Z,"People. Don't post comments that there are no viruses when you've only scanned it with ONE antivirus app. n00bs.  Go to www.virustotal.com.

If you run this file thru it, it will get at least 4 of the sites returning some nasty results... 2 of them say ""suspicious file/trojan/worm"".. 2 of them say ""Heuristic: Suspicious File With Code Injection Technology"" and ""Virus.Win32.Agent.HGE"". If that doesn't scream, ""Hi.. I'm a file, and I'm hiding a VIRUS in my code.."", then I don't know what does. BEWARE! I don't know why some friggin' idiots feel the need to ruin a perfectly good keygen release by lacing it with malicious code. To you virus writers out there: GET A DAMNED LIFE!"
