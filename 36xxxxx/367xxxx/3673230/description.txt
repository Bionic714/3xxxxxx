           Accelerate web design and development with Adobe
           Fireworks CS3 software, the ideal tool for creating and
           optimizing images for the web and rapidly prototyping
           websites.

           NOTE: Why internal? Well.. First, we're not sure it's a
           real final version, in spite of fact, that we didn't
           found any "beta" or "pre-release" words anywhere.
           Second, it's more than 0day-size limit. Nuke it or
           throw it away if you want - we don't care at all.



           Unzip, unrar, install.
           Use our keygen to generate your own serial.

           NOTE: Yes, we know that normally there is an activation
           and so on, but it seems we found VLK keys or something
           like that, because while our tests, which were made on
           about 10 PCs with different configurations (and
           previous versions installed), this puppy didn't ever
           asked for any activation shit. And, yes, don't even try
           to burn on CD, because seems installer checking it and
           you will not be able to install this puppy.
