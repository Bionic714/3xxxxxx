In a nutshell, this trio was known for two things-performing on the opening night of Howard Cosell's Saturday Night Live, the notorious variety show that premiered the same year as the other Saturday Night Live and doing the song over the opening credits of the original version of "Fun With Dick and Jane", "Ahead Of The Game". That song wasn't on the self titled Arista album, which was their only full length, but was released as a single, which I've included here. They never had a hit and faded into oblivion, but this album has aged extremely well, and sounds fresh thirty years later. (Well, it does to me)
Due to the generic nature of their name, it also makes it very hard to find any information on them. Damn groups like them and The A's for not foreseeing the internet.
Give this one a listen-enjoy and seed!
