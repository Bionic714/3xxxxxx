,himmelstrutz,2007-04-26T13:17Z,"Just listening to it now, and it's actually really good! As you say, it has aged quite well. Anyone who likes well-composed pop should give it a listen."
,DashRiprock,2008-12-21T04:01Z,I've been stuck at 98% for months now.  Please reseed and I'll seed for a few months.  I used to have this album and I want it back.
,baskingshark,2008-12-24T02:32Z,I'm stuck at 98% too- pleez can you re-seed?! I'll happily seed it too!
,qazwxed,2009-04-14T05:47Z,I'm also stuck at 98%. If someone please seeds I'll seed forever.
,markerb,2010-12-20T23:02Z,"It's been stuck at 98.2% for years now, but I'm not giving up just yet.  A dead torrent will occasionally jump back to life.

All hail ""workjobb,"" and her/his triumphant return!"
