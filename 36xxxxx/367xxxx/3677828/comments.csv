,Jultec,2008-10-15T20:23Z,thanks!
,Jultec,2008-10-15T20:29Z,"Game itself is working fine, but when we try to play on LAN, we can't find each other :/

The Steamversion worked fine, except this giveaway (nvideo/ati ""special"") version doesn't allow the installation of mods.
I hoped to be able to install the HL2DM PRO mod on this torrent, but the installation doesn't create the Steam/SourceMods directory since it is nonsteam!?!

Well I think its time to buy that game (about 5dollars at steampowered dotcom)!

I really love the Half Life atmosphere and gameplay!! Played it on LAN, we had a blast!"
