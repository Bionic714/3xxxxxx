,liondale,2007-05-01T16:39Z,"Please help.
I am having problems viewing these episodes. I have dl'ed from episode 8 and until now. 
But the video is very choppy, both when I try to view locally and burn to DVD and watch on standard DVD. Seconds are skipped and pic distorted. 
Tried PowerDVD, VLC and some others...

Please help with any tips!

Thanks in advance!"
,nette82,2007-05-01T16:52Z,"Hi, can you burn more than one episode on a dvd? Don't wanna use a full DVD for just one episode under 800mb.. Great quality by the way :)"
,liondale,2007-05-01T17:35Z,"hi, in case someone wants to help me. My problem with playing the files is only with episodes 8 and 9! Episodes after that work fine, episodes before that I haven't tried cause I saw them on tv.
Someone please help! "
