Time to get the Led out.

For Led Zeppelin fanatics, this 1976 feature The Song Remains the Same is a treasure of searing live performances, particularly welcome in light of the sad scarcity of such visual material from the bands great decade. Despite the group's road weariness after a long tour, their final, three-night stand at Madison Square Garden in 1973 was full of the old power. Performances of No Quarter, Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog, Dazed and Confused, and "Stairway to Heaven" underscore Zep's charisma. Trouble is, you dont get an unbroken performance here. Viewers have to wade through a mishmash of documentary insight into the lives of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Bonham, and John Paul Jones, as well as fantasy sequences supposedly inspired by the thoughts and fantasies of the bands individual members. It's mostly garish and silly, but there are some nice elements, especially insights into the late Bonham's life
