This is a helpful little program for converting video files from google (the site is video.google.com). When you download a video file from there , the files are in gvi format. This program converts them to avi and from where can be converted to all formats with other programs.
NOTE :The part with the keygen is nessary because the program is only a trial version and after 22 days expires , but this code it unlocks it and is usable even after the trial period expires.If you plan using it less than 22 day this part is not necessary.
