Plot.....: More than 10 years after 'Terminator 2', John Connor now exists only as a drifter - living 'off the grid', so no more Terminators from the future can hunt him down. Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful & advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems & is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers & leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?

,download2029,2008-07-12T16:41Z,"INSANE_ORACLE, the description already gives away what kind of movie this is. This is Terminator 3, but then tweaked and changed in order to improve the movie. Some deleted scenes and snippets have been added, some other scenes have been cut or changed."
,messymutty,2009-01-11T22:04Z,"oh, please... I've been painfully downloading this bit for bit since 4th of December 2008. Now I am on 99.7% - and then the last Seeder goes away :(

Please, anyone, seed this for just a few more days and I'll keep seeding until the end of TBP as long as I can get it to 100% first :)"
