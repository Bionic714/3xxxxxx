,marcosmyara,2007-04-30T09:35Z,"do we have to discuss this everytime a family guy episode is posted?

just have to ask, is it just me or is family guy not as funny as it used to be? i see the animation quality getting way better, i dont know about the jokes.. and it just seems more previsible than before..

btw thanks for the torrent! ill keep downloading them anyway =D"
,avatar2012,2007-04-30T10:34Z,"Yes - thanks for the torrent kopimi!

I thought the last 3 eps were quite good, although this one was kind of flattish. More animated humour!"
,theboos,2007-04-30T13:42Z,yees a new one
,torsktrynet,2007-04-30T15:40Z,"Ah, finally :D"
,qnewt,2007-04-30T16:23Z,"ok i guess its time for the weekly ""this is not season 5"" debate.."
,Marbh,2007-05-01T12:25Z,"If it's of any interest to you guys, over here in Europe the Seasons have been released differently on DVD and our Season six started on the same episode as it is listed here!

Strange but true!"

,EzRaEl,2007-06-19T18:48Z,"Season 6 doesn't start until Sept 2007, if you're going to upload Family Guy do some fuckn research! 
Season 6: 2007-2008
Season 5 has 19 episodes. Making this episode 15: Boys Do Cry - The Griffins flee to Texas after Stewie gets sick off the Communion wine and everyone in the congregation suspects he's possessed. "

Cause you dont have the right codec.."
,DOTOCM1,2008-02-13T18:17Z,"fox have realy fucked you all up 
uk version & usa version are all mixed up for this reason to try and stop people downloading .you  are better of just goto
here and you can watch them & as soon as the new ones are aired you can get them to mail you 

so far all family guy episodes are there even the movie & half of season 6

you need firefox to download and realplayer

,yannik27,2008-02-27T20:33Z,"regarding which season this is:

in the uk (and i think all europe) season 4 was split into two halves, making the second half of season 4 into season 5, making UK one season ahead, the 'fact' is that this is both season 6 and 5 depending where u are.
to all UK ppl i recommend looking for what u want one season behind as most torrents are US based"
,SoundWall,2008-03-11T11:01Z,"According to IMDB the latest episode is 6x10, so obviously this is not season 6.

If you disagree with this then please take it up with the IMDB staff, or simply label the episodes according to their index like a sane person."
,natanaelcd,2008-03-21T09:17Z,FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Caspers_Ghost,2009-09-20T15:40Z,"(((Shakes Head)))
Personally, no matter what the Season Number is, as long as they (As Numbered) belong to the same season & NOT Mismatched with Other Seasons (AND) We are going to get them all, it seems irrelevant to Bitch & Whine when we still have access to them. If it's that important, we can rename them once downloaded to suit ourselves.  
Seems too many people don't appreciate the few things that are still relatively free...
(Less Our Monthly ISP Payments of course)

Sheesh!  (((Shakes Head Again)))
We should be glad we can even get this stuff!

Oh! One More Thing...
natanaelcd, people like you and your FAKE!!!! comments on everyones uploads only exposes your mentality and I.Q. and should be Banned! 
 There isn't a damn thing wrong with this File!!!

Thank You Kopimi!!!"
