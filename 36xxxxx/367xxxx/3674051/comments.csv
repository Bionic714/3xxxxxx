,noos,2008-02-10T00:25Z,"I dunno, crack seems to work for me....if running Vista, be sure you always r-click on .exe files and chose ""run as administrator.""  Even for cracks and keygens. "
,exeoh,2008-04-10T11:11Z,"Thanks for this. With mrdunc's serial, it works great."
,optrirominiluikus,2008-04-19T22:07Z,"Installed, cracked, activated a few fonts. Shut down the program for a couple of minutes, and now it crashes on startup. Damn."
,optrirominiluikus,2008-04-20T00:18Z,"Then again, it works if you use the serial."
,jessejericho,2008-05-29T20:27Z,"AVG found malware in the crack.

Instead, download the 30-Day trial from Extensis, and use the following key:

SWYE-1102-BOAA-LPSG-DSST-RFGD"
,distill,2008-09-01T10:52Z,"This software (version 11.0.1.52 from Extensis website) is very buggy. Fonts are ""disappearing"" after each reboot and so on. Screwed up my Windows quite badly. Not recommended. (Too bad! I have to find a replacement for this software now.)"
,distill,2008-09-01T11:40Z,So better alternatives are (or ones worth checking out): Proxima FontExpert and High-Logic MainType. Maybe Blacksun X-Fonter is possible too.
,sweetsurr,2008-10-05T00:46Z,"AVG found a threat not sure if it is or not, didnt install. even if it isnt the serial number fine.  SWYE-1102-BOAA-LPSG-DSST-RFGD
THANKS to ""jessejerico"" below."
,juanmiglesias,2009-03-25T23:59Z,"I didnt find any problem with the crack, just installed, rescaned and seems fine.
i used: eset nod32 business ed. 3.0.669.0 updated, also Malwarebytes anti-malware 1.34 updated too. "
,azatek,2009-07-19T18:49Z,"Scanned with original Kasperky and its clean..
mrdunc's serial works, didnt bother trying the crack.

Clean install and for what I installed, till now its the best font manager torrent for windows. (the Mac ones are way better but ok dont have one @ home)

Thx for good working font managing torrent, I searched my ass off to find one!"
