Synopsis: In a small woodsy Oregon town, a group of friends -sensitive Gordie, tough guy Chris, flamboyant Teddy and scaredy-cat Vern- are in search of a missing teenager?s body. Wanting to be heros 
in each other?s and their hometown?s eyes, they set out on an unforgettable two-day trek that turns into an odyssey of self-discovery. They sneak smokes, tell tall tales, cuss ?cause it?s cool and band together when the going gets tough. When they encounter the town?s knife-welding hoods who are also after the body, the boys discover a strength they never knew they had. STAND BY ME is a rare and special film about friendship and the indelible experiences of growing up. Filled with humor and suspense, it is based on the novella ?The Body? by Stephen King.
