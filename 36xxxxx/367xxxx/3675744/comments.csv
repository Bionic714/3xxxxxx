,ArtemisGoldfish,2007-04-29T04:23Z,"No problem, just wanted to share the magic of this hard-to-find game with everyone."
,7r4c3r,2007-04-29T23:35Z,Why is that old guy telling me there is no CD???
,MTField,2007-04-30T15:14Z,Same problem. Can't find a crack in the ISO and mounting with Daemon Tools does nothing. Anyone know where to get a crack for this?
,ArtemisGoldfish,2007-04-30T23:14Z,A crack??? What version of DAEMON Tools are you using? Revert to DT 3.47 if you're using a newer version.
,MTField,2007-05-04T15:07Z,"Reverted to DT v3.47 and no luck getting past the ""no CD Lego animation"". Cheers for the up anyway."

,Oblivion101,2008-03-20T02:12Z,Please....can someone upload a torrent for Lego Island 2: The Bricksters Revenge?
,leosl,2008-05-18T15:54Z,can someone tell me where i can download lego island 2 ?
,RickJMan,2008-06-13T12:24Z,to get past the old guy saying put in the cd you have to download winrar and open the rar then open the iso inside the rar extract all of the files to your desktop then you just burn the files (make sure it is all of them or it won't work) to a blank cd. now all you do is put the cd in the drive and install it and play it
,JJOR64,2008-06-21T08:54Z,Has anyone got this game to work on Vista?
,noskar,2009-06-12T15:06Z,"Thet game is cool!

          New I have got lego island 1 and 2!!!!"
,gabray,2010-04-27T01:59Z,The torrent work with Vista. The only thing to do in order to make it work is to 1. copy the crack files which are located in the 'DATA/disk' directory and 2. copy the d3drm.dll file which is located in 'redist/directx' into the main folder of lego island on your hard drive. There may be some more errors to fixe in order to make it work but it seems like i'm in the good way to make it work. It's an awesome game from my child age please comment if you got more solutions...
,PSPImages,2010-07-03T16:24Z,it works when using Virtual CloneDrive
,Iceytendo,2010-08-07T03:24Z,"I just extracted the iso with universal extractor and ran the installer and then ran the game. The only problem is the quit the game is screwed up. When he says ""green go, red stay"" it keep starting over and if I select any of the bricks the game crashes. I use Vista."
,xmodkid,2010-08-07T18:32Z,"BOOOOO THIS A VIRUS THANKS U FUCKIN DICK, NOW MY COMPUTER RESTARTS EVERY MIN BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS U PUT IN THIS DOWNLOAD, I DONT KNOW HOW THE OTHER PEOPLE ARENT HAVING PROBLEMS, BUT YOUR A DICK JUST TO LET YOU NOW."
,xmodkid,2010-08-07T18:46Z,"Just to let you know i have connections with the police and I will find you, SUE you, unless u tell me how to fix this problem!"
,Iceytendo,2010-08-09T08:41Z,"Yaho! I found my copy of the game, which means I don't need the torrent version!"
,Iceytendo,2010-08-09T08:44Z,"@xmodkid, are you absolutely sure the virus came from this? I downloaded it last week and I had no problem. Did you get anything else the same day?

Also, one time my bro had virus and it didn't act up until a few weeks or maybe a month after."
,the_big_fame,2010-09-06T09:37Z,i did what gabray said but the no cd message still appears...
,tanders2010,2010-11-29T21:05Z,"Big Problem - I can get the game to run easily on vista by doing either what RickJman and Gabray said, but once the game is up and running, you can't click on anything outside of the information center. You can't enter any buildings/anything that requires clicking when outside. I would love you forever if you provided me with a solution..."

,garrenn,2011-05-05T16:40Z,"Alright I'm confused. People keep talking about the data/disk crack thing, but that didn't come with the download. All I got was the iso. I downloaded the game with daemon tools for my Windows 7 laptop, but after installing the game, absolutely nothing happens when I try to play it."
,TheoKTelocMaroulas,2011-07-01T21:58Z,Turk Mesagi Seni Seniyorum Lego Island The Fast Way To Eat Pizza Is At Island
,Dufox,2011-12-14T09:54Z,"the folder name is confusing :D

to clear it up. mount the iso
after you mount it dont hit auto install, click open folder to view files.
install it but dont exit the folder.
top left is a folder called data. open it. now you see a folder called disk. open it. copy all files to the install path. (C:programfiles/LEGOisland) by default

using a folder called data as the folder you stored the crack into was a cruel joke :D should be the crackers name or CRACK. something that stands out.

i bought this game when it came out but my computer sucked to bad to play it lol :D 

anywho nice upload saying copy data/disk in the iso folder to install path instead of Lego Island! would have made it an epic upload :D"
,djkwal,2012-01-27T18:27Z,Having the same problem as tanders2010. I can't see the buildings outside the Information Center
,spamster1,2012-04-26T22:19Z,does anybody know if this works on windows 7?
,spamster1,2012-04-26T22:33Z,"I install the game, copy the files from Data/disk to the program file, and run the disc in DAEMON. When I click ""Play"", it just closes."
,JonnySlice,2012-05-04T09:07Z,"Much like Tanders, I'm having the same ""can't click on anything"" problem. I got the game to run, it works fine, but, outside of the info center, I can't click on anything. Also; when I go to quit the game, I can't click on the green brick that allows you to exit the game. I always have to exit the game by using Task Manager. Can someone please tell me what I can do to solve the unclickable problem? Thanks very much in advance for any help and tips."
,Iceytendo,2012-08-10T07:47Z,"@JonnySlice, I have actually CD and this happens. I believe if you go in config.exe and go into advance, one of the other devices will cause it to work properly, just have to play around with it a bit."
