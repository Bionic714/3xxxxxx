,goblind69,2007-06-26T02:31Z,when we call to activate the software do we just give them a serial number from one of the adobe keygens? becasue i tried this and the automated phone system said that i had incorrect info and was going to send me over to customer service before i hing up...please advise
,arrannen,2007-06-26T08:56Z,"uh...you should NEVER NEVER call a software company with a serial like that...pretty lame.  typically you generate the key using the generate button, then when you launch the program, it asks how you want to activate.  Choose phone activation.  Enter the Activation # the program gives you into the Keygen and it will spit out the response code you enter."
