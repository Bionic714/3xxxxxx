George Ivan Morrison OBE (generally known as Van Morrison) (born 31 August 1945) is a singer-songwriter from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He plays a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone. Featuring his characteristic growl ? a unique mix of throaty folk, blues, Irish, scat, and Celtic influences ? Morrison is widely considered one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll. Critic Greil Marcus has gone so far as to say that "no white man sings like Van Morrison."

Known as "Van the Man" by his fans, Morrison first rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band, Them, penning their seminal 1964 hit "Gloria". A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career. The Best of Van Morrison is a compilation album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1990 (see 1990 in music). This was his first ever "Best of" albums and was one of the best-selling albums of the 90s, spending a year and a half on the UK charts.[1]
