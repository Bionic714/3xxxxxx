"The Wild Ride" is a cult classic starring Jack Nicholson (I believe he was 21 yrs 

old at the time) as a rebellious punk of the beat generation, who spends his days 

as an amateur dirt track driver in-between partying and troublemaking. He 

eventually kidnaps his buddy's girlfriend, kills a few police officers and finally 

sees his own life end in tragedy.
