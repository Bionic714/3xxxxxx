Nice quote, had to *BUMP* it.. 

Got a few items on my list, this is now added.. Loved the first game, looking forward to this. 

BTW, anyone got the first Thief? Then please upload it..

,bnzabuza,2008-02-12T00:32Z,"THE RESOLUTION!! ---->
when i ""followed"" the instructions and clicked the ""t3.exe"" file nothing happenedm the same thing for u guys, but then i read another answer from another website from dopeman, something and i did like this:

Remove all the extractions from the theif zip folder, so that u only have the map exactly like u downloaded it and no other ""thief"" files.

When u have done that u place the whole thief folder u downloaded in C: not in programs or downloads, just in C: the folder that the ""program folder"" is in.

then u right-click on the thief zip file and press ""Extract here"" so there won't be a double folder for example when u open the thief folder u extracted, it comes up another thief folder in that and u must click it again to get the folder up with ""system"" ""content"" etc. so make sure u only have to click up ONE folder to get it all open

then u press setup and and choose the path.
If u followed my instructions the path should be ""C:\Thief - Deadly Shadows"". 
So really make sure that if u open up ""Thief - Deadly Shadows"" in C: then the system and content and setup folders appears right away, and make sure u don't have to click another thief folder in that one.

so just install the game into the folder that the system and content folders is.

when u have installed it it should look like this when u open ""C:\Thief - Deadly Shadows""

CONTENT -folder
System -folder
readme.rtf
setup.clg
Setup.exe
Uninst.exe
user.ini

If it's like that u have done the right thing.
Now u press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to get the task manager up, then press ""Processes"" and close all the ""t3"" processes there such as; t3.exe T3Main and also Ion Launcher.exe

When u have done that ur ready to go, just press the ""t3.exe"" file in SYSTEM and then u can play it fine :P like me
(this guide was originally from dopeman, i just rewrote it in my own way here at piratebay since it helped me)
THX SO MUCH DOPIE!!!"
,knives167,2008-02-23T22:54Z,"ok so what did you do to the videos? when i start the game it plays the intro over and over and over, when i hit esc. it switches to the menu for a a second or two and then replays it again...any ideas on how to fix this?"

All u guys that gets the error ""cant create a new folder"" You have to extract the game outside the dopeman folder. because the folders name contains ""[]"" symbols and u cant install it in a folder wich contains those symbols."
,joehandsome,2008-03-08T15:35Z,"Hey janz
--hope this helps;)

Known Issue:
When trying to play Thief Deadly Shadows, the intro movie constantly loops and the game will not start.
Resolution:
It is very likely that you have a Dual Core processor, such as an AMD Athlon 64 X2 or an Intel Pentium ""D"" which is the cause of the problem.
The solution is to set Thief III to use only one core.
After launching Thief Deadly Shadows:


   1. Press CTRL + ALT + Esc to bring up the task manager.

   2. Select the Processes tab.

   3. Right clicking each of the Thief III- related processes (T3Main.exe, T3.exe).

   4. Select Set Affinity.

   5. Uncheck one of the CPUs.

   6. Close the Task Manager.

   7. Press ALT + TAB to get back to the game."

[T],Vilaemail,2008-06-12T21:00Z,"First of all there are 70 seeders so torrent is OK, your computer is like shit or it ain't properly configured [firewall etc.]. Second of all is that your connection is [i'll say] slow, so 160kbps = 15KB/s aprox. 15*60*60*12 [12hrs] = 648000 = 633 MB aprox. So in 15-24hrs this schould be dl-ed.

,Speakup,2008-10-14T19:08Z,"Thanks for great torrrent, Dope! I just got one problem though, which is the same as a few other guys here have mentioned; When I start the game the intro film just keeps looping. I've tried to press Esc and in other ways tried to skip the vid but all that happens is that it comes very briefly to the menu and then the vid starts over again.

Im not sure I wanna try ""Ctrl+Alt+Esc"" thing, since that seems to cause even more trouble.. I've also downloaded ""DirectX 9 [NOV.2007] MUST HAVE TO GAME [dopeman] "" and installed, which didn't change nothing. 

SO, any suggestions? Thanks in advance"
,xiIix,2008-10-19T04:37Z,"Uhm....

Remove the video file? DUH!"
,Erick345,2008-11-25T16:46Z,"THIS GAME FUCKING RULES, I LOVE THE THIEF SERIES!!!!"
,dksone,2009-01-13T00:57Z,"Hey

For those who have the intro loop problem, this is because the game isn't compatible with dual core cpu. You have to set the game to use only one core. There is many way to do that. You can start the game, alt-tab it to go back to desktop, then run the task manager, right click on ""t3main.exe"" -> set affinity. Or you can start the game in command line. Open notepad, copy/paste ""start /affinity 1 t3.exe"" (without the quote) into it, then save it with .bat extension (not .txt!!!), in the Thief - Deadly Shadows\System folder. And run the game by double clickin the file you just create.

Anyway, thanks dopeman for this great game :)"
,jdubs420,2009-01-21T07:02Z,ok setup installed for 1 sec then now there is no way of finding it like what els am i supposed to do i didnt waste about a whole day downloading this ton not be able to play it

THE RESOLUTION!! ---->
when i ""followed"" the instructions and clicked the ""t3.exe"" file nothing happenedm the same thing for u guys, but then i read another answer from another website from dopeman, something and i did like this:

Remove all the extractions from the theif zip folder, so that u only have the map exactly like u downloaded it and no other ""thief"" files.

When u have done that u place the whole thief folder u downloaded in C: not in programs or downloads, just in C: the folder that the ""program folder"" is in.

then u right-click on the thief zip file and press ""Extract here"" so there won't be a double folder for example when u open the thief folder u extracted, it comes up another thief folder in that and u must click it again to get the folder up with ""system"" ""content"" etc. so make sure u only have to click up ONE folder to get it all open

then u press setup and and choose the path.
If u followed my instructions the path should be ""C:\Thief - Deadly Shadows"".
So really make sure that if u open up ""Thief - Deadly Shadows"" in C: then the system and content and setup folders appears right away, and make sure u don't have to click another thief folder in that one.

so just install the game into the folder that the system and content folders is.

when u have installed it it should look like this when u open ""C:\Thief - Deadly Shadows""

CONTENT -folder
System -folder
readme.rtf
setup.clg
Setup.exe
Uninst.exe
user.ini

If it's like that u have done the right thing.
Now u press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to get the task manager up, then press ""Processes"" and close all the ""t3"" processes there such as; t3.exe T3Main and also Ion Launcher.exe

When u have done that ur ready to go, just press the ""t3.exe"" file in SYSTEM and then u can play it fine :P like me
(this guide was originally from dopeman, i just rewrote it in my own way here at piratebay since it helped me)

However, I don't understand what you mean, could anyone tell me whether or not the cutscenes and other videos are included in this download.

Thank you in advance."
,zarcain,2009-04-13T01:45Z,"I'd also like to know if the cutscenes are still in good quality.
I once downloaded Painkiller from you, that was a mistake.
