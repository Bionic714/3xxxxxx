,Moose156,2007-10-11T02:52Z,"Thanks for seeding, but this file contains ""Civilization II"" and not ""Civilization II: The Test of Time.""  The latter adds science fiction and fantasy elements which I found interesting."
,bjornegil,2007-12-17T13:46Z,"""Test of Time"" is the only game in the civilization series that is not made by Sid Meier. 

Unfortunately it seems to have been made in short time, to make max profits. The game is not even close to the magic gamepaly of Civ I, II, III or IV. "

It's CIVILIZATION2!!!!"
,denious,2008-02-25T22:37Z,"This isn't Test of Time but original CivII, if you cannot mount the bin, rename it to UNTITLED.bin, it will work."
