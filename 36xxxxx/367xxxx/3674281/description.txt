175mb and 360mb rips (The highest i could find as of creating this)
All of them use common codecs.

Commentary for episodes 1 and 17 were unavailable, and so unfortunately aren't included.

It was a pain in the ass putting together all the released Season 6 stuff (and commentary)... so I figured i'd save other ppl the hassle too ;) ... All files were lovingly renamed into sane filenames... no bullshit fillers...

Your welcome :D
