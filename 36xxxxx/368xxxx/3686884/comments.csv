,al_n,2007-09-14T23:29Z,"Nope, not one of these bands are an emo band.

Emo-core maybe, but not emo.

Try some early get up kids, braid, the promise ring,  or discount. Those sir are emo bands."
,Klasw,2007-09-16T02:27Z,"What is an Emo-core band? An Emotional Hardocore-Core band?

Is it a part of the emo music line or somthing totaly different?

Mybe an Emotianal Core band (not so hard then)?

GJ!"
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-01-11T05:27Z,"i'm gonna have to agree with al_n here.  Emo has gone so far to the shitter recently.  Nowadays it seems, anybody who sounds relatively sad at all is labeled emo.  Real emo is braid, Sunny Day Real Estate, Rites of Spring, and so on.
