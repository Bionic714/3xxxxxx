"There was NO LAW... There was NO ORDER... There was just "The Man from Nowhere! ARIZONA was his name... COLT was his game!"


Il Pistolero di Arizona - The Man from Nowhere AKA Arizona Colt.


I bring you one early and surely one of the greatest Spaghetti Westerns: 
The man from Nowhere, starring Giuliano Gemma and Fernando Sancho. Directed by Michele Lupo.

Finally available on DVD, uncut and in widescreen (and now for free here on TPB :P)

Enlish language and NO subs. 


I´ll upload some more hard hitting, gunpowder smelling, whiskey flowing Italo-Westerns as soon as this one has enough seeders..
