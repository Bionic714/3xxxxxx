Synopsis 

Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is an outsider, a natural birth or `In-valid`, living in a world in which designer people - forged in test tubes - rule society. Determined to break out of this imperfect genetic destiny and fulfil his dreams, Vincent meets Jerome (Jude Law), a `Valid` willing to sell his prime genetic material for cash. 

Using Jerome`s blood, urine, skin and hair samples, Vincent is able to forge a new identity and pursue his goal of a blossoming romance with Irene (Uma Thurman), another `Valid`. However a week before his flight, a Gattaca mission director is brutally murdered and Vincent finds himself pursued by a relentless investigator (Alan Arkin) threatening to expose his counterfeit life and reveal him as `In-valid`, ending his dreams forever.
