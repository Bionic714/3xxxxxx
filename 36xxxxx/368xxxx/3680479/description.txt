Synopsis: Lieutenant Kelly (Clint Eastwood) is an atypical Army man who, while boozing with a captured German general, learns of $16 million worth of gold bars behind enemy lines. Kelly reveals a plan to his fellow soldiers: They will use their upcoming three-day passes to sneak into enemy territory, steal the gold, bury it, and return after the war to divide it among themselves. Kelly sets the heist in motion, backed by a wonderfully colorful cast of characters that includes Donald Sutherland as the appropriately named Oddball, a hippie tank driver; Don Rickles as Crapgame, a hustler and arms supplier; Telly Savalas as the skeptical sergeant who goes along for the ride; and Carroll O'Connor as the egotistical General Colt, who is glad to be mistaken for General Eisenhower.
