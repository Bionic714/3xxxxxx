VaNi means Nasty Pop, and Nasty Pop means: nice on the outside, dark on the inside! Easygoing and 100 percent synthetically created melodies provide a strong backbone to the lyrics, dealing with the important things in life and sometimes also of its atrocities. So here we go: Brilliantly sweet and wicked pop combined with clever words!
      VaNi is the ideal cure for all those who like to dance in spite of feeling badly depressed, and for those who decide to laugh in the face of adversity.
