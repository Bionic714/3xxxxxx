Red Hot Chili Peppers release 'Hump de Bump', the fifth
single to be taken from the widely acclaimed double CD set
'Stadium Arcadium' following 'Dani California', 'Tell Me
Baby', 'Snow (Hey Oh)' and 'Desecration Smile'. Produced
by Rick Rubin, 'Hump de Bump' is one of the corner stone
of the Jupiter segment of the 'Stadium Arcadium'
collection and represents an intriguing balance between
the band's earlier frenetic funk and the more streamlined
rock sound of their more recent albums

The accompanying video for 'Hump de Bump' represents the
first music promo that has been directed by comedian Chris
Rock. Having made his name as a cast member on Saturday
Night Live, Chris Rock has featured in films such as
Dogma, Beverley Hills Ninja and Nurse Betty. He also
created the TV show Everybody Hates Chris
