,HIyaalll,2009-07-30T16:27Z,"marcusn; I HOPE thats not your attitude about r.l. situations??? . I don't mind rough fantasies or porn that goes in to otherwise forbidden teritories, but.. ""what's the harm"".. well.. besides the riscs that are involved with all sex (mainly- but not exclusivly- V.D. and pregnancy), I also believe that there ARE plenty of reasons to believe in SOME moral/ethical standards.. one of them is that if you can steal or cheat something from anyone (money or enjoyment don't make any difference) without them knowing; It STILL makes you a thief. (Also I have to say that amongst the few women I've been with.. All of them would feel if they've had sex within the last couple of hours)

but also.. as I said that is my r.l. filosophies.. I'm as fed up with some of the games around love and/or sex as most are.. so I don't think there is anything wrong with a porn fantasy(consenting actors) where one just takes what one wants."
