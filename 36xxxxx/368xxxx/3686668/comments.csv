,Deji,2007-05-13T00:44Z,"This MP3 Audio recorder and organizer helps you collect, organize, and edit a mix of tunes or other audio files for a CD. You can mix MP3, WMA, and WAV files, record your own audio, set volume fades and pans using a simple graphical interface. It can import playlists (.M3U & .PLS) to create fast mixes, and export the mix as a single wav file or multiple wav files for burning a DJ-style mix CD. You can add narration or more sounds to a cut as well."
