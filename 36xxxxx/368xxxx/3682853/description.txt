This is a very rare torrent. I could only find one more on the net. Maybe because the DVD could not be ripped. There seems to be errors in both the european and american prints. I had to copy it first. Therefore the Swedish subs are burnt in.

Exciting thriller from 1992. Christopher Lambert plays a chessplayer.

"A chess grandmaster is in a big tournament, and when his lover is found painted up and the blood drained out of her body he becomes a chief suspect. After he gets a call from the killer urging him to try and figure out the game, he cooperates with police and a psychologist to try and catch the killer, but doubts linger about the grandmaster's innocence as the string of grisly murders continues."
