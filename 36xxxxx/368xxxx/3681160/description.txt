The Wars of Religion.

"The great mass of people will eventually accept whatever was given or imposed by their rulers, including religion. They might rebel at times, but it was usually about bread or taxes, not higher principles. 

Material reality and their precarious existence weigh too heavily on them. Their horizons were narrow, their submission traditional, and this worked in favor of the established authority whatever its creed or its political call.

People were there to be used and manipulated by a tiny political class and would remain so for a very long time."

In those powerful words, Professor (at the University of California at Los Angeles) Eugen Weber, concludes this episode of a TV course dealing with the more than 100 years of civil wars that the protestant reformation in Europe sparked and that tore Europe apart (16th and 17th century).
