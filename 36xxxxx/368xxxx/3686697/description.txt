* Reencoded with parts cut out to reduce the size of the file.  This was done so the files would fit with all the episodes on one DVD.  All are still really good quality; They look like the quality of the original, just a little lower resolution.


-----------------------------------------------------

The episodes are ALL good quality and unchanged from the way they were downloaded, except for being renamed to make them look "cleaner" in the compilation.

Thanks to death734 for posting these (and all the other posters... I don't remember if I got any of these files from anyone else).  Thanks and credit to everyone else that had something to do with these.
