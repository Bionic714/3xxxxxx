A Dragon On The Waterfront aka Chinese Hercules (1973)

Plot:	After Lee Hsi (Fang Yeh) accidentally kills someone in a fight, he retreats to a small village that is entirely dependent on the traffic that comes into their pier controlled by Boss Chan.

Overview:	Bone-cracker. Head-crusher. Body-breaker. Bolo Yeung stars in this action-packed production that helped to define him as the most powerful martial arts madman ever brought to the screen.

After nearly killing his fianc√©e's brother, Chan Wai Man makes a solemn vow: never to raise his hand in anger again. Finding work at a nearby dock, his vow is put to the test again and again as the workers are continuously cheated, abused, and later start turning up dead. But before Chan can raise his fist again, the company bosses turn loose the most lethal weapon in their arsenal against the workers: Chinese Hercules!

You've seen him in "Enter The Dragon" and "Bloodsport", but nothing can prepare you for Bolo Yeung in "Chinese Hercules"!
