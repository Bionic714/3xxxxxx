,eddiemar,2008-05-21T22:36Z,I saw this documentary when I was in 7th grade and it changed my life.
,eddiemar,2008-05-23T17:27Z,no audio.
,patrioticparadox,2008-08-12T23:56Z,For those of you saying it doesnt have audio its because YOU dont have the right codec. not sure which codec it uses but i do know that its why you aren't getting sound.
,swhitehouse,2008-08-19T19:39Z,I really think this might happen... I mean Im atheist but its just weird how the bible is talking about the end is close and then Nasa sayin the shit about the planets then all the prophecys ending on that date. Im just hoping it doesnt. and if it does im in good shape so i might survive... but what would be left to survive for you know?

THE SOUND WORKS PERFECTLY.

You're missing the codecs needed to hear the audio. Google is your friend.

Thanks for the up."

,Tazadar3,2011-05-29T23:18Z,"And btw - For all peeps with problems that concerns no audio and/or video, before posting that it has no audio/video use Gspot. 
A small prog that check what codecs is needed for the spesific file, audio and video codecs.. and be amazed - it tells you if u have those codecs installed or not ;)"
