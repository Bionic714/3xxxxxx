SECOND ATTEMPT AT UPLOADING:  Probably my fault, but the first attempt was a squib.

I don't know if anyone will find a use for these, but I've uploaded them anyway.  These are six high quality scans (jpegs) of various dungeon rooms - overhead views.  Not very big, nor very complex, but they served me well in my RPG playing days during the 1980s.
