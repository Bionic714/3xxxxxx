Each time I try to run this game it says ""The application could not be installed because the installer file is damaged. Try obtaining a new installer file from the application author.""

NOw I have copied those 3 folders to my harddrive, and have installed Adobe AIR too but still game wont run. I am running Winodws 7 64 bits on windows premium home edition, have 16GB ram and 1TB harddisk.
Can somebody please tell me what I am doing wrong??
Thanks in advance.
Yngvar "
