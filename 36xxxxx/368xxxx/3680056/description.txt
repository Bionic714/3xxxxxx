You can turn your favorite digital photos into realistic looking
paintings such as watercolor, oil painting, pencils, etc. with a
few simple mouse clicks. No difficult setup is required. Your
photos are turned into paintings in front of your eyes in a few
seconds.

Virtual Painter 5 could not be any easier to use -- all you need
to do is to select a digital photograph, taken with a digital
camera, scanned with a scanner, or downloaded from the web, select
one of the 16 painting styles (also called painters or filters),
choose the material on which the painting will be created (canvas,
wood, stucco, etc.), and let Virtual Painter 5 do the work for
you.

Virtual Painter 5 is not a painting tool that you must master to
create your own works of art. Rather, the filters it offers are
like agents, virtual artists who have their own characteristic
techniques and methods. You can preview their art and even request
a few changes, but you can leave the hard work to them. Sit back
and watch them paint. You're sure to be pleasantly surprised, time
after time
