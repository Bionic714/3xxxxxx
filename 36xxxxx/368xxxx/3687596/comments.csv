,SilentChorus,2009-01-17T12:15Z,"Hi :) I just downloaded this and it comes up as wanting to burn an image... very confused.

How do I make this play as a game?

Thankyou..."
,Dark_Lolita,2009-07-20T21:47Z,"its an ISO people. It has to be burned to a cd or run in a cd rom emulator like Deamon tools.  If it asks to burn it to a cd, then Burn it to a cd.  when its done, just install and run from that burned cd.  
hope that helps.  "
