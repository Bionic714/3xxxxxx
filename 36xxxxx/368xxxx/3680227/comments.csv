This is one of the best games ever, and we've got to make sure people know about it before Fallout 3 comes along and changes everything we know and love about Fallout!"

,sparrowhawk13,2008-03-11T04:26Z,"Doesn't seem to work on my Intel Mac running OS X Leopard....the game runs, but the graphics are completely corrupted.  Shows the game screen squished into the left half of the screen and all in negative.  Anyone got any ideas?"

,Thiagz,2008-05-16T14:03Z,I have the same problems sparrow and Needsmorepaintball. Doesn't work with Os X leopard. Please IF you have a solution... This game is fucking Great!!!!!!
,TheDaemon,2008-07-17T01:49Z,"To the people having problems with Leopard, I suspect it may be the same problem Starcraft and Diablo 2 players are having. With update 10.5.3, Apple just kind of got rid of 256 colors mode, which I assume this game uses, given it's age. See this topic for some more info, and I'll post if the game ever finishes downloading.

Make sure to read the entire topic.
I'm only getting about 10 KB/s, so if anybody wants to up the UL speed, I'd be very grateful."
,TheDaemon,2008-07-17T05:41Z,"Alright, the download finished and the game worked. I think the problem you guys are having is the same as the SC and D2 folks were. Check the topic I gave."
,oJcC,2008-07-26T12:22Z,"Your problem is that leopard no longer has 256-bit colour, you need to download the update from apple."
,zanderohm,2008-08-05T04:45Z,"where do you get this 256-colour update for leopard?
can't find it..."
,Needsmorepaintball,2008-09-08T03:15Z,"256 graphics update is here

,PsychoPEN15,2008-09-15T13:08Z,"I just got this, but i am having trouble mounting it. It keeps saying..

*No mountable file systems*. 

I saw someone else had this problem. Can someone please help me."
,martinsvensson_,2008-11-17T19:54Z,How do I get this game working on my MacBook from this year with Leopard? No advanced programming mish-mash please...
,DylanJGreen,2009-03-01T17:25Z,"Please seed guys, I'm getting 1kb/s max."
,Keith120,2009-03-11T04:17Z,"I think there was another one of these a while back, I DL'd the torrent and had it completely done, but when I was done it was only a HUGE text file.  Is this one Legit?"
,Royal23,2009-03-18T23:40Z,Do i need a serial number or something to run this game?
,thegame_45,2009-04-11T16:25Z,"Just wondering if anyone had step by step instructions. I tried it, but I get the Duck and Cover line, and then my screen gets all distorted, and I can't do anything after that. Thanks"
,deftayne,2009-07-14T00:21Z,seed plz mac ftw 
,odyzeus,2009-07-15T12:59Z,"** BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE 256 COLOUR UPDATE ** 

Like a dickhead, I forgot that my 2008 Macbook White has the GMA X3100 chipset, and the NOT NVIDIA, which the update supports. 

If you install the 256 colour update on the wrong Macbook, as far as I'm aware you'll have goosed your card's settings and have to reinstall OS X.

Anyway, savage game, wish I could play it, hope this comment helps. Thanks Biff666!

,cavsfan69,2009-09-15T05:16Z,"When I try to start it up it doesn't even get to the duck and cover before it shuts down and says ""application fallout quit unexpectedly"".  I didn't instal the graphics update. should I do that?"
,fenexomega,2009-09-15T16:37Z,"SEED PLEASE, I'M AWATING  FOR MONTHS  TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!"

,IbutsuHimitsu,2010-02-07T12:03Z,Thanks! Seeding until next week.
,davvor,2010-08-27T21:56Z,Doesnt work for me. The loading screen comes up just fine but then it goes black but I can still hear the menu screen. I think its because my graphics card is ATI 2600 Pro. I heard the game works fine with nVidia graphics cards though.
,stringaaa,2010-10-05T00:08Z,"Having trouble with this under 10.6 - the game installed and will open, but creates a 640 x 480 window, half of which is a horribly garbled version of the home screen."
,MajorParts,2010-12-16T00:34Z,"Won't start for me, using Mac OS X version 10.6.5 with ATI Radeon HD 4670. When I open fallout it opens to a screen and then immediately quits and a program called ""OmniGroup CrashCatcher"" opens and quits unexpectedly. Is anyone having this problem? or does anyone know how to help?"
,brwowsrs,2010-12-25T06:52Z,"Game is all black. Works fine I'm sure, but I have ATIx1600. Not a happy camper at this point. Where do I find the liars who are responsible for the Fallout 3 fake download."
,DEsnakeater,2011-03-31T19:08Z,seed plz ;O
,vshell24,2011-06-12T04:15Z,"How come it when i start it up I can't see anything, it's all grey and fuzzed. and won't stretch the whole screen. "
,DEsnakeater,2011-08-13T01:50Z,wtf i installed the drivers and i opened fallout and it was still fucked
,TheCaptainEh,2011-09-01T09:42Z,"Should I try to install that 256 color fix?
I have a Radeon 2600 Pro, and I'm not experienced on this, will it work or fuck up my card or what?"
