In this video excellent video presentation EarthFiles reporter Linda Moulton Howe discusses the possible burial of a large object  in Utah in the 1950s and the subsequent creation of an advanced triangular base built around the item for examination purposes and possibly more.

In addition Linda surrounds the story with a unique and honest  insight into the extra-terrestrial phenomenon generally and  makes the important point that unless we begin to get to grips with the situation fast we are in danger of having to exist in a purely simulated world of above-government secrecy and misdirection.
