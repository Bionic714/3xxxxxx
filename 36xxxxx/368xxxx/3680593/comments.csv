,MCSmarties,2007-05-12T22:54Z,"Hi again. Glad that this sucker is finally uploaded, thanks everybody for your patience!

I am so sorry I forgot to mention pskill.exe.
It's a tiny utility I call in several scripts to stop the media player (see for example the source code for MIComic.exe). I guess some antivirus programs label it a virus (because it can kill a process) but I can guarantee that it's not nasty!
See also http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/pskill.mspx
I should also point out that the installation script for MI3 and MI4 only work if the archive is burned to a DVD first.

Please post if there are any other problems, and ENJOY!"

Was you tht create this DVD-ROM ? The installers, everything ?

Thanks."
,Ixidor,2007-09-16T19:35Z,"ok....so i downloaded it pretty fast thanks to you guys, I'm going to seed, its just my computer's a little slow right now. When I unpack it it all goes well and I try to use the script to download, it gets to CD1 has been mounted, and then it says cannot locate the setup1.exe or something of that nature file. Does anyone know what this means and how I can fix it?"
,Lechoch,2007-09-21T22:50Z,"please seed I can´t live without this game :-))
Played it 10 years ago. I´ll seed it !!!!"
,MCSmarties,2007-09-23T22:32Z,"griever572: Did you BURN the compilation to a DVD first? If you try to run the installer for MI3 or MI4 from a mounted drive it will fail (because it has to mount the MI CDs while it's running).
I tested everything on a vanilla Windows XP system and it worked so if you have problems after that, it's from your setup.

saulob: YES. I did NOT create any of the content but spent literally hours trying to find everything related to MI and packaged it together.
I also did NOT crack the games myself, that was already available.
Kudos to all the MI fans out there, I hope your creations made it onto this DVD!"
,pandakorv,2007-11-08T01:06Z,"Hi,
Great torrent!

I hope anyone could help me fix my problem with the second game, Lechuck's revenge.

The installation proceeds well, but I encounter problem when I start the game. The program runs really slow and after a while it tells me to input numers, probably from an ""anti piracy code wheel"". It wouldn't help to have the code wheel though, since the program runs so slow that it won't respond to my keyboard inputs at all."
,MCSmarties,2007-11-12T05:44Z,"pandakov:
1. You don' t need the code wheel, the game is cracked.
2. The game uses VDMSound to emulate an old soundblaster card and tweak the game speed.
You can try to browse to the folder where you installed the game to, right-click on MONKEY2.EXE, select ""Run with VDMSound..."" and create a new configuration. Not sure what else to tell you - try the VDMSound forum on http://vogons.zetafleet.com/"

,brizznown,2008-07-01T18:51Z,"If you're looking for a way to play the Monkey Island games without having all the problems with music/audio....get this torrent!  I've installed the first three games, and they're working like a charm.  (I haven't installed Escape from Monkey Island, since I have it for PS2.)

I get the feeling that installing Curse for Monkey Island would have been simpler if I'd burned this whole thing to a DVD and installed from there.  Regardless, the manual installation instructions worked, and the game's working just fine.

P.S. The more ppl d/l and seed this thing, the faster I'll get it next time my HD explodes :P So pass this fuc*er on!"

,baller4lyfe,2008-09-21T02:55Z,"I'm having a bit of trouble with MI2 not working at all, and then in MI3 the audio locks up and then the game stops working completely. Seems to be related to amount of time playing. Also, when installing 3 and 4, if you set daemon tools to have 2 virtual drives and mount the ISO file with the second drive the install is successful...still trouble with MI3 though"

,MCSmarties,2008-10-17T04:10Z,"Thanks everybody for the kind comments. Amazing to see that this torrent is still going strong after all this time! Proof that the MI games were some of the best ever made... WHO SAYS ADVENTURE GAMES ARE DEAD!!

For those who have asked: unfortunately, these installers DO NOT WORK under Microsoft Vista... sorry! However, you CAN still play the games with Vista. You will need to install them ""manually"", and then:
- for MI 1 and 2: use [url=http://www.scummvm.org/]ScummVM[/url]. See the website for instructions. I use the ""override global graphics settings"" options with graphics mode ""AdvMAME2x""
- MI3 runs with ScummVM as well. No need to override the graphics there.
- MI4 runs natively under Vista
- The DVD wrapper itself and all the ""bonus"" things appear to work just fine.
Have fun!"

,MonkeyOnKeyboard,2009-01-01T06:19Z,This is great and every thing but I can't install MI3 when every I try i get an error from Demon Lite saying it was unable to mount image. Can someone help me? I'm using Windows XP and its only for this game that the error has occurred. 
,MCSmarties,2009-01-04T04:32Z,"MonkeyOnKeyboard:
1. Did you BURN the ISO file to a DVD? The automatic installer for MI3 won't work if the file is just mounted.
2. There are manual installation instructions included in the release even if the automatic installer doesn't work for you.
Good luck!"
,chickenbone,2009-01-15T02:27Z,"I just finished downloading the file and I burned everything onto a DVD, and decided to try to install MI3 and 4 since I kept hearing that everyone had problems with it. I followed the instructions carefully, but I still ran into some problems; perhaps someone here can give me a hand.

For MI3, when I launch the CMI launcher, and when I try to click on ""Windows 2000/XP cutscene fix"", I get this error

'Unable to open key ""SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\hardware profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\HDAUDIO\FUNC_01&VEN_0885&SUBSYS_106B3E00&REV_1001\4&1D21CA73&0&001\DirectSound\Mixer Defaults| and access value ""acceleration""'

I tried to start the game anyway, and it kinda works, until I gain control, then the sound freezes after about a minute.

For MI4, I can't see my mouse, so I can't really get past the first screen of the game. I didn't get any errors when opening the EMI launcher though, or when I tried to launch the game.

Hopefully someone can help me out so I can play these wonderful games! Oh btw I'm using Windows XP."
,MCSmarties,2009-01-22T04:39Z,"@Chickenbone:

For MI3: no idea what that error means. All I can say is that I don't have any audio components listed at that registry key on my computer.
Check your device manager for problems (menu -> run -> devmgmt.msc)

For MI4: There's nothing wrong with your system! Believe it or not but MI4 DOES NOT USE A MOUSE! Press F1 for help. I know, it takes some getting used to ;-)

Good luck, enjoy the games."

,sirjenkum,2009-07-19T11:01Z,"For those having trouble running Monkey Islands 1, 2, and 3 I highly suggest you download an install ScummVM. It is a virtual machine that will run the old Monkey Islands.

1) Just install using the DVD or manually by finding each game on the DVD. 

2) Install ScummVM: http://www.scummvm.org/

3) Run ScummVM and ""add"" the monkey island game you want by navigating to its directory and pressing ""choose""

4) In ScummVM go into the Options and set the save directory (important! or you can't save)

5) Run the game from the ScummVM select list

Note: To save you can't use the MI save feature. Instead press F5 to bring up the ScummVM menu to save and do various other things."
