IMPORTANT NOTES:
- For best results, BURN the torrent to a DVD before running the installers
  (the automated installers for MI3 and MI4 won't work from a mounted image)

- The installers DO NOT work for Microsoft Vista, but you can still play the
  games with this operating system (or even using Linux or Mac) by using
  the ScummVM software - http://www.scummvm.org/
