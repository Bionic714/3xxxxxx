This is the classic Twilight Zone series from 1985-1988.
Season 2 & 3 has English subs in separate srt files.
The episodes all have different resolutions.
In the original aired programs there were often two or three episodes in one night.
Here, they are all separate.
There is also a list of all the episodes in a Word document.

For us who were teenagers when this was showed, it's a true nostalgia trip!
Enjoy.

Also. Lots of thanks to the person who made these torrents available in the first place. Who ever you are.

I can also recommend "The Outer Limits" to all of you who loved this.
