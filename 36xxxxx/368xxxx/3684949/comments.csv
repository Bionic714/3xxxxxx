,spanishjoyride,2007-05-11T17:30Z,"Thanks for providing this wonderful series! Are you going to continue seeding? The torrent shows only peers and no seeders.

Thanks!"
,georrge,2007-05-13T19:23Z,My seeding ratio is now 8 so I'm soon going to stop.
,thesoftparade,2007-10-03T13:28Z,Seems like I'm the only seeder on this torrent right now so I'll be seeding for a couple of weeks longer. This is a great show and should not be missed! My ratio is now about 2.5 with 24/1mbps so it's a bit slow but I'll be seeding with 24/8mbps soon. I want to thank the uploader georrge for an excellent work. I really appreciate it! Thanks!
,thesoftparade,2007-10-10T12:04Z,I have now uploaded to ratio 11. approx 201GB! I'm going to seed for one more week...

,mandrak37,2008-04-16T01:31Z,This is some great stuff I will seed to 2:1 at a minimum.  Hopefully others can do the same to help grow the # of seeders!

,a_raccoon,2011-10-12T05:43Z,"nobody seems to be capable of encoding every episode/season/disc with identical settings (resolution, bitrate).

this is another franken-collection(tm)."
,TessOSaurus,2012-07-30T06:34Z,"@lastjedi:

1. People with hearing problems may need subtitles.
2. There are three seasons of the revamped Twilight Zone."
