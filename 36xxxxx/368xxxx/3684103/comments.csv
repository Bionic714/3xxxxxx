,majtymicke,2007-05-09T14:18Z,"I could only find this info about this DVD set. ""ELVIS ON TOUR - THROUGH MY EYES - DVD VOL 1 and 2 - In his own way, Elvis will tell everything you always wanted to know, combined with stunning unreleased performances. STAR PRODUCTIONS.""

So is this just another release of Elvis on tour but with an added name or what? "
,Miguel28,2007-05-09T21:28Z,"Not another Elvis On Tour, it has a lot of footage that don't appears on the original release. It's a must have for any Elvis fan!"
,majtymicke,2007-05-10T13:53Z,"Ah, then Im getting it. Thanks for the fast reply :-)"
,bada-bing,2007-05-11T22:51Z,Elvis On Tour Through My Eyes is another cracking release from the STAR label. They have totaly stripped the original movie and rebuilt it via outtake footage into a 3 hour plus brilliant rockumentary. THIS is the movie On Tour should have been and cannot be recomended highly enough for the serious Elvis fan.
,daley_64,2007-07-25T00:21Z,Thanks Miguel Respect to you.
