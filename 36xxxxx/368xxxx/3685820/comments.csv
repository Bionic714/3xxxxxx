,YowzaTheBear,2007-08-28T05:59Z,"No ""perhaps"" about it!"
,coccoinomane,2007-10-15T19:13Z,"Thank you for the wonderful release. But... Maria Callas is not Italian :-) As bane021 pointed out, she is Greek.

Carmen - By Georges Bizet: Disc 3, Track 04 - Melons! Coupons! It doesn't  work properly.

Can you fix that? Thank you for the rest.

A great pity   :O( "

Simply either reduce directory path or shorten directory names on problem files and you will be able to edit/play all files.
A truly wonderful collection DeniceMcKillop1 and I thank you so much.
