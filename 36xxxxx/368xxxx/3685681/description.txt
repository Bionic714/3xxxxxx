I had been looking for this movie for ever after reading the book and finally found it. anyway - this is my first upload so if anything is not quite right please let me know and i'll do it again. The quality is good enough although I am still in search of a better copy - for now, this is all I could find :(

the book had intrigued me and i really wanted to see the movie. after seeing it i think it was not quite what i was expecting... but still worth the watch - and i know many people are in search of it so here it is :)

The thesis of this visually stunning documentary feature is that plants have feelings, too, and that they have a variety of ways of expressing them. Based on the best-selling book by Peter Topkins and Christopher Bird, the custom of talking to one's houseplants is strongly recommended by the filmmakers. Though scientific in tone, the film does not air the opposing view advocated by, perhaps, a majority of scientists. One highlight of the film is its original musical score by Stevie Wonder. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide
