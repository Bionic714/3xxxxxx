,turtle_stof,2007-05-13T14:03Z,"ok, I had the pleasure of being connected directly to the uploader for a while. It seems his/her upload is a little slow.
It's trickling in, but it seems to be getting there quite steadily, I guess we'll have to be patient for a rare find, but if we all keep seeding, then all new leechers will have blazing speeds ;)"
,La_fertilidad,2007-05-14T01:26Z,"now  92.3%


.... almost there

""In the worlds before Monkey, primal chaos reigned. Heavens sought order. But the phoenix can fly only when its feathers are grown. The four worlds formed again and yet again, as endless aeons wheeled and passed. Time and the pure essence of Heaven, the moisture of the Earth, the powers of the Sun and the Moon all worked upon a certain rock, old as creation. And it became magically fertile. That first egg was named ""Thought"". Tathagata Buddha, the Father Buddha, said, ""With our thoughts, we make the World"". Elemental forces caused the egg to hatch. From it came a stone monkey. The nature of Monkey was irrepressible!""

,turtle_stof,2007-05-14T18:35Z,LOL - looks like la_fertilidad had some time on his/her hands waiting for this download ;)
,turtle_stof,2007-05-14T18:51Z,"quality judgement:
it seems to be a VHS rip with a dirty playback-head. De-interlacing needed. Colours are faded. Sound is hissy and canned.
All in all exactly the way old-fashioned COLOR TV looked.
in my humble opinion:
Picture: 6/10
Sound: 6/10

Still, however, an interesting film from the time when para-psychology wasn't a swear-word."
,music1,2007-05-14T22:22Z,"WE SHOULD ALL THANK shtroumpfbleu .  This is a rare video. Even though it is a VHS copy, at least we get to watch it. Also, go to AMAZON and read about Stevie Wonders Soundtrack to this movie. Again, Thank you shtroumpfbleu 
for making this available to us all. "
,majalogan,2007-05-16T16:38Z,"awesome, seed please!"
,Interpolice,2007-05-31T13:58Z,"What a major asshole, spamming this torrent's description into a zillion others at TPB.

I would never download from a spammer.

I wish there was some way to tie you to a stake and set you on fire.

Ooh, who wants a ""rare"" VHS download on plants having sentient feelings? ha ha ha

What, nothing about mineral and crystal consciousness too?"
,stauntj,2007-07-07T20:09Z,"honestly people, why is there such a need to be so aggressive on this site. I was downloading something from axxo, saw this and thought I would have a look, for fuck sake, its not as if hes selling cialis/viagra. You'd swear you actually are paying for this with some of the reactions."
,freakindawg,2007-07-25T04:45Z,"Thanks for bringing this rare yet naive portrayal of plant life. The ""experiments"" performed in this vid wouldn't pass scientific methods in this day and age. All they showed was that plants react to bio-electrical chemistry, ionisation and possibly pheromones to name a few But if you're a plant lover with a romantic penchant, this might be is for you."
,Paichuman,2007-10-11T15:40Z,Can someone seed plz.......
,41R534,2007-11-09T19:25Z,"I've it in forced seeding, but I'm having some major problems with my PC, and besides that, limited upload bandwidth..."
,toopro,2008-03-23T14:20Z,"Why do people want to be so sceptic and negative about this kind of thing? I think it's interesting... Something we haven't really researched that much yet.

The ones who go ""bullshit"" give me the impression they would 've also laughed at the ones talking about matter not being solid, in times when this wasn't proven yet. We now know, however, this is a prevalent subject in certain streams of modernday science. I guess it could be the same with this plant thing.

I am talking specifically about western science, rather than oriental science. In Asia, scientists are no stranger to acknowledging intelligence, consciousness and emotions in non-human lifeforms. In Japanese research involving animal test subjects, for example, a form of grace and respect is attempted to be maintained. For one thing they respect our small knowledge about the non-human experience of life, so they don't do as many things to animals as western scientists if they aren't sure it would hurt or not. They don't assume animals can't feel pain."
,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:29Z,"If you are interested in this subject matter, you will definitely want to get the following torrent: 

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.
