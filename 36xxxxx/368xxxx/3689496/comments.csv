,oswald1234,2007-05-19T07:50Z,Is this the BBC one? 
,Jalockin,2007-05-22T12:18Z,How do I burn this to a dvd to keep the HD settings ?
,rc71,2007-05-29T19:01Z,"I've done everything listed nothing works.  I've viewed HDTV China's releases before so I don't think they are MPAA fakes, but every tool I've used says there is no MPEG2 Stream like an MPAA fake.  I've tried 2k, XP, OSX, media player classic, vlc, wmp11+sdk, video Redo, NOTHING plays any video.  The link for codec downloads fails to complete.  
IF the codec works, please include it in the torrent.  Thanks."
,bigdaddie_1,2007-06-12T05:02Z,Anybody figure out how to view the video stream?!?
,Snurre__,2007-06-20T09:15Z,"I have the same problem as ""rc71"" it's only this Planet Earth EXX that wont play. All other HDTV China plays fine"
,Snurre__,2007-06-20T09:19Z,"what do u mean ""bigdaddie_1"" Steam this video? like play as u download?

,Snurre__,2007-06-20T09:43Z,"install: 

MatroskaSplitter.exe
hdtvpump-setup-1.0.7.exe

,karmaseed,2007-06-27T02:57Z,"Has anyone gotten the video to work yet?  I've downloaded various splitters and video decoders but no dice.  

Snurre, did you have luck getting video with matroska and hdtv-pump?  What media player did you use, and how did you configure it?"
,Gmork_Tulle,2007-07-12T11:38Z,"I finally found a player that will play these files!

Zoomplayer WMV Professional 5.00

It's downloadeable at http://www.inmatrix.com/files/zoomplayer_download.shtml#WMV

It takes a lot of computing power, but it plays.

My Pentium D @ 3,15 GHz can only render approximately 16 FPS."
