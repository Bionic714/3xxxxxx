The numbers of torrents you seeds at the same time is plain stupid ( ca 30 in one day ) 

When you have uploaded a torrent please make sure that it reaches someone! Please dont upload more stuff now. Start seeding.......

,Formula Firebird,2007-05-13T12:27Z,This torrent is at the moment dowloading. If you read this please start seeding the torrents from yesterday ( ABBA albums ) We are over 50 leaches/torrent
,Formula Firebird,2007-05-13T12:38Z,"What!!! ?
Stops at 52,1%. Sorry for my language: HÆSTKUK!"
,thesoftparade,2007-10-12T22:45Z,Nice! Tack så mycket onhold! Bra seed nu. Jag seedar duktigt när den är nere.
