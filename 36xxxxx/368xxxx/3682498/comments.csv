,flippers,2007-05-11T01:33Z,"Karlfk555- you dumbass!!!
You should try reading some history books. Norway and Denmark FOUGHT against the nazis in ww2. Since you mention Switzerland, I guess what you ment was the countries that stayed neutral, right..?So.. I guess what you REALLY wanted to say was ""that you hate the swiss and the swedes"". But nevermind, I'm sure that this Beavis and Butthead attitude of yours will make people sit down and think, and I bet all the Norwegiand and Swiss people really feel ashamed now..."

Type: Documentary
Rating: NR
Running Time: 96 Minutes
Directed by: Walon Green
Soundtrack: Stevie Wonder

The thesis of this visually stunning documentary feature is that plants have feelings, too, and that they have a variety of ways of expressing them. Based on the best-selling book by Peter Topkins and Christopher Bird, the custom of talking to one's houseplants is strongly recommended by the filmmakers. Though scientific in tone, the film does not air the opposing view advocated by, perhaps, a majority of scientists. One highlight of the film is its original musical score by Stevie Wonder. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide"
