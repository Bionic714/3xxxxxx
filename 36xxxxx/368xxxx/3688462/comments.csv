,tattilo,2007-11-22T22:28Z,"Hello!
Thank You!
What you do is very helpfull.
I just started looking for the western-movies I watched late at night when I was a kid and my parents were not at home. Yes. Those have been glorious nights. Just me, the cowboys, dirty and brutal, and the best directing. You can compare the style in directing almost with Lee Perry's style of composing and mixing. Raw, harsh, beautyful, for me. Those guys have been the fathers and friends I have never had. Thanks a lot again.
Keep on uploading, if possible. I just finished Arizona Colt and Companeros and now seeding as long as only possible.
See ya..."

,Belyos,2008-07-27T21:40Z,"uhm I'm having a little problem: when I mount the dvd and start it with any player it stops shortly after the main titles. Windows media player crashes, VLC stops and PowerDVD stops and crashes if I fast forward. anyone else having that problem? Cuz this is kida annoying I've downloaded for 3 days and have uploaded over 3GB..."
