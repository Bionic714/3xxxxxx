Fate brought them together. Greed made them inseparable, and violence made them Compañeros!


I bring you one of my personal favourite Italo-westerns - Sergio Corbuccis Compañeros.

I will not bore you with the plot of the movie, but you will have one hell of a ride watching it.. ;)


Included extramaterial: Interviews with Franco Nero and Tomas Milian. Trailers

The movie have both Italian and English lanuage and optional English subtitles.
