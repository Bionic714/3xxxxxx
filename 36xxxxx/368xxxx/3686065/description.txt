I bring you now Dawn of the dead Remake from 2004, it's so spookey and well made that it deserves 5 stars.. but they can run. damn you hollywood!! zombies walk.. not run, thats why they are sooo scary. god damnit.!

but anywho!!

this is a really god movie, very scary and a very high budget. 

i got this movie on dvd. so write down in comments if you want me to rip and upload it. there's som exelent speciel feautures on the dvd.. so i think i will, but i want you to write in comments first. if just one dude wants me to, then i do it..

anywho.

cheers
