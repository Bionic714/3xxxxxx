Hans Christian Andersens classic tales are filled with fantasy, folklore, and wonder. The Ugly Prince Duckling takes you and your family on a new adventure playing Andersen himself. Meet the Princess. Day after day she gazes longingly out her window upon the fascinating world below her. On her 15th birthday, tired of her boring privileged life, she decides to leave the royal palace against her fathers wishes in search of adventure. Along her journey she meets young Hans Christian Andersen ? a poor teenager struggling to make his way in life, the Little Mermaid, the Ugly Duckling, and other characters made famous in Andersens fairytales. Meanwhile, lurking in the dark shadows, the wicked Master of Darkness begins hatching his evil plan. Without the protection of the palace walls, he kidnaps the Princess with help from the Trolls. He plans to expel the King and transform the kingdom into a Troll?s realm of darkness. Your job is to save the Princess and the kingdom!"
