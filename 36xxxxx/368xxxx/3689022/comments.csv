it was F.E.A.R., & although it worked, i had HUGE performance hits no matter what settings i tried; i found this odd due to the fact that when i ran a test, it said my minimum FPS were 37, but i had horrible FPS hits for no reason whatsoever. i used to have the game before, & it ran great. oh well, i've D/L'ed 3 games from you & all run great; this'll be my fifth, right after EiB :D"

,exeon_Zechs,2009-12-06T20:55Z,"For those of you saying ""use the latest winrar"" if this is a .7z...why not use 7zip, maybe because it would make sense to use a better archive program?"
,skoho,2009-12-08T00:37Z,"*sighs* if you crash after the first level just use the gdm solution that was posted earlier. Read the rest of the comments before you start your bitching and whining, this ALWAYS happens with every torrent there is on piratebay, retards that cant read the rest of the comments and dont know shit about computers bitch about the torrent being broken. 

tyty dopeman, great torrent."
,Uder1710,2009-12-22T04:46Z,"This Torrent works!

Just Extract and use the Application! :)"
,Snowhawk_69,2010-01-01T01:18Z,"hey DOPEMAN
I followed the previous post to correct the issue of loading up the 2nd level by changing the compatibility of the .exe, but for some reason my system is not recognizing the area 51.exe file as a .exe file. I'm running on Win7 Ultimate & other games that I've installed so far (i.e. RE4) have worked. Any idea how i can fix this issue?"
,Tomske,2010-01-24T15:57Z,"sweet download, works 100% the games fucking shit though."

,3m0p4nd4,2011-06-04T16:36Z,This is a glitch in the game not the torrent i owned a legit copy and it did the same thing a couple of times. There is a code you can use to jump to the next lvl but you lose all your weapons/items. havnt played it in a long time so maybe there is a patch to fix it by now.
,stevethedeve,2011-07-18T06:00Z,"Another great torrent by DOPEMAN! For anyone having problems with low frame rates with ATI graphics cards use a program called 3D Analyze and check the box for emulate cube maps (under hardware limits) This is a problem with the game itself not with the torrent.  Cheers DOPEMAN, it's always 420 somewhere!"

,Cipala92,2012-06-30T10:39Z,The game worked perfect. Only thing was that non of the cutscenes or cinematics worked and at the end of the game when you walk through the exit the game just takes you to the main menu. But its no big deal. I changed it to run as windows 98 and had no big problems with it. Crashed a couple of times but when I started it up again it worked fine
,YOLO33,2012-07-04T19:57Z,this game is great
