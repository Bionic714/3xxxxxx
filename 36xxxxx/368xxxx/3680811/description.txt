Movie info:
Just a good documentary, trying to prove about the interference of the USA, the World Bank, IMF,etc, in the economy and business of other countries. Filmed in locations around The Guarani aquifer, a big repository of water, able for supplying all the population of the planet for four hundred years, a resource under the see of foreign economies, and in ecologic danger. The Guarani aquifer is owned by Argentina, Brasil, Paraguay and Uruguay, witch's governments seems no to be interested. The movie reveals why the rumors of terrorism in in the south, in special the triple border is a fraud, and the only intention is to control the natural resources-water and biological-,installing military bases in the zone. It was made with interviews to scientist, politics and journalist, including Nobel Prize Adolfo PÃ©rez Esquivel, some interviews in natural landscapes, near animals like the cayman, a kind of crocodile, and there is a comparison, in how the World Bank is a predator.
