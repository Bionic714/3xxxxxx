 [b][u].:. COLIN McRae Rally 4 -SOUND FIX!-  .:.[/u][/b]
 

Note: 

Missing "Sound.uha" now you have CO-DRIVER + CarSounds + Music!


:. Install .:

1) Unrar this File to your damn GameFolder.

2) double click "ToeD.exe" to start Install.(no error this time)

   ( all other methods you may try wont work! ) 


! Tested ! WorkS ! Tested ! WorkS ! Tested ! WorkS ! Tested !


btw:
if you have colin mcrae 4 in any other folder make sure to go to that folder
and double click on "setupreg.exe" and choose "un-install". that way you clean
your Registry with older ColinMcRae 4 entries. thats all i could do for you ppl.




FLAT OUT 2 can be fixed by Double Click on "build.exe" (Flatout folder)
klick this AFTER the first installation has been finished!. sorry for all!
