Brainwashing 101

Brainwashing 101 is a provocative short film showing how 
universities use tools such as "speech codes" to force political 
views upon students. In this cutting expos√©, documentary filmmakers 
Maloney, Browning and Greenberg shine a light on political correctness, 
academic bias, student censorship--even administrative cover-ups of death 
threats--at three schools: Bucknell University, the University of Tennessee 
at Knoxville and California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly).
