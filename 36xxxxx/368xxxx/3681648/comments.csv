The only thing this is about is some stupid police officers screwing up and refuses to admit they are wrong. With it's obvious bias and incredibly dumb focus on this rather than actually making a documentary about how freedom of speech is impeached in universities. This could have actually been something!

I am disappointed that they have tainted this motif with their obvious lack of neutrality and substance."
