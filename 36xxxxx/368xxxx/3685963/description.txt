Synopsis: When her husband jumped out of a plane without a parachute, Grace Trevethen knew life would get tough?but she had no idea just how tough. Left with a manor on the Cornish coast, a mountain of debt and dozens of creditors on her heels, she is about to lose everything. But with Matthew, the manor?s caretaker, Grace hatches an outrageous idea: Why not use her renowned green thumb to plant a cash crop and pay off her debts?
Soon her greenhouse becomes a hot bed of illegal activity - and business starts blooming. But if the buzz gets too big, these budding entrepreneurs just might have to watch their dreams go up in smoke!
Two-time Academy Award nominee Brenda Blethyn (Secrets & Lies, Little Voice) and Craig Ferguson (TV?s The Drew Carey Show) are delightful in a most potent comedy that?ll make you "just say yes to Saving Grace!" ?-Leah Rozen, People.
