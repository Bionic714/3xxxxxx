,=michael=,2007-05-16T08:45Z,Thanks!!!
,Rsites,2007-05-16T19:37Z,"I'm thankful for the upload, but unfortunately, by removing the Dolby Digital 5.1, you have taken away the sound completely for all of us who are only using the TV's built-in speakers."
,DTSES,2007-05-16T20:10Z,"Yes, that's true. No sound with TV speakers and I know that. If you keep both DD 5.1 and DTS track then the picture will be very poor. So...
There are many versions out there on 007 movies with DD5.1 or DD1.0 tracks but with these releases I want to have the best soundtrack together with the best picture since these versions have remastered picture quality (UE). So I think there is no other way too realese them then this. Take it or leave it.
Enjoy DTS freaks out there!"
