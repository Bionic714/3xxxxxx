,seanthepirate,2008-05-11T03:41Z,"This movie is shit! 

At about 11 minutes into the movie the image and sound are corrupted for a good 20 seconds or so. This happens again at 13 minutes and 15 minutes. And it doesn't stop there . . . 

Doesn't anybody have a better version of this movie? I tried VLC and Mplayer as well as my pre-installed dvd player software . . ."

,MikeQuest3,2008-09-20T10:41Z,"Hello
*Thanks for uploading & to those who are seeding.
*Remember that this is for free so one can only go as far as commenting abt the print anything more sounds rude.
*This print is a dub which means actually actors are speaking language other than english but voices comes out in eng. (pls dont mind my explaination just an FYI).
*Many of the scenes are removed & video quality is not exactly good
I would suggest downloading this torrent as last preference.
Thanks
Mike"
