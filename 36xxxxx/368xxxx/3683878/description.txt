Another film I hope Freakyflicks will pick up!

This has got to be one of the darkest, most unrelentlessly unpleasant movies of all time. It includes one of THE MOST nightmarish scenes I've ever had a chance to witness in a film (the black-white scene near the end). David Lynch could probably learn a few things from this guy (there are a few stylistic similarities). It's impossible to understand in one-two or even three viewings and is certain to leave many viewers baffled at the grim nature of the film. Not for the faint of heart or haters of contemplative cinema.

As always, I'll be seeding this film for a while, but once I've got one or two new seeders, you're on your own. Get it while it's hot!

No subs, but very little dialog in the film. This is a second upload due to a fuck up the first time. Sorry.
