In the regular, clock-like world of Newtonian physics, randomness was equated with incomplete knowledge. But scientists in the late 20th century have found patterns in things formerly thought to be chaotic; their theories help explain the unstable irregular yet highly structured features of everyday experience. It now seems likely that randomness and chaos play an essential role in the evolution of the living world-and of intelligence itself.


Roger White\'s discourse exists so far on the fringe of common knowledge that perhaps only a dozen people might understand it--and 11 of them could be lying. It talks of a conceptual revolution having its roots in four separate domains: fractals, chaos, self-organization, and emergent computation. Edwin Newman\'s calm narration handles the complex jargon with ease, and he sounds like he understands difficult concepts like the laws of thermodynamics. For the quotes by the brainy thinkers who wrote them, other narrators, using phony, contrived accents, speak on cue. Because the quotes contain such obscure terminology, the fake accents being attempted render many of the English words unintelligible.
