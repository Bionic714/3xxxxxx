,anarchivist,2007-05-05T22:39Z,"is this for windows vista? because vista has MANY errors with no supported solutions. i am even using the legit home premium, not a bottleg."
,TheDeathCalls,2007-05-05T22:43Z,It's supposed to be compatible (Looking at their site) . Try it and write a comment if it works.
,anarchivist,2007-05-05T23:20Z,"yes, this works with my vista. only time will tell if those pesky error reports will ever go away or not. thanks for the upload, this is a nice clean program. 
p.s.-this program found 293 errors!!
and fixed them"

,murrambingi,2010-09-18T10:02Z,"The .exe in this program has a bug and does not work properly, so what i did was downloaded the proper program here:
http://www.errorexpert.com/download.html
 and then entered the serial from this torrent here:
Serial...: MD27-ECRH-KJ2G-MG7E-PEH2
then blocked it with my firewall so it cant update
and it worked perfect, thx for the upload TheDeathCalls :)"
