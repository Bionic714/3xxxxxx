,crackfiend76,2007-05-09T07:44Z,"anyone tell me a simple (ie complete noob) way to combine the last few episodes/torrents 16-21 on to 1 of 2 dvd's some I'm not wasting a disk burning one file?  eps 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 are combined in 5 episode segments.  How can this be done with the last few episodes....unless deathmule is going to re-issue the torrents in groups like the first part of the season was!!!

send me  mesage and let me know.  "
,sweatyrich,2007-05-09T11:22Z,"@crackfiend76 - Deathmule will normally issue a ""disk"" of 4 or 5 episodes when they're all available, saving you the trouble.

If you *really* want to do it, the easiest way is probably using a free program called ""DVD Shrink"" where you can simply re-author a disk and add the episodes manually.
However, you won't get a menu, and as there's no chapter info for TV progs, you'll only be able to jump to each episode (then visual search).

Best wait for the mule ...! ;-)"
