Anthropological documentaries have allowed us to peek into the exotic life of remote tribes many times. Yet those tribes have rarely been able to pry into our lives. After filming the Insect people in Papua New Guinea last year, Donal MacIntyre brought six over here to witness the British way of life. The result is both charming and revealing. To Chief Joseph and his fellow Papuans, supermarkets, St Paul's Cathedral and leafless trees are objects of wonder. Only when told they cannot meet the head of the Commonwealth (or "Missus Kwin" as they call her) do they appear slightly miffed. But not enough to kill her and eat her, as their ancestors might have done.
