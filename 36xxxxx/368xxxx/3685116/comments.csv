,coretorrents,2007-05-10T22:04Z,"FFS...

THERE IS NO .ZIX FILE IN THIS TORRENT IF YOU LOOK WHEN YOU OPEN THE TORRENT IN YOUR CLIENT YOU WILL SEE IT IS AN AVI...

,crookspank,2007-05-11T02:44Z,"erm ok so i downloaded this torrent without reading the comments.
The file is a .zix, can i watch it without downloading this winzix jobby?
If not then why is there soooo many ppl seeding?"
,Mr_Rasche,2007-05-11T03:08Z,"Got damn niggers, pick some fucking cotton boy, or get the fuck out of my country nigger."
,SeverXP,2007-05-11T07:16Z,"Thanks 4 sharing this file!

Guys, with which antivirus r u finding this winzix, I've just downloaded this *.avi, scanned system with AdAware, SB,  Nod32, opened it and then checked the system again - no Winzix. Do you I need to get special Software to find this shit or is it just fu-ing advertising campaign of W-Zix? 
More than 2977 users downloaded this file, vote somehow more actively! :("
,coretorrents,2007-05-11T09:04Z,"SEEMS ALL THE PEEPS SAYING THIS HAS A .ZIX FILE DONT CONTRIBUTE WHATSOEVER, 

OBVIOUSLY MPAA MIAA PAYED GOONS...!!

Pay them no heed, If you notice they never get into a argument as they know they are wrong..

If I find problems/have complaints I deal with the torrent in question...

Thx all..."
,Colatch,2007-05-11T19:10Z,"I'm thinking about how to say in a polite way, that this is no use of time. How could You be so dumb to seed this? Hey Guys - loss of time - no use - this one's not working at all!"
,Colatch,2007-05-11T21:11Z,The only thing i can get out of this one is a 1:44 min lasting wide green screen! So - nice- go on downloading! :)
,norrisnuvo,2007-05-12T00:31Z,Just a wide green screen. what a load of shit. WANKER
,apollonius,2007-05-13T00:45Z,It IS an .avi file. If your movieplayer won't recognize it as a movie-file just rename the file with .avi instead of .zix
,redhare,2007-05-13T10:14Z,"BitDefender was all over ZIX like what on rice. Loaded with lots of TROJANS and other evil. NOT a better compression program, NOT smaller, NOT faster. ZIX is a scam. These devils should be banned. And look at the 2,413 people passing the evil around. STOP SEEDING THIS SPYWARE MALWARE!"
,jwylie,2007-05-16T02:04Z,"thanks for the up coretorrents. extracted and played on VLC and works a bloody treat!
