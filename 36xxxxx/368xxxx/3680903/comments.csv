First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

I have the CCCP codec back installed, which uses the haali media spliter.  I was not able to get it to play, however, until I started using PowerDVD 7.3 and now everything plays full screen on my 1920x1200 monitor with no lap, skipping, etc. 

Nice rip, thanks for all the seeding."
