Plot: An overly ambitious president schemes to murder a high-ranking general so that he may claim the emperor's throne. But the general proves to be a more formidable adversary than he realized... 

Overview: The team of real-life kung-fu champion Chen Kuan-Tai and director Pao Hsueh-Li was a productive one, resulting in such classic hits as "The Boxer From Shantung", "Man Of Iron" and "Iron Bodyguard". This powerful saga is one of their last together, as well as one of their most sweeping. It tells of the battle between a usurper of the throne and the patriots, led by Chen, who backs a Yunnan Governor just after the revolution.
