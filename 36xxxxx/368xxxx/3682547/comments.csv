Eventually I'll buy the entire first season, but in the meantime I was going to convert all the HD episodes I've downloaded so far with DVD Flick - which takes forever!!! Any info is appreciated."
,Phantom_Stranger,2007-05-15T08:34Z,"All of the episodes were HDTV. Most of the episodes were lol releases, with episode 6 being a notv release, episode 11 a SAiNTs release and episodes 17 and 19 being an fpn release. Except for the fpn releases, the original resolution was 624 x 352. I used ConvertXtoDVD for the conversion. 

I too will buy the first season when it is available, but I thought it would be nice to give back to those who may not be able to acquire them where they live.

Enjoy!"
