,slagathor,2010-09-01T05:56Z,"Does anyone have ""On Any Sunday II""?  This one was a big hit in 1970 (When I saw it the first time), and the II movie in 1971/72 or so was not so big a hit at the box office, but in many ways was just as good.  If you love motorcycles, you've got to love these films.  On Any Sunday is why I took up riding. 40 Years later, I still love watching this movie and would love to see the second one.

Thanks in advance to whoever has it!

,slagathor,2010-09-01T05:59Z,"Oh yeah... btw... Bruce Brown was a friend of Steve McQueen, and the director of both movies.  McQueen financed both films, and is in both films, along with some of the most famous racers of the era.  McQueen talked the Marine Corps into letting the film crew to use virgin (then) beaches on the Camp Pendelton base to film.... just some film trivia for you all!"
