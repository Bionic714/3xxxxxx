,kenny999,2007-05-13T13:57Z,Mauser23 the disc S02D04 contained no menu which I quite don't like; is this one also w/o menu?? Could you please fix?
,stahlnetz,2007-05-16T18:44Z,"kenny999: Stop nagging, be polite.

Mauser23: Thank You!"
,kenny999,2007-05-16T22:30Z,"Sahlnetz you must have overlook the magic word ""please"" which I included in my comment. Mauser23 knows well I am polite.
So don't call me nagger ok?"
,kenny999,2007-05-16T22:31Z,"Btw, this one is OK = with menu."
