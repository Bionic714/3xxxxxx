Could you pause the other downloads till I get this or increase your upload till I get it. Thanks for the share, I have been listening to the tracks in here and they are moving me. For every other person out there, when I get it I will seed to ratio 3, those people should do the same, and so on that is how this works, the original seeders need breaks to share more."
