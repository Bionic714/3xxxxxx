Enochian Chess is a form of divination that acts by non-passive or fatalistic means i.e. you're attempting to program reality by playing the game as opposed to simply scrying possibly events, in addition to this much like everything else in the enochian system, there are multi-level protocols in the form of correspondences to each square (being elemental, hebrew/enochian language, tarot, astrological and geomanticly based) each piece (assuming an egyptian godform) and so fort - the game is four player, one for each element, fire and air work together, water and earth work together, the goal is to land your King (osiris) on the square which is inhabited by the godform Ptah, this square and the angle to play from are choosen based the divinatory question, if the main player loses their king but the allied element succeeds in the objective the goal is still success, each move has some form of divinatory indication to it and the program has some helpful features built in to aid this, although it is best to play through intuition and analyze the results afterward, if you want to really kick some ass try invoking some archetype or energy to aid your playing before the game (I'll take anyone on in this manner) also if you don't have divinatory partners don't worry the game has captured the souls of John Dee, Edward Kelly, Westcotts and Mathers + Wife in some sorta cybernetic ghost matrix to enable you to play against them (although if you want to play w/ the CPU as your ally instead of playing both your angles your forced to use the chump who programmed the game and he's none too wise or helpful in the form of a digital avatar atleast...I will not comment on his meatspace endeavours...) Alas you may do well to pick up a copy the Zalewskis' "Enochian Chess of the Golden Dawn" for further musings/instructions and so forth....
