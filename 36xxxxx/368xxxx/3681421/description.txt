Votergate

Votergate is the investigative documentary feature 
film uncovering the truth about new computer voting systems, 
which allow a few powerful corporations to record our votes in secret.
Votergate speaks directly to voters of all ages, and also to people 
who have never considered voting before. We show minority communities 
most powerful voice is their vote. The film surprises, shocks and 
entertains as characters, like feisty grandmother/rights advocate Bev Harris, 
expose the truth, take on the gatekeepers and hold them to account.
