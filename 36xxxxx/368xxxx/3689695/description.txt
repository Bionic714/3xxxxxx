[re:jazz] - Point of View (2004)

[re:jazz] back into the studio with special guests including: Viktoria Tolstoy, Nils Petter Molvaer, Jhelisa Anderson, Lisa Bassenge, Ultra Nat√©, Nils Wogram, TokTokTok, and others to welcome electronic club hits into the world of jazz.

No nonsence Matthias Vogt puts together an audacious cover album of familier underground eclectic anthems to brilliant effect. Some of the renditions are unbelievable: Ultra Nate covering her classic 'Twisted', Jhelisa doing ' Inner City Life' are INSPIRED!!

The follow up to the phenomenal re:jazz vol 1. 'Point of View' is a majestic and noble journey into recent contemporary favourites. From Soul II Soul's timeless 'Keep on Movin', to Kruder and Dorfmeister's classic and mesmerising 'Deep Shit'. Wondrous acoustic jazz interpretations of modern day electronic classics. Music that is still and will always be characteristic of the present, past and future. A star studded line up includes Ultra Nate, Jhelisa Anderson, Lisa Bassenge and the amazing Viktoria Tolstoy, to name but a few. A truly sensational listening experience.
