If you haven't already got it, get ""MP3+CDG Toolz"" from
http://www.activeaspsoftware.net/default.aspx?p=products%2fproducts

One of it's functions is to make a ""cue-filelist"" which will do what you want in seconds"
,bombertonforty,2008-07-14T06:01Z,"OH YEAH, IT DOES LOADS OF OTHER THINGS..
AND IT'S FREE"
,ddilly,2008-11-04T18:10Z,Holy slow download. I cant wait to get it! At this rate it wil be here next xmas! :(
,thebeast1234,2008-12-31T11:19Z,"I have downloaded this and tried to play the cdg files using Karafun but it doesn't give me the words on screen, do I have to do some sort of conversion for the mp3 and cdg files?"
,najke,2009-05-03T21:21Z,Great! Great! Great! THANK YOU!
,Blackjohn09,2009-06-12T21:07Z,"90% of the .cdg files are damaged and won't play  properly, which is too bad because there were a lot of songs I was looking forward to having. for those of you who haven't started the download yet you might want to take a pass on this one."
,SocklessMissy,2009-09-18T11:35Z,Can someone PLEASE seed?
