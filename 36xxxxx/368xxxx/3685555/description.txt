On a Friday or Saturday night most of our town centres are awash with drunkenness, violence, hooliganism and debauchery. But, according to this documentary, that's nothing new. Joseph Bullman has made a brilliant but disturbing film using real people to illustrate the point. They chuck back vodka shots, snog the face off each other or threaten to punch each other's lights out (and it's not always clear if they're acting or just being themselves). But then they turn to camera and in beautiful English, quote a historical passage describing similar behaviour from a hundred or more years ago. It's highly effective and very clever, but the contemporary footage of real street violence and "cage rage" fights will shock you.
