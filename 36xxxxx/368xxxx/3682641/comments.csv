,joshranwest,2007-05-09T05:55Z,"Amazing torrent, amazing 320 bit sound! A++. Worth the download if you like Mayer."
,Kimmel,2007-10-04T23:36Z,"..and some chicks does love that John Mayer.. ;) 

Nice with the info on the bitrate already in the name - wish everyone would write that.. =) 

(especially when it's true..)"
,mutesound,2007-10-14T11:03Z,still hungry for music? MUTESOUND dot info is the place for you.
,HookerWithAPenis,2008-04-30T16:00Z,"Very good download, 370kb/s  

Thamks man 8D"
,jsherman256,2008-05-09T04:22Z,AMAZING Torrent! Download speeds hit 370 kbps and averaged around 150-200 most of the time. Music quality is also great! Bitrate of 320 just like the name says! 
,NeverEnuf80,2008-05-18T11:12Z,"I wish we'd get more like this. The 320kbps mp3's, or apple lossless aiff or lossless/high rate aac. Why do people rip things at garbage rates? No one is on dialup any more, there's no benefit to a CD shoehorned into a 40MB zip file! Use Apple Lossless or 192-256kbps AAC. If you can't afford an iPod and have some cheap music player that can't do those, then do 320 or 256kbps mp3. Anything can play that.

Thanks hoogly for a good quality, universally usable rip. :-D
Lets see some other albums in this, or Apple Lossless! :-D I have about 30,000 apple lossless songs from my CD collection and will take requests if anyone leaves a request on one of these comments too btw.

I wish piratebay had a request section I could respond to. I don't want to bother uploading files that noone will want. :-/

[V],protoyu,2011-02-23T22:18Z,"Why do people rip a CD in 320kbps, an audio CD is ALWAYS encoded in 128kbps. So its pretty much idiotic to increase the bitrate,DOES NOT EVER INCREASES THE QUALITY JUST THE FUCKIN' SIZE.
It's like converting a 3gp file to 1080p HD. 
""FUCKING USELES """
,HooglyBoogly,2011-02-25T19:08Z,"@spcaxel

You don't have a clue as to what you are talking about. These tracks weren't ripped from a CD in the first place you ignorant waste of space.

Your stupidity astounds me. As does your greedy attitude. Complaining about free stuff. 

FYI: It's spelled 'USELESS'. You should know, because you're the one who is useless. Faggot."
