subs: SCREWY! ..  use subsync to edit subtitles! open subs in SS and remove entire first movie-length of content. somehow the creator entered erroneous information for the entire duration of the film, yet the correct subs are there and are proper, just delete the first ""half"" of them all and save it.  it will work fine!   funny funny movie
