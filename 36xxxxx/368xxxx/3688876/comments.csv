Thank you!"

I'll be patient and then carry the seed for a while.
Huge thanks go out to you for giving me this AMAZING chance at viewing only my second ever Wiseman film (titicut follies was so great!)"
,Boomee,2007-11-24T20:56Z,Thanks! Wiseman's movies are phenomenally powerful.
,scooppe,2007-11-27T17:06Z,Great! Anybody got High School(1968)?
,gonzini165,2008-05-14T00:10Z,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

Could someone please seed? 

I'm stuck at 99.82% - completely depressing to say the least.

Someone please?"
,gonzini165,2008-05-20T01:11Z,"Download completed, thanks. Will be seeding at 1.5 ratio."
,retirer,2008-08-05T03:02Z,"Many many thanks brunosc.

And I'd second scooppe (above) - 1968's ""High School"" would be amazing if anyone had to torrent"
,immanence,2010-02-27T21:26Z,"Fabulous upload! Please, the original uploader or anyone else, if you have more of Wiseman please post! Great stuff!"
