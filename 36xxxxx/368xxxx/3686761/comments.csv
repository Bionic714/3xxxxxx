Are you sure you have written the device id in UPPER CASE?"
,jaxwire,2007-06-01T22:45Z,"I also tried to activate the Benelux map, it gave me a code but it didn't work either, caps or no caps."
,Winzlow,2007-06-04T20:14Z,"Hi
I tyed many times before i got it to work.
The way i solved it:
Put the file in same dir as the map inside the tomtom.
start/run/cmd enter the dir name were u have the map. Then wright: kg_new.exe
Put in the device ID as shown in the info. Worked great for me with SE_FI_DK maps.
Goodluck"

,Troutking,2008-02-01T21:29Z,Will not work with TomTom one second edition series. Please link to a working one if you happend to know of any.
,RonsonDk,2008-03-21T01:50Z,"HOW TO ACTIVATE:
You need this keygen + .mid file from the map (one .mid file per map)

To get the .mid file:
Mount/instert CD with maps - TomTom has to detect the cd/maps
Install a map to your device
Copy it back to your computer, then you get a .zip file
Extract the .zip file, you get your .mid file!
Now use the keygen with the .mid: test4 map.mid

Activate and enjoy!

Sadly, you can't extract the map.cab file, it has to be copied from cd->device and device->pc

You have to choose the right activation key. My maps were for a PNA (One/Go), but installed on on a smartphone, so I chose ""Pocket"" - works great!"
,johncolinpoole,2008-04-15T23:08Z,Hi. Does anyone know where I find the Unit ID for a Pocket PC device (HTC Cruise). ?? I have tried entering the IMEI no but that was all wrong so what do I do? Sorry but Im fairly new to this.
,weeteebee,2008-06-07T17:54Z,"Hello, just did it on my HTC TyTN II
It took some work but it works right now.
Just to try to help others and save them the time i spend:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3686761/TT6_kg_All.z
Use this keygen.. follow the instructions.

IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIND THE DEVICE ID:
THIS IS IN THE PROGRAM TOMTOM 6 NAV. OPEN IT AND CLICK ON THE RIGHT UNDER RECEIVE PICTURE (How many bars you have for sattelites) Then you see a button with the version of TOMTOM you have: CLICK ON THIS AND YOU SEE INFO LIKE ""Language' UNDER THAT IS YOUR DEVICE ID, some like: ANAS6 X8WJ2

Then I didnt get it that you have to go to the Command prompt (start-programs-accessories-Command prompt) VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO THAT

There you fill in the test4.exe ('space') ***card***.mid... you fill in the ID you found in TOMTOM, then you get 3 code... I needed the 2nd (Pocket)... fill this in (watch the text file for further instructions and more clear instructions :P)...

but just wanted to help with those 2 points:
- DEVICE ID IS NOT IN YOUR TEL, BUT IN TOMTOM (see above how to find it in the prog)
- USE COMMAND PROMPT FOR ""TEST4.exe Western_Europe.mid"" and you get your right code (for Palm, pocket and ONE)...

Hope i helped y'all...
THANK YOU FRANSFL!"
,Smurf1969,2008-08-05T14:51Z,"Just a quick update...
