Peter Greenaway's darkest feature to date and my favorite film by the director. Still unavailable officially on DVD. This is the widescreen video bootleg version. The image is quite decent and since it's the only way to see this film for the moment, I don't want to hear anyone complain! :)

As always with me, I'll seed this for a while, but as soon as a seeder or two shows up, I'm out and the torrent WILL die away if no one keeps it alive.

For all fans of Freakyflicks
