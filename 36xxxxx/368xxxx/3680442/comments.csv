,webfilippos,2008-04-06T12:36Z,"Thanx for the upload, but the video quality seems poor. Can't tell why... Like a bad dvd rip and under my opinion it doesn't worth the download if u intent to save the copy. The movie is really great though!"
,webfilippos,2008-04-06T12:40Z,Oops.... I didn't read the uploaders note. Sorry for that. For a VHS rip this is great work man! Thanx!
,madhatter106,2008-04-10T00:05Z,"Move is definitely worth the download.  I think it's available on region 4 DVD, but have never seen a region 1 and doubt that it exists.

Worth seeing in any format, however - I had the treat of seeing it in a theatre (although a print with french subtitles) and it looks amazing on the big screen....great torrent!"
