,Grillbritt,2007-07-13T20:36Z,"I have ""Dirty Disc"" error as well. "
,ViperXxx,2007-07-23T19:30Z,Gaa Wtf should it be soo hard to let us have something that works? Why share something that is not working?
,MeMrB,2007-07-24T03:33Z,"It does work... All you have to do is ftp game to xbox hdd, then replace default.xbe with default.xbe from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3518686/GTA_San_Andreas_XBOX_patched_default.xbe
 works perfectly, hope this helps."
,funbay_swe,2007-07-30T12:51Z,"do i need to copy 2.85 GiB to a cd?

,b0bst3r_,2007-08-25T15:18Z,"Can i get the game from the computer to the xbox with a wire? Or only on a disc?
peace"
,qwerty111,2007-08-30T17:03Z,Game works fine on PAL Xbox without patch but don't get it if you want to use mods. I tried All in One and Hot Coffee and they didn't work.
,Snacko,2007-09-08T13:49Z,det går inte öppna i winrar. vad gör jag för fel

[T],Titi26,2007-10-12T14:14Z,"This is a ´´ISO´´ image, not a rar arhive, so u don´t need to extract, just burn image to DVD using Nero or MagicISO or some other program. "
,Alegriia,2007-11-23T03:17Z,Är det någon som vet om det funkar på XBOX360 eller inte?
,Oberthun,2007-11-26T02:12Z,"Hi, i got this from the site, but it doesnt work on my xbox hdd (old black pal model). I tried downloading the fix from here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3362840/GTA_San_Andreas_FIX
it didnt do the trick. Also tried the mod from here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3369809/Xbox_GTA_San_Andreas_Hot_Coffee_Patch
didnt work. What can i do to make this game run from my harddrive?"
,evilstoat,2007-12-11T17:09Z,"wise up guys if you have modified dash try selecting a different game region in settings until it works if not try unpacking from the iso and re-patching using craxton or similar then re-package the files in an iso using magic iso, or similar app, burn then try again to play it"

,soprano_fan,2007-12-21T05:35Z,"As long as your xbox360 is a PAL version (and has been updated with latest software from game discs) it should work as san andreas is compatible for the 360 :)

Will grab this and then report back if works."

,torrenter_93,2008-07-16T22:45Z,"i downloaded this game, burned it and played. worked fine! i thought. with the time i started finding small fucked up shit like the peds didn't drop any money when you killed them, you couldn't stamp on people when they were on the ground and stuff like that. i don't blame anything on you. i believe that this has something to do with that i burned the game on highest burning speed instead of lowest. anyway. thx for sharing this great game!"
,Ac1d3,2008-07-19T12:58Z,"half the xbox games that i download are already in iso format,all i neeed to do is burn 'em

,xElixerx,2008-09-01T00:07Z,"I know this sounds kind of stupid, but throughout my time here I have never ventured into the game torrent region.
The more I read the more I believe that your xbox has to be modded in some way?
Well my point is that i just wanna kno so that i dont waste my time or waste valuable upload bytes. 

thnx in advance"
,carcar72,2008-09-13T10:53Z,"My son is already plaing, thanks
Just downloaded image and burned it.
However I need an advice, is there any method of browsing image content without actualy trying to play? Even after I burned it to DVD my PC did  not show me any files. does xbox use special dvd format?"

,DumbName,2009-07-12T21:54Z,Thanks Man...!!! Hey Does Anyone Have Gauntlet Seven Sorrows...? Or The Myst Games...? Would Appreciate The Upload A Lot...!!!
,cdarulez0231,2009-07-28T16:44Z,"sweet works great. the peds dont drop money and you cant kick people while their down. i believe there are some files that are for this that may have been deleted in the iso file. but i dont care for i can live without kicking the crap outta people and i earn enough money :P. thanks titi26, all your games work ;).
btw those who have probs with game region. the game is in pal format if you are living in an ntsc region (A.K.A America) then it will not work for you unless you have a modded xbox and use enigmah videoswitcher, it switches your video format from ntsc-PAL with one button. when you go back to play ntsc version games just switch back to ntsc video format. it is that simple."
,theskybeblue,2009-12-05T07:03Z,"perfect again, thanks Titi26"
