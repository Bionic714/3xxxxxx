First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"

---  The problem is there have been a release or two that are either fake or something is wrong.  They contain no video stream.  Most play fine though."
,rc71,2007-05-27T10:42Z,For those that have downloaded some of it please comment on it.  Thanks
,rc71,2007-05-29T15:08Z,"Has anyone gotten this thing to work?  This is one of those no video stream problems.  Not No Video, but editing software that I use on .ts says there is no ""mpeg2 transort stream.""  

Is this another Fake?"
,rc71,2007-05-29T18:51Z,"I've done everything listed nothing.  I've viewed HDTV China's releases before so I don't think they are MPAA fakes, but every tool I've used says there is no MPEG2 Stream like an MPAA fake.  I've tried 2k, XP, OSX, media player classic, vlc, wmp11+sdk, video Redo, NOTHING plays any video.  The link for codec downloads fails to complete.  
IF the codec works, please include it in the torrent.  Thanks."
,rc71,2007-05-31T16:51Z,"Crap!  It DOES Work.
Reinstall a few hundred times and it DOES work.
A nice little write up with the needed software would probably be a good idea.  It would speed up the torrent too as more people share it."
,rc71,2007-05-31T16:53Z,"Instructions to make it work.
1) Reinstall KMPlayer

2) Reinstall Windows media Player 11

3) Reinstall MatroskaSplitter"

,Ghosthands,2008-03-21T05:02Z,"I can play these .ts files fine in WMP but I""m trying to get them into a format that can be played on an xbox 360 (WMC). Either a DVR-MS or WMV HD. Tried video redo and it won't touch these files."
