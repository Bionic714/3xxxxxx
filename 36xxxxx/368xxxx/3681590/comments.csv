,Damascus25,2010-01-03T22:33Z,I am still needing episode #49 from Season Two titled Storybook Rangers Part 2.  It's missing from the full Season Two UL that's on here.  Also all the Full Season UL's for seasons 1-3 have some of the episodes mixed up and numbered in the wrong order.  You can look them up on IMDB.com and find the correct episode order.
,Damascus25,2010-01-05T11:14Z,"Sorry, I was wrong, if you get the Full Season 2 download, the Episode #49 is in there, under the wrong name.  It's toward the end and there are two episodes with the same title, it's one of those, when correcting the track listings and order I mislabeled my own as  Part 1 so my bad."
