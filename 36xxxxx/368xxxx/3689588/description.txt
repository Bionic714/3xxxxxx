This is pretty much the only torrent on the web concerning the sport. The video is in low resolution but still good enough (sorry, but that's the way I found it).


File Format: AVI

Encoding: DivX

Duration: 1:19

It's a pretty good instruction video showing many easy and difficult tricks. It's a little outdated but sports don't change much in such short periods of time.

Enjoy.
