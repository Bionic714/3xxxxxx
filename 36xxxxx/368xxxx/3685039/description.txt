National Lampoon's crazy college antics live on when Van Wilder's best buddy, Taj (Kal Penn), crosses the pond to attend Oxford, where he shakes up the stiff Brits with his irresistible, party-animal style. Taj finds there's much more to do in England than study, and it's a given that his year abroad will go down in Oxford's history as the most wasted term on record. Lauren Cohan, Anthony Cozens, Tom Davey and Holly Davidson co-star.
