HIGH STAKES POKER - QREDDE 
Season 03 COMPLETE SEASON PACK 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 

High Stakes Poker is unique among televised poker series as it does not take place in a tournament setting. Instead, 
the series takes place during a series of high stakes cash games. The minimum buy-in to this game is $100,000. 

Unlike tournament poker, the chips involved represent real money. If a player should lose his initial buy-in, that player 
may rebuy a minimum of $50,000. In addition, players may bring in and use cash instead of casino chips in some situations. 
There is no ending per se. Time just runs out on that particular episode. Also, unlike other televised poker, blinds and 
antes are constant, which is standard with cash games. On the show, the structure is blinds of $300/$600 with a $100 ante 
each hand.
