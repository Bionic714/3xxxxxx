How easy is it to install my version of XP?
1. You will need WinRar to open .RAR files. Open the file \\\\\\\"XP Essential 2.rar\\\\\\\"
and extract the image. 
2. Burn image to CD with magicISO. To do this just open MagicISO
and click the \\\\\\\"Burn CD/DVD With ISO...\\\\\\\" button at the top, browse for the
image, select your burn speed, and click \\\\\\\"Burn it!\\\\\\\"
3. Put the CD in and restart. You should receive a message saying to press
any key to boot from CD, if you do not get this message then you need to
change the boot order in your BIOS settings to boot from CD first.
4. Go through all of the typical XP installation steps...
