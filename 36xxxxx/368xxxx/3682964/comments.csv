,mijj,2007-05-19T08:58Z,"anyone needing Keyboard Layouts that aren't included with Essentail 2:

use the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator dloadable from this page: 
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=8BE579AA-780D-4253-9E0A-E17E51DB2223&displaylang=en

it's easy to use .. create a layout and save it .. then dbl click an exe to make it avail to the sys.

you can use this on an existing xp and save an existing layout and copy over to the problem xp and do the exe thing to install the kbd there."
,Minsar,2007-05-19T19:43Z,"Hmm.. this is weird.. when I mount it in windows I get no auto start and no executable file to run it with.. and It wont boot from the burned cd..
Any one have a clue about this problem?

Thanks in advance"

I didn't like the vista look and IE7, but i am a firefox user, so that isn't a problem.

,shaheed013,2008-01-31T05:26Z,"Help!!!! i just downloaded this. extracted with winzip. then got an iso and mounted the iso with power iso. But there is no setup file?? looked even inside sys32 bt no luck??

what to do? where is the set up file....or even autorun files?? please if any one knows??"
,bikeclips63,2008-02-02T21:31Z,"Burn the iso file to cd. Remember to burn as an IMAGE.
Reboot your pc with this disc in the dvd/cd drive. You need to have this set as the first boot device in the BIOS set up.
The install should start automatically."
