,Twinked,2007-08-02T13:30Z,"Posting this after a few e-mails ive had:

If the number next to Seeders (top right) is 0 - e-mail me. If it has a number then you can torrent it fine.

The code i included will turn the trial version into the full version.

may sound n00bish to some people but i have been receiving e-mails about the above :P"
