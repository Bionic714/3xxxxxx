,death734,2007-05-16T20:05Z,nice job bringing HD content to public trackers which normally is only on a private invite only HD tracker i know of
,Snurre__,2007-06-22T10:10Z,"the movie plays with KMPlayer 2.9.x.exe, FinalCodecs17_0408.exe, MPEG-2 Decoder, hdtvpump-setup-1.0.7.exe, MatroskaSplitter.exe, but it laggs. I got State of the art Hardware (besides my GPU ""Sapphire X1900XT) Plz make a complete idiot guide HDTV China to play your releases"
,Snurre__,2007-06-22T10:12Z,I am tired of reading for hours about codecs that is just in use for a week and then new codecs come and you have to read for hours again!!!!!
,karmaseed,2007-06-27T03:01Z,"Can anyone help with some advice on video decoders and splitters to use to view video?  I can get audio but no video.  I use vlc player, mpc, kmplayer and all sorts of decoders/filters and splitters, but no luck...

Any links to HD video how-to guides would be helpful too.  I really don't know how to view .ts and par2 files, although I've already used quickpar.  Help would be very appreciated!  At least let me know if video is even possible with these."
,Snurre__,2007-06-27T15:20Z,"yes fuck ""hdtv china's"" releases and delete them they are just for confusion."
,Snurre__,2007-06-27T15:22Z,"I can open the first but not the second....
dont bother!!!"
,Redeeman,2007-06-28T23:22Z,these work fine if you just use the right software.. mplayer on linux plays perfectly.
,Gmork_Tulle,2007-07-12T11:40Z,"I finally found a player that will play these files!

Zoomplayer WMV Professional 5.00

It's downloadeable at http://www.inmatrix.com/files/zoomplayer_download.shtml#WMV

It takes a lot of computing power, but it plays.

My Pentium D @ 3,15 GHz can only render approximately 16 FPS."
,AIMBOT,2007-08-01T11:16Z,The VC-1 remuxes are the ones I cannot play. Audio but no Vid. The H.264 releases by this guy played fine. I use the K-Lite Media Player Classic package. This should be the standard. http://www.codecguide.com/index.html
,Krokkedille,2007-08-16T03:40Z,"PowerDVD play VC1 just fine! I think it is the best.
KMPlayer does it well too, but you need Vista or at least Mediapl 11 (WMO) instaled,  K lite MEGA is also a good choice or the Finalcodecs http://www.codecguide.com/download_mega.htm
Basic: if you don't have a powerfull PC use PowerDVD."
,AIMBOT,2008-09-03T03:28Z,Actually when it started to work I realized what good rip this really is. You can turn off the centre channel and lose Attenborough if you like too ... I use Media Player Classic HomeCinema v1.10 and Kite-lite codec pack from http://www.free-codecs.com/ . .. but it is a 2.4 gig core2 duo and nvidea 8800 so it works well This series is worth the trouble ...
