Based on the Japanese comic book of the same name, JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE follows the adventures of Jotaro Josuke and his friends as they travel the Far East in search of Jotaro's mother. Key to the action is the relationship between each character and their psychic partners, known as a Stand. The Stands are used to enhance each characters attributes and powers. Choose from 18 characters each with a unique Stand and battle your way to finding Jotaro's mother. In addition to the standard punch and kick attacks, every player can call upon their Stand to block or attack. But if the Stand takes damage, so does the character, and if the Stand's life meter falls to zero, the character becomes stunned and is vulnerable to attack. If you are a fan of the comic book or are looking for a different kind of fighting game, run out and get JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE.
