,harbones,2007-05-11T15:37Z,"Thanks mate!!
Great speed and quality:) "
,waynedl,2007-05-11T17:38Z,"Doesn't work for me, went through the hassle of getting WinZIX which seems ok althought I prefer winrar and can't see the point in anyone changing..
Tried running the codec which doesn't seem to do anything, file doens't work due to no codec??
I'll d/load a proper version."
,waynedl,2007-05-11T17:45Z,"UPDATE. Just had to remove a load of spamware / spyware, thanks Coretorrents or copier, there's definately something wrong here either the codec file or the winzix - although I've kept winzix on for now.
I don't want or need CID Help, or IPwins, if I did, I'd bloody install the crap myself."
,DanteUseless,2007-05-11T20:08Z,Someone should have their nuts pulled off for this .zix-crap!

,wadizzle,2007-05-12T16:24Z,"Anyone else have a bad sync problem with the audio on this one?
I'll just try another release to see if it's just me."
,Recminds,2007-05-12T16:54Z,Seed this plx =)
,wadizzle,2007-05-12T17:14Z,"On my last comment:
Nero 7 Ultra Edition is having horrible sync problems in Showtime 3.  
So i'm having sync problems with all files now.

Audio and video are good on this torrent.  Good upload."
,burro9876,2007-05-13T06:15Z,"damn, damn, damn: as per the torrent comment, it's true: some pseudo-""people"" are posting bogus remarks about the quality or compatibility of the torrents.  Although I'd already downloaded this episode previously, I just downloaded this one to see if it was good or not.  It is good; good quality, good sound, fast download even.  I'm on a mac, no problems playing it.  

If you use a decent bittorrent client like azureus, you can see the files in the torrent before you actualy download the files; this is an .avi file, no ""rar"" necessary -- obviously  the FUD-posters don't even look at the files involved.  

If you're on a mac and having problems playing avi files, then just download mplayer or VLC (videolan) for mac -- both play just about any format perfectly. (And they have predictably easy macintosh-style installations).  

(It's a sad, sad world we live in.  These people ... these people... these sad, sad people. Soulless, mindless mitmacher, capitalist fundamentalists, puppets of the Man.)"
,redhare,2007-05-13T10:34Z,"Anybody who wraps a compressed file within a compressed file is hiding the internal file type so you have to download it completely and then decompress to find it's ZIX. TOTAL BULLSHIT that the movie industry is making these comments. BitDefender 10 belong to the movie industry???? Then why is BitDefender 10 all over the ZIX.EXE download like white on rice because of all the TROJANS AND MALWARE in the ZIX DOWNLOAD. ZIX does NOT compress better or faster or smaller than RAR or WINZIP. Yeah, the trojans aren't in the torrent but they ARE in the decompression program download you force people to use."
,evo_master,2007-05-16T00:03Z,Jeeee its over 550 seeder just download
,sueee,2008-05-21T07:14Z,"Thanks coretorrents, missed out on the rest of season 6 and 7 when is disappeared from TV. Thanks to you I can catch up. LOVE you coretorrents."
