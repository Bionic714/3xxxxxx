,santo1989,2007-05-05T08:06Z,"anybody downloaded it yet ? 

is it any good ?

Don't wanna waste my time downloading something that might not even work.

1 comment will not suffice me .."
,jupiter12,2007-05-05T09:10Z,"if yoy wanna know how its works you can download  the sample ""mvs-sp3-sample.avi"" if you have a good torrent client like azureus or botcomet!!"
,Bamimi,2007-05-05T12:07Z,"darkwood wtf are saying? for anyone who downloads anything they thoink is passworded. set the nfo file on high priority, read it after it takes the whole minute to download it, if its passworded don't download it. this is avi files though so I'm thinking it isnt passworded. not sure yet as the pricks could of just renamed .zip/rar/etc into .avi and tell you to rename them to unarchive with the pw in the nfo, but thats my initial thought anyways."
,Bamimi,2007-05-05T12:11Z,also take the time to type in uploader: and check to see if whomever uploaded whatever tends to upload a bunch of crap or passworded stuff. people who do that lame stuff tend to do it multiple times/account. not hard to find em once they've done it already.

,Lester_Diamond,2007-05-08T18:26Z,"They could have made Spiderman 3, 4 and 5 with all the shit they crammed into this movie. 2 and a half hours long and I sat through this at the theater. I would advise everyone to download this and watch it at home so that you can take breaks.

The movie is ""ok"". If you liked 1 and 2, then you'll like this one too. It's basically the same shit."
,lane75,2007-05-08T20:01Z,"Please spare us from comments on how this movie sucks. Nobody gives a shit what you think and are going to download it anyway. Instead thank mVs for their effort of bringing us this movie a couple of days later than the world premiere. And in my, and almost the rest of the worlds', opinion; this IS a good movie.  "
,kenander,2007-05-08T20:19Z,How Do you mount Subtitles??!!
,lane75,2007-05-08T20:28Z,"... Ohh, and by the way: thanx dimetrius! I'm also so fuckin' tired of hearing people yap about aXXo (who's  a king in his field) when they can't see, or understand the difference between a DvDrip and a TS, R5 DVDScreener etc. A DvDrip has its source from, that's right, a DvD; and dvd:s aren't usually  released untill a couple of months after the movies' premiere."

,Pfc_biggins,2007-05-09T00:45Z,"Wow, Lane75 buddy, you got to calm down and remmeber that comments can be good and bad. Thats what there here for. Don't get me wrong, I personally liked the movie. But I can agree with some of the critiscism its recieved. The movie was long and crammed. They really could have split it in half and made two movies out of it. I also thought the charecter could have had more depth. Unlike previous spiderman movies, I felt this one didn't get you connected on a personal level with the new charecters. But even with the problems. I still liked it and am looking forward to another sequal.

Oh and FYI Lane75, the rest of the world felt like the movie was lacking as well. Reviews have really been on the low side."

,La_fertilidad,2007-05-13T00:40Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3685681/The_Secret_Life_of_Plant_(1979_Documentary_-_Very_Rare)

Type: Documentary
Rating: NR
Running Time: 96 Minutes
Directed by: Walon Green
Soundtrack: Stevie Wonder

The thesis of this visually stunning documentary feature is that plants have feelings, too, and that they have a variety of ways of expressing them. Based on the best-selling book by Peter Topkins and Christopher Bird, the custom of talking to one's houseplants is strongly recommended by the filmmakers. Though scientific in tone, the film does not air the opposing view advocated by, perhaps, a majority of scientists. One highlight of the film is its original musical score by Stevie Wonder. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide"
,Sjuns,2007-05-14T09:17Z,"It's ok quality compared to a dvdrip.
It's worth downloading if u can't wait for the dvdrips.

Video: 5/10 (A bit blurred)"

How can you burn avi files?

try using nero, it encodes avi to VCD or DVD"
,miller198,2007-06-23T18:33Z,"i prefer to use super dvd creator or vso x to dvd to convert mt avi`s

alternitivly you can buy a dvd player that supports divx.
