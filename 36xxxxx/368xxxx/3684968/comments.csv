,Olivermannen,2007-05-10T14:45Z,Thanks =)
,La_fertilidad,2007-05-10T16:17Z,"Works flawless

thx.................

can someone please tell me what's the ACE VMware Workstation Edition?

this option can be chosen in the keygen, also the older versions of VMware can be selected, plus Linux version keys.

:-)"
,La_fertilidad,2007-05-10T16:20Z,"Sorry and why is there a floppy option always as default??

who uses this anyway!

any tips running VMware6 on Vista Ultimate, please post here or please also post to my user name, thx a lot."
,cyricm2007,2007-05-10T16:42Z,I wish I know what the ace was. I haven't found a use for it yet.  
,cyricm2007,2007-05-10T17:03Z,The About screen don't say it beta. All I know is the  it won't stop work after 30 days.
,Znuttisan,2007-05-10T19:31Z,"ACE is an concept to store a VM-image on a USB memotystick and then you can boot your ""PC"" on the memorystick and run it on ""any"" device that have an USB-port. 
It's like any PC that you can ""bring"" with you.
REALLY COOL.... "
,cyricm2007,2007-05-10T20:29Z,"I'll have to find a usb drive to that.  

I like linux, but I'm not ready for it to be my main system yet."
,mflson,2007-05-10T21:25Z,"I've done some research. And as far as I can tell, this is the first final version.

I must say that I got a little suspisious when a keygen was released less that 24 hours after the appl. was released.

But this is the real deal.

So... Time to get virtual!

And remember folks. If you like, buy it."
,sensimilla,2007-05-10T21:33Z,"The Keygen does not generate key for linux version 6.0  only for older linux versions

Just switched to ubuntu but am still use a virtual xp for some things. 
hope a linux keygen comes out before my beta expires"
,cyricm2007,2007-05-11T01:53Z,"The linux keygen wil come out in a few days or so.


You know the linux comminty will come out with it sonner are later."
,jennysalala,2007-05-11T02:08Z,"I use to be like you cyricm2007. Now Linux is basically an everyday operating system. The only thing it was lacking was games. So I just waited until Cedega 6 came out and got it. Now I can play all my favs at full speed.

Everything that is important in Windows is on Linux. Examples are word processors, internet browsing, e-mail clients, file management, photo viewing, video viewing and now games. 

You should be able to easily slide in once you get used to it. Also ACE is amazing. I take my OS everywhere on my 4 Gig. Works great."
,cyricm2007,2007-05-11T02:35Z,"I did mine it that way. 

I like linux in the fact in don't crash liked Windows.  I see the fact it the games market in a little slow to make games for linux. 

Please not think I was trying to say the linux comminty just did that.  I'm new at this trying to find keygen and serils.  I just found about linux about 3 are 4 yours ago. I don't know to much about it.  All I know it what the Windows   comminty  is tell me about it. 

But I'm Will to leran more about. Nut I don't know how to talk to about it.    I'm Sorry about this. I didn't mine to the way you it was read."

,ryanbrancel,2007-05-11T07:00Z,Why RAR this?  All I need is the keygen...
,cyricm2007,2007-05-11T21:45Z,Why in a rar and zip file I was trying to make it smaller so the download was faster.
,g_ij_s,2007-05-11T22:16Z,Please do not submit crap. This file is downloadable from www.vmware.com and the keygen is plain wrong. 
,cyricm2007,2007-05-11T22:47Z,The keygen work for me.  I had to use the ace edition key.  
,g_ij_s,2007-05-11T23:26Z,"Weird because it says version 5.5. I downloaded another keygen and now it works... 

I would use the free edition of VMWare server if it worked on Vista."
,cyricm2007,2007-05-12T04:46Z,"That Weird for me to. It first I thougt the keygen was bad to. As I said I had to use the ace key on it.

With all keygen there is a a few bad keys or so."
,DocNielsen,2007-05-15T01:11Z,"well someone link us to a good keygen please.
채nd if you can find a linux keygen that would be great"
,cloroformio,2007-06-04T15:04Z,"ACE stand for Assured Computing Environment and is a precious feature in deployment of secured networking environments. You can create an installation package of a certain O.S. e decide the network access policies (with extremaly configurable firewalling rules). Also, the Virtual O.S. don't need vmware installation to run, but only the player, self installed by the package. This feature is a great add-on for lab admins....

,pchawk,2007-06-27T09:26Z,questions to ... jennysalala ... i will like to know what Linux OS are you using?? thanks for your time
,cyricm2007,2007-06-27T18:01Z,"Just to update some older commnets.  The non ace work for me.  I had to reinstall the os, Vista is carp the bed on me."
,heavensrevenge,2007-06-29T14:01Z,"yes, it's nice running my XP install straight from linux (sidux)  :)"
,jclark2289,2007-07-04T06:59Z,"Be careful.  After installing this I found this lovely gem installed on my PC:
http://forums.speedguide.net/showthread.php?t=184060

haven't installed anything else.  NOD32 and AVG both show the install package and keygen exe's as clean though...  Maybe I slipped up somewhere else, just an FYI.  My install works fine too."
,Espionage724,2007-09-06T01:18Z,"Downloaded This A Few Days Ago. Works Perfectly! Just Not On My Computer (512MB Ram, 1.6 Celeron

,asrkol,2008-04-09T17:14Z,Is this the windows vista ver?
,w0tness,2008-05-26T06:03Z,CRC error when extracting the zip from the rar. 
,danny85,2010-01-08T21:08Z, you can download vmware workstation 7.0  and keygen here  http://tips-linux.net/en/content/vmware-workstation-70-windows
,80hd,2010-05-04T06:51Z,"VMW 7 blows. I can't stand when software was written under the assumption that the user is retarded. 

They need to get rid of the wizrds, kill the auto-setups and just go back to blank slates that let power users get shit done without having to kick down some doors first."
