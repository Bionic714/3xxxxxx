I bring you resident evil vol 1.
This is a movie that has been inspired by the video games bye the same name.
The movie is very good, has a high budget ( i think ) but this movie is so not better than resident evil vol 2. 
But you cant see number 2 without seeing number 1.

This movie is also a MUST in your zombie collection, i belive that this movie is the reason land of the dead arrived, George A. romeo got jaloux, i think :P

This movie is also a full scale dvd ripped by my self, so subs are incl.

Cheers.
