[V],Kuthumi,2007-05-21T17:19Z,"I get no sound for the film. Not in WMP, not in PowerDVD, not on my standalone player. Really embrarassing after the initial bragging about digital remix with dolby surround. Strange that it has been dl 23 times without anyone warning the others, although it has gotten complicated to log in here."
,DTSES,2007-05-22T23:35Z,"There are no Dolby soundtrack on this realese, it's tagged DTS-ONLY quite clear. For the first you must choose DTS in the menu and then your software must support DTS sound. If you have this on your standalone player then you must hook it up to a seperate surround system that support DTS to have any sound."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-05-24T08:11Z,"Surely, the dvd also must include a normal Dolby soundtrack so that all people can use it. The special thing with this edition is the re-mastered stereo sound, whereas all previous versions have had mono. Could you please give us an upload with a normal soundtrack?"
