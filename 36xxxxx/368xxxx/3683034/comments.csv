,erkyesosze,2009-03-26T16:44Z,"Wow! The 1st 20mins sounds soooo damn good.. Amazing rip! visuals + audio.... stuck at 91.3%.. which means only the audio is coming through for me, none of the video wants to play correctly at all (just freezes up)..... Any chance anybody would ever be seeding this again? :( I realize its an old torrent now... almost 2 years old.. anybody?"
