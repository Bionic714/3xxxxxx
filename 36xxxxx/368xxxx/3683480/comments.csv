,420dopeman,2007-05-12T19:22Z,"Thanks for info mate.  No sure why german stuff will not work, may be that it requires the german languages to run prop, which of course I ripped.

thanks bro keep up the good work"
,Goldenwolf99,2008-07-09T00:30Z,"Since dopeman hasn't said anything for while, I'm gonna go ahead and post the fixes to the problems I've found. (Also since half the people downloading this are too stupid to read through the comments).

1. THIS CAN RUN ON VISTA.

2. To run this on vista, download the Brothers In       
Arms Road To Hill 30 1.0 crack from  gamecopyworld.com or gameburnworld.com and place it in  the Earned In Blood folder that you extracted and just launch the game from there.

3. If you get the cannot find maps Sk_de_ city fight error half way through the game, go in to your Earned In Blood/Maps folder and rename the two SKR_de_cityfighting to SK_de_city fight (just take off the R in SKR and the ing off of fighting)

THIS IS A WORKING RELEASE 

However there were a few missing textures for me. I don't know if this because of the the release or my computer. They're not that noticeable though."
,borg9306,2008-07-09T15:52Z,plese seed :)

,heavenzmovi3,2008-07-22T20:34Z,"kinda disappointed in this one, dopeman. your games usually work for me, but this one was a no go. i tried every fix there was; scoured through every comment.. but sadly, nothing worked. oh well, Hell's Highway comes out soon, so no biggie."
,grimlygrom,2008-07-31T07:36Z,"omg dopeman, you kickass"
,mixedupmxer,2008-08-14T23:36Z,"Here is how you FIX every GERMAN skirmish map. If just renaming does not work.. make a copy of the orginal files and rename the copy and put it in the folder. So you have the non-renamed ones and the renamed ones.
In the Maps Folder rename:
On the *.prl files rename the same name as *.gbxmap but after SK_DE_ keep the first letter in the file capitalized and the rest lower cased.
EXAMPLE: (SK_DE_Holdingtl.prl)

SKR_DE_HAMLET.gbxmap
to
SK_DE_SEIZETHEH.gbxmap

SKR_DE_CITYFIGHTING.gbxmap
to
SK_DE_CITYFIGHT.gbxmap

SKR_DE_DDAYDROP.gbxmap
to
SK_DE_DDAYDROP.gbxmap

SKR_DE_HOLDINGTHELINE.gbxmap
to
SK_DE_HOLDINGTH.gbxmap

SKR_DE_WAREHOUSE.gbxmap
to
SK_DE_WAREHOUSE.gbxmap


Hope this Helps."

My first problem seems to be that the main folder and sub-folder ""Earned"" is protected so that i can't rename or move...this annoys me to great extent. Try to remove it but it automaticly re-protects itself. Yes im on Vista btw.

Got any solutions to this one?
Haven't tried deleting it yet, but i've got a bad feeling about that too...

Once I'd unrared the d-load I ripped straight into playing the game in single player, skirmish. All good but got killed before taking out the bunker, before getting near it. It happens eh.
Closed game for few hrs, restarted and ckicked Tutorials. Here the problem is: Black screen, no sound, Ctrl+Alt+Del to Task Manager and it shows BIA-EIB as running. Gave it 10minutes to find its feet but no-will-go.
Probably won't need a tutorial, probably simalar keys to lot other games. I'll try and see.
I'm also d-loading Hells Highway and Road to Hill 30. They're as low as shit too!!!!!!
But they not your uploads 420dopeman
Now, to see about staying low & staying alive : )"
