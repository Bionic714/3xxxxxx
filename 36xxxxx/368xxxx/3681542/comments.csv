,u774,2007-05-06T00:54Z,Thanks very much for this.  I got the program already and it works great.  I've been eagerly awaiting the help files to go with it - am downloading now and will help seed for a while after I get it...
,WereWlfie619,2007-05-06T11:00Z,"Please bear with me people, as I've stated before, the ISP's here suck, slow ups and even subject to scheduling.

I wish I had cable.. :s"
,swtchdf,2007-09-24T21:27Z,"great, downloaded it, mounted, attempted to install but whats this? missing microsoft.vsa.xml in install_disk_1\Install_Disc_1\Win\Microsoft.NET\Framework\URTInstallPath\

excellent! 3gb downloaded to be put to waste by a 60kb file!

apparantly i cant compile quake3 without this version of vc++ (thx microsoft) and i cant find a legitimate copy of this program."
,swtchdf,2007-09-24T21:29Z,"actually it seems ALL of the xml install files are missing...

wtf did you do to cause this? wtf did I do to cause this for that matter? :P"
,swtchdf,2007-09-24T21:35Z,"pff ok now its not letting me install due to a missing dll

""microsoft.visualbasic.compatibility.dll""

please, dont waste peoples time by uploading unusable incomplete files, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY EXCEED 3GB + HAVE SLOW SEEDERS"
,chikodef,2007-10-31T05:46Z,"thanx!!!
Everything is OK with this release. Burn or mount ISOs with DAEMON Tools and install."
,frisky dingo,2007-11-15T03:29Z,"Works great.  Key is automatically entered.
 Thanks!"
,kiasta,2007-11-24T15:25Z,"What exactly do you have to di to install this?  I can't install from disc 1 it keeps telling me a program needs a system restart, and after restarting 3 times it still says that, I insert the prereq cd and it tells me to insert the disc 1 cd.  Uh wtf!?  Does this actually work or was it a waste of my time to download?"
,kiasta,2007-11-24T15:44Z,Ok well I guess 4th restart is a charm o.O?  Well it is installing now...but I don't understand why it took 4 restarts meh microsoft is shit anyway i just need this for my classes.
,chikodef,2007-12-04T00:10Z,"Please feel free to download the latest docs for this. Look for ""Microsoft MSDN Library January 2006 for Visual Studio 2003 by ZW"" or just click on my nick!"
,derrekito,2008-01-01T15:43Z,"Disc 1 is missing files, the xml files can be ignores, however the .dll files cannot.  then I had to sit for a 15 min roll back.  Sigh.

 found: l:\Win\Microsoft.NET\Framework\URTInstallPath\microsoft.vsa.xml.  Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.
[01/01/08,07:32:14] Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Architect 2003 - English: [2] ERROR: Error 1308.Source file not found: l:\Win\Microsoft.NET\Framework\URTInstallPath\microsoft.vsa.xml.  Verify that the file exists and that you can access it."
,derrekito,2008-01-01T15:57Z,"Works fine if you de-select Visual Basic, MS Designers, ?????? from the install (looks like I'm not the only one who hate that language).  Fucking sucked to have to sit through [X] number of installs and roll backs to get this POS to work.  Still less painful than forking over the cash for this to only use the c++ compiler ONCE.  Thanks for the upload, but please test your uploads and gives us a heads up next time :p ."
,derrekito,2008-01-01T16:01Z,Scratch that (sorry for the spam) more files come up as issues.  Sigh and I cant figure out how to remove MS Designers from the install.  WASTE OF TIME.
,AntiCMOS,2008-03-11T09:24Z,"For those getting the missing XML files (and later on during the process, other missing files).  I saw someone installing and getting the same problem.  The cause was that they mounted all three disks as separate drive letters, while the setup program tries to read the installation off one drive letter only (for all disks).

Unmount your installation drive, and remount the next disk when the first missing file is found."
,Joe.Lind,2008-05-23T20:35Z,Thanks - will return with status on how the installation goes. Seems like many have issues... 
,LavaElf,2008-09-17T13:01Z,"Thanks for the torrent, I'll be sure to seed once I'm done."
,rtay7,2008-12-20T05:39Z,This is the real deal. Downloaded the iso images and burned on cds then installed the 2 cds of Visual Studio and the pre-requisite without a single problem. Thanks uploader!
,Iamazn,2009-07-05T06:40Z,Is this Visual Studio 2003 pro?
,joler1302,2009-08-12T15:03Z,Thx man!
,octa0998,2009-11-07T22:56Z,"Works Great ! Thanks uploader

,Matty_Matiss,2011-04-22T18:19Z,"I had the problem with xml files, then I followed the advice and now it's staying at the file 'microsoft.vsa.xml' for half-hour. What's wrong at this time?"
,Matty_Matiss,2011-04-22T18:58Z,"oh, sorry. simple reboot, and all problems are solved)"
,smartrey,2011-05-26T12:44Z,"Very Nice installer. I was able to intall this in my Windows 7 Toshiba Laptop without any single Error.

All you have to do: 
A. Use any ISO reader like PowerISO to mount the ISO file for installation. 
1. Run first the Prequisites Disc
2. Then Run Install Disc 1 & 2 (You need to temporarily extract all 1-3 Cd's in a temporary files, then continue installation.
3. Same process with # 2.

Thanks for uploading!
