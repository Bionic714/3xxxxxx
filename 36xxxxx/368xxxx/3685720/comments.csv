ok you fucking moron, this is why i put this in the ""movie DVDR"" section. first this is a DVDR you dipshit, and second if i did put this in the TV section i would get comment after comment about why this is not in avi format. this is in the DVDR section, so people should know what  ""VIDEO_TS"" files are, ""VIDEO_TS"" files is DVD format, just like an ""iso"". read the comments below, that is what im talking about. i dont mind helping people out, but these type of comments would run rampid, if i posted this in the TV section. now SHUT THE FUCK UP

Hello! I have some problems with DVDR files. When I've downloaded them, it's just a lot of small files in a map. Is this how it is suppose to be? ""

first download nero (you can get nero from any torrent site) install and open nero. pick ""DVD-video"" then press ""NEW""

find the ""VIDEO_TS"" files and move them over to the left hand side

now just press burn and your done. now you can watch this on your stand-alone DVD player

if you dont want to burn these files to a DVD, these programs will play the ""VIDEO_TS"" files on your PC

all these players will work

,Old Grey,2007-05-13T14:05Z,"Hey Deathmule, thanks again for the fantastic contents. Ignore the idiots, im sure they will settle down once their mothers have read them a story and settled them down to bed.

It seems ironic that thousands of happy campers are downloading your stuff but super loud voices of discontent come from one or two people."
