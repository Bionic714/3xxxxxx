Anyway, thanks for the release :) I'll d/l it now and check it on my xbox tomorrow ;)

You are great. Ever considered posting some games for Xbox hardcore fans who still have the good old black box under our TVs? :) Will help you with seeding, promise :)"

,Lennert,2007-05-16T20:45Z,"GasGiver.. Got a question..

I buyed the Excuter Front Panel and i got a usb-keyboard and i works.. But i cant use the Æ Ø Å that is used much in scandinivia. Can you help. I'm using YouTube2 wery much and i'm tired of not could searce whit the letteres in. Please help..
And if i want too copy a song from the Pc to the Xbox like ""Fødselsdags sang til Bølle"" it would look like ""F_dselsdags sang til B_olle"" :(

Can you make it right?

I thank you for the this great project! Its the best.. Allways using your versions..! :)"
,GasGiver4711,2007-05-21T12:38Z,"Lennert : Sorry, cannot help you with the Keyboard Stuff, maybe one of your Scandinavian mates can help you there. im pretty sure that using your special characters in the FatX File System the Xbox uses will not be possible. Also FatX only allows 32 chars in length which is bad for mp3s, too. There are some automatic FatX Renamer programs out there. Look for them on xbox-scene.com"
,Lennert,2007-05-21T22:31Z,"Okay Gasgiver:)

There is a bug in the LCD system..

If you says that the lcd light should be turned off when you watch a movie, and after you had watched the movie, i will not turn the light on again?? :(

Sorry my english.. Do you know where i should look after the charteres.. I will give it a try and give you an feedback if i can make it work..
