Someone recently posted Fusa Riot and Nhu Golden Era on Demonoid. I've posted those torrents here. An additional note-- Fusa Riot was encoded at 192Kbps while Nhu Golden Era was encoded at 128k AAC. Neither are my preference, but something is always better than nothing. My recommendation is to download the VLC media player. Also I've asked the orginal seeder to please provide a lossless version of both albums when he returns from vacation in June. Please enjoy and seed!
