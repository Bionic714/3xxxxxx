thank you elsebasbe :P"
,john1974,2007-05-13T00:34Z,Why would someone label this file HDTV when in fact this file has nothing to do with it other than having been created from a HDTV source? The resolution is only 1/4th of minimum HD resolution (1280x720). How about releasing it in higher resolution?
,jnd,2007-05-13T02:53Z,"It's labelled HDTV because that's the source, but I agree it's confusing and don't get why it was reduced in size. They can be compressed and retain quality pretty well even at 4 GB, as e.g. the Fifth Element rip showed."
