Here's a collection of scanned maps from a Cities of Harn RPG guide I used to have.  There are 7 city maps, and 1 map of the whole country of Harn. Note that the corresponding black and white maps aren't simply monochrome scans of the original colour maps, but are designed to be as bare as possible to allow notes and keys to be added.  Download one of each and you'll see what I mean.

The map of Coranan is A2 size (twice the size of the others).
