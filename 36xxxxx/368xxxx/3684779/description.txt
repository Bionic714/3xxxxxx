Formed in early Spring of 2005, Within Reason brings together a calloborative sound of alternative rock mixed with hip-hop influenced lyricism.
Within Reason frontman [Chris Dow] and drummer [Grif Zarbough] met through a mutual friend in the Fall of 2004. As a result, Missouri native and guitarist [Mook] hooked up with the crew after playing house sessions for two years with Grif. Shortly after, guitarist [Kevin Smith] joined the band after meeting with Dow at a Shade Tree show in Birmingham. Coincidentally, the last addition to Within Reason was former Shade Tree bassist [David Koonce]. Since playing their first show In August 2005 at the CopperTop in Tuscaloosa, AL, Within Reason has lit up the Birmingham scene. 
With influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Guns and Roses, and Linkin Park, Within Reason?s energy will keep fists clinched and bring crowds to their feet.
