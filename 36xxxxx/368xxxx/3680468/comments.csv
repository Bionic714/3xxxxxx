BTW this is the first time I've made a torrent. What I did was leave the .torrent file where it was left when I hit publish, and also opened it (for some reason it asked me to save, even though i'm publishing).

-And no, I will not use a non-standard bittorrent client! nor will I stop using IE!!! "
,tylerthedruid,2007-05-04T12:36Z,"Grrr so I'm unable to download it from another computer on my lan. I know for a fact that my switch (my ISP does the routing, supposedly they block no ports) is not blocking any ports.

I have no firewall software because I'm so sick and fucking tired of goddamned firewalls and antivirus software considering I've never gotten a goddamn virus in my life.

I'm just tired of all the fucking software and bullshit that strives to make it impossible for a port to fucking remain open. I mean I can't even fucking play NWN2 because fucking ports are blocked by god knows what force-it-down-your-throat windows bullshit and god knows what ridiculously useless none-of-your-business goddamned software that has protected my own fucking PC from ME against my own goddamned will or knowledge."
