Artist with talent are sometimes forgotten by mainstream media...

This home made CDr was recorded by Jonathan Edwards, a guitarist singer composer from London, Uk - this need to be proven since I have no info at all about this artist -. I got this Cdr in a second hand store...
Jonathan plays 2 jazz covers: Mahna De Carnaval; Summertime and one of his own composition - so much in love - which is rather a stuning pop ballad song - the chorus is a killer....
For music lovers only!!!
Comments welcomed to tell me more about this artist..if you know him and your comments about the music!!
