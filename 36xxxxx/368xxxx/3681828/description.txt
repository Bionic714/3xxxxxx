From Autumn to Ashes' 1st and 2nd albums in mp3 format, all put in one .zip file.

Too Bad You're Beautiful (with 4 bonus tracks)
The Fiction We Live 

Just a quick rip in windows media player at 192 kb/s.  Nothing special.
I've been trying to download TFWL for some time now since my cd's were stolen, and I finally 

went out and repurchased it.  

Please, if you like what you hear, take a trip to your local music store and support the 

people that made the records.

Feel free to notify me with any problems you have with any files.
