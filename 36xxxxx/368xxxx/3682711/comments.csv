,msh123,2007-05-07T23:44Z,Varfรถr finns inga som seeder?
,Huganon,2008-02-24T14:40Z,"These aren't so good, the files are not compatible with Windows Media Player, a multi-zone dvd player or a Playstation. The only program I have been able to get these working on is VLC Media Player, and even that is no so crash hot either. Any ideas on how to get these files working on a DVD Player, I'd rather watch them on a bigger screen than sitting at the computer"
,vIce-gRip,2008-03-05T01:10Z,"Don't now that I'd waste my time on this TOR. I and about 20 others appear to be stuck at 83%. With only 1 seeder noted... but NOT presently seeding it is a waste of bandwidth. It seems as if most of us are just re seeding the same 83% but that is it. I will let it ride another week, but if a 100% seeder does not allow throughput it is a useless TOR, and that is a shame as the other Trilogy is a PAL and I don't want to have to convert.
SEED PLEAZE!"
,Huganon,2008-03-09T22:19Z,"Further to the previous problems noted, both episodes one and three freeze the DVD about halfway through VOB_3, I don't recommend this torrent at all, nothing but hassles."
,ChuckemuHaven,2008-04-02T14:52Z,"Ok I successfully downloaded the ISO files, now how do I burn them onto a DVD so my DVD player can read them?

Will Discjuggler Trial version burn them for me?
I wasted 2 Blank DVD-r, and hasnt worked, please help, or recommend me what burning program to use and what are the configurations I need to make the burn work on the Advanced tab, please help, thanks."
,CaptainBeefheart314,2008-04-15T15:36Z,"IDIOT!!!! I can't believe I downloaded this! How do you rip a DVD to ISO and then eliminate all the menu's active functions? Now everyone who's going to download this can burn it in a perfectly nice DVD, with menu's that don't work and VOB's that play separatedly... you've really done me in man, with uploads counted, I've wasted over 25Gig of my LIMITED download on this f*cker, and now I can only see little itty bitty pieces of the movie at a time, with no guarantee whatsoever if the spoken or texted language will remain intact during VOB handovers. I'll do it my self next time, but don't count on me uploading it.
For the one asking how to burn onto a disk ( if you still wanna waste your time with that ): use Nero or InfraRecorder, select Burn Image in the menu structure!!!
Thanks for nothing, 
BG"
,ravenx20,2008-05-15T07:02Z,"If its iso files, just use daemon tools on you computer to view it like an actual dvd. If you want to burn it to a disc, just load the iso up on daemon tools and then you dvd decryptor to ""rip"" the dvd off the iso into a dvd folder. Then you use any burning software to burn it and bam! plays just like a regular dvd!! "
