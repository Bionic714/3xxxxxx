,Darthosx86,2007-05-09T18:32Z,"Nope what is actually on their homepage is an update, around 12.7 mb. This download will not allow you to install it, as it first searches for the Airport utility 5 full version.

The files on apples homepage:

Apple AirPort Base Station Update 2007-001
http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/application_updates/airportbasestationupdate2007001formac.html

And: AirPort Extreme Update 2007-003

Those are as the name states NOT the actual Airport Utility 5 but requires it before they will install. So if you don't have the application - there is no way to install it. Trust me Airport Utility 5 is not on apples homepage - otherwise I would have found it."

I can supply the entire hemisphere with this connection - no sweat. The internal Lan connection where I am sitting is a 1000 Gbit - so please bring it on, I will seed forever."
,theredking,2007-06-12T21:28Z,Much appreciated! I looked for it on their site too.

,Darthosx86,2007-09-16T11:22Z,"I am re-seeding. I didn't die, but was having trouble with my OSX86 partition - my triple boot mashine is now back online."
,tylerdean,2012-04-08T17:01Z,"what is this? it was just a shortcut and didnt do anything. and Darthosx86, your link just brings me to the apple downloads page..."
