Jethro Tull are an English rock band that formed in 1967-1968[1]. Their music is marked by the distinctive vocal style and lead flute work of front man Ian Anderson. Initially playing blues rock with an experimental flavour, they have, over the years, incorporated elements of classical, folk and 'ethnic' musics, jazz and art rock. Eclectic influences, diverse instrumentation, and often elaborate song construction led them to be labelled as an archetypal "progressive rock" band.

Original Masters is a greatest hits album by Jethro Tull released under Chrysalis Records in 1985. It was the band's third such effort, the first two being M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull and Repeat - The Best of Jethro Tull - Vol II. Although the compilation was released in 1985, it does not include material released after 1977. Note that the first two compilations had already covered material released exclusively up to 1977 and Original Masters rehashes much of their material.
