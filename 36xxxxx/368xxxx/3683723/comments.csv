[V],Slickinator,2007-05-08T19:43Z,there was a version of this that had a virus out there but this one does not have the virus trust me the other one had a yellow setup.exe which was a self extracting virus package this is just only the setup and crack enjoy and don't jump to conclusions just because of the same name as one that had a virus before
,KabelKrull,2007-05-08T19:59Z,Kaspersky doesn't report any virus.
,shango,2007-05-12T22:30Z,There is a virus in here.. 6 total several different trojans embedded in the .exe file do not download or share this.
[V],Slickinator,2007-05-15T02:53Z,"OnCE AgaIN this is not the same release as the other Explosion ones out there ok this is strictly the NON virus Download  so Don't Again Assume Something With out Checking and getting Your Story Straight thanx  and this copy if fine all ok thanx check other copys out there you may notice my file size is smaller , is that a hint? mmmm maybe lol"
,z400boyatvking,2007-06-09T12:04Z,i got the one with the virus in it and its faster then this one im looking around to find a fast one with out a virus
,Hede88,2008-01-22T06:24Z,"I have used this program many times a while ago and now wanted to use it on my laptop too. My AVG Free edition detected 7 infected, embedded objects in setup.exe, which it claims are trojan horses.
To start with i didnt think that was right, cause i have used the exact same program from the same torrent before without any antivirus saying anything.
Maybe if people would reply and tell what your anti virus software says, we could get to the buttom of this. 

The files AVG detects as embedded are these:
Advisory.nfo
NortonPID.hlp
OS32.ini
ret.bat
smnt.exe
WINClock.exe
WinOS.hlp

remember to tell what anti virus software you use, then it should be clear to people whether they think it is just an ""overreaction"" or a real virus.

EDIT:
In fact i believe these files are viruses, after doing some googlin' on 'em. 
So Slickinator: it sounds like you mean okay by uploading this but im afraid either you didnt check it properly or that you are purposely uploading vira. 
Someone should do a thorough checkup on this user!"
[V],Slickinator,2008-02-22T19:40Z,ok yes there were those viruses in the program but as i said before i have removed the viruses out of this copy but left the credit to the original cracker ok but this version is safe the other ones with same name are not just compare the file size to all the other same name torrents and you will notice a big difference ok but so you know this does not have a virus ok let me ask you this did you download this exact torrent or are you saying you downloaded another exact named torrent from someone else other than me because the torrents uploaded from me are virus free thanx and don't assume because of exact named torrents check all the facts and read more before posting thanx and have a great day
