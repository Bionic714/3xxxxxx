:.About.:

Robot Arena: Design & Destroy lets you wage war in a high-tech arena as you 
fight to dominate a league of robot combat! Enter leagues and tournaments
and face powerful robots while facing obstacles and hazards in deadly arenas. 

Robot Arena: Design & Destroy is a PC game of robotic construction and
combat.It is a sequel to the original Robot Arena.It'sa simulation/arcade
game based on robotic combat like you see on television.People make robots 
out of scrap metal and other junk and then try to destroy other people's robots.
Robot Arena, the original game, was a good beginning.  It got you hooked into
the dream of building your own bot and shredding the competition.  

But it left you drooling for more...more weapons, more accessories,more ACTION!
Robot Arena: Design & Destroy is your new sugar-daddy. Powered by the Havok
Hardcore physics engine,bots can now bounce, flip, twirl, and do the cha-cha.  
Fragmentation of components will leave hunks of metal lying across the arena
floor.  With new Shrapnel-on-Demand technology,a piece of twisted steel can 
even pop out of your floppy disk drive if you aren't careful.  

The arena is no longer just a flat box.  We've got ramps, we've got
platforms, we've got hellraisers, sawblades, and other goodies.  Heck, the
arena alone is fun--just wait til there are three other bots in there.  (Oh,
did I mention four bots simultaneously?)
