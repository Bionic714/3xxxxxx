This is a great spanish comedy with the hilarious duo Martes y Trece (not together anymore). It has been a long time since I have seen this, but I do remember laughing constantly. From Dracula to Frankenstein we have it all in this over the top film. The ending left me wanting a bit more but overall this is a great comedy. In Spain around this time there were quite a few couple comedians such as "Cruz y raya", "El duo sacapuntas", "Faemino y Cansado" and the ones that started it all, "Martes y Trece". I remember every new years eve we had a new spacial from these two, and each and everyone of them was better. This movie, even though not the only one from duo comedians in Spain I believe to be one of the best. If anyone has a chance to check this out in the States, go for it, you will not be disappointed.
