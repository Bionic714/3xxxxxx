I bring you ghost lake.
The movie isn't that good, low budget i think but it is worth watching if you love zombie movies. It is not the zombies we know as flesh eating more just dead folks walking and talking. 

This movie is full scale dvd mobie, i have ripped this one my self from my own dvd collection.
Thats why the files are so big. but still 

enjoy.

Cheers.
