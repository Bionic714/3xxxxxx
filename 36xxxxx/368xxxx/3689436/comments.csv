I'll be happy to seed this for a while once I've got the whole lot!

,mr_fong,2007-09-01T10:50Z,"wow this is a huge file :\
data like this will be difficult to transfer until everyone gets really good bandwidth.....
like at least 30mbps/10mbps"
,FireArse,2007-09-03T10:14Z,"Common guys - it is a big film, but it's also pretty good! Well worht the 3weeks it's taken so far to download! (i'm only on 17%)

Lets get this seeded - Once I get 100%, I won't stop seeding this for a loooong while.

F"
,FireArse,2007-09-11T20:23Z,"OK - there's a guy at about 94% and a guy at about 55%. IF you two got online at the same time we'd have the full file. 

Please seed / download from one another - I've been seeding what I have for weeks now!"

,struntprat,2007-11-28T09:50Z,"I'd be happy to seed it on for a couple of months. But I'm stuck at 62,3% a week now so I can't recommend anyone try a download."
,FireArse,2007-12-14T20:10Z,"OK - so we're at 62.4% it really would take just a few days with a fast seeder to get this done - please seed!
