Yeah, it's another release only 2 days after my last one. I did this cos there were apparentally some issues going on at the time of that last build I didn't notice in my original testings. They have since been fixed, and here's the build that included the fixes. It'll probably be next friday before another release, no real reason for the extended time (9 days instead of a week) other than that it doesn't make sense to put up 3 releases this week 2 days apart. I plan on making my releases weekly now, and most likely on Fridays unless something changes. If you enjoy these releases and/or have suggestions for scripts or something to include in the next release, drop me a line. I know that the scripts are kinda out of date, so during my extra time between releases this next time I'll probably update the scripts. So remember, ThePirateBay is your official FahxBahx source. Other sites are allowed to use the torrent as I'm not some kinda Nazi, but I just don't want anyone to try to claim that the release is exclusive to them or anything stupid like that. I'm pretty sure the use of the TPB logo on the splash screen should help with that one though. Heh.
