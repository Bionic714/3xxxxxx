User Reviews

"I write software too, and love to see well-designed GUIs. Pro is virtually invisible, and that's the highest praise I have to offer"

- Arthur Fuller, Chief Code Monkey, ETS Escape Routes Inc.


"I've been using CuteFTP and then CuteFTP Pro v1 for a while and have been really impressed with the upgrade to v2. I run a web server which is remotely hosted and have been using pcAnywhere for backing up to my local PC. However, it keeps losing the connection and provides no feedback as to whether or not the download was completed (we're talking 100 MB or more). In desperation I thought I'd try it using cuteFTP pro 2 - it ran like clockwork and I didn't have to worry about dropped connections. Wow!! Keep up the excellent work!"

- Chris Gaelic


"I have always liked Cute FTP and tested Pro 1.0 a while back. I recently purchased Cute FTP Pro 2.0. and WOW am I impressed. Great job and I love the features. You lead me to believe you brought in a whole new development team on 2.0 as it's downright awesome."

- James Hornack, Director Of Technology, Advanced Integrity Business Solutions, LLC


"Multimedia production is dependent on the ability to transfer large files. With CuteFTP Pro, we can manage all aspects of the file transfer, including selecting which specific files to send and when to send them. The advanced scheduling allows us to automate routine tasks, saving us a lot of time in a deadline-driven field."

"After using CuteFTP for some time, I finally decided to try out CuteFTP Pro. I was blown away, it is just a brilliant program, my words lack the amount of credit your program really deserves. It definitely rates up in the top 3 of my favorite, and most used programs. It is exactly what I have been looking for, purely excellent! Keep up the exceptional work guys!!"

"Having said that I have to say I love CuteFTP Pro. I am a longtime user of plain old CuteFTP, and was reluctant to switch to a fancy GUI, but it makes life a lot easier. Thanks."

-Dave Findlay


"I was about to buy WS-FTP and had a few problems with the synchronization. I sent many emails, and got a support person who said he would help and never answered anything. So I bought CuteFTP Pro - better support and a better program - 'nuff said."

- Lagi


"I just wanted to thank you for the help. I really appreciate it. Your Cute FTP Pro is an excellent program, and out of the 10+ i have tried, or used in the past 5 years, it is by far the best one. Keep up the good work, and thank you for all the help in resolving my issues."

"Wow! I just moved up from CuteFTP to Pro, and I am amazed. What a great piece of work, you people! Great software is invisible, and you've done it. Nice work. I can't imagine needing to read the help file. It's so obvious what to do and when, and everything I can think of works just like Explorer. Beautiful!"
