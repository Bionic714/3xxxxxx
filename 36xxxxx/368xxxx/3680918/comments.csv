,oswald1234,2007-05-08T08:14Z,Does it work? Or should I beat off with my HULK hand instead?
,hurrafor,2007-05-19T11:29Z,"ABSOLUTELY works....you just have to do a little digging:

First, you need HDTVPump:

And then (At least for any HD-DVD releases by HDTV_CHINA i have) you need Matroska Splitter

You will also need to have a MPEG2 decoder previously installed. NVIDIA's works. If you can play a DVD - chances are you have a valid decoder.

Install those and report back!"
