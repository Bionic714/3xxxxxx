[V],Kuthumi,2007-05-16T07:42Z,"I have tried several times to repair this film with ifoEdit, but have not succeeded. Can someone help? Would like to burn it and watch it from the standalone player."
,likefilm,2007-05-22T15:52Z,you may try to  burn it using Data Disc mode instead of Video mode  in  Nero and this movie can also be played in Media Player Classic or Kmplayer. 
[V],Kuthumi,2007-05-25T16:43Z,"Thank you. That partly worked, and may only work on a divX player. I have to change audio channel to 80 each time it jumps to a new VOB file. There is something wrong with the file structure on this rip, and the relationship between the VOB, IFO and BUP files."

This torrent was recorded in the PAL format and, of course, the uploader forgot to mention or display that in the ""Type"" category."
,bloopert,2008-04-21T13:05Z,This PAL formatted torrent needs to be converted to the NTSC format before it will work properly.
