Hi there,

Didn't expect that many downloaders for my previous mix http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3682115/10_Years_in_Trance_Mix! Thought I may as well upload another.

This is a short hard psy / goa trance mix made by me, featuring the Prolekulture Mix CD by Chris Liberator, of which a transition or two may have made it into the final mix, so thanks Chris! Also features Etnica's The Juggeling Alchemists Under The Black Light and Dimension 5 tracks, hence the title.

It's a 160Kbps VBR MP3.

Enjoy,
Pete
