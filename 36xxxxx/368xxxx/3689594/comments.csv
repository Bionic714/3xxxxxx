You have alot of releases... What is your favorite genre? I noticed you have released all of the good rally games in a timely manner.

Me: Flight sims, racing sims, shooters, strategy, then whatever else is lying around."

,kb_cobra,2009-03-16T00:21Z,"Fast download, im still seeding! But I am having trouble getting this to install on xp 64bit.
I run the setup.reg then try to launch RALLIS_1.EXE and I get the message. 

""Unable to find language Registry keys. Please reinstall Rallisport Challenge""

Any thing specific I should try?"
,sweborg,2009-05-15T05:12Z,Thanks for the upload! This is nostalgia.
,lernatix,2009-07-14T08:08Z,"Nice one as usual DM.

I'm having a problem with this one however.
Every time I try to change my controller config
I get a BSOD!  Useless game without control."
,Volvo-240,2010-04-13T21:44Z,"Xaluber:
It doesn't work =(
I tried it.. I also tried to make a QWORD 64-bits value.. That didn't work either =("
,TerraRoot,2010-06-29T18:23Z,"that you Xaluber and dopeman, was have the ""language Registry keys"" problem, solved now :)"
,somken,2010-07-30T09:07Z,"Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Microsoft Games\RalliSport Challenge\1.0]
""LangID""=dword:00000009


Put that into a .reg file.  Should be good to go if you're having issues."
,termite43,2010-09-27T23:48Z,"Yeah, well I'm running win7 x64 and the registry already has this setting.  

Name  LangID
Type   REG_DWORD
Data   0x00000009 (9)

Oh well, I guess my version of Win7 x64 must be different than any other on the planet.  Too bad, because this game has the best physics out of any racing I have ever played (I used to have it on XBOX original and it did work on Vista 32).  Strange.

,kzanova,2011-02-05T21:51Z,"hey DOPEMAN, u're the shitt!! this game is awsome, its works sucessfully, great Job guys

,Sladen88,2011-02-11T06:29Z,Thanks for the grat upload dopeman. And thank you somken for the reg entry. This is a GREAT racing game. I only wish they would have made the 2nd for pc.
,Ardi4n,2012-01-08T22:56Z,"Unable to find language registry keys..

I'we did press the setup before run the RALLI_1
How can i fix this..
Awnser please :D"
,phlook,2012-06-13T16:50Z,"IF NOT WORKING IN WINDOWS 7 64-BIT: Open Regedit, and search for ""Rallisport"" all through your registry. Add a 32-Bit DWord Value called ""LangID"" and put the value as 00000009.

It is missing from one or two spots in the registry. If I remember correctly, there was one folder called ""WinNode"" or something similar that I added the LangID value to. Now it works!

Good luck, awesome game, lots of nostalgia."
