The DVD seasons differ from the aired seasons. Therefore it's probably both."
,torpsta1,2007-06-11T10:52Z,cheers dude
,Chilli_C,2007-07-10T16:46Z,It's actually season 6 not 5

Actually this is a perfectly valid question, since the seasons do differ, it is fair enough that zithix would want to know whether he/she already had the epi before downloading!"
