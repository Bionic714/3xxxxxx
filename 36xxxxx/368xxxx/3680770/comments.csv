,XoSkeLLeT,2007-05-04T23:27Z,"damn =( its not anything like the way Linkin Park should play =(

hope they dont play much of their new songs from this album in Sthml 25th, the old sounds sounded much much better =/"
,maverex,2007-05-04T23:55Z,"So far I am pretty dissapointed:

I have listened to this for the past few hours solid and I'd say theres 4 good tracks on the entire album, 
the rest make you wonder what the hell happened to Linkin Park.  Usually I like every song they put out but I don't know about this one. 

It's too lovey dovey for me on some of the tracks.


It's like chester is making music to get little girls all hot for him.....


Whats with all the soft tracks?

Only ones worth listening are track #
02 - Given Up
04 - Bleed It Out
06 - What I've Done (But you've already heard it)
08 - No More Sorrow

The best song? either 6 or 8"
,maverex,2007-05-04T23:56Z,"BTW, this is NOT, I repeat NOT a fake. It is for sure the retail album."
,Mizled,2007-05-05T04:02Z,"I have to agree. It's somewhat of a disappointing album when compared to Hybrid Theory or Meteora.

Oh Well. Thanks for the upload. Cheers!"
,tempflux,2007-05-05T05:02Z,lick my balls linkin park this album sucks. i am definitely not buying it.
,Crackzter,2007-05-05T07:28Z,"I'm very disappointed as well..
I'm so happy that I didn't buy it..
This is C - R - A - P !! CRAP CRAP CRAP AND ALL CRAP!!!"
,de_killer,2007-05-05T10:14Z,"What the fuck happened with all of you guys? I can't believe you mean what you say cause this album surely rocks! Of course there aren't only 4 great songs on this album.... What do you say about 'Leave Out All The Rest' or 'In Pieces'. And the others may not be great songs but they're still good. Actually there's only one shit song on the entire album and I thing this is 'Hands Held High', but on the previous 2 albums that there were a couple of bad songs as well. Never mind this album is surely PERFECT and you are going to get used to it.......... Oh and no matter what you think about buying it I will surely do so as well as millions of others..... "
,Creator_of_torrent,2007-05-05T19:47Z,This music is totally different the their last album 4 years ago. Theres nothing wrong with it but its not really the Linkin Park I loved.
,GameGuNotNigga,2007-05-05T20:16Z,"de_killer: 

their other 2 studio albums were simply perfect.. not 1 ! shitty cut on any of those albums.. just lovely albums.. this... BLOWS !"
,Thestrup1337,2007-05-05T20:27Z,This album kinda fails :
,KaliZka,2007-05-05T20:30Z,"please, no more emo music for me."
,duel007,2007-05-05T20:56Z,"linkin park isnt emo. atleast they werent emo. they are more metal/rap. but not anymore.

what happened to the awsome bass singer? i didnt hear him at all in this album. :(
"
,Johan_9107,2007-05-05T21:28Z,dammit! linkin park used to be like th egods of music now suddenly they just suck :s has the world gone mad?
,mamantoha,2007-05-05T22:43Z,"On May 4, 2007, 11 days before its official U.S. release, the album was leaked onto several peer-to-peer networks on the internet. Later that day Mike Shinoda commented on his response to the leak:

,ockizzz,2007-05-05T22:55Z,"Linkin park is Always disappointing
They are to housebroken."
,Awu,2007-05-06T01:57Z,"On May 4, 2007, 11 days before its official U.S. release, the album was leaked onto several peer-to-peer networks on the internet. Later that day Mike Shinoda commented on his response to the leak:
? 	""It couldn't be more exciting to give you all new music, especially after all the hard work we put into it. This album was almost a year and a half of experiments, mistakes, inspiration, and careful craftsmanship. We put everything we had into these songs, and want you to hear every second of it. I can't wait for you to absorb all the levels of meaning in the songs, and the layers of music, eventually forming your own ideas about what the songs mean to you.

At the same time, a leak leaves out some very important parts of this piece of work. We put months of creative energy into the ART of the record, in the booklet, special edition, and big book...almost as long as it took to record hybrid theory. The album has amazing photos, lyrics, and notes about how the songs came together--it's the visual half of the record. On the other hand, the super-special-edition book is packed with exclusive images, stories of the making of the songs, gorgeous art, the CD and a DVD that tells the story, showing the actual moments of inspiration caught on camera. For me, it's almost hard to imagine anyone really experiencing this album without that part of it.

Even the song sequence alone is very important. It's WAY different to hear the songs in a random order than to listen to this record from beginning to end. At the very least, if you've already downloaded the songs, do us a huge favor and listen to them in the right order...it'll be way more rewarding."""
,Sebbe93,2007-05-06T10:14Z,Not as good as the old albums...but absolutely worth listening. if you don't like it dont download it....
,daboss2000,2007-05-06T12:45Z,IS THIS REAL?????
,shypys,2007-05-06T12:50Z,The person above me is an idiot
,pepsikatt,2007-05-06T14:36Z,"this album sucks. only one good song, Bleed It Out."
,dealerhun,2007-05-06T21:13Z,"This album is the not the best from linkin park, but is a very good release, because it's all song on the disc has an own story... I like this album such as meteora and hybrid theory. And the true LP fans too. AND YOU MOTHERFUCKERS DO NOT LASH IT!!"
,GameGuNotNigga,2007-05-06T22:47Z,"shypys: hahaha :D

Lord Stefan: haha.. Even Mike don't like this shit :D"
,iamtheculprit,2007-05-07T00:03Z,Can someone upload this in a file format that works on a Mac?
,biggamehnter,2007-05-07T01:27Z,"well heres the reason downloading the album is so great. you get to listen to junk before you pay hard earned money for it.

most the time if the cd is great all the way through i'll go dish out the money just to have the casing and its worth the money.

but then you get stuff like this and become thankfull we have this kind of technology, before we wasted our money on this "
,JoshuaH,2007-05-07T07:56Z,Wow...This album does really suck.  This isn't the Linkin Park I used to listen to...
,MANIPON,2007-05-07T09:02Z,"love lp..every song is beautiful..shadow of the day sounds like a hilarry duff song but i still like it..all the songs are great..i will still buy the cd..there's nothing wrong with it..amen,amen in hands held high is different..that's modern rock..we should get used to it..lp is still better than other bands..everybody now plays and listens to emo..why not try this? and if you are a fan..you will love evrything that they offer you.."
,black2567,2007-05-07T15:59Z,deem ppl don't blame LP they just did their job.If you don't like their album then just don't buy it.I like MtM and Chaz said that his nu-metal voice is gone so shut the fuck up and don't blackguard LP.
,KaliZka,2007-05-07T19:26Z,"Yes, it wasn't emo music - but it is now."
,gxgflame,2007-05-08T00:07Z,"Interesting album, I guess. It seems like a giant step backward for them though."
,willyboi69,2007-05-08T06:55Z,"this is really diff from the rest of lp's albums... in saying that it is ok, just doesnt compare with the old-skool shit.
Gr8 work but, thanx."
,bopakus,2007-05-08T12:56Z,"There are no DJ elements in any of the songs, we can have them from DJ, lyrics as usual are meaningful. Many songs are slow paced and few are very nice on ears. Its different, and I am re listening LPs old albums and slowly and slowly figuring out major differences. 
Listen it for the difference. 
Best Song to me >> The little things...worth more than 6:25 minutes."
,TheNameless1,2007-05-08T16:38Z,Like everybody else said this CD is different for sure. But if you guys are LP fans you'll respect their creativity and their efforts to expand their music. I like this cd. I will prob buy the CD also. 
,drakfisken,2007-05-08T19:40Z,"I like this CD  =D
But i hope they only play the best songs from this album in Sthml 25th..."
,Lindane,2007-05-08T21:32Z,"I love the album, im a true linkin park fan.
Altho I will  say this, alot of the songs sound like they would be on Grey's Anatomy lol ^^ gg linkin park      (more mike shinoda would be nice)"
,qswdefrgth,2007-05-09T02:09Z,Stop QQ'ing you downloaded it.
,SantaClaw,2007-05-09T15:29Z,"They said long before the realese of this album that it where going to be somewhat different from the other two. Remember that as artist they also want to do things differently and not get stuck in the same sound forever. The previous two albums where very ""heavy"", I mean full speed straight through basicly, so I can understand if they where looking for something more ""lighter"" this time. IMO it's a good album, I agree that it can get abit slow here and there with several soft songs in a row, but if you are a true LP fan you probably got all the other songs and if you mix em all together the balance becomes great."
,DREDuk,2007-05-09T17:14Z,"CD quality is good, but in my opinion only 3 songs on the CD worth of listening to... :("
,samaha_edmond,2007-05-09T19:27Z,"Hey In My Opinion This Is The Best Album Of LP Ever,It Sounds Great,and it contains a solo in the song ""in pieces"",LP Still The Best Band In The History Of Nu-Metal..."
,GameGuNotNigga,2007-05-09T19:29Z,HEY Whoever Reccomended That Red Album The End Of Silence - MAJOR PROPS! LUUUV Da ALBUM ! :D

Thanks, I will check out the End of Silence album right now. "
,JoshuaH,2007-05-11T11:20Z,"@quickcanary

Thanks, they're awesome. :)"
,Mizled,2007-05-11T12:53Z,"Does anyone else notice that Track 3 - ""Leave Out All The Rest"" kind of sounds like the Backstreet Boys or pop boy band? lol Kind of sad..."
,Yamarkus,2007-05-11T14:39Z,Thanks!  :D
,HaXeR,2007-05-12T10:53Z,"All u FUCKERS that just like screaming and DETAH METAL and shit like that, fuck off! Just because LP wants to show that they to have some feelings and stuff like that, all u guys criticize them for that!? WTF is this? I would like to see someone of u here making a song that are actually good! .....IN OTHER WORDS= THIS ALBUM IS VERY GOOD! DOWNLOAD IT!"
,glr,2007-05-14T14:40Z,"If it's not as good i'll just pop Reanimation back in.

Linkin Park doesn't owe us shit so just respect the music they choose to make, or go flame your mom."
,Stoffe8,2007-05-15T15:34Z,"Stuck at 99,8%, pls seed ! xD"
,miserablestar,2007-05-16T15:23Z,"well...they said they were breaking off the old style, and they did. i was hoping that they would continue getting better since meteora is sheer awesomeness, but they gone too far away from meteora with this album. a couple ive heard so far were decent, but only one great. at least they havent sunk as far as evanescence has."
,bull3eN_,2007-05-16T15:58Z,"sooooooo  bad album. their worst album ever!!!!! 


i DON'T DOWNLOAD!   "
,smlefo,2007-05-16T17:11Z,Man I don't know why so many people are complaining.  This is great stuff.  I'll be buying the album.
,kizz_11,2007-08-27T14:10Z,Great
,NostalgicStone,2007-09-17T00:09Z,"Hey airdrummer555: I completely agree with your opinion.

I do think this LP changed a bit, but it was for the better.

All their old stuff was a bit whiny, but was easy to relate with when you were 15. Their new shit totally hits the level were at today- with politics and the constant change that is our everyday life.

I intend to buy this album because I want see what they have to offer in the next couple years,  but for now, i cant wait for teh music, so BRING ON THE SEEDERS!"
,timmyhawky,2008-01-27T15:33Z,"Nice album :)
The music is OK, but the sound volume is many lower than in other songs, so I got to change the volume of my MP3-player time to time :( So I download another upload of this."
,TabboTonyTheTerrible,2009-04-16T04:30Z,"Im glad Linkin Park ditched their old style. Hybrid Theory was cool when I was 14, but that style of music is so 2000. Instead of dying with that genre LP decided to get with the times, and I don't blame them one bit. I personally thought their style was played out by 2003, but they kept on cashing in with that same old recipe until they finally realized that the whole nu-metal, rap-core, rockband with a dj crap, whatever you want to classify them as, is a joke these days."
,gkalai12,2009-09-27T00:17Z,Thanks mate. I love the internet because of people like you
,nicklouslingor,2010-12-09T04:15Z,Linkin park is the band our generation grew up[ with ..literally as we grew so did their music it is like the theme band for our generation and i love it
,nicklouslingor,2010-12-09T05:44Z,@maverex you don't really know anything about linkin park if you chose the only ones played on the radio as good songs. and you also don't know shit about chester. but hey i cannot really fault you for being ignorant most of the human race is
,Sirpinket,2011-01-15T04:10Z,"@bull3en who gives a shit what you think of them, i didn't come hear for your lame opinion!!! keep that crap to yourself!  the bottom line is this people! i am a musician/producer. if you love a BAND you like the people in it and respect their efforts and directions as well as their music. if you love their STYLE OF MUSIC then thats fine, but when the band you say you love so much steps out and does something different dont put them down, just remember that you like their old style of music and people grow."
,heyblackduck,2011-03-26T15:45Z,thx 4 dl!
,Keeeez,2011-09-17T15:52Z,Linkin Park went better when this album was released. It's so much more badass. THANKS :)
