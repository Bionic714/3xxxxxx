Of course this is ep. 17 from season FIVE, there is no sixth season yet..."
,Kalath,2007-05-14T12:07Z,"just shut up, and be grateful for the episode. thanks  coretorrents!"
,funky_moose,2007-05-14T18:05Z,"Hey! Wait a minute Kalath! Gregersamsa has a point there. I mean, could you imagine if I had watched this episode and then found out at a much later date that all along I had been fooled in to thinking I had watched an episode from season 6, when it was really from season 5? To be completely honest, I THINK I WOULDN'T GIVE A SHIT!!!!!!!"
,funky_moose,2007-05-14T18:12Z,"Oh yeah, forgot to say thanks for the awesome upload coretorrents!"
,BrandonColeMargera,2007-05-14T19:56Z,"HUM!!!! 
Wonder why season 6 is allready up in 17 episodes when it haven't even been made yet?!
gregersamsa Shut the fuck up!
Its only not comed on tv yet. ^^,
Dumb Fuck..."
,BrandonColeMargera,2007-05-14T19:57Z,"but it was really a pretty waist putting the S0""6"" there, u should change it...  
Or [-Mod is gonna be on you.. ^^,
Btw, this episode suck!"
,Spectru,2007-05-14T21:25Z,"Actually, it seems to be kind of a confusing about which season their running. This season is called both s6, and s5. Nobody is right, except that gregersamsa is wrong, that snotty smartass...

The family guy-crew don't give a shit, and since they go with fillers from time to time, they don't send the episodes in the order they make them. So the advertised shows may be canelled and replaced by a show with another number. From this, the confusion has come... OK?"
,fuzzyponken,2007-05-15T09:18Z,The amusing part is that the site he's linking to actually lists a 6th season...
,runfarst,2007-05-15T16:58Z,Well actually this season is season 6.. season 5 are on dvd.. So actually all of you are wrong.
,damon_dusk,2007-05-15T17:27Z,"That is correct. This is, in fact, Season 6. I have all episodes seasons 1-5 and these files listed as ""s6"" are not in my season 5, or any other."
,warrior260,2007-05-15T19:52Z,"What are u talking about.get your facts atraight..
THIS IS SEASON 6. i have all seasons and this IS 0617..
stfu.."
