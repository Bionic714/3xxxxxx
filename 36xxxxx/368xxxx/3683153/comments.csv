,gamemaster_link,2007-05-08T07:27Z,Och hur updaterar man då? via internet?
,raph700,2007-05-08T07:35Z,"To all those who don't speak swedish ^^;
DO NOT try to play this on your WII if you have a european or a japanese WII, it has an auto update that will brick your machine if it's not from the same zone with the game! You can still play it if you have updated your firmware to 2.2 before."
,mattaman,2007-05-09T14:23Z,"Ja du updaterar via internet... Gå In på options sen wii settings, sen wii systems update... senaste är ver.2.2E"
,mimmio,2007-05-09T18:26Z,"Men hur bränner man den då? Jag har packat upp den och bränt från exe filen så jag fick en iso fil, brände med Nero som image men det funkar inte.
Jag fick upp menyn och allt men jag kunde inte komma vidare på spelet, vad har jag gjort för fel?"
[T],BeastG,2007-05-13T14:42Z,"mjaa den uppdaterar juh inte om du har samma eller en nyare firmware än vad autoupdateraren har.

I det här fallet så vill autouppdateraren uppdatera till firmware 2.1.

Helt riskfritt skulle jag säga. Kör spelet på min PAL wii utan några som helst problem."
,NightZhai,2007-05-22T16:57Z,"Do you need any kind of modchip on your Wii or something to play this game? By the way, I have a PAL Wii. Need some answers plz ^^"
,mega_lucas,2007-05-24T08:49Z,hur kan jag se vilken firmwire jag har. jag har uppdaterat precis men jag vill vara säker.
,hellspawn66628,2007-06-09T03:09Z,"ok here goes this does work.. i have been playing it... 
1.make sure you wii is running at lease 2.1e (i updated to 2.2e )
2.put game in console and let it run the update(if you have the 2.1 or the 2.2 it will go throught the process but not really do anything)
3.play the game.
I have a pal console with a wiikey, running on firmware 2.2e, there was no issue, but I was afraid of bricking it. 
if you dont know how to check what fimware you are using, go in to settings menu and it should tell you in the top right corner. eg2.0 or 2.1e etc....
Enjoye the game, I used image burner to burn the game at 2x speed on to a ritedisk + media. "

,Invisible_Kid,2007-07-14T22:54Z,"@Mattialdo
You can update your wii with big brain academy it has 2.2 fw"
,dreeder5,2007-07-27T01:39Z,"Wont load? I have a u.s. version wii with latest firmware and wiid chip with latest update. Wasted 2 discs on this. WTF, the game wont load. "
,timmyhawky,2007-08-08T14:18Z,"this one has an update!
Thanks, the game works great, but the quality ofthe game itself is bad :("
,EuphoricDissonance,2007-10-11T02:29Z,"Sorry in advance for the noob comment, but do you have to have a modchip to run this? Tried TDK and Verbatim DVD-R's with no luck."
,bidule69,2007-12-02T22:55Z,You definitely need to have a mod chip to run ANY back-up disk (non original disk)...
