I bring you House of the dead

A couple of teens from the US goes to a deserted island to rave, but something is wrong on this island.
a lot of zombies.

the movie is not that good a medium budget i think, but it is still worth watching
a lot better than ghost lake + i have found out that there is made a house of the dead 2. that sounds good.

anywho.
this is a full dvd rip that i have done my self :)
so there are subs and all.

enjoy

Cheers
