Serious Sam II 

Format: .iso format. 
CD-Key Generator and Crack included

Mount/Burn then install. copy the  sam2  crack file located in the  bin  folder over the original sam2 file. 

ATTENTION!!  the cd-key generator (filename--> RLD-SS2KG)  IS identified by Avast! antivirus as a virus/malware/worm/trojan:

Malware name: Win32:Trojan-gen {Other}
Malware type: Virus/Worm

i used this cd-key generator despite the warning and it worked like it should have and my computer is not screwed up in anyway that i can tell. there may be absolutely nothing wrong with the cd-key generator, it may simply be labeled as a virus because it's created to do illegal things or whatnot. HOWEVER! if you have any worries PLEASE! find another means of getting a cd-key (such as from the list that a user provided below).




enjoy:)
