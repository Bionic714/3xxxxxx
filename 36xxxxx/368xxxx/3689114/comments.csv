[T],ripthejacker420,2009-07-22T10:05Z,hey guys.  sorry if you are having problems but i cannot really help you. i had absolutely no problems and have yet to come across any problems. this game runs perfect fore me. there IS a cd-key generator included (which is picked up by my Avast! antivirus as  Win32:Trojan-gen {Other})  BUT!  i believe this is simply because its a cdkey generator and many times cd key generators are labeled as trojans or worms or whatnot. i used this cd key generator and it worked and i havent had any problems with my pc as far as i know. if you really do not trust this then dont use it. find a key some other way. there is a crack included as well so everything you need is here.

,zingmars,2011-03-23T20:09Z,"I will have to agree with that this keygen is a false positive.
It's not asking for rights on my W7 machine, meaning it can't really change my registry and whatnot, and it doesn' t leave any processes running behind.
Doesn't seem to be doing any writing to the disk actually."
,eskilstuna23,2011-06-28T03:08Z,"eeh, iÂ´ve installed the game/crack/patch.
and when i try to run the game it says iÂ´ve got the wrong disc inserted .
