,camman30,2007-09-24T20:31Z,Hey James.  I dont get what you mean by #3.  How do you copy dvdtodvd.dll and 1clickdvdcopy.exe to the installation directory eg- (LG software innovations)?  Thanx bud.
,MrFMrF,2010-09-01T08:36Z,"Followed the instructions (very simple instructions by the way, thank you) and it works like a charm.  Just like when I use to buy the program!  Thx a lot jamesjohn911, liking your work so far, I'll have to check more of it out, do you by chance take requests?

Very simple people just follow the instructions.  #3 is saying to move or copy the 2 files (dvdtodvd.dll and 1clickdvdcopy.exe) to the program files folder, the path to this folder should be c:/ > Program Files > LG software innovations > 1 Click DVD Copy 4.1.  So select both the above mentioned files and drag them into the program folder (path to it mentioned above), then it will tell you the files already exist and ask you if you want to replace them, click YES, replace the files, and you're golden the program will then work from the desktop icon as it normally would.

I'll be sure to see this one."
