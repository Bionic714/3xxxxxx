,sirpipe,2007-07-20T16:07Z,I installed this and then discovered it contained a virus (Downloader.Generic5.IU). BEWARE!!
,MrTeacherSr,2007-07-26T12:07Z,No viruses at all! Thx Christley!
,drdaldds,2007-08-18T18:46Z,"My experience with Christley's Downloads has been very bad. Use with extreme caution. There are very many post on here by these people, and many are bogus, with adware and viruses, including sleepers that do not immediately show up. Like Hill Street Blues ""Be careful out there"". I for one, will never use anything these people put out there. Been there and done that!!!! Look around...this utility is posted half a dozen times. The feedback is predominantly negative in all the other posts. This was the first remotely positive post I have read, and I am very skeptical. Caveat!!! "

,no_rookies,2007-08-31T13:38Z,"downloaded this a while ago and have it both on desktop and notebook, and have had any problems. it actually is a great piece of software, and i strongly reccomend it. got alot of customizations like bootscreen/login and an EXCELLENT process manager that actually tells you what the process application is, rather than just the abreviation. and whatever that kid was saying about it messing up his registry, dont listen to him, hes a moron. "
,2true,2007-09-02T18:22Z,good programe but you do need to know what you are doing with this

,trichome,2007-10-17T01:05Z,"I cant believe how fucking stupid some of you guys are honestly. Drdaldds u stupid fucking moron technically any file of unknown origin and un-known type could be infected. But fortunately for ur stupid ass u can see what files u are getting and decide whether or not to download them. There are 3 fucking files you ignorant fucks, and like dude said one is the exact .exe you would get off there website and two .txt files. What does it give you instructions on how to make a virus and put it on your own machine? Never had a single problem with any torrent ever, just do a little research and shut ur fucking pie hole when ur POS free anti-virus goes off."

,the_nakaii,2008-03-08T01:43Z,Gently brothers Peace Pace! Some new brothers are terrified of compromising their hardwon computer systems with all manner of malware. they just don't have the experience to know that they are generally safe to download off of this website. Keygens and patches do on a regular basis offend certain security software. AVG is the worst offender and is the most likely to be used by the new brothers especially those who have scant coin! If worst comes to worst all the new brethren have to do is do a clean reinstall of their operating system to get rid of the offending so called trojans and other assorted malware. including the PUPS(potentially unwanted programs also called trojans by a lot of antivirus software! so gently gently o my brothers. Give the noobies a chance to learn and grow in the BrotherHood of Freedom!!
,hubertuuss,2008-03-23T09:25Z,thnx a bunch
