An improved version of Beatle's Love album. Still a seamlessly flowing (gapless) album. Songs have been reordered with most of the more uptempo ones at the start. The ghastly Octopuses' Garden is gone, as is some of the more self-indulgent bits that grate after repeated listenings. Some mainly instrumental links have been added and the occasional tasteful bit of speech and sound effects (all by The Beatles).
