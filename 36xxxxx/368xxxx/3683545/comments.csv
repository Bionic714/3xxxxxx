,mick3000,2007-05-09T01:44Z,"Sorry, in the haste and confusion of uploading my first torrent, I accidentally left out one track, which can be found at
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3683940/The_Beatles_-_I_Want_You_(missing_19th_track_from_The_Beatles_-_

This torrent plays OK without the missing 19th track but it sounds better with it - it goes after A Day in the Life and before Here Comes the Sun.

And, yes, it this torrent is a remix of the Love album."

Thanks."
