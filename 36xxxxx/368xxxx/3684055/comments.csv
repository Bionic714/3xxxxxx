,Midfrost,2007-06-17T16:59Z,"Gents, look on the mounted ""CD-Drive"" for a Crack folder or a folder named after the cracker. There should be a no-CD crack file in that folder. That's the common way.

The uncommon way for the more experienced users are to head over to Astalavista.com and check for a crack there. However, I strongly suggest that inexperienced users stay away from that site.

Enjoy."

,HardenedWarVet,2007-08-07T01:54Z,"for all the noobs out there...

download Daemon Tools
click mount drive
click the file that should be the iso of the original disc. This is tricking your computer into thinking the disc is in.
Install.
Keep the file mounted when you play.

Third: Open the extracted map and klick Autorun or Setup!

Firth: Install it.

Fifth: Play it.

Sixth: Enjoy it.

,Comp-Nerd,2008-02-02T22:43Z,"wow, thanks alphaxs works absolutely brilliant so far :) and not a slow download to be perfectly honest. For you guys out there who dont know how to do it, ill do a step by step guide.
1. Go to where you downloaded it, then mount RCT3 File. 
2. When its mounted u should get the installation setup thing.
3. The serial is in (Download directory)>Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 - Serial + No-CD Patch>Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Serial
4. when you have installed it, go to (DOWNLOAD directory)>Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 - Serial + No-CD Patch then extract the Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 - Serial + No-CD file. 
5. when its extracted, the RCT3 file that you get is the cracked one.
6. The cracked one you got, (the one u just did) you are going to open 2 folders, the 1 where the cracked rct3 is, and the folder where u saved ur rct3. (not the download, where u saved it!!)
6. then when u got both of those folders open, simply drag the CRACKED rct3 to the installed folder, and it should ask you do you want to delete and replace and press accept. (u want to replace it)
then.. hopefully.. whala!

Hope it helped, just gimme a bell if not"
