,rr_sookoo,2007-06-13T05:51Z,QUESTION : Does this S/ware have any known issues with SigmaTel Audio (Dell PC's)
,rumsman,2007-07-02T12:15Z,"ok the patch didn't work for me but someone found a way to activate it permanently... Here's how:
1) when you first launch the program, a window will show up. Type in anything into the 'Registration Key' box to get the Activate button to light up. (just type gibberish, make sure that you type at least 12 characters)
2) click the 'Manual' radio button below and enter in the 'Product ID' given in the first box of the same window.
3) click 'Accept' and you are good to go!!"
