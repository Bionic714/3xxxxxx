Boney M. was a pop and disco group, comprised of four West Indian singers and dancers and masterminded by West German record producer Frank Farian, and who were successful during the 1970s. They sold nearly 150 million albums worldwide.[1]

Boney M., with their bubble-gum infectious tunes, became one of the few Western groups at that time to become well-known outside of the West, including Africa, Arab countries, Iran, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the USSR. To this day, along with Swedish pop group ABBA, they are among the most widely known 1970s Western music acts in these regions.

Gold - 20 Super Hits is a 1993 album by Disco/Eurodance group Boney M. It was a compilation album including some of their biggest hits over the past years.
