        _┬ª┬ª_                                                       
       ┬ª┬ª┬ª┬ª┬ª┬ª      Ernesto 'Che' Guevara de la Serna               
        ┬»┬ª┬ª┬»       represents one of the most enduring images      
          ┬»        of a political leader. His legendary            
                   character has been the inspiration for          
                   millions of people over the last fifty years.    
                   Lawrence Elman, a Canadian director, went in     
                   search of the man behind the myth. He            
                   embarked on the journey that gave Che his        
                   name. A trip through South America on an old     
                   Norton motorcycle. Che chronicled this trip      
                   during a break from medical school in a book     
                   called the Motorcycle Diaries. Lawrence          
                   encounters Che's family and oldest friends       
                   who shed light on this true icon of the 20th     
                   century. From the cousin who tells of            
                   Ernesto's chronic lack of hygiene to the         
                   tragedy of being rejected by a woman who is      
                   still believed to be his first love.             
                                                                    
                   Ernesto became Che and changed the perceptions
                   of many. His love and friendship of Sartre
                   (who called Che the only whole man he had ever
                   met), his philosophical journals that began at
                   the age of 15; all helped to shape a man who
                   struggled with potentially fatal asthma all
                   his short life.
