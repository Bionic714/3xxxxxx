Here are some interesting collaborations,  Antony Hegarty (Antony And The Johnsons) singing on two tracks, and Timbaland working with Bjork on beats that she had created for three further songs. Other artists that feature on Volta include electronic pioneer Mark Bell of LFO and two unique drummers Chris Corsano (the improvisational drummer who has worked with Sonic Youth amongst others) and Brian Chippendale from Lightening Bolt. Bjork also brought in two acclaimed African artists for Volta Toumani Diabate, the Malian kora player and Konono No1 the experimental band from The Congo who won a BBC World Music Award in 2006. She has also put together her own 10 piece female brass section of Icelandic musicians who play on three further tracks. Meanwhile Chinese pipa expert Min Xiao-Fen plays on one song.?
