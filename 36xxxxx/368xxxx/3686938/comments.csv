Also, this is for version 1.0 (including update to v1.1 for Windows VISTA).  If you have the 2.0 one, please share it :)"
,Thauzar,2007-05-13T06:04Z,I have to suspend the upload for a day since the demand was higher than expected.  Don't delete this torrent I will seed it from another computer with an unlimited bandwith connection.  Thanks for your patience.
,xenu dot net,2007-05-13T15:28Z,"""Sound File Management Software: Voice Editing Ver. 1.0 Premium Edition
Select Panasonic IC recorders come with the advanced Voice Editing software to help you create and edit professional recordings. Download, organize, and archive your sound files to your computer so you don't have to bother with a messy library of easily lost tapes. You can also cut dead-air or unrelated dialogue in the software's sound-wave editing mode for that seamless interview; or use Voice Editing's text-to-speech function to create transcripts of lengthy business meetings or lectures. You can even translate and pronounce your recordings in five different languages with the speech pad function. And any recording you create can be easily emailed with just a click of the button."""
,Thauzar,2007-05-13T15:36Z,"Since I have a panasonic recorder, I can't tell if or how it would work with other recorders.  This works for sure with last year's collection of IC recorders including mine RR-US395.

I'm not providing this software because it's so cool I can't use anything else.  Simply, this came with the recorder and I didn't try anything else to extract my sound files.  I then have to use some other prog to convert the wave files outputted in mp3."
,Vidpro007,2007-05-13T19:15Z,"Good for you!!! I have just got a Panasonic SV-SD50 SD card mp3 player and its worthless without the Real Jukebox with Panasonic plug in.  Can't find it anywere and I'm not looking foward to the prospects of contacting their tech support for a possible replacement.  Any one out there got that disc.  Not sure if you need a key, but the sofware sure would help..  Thanks"
,Thauzar,2007-05-13T21:23Z,"You can always take a chance and try if this software will work with your device.

concerning contacting support for a replacement disc, forget it.  They are assholes trying to rob you of your money and you'll waste your time on the phone line."
,Brinckmyster,2007-09-23T05:14Z,"Help? It's not working...  Why not?  I have the RR-US395 so I need this software (which I had, but it disapeared)!"
,sjxm9203,2007-11-16T22:34Z,"Hello.

can you please re-seed this for a little.  I really need this software....

Thank you"
,GermanVermin,2007-12-06T01:31Z,"i agree with what this guy says.. those panasonic people are assholes!  I only had my recorder for a month or so before it broke, so I sent it back to the company (it was covered under warantee) and I was on the phone with that company at least 8 to 12 times before they finally stopped bullshitting me and sent me the cash in return.. (this was only after i threatened to call the Better Business Bureau).. and just recently i realized that i would need to use their crappy software to convert the files from their native format into something i would be able to use in the future (which at that point was going to be Panasonic-free) ... But the software wouldn't run, even after re-installing it four times.. so yeah.. Fuck those people."
,FUCK_OFF_WEASEL,2008-06-11T21:32Z,"I'm downloading now, and I hope it works. I borrowed the IC recorder from a friend to record some talks. To my surprise, the recorder needs this bullshit software to pull them from the recorder. It sounds like I need this software to convert the files too. Fuck Panansonic. I think I'll seed this for the rest of my life, just to spite them. Thanks for the upload Thauzar, if it works it will save my ass."

,XORSEEN,2012-07-27T21:54Z,"if panasonic is going to use a ridiculous propriety codec for their product, which is a boner of a move to begin with, they damnsure ought to provide the decoding software freely and for free.  what a despicable bunch of profiteering a-holes!  Thanks Thauzar!"
