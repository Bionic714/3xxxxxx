Run setup.reg!

,Ears14U,2011-10-16T20:32Z,"Keygen is screwed, and my damn original has way too much Starforce protection to run on a dual core windows 7 64bit. So Don't worry all, I hope the hell I help someone else that's struggled so much finding a serial for a ""cracked"" install. So this is my original game serial for you. HA! The finger to Techland and their starforce crap! Enjoy!
