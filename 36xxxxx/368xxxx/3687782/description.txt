Instructions:

Run vistaActivate.exe
Click Prep Files
Once Activate is enabled, click it

Now, you MUST wait for 2 confirmation dialogs to appear!
One will confirm isntallation of a License File
One will confirm installation of a Key

That's it!


This will work on 99% of computers.

Please, don't bother trying to decrypt the 3 numbered files.
They are encrypted to protect you from altering them and 
screwing you install up.
