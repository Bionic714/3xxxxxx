This seems to be just the 'normal' BIOS Activation Crack (that's been around for some time by now...), with ASUS bios chosen.

,TezI,2007-05-22T09:26Z,"Hi Dremation bro. Dude I have problem with this. Wanna try and help me out? 

The Problem is:

It wont activate, but the crack said it works successful. I have the inf on yor link to but that makes it worse cos when I install that and restart my PC it just comes up with that annoying bluescreen 'royal.sys'. So have to boot back to last good working config. Have tried this millions of times dude but no luck. It must be a hardware issue I think. Any ideas brother?Cheers and good work so far.
lol, who thought this was a virus, ha ha, thats funny"

,patnemsam,2007-08-16T14:53Z,"WINDOWS VISTA ATE MY RAM...
I have Vista home basic running on my Toshiba laptop, the OS has eaten 97% of my 1GB of ram, how much more will I need for Ultimate edition? Btw I agree with phXAnarchy, Windows is like a ""Virus"", It F**KS up your computer and your life, but I need it to run all my Adobe software and my Mac Powerbook's battery just exploded and burnt my balls, so I'm stuck with it for now."
