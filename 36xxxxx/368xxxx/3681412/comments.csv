,Tiny Turtle ,2007-05-14T14:07Z,"Thanks a lot for these!

The difference in picture quality between these and the previous Special Editions (which are the ones being sold together with the Swedish tabloid Expressen if someone didn't know) is tremendous. Here's a link to a comparison (for Diamonds are forever, but it's the same story for most of the movies in the series): http://www.bulletsnbabesdvd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2316

Of course the SE versions only have good sound on the latest films (which are the ones Expressen began releasing) while the early films come in mono instead of thes which all have a dts track (Thanks for losing the DD track completely, DTSES!)."
