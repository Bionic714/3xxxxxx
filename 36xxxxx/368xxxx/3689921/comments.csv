,Captainrave,2007-05-16T23:32Z,What game is this??  I didnt realise there was an F1 2006 for the pc?
,420dopeman,2007-05-17T00:04Z,"Captainrave,

just read description, it some sort of modded, updated, 2006 version, dont remember where I got it, but it's legit EA 2006.

cheers."

,Graeme1973,2007-05-18T15:55Z,"well done mate, your games are the best and now are the only one's i download. thanks again"
,420dopeman,2007-05-19T19:11Z,"Thanx for input, and most amusing to some I'm sure, I've never even played this, not once.
Had no idea so many would take interest in this.
Its been 'sittin' in my HD for at least a year now.
Dont even know where I got it.
cheers. "
,kwikkiwi,2007-05-20T09:19Z,Awesome... a BIG thanks.....
,psilocybe,2007-05-21T11:50Z,"dopeman, it would be nice of u to at least try your own rips, not just releasing games here and there and only half of them working. im not complaining, i just say :)"

2006 is so last year :P"
,420dopeman,2007-05-25T14:20Z,"hey -psilocybe 'half of them working'

I always test my games dumb ass, and they all work, or I wouldnt release them.

And the only 2 to ever have a problem, I provided a fix, thank you very much.

greetz."
,420dopeman,2007-05-25T15:18Z,"Just to clarify, cause yes I did state that I havent 'played' this game. That is true.

But to 'TEST' and to 'PLAY' are 2 very different genres in my world. I even have a small team of game 'testers' now for the record.

happy gaming --cheery-o--

Don't bash uploaders, just because you're misinformed."
,vitorvious,2007-09-17T13:05Z,"dopeman's EXACT WORDS ""This is an updated version of EA Games original F1 Racing Challenge.

Tnx! Keep up the good work"
,sandersb14,2008-03-11T19:59Z,"The game works perfectly, except it's F1 challenge 99'-02' and not 2006..
Furthermore; The graphics suck, and the gameplay is quite realistic..
But for the gamers who want some real racing, go look for a better Formula 1 game;)

Tnx for the torrent Dopeman, u still rock!"
