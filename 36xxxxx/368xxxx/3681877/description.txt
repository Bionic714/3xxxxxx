There is a new advanced Robot Workshop where players get to design and build their very own fighting machines starting from simply drawn outlines adding armor, mobility and weaponry as they progress. Players can wage war in a variety of arena-style contests filled with ramps, platforms, obstacles and hazards that dramatically affect the match. All of this is controlled through a Team HQ where players manage every aspect of their growing domination through League and Tournament play. Robot Arena?: Design & Destroy features improved graphics and enhanced physics for incredibly realistic, metal-crushing conflicts. It?s no-holds-barred combat where the last one rolling wins!
