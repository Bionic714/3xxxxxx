,Halvtand,2007-12-28T12:45Z,"This game is awsome, a bit dull in the ""building"" part because you cant just take a part and move it,  but you have to remove it and replace it.

Someone should make a robot arena 3, it would be really nice with the graphics we can get today :)"
,cheezepuffly,2008-02-08T04:32Z,"I would also like to know, what the other files are? What do we do with them? And when i try to burn on nero i get an error message. Is there any directions?"
,chdnolimits,2008-08-02T23:01Z,you may want to get the dsl mod (yes they have mods for this game but you need to follow instructions (as all mods are comunity created) on how to install the mod) to make the game look more realistic
,chdnolimits,2008-08-02T23:02Z,why do i have the right to say what i said i own the game of course
