[V],WeeKnighT,2008-09-17T23:11Z," ""PPjerry at 2007-05-14 23:55 CET:
Is it the colored and the restored in Technicolor version from Special Edition (and not the B/W version)??""

You know it starts out as B+W and changes to color early in the movie, then back to B+W at the end? It's a major plot point..

I see that a lot, people asking for the ""colorized"" version of Rumblefish or Liberty Valance, or looking for the Widescreen version of Gone With The Wind, lol...

People who have little knowledge of movies, but lots of knowledge on how to spam useless questions, instead of using google or imdb.

I'm sure in this case PPjerry was just having an off day."
