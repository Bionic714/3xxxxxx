,MASTEERMIND,2007-05-14T17:14Z,"You know, its when u open the .img file with a program like Daemon Tools

Daemon Tools is a disk image emulator for Microsoft Windows that mounts images of DVD and CD media on virtual drives. The program is able to defeat most copy protection schemes such as SafeDisc and SecuROM.

Daemon Tools was originally a furtherance in the development of another program, Generic SafeDisc emulator, and incorporated all of its features. It is currently being developed and distributed by Daemon's Home and is free for non-commercial purposes. Daemon Tools is known colloquially as D-Tools or just DTools."
