,iC_d3an,2007-07-25T06:47Z,"there is -NO- trojan included with this package or any viruses for that matter, just another person trying to stop the spread of a classic game. please download and enjoy!!!"
,FrogmortonHotchkiss,2007-07-27T18:41Z,"Well, it was sincerely meant - I downloaded it and checked it hoping to be able to play the thing.  I am not some agent from the matrix or whatever.  Just check it before you run it people - maybe I was just unlucky somehow, I dunno.  "
,iC_d3an,2007-08-12T00:22Z,"today, i scanned the folder which contains the files i seeded with Avast! 4.7 home edition just to be safe, and it came back with nothing -VIRUS FREE- guaranteed. the definition files are dated 8-11. i originally seeded this game in hopes more people could enjoy and play this game online with me. see you @ gamespy!!!"
,Gomorrah_Sodom,2007-08-30T03:52Z,"Anybody think they could help me, I install and everything, it all works great, until I get to the opening movie in the very beginning of the game, then it freezes.  Tried running it in 98 mode, but it ALWAYS does the same thing despite everything I have tried."

,iC_d3an,2008-03-08T08:03Z,the above nfo was the release of a ripped version. i just showed it as a reference of kingpin. i have the ripped version but the one being seeded is the iso image of the retail cd.

If you are a proficient user of this system, you should be well aware that most common AV applications mislabel keygens and other common components of  most downloads as trojans. Most often it is keygens and cracks. Again, this download is safe."
,DiaboLiCaL420,2008-09-29T22:08Z,ok i know theres only a few of us downloading this but can we all please seed so we all get it quicker
,Paichuman,2008-11-23T23:11Z,plz seed need the patch too make it work.
,iC_d3an,2010-05-04T17:21Z,"The character \ doesn't show up in the instructions.

This is how the directories should be entered.

C:\Program Files\Kingpin

C:\Program Files\Kingpin\mmclient.exe

If you are using Windows 7, Kingpin will mostly likely be installed into your Program Files x86 folder. Please change the directory name accordingly.

Anyone who has installed this game on Windows 7, comments on helping this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Nice to see it's still being seeded after 3 years. I'll comment again in another 3!"
,iC_d3an,2010-08-31T04:47Z,"i recently checkted the files i uploaded with avg, and its showing false positivies of viruses. but please be assured this is a safe download, avg is saying the no cd crack and monkey mod are viruses which they are not, but if you are your worried, just install the bin cue files and find your own no cd crack and monkey mod files, because i truely just want this game to be shared, if your av app shows virues, its false, but the bin cue files wont. so install the game, and find your own no cd crack and monkey mod if you feel safer that way. i just want you to be rest assured these files have no viruses!"
,iC_d3an,2010-10-30T03:44Z,"I recently installed Kingpin on Windows Vista and had problems attempting to play online but I did find a solution and wanted to share. First, you will not be able to use the Gamespy software that is packaged with the game, you will have to download the newest gamespy arcade from www.gamespyarcade.com. Second, you still need mmclient.exe to play. You will need to right click on the files kingpin.exe and mmclient.exe inside your kingpin folder located in program files. Click the compatibility tab on both files and put a check in Run this program as an administrator, then hit apply and ok. Now install and run Gamespy arcade, it will auto detect kingpin and the mmclient. when you click kingpin on the left hand side, you will get an error window perhaps saying Error, missing operator... click ok repeatedly until the window goes away, then click the kingpin tab again on the left hand side. then click play multiplayer, and it will list the servers, then just double click a server, make sure you click allow when it asks you to load kingpin.exe. it should play online now, post comments if you have problems, im thinking windows 7 will work in a similar way."
,iC_d3an,2010-11-03T04:24Z,"i recently attempted to install kingpin on windows 7 and have successfully done it and able to play online! follow the above instructions to play it on vista but at the very end, there is one more option you will need to change to make the mmclient.exe work with gamespy arcade. when inside gamespy arcade, right click on the kingpin logo on the left side and go to options. inside the window, you will see program location, click inside there and delete just the part that says kingpin.exe and replace with mmclient.exe so that it reads inside program location as follows c:\program files\kingpin\mmclient.exe Now you can play kingpin online on monkey mod servers with windows 7!!!!! enjoy!"
,iC_d3an,2010-11-03T04:26Z,"i forgot to mention im using windows 7 32-bit, if you're on 64-bit, your program files location may read, Program Files x86 or something like that. leave it as it is! please post comments if you're having trouble or comments about your successful attempts!"
,iC_d3an,2010-11-07T01:00Z,"i just discovered after using gamespy arcade to play kingpin online a few times, the gamespy lite software that comes packaged with kingpin now works fine. just thought i would post a comment about it. good luck with your install!"

Then a bunch of shitty errors ""genport i/o initialization failure"" and ""missing GLIDE2X.dll"" pops up. Seriously, this is a good game but you can't even compile a stable torrent that works with 64bit windows 7? Wow. "
,iC_d3an,2011-03-31T05:02Z,"When I uploaded this in 2007, I was using Windows xp. I recently installed the game on Windows 7 32-bit but not have tried it on a 64-bit version. I do have a laptop with Windows 7 64-bit and I will try to make some time to install the game and post the steps I did to make the game work correctly. I did install Diablo 2 recently on windows 7 64-bit and in order to make the game work correctly I had to run the game in windows xp sp2 compatiblity mode. This is an image of the retail disc I purchased back in 1999 and it was designed for Windows 98 on a fat file system. This download has worked for 100s of people, but no one I know has recently installed it on windows 7 64-bit.
I am sure I can make it run on windows 7 64-bit. I will post some information very soon."

I'm using windows 7 64-bit, and the game will not load at all."

,iC_d3an,2011-07-29T04:35Z,i haven't played single player mode that required the crack since windows 98. i have been playing kingpin online since 2001. i will install kingpin and the crack on windows 7 and let you know any errors i may have encountered. speak soon.
,iC_d3an,2011-07-31T01:15Z,"okay i just finished installing kingpin on windows 7 x64 and single player loads fine utilizing the crack. here are the installation steps I used, I tried to explain everything in detail.

windows 7 x64 kingpin installation steps by d3an:

1: mounted kingpin image using daemon tools, began installation once image loaded
2: kingpin installed by default to my Program Files x86 folder, changed option to mature during installation
*note* during descent video, colors are presented incorrectly
3: installation completed successfully, since game was released in 1999, i am going to run kingpin.exe in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 3). go to program files x86 folder, then kingpin folder, then right click on kingpin.exe and left click properties, then click compatibility tab, put a check mark in the box to run in compatibility mode and make sure it says for Windows XP (Service Pack 3), then put a check in Run this program as an administrator, then click apply, then click okay.
4: go inside v1.21 patch folder inside the folder where kingpin is downloaded, and double click the patch file, it will ask to manually enter your kingpin installation directory, to do this, go to program files x86 or wherever your kingpin installed to, once inside the kingpin folder, up at the top of the screen you will see two blue arrows in upper left side, then you will see something like this, > Computer > OS(C:) > Program Files(x86) > Kingpin >, right click on kingpin up at the top and left click first option, copy address.
5: go back to the patch file where its asking for address, click inside there and delete , then right click inside the box, and left click paste, now click unzip, click ok and close the notes txt file if it pops up.
6: Kingpin is fully updated to 1.21, now you need to install the no-cd crack and you will be able to play single player without cd, go to the download directory where kingpin is downloaded, right click on the kp121cr file and left click copy, now go to your program files x86/kingpin directory, and once inside the kingpin installation folder, right click inside an empty space, and left click paste.
7: now you are ready to crack the kingpin.exe with kp121cr, double click kp1212cr, and click patch. You should have a pop up coming up say Successfully Patched! This step is important only if you want to play single player mode without cd inserted.
8: now let test kingpin in my windows 7 x64 atmosphere, go to your kingpin installation folder and double click kingpin, when mine loaded, i had the interplay logo animated with color distortion so I hit esc, then i got an glide error, when i hit ok, kingpin finished loading and menu came up okay, i hit enter on the first menu option: game, i used the arrow keys to choose novice and i hit enter, voila!, kingpin loads fine using no cd crack i provided in the download.

I hope these steps help some people. Once kingpin is loaded, you will want to look at the various options, especially video graphics and controls. This game was released in 1999, and was very intense for its time. I hope many of you will enjoy this game as much I did.

*Note* I never tried burning the image to a cd-r or dvd-r and seeing if kingpin will play single player mode without utlizing the no cd key crack provided. You don't have to install the crack if you just want to play online. This cd key was obtained many years ago and was just tested on 7/30/11 and still does the job. Have fun, and please help seed if storm is going slow. Keep this torrent in your software and check every now and then to see if it needs help seeding. Let's preserve this classic."
