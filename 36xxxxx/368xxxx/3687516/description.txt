The Alex Jones Report May 11th, 2007

In this video filmed live during Alex's KLBJ Sunday show, the hype of the man-made 
global warming fraud is explored, along with the death of Kurt Vonnegut, the Pat 
Tillman and Jessica Lynch cover-ups, and the startling lack of security and safe 
decontamination procedures at the nation's bio-weapon facilities.

Later in the show, Alex discusses the presidential candidacy of Ron Paul and what 
the Texas Congressman stands for, the pretext being erected for the implementation 
of the national ID card, what shop assistants really get to know about you when you 
show them ID to buy beer, and the fallout from last month's Iran hostage crisis.
