,svinhuvud,2007-05-07T19:33Z,"http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm


And play it with media player classic wich is in the package"
,WeedMaster85,2007-05-08T17:46Z,"My VLC plays this just fine.


It took me 11 hours and 600 MB discarded data to finnish this yesterday, this was the worst dl so far here, seeder leecher ratio is very bad on this one.

Unfortunatly I can't find another site that offers the 720p version so quickly after the broadcast.
Thanks for the effort svinhuvud, I love this show."
