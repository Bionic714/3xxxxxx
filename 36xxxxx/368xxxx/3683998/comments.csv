UK: Someone who has downloaded the ENTYRE four gigs and who has checked if the files are playable? Nice torrent DALKILLE if the torrent are playable!!!"
,penilejuices,2010-03-05T13:24Z,"I have downloaded the ENTIRETY of both this one and http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3868191/Elvis_Presley-_Original_Elvis_Collection_50_CD

They are both HOSED in parts, although there is still enough good content to make it somewhat worthwhile.  It is VERY ANNOYING however to have a lot of the really good stuff choppy as hell.  If you want a good example, just download track 21 on album 22 -'Puppet on a String' - one of the best love songs ever - and play it.  You'll see just how annoying it can be.

Also, since TPB has been bought by Global Factory and is now being run by them, they are milking it for all it is worth with ads, popunders, and other misc. bullshit and doing NO infrastructure upgrades, which is why you keep getting 'search engine overloaded' when you search these days.  TPB search has become barely usable.  This site has been compromised and is beginning to become hella lame."
,penilejuices,2010-03-05T13:27Z,"also, both are from the same source(s)."
