,ggbadboy,2008-04-26T11:11Z,When this game finished downloading (all the way to 100%) the game has two files BUT they are both in ISO Image File!!!! Why?!? Can somebody plz help me!
,ggbadboy,2008-04-26T13:39Z,"When i mounted the image and installed everything it seemed everything fine except after a few second this appeared a box saying; ""The Microsoft .NET Framework1.1 was not detected on this machine. This component is included in the Fire Warrior install process - the game cannot run without it. Please re-install from the original CD."" Then I have only one option is to click ""Ok"" to close the box but once I click Ok another box appears saying; ""The Managed DirectX components for Microsoft .NET were not detected on this machine. This component is included  In the Fire Warrior install process -  the game cannot run without it. Please re-install from the original CD."" And yet again there is only one way to close the box is by clicking ""Ok"". When I try to install the DirectX it says I have already a newer version of this and there is no need to install it again! But the messages about installing the DirectX still appears!!!! Can someone please help me!?!
Thx for your time"

,xqmxqm,2008-05-17T19:53Z,I installed the game but when i entered it always crashed upon starting and said the .exe encountered problems and would now close bla bla bla. Anyone can tell me why?
,Warhammerguy,2008-05-27T02:23Z,Geting same error message as barkerBrig12 plz help
,pilgrim45,2008-08-13T22:45Z,"I'm getting a ""Wrong CD"" style message.  Srsly, how is this supposed to work?  I hate to be an idiot, but can we get some kind of walk thru here?"
,Cody900,2008-08-21T23:25Z,"For everyone getting the ""The Microsoft .NET Framework1.1 was not detected on this machine. This component is included in the Fire Warrior install process - the game cannot run without it. Please re-install from the original CD."" error, just run FireWarrior.exe directly. The launcher is screwed up is all.

@pilgrim45: Either keep the first CD mounted, or download a mini image from GameCopyWorld and mount that to save space."

,Mephiles,2009-02-24T15:49Z,I'm just getting FireWarrior.exe encountered an error and needs to close blah blah... Help? D:
,Norvine,2009-04-25T08:13Z,"I got this because I had a copy of the game but it F'd up and I really wanted to play this game, but when I mount the first disc's iso, which works fine but then it asks for the second disc, I mount it and and it says its the wrong disc. Can someone help me or make an install guide or something?"
,Norvine,2009-04-25T08:29Z,"Nevermind, I fixed it, just needed to use deamon tools."
,arjay2277,2009-06-09T13:25Z,"Does this game actually run? Having lots of bad experiences with Warhammer games.. Think they should stick to models, if anybody has got this to work without a seirous amount of work going into it please comment so I know it's worth my time downloading..?"
,Grimesss,2009-06-26T03:56Z,"Ok Solution guys. with this game im using Vista, these are 2 ISO files use Daemon tools or MagicISO to mount them.

Dont worry about ""The Microsoft .NET Framework1.1"" and the other stupid errors like ""binkw32.dll"", DO NOT install the game in Program Files.. All i did was make a new folder on your Desktop called Anything ""Tau"" whatever.... i only made a new folder in desktop because i did it with Half Life 2 and had good results lol. 

Now actually after i installed it in the new folder i was still clueless, so i typed in ""binkw32.dll"" into my Start Search to find the file. i opened the file location an clicked on FireWarrior Application to try again an bam ... it worked? haha so yeah im guessing you cant install it in Progam Files for Vista users im not sure about Xp. 

Remember This is for VISTA users not exactly sure the program files problem is a problem for Xp. "
,chaoslordx13,2009-10-10T18:40Z,"This isnt the worst game ever, its pretty fun, yes the ai is retarded but I can lists games with the same problem"
,Schlifer,2010-01-06T23:25Z,Grimesss thank you for that comment it helped me out a lot works 100% made a map on desktop ignored the errors my install got lagged removed it with task manager checked map and started it up with application flawlessly running on windows vista
,Schlifer,2010-01-06T23:29Z,"Sorry for double post but can not edit, yea this game is plain and yea FPS stile it can be recommended for top 10 worst FPS game but that is Mechanics storyline is good it is a warhammer universe and i liked the trip of fights good cinematic i am replaying it right now as i missed it and as all other warhammer games they never disappoint me in story line to bad it feels like they rushed firewarrior oh well love the game XD"
,Dezzo90p,2010-07-04T15:38Z,"Those of you who can't launch the Game (when you try to launch the Game nothing happens), go to the directory where the game is installed and launch the Game by double clicking the 'FireWarrior.exe' (it usually just says 'FireWarrior')"
,Conipto,2011-03-16T05:26Z,"Has anyone yet addressed the problems with the .exe itself? When I try to run directly from that, it tells me it's encountered an error and has to close. For that matter, has anyone yet figured out how to fix any of the ridiculous problems with the run files?"
,kajolo,2011-05-07T21:44Z,THX I GIVE 2 THUMBS Up :D

,MAA11792,2012-07-05T07:59Z,..as always I forgot to mention that I'm running/ installed this on Windows 7 Home Premium x64.
