Contrary to popular belief, Windows does NOT view external USB-based hard drives as
removable media - they are considered to be hard drives, just like the internal hard drive in your
system.
Why do you care? B ecause individual hard drives can O NLY be encrypted during the original
SGE installation. If you have an external USB hard drive, and you wish it to be encrypted, then
attach it to your system, configure it as the ?D? or ?E? drive PRIOR to installation, and it will be
encrypted at the time of installation.
BUT, here?s the rub: Once that USB drive is encrypted, it cannot be unencrypted without
decrypting the ALL the encrypted drives. Similarly, you can NOT uninstall the encryption
software unless ALL the original physical hard drives that were connected at the time of
installation are also connected at the time of the de-installation."
