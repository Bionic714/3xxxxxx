,ASoberIrishman32,2007-06-14T08:25Z,"to randomguy: some people don't have unlimited funds of money, and can't pay for every good cause that comes along. I don't mean to be a dick about this, seriously. I'm personally planning on buying it but I don't have any money at the moment so this is getting me by."
,Matt5413,2007-06-19T04:34Z,"If you really wanted to ""Save Darfur"" with money you'd download the album and put the entire price of the CD towards a charity."
,Matt5413,2007-06-19T04:40Z,"ummmm is this the right album? the tracklisting is all different on amazon - this appears to be some of  disc 1 and 2 mixed, plus songs not on the album...?"
,randomguy12,2007-06-22T08:43Z,"lol guys, I guess I was just a bit overexaggerating my opinion. i went out and bought the 2-disc set yesterday and I really like it. 

to Matt: 100% of the profits from the album go to Amnesty International's campaign to stop the genocide and to help the people of Sudan, so it is like giving to charity

If you have enough money to have a computer and interet, then you probably can afford to give a little to charity, but I'm not going to get involved. 

Peace :)"
,gomisensei,2007-07-03T09:33Z,"The profits... that means after the record company takes their 90%, the remains after production costs, hotel fees, etc, the rest goes to a foundatuion who promises that after they take their agent fee, they'll  give the rest to someone who claims to be associated with the campaign...  In the meantime, if you just donate to the campaign directly after downloading this, 100% of the money will go to step 4...  Something to think about, trust no corporate record company dickheads..."

,(Joel),2007-07-21T13:09Z,Fucking disrespectful to post this file here
,cablemonkey,2007-07-25T01:20Z,"Matt5413: You have it right....if you want to donate to this charity, DO NOT BUT THIS ALBUM.  Instead, donate directly to the charity.  Then they get all of the money...not just the profit."
,Gnosse,2007-07-30T22:35Z,You Fuckhead! This should'nt be here! Everybody should go to the store and buy it. Everyone that downloads this one should be ashamed of themselves.
,chapt_90,2007-07-31T17:26Z,Where's Disc2??? don't tell me u just uloaded the first disc!?!?!
,timgaulza,2007-08-17T14:13Z,"I don't really care about Darfur - Sudan is not the only African country.  When you bring out an album that directly assists those countries in need that have an impact on my life, maybe then I'll look and listen. (And buy)"
,Punks_4_Live,2007-08-17T21:21Z,"Hey guys... Please put your fingers away of this torrent. This Album is really to help people, not to ""pirate"" people.

If you really wanna have this album, offer these 20$ and pay for it. It makes no use to produce a CD which should make money for a poor country, if all people are downloading it from the internet.

I'm downloading many music CDs from the internet, but this time i really went out and bought this Album.
It's really worth paying for it!

Peace! "
,waccu,2007-08-31T16:09Z,"Hey ""punks_4_life"". Get real and down to earth again. If you really think that there arent any producers that is earning money on this cd, then you must be blond.
Any cd produced is earning money to the ones producing it.
Buy the way u should go and buy all the music that u download."
