,pilkjaer,2007-05-16T01:19Z,"thx for the release. really wanted to have it swedish. the only problem may occur, that people that use FAT32 file system won't be able to watch it due to lack of support of files more then 1gb... semi-final was splited into 3 files. i think you need to do the same. just to give everyone a chanse to download it"
,pilkjaer,2007-05-16T01:24Z,Some seeders will be nice!
,multimix222,2007-05-16T05:27Z,Anyone got the semifinal?
,boomii22,2007-05-16T07:58Z,Jag fattar inte? Varför lägga upp en torrentfil när man inte Seedar???? det är ju fan ingen som fått ner filen? 40 Leechar och ingen Seedar!!
