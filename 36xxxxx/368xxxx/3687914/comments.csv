Fuck paying Extra for Ultimate."
,manneman32,2007-05-14T18:27Z,"I know this works... but itÂ´s only a question of time until Microsoft finds a solution via Windows Update... 
I wonÂ´t be surprised if a legal copy of Vista Home Premium, or other version, will be banned after patching this... and for what use? 

Not worth it, man..."

5. Right click on themecpl.dll file, and click on Properties on right click menu.
6. Select the Security tab, then click Advanced.

20. Reboot computer.

I know it seems like alot, but trust me its good. 
also you will need to find some vid's for it as it comes with none. the just ""right click"" and enjoy"
,Reynardin,2008-09-10T08:07Z,"not working for me, and i can't access ""personalization"" in my control panel anymore.. i think it has something to do with that registry. Any way i can undo this?"
,X-machina,2008-09-12T17:08Z,"This works fine, do as it says.

some idiotic comments here, bish bash bosh, simple u have it.

Don't be put off by the file size, your computer is already capable to perform this action.

Dreamscene is a product, money as is Ultimate.

For the average computer this will affect cpu speeds....... bear this in mind.

yes some idiotic comments here."
,omegastar013,2008-11-14T11:46Z,herc01111 thank you that worked!
,ecstas_z,2008-12-02T00:48Z,It worked fine for me...  East to install too!   now I'm on a quest for more movies.

,Hobbes203,2009-08-13T06:50Z,"I followed the instructions both in the comments and the guide by the author. Both lead me to ""the page failed to load"" Any help?"
,blahspam1,2009-09-08T07:52Z,"Installed on vista 64 bit and did not work, in addition when I right click on the desktop and click personalize it says that the window cannot be displayed.  I ran a system restore which repaired windows and then downloaded a different dreamscene installer (the 64-bit one for windows 7) which worked fine on vista 64 bit.  Beware of this torrent as a quick google search will show a lot of people are having this same problem.  It may work for some... but clearly not others"
