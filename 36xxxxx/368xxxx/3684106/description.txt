This is a VHS to DVD rip of a BES WBTF 5 minute walk promo video. its kind a mockumentary of the guys. Its great.
its an ISO file. 
You need a program that can read ISO files (magic iso, Nero, etc) to burn to dvd, or extract. (win rar will do it too).

I paid $5 ($5!!!!!) for this 10 years ago. I should have bought all of them!
