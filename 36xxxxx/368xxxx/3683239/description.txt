From John Carpenter, the master of horror behind 1998s hit John Carpenters Vampires and classics like The Thing and Halloween, comes a sci-fi thriller full of explosive action and bone-chilling suspense. Natasha Henstridge (Species) is Melanie Ballard, a headstrong police lieutenant on Mars in the year 2025. Humans have been colonizing and mining on the red planet for some time, but when Ballard and her squad are sent to a remote region to apprehend the dangerous criminal James ?Desolation? Williams, played by Ice Cube (Three Kings), they discover that he?s the least of their worries. The mining operations have unleashed a deadly army of Martian spirits who take over the bodies of humans and wont stop until they destroy all invaders of their planet. With a stellar cast including Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Jason Statham (Snatch) and Clea Duvall (The Faculty), as well as explosive special effects, John Carpenters GHOSTS OF MARS is an intergalactic terror fest like you?ve never seen.
