
This movie is soo great, the first of the zombie movies or actually a remake of the first zombie movie. but it is very good, a must in the zombie collection yiiha :D

I belive that George A. Romeo had i fod inside the door of this produktion, and you can see that in the way the zombies are acting. its very good work and a good movie.
i would rate it 4 out of 5 :)

but watch it for our self and judge :)

enjoy

cheers
