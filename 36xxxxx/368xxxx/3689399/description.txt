"If you haven?t yet been introduced to the music of this prodigiously gifted singer and songwriter from Texas, you?re in for a major epiphany. And if you?ve been following Foster?s career ever since her self-released, 1997 debut, Full Circle, or even since her 2002 breakthrough, Runaway Soul, you?re in for an even bigger surprise, because you really haven?t ever heard Foster until you hear her now. Simply put, mama?s gotta brand new bag."
