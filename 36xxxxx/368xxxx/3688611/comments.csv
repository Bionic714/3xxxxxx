,BFMV_4LIFE,2010-04-30T08:23Z,why is episode 12 sooo huge??
,steveturner,2010-05-13T13:09Z,"@BFMV_4LIFE

The reason why episode 12 is a bigger file size than the rest is because it's a longer episode.
They practically fit two episodes into one episode, because the story of the episode couldn't be explained into just one.

This is pretty common to happen in TV series."
,unqjohnny,2010-05-29T14:41Z,@steveturner: You're wrong. That episode got a better resolution.
