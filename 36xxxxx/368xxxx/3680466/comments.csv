,raidhowiefan,2007-05-04T16:06Z,"thank you very much for the upload, i have been looking for this! i have not had much luck with any of the other versions. can i burn this ?
if so, which file do  i burn?"
,420dopeman,2007-05-04T17:35Z,"No need to burn mate.
Just unrar and start with sh3.exe inside the game folder.
And yes, its just that easy.
enjoy."
,raidhowiefan,2007-05-04T23:25Z,"thanx, already playing game , its great! i served

,F1977,2007-05-11T09:41Z,"Very nice dopeman, however is there any chance of an sound addon to be uploaded here? Speech is needed to listen to recieved orders."
,420dopeman,2007-05-11T19:21Z,English speech is all here. Only GERMAN speech has been removed.
,420dopeman,2007-05-11T19:28Z,"you can browse to data/sound/Speech_En inside game floder to see it all there.

cheers."

,WildWelshWarezWebWizard,2007-12-13T18:41Z,"Thank you for the RIP.

,Plasma_Kat,2008-10-02T21:07Z,"Good effort, but this sort of sucks. You play as a GERMAN u-boat and you've ripped the German voices. For decent atmosphere you use those voices. American guys going ""YES SIR!"" doesn't make any sense."
,dominoes0987,2008-10-10T06:25Z,lichpixy sounds like ur graphics card is at fault had the same problem with brothers in arms might need a new 1.
,sailor0882,2008-12-05T02:34Z,when i click on sh3 it said can not initialize 3d engine
,GKraften,2008-12-06T13:17Z,"While I do believe I've DL'ed and run this before (successfully), I seem to rebmember it being a higher resolution than the standard 1024x768-ish one it comes with... But i can't find any options to change in this respect...

Has anyone else gotten it to run in 1280x1024 yet?"
,Hardroad,2008-12-12T20:48Z,"Just so everyone is aware of the facts with this torrent:

1) It is complete and self sustained. Dopeman created a perfect game mirror. ^5ss for that

2) Simply unrar it to a folder on your C Drive, create a shortcut for the SH3 executable, drag it to your desktop and play.

3) I've successfully added GWX 2.0 (d/l from 

http://www.thegreywolves.com/

and it installed quickly and simply. 

I've yet to test it with the GWX 2.1 update - but I don't see any reason why it won't work."
,Hardroad,2008-12-13T01:22Z,"Installed GWX 2.1 AND SHIII commander 3.1, complete success. "
,SgtKikkoman,2008-12-13T22:57Z,"Whenever I start this game up I get a black screen, never had a problem with a dopeman release before. My graphics card is a nvidia geforce 8600m gs on a intel core 2 duo 1.67 ghz cpu with 3gb of ram.....If I can run Fallout 3 and Grid with no probs why not this? 

Any help is appreciated "
,SgtKikkoman,2008-12-15T02:18Z,"nvm I found the fix on my own

,the_RHIN0,2009-05-17T22:23Z,"you are a GOD!!!

thanks for putting up with the tards!!!

at least it's pre-cracked so noobs won't whine how the crack is a ""Trojan"" 

swear to god ppl a crack IS a trojan!!!!
it's a virus that ONLY effects the program your cracking....
if your AV program uses heuristic scanning it APPEARS as a Trojan  

KUDOS dopeman!!!"
