Hey, everybody.

This is by far the biggest and best list we've done so far.  It spans seven pages, includes 300 (yes, 300) pics, and required nearly four hundred tons of concrete.  The result was the biggest and best list we've done so far.  By far.

Each of us (including our two new writers, Mark and Emily) have compiled a list, complete with pictures, of the women we would most like to shake hands with fuck.  Be sure to click on the pics; they'll take you to a larger version.

What?  We've sold out, you say?  We've sacrificed our trademark wit for scantily clad ladies?  We're ripping ideas from magazines written by queers who wear cologne, such as FHM or Maxim?  Well, true.  But we've got one thing they don't have.

Wait, no we don't.  Enjoy the list.
