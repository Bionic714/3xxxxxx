Version 1.2 of the setup disc is now available for download. It combines 
various applications into a single bootable disc. This release includes:

- wiikey configuration
- wiikey dvdDump (dumps discs to sdcard)
- some of the most popular gamecube homebrew apps:

- SDLoad 1.0 by Costis
- Snes9x 1.43 GX 0.5 Port by Softdev
- GCOs MultiGame Version by emu_kidid
- MFE Distro 1.0 by Isobel

We like to point out that this disc does not update the chips firmware
in any way. It merely adjusts the configuration stored in EEPROM.

what's next ?
==============================
Coming up next will be the first wiikey firmware update. Among some new
features/improvements, it will fix the audiostreaming bug, that causes 
several gamecube games to crash right now. More details will be 
announced soon on the official website."
