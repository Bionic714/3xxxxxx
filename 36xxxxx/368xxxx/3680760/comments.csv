And there are two identical files for many of the songs.. -This thing could really do with a clean up!"
,fastfreddy12,2008-02-16T01:46Z,"Nice upload. Lots of stuff not readily available otherwise. But like it's been said, some of the files are mislabeled. They've put the titles for Disc one of Now The Truth Can Be Told on the files for disc two. I'm still in the process of downloading this torrent, but I don't see Disc One anywhere.  The Squintlets are interesting, though. I've never heard them before."
,loylachick,2008-08-25T08:38Z,I am downloading this right now!!!! Thanks alot! I have been looking for Squint! I use to have the tape but that got lost somewhere and is so inconvenient now anyways because I don't even own a tape player anymore.
