,jamesccostello,2008-12-31T08:33Z,"Sorry for upload speed you guys, but I don't have too much money to spend on an Internet connection.  All I've got is 220 kilobit/sec upload and I share it with 3 other people who just surf the web.  If I use more than 12kbps upstream, they start to notice, and they disconnect me."

I hit the stunningly high dl rate of 16 kbps last night, now I am at zero; most of the time I hover around 3.2 kbps.

Anyone know why this is so slow relative to everything else?"

,bundoodle,2010-06-01T03:29Z,"downloaded the whole 5 seasons in just over 2 days , which is not bad for the size of it . top job Hagis2k . even tho it says their are only 4 seeders , there is actually over 180 . i am 1 of them . i will leave this to seed foreva @ a min of 300kbs . just remember ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.  i aint drinking no god damn milk sukka"
