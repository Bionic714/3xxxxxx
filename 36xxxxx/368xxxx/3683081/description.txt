==PLOT===============================\

200 years from now, mankind has reached the stars, colonised new worlds,
contacted new races and fought new wars on the frontiers of known space. It is
the dawn of a new age.

Babylon 5 is a space station in the late 23rd Century - a centre of diplomacy
and trade, in neutral space located between many rival space empires.

The project's success, already shaky, is put further in doubt when incoming
Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is the key suspect in the attempted assassination
of Kosh, a mysterious alien ambassador.

The Gathering is the feature length pilot episode for the award-winning
Babylon 5 TV series.
