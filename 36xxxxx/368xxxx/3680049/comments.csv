,flipperguy,2007-05-28T04:42Z,"@svampbobx 
Of course you can't.. When you have THAT terrible taste in music, you can't expect people to cut you some slack... It's beside the point where I come from- I hate the song that represented my country as well. My point was that the only 2 songs that actually stood out from the rest of the mediocre dancehall music-should have won. Then ESC would have been more in tune with what's going on in the music industry in general (and of course this could have ment that the competition would have been taken more seriously, each country would probably send better artist next year, and in the end- the winner could actually stand a chance to establish themselves internationally. THAT hasn't happen since Abba...). Instead it took a giant leap backwards (not in a retro cool way, but in a lame,- outdated way). Mark my words: In 5 years- the Finnish singer and the Swedish band will still perform at clubs all over Europe,record cd's etc. The rest of the garbage will be drifting into obscurity, as it has happened over and over for the last 33 years. What's the point of competing in MUSIC, when most of the songs in doesn't doesn't stand a chance OUTSIDE Esc?? Not comercially, nor quality wise. This is NOT about musical taste etc, etc. This is about the parody that ESC is. I can of course understand the patriotism element in here, it's always fun to watch a competition between ""your country"" and the rest of Europe. But if you base your cd collection on what's going on in ESC, your probably not the kinda person people would ask for advice concerning music.."
,flipperguy,2007-05-28T04:56Z,"Just to make it clear.. My comments aren't directed towards the uploader. You deserve to be thanked regardless of what I or anyone else thinks of your torrent! So THANX, even though I'll pass on this one ;-)"
