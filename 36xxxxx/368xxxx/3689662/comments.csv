,osetinka,2008-03-16T08:32Z,post when you get the third out if you haven't already
,galacticat,2008-06-30T07:56Z,movies are not books. books are not movies. sometimes a teensy bit of juggling must be done. why aren't you people bitching about the absence of quickbeam and tom bombadil? why were scenes that appear in the book edited out? what the hell kind of purists are these people anyhow?
,12levelsfightgear,2009-10-02T20:24Z,i have enjoyed theses movies and think that lord of the rings is possibly the best trilogy out there star wars is great by all meens dont get me wrong star wars is the best but l.o.r. is pretty close
