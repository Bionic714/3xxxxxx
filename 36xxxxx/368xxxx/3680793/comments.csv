this albums fairly slow paced, never liked manson much, but this album isn't about to get me into him.

the torrent it's self is good quality though :)"

Have you ever heard his message before. 
Shut you mouth about things you know nothing of."
,masonstorm136,2007-05-27T14:54Z,"DzzT - get a life. You are a legend in your own lunchtime. Manson has no real message, by his own admission he is an allround media entertainer and if he can make money by adding a shock element then he will. That makes him one hell of a marketing genius. Now go wash off that make up, clean off your nail varnish and get a life."

I agree with DzzT, do not talk of such you know nothing of. Take another look at his life, his lyrics and reflect! Then you'll find a greater message than your mother had giving birth to you. And, again, don't target people you want nothing to do with"
,Alith,2007-07-15T14:16Z,"A message? Oh, come on. People like Bono have a message - people like Manson, well, don't. And for the record, U2 bores me to tears. 

Manson is just a show, but it's a damn good one."
