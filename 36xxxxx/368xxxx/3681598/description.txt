Achtung Baby
Is the seventh studio album by Irish rock band U2, released on November 19, 1991. The album arrived nearly two years after lead vocalist Bono announced the band would have to "go away and dream it all up again", following the mixed response to 1988's Rattle and Hum. The album marks a dramatic change in the band's sound, taking on alternative and dance influences in the rhythms, denser, more detailed production, and more guitar effects, as well as darker and more personal lyrical content. The effect reflecting the textures of then-emergent techno and electronic music as well as the innovations of younger post-punk and noise-rock groups such as Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine and the trippy dance-rock fusions of then-contemporary Madchester groups. The results were considerably more adventurous and less traditionally rock-based as their previous efforts, and opinion seems generally divided between this and The Joshua Tree album as U2's defining record.
