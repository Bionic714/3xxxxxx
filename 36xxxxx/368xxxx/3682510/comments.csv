,howhy,2007-08-05T14:31Z,"i am stuck on 97.7% but i opened file & was able to watch the whole though theri were few frame misses, This is 30 min short film , Unfortunately it was the movie that i was expecting, in that movie theri was a time piece lying near the guy sleeping who was locked with this time bounce phenomenon. Concept of movie is same . good to watch !!!"
