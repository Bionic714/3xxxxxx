INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS BELOW:
NOTE: THIS GAME DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY SERIAL AT ALL, JUST INSTALL -> PLAY..

====STEP ONE: Install the Game.====
Run the setup file and install it to for example C:WestwoodA Path Beyond

====STEP TWO: Update the Game.==== (Optional)
Once you finish installing the game it is recommended that you
copy the files inside "Optional_But_Recommended" folder to the
folder where you installed the game.

It will install several updates to the game and include new
maps. I included them with the torrent so you are pretty
much "up2date out of the torrent".

====STEP THREE: Configure the Game.===
Run the WWConfig.exe utility to configure the settings the game should
run in. Resolution, Colordepth, Detail settings, Anti Aliasing etc..

====FINAL STEP: Lets PLAY!!!===
Run ApbIP.exe to connect to the official 100 player server from the APB Development Team:

Renegade Executable: 	C:WestwoodA Path Beyondrenalert.exe  <- change this to where you installed the game obviously
Additional Commands: 	+password "abcdabcd"  <- In case you join a passworded server simply change abcdabcd.. (Official server is not passworded)

Server Name: 	MP-Gaming.com Official APB Server
Server IP: 	208.101.57.18
Server Port:	9999

Click save. Then click connect. Next time you startup ApbIP you can select the 
server from the dropdown list :)

Alternatively you can also create a shortcut on your desktop and use for example:
c:westwoodapathbeyondrenalert.exe +connect 208.101.57.18:9999 +netplayername "mynickname" +password "somepass"
then double click that shortcut to launch the game and connect to the server :)

Have fun playing a kick-ass game with roughly 2000+ more players and still
increasing every day!
