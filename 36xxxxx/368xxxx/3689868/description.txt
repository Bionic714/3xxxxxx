Shane Wolfe is a Navy SEAL, he is very serious about his work and very dedicated to discipline. 
His mission was to protect a professor who created a program called GHOST and unfortunately 
the professor is killed, but he disk is still out, so Shane is asked to protect the professor's family 
and try to retrieve the disc, otherwise he has become the new nanny and may find it a bit harder 
disciplining tough strong guys to 5 horrific children.

The Pacifier, well, you can predict one scene after the next, but this movie was intended for kids, 
so it's all good. I loved the scene where the Russian nanny tried to leave and Shane freaked out and 
tried to grab her from leaving the door, honestly, if that scene didn't make you laugh, check your 
funny bone. To those who haven't seen the film yet, go ahead and give it a chance, it's a good family film.
