Once Upon a Time in the West (originally released in Italy in 1968 under the title C'era una volta il West) and released in USA May 1969, is an epic spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone.

Its critical acclaim has led some to declare it "the greatest Western ever made".[1][2]

The film stars Henry Fonda unusually cast as the villain Frank, Charles Bronson as his nemesis "Harmonica," Jason Robards as the generally benign bandit Cheyenne, and Claudia Cardinale as a newly-widowed homesteader with a past, Jill.

It is the first part of a loose trilogy of epic, elegiac films that examine social and political issues from American history. It is followed by 1971's A Fistful of Dynamite (known alternatively as Once Upon a Time... The Revolution or Duck, You Sucker) and 1984's Once Upon a Time in America.
