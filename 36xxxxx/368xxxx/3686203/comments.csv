,Theman-man,2007-05-13T19:22Z,"dopeman*

(sry double post)"
,420dopeman,2007-05-14T08:54Z,"justpoo , no problem with it, im just keeping on and off the listings, more off then on, otherwise there would be like 1000 leechers right now. Im trying to keep it off the listings so it will seed faster. So, just hang in, looks like evryone at a whopping 65% for now, should be about 12 hours till completion, 

so no, no problem, just trying to keep the leechers from getting to many in numbers, in 'hopes' of faster seeding time.

cheers mate. just keep d/ling, will pots it back up towards completion of the seeding.

greeeetz."

,Obliviator,2007-05-16T16:01Z,"F Y I

I downloaded without any problems, but was unable
to un-rar. Risk of damaged files (as often with rar)"
,420dopeman,2007-05-16T17:04Z,"Theman-man 

I wish I could dude, its just honestly not that easy, and every game is different.

I have been doing this for years, just recently in the last few months decided to start sharing them.

I learned by reverse-engineering old-school 'scene' rips from groups like 'myth' and 'class' 'divine' etc.

sorry cant be of more help mate. Study my games, take them apart, view the insides, files, ect, compare them to the original games, and maybe you will start to learn from there.

cheers."

thom"
,PVT.chicken,2008-04-16T20:25Z,"to anybody looking for an honest review on this game (i know theres one here) here are the pros and cons
Pros:
well setup. controls well (once you get it customized to your liking). just the right amount of realism (holstering weapons in public, etc.) car driving is amazing. very realistic. (i wasnt used to how the car handled at first, and i side swiped a pole. this would usually caus the car to just stop, but it actually spun out. very cool)

cons:
sometimes the AI is a little bit... lackluster. and by some times, i mean alot. theres no real aiming feature, just the expanding crosshairs. very linear (from what i could tell)

but all in all, this is an amazing game if your computer isnt exactly a beast for graphics. it looks good, but can run well. im downloading this in hopes that it works P: but if it goes crazy on me, im definitely going to go and buy it. but to be honest, even though i have bad luck with game rips, dopeman is insanely good with his torrents. from what ive seen, theyre always the best you can get. keep it up dopeman, big fan!

but just in case you didnt know, you can just go to gamespot.com or another site and download the mafia demo for free. i suggest that. because 1. youre not going along with a stranger(that has no idea what you like)'s opinion, and 2. you get to see if it runs well on your cpu.

hope i could be of assistance. keep kickin ass dopeman."

Please dopeman, 4give me for telling this but just try it on your own system, do a search in the registry for the name Mafia, export it and give it as .reg files. We can add it manually and I LOVE UR TORRENTS AND MAFIA RIP WAS DAMN AMAZING - except for this"

,mihailo17,2008-07-07T23:17Z,"If your game crashes on the ''a trip to the country'' mission when you enter the warehouse try this, it worked for me. 

Load ""the priest-escape"" save game and replay it. This time around, during the next mission ""A trip to the country- Salieri Bar"" try picking a different car from the lot to drive to the warehouse. 

I cannot remember which car I selected the first time when the game crashed, but when I picked the ""Bolt V8 Roadster"" (the one that becomes available by talking to the mechanic this mission) I was able to continue through the level. I hope it works for you guys, great game."

After watching The Sopranos to the fith season and see how the American - Italian mafia works, even though its just a TV Show, this game was great - well I thought so - but thats my opinion, but I can tell that the graphics sucks though. And i've watched lots and lots of other mafia movies like The Godfather, Good Fellas, Scarface and more.. :) "

Mesko2: Are you using winrar?
Just  rightclick on the zipfile and choose unrar.
If that doesn't work I would guess you either have an incomplete download or something's wrong with your winrar."

,Picaresque,2009-05-01T19:04Z,"Hey, everyone having the ""Generic #"" issue when opening the game itself, pay attention, this may make you feel as stupid as I did when I couldn't figure it out at first. When you open the setup.exe for Mafia and get all your little graphic tweaking done, you may need to specify the resolution the game will start in. It confused the shit out of me, probably because it was so damn simple. Hope you enjoy the game, and kudos to Dopeman for yet another fucking great upload. You sir, win."

,_Aurum_,2012-07-27T21:08Z,"Hey guys, great torrent and everything, brilliant really, but please hear me out, I'm having a graphics problem.  The objects in game all appear twisted and deformed most of the times.

I've tried almost every single graphic option and tested it but nothing changed this problem, I think this usually happens when an installation goes wrong, but I'm not sure.

What's more, there are no new drivers available for my graphics card (Intel 829etc) so that isn't an option. Could you help me out pls? :x (seeding)"
