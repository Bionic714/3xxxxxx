SINOPSIS: Johnny Hooker, a small time grifter, unknowingly steals from Doyle Lonnegan, a big time crime boss, 

when he pulls a standard street con. Lonnegan demands satisfaction for the insult. After his partner, Luther, 

is killed, Hooker flees, and seeks the help of Henry Gondorff, one of Luther's contacts, who is a master of 

the long con. Hooker wants to use Gondorff's expertise to take Lonnegan for an enormous sum of money to even 

the score, since he admits he "doesn't know enough about killing to kill him." They devise a complicated 

scheme and amass a talented group of other con artists who want their share of the reparations. The stakes 

are high in this game, and our heroes must not only deal with Lonnegan's murderous tendencies, but also other 

side players who want a piece of the action. To win, Hooker and Gondorff will need all their skills...and a 

fair amount of confidence.
