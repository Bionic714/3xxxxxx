Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols is a 1977 album recorded by the seminal English punk band, Sex Pistols. It is now regarded as a classic and influential rock and roll and punk rock album by many fans and critics alike.

The album was released on October 28, 1977 on the Virgin Records label, amid controversy arising from the use of the obscenity (in British english) "bollocks" in its title. It is the only "official" album recorded by the Sex Pistols in their short 2┬╜ year career, although the songs have appeared on many compilation albums (the group had effectively disbanded less than three months after its release). Additionally, many of the songs were featured in the film, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, a "mockumentary" loosely based on the Sex Pistols, but more about their infamous manager (and the film's mastermind), Malcolm McLaren and his stated goal of "making a million pounds".

Older versions of most of these songs also appear on a bootleg album called Spunk, which consists of demo recordings the band had made during 1976 and January 1977, which was released shortly before Never Mind the Bollocks.

A special deluxe edition is rumoured to be released in Autumn 2007 to mark the 30th anniversary of the albums release.
