The moment you open the box to Rebel Trucker: Cajun Blood Money and discover that the game actually displays two different ESRB ratings (M on the box, E on the instruction manual),you should take a moment to savor whatever slight amusement can be derived from this bizarre oversight, because this moment of levity will likely be the last one Rebel Trucker provides.In fact, this printer's gaffe is only the very beginning of a lengthy downward spiral that takes Rebel Trucker into depths that rival any of the worst games currently available on today's gaming market. Rebel Trucker is a huge mess of a game that is riddled with grievous bugs, badly designed in every measurable capacity, and completely lacking in any conceivable dimension of fun. How exactly Rebel Trucker made it onto store shelves in its obviously unfinished state is a mystery, but whatever the case, it is easily one of the worst games released this year, on any platform.Rebel Trucker is one of the buggiest, most sloppily designed games released this year.In Rebel Trucker, you play as Keri Thibodeaux, a sad-sack mullet-sporting Southerner looking for some direction in life. Upon seeing an ad on TV advertising the glamorous life of a trucker, Keri is off to start his trucking career, and along the way, he gets tangled up with a group of Italian mobsters who run the majority of New Orleans' smuggling operations, a pair of FBI agents bent on bringing down the mob, and a pigtailed, tightly shirted Southern belle by the name of Maria Sue. The game's story actually comes into play in only one of the three basic modes of gameplay that follow the game's brief, and useless, training level. The three modes are broken up into job offers from different companies: Vieux Carre Routes, which consists of a series of short-distance delivery jobs; AAA Long Hauls, where you'll have to travel lengthy distances delivering cargo, while also maintaining logs of your rest stops, gas-ups, and weigh-ins in order to stay compliant with state trucking regulations; and Stromboli Import Export Trucking, which is the story mode.
