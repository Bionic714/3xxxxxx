About:

In the aftermath of the terrible war started by Sigma in the
previous  game,  the  human  race has constructed a new line of
Reploids  to help them expand  beyond Earth's shattered remains
and  colonize  the  untouched  Moon.   Unfortunately, Sigma has
corrupted  these  Reploids  with his sinister DNA and its up to
X,  Zero,  and  Axl  to  stop  him before it's too late. 

And so begins  Mega  Man  X8,  that mixes the 3D aspects of X7 
and the old-school gameplay of X6.Boasting twelve stages in all,
X8 offers three Completely different playable characters,a more
flexible tag team mechanic,upgradeable weaponry, vehicle-based
missions,and multiple cinematic endings. Enjoy as much as my Kids!.
