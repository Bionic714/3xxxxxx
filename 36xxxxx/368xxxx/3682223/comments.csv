,back1ply,2008-06-18T18:28Z,Hi Subzero! and ToeD  i have 1 request can you put the game in 1 rar why put it in 7 or 4 
,Skaramuche,2008-08-03T06:57Z,"This thing just doesn't make sense.  Comments and its sketchy behavior once torrented point to virus, number of torrents from this uploader and this ripper and number of people seeding them point to authentic.  But either way I see dancing pot and rotating checkered cube, nothing else.  Help?"
,gaz23,2008-10-07T23:33Z,"@the people who say there is a virus in one of subzero's uploads.

GET A LIFE YOU STUPID FUCKING RETARD'S!!!!!!

there is no virus in any of toed's work it's the byte 2 byte check of them like he explain's in most of his torrent's.

WORKS 100%, NO VIRUS

,Super_Drunk,2010-02-13T14:08Z,"Ummm, this looks ligit, but I can't get it to work :( When attempting to open the RockmanX8 exe, I get FILE NOT FOUND ""snd\eg\common\common.req"" what gives?"
,Donalddln,2010-02-14T13:12Z,"To all of you retards who think there is a trojan in the file, it's not. It's called a false-positive. The way ToeD does their ripping makes anti-viruses think that. ToeD is a respectable group among torrents and Subzero! is a respectable member of the group so go suck a dick and stop leaving false messages for other people who are new. "
,inflikkt,2010-05-04T04:15Z,i dont get it. i dont see an exe anywhere after running this shady program... where does it even install to?
