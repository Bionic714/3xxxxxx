Shaolin Iron Claws (1978)

Plot:	Wong Tai and Lee Yi Min team up to do battle with the dreaded Silver Fox and master of the Northern Mantis style after they learn of a plot to overthrow the Ming Government. More top-notch fight scenes from the "7 Commandments Of Kung Fu" team.

Overview:	At the beginning of the republic, an ex-Ching lord (Chan Sing) forces a group of ex-Ching ministers to sign a declaration for the re-establishment of the Ching Dynasty. This declaration falls into the hands of a provincial police cheif (Wong Tao) and all hell breaks loose.

A fine dramatic kung fu movie with an outstanding cast. The fight action is superb, with Wong Tao in serious form; and Lee Yi Min also adds martial sparkle. The true star, however, is Chang Yi as the top villain, who lets off some mean mantis.
