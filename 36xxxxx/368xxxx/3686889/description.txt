Overview:	Respected veteran Yueh Feng made this ?Martial Arts World? saga of a masked master of the ?Black Sand Hand Technique,? while Lily Ho, the star of "Princess Iron Fan" and "Angel With The Iron Fists", excels in a delightful dual leading role. When she teams up with Shu Pei-pei as a fellow swordswoman to vanquish a murdering robber, the comparisons to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" are obvious, even though it came three decades later.
