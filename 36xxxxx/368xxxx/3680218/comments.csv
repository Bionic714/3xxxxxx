,Draco_kal,2009-02-12T12:16Z,"Why did you save it as a .mkv file, I've spent 15 minutes trying to figure out why I couldn't run it with VLC, and now I have to download more programs just to watch a 45 minute show. Fuck you, next time use .avi you filthy elitist nerd. "
,mrsillyx11,2009-03-27T18:56Z,"Its probably your 15 year old computer it to slow to play hd movies anyway. MKV is a much better wrapper than the outdated avi. MKV supports larger video files, multiple audio & subtitle tracks. Its a stupid 200k download, even on your 14.4 modem that will only take one minute. http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Matroska_Splitter.htm Maybe someone will be nice enough to repost this is a 320x240 mpeg1 video for you."
