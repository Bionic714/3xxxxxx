,uull,2007-05-09T20:29Z,"How to license Autodesk AutoCAD 2008 x64:


What you need:

1. Windows XP x86 or Windows Vista x86 installed;
2. Autodesk AutoCAD 2008 x32 installed and activated;
3. Windows XP x64 or Windows Vista x64 installed;
4. Autodesk AutoCAD 2008 x64 installed.

This can be done using a dual boot setup or between computers. Basically you will only need an x86 Autodesk AutoCAD 2008 to generate the license file for your x64 Autodesk AutoCAD 2008.


The 32-bit Autodesk AutoCAD 2008 keygen version does not detect the x64 setup screen and using the x64-bit provided code on a 32-bit environment produces an invalid registration code.

So follow these steps:

1. In x86 OS go to Start -> All programs -> Autodesk -> AutoCAD 2008 ... click on the ""Portable License Utility"";

2. Inside the ""Portable License Utility"" under Computers tab click ?Add...? and fill the fields accordingly with your x64 OS. To know what is your Autodesk AutoCAD 2008 x64 ""Identification Code"" just open ""Portable License Utility"" on your x64 OS.

3. On ?Licenses? tab click ""Export license..."" and save it somewhere on the HDD.

4. In x64 OS go to Start -> All programs -> Autodesk -> AutoCAD 2008 ... click on the ""Portable License Utility"" and under ?Licenses? tab choose ""Import License"" from the saved file;

5. Enjoy!


After completing the steps above you should have your Autodesk AutoCAD 2008 x64 installed and activated."
