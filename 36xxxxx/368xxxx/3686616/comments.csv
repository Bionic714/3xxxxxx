,LezDawson,2008-09-25T01:57Z,"Such high hopes, and then, so disappointed!  
This is tedious.  The interviewer is more interested in talking about his own ideas than Woody's, and the whole thing is cut together in an arty-farty way, with intermittent random bursts of annoying music that drown out the talk.  Ugh.  How French.  How nauseating."
