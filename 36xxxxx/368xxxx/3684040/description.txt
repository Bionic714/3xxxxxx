Guitarist Wolf Hoffman, best known for his work with the metal band Accept, released the solo project CLASSICAL, an album of instrumental classical pieces. Hoffmann's approach to well-known compositions like "Pomp & Circumstance" and "Bolero" is technically impressive and doesn't skimp on the distortion.
