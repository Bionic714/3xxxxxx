,ElgerHz,2007-05-09T00:47Z,"Some info about two of the tracks on this album:

The original norwegian title of ""In The Hall Of The Mountain King"" is ""I Dovregubbens Hall"", this and ""Solveig's Song"" was composed by Edvard Grieg to be used in the play ""Peer Gynt"" by the norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. Several bands have made versions of ""In The Hall Of The Mountain King/I Dovregubbens Hall"", you can find a list here: http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Dovregubbens_hall"
