This is the 2004 Isle Of Wight Music Festival headlined by David Bowie and The Who. One very important note to remember is that this is NOT the DVD version sold in stores. Not by a long shot No, its the High Definition version shown on the HD channel on digital cable. The difference is huge. First off the quality is superb as well as the sound and second the most important is it contains much more footage. For example The Stereophonics set contains something like 5 more songs than the DVD. Anyway I transferred it from DVD to avi since most people prefer it that way but since it is HD Im going to seed the DVD version next for
all you with HD sets. Well enjoy...
