  
  Hope you all like the L&H movies, I have whole bunch
of DVD┬┤s to start seeding later on to... But... Ppl could
get much better in the nobel art of seeding.

Why not remember some good manners, to continue seeding a file
after you have finished downloading, to help out others.
Whats the point of uploading a torrent if the downloaders
just don't give a crap?
