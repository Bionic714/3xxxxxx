,FatFreddy176,2010-02-23T08:06Z,"I did read from the comments that:

1. THIS TORRENT IS MISLABELED
2. THIS TORRENT IS *NOT* FERROX ISO LOADER
3. THIS TORRENT IS FOR ""Swiss Army Knife"" FOR PS3

But I wanted SAK anyways so I'm downloading anyways.

BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR FERROX, THIS IS A MISLABELED TORRENT AND IS NOT FERROX."
