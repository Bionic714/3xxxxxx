KIM Kardashian, Paris Hilton?s best friend, said she wasn?t selling the sex tape she made several years ago with Brandy?s younger brother, Ray J, because, ?I don?t need the money.? But someone else did. On Tuesday, porn purveyor Vivid Video bought the tape, which had been floating on the porn market for about a month, for $1 million from an unidentified source. The company plans to have a DVD titled ?Kim Kardashian Superstar? in stores by Feb. 28, with additional footage on kimksuperstar.com. Vivid co  chairman Steven Hirsch said, ?We are comfortable that we have the legal right to distribute this video . . . I?ve seen the video and it?s really great. It has over 30 minutes of explicit sex that fans of erotica will find very appealing . . . Apparently, the video was shot by Ray J about three years ago when he and Kim were in a relationship. Viewers will definitely get their money?s worth.? A rep for Kardashian said, ?Are you [bleep]ing me? Kim is going to die . . . are you sure?? Later, he added, ?She will be taking legal action against anyone responsible for this. She was unaware of this and caught completely off  guard.? Ray J could not be reached.
