[T],vrolok,2007-05-09T20:45Z,"swizzla, if you click on ""To Others"" and then choose VOB, you'll get dvd format"
,swizzla,2007-05-11T05:38Z,Thanks vrolok that works for me

,dzeno76,2007-05-14T00:13Z,"This converter SUX!!!! 
after putting 10-15 files to convert(music videos) it shots down by it self and i had to do it all over again several times.
After more then 2 hours of converting the files most of them didnt have sound, some played at double speed and rest didnt convert at all.
What a waste of time and my nerves...."
[T],vrolok,2007-05-14T16:18Z,"dzeno76: Converting video files is a process that requires a lot from the CPU and if you are, like in this case, trying to convert 15 different files at once (which is demanding for the computer just itself) and maybe running other programs while converting may affect the result. 

If it doesn't work, maybe there's a problem on your computer or maybe your computer doesn't have the requirements that is needed for running this program.

Reinstalling the software may work."
[T],vrolok,2007-05-14T16:18Z,*Reinstalling the software could work.
[T],vrolok,2007-05-14T19:34Z,dramalady: I'm not 100 percent sure but i think that .ogg is only an audio format so far so your file is mostly like an audio file. You should download an other version of the episode.
[T],vrolok,2007-05-14T19:41Z,correct me if I'm wrong
,fittland,2007-05-14T22:45Z,"Is it posible to convert from xvid to dvd, and then burn in sub's such as ""srt"""
,swalker23,2007-05-15T00:59Z,need lil help I dl some old Kung Fu movies from the TPB and they are in .rmvb format.  The problem is when I convert them to any format to put on DVD for my dad the  video and audio are out of sync.  Is it the file or the converter I'm not used to dealing with .rmvb files don't know if .rmvb is a crap video file.
,Ericsson.88,2007-05-15T18:43Z,Guys download this torrent ! really good and fast . 200kb\s whit 8mbit =)
[T],vrolok,2007-05-16T10:11Z,"fittland: I don't think that you can burn in subtitles with this program (well you can always try..), but you can convert to a VOB format. Look for a dvd editing program and you can mostly like add subtitles to your video.

swalker23: Magic Video Converter supports many formats, such as RMVB so I'm 99% sure that it's the file that is bad encoded."
