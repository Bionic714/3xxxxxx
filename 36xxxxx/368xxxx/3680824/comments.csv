,boboglf,2007-05-05T23:40Z,SEED..............this is something to keep and to remember about when you will be old... :p
,Scabass,2007-05-06T18:27Z,"btw..aside from the fact after 2 days of downloading and only at 13.3%..this game is protected by Starforce 

I hope that there is a decent work around included in this game."
,Scabass,2007-05-06T18:28Z,ok..maybe only a day it seems like two though ;)
,flyingdutchie,2007-05-14T18:58Z,"Can you translate this for me in english?
Installing the update module is no proplem but I can`t enter the activationcode.

1. Foloseste Daemon Tools 4 cu TOT activat
2. Instaleaza jocul
3. Fa ce-ti cere jocul la prima rulare.
4. Daca restartezi, scoate cablu IDE (si putere) de la toate CD-Rom-urile tale
5. Lanseaza jocul
6. Introdu urmatorul serial:
   FFMGU-HA34Y-V8ABF-VUN3Y-SCTRP
7. N-Joy si NU ma mai intreba de ce nu-ti merge!!!


8  In caz k o sa ati apara o eroare cand vrei sa dai drumu la joc ex:""GTL.exe was infected.....""
   faci asta : 

Thanks a lot, boboglf"

,GazJ83,2007-07-29T14:30Z,"I've downloaded the 5.01gig file and have started to follow the instructions. Everything is fine up to item 6 - ""Mount Alcohol 120% img and install the game"". I can't seem to find an 'Alcohol 120%"" img file anywhere in the downloaded folder. 

Any help?"
,GazJ83,2007-07-29T14:33Z,"Ok sorry, that was me not paying attention. Alcohol 120% is a piece of software like Daemon tools right?

Ok no problem - the ""GT Legends [DVD].mds"" file, when mounted does nothing. So, again ... any help?"
,GazJ83,2007-07-29T14:53Z,"Sorry - new to this site. 

Right - ignore my last comments as they are for another GT LEgends Torrent download.

With this one, it just says 1.Install. So, I've mounted the itw-gtl.mds file and launched the GTLLaunch.exe file, clicked install and that's it, nothing happens. Sorry for being a pain - any help?"

,dal2k,2008-01-18T13:01Z,Whats the difference between this torrent and the 2.3 gig torrent? I downloaded the 2.3 gig torrent like 1 or 2 years ago and there was no serial. I will download the 2.3 gig one and try this serial. Thanks for the instructions and for the serial. Hope it works.
,allen_x,2008-02-23T08:29Z,thanks for this great game.
,cheeze_wiz_and_crackers,2008-04-11T11:40Z,FUNNNNN
,porradak,2008-07-14T04:25Z,"I make this instalation;

daemon4124-lite.exe already with SPTDinst-v156-x86.exe

Activation All, and mount image

Config video card
Restart the computer
Goto in windows start, run, and in the path browse link to updatemodule in the GTlegends and write

Updatemodule.exe ""GTL.exe"" ""GTLnew.exe""

now you have in directorie of the game two GTL.exe e GTLNEW.EXE
delete original GTL.exe then rename GTLnew.exe to GTL.exe

shut down PC, only cable power off the dvd and cd drives is needed,another solution is´nt possible,
i try with nigthmare but give error.

The antivirus Panda 2008 have no problem on or off and daemon tools with image mounted on

call the game and put the serial number FFMGU-HA34Y-V8ABF-VUN3Y-SCTRP

Wait a moment and all is done
