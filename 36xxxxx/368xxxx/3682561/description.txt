Conspiracy of Silence - Illuminati Pedophiles in Washington D.C. (documentary)

From Senator John Decamp:
In mid-1993, after The Franklin Cover-Up had been circulating for almost a year, 
the British-based TV ... all station, Yorkshire Television, sent a top-notch team 
to Nebraska to launch its own investigation of the Franklin case. Yorkshire had a 
contract with the Discovery Channel to produce a documentary on the case for American 
television.

Finally, the big day came. Their documentary was to air nation-wide on the 
Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994. It was advertised in the TV Guide and in 
newspapers for that day. But no one ever saw that program. At the last minute, 
and without explanation, it was pulled from the air. It was not shown then, and 
has never been broadcast anywhere since.

I have a copy of that program, which arrived anonymously in my mail in 
late 1995. When I watched this pirated copy, I could see clearly why the program 
had been suppressed. Conspiracy of Silence proved, beyond doubt, that the essential 
points I had stressed in the book (and more) were all true.
