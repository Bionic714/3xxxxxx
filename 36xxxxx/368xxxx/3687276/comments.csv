I allready dl the previous 007 movies U made available! Gotta admit this UE collection kicks ass. Much better as the SE collection.

Hope U will finish the series! :)"

,Tiny Turtle ,2007-05-14T14:05Z,"Thanks a lot for these!

The difference in picture quality between these and the previous Special Editions (which are the ones being sold together with the Swedish tabloid Expressen if someone didn't know) is tremendous. Here's a link to a comparison (for Diamonds are forever, but it's the same story for most of the movies in the series): http://www.bulletsnbabesdvd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2316

Of course the SE versions only have good sound on the latest films (which are the ones Expressen began releasing) while the early films come in mono instead of thes which all have a dts track (Thanks for losing the DD track completely, DTSES!)."
,ctctct,2007-05-14T22:05Z,Tack så jättemycket. Men är det bara hos mig som den svenska texten fryser vid drygt 52 minuter? Det funkar på datorn men på min stationära hänger sig texten... de andra filmerna fungerade perfekt! Tack ändå!
,ctctct,2007-05-15T05:27Z,"Thanks a lot! I really appreciate your effort, but is it only me having problems with this disc? Between 52 and 53 minutes the swedish subs freeze. Not on my computer but on my Yamaha... "
