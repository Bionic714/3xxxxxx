,kidroc111,2007-05-06T02:51Z,audio seems not synchronized with the picture well.  -played in vlc/mac ox
,Thoraxone,2007-05-07T06:30Z,"Audio IS NOT synched thru entire movie, but gets better towards the latter parts.

Worst acting EVAR!
Jeff Goldblum really sucks, the publisher dude with the gray beard sucks even more.

I have never heard so many ""Yes, it's true"" in a movie in my life, every character says it at least once (yes, it's true).

Gawd, the shit they try and pawn off as entertainment....

Anyway, thanks for the release.
can ya fix the sync ?"
