,CaboWabo1,2007-12-06T05:43Z,Hey there I just download this program it works fine thks. Just one question IK amplitube is not registered and it is asking for reg code same for the Guitar track pro. Do i really need to register or ican use it without registering? If you have keygen for these program I will greatly appreciate it.
,Bill_Jasper,2008-05-08T02:41Z,"Yes, this program will install and run well, but there are a lot of things missing.  There are no sample files, template files and Cakewalk Application Language (CAL) files.  There are supposed to be approximately 200 of these files in the Cakewalk Pro Audio 9 folder.  Even though this has cost me nothing, I?m starting to wonder what other files are missing from the original CD.

Anyway, thanks for the download as it has allowed me to give it a really good test drive, and I use it so much now I?ve decided to try and find / buy the original CD."
,deadskwerl,2008-05-22T18:20Z,"I've been using Pro Audio on and off for years and I absolutely love it. It's pretty simple to use if you don't know much about that kind of software, and is great for creating music from nothing. I've tried new incarnations of CakeWalk software and couldn't figure them out, so to see this version again is nice. Thanks for the up."
,Lof33,2008-11-28T23:24Z,"This program is old, but it's still my favorite MIDI editing software."
,torrentnoobie,2010-02-19T23:06Z,well i cant get past the stage in the installation where it asks to insert some floppy into the drive...? help me out please? thanks.
