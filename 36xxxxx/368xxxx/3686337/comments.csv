,PirateSmack,2008-01-17T13:44Z,"Thanks DopeMan, another quality rip. 

@ ZeroOwns:
This worked perfect for me. All I had to do was reinstall directx9, which I've had to do with a lot of Dopeman's torrents. See if reinstalling directX9 works, it doesn't matter if you already have it."

,whitewolf227,2008-03-01T04:16Z,"I love ALL dopeman's shit! Downloads fast, works perfect!"
,whitewolf227,2008-03-01T22:21Z,"Weird, all I did was launch Fear.exe and it worked. Weird because dopeman's stuff usually requires some work to get get the game running like following a readme file. I had a little trouble at first but then I launched WMFADist.exe, launched fear.exe, it didn't work because McAfee was blocking fear from the internet. When I did all this I restarted my computer because Fear locked up(Probly because my comp has been on for 5 days). After I restarted I double clicked Fear.exe and it worked perfectly! If you have an object dock you can but Fear.exe in it and the shourtcut will still work, but won't work if you actualy move it out of the folder. Hope this helped somebody."

,nikolaz,2008-05-21T20:10Z,"Great rip!! It works great for me. I unrared it, installed it, and put in the crack, and viola, works great. One thing though, if I put a shortcut on my desktop and click on it, it doesn't work, so I have to go into the folder and start it from there, so I have the folder on my desktop. Someone earlier asked if this games works with vista, it works fine for me. Only real problem I have is with multiplayer as have a few people have the same problem I have. I went to the link that was posted a few pages back to get a valid serial key, which does work by the way, but when I click to join game, it will load everything, and then go back to the select server screen, and invalid game assets pops up. I have no idea how to get past that, so I just play the single player for now. Great game so far!!!!!"

,heavenzmovi3,2008-07-22T03:26Z,"Mr. Dopeman, you are a fucking angel. this is the 4th game i've d/l'ed from you, & it works like a charm.. sadly, this is probably the weakest of the torrents i have from you. D:

the game plays fine; BUT, i'm not sure if its just me, but the menu screen is black; you still have the basic 'Single Player, Options, etc..' but the menu vid is AWOL. just need some verification as to whether or not you decided not to rip the menu vid; if you didn't, its no biggie.

final score for this torrent - 8.5/10. game plays fine, but a few things are missing. either way, a definite D/L. just make sure your PC can handle it ;]"
,knok44,2008-07-28T17:08Z,"that would be because he ripped it... that is why i dont really download from dopeman. i like the full game experience, sorry."

And for those of you who say that no instal is better, then stfu. No install means:

1. Can't keep up with it.

2. At least 15 mintues of loading the game up.

3. have to go through a long ass process.

Crappy rip DO NOT DOWNLOAD"

You have no clue what you are talking about, and with that said...
I am sorry you feel that way my freind, a no-instal/direct play version is the best way to go sometimes,who wants to sit there all damn day and wit for an instal to take place when you could just play after extract,? and I feel bad for you having 15 min loads and stuff, maybe your PC just sucks, because it took no longer than 2 mins to load every level for me, and the music, you are not missing out on anything beleive me...

 This is What I DID--

1.Installed the Fear folder in D:\F.E.A.R.\
2.ran registry file.
3.ran WMFADist.
4.Disabled my antivirus.( I Have F-Secure)

Now the game runs smoothly.. Just one thing.....the levels take a little time to load.
But a gr8 fucking game!!!!!

And Thnx Dopeman! Had 5 of ur gr8 games now.
Keep up the fine work :-))))"
