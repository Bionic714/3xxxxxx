COINTELPRO: The FBI's War on Black America

Through a secret program called the Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO), 
there was a concerted effort to subvert the will of the  ... all ┬╗ people to avoid 
the rise "of a black Messiah" that would mobilize the African-American community 
into a meaningful political force. This documentary establishes historical 
perspective on the measures initiated by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI which aimed 
to discredit black political figures and forces of the late 1960's and early 1970's. 
Combining declassified documents, interviews, rare footage and exhaustive research, 
it investigates the government's role in the assassinations of Malcolm X, 
Fred Hampton, and Martin Luther King Jr. Were the murders the result of this 
concerted effort to avoid "a black Messiah"
