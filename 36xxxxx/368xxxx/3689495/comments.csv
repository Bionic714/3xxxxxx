I've viewed HDTV China's releases before so I don't think they are MPAA fakes, but every tool I've used says there is no MPEG2 Stream like an MPAA fake.  I've tried 2k, XP, OSX, media player classic, vlc, wmp11+sdk, video Redo, NOTHING plays any video.  The link for codec downloads fails to complete.  
IF the codec works, please include it in the torrent.  Thanks."

,Gmork_Tulle,2007-07-12T11:39Z,"I finally found a player that will play these files!

Zoomplayer WMV Professional 5.00

It's downloadeable at http://www.inmatrix.com/files/zoomplayer_download.shtml#WMV

It takes a lot of computing power, but it plays.

My Pentium D @ 3,15 GHz can only render approximately 16 FPS."
