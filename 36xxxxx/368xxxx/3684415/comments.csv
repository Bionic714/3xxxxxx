Thanks for ""Bend it like beckham"". The file fucks up about 40 minutes from start. Goes crazy for about four minutes and after that, picture and sound is out of sync for the rest of the film.

Greetings, Rix800"

We swedish dont put in subs in the movie cause we dont understand the language!
its because some ppl has hearing problems and how fun is it to watch a movie and unable to hear what they say!!!
