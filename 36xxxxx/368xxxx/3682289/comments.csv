,lennier1,2007-05-06T21:33Z,Forgot to mention that the Miniseries only have english subtitles.
,play4you,2007-05-21T06:45Z,"To my knowledge this one is badly corrupted.
I wont share it with anyone... until I have found out why it only plays for 5min and then the picture stops... its almost like its not enough memory... but thats not the case. its the file that halts. So I advise to drop this download until we know how to play these files without closing the player and start the episodes over and over..."
,teamjet,2007-05-30T23:08Z,Thank you for putting this together. Since the first and second seasons are out on DVDs proper is that what you have included? It is only third season that is not yet on DVDs.
,lennier1,2007-06-02T23:43Z,After made an ISO file I always try to run a  some minutes at the end of each episode (using Daemon Tools and Nero 2 Showtime) to make sure audio and text are in synch. Then I burn it on a DVD-R and watch it on my home entertainment system (Pioneer DVR-5100H). Everyone runs perfectly.                                                                                                                                                          
,lennier1,2007-06-02T23:44Z,"Every DVD contains downloaded AVI-files converted to MPEG-2 and DD 2.0 by TMPGEnc 4.0 XPress. So, no original DVD releases for season 1 and 2."
