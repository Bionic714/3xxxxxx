,brandonjbarnhill,2008-03-14T01:02Z,"Hello. I am not very experienced with .rar files that are split up like this, so I am hoping someone will be able to help me out... When I try to open the PowerDirector.msi file it says that it cannot be run by directly launching the MSI package and that I must run Setup.exe, but when I try to run the setup it tells me that there is an error running the setup initialization process. I don't understand. Am I doing the right thing, and it's just not working for me, or do I need to something else? Can anyone give me the steps I need to take in order to get program set up? Thanks for the torrent and thanks for the help!
