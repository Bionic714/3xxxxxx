,BadBanaan,2007-05-14T15:35Z,are the files splitted or is it one long mp3?
,MadMat666,2007-05-17T01:39Z,"of course and in addition all files are fingerfucked! mate, what kind of dumb question is that?! is it so hard to dl the torrent and check it in your client? or maybe reading nfo's is beyond your capabilities?!?! and there is even a third option, how about checking the file list on the page? maaaaan if you're not pretending you're probably one of the stupidest people I've recently seen. 
cheers, bye bye xoxo and farewell"
