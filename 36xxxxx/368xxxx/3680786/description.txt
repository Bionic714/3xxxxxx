Story:       Tortuga.Two.Treasures 

Set in the Caribbean of the early 18th century, "Tortuga - Two Treasures" is an action 
adventure brimming with Caribbean myth, legendary treasures and fearsome pirates.
Renowned writers Wolfgang Walk, Mark L. Barrett and Bob Bates tell the tale of 
Thomas "Hawk" Blythe and his powerful adversary, Edward Teach, better known as 
the dreaded Blackbeard. It is as much a pirate tale as ever there was, and this is one
 to make the blood boil with love and honor, conspiracy and theft, violence and murder.
Each of the many missions poses a fresh challenge for the hero "Hawk". At land or at 
sea there are new skills to master, as well as special items to collect and use with
 cunning in order to defeat your enemies and build your reputation as a freebooter.
Set your sails and stand ready for challenging and exhilarating action in the Caribbean.
