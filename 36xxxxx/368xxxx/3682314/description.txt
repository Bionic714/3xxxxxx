Without doubt this is one of the best compilations ever released. World Beats & Chillout seamlessly mixed together & surpases Claude Challe & Buddha Bar. This album takes Cafe Del Mar one step furthur & blows it away. The sequencing of the tracks is perfect & is where many other just good compilations fall down. The artist selection is superb from the well known to obscure. Salf Keita's "Nyanyama" Bebel Gilberto's "Samba De Bancao" & Djam & Fam's "She left Home" are personal favourites. I can not recommend this album too highly.If you are really into your music & want to discover something great then buy this.
