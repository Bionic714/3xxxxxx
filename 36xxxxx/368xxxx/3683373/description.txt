Yep, your friendly neighborhood GhrayFahx is back. I've returned with the latest build of XBMC along with the latest of the BlackBolt family of skins. As always LinksBoks is included in this release but unfortunately only works in PM3. Some of you crazy skin coder guys may be able to put support for others in, but all the files I had from my old builds are n ow outdated. I'm hoping I can get some of the skins' coders to make some mods for support as it appears that LinksBoks may become a permenant part of XBMC's main SVN soon. Also, I'm not including a changelog in this release as it's been SOOOO long since I've made a release. Well, without further ado, I hope you enjoy this one.
