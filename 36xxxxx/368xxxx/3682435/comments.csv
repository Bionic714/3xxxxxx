,otellocska,2007-05-07T02:02Z,Are on this film subtitles?
,oswald1234,2007-05-08T09:06Z,You want subtitles?Dude half this shit dont work at all...period.Be helpful  ....did it work at all?What player did you use?What codecs?YOU even got chinese audio?
[T],HDTV CHINA,2007-05-08T15:36Z,"oswald1234: If you dont know how DIY your player, just download MPEG2 and H264 codecs movies what i posted. VC-1 video and DD+ audio not easy for you."
,oswald1234,2007-05-09T07:33Z,"Thank you,, Never even thought the VC-1 were different from the rest. So everyone who is  dumb, like me should stick to the H264 and MPEG2 uploads. The VC-1 uploads require some skill and research. That just saved me a lot of frustration."
,AVandelay,2007-05-09T13:36Z,This link you have provided is in chinese. Do you have som english sites where we can download what we need to watch these HD movies. I have tried a lot now! but I have only managed to get sound.
,oswald1234,2007-05-12T11:59Z,"75 gigs is a noob, Thats a drop in the bucket compared to the last 6 months of misery IVe gone through on these files.AVI files that wont join right,limited  support(in chinese),soundtracks in chinese that cant be changed,,if they even play at all. Im a noob too. I have a family to care for and not a world of time.YOU tell me how to play  this shit, Input  please."
,oswald1234,2007-05-16T03:50Z,"Thanks a lot, works now. Something didnt work on that microsoft VC-1 codec alone, but it worked after I installed the complete media player 11,and the stuff you said.Thanks. HDTV CHINA is so awesome."

,emiliotuur,2007-12-23T21:52Z,"thanx whoever seeded this. its complete now, i'll keep seeding for a while"
,emiliotuur,2008-03-22T12:28Z,"@everyone

I'm playing this with Media Player Classic, combined with the latest FFD Show decoder, which enables the use of multicore CPU's. 

This means enough hardware acceleration from the CPU's, and the video codec's in FFD Show can play the VC-1 format."
