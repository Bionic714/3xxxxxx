A tip for Leechers stuck at 99,6%
Her's what i did. 
Open VIDEO_TS folder of this torrent from DVDfab 6/7 and select main movie as output and dvd 9 sice output (so no remuxing will occure. You can select dvd 5 otput but will have som reduction in quality)
Deselect audio languages + subs you dont need.
After copying main movie, You will now have a new VIDEO_TS folder 4,36GB so it won't fit on dvd-5 singel layer.
(you can also use dvdshrink for the job since its freeware)
NEXT download VideoReDo TVSuite (free trail) http://www.videoredo.net/msgBoard/showthread.php?t=17563
And do a quickStreamfix (tools) on those vobs
Output will bee 5 fixed audio sync mpeg2 files, which you can drag into Imgburn (select udf 2,50 format) for burning to dvd-5 (99% usage)
Then it plays fine with youre dvd player, with no quality recoding loss."
