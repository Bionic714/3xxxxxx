,Mauser23,2007-05-07T12:27Z,sure the next disk will be dvd9 then
,raider56,2007-05-07T16:23Z,No thanks! I prefer dvd5 for so many reasons. And I have a really big screen already. But thank you for your work so far Mauser23!
,qassa,2007-05-08T01:08Z,"raider56, everyone knows how to use shrink ,dvdfab and so on. dvd9 is always better."
,GaNjaMaaN,2007-05-08T04:19Z,"Thanks!!

But please no dvd9."
,raider56,2007-05-08T11:00Z,"@ gassa. Yes I know how to shrink DVDs. But my hard disk drive is constantly full and to dl DVD9 and then shrink it will take more space than I have. It will take a lot longer time to dl it. Peers don't seed big torrents as long as small ones. It will take for ever to reach my usual ratio of 5:1. And the best reason is: This is a low budget sci-fi with plastic ears and crappy special effects - not Spider-Man 3.

Off topic - am I the only one how can't find my inbox on TPB anymore?"
,Mauser23,2007-05-09T16:52Z,i can see there is more ppl there want dvd5 so it will be
,kenny999,2007-05-09T21:34Z,"Thank you mauser23.
I also vote DVD5."
,kenny999,2007-05-13T13:58Z,There's no menu; is it possible to rip again with menu please?
,pilobash,2007-05-16T00:58Z,"No Fucking Menu
There r 4 episodes on this dvd, so the menu is needed for selecting episodes
if you'r continue ripping whitout menu's 
don't bother"
,cow_man,2007-05-27T05:21Z,"No menus = can only view first episode on many DVD players idiot. Thanks for wasting my time, bandwidth, and DVDs."
,V4Friend,2008-02-01T08:48Z,"Do not download this one, if you want to play it in your DVD-player: the menus are missing :("
,V4Friend,2008-02-01T08:51Z,"Try this one instead: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3343486/Star_Trek_-_DS9_S2D4
I know it's a bit low on seeders now, but perhaps others can help with that?"
,Dendrite,2008-05-25T20:50Z,Thanks for the great uploads Mauser23. Could you re-rip Disk4 with the Menu and share it with us?
