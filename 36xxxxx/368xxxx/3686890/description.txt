  4.5 / 5 (based on 1 rating).

Plot:	A non-caring man, Shen Chang, only cares for a woman he works with and will do anything to protect her. Shen is a modern version of Chang's vision of the dutiful yet lone swordsman who travels the countryside waiting to die in selfless honor.

Overview:	Legendary "heroic brother" movie Chang Cheh teams up the quintessential fight director Liu Chia-Liang (Lau Kar Leung) to bring their brand of artistic yet violent nihilism to contemporary Hong Kong in "The Delinquent". It's about non-caring man Shen Chang that only cares for a woman he works with and what he'll do to protect her.

Shen is merely a modern version of Chang's vision of the dutiful yet lone swordsman who travels the countryside waiting to die in selfless honor.
