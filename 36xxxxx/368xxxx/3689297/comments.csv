,redarmy100,2007-09-13T11:10Z,"Spoken language IS in English. Sort of. It's just that someone's decided to 'shadow' it with a foreign translation, which is just SLIGHTLY annoying. It's also in WMV format, but that's not important, since the overdubbing in an unidentified language makes the format a moot point. Unless you want to take a chance on the translation beng in your language: avoid!!"
