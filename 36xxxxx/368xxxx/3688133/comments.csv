,eaglenest608,2009-04-22T04:57Z,Anybody seeding this thing??  Getting all 000000's across the board.  Why keep this on here if you are not going to be on to seed??
,Tuddley3,2010-10-03T05:44Z,"I don't know if it is true, but even if there is no ""Virus"" in a file you download, your Anti-Virus program will pick up the Crack as a Trojan, because a crack basically is a Trojan (just a safe one). It's the fake ones with weird file sizes that actually don't have any relation to the program you are downloading for that are dangerous. Maybe I'm wrong ?"
,NoVARealtorBrian,2010-11-09T04:25Z,Does anyone have a serial for VINTAGE AIRCRAFT ?  Thanks !
