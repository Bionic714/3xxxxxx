,420dopeman,2007-05-06T21:30Z,"You can place the actual game folder anywhere.
Leave the rar so you can seed.

The location just has to be a registry friendly one. I cant have any 'odd' symblos in the location.
Just put it in your programs folder, or start a new game folder for all your games  as I do, like c:/gaming
then you can just put all ya games in there.
cheers mate."
,420dopeman,2007-05-06T22:16Z,"Sounds of a system problem mate.
Maybe try re-install DirectX and check to be sure your sys. can run the game by specs.
Game is a few yrs. old, but i dont know the sys. you're running.
Best I can offer mate. g/l

,hostghost,2007-05-25T03:25Z,"Great work dopeman! Thank you for keeping to upload great games.

I have one issue with this release though. Everything in the game seems to be running at double speed. The menu, the movies, and I can't get to the race since it crashes with a buffer owerflow when I start. I have played this game before so i know what speed things should be. Anyone have any idea what might couse this?"
,vaitti,2007-05-27T19:28Z,"RIGHT, SO ya tried to start the game without reading the nfo??
And it crashed, hmmmmm. Must be dopemans fault.

i always read the manual AFTER something goes wrong."
,LordCommander,2007-06-12T18:38Z,"Im experiencing big difficulties with sounds in games uploaded by you, 420dopeman. What what do I need to do/install? I can hear the sounds partially, but they are really fucked up.
I have Sound Blaster Live! and windows XP.

Do you use some ""special way"" to rip or are the sounds just simply that fucked up in da rips?"
,VicoN,2007-06-18T12:47Z,"I encountered some problems... the game installed fine, and starts up without any problems, but when i select race, and it starts to load this error occours ""The game encountered a problem, please press esc to quit"" This errors is from the game itself and is not a crash error or anything"

What happens is that when the game is just about to start (loaded map and everything), it says ""We have detected a problem with this install. Please press ESCAPE"" to quit the game"".

And I know there's nothing wrong with anything that consider Direct X, or any hardware configs. Got em all. 

Thank you very much anyway!
Thank u for BF Vietnam playing it every day:D"

,Sting6584,2007-11-26T13:50Z,"Found a solution to above problem on a forum.
Heres the copy/paste : 

""""Problem: When loading the game it halts on a blank screen with a Protection Error

Solution: This is caused by the latest version of Nero and some of the codecs this installs on your system.

You should be able to workaround this problem by modifying your CMR 2005 shortcut as follows:

1) Edit your Colin McRae Rally 2005 Windows shortcut (found on the desktop and/or the start menu) by right clicking on it and selecting properties.
2) In the target box, add NOVIDEO after the target entry, so the target looks like this

""C:\Program Files\Codemasters\Colin McRae Rally 2005\CMR5.exe"" NOVIDEO

3) Click on OK or Apply and now try running the game again"""""

,soofresh,2009-09-09T02:47Z,"OK. I've done this plenty of times and none has been as simply frustrating as this.

Download file, Unzip to folder.

Run Regsetup, change the folder location to where I unzipped it. Example: C:\Program Files

Finish installation and it crashes.

This isn't completely clear. Do you need to install it into the folder where you unzipped it, or install it into the folder Collin Mcrae Rally 2005?

I've tried both, and neither work. My PC is definately good enough to run this."
