,BloodLogic,2008-01-26T18:15Z,"If you're having problems playing these files, please, use VLC Player.  Download it completely free at videolan.org .  It can play absolutely any type of media.  For video, it can play flawlessly any mpeg, avi, wmv, flv, mov, etc., etc., and for audio, it can play mp3, mp2, flac, mp4, etc..  Also, may as well grab PeerGuardian 2, which will prevent your computer from connecting or sharing files with any anti-piracy group, educational institutions, spammers, etc..  Get it at: http://phoenixlabs.org/.  Also, don't forget to check out my many other torrents.  Thanks!

,BloodLogic,2008-01-26T18:22Z,"To manieri: I double-checked the files a few weeks ago.  Compared the hash of the torrent to the files I had, to make sure they were the right ones, and then I watched seasons 1-2.  No audio glitches whatsoever.  It's a perfect dvdrip, with absolutely all of the original data (flawless audio, video, and all commentary tracks and extras).  I suggest you get VLC Player for these files, or any type of ""acquired media.""  Thanks, and enjoy. =)"

,bmann25,2008-12-21T06:04Z,Nero will not let me open when I try to burn!  Besides a new program to burn any body got any suggestions?
,BloodLogic,2009-04-22T18:35Z,"@ bmann25:

When you say ""burn,"" do you mean burning to Video-DVD, or Data-DVD? Nero's really *only* good at burning data-DVDs, if anything. I've uploaded an entire torrent titled, ""How to Burn Any Video to DVD,"" if *THAT* is what you're trying. Enjoy!

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2010-07-05T13:54Z,"such a great show & torrent-completely ruined by the voice overs,can these be removed at all? cos there are only 1 of each ep so voice overs spoil them as you only get the choice to watch with them,soooo annoying that producers do that."
,KGN-004,2011-06-11T18:23Z,Hachi machi! Great torrent. :)
