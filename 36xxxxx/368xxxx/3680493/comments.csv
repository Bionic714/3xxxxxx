,vamperial,2009-06-16T23:02Z,So are these for a game or are they the songs that you can just listen to with your iTunes?
[T],InternetNinjacy,2010-02-21T04:23Z,"Well they appear to be for stepmania, and they have a bunch of extra files in there for that game. However, this torrent does contain the MP3's for the songs so you can add them into iTunes and just regular listen to them.

I actually put forth the effort to only download the songs, but you don't have to. iTunes will only add the songs anyway.

By the way, nice torrent. +"
