,xkexkexke,2008-02-22T15:08Z,"Very nice movie with the superstar in martial arts Jackie Chan. In this 
movie he impersonates a modern ""Prince Charming"", a big business mogul 
and notoriously eligible big-city bachelor to dreamy teenager Shu Qi, 
who is a girl from a Taiwan. When a heartbreaking message in a bottle 
washes ashore, she traces it back to Hong Kong, where she meets Jackie 
in the midst of a mid-ocean brawl on a luxury yacht. Hong Kong 
heartthrob Tony Leung has a grand time spoofing his image, playing a 
gay fashion photographer who ""adopts"" Shu Qi and helps her woo her 
handsome dream lover. It's a pleasant change to see 40-plus Jackie 
discard his usual goofy lovesick fool to play a suave swinger, but next 
to giggly teen Shu Qi, who proves to be a spunky and winning actress, 
he seems a little too mature. There are still plenty of opportunities 
to see Jackie in acrobatic action with a subplot involving a boyhood 
friend turned shady business

,Master2873,2011-11-14T14:33Z,It seems to have pretty nice Quality. But the only complaint I have is the Codecs you decided to use... The way you encoded it made it incompatible to be played/streamed through my Xbox 360. I would say stick to MPEG-4 for video and MP3 for audio. Just my opinion lol. But thanks for this I've been looking for this and been wanting to watch this for years.
