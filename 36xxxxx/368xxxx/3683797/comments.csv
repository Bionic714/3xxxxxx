,tenden91,2007-05-12T19:55Z,does it works????
,MadhurDamn,2007-05-29T01:49Z,It's missing a file that it needs to install...  :(
,jimmyleg,2007-10-06T21:39Z,"It works. 
You need to mount or burn the iso image, then install from there. After install, replace the exe file with the one provided."
,jakham3r,2007-10-12T00:06Z,I mounted it to Daemon but it didnt install.  The loading please wait box flashed on the screen and then nothing happened.  Any ideas?
,jakham3r,2007-10-12T00:53Z,"Never mind, I got it, stupid me i was clicking on the wrong file!  ;)"

,criffa,2007-12-09T19:38Z,i can install the game but when i am going to start it it ask for the correkt cd??? what should i do?
,syrin,2007-12-12T22:22Z,"To get it to work, mount it using a program, such as Daemon, then install it from the mounted disk. Copy the .exe from the Lego Star Wars NO CD CRACK folder, then paste it into the folder you installed Lego Star Wars in. Then run the .exe you pasted and voila.

No offense, but if you cannot get this to work, then I think you need to buy a legal copy until you can learn how a computer works :P"
,skullC4ndy,2008-01-12T22:48Z,omg COM on dont download if u dont now how to install the fucking game *.* 
,markxing,2008-01-13T07:07Z,"Uhm, theres no audio in the cutscenes."
,hazeo,2008-03-24T08:55Z,"OBS OBS
VIRUS in the exe file.
Det är virus, jäkla amatörer som inte har virusprogram............"

,dark_justice1986,2008-04-16T02:18Z,audio is messed up during cutscenes.. I am going to uninstall and start over once more to see if I can fix it.
,dark_justice1986,2008-04-16T02:49Z,well the game is very playable and the gameplay is all there and intact. The only thing wrong is the sound is glitchy. I did everything right. I am not new at using daemon tools and installing with the crack.
,Drunkmonkey_13,2008-04-16T17:38Z,thanks alot man great game :P
,farmor2k,2008-05-07T05:04Z,"Hey guys, head over to gamecopyworld.com and you will find a patched exe by some guy called Reloaded... it should fix the sound problem. It fixed the sound problem for me atleast. But first try updating your sound drivers."

,tuttefia13,2010-04-28T12:30Z,"This game works, but the there's something wrong with the sound. I think the talking sound is removed."
,chris[mufc]150,2010-07-13T14:31Z,"My antivirus warns me about something in this file even though its still downloading (25 %). I hope its just the crack that is being recognized as a virus, because many people commented that this game works!n"
,chris[mufc]150,2010-07-13T16:27Z,"Guys I install the game, I copy the crack and then I start it, but when it goes to the \""Once upon a time......\"" it stays there and theres nothing I can do. Any solution for this problem????"

,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-27T09:40Z,You also need a Gfx card which supports Pixel Shader 1.1 and the software fix for it doesn't work on my box... so lots of time wasted regardless. YOU NEED A HOT VIDEO CARD OR FORGET IT!
