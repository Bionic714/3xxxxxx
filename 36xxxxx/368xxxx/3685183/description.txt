I ponied up the cash for this one; I hope you enjoy this cult favorite 
of mine.

This is the blurb from the DVD jacket --

William L. Peterson (Manhunter, CSI) and Willem Dafoe (Spider-man) face off in a deadly game of Cat and Mouse in this "Riveting" (The New York Times) Action-Thriller from the Oscar-winning director of The French Connection. "Full of Flash, Style and Grit" (Boxoffice), this raw tale of corruption and revenge features one of the most harrowing car chases ever caught on film and a shockingly explosive ending. Federal agent Richard Chance (Peterson) has to settle a score, and he's through playing by the rules. Whether that means blackmailing a beautiful parolee, disobeying direct orders or hurtling the wrong way down a crowded freeway, he vows to take down a murderous counterfeiter (Dafoe) by any means necessary. But as the stakes grow higher, will Chance's obsession with vengeance ultimately destroy him?
