This looks like an amazing compilation.  I see old favs, new ones and bands I've always meant to check out, but never did.

Can't wait to check it all out.
Thanks heaps."
,El_Napalmo,2008-02-09T21:46Z,Hi. Is this the real thing? 'cause I've just downloaded volume II and it seemed to be a collection of the tracks from the original source and not the real compilation boxset. Did you ripped it from the boxset?
