
This is George A. Romeo's 2. cult classic zombie movie, its cuite good actually.

i was spooked from time to time.

it's actually not that familier with dawn of the dead from 2004, exept they are in a mall. U must see this movie. I think it is better than the one from 2004, this is the classic zombies, they can only walk. yiihaa..

enjoy it. :) i did.

Cheers
