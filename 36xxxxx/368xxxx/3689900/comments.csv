,Christley,2007-06-11T19:46Z,how can it be i virus when it only has the setup file from their homepage and 2 .txt docs?
,bigoof,2007-07-21T03:29Z,Zone alarm 7 also has anti-virus options but they can be disabled if you already have an anit-virus program you prefer.  The spam filter for outlook express is great.  Nice release Christley.

,UchihaGX,2007-10-14T08:33Z,"Yo, I got a question about this program.
Can this program remove virus? I mean like trojans and more.
If it only can remove spywere, then it sucks a little bit."

,aeonret,2007-10-24T03:50Z,"I too can confirm that this is NOT a virus. =p
Great firewall, and includes spyware-scanning. Good torrent!"
,aeonret,2007-10-24T03:53Z,"@ UchihaGX
Zonealarm is a firewall program, which means it protects your computer from incoming viruses etc.
I'm not sure about the virus-scanning abilities of ZoneAlarm, but it's an awesome firewall. For a good virus-scanning program, look for AVG Anti-Virus."
,Luis622,2007-10-27T01:43Z,This shit sucks!! STAY AWAY it fucks up ur internet connection. fucking cunt.

,dark_justice1986,2008-06-20T05:22Z,"This is a good program and it blocked so many harmful things, BUT it can indeed actually mess up your internet and slow it down significantly if you do not know what you are doing. Don't use if you can't figure it out."
,Bissen303,2010-02-11T01:46Z,"jonnythaman : Those license numbers Does NOT work ! not even one of them. So stop posting them on every zone alarm torrent please ! Im getting confused, Dude ! And it´s much as it is when you have smoked several mad bong´s with CRAZY Ganja !! Peace !"
