,trrrr,2008-08-24T00:14Z,This is a great anime. Its based on the manga by the guy that created Love Hina.(4got his name) these vids r in hight quality. dual audio too. with subtitles in English(if u wish to activate then). we just need more seeds. it's easier to download from a torrent then from from the fansubber's IRC channel.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4372437/%5BExiled-Destiny%5D_Negima

... well i downloaded that and it was seeded OK and good quality"
,kinggrim,2009-06-26T03:01Z,"For those who haven't figured it out from the other posts, works perfectly, high quality.

As for the torrent contents...
For those who want to watch this, I advise you to read the manga (www.onemanga.com for online, www.mangatraders.com for downloadable). The anime does not do the manga any justice. It isn't that bad... (except the end, where they mesh about 4-5 volumes worth of material into 4 episodes...) For those that still want to watch this, read the manga after."
