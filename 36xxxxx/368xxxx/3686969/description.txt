The Big Chill is a 1983 soundtrack album of Motown classics featured in the film The Big Chill. The first ten of its fourteen tracks are to be heard in the film, and the remainder of the film's songs (aside from the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want") was released in 1984 on The Big Chill: More Songs from the Original Soundtrack.

In 1998, both albums were re-mastered, the first without the four additional songs, which had also appeared on More Songs and were left there. In 2004, Hip-O Records released a Deluxe edition, containing not only sixteen of the eighteen songs from the film ("Quicksilver Girl," by The Steve Miller Band, was curiously unavailable), but three additional film instrumentals. A second "music of a generation" disc of nineteen additional tracks was included as well, some of which had appeared both on the original soundtrack and the More Songs release.
