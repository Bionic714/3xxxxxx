,piratekio,2008-03-16T22:46Z,"This is only a 5 minute teaser of the documentary, why?"
,karbunkle,2008-07-05T05:20Z,"Just in case anyone's concerned. When you load the clip up, it only shows it as 5:13 minutes long, but it is the entire hour long episode. The timer also stopped at the 18+ minute mark but it played on through with no troubles. I have no idea why it's doing this. anyways, i'll seed it for a couple three days for whoever wants it. "
