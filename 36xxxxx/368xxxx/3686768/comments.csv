,martinkiri,2007-10-28T19:24Z,do maps work on s60v3?
,RonsonDk,2008-03-22T02:44Z,"HOW TO ACTIVATE:
You need TT6_kg_All.zip keygen + .mid file from the map (one .mid file per map)

To get the .mid file:
Mount/instert CD with maps - TomTom has to detect the cd/maps
Install a map to your device
Copy it back to your computer, then you get a .zip file
Extract the .zip file, you get your .mid file!
Now use the keygen with the .mid: test4 map.mid

Activate and enjoy!

Sadly, you can't extract the map.cab file, it has to be copied from cd->device and device->pc

You have to choose the right activation key. My maps were for a PNA (One/Go), but installed on on a smartphone, so I chose ""Pocket"" - works great!"
,ukefc01,2008-04-09T16:01Z,"Hi. I've downloaded the ISO file and mounted the image. I can see all the map files. I have copied and pasted the maps I want to the TomTom and then copied them back to the PC but the files are exactly the same as those in the mount. They show as Winzip files but when I unzip them the files in the zip all have an extension of .001, .002, .003 etc. There is no .mid file. What do I need to do?"
,Smurf1969,2008-08-05T14:55Z,"Just read the description!
You MUST use TOMTOM HOME (not v2!!!) to install the maps! :-)"
,stokie21,2008-08-16T19:42Z,"I am stuck here, i have a tomtom one. I put the disc in the comp and plug my sat nav in, then tomtom home starts i click on a map, lets say france, then click on install and a window pops up saying enter a product code, anyone know how to work this one out?"
