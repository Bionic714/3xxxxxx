,shaqi,2007-07-22T11:07Z,Its the best virus program ever made......absolut top of the line.
,Ragheadkiller06,2007-08-17T14:44Z,"I have always liked the corporate versions of symantec and Mcafee's antivirus software, because of a couple of things, it was top of the line, meaning no bull shitting around with a pretty gui, just kick ass anti virus. 

When it finds a virus, it automarically deletes it, no questions asked. Whereas 'norton' would turn red, pop-up, tell me something was wrong, then *ask* me if i wanted to delete the virus. WELL OF COURSE I DO ITS A FUCKING VIRUS

another thing i like is the small footprint it leaves, unlike the fat memory hog norton or the end user version of mcafee.

but wat is with the file size for this, its 600 megs!"

It' has a great feature that it places the .msi files for the clients in a shared folder on the server - and from there you're able to feed it to all connecting clients via Group Policies. Now, never again care about a client installation as it inherits every setting and updates from the server ;-)"

,enlightend,2008-03-27T15:32Z,"Ragheadkiller06, before Symantec came along, this actually was Norton Antivirus Corp, which has always been kickass. No matter what names they put on the product, SAV is actual NAV and will always be Norton's fantastic piece of software engineering."
,Pirumyan,2008-09-17T12:15Z,"I just started to download this, hope it works ok, i have used the older versions of norton and am very happy with it. But really why is the file size so fucking big?"
,Pirumyan,2009-01-17T14:51Z,"I have been using this for over a month now, works just fine. thanks so much seeders and uploader."
