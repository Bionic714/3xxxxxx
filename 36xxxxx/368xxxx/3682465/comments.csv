Do you not understand what is happening?

According to this TPB page as of now, there are 14 seeders and 529 completed downloads.

Neither of those has happened.

See the URL at Userland.

I'm at a 7.5 share now, feeding only the legitimate peers."

It's an organization such as RIAA/MPAA behind this, having a company like MediaSentry performing the dirty work.

Don't blame Americans in general - I'm at a 10.72 share, uploading 2.8 Gb to get this 430 Mb torrent so far, to try and overcome the poisoners.

Unfortunately, I think the seed gave up."

Thanks :D"
,Interpolice,2007-08-26T01:00Z,"This is a dead torrent, and there's no one home at TPB as far as complaining that this should be removed from their top torrents list.

The ""Downloaded"" count is faked out by the poisoners. They report completions that didn't happen."
