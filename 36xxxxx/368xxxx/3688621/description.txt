Plot Synopsis from AMG

Marilyn Jordan (Susan Anspach), an American-born housewife, mother, and socialite living in Sweden, is crumbling under the weight of her own existence. She deeply resents her husband Martin\\\'s (Erland Josephson) frequent holiday absences and his indifferent attitude toward their two children (\\\"If they are going to grow up in today\\\'s world,\\\" he admits, \\\"it\\\'s about time they faced the fact that nobody keeps promises anymore\\\"). Moreover, Marilyn\\\'s eccentric father (who believes he is Buffalo Bill and fires off guns in the house to prove it) and her children -- who hatch an outrageous plan to set up a dating service for senior citizens -- start to drive her completely around the bend. Marilyn feels herself domestically imprisoned -- encased in a bell jar. Her subsequent behavior grows not simply eccentric, but irrational and then comically outrageous. She cooks wiener schnitzel for the entire family, but eats it all herself; unsuccessfully attempts to poison the family beagle; and -- convinced that insects are attacking her during the night -- showers the plant above her bed with bug repellent, much to Martin\\\'s consternation. Finally, irritated by Martin\\\'s sexual indifference to her, Marilyn manages to get his attention in a last, desperate move by setting his bed on fire late one night. Deeply concerned, Martin consults psychologist Dr. Pazardjian (Per Oscarsson), who does little to help Marilyn and (indeed) turns out to be even nuttier than any of the members of the Jordan family. Via a comic security mix-up, Marilyn later becomes stranded at the Stockholm airport and hitches a ride with a band of horny Yugoslavian immigrants celebrating the new year; they take her to their ZanziBar nightclub for a couple of days, where she begins to break out of her domestic prison by engaging in a torrid extramarital affair with randy Slavic zookeeper Montenegro and by performing as a one-time chaunteuse on-stage. Eventually, Marilyn\\\'s family beckons for her to return -- but her brush with independence has made her a very different woman, indeed. Montenegro marked controversial writer/director Dusan Makavejev\\\'s English-language debut, and earned widespread critical raves for Anspach\\\'s career-defining performance.

Review from AMG 

Dusan Makavejev\\\'s wickedly funny, jet-black treatise on domestic psychosis looks better with each passing year. Written and directed amid the filmmaker\\\'s slow, decades-long transition from film essay to standard feature, Montenegro retains the fresh comic rhythms, blithe raunchiness, and off-the-wall unpredictability of WR and Sweet Movie yet manages to seamlessly blend those elements into a traditional Western narrative without descending into the journeyman Hollywood morass of the director\\\'s later Coca-Cola Kid. Makavejev is perhaps slyest for playfully suspending his audience between interpretations, and thus treading a razor-thin line -- consistently refusing to definitively interpret housewife Marilyn Jordan\\\'s \\\"journey\\\" as a descent into insanity or a full political and sexual liberation. Although the picture\\\'s message becomes resoundingly clear when one juxtaposes the parabolic prologue (and the symbolism of the Montenegro character-as-zookeeper) with the macabre conclusion, Makavejev gleefully and mischievously toys with the audience in the interim. The director makes oddball choices throughout, packing his frame with idiosyncratic characters (such as the grandfather with Buffalo Bill delusions) and bizarre, occasionally randy situations; none lack payoffs. He also reveals a flair for skillfully melding the absurdly comic with humor so deadpan that it risks initially going unnoticed, and somehow manages to carry one of the most eccentric and unusual sexual acts in a mainstream feature film into the realm of the sublimely erotic.
