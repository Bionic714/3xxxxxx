,Tony73,2007-05-14T23:03Z,I like that BIG thanks!
,brown23,2007-05-15T14:18Z,"Hey Tony, thanks! For some reason this torrent stays in the waiting mode, no other torrents ever do. Including the other three LH ones you have uploaded. Any suggestions? This is the first time this has ever happened & re-doing it does'nt help. "
,TonyManero,2007-05-15T17:33Z,"I don't know why. My upload speed isn't very high, but that shouldn't matter anymore, because there are so many of us seeding the torrent now."
,masunaga,2007-05-18T17:42Z,"great work, thanks a lot!"
,edgarholland,2007-08-06T11:08Z,"Hello Tony, thanks for the upload. Very sad to hear that Lee has passed away, saw him perforn live in Stockholn in 2002 and he was fantastic. Do you have the tv-show Cowboy in Sweden in it's entirety? I've never seen it and I hear that it's a bit of a cult classic even by Lee's standards. All the best."
,TonyManero,2007-08-08T01:21Z,"edgarholland: Just search for Hazlewood in Videos, and you'll find the videos from Cowboy in Sweden. I'd love to hear some details about the 2002 concert! Do you have en e-mail address or something?



Lee Hazlewood 1929-2007"
,edgarholland,2007-08-11T12:04Z,"Hello Tony my address is edmulholland5@hotmail.com. I'll visiting friends for a few days, but send me an email and I'll get in touch"
,Whitewood,2007-09-29T14:14Z,"Hi Tony,

Great fan of Lee. I've a problem with your big torrent. I've  a failure message when i put the file in  bit torrent.
Can you help ?
Thanks"
,Whitewood,2007-09-29T15:02Z,"OK,
I understand my problem. It's the length of some files'names of that kind :
lee_hazlewood_-_these_boots_are_made_for_walkin';_the_complete_mgm_recordings-2cd.txt
Can you do something for that ?

Thanks a lot,"
,TonyManero,2007-10-02T15:29Z,Then I would have to put it up again... Is it just the txt-files you're having problems with?
,Burroughs,2008-01-10T14:56Z,Thank you very much! All your uploads are very special to me!
,villsvinet,2008-03-29T22:31Z,"Hey tony, Norway calling. fuck this is the best torrent i have d.loaded for a while. been listening on Lee since I was 14 years, and at the age of 32 now His records are still standing in the front of my collection. THanks for this, looking forward to listen to some of the live things. Only sad thing is that I never was able to see him live. But his music will live together with me until I die, and my 2 kids are gone sing his songs as well later (I hope). I have allready made up my mind that I gone have one of his songs in my funeral when that time comes around. maybe We All Make The Flowers Grow and one more with some speed. anyhow loved this Tony. Thumbs up"
,gnj1958,2008-08-11T05:18Z,"Little disappointed that over half of the albums are from vinyl and bad sounding vinyl at that. Still I'm glad for the stuff that is from CD. Good job.

Appreciate it."
,pp_11,2011-06-05T20:00Z,"I badly wanted the album: nancy and lee 1968, which i downloaded, but the first few songs have an annoying hiss throughout the whole song which is very audible. I commend you for uploading but just setting people know the quality is poor :("
