Here come's another 22 Lee Hazlewood-albums, 
two of them are with Nancy Sinatra.
I know that some of them are already here...

I will put up the rest of Lee Hazlewoods excellent work,
but not today. Maybe I'll upload some videos too.

Don't miss these three really rare albums, only released in vinyl:
