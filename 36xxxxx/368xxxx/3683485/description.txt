People, please, pay attention to this: I've uploaded this torrent befora, and after the five first downloads, nobody kept seeding. 

I tried to aply this warning, but I couldn't edit the informations I posted, so I erased the post and reuploaded the torrent.

NOW, I ASK YOU, PLEASE!!!!!!!! KEEP SEEDING AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD. I AM A USER JUST LIKE YOU, NOT A SERVER! I CAN'T KEEP ON SEEDING FULL DAY, ALL THE TIME, OK?

Please, the success of BittTorrent comunity deppends on your help. SEED!!!!!! Don't Suck!

Thank You All for paying attention to this.

Enjoy Gotthard!
