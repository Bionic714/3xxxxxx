:.About.:
 
In the fall of 1977, NASA launched Deep Probe Nine into space. 
In hopes of making contact with extraterrestrial life forms, 
scientists crammed the shuttle with cultural mementos, photos, 
and even disco records - the spacecraft was a cosmic calling 
card to unknown alien life. Some years later, in the far reaches 
of our galaxy, Deep Probe Nine was picked up by an alien species 
who took an unearthly liking to the disco records and they just 
couldn't get enough! Their obsession grew so strong that they?ve 
loaded up their fleets and have invaded Earth in search of disco! 
Load up your weapons and stop them before it's too late!
