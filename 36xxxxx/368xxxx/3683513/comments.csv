I notice that you are missing these two episodes:

Episode #11 - A Bicycle Built for Poo / The Young and the Eggless /

Episode #12 - No Guts No Glory Hole / Action Bastard Says: Put Your Hands On My Rod / The Parasites Are Back!

you uploaded episodes 7-10 & 13. Any chance of getting 11 and 12?

Here is a list to keep track of them
