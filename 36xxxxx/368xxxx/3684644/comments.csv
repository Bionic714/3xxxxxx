,korbiekwan,2007-05-11T02:19Z,"fl4me - If you're waiting for an aXXo release you might be waiting for quite a while. Generally aXXo releases are of material just pre-DVD release. 300 won't be out on DVD until near the end of 2007 at the earliest. This release is a decent screener. Picked this up a few months ago when 300 was initially released into theatres. It's the best you are going to see until release groups (like aXXo) release this title a few weeks before the retail DVD is available...or in your eyes, it might be worth the wait!  "
