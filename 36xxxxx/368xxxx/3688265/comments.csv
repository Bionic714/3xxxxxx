,SeattleEse,2008-06-17T23:45Z,"I am seeding only the Dragonlance Files and will continue to do so indefinitely.  

Just a FYI to those downloading those files, some of the pdf's aren't 100% perfect and thus some images and pages are damaged or corrupted.  Maybe re-downloading them may help.  

However, the files for the most part are in good or perfect condition, and virus free.  Happy Downloading !!
