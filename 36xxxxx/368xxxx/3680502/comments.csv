Open up the 'data' folder and right click the 'options.xml' file located here. 
Select the option to 'Open With... Notepad' and scroll down to the line that says ""useWinMM = 0/>"" in the  section. 

Change the 0 to a 1 and then save this document. 
Restart the game and you should not have any more trouble.
