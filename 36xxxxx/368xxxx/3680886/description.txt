Notes:

1) Create a restore point running rstrui and following instructions to Create

2) The ID you're looking for in Step 2, #5 is the hardware ID.  Write it down.  You'll probably need it in Step 7.



To undo the entire procedure:

1) Physically remove your bluetooth transciever
2) Uninstall the WidComm drivers in control panel
3) Uninstall the Bluetooth Enumerator in device manager
4) rename/move bth.inf.old and bth.pnf.old back
5) Restart and put in your transceiver
If this fails, restore to the restore point you made.
