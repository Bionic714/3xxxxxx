There is nothing to extract, just burn the image file (ISO) to a DVD with Nero or some other recording program and play.

PS.
Excuse my bad english."

,XxGLITCHxX,2008-06-20T00:11Z,"Make sure to take the ISO image and extract it, yes EXTRACT! you will need a program called XISO or QWIX! Open the ISO File, Hit the extract button, Locate your self to the Desktop let the files extract from the ISO,

Take thoes files and FTP them to your Softmodded Xbox, This is of coarse you dont feel like burning and have a Bigger Hdd in your Xbox already ;)

thanks titi! that makes another game to my collection thanks to you!

,KingKongFetus,2008-10-09T06:24Z,"So many people have problems worrying about viruses and a hard time burning .iso images. I won't lie, I did too, at first. What would I recommend? 1st: Download ""pc repair kit"" and use it to burn an .iso image of Linux Ubuntu 7.04.You can then use that to  download viruses freely and burn .iso images with ease. ;)"
