,MediaMogul,2007-05-09T14:56Z,"episode listing contains the names of each episodes and the discription includes the descriptions from teh official CBS site. 

each episode is about 350 MB in size."
,MediaMogul,2007-05-09T19:20Z,"due to the size and my limited upload speed I advise that you use bitlord or another Torrent client that lets you set the priorety of individual files. 

this way you can make it so the first 350 MB you download are the complete episode 1 etc andn ot 10 mb in each episode =)"
,MediaMogul,2007-05-14T10:20Z,will continue to seed trough may then ill put the torrent on the back burner ( minimal seed like a few k bit) so you greedy leechers may want to start seedin :)

,nospam2001,2007-05-20T20:47Z,189 peeps stuck at 87.1%.  Someone please seed... and to those fellow leechers... make sure you continue sharing after
,mal9,2007-05-21T07:16Z,"Yeah, 87.1%.

,Cyclone882,2007-09-02T04:53Z,"This torrent is fucked.  Episode 02 and 03 from the torrent are both the same episode(episode 3, from the episode descriptions)."
,cheeky_tony,2007-09-07T11:40Z,"episode 2 and 3 is the same
the playback jumps repeatedly on some of the episodes at vital points of the story...
I give this a 4 out of 10"
,PastorP,2007-10-24T13:14Z,"This is just bullshit. A lot of the episodes are the same :(
That sucks..I was really looking forward to this one.."
,Hei_p책-deg,2007-12-03T17:40Z,"The uploader did a poor job on this one.

Two episodes are the same, and one or two episodes are missing.

this torrent should be deleted."
,MediaMogul,2008-04-22T11:35Z,"Ok owrking on fixing this torrent Anyone able to confirm which episodes are fucked beyond use?

Redoing episode to atm os that it is actually episode 2. 

Which 2 episodes are missing ? and which ones jump at key points in the story ?"
,unnie,2008-07-05T10:34Z,Leeching at the moment - but will seed 3 weeks with at least 10Mbit/s. Thanks for this btw :)
,shatterdfayt,2008-07-14T00:25Z,"im leeching too, will seed for 3 weeks with 10 meg too:P"
,sep696969,2008-07-19T12:07Z,"episodes 3, 10, 11, 13 all get around 50% through then stop.

don't know about the other episodes as i stopped downloading after this many stuff-ups.

very shat that i wasted my bandwidth on this.  thanx for your efforts uploader, but maybe TEST what you upload from here?"
,equazcion,2008-08-04T14:46Z,"Episodes 2 and 3 aren't just the same -- they're also the wrong episode. It's an episode from a later season. 

A much better torrent of Season 2 is at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3880709/The_Unit_Season2_"
,equazcion,2008-08-04T14:57Z,My mistake. Episodes 2 and 3 here are actually both episode 3. The link I posted still has the correct episode 2 though. 
,alornmage,2008-10-08T14:19Z,"Just FYI: Episode 3 is actually a repeat of episode 2. Anyone have S3E3 individually?
