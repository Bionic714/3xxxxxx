[V],Subzero!,2007-05-07T20:50Z,try updating Directx (april) ... worked by me and many many others... besides this my kids are playing it aswell since a couple days.... hope you will find a solution!...
,orion70,2007-05-08T21:38Z,doesn't work. missing files... leave it on the seeders disc
[V],Subzero!,2007-05-08T23:45Z,if this does not work you did NOT follow the instructions.... simple that is!.... too bad.... 
,orion70,2007-05-09T09:00Z,"omg! what do you mean by ""instructions""? 

1) UnRar Archive 
2) Double click on ""ToeD.exe"" 
3) Start Game with FLATOUT2.exe Have fun! 

what to do wrong here??? i did excactly this three steps, but there are missing files anyway. the whole torrent is a patchwork by several different users. there are different and wrong batches, uncomplete archives a.s.o. .. this is just crap and nobody cant tell me, he got this to work... never ever!"
[V],Subzero!,2007-05-09T18:37Z,"OK!... i checked that ... you are RIGHT there... but i know how to get it to work... damn toke quite awhile but its sooooo simple... just go to flatout 2 folder when first installation finnished... there must be a file called ""BUILD.EXE"" double click this and wait till it has been injected about 3000 files i guess.... but then IT WORKS!.... next time i  upload  non working warez you are as first allowed to shot me! hehehe"
,Bjergdal,2007-05-15T21:14Z,I can only get to to the 3. track den my screen is frosen ? what can i do?
[V],Subzero!,2007-05-19T05:07Z,"i really dont know!., check out if everything is up 2 date like direct X GFX drivers and shit like that, i really dont have an idea anymore, just if anyone cant get it to work go to game folder and type build.exe and then it goes on installing the game, for all you who still cant get it to work!

[V],Subzero!,2007-06-02T02:19Z,"bullshit, my uploads are virus/trojan tested before they get submitted"
,m0ng00se,2007-06-15T06:16Z,"Subzero!

Thanks for the RIP .. nice size, however, you say its all Virus/Trojan tested, but AVG picked up Trojan.Generic4.PCS on all your TOED.exe files. Do you need those files ?"
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-18T03:05Z,"get a real viruskiller, and why not RAR all infected files, sending them to the website of your viruskiller, and they WILL and CAN tell you that these files are NO VIRUSES, or check by yourself, rename any .txt file to .exe file and your virus tool is telling you it has founded a virus!.

this information your virusfukkenkiller give you is definatly a false info!... believe or dont download em anymore!...."
[V],Subzero!,2007-06-22T23:08Z,"yeah and its needed to have the game proper working later. thats why most people complain, because they install game with her own way of installing(destroy) games, toed.exe is sometimes needed sometimes not, "
