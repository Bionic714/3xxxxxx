,Gmork_Tulle,2007-07-12T11:40Z,"I finally found a player that will play these files!

Zoomplayer WMV Professional 5.00

It's downloadeable at http://www.inmatrix.com/files/zoomplayer_download.shtml#WMV

It takes a lot of computing power, but it plays.

My Pentium D @ 3,15 GHz can only render approximately 16 FPS."
