[V],Subzero!,2008-01-21T05:06Z,"S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe 

( ToeD.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz its the byte by byte check error of em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(heuristics).    >>>  thank you for reading!.

btw: if you dont believe this, then just stay away with childish nonsense like the posts above!...

,1130210,2008-09-27T22:23Z,"Wow you guys are really stupid

it works

-.-

But of course if u scan an unknown executeable
with your antivirus its going to say virus..

Heres a perfect Example

""A Crack Put On A Burnt CD""

Go ahead put a crack on a burnt cd
and scan it with ure AntiVirus

Its going to say its a trojan or virus
because it detects an Unknown Executeable.."
