,420dopeman,2007-05-16T04:39Z,"justpoo ,lol,  I must agree as to this not being my type of game. Actually I havent played it one bit, just to test. But I know there's some RTS fans out there that must appreciate this. 
Takes one with true patience to go at these, I myself need true action, haha.

Cheers mtey."

,20x15,2007-07-19T14:41Z,"Hello Dopeman. 
Something is wrong with this game.
When I try to run it, it just says:
""Sviewport::choosedepthstencilformat- no available depth-stencil format were found""
What's up with that?
Tom"

Also, thanks for making the ""installation"" so easy... no cracks, no pain in the ass installations.. with other words, games for a lazy man like me! Thank you again and keep up the good work !"

It all works fine untill I double-klick the panzers.exe file and there comes up a report box that says: the panzers.exe had run in to a problem and needs to close, and then I press ok and it all closes down. What can the problem be?? I want to play:D"

,ameeba90,2008-08-15T16:51Z,"sebbbe92.

If your running vista you should try to run it in compability mode."
,Hukkapoika,2008-11-02T08:35Z,There is a popup-virus in the .exe file. Doesn't work. Nice waste.
,sean_etc,2009-03-07T08:01Z,"Why didn't you put an installation in?
You cant add new maps or save your game
"
,fleetkid,2010-01-09T08:36Z,Works fine. Thanks :)
,bobbofly,2010-10-06T00:24Z,"Hustaryin & 20X15, do this:
open ""my Computer"" Then (C) Local Disk, open Program Files folder, open PANZERS - phase1 folder, & there's the run folder. open it & you find a notepad document labeled ""options.ini"", which lists ""shadows =""  at a value of ""2"" change that value to ""1"" & presto. depth-stencil format prob solved"
,llovedy,2010-10-16T15:47Z,"Game is fine,,but it is same as order of war.....
dopeman doing good job........hail"
,llovedy,2010-10-21T03:29Z,"ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT!

 In this Phase1.7z(zipped file)...The keygen file was virus(trojan)....so after extraction just remove it...DON'T OPEN it ...For Serial just open dopeman.nfo using notepad..If u don't believe me scan using good antivirus...the good antivirus show while it is extracting ......Aware... 





"
,motley666,2011-03-16T22:13Z,"Lovedy ever heard of false alerts by an antivirus? Btw, this game came out before order of war but anyway i don't think they are the same."
,Rogue-Splinter-Cell,2012-08-13T11:09Z,"For all the dumbasses out there that think keygens, patches, cracks, trainers and other files of the sort are full of viruses just fuckin' search google. You will find out that the programs are deemed ""viruses"" because of their capability of running special software that makes your antivirus software think it has a virus. That so called threat is what makes the game(s) more enjoyable, or flat out playable at all."
,Rogue-Splinter-Cell,2012-08-13T11:13Z,"Awesome seeders by the way, ill have it in no time. Will seed ;)"
