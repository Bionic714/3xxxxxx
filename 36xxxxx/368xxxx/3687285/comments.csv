,TranceDude,2007-05-13T17:57Z,LOL this aint even Trance...
,Malvagita,2007-05-13T18:00Z,TranceDude: Then don't download..;)
,Emohawk,2007-05-14T00:01Z,"Gotta agree with TranceDude... this is NOT trance...

And what the fuck is up with Crazy Frog in there ??? this torrent is like calling it something like ""beautiful girls gets cherry popped"" and instead showing a vid of a granny getting it up the ass!

Calling this torrent trance, is like calling N'Sync good!"
,Malvagita,2007-05-14T10:14Z,"Well, I really respect your opinion. But I don't think that we should argue about this. If you don't like it, don't download it... That's easy...:P"
,PhishShticks,2007-05-19T09:47Z,i can really get into this! so what if it's not bass thumpin' hard hi-nrg trance? it's enough to make my speakers thump and it's enjoyable. 'nuff said :)
,PhishShticks,2007-05-19T09:54Z,"Mal, if you don't mind, do you think you can include track times? I think I may have most of these songs in my library already, but I don't know for sure if the track times match that of your mix. Thanks!"
,Malvagita,2007-05-19T10:13Z,"Okay, I'm not sure if I can edit the Torrents description when I already have uploaded it so...;)
