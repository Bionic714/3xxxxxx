,super_line,2007-05-15T16:16Z,hi im having problems with my sound...there is no sound please tell me how i solve this problem??
,420dopeman,2007-05-15T16:54Z,"no idea guys, got sound on my end, afraid I can not help if I cant dupe the error.

Have you checked to be sure your system can fully support the game? Sounds of maybe a system codec error.

cheers."
,420dopeman,2007-05-15T16:58Z,"maybe try check the official site forums for this game. May come up with some solutions, as this is an exact replica of the original, I've changed nothing this time. I do remember when FEAR first came out many had sound issues due to codecs. Try installing k-lite mega codec pack. Found easily on the web."
,420dopeman,2007-05-15T17:57Z,"actually, im pretty sure the little number 66 next to the word 'seeders' would mean that there are 66 seeders.

,mortenab,2007-05-16T02:08Z,"dont forget that you need some windows installments to run this, like the intros and such need wmp11, and depending on your system you prolly need to install some of the stuff that followed with this game. i did as the info told me plus i installed windowsmedia player 11 and the update to it, and it worked great."
,420dopeman,2007-05-16T11:37Z,"yeah, Ive got a hacked patch I've already put together for everyone, but, I'm doing more research in to it first as I'm not quite sure as to the benefit of it yet, the patch causes you to have to go through a fake phone activation, compliments of razor, cuz they didnt crack the exe , only developed a keygen which will make you have to jump through hoops again to make the gfame work, the patch is only 4mb, and not sure it even has an effect on the game ececpt to allow more cheats, stay tuned and i'll let ya all know,

,super_line,2007-05-16T14:35Z,"sorry to break your moods guyes but this game dosent work for me though...installed DX9.0c and WMP11 , the nessecary files in the folder and updated the soundcards and downloaded anf installed k-lite pack codecs. and STILL no sound...i appreciate the helping comments guys really but what is wrong??? please help me "
,420dopeman,2007-05-16T15:48Z,"There are many games which will not. I would drop that o/s like a bad habbit. DX10 shows up as reverse compatible with many games, codecs are coded differently, and some games simply can not read the 'default setup' of folders and options in vista.

Vista was created for everything and evryone, EXCEPT the PC gamer. Its loaded with no more then business type proggies, bloated dupe files, and more 'hidden' files then any other o/s to date.

Would delete the enitire damn thing if I had it on my system, COMPLETE format of HD, maybe twice!! l

greeetz."
,420dopeman,2007-05-16T16:42Z,"Can't answer that question yet, just because the retail version is not even vailable as of yet.

But I can tell ya this, all the extras, included and which need to be installed with this game, were all developed for XP, vista was not even around when they were developed.

I simple think your problem may be a DX problem related to vista using DX10, but I cant comment any further, I dont use, nor will thhat o/s, prolly for a couple more years yet.

If I come across any more info Ill let ya know, also , try checking the official games site for maybe some answers or clues to troubleshooting.

Donatelo, I am having the same problem as you. LOL. 

I've installed everything... the updated DIRECTX, the WM9 Codec, the VC++ runtimes, the Physx driver.... I followed instruction and I even uninstalled everything and reinstalled everything a couple of times in a row but I can't seem to get it to work. 

I'd see the hugh logo... LOL... but then it would freeze. All the other times I just get a black screen and I even got a ""NxCharacter.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."" It seems as if everytime I reinstall it, I come up with a new problem. :(

I guess I'll just delete everything... and try it again... LOL. If I have any luck, it'll work."

I know it was there when I first unrar it but now when I unrar it again, it's gone. Do I have to download this torrent again or something?"

at 30-40k a sec when they had 2000+ seeds, after a few
hours of research and playing with peer guardian 2, I
found 100's of connections per seconds comming from
two sources. media defender and some other (forget).

I added this to my firewall ACL.

Deny All Protocol ANY 216.73.85.0-216.73.88.255 ANY Any
Deny All Protocol ANY 209.62.175.0-209.62.177.255 ANY Any

Deny All Protocol ANY 64.93.0.0-64.93.255.255 ANY Any

Boom, 400k a sec downloads once again.

As soon as I started peer guardian I noticed the
download speed going up, but it topped out when I
added those to the ACL. 

Beware mediadefender.com"
,Deznaj,2007-06-24T15:21Z,"Dopeman is great. The fact that he stuck in there untill patch 1.3 shows commitment to us downloaders. This game is just crap, and I'm glad that we get to see this before we would buy it.

I managed to play the game, looked OK but nothing that special. It is like a poor man's Oblivion/Gothic 3.

I didn't have any sound the first time, so I installed new drivers for sound and video AND the latest DirectX (april 2007 release). After this I couldn't start the game anymore. I got the same black screen that many people before me got.

Please don't buy the heap of shit that is called ""Two Worlds"". Do not encourage these developers to make any more games. Obviously, they have no respect for gamers."
,Deznaj,2007-06-24T15:29Z,"It actually plays quite nicely, it plays A LOT like Gothic 3 and has a Diablo 2 kind of equipment system. However, the game has so many bugs and hardware issues you'll probably go nuts before you can play it in a normal way. 

Taking in account the 6 hours of game-time, I would rate this game a 7/10. But due to the technical issues I have to tone it down to a 5/10.

I recommended NOT BUYING this game because the developers screwed up the technical issues, and the patches don't fix the major issues."
,Deznaj,2007-06-24T15:32Z,"Seems there is a way to avoid the black screen:

The codec needed to play the videos in the \video directory isn't available on the DVD (or at least I and many others could not find it). So what you should do is play one of the videos in Windows Media Player. WMP should download a new codec and this codec should solve the problem of the black screen.

Still, there are many more technical issues that aren't fixed that easily. Sound for instance is very dodgy. Many drivers are not supported and only stereo and 5.1 sound works.

This is the most unfinished release I have ever seen..."
,Deznaj,2007-06-25T18:33Z,"A hacked patch (by the one and only Dopeman) to version 1.4 is available:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3723133/[PC]_Two_Worlds_1.4_HACKED_PATCH_[dopeman]

I hope it improves the game to a somewhat playable level. It's great to see that Dopeman is still giving us support. YOU DA MAN DOPE!!!

And Spectre 2011, Oblivion is worth the download. It's a solid game that gets a bit tedious in the end."

,jookkor,2007-08-13T08:38Z,"GREAT work dopeman thank you very much!! Very user friendly download, game and patches work great really nice job.
Seems like a pretty fun game so far.


To all you folks having black screen, did you first run setup BEFORE you ran regsetup? It must be done in that order, as dopeman's info says. Remove the game through control panel if you have windows, reinstall it, and run the setup and regsetup and then patch it 1.2-1.3-1.4 and run a keygen and you should be good to go. 

Always open nfo's with notepad or whatever before you even unpack a game/app and then follow the directions exactly."

Glad i didnt buy this cause it doesn't touch oblivion, stopped playing after 3 days! Oblivion + dark messiah are much better games.........."
,jookkor,2007-08-17T14:12Z,"I dont understand people saying that this is a oblivion ripoff....It was in development long before Oblivion came out. And it has nothing in common with Oblivion except perhaps that it shares the same genre. 
maybe these people are new to video games or something...which is fine but dont bother comparing every game to a benchmark of any given genre or you're going to have to wait for long frustrating periods of time for the few and far between games that measure up. 
Like them, hate them, take games for what they are.

I have a 3.2 Gh HT processor

X800 graphics card

2 gigs of ram

Yet the problem i'm getting is quite serious.
I've done every single thing i've need to do in order to play the game.

Everything is working fin until I get to loading the Main menu, it only gets to about 25% before it crashes and takes me to a Blank Blue screen of death. Which then nothing happens and it just stays there..... So the first time this happen I though My computer was oging to blow up because the fans started blowing real hard and all this dust came out of the computer like crazy.

I unplugged it, Removed the game re did everything yet again. Everything is done correctly and yet still same problem. Blank blue screen computer is frozen I have to unplug before computer goes hay wire..... 

It can't possibly be my computer nor any error of mine, I've done every single detail and even came up with some intended solutions of my own.

However, everything fails and loading up the menu makes me crash and same blank blue screen of death....

Can someone find out what's going on? or Am I the only one experiencing this?"

1- Download dopemans two worlds game (duh)

2- extract two worlds folders to your desktop.

3- open my computer, go to program files and create a folder named ""Reality Pump"" without the quoation marks.

4-open the two worlds folder on your desktop and copy the two worlds folder (the two worlds folder inside the one on your desktop, not the one you see on your desktop!!!)  inside to c:/program files/Reality Pump folder that you just created. 

5- install the setup.reg file

6-install the regsetup file

7-DO NOT INSTALL THE HACKED PATCHES!!!  yOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY ANYTHING BUT IN DEMO MODE BECAUSE RAZORS KEYGEN WILL NOT WORK WITH THESE PATCHES!!!

8-play ^^,  If you did not install the patches, the game will already be activated.  enjoy

4-open the two worlds folder on your desktop and copy the two worlds folder (the two worlds folder inside the one on your desktop, not the one you see on your desktop!!!)  inside to c:/program files/Reality Pump folder that you just created. 

5- install the setup.reg file

6-install the regsetup file

7-DO NOT INSTALL THE HACKED PATCHES!!!  yOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY ANYTHING BUT IN DEMO MODE BECAUSE RAZORS KEYGEN WILL NOT WORK WITH THESE PATCHES!!!

8-play ^^,  If you did not install the patches, the game will already be activated.  enjoy

Uh...correct me if I'm wrong...but the three folders that are in the folder when I extracted it only have ""cut""s, what appear to be music files and a bunch of stuff I can't understand. Now, I'm new to the whole Torrenting thing and I don't really get how this is s'posed to work, so can someone help me out?

No logo is shown, just black screen untill i ""ctrl, alt, delete"" and close it.

I have followed the instructions and downloaded the april version og DirectX and mediaplayer 11. Can anyone help me with this? I have ofcause installed the PhysX, VCredist_x86 and the codec pac. 

I have a ""slow"" computer i must admit, but i should be able to pull this game in low details / graphics.

I followed the instructions, which weren't that complicated. And the game works fine...

Though as I've read that some of you guys got problems with the sound. Same here, the music doesn't work, the sound clicking things in main menu doesn't work. I started up the game to see if the problem were just in main menu, but there was no sound in-game neither.

__toni I also lack the LipSync folder, but that turns out to be the synchronization of characters mouths moving correctly to the sound.
So can that really be the problem?
I am unsure, I do hope someone of you guys have a complete working game. If not, well then'll download it with another torrent.

,arcnet,2007-09-25T21:52Z,"Well, I have installed all patches and did everything just like dopeman said in his nfo-Files.

I don't know what the people who cry around do wrong but it runs without any major problems (damn, not even minor ones!)...

I have a notebook, specs are:
* Core2Duo 2x2.0 GHz
* ATI X1700 (just like X1600)
* 1Gb RAM (which is just enough for this game! 2Gb would be better, but 1Gb work)
* Vista x64 Business (/w Windows Update)
* Current PhysX-Driver (but no Card)
* Default-Vista-DirectX (DX10)
* Non-Up-to-date ATI Driver as my GPU is some pimped X1600 ASUS calls a X1700 (I'm happy I got the then-up-to-date driver working when I got Vista)

I'm only missing a guide on how to play on local area network with friends without using the public servers (if possible)...
And if that works I'll buy it - if it doesn't I'll dump it... (MP is the most important part of a RPG!)

greetings (esp. to dopeman for his great work), arcnet"
,arcnet,2007-09-25T22:01Z,"Well, as I look through the comments even more:
Remember: The game is very demanding, so if it doesn't run you have to get a new computer... that's not dopeman's fault it's the company who designed it and who decided not to support older mid-range systems... (beneath that they created a nice rpg ;-) )

And also remember to get Patches 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 (yes, all!)
I installed all at once in exactly that order, used the keygen provided by dopeman and unlocked the game.
Also remember to install the programs dopeman included in the release (PhysX driver and (x86 or x64 - depending on your Operating System) runtime libs)

have fun"

No cheating, just using the maxxed skill alchemy. But i guess one wouldnt have to go and make godlike potions if they wanna play the game properly.

I had a small problem with the audio that I'm sure someone knows how to fix.

    Even if you install this correctly you may still get a black screen if a torrent prog is on and game will never even start logo sequence. Turn off torrents. Idk y but when I turned bittorrent off mine started working.
    For sound porblems install dx 9.0c ?latest edition? from microsoft or where ever.
    This does work in Vista(Ultimate at least), so far only games I had trouble with was Thief3 that ran fine after NoCD fix and NWN1 which never has worked yet.
    Last but not least, listen to dopeman, that is all.

Not sure if this will work, but try updating your directx to the latest version, it appears that the file you mention is part of the directx runtime files. I'm not sure though, but you lose nothing by trying. I think there's a directx file somewhere in the archive, so use it. Hope it helps."

Well, I have the same version. I just downloaded it from this exact site that you are on and didn't pay anything.

So my question is, who is really the fuckup?

,smokey213,2010-03-24T23:41Z,"Ok READ THIS!!! I downloaded and everything was fine then I read the read me and followed these steps exactly.
1. I made a folder on my desktop called two worlds
2. i right clicked on the download of two wolds in bit torrent and clicked open containig folder.
3.I opend the read me and followed instructions.
4.I extracted the two worlds rar file
5.I opend the folder called two worlds and ran the SETUP.reg and it says     

(Adding information can untentionally change or delete values and cause components to stop working correctly. If you do not trust the source of this information in C:\program files(x86)\reality Pump\two worlds\two worlds\setup.reg.reg,do not add it to the registry.

are you shure you want to coninue?)

and i push yes. then it says (the keys and values contained in C:program files(x86)\reality Pump\two worlds\two worlds\setup.reg.reg have been added to the registry

NOTE: I have everything in the reality pump folder NOW but when i did this the first time it was all in the first two worlds folder i made on my desktop.

after that i click Ok that being the only option.

7.then i run the Regsetup and it asks where i want to install it. The first time I fucked with this I told it the two worlds folder on my desktop cuz the readme says WHERE YOU HAVE THE GAME but it wants to make a folder in program folder x86) called reality pump. I still skipped the reality pump and went with the folder i made on my desktop.

8.Then I moved them to a folder i made called gameing in my program files x86 just so i could be EXACT to the readme. moved all the files over and the uninstll came up with setup.clg and according to the readme i was ready to enjoy my game. BOOM no i wasnt because i got a black screen that doesent go away and crt alt del doesnt matter because some how two worlds is running but task manager doesent see it. so i have to boot my pc back up.

so after that long fuck up i tried the physX and it installed and i did the VC++ and they both install because i have WIN 7. BUT the codec thing does not work because i have WIN 7 and it just says (blah blah fuck you this is for windows xp, me, and 2000). 

SO that being said could someone with vista or WIN 7 give me an even better detailed description than Dopeman? Then after you do that tell me why the games fuckin sound doesent work even if you install 34527557 copies of directX 9.0 and do pretty much everything anyone suggested.

So lets have a recap
I need a detailed description on how to install this game and i mean DETAILED.

Then If you could PLEASE FIGURE OUT THE SOUND FIX that really does work or maybe mesh all of them into one comment so i can go down the list and check all of em off for not workin. this game blows after 3 hours of no sound it makes you mental.

and dont think im asking you for something and giving you nothing if your help actually helps me I plan on posting the info accross like a million sites that people have been needing help.

DOPEMAN I DOWNLOAD YOUR SHIT ALL THE TIME BUT I AM NO FAN. NOT SAYING YOUR SHIT IS BAD BECAUSE MOST OF IT WORKS OR CAN WORK. BUT ONLY AFTER HOURS OF ME STAYING SEARCHING THE NET FOR SOLUTIONS. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT MORE IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME THE FEED BACK INSTEAD OF ONE OF YOUR DOWNLOADERS. 

I know my pc can run this game because it has b4 and i have WIN 7 OS so i can run in campatablity mode. PLEAE PLEASE HELP"
,smokey213,2010-03-25T03:50Z,Ok i fixed the game startin up problem on my own with no help. but i have no sound still and im not gonna bitch and complain like others and just say i have no sound at all. I have windows 7 and the codecs provided will not work. i got online and downloaded some codec packs and that didnt resolve the problem then i did the direct X 9 thing and still nothing at all then someone told me to uninstall then reinstall and that did nothing either. i will say that the files in the win folder inside the Xact folder are blank pages for icons and if you click on them they ask what program you want them to be ran with. is that something? shouldnt they have a program running them? IDFK whats up i spent a whole day and a half awake doing nothing but trying to resolve the there being no sound it would be nice to get an answer and not a sugestion maybe someone with vista or win 7 has had this problem. i was thinking that i should move the files in the win folder to the location of the win folder? like just get rid of the win folder but keep the files? also the game is working outside of program files so maybe it actually does need to be in the program files. Should it be in a completly new folder or does it need to be in the reality pump folder? also someone told me that if there are 2 two worlds folders they need to be in the second one because the game wont be able to locate the audio files. please someone. if i find the solution then i will deff post a extremely detailed way on how to fix. thnks for the game anyway.
,smokey213,2010-03-25T22:29Z,HERE IS HOW TO GET THE SOUND TO WORK 100% IM SHORE OF IT. FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY. IF YOU HAVE TWO WORLDS INSTALLED UNINSTALL IT BY RUNNING THE REGSETUP AGAIN AND IT SHOULD SAY DO YOU WANT TO UNINSTALL? CLICK YES (IF THIS DOESENT POP UP THEN JUST GO TO ADD AND REMOVE) AFTER IT IS UNINSTALLED MAKE SHURE YOU HAVE THE REALITY PUMP FOLDER IN YOUR PROGRAM FILES. IF YOU DO THEN AWSOME THERE SHOULD BE A FOLDER IN IT CALLED TWO WORLDS WITCH WILL TAKE YOU TO ALL YOUR OTHER FILES AND FOLDERS INCLUDING ANOTHER TWO WORLDS FOLDER. MOVE ALL THOSE FILES TO WHERE THE FIRST TWO WORLDS FOLDER IS. THE ONE RIGHT AFTER YOU CLICK REALITY PUMP. IT WILL ASK YOU TO REPLACE TWO WORLDS FOLDER CLICK YES. NOW RUN THE SETUP AND AFTER IT DOES ITS FAST LITTLE THING RUN THE REGSETUP AND IT SHOULD GO AS NORMAL. NOW I DID THIS IDK IF ITS NEEDED BUT MY LONG ASS INTERNET BROWSING TOLD ME TO DO IT SO JUST DO IT ANYWAY (MOVE ALL THE FILES IN THE WIN FOLDER THAT IS LOCATED IN THE XACT FOLDER TO WHERE YOUR TWO WORLDS EXE IS. DONT JUST MOVE THE WIN FOLDER ACTUALLY GO IN IT AND SELECT ALL OF THE FILES AND COPY THEM DONT CUT THEM AND PATE EM TO WHERE I TOLD YA. NOW RUN THAT SHIT AND BOOM. I REALLY HOPE THIS HELPS CUZ IT TOOK ME 2 DAYS OF READING TO ACTUALLY GET THIS. PLEASE GIVE ME SOME FEED BACK HERE AND LET ME KNOW IF IT HELPED YOU. AND SORRY FOR ALL CAPS BUT AFTER MY 2 DAYS OF LOOKIN ON HOW TO FIX THIS I REALLY THINK IT WAS NEEDED.
,Oligreen666,2010-04-03T03:10Z,I'm on xp and I only have a black screen when I run the game...
,GamerGrrl,2010-04-26T09:16Z,"Okay, today (April 26th 2010), I just managed to successfully get the sound working after spending an hour trying to work out what I done wrong.

Once you've unzipped the files, click on the ""regsetup.exe"" file and see where the game would automatically install itself - For me it was Program Files (x86) / Reality Pump / Two Worlds - Now that folder currently did not exist so I cancelled the install, went to Programe Files (x86), created a folder called ""Reality Pump"", created one inside of it called ""Two Worlds"" and then copied the ""[PC] Two Worlds [COMPLETE] [ENG] [dopeman]"" file into the ""Two Worlds"" one I just created. I then renamed the ""[PC] Two Worlds [COMPLETE] [ENG] [dopeman]"" file to ""Two Worlds"" 

Then I went into the newly named ""Two Worlds"" file (so you're now at Program Files (x86) / Reality Pump / Two Worlds / Two Worlds) - And then I did the whole ""click setup.reg"" thing, let that sort itself out, then I clicked the ""regsetup.exe"" and when it got to the bit where you select the file path I told it to go to Program Files (x86) / Reality Pump / Two Worlds / Two Worlds

..So in my Program Files (x86) / Reality Pump / Two Worlds / Two Worlds folder I now have the Uninstall appear like it should!

I started up the game (right clicked and done ""run as administrator"") and WHOO - SOUND WORKED!

Sorry for the wall of text, but I wanted to be specific in how I go the sound to work for me :] Let me know if you've got any questions and I'll try to help!"
,The7isbest,2010-05-12T11:39Z,"Hey... I've tried both the methods to get sound working but neither worked... This is really making me angry, because I can't play a game without sound... Please help.

,AOSSK,2010-06-17T23:38Z,"Hey Guys and Gals if you are still having problems try these steps. It took me some time but i figured it out and yes it has sound and for windows vista 32bit tested.
1. Extract Two Worlds.zip to your desktop
2. In your program files folder create a folder called (Reality Pump)
3. Move the two world folder from you desktop to the Reality Pump Folder. 
4. Run setup.reg
5  Run regsetup.exe select the two worlds location if not already and continue
6. Install the other programs from the download which dopeman provided.
7. Run the game in Administrator mode and play.
If it still doesnt work go to game copy world and download the video intro fix heres the link http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_two_worlds.shtml download the NO INTRO FIX copy and paste them in and play if it still doesent work im sorry because thats as much as i found out"

,TheCreative,2011-01-27T20:55Z,"When I want to install the WM9Codec it gives this error: ""This version of Windows Media Codecs can be installed only on Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003"" I cant find a version for my Windows 7 nor for Windows Vista. Any one knows how to solve this? Thanks

All else works after some hours spend on fixing errors, I can play the game but I don't have sound, I think this WM9Codec error is the reason because my Win folder is fine."

,PhysX37,2011-09-26T18:04Z,"Works great! Just a reminder: patching the game to latest patch is always good, actually the game is ridiculous without the latest patch. Normally download patch after patch from GamersHell.
Then when you have the latest patch, look for a NoCD Crack at GameCopyWorld.com!"
