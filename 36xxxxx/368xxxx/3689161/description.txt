- Release Notes
* heard the guy doing the regular non scene 
rls was going to be delayed until some time 
tomorrow so i figured I'd upload this for instead
of just keeping this rip for my self.
* video gets laggy around 36:22-36:32 but audio
is unaffected, nothing goes out of sync.
* 624x352, 592x336... its not a HDTV rip so
it really makes no difference. if anything it helps 
the quality
* Q: double the frame rate, shouldn't it be 
double the file size? A: no crazily it makes
no difference. (its not just AABB repeat, but 
truly 59.94 unique fps)
* Enjoy
