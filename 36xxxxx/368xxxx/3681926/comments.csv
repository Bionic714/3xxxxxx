,Aga1980,2007-05-06T20:58Z,Too bad you stripped extra's...
,DTSES,2007-05-06T21:10Z,There is no extra's on this disc so it's not stripped.
,Nescio,2007-05-07T20:56Z,"Good work, DTSES, plans for the other 18 bond-movies?"
,DTSES,2007-05-07T22:08Z,"It's doable if people like them, not so many downloaders and I seed too much on these 2 so far. Everybody need to stay 1:1 in down/upload.
But if people writes in the commentary that they wants more realeses of Ultimate series then why not."
,Nescio,2007-05-07T23:21Z,Thanx. I want more releases of this serie! Amazing quality!
,Tiny Turtle ,2007-05-14T14:07Z,"Thanks a lot for these!

The difference in picture quality between these and the previous Special Editions (which are the ones being sold together with the Swedish tabloid Expressen if someone didn't know) is tremendous. Here's a link to a comparison (for Diamonds are forever, but it's the same story for most of the movies in the series): http://www.bulletsnbabesdvd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2316

Of course the SE versions only have good sound on the latest films (which are the ones Expressen began releasing) while the early films come in mono instead of thes which all have a dts track (Thanks for losing the DD track completely, DTSES!)."
,mamboze,2008-06-09T10:21Z,"Please seed, I would certainly like to get this and other Bond movies. And yeah, DTSES, I agree with you, it is important for people downloading cult movies and music to maintain a good share ratio. Everybody should, of course, but with the more popular stuff, there's always some seeds around.

,mamboze,2008-06-12T02:30Z,"PLZ Seed, I'm sitting on about 44% with 2(5) peers, no way we can d/l without a seed PLZ"
