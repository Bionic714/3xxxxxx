Orders and Initiatives (September 1941-March 1942)

\\\"Orders and Initiatives\\\" highlights the crucial decision-making period of the 
Holocaust, encompassing the secret plans of Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and 
Reinhard Heydrich. At a conference at Wannsee in January 1942, the participants work 
toward finalizing their goal-the systematic genocide of an entire people. The first 
gas chambers are built at Auschwitz and the use of Zyklon B is developed. German 
doctors arrive to oversee each transport, deciding who should live and who should 
die.
