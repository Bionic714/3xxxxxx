Half Life 2 with Cinematic MOD 4 and addons

Addons: Half life episode 1, Day of defeat, Deathmatch, Counter strike source, Lost coast, metastasis 2.

Half life 2 Cinematic MOD 4 changes most of the game textures with ultra-high resolution  almoust life-like textures, it also changes all the game characters in the game with more complex ones with a higher polygon count.

Aditional Alyx skins included.

System requirements:

- decent video card with atleast 512MB video memory (for maximum texture resolution)
- monitor capable of 1280x1024 (1600x1200 optimal)
- 2GB RAM
- Pentium 4 @ 3.4GHZ
- atleast 20GB free disk space


Known issues: on some maps, when you try to save the game or load a new map, the game crashes with error message "Abnormal program termination"  the workaround for this is to switch texture rezolution to medium before saving/loading new map when encountering those problematic maps (ex begining of the game just after teleporter malfunction).
This is caused by poor memory management in the half life 2 engine. The game engine cannot handle the high resolution textures properly and sometimes it just runs out of resources and crashes.
