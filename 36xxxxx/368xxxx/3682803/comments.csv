...and perhaps you shoud try defragmenting your HDD more often. And you shoud make shure first it isn`t your system that is unstable.
I haven`t made the game engine sow i cannot fix the crashes, all I can do is explain how to avoid them. That I did in the torrent description."

,equinoxlb,2007-07-30T20:58Z,This is awesome. But I don't quite understand how to get the Alyx mods to work. Is it possible to get a bit of guidance/instructions? How do I change her appearance?? Thanks for the excellent contribution.
