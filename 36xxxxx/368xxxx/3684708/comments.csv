Nice try tho....

,NezzoX,2007-05-10T12:06Z,It is the real deal allright. Deacent quality and so on... BUT! The album in itself is a bit of a dissapointment... but that blood is on the hands of Linkin Park.
,luffarungen,2007-05-14T15:56Z,"u dickheads!

this is why the new album isn't as good as the previous ones.

ppl downloaded Meteora instead of buying it, thus the record label gave them less creativity roles and this is the outcome from it all.

and what do u ppl do? U go and download it AGAIN!"

They changed their style because they didnt want to ""Be a part of the whole rap/rock scene"" and be unique, which is really the opposite of what they did because they completely changed their unique style to sound like everybody else.

Ive said it before, Im saying it again. I can only pray that the next album retraces back to their roots and they actually cater to their original fans and not the Laguna Beach crowd."
