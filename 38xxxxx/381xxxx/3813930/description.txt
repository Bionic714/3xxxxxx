powerful & compelling, 25 January 2004


Author: rci from Toronto, Ontario 

The first time in a long time that I\\\\\\\'ve seen a movie audience launch into applause at the end -- and I was as enthusiastic as everyone else.

While quite long (2 hours, 45 minutes)this film piles detailed examples on top of interviews on top of documentary film clips. Liberally laced with interviews with folks like Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, it also includes insightful commentary from a (small) handful of liberated corporate executives.

The sum total is a compelling story of the evil that can be and is done by and in the name of corporations. I say this as one who has worked in a corporate environment my entire career, and who for a very long time has had difficulty getting past the \\\\\\\'but these are almost all nice people -- I don\\\\\\\'t know any ogres out to intentionally rape & pillage\\\\\\\' perspective.

What I\\\\\\\'m gradually wakening to is the realization that yes, the corporate structure is very efficient at doing what it\\\\\\\'s designed to do -- which unfortunately does not include taking social responsibility or the greater good into account. Instead it\\\\\\\'s ruthlessly focused on the bottom line, come hell (literally) or high water -- or polluted water.

I highly recommend this film. I know I\\\\\\\'ll be going back for a second viewing -- there\\\\\\\'s that much content, that I know I didn\\\\\\\'t absorb it all the first time around.
