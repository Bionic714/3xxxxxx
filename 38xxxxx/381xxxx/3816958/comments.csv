,idymalgia,2008-05-25T23:58Z,"thx m8, great stuff"
,Demonsoul98,2008-06-06T23:01Z,Great discography. Only problem I had was that Awake isn't a Disturbed song. It's by a band called Clay People and in the Strangeland soundtrack. Great torrent otherwise.

A couple of the songs belong in the album, Believe,  but do not show up under that album, so be careful!

,fuzzyballs84,2009-04-30T10:46Z,"Grungi you are a fucking moron. They have 4 albums, Indestructible, 10,000 Fists, Believe, and The Sickness. Use you fucking brain and think before posting your dumb ass comments."
,sloshy,2009-05-13T02:32Z,"Waste of time and space.  Incomplete albums, ID3 tags are a horrid mess.  Can't believe you tards actually think this was a good torrent.  Fawking awful.  Don't download unless you wanna spend hours correcting Dr4k0nis's mistakes."

,iRSammyBoy,2009-08-17T12:29Z,"WTF!? Firstly this torrent is missing one album, secondly it has shitty ID3 tags and it is missing some songs and it also has a song which ISN'T EVEN BY DISTURBED! It is done by The Clay People!  Does this guy even have their CD's or bother to look though his work?
THIS TORRENT IS SHIT AND IT IS NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING!!"
,ANicki_InTheUk,2009-09-04T05:12Z,"jeez u guys are all so bitter and ungrateful, i can understand why people wouldn't bother to upload anymore. "
,Madd_Dowg,2009-09-24T22:00Z,"Wow, did the file info have to be cleaned up! but great upload thanks!!!"
,holywoodj,2009-10-29T18:52Z,Not a great torrent. Ruined ID3 tags and songs unnamed all over the place. Missing an Album too. Plenty better torrents for Disturbed Discography.
,CaptainHook15,2009-11-30T18:10Z,"Great Torrent, Works fine :)"
,Kippenson,2010-01-24T20:55Z,seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed please!
,DieRooie,2010-02-10T19:54Z,lol these are not all albums he doesn't have indestructible
,joethehoe,2010-03-22T02:41Z,"The torrent was uploaded before Indestructible came out, If you took the time to collect all the songs and make your own CD cover why didn't you take the time to name all the songs properly?"
,Army_Combat_Ninja,2010-09-19T23:43Z,"Here's my review:
- Download: 10/10, took a little under 15 min with average download speed of 340.2kB/s
- AVG virus scan clean
- Sound quality: 10/10
- the extra songs are ok but I'd prefer to go without, 
- it's like some of the songs are confused were they belong, some of the songs are unorganized
OVERALL RATING: 8/10"
,GoldEaglez,2010-09-20T01:50Z,Go here to recieve All the albums including Asylum. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5840847

,Somacruz_92,2011-02-10T00:15Z,Yo gotta update this with Asylum maaaaaan! But great upload still.
,pvtpatrick96,2011-08-04T19:42Z,"@DieRooie dude, this torrent was uploaded in September 2007. indestructible was released in 2008."
