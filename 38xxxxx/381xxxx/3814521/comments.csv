,eskillz,2008-10-24T23:08Z,"Great album, but crappy sound..."
,Helegad,2008-12-22T11:48Z,"All of you, stop being cunts. You got the album 5 days before release, you should be sucking the uploader's dick for that. The tracklisting has been written by The Alchemist, so use that. I always end up rewriting the ID3 tags anyway."
