,digitalaflaesk,2007-10-05T17:51Z,Hejabonden - Läs? (Retail 2007)
,TCM2003,2007-10-07T03:45Z,They suck with the new lead singer
,Simppu_theman,2007-10-07T18:28Z,the new lead singer is awesome
,FaZ,2007-10-09T21:29Z,"no the new lead singer is not awesome... Even that she is from Sweden (FUCK YEAH) I disslike her. She should be in some pop-video or doing ""schlager"".. They dont need any female.. They have done some songs without female voice and they were f**** great!!"
,Lord Marlle,2007-10-11T15:08Z,super nice.. i love the new singer and this record is probably one of the finest from nightwish
,Baxter26,2007-10-12T20:29Z,The new leadsinger sucks big time you can barely hear her... and she can't pronounce the words...
,no_maam,2007-10-13T01:44Z,thanx. great album but tarja is still the queen of darkness..
,Prometheusfire,2007-10-15T19:03Z,Thanks! New singer is actually a lot better then I thought she'd be.
,akarl818,2007-10-16T13:20Z,"Baxter26: And you think Tarja could pronounce the words correctly? ""The elven BATH""?? haha. But yet Nightwish is and will always be a grait band."
,meap0rd,2007-10-16T17:28Z,No its no voice talking in the middle of the songs in this album
,reekie,2007-10-17T08:49Z,"Loving it!
Thanks for uploading this!
(Thumbs up!)"
,Elmacoo,2007-10-18T19:45Z,New singer is great ;P
,FatFreddy247,2007-10-19T21:12Z,what's the bitrate?  228kbps (vbr) ???
,BadSwe,2007-10-20T13:50Z,"To FaZ: your a dumbass. New singer IS great, and without a fem-singer? Nightwish whouldnt became the band it is, if they hadnt. So go listen to Hitz4Kidz.. fag.
Rest: Album is ok, MAYBE a few songs to much, 1 cd with the best whould be better.
Is 128kbps, witch is enough.. higher is for noobs thinking they got cat-ears (man cant hear more)."
,grandjean110,2007-10-25T02:05Z,"nice ;)
thanks dude =D"
,Tinasoturi,2007-10-27T11:27Z,they shouldn´t take anette as a singer. Marko (basist) would be better i know because he sings also in tarot- Tinwarrior .   
,Tinasoturi,2007-10-27T11:28Z,"But nightwish isn´t nightwish without female singer ;D 
-Tinwarrior"
,pops87pl,2007-10-28T13:27Z,Anette sux
,resonator,2007-11-02T20:39Z,"Great album from NW, more orchestral /adventurous than before. New swedish singer Anette Olzon does a fine job, but they could have added som more studio effects and volume on her vocals in the production. Tarja Turunen was for sure better, but became a real diva bitch and was kicked from the band. Nevertheless, she is now returning to the music scene with her new solo album later in November."
,frozenmega man,2007-11-06T13:35Z,"i prefeer tarja :( but she is ok i guess...

download speed is awsome "
,vaktyuk,2007-11-07T01:05Z,"surely there is no match to Tarja, the dark light of the Luna. it will take time to get used to the new voice and hopefully with practice she managed to add more strength vand enthusiasm to her tone...i wish it for all of us...

i music is the best ever however..."
,vivic,2007-11-08T15:51Z,thx
,wr4tchild,2007-11-09T09:26Z,"Stop bullying Anette. May be that her voice ain't as ""special"" as Tarjas but she's probably the one of them who have the widest range of expression. Tarja always sang in a very ""big"" way while Anette is more flexible in her singing, adjusting to situations in the songs"
,Pepethebest,2007-11-12T12:04Z,I think the music sounds best ever but i prefer that Tarja was a better singer and its a shame that she isnt in nightwish anymore but still the music rocks! :D
,Pave64,2007-11-21T20:20Z,"Works great, many thanks!"
,maximumdistance,2007-12-01T21:39Z,I saw Nightwish yesterday.. They rule and Anette is awesome!!! Seriously she owns the old songs too.
,Mysticum81,2007-12-13T03:55Z,"Thanks a ton for this! It's a pity there's so many encoding errors. More snaps, crackles and pops than in a full bowl of cereal :("
,Mysticum81,2007-12-13T14:32Z,"I'd just like to add that this is without a doubt my favorite Nightwish album so far. I realize a lot of people miss Tarja's vocals, and that's cool, but I prefer the (admittedly more generic) vocals of this new chick. Check it out if you haven't already! The encoding errors I mentioned earlier seem to only really affect the first couple of songs."
