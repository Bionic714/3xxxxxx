-do not zip or rar it (you can put multiple files into one torrent) By packing it an avi will not get smaller anyway, it is compressed already.

-give it a real name (title of film, year, language, if not English) including info about source(DVDRip, TS, R5, CAM etc)

Bit small for a DVDrip, isn't it?

cheers"
,rogard,2007-09-21T19:59Z,"oh, and give more info about the film in the description. An IMDB link is always nice to have.
