The Venture Bros. is an American animated television series airing as part of Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. Notable for its strong continuity, complex characters and unexpected plot twists, it chronicles the adventures of two dopey teenage boys, Hank and Dean Venture; their super-scientist father, Dr. Thaddeus \\\"Rusty\\\" Venture; and their family\\\'s bodyguard, secret agent Brock Samson.

The series pays homage to the style of the classic Hanna-Barbera action series Jonny Quest. Hank and Dean\\\'s roles resemble those of Jonny and Hadji, Dr. Venture is a caricature of Dr. Benton Quest, and Brock Samson presents a testosterone-loaded, excessively violent take on Race Bannon, who has appeared in the show. Flashbacks show that Dr. Venture was like Jonny Quest in his youth, and his own father was a more traditional \\\"Dr. Quest\\\". The show also parodies The Hardy Boys mysteries and comic book superheroes.

Season three is set to begin in winter 2007-2008.
