Download Direct (also known as DLD) was developed to accelerate your downloads by up to 500% (sometimes more) and let you manage them via one central screen. We wanted to ensure ease of use for the average home user with its simple, clean, great looking interface, but included features for even the most demanding, high usage internet users.
