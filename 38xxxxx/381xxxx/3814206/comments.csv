Q: Is using Glider cause for suspension/ban? 
A: Yes, Glider is against the Terms of Service as provided by Blizzard for World of Warcraft. If you are detected using Glider, your account will be suspended for 72 hours and very likely banned completely. While Glider does not violate any of the terms listed under Blizzard's ""Client/Server Manipulation Policy"", it is still a third-party program and their Terms of Service are very open in what falls under that definition, meaning they can find you in violation for pretty much anything they want.
Glider provides a number of features to help lower the risk of detection - for more information, see the next topic.

Bottom line: use at your own risk.



Q: Is Glider detectable? 
A: There are two methods of detection for Glider or any other third-party tool:

1) The game itself detects the software by searching memory, your hard drive, window titles, or some other means. The current version of Glider (1.5.1 August 27, 2007) is not known to be detected by these methods. However, it is technically possible for Blizzard to change their detection scheme, if they come up with a new way to detect Glider. This risk cannot be avoided, as the game client can update any time. You can help lower your risk by following the suggested settings as posted in the Announcements forum.

2) You can also be detected by a human observing you and noting repeated patrols, robotic behavior, etc. This can largely be avoided by always staying near your computer while gliding. Glider also has a number of features built-in, such as detection of whispers or other players following you. Be careful to avoid areas with lots of obstructions and follow the tips in the help file when setting up profiles. 

Unattended automated play is always risky and should not be done in busy areas for a long time.

,dot584,2007-09-23T03:41Z,"""This fo real?""
 No. I loaded this up and I either did it wrong, or my virus protection is right and its a virus."
,gobl,2007-09-25T09:37Z,it will show up as a virus if you use avg or some other ones i cant remember at ths time i've tried out the original demo from their site and it does the same tho its not a virus!
,jimpa91,2007-09-25T16:35Z,Can anyone who have tried this out confirm that it isn't a virus and if it actually works? thx
,gobl,2007-09-25T18:48Z,just downloadet it and well i doubt i will try this one out since its showing a backdoor that aint the one known from the original software i would sadly not reccomend this one
,mygan,2007-09-25T20:19Z,"Funkar denna? inget virus? 

Do this work? no virus?"
,voidster,2007-09-26T16:01Z,ive been wanting to try this out on a priv server just to test things. Ill run all the scans i can to see if its infected or not..and i wont let it connect beyond the internal ip. that should prove one way or the other if its a trojan.
,voidster,2007-09-26T16:22Z,"although, the few anti-spy/trojan and anti virus programs i have didnt come up with anything evil, this just doesnt seem to work right. The installer flipped out due to my firewall, and even then after allowing it to connect it still failed. I suspect this is nothing more than a keylogger. "

,SharpieFTW,2007-12-16T08:23Z,"If you nubs would read the virus report... god. The ""virus"" that is supposed to be in the program is a rootkit that is used to help hide itself from Warden (WoW's anticheat system)

This file has a lot of other bad shit that I wouldn't even use.

And to be honest. I purchased the WoW Glider and have my own working key for it. Unfortunately, what I didn't know at the time was how stupidly easy it is for you to get banned for using it. 
If Warden does not pick up that you're using it, a player will be able to tell from a mile away. I play on Laughing Skull and every day and I go to STV just so I can kite around and repeatedly kill the gliders that are running around the jungle there. They're all over the place, and it's easy to tell because a majority of them usually have like 2-3 people running the SAME path. Idiots... all of you -_-

But anyways, back to the point. Don't DL this one."
,kivann94,2008-01-10T12:37Z,some one know if it have virus ??
