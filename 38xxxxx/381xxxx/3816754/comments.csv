Might I suggest switching to UTorrent or Bittorrent, seems to have greater success.

I'll try to seed at least a month, 24 hours a day. Until someone else wants to seed."
,spiderziggy,2007-09-28T16:43Z,I would love to have this. Please seed.
,spiderziggy,2007-09-29T21:35Z,Do you have any more O.J. stuff vpvp?
,vpvp,2007-10-01T01:40Z,"Maybe more, but it would be on not well labeled videotape. The Goldmans have been on Larry King many times. Probably have one or more of those interviews. Sorting through dozens of VHS tapes can be a pain. Hope the quality turned out OK for the three programs here. Watchable, but not DVD quality."
,spiderziggy,2007-10-01T14:24Z,The quality was very good in my opinion no complaints. If you find something new please seed. I uploaded that E-TV documentary to youtube btw.
