This is the same as the \"332 Woodworking Plans and Tips AIO\" torrent that is circulating the sites.

The difference is that this torrent doesn\'t have 100 mb of crappy songs and a flippin\' music video and a \"leet\" container file. It\'s just the plans. I stripped out all the junk.

The plans are OK, not great, just OK. There\'s probably a dozen things you\'ll want to read though, and it\'s a small file.

Would someone please get a good copy of \"The Best of Fine Woodworking\" up and running?

Thanks!
