The exe file is for the DreamCast only - it's a Windows CE file, but isn't designed for the x86 platform, so of course it's going to fail. You need a DreamCast system to play it."
,dustypie,2008-06-30T22:30Z,I didnt get it from here but this game is pretty cool.  Got canceled at the last second mostly because of long load times.  Fun and cool to have considering it never came out...
,SinisterDexter,2008-07-31T03:54Z,This works fine. Burning the image using Nero worked but trying to burn using Toast (Mac) failed - even though Toast supposedly supports .NRG files.
,S8,2008-08-24T17:22Z,"It does work, although I had problems burning it with Nero 8. My DC wouldn't recognise the disc I burned.
So I took one of those dud discs I burned and used a really old copy of Discjuggler ( v3.5 ) and created a CDI of the disc, then burned it slowly and it worked.
Maybe if you used an old Nero like v5 it would work too."
,champ006,2008-08-31T17:29Z,"didn't work for me either. winrar tells me it needs 00.rar also had to rename all files to rar, cause these are not appropriate files. not sure if i should download again.. also looks like this torrent is just triing to advertise segshub.org"
,dathip,2008-09-18T02:36Z,"hey guys should i see alcohol 120 for this or Nero, because IM getting a brand new dreamcast in  the mail in tomorrow "
,twistedmaddscreeming,2008-12-04T01:55Z,i get a strange error that says no controller
,yayap1,2009-01-06T08:05Z,"This works great! Thanks! I burnt using the latest Nero and at 24x with HP Media. It loads up on my Dreamcast, but the game has slow loading times. I think it is just how the game was made.  Shame it was never released officially."
,mrhuxley,2009-02-04T13:51Z,"Worked fine for me too, thanks."
,LordOrwell,2009-03-30T20:55Z,"if you had trouble unzipping the files, your version of winrar must be ancient.  They redid the way they support multipart archives a couple of versions ago due to the fact they were running out of extension numbers.  I unzipped this easily using 7zip.  Anyone have a good emulator that will play it?"
,rj-300zx,2009-09-06T03:35Z,Seed please and thank you to those that do.
,ryanjtx326,2011-01-29T19:06Z,Seed please. ^.^
