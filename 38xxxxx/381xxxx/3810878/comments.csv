,Bruno714,2007-09-18T17:49Z,Can you post the serials #'s? That would be a great help for those of us who've already downloaded
,phobia22,2007-09-18T19:38Z,"Great :-)

Does this include the plugs and Main Stage?

Do you know where  to get the complete Studio package with all jampacks, patches and samples etc too ?"
,phobia22,2007-09-18T19:51Z,"One more thing:

""After install you will need to do software update to get the latest pro application support.""

Is this safe? Isn't the serial registered?"
,adam666,2007-09-18T20:03Z,"@phobia22:you don't put the serial in till after u install pro app sup.i unplugged network when entering serial just in case, and use little snitch too stop it phoning home."
,phobia22,2007-09-18T20:45Z,"adam666, thanks.

This the best thing happening for some time :-)

,JariLitmanen,2007-12-13T22:20Z,"Hi. I have some problems recording with my Saffire device. I have earlier used garageband som I'm pretty new at this. Anyways, when I plug in my bas and pres record there's no sound at all. What should I do?  "
,aREALmacuser,2007-12-15T08:29Z,"My GOD... how stupid are some of you people? Is it really that hard to do just a teeny-tiny bit of research on your own before you both bother people on here AND make yourself look like a dumb-ass? First of all... as was already said... this is a MAC application... so NO you can't run this on Vista... there's nothing you can do to make it run on Vista.. and why the hell are you even running Vista in the first place? Oh... let me guess.. you saw a copy on here and downloaded it just for shits and giggles without knowing jack-squat about it, right?

Secondly... for the other idiot... you either don't know what system you're running or you don't know what kind of machine you're running... there's no way you can be running 10.3.9 on an intel mac... besides, anyone running anything prior to x.4.9 will not be able to run this program.

Thirdly... if you're trying to run a program like this on some hacked install of OS X on some generic beige box... then good luck with keeping that hacked-together POS up and running. If you want to run a hugely intensive program like this then go buy an actual Mac. I realize most of you are cheap but come on... if you can't even buy a Mac then you have no business even trying to steal programs like this.

beyond all that... if it's not working for you - TOO DAMN BAD. If you want it to work for sure then go to Apple and pay them the $500 it costs for the program... otherwise, quit your balking. 

I'm willing to bet that 98% of don't even need a program like this... there are plenty of other cheaper, less resource intensive programs out there that would more than suit your needs. And if you are by some slight chance someone who actually needs a program like this for business purposes (because that's the only reason anyone would need a program like this) then you can probably afford to purchase it."

""if you can't even buy a Mac then you have no business even trying to steal programs like this.""

You think people that don´t have money don´t deserve to use good products? Only who pays deserve to use them? Or you can only ""steal"" the program if you buy a real mac? What´s the logic in this?

,Schweinstein,2010-01-28T07:06Z,"_NSProGrayLook Problem (Bounces on Dock then suddenly quits)

I was so irritated because I was experiencing the same problem, only thing is, is that I have an iBook G4 PPC in which I had used Logic Pro 8 just fine, until my hard drive crashed and I was getting annoyed because I had fixed my iBook however, when I tried installing Logic Pro 8, it refused to work with all the updates etc. 

I believe I have found a solution to your problem as Logic Pro 8 now works fine for me. I have Tiger 10.4.11. I did install in this order; 

Logic Pro 8 
Logic Pro 8.0.2 (Update) (Do NOT use software update use the apple site) 
ProApp Support 
ProKit Support  

You need the 8.0.2 update which can be found here; 

http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/application_updates/logicpro802.html 

This works for 10.5 aswell and is a universal binary. Whilst I'm running 10.4.11 I would be surprised if this doesn't work for you. I think the console message you got was simply stating that it could not locate the ProKit file in question. Installing the ProKit update will ensure that you have this file. 

ProApp Support 

This link is for Tiger 10.4 only not sure about 10.5 i've never used it but i'm sure you can find a link somewhere for an update 

http://support.apple.com/downloads/Pro_Application_Support_4_0_2 

ProKit Support 

http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/application_updates/prokit45.html 

After installing these I tried running Logic Pro 8 and voi la!! No more bouncing, gone activity. I'm really happy I fixed this i've been trying for months. There is very poor support when you try to google for this problem as well."
