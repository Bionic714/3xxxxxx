Jim Wagner produced this DVD in conjunction with one of the top knife manufacturers in the world - Boker, who also sponsors his Reality-Based Personal Protection Knife Survival courses in Germany. This DVD will take you step-by-step through the Jim Wagner Knife Disarm Rule; the same techniques he taught to Germany's top counterterrorist unit GSG9. It will also guide you through the 10 primary angles of attack (the Jim Wagner Metric Striking and Blocking Angles). What makes this DVD different from all his other knife related DVDs is Jim Wagner explaining all of the features of the Jim Wagner Reality-Based Blade, a tactical folding knife which he designed for Boker and currently sold throughout North America, South America, and Europe. This product in NTSC 1."
