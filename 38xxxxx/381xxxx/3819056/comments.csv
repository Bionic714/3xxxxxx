,anindya,2007-09-27T00:28Z,"No its not, you ASSHOLE.

Its a legit keygen by Core. It even has the Core10k.exe file using which you can verify the release."
,firhawk895,2007-09-27T12:39Z,"The keygen is not a virus! lol, are u from anti-piracy bastard!"
,merc_fan,2007-09-29T23:31Z,"Good stuff! Took a while to download because of the lack of seeders but got there in the end.

There's a load of folders that are zipped but all you have to do is open WinRAR and then go to the directory the zipped folders are in using WinRAR and then extract them all.

WinRAR will then extract all the files as normal files.

Hope that makes sense lol.

Oh yeah, the keygen is NOT a virus. It also has keys for every other Acronis product, like the old one that was made for True Image 10 Home.."
,od1od1,2007-09-30T23:58Z,"anyone who claims something is a virus/malware should HAVE to post the file to malware check sites (jotti for eg) and post results.  Or at least state file and detected as, by..

so many noobs.. grrr "
,kimera,2007-10-03T19:09Z,"Where is the keygen? After extracting all i have is this:

CORE.NFO
CORE.sfv
CORE10k.EXE
file_id.diz
setup.exe"
,acacapt,2007-10-04T05:36Z,"Kimera
That's probably because your AV THINKS the keygen is a virus; you'll have to disable it temporarely in order to run it. Just make sure the keygen checks out with the core10k.exe (either the included one or an older one, if you don't trust the included one). "
,kgprivacy,2007-10-04T17:27Z,"I had my AV up when i downloaded and it popped up telling me it was a worm. I ignored yet when i try to install i am asked for product registration #, but i have no file from which to derive info.

Do i have to redownload?
thx"
,kimera,2007-10-04T21:33Z,"Weird... if my antivirus has deleted the keygen it doesn't show up in the scan logs. Anyway, I downladed the other torrent (Acronis True Image Home.v11.0.0.802 + Key [App]) and worked just fine."
,phinix314,2010-02-24T20:15Z,"Ad-Aware anti-virus + anti-spyware (the purchased version) is an EXCELLENT security suite for anyone who uses software that the security community deems as ""harmful"". 

It doesn't automatically remove the culprit and it has very powerful configuration that allows you to tune program access to internet and such. I just set it to ignore files I know to be safe and I'm never bothered again. 

Sometimes, I've been able to bypass DRM with Ad-Aware alone (block the program from accessing internet and the DRM ignores your licensing). 

I hate it when I can't set my AV to ignore specific programs. So many things show up as malware nowadays... even things that are not related to piracy or anything harmful. "
