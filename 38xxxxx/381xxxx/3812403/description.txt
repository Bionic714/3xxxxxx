Description
-----------

This is direct digital capture of the raw MP2 stream from a BBC Radio 3 DAB 
(Digital Audio Broadcast) at a bit rate of 192Kbps. This was broadcast on 
Saturday 15 September 2007 22:30 - 0:00.

I have edited out the sections of the documentary program where copyrighted 
CDs were broadcast.  This capture contains only the live pieces as recorded 
at the Tramway in Glasgow, Scotland on 26th April 2007. The quality of this 
recording at source is excellent, and in my opinion this is not lost after 
compression to mpeg audio layer 2 and decompression to WAV for editing, 
then FLAC for lossless torrenting.

Sound : A+
