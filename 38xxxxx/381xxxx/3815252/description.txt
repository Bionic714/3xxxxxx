What is changed in London Heathrow V1.1?

- main buildings don┬┤t appear at once anymore. Now they are loaded "one after the other" to smoothen the approach/scenery loading 

- both texture sets (normal and HighRes) have been reworked to provide a smooth approach without stuttering and loading times during approach

- the high resolution textures should now also run on average systems 

- small update on the AFCAD file: Gates at T1 were corrected to match with AES 

- faster download: The file size of the downloadable full version decreased from 148 to 60 MB 

- blue runways changed to greyer ones.
