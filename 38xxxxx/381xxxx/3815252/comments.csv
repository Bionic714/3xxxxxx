,judasmyguide,2007-09-22T14:34Z,"Many thx!  Can i just install update, or do i have to uninstall v1.0 before I install this one?"
,caRLosAs,2007-09-22T16:32Z,"uninstall the 1.0, afaik this should be the full version"
,brgcat,2007-09-22T17:35Z,Thanks very much for the update!
,monsterdonster,2007-09-22T18:44Z,"hm,
doesn´t work for me. Uninstalled version 1.0 and installed 1.1. Everything seems to be fine, scenery registers himself at FS. But, it´s just not there. Aerosoft/London Heathrow2008 doesn´t even exist.
Same problem anywhere?"
,killamo,2007-09-23T10:02Z,Once again 4x-AXG: Your service is unbelievably. Thank you and have a nice Sunday

,Sambadelight,2007-10-01T13:36Z,Anyone have a norwegian manual for installation? :)
,Sambadelight,2007-10-01T15:15Z,"Found it out.. At first i didn't see the local settings folder. But after hours of stupid thinking it was as easy as show hidden files. 

I'm pretty sure that i am the only one who had to bother with this, but if there is a idiot like me out there, here you got the tip :)"

,islamk,2007-10-26T00:39Z,I just downloaded this..i did everything that was listed in the comments to install and get to run..but i just don't see the two files that i am suppose to see..even with the setting ..no hidden files
,FL280_DCP,2007-10-28T03:20Z,"This download only comes with the exe application to download Aerosoft Heathrow. Since there is no serial provided, I don't exactly recommend this download :-) "
,mikenude,2007-11-13T05:31Z,"Thanks 4X :)
Worked perfect!

For fuck sake people, read instructions!!!!
The two folders that are created are in {COA} etc, big filenames!

And if you have done EXACTLY what is in the instructions in the crack folder, you dont need a Serial etc!

** READ **"
,PCycO,2007-11-16T01:10Z,"4X, this was freely shared by me, which as you say is all you want. So please give credit, too!

,hejmeddig123,2007-11-26T10:01Z,hmmm I cant find the map.?
,AeZpen,2007-12-01T23:17Z,"Wanna make it the hell of a lot easier to get to the god damn fucking temp folder?
click START and RUN, type following: %temp%
why the fuck do u guys use the hardest way?"
,Dr.SoFtNaF,2008-01-13T22:00Z,"You don't need to any serial or email, it works without it, and it is so easy to crack the add-on,

1) go to this folder
C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp

2) clear everything, it will gives a critical errors b/c some other process is working with some files there and you cannot delete it, 

3) set up the London Heathrow 2008, choose a langage, then next, you will find where you must enter the email and password, here you have to go back to Temp folder which you opned first ""1)""

4) you will find 2 new folders, look at the second one, and search till you will find, ""ascrypt.dll"",

5) go to your download file crack, and copy from there ""ascrypt.dll"", and past it in the 2second folder in Temp ""4)"", replace the older one,

6) go back your set up, it still shown enter the email and password, now, click into next and it will start settuping the addon without any serial ;)

7) Have fun with full great scenery

8) Thanks to 4X-AXG to that great upload ;)

9) Thanks also to the greater one, Thepiratebay's Administrator for this website

10) Have someone clouds9 full to share it :d ?"
,patrioticparadox,2008-01-14T00:51Z,"or you can just follow the instructions in the crack folder. its quite simple and wont lead to any critical errors. this is a genius method. mad props to wildman.
the only step i would change to the above is dont delete eveything in the temp folder just have it open before you install (and scroll to the bottom of the folder) and its very easy to see the two new folders that are added when you start the installation continue from here to step 3
thanks 4x"
,777seven777,2008-01-16T19:06Z,"There are none hidden folders in 
Documents and Settings / User name / Local Settings / Temp  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????
Stop joking!!!!!!!!! just help!!!!!!!!!!!"
,777seven777,2008-01-17T14:14Z,"Wow! I've just found the solution of the problem!!!!!!!!!!
Information for everyone who can't find 2 necessary folders where you have to put in the crack.
1. Go to the C:\Temp
2. Copy ALL files and folders from C:\Temp\ into the folder you want (just to save them)
3. Delete ALL files and folders from C:\Temp\
4. Start LondonHethrow_2008.exe
5. Choose the language 
5. Program will want you to fill in serial number and e-mail
6. Copy the crack into the second folder that will appear in C:\Temp
7. You can continue the installation, press NEXT button 
 Happy flights!!!!!!!! Se you at Heathrow apron!!!!! :)"
,jimbob493,2008-01-30T02:10Z,777seven777: ur such a dumbass!! It took u ages to figure it out!!!! OMFG!!!!!
,airbusa350,2008-02-12T20:49Z,"Hi,

,airbusa350,2008-02-12T20:50Z,"777seven777, what called the 2nd folder?"
,airbusa350,2008-02-12T20:52Z,"And I have on my whole computer no file what is called: ascrypt.dll.
And I have to overwrite that file when i will crack it"
,andrespena70,2008-04-02T01:45Z,"I are trying to install the scenery on Windows Vista, never the less I cant find the folder in which the dll is supposed to be created. Any help please?

Thanks"
,el_kab0ng,2008-04-18T03:18Z,"Over installing or reinstalling this app does not work. It creates the texture files but not the scenery directory, hence it will not be loaded by FS and AES throws errors."
,el_kab0ng,2008-04-18T03:21Z,Guess I should have clarified: You must uninstall the previous version before re-install will work. This has to be done via control panel/add remove programs.
,fsix,2008-04-24T08:31Z,"This download works perfectly on windows XP . however when I used vista, the ascryptdll does not show up on the temp folders. anyone have the same problem? plz let me know if anyone got it to work on vista"
