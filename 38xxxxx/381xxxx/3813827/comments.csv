,yrjonpaa,2007-11-05T18:10Z,DOS - Only :/
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-11-22T12:27Z,"Uh, excuse me, Mr. yrjonpaa-n00b--the JFDuke3D port is for WINDOWS (though I dunno about Vista).  This setup will in fact NOT work with DOS, at all.

This game (by this setup) is to be played on Windows.

And you're welcome, dindgy11."

,Randal2,2008-02-16T21:44Z,"21.81 MiB

Not the full game"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2008-02-23T06:56Z,"*rolls eyes*  Try again, Randal2.  :I

This setup will play 100% of the Atomic Edition, and in OpenGL 3D-rendering.

Read the discription, that explains the file-size.  AGAIN, this IS the FULL game."

You're right though, some people should just be quiet untill they know what they're onabout.

Keep checking my pages here from time to time--I tend to special in rare stuff that's not already seeded ten-thousand times by ten-thousand others.

You're welcome."
