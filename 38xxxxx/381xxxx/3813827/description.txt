Duke Nukem 3D via the JFDuke3D port, v1.009.  Game data ('DUKE3D.GRP') taken from an original Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition CD-ROM.  Includes the original demos to be placed into your game fldr and the manual for the Atomic Edition of Duke Nukem 3D in .PDF.  Needs no update--this is the final version of the game and (so far) of the JFDuke3D port.

This is a re-distribution.  The previous release lacked the .PDF of the manual.  This release has it in the .ZIP.
