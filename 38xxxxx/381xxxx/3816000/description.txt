Question 4
OSHO,
WHY ARE THE INDIANS SO INTOLERANT AND SO MUCH ANGRY AT YOU?
..............
Once a sannyasin asked an Indian in a chai shop for information. He said, "Excuse me, where can I buy some shampoo?"
The chaiwalla said, "You are from which country?"
"Australia," said the sannyasin.
"America?" queried the Indian.
"Not America -- Australia!"
"England? Germany? Oh, yes... Germany people very good. You are married or single?"
"Not married," said the swami. "But where can I buy some shampoo?"
"What you want?"
"Shampoo!"
"For what you want this?"
"To wash my balls!" snapped the sannyasin. "What do you think?"
"Oh, oh yes," he said, "you are a tourist or you are coming for study?"
"l want to buy some shampoo!! Do you know where I can buy some?"
"What? What you want?"
"Shampoo!"
