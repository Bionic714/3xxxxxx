,stina.borjesson,2007-09-25T22:08Z,"Is this movie only 84 minutes? 
Because at IMDB it says the movie is 9 minutes.
I have downloade one Resident Evil Extinction yesterday (not this one) and that movie was 84 minutes, and got cut off after you saw all the ""bubble"" tanks right after she was on the phone saying, Im bringning some friends. Is it there it ends???? After ypu see the ""bubble"" tanks???

If it does I guess it must come a 4th resident evil cause that was just an evil ending :P"
