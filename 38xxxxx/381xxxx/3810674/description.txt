Krull - 1983, widescreen 704x304 XviD, 190kpbs 2ch audio

One of many unsung early 1980s fantasy, sci-fi and sword & sorcery movies notable for spectacular imagery and incredible orchestral soundtracks, Krull was panned by critics (who judge everything from a Citizen Kane "serious drama" template); however Krull now stands out as one of the best of the genre with its likeable heroes, and is also one of the greatest "date movies" of all time.
