,pegbundy,2007-09-29T01:18Z,mine stopped and my little green thingy turned dark red. It said in use by another something or other. I can only guess that it is a track from 20th century fox. Or it has something bad in it. I am using Peerguardian2 and it probably picked up on it. I can think of no other explanation. So beware. Let me know if I am wrong or right.
