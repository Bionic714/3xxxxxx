,mazca,2008-05-06T19:43Z,"Thanks a lot! I for one am happy to see more MP4 torrents around, it's a better format. "
,LoL_Sin,2008-05-11T04:06Z,"Took awhile for me to download had a lot of blocked peers. 2 of the CD's dont go onto Itunes but other than those 2 this is a great discography. Thanks, Ill keep seeding through the night."
,TCLP-Daniel,2008-08-06T09:04Z,"Nice Discography, I downloaded it with their new album, IF. Despite the slow download speed (10h43m, not at my max), it's a great up, and I was VERY surprised to find the SUPER rare song ""Bomb this Track"", a song that was only on their myspace for a week, and then gone forever. It also includes MSI, an album that only 800 copies were made of. I guess not anymore that it's not on the internet, eh? haha. thanks buddhaistic for the great up!"

[T],wazits,2008-09-07T21:23Z,".m4a Is An itune file. The easiest of any file type & most diversable unlike usless flac - ogg ect. If It Won't play on Your itunes player, You need to reinstall itunes or ADJUST your Settings. Simply Click On itunes player, Click On Edit, Click on Preferences, Select Advanced, HERE""S EVERYTHING YOU NEED!, Click on IMPORTING -[THIS GIVES YOU 4 Options - Or In Other Words, What Do You Want To Convert the File TO- Wav, Aiff, Applelosses, or MP3!!!, You Then Click On Mp3 Select Whatever You Want to Convert it to - ex.-16kbps Up To 320kbps and anything inbetween, Choose one, then OK. Next Click On Edit, Select All, When The Options Show Up Select Convert Selection to Whatever You Want. If You Convert to mp3 you simply click on itunes in your documents folder, click on itunes, click on itunes music, click on complilations, there is what you just converted, where it has .mp3, simply select properties, backspace 3 times or mp3 not the period and type in wma, click properties again, and apply and it'll play on windows media player, as as .wma file if you prefer. iTunes unlike your Media Player will also burn your files, just like they sound on your CD without leaving gaps between songs on gapless, CD's."
,xdarkxanarchyx,2008-10-31T22:25Z,"VLC Media Player will play just about every type of video and audio file you can think of and do a whole lot more. It's free and you can use it on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, BeOS and Syllable and maybe others.
www.videolan.org

For converting you can try MediaCoder. It works on Windows and Linux and Mac OS X with Wine. You can transcode between many different audio and video formats.

,swordfish815508,2008-11-12T22:27Z,Very Shitty You Have To Like MP4 Format In Order To Listen To This
,alienMOAC,2008-12-07T10:54Z,"so... in this discography why is 'Tight' missing? is it purely nonexistent except on my broken ipod? seriously, i cant even buy it! where do you find it?!"
,hikaricore,2009-01-06T01:15Z,"Wow some of you are fucking stupid.

Who cares what  format it's in?
Conversion is quite simple through a variety of software titles and tools... not tools like the lot of you by any means, these tools actually serve a purpose.

Some of you don't even belong on the interwebs I fucking swear."
,darkstar1987,2009-01-29T12:24Z,"thanks mate nice one

,spartacus91,2009-02-24T01:32Z,LIL JIMMY URINE!!!! woot
,psphackerowned,2009-03-07T01:03Z,why did you encode it to .mp4 format if its audio
,pcnoobwithexperience,2009-04-18T05:04Z,"motherfucking DUMBASSES...DAMN!! go download quicktime it fucking plays .mp4 format!!!! fuck off about it!!!

@ the fucktards who said albums were missing

,Pagan-Man,2009-06-22T00:13Z,psphackerowned: You're thinking of .m4a.
,Ksmittlez,2010-06-22T02:55Z,Pagan-Man: .m4a and .mp4 are the same file type just different extensions like .jpg and .jpeg.
,ganngg,2010-11-23T04:57Z,"mp4 is a video codec, which means it's bloated. furthermore, mp4 is a closed-source video codec and is not easily available for linux users. Rip audio as an audio format (mp3, ogg, flac), it's just easier."
,Jetlock,2011-01-16T00:35Z,"Fantastic, haven't listened to them since i was in middle school. I miss it.   Will be seeding 24/7"
,Danisl,2011-03-06T23:04Z,awsome!thanks dude ;)
,Rilriia,2011-03-31T03:12Z,"Thanks for the torrent! Found them through Burnout:Revenge, want to hear some more before buying the cds. (Too cheap these days not to...)

@pcnoobwithexperience . . . Whoa guy.... settle! Go get a bag of Doritos and some Cherry Vanilla Pepsi and find heaven."
,jadeddragoon,2011-04-24T01:20Z,"For the record, there is absolutely no difference between m4a and mp4 files.  They are, in fact the exact same format.  And while we are on the subject there is no such thing as an mp4 codec... mp4 splitter yes, but not codec.  It is nether an audio or a video format but rather a *container* format, like avi, mkv, ogg, mov, and many many others. It can contain video streams, audio streams, text streams (subtitles), images, and meta data.  It can contain any conceivable combination of the above (though meta data only would be somewhat useless).  In the case of the files here these are mp4 files containing AAC audio.  AAC audio is often billed as the successor to mp3.  It is the default format for Apple ITunes downloads, for example.

There is one issue though... most players *assume* that an mp4 file will contain a video stream... even if it doesn't... so many video players will associate with mp4 files even when you just want to play it in your favorite music player.  For this reason it is wise to always use m4a for files not containing video streams.  For the files here I simply renamed them.

Mp4 and ACC are both very well supported formats on everything from linux to playstation3 to droid phones to ipad to most newer ""mp3"" players."
,jadeddragoon,2011-04-24T01:28Z,"As for being able to play these files.  All you need is an mp4 splitter (for windows users).  Almost every player on the market already supports aac audio natively.  Most newer computers already have a built-in mp4 splitter and AAC codec as part of Windows Vista/7.  Those who don't can get Haali media splitter (which also works for mkv and ogg files).  If you still cant play it try installing ffdshow which will ensure you have codecs for AAC audio (and many many others).

Most modern Linux Distros also have native support for these formats and if not you can install said support with your distro's package manager.  The only issue with linux is that AAC does support DRM (all iTunes downloads come with this DRM)... and many open source licenses forbid the inclusion of support for DRM in applications licensed with or even distributed along side them.  So DRMed AAC files will be unplayable under linux unless you first strip the DRM from the files.  I might add the files in this torrent are not DRMed.

Hope that answers every ones questions.  For those who commonly have issues with getting their favorite player to play videos/music i suggest installing zoom player and running the auto-installer that pops up at the end of the main installation.  It will ensure your system has almost anything you could even need to play almost any file and even configures everything for you... you can then use whatever player you like (though zoom player is pretty nifty) so long as it uses directshow codecs and splitters (like most players on windows do)."
,christchex1024,2012-01-16T03:10Z,"great torrent, man. the only problem i have is that Alienating our Audience skips a lot like the cd was scratched. other than that, its really great."
