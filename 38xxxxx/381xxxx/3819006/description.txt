!T.O.O.H.! - Z teraria do kolumbaria [192kbps]

No tracklist or titles available for this :(

In October 1999 Humanoid and Schizoid went to the studio and recorded 10-songs debut CD "Z vyssi vule" ("From Higher Will"), which was released one year later and financed by themselves. Music on "From Higher Will" can be characterized as Psychopathic Grind/Death with a disturbing atmosphere. For the first time guitarist Humanoid presented himself as a vocalist, whose scream became another characteristic feature of the band (on demo-cassettes the vocalist was drummer Schizoid).

!T.O.O.H.! began to play live again as a duo with bass recorded on the CD. Responses to the debut CD were positive but the band couldn?t afford proper promotion and thus the CD was essentially unknown.

One year after releasing the record !T.O.O.H.! were offered a deal by new Czech labels Snuff prod. and Plazzma to record the second album. The brothers began to compose immediately after recording of the first album. In November 2002 Humanoid and Schizoid went to the recording studio Hacienda and recorded "Pod vládou bice" ("Under the Reign of the Whip") which was released in summer 2003. In the 10 new songs !T.O.O.H.! developed their originality. The album could be characterized as a Unique Grind/Death with Parasitic elements.

Responses to this CD were really excellent. In June 2003 !T.O.O.H.! recorded yet two new songs for prepared split-EP (still unreleased). In February 2004 came into the band the new member ? guitarist Wokis and two months later the bass player Freedom.

Soon after the band was contacted by Lee Barrett from Elitist/Earache. At the beginning of July the contract was signed and the third album is going to be recorded in February/March 2005.

The title of the Elitist/Earache debut will be: "Rád a trest" ("Order and Punishment").
