,WormGetsItsWings,2007-12-24T08:47Z,"Great film, it was what first introduced me to the concept of Jesus as myth, but what you see here is just the tip of the iceberg, the idea that Jesus was originally a mythical character goes much deeper than there is time for in this documentary, so anyone whose interest has been piqued by this, I encourage you to look into it further, such as books from a couple of the historians featured in this film (Richard Carrier, Robert Price, etc.), and also check out the Rational Response Squad and their Jesus Mythicist Campaign, Rook Hawkins has done quite a bit of research into the historical evidence for Jesus (or lack thereof). The truth is out there, and I think this is quite an important issue. After all, if there was no Christ, Christianity is kind of a moot point."
,spartan777,2008-02-16T07:37Z,"im pretty sceptical of both sides, the people who promote jesus as a historical figure, and those who promote jesus as a myth. both have a lot to gain by proving their point, so i find it hard to believe either side. this is despite me being an atheist, and obviously not believing in the bulk of the bible."

[T],IndianChristian,2008-11-02T03:36Z,"All these comments remind me of 2 verses from the Bible.

For the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many (Matthew Chapter 7)

And even though our gospel is veiled, it is veiled for those who are perishing, in whose case Satan has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they may not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. (2 Corinthians 4)

It is such opinions that increase my faith in the Bible. The Bible is right after all. Satan's main aim is to deny the Christ and for that he is prepared to do anything. The father of lies Satan just wants Christ out of your life using any method possible. Even if that includes making people think that there is no God or inciting Muslims to kill unbelievers by promising them sex bombs and rivers of wine in heaven or slowly replacing Jesus with Mary in worship and kicking Jesus out of Catholicism. Be careful of Satan & his way. He is out to get you. He does not want your money, not your wealth, not your fame....he just wants your soul. And he won't rest till he has got it.

You migtht think that denying God and living like animals with addictions to drugs, pornography, sex and violence is life. But that is precisely the script that Satan writes. You are just the actor, he is the director.

 People like you make me lol.

1.) There were many religions before Christianity and the Bible came along.

2.) Jesus's story is almost exactly like Horus's story. And many other religions stories share many similarities.

3.) If everything requires a creator, then the creator would require a creator. So who created the creator, and who created that creator and so on forever. You can say he just always was, but then he's no different than the Big bang (only with much less scientific evidence.)

4.) When you can tell me why you don't believe in all the other God's humanity has believed in, I will tell you why I do not believe in yours."

[T],IndianChristian,2009-08-28T00:58Z,"Most people here are hardly aware of what christianity is. Of course I cannot blame many of them. They just see the so called christians around and think that is christianity. Many christians today are hardly living as God wants them to live (as described in the Bible). No wonder Jesus talks of the narrow gate of heaven through which so few get through. Mate read the Bible to understand true Christianity. do not look at your christian neighbor and say that is christianity. If you have to answer an exam, do not look at your neigbors answer and say that is correct. Look at the textbook. That is the 100% correct answer. Your neigbors answer may or may not be correct. Christianity is about Grace - how Grace fulfills the law of God. Read the Bible to understand that and not at your christian neighbor.

I pity the atheists. They have no hope in the world. Just like a childless old couple they drag themselves through their daily chores...with no hope after death. And they want us to prove to them that god exists...sorry we won't oblidge.

You suggest that many do not know what Christianity is really about, that they get a bad taste from its adherents, but it is from those that propose to be ""Real Christians""(tm) that continues to do the job of creating spite against the religion.  What positive contributions have you made?  You come in hypocritically condemning people which then presents to everyone else that this is Christianity.

And not having 'gods' that have the head of animals was a no-brainer.  
You sure judge a lot for someone saying that Christians judge too much.  And every religion claims they are the only true one, except Hinduism which pretty much says no matter what you believe it's true - animals, whatever.  If you would spend time in honest study you would not have such what seems like hatred for Christians.  You sound like someone who has not done this honest searching.  You appear to be very judgemental and putting the actions or assumed intentions and actions of a few you have meet to the entire group.  That kind of sounds similar to racism.

Your arguments are completely delusional, and theoretically incorrect.
The argument that if you look at the other religions, and you should know which one is the 'true one' is completely small minded.
Just the shear fact during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, Christians had killed hundreds of thousands of people due to them thinking differently, and not following what they 'should follow', and disallowing the movement of technology.
Now that today, we have advanced further through technology, have more freedom, and have the ability to think for ourselves, Christianity is at a loss.
They don't have the same sense of control and power as they once originally had, thus they had to change their way of teaching.
So today, they now feed off this religion, as being this positive, smiley faced religion, giving people a message of self love, and importance.
Not to mention the fact that their is no evidence to prove that god exists. "

,Ykalondr,2012-07-01T14:18Z,"It is quite easy to become an atheist purely by reading the bible. The book says one thing in one place and the total opposite in another while still claiming the entirety is true. Like what was created first, man or beast? Genesis 1claims beasts before men while Genesis 2 says man before beast. So what is it? And how can you create light before you create a source of light? He created light one day and the sun and the moon the next, shouldn't it be the other way around?"
,GrimCube,2012-07-25T08:22Z,"I love it when xians claim ""Isn't it obvious which religion is real? Mine!"". The fact that there are hundreds of separate religions and within those religions, hundreds; sometimes thousands of sects which contrast each other. That only goes to show that IF there was a ""correct"" religion, mankind forgot what it was a LONG time ago and all of us are going to be punished.

Playing the ""religion game"" today is like playing the hidden ball trick with hundreds of cups and one ball. The fact that so many religions exist only goes to show that none of them are likely correct.

The turning point that made me Atheist was really looking into the way the bible was written. Many of the entries in the bible were written years after supposed events. There is no possible way each account remained accurate; yet there are millions of people who waste their lives relating to every passage. That's about as foolish as worshiping Mother Goose."
