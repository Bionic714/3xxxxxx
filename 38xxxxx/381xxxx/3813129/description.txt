CFF have released SenBit?s latest product Download Direct. This claims to be able to compete with other download managers (FlashGet, Internet Download Manager, etc.) and offer up to 500% speed increases. Try this one out if you are looking for an alternative download manager.

Download Direct (also known as DLD) was developed to accelerate your downloads by up to 500% (sometimes more) and let you manage them via one central screen. We wanted to ensure ease of use for the average home user with its simple, clean, great looking interface, but included features for even the most demanding, high usage internet users.

    * Accelerates downloads up to 500% (sometimes more)

    * Uses mirrors to find the fastest file location (achieves even more speed)
