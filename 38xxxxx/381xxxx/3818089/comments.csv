If you're going to download this make sure you're using PeerGuardian or something similar to reduce the risk of getting caught in the BSA's net."

,Furio65,2007-11-12T22:36Z,Better use TomTomHome to do this trick! That's legal.

,tellboy,2007-12-28T12:18Z,"downloaded this... now how to install? ive tried looking for same named files 2 swap, tried just copying 2 sd card, tried saving in sd card tomtom files.. no good   ANY IDEAS? cheers"
,ntek2,2008-06-15T21:20Z,its not pointless if you don't want TomTomHome installed on your computer.
,echoecho,2008-07-15T18:28Z,"Neo2001  BIG BIG thanks dude! I was screwed whe my SD card in my one died.  TOMTOM support is a joke. They told me to connect it to tomtom home and download the firmware - but the only reason I had a problem was because the firmware was corrupted! So home said I had no device connected!
It's incredible that this file is not available from Tomtom. They were no help at all!
You really saved the day mate, this is what the internet is all about - people helping people get information when corporations hold us to ransome. Nice one."
