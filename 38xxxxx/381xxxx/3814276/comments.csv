,DrChandra,2008-02-03T11:13Z,seems to work well. haven't checked for virus. the software itself appears to stink though. can't even import pdf files for edit among other bad things
,HurtByTheSun,2008-04-01T12:45Z,"Dr Chandra, the reason you can't edit PDF files in InDesign is because that's not what the software was designed to do.  You'd need Acrobat Professional for that.  InDesign is a cracking bit of kit and is fast becoming industry standard."
,Hednoize,2008-04-07T15:34Z,Yeah Winamp and Bulletproof Ftp Server stink too. Can't open pdf's with those either!
,moongod80,2008-07-18T22:39Z,is this working for anyone? can' t get the included serial to work?
