,pziglioli,2007-11-08T22:17Z,"Thanks a lot for this amazing DVD collection. I'm 32 and it brings back so many memories that I cannot even count them. At the same time, we can reevaluate these masterpieces and watch them in a much better quality than our old videotapes. Thanks again for your effort. You've made my life so much happier!"

Also, in the menu there is a preview of the second disk, as also another entry that says ' Inside Walt's story meetings'. I don't know if I'm unable to access them, or if they aren't there. Can someone explain this. If it isn't there can I download it elsewhere, can someone upload them?!

Regards,
Mukund."
