For the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many (Matthew Chapter 7)

And even though our gospel is veiled, it is veiled for those who are perishing, in whose case Satan has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they may not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. (2 Corinthians 4)

It is such opinions that increase my faith in the Bible. The Bible is right after all. Satan's main aim is to deny the Christ and for that he is prepared to do anything. The father of lies Satan just wants Christ out of your life using any method possible. Even if that includes making people think that there is no God or that Man is God or inciting Muslims to kill unbelievers by promising them sex bombs and rivers of wine in heaven or slowly replacing Jesus with Mary in worship and kicking Jesus out of Catholicism. Be careful of Satan & his way. He is out to get you. He does not want your money, not your wealth, not your fame....he just wants your soul. And he won't rest till he has got it.

You migtht think that denying God and living like animals with addictions to drugs, pornography, sex and violence is life. But that is precisely the script that Satan writes. You are just the actor, he is the director.

There is Heaven
There is a Hell
And there is a Choice. 

Choice is yours."

I just can't take something as fact without there being any proof. ie, the Bible. I could write a fictional story and in 2000 years people could treat it as fact.

And anybody that tries to convince everyone else that it's fact kinda annoys me. 

Then again, if christians didn't believe in an afterlife they wouldn't live their lives without pissing about and murdering people. And I wouldn't get woken up at 9am by people trying to convert me.

Personally, I don't care if there's anything after life, but since there's absolutely no proof for it at all, and almost all psychics that claim to talk to the dead have been proven fake then I'm pretty sure there isn't.

Just don't try and convince people that there is anything based on a 2000 year old book of children's stories."
,Demordio,2008-12-03T15:54Z,"There's not even good or bad, how come there is hell and heaven? This is all a invention for the stupid ones that cannot understand the meaning of life and try to simplify it on good and bad, when we all know there is no such thing."
,nsofast,2008-12-06T03:49Z,"and you indianchristian did not even watch five min of this 


these are exceptional ! loved every last min!!!"
,4204LYFE,2009-01-25T20:38Z,LOL! I can't believe the modern human beings actually believes stories and dreams from crazies 100s-1000s of years ago.  People need to think and reason things out before diving in to the theory of Christianity.
,descendfromgrace,2009-01-31T04:31Z,"of course IndianChristian is a good, god fearing person with tons of christian films and music uploaded to ""share""... it's not a sin if you do it? the theory of evolution gets a lot of heat from christian extremists who don't understand what theory means in a scientific context. the earth revolving around the sun is a theory as well and is also contradicted by the bible.  if religion makes YOU happy then good for YOU. keep it out of my face and away from OUR public schools. that is what sunday school is for. and just remeber that groups like the kkk and abortion clinic bombers worship the same god that you do. huh. a religious fringe group that wishes harm to non-believers and those who have different lifestyle choices...don't hear about those much these days. 


p.s. great torrent btw!!! And to all non-Americans an apology, our religious right is going kinda nuts at the moment. please disregard all insane, irrational, and asinine comments by both sides. we are in the teenager, cranky phase of our country. someday we will leave you alone to do what is best for you. i hope."
