,philsella,2007-09-20T19:56Z,"thanks citron,
It worked perfect on ultimate 32"
,zyphadiaz,2007-09-21T22:04Z,"does this really work?? cause I'd really hate to install vista one more time because of virus! I would be happy if there were some more people who wrote about this.... but so far it seems fine, but u never know..."
,NeaverY,2007-09-22T01:00Z,"Why don't it have computer Packard Bell?

,philsella,2007-09-23T00:08Z,I built my own computer I have used this program on 3 other pc that i have built amd and intel all i did was picked asus even tho none of them were asus i installed the key then activated then used the programs reboot and it activated the 3 pc's no prob...Thanks again citron it does work perfect
,ronjen090707,2007-09-23T05:19Z,"Dear Friends, after I rebooted following the activation, i came across this grub4dos thing. I get an error 17 or the bootmgr can't be found and my vista won't boot. Can anybody help. please?"
,philsella,2007-09-23T15:03Z,"put your vista disk in, boot from cd/dvd and repair after you hit repair you will get a choice what to repair I think Its the first option repair boot sector."
,wadad,2007-09-27T01:56Z,thank you citron... it works perfect on  vista ultimate 32 and was so easy to install.
,calzanetto,2007-10-01T02:09Z,When I restart my computer for booting the system I get this message: error23: Selected disk does not exist. I'am trying to exit the bootmgr but I dont know what to do. Can somone pleas help me!?
,philsella,2007-10-02T01:53Z,Did you try repairing the windows boot manager with the vista disk?
,calzanetto,2007-10-02T03:19Z,"No, because I do not have the Vista disck in my possession."
,philsella,2007-10-02T21:46Z,"To access the boot manager is usually f12.
I'v googled your problem and not much on error23.
Could it be hardware such as loose hard drive cables or hard drive itself.
all else i can say is borrow a disk any vista will do to repair boot manager its whats needed realy."
,n8h,2007-10-03T11:10Z,"works!
awesome upload.

calzanetto:
I had the same problem:
-Get a hold of the install CD (or download and burn it)
-Run boot repair
-go to other options and run DOS command
-go to the CD path (E:\ or something)
-open folder called boot or something
-Inside there is an executable maybe called bootfix.exe (I forgot exact name). Theres a help sub-command on this file (bootfix help)Follow it.
-type  the entire command as help directs
(something like: bootfix nt60 c: ).
-reboot

this way you won't have to mess with vistaloader or grub4dog. If you understand DOS it should be easy but still can't figure it out, post and I will get you the exact commands.

,sh0rt5cents,2007-11-06T04:29Z,Hey I installed a preactivated version of Vista Ultimate by Dell a few weeks ago and it ran beautifully for the past few weeks...I'm having a problem logging in now though...suddenly said my key was expired and won't let me access my D drive (OS Vista Ultimate). Anyone got any ideas on how to crack it without access to that drive? or anyone have ideas on getting another product key?
,MacSizzle,2007-11-07T13:34Z,"I""m running into the same problem as sh0rt5cents.  Activator doesn't seem to do anything now."
,MacSizzle,2007-11-07T13:35Z,I should also include that my PC does not have internet access right now.
,citr0n,2007-11-16T07:34Z,"this activator dont work so good with ACER computers .not on my new one anyway
before you activate look if you have a vista disc so you can repair if somthing gose wrong!

,Wapinabe,2008-02-14T21:22Z,Thanks A Lot
,LoveLord,2008-02-24T18:58Z,"This works..  Except one thing, when you fix it like n8h said to so you don't get all the text at the startup, you will have to reapply it to make it work again otherwise the OS will think its not registered.  It's a paint to have to watch it and may take a little longer but as long as it keeps it activated.  That's all that matters, and there isn't any viruses in it what so ever that I have found."
,glockmodel20,2008-03-01T17:03Z,TROJAN!!!!!   it works but there is 2 counts of TROJAN Virus by AVG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,perturesson,2008-08-10T11:29Z,"This worked for me....After trying a million different ones this worked so far. Only the first day. Once I pressed the activation buttons I had to wait about a minute before a pop up that said SERIAL ACTIVATED. Then reboot manually, NOT via the button in the application. Only ultimate, I have EN, RU version. Ill keep you updated if something happens"
