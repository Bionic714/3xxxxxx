A television studio debate in Australia, surrounding the broadcast of the UK documentary \"The Great Global Warming Swindle\". This debate was staged by the Australian public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, with the journalists and producers apparently under some pressure from a possibly right-wing pro-fossil-fuel management to broadcast the \"Swindle\" documentary.

The ensuing studio debate was heated and passionate, but generally civil and informative.
