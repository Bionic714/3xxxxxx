,ManUnited4Ever,2007-10-20T21:23Z,"You will have to burn the ISO to a physical CD, Daemon Tools or any other emulator will not work."
,bCg57,2007-11-07T05:04Z,"works great for me once i burned it to a CD, but how do i get online play working?"
,Nagashiro,2007-11-09T04:28Z,"Possible to play without CD if you mount it to a Virtual drive using some tools. Burning to a CD also can.

NOTE:This file is recommended to open it using POWERISO ....

Happy playing"

,diablogate,2009-03-21T17:16Z,I have an original legitimate disc and activation key but I bought in 1998 and I've never been able to successfully install or run it on WinXP.  I've only been able to install it on a virtual box but that's getting annoying.  Is this ISO one of the recent releases of the game that works on WinXP?
,nik9129,2011-02-27T15:39Z,online? if so do i have to download a keygen
