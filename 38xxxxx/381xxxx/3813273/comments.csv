,andoerjan,2007-11-18T23:44Z,"Cannot get this piece of art to start. Only thing that happens is a fault message: can't access folder?!
HELP!"
,gavin8or,2007-12-07T21:13Z,"This is the best DL ever! All praise be to decibell. High quality and rare/obscure! If you like road biking in the least, both these movies are a must have. Eddy Merckx is without a doubt the best road cyclist of all time, and one of the best athletes in the history of the earth, bar none. I will seed until it hurts!"
,nudrwho,2008-09-09T03:55Z,"The torrent downloaded just fine, but I have no sound.. I have tried a number of different players with the same results.."
,nudrwho,2008-09-09T04:05Z,The sound problem was just me .. I reinstalled  VLC and all is good.
,translucent1,2008-09-30T22:09Z,"I am using Vuse under linux, and cannot download this torrent.  The problem seems to be the "":"" in the torrent path name.  Does anyone know how to fix this?"
