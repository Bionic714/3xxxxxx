,bobspez,2010-01-02T18:47Z,"I haven't tried the Editor yet because I use Windows XP free Movie Maker, but the EZProducer 2.0 is awesome for burning DVD's. 
The DVDs burned from MPG II files work great,
both in DVD players attached to my TV's or on a PC, using Real Player.  The finished DVD's, which were shot with my Sony Digital 8 video camera, downloaded with the free Movie Maker, and converted to MPG II with the free AnySoft ""Any Video Converter"" are flawless!
Thanks you so much."
