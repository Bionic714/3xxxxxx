PLEASE DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!!"
,sheerliberation,2007-10-31T16:02Z,"OF course it gives false positives for malware.
The process for making a keygen is very similar 
to that of a virus. I highly doubt there is actual
malicious software within, but as the creator said,
if you don't trust it, don't download it."
,CriticalDesign,2007-11-01T01:13Z,"SanchoPanzar, this is not a load of games, he is advertising keygens."

,emonolith,2007-11-11T18:55Z,"Most of you guys are idiots. In order to make a keygen for anything you have to at least have the coding in the generation that sorta resembles that of a virus. And there's always false positives, ESPECIALLY with those kind of programs because they are trained to hack a series of numbers for your dumbasses favorite video games. Now, doesn't that behavior seem a bit relevant to what a virus does? If you don't trust it, don't DL it, and if you're dumb enough to think a keygenerator has ""safe"" coding and won't show up as a trojan on your computer...go take some computer courses."

,b0dyrem0ver,2007-11-23T01:39Z,"lol, what does it say in the title:
""Loads of game serials and keygens""

does NOT say:
""loads of games, serials and keygens""

and most keygens send antivirus apps wild.
why? it's been stated - false positives. not 
only that, many are added because antivirus
companies are asked to by the software 
providors to include them to stop their progs
being cracked. 

nice collection, NoOn3. ignore the idiots here. :)"

These are harmless trojans which you rremove with a click, or in most cases they are not even allowed to run.

Fact is, nearly every keygen will pop-up as a Trojan because of the simiklar way they operate. Whether you use them IS UP TO YOU FUCKHEADS! This guy (or girl no offence) has spent time putting this list together, more time than most of you have spent in TOTAL seeding. I'm sick of you whining shitheads.

,Captiosus,2008-03-21T17:54Z,"Nice!!! I needed a UT2K4 keygen cuz i have the game but the original keycode was used on my previous PC. THX!!!

PS To those dicks who dont understand PCs; if you think these ""viruses"" are bad, i can give you some REAL viruses, ones that hide in your BIOS chip. Lets see an AV program handle one of those! And Norton AV SUCKS. (friend of mine scanned his PC using Norton, EVERY .exe file was labeled some sort of malware.)"

Dropper.small  Can be found in the Catwoman .rar folder

Trojan.OnLineGames.aci  Can be found in the Caesar IV .rar folder


Im not trying to stir up trouble but im just trying to keep my pc safe (3 days ago it got slammed by 26 spyware programs)

These files are fairly low grade viruses used only to cause slowdowns, pranks, etc. nothing to be afraid of"
,Brovo196,2008-03-22T23:57Z,"I read all of these comments and my personal opinion is this one.
The Number of Seeders indicates that this torrent is SAFE if there was a SHITLOAD OF VIRUS'S then there would be very few, if any seeds.
Read up on pure facts, use the brain that god gave you, then you might have a small chance at life you eight year old fatass dumbass's."
,Brovo196,2008-03-23T00:01Z,"Oh ya and as a side note, Most antivirus's Don't even look for virus's anymore, they just look for Malicius Activity, AKA Something that even comes close to resembling a virus, AVG Sucks, Nortan Sucks.

PS: Try looking at the comments claiming there are virus's, almost all of them find different virus's, both in number and kind...hmmm...How ""Convienient"" Eh'."
,Brovo196,2008-03-23T00:03Z,"Sorry about number of comments, But ima leave this torrent up for a while, it's a good torrent, except for you morons who think that your so smart at computers networking and technology, well then, try tackling a techy course at any decent university."

I copied the files over to a friends computer and told him to analyze the files. He regularly makes viruses and rumor has it he has a rare military grade virus. He checked the two files and they were hot. so dont say that AVG sucks. maybe what YOU have for an AV program sucks. I also have a A+ and Cisco Certified stepdad behind me so dont think im just a wimp when it comes to viruses."

,Blunted_Wizard_Asshole,2008-11-18T08:46Z,"for all u fuckin idiots who didnt know,
keygens just about always come up as virus/keylog/spyware,
ESPECIALLY if u have avg or norton
and for the future
if it dosnt show as a virus/keylog/spyware now,
give a year or less and it will,
so dont shit urselfs,or rattle torrents with bullshit because u lack the common understanding of real bootleggers"
,edje89,2008-11-30T00:45Z,"great up no0n3

viruses are total harmless!!!!!

keygens are made to crack a game, 
a virus is made to `crack` a pc, 
NO WONDER YOUR PC DETECT THEM AS A VIRUS!!!!!"
,tobias1007,2009-01-21T23:05Z,there are no viruses.. keygens often throw up false positives so i perssonally wouldnt worry about it but you can never be too sure so scan it for yourselves if you dont agree.

,El Jafar,2009-07-11T14:05Z,"It is true keygens may alert antivirus programs, but they will not be listed as ""trojan"" or ""backdoor"". I say download this if you don't care if anyone else will be inside your computer."
,Pottu,2009-11-13T15:23Z,"You get what you get when you d-load cracked files. You just blindly hope its shit free. Some times it is, some times its not. Its free, might work or not. You know this you aint stupid. When ppl start to say ignore your virus program. Well... i only can say for me self. if my AV says its not safe. it will be removed untill i find files that my AV does not say anything about. its that simple.
gl there anyways "
