,raidensan,2011-01-15T08:46Z,"""How the West Was Won"" track order is terrible and I had to redo it by comparing to wikipedia's info. The files are incorrectly numbered and thus when brought into itunes will have to be fixed. The ""Box set's"" tracks are also horribly out of order but this time there are no numbers in the actual file name so itunes will randomly assign track numbers. A huge headache. Other than that great quality.

I only recently got an account so when I figure out how to post my own torrents I might have to fix this mess for others."
