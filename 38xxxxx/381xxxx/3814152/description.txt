ZoneAlarm? Outpost? Who needs them when you Jetico?s Personal Firewall. Well, thats what they would have you believe. Anyway, Personal Firewall is another firewall application for your home PC, and claims to be able to outperform ZoneAlarm and Outpost. I would probably stick with the tried and tested, but this might float your boat!
