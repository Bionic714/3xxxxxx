Death Piggy are generally referred to as GWAR before the costumes. Comprising of several members of GWAR, they merged with another local band, The Slave Pit. They formed in 1982 and were a small-time punk band in the Richmond, Virginia.

They flourished briefly and were then fully absorbed by GWAR in 1985/1986. They put out a few '45s (some limited to 301 copies) and had a small yet loyal following. They were also known to have played alongside the Butthole Surfers and the Dead Kennedys in their earlier years.


Included in this torrent is the Death Piggy compilation album "Smile or Die!" which contains all tracks from their singles, my personal favorite songs has to be "Bathtub In Space", "Boner" and "Joey Died Today". 

All tracks are in MP3 format (160 kbps). and as with all my MP3 torrents, all files are properly named & tagged.

Enjoy!


PS! This is rare stuff, so remember to SEED for as long as you possibly can!
