i see from the instructions it updates itself every 20 minutes, and that cannot be turned off

,knulfie,2008-01-31T16:24Z,"Hi, axeman0393...
It's not likley that something is going to happen to your computer because they are two different opertations systems on two different partitions so it should'nt be any problems...But if I were you I would uninstall Norton from XP...it really sucks and slows down your computer /kNuLfiE"

This definately looks like the best at time, but it's difficult to find any reviews, except from their own gloryfying talk :)
I'll post another comment when I've got rid of NOS ( f*ck Symantec ) and up'n'running..."
,bigdadrr,2008-02-22T17:09Z,"Update about the updating issue.  Seems to be working fine now, I can only assume by checking the update logs that this was a problem @ sophos, for the past 2 days it's had errors updating but occasionally it would update fine, now it's fine every time it tries.  The program is great, works perfect and I'd have to say the updating issues are not any kind of problem with the program itself.  Thanks knulfie"
,survivalist,2008-02-25T09:13Z,Why wont it install?
,deskafa,2008-02-25T15:12Z,gud
,nab90,2008-02-28T15:17Z,"2. review: Now run with Sophos and ZoneAlarm Pro... Seems to be a perfect combination! I recommend it at any time, and with PeerGuardian 2, everything is good...
Haven't detected any problem with the update as some writes, but the prg updates like every 15 min, which I atm are unable to turn off, but it doesn't uses much of the bandwidth...
NIce work :)"
