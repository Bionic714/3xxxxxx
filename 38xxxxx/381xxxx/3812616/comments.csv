Maybe you need a chip in your PS2, insert disc message youll get if you dont have a chip in your PS2."

Way to mislead potentially many, many people you jackass."
,--Pero--,2007-09-21T12:43Z,i heave a chip ! I buy burned games and can play ! but cant play my owen burned games TEKKEN 5....
,stiyjle,2007-09-21T20:21Z,You have to burn on the lowest possible speed. My discs get fucked up when i burn on anything higher than 2x. It could also be that the dvds you have bought arent compatible with your ps2.

Dont know what your problem is, but my ps2 have problem reading DVD +r. However it works as a charm with DVD -r. "

wasted my time"

,Slash558,2007-12-24T22:47Z,"If your PS2 is modded, region does NOT matter. When you boot into the disc swap program, just tell it to launch as PAL. Won't look as good as it would on a PAL television, but it will still run. Do your research before you whine."
