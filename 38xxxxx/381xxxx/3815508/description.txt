VA - Monologue is a result of a musical exploration of artists gathered around PsyGarden.Org community. The music itself is something between intelligence of IDM and broad range of different musical genres that can all be put under the name downtempo. Not so far from basic trance genre, VA - Monologue represents nice and easy flowing on scattered fields of abstraction turned into music. It ought to be fusion of sound and emotion...
