On the other hand, if you believe (wrongly) that ALL Dead Babies go to ""Heaven', then opposing abortion is contradictory.  If that unwanted baby grows up and turns against 'fundamental christianity' then your mission has failed.  Unless your a Satan helper."

,paxotrax,2007-09-23T09:07Z,I'm Not A Christian. Far From It But I Can't Believe How Much Viewing This Affected Me. Very Educational & Such A Shame That Such Heartless Practices Still Go On These Days...
,rowdy,2007-09-23T09:52Z,"Why are you capitalizing every word, paxotrax?

Abortions are OK, as long as they are applied at an early stage.  Imagine your 12 yr old daughter being raped, resulting in pregnancy.  I bet you would want an abortion for her, too.

Fuck, icminternational's torrents sucks ass.  Have them deleted, I don't mind a little cencorship."
,shoeshoe,2007-09-23T10:11Z,"Nah, I would say let the torrents stay. The people how are going to download this shit and believe it are the same people who are already conviced it's right anyway."
