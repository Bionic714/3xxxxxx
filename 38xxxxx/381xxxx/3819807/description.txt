This series transforms an old rust-bucket Range Rover into the ultimate older-crawling beauty!
In the first episode, Mark cleans off the grime off his donor car & checks the health of the mechanical parts. Meanwhile, in the regular feature, \'4x4 Extreme\', we see an extreme hybrid V8 car in off-road terrain.
