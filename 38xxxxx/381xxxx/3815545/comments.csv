,Xiloscent,2009-07-12T08:35Z,"yeah i have only one problem, every player i have says they need a codec for mpeg-4 or some crap, none of my players, Quicktime, and WMP9 don't want to play video, WMP9 atleast plays the audio. anyone know of something i could get/do that would be free?"
,Xiloscent,2009-07-12T08:43Z,"nvm i figured it out, for those with this issue, just use the real player"
,unitedhybrid,2009-08-21T10:07Z,"Or rather, use the K-Like codec pack. That's the standard for torrented movies."
