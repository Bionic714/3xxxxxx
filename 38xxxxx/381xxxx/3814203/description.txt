Mr. Bean takes a trip down memory lane, and it's hilarious even if it is just clips of Bean episodes!. I haven't seen this in a while, however i remember it being hilarious, as it was the 1st thing i ever saw of Mr. Bean, i am trying to track it down. Anyway it's basically just clips of Bean episodes, but if your a huge Bean fan like me, you won't mind seeing the clips, as Mr. Bean discovers stuff in the attic that reminds him of the crazy funny stuff he did, as i said i don't remember much but being a huge fan of Bean i decided to review it, and would love to see it again. i do remember one thing though, when he remembered about his car being squashed, he finds the lock in the attic, and he got that funny look of his on his face, just like the episode Back to school Mr. Bean!. If you love Bean See it right this instant, i in the meantime am going to try and track it down because i would love to see it again!.
