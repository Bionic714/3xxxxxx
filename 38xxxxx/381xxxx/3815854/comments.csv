,Tsenoh,2008-10-18T07:19Z,"EVERYONE THAT HAS TROUBLE READ HERE!!!!

Ok so i used to get that file missing error like i see everyone else is getting. They way i fixed that is i used powerISO and mounted the first cd. then i extracted the files onto a new folder *its at the top of the program*. Then go to the second CD and mount it and extract it to the same folder, and do the same for the third CD. 

If you are using Daemon tools, i think one way is to mount all three of the ISO at the same time, so that all of the data are present when installing. Hope that helps! :D"
