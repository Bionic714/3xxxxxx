,PirateWilmo,2007-09-26T19:58Z,"Who fucking cares! This is new, so try it out! One thing I can't stand is a whiner... You get this for free so don't be such a snob! FFS!"
,trakko_man,2007-09-26T20:02Z,"Right on, PirateWilmo! XD XD. it's probably in english, little fucker!"
,leomutt123,2007-09-26T22:55Z,Yeah zip it OverNight! But then a seed would be nice... :-O
,trakko_man,2007-09-26T23:11Z,Oh my god! can't anyone seed on this site? c'mon SEEED!!
,Theolondon,2007-09-27T08:52Z,"This is most probably a fake. No seed, and it is not on more serious gaming torrents sites (private).
So don't bother."
,malarieja,2007-09-27T11:34Z,"pirate wilmo is right, and so is theolondon. the game hasn't leaked yet. 
potiwilm is pulling our legs."
