I love torrenting. "

,pspaddict,2010-05-01T23:56Z,"Complete album. It's 192 bitrate. Thanks, uploader!"
,bigwigg001,2011-05-10T05:06Z,thx
,Jack_Raiden,2011-07-12T15:51Z,"Audio: MP3, Stereo, 192 Kbps (CBR)

Notes: Probably not a true 192 Kbps encode (e.g. transcoded from lower bitrate): Harsh 16 KHz frequency cutoff (typical of ~128 Kbps encodes). Still, a complete, decent release of a somewhat rarely shared album. Thanks MS, seeders.

@Edenian: Wow. Just... wow. GTFO."
