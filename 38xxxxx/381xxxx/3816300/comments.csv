,Soondead,2007-09-23T15:27Z,"painful_rectal_itch tror tydeligvis at invasjon er den beste form for kulturutveksling. Du er på en svensk server, lær deg svensk ;-)"

,N537JB,2007-09-24T15:37Z,"painful_rectal_itch. Why should we use US?(Hence, it's called English ffs). YOU are on a SWEDISH server. Learn it, or leave it."
,ilive4harleys,2007-09-26T09:38Z,"JonasBeaver do not lump all of us Americans in with that asshole painful rectal itch. That is not only his name..that is obviously his personality. We are on a Swedish server. If anything, we should learn to speak Swedish not the other way around. Besides, there are plenty of sites that will translate what is said. Try using your peabrain and Google a translation site and cut and paste. "
