In the 4th of Month of Jade, Cyndina Era 672, a coup de etat broke out in Foreland. To escape the assault, Princess Arita fled the castle. She ran screaming into the forest as her guards were killed by unknown assailants. When she exited the forest, she came upon a woman drawing her sword.

The woman, Pharis, was the strongest bounty hunter in history. It is rumored that she killed a dragon and is accompanied by Death. As Arita tried to ask Pharis for help, she bumped into her. This caused the land beneath them to give way and send them crashing off a cliff. While they were falling, a light swallowed them. They landed on the ground, but their souls had been exchanged. Pharis, now in Arita`s body, asked that she be allowed to protect the country as princess and Arita agreed. Now, the strongest and most cruel princess in history is born: Murder Princess.
