,beebop1,2008-05-15T08:57Z,The last episode doesn't have any subs with it. Kinda sucks to watch everything leading up to the conclusion and then to be left hanging

,spiegelnder,2011-07-10T00:54Z,"Yes the subtitles are just fine in all of them.

I have read beforehand the 2 manga volumes of this story and it is good and fun. I have also been looking for the anime for quite some time now but it is hardly available anywhere on the web. : /
The video is of really nice quality, but unfortunately the audio part is stratchy and makes it annoying to watch. Such a pitty. :[
I was wondering why is that? Is it a problem with the upload, or maybe something else? (I have been using GOM player to watch many kinds of video files and it usually plays flawlessly.)

Regardless, thanks for uploading it, mate!"
