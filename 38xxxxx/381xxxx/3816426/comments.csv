,Kulturgubbe,2007-09-23T14:44Z,"Yep. There is a testrelease of peerguardian for Vista. ItÂ´s released on the softwaresite Softpedia:
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Firewall/Peer-Guardian-Pr.shtml

It seems like this torrent is that one (havent downloaded and check though..)

BUT: This is a testrelease and it has some very serious bugs when used on a Vista-system.  That
is a thing I know for a fact due to extensive testing of Peerguardian 2 Rc1 test 2 for Vista...
Serious bugs discovered by me after testing it:
1: If you for an example install it and then update your Vista, it maybe not load and start at all :-(
2: A VERY SERIOUS BUG. I also have discovered
that peerguardian 2 rc1-test 2 (for Vista) sometimes from time to time STOP TO BLOCK IP:S in the loaded blocklists BUT STILL run and seems to block, but it doesnÂ´t. (THIS is something i have confirmed after testing)
