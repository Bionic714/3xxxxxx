new poster advertising the radical counter-gathering opposite the republican convention.
(don't get too excited democrats... a similar gathering to counter the other half of the business/war party will occur,.. i will likely make a poster for that as well.)
like minds who will seed this tiny file greatly appreciated!"
,mr.soul,2007-11-12T16:27Z,"hey man, nice posters but the spanish is wrong in most of them"
,sabotsabot,2007-11-14T06:27Z,"crap. when i first posted these i expicitly asked for feedback regarding the spanish.. and for 8 months, nothing. and so now i find out.. crap.
but thanks though, can you be specific? is any of it correct?"
,mr.soul,2007-11-14T08:46Z,"i'll write out corrections to the wrong sections of each poster


- Oaxaca:
Sรณlo el pueblo salvarรก al pueblo
Resistir para existir
Levรกntense, campesinos del mundo
Uniรณn para liberaciรณn


- Argentina (where i'm from :-P)
Piqueteros, nuestra lucha es suya
Fuera neoliberalismo
Fuera capitalismo

- the poster that says ""wto out, troops out"" etc
it's ColOmbia not columbia



peace"
,mr.soul,2007-11-14T08:48Z,"actually, in the argentina poster...""nuestra lucha es suya"" means our struggle is yours....is that what you meant to say? or did you mean your struggle is ours? in that case it would be ""su lucha es nuestra"""
,mr.soul,2007-11-14T08:49Z,"sorry meant to say ""su lucha es nuestra lucha"" "
,sabotsabot,2007-11-21T20:55Z,"thanks for these details. i am especially surprised at the oaxaca poster, all those slogans i lifted from indymedia photography and then approximated them in english.
so i am wondering,.. are they just not 'exact'.. or are they just gibberish? couldn't be. are regional differences possible? 
anyhow, thanks again.. i will have to come up with another procedure if i try to include some spanish."
,sabotsabot,2007-11-21T21:00Z,...and especially the colombia one....duh! ..how'd i miss that one?
