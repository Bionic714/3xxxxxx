
noticed my posters were no longer indexed, so here they are again.

34 posters (some multiples with compression differences.. so the hi-res could be printed slightly larger...but they are all pretty 'size-able')

(for more info on the subject matter for individual posters please click "files" above to see the list.. the titles are pretty comprehensive.)

and 1 anti-iraq-war mp3. about 7 minutes (fairly somber and reflective ... samuel barber's 'adagio for strings' on the underside,.. and overdubbed thoughts from cindy sheehan and other gold star mothers, some iraq vets, ray mcgovern, howard zinn, arundhati roy, and martin luther king jr.)(thats the riverside church MLK, 'beyond vietnam'... not the figment of MLK they have concocted for children and journalists.)
i made it about 3 years ago now,.. but as it turns out... still pretty 'current'.... if you have a radio show....(?)  or know someone who does....(?) or one of you 'youtube' geeks out there wanna use it as sound for a montage? have at it...anything... just dont make money dig?

(i too am a bit of a youtube geek.)

these posters are 'creative commons' or whatever.. do what you will with them!  wheatpaste? stickers? posters? t-shirts?  some unexpected ideas that could use some 'airtime'.

great then, be well all. thanks.
