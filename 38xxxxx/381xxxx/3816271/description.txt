In the begining of 2003 a group of friends, gathered around a psy trance music, comes to an idea of making a first Balkan psy trance community - PsyGarden.Org. As community grew, besides regular community members, also psy trance artists and producers joined the community. Those artists decided to make a compilation with help of PsyGarden crew and comunity members. As a result of that idea, PsyGarden label was created. This is the first release of PsyGarden.Org label, it consists of 2 CDs: Midnight Garden and Abstract Garden.
