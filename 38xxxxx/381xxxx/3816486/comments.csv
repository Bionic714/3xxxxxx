,majalogan,2007-10-27T05:38Z,"Awesome, awesome torrent! The original twilight zone is the best TV has ever been or will ever get. It is inconceivable that any of the money-hungry jocks that run the entertainment industry today would approve anything with even a remote hint of intelligence ... "
,afl2005,2007-11-12T11:15Z,"Thanks big time Rocktookmethere i was d/l this one from another site but thats since been shut down i think we all know which site that was.

Didnt think i was ever going to finish this massive d/l thanks again.

David from Australia you rock Rocktookmehere!! and so does the zone!!"
,Fair08,2007-12-15T14:04Z,"1-Thank you for this very nice torrent
2-All you guys downloading this, why are you being like that? At any given moment there are 5 to 15 peers online for this, all of them downloading and none of them uploading!! Usually at least... Is this stupid or am I over-reacting? It's never gonna finish if you keep this up, it's huge (28G). Why don't you try opening up your upload bandwidth for a week or two and I'll help too...."
,Numskull808,2008-02-02T08:54Z,BIG BIG THANKS for the UP.  Much appreciated. REMEMBER SEED!!!! 
,the_valliant,2008-02-12T11:37Z,"Great share!
But where are the seeders?
Am I too late?"
,nodge72,2008-03-06T23:30Z,It'll take a while to download - it took me about a month - but it is worth it.  The quality is great and all of the episodes in the original series are here.  I'll seed this whenever I can.
,MasterBate,2008-03-16T19:57Z,"OK, y'all... Stop all this HitN'Running!
We all have to take our share of the load, so please SEED after you have D/L!

At the moment, PB can identify 31 seeders and my tracker can identify 25, and all but 5 of them has closed their U/L.

I D/L'd another pack this big in a matter of hours, but with that few seeders, this one will take 7 WEEKS..."
,MasterBate,2008-03-17T22:17Z,"All of you who have D/L'd this torrent. Keep the torrent open as you watch the episodes!

You won't need your bandwith wile watching, but WE need it right now. It's a win-win situation!"

@Rocktookmehere

Thankyou very much for this great collection, and may I suggest that you try Utorrent instead, its the best client Ive found so far and it doesnt create any of those padding files(which Ive never seen before in ANY torrent Ive downloaded, and Ive downloaded alot)"
