The file originally was captured in MPGEg  using a TDT source but I compressed it in Real Video format (so now is about 1,45gb and quality is quite good). Language spoken during match is spanish.
Leo Messi played a great match as well as Abidal and Iniesta. I'm a F.C Barcelona as you can see. :-) Enjoy! 

Probably you will notice some stuttering with image and sound. My PC is quite slow and probably while I was working while watching the match some stuttering may occur.
