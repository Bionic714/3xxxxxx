Cult French sex-horror director Jean Rollin created this oddity in 1980. This one is a strange departure from his usual vampire-themed fare: In a strange future society, the residents of an apartment building suffer from collective amnesia and insanity, resulting in extreme sex and violence (a la David Cronenberg's SHIVERS and J.G. Ballard's novel HIGH RISE). A strange and interesting curiosity for those with a tolerance for gore.
