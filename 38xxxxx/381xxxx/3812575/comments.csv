,killyourself,2007-09-20T05:51Z,"Success! Cheers, I'll upload some more (lossless) in the next week or so."
,AlkalineRender,2007-09-20T16:44Z,"hey killyourself, good work! that's so weird about the other torrent.  but i'm glad you got this one up.  what other loss albums do you have that you'll put up?       

I plan to dish out some money for this CD when I get a job in October cuz I love these guys. They're super nice and they deserve it.  You all should do the same if you dig the album and have the money.  but for now, this is amazing.  lossless, it's like i have the real cd.

thanks again!"

,brandonjg85,2007-10-10T04:13Z,how do i convert from m4a to mp3? i downloaded a prog but it didn't work
,killyourself,2007-10-24T07:24Z,"brandonjg85, why would you even consider converting them to mp3? This is perfect audio quality. That all goes down that drain when you compress the files..."
