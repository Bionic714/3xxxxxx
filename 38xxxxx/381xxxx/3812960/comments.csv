,Lyph3,2007-09-20T18:28Z,"""This is a world struggle from all the oppressed people vs corporate imperialist america. TPB, Piratpartiet and others keep up the fight!""

Are you RETARDED?  

Feel oppressed?  Stop buying the shit that the corporations sell.

There's no struggle.  And it's not just American companies that want to make profit.  Look at Nintendo and Sony.  Look at ANY CORPORATION ANYWHERE."
