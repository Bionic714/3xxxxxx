MediaDefender-Defenders proudly presents the source code
that MediaDefender use.

The source is complete for their operations regarding
Kazaa, bittorrent, gnutella etc. This system is now
released for the public in order to identify the decoys
they set up.
A special thanks to the MD employee that gave this to us.
