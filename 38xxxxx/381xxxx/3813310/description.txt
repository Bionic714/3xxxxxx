This is the 4th episode of the 2005 Series One of Doctor Who, in Apple TV .m4v format, with English subtitles added and burned in. Unlike the others in this Doctor Who series created by 'dalekhound', this one could not be ripped by HandBrake on the Mac. Someone else's .avi rip was downloaded via BitTorrent and a subtitles file was then superimposed on the image when it was converted by QuickTime Pro to .m4v format. That is why this file is larger than the others in the series.
