,Ivan4ik,2007-12-15T23:04Z,Thanks for upload! This is one of the best anime's ive seen. But why there's no subs in ep 22?
,Ivan4ik,2007-12-16T00:03Z,"but there are bonus ""joke subs"" in ep 23"
,impulse9,2007-12-31T21:52Z,"There are 2 additional episodes not in this release.  Was annoying when I got to the end and it wasn't finished.  I repacked and added the last two episodes.  The first 25 are exactly the same and should work with new torrent.  So if you can, just grab the last 2 episodes from the new one until some seeders with more bandwidth start seeding

The new one is at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3955948/"
