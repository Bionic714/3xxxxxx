,snowbirds,2009-09-09T07:36Z,"Isn't it funny how if you die young you get idolized automatically?

For instance, SNL funnyman, John Belushi.  He is idolized as the hilarious comedian, but if you watch his stuff, it just doesn't seem that funny.  

Chris Farley on the other hand was flippin hilarious.  He is someone who died young, who is idolized, and deserves the praise.  

Keep on rockin Chris... and now make God laugh (and teach Belushi how to be funny)"
