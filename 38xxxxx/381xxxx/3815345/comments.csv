,Ola435345345,2007-10-27T16:02Z,Well I will get this and seed for a while since I have seeded a lot of this show before. Since I have Utorrent and can skip certain files It will appear that   IÂ´m a leecher since I just download the episodes. Get Utorrent to be able to see the files ypu download and to get full control of your choices.
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-05-21T11:21Z,"i dunno that the fuck was up with all the padding files, but they most definitely got unchecked. i only got season 7 and the movie from this torrent, and i'm going to rename them and re-up them because it just says ""S01E01"" and that's bullshit... i know it's season 7 episode one, but that's not Trailer Park Boys.. S1E1 should be properly titled ""I Fucking Miss Cory And Trevor."" 

That's That. Expect my up in about four days, because i am a very busy man.

Peace Out, Y'all"
,zweter,2008-06-24T16:39Z,Maybe Rocktookmehere can give us a little insight in how p2p networking works.. you upload a complete messed up torrent and then you advice to download it completely because you 'find' that it might otherwise slow down the proces ?
,Neutron407,2008-09-19T17:39Z,Great show for a CANADA tv show...
,mpasmith,2008-10-29T20:24Z,Thanks so much for this torrent!  I will keep seeding as much as I can when I get the whole thing :)
,bp42069,2008-12-14T03:20Z,"Thanks for this upload. I have seeded it through U-torrent for 11 weeks and 6 days, 101Gig. and a 5.535 ratio. I'll keep seeding it because I liked it so much.  ""Ricky: Why aren't you watching the dope plants, you asshole? Julian: Calm down Ricky, I'm just grabbing some take-out. Ricky: Take-out my ass, looks to me like you're on a date with cinnamon-roll-fuckin-head. """
,heatsketch,2008-12-25T06:17Z,"THIS DOES NOT HAVE EVERYTHING TRAILER PARK BOYS

IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL TRAILER PARK BOYS MOVIE FROM 1999, WHERE RICKY AND JULIAN ARE PET HITMEN AND THEY DO COKE, AND PATRICK ROACH (WHO PLAYS RANDY) IS IN IT TOO BUT HE PLAYS A DIFFERENT CHARACTER"
