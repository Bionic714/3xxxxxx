No. 12 AP ranked PSU Penn State Nittany Lions (Big Ten Conference) going into the season vs the unranked Buffalo Bulls (Mid-American Conference). Enjoy, and let me know if you find a way to grab unaltered HD files of my HR20-700... Also I need someone to test if this works on a PS3 and AppleTV. Stay tuned for PSU vs Michigan in 16:9 next week!

Enjoy! See my previous torrents for other PSU releases.

WE ARE ... PENN STATE!

cheers,
