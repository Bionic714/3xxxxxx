Help?"
,meaculpa85,2007-10-14T00:54Z,"To clarify, all of the downloads have come with only a image file and the Video TS folder (plus the files in it). 
There is no audio TS file."
,melfice26,2007-10-14T16:18Z,"The AUDIO_TS file on a dvd is always empty.
The audio is muxed together in the vob files in the VIDEO_TS folder.
Hope you understand now.
