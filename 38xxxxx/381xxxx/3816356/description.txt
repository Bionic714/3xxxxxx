2. Features

Wintools features the following tools:

Clean Uninstaller - This tool is used for both correctly removing 
software and for monitoring changes made to the hard drive, 
MS Windows registry and system files during program installations.

 When you uninstall different software, temporary files and files 
not deleted in the process of uninstallation often remain on the 
hard disk. These files are no longer used, they take up disk space 
and increase disk access times. With the help of the tool "Clean 
Uninstaller" you can solve that problem. You can also control the 
installation process of program, monitor installed files and changes 
made to the Windows registry system files during installation. 


Scan Files - This tool is used for periodic cleaning of your hard 
drive from dead references, junk and obsolete files produced by 
different software. These files and references remain on the hard 
disk and increase drive access time.

 When different programs are running, temporary files necessary for 
the proper functioning those programs are created on hard disk. 
Quite often these temporary files are not deleted. The temporary 
files remain on hard disk, occupy the space and sometimes slowing 
the work of your computer. The tool "Scan Files" is used for periodic 
cleaning of the computer from temporary and unused files. 


Scan Registry - This tool is used for periodic cleaning of the 
MS Windows registry from unused applications remained after 
uninstallation and from invalid references which decrease system 
speed and system loading time.

 Many programs store information about themselves in the Windows 
registry; these programs add new file extension associations and 
install components of their own. Far too often, the unistallation 
methods used by these programs fail to remove their information from 
the registry adding unnecessary bloat. After several series of 
installation/uninstallation, the Windows registry becomes bigger 
and bigger; computer power declines and program access times increase. 
The "Scan Registry" tool serves for periodic cleaning of the registry 
and for correcting incorrect registry records.


Start Up - This is a startup manager. This tool allows you to monitor, 
add, remove, enable and/or disable individual startup items. You can 
also adjust applications  initialized during the loading process of 
the operating system.

 Many programs "consider" themselves the most important programs in 
a system: they place themselves in startup and in a System Tray of 
a system. This leads to unreasonable using of system resources, of 
random access memory; and finally, to reducing processor power. As 
a rule, such programs write information about themselves not in the 
Start section of the "Startup" menu, but in the Windows registry without 
leaving the option to the user and complicating the process of checking 
the autothread process. The "Start Up" tool monitors all records about 
autothread and allows to delete/add and temporarily disable records. 


Tweak UI - This is a set of additional adjustments related to safety, 
system capacity and user preferences and which are not included into 
basic components of MS Windows.

 Adjustments are divided into six groups: 

Global - adjustments which allow for changing system files and 
registration information. 
Desktop ? a set of adjustments that can be made to the desktop. 
System ? system settings, ways of the loading of a system and devices. 
StartMenu ? a change of the interface of a Start menu. 
Security ? an adjustment of security of a system. 
Ctrl Panel ? a manager of the bars used for the administration of 
a system. 


Net Tweaker - tool is used for speed increasing of data transfer by 
changing hidden network settings. With equal speed connection on 
different computers different speed of data transfer is possible. 
The thing is TCP/IP is for transfer of packets of data. The packets 
can be of different degree of compression, of different size, time of 
life, can have different error repeats? That is why under different 
settings, equal speed of connection completely different speed of data 
transfer is possible. Changing settings with the help of "Net Tweak" 
tool you can get more stable work with bad connection(at the same time 
you can lose some speed) or you can get higher speed of data transfer 
with good connection at the expense of stability which will be 
provided by good connection line anyway.


The Privacy - This is a kit of tools which ensure your privacy and 
keep sensitive information secure.

While you are working on your computer the system monitors the so 
called "history" and saves it. All information about your work in 
the Internet - when and which sites you visited, of what content, 
which programs downloaded, with which documents you worked, which 
and whom you wrote, what you looked for, which folders you opened, 
what computers you connected to - all that and a lot of other 
information is left on your computer. Any person who has an access 
to your PC can easily access this information and monitor practically 
your every step. Besides he/she can collect compromising information 
about you. In that situation confidentiality can not be guaranteed. 
So much accessible information about you not only destroys your 
privacy but also slows down your computer. All this information is 
kept on your hard drive, in the system registry. Besides the history 
of started programs, history of the search, history of last opened 
documents is constantly loading by the system and "eats" RAM of 
your computer. "The Privacy" tool will let you work on the computer 
not leaving traces of your activities. It consists of three basic 
parts: "Objects to Erase", "Invisible Man" and "File Shredder".
