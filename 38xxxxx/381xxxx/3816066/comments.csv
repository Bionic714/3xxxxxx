,2forty,2007-10-26T14:08Z,"jesus, is this where hip hop is going. better turn that ship around and listen to some de la soul."
,supermegeme,2007-11-04T02:48Z,this is BS! we want non-censored shit damnit!
,thereusedpirate,2008-01-04T01:48Z,If you want some Nigga Rap listen to old school some DMX or Public Enemy
,grrrnola,2008-01-27T03:21Z,"higher quality than what i was able to find on gnutella network. thanks. people, don't comment about how you feel about the music.. if there's something good/bad with the up then you say something, go to amazon/hmv to post your reviews, not here. ;o)"
,torrent-cracker,2008-02-11T21:34Z,Thanks to y'all who wrote the album's censored. I was already finna download it.
[V],greenbud1969,2008-05-18T23:39Z,Soulja Boy sucks. Every song sounds the same just different words.  Hip hop is a joke. Rap needs to hung by a tree like other things were back in the good old days. Making millions of dollars for fucking shit music. This kind of music is dead and if it was up to me it would end for good. Burn it all !!!!!!!!
,faithie270,2008-06-06T16:57Z,"People, don't complain about what's uploaded here. What is here is free, so don't complain. No one ever forced you to download it, no one forced you to listen to it. If you want to complain, complain somewhere else."
,chdnolimits,2008-09-30T05:46Z,sure its ferre even if soulja boy gave me a free autographed aulbum i'd wipe my@$$ with it soulja boy gets waay too much airtime and his songs ar utter trash he sucks
