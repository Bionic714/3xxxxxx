Yeah, I know who natural elements ARE, not is, so what?  Why you come around with this condescending attitude when no one said anything to you to begin with?????  Go take your seat in the back of the class with the rest of the shit-throwers.   "

,stubaan,2008-12-06T09:34Z,"Folks, I am utterly hip hop ignorant. I just grew up in a country and environment where it never entered my life.  I have finally decided to sincerely explore hip hop, but discerning the utter bullshit from the genius is fucking impossible when you're clueless. So I decided to seek out a discerning torrent; a collection somebody would host simply because they were compelled to share their most badass and profound hip hop.

I have 12% of this bitch, and what I have is blowing my goddamn mind! For the love of fucking god, please will somebody seed this shit. You can just give us a taste then deny any more. Please. "
,vivalarevolucion,2009-01-09T05:02Z,"Please man seed, seed, seed this is a great torrent. Its a shame to see it go to waste. Seed and save the music"

THANKS!"
,MisplacedFate1313,2009-03-15T23:20Z,it'll take you about 2 days less of downloading time if you go on soulseek and get everything manually. but that would be the hard way right? Props to your taste... but it's hard to justify these huge torrents that will simply never survive....
,PearboyQQ,2009-05-08T20:55Z,"why zero seeders? blzachronj, you coming from syria or something ?"
