UPDATE April 22, 2009: I have decided to start seeding this again for a little while, I try to keep the computer on 24/7 though our internet likes to crap out on us randomly. I thank all the seeders who have kept this torrent alive.


This is a 3 month cartooning course by Lou Darvas, called "Draw Cartoons Today!"

It is a .pdf file, and is password protected.

Password is: cartooning

If you download, please seed.

I was looking for this torrent so I didn't have to pay for the darn thing, since there wasn't one, here you are. Enjoy.

P.S. For those interested in the Archie Sonic Comics, check out my new account Xzontar, it updates monthly with the new comics.
