video: 6/10
audio: 7/10"
,ahangmoda,2007-09-22T00:34Z,"Actual the uploader concentrate on the net speed more than movie quality and also it seems he upload this torrent for test if its work or not. 

the speed is great but you have to look a quality movies from now on..

Thanks "
,rogard,2007-09-22T08:51Z,"...more info on the source of your files, please...
DVDRIp? TS? CAM? Screener? R5? Which release group, etc, etc. If you got this from another release, please include their .nfo file next time. Give the torrent a meaningful name. If you unpacked an original release, ad [Unpacked] to the name.

(And be patient...)"

Are you sure it's a ""screener""?

I question your credibility as your rating contradicts your statement?"
