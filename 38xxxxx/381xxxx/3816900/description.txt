A statement from the Buckley estate insists: Jeff Buckley\'s death was not \"mysterious,\" related to drugs, alcohol, or suicide. We have a police report, a medical examiner\'s report, and an eye witness to prove that it was an accidental drowning, and that Mr. Buckley was in a good frame of mind prior to the accident.
