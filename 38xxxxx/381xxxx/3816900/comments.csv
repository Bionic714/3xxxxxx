,Godbluffer,2008-11-22T20:16Z,"@ratmusic.  It actually DOES get better than this.  This here is a rip of a 2005 re-issue of the album, using the Legacy Edition mastering, which was given a very subtle - and unnecessary - treble boost.  It was also made a bit louder, making it necessary to apply some dynamic compression at the loudest parts to not make the peaks clip.  I detected it at end of Mojo Pin, where the rise in volume is not quite as free as on the original 1994 CD.  I'd advise to look for that one."
