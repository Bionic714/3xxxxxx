Download at your own risk."
,No0n3,2007-09-22T19:25Z,"I have used this myself and it has nothing dangerous in it. I've used this crack for 6 months, and my computer is running like the day I bought it."
,No0n3,2007-09-22T19:39Z,"Scanned with VirusTotal, which I always use to scan the cracks and keygens that I download, and it looked no different than any other crack or keygen I've scanned (except for maybe one small difference)"
,ptr65,2007-09-22T20:14Z,"Sorry about this NoOn3. Scanned it with an ather program, and it turned out to be fine. By the way, this worked. I just updated my XP and it worked like a charm. Thanx..."
,No0n3,2007-09-22T20:25Z,No probs :D
,kamkim,2007-09-24T05:38Z,no0n3 for president.
,ryanh65,2007-09-27T04:08Z,I was wondering does this work for window XP Professional?
,No0n3,2007-09-27T16:29Z,"Don't know. I've only tested SP2, Home Edition. But try atleast :D"
,raptor550,2007-09-29T22:10Z,"Yeah it works with any XP version but you still need a valid key.  This only allows you to crack the genuine part or change your keys, need something to crack the 30 day activation thing."
,yrrol102,2007-10-03T00:04Z,this crack works fine thx
,sintax.era,2007-10-15T21:10Z,"I had tried that other one which changes the key and blocks wga and advertising with a hosts file change, and I still couldnt get thru microsofts website validation. I downloaded this, ran the magic reg key and viola! Everything passes. Im using Wesmosis PreSP3... which is also a great release :)"
