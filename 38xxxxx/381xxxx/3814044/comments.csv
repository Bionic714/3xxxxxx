,wasabizombie,2008-01-21T04:24Z,"There is a read me file in the CRACK folder that you guys /should've/ read.... 

""Zur Installation den beiliegenden Keygen verwenden.
 Falls, beim ersten Programmstart die Lizenz abgelaufen ist einfach ""Premiere.dll"" über
 das Original kopieren.""

Though, it doesn't really help you if you can't speak german... 

My translation: ""For the installation use the enclosed Keygen. If the first program license is expired, just simply copy ""premiere.dll"" over the original. 

Meaning if you get the ""Licensing for this product has expired."" notice, just do what it says up here. 

Go into Programs/Adobe or wherever you put it, and do a search for the 'premiere.dll' and copy OVER the original. But if you're a clumsy person  (much like I am) make a copy of the original and keep it stored where you might need it. 

Hopefully this'll solve the problems everyone seems to be having.

""ADOBE® Premiere® Pro 2.0 TRYOUT READ ME

Welcome to the Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0 software tryout. This tryout has been created to give you a preview of the features available in the retail version of Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0. This tryout includes all of the core features found in the full retail version with a few exceptions. The full retail version of the software provides additional functionality including HDV editing, final output to DVD, and output to MPEG-2. In addition, this trial version of the software includes only one DVD menu template and a limited set of Titler styles.""

Of course every thing that I need is NOT included. I couldn't burn DVD's. Other then that, if all you're looking for is an editing program, this is great. You can still export to avi and burn it onto a DVD with a different program.

i still have lots of troubles with premiere.. i got another version (2.0) from tpb.org and there it was the same like with this one!

i could manage the installation with the keygen and registration and other things some people have troubles with..
but then when it opens the programm and asks for new projekt or open an existing one .. after some seconds my computer CRASHES (is that the right english word for it?) and i get a blue screen for 1 second or less and the computer reboots..

i had the same problem with adobe prem 2.0 so i think its not because of the crack. but can anyone still help me!? i can send u the files which windows xp created while the crash..

i couldnt see something about sse2 - and i dont know what that is too

i will continue seeding for a while but it would be nice if u could give me a small hint!!"
,atalmus,2008-08-02T08:49Z,"Ok, I started off with a different version of this torrent (same name, but packaged into a mountable image), which took forever to install, but only managed to install the ""shared items"" and failed on installing Premiere itself.  Also, it was completely incapable of uninstalling the programs.  It never gave me any errors...it just said after the fact that it wasn't able to install.

Anyway, after trying viciously to remove the fragments of that shit-fest by hand, I downloaded this torrent to try again.  This one gives me an error stating that the install disk must be in drive D: before I can continue, so I put it on an image and mounted it to my virtual drive D:.  Now when I run setup, it just starts the installer and hangs at 4.76% and NEVER goes any further.  Again, it offers no error messages to explain this.

If anyone has any idea what the hell is up with this, I'd really appreciate some advice...thanks for taking the time to read my novel-length post."
,gaisare93,2008-08-12T18:50Z,It works perfectly for me. Remember to overwritten the old file called premiere.dll  with the new one from the crack folder. paste it to the map called Adobe Premiere Pro CS3 where the old file premiere.dll lies. Good luck

,Shetayit,2008-12-23T03:28Z,"All right...here's some help for those of you that seem to be plagued by problems.

The original serial number OP posted does no longer work...it's apparently blacklisted.

I did NOT input a serial number during installation.  Instead, what I did is after installation completed, I restarted my computer.  I copied the crack (premiere.dll) over to the correct folder:

C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Pro CS3

Replace the existing file with the crack.

Load Premiere.  Boom, no asking for a serial number, and everything works.  

For absolute proof that what I did works, once Premiere loads and you start a new project, go to the Help menu and see that the Registration, Activate, Deactivate and Updates menus are grayed out."

,jeenanrex,2009-04-03T13:33Z,"@trishel018 and general heads-up to all the downloaders...

I had the same problem as trishel018 had. 

Problem Description:

Installed properly, program started properly. But none of the buttons in the ""Welcome to Adobe Premiere Pro"" dialog will work, even the Help and Exit buttons. Only the 'X' - Close button works, which closes both the dialog and Premiere, which is pretty much useless...

Reason:

This glitch seems to be caused by the OS interface. For people using Vista, this problem seems to occur if Aero interface is enabled. Refer to this discussion in Adobe forums -

http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.59b76973

As for XP users (like me), the problem occurs if you are using certain (not all) visual styles in Windows Blinds. I am listing here, the visual styles that resulted in the above mentioned problem for me-

A Touch of Glass
A Touch of Glass 2
Aero Style Glass
Windows 7 Plus

Basically any Glassy visual style used with Windows Blinds will lead to the problem. :(

Solution:

Vista users - Disable Aero interface in Vista
XP users - Try using a non-glassy visual style in Windows blinds. Better yet, use native XP theme."
