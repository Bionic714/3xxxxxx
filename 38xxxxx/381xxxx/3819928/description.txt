The Colbert Report 2007.09.10 - 2007.09.20 (full two weeks)


NOTE: Yes, this is way late.  Yes, I was way busy.  No, there was no 9.17 show.  Yes, you can expect the next week or two to be as late.  Yes, I'm intentionally trying to come off as a dick to compensate for the guilt I feel for my neglectfulness.


1/3 the size, 1/1 the funny.  Perfect for those with low bandwidth, ipods, or the desire for a tidy archive.

NOTE: My method is the exact same as frantik's for the TDS packs, so if you've found those to be okay, these should work for you.
