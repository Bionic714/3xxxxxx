,Underworld,2007-10-07T13:22Z,Very nice thnx dude! 
,Remsan,2007-10-08T19:54Z,Something wrong ? Many files have 0 size...
,dsarosh,2007-10-18T08:38Z,"Found many, many fonts for PC to be 0 file size.
All the arial font familes are 0bytes."
,Erec,2007-10-25T10:47Z,Well. It was a good idea if the PC fonts actually exist..
,tk88,2007-10-30T12:07Z,"Does anyone know where I can get the font: ""Univers 39 Thin Ultra Condensed"" for free? I am not willing to spend $29 for one font. Any help helps! Thanks!"
,dsarosh,2007-11-12T08:54Z,"Well,
Dont download this."
,krapnek,2007-11-28T00:40Z,Use CrossFont to convert the Macintosh fonts to OTF so they can be read on a Windows PC.
,stuart0305,2007-12-24T16:42Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS !!!!!

its BS...they're empty. just got my hopes up and now I find they're either empty or corrupt.  damn it.  :("
,Omikron611,2008-01-08T08:33Z,this is goood :) and safe for download. scanned with zonealarm and nod32. thanks man :thumbup:
,Omikron611,2008-01-08T08:34Z,"and either if it is a fake, do you think that 57 seeders would seed it? i don't think so...
sry for a double post"
,Hot Rodny,2008-01-14T08:11Z,"Well...if this download works, i am VERY interested in finding out how i can install/use the fonts.
Which by the way is not recognized as fonts by win. It only says ""file"" as filetype in windows.

Maybe i've overlooked something here..."
,plumwd,2008-01-20T21:01Z,"This torrent works great, it's safe, downloads fast and contrary to what the comments say the files DO work.  As suggested get yourself a copy of CrossFont and convert the files that windows does not recognize.  Works like a charm."
,iizy,2008-01-28T19:09Z,okay i have downloaded this twice now and most of the files are all showing 0bytes in size im not sure if the mac files work or not but the win files are empty as many have said i also opened in hex editor to check to see if there is just corrupt content nothing not a single char blank file all it has is a name
,tier225,2008-02-03T21:52Z,Everything zero byte files .. as a mist to everything else ..
,faithie270,2008-02-04T15:25Z,"It's fine. Virus free. Scanned with Norton and AHn V3. Just that I need the font Insignia, and it's in this list but not in the downloads.:("
,brassbear,2008-02-12T21:48Z,"This download is NOT 'fine'. As many have said, most of the files have a name and 0kb. I have CrossFont. Doesn't make any difference. The fonts are not there. It would be nice if they were. I could certainly use them."
,wizkid69me,2008-03-03T03:17Z,"There seems to be a few fonts with issues in this package. I've imported up through F into FontBook on my MacBook Pro and so far 48 errors. They aren't all bad, but a few just won't work on a Mac."
,Art1e,2008-03-27T06:08Z,"Ok ive downloaded it but how do i get the fonts to work as i put them in my c drive font folder they appear to be damaged or corrupted,Any advice to get around this or anything to get them to work ?????"
,qwik3r2,2008-03-29T16:11Z,"After googling and searching here and everywhere else I have yet to still find an explanation of why fonts come up zero bytes in PC that I guess were intended for mac. I have taken fonts from work and they do the same thing, anyone have an explaionation for this? "
,Art1e,2008-03-31T20:39Z,"U have to find the fonts from with in the zip that work with your comp .ttf is the only font file type out of this that works for me,so to any others just see which file type works for u & extract only that type of file ."
,Karlzbad,2008-05-01T04:12Z,"Sucks that this is half empty including the one font I want out of it, bawdy, and this is the only torrent I can find that lists it."
,freakan_rican,2008-05-02T19:16Z,"Look!!!  All the HATERZ, ya got the NTS for free, why BITCH!!!  it has close to 700 PC fonts & the rest are MAC, get yourself ""Crossfont"" & stop bitchin'...  Workz GREAT for me, Good lookin' out Phopholipid!!!"
,James.Denholm,2008-05-04T04:33Z,"Excellent upload, and yet, it makes me not want to be an engineer. Even in TF2 ;D"
,James.Denholm,2008-05-04T04:33Z,"She-ite! Sorry, wrong thingy."
,rarowetzel,2008-05-14T11:08Z,Great download! Many thanks.
,ConnorMarc,2008-05-25T01:26Z,"Yeah, looks like all the PC fonts are 0 bytes. Well, if not all it might as well be all, cause how do you know which actually are there? Anyway, I'll take KrapNek's advice and get CrossFont and see if the conversions work. So if anyone knows where I can get Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk BE 1 fonts let me know. That's all I really downloaded this for anyway. Thanks."
,simelemon,2008-05-25T05:06Z,"HOW TO GET ALL THE FONTS TO WORK ON PC
------------------------------------------------------
(Yes, even thos with 0 kb)

- First download this torrent (duh!)
- Get/Install Crossfont
- Uncompress the file
- Copy the contents of the folder ""/__MACOSX/font-tastic"" to ""/font-tastic""
- Drag folders to Crossfont and ALL should work now"
,nonduc,2008-05-26T05:28Z,"Exellent share! :)
I?m on PC but I use StuffIt for conversion Mac files to .bins and I use FontLab for conversion Mac fonts to OT ones.
Don?t use CrossFont ? it?s allways messes glyphes, codepages and kern data. :( Use FontLab only!

Thanks to phospholipid VERY MUCH! :)"
,ParkAvenger,2008-08-11T03:38Z,"You, good sir, kick ass. Thanks a ton for this torrent, I've been looking for Blackmoor LET for a while now."
,XtopherX,2008-10-03T20:00Z,my whole system is having problems now after installing these fonts... Anyone know how to remove them from the mac in leopard?
,0liphant,2008-10-27T15:53Z,XtopherX: Oh dear. Did you install ALL of them at the same time? 
,toonman361,2008-10-29T16:35Z,Thanks so much. Great stuff. Linotype Fontexplorer X is excellent for loading and unloading fonts.
,gigfive,2008-11-16T00:24Z,"oh no..i'm searching for 
itc christophs quill...
anyone has seen it? heeelp! byz"
,Wilthain,2008-11-17T02:09Z,"Does anyone have ""Super Grotesk"" font? Not the Berliner or Akzidenz Grotesk remakes but the original like the FF foundry has."
,jordanwb,2008-12-02T20:18Z,"You sir, are awesome. I was looking for the ITC Zapf Chancery font and I didn't want to pay for it."
,jordanwb,2008-12-02T21:35Z,I wish those idiots at Apple would stop reinventing the wheel. I downloaded CrossFont and it gives no help to convert the ITC Zapf Chancery fonts to something usable.
,jordanwb,2008-12-02T21:47Z,Thanks simelemon now it works.
,shrapnelhunter,2008-12-05T18:08Z,I wanted one font from this. Thanks for making it impossible.
,jordanwb,2008-12-07T00:33Z,"shrapnelhunter, its not exactly impossible just really really hard and annoying. I was able to convert all but a few fonts."
,felisgris,2009-01-11T18:32Z,"Thanks for this.  I recently did a reinstall and forgot to save a backup of my installed fonts.  DUH!  Because I am in the middle of publishing thiings that use them.  I needed BlackOak Std which is, like, $44 and I won't make that much offf my book.  
I also found that most of the Windows fonts did not work  and that Crossfont was useless.  So I got Fontlab here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3400397/Fontlab_Studio_v5.0.0_(Retail)___patch and ran it, opened Blackoak and saved it as Blackoak2, and it installed perfectly.  So thank you very much phospholid, and thanks to everyone who sorted the prolems with this torrent."
,arienh4,2009-01-13T13:15Z,"I converted them all to Windows fonts if anyone's interested. Also put them in as single files, not as a zip.

,Kurachigo,2009-01-21T05:16Z,"@XtopherX
just  open ur font book and delete them"
,Koyangi,2009-02-20T06:40Z,"Though I do have to use CrossFonts every time I need to use a font out of the list, it's so quick and simple to convert the files that I wouldn't consider it a problem. As a graphic design major in dire need of expanding my font library, this torrent is godsend. Thanks for the upload, phospholid."
,cocheese79,2009-02-26T00:06Z,Didn't work for me 
,GhostFaceZero,2009-03-10T00:32Z,"First off - thanks! Fantastic collection.

Although user be informed, 90% of these fonts are compressed in .zip files that contain yet another .rar file to un-compress. Many of which turn out to be un-usable on mac.

Once opened, use a font manager - my favorite is FontDoctor first (to scan, repair and organize) then Suitcase Fusion. Activate only fonts you want to use at the time, this will keep your system running smooth and avoid Adobe crashes.

Thanks phospholipid, there are many great fonts here, great work."
,kiman1,2009-03-31T00:18Z,"Hej, Kan ni hj채lpa mig med PL Bernhardt Bold fonts? jag har stort behov av det. Tack!"
,D34C0N,2009-03-31T09:35Z,"NiftyFonts? CrapFonts is more like it. What an absolutely jacked up, ridiculous torrent. I hate having to fight with random strangeness just to get at something as simple as a font. And then some people continue shouting that as long as it doesn't cost you directly in your nation's currency, then it can be as shoddy and half-assed as anything else on the net, and you shouldn't complain or have any standards.

@arienh4 That torrent is 404 not found. It would be a magnificent thing to behold. I'd seed."
,kilo223,2009-04-18T04:57Z,"D34C0N how much you pay for this fonts ? NOTHING! so shut up! . 


thx for the torrent . u hv more fonts ? xD "
,mj0428,2009-05-01T07:52Z,"So when you download these, what folder should you put them in or whatever?"
,Doc Lithius,2009-07-07T15:13Z,"Nrrgh...  Why do people INSIST on compiling shit into ONE or TWO BIG COMPRESSED DIRECTORIES?  Can't people like...ya know...do the smart thing and upload torrents with DIRECTORIES in them so people can pick and choose the files they want?  All I want from this collection is maybe one or two fonts.  NOT 5,000 FUCKING FONTS.  What would I do with 5,000 god damned fonts?!  Shove 'em up my ASS?"
,Doc Lithius,2009-07-13T21:40Z,"Yeah, sorry...  This torrent?  It's bullshit.  Utter bullshit.  Of the 4,966 font families tossed up in the Windows directory of the massive ZIP file, only 689 of them actually HAD ANY DATA IN THEM.  And of those 689 font families, I have no idea how many actually WORKED.

Pass on this torrent folks.  Most of the USEFUL fonts (if not ALL of them) aren't here.  INCLUDING the three I actually WANTED."
,gsg12,2009-07-20T23:47Z,Doc Lithius I'm right there with you.  One font.  Just one god damn font and when I finally have the opportunity to extract the 5000 fonts (which why would anyone want so many in the first fucking place?) only to find that there is no data.  Phospholipid just wasted a good hour of my life.  
,uroba,2009-10-08T00:36Z,"Guys, almost all of these fonts are for Mac only. Yes, Apple is annoying that way. 

If you have a friend with a Mac, get them to download this and make zip files of the fonts that you want on their Mac, and then you can use the software CrossFont to convert them into Windows compatible formats."
,mattguy,2011-02-14T18:49Z,"This torrent is brilliant. Love it.

If you're a PC idiot and don't know why, or care why, this is a very useful torrent, then just go back to stacking your system with a bunch of app/packages you'll never use in any practical way.  Leave digital creativity to those that appreciate it.

Also, consider this:  The world doesn't revolve around your 16 year old universe."
