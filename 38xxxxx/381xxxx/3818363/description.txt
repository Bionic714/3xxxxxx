Ziperello is a program to recover lost or forgotten passwords to zip archives.

Have you ever used encrypted zip archives? Perhaps you received such kind of files with important data from your business partner by e-mail or may be you keep data in encrypted zip archives to prevent an illegal access.

If so, then you happened probably to forget or to be incapable to find a password to one of these zip files. It becomes a more trouble if you need files stored in the archive immediately.

This is not a problem any more!
