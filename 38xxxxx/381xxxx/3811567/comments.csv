,dannjoeh,2007-11-13T22:40Z,"follow this step to activv your maya unlimited

create a folder in drive [C:] and name it FLEXLM
it should look like this > C:\FLEXLM
copy en paste the aw.dat en awkeygen.exe inside that forlder...
to generate for keygen you must get your ethernet address to do this go to start\all programs\autodesk\common utilities\FlexLM License Utilities.

under the system setting copy your ethernet address then go to your aw.dat file in FLEXLM folder open it with wordPad then edit the word ""your host"" by your ethernet address... close en then save... next is click en drag the aw.dat file over the awkeygen.exe then boom it generate for your own license then use this aw.file as your license go to start\all prog\autodesk\Autodesk Maya 2008\licensing\select ""i have a license that i need to install click ""next"" \ select i would like to install my lisence from a file hit next then browse your aw.dat file from FLEXLM folder then click next install then caboom!!! open maya and enjoy

,BullittPr00f,2007-11-28T16:49Z,could anyone plz tell me how to change the install destination so i could for example have it n D:\ since i dont have room for it on C:\ 
,darknesswalker,2007-12-09T13:35Z,"The Syntax portion on the aw.dat is messed up after you place your ethernet part.

The Keygen messes up the syntax and you cannot unlock maya when its comes time for you to import the license.

Marking this torrent as -=BAD=-, please someone upload a working version of MAYA 2008 64 bit, ASAP!

I will seed for a full day !
Please guys hurry!"
,darknesswalker,2007-12-10T02:40Z,"Alright guys 


LISTEN UP!!!!!!!!!!

This Torrent Works, I really needed Maya 2008 so I was REALLY STRUGGLING to get the 64 bit version to work since I got a new computer.

I did some research with the 32 bit version of the torrent and I found this.

FOLLOW THIS STEPS BY THE LETTER. The Torrent work, the problem is HOW it is HOW it is told to you.

The Syntax File WILL FAIL its normal. Credit goes to Wiggy2K7, you saved my skin bro!

THIS ARE THE CORRECT INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!!!!


Its alright ive sussed it.... The install text with this download does not work. Install it like this:

1. First Create a directory on the c: drive (even if you install maya on different drive) called
FLEXLM
2. Copy the aw.dat and awkeygen.exe file to this directory.
3. Install Maya
4. Goto start-->all programs-->Autodesk-->common utilities-->FlexLM license utilities
5. Under system settings copy Ethernet address
6. Open the file (from the directory FLEXLM) aw.dat with Wordpad and replace the words ""your host""
with the copied Ethernet address. Save and close Notepad.
7. Select run from the start menu & type cmd
8. Type cd\ and then press enter
9. Type cd flexlm and press enter
10. Type awkeygen aw.dat and press enter "
,himedia1,2007-12-12T07:01Z,none of these solutions work.  Don't waste your time on this.  cd\ ? COME ON!
,himedia1,2007-12-12T07:05Z,"i have personally downloaded each of these..(maya's)  NONE OF THEM ACTUALLY WORK.   TRUST ME. I'm VERY good at following instructions, installation, rar, iso, uif, daa, bin, cue, etc."
,gummibear31,2007-12-15T16:26Z,"try replacing the first line where it reads:
FEATURE MayaUnltd sgiawd 2008 permanent uncounted 0 \
with
FEATURE MayaUnltd sgiawd 2008.000 permanent uncounted 0 \
and then run the keygen"
,Portuquese,2007-12-16T16:52Z,"I installed the file and followed the instructions to the letter and the tools and the right click are grayed out or not appearing, can anyone help."
,Pred2040,2007-12-28T20:52Z,"Hello,

darknesswalker's directions are correct, just make sure that you don't have the quotes in the HostID.  Also, after you run the ""awkeygen.exe aw.dat"" in the command prompt, open the ""aw.dat"" file back up and delete everything above the ""FEATURE"" line.

Hope this helps."
,1morelia,2008-01-10T10:34Z,"Do I need to burn it to a CD or can I run it from the file itself, because of darknesswalker's directions:

7. Select run from the start menu & type cmd
8. Type cd\ and then press enter
9. Type cd flexlm and press enter"
,djar007,2008-01-17T07:29Z,I had trouble also.But I followed the instructions here and got it to work. I think the big thing is after editing dat file go back and delete the lines. That helped. so thanks a lot... now how do i use this... lol
,tenchimuyo,2008-01-25T15:16Z,"RE: 2 Ethernet addresses

I've looked in ipconfig/all and I have 2 ethernet/physical addresses?! Either one won't work. Has anyone had this problem? Which one did you choose to make it work? Did you disable a port???? 

any help's appreciated! "
,cronahi,2008-01-31T00:23Z,"The hell, it works!!
Listen carefully
1. First Create a directory on the c: drive (even if 
you install maya on different drive) called
FLEXLM
2. Copy the aw.dat and awkeygen.exe file to this directory.
3. Install Maya
4. Goto start-->all programs-->Autodesk-->common utilities-->FlexLM license utilities
5. Under system settings copy Ethernet address
(make sure its the right one, i got it wrong the first few times but i figured it, it should look something like: 010ba556dae7)


6. Open the file (from the directory FLEXLM) aw.dat with Wordpad and replace the words ""your host""
with the copied Ethernet address. Save and close Notepad.
7. Select run dos prompt
8. Type cd c:\ and then press enter
9. Type cd flexlm and press enter
10. Type awkeygen aw.dat and press enter

Now that file should be ready

Now:

Goto start-->all programs-->Autodesk-->Autodesk Maya 2008-->Licensing
    select ""I have a license that I need to install-->I would like to install license from a file""

Browse to the path of the file aw.dat and select it.

Now the setup ask where to put its own licence file just name it aw1.dat and save it in the same dir as aw.dat.

THATS HOW IT WORKED FOR ME, i hope it helps  u guys allong."
,korry,2008-02-04T19:59Z,"does this version have the ""mental ray shader node""?"
,plconnors,2008-02-14T00:07Z,Does anyone know how to do the install on a Mac?  Is it even possible?  Thanks.

,Headshot9,2008-06-29T06:06Z,"how do i get this file to work i cant find the files your talking about the aw.dat or awkeygen only the read me and the autodesk maya this, other then that its empty do i need anouther program to get them?"
,js1438,2008-08-01T20:05Z,"Took me freaking forever, but i figured it out. If you still cant get, just ask me and I will try my best to help."
,js1438,2008-08-01T20:10Z,"Everything these guys are saying, is correct. Its just they arent making any sense with the directions. If you have two Ethernet address, best advice is to try each one. Don't be an idiot like me and use both at one time cause it doesnt work like that. You DO NOT need to change the top line in aw.dat, but once you have entered the correct Ethernet address, you then save it as a .dat file then DRAG over awkeygen.exe. Give it a second and a new aw.dat will be born. When you go into Maya Licensing, choose that file within the FLEXLM folder. Then presto! If that still does'nt work, let me know!"

Anybody tell me?!"
,arseface1985,2008-11-13T05:16Z,"Well... I was having a lot of trouble trying to activate this too...
at FlexLM License Utility I was getting for my Ethernet this kind of number: 0015af237f3d 001bfcedbe53 001bfcedbde0

The number will change from computer to computer, but it was that long...
I tried everything: adding ""-"" between the number groups, adding "":"", removing the spaces... but it would generate an ""wrong syntax"" or ""invalid parameter"" error in every attempt.

So, if you are experiencing the same problem as mine, try the following:

1) go to run and type ""cmd"".
2) in the prompt, type ""cd\""
3) type ""getmac /v""

a short list of your conections will show up, with a bunch of numbers, some of them will look like the one displayed in the FlexLM License, for they are as big as the one that showed up. 

BUT thats the trick: do not use none of them, instead use the shorter ones that comes before the long ones. They will appear in this kind of syntax: ""00-00-00-00-00-00"" using letters and numbers.

copy this fella (you gotta chose wich one is from your active conection I think, but thats ok, I just got 3 of these in my attempt, and the first one was the correct) to your aw.dat and replace the ""your_host"" with it (don't forget to remove the ""-"", so that the number will be in this syntax: ""0000000000"", a 10 digit number and, of course, without the quotes).

Now you can do the mumbo jumbo described above or simply drag the aw.dat to your keygen... and VOILA. install the license and go get yourself a beer.

At least it worket for me.

Hope I have helped."
,fuzzmonkey,2008-11-18T07:22Z,"I just wanted to thank you for uploading this. It installed easily and works perfectly.

Every time someone ups a version of Maya, the comments are full of retards saying ?this doesn?t work?, ?bad torrent? or some other bullshit like ?how I install?!?!?.

I mean damn it people it?s just not that hard! 
If you can?t even get this to work, I?d love to see you work with a complex shader network."

The key was going through the cmd prompt and getting the crack to work properly. 

SO hopefully, I'll use this program more now that I have it. Been using MAX since version 1, and well...it's got some limitations I'd like to shed.
