,Freakzilla79,2007-09-21T05:09Z,Did I miss that rule also!! Everytime I release something you put a link up.. Why is that?? Where do you think I get most of the info from???
,Gastromix,2007-09-21T07:03Z,ItÂ´s good that he put up a link so we can get more info or pictures on the movie so we get to know more about the movie.
,Freakzilla79,2007-09-21T14:52Z,Sorry!! Didn't even think about that. Had a bad day yesterday!
