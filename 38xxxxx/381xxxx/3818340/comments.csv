,rogard,2007-09-25T07:52Z,A 124 min film in 334MiB? How does that look like?!
,rogard,2007-09-25T07:54Z,"...probably like ""320x240"" Nice for your ipod, I guess.

...not so ""clean"" picture, and a rather ""sober""ing experience. ;-)"
,tuberok,2007-09-27T04:02Z,"Sorry 'bout the goof on the title folks! :) Yes, it is ""Clean & Sober"" & yes, it is intended for portable xvid devices, which, unfortunately, the ipod video isn't compatible with.

*sigh*

,tuberok,2007-09-27T04:40Z,"PS:  The quality is pretty good even for 320x240.  It's great for portable dvd players, smartphones, pda's & other portable devices that support the xvid format.  I'd say it's about vhs extended play quality if you play it back on a tv or computer screen."
,tuberok,2007-09-27T04:43Z,pps:  it's also available in ~ 885mb format if  you prefer better quality and don't mind the extra size and download time.  just click on 'tuberok' above if you want to find that version.
