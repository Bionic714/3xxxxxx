I have been enjoying many of your Sumo recordings and I thank you much for that. I am also seeding all of them for minimum three times of what I take and mostly longer! With the January Sumo approaching I was hoping to catch up on the previous games available and I would be SO VERY HAPPY if you could please seed the Aki Basho days 10,12-15 as I am still missing them! Really would like to see the finals!
If it not asking too much I would love to see the even older Nagoya Basho. Please help me with this! Please drop me a line if you see this, My email is ""sumo at bolingo dot org""
best greetings from fruitjam."
