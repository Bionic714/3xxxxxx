,fruitjam,2007-12-26T21:38Z,"Hope you are still seeding this! I got the 1-9 days and am still seeding those still since I got them down, but I have not seen any seeding of days 10-15 for about a weeks time now! But maybe you are aways for X-mas. Anyhow I would be most grateful to see the last days of this Basho! More seeding is most welcome! Thanks from ""bolingo69"""
