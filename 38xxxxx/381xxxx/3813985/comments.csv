,BalleKnalle,2007-09-21T15:45Z,I gona not try this. Maybe this hack your acc
,DJRavine,2007-09-21T19:58Z,"lol.. u bunch of nubs...
the reason its 28 gb is the steamapps.rar folder contains all the cache files for the games in steam...
if you think there is a hack in here or a virus.. ur are either to young to realize what you are doing... or u are too stupid too read the readme and to understand hacks...
i have said NEVER use ur official account...
due to it might be banned on the steam network..
so how the hell does it hack ur acct... u nub.. 
it merely unlocks the dll's to access a local steam service.. rather than to the official servers... i hate ppl that comment on things b4 testing or even knowing what they are looking it... "
,raxik,2007-09-23T15:35Z,holy shit... sounds awesome... but 28.4 gigs wit 1 seed will take forever
,DJRavine,2007-09-24T12:36Z,"true.. but thats only the gcf's...

,djdeez,2007-11-28T20:51Z,"PLEASE. SEED.!!!

Works beautifully, but I'm at 96% with a gig to go on the GCFs, and steam servers are always busy!

I will seed this for a long time if I can get it finished!"
,sheff_world,2007-11-29T00:42Z,"seed plz, this great upload))"
,Yarkz,2007-12-09T19:27Z,"Wow this torrent is unbeleivable but the speed, it's less than .01% an hour, therefore it will take way over a year.  Doing the math if it jumps too .01% an hour it will be 416 days which is just wow.

Atleast after I get it I will seed this torrent the most of all my others."
,Yarkz,2007-12-10T00:40Z,Sped up now lol so ignore other comment
,mr_virus_maker,2007-12-22T01:59Z,"looks nice real nice. tried this once with another one and it ended up not working at all.

btw, does anyone know how to hide files when you dont have a cd. WHen you download a game and then you need to hide the file to play instead of using a cd, does anyone know name of that program ?"
,akarawwar,2008-01-02T08:01Z,This sounds too awesome to pass up thanks guys for all your hard work and KUDOS!!!  Once i complete this i will seed it for as long as i can.
,ogge.,2008-01-14T18:55Z,"XD, you guys are all noobs, the reason it's 28,4 gig is beacsuse it coantaines about 6 or 7 games!"
,unrealt3_93,2008-02-24T11:20Z,download pacsteam instead of this!!!!!!!
,CaMzOrZ,2008-03-31T09:46Z,Can you please create a compressed portal gfc/ncf file? thanx
,TIGERFEAR,2008-06-15T21:48Z,I think this is Bullshit a STeam is not 28gB it cant be possible I'm not biting this........
,light24bulbs,2008-08-08T06:44Z,"hmmm.. could a similar effect be achived by using someone else's crack and then downloading GCFs individually for JUST the games i want?  Will the GCFs make the ""server busy"" error leave for any given game?"
,H.Bit,2008-08-19T20:01Z,seeed
,BludyBlinx,2008-10-13T05:33Z,Guys...don't get this file its crap get Pacsteam...its the SAME thing but faster to DL and takes a lot less disk space for shitty hard disks like mine :D
