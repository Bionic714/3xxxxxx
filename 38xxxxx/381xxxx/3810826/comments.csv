,Rolle12,2007-09-19T23:35Z,"I think it's a BBC documentary about Prince finances, may be wrong. Found this after searching: 
Next up, the enigma that is Prince. Liquid Assets talk to the friends, family, employees and collaborators. This film reveals how his dedication to his art, determination for creative control and obsession with film caused him to rupture his finances to the point of bankruptcy.

Since his infamous split with Warner Brothers, Prince has become a music industry maverick. He now keeps a mysteriously low profile but stays more in business than ever before. Prince's Millions lifts the lid on a fascinating career."
