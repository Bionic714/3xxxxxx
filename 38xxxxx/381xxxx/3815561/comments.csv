Thanks you goodnes."
,ailsa1208,2007-09-27T23:14Z,"The register code from keygen works when you put it in the register window on program startup, but next time I run the program, the pop up window that ask me to register will show again! And I'm still limited to convert 300Mb for single file. So that means I'm still using the trial version even if the program accept my register code. Any ideas?"
,ailsa1208,2007-09-28T00:09Z,"Oh..the problem has resolved! I should enter my register name first (in the register window), then enter the name in the keygen window.

It works fine now. Thanks for the great upload!"
,borsta,2007-09-29T00:21Z,"Cant get the registration to work as ailsa1208 say?

someone got any idea?
"
,elin482,2007-09-30T10:40Z,"Concerning the KeyGen and registration:
I had no problem getting PowerIso to work fully registered in XPsp2, but in XPsp1 I got the same error as ailsa1208 first reported.
The way he suggested to resolve it doesnÂ´t help (neither does for instance to Register before or after Reboot).
-Anyone got a clue?"
