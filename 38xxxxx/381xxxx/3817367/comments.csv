,Elksnout,2007-09-29T20:27Z,There is no PC version. swapper1 is just a disgruntled user.
,swapper1,2007-10-26T05:57Z,"There is barely a MAC version as the guy making this software is a damn retard.  He takes peoples money, only to give them a less then working program, then asks for more money to get one that works.

THIS is why I put this up here, and will continue putting up new versions of this software until this moron pulls his head out of his ass, and hears the POP!"
