This is a badass band from the 90's called Mr. Scary from Springfield Missouri, fronted by David Mark now the owner of Davids Guitar Loft in St Louis Missouri.
He was a local legend on the guitar circuit and a serious master of the guitar. This was recorded locally and hasn;t been available for many years. I hope you enjoy this shred fest as much as I enjoyed watching it being made. David if you read this, thanks for the great music and good times past. You can visit Daivd at www.davidsguitarloft.com
