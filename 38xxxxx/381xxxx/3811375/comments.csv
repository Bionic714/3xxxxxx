Many thx"
,atv,2007-09-20T21:19Z,"@shareall:
For Metroguide u need no key, but normally it's not routeable.
With the patch in the comment, it works like city navigator.
I'm quite estonished that Garmin has not yet killed that possibility."

,jaybee276,2007-09-28T12:29Z,"It works great for me.
Only one problem I have found. If I transfer many map segments to my GPS device, I loose the detail. That is the map shows it like on the original installation when I bought the GPS. A single map segment loaded is ok. It is only when I load a lot of segments. Has anyone else had this problem??"
,FatFreddy2,2007-09-30T23:11Z,"@jaybee276:
Did you tried the original version or the one with MetroGold?"
,customroyal,2007-10-01T22:51Z,"Works great, thanks a lot :)"
,StitchJones,2007-10-05T17:44Z,"Does not work with metrogold, routing is not uploaded to the gps."
,tisseman,2007-10-08T21:30Z,"Works perfect on my Garmin 60CSX in Stockholm.
Many Thanks"

,SunyJim,2007-10-22T05:53Z,"Please!!!
Still looking for Metroguide North America 8????
Must be out there somewhere!

Thanks Nincsenez for Europe!!"
,FatFreddy2,2007-10-24T00:23Z,"@skoupro:
It does contain maps for Greece, but not 100% coverage.
4 map sets:
Agia Paraskevi, Athina, Patra, Thessaloniki
All together about 8MBytes."
,SunyJim,2007-10-25T22:24Z,My metrogold worked just fine. You just have to click the little button to include route info in mapsource before uploading. works fine

,halo1981,2007-12-01T12:50Z,"works fine! thanks a lot, no need to find an unlock code for city navigator anymore.."
,funkimonki,2007-12-12T02:11Z,"Used this with Metrogold - works great.

I also checked these maps against City Navigator Europe v9 and they seem 99.9% the same.  There are some VERY subtle differences but I didn't, in my spot checks, see any more or less streets when comparing the two products.

A little PS to Garmin:  Because you decided to stop offering the two-for-one upgrades... and screwed up which GPS's were associated with which products I had legally purchased... it meant I was going to have to spend $75 for one upgrade and then purchase a full version at ($250?).  Thanks but no thanks."
,izub,2007-12-15T06:01Z,"Ok I've got the torrent complete...
