,sweatyrich,2007-09-28T11:40Z,"Dude,
Many thanks for posting this.
May I make a suggestion were you to post something like this again?

You're not gonna same *much* space by RAR'ing the files, and it also forces people to download the whole 8.88GB file even if they're only after a few missing episodes from each season.
If would be better to upload the whole set of files (but not as individual torrents!), so then people have to choice to download every file, or pick the specific ones they need.

Also, by ""hiding"" the files in a RAR, it could potentially contain anything, and not what you claim it to contain (there are some dodgy people around!).

Anyway, just my tuppence worth.

Thanks again."

,tonyfred,2007-10-04T01:47Z,Anyone else downloaded this lately? Any trouble unpacking it? Is is worth the download time? Thanks very much. And also thanks to the uploader.
,apwnage,2007-12-16T21:01Z,takes way too fucking long to download...but still...not complaining...thanks a lot Pirateatheart...try keeping at least a week of time to download the whole thing...mine stayed at 0.00% for almost 8 hours.
,apwnage,2007-12-16T21:19Z,download it only if your computer can do it at over 6kb/s...if not i dun think its worth it...ok.
,apwnage,2007-12-19T06:00Z,been 6 days still at 14.2%
,apwnage,2007-12-19T06:01Z,Thanks anyway....
