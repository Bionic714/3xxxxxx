,Ryall,2008-02-23T14:06Z,"please could someone compress this and repost it? 32gig is quite a massive download, and will discourage sharing.. "
,JUGGERNAUT477,2008-05-23T04:49Z,"im downloading this now but,how would a 32gig file fit on a dvd 9...."
,JUGGERNAUT477,2008-05-31T06:29Z,how can i open a vod file?? some1 plz tell me

thanks"
,bozemansapphire,2008-06-28T04:14Z,"WOW, i would give anything to have this torrent. but i don't think i can take up 32 gigs of memory for it. actually the memory ain't even the problem. this will take me a month to download lmao. can you compress this so we can download it. i will seed this out at full force for a long time. i mean if i ever get it downloaded that is. (make it a zip file)"
,bozemansapphire,2008-07-03T00:48Z,"how many episodes are in this torrent? i have 27 episodes already and i think that's all there are, period. unless i missed something.  oh and thanks for all the info you gave for this torrent. it keeps us guessing!"
,neirfane,2008-08-10T07:14Z,i've been wanting this. i guess if i get the new job i can try to buy it.  how about uploading a few episodes at a time. that would be killer. or a dvd at the time. or something. my hd is only 80 gigs and i am sharing a bunch of movies.
,neirfane,2008-08-10T07:25Z,wow. i gutted my system and i'm still only 29.2 gig free. lol.
,PawnSacrifice,2008-08-13T19:17Z,Valiant effort guys. 
,rc71,2008-09-03T19:25Z,"Normally I don't write negative comments, but these are too much.  How do I fit 32gig on a disk,  Zipped files, 80gigs.  LOL!  
A 320gig HD is $50. "
,MxMShare,2008-10-06T16:36Z,"It appears that all the prior commenters did not look at the torrent - it is FIVE DVD9s, not a single one.  The files in this torrent are in DVD format (VOB) and ready to burn.  By the way, you can use freeware like DVDShrink to take these VOB files and compress to 5 single layer DVDs.  "
,sinth13,2009-01-02T00:26Z,"Although it will probably take me awhile to download this, I appreciate very much what you have done.  Most uploaders upload compressed .avi versions or other formats of DVD's and not the whole thing.  There are 27 episodes, on 5 DVD's and since they are probably VOB/BUP/IFO files, it's very easy to do either a 1 to 1 copy or whatever you want to do.  Much less work on the downloaders end.  If no one else has done it, I may upload this in a compressed format once I have it.  I have a 20 megabit d/l connection, but that doesn't mean much with torrents. :)  Hopefully I don't get throttled again by my ISP. Thanks again mike18xx."
,lastjedi,2010-06-30T19:12Z,heyike you wouldnt happen to have the king arthur and the knights of justice cartoon series?nobody has put it up on here.
,loljk,2010-08-12T14:17Z,Seeing as TB hard-drives are common nowdays this isn't really that big of a torrent.
