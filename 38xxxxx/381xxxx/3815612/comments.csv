,Pebl,2007-10-02T12:11Z,What the heck is going on with all those frigging padding files??? There's a HUGE overhead to download this way - release a decent version or don't release at all. 
[T],Chrille_1977,2007-10-17T17:41Z,Peb: There are over 6900 peers that doesn't seem to have any problems with them.

,Ran4,2008-01-06T04:03Z,Chrille_1977 - You are a retard.
,OrcinusOrca,2008-01-10T06:31Z,"I personally am grateful for the upload, and the rest of you should thank him/her instead of bitching about it or don't download.

Having said that, what IS the story on those padding files? I mean what are they for??"
,jasmin18,2008-02-04T03:01Z,kan noen sende en link så jeg får norsk text ? plz =)
[T],Chrille_1977,2008-02-29T17:36Z,"The torrent is created by BitComet and anyone who doesn't use BitComet see the paddingfiles at download. But they can be unchecked and not downloaded, it won't make any difference on the avi files. To all of you that makes complaint about it... no one is forcing you to download this torrent. "
,Charmed08,2008-03-02T21:10Z,"I'm still downloading, but the portion I've gotten downloaded so far doesn't want to play in WMP.  I've had no problems playing other .avi files, but the ones in this download give me this error:

Windows Media Player Error Message Help

You've encountered error message C00D1199 while using Windows Media Player. The following information might help you troubleshoot the issue.
Cannot play the file

Windows Media Player cannot play the file. You might encounter this error message for one of the following reasons:

    *

      The file type is not supported by the Player. For a list of file types (formats) that are supported by Windows Media Player, see the table on supported file types in this topic.
    *

      The file type is supported by the Player, but the file was compressed by using a codec that is not supported by the Player.
    *

      Your sound card or sound controller is not configured properly. Try changing the audio output device associated with the Player.
       To change the audio output device
         1.

            Click the arrow below the Now Playing tab, and then click More Options.
         2.

            Click the Devices tab, and then double-click Speakers.
         3.

            In the Audio device to use box, select a different sound card or sound controller.
    *

      The file type is supported, but you are trying to play it in a way that is not supported by the Player. For example, you might have tried to drag a DVD file with a .vob extension from a DVD to the Windows Media Player icon. Or you might have tried to open a .vob file by clicking Open on the File menu.
    *

      You are trying to play one part of a multipart file. Use a newsreader or other program to combine the files, and then try again.

I've tried following the suggestions that WMP gave me and they still won't play.  Any suggestions?"

[T],Chrille_1977,2008-08-03T07:00Z,"TOO BIG TO DOWNLOAD OR DO YOU ONLY WANT PART OF THE DOWNLOAD?

In most torrent programs you can check/uncheck the files to download in the torrent. If your program supports this you can usually do this when asked where to save the files.
You can let some files (or just the onces you want) be checked and download that. If the torrent is too big you can burn to DVDs or watch on computor, then delete the files from your harddrive. Open your torrentprogram again and mark the torrent. Go to torrent settings, uncheck the already downloaded files and check others for download. And so on until you have all the files you want."

,siemprelisto,2009-01-08T06:23Z,"Hi Chrille_1977,

My 10 year old niece told her mother, ""the only thing she wants for her birthday is Charmed DVD's""...you are going to make a young girl Very Happy on her 11th birthday and for a long time to come.

Thank You very Much!!!

,bizzybody,2009-04-26T06:49Z,"I just need a DVD image of Season 2, Disc 4.

Someone set a bag of incense sticks on the bottom side of the disc (it wasn't me) and the oil went through the bag and actually ate into the polycarbonate. I've cleaned it, sanded it radially with up to 2000 grit wet paper, which is finer than a Disc Dr wheel, and used ultra fine plastic polish. It looks like the oil penetrated to the data layer and ruined it.

This plastic shrugs off lacquer thinner, which is an extremely strong solvent.

Keep incense and its smoke the hell away from your CDs and DVDs!

P.S. This is my older sister's Charmed DVD set and she's the one who left the disc out of its holder."
,bizzybody,2009-04-26T07:05Z,What's the resolution of the video?
,boy1990,2009-10-18T07:03Z,My computer is having a problem downloading the torrent so I am wondering if some one would download it and email it to my email address at natethegreat141990@gmail.com thank you I only need one season out of this thing and I will seed for a while always at least 2.5
,pearobearo,2009-11-01T00:41Z,"I don't have sound for any of the episodes for season 2-6... 

Is there a codec I have to install or something like that?

Thank you for the upload."
