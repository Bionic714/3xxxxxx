,seedbitchimnotgonna,2007-09-19T19:22Z,why is download and upload both so slow. Both lie around 20kbps and i have no limit to either download or upload speed. I have 10mbit broadband so it makes no sense.

,zaibazu,2007-09-20T00:50Z,"I know that I will delete the archives once I unpacked them because they would be 4 GB of extra baggage on my HD because I am pretty tight on free space. This means I won't seed this after it finished, I would have if the torrent would consist of the image files. 

Lots of people do the same"
,Rangrang,2007-09-20T01:04Z,"So because you are on a anti-rar crusade, you are in fact a leech and not seeding because you are defiant?

I'd suggest you keep the rar until you've seeded enough, then delete them afterwards. Or just unpack, install and delete the iso instead.

Sigh."

,jennysalala,2007-09-20T04:08Z,Everyone knows that if a game is truly worth buying then they'd buy it. Some are lazy and decide not to buy it even though it's become an addiction and others are just tight on money. Good game and good upload! I don't care if it takes a week but I'll definitely seed until a ratio of about 3.0 seeing as how many leechers there are!

,BlackJack07,2007-09-21T04:09Z,"This hacked version works perfectly for me (WinXP). Here is how to get it to work (or at least, how I did it and had absolutely no problems).

To Unrar:

Get WinRAR if you don't have it already. Go to their site to download a free trial version (http://www.rarlab.com/), or find a cracked copy here at TPB (oddly enough, most cracked copies are RAR'd, meaning you need WinRAR to unRAR the cracked WinRAR...so you may need the trial version just to unarchive the cracked version if you can't find an .exe version to start with).


1) Unrar by RIGHT CLICKING ""flt-wic.001"".
1a) then select ""Open With..."" and navigate to ""WinRAR Archiver"".
1b) It will proceed to unRAR just fine. I use WinRAR 3.70 beta.

2) Mount the created .iso file with Daemon Tools. I use v4.08HE, it works just fine.
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

3) The games ""Install"" option will pop up in its menu. You can try to install this way, but if it doesn't work, just open ""My Computer"", go to the mounted drive, and ""Explore"". Click the ""Setup.exe."" file to get started installing.

4) Go to ""My Computer"" and select the mounted drive, and open it with ""Explore"".

5) Open the ""Fairlight"" folder.

6) Copy the 3 files (wic.exe, wic_online.exe, wic_ds.exe) into the newly installed game folder ""C:\Program Files\Sierra Entertainment\World in Conflict"" (these files are the hacked files you need to run the game)

7) Click the hacked ""wic.exe"" file you just copied.

8) Have fun stompin' Russkies!

It's that simple and it works perfectly."

How do I LAN it without a key?

And to whoever was moaning it doesn't work on Vista... You're a muppet. IT'S DESIGNED FOR VISTA. Hence the DX10 tag. Probably something up with your PC. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful."

Then i downloaded this, BAM blue screen as im panning down in training mode, restarted and i got a little further in training, but BAM blue screen with writing once i got control of the tank in training mode.

my comp isnt used to games on it, let alone pirated. (i got roller coaster tycoon 3, zoo tycoon 2, the sims 2 with expansion packs, the movies (bought), but those dont have as good as graphics as these. is this my computer jsut getting used to these games, is the palying time without freezing gonig to keep getting longer like how it is now? will it eventually stop freezing altogether.?

Cause much more people will seed, if they don't have to keep two versions of everything they download - The rar version and the unpacked version. While the job you're doing is great, that's really a thing that would make it even greater.

Choose B. Now you will either have to find winrar in the programs list or it will automatically appear. choose it. now it should open up winrar. CLick the Extract button. Extract it to whatever it suggests. Then once its done extracting open the file and there should be an .iso image. if so then right click daemon tools and go to "" Virtual CD/DVD ROM"" move your mouse over it and then move your mouse over a device and hit mount image. A thing should pop up where you will have to find the folder containing the .iso image. open with the thing and presto! you can install the game =D"

To Unrar:

Get WinRAR if you don't have it already. Go to their site to download a free trial version (http://www.rarlab.com/), or find a cracked copy here at TPB.
## EDIT: A link to a clean, working full version WinRAR-torrent (.exe-file): http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3746465/Winrar_3.70_and_Key.exe_CleaN_ 
##

1) Unrar by RIGHT CLICKING ""flt-wic.001"".
1a) then select ""Open With..."" and navigate to ""WinRAR Archiver"".
1b) It will proceed to unRAR just fine. I use WinRAR 3.70 beta.

2) Mount the created .iso file with Daemon Tools. I use v4.08HE, it works just fine.
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

3) The games ""Install"" option will pop up in its menu. You can try to install this way, but if it doesn't work, just open ""My Computer"", go to the mounted drive, right click and ""Explore"". Click the ""Setup.exe."" file to get started installing.

4) Go to ""My Computer"" and select the mounted drive, and open it with ""Explore"".

5) Open the ""Fairlight"" folder.

6) Copy the 3 files (wic.exe, wic_online.exe, wic_ds.exe) into the newly installed game folder ""C:\Program Files\Sierra Entertainment\World in Conflict"" (these files are the hacked files you need to run the game)

7) Click the hacked ""wic.exe"" file you just copied.

8) Have fun stompin' Russkies!

Most standard integrated grafix cards are great for the screen savers and thats about it. Most modern games don't even want to boot with integrated grafixs and then have endless rendering problem if you actually manage to get in-game. If you are looking for a good series of grafix card I would advise Nvidia 6 series and up. the 6600GT and The 6800 gt/ultra are good cheap and reliable card for low level grafixs and would be perfect for a casual gamer.  Please note how ever that with more powerful grafix card you need better power supplies and and you also need to ensure compatibility with the computer (Some generic cases are not big enough for some of the beefier card these days)     "

Tried the cracks in the FairLight dir of .iso = game won't load.

Tried the cracks from gamecopyworld = game won't load.

Tried uninstalling, then re-installing with daemon tools set to securROM, running the game from virtual disk with securROM enabled = game won't load.  

Tried above after applying the supplied cracks = game won't load.

Tried screaming really loud at the computer = yeah, like that was gonna help

...in other words, I have tried all I can think of, and taken all the advice given to others with issues running the game.  My system has the required hardware, windows XP SP2, and DX9. (Is there any release of DX10 for XP?)  

Should I just give up?  Been doing this for years; wondering if there is something wrong with my box...wic.exe loads, takes memory, then drops off the list of running processes in TaskManager.  What. The. Fuck.   Help?"

The .nfo or read me included should tell you where the crack is. if there is no crack included then go to Game Copy World. type in the name of the game in the search bar on the right side. find your game in the search results and click it. then click on your version of the game. download the file and unzip/unrar it. right click and ""cut"" the cracked file. go to your installation directory and paste the file. it should ask you to overwrite. if it doesnt ask you to overwrite then you put it in the wrong folder. if it does ask then say yes to overwrite and that it. go to your desktop and start the game.

,TheTaking20,2008-03-09T01:57Z,Ok so all I do is mount the game then copy the cracked files into the game folder I dont have to burn on a DVD? Cause I downloaded it and mounted the game and then I copied the crack files and then went I went to play after I clicked on New Campaign nothing would happen. And if anyone as a key code for the multiplayer I was wondering if I could have it

,BJ160,2008-03-12T16:55Z,"nvm i dound it, was in the fairlight folder :)

1. extract the ISO file from the files u downloaded with WinRAR.

2. mount the ISO file with Daemon tools or whatever you use.

3.install the game to a folder of your choice.

4.""explore"" the (fake) cd and go to the fairlight folder.

5 copy the ""wic"" file and paste it in the folder in witch you have installed the game.

6. play.

,TheBoxNinja,2008-03-23T05:50Z,"ok, heres what you do:

(1) Download the torrent and wait for it to finish
(2) Open any one of the files with winRAR and then extract the .iso file to any folder you wish.
(3) mount that .iso file with daemon tools.
(4) wait for it to install
(5) go to ""my computer"" (or whatever you called it) and go to ""explore""
(6) open the folder titled ""Fairlight"" and copy all the files in that folder
(7) go to program files and then open the folder that you installed World in Conflict to.
(8) copy the cracked files (the ones that we're all in the fairlight folder) and over wright the ones that were already in the game folder.
(9) make shortcuts for each of the new cracked files and delete the old shortcuts.
(10) open game from the short cut.
(11) have fun"

To correct this problem, click the tools tab and go into ""Folder Options..."" once here, click on the ""View"" tab and then scroll down to the very bottom, here, you should find ""Hide extensions for known file types"" box, untick this.

Once you have done this go back to the folder that flt-wic.001 is located in, right click it and make sure the name is ONLY ""fly-wic.001"" and that there isn't a .rar extension on the end of it.

Once you have done that right click the file, open it with Winrar archive and just extract the file, it should extract correctly now.

Hope this works

-xp does slow down after about 6 months of use(reinstall every six months fixes)
-updates on vista can make it take up to 30 minutes to boot.
-there are less virusses for vista

1. Download the file. 
2. Run Winrar program and then using the Winrar program, locate the .001 file. Click on that one. This should give you an ISO image. 
3. Now virtually mount that ISO image using PowerISO. Run the virtual drive containing that ISO image 
4. Install. 
5. Get the crack from FairLight and simply install that one to the directory. It's inside the program file that game is installed to.
6. This will allow the game to run without the security check/disk check.

,apoligize,2008-12-16T17:38Z,"StoneRacing;
1) you duble click on the first file (...001 etc.) and winrar should open

1a) if not, ""rightclick"", ""open with"", ""choose winrar"", and clikc ""ok""

2) when it opens, click once on the image file (.iso) and click ""extract too"" and then choose the place were you want it to be

3) fire up daemon tools or similar, ""rightclick"" on the little daemon tools icon (noramlly a red or green icon), choose ""viritual cd/dvd rom"", then click on one of the fake dvd roms, ""mount image"" and locate the image file

4) go to ""my computer"", ""rightclick"" the the ""WIC"" icon on the fake dvd, click ""explore"" adn locate ""setup.exe"" adn duble click on it

5) there you go, have fun playing this awesome game :)

5a) good luck, and if the setup don't respond (a black cmd-themed thing pops-up, but dissapers again, move the image file (where you EXTRACTED IT) to another location, and then repeat the procedure from 3)

This hacked version works perfectly for me (WinXP). Here is how to get it to work (or at least, how I did it and had absolutely no problems).

To Unrar:

Get WinRAR if you don't have it already. Go to their site to download a free trial version (http://www.rarlab.com/), or find a cracked copy here at TPB (oddly enough, most cracked copies are RAR'd, meaning you need WinRAR to unRAR the cracked WinRAR...so you may need the trial version just to unarchive the cracked version if you can't find an .exe version to start with).


1) Unrar by RIGHT CLICKING ""flt-wic.001"".
1a) then select ""Open With..."" and navigate to ""WinRAR Archiver"".
1b) It will proceed to unRAR just fine. I use WinRAR 3.70 beta.

2) Mount the created .iso file with Daemon Tools. I use v4.08HE, it works just fine.
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

3) The games ""Install"" option will pop up in its menu. You can try to install this way, but if it doesn't work, just open ""My Computer"", go to the mounted drive, and ""Explore"". Click the ""Setup.exe."" file to get started installing.

4) Go to ""My Computer"" and select the mounted drive, and open it with ""Explore"".

5) Open the ""Fairlight"" folder.

6) Copy the 3 files (wic.exe, wic_online.exe, wic_ds.exe) into the newly installed game folder ""C:\Program Files\Sierra Entertainment\World in Conflict"" (these files are the hacked files you need to run the game)

7) Click the hacked ""wic.exe"" file you just copied.

8) Have fun stompin' Russkies!

It's that simple and it works perfectly."

,Slothmoss,2009-09-18T11:53Z,"Im sorry to be such a noob, but how do i extract these files, i right click on them and all i can do is archive them"
,THEDONANDMIKESHOW,2009-10-10T17:09Z,"Could someone give me an idea on how to fix my issue please? I open the torrent's folder and right click the file ""flt-wic.001"" and extract the files to my desktop. I than mount what now appears on my desktop ""flt-wic.iso"" with DaemonPro. I than get an autoplay option box on screen that allows me to choose either to open folder to view files or install or run the file ""Run Autorun.exe"" and the green World in Conflict icon is to the left of the autorun option. I click the autorun option and the World in Conflict install screen appears. I click ""Install"" and get the message ""LastDllError 1407, Description Cannot find window class."" and my fun ends there....Thanks    "

If you get this error message: LastDllError 1407, Description Cannot find window class, try this:

Copy all DVD contents of the game into a folder on your hard drive and run the installation from that location (if you receive and overwrite prompt select Yes to all). See below for instructions:

-Quit all programs that are running.
-Right-click in empty are on the desktop then point to New, and then click Folder.
-Name the folder, and then press ENTER.
-Double-click on the folder that you just created.
-From the Tools menu, click Folder Options.
-Click the View tab. Under Hidden files and folders, click Show hidden files and folders, and then click OK.
-Insert game DVD into your drive. Hold down the SHIFT key on your keyboard to prevent the program from starting automatically.

SFV files are verification files that match the hash of the files to its internal hashes and determines if they are corrupt or not.

the .### files are rar files split into multiple files open one of them with winrar and extract the file inside and you get your .ISO"

,GoblinzanWarrior,2011-08-20T23:38Z,"Lo. first off good game, torrent (at least for me) was quick. 

Extracting was easy, installing was easy, and copying the cracks was easy, i have done this many times before XD

BUT! when i run the cracked exe the screen goes black for a few seconds and then goes back to desktop. no sign of the game running in task manager.

anyone know why this happens, i looked back and saw other people with the same problem but couldnt find any anwsers.

would be a great help."

Just download WINrar and open the first one with that program. Everything else should be selfexplained."

If you have similiar problems, press the browse button and find it manually. Extract the files to the desktop and use alcohol or similiar program. Install it and copy the 3 files in the fairlight catalog. Paste it in the original sierra file. Works Great! Thanks alot! "
