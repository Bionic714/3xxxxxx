,paschkow,2007-09-27T15:45Z,"What da Ya Mean 100% crap
Iv checked it and contains no viruses or malware
some antivirus (AKA AVG) detect keygens and other windows changing exe's as trojans
well anyway it worked for me with no problems along with many freinds.
make up your own mind once youv downloaded it"
,Stretix,2007-09-30T18:46Z,Uhm...My Panda picked up a Generic Backdoor...
,trh2086,2007-09-30T22:44Z,Come on people! Are you seriously that retarded to sit here and think this is a legitimate download of XP and all version of Vista? The file is only about 2  megs and Vista itself had to be put on a DVD which is only used when I cd won't hold it. Think about it!
,trh2086,2007-09-30T22:47Z,My bad...I retract that last comment. I didn't read this right. It's not a copy of any OS. It's just a way around the Genuine Windows check. I still wouldn't download it. I got around it without having to download anything.
,iden32,2007-10-03T08:18Z,THIS ONE IS THE BEST!!! THE REST WOULDN'T WORK!!! THIS ONE WORKED!!! WAY TO GO paschkow!!! You rock!!!

,mercenarygod,2008-01-21T21:18Z,this is full of virus's and i feel sorry for the dumb shits who say it works perfect because they have a shitty anti-virus and have a lot of virus's.

,pixelperu,2010-01-11T08:21Z,"Poeple like to write just coz they can. You all should read about false positives.  DAm if you have an antivirus and trust on it, then what a heck, just download the file!  Also you can get Kaspersky... Anyway, all good antivirus will aware you of a dangerous file (false positive) now go a goggle and check around what a it means.

Or Better... go and buy a genuine copy of any Windows.
