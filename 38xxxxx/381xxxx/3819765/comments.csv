,Malanthius,2007-10-16T20:21Z,"Team Fortress 2 for Dummies!

Ok to install and play do the following...

1) Install the game by running the TF2_full_client_18.09.07[csmania.ru] icon in the Team fortress 2 folder.

2) Install patches in the Team Fortress 2 nosteam folder in the following order.

1st, gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.2-v1.0.0.3_patch
2nd, gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.3-v1.0.0.4_patch
3rd, gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.4_patch
4th, gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.4-v1.0.0.5_patch

Instalation is now complete! 

To find a server to play on register and log into http://game-monitor.com/

Once you are registered type Steam (I didn't have any luck typing no steam) in the Search for servers w/ box.

Select Team Fortress 2 in the playing box.

In locations you can select All or an area near you.

Once you get a list. look for servers that say no steam. Copy the ip including the port (IE. 64.352.28.152 : 60078)< just a made up number. Don't use this!!!

While the game is running hit (`) to bring up the console. Type connect and paste the ip and hit enter. Bam! you are playing! Make sure you pick a server that is not full!"

Add the line -steam at the en of the shortcut, it should look something like this:

""C:\The folder the game is installed in\Team Fortress 2\hl2.exe"" -steam -novid -noforcemaccel -noforcemparms -noforcemspd -game tf -console

You know what i mean?

The console appeared now.
The reason why i asked for it was because i read somewhere here that to join a server i needed to type in the ip in the console.

This means that the server you are trying to connect to is using protocol 12 but you only have protocol 8.

To fix this you need to update/patch your game with the patches"
,MinaX,2007-10-29T13:24Z,"Wven though I've updated with all the patches in the patch torrent I've still got protocol 11, and all servers are running on 12. Links to patch would be very nice :)"

,dongalos22,2007-11-15T10:26Z,"It worked for me


Steps:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1. Run TF2_full_client_18.09.07[csmania.ru].exe which installs the game to a location of your chosing - make sure you chose english if you don't understand russian and let it create a desktop shortcut for Team Fotress 2

After above install is done you need to go back into that folder/directory and look for 3 (THREE) .rar files and extract them in this order back into the folder you installed the game above in step #1

#2. Use Winrar to extract > TF2_HOTFIX.rar into the folder you installed the game from step #1

#3. Use Winrar to extract > Patch_tf2_07-09-17_07-09-21.zip into the folder you installed the game from step #1.

#4. Use Winrar to extract > FINAL_FIXX_ADVANCED.rar into the folder you installed the game from step #1. 

You're now up to patch 1.0.0.2 NOW GET THE PATCHES ALSO FROM PIRATEBAY to get you up to Version 1.0.0.8 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Run them in order
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.2-v1.0.0.3_patch.exe
gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.3-v1.0.0.4_patch.exe
gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.4_patch.exe
gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.4-v1.0.0.5_patch.exe
gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.5-v1.0.0.6_patch.exe
gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.6-v1.0.0.7_patch.exe
gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.7-v1.0.0.8_patch.exe
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Servers:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
list is located here http://css.setti.info/servers/list-tf2.php

You can copy/paste the IP address into Team fotress console by typing CONNECT 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TROUBLESHOOT:

If Team fortress does not work make sure you have this for the desktop shortcut
right click the team fortress shortcut go to properties and target should look like this, different if you installed in another folder or drive of course than mine
""E:\Team Fortress 2\hl2.exe"" -steam -game tf -console

LAST if you get steam beta must be running in the find servers window look for Servers_Monitor.exe on google and install it, same group that made this made that program and its needed to run in background for server list to show up or you can just connect by using console and server list at css.setti.info"

,ares67,2007-11-19T14:24Z,"well, i followed the steps ozke stated to update, i installed it like this:

Install Game, TF2_Full_Client.....exe

Install patches:
1) TF2_HOTFIX.rar
2) Patch tf2_07-09....rar
3) FINAL_FIXX_ADVANCED

Then install protocol update, with this file:

Gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.2-1.0.0.9_patch

this is the order if i read right... but I am willing to reinstall anyway."
,ares67,2007-11-19T14:29Z,"the update to 1.0.0.9 created some shortcuts that dont work, it created 4 of them, all of them say failed to load launcher dll, so yea, looking for some help,"

If you can't follow this then consider yourself with an IQ of  minus 340 :)

Download this torrent and

Run: TF2_full_client_18.09.07[csmania.ru].exe 

patch:
1. TF2_HOTFIX.rar
2. patch_tf2_07-09-17_07-09-21.zip
3. FINAL_FIXX_ADVANCED.rar

4. Download and run this into your game directory
   gamerx_tf2_v1.0.0.2-v1.0.0.9_patch.exe
   Available here http://www.mediafire.com/?fmjvmmmhyjn 100mb

5. now you should have v1.0.0.9 protocol 14. 
You can check your version by typing ""version"" without quotes in the console (press ` on top of tab button on keyboard to get console)
Now if you try to join the servers on the menu you will get ""server uses different class tables error"".
So you need to update again

6. Now you need to update from 1.0.0.9 protocol 14 (16.11.07)  to 1.0.1.1 protocol 14 (22.11.07)
http://depositfiles.com/files/2473308  3mb 
    Download and run this into your game directory

7. Now lastly update from 1.0.1.1 protocol 14 (28.11.07) to 1.0.1.2 protocol 15 (21.12.07)
http://depositfiles.com/files/2787978 17mb
    Download and run this into your game directory

8. Now you should be able to play on all servers. Some servers may not have updated yet so you will have to wait a few days and they will update too so you can play.

You need the latest version of winrar to extract 7zip."

I also would like to know this... I did the same accidentaly. I have a legit SteamID with some games I bought, but not TF2. I ran this TF2 from the folder I extracted it to in my desktop. Steam is running in Program Files. 

Still... TF2 nosteam detected Steam and the overlay and server browser worked, but my SteamID in Steam kept the same and didn't say I was playing TF2, so I guess I'm good yes?
