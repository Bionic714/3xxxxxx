,265Feral,2007-10-02T01:24Z,"01 Oct 2007 - no peers, no seeds, trackers offline :(
I have PeaTea's season 4 01-11 and it's a good rip (really enjoyed i); I was looking forward to getting the 2nd half of the season but can't seem to d/l it.  Any chance of a seeder coming online...I'm willing to continue seeding for a week or so afterwards?"
,ptfg,2007-10-02T18:23Z,"Hi starca and 265feral,
I have been seeding continously. (except for an hour).
I just checked and I see that 76.5% have been transfered, 20 people have 76.5%, 1 has 76.8%, 3 have 76.7%. Just remember, I am the only one seeding, since I have all the complete files on my PC.
My upload rate is slow, but I will seed, till I see at least 10 people who have 100%.
Just be patient, you'll get it all!

,starca,2007-10-02T19:05Z,"Thank you for notice us.
Whats hepend with servers upgrade on Pirate Bay???"
,ptfg,2007-10-02T19:12Z,"Hi starca and 265Feral, try this tracker, perhaps this will work better!

,ptfg,2007-10-02T19:26Z,"Hi starca and 265 Feral,
I just noticed that Piratebay ist making an upgrade and that the tracker will be unstable for a while!
Maybe that's the explanation for the very slow upload!?

By the way, Season 5, 6, and 7 can be found on min???va! All are rips off VHS-Video Tapes, they are still fairly good quality and are very watchable, all in english!"
,pmcx,2009-03-30T14:24Z,"Unless I got confused by something, #20 is really the season ending (#22), so watch #20 last. 

Other than that, it's all good. "
,cowboyronnie,2009-04-20T06:40Z,"Be careful that the one labeled as episode 18, Emission Impossible, is actually the season finale. If watched out of sequence, you'll have a major storyline fuddled. 

Thanks to ripper and uploader. Just thought I'd clarify. "
,cowboyronnie,2009-04-20T06:43Z,"Oh guy previous was right. Yeah, ep 20 is actually ep 22. Watch: 19, 21, 22, 20"
