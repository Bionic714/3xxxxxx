O.K., guys and gals, here is the last half of NYPD Blue - Season 4 in english, including engl. subtitles and extra features. I hope that all of you are satisfied with the video- and sound-quality. 
I will seed for at least 1 week (lousy upload rate!), so please seed; so that about 30-35 people will have them complete. Enjoy NYPD Blue. Hopefully, season 5, 6, etc. will be released on DVD, if they are available, buy them!
It sure would be nice if someone had recorded 5 to 11 off TV and then share them!

Greetings from PeaTea
