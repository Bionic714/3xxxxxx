,digitaldragon404,2007-09-21T23:01Z,As Far as I know there is no part 2
,Foil1212,2008-01-03T08:22Z,we're making part 2 right now!
,tfar3,2008-04-28T20:24Z,I am sure that you know that part 2 was never made.  At the end of part 1 that was a joke.  typical Mel Brooks.  I saw this movie when it first came out in the states and it is great.  I now want to DL it  and add Dutch subtitles for my wife.
,ntiahur22,2008-10-18T15:14Z,"There is no Part Two.. it was being made many years ago, but was cancelled by the producers. Mel Brooks created an urban legend that Part Two was out there somewhere. This is a great movie, great quality upload.. "
