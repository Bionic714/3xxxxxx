,JollyRoger1911,2008-10-03T18:14Z,"It works!! 
If .mds reports you problem, just mount .mdf directly.
Thanks very much for uploading this JWGBG! "
,Djsintech,2009-01-14T23:39Z,"Yeah I must be a noob or something, but I tried magicISO, UltraISO, and A 120. I was always able to get the video and audio files out... But every time I tried to burn them to disc or watch them I got nothing... any hint from those that got it to work would be great... and the mount didnt work in 3 programs... "
,sutter_cane_66,2009-02-25T21:16Z,"Holy crap!
Two versions on to a DVD5: widescreen and PAN & SCAN.
Why didn't you rip the widescreen only? 
Who on earth wants a fullscreen when a widescreen is available?
Now we have crap image quaility... 2 times!!!

Oh, and of course DVDShrink aka ""the quality killer was used""...
Crap, crap..."
