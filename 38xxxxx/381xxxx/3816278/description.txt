The file originally was captured in MPGEg (was 1,6gb) using a TDT source but I compressed it in Real Video format (so now is about 700 mb and quality is quite good). Language spoken during match is spanish.
Leo Messi played a great match as well as Abidal and Iniesta. I'm a F.C Barcelona as you can see. :-) Enjoy!
