It's an non official version of nester, Warmtoe added the light gun support.

Homebrew: bloop
Always made by Warmtoe, this is a very simple game : you shoot targets. Not very funny alone, it's more interesting when you play with someone else (up to 4 players !!).
Plug the guns from the right, to the left in order to play ( Port D, then C, B and A)

Ironicly enough, we can see that it's Nintendo emulators that supports gun, unlike sega ones...
