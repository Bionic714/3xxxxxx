This is Propellerheads Reason 4.0 (build 905) Universal Binary for Mac Os X, was originally posted on demon oid, but seems to be down now so added tpb tracker. The disk image includes the Reason 4 Application folder and the orkester and factory sound banks.

THE SERIAL NUMBER IS NOT INCLUDED, 

we will have to wait until it appears.

The only seeds will initially come from the DHT, so you first guys will be best off using Azureus.

Please seed

Cheers
