,djtdon,2007-09-26T12:56Z,Reason 4s out? 
,adam666,2007-09-26T16:47Z,"To install you don't need to burn if you have toast titanium.

1.open toast.
2.under image file, select image file, select Reason4.dmg
3.click mount image file
4.In finder, drag reason folder to applications.
5.open Reason 4, and let it copy the soundbanks across.
6. Enter serial number(when it appears).
7.Enjoy reason and seed forever.
8.If you have the money and use it a lot, buy it.

:-)"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-26T17:07Z,I know this is a .dmg file but the program itself is cross platform right?
,adam666,2007-09-26T17:16Z,"@barabusignasius:There is obviously is a version for windows, but pretty sure this one is just for mac, its not a hybrid dvd."
,barabusignasius,2007-09-26T17:32Z,thanks..I was just wondering because the prop shop only has one version.
,barabusignasius,2007-09-26T17:45Z,"so is this an exact image of the retail dvd?
And big thanks for the upload.  )"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-26T17:54Z,OK so if this the version from the hopefully soon to be back ********  then it is a retail dvd.   However you say that it is pre retail build.  Which is it?  There is only one retail version reason and it is cross platform.
,adam666,2007-09-26T18:17Z,"@barabusignasius: i never said it was a pre retail build,on demon-oid the guy who posted said it was image of retail dvd,he also said it should work with windows as well, but ive tried mounting the image and cant find any windows installer. dunno"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-26T18:26Z,"sorry..my bad, I thought ""(build 905)"" meant pre-retail.   Sorry"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-26T18:38Z,@adam...yup..until I try im not sure but I think you have to first convert it to an ISO then burn it. then install from the dvd.   I hope it works....and thanks again:)
,adam666,2007-09-26T18:53Z,"yeah, i converted to an iso and mounted in toast, and it just appeared as the mac cd, normally hybrid disk images mount as 2 different cds for mac and win. good luck anywayz"
,EchoRob,2007-09-27T04:39Z,"If you have any friends that use a MAC ask them to burn this as a disc image 

It will then install on windows as if you bought an original copy"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-27T07:54Z,so no one has completed this download yet?...the other torrent seems to be dead at 97%...here too?
,mrvidder,2007-09-27T13:13Z,"hmmmm - this looks dodgy....

No-one completed.....

Why would anyone seed a file that wasn't complete unless they were looking to waste your time?"
,adam666,2007-09-27T14:49Z,"@barabusignasius & mrvidder: the downloaded 0 times doesn't mean anything, there are 44 seeds, so al least 44 people have completed it. why would i want to waste anyones time? Its easy to spot a fake, click on the user that posted and check other torrents."
,EchoRob,2007-09-27T15:25Z,"mrvidder as far as i can tell this is the torrent that was posted on demon - oid  if thats the case this is  not a fake, it's the real deal "
,barabusignasius,2007-09-27T19:28Z,"I was able to browse contents of image and it appears to be the real deal....however I could not, after following all suggestions from various places, get this to install on windowsXP.  As adam said earlier there is no windows installer on the image.
Thanks anyway adam666.  Im jealous of all you mac users messin around with thor as we speak :("
,mccoy88f,2007-09-27T22:30Z,"...

SO IS THIS THE FINAL VERSION???

..."
,biotech9,2007-09-27T23:08Z,Still no serial?
,Cain303,2007-09-28T00:43Z,"This image is only in HFS+ format, so it's just the Mac installer. Which makes me believe it's NOT the release. Also, the filedates are all from August which seem too old as well."
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T03:32Z,"I will just upload the Reason 4 disc iso it make it a lot easier for all you windows users

Yes, still no serial it will pop up no dout"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T03:45Z,thanks @EchoRob  ...Your a champ.   Still Im curious as to how you did it?
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T04:03Z,"I just burnt it on OS x with Disc Utilities as a disc image.

I will upload a windows friendly version ASAP"
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T04:04Z,by the way this is the real deal it's 100% final release
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T04:05Z,Just installing windows now to make sure it work's 100% before i upload it
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T08:59Z,"Thank you EchoRob, I've been looking for the windows version for hours... When/If I find a serial I will post it here first thing."
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T09:21Z,Indeed many thanks EchoRob...Did everything work out ok on the test run?
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T09:24Z,"@barabusignasius, It's been several hours since his last post, I guess we can only wait"
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T10:07Z,"Sorry everyone i have had computer troubles i will get the windows friendly version up ASAP

Once again my apologizes 

I will get the torrent up ASAP"
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T10:08Z,Hopefully by the time you guys download it we have a serial :)
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T10:18Z,"yes!!, Thanks again EchoRob, I really apprechiate that you take the time to do this."
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T11:55Z,"@EchoRob, where did you get your copy? another torrent site?"
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T12:31Z,"Yes, from Demono - id before it got shut down

I am having trouble with my imac's superdrive as soon as i get it sorted out i can make a windows version
I am get so fucked of with this fn mac "
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T12:35Z,"Ok, are you sure that you have the windows version also? I searched demono before but couldn't find one."
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T12:44Z,"no worries man...all in good time...Im really looking forward to the new sequencer. It looks sweet.  

@SadAnt....when did you search deminoyd?"
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T12:55Z,"well, only trough google's cached files of the site, but thats when I found the first OSX only torrent, like this one here, so I thought there was no windows version on that site. Of course it's not even close to search the site when it's up and running. And yes the sequencer looks great, have you been using reason for long? Ive been using it since V1 and rebirth before that, so im definatly stuck!"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T13:12Z,just about two years now.   
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T13:27Z,ok. what kind of music are you producing? I'm in to electronica
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T13:41Z,"all kinds of stuff...some electronica but more mixed up stuff some sampling and looping of live sounds and I also import some of my own guitar work into Dr rex.  Right now Im more into electronic stuff like Air and The Postal Service that mixes up live playing and electronic but also listen to and try and learn from stuff like Auechtre and Mouse On Mars and Squarepusher
and Funkstorung.  Also learning about about production techniques."
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T13:44Z,Manu Chao is one of my favorites in terms of production techs.  Like tons of looping all sorts of random samples around more traditional playing and singing.  And mixing all sorts of styles too.
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T15:22Z,"Ok, sounds nice. I wonder how things are going for EchoRob?"
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T17:11Z,"Guys i am so sorry my superdrive in my imac is not working and it's going to cost a fn $650 to fix stuff that  so i am just going to buy an external dvd burner i promise i;ll have the torrent up ASAP

I am still hopping we'll have a serial buy then "
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T17:33Z,"Don't worry about it, thank you for trying for all of us"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T18:37Z,just woke up.....sorry to hear about your computer troubles EchoRob..that totally sucks way more than me having to wait for this program.  Hope you get it sorted out and thanks for lookin out.
,EchoRob,2007-09-28T18:39Z,"Within the next 24 hours i should have it up 

I am still busting my guts trying to find a serial 

"
,SadAnt,2007-09-28T19:42Z,"@barabusignasius, Not trying to get to personal, but are you working as an artist with music, or is it more of a hobby that you only do on spare time?"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T20:11Z,"SadAnt...no..its just a hobby now.   I used to want to be a musician.  Now I just want to make music...; )   

But being as I can no longer work very much.   I have alot of spare time.  I guess i spend more time with music now then when I was trying to be a musician.   But its just a hobby now.  "
,barabusignasius,2007-09-28T20:19Z,"P.S.   I would buy this software if I could.  But Im broke as eff-all.  I couldnt even afford internet if I didnt pick up my neighbors wireless signal..hehe.
But this software is brilliant and I would definitely buy it if I ever had the oppportunity.

How bout you?  R you poor too?  :)"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-29T01:02Z,its weird that not one other torrent has appeared besides this one.  And with no serial..no one can even confirm that it works.   Whats the world coming too? 
,barabusignasius,2007-09-29T01:29Z,"so...there is a torrent claiming to be reason 4 for windows with serials.  However I am skeptical because it says its three discs.  I dont know, besides there is no seeder at the moment.  The torrent was posted today.  Heres the link

http://www.fulldls.com/torrent-app-75840.html"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-29T01:34Z,also the torrent is 2.17 gigs and has TPB listed as a tracker.  I think its reason 3.
,barabusignasius,2007-09-29T01:51Z,yup...the serial numbers are for reason 3...some bastard changed the name.
,EchoRob,2007-09-29T05:00Z,"This torrent works it's 100% real 

As soon as i can get a new dvd drive i will upload a windows version 

There is still no serial so we all have to just sit back and wait "
,barabusignasius,2007-09-29T06:18Z,"I cannot wait.

I am going to kill everyone in the world.

why?

No reason."
,oddy77,2007-09-29T20:05Z,Why this? I cannot wait to try this new Reason guys. Thor is waiting for us. Where´re the serials???????????????
,SadAnt,2007-09-29T20:29Z,"As I said at the other torrent ""@EchoRob, If you can install in vmWare, why not install a program on XP in VMware that makes an iso of the disc when it shows the windows files in vmware?"" Is there anyone who understood that? and if so, shouldn't this be possible?"
,morpe,2007-09-29T20:38Z,"see here:
http://www.crackserialkeygen.com/%22reason-4%22-Serial/warez/crack/torrent/%22reason-4%22-Serial.html

is possible fake?"
,thisdyingcause,2007-09-29T20:38Z,"I still would think you'd be able to see the Windows files in the dmg when opened in MagicISO.  This whole thing doesn't make a lot of sense, and I'm holding off until someone actually gets this working in Windows."
,thisdyingcause,2007-09-29T20:39Z,Probably morpe.  But I'm not going to be the one to try it :-P
,dave4712,2007-09-29T21:13Z,"files extracted with transmac,works fine,but no .exe ...

any way to get it started on xp?"
,barabusignasius,2007-09-30T03:20Z,"""AIR""   is exactly what we need"
,EchoRob,2007-09-30T04:52Z,"I have a reason 4 on dvd and it will install on windows i just can't do anything at the moment as my dvd drive is dead

i will be buying a new external drive when the shops reopen here its a god dammm long week end

Cheers!"
,barabusignasius,2007-10-01T21:15Z,Build 905 is supposedly the full release.  I cant confirm tht though...Id go with the scene release to be safe....although there is no confirmation yet on any of the scene sites that this is a legit release
,barabusignasius,2007-10-01T21:16Z,...At least not on any of the scene sites I have access to
,mrsirus,2007-10-01T21:16Z,Ok thanks very much i appreciate it.
,dedacia,2007-10-01T21:45Z,i dont understand. is it possible at all to make it work on PC?
,djtdon,2007-10-01T22:16Z,Why only mac releases? 
,thisdyingcause,2007-10-01T22:43Z,"No you'll need to download another torrent.  For some reason whoever ripped this originally only ripped the Mac portion of the disc.  Delete this if you've got Windows, it won't work."

,barabusignasius,2007-10-02T02:10Z,Does anyone know if Reason3 needs to first be un-installed before installing v4 
,EchoRob,2007-10-02T15:41Z,"Ender05, Open up the reason 4 disk .dmg then go to applications/utilities and select DISC UTILITIES then in the left side menu select the reason 4 .dmg and click the burn button top left 

Then you will be good to go."

I'm a little clueless and ended up wasting 3 dvd-rs.

Follow the advice of barabusignasius and google search 'how do I burn a .dmg to a disk, mac'.

The first link in the search should be from 'LifeHacker'. Follow the directions exactly and you 
should be good to go. 

G*d bless, lyndon20 for the serial,  barabusignasius for the advice and PB for the links! yeeeahaaww!!!!"
,crowaura,2007-10-04T21:43Z,"you have to burn a dvd, just copy the .dmg file and the Reason installs. It worked prefectly for me. We only need a serial number now! With Reason you can fire the drummer, guitarist and keyboard player. You need a techno geek to figure out the dayam program though, lol... Have fun"
,adam666,2007-10-05T01:25Z,"@mkhmkh: As i posted on the first page, you can install without burning to dvd with toast  titanium:

1.open toast.

3.click mount image file

5.open Reason 4, and let it copy the soundbanks across.

,orestes27,2007-10-05T15:11Z,"Hey for those who're still having trouble with installing this on a Mac here's a hint, so that you don't have to burn anything at all. You actually don't need to burn nothing, here're the steps(taking adam666 post as a starter!!):

@mkhmkh: As i posted on the first page, you can install without burning to dvd with toast titanium:

1.open toast.
2.under image file, select image file, select Reason4.dmg
3.click mount image file
4.In finder, drag reason folder to applications.
5.open Reason 4, and let it copy the soundbanks across.
*** this is the point at which everyone's getting stuck, because REASON asks you to insert the dvd again at this point, ok. You don't need to burn any dvd with whatever file just mount the image from toast again, and that'll be it--continue with the next step!!***
6. Enter serial number (a few pages back),
7.Enjoy reason and seed forever.

,assmblg09,2007-12-13T22:44Z,"hey everyone, i have mac osx and i was having similar problems with a lot of folks. i extracted the rar file, used toast to make a disc image of the reason.iso, then i mounted it, tried to copy it to my apps, then when i ran it from my apps, it asked me for the DVD!

okay problem solved:
this may not work for everyone but it worked for me and remember i have osx.
follow these steps:
1.)extract the .rar file
2.)simply change the .iso file extension to .dmg in Get info
3.)Use toast to mount directly (from the utilities toolbar) the .dmg file you just made
4.)Move Reason folder to your apps
5.)THEN try running Reason from your apps folder and you will not be prompted for the DVD! 

for some reason these steps worked perfectly for me. i think it was because i directly changed the file extension and/or mounting the .iso or .dmg DIRECTLY as opposed to making a DISC IMAGE. Hopefully this helps!"

That is it

,replica.acilper,2008-03-16T05:00Z,"Mac users, you do not need to download a another torrent for the Reason DVD, or another program like Toast to mount the disk image properly.

This is what I did, and it worked fine:

Open the Disk Utility program, which can be found under Applications>Utilities>Disk Utility.
Using this to burn the Reason4.dmg file to a dvd. (If you do it without the disk utility program or an equivalent, it will just burn a data dvd, pretty much the same as having the dmg file saved on a thumb drive). Now, take the dvd out and click on the Reason4.dmg file which is still on your computer, and open reason, drag it into the applications folder, and start reason. Now it will prompt you for the reason dvd. Insert your dvd and it should start installing. Use one of the serial numbers that have been posted amongst these comments.  "

,jayfoto,2008-11-13T18:26Z,"alright people. to install via mounting is a very simple process. trust me. as others have said before, it goes something like this... im making it as detailed as possible for those still having trouble.

**using toast (titanium). im pretty sure you can follow the same process in disk utility but im not 100%

First, OPEN TOAST and do NOT drag ANY files into the window like it suggests. Let it be.

Go to the exact location of the reason torrent and just click the reason 4.dmg file. It will mount it.

go to a FINDER window, select the Reason 4 DVD icon and DRAG the 'Reason' folder to your applications.

now, go back into Toast
Under 'Utilities,' select MOUNT DISK IMAGE. Locate the Reason 4.dmg file you downloaded and MOUNT THAT SHIT.

Now go to your APPLICATIONS, find the REASON folder you copied over, go into it, CLICK THE REASON ICON and it should copy itself ovah. 

I suggest removing any external drives as it may confuse the computer. Unless you want it installed there. 

"
,exekutioner,2008-11-17T16:53Z,"JayFotos idea seems to work....

I just mounted the image with disk utility, dragged reason to apps folder, 
THEN
I mounted the image in toast 9, went into the applications folder, opened the app, and it started the initialization process.
I then unmounted the Disk Utility and Toast Disk, 

And shits workin!

All to easy!"
,haarlem1982,2008-11-19T03:14Z,"@jayfoto:

i follow your steps, but as soon as i mount the disk image in toast titanium, i get an error message:

,asumthin,2008-12-08T19:39Z,"Hey everyone,
longtime TPB user, first time poster.

I'm having a lot of trouble installing Reason on my MacBook, just wondering if anyone else has run into the same problem/has a fix.

I burn the DVD, all legit looks perfect, mounts fine, recognizes it as the Reason DVD, copies over, but when I run the program, after a type the admin password another icon pops up, loads for a min then a get ""Repair build tool failed. Terminating Application"" and it closes. 
I tried a couple different torrents, I burned to DVD, mounted from .dmg, tried the new Reason 4.0.1......NADA!

Has anyone run into this?
By the way, Im running a MacBook Leopard, 10.5.5, 2.4 Intel, lots of ram....

HELP!!!"
,GeekyLady,2008-12-09T21:58Z,"Okay. Here is how you do this. 
The easy way is (and i found this out the hard way by trying just about everything.)
1) Download Toast (its not free, so get a torrent)

2) Mount the dmg file to toast. go Utilities>mount disk image>

3) It should appear on ur desktop. go ahead and double click it. drag Reason 4 in your applications folder.

4) go to your Applications folder on ur computer (dont open reason from the disk, because it wont load and will say that there is not enough space to copy the sound banks. and of course there is not, cuz its a dvd and it will think you want to copy soundbanks to the disc. so dont do this!)
open reason from your apps and let it copy sound banks over to your hard drive.

5) it will ask u for name, organization and licence #. licence no. is the serial. as for name & org enter whatever u like.
here are some serials people have posted (didnt find these. not claiming, just reposting. thanks to whoever made/found these)

,hgkjgfg,2009-12-06T07:09Z,"
For all the guys Who are in a struggle with ""Insert DVD"" message when you are trying to use Toast Titanium ? The reason ( sorry for tautology ) it doesn't work is that your disk image has ""writing"" accessibility so it is not like legit DVD with only ""read"" permission. 

So what you have to do is: cmd+i and change all permissions to ""read only"" and then do all the shit that suggested here and it should work.

All this: copy from there, close and past over there standing on one leg with another one behind your left ear while you have to walk around your Mac backwards in anti-clockwise direction is confusing bullshit. It should just work, Mac /Windows image doesn't matter it is a hybrid.

Enjoy!"

If this happens, unmount the dmg and import the dmg into toast.  Burn it onto a blank DVD-R or DVD+R.  Once that's done, insert the disc.  Reason will then register the disc and will ask for a serial number.  If this happens, just search ""reason 4 serial"" on google.  That's where I got mine.  Worked fine after that!  No problems.

,bou24,2012-03-16T09:47Z,downloaded and now trying to get it to work :)
,WPWYCPB,2012-06-02T16:21Z,"For those in need... it should come with soundbanks
1) place the soundbanks on your desktop
2) place the ""reason"" folder into applications
3) place the soundbanks in the reason folder (which is now in the applications)
4) select the 2 sound banks and reason and open them.
enjoy ;)"
