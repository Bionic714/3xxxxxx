Description:
=======
 Ex SYNCO member Frank Klare, JÃ¼rgen Kern and Dominik Ebert make up Traumklang. Of the 6 tracks on the album four are in the 10 to 20 minute bracket. ?Mystic Visions? is the (relatively) short but sweet opener presenting pin sharp sequences and some strong melodic embellishments. ?Oracle? opens in darker mood with electronic rhythms and percussion again dominating, and the latter half of the track serves up a feast of impressive sequences. ?Space Adventure (CD Mix)? indulges in some soothing atmospherics and delightful subliminal effects before unleashing an energetic sample-and-hold sequence which sits detached from the rest of the music creating an uneasy alliance. ?Rocking Starstorm? is a breezy uptempo synth workout and is the shortest track at 4:17. Laid back synths and effects get ?Sunrise Suite? underway before a short rhythmic section takes over. However, things sound a little half-hearted here and the laid back air soon returns to close the track. The album closes with the longest track ?The Omen? which clocks in at just over the 19 minute mark. Frank Klare had a hand in writing this piece and immediately it shows. Robust sequencing is the order of the day and thoughts of SYNCO easily come to mind. This track may not be all that subtle but it?s certainly effective. (GG)
