,fisher0065,2007-12-18T16:37Z,"at the end of the install it asks to reinsert disk one.  when i do, it just keeps asking for it.  I just shut don the installer from there and copied the crack, but it now still asks for the cd everytime i try to run it.  Whats up?"
,vii13,2008-02-26T20:17Z,"I had the same problem as fisher0065. I mounted with Daemon tools, installed, but had to quit installation. When I ran the install file again, it completely installed it, but kept alerting me to insert the disc. No worries, they can't all work for everybody. "
,TurderaFun,2008-05-27T10:06Z,same error =S
,TurderaFun,2008-05-27T10:24Z,"to solve the problem of the error you must have to push ctrl+alt+supr and search the  Ikernel.exe or something like this and kill the process.

So, crack the game or download another crack for www.gamecopyworld.com

Enjoy. :D"
