,jhonnytactic,2007-11-08T05:17Z,"I think you freaking kids need to slow down on the DT PRO downloading. There seems to be a virus with a lot of the Daemon Tools torrents. If you are downloading these check your computer for winupdater.exe process. If you have it go here to remove it.

Also I see from the Witcher game that you need DT Adv to create an IDE virtual drive to play your backup copy of your purchased game.

I can't find a working copy of DT Pro Advanced. If someone finds post it."
