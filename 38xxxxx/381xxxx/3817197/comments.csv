,roma_barca,2007-09-25T09:19Z,I can't believe that this full DVD does only contain 1 sub/idiomas... No french at all ? No russian ?
,Mazatec,2007-09-25T18:23Z,"Artleo: Nada que agradecer ;-) Y sí, sí tengo Que Viva México; la pondré en cuanto este torrent esté más maduro.

roma_barca: Here's how the languages go: original soundtrack in Spanish (with some English), over-dubbed in Russian, subtitles in English ONLY.... Yes, I am surprised too."
,roma_barca,2007-09-26T13:55Z,"thank you Mazatec for your answer. Sometimes people don't look at their torrent and forget to answer to comment/question. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN, MASTERWORK, even if i Que Viva Mexico ! completed would have been unbeatable ;-)"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-04-12T20:55Z,"Classic movie. Just like Que Viva Mexico, highly recommended. You don't get overviews of a nation like these two films. And no wonder it's Marxist. "
