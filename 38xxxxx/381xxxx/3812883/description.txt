Jacques Anquetil Ã¢?? The Man, the Mystery, the Legend 

This remarkable film penetrates the myth surrounding the five time winner of the Tour de France, who "did for cycling what Mozart did for music" ! Anquetil was a prococious talent, inventing a new style - rounded, aerodynamic and apparently easy - that was ahead of its time. Anquetil elevated time-trialling to a new level and set the standard for his generation. 

In addition to his many victories - Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Classics - it was his courage and his persistence that we discover in this superbly made film. It portrays a wonderful athlete but a very mysterious man. Haunted by the spectre of lonliness and death, superstitious and shy, the five time Tour de France winner was also a hell-raiser and bon viveur. Unique in cycling he could party, drink champagne, wine and spirits and smoke all night and then win a race the following day. Carefully researched and full of valuable first-hand accounts, notably from his first wife Janine, this film provides a fascinating and very moving insight into the myth surrounding one of cycling's greatest champions.
