SpeedFan monitors fan speeds, temperatures and voltages in computers with hardware monitor chips. It can even access S.M.A.R.T. info for those hard disks that support this feature and show hard disk temperatures too, if supported. It can even change the FSB on some hardware. At the lowest level, it is a hardware monitor software, but its main feature is that it can control fan speeds according to the temperatures inside your pc, thus reducing noise and power consumption.



-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
