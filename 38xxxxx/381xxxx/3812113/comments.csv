,titestef,2007-09-20T14:21Z,"this is the new mgm release (with english/french/spanish subtitles), it's 100% sure! but compressed with all special features... maybe (the original dvd is DVD9)"
,Majty,2007-09-21T01:18Z,I would like to know how compressed and what programs were used to do so. If it was dvd shrink there might be a bit pixelation :-/
,rposwe,2007-09-21T13:15Z,"Thanks for the upload, but its seems like many are stuck at 79.9%.
But i can wait, i really want this movie.
Its very hard to find this one on dvd.
So a BIG thank you bigbender."
,Lipservice,2007-10-05T20:47Z,"Burns and plays OK but is it is yet another 1 click rip (DVD Shrink) :( All extras/languages/FBI warnings/trailers/previews are on the disc. In other words a 1:1 rip of the retail DVD. I usually dump 1 click rips since they look like crap on my HDTV but I will keep this one for the simple reason it has an average bitrate (movie) of 4956kbps [1hr:31min movie]. If the movie were anywhere close to 2 hours it would look like s*it. I wish peeps would learn how to use decent DVD ripping, editing, and encoding software. And post a DECENT nfo file about their rips... IE how ripped and how encoded [what tools]. If I knew this was done with DVD Shrink I would never have bothered with it. 1 click programs are on the way out... FAST. Too many peeps have nice HDTVs now so piss poor 1 click rips look bad on them."
