,drughi,2007-10-03T22:45Z,itÂ´s not working
,ttwduke,2007-10-14T21:31Z,seemed to work fine but before the first scan was finished the registration key had been cancelled.
,zxchaosmunkixz,2007-10-23T10:12Z,"works, but right after I installed it, my AVG picked up a bunch of files in the Temp folder that were trojans and such. Why they would come with an anti spyware program is beyond me, but at least spyware doctor works now."

,erfah,2008-02-04T21:42Z,download the new version from the site and use the username + key 'n' it'll will work. it did for me. and all updates work aswell. you don't need any patch.
