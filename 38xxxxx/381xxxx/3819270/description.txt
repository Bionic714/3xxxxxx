Dirt-poor George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) lands himself a factory job thanks to a well-to-do uncle's largesse. Plagued by loneliness, George has a tryst with co-worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters). He forgets the uncultured Alice, though, when he's smitten with stunning socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). But Alice can't forget George -- she's expecting his baby. Their dilemma sets off a course of events that can only end in tragedy.
