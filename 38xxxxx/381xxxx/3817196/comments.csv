[V],cezen,2009-02-19T17:36Z,"May I make a suggestion?

Could you please add ""Homeschool"" and ""Educational Software"" to the tags and the title?

You can contact me at www.suprbay.org under the same name to ask me why etc or chew me out! 

Thank yoU!"

,44gambit44,2009-04-01T00:44Z,"i am seeding right now but you guys need to make sure you seed. this is an educational program and deserves to be shared as MUCH as possible. I am seeding right now aand it appears i am the only one. although I have already uploaded it like 7 times already :/   
so whoever is downloading right now remember that I am the reason you have the torrent-and you should share as well"
