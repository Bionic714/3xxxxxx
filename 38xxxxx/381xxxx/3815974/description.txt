Due to a continued threat from international terrorism and the enemy advancement within the last couple of years, Midas have taken up arms and are launching a second wave of attacks on the radical militia group intent on bringing the world to its knees.
To aid you on a series of missions, the Air Force has handed over the keys to the most technologically advanced wartime helicopters in their weaponry.

Take to the skies in hugely impressive attack helicopters, kitted out with an arsenal of devastating weapons including homing missiles and blind fire rockets, custom designed to obliterate ground units and unleash destruction on the unsuspecting enemy.

Use the heavy rescue helicopter to aid the safe pick up of friendly units and take on enemy tanks, gunboats and ground troops across 20 expansive missions in stunning 3D splendour.
