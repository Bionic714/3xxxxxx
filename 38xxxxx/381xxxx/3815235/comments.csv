,Zoracic,2007-09-23T07:41Z,"Please continue to seed when you get this. If you don't people won't bother sharing will they? We don't have the numbers of seeders like Die Hard 4 so the more that share the better for the few :-)

I'll continue to seed this for as long as I can to at least 5x."
,=Post@L=,2007-09-25T22:54Z,"Thanks for this. 

Appreciat the upload. I will download this now... hope you're still seeding. I will be seeding this for you then for quite a while."
,Zoracic,2007-09-26T19:20Z,"I've already seeded 27x but will continue until I upload Rohmer's Conte d'automne/Autumn Tale.

The other 2 Contes @ http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3780781 (Conte d'Hiver) & http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3792016/ (Conte de Printemps)"
