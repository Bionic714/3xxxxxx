,6StringRomance,2007-10-26T21:56Z,"What exactly is missing from this torrent?
Meaning, What is available on the missing dvds?

I have done the partial install that this torrent allows and everything seems to be working just fine; I have the ultrabeat drums and plenty of effects plug-ins, there are no audio loops but I don't need those anyway. I haven't opened soundtrack pro (or any application besides logic pro actually...) so I'm not really sure what I'm missing?

are there MORE effects and instruments for logic pro, located on those 7 extra dvds?"

So funktioniert Logic 8.0.1

Kopiere Logic 8.0 und Speicher die Kopie in einem anderen Ordner.
Danach mache ein Update auf 8.0.1 nach dem Update, gehe wieder auf Logic 8.0.1

,Bernarada,2007-12-19T02:26Z,"It seems he's saying there's a way to get the update to work using the 8.0 version. Roughly it says this. . .

Thus Logic 8.0.1 works.
Install Logic 8.0 
Mouse key left and display the package contents of Logic pro 8.0 
Open the contents/MacOS.
Copy Logic 8.0 and save the copy in another file.

Afterwards make an update on 8.0.1 to the update go again to Logic 8.0.1 
Mouse key left of package contents pointing from Logic 8.0.1 
Open Contents/MacOS

The first part is clear enough. The second, where I left a gap, is trickier to translate. We need to work on this. What anyone else understands of it, please share it. 



Now replace your copy of Logic 8. 0 with the file Mac OS with the version 8.0.1 "
,Bernarada,2007-12-19T02:29Z,"Opps, some of it got loss. Here it goes again...

,gherat,2007-12-19T16:44Z,"Ok people DON'T PANIC!! If you downloaded the update for logic and it doesn't start up without a new serial.. do this:

Install logic again and everythings perfect again.. even al the preferences are saved and everythings works just like their never was a problem..

Remember you can choose to just install logic so there's no need to install the whole package!!
I mean: when the installer menu comes to the point installation type (after reading the sofftware licence and choosing your install location), uncheck all boxes except the Logic Pro checkbox!!

And remember: do not download updates again, logic worked fine as it is!!

merry christmas and happy music making! :)"

,Symn,2008-11-20T21:59Z,"OK people, nevermind this download. I found out what the problem is and here it is: 

THE .DMG FILE IS CORRUPT.

This took me 2 months to download and find out >: ( 
This torrent is a total waste."
,MthrS,2009-02-01T22:03Z,"Thank you Lander16
That serial saved my weekend"
,markperseus,2009-04-14T19:14Z,"Hi, I downloaded this from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4566217/Logic-Pro-8-Mac-OsX-Serial-Full

..and managed to get it working using the serial number posted in the comments for this torrent.

Why is the one I downloaded only 200mb and this one 6gb? what extras does it come with?"
,gtivr6ftw,2009-08-21T06:38Z,"*******TO DOWNLOADERS: 

Finally downloaded after FOUR DAYS only to see that I also need multiple CDs containing the audio files. 
The discs can be found in RAR form by following some of the links in the comments, but only half of the 7 CDs have been torrented thus far (by pirateahr). Without the CDs, the program is crippled, it doesn't have Ultrabeats which is why I dl'd it in the first place. Know this before downloading. 

I will keep seeding at over 70kb/s for the next couple weeks for those who still want it."
,SIMPLES2009,2009-12-02T22:02Z,Give speeds!!!10 SEEDS and only 3.0 rocks Kbs
,rjohns06,2010-12-04T04:35Z,"Works great - This is how I did it. There is another torrent with just the Logic Pro 8.01 bare programs. I installed that first, then I down loarded the one here on this torrent, then I download jam pack updated from apples site direct 8.02. Guess what the program is complete and updated. I'm pumped I just installed to SATA 500 GB WD HDDS, 8GM of DDR1 PC3200 I'll never use a PC again.  "
