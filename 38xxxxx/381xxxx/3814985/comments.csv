,zapper_5000,2007-11-10T20:41Z,This is my second night trying to make this game run but no luck. It asks me to insert disk 1. I copied the crack exe file in the main folder but it doesnt run. It tells me that some dll files are missing. I found them and inserted them in the main folder but it still doesnt work. Can someone tell me a step by step way to run this game? Please.....
,jonbeee1,2007-11-11T19:16Z,"Gimme a second to download the game. Then I´m gonna see if I can install and if it works, I´ll describe the way to go. (It´s already been done above thou). 

As always, keep seeding after you´ve got the game. Dont stop up-loading right away... Thx"
,jonbeee1,2007-11-11T23:35Z,"Ok, this is how I did it:

1. When downloaded, you´ve got one file available. Extract it.

2. Open the folder and find ""Setup"". Start the setup. NOTE; There are several but only one working.

3. Use DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG

4. When installation is finnished, replace the age3.exe with the one from the ""Crack"" folder. 

5. Mount the image using Deamontools. NOTE: The image-icon isn´t the regular one, neither is the "".iso"" or "".bmp"" showned. The right file is the extraction-file named, ""Age Of Empires 3 full DVD +crack + serial"". It doesnt say .iso but thats the one. Mount it. 

6. Start the game and violá.


You probalby can mount that image right away. I guess both ways works.

Good luck and keep seeding."
,zapper_5000,2007-11-12T09:57Z,"Thanks a ton mate, i figured out what my problem was. I just had to copy the file from Crack folder to the c drive where the game was installed. Actually i tried that too earlier but since there was already a similar file there, i said no when the popup asked me to replace the file. Appriciate your help. I have a new problem now, i think i would need to upgrade my PC to play this game as the graphics are all messed up."
,Gardina,2007-11-16T02:23Z,"ok, I got this thing up and running but the graphics are all messed up and I cant fix it. Any ideas?"
,queef211,2007-11-17T06:40Z,"k. to the guy who made up those instructions (step by step).  I followed exactly what you said. but i have no idea what this ""image-icon"" that isn't a ISO or BMP.  The one that shows up for me is an ISO, so i am completely confused with that.  AND, after following your steps i still seem to be stuck at ""RockallDLL.dll"" cannot be found. wtf do i do man? this is getting retarded."
,ugaz.cruz,2007-11-21T21:08Z,"well... I dont have any problems to install the game, but the graphics are all messed up. I thoiught it was my pc... but I just changed ... and the problem is still there... any suggestions? "

,pipesmoke,2007-11-25T06:39Z,"ok so it works here are the steps but multiplayer dosent work if anyone knows how to make multiplayer work email me at strobbs77@gmail.com 

step 1

download the the torrent

step 2 

download the trial version of PowerISO(dont have too but need to for this guide)

step 3

Open the file you just downloaded with poweriso

step 3

look for the only file thats named setup.exe (there is only one setup.exe)

step 4

double click setup.exe

step 5

click the bullet that says extract all files to temporary folder(if you click run the file directly you will get an error)

step 6 

click OK(when you click ok it will start extracting. after its done the setup will open)

step 7

the setup will ask you for the cd key. the cd key is DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG

step 8 

install the game

step 9

go to my computer  then go to c drive then program files. there you will find a folder that says microsoft games inside that is age of empires 3 folder open that

step 10 

open the torrent with poweriso again(or just never close it)find the crack folder and open it

step 11 

drag the program age3.exe to the age of empires 3 folder

step 12

it will ask you if you want to over write say yes

step 13 

start the game and play!!!!!!!!!!!!

IMPORTANT:do not run the update or try to go online or it will mess up and you will have to redo all these steps over again.

this program dose work except for the fact there is no multiplayer i made the steps pretty easy so thee shouldnt be a problem. If you have questions or comments email me at strobbs77@gmail.com 

IF ANYONE GETS MULTIPLAYER TO WORK REPOST OR EMAIL ME PLEASE"
,deadskater01,2007-11-26T12:10Z,@pipesmoke  You cant get ANY multiplayer games that are cracked to play online its due to a CD KEY being used by someone who actually has the cd installed and most games check for a crack and if your using a crack you wont be able to play just be glad you have single player if you want multiplayer go buy it 
,Lusen2,2007-11-27T22:11Z,"Thanks pipesmoke... but, when i start the game it say's : Please ensert Ages of Empires |||:AOE ||| Disk 1

How do you explane that ?"
,neal_7,2007-12-09T20:54Z,"getting unknown file type!!!!! when i click downlaod torrent on the save/open screen on the left where it shows u what type of file it is, well mine says unknown file type!!! Need help!!
What do i need to have?"
,blakeelias,2007-12-15T23:39Z,"hey all u guys who have the problem that it says ""insert disk 1"", what u need to do is mount the ISO image (or burn to a disk, mounting is easier) and then the computer considers the ISO image as an actual CD drive, and the game will be able to run.  "
,Turtle9,2007-12-17T13:29Z,"That CD Key doesn't seem to work anymore...
does anyone know where I can find another one?
It might be because I had this game installed before but un-installed it...I'm not sure..."
,Lethal_Ranger,2007-12-22T04:07Z,"I'm using Daemon tools. 

I extracted the files to a new folder, then changed the .exe file like the instructions told me to.

Now, when I try to mount it again I can't select the file itself, it takes me into the file so I can find an .ISO file.

I'm sure this is easily fixed, but don't know what to do. Help please?"
,mixke123,2007-12-27T12:28Z,it keeps asking some disk 1. when i try to open it...i downloaded->mount image..i did install the game...on my desktop is icon but it keeps asking insert disk 1.
,IcarusBeDamned,2008-01-15T08:37Z,"Thanks!
I used pipesmoke's instructions, and I have just one thing to add.
To find the crack folder, after mounting the ISO etc, copy the ENTIRE ISO file into a new folder on your hard drive. Copy and paste the crack, then delete that folder.

Have fun!"

,VEpP,2008-01-21T20:40Z,"this is a very easy file.

its in .iso format straight away.

makes things a lot easier. 

all you have to do is mount the image, type in the given key, which is also posted in the comments here a ton of times, then copy the cracked exe into the game folder and replace.

its very simple and if you guys are experiencing problems, its on your end, not Devhour's."
,Steve00,2008-01-22T09:59Z,"With Daemon Tools, it's much easier to open."
,Steve00,2008-01-22T10:00Z,and install too but only what you have to do with Power Archive or WinRAR is open the file and there clik the crack and Extract it to the file where you have installed Age of Empire.
,orezzero,2008-01-28T08:52Z,"first off its a good game, it does work, but there is a few things to do before you can play. if you use the crack that is included in the crack folder you will still have problems. its for a seperate version of aoe3. 

http://www.gamerbeef.com/downloads-file-53-details.html

at this site you will need to register but it is free, but the crack does work. download, and extract to your age of empires 3 directory. 

i used ultraiso to burn the image to a single dvd. and during install it does not ask for aditional disks, like some other copys.  takes about 1.6gb drive space. 
if you plan on installing the expansion (not included) i recomend a fresh install, without the crack. after you install the expansion then you can add your crack for  aoe3 and aoex
hope this helps everyone"

,steffe_piratebay,2008-01-31T07:40Z,Can I use Deamon tools instead of power iso ? :)
,steffe_piratebay,2008-01-31T15:37Z,"Hi, I posted ""can i use with deamon tools?""  

I have the answer myself YES deamon tools is ready to mount =)  

I downloaded the file and its no virus. I can play without problems and i followed pipesmokes Help comment it works fine!!

Thanks for a nice file/game."
,ericIfromIsweden,2008-02-03T11:58Z,"Now, for all of you who are having problem with message showing up, saying ""Please insert cd1 bla bla bla"".
1. First DELETE any Age of empires 3 ""start game icon"" on your desktop.
2. Copy your crack to the folder you've installed the game in.
3. right click on your crack when its in the folder and choose ""create shortcut""
4. A shortcut will appear in the folder, drag that shortcut out to the desktop (or other place)
5. Start the game thrue the shortcut.
6. Play
7. Have fun
8. Win! :D

Hope that helped you out.

3. Choose where to install the game and install the game, always using Daemon tools to mount the 3 different ISO FILES

4. When the game is installed, mount ISO FILE 1 (CD 1) again. When it's mounted, go to the ""this computer"" section and ""explore"" CD 1. In CD 1 you will find a Crack file. Open it, copy the crack and replace the crack thumbnail with the uncracked thumbnail in the location you installed it in. 

5. If you have further questions, despite this awesome guide you're either retarded of suffering from a technical problem with your computer. Something i can't fix. "

,reuri,2008-07-10T01:05Z,"lol and somehow you people manage to download torrents.
amazing"
,Tomkris92,2008-07-12T00:17Z,How do i install do i have to extract it to winrar first? 
,Tomkris92,2008-07-12T00:21Z,aaah now i know. its not an ISO file!!!
,Rukica313,2008-07-13T21:14Z,"I got it to work, if anyone is having trouble here's what I did:

WARNING: The following step-by-step instructions are for extreme Rookies :P

1. Download this torrent, I use Utorrent for my downloads...
2. Download PowerISO from thepiratebay and install it.
3. The ISO file from this torrent should automatically open with PowerISO when you double click it (after you've installed PowerISO)
4. Create a folder on the desktop, name it whatever you'd like.
5. Extract everything from the ISO file into that folder, using PowerISO.
6. Go to the folder in which you extracted everything and find the setup.exe file, click on that and the game should start installing.
7. I was not asked for a serial key, so it installed right away. If it asks for a serial, it's DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG
8. After you installed the game, DO NOT RUN IT. Just click finish.
9. In the folder to which you extracted everything, there's a ""Crack"" folder. Open that folder and copy ""age3.exe"" then paste it onto the desktop. Leave it for now.
10. Go to C/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires III...in here you will find another age3.exe file (the original) which is like 8,170 KB (something like that)...Delete it.
11. Now keep this folder open, go to the desktop, and drag the age3.exe, that you made a copy of earlier, into the C/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires III folder.
12. Then just double click that age3.exe and the game should start without problems :)

By the way, I'm on vista so if this doesn't work for XP or w/e else you've got then...sorry. 

Enjoy!"
,gbgcity,2008-07-14T19:05Z,If you are an idiot buy the game then you dont have a problem to install it...  :)

Searched fro Age of Empires III and selected
Age of Empires 3 v1.12 [ENGLISH/GERMAN] No-CD/Fixed EXE

Put the crack in the directory and it works geatnow.  I love RTS games i also play Dawn of Wa but i like this one because DOW is mainly about building a battle command but AOE is about building colonies and empires so it's nice to have a change =-)

,malibutay,2008-08-07T19:12Z,I delete the original exe and replace with copy of the crack but it says. This application has failed to start because rockallDLL.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem. Any advice wold be much appriciated.

,Taley,2008-08-13T17:40Z,omg.... just before there was 30 sedders. i was up on 450+ kb/s.. and i only needed 30 secs to finnish.. then there only was 5 seeders and and now there was 1h to finnish XD

,Rukica313,2008-08-16T04:04Z,"I'll seed again...too many complaints.

Hint for the noobs:

If you're really into this game and want to raise your city's level but are having troubles winning battles... try the following

Put as many other computer players as you'd like in a scrimmage battle, choose the Caribbean map...when the game starts, build a dock as soon as you can, create a transport ship, put your explorer in it and take him to the remote island with the trade routes where no enemy will ever come since the AI is so stupid, there you can let your explorer build a new town center and start a new colony with the trade routes at your command...you'll win every game and gain 2 levels per game...which is the maximum. If you dont know where the island with the trade routes is... press Enter in the game...type ""x marks the spot"" and press enter again...this will reveal the map as fog, you will see the islands and where enemy town centers are located... you wont see the enemies tho...doesnt matter because you have all the time you need to slowly build your way up and win :)...have fun."

This whole thing works only becouse someone is seeding it for you, so when you are finished you have to seed for someone else. usualy your  download upload ratio must be 1:1.5. for more go on google and search: faster torrent there is some cool dude with specific instructions how to correctly foward your ports and he will tell you about seeding. that you will get even 700kb/s- I tried it and it works for me.

pipesmoke at 2007-11-25 06:39 CET: 

ok so it works here are the steps but multiplayer dosent work if anyone knows how to make multiplayer work email me at strobbs77@gmail.com 

step 1

download the the torrent

step 2 

download the trial version of PowerISO(dont have too but need to for this guide)

step 3

Open the file you just downloaded with poweriso

step 3

look for the only file thats named setup.exe (there is only one setup.exe)

step 4

double click setup.exe

step 5

click the bullet that says extract all files to temporary folder(if you click run the file directly you will get an error)

step 6 

click OK(when you click ok it will start extracting. after its done the setup will open)

step 7

the setup will ask you for the cd key. the cd key is DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG

step 8 

install the game

step 9

go to my computer then go to c drive then program files. there you will find a folder that says microsoft games inside that is age of empires 3 folder open that

step 10 

open the torrent with poweriso again(or just never close it)find the crack folder and open it

step 11 

drag the program age3.exe to the age of empires 3 folder

step 12

it will ask you if you want to over write say yes

step 13 

start the game and play!!!!!!!!!!!!

IMPORTANT:do not run the update or try to go online or it will mess up and you will have to redo all these steps over again.

this program dose work except for the fact there is no multiplayer i made the steps pretty easy so thee shouldnt be a problem. If you have questions or comments email me at strobbs77@gmail.com 

IF ANYONE GETS MULTIPLAYER TO WORK REPOST OR EMAIL ME PLEASE "

i only have space in local disk d wat should i do and by the way does it work with magic iso"
,Bruinsmab,2010-01-08T14:39Z,Got it in 2 hours! Awesome torrent!
,daddyphatsax304,2010-01-09T16:21Z,"GUYS SERIOUSLY...

IM GONNA TRY AND ANSWER A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS I NOTICED THAT SEEMED TO BE REPEATED OVER AND OVER....

FIRST THINGS FIRST....
THIS GAME WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO PLAY ONLINE! U MUST HAVE A VALID CD KEY TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT ON THE ONLINE SERVER.
I HAVE NOT FOUND NOR HAVE I HEARD OF A VALID KEY GENERATOR FOR THIS GAME EITHER SO IF SOMEONE FINDS IT PLZ POST HERE AFTER TESTING IT.

SECONDLY EVERYONE THAT IS GETTING THE PLEASE INSERT DISK 1 MSG NEEDS TO GO BACK AND READ THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THESE COMMENTS ON HOW TO INSTALL THE CRACKED .EXE FILE.  IT IS VERY EASY JUST REPLACE THE .EXE IN THE GAME FOLDER AFTER INSTALLATION WITH THE CRACKED .EXE. IT WILL ASK U IF U WANT TO OVERWRITE AND U SAY YES.

NEXTLY...THIS GAME IS MADE BY MICROSOFT AND I COULD NEVER GET IT TO WORK WITH VISTA.  I SAW ONE POST THAT SOMEONE GOT IT TO WORK WITH VISTA BUT MAJORITY RULES AND THIS GAME PRETTY MUCH WILL NOT WORK WITH VISTA.

IF U FIGURED OUT HOW TO DOWNLOAD A GAME AND INSTALL IT IM SURE U CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DOWNLOAD WINDOWS XP AND INSTALL IT AS WELL.  LOL

LASTLY...IF U GET ANY ERRORS DURING INSTALLATION THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON. I OWN THE REAL GAME AND GET ERRORS ON INSTALL JUST UNINSTALL AND START OVER.  IF IT STILL CONTINUES THEN U MAY NEED TO DELETE UR DOWNLOAD AND REDOWNLOAD.

ALL AND ALL PRETTY SIMPLE AND A VERY FUN GAME EVEN WITHOUT ONLINE PLAY.  LAN OPTIONS STILL FUNCTION SO U CAN PLAY AGAINST OTHER PPL ON UR NETWORK.

HAVE FUN AND DONT FORGET TO SEED!!"
,brandsy,2010-01-15T16:04Z,"Dont know what daddyphatsax is going on about coz i have vista followed the instructions and everything went well. the only thing was a message that came before i first played the game saying that this game has known compatibilitie issues but i havent noticed anything wrong yet, but maybe its diffrent for other people. thanks for upload works great"
,adam1white,2010-01-18T00:50Z,"installed fine but when i go to run it, it asks for the age of empires III disc one, i make sure it is mounted but it still comes up with this message.???"

,boz123,2010-01-25T10:07Z,"Guys, I downloaded the torrent, works fine on Win 7 Ultimate. However, you will experience difficulty with the graphics (colored triangles). *To solve that problem go to Help and Options in the game menu and go to ""Graphics Options"" and choose LOW Shader Settings. 

Multiplayer won't work. Also if you save a game and load it the next time you play, there will be a GAME PAUSED and you can not get rid of that, plus you can not update this game....

,slashchat,2010-01-29T14:43Z,"dont download this, fiend one torrent with addons, warchiefs and some addon with asian stuff. its 3gb big."
,froggz,2010-01-29T19:01Z,"Ok, for some reason people using piratebay don't actually know how to install a game...

Its not hard.

Follow instructions given in the .NFO File. 

Download Power ISO, Magic ISO, Alcohol 120%, Daemon tools. use either of them to mount the disk. If it doesn't auto run go to my computer and double click the new virtual CD drive which will have the AOE3 Symbol on it.

This will load the installation. There should be no errors whilst installing if there is then this torrent is a bad upload and the crack obviously doesn't work. 

Once installed, open the .ISO file you downloaded find the folder labled ""Crack"" Inside this folder will be a .exe file labled AOE3 or similar cut this file, and then paste into the install directory. c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age Of Empires 3

Paste into there and replace existing.

Double click either the .exe file in that folder or the desktop one. If you are using Vista or win 7 and you find that it does not run, runs without sound or runs with glitchy graphics. Update sound drivers, graphics drivers. Right click the .exe on Desktop go to properties and then compatibility and change to Xp Service Pack 3. This will run perfectly on any OS from XP onwards you just need to know how to use it!"
,slashchat,2010-01-30T05:06Z,download age of empires with 2 addons not this crap
,DocEvil,2010-01-30T14:07Z,"1) Works fine with vista. Perhaps you should update your system if you can't get it to work.

2) Why would this game need to edit the registry? Yeah, I blocked it just incase."
,boz123,2010-02-05T10:22Z,I read some of these posts for saving the game. It does not work for me. I run Win 7 Ultimate and the game works but when I want to save it and play the next time I can't get it to Unpause.....anyone know why?

If it says you need to put CD in you need a crack

for RARs use winRaR.

Simple and easy to install just follow instructions. If your not a good reader and you just don't bother to read the instructions in the comments, Then don't blame anyone for it not working. THANKS FOR THE TORRENT! :)"
,00adspro00,2010-03-13T15:16Z,"By the way if anyone wants to know how i got it working on vista i do not know, I just downloaded and done all instructions and it works like a charm!.. same with other games like flight simulator for some reason all the games that say ""DOES NOT WORK ON VISTA"" works on my computer and by the way ive got really bad graphics card but i still played gta4 on the computer. Thanks again.

And for those you STILL don't know how to do this it's easy
1. Download
2.if you don't already have power iso DOWNLOAD IT NOW
3. once installed power iso the file should be a yellow disk image DOUBLE click it. it will come up as all these files. (just click continue unregisterd)
4. Click setup.exe and it will say extract files to temp folders? or something like that click extract now. don't click anything else. AND WAIT TILL IT EXTRACTS.
5. a setup screen will pop up (if your on vista took me about 15 secnds) click continue blah blah and then use the cd key earthblade told you all (if your blind and missed it) DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG
6. let it set up once done go back to poweriso file and click the crack folder SHOWN ON THE SCREEN.
7. extract the exe file to your desktop and once it's extracted RIGHT CLICK AND CLICK COPY.
Go to my computer C:, program files and then microsoft games. click age of empires 3 ( DO NO CLICK PLAY YET ) and paist the file that you copyed ( THE CRACK) in there it will ask if you wnat to over write click YES and if your on vista it will come up a permission screen.
then your done.. any problems don't ask me cause ive just explained in the best way i could go bother someone else. :) hope it works for all of you!"
,trom2004,2010-03-15T05:01Z,"The lack of support for Windows7 means minor graphical glitches (not generally noticeable), some annoying mouse control (moderately annoying), and the autopause on game start. The autopause is solved by pressing the objectives/menu button then exitting with ESC key. Install a virtualmachine using VirtualPC or VirtualBox or VMWare with windows xp, or use an older pc."

,chee154,2010-03-31T01:12Z,"How To Install: 

1. Download (of course.....)

2. Download any ISO mounting tool (ie. I use PowerISO Virtual Drive Manager)

3. After installing, mount the ISO ""Age of Empires 3 full DVD+crack+serial"" onto a virtual drive 

4. After mounting, a folder should open (will automatically open, may take a few seconds), and click on the thing that says ""setup"" (.exe file).

5. Click on ""setup"", and it will run the extraction

6. After extracting, it will automatically run the game installation, run through the instructions given

7. When you get asked for the CD Key use ""DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG"" (just copy and paste each segment)

8. After you install.... DON'T PLAY YET YOU'RE NOT DONE!!!!

9. At this point go to your (C:) drive or whatever drive you installed into, and find the folder ""Program Files"". Open that then find the folder labeled ""Microsoft Games""

10. If you closed the ISO, open it again and find the folder labeled ""Crack""

11. Copy the icon ""age3"" from the ""Crack"" folder and paste it into your ""Microsoft Games"" folder 

12. It should ask you if you want to overwrite the existing folder; SAY YES!!! 

13. After that, now you can play.

This program dose work except for the fact there is no multiplayer I made the steps pretty easy so thee shouldnt be a problem. If you stil have any questions regarding how to install... figure it out yourself."

With max settings the background on the menu screen looked jittery like it wasn't going to run well, but loading up the game prooved otherwise. AA high and not a single hiccup in the short time I played. I can't see my FPS in Afterburner though. I'm assuming thats because I'm running it for xp service pack 2.

It was jittery and such because my driver would crash upon launch, causing my 260 to throttle down to low perf 3d mode. The problem eventually went away on its own, with the very odd crash here and there (reboot and retrying is the fix as it's in my case, the driver.)

1)Goto this website http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=3144B72B-B4F2-46DA-B4B6-C5D7485F2B42&displaylang=en

2) On that website download the msxmlcab.exe file which is atm 4th from the top on the list

3)Save the file and put it on your desktop.

4) Extract the file to your desktop that you just downloaded and you should have 4 msxml files

5)Now you can either copy or cut and paste them into your C:\Windows\system32 Folder

6)Once done you need to open up your run command if you don't know how well then your a noob but here >Start>All Programs>Accessories>Run

7)Next you need to type this line into the command line and click ok:
regsvr32 C:\windows\system32\msxml4.dll

8)After thats all done it should start up with no problem and I was able to fix it so it runs on Windows 7 32bit and 64bit."

,ForbiddenSoul,2011-07-07T08:38Z,"I'm in the same boat as you bowlinwes300, as having purchased the game previously, and had it stolen. As for your noob ass question... this is a torrent file get some torrent client to download it ie. uTorrent or whatever the hell they call Azureus these days. After that you will have downloaded a standard .iso file. This is a binary image of a CD/DVD, you can burn this to DVD with what ever burning software you like or mount it to a virual CD/DVD drive using a program like Daemon Tools Lite. I havn't finished downloading the torrent yet, so I don't know if there is an issue launching because of copy protection, if there is open the DVD by right clicking and look for a folder thats out of place. It's most likely called ____ (what you would do to an egg before cooking it) Cheers =P"

BUT the crack joke you tried to insert was a fail sorry. I've read the crack and still have a hard time figuring out how to make a dvd/cd clone, thats mostly my issue because I don't want to waste my disc with a burn when that too is something I'm new at too, I'm not stupid just ignorant to how this works and how I can get skilled enough to not have to ask for help from a person thats too much of a jerk to simply say ""you should start by....."" and fill in the rest with something useful to a begginer. now if you've a rebutle that doesn't include trying to insult me in someway then awesome, otherwise any help from anyone is still appreciated.

 go to the folder named crack. in the folder there are two files. one of them is a piratehat.

,KallumTanton,2011-09-04T14:56Z,"Hey guys, any help here'd be great. For starters, I'm not a noob but no Bill Gates either, I know what I'm doing. I've downloaded hundreds of games that all require the same thing (mount, install, crack and play) and I've had this one before. However, for some reason, when I try to run the game it asks me for the serial again. I thought this was strange but followed along. I entered it but it said it was not valid. I followed the instructions, anyone any idea?

Like I said, I'm no noob if anyone wants to ask my anything, I'm not totally useless :) It's just this one little problem that noone else seems to have had, I'll retrace my steps and see what I can do.

Also, there seems to be a lot of people that can't do the main stuff, here's what I know:
1- Download using a torrent client (I use uTorrent)
2- Go to your downloads folder and find ""Age Of Empires 3 full DVD +crack + serial.iso""
3- Use Daemon Tools Lite (or any other virtual drive manager). Most managers will allow you to right click it's icon at the bottom right (notification area), select a virtual drive and then ""mount"". You want to mount the above mentioned file. Take a note of the drive letter (E/F/G etc)
4- Go into ""Computer"" or ""My Computer"" and OPEN that drive. Run the file ""setup.exe (Don't close Computer)
5- Follow the installer, and enter the serial found in the ""Crack"" folder in the drive when asked.
6- When the install is complete, head back to the ""Crack"" folder and copy the file ""age3"". Then, go into wherever you installed the game, usually ""C:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires III"", and then paste the file.
7- Run the game from the desktop icon and voila :) It should work, but like I said, mine doesn't, hope all goes well for everyone!

Kallum."
,KallumTanton,2011-09-04T15:04Z,"@EV0Ltage

When the compatibility warning comes up, try clicking the ""Find solution online"" (or whatever it says) and see if that can give you any info on your system. Other than that, right click the icon, go to ""Compatibility"" and try to run it in ""Compatibility Mode"" for an older Operating System, like Windows Vista or XP (assuming you're using Windows 7). If that doesn't work, try ticking some of those other boxes and starting it, see if this helps you :)

,KShelbrock2,2012-04-10T03:48Z,"@ icewolf72

have you tried using a IP Blocker like peerblocker? ive never gotten a single notification on any downloads. "
,KShelbrock2,2012-04-10T03:52Z,"because most of the stings come from outside agencies like colleges and the FCC, not individuals on the site. they run stack IP traces on the individual download link and watch streaming activity, an IP blocker will prevent any outside source from pinging your host modem without you initiating first. so only the links you actually click on will allow communication, not the people who are piggy backing off of it.  "
,KingOlii,2012-04-11T13:39Z,"Can anyone tell me if this works on Windows 7? It says that it may not be compatible with my service pack.
Also, once I've burned one of the AOE.exe files to CD and installed it, it says 'please insert disk 1' any suggestions?"
,him999,2012-04-17T19:44Z,"I never understood the notice thing, I've never gotten a notice by comcast about anything ever... besides when i don't pay the bill... I've heard that Comcast in my state is pretty awesome compared to many other places though (PA, where the HQ is so... yea....) "
,Swollenfish,2012-04-21T18:39Z,"If anyone believes any of this ""I got a warning from my ISP"" bullcrap then you should get off the internet. It's just trolls posting, trying to scare you. It's the same thing on quite a few other downloads as well."

,adrian4408,2012-04-30T14:41Z,"NoNeX2 I was having the same problem, works now though. 

Don't use auto play just open the disc & run setup manually, simple but for some reason it did the trick"

,icewolf72,2012-05-11T03:11Z,"It's me again, the one who got the Notice from Comcast in the mail about this .iso I guess it's from keeping it on your Torrent list too long, cuz I got another notice from some porn too. I wish I could Seed, but that got me in trouble.

This torrent works btw, low system requirements too."
,Sniper_A_Fool,2012-05-31T23:29Z,"I don't want to get off topic, but I got about 5 emails from comcast for a really old torrent I left on my computer but never used. Want to dl this but also be careful. Someone told me comcast tracks your illegal downloads by uploading the file from your comp. Is that true or do they track you by what you actually download?"
