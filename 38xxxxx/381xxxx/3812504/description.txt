El Topo' is Jodorowsky's Masterpiece !! Incredible movie making, some people just write this movie off. I think that is a totally closed mind of approach to this fascinating film.Even if you hate it,you have to admit the power of the film, great imagery.Alejandro did a great job,this movie is a real labor of love,it deserves rediscovery.One of the greatest films of the seventies,unforgettable is the only way to sum it up.
