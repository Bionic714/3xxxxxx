,lannypantsmom,2008-05-21T06:29Z,"It took a bit for me to get the hang of it... Its such a big file... and i had to downlaod an RAR extracter and then a different program UltraISO to burn the seasons but the quality is amazing and the videos are great... Thank you and if you use this seed it... It took a good 9 hours to get these episodes, so please everyone help each other out!...
My two year old is now content... thankfully"

,RiversideDude,2009-12-17T10:17Z,"I am glad to have these episodes, but whoever did this should be shot.   They ripped them from dvd, then put them into Nero, used a generic menu, and instead of making them different titles, made them different chapters.  Then they took that and made it into an iso.  Then broke it up into rar files. Why?  Just why?

Otherwise, I and my little one love the show."

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-11-03T17:10Z,"xposer -instead of bein a neanderthal why not help-given you are clearly an expert! nero is also a joke
the 3 torrent tools are 
auto gordian knot used with dvd shrink to rip dvds
convertxtodvd to burn,nero is just a box of bells & whistles with a 30 % success rate where converttodvdx has a 99% rate! while rars are a dial up tool,perhaps the uploader has a small hard drive & cant support the full file ."
,Jason310M,2012-03-24T18:56Z,I know RARS! Big fucking deal. Go cry me a river xposya
