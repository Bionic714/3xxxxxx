Foundations in Microbiology
by Kathleen Park Talaro, Arthur Talaro



Book Description
Written with the non-major/allied health student in mind, the authors use common, everyday analogies to explain the many difficult microbiology concepts. Unlike any other allied health microbiology textbook on the market, the art program showcases beautiful illustrations with the use of bold, primary colors. A taxonomic approach is used for the study of pathogens.
