,Soundmanred,2007-09-26T04:48Z,"It's called Dragon Wars.
Plural.
With an ""s"" on the end.
Dragon War is a game."
,tassiegrl,2007-09-29T17:09Z,Has anybody downloaded this yet? This is D-War isn't it?
,Trashclown,2007-10-08T01:09Z,"More information about the torrent is always nice.
Like if it's CAM, TS, TC, R5, XviD or the likes.

And maybe a plot outline so we can know if it's the movie we're looking for. (some poeple mix up the names of movies and therefore confuse the downloaders.)"
