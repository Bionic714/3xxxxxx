Release Notes:

Band of Horses, known early in its life as simply
Horses, is an American indie rock band formed in
Seattle by Ben Bridwell, Mat Brooke, Creighton
Barrett and Rob Hampton, who were joined in
February 2006 by Joe Arnone. They are currently
signed to Sub Pop Records. The band often draws
comparisons to the indie rock band My Morning
Jacket largely due to the vocal similarities
between Bridwell and My Morning Jacket lead singer
Jim James. Bridwell's vocals have also been
compared to Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction,
early Neil Young, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming
Lips by All Music Guide.[1]

Band of Horses was formed by Ben Bridwell (guitar,
vocals) and Mat Brooke (guitar) in 2004 after the
break-up of their previous band, Carissa's Wierd.
The group initially got attention from Sub Pop
records after opening for Iron & Wine in Seattle
area shows. In 2005, the band released their debut
EP, Band of Horses Tour EP, which was sold
exclusively at shows and on Sub Pop's website.
Their debut full-length, Everything All the Time
was recorded in 2005 with producer Phil Ek and
released on March 21, 2006 to generally good
reviews.[2]

On July 13, 2006, Band of Horses appeared on the
Late Show with David Letterman sans Brooke. As of
July 25, 2006, Mat Brooke left Band of Horses [3]
to focus more on his other band, Grand Archives,
who had also signed to Sub Pop.[4]

The band's second album, Cease to Begin, is slated
for release on October 9 2007.
