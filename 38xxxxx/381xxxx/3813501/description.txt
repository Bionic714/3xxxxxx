                          Anonymity 4 Proxy v2.8
                                And Crack



Anonymity 4 Proxy is a special local proxy server (which you install on your own computer), operating a large database of anonymous public proxy servers located all over the world. This program stands between your browser and the Internet, redirecting all requests for web pages to the proxy servers and making you anonymous to the websites you are visiting.

It can also be used for other purposes. Webmasters can check how their websites look from other countries and how fast they load; system administrators can see if their servers are available from the outside of the corporate network. Anybody can avoid network congestions by using a proxy - you can quickly choose the fastest route to any site with the Check URL feature. Non-anonymous proxies are supported as well, so if all you want is a convenient manager of proxy servers, this is your choice.

Added in the latest version:

* Long-awaited export feature allows you to use the proxies in other programs and share them with your friends. You can export all proxies, only good ones, or just the ones you select.

* Enhanced proxy import engine. Now you can import proxies automatically from local files, local folders (i.e., by telling the program to import all files located in a particular folder), or directly from the web (just give the program the URL of the page with a proxy list). In the latter case, A4Proxy downloads the page anonymously, using the same proxy settings you selected for surfing.
