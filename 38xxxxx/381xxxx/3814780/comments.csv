,NDog,2008-09-15T08:34Z,"Why didn't you just say that this is taken from a Windows XP Pro i386\LANG folder?

Your claim to ""Convert any English only xp into multi language xp"" is not true, as their are files in the i386 folder that are still needed to add multi-language functionality to windows XP.

If you don't believe me, download MicroXP and tinyxp ver09 from eXPerience, and try to add korean support. It won't work simpy by adding the lang folder to those iso's.

Anyway, I hope you can make a true pack that would add multi-language to a package like microXP and tinyXP. And I mean ability to type in unicode characters and the file system allows to view unicode encoded file names and folders.

Good luck"
