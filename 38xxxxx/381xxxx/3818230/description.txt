This is an addendum to the "Chomsky Books" torrent in which it wasn't included.  It contains the anthology "Understanding Power - The Indispensable Chomsky", compiled by Peter R. Mitchell and John Schoeffel and published in 2002.  Most of the material is from informal seminar-style discussions with groups of activists or from question and answer periods after public talks.

This anthology is one of the best introductions to Chomsky's political thinking.  Included are the book in .pdf, .rtf and Microsoft .doc format and the web-based footnotes in .pdf format.  Regrettably, Ch. 1 of the book is missing.
