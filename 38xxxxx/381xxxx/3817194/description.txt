     Ã?  In The Settlers VI: Rise Of An Empire, the player builds lively, 
     Ã?  bustling towns in a medieval world. Everything is visible, 
     Ã?  lovingly animated and realistic. Each settler has his or her own 
     Ã?  daily routine, with a range of different actions and behaviours 
     Ã?  that can be observed by the player at all times. This enables 
     Ã?  him to get the best out of his Settlers, build up a flourishing 
     Ã?  economy, tend to his settlers' needs, and protect his empire 
     Ã?  against danger from the outside. By expanding his empire, the 
     Ã?  player can aspire to becoming a legendary king or queen.
     Ã?  
     Ã?  The most popular features of the predecessors in the series have 
     Ã?  been retained, and many of the fans desires and wishes were 
     Ã?  incorporated into the new game to create a very special Settlers 
     Ã?  atmosphere. The result is a realistic medieval world, captured 
     Ã?  in intricate detail. The game features an immersive, yet 
     Ã?  transparent economic system based on the resources, wares and 
     Ã?  goods produced by the settlers in their various trades and 
     Ã?  occupations.
