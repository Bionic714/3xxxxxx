,janisan,2008-03-11T06:38Z,"""the user is not allowed to run settlers rise of an empire due to the parental control settings"" and i was like wtf? installation went fine and i copyed the patch files to the bin dir. and overwrited the files. but still this message came up, i didn't run any updates, tried to start the game directly from the bin dir.

Anyone with answers would be great :)

I also noticed that u have to keep the installation file u mount in order to play the game, or else u will get the ""please insert cd"" notice"
,whiddett,2008-03-18T17:02Z,Where do I find the patch dir mentioned in part 4 of the install instructions? I mounted this download with Daemon Tools but there is no directory in the download called Patch (that I can see). Is he referring to the other FIX download?

,mr_andy,2008-11-17T00:28Z,"This is how you make it work:

*Unpack it using winrar or some other program. I used winrar.

*Mount with latest Daemon Tools. I used Daemon tools lite 4.11.2 and it worked.

*Install the game

*Copy and overwrite the files from the Patch dir to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\THE SETTLERS - Rise of an Empire\base\bin   depending on where you installed it.

*Now do not use the standard startbutton, instead go to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\THE SETTLERS - Rise of an Empire\base\bin  folder and there you'll find an exe file called Settlers6.exe. Use that one and that's it.

If you by mistake started it with the wrong button so it tells you to put in the CD don't reinstall the game to fix it. Just go to the mounted CD and find the bin files and copy them all to the folder you installed the game. Then just press the right button this time xD and play =)

Hope this helps =D"
,mr_andy,2008-11-17T00:46Z,"Many people have experienced crashes when trying to play the game. Here I come with an solution.

(If you can't start them game even then follow my previous instructions)

Just patch the game to 1.6 using this site http://www.fz.se/spel/the-settlers-rise-of-an-empire/pc

But doing only that will make the game realise you are playing with cracked game. However by going into the installed folder C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\THE SETTLERS - Rise of an Empire\base\bin and deleting TagesClient.dat and TagesClient.exe.
After that play the game and Enjoy =)"
,mr_andy,2008-11-17T00:50Z,"Sry for my terrible spelling, but hey I'm only half English xD and only 17
Hope you understand my instructions though. If not just write to my email. Mr_andy91@hotmail.com"
,mr_andy,2008-11-17T02:23Z,"I forgot to write one thing!
You have to have the Settler CD mounted to play the game. That was all folks. Peace out"
,LawaBoy,2009-01-29T22:35Z,"To make it work copy the files over from the patch folder to the base\bin folder, start up the game try playing and make it crash. Then go delete the cld.dll from the base\bin folder and it will work, well atleast it did for me :D"
,leo_meen,2009-03-14T05:23Z,"Installation is all fine for me, but when i play the game the vidoe is black, i can hear only voices, but cant see any places. when i go to options and video, there all the settings are at the starting point, when i set it to default, the game is crashing and closing.... some one plzzzz help, i have downloaded many versions and im facing the same problem.....plzzzzzz help"
