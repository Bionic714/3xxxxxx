[T],splattergod,2007-09-26T03:51Z,"I saw this...it's a documentary about Newark, New Jersey.
It's a total shithole, alright, but the docu is pretty boring, except the part where they showed the homeless guy with his dick stuck in a cats ear."
,icminternational,2007-09-26T21:22Z,"splatter, this isn;t the same one you say you saw... these are actual people in the documentary who went to Hell and returned by the Grace of God to share their experience. May it bless you."

If you're a brainless minion who constantly needs to be reminded to not think then this'll be perfect for you - otherwise avoid it as you'll surely be reaching for a blunt stick within the first five seconds of the ""documentary."""
