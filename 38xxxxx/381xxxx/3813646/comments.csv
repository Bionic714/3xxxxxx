,some0neX,2008-01-22T20:20Z,is this the english version?
,chaucerchris,2009-02-27T04:18Z,This version is out of date and load of shit. I have already downloaded this from Isohunt and it doesn't fucking work. I wish old out of date torrents were removed. I had to install the non english version in order to enter the key. The englsh version dosen't give you the option and you can't update unless you're a registered user. As I've said it's a load of shit and not wotth the download time. 
,chaucerchris,2009-02-28T00:16Z,"There is no such such version of Expressivo 10.5 If you bother to visit the Expressivo website you will see that their newest version of this program is, 1.4.6 

Current versions of this program can be found on some torrent sites, however the closest you will get is version 1.4.2 You can do an update to the most up to date version of expressivo but any voice from your previous install will be blocked. Bolocks! lol I tried. So untill someone comes up with the latest update that is working I'd say leave this alone."
