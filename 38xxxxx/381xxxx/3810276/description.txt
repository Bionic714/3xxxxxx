The evil uber-zombie Nemesis is on your trail and determined to hunt you down in the classic, horror-filled gameplay of RESIDENT EVIL 3: Nemesis from Capcom. This time around you play as S.T.A.R.S. member Jill Valentine (who appeared in the first RESIDENT EVIL game), and she must do all she can to survive in Raccoon City while being stalked by the fearsome Nemesis. You'll fight and explore your way through the zombie-infested metropolis in an attempt to bring to light important information you've gathered about the Umbrella Corporation and their ties to the horrible outbreak of putrid undead. A new 180-degree "quick turn" scheme has been added, as well as a handy "side-step" move to aid you in avoiding your deadly foes. You can change between Jill's eight outfits, test your skills in Time Attack mode, and blast scores of zombies and other depraved undead creatures with your sidearms of destruction. In RESIDENT EVIL 3: Nemesis for the Dreamcast, a rotting world of danger, mayhem, and creepy action awaits.
