,SalLimones,2008-01-26T04:26Z,Don't bother downloading anything posted by this dumb-fuck. All his uploads are missing one part of the archive.
,canilive,2008-02-24T08:26Z,Can someone confirm this working? I have DLed this about 3 times and NONE of them have worked. Thanks.
,canilive,2008-02-24T08:27Z,P.S. Not from here or other torrents but elsewhere. (I do not know how and if you can edit one of your posts).
,canilive,2008-02-24T10:28Z,Extracted fine for me. Use winrar to extract if it says it is corrupt (happened to me with 7zip at first).
,enchanting_luv,2008-03-27T05:36Z,"can someone please tell me how to burn this. i tried to unpack it with winrar, but it says it's not a supported file type. same thing goes for discjuggler, alcohol,and nero. can anyone help? "
