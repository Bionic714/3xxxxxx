,Mortukai,2009-04-07T18:19Z,I wish more people would rip to flac.  I have this CD and it's scratched on the last track.  If I could even just get that track in flac I would put the entire cd up for grabs.
,alicedowntherabbithole,2011-03-15T20:33Z,Thank you very much
,freedomdwarf,2011-04-28T18:30Z,"Why FLAC???
It's useless unless your playing it on a computer!
MP3 is more versatile and I can copy it direct to CD or any MP3 player to play it as well as my PC.
If it's FLAC, I have to covert the friggin thing before I can do anything with it.
Decent MP3@320 is perfectly good for 99.99% of most human ears coz most people couldn't hear the difference."
