,fjellnisse,2007-09-18T22:01Z,That doesnt answear my question.. Im going to burn this to a CD but CloneCD cant understand that theres 3 files needed in order for this to work when you boot.. And burning just the image (the big file) nothing happends
,Blackhand101,2007-09-18T22:07Z,"there is no difference
it is just that this torrent has more trackers and info "

dont be complaining about seeding 275 people are seeding

in clone cd be sure to burn the .ccd file 

yes xp pro looks like home but it has increased security

i dont know about the WGA it works is all i know 

i dont know which program to use in mac but as i said you can use any program that will burn .ccd files or .img i  am not familiar with other programs

all i know is when you select the .ccd file in clone cd it burns correctly

"
,Blackhand101,2007-09-25T00:14Z,"when u open the .ccd file in magic iso it shows you all the contents of the .img file

1.Change the .img extension to .bin

3. Right-click on the disc and select 'Toast It' and let Toast burn the image to CD for you.

Simple as that."

AVG didn't detect it until it was too late. PrevX detected the spawns but could not eradicate the original virus because it was locked into the Master Boot Record.

I had to fdisk /mbr from a DOS floppy and reinstall Windows from a known ""good"" boot CD. I may have been able to use this CD to boot from, use recovery console, and used XPs version FIXMBR. But since the CD was infected at the boot level, I may have been out of luck.

Well, I couldn't load the image with disk utility, it told me that it doesn't recognize this image.

But, mac users

1) open Toast
2) drag image.img onto Toast

@ PCweenie4 - Dude, I know very well that Dell's tend to suck.  It's why I have a mac.  I'm only doing this for a friend who isn't very computer savy.  T.T sucks for me.  "

Folks, you are right. My ""solution"" is not a solution at all. Toast burns the image.img, but the CD ""cannot be read by this computer"".

I have another solution you can try, but I have no empty CD to try it myself, and it is Sunday, so I can't but one. If you try it, please post the results. Okay, here goes:

1. rename ""image.img"" to ""image.bin"" (simply change the extension)
2. Create a plain text file and paste this:
FILE ""IMAGE.BIN"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE2/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00
3. Save this file as ""image.cue"" in the same directory as image.bin
4. Open Toast
5. Choose ""Copy"" (not ""Data"")
6. Under Copy choose ""Bin/Cue-Files"" (not ""Image-Files"")
7. Drag ""image.cue"" onto Toast (don't drag ""image.bin"")
8. Burn

Let me know."
,8475647476574,2007-09-30T21:13Z,"Edit:

I am using Q to install Windows XP, and I just tried the following:

2. open Toast
3. choose ""Copy"" > ""Image-Files""
4. drag ""image.bin"" onto Toast
5. click ""mount image""
6. install XP from the virtual image

This seems to work in Q: the intallation started, but I killed Q, because I don't want to install Windows on this computer. Maybe it works in Parallels or other emulations too?"
,8475647476574,2007-09-30T21:36Z,"Oops, I made a mistake in my last post.

Instead of:

4. drag ""image.bin"" onto Toast

you need to:

4. click ""Select ..."" and select the ""image.bin"" file

Don't burn the CD. Simply rename the .img file to .dmg, then mount the image with Toast (I have version 7). Then install from the mounted image, which appears as a CD in a CD-ROM drive.

As I said, it worked very well for me.

After i enter the cd key and the files are preparing to be installed I get an error message saying i am missing a file ""ayvb28s6.sys"" it asks if you want to retry, skip, or exit.

,AlphaOmegaaaa,2007-11-04T13:29Z,"I wanted to use this version to format my system drive and make a clean install of windows.

When i boot with this cd, I don't get any option to format my hdd, it only gives me the option of installing another version on the same disk (thus not formatting or deleting anythign) or to install on another disk.

I even tried to hook up an old hdd i had lying around (an empty one), made that my IDE master and installed windows on that one. I booted through that windows and tried the format function in cmd but apparently it was still my system drive.


How can I solve this????

,Syraxius,2007-12-01T21:42Z,"for those unable to use windows update (probably all of us), there's a workaround

there's a software known as ""autopatcher"". basically it's the entire windowsupdate, offline mode

it's approx 400mb and lets you choose what to install and what not to install, exactly like windowsupdate

you'll need:
1) autopatcher august core (approx 300mb)
2) autopatcher august addon (approx 30mb)
3) autopatcher august update (approx 30mb)

(yes it's stuck in august because the team got some issues from microsoft)

these are the two best mirrors:
http://autopatcher.jtymes.net/
http://ap.cruza.org/

install core, then addon, then update. then launch the program and weee :D

for more background info, read here:

But when trying to boot from the CD to install the entire OS (on another computer) all I get to see is ""Press any key to boot from CD.."" so I press space, and then ""Checking your computer [...]"" (don't remember the exact message) and then it all goes blank until the CD stops spinning a few minutes later.

Anyone know what's wrong? The CD-RW? The torrent? The CD drive? Something else?"
,rpk1974,2007-12-25T19:41Z,"@nillli

Although you see the auto run setup when you put it in your other PC it may still be corrupt. Do a force recheck on your torrent to make sure you really downloaded 100% of it. "

Clicked that, and then I chose to upgrade as recommended, rather than to do a new installation. 
I chose to check updates, and then it started copying installation files.
suddenly as the green bar is nearly filled up, a file copy error comes up.
It says that the file au7779kx.sys was missing when the setup tried to copy it to c:\$WIN_NT$.~BT\au7779kx.sys.
If I click skip, it restarts my computer, and then an option comes up about which OS to boot. 
I can either boot Windows XP, or Windows XP setup. The setup starts but fails, with the same message, saying that the file au7779kx.sys is missing.

The same thing happened when I just mounted the .ccd using daemon tools earlier. I just burned the cd casue that's what everyone seems to say is working.

HELP PLEASE!

3. Set Automatic Update to notify but do not install (not windows update, not by website, just by Automatic updates)
4. Installed Windows update 3.1 via Automatic update (includes WGA)
5. Rebooted

- Change the file image.img to image.bin.  The other two files won't be needed.
- Insert a blank CD-R (NOT CD-RW)
- Open Toast (I'm using Toast 8, and from the Utilities Menu, select Mount Disc Image, and choose the bin file.  (It should now show up on your desktop as a CD with a name something like  ""VRMPVOL_EN"")
-Next, click this mounted CD image and drag it to the Toast icon.  
- From toast, choose COPY (dont choose DATA)
- I burned it at 2x, but I dont know it this is necessary
- After the CD has been burned, open Parallels
- Choose Windows Express
- Keep clicking continue
- Enter in DP7CM-PD6MC-6BKXT-M8JJ6-RPXGJ
- Insert your CD, and click install.  

Works like a charm.  Thanks Blackhand101"

ccd2iso should be in the repos of most distributions."
,omniking3,2008-03-03T01:28Z,"ok, people. I know there are many people looking to use this for boot camp and such. In order to do this, you need to make it an iso. Here is a short, full proof guide for the Mac OS 10.5.2.

1) go here and get ccd2iso: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccd2iso/

2) un-tarball it and put it in your root directory.

3) open a terminal window and type the following commands. DO NOT COPY AND PASTE!

cd /ccd2iso-0.3

./configure

make

Note: you may need to download macports to use make. After doing this, type ""cd src"" to move into the new source directory. In a finder window, place the file ""image.img"" from this torrent into the src folder. Now, back in the terminal, type:

./ccd2iso image.img windows.iso

It will have a stream of numbers run, and when it reaches ""297932 sector written"" and it says Done.

Then, back in finder, you will find a file called windows.iso

Have fun. This is the same method used for linux, incidentally. This is a darwinport."
,omniking3,2008-03-03T01:32Z,"i forgot to mention, while in that src directory, just type:

hdiutil burn windows.iso

,sparrowhawk13,2008-03-08T04:01Z,"If you're using a Mac and are unable to convert/burn this file using any of the above methods (I was not able to) than this should work for you:


1. Download free Burn application (http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/).
(note that any burning software that recognizes .bin files will work)

2. Rename your x.IMG file to x.BIN
(did you know that CloneCD .img files are really just disguised .bin files?  Now you do.)

3. Create a plain text file and paste this:

FILE ""x.BIN"" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE2/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

Replace x.BIN with the-name-of-your-bin-file.BIN
(if you are using TextEdit, you have to go to: ""Format > Make Plain Text"" in order to save in .txt format.  The default .rtf format will not work)

4. Save this in the same directory as your .BIN file.

5. Change the extension of this text file from .txt to .cue

6. Open the .cue in the Copy tab of Burn.app

7. Press Burn.

8. You're done!"

Tried changing the .img to a .bin and copying that file to a CD - no luck.

Tried MOUNTING the .img file as both a .img AND a .bin, which results in a mounted volume full of the Windows install stuff on my desktop, then burned that to a CD - 3 times. Nothing. Not recognised by Boot Camp as an install disc.

Tried converting it to an .iso and burning that to a disc - both the raw ISO and the mounted volume - again no luck.

Any help would be appreciated because I'm about ready to give up on this idea altogether."

,anonymous5868301,2008-03-12T19:41Z,"Sorted it out, finally. Here's the step-by-step guide for people with Leopard MacBooks, at least. I used Toast 8, so I've no idea if it works with other burning apps.

1. Rename the file 'image.img' to 'image.bin'

2. Open Toast and select the Utilities menu. Select Mount Disc Image from the dropdown menu.

3. Mount the file 'image.bin' and it should appear on your desktop as a mounted CD called VRMPOL_EN.

4. Drag this mounted CD to the Toast icon in the Dock.

5. Be sure DISC COPY in the COPY main menu of the Toast GUI is highlighted.

6. Click the red burn button in the lower right hand corner of the app and set it to burn at the lowest speed of 1X. 

7. Once it's burned, open Boot Camp Assistant, set up your partition and select Install Windows. If it recognises your CD as a Windows Install Disc, you're on the right path.

8. From the moment it restarts, hold down the 'C' key on your keyboard. Nothing else worked with me; I just got a black DOS prompt with a blinking cursor with no input from my keyboard.

9. Windows installation should now begin."

for Linux dual boot users... i personally have this OS dual booted with Mandriva 2007 on my desktop, and i used GRUB bootloader, works like a champ.

to the people who can't figure out how to burn this, you are just flat out retarded. i went through comments and people were talking about CloneCD and whatnot, and i just googled the .img file format, and went from there. Google is a very powerful tool, and it gives you the world at your fingertips. if you're competent enough and figured out how to use TPB (that's this website to the retards out there) and download torrents, then it shouldn't be that big of a deal to figure out how to make this torrent work.  My God, some of you look like you are monkeys trying to fuck a doorknob.  i'm about half tempted to post my  P.O. box number and have you retards send me two blank cd's and i'll burn you a copy of this fucker and send it back to you... the second blank disc is payment for me doing it... i'm sure some of you fucktards can't even figure that one out.

to all of you guys (and gals) who have rolled their eyes and posted step by step instructions on how to fuck said doorknob, i appreciate all that you've done. 

To the people who have successfully installed this OS on OSX/bootcamp, congratulations. now you can play games in windows format, but yet, you're still hunting for the right mouse button. God Bless You.

I'm not dogging the intelligent people out there, all you guys are awesome. Now, for the incompetent retards out there who can't figure out the difference between a floppy and a cd drive, i hope you all are slapped with a strong pimp hand, and pointed in the path of pirate righteousness. 

KEEP SEEDING THIS ONE!!!

this is 32 bit.  if this were 64 bit windows, it would say in the torrent 

""Windows XP Professional x64"".. that means it's 64 bit!! 

but this one, since this only says ""Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2"".. i would honestly say this is ... you guessed it... Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2. 

i've said it twice now, and i'll say it a few more times...

did i mention that this is 32 bit?

here's a little something for y'alls (yes i'm southern) to snack on..  it will install on a 64 bit system... my system is the AMD Athlon X2 5500 (dual 64 bit cores) and it installed!!! like, OMG. 

I'll tell you now, i have a purchased System Builder's copy of XP x64, and it blows goats. it functions a lot like Windows Server 2003, so that means only about 40% of your games and software will not install on x64. 

i ripped it out and installed this OS because my vinyl graphics software would not install, (and this REALLY pissed me off) Adobe CS3 Master Collection would not install either. I live for InDesign and Illustrator, because it is used with my business (vinyl graphics and signs/billboards) and i couldn't use it... 

you bet your ass i contacted Microsoft and gave them hell because i had over $10,000 in software *cough*pirated*cough* and not a fucking thing would work.  so you're telling me you want a 64 bit operating system?? fuck, give me a mailing address and i'll send you mine.

1.) Download the RAR file.
2.) Figure out some way to extract the RAR file.

,enjoyMath,2008-03-25T07:21Z,"Install went smoothly.  Going to stick Slackware on my box as well, so I installed Windows to a 13GB FAT partition.

Important points: 
+ I used the original key from the torrent description (DP7CM-PD6MC-6BKXT-M8JJ6-RPXGJ).  
+ During setup I enabled Automatic Updates.
+ Windows restarted and I logged in just fine.  I immediately downloaded AVG's free virus scanner, updated the virus database, and ran a full diagnostic.  It did not find any viruses.
+ I installed updates through Automatic Update and rebooted.

The reboot went find and currently Windows is downloading more updates, which is taking forever, which makes sense because I would imagine there are some fairly substantial things that need to be updated.  Long story short, I couldn't really find anything wrong or suspicious about this Torrent and everything worked without a program.

Of course, this does not mean that there is not some lurking virus.  I did only use a free Scanner after all.  But so far this thing has passed my initial inspection with flying colors."

I was using shitty vista, because it's what my laptop came with, so i wanted to get this awesome torrent. 
would the downgrade do anything to the internet? i really can't see how it would.

does anyone who has problems connecting to the net have vista prior to installing this torrent?

Would it make sense that I need to somehow find a way to update windows before the internet would work? is that possible to do w/o connecting to the net?

1. Rename the file 'image.img' to 'image.bin'

2. Open Toast and select the Utilities menu. Select Mount Disc Image from the dropdown menu.

3. Mount the file 'image.bin' and it should appear on your desktop as a mounted CD called VRMPOL_EN.

4. Drag this mounted CD to the Toast icon in the Dock.

5. Be sure DISC COPY in the COPY main menu of the Toast GUI is highlighted.

6. Click the red burn button in the lower right hand corner of the app and set it to burn at the lowest speed of 1X. 

7. Once it's burned, open Boot Camp Assistant, set up your partition and select Install Windows. If it recognises your CD as a Windows Install Disc, you're on the right path.

8. From the moment it restarts, hold down the 'C' key on your keyboard. Nothing else worked with me; I just got a black DOS prompt with a blinking cursor with no input from my keyboard.

2. Then when you're about to burn it, choose the file called ""image.ccd"", not the big ""image.img"" file like I did when I first tried to burn it.

i'm glad to see that less and less of you incompetent retards out there are asking stupid questions... 

To the one about the administrator password... use ""ULTIMATE BOOT CD"" and erase the password. retard.

once again.... this is a 32 bit operating system.

once again... no viruses. scanned with six different AV apps: Norton, avast, AVG, Kaspersky, Comodo, and NOD32.

once again.. use the key in the description.

once again... this version fully updates.

once again... CHECK COMPATIBILITY BEFORE DOWNGRADING FROM VISTA!!!!!

if you have any other questions or complaints because you don't know how to install windows, GOOGLE IT.

cheers."

,prophetsearcher,2008-05-06T18:06Z,"thanks for the terrific torrent -
im using it with parallels/leopard

i managed to install it in Parallels (after burning it to CD) - but during installation i got warnings that two components were missing:
msgsvc.dll and
msthml.dll

The only 2 complications I've encounter have been the inability to run IE and the inability to open my User & Accounts tab in Control Panel, though I don't know if these are related problems.

Has anyone else noticed these missing components? Is it a problem? Is there an easy fix?

Thanks again."

I used burncdcc to burn the iso image to a CD disk, placed it in my computer, set up to boot from cd-rom. After installing it click do not update. I went thru a hundred blue screen errors before I figured out what it was I was doing wrong. After xp loads go to control panel automatic updates and click ""notify me but dont automatically download or install them"". When the pop up shows up on your toolbar that update are ready click ok to download them (should be like 3.1 update). After its downloaded restart the computer. Then when it says they are ready to install click custom install to pick and choose which ones you want to install and make sure not to click the WGA install (i think towards the bottom) I also didnt install Internet explorer 7 update (read it somewhere not too) I use firefox anyways. You will be all set...I pulled my hair out with blue screen errors until I found out why I was getting them and ""missing files"". Hope this helps SOME of you."

First of all Thank You VERY VERY much to the people who helped the incompetent people....

You guys need to write it down check it about 10 times then make sure you type it in right then check it again 10 times

people with BSOD (blue screen of death):
i have this on AT LEAST 6 systems and have not ran into a BSOD unless there was something wrong with hardware

People having Problems With Cd Burning:
As you have seen on comments (if you even tried to look) i have an Iso version of this torrent 
though not heavily seeded it still downloads

people who bitch about seeding....:
Wait a couple days till leechers go away!
This torrent has over 600 seeds STOP BITCHING!

To all who have wondered where i was:
1 Busy with my game making studio
2 Busy playing video games
3 Busy Making my WoW private server
4 And of course Busy with boring life

I will try to be more devoted to this torrent as i see there are many incompetent retards

To people who left a minus rating on this torrent:
Get a life! read the instructions and comments

To People with MAC bootcamp:
Get a life! use windows it OWNS!

to people with vista:
be sure to back up your stuff and check for compatibility... You might want to upgrade to vista ultimate it is better than any of them 
(bill gate's  way to make you spend more money!)

Message to all:

Blackhand, Welcome back from your sabbatical.  there are quite a few retards who can't seem to get this working, but once again, there are hundreds who can! 

I have been seeding this on a broadband connection for a few months now, and i have successfully uploaded 38.4 GB of this torrent, and i don't plan on stopping anytime soon. I would like to thank all of the other seeders who make this happen. 

As to all the incompetent retards out there who cannot get this fucker to work, GO BUY IT... it would probably be easier on you because you're too stupid to read directions... but once you buy it you might have to ask your momma to take the plastic wrapper off the box because you can't even figure that out, but OH NO, you know how to post retarded comments on TPB.

,TYHThanatos,2008-05-26T12:56Z,"PLEASE READ:
I downloaded this version of XP because when I went to switch back from Shitsta (Vista is you are really slow) my wga fixes on my old XP cd were not working...
Anyways so I install it and everything works great it even passes the pre-windows update check and gives me the option to either install sp3 or customize my install...

Now to the point: Once I installed all my programs (exception ones that need post-windows update) and windows update finished installing sp3 (forgive me if there is some obvious reason why I shouldn't have done this...it seemed perfectly logical atm) I restarted my computer. upon restart I go to login and I get this: Windows Product Activation - ""A Problem is preventing Windows from accurately checking the license for this computer. Error Code: 0x80004005""

Any ideas...I found a forum [http://www.anetforums.com/posts.aspx?ThreadIndex=27591] that suggested I go into cmdprompt (I can login fine in safe mode) and  regsvr32 a bunch of dll files but this did nothing...I am not sure what is causing this problem but I am going to try reformatting and this time not installing Sp3 - anyways just in case I get the same problem or there are other people reading this that are having the same problems please give me your feedback...I will msg back in a couple of hours to tell you guys how it went..."
,Rohen,2008-05-26T14:17Z,"I tried dual booting this with Ubuntu... It totally messed up my Ubuntu install (i think thats normal with Windows) but I can't access my BIOS!!!

Does anyone have the same problem?"
,TYHThanatos,2008-05-26T15:32Z,"IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ:
Okay guys, it looks like SP3 (Service Pack 3) was the problem - if you install SP3 when you go into Windows Update it will lock up your computer (see my previous comment)...unless there is some way to customize exactly what SP3 installs (which to the best of my knowledge there isn't). 

So here is what you do: (Sorry it isn't step by step but this is what I remember doing)
-Open up windows update (you will, of course, have to ""update"" windows update first) and follow the instructions
-DO NOT EVER HIT EXPRESS if the option is given, ALWAYS HIT CUSTOM
-Eventually you will get to a screen asking you if you want to install Service Pack 3 - You DO NOT want to INSTALL SP3! 
-There are two options, choose the lower one (something along the lines of ""review other updates"")
-Continue following instructions:If a screen gives you the option to customize the install in any way , always choose to customize it.
-Now you will be asked to ""update"" windows update...again... After this you will be told to restart; do it.
-After the restart, open up windows update again and follow the instructions - again CHOOSE TO CUSTOMIZE the updates...
-A screen should pop up with several pages of updates - each of them having a checkbox to the left of them.
-Find Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) [IE7 is right above WGA]
---I am not sure why but I read somewhere not to install IE7 - I am just recapping what I did.---
-UNcheck the boxes next to both of these and customize the rest of the windows update as you see fit (or just hit the green button to the left of ""install updates"") 
--Newbs: I strongly recommend that you click on ""Hardware, Optional (##)"" and check all of the boxes.--
-Once you hit install updates, a screen will come up showing you ALL of the updates (this is so you can review what updates you are installing) - Just hit Install Updates button at the top underneath ""Review and Install Updates"" and follow the on screen instructions...

That is it - sorry if I had to dumb it down too much (and sorry it isn't detailed enough newbies) but I wanted to make it as easy to follow as possible.
Cheers and Happy Sailing,
-Thanatos

P.S. If anyone knows a solution to the SP3 issues please feel free to post and completely debunk what I have said"
,Blackhand101,2008-05-28T03:45Z,"ok incompetent sp3 retards........
SP2 has anything u will need i mean why even go for sp3???  sp2 is soooo stable!
there is just a bunch of crap in sp3
no need for it!"
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-05-28T05:03Z,"Exactly, Blackhand. if you're smart, stay away from SP3. when you first install this torrent DO NOT enable automatic updates. when it's completely done after installing all of your drivers and whatnot, just go to the windows update website and do a MANUAL download of everything except for SP3... Service Pack 3 is just a rollup of all of the updates from SP2 till now, except for a few minor ones... it's a fucking hassle to work with SP3.. it's not going to ""red flag"" this copy, or is it going to alert microsoft that you're running a pirated copy of XP, its just a pain in the ass. everyone is having issues with it. i even disable automatic updates on my legit operating systems, and, being a systems admin, i do the same on the rest of the computers i work on in my building. i just do a manual update every saturday when the building is empty. 

This is BY FAR the best XP torrent on TPB to date.

keep up the good work, blackhand, and i hope you get more torrents up soon!!"

There's also a slew of Linux machines as well... i do not, have not, and will not dual boot any of these machines... why defract from the purity of them? it's bullshit.

by the way, i have successfully uploaded 61.4 GB of this torrent, and it is still running strong on  five machines here at my house, including an Asus Eee PC (i don't consider the Eee a computer... it's a turd with a screen)."

This seems as a viable download, but I'm in a unique situation in which I have a hard time finding a solution.

Y'see, I've just bought a MacBook Pro and I want to install this Windows with the help of the Bootcamp Utility - Firstly, I've got problems mounting it since the Mac OX has a hard time reading Windows based .img files.

Secondly, Clone CD isn't compatible with Mac's operative system - I've instead downloaded Toast 9 Premium, but as of currently, I don't know how to proceed.

Should I burn the three unpacked files onto a DVD and will that DVD then be bootable?

Or do I need additional mounting?

Any help would be appreciated :)

gee, that's really odd because everything worked beautifully when i did the first install of this OS... didn't have a single problem... and if you're even halfway intelligent, you're gonna have a driver cd for your motherboard and cards when you reformat...

,maza13,2008-07-23T09:12Z,"@ roy_0008, you don't have to reinstall Windows to get that back. Go to the Control Panel, then go to Add/Remove programs. When that window comes up look on the left hand side for a tab that says Add/Remove Windows Components. Scroll down until you find Games, and reinstall them. It might ask for the Windows CD that came with your PC/Laptop. As for MS Paint, you probably didn't delete the program. Go to C:Windows/System32 and look for MSPaint.exe and then place a shortcut of that where ever you want it or need it."
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-07-24T09:07Z,"avdlay... YOU IDIOT!

this is NOT.. i repeat NOT... MCE2005. you need a MCE2005 disk to do a repair of MCE2005. 

the key provided will work when you do a CLEAN INSTALL with this disk.

as for the retards asking so many god damn questions about USB drives and whatnot..  yes, if your motherboard has a USB port or four on it, you can IN FACT use your usb ports after the installation is complete. this IS NOT a shit version of ""windows on a stick"" that some of the other incompetent fucks have posted that you can install windows from a flash drive.. those installs do not pass WGA, have no drivers, and are made for playing serious amounts of solitaire on.

,Tigeypoo,2008-08-09T14:30Z,"@ rl010

Since I'm pretty sure this torrent burnt to a disc will not allow you to erase a newer version of windows off of a partition, google GParted and download it.

Burn GParted to a disc and boot with it, use it to clear out the partition containing windows vista. Install windows xp on the fresh clean partition.

If you need more detailed instructions, mail me at predator16417@gmail.com"
,GlimDanten,2008-08-11T01:45Z,"rl010:

Put the CD in. Then press whatever key (F12 for me) it is when the computer is booting up to choose where to boot from. Choose the CD-Drive. From there, it will ask you to install XP. It will detect windows (I think), so just delete all the partitions and install."

Excellent Torrent Blackhand101 "
,l0uds0undz,2008-08-11T10:23Z,"Ok let me help u guys out a little.
First of all i relise alot of people can't get this torrent to work, well in order to burn this u need a DVD RW. Using IsoPower....If u don't have a DVD RW than you need a External DVD RW!
Ok, in either of these open PowerIso, Locate the Imgfile, i put my speed at 16x worked fine! 
Tip:
I think the speed really matters!
Plus if u are using a External DVD once ur finished burning the file... once u want to instal windows xp make sure the cd u burned stays put in the external dvd! u have to instal the windows xp sp2 setup from ur external dvd, and that's because you don't have a DVD RW in ur Local disk drive.
Ok heres the link to download FULL POWER ISO:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3818759/Power_Iso_3.8_(no_virus(down_loaded_fron_Power_iso__s_webp

I like this torrent works! includs key and every information to make it full version. plus no virus its cleaned i gave it a shot.

See u! good luck"

It's a very good torrent as far as I've seen , I uh, was wondering if anyone has a link or a way for me to get updates to work on this though. I can download the updates but when my computer shuts down, it jsut sits there for awhile tryign to install the updates. If I'm on my compute rlong enough, it will try to install them and fail.  I wouldn't really worry about it, but I have a new zune, which was the reason I downloaded windows XP. I cannot use my zune without 1 or two of the updates. Any help would be very much appreciated!

When you put the only file that can be puted in the write image of both system (A120& and CloneCD) you will see that when the program will start to burn it becames a almos 600MB file. So when you put the .CCD file to burn he put the other files with it. Problems NO MORE PEOPLE !!!

Hope you guys can get it right !

100% CLEAN AND NO MISSING FILES !!!

Thanks again Blackhand101 !!!"

,WagnerGM,2008-08-26T13:07Z,"What ?!

No ! You just need to do this steps:

1. Get the program (the RAR) to you PC.
2. Extract the RAR to Desktop, if you like create a New Folder with the name Windows XP.
3. Get CLONE CD or Alcohol 120%. (Clone CD ->  http://static.slysoft.com/SetupCloneCD5313.exe
4. Go to Image Burn or Burn Image...
5. Select the .ccd (the ""only"" file that can be burned) and put the file to burn. He will make the other files to go with him in the CD so don't worry.
6. Burn a CD-ROM (80min or 700mb)
7. FINISHED !!!! YOU GOT A BOOTABLE WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL, or you got to do is put in your CD drive and Install (another story to tell).

Give a thanks to Blackhand101 !"

Ofcourse, the easiest solution should be to ask a PC-friend to burn it with clone cd. But that'll take some time.

I've bought a CD-R cd, and tried the mac-specific walkthroughs here. I've renamed the Image.img file to Image.bin, but can't come anywhere from that point. 
Tried Toast>Utilities>Mount Disc Image.. on the .bin file, but then is says: ""Couldn't complete the last command because of a Mac OS Error (Result Code=192)"". 
Tried to select the .bin file and to click Mount, but nothing happens. And when I finally decided to click the darn Burn-button anyway (from Copy/Image file), it gives me a non-functional CD (that can't be read by the computer). Now I can try again tomorrow (I'll buy another cd then). 

Any suggestions?  

(and I think I read somewhere in the comments that only this .img or .bin-file is enough, and that the other two files are not necessary. What are they for?)"

As explained you only need to select the only visible file in CloneCD, as well you need a CD-R disc, not a DVD or CD-RW.  I also burnt it at 16X speed which worked fine.  I was unable to use bootcamp on my mac laptop so I downloaded Parallels desktop 4.0, (which is absolutley sick, I highly recomend it) then copied a Windows CD key from the internet, (just google search) and used the key in the Parallels set up to create a Virtual Machine, (which is explained in parallels and super easy) Then when asked, I inserted the disc and Presto!  like I said, best torrent ever!"

,sciatoreitaliano,2010-02-28T15:54Z,"For Linux users:
CloneCD does not exist for Linux, which was a source of frustration for me at first...but a quick google search found the solution.

ccd2iso will do exactly what the name says. And then you can burn it, mount it with ""mount -o loop -t iso9660 file.iso /mnt/iso"", or anything else you can do with an iso.

I sow some websites claming that this tool can be used on macs too with some work."
