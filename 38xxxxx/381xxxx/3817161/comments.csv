This torrent will not be available today (Tue 25th Sep 2007). My PC has a virus and I am spending today disinfecting it.
I hope to get it back up and running as soon as possible."

Apologies to all of you who have been waiting patiently for your Horslips music.
I have now managed to disinfect my PC and this torrent will be available from around 11pm until 6pm each day (my ISP's rules) until there are enough seeders out there.
Hope you enjoy it."
,brown23,2007-09-26T21:58Z,Thanks for hanging in there!! I've been looking for these for awhile now.
,nizzos,2007-10-01T23:24Z,horslips is a rare find you wouldnt happen to have any brett garsed and t.j.helmrich would you?
,patsy79,2007-10-02T19:57Z,any idea why Drive The Cold Winter Away is over 8 gigs? thanks for the download
,brown23,2007-10-04T03:15Z,"I've bben wondering about that 8 gig ""Drive The Cold Winter Away myself. It says it's over 11 hours! That has to be a mistake, right? Maybe that's why this is taking so long to download. No problem though, I'll just delete it if it's a mistake. Thanks for the Horslips!!  "

1) To nizzos - I don't have any brett garsed or t.j.helmrich (I've never heard of them). Hope you can find them elsewhere. Good luck.
2) Re: 'Drive The Cold Winter Away'.
Yep, this is 8Gb. I hadn't noticed that until you guys mentioned it. As this was a) my first attempt to get tapes & LPs on to my PC and b) my first attempt at a torrent, it was a case of trial and error. As the tape for this was so old, I'd filtered it through various applications to try and get the best quality - I wasn't looking at the size of the files. I assume that with all the filtering, it created a much larger file than I thought it would. Considering it's 1 hour of music, it shouldn't be that big.
Do any of you know if I can replace just that bit of the torrent or would I have to do a whole new torrent? The site admin guys must be getting fed up removing all the duff torrents I created before getting one that worked."
,pmb999,2007-10-08T12:27Z,"oh Balls!
I just played 'Drive The Cold Winter Away' start to finish. In Windows Media Player, I'd thought it said it was 59 minutes long. It's not. It's 59 HOURS and 52 minutes long!!
37 minutes of music, 59 hours and 15 minutes of silence!
Once I get the chance, I'll redo 'Drive The Cold Winter Away' and upload it separately.
If you've already got it downloaded, remove everything after 37 minutes and 30 seconds."
,pmb999,2007-10-09T14:03Z,"Note from Author:
If you are downloading this torrent, REMOVE 'Drive The Cold Winter Away' FROM YOUR DOWNLOAD.
For some reason, it came out as 8Gb instead of 85Mb which it should be.
I'll get this uploaded separately.
This should have the benefit of making your download a lot faster.
N.B. PLEASE KEEP SEEDING.
My upload rates are dreadful, so please help to keep Horslips out there."
,Lucifer-Sam,2007-10-13T11:37Z,One one!! pmb999 
,Pkshadow,2008-04-02T20:06Z,"NO NEED TO DOWN LOAD THE 8gig FILE.
If using Azureus under the Horlips Files tab right click the 8gig file and tell it ""not to download"" .
No idea about any other torrent program.

Once you have all the files but that one it will move down and seed. NO NEED TO DOWN LOAD THE 8gig FILE."
,MINITACUM,2008-05-28T12:31Z,"been looking for two of these thanks, anyone got the horslips live album belfast gigs?"
,kiri101,2008-09-20T21:10Z,"if i actually get all this, i will be tempted to find you and hug you."
,arcbar,2009-06-09T06:32Z,pmb999... I fucking love you! I definitely owe you a pint or two for this! :)
,diverdiva,2011-05-01T06:11Z,OMG! pmb99 - I love you!  Lost all my Horslips vinyl in a move to Australia and will be in 7th heaven when this is downloaded.  Thanx
,diverdiva,2011-05-01T06:15Z,PS: did you ever get round to re-uloading Drive the Cold Winter? Can't find a separate listing for it.
