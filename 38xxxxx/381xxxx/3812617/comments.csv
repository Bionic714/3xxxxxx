I will refresh your memory. It has a guy wearing a Zorro mask. That should remind you if you saw it before. At first I thought that he might be trying to add spice to the video. Or else he could be trying to hide his identity or else he was just embarrassed because of his Dinky Dong."
,tre.work,2009-11-12T04:38Z,"All of the above, I believe. Funny how Asian guys are so protective of their identity but the girls have to be fully shown (while they take loads from 25 guys in masks...) It's like the dudes all think there's a chance they'll run for public office or something...She is Korean btw (it's the language she uses anyway) and it's shot I in LA. Nice little town for Korean pooning."

Nonsense. Like the others, it is rubbish and nothing to do with the real screens. "
