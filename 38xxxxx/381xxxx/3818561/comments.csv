ItÂ´s soooo nice that Anal-Ron from ES is giving us this! ;)"
,Panodilo,2007-09-25T17:28Z,"Hi, this is Ron from Eaglesoft. I'm all lubed up and ready to get fucked. Nels is sitting in the corner masterjackin' his shit and Tom Allensworth is pleasuring himself with a lit christmas candle."
,flyboi708,2007-10-03T07:24Z,"wow, this plane is really nice"
,TehNetherlands,2007-11-08T16:49Z,There is a severe bug in this aircraft. The 'rain' textures for all windows appear to be missing.
,TehNetherlands,2007-11-08T17:43Z,"Don't mind my last comment. If you also have problems with 'greyed out' windows after installing the Acceleration expansion, just replace the new rain textures with the old FS 9 rain textures. I dont know about FS9, but in FSX they are located in the main FSX textures folder."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-17T04:39Z,I'd seriously love to see the new Twin Commanche on here.  Anyone know where this baby's at?  Maybe another torrent site?
,Carlos777,2008-02-10T18:21Z,"I install it good but when it comes to open the airplane it opens but after a little while it tells me ""Fatal Error, Windows is restaring FSX"" and i cant play does anyone know what can i do ?? please help me ! i have FSX please somebody tell me how can I fly this airplane !"
,mkeflyer,2008-02-16T17:28Z,The Citation II Expansion pack would be great too if it's out there somewhere. For FS9 and/or FSX.
,plguzman,2008-02-19T05:06Z,Fatal error here. Acceleration installed. You guys with the plane working have acceleration?
,Rudderneck,2008-03-03T13:59Z,I installed and ran this addon without any issues and yes I have installed Acceleration installed.
,Gamepie,2008-03-15T03:03Z,"Won't load, error, crashes the FSX sim, not got acceleration pack either, and I was looking forward to this plane, .........doh!"
,yeoldecaptain,2008-09-08T03:25Z,I am getting the same fatal error.  New install of FSX plus Accelleration.  Hmmm.
,jetplane1123,2009-02-15T17:28Z,"Whenever I try to fly the plane.. either on freeflight or multiplayer, before it loads my FSX gets a fatal error and restarts. It does this all the time. And yes I did re-install it. Anyone know what im doing wrong?"
,krowndeck,2009-03-24T23:18Z,Same fatal error as everyone else. Anyone else feel like uploading it? I was really wanting to fly this...thanks guys.

,cowkiller04,2009-09-19T06:23Z,"Fatal error on FSX for me too.  Did the usual Eaglesoft procedure - reboot computer after installing, load a default equivalent first in 2d cockpit (Lear45), and then switch to this.   "
