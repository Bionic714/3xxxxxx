,knagzhar666,2009-04-16T16:01Z,"Why insult the uploaders? Don't you think they have alot of shit to seed? Don't blaim them, just be happy that it is uploaded and be patient with the seed. Sometimes the seed may suck ass. But it's not the uploaders responsebility to seed it all himself, thats why we share with each other. So blaim those who download and not seed afterwards. People who always complain on the seed is a real pain in the ass."
