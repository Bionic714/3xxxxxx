Something quick I threw together for a trip to South Beach this past June.  It's quick and dirty (and there are some skips in the tracks that I didn't have time to edit out - I did everything for this mix in about 5 hours), but it sounds AMAZING.  Wonderfully uplifting and euphoric, and great to chill to.
