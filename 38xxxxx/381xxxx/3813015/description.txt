This book is known as "the bible" for good reason. For years it was considered the definative book on poker. To date, it still has plenty of value and is a must read for poker players, especially those who wish to take the game seriously.

The game of NL hold em has changed somewhat since this publication. I wouldn't say that the strategy is out of date, but there are books that offer advice that is more conducive to the way the game is played now. That said, reading anything that Doyle Brunson has published is worth your while.
