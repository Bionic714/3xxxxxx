,Churchills Dog,2007-09-19T11:23Z,"Great (albeit short) game. After you're done with the campaign check out the ""arena"" mode which I still play to this day for fun and shooter practice."
,seedbitchimnotgonna,2007-09-19T19:37Z,Nice pick of game dopeman... been wanting this for very long but it was steam protected be4. This copy is able for play without steam?
,liraren_dif,2007-09-19T21:13Z,"Is it just me or does this game have a bug??? 
When you meet with that guy that tells you his envious of you for whats been injected into you (his behind bullet proof glass and its a force feeld just behind you, just a shelf with 2 boxes and canisters in there) nothing happens!! Anybody knows what to do there or is the rip fucked? Even if the rip is fucked creds to you dopeman for all NICE rips...
If anyone can help me...pls do so!

,liraren_dif,2007-09-19T22:09Z,"Fuck...I cant get into the console i press the ~ button but nothing happens...strange...i checked the advanced key settings and the ""activate console"" box was checked and all....any tips? Is the console on any other button?
PEacE"
,420dopeman,2007-09-20T00:47Z,"sorry mate, cant help you with the console key, however, what works to skip that part, if your stuck is this:

To access console press ""~"" or ""`"" (same key has 2 symbols)

then type ""changelevel"" -no quotes

then type this exact thing in

""changelevel SE1_U4Lab03"" -no quotes

this will open the forcefield behind you.

counter-strike finally paid off.

also perfect RiP by Dopeman!!

[V],RadioActiveWeasel,2007-09-20T03:52Z,also i didnt think this game had nudity till there was huge fucking tits all over the screen. that chick so had plastic surgery. 
,Morad,2007-09-20T06:21Z,"Thanx once again, Dope"
,farlight,2007-09-21T11:29Z,"Had the exact same problem, couldn't get the console up! the ""~"" didn't work, don't know why but what you do is go in to whereever you have the game and edit the file autoexec like so:

SinEpisodes\SE1\cfg\autoexec.cfg

Put that on ""0"" save the file start Sin Episode and when the sequence is done exit and change it back to ""1"" and save.

BTW thanks Dopeman, your rips are faking sweet!"
,gordonfreeman797,2007-09-21T12:04Z,"I loved this when it 1st came out...very halflife2-ish. I only got so far in the game, to the point where then 'enemy' is behind the bullet proof screen, & no matter what I tried (available bug-fixes) it wouldn't work. Has this rip got the bug-fixed?
Liraren, would be interested to know if u fixed the problem."
,gtr2,2007-09-21T18:29Z,"got stuck at the bullet-proof glass, I used the method dopeman states above in his comment.

I finished the game. Great game^^"
,gordonfreeman797,2007-09-22T10:56Z,thnx gtr...I'm going in again!
,ayaken,2007-09-22T18:11Z,"thanks dopeman.
keep up the good work and more power."
,gordonfreeman797,2007-09-24T14:16Z,Pleasantly surpirised that I didn't need the bug-fix at all ..everything went smoothly. Great game & great u/l dopeman (thnx).
,seedbitchimnotgonna,2007-09-25T19:44Z,Im stuck with the bug since theres no way for me to get console up(i have a very old keyboard). I was wondering for those not able to get console up cant you upload a save game exactly after the bug occurs then some more people would be able to play through the game. Would be very grateful if anybody did. 
,farlight,2007-09-25T23:07Z,"Do what I wrote, edit the file manually. Find the file ""autoexec.cfg"" and edit the file in notepad change the 1 to a 0 and save."
,SirDEA,2007-09-26T08:15Z,Game to hard! >_< cant get up console... like 10 armored guys vs me with 50hp hurraaayyy!!!!!!!!
,SirDEA,2007-09-26T08:23Z,"Lรถste console problemet.. gรฅ in under cfg lr vad det 
hette รถppna config o skriv om console knappen te valfri knapp... helst en bokstav tror ja ... det ja testade fรถrst funkade inte men sen testade jag med tex P o det funkade"
,gordonfreeman797,2007-09-26T10:17Z,"Finished this yesterday...what a great game!! Loved it! Sadly, looks like there will be no more episodes of this..great shame."
,seedbitchimnotgonna,2007-09-26T14:42Z,farlight it doesnt help against the bug it just disables enemy ai so im like invisible or something i still get stuck between the door and the forcefield.
,farlight,2007-09-29T00:29Z,"Or do what SirDEA said (in swedish) change the mapped key to something else like P, you do that also somewhere I suppose in one of the cfg files

Play normal then ones you're stuck between the armored glass door and the force field (and the AI bug everyone has stopped talking and they just stand there) save the game, exit, changed the 1 to 0, started the game again, load and the dude should walked away and the story continue."
,skeloric,2007-10-03T11:13Z,"This game is hopelessly buggy.
Game freezes at the last part of the lab and ALL recommended fixes seem to fail.
Not worth the download."
,SimultaniousDeaths,2007-10-20T19:37Z,"For me, the BUG didn't appear in this rip for me. Good work dopeman"
,tomaattikasa,2007-10-23T05:27Z,"""Uncensored refers to some  good time nudity you will find only while enjoying this version Sin Episode: Emergence""

Erm... I'd say: Bullshit. Only nudity you are going to get is nude Elexis at the very beginning of the game. The game really offers nothing else. At the end there is 2 second long shot of nude Elexis again, but that's really nothing to write home (or internet) about.

Nice rel though, but buggy. Only way I could get past that lab02 bug mentioned here was typing ""changelevel se1_u4lab03"" at the console. You'll lose your guns, ammo & 100+ health."
,_j0n_,2007-10-24T19:19Z,Great rip. And I have now finished seeding 125% so you should have it by now.
,ProudMan,2007-11-19T15:44Z,"IMPORTANT!!!
If your game freeze in Lab04/big door(betwen 01&02) and won't load,do this:
When you start a game,go to options>display>advanced>hardware DirectX and change it in DirectX9.0.(Default is set to Directx8.0).
Now you can proceed,throught the door."
,ProudMan,2007-11-20T15:54Z,"IMPORTANT-Radek bug!
When you face Radek(drug lord),wait and when he finish talking,press F6(quick save),then ESC,open console(cedilla button),write: ai_norebuldgraph ""0"" and hit submit or enter.Then press F9(quick load) and Radek will go in his submarine.And you can proceed with your game."
,ProudMan,2007-11-20T15:57Z,"IMPORTANT-Radek bug!
EDIT: ai_norebuildgraph ""0""
Tiping mistake in last comment."
,RAMx,2008-03-16T02:49Z,"i meet the problem when i got to the lab. (btw elexis is hot) but i dont seem to get the console display up, (esc and ~). I have tyied to set the game in steam but cant activate the console. Help plz?"
,RareRazz,2008-03-25T01:59Z,"this is the first time i got problems with your games :P

,Psycho420,2010-01-03T20:09Z,"Hey guys I am running Windows 7 64-bit and I have this problem when I try to start the game this System Error sign comes up, it says:

""The program can't start because MSVCP71.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""

So I tried to copy the files from the Vista Users folder to my system32 folder. Then i started the game again and the same sign came up.

So those files doesn't work for Windows 7 users and I have no idea what to do!  Please help me :D"
,exsoldier23,2010-10-12T13:34Z,"first of all, thank you!

secondly, i was shocked when those giant boobs filled the screen! i thought she would have her signature red clothes on...

so, is there a way i can undo the nudity? and put those red clothes back on?"
,war_peanut,2011-03-10T20:26Z,"ATTENTION! - If your running XP and are getting the error message ""Could not find mmsvcp71.dll"" and """"Cant load [your install path] sinepisodes\bin\filesystem_steam.dll"", then here's a possible solution:

1. Go into the folder called ""VISTA_USERS!"" and find the two files inside.

2. Now, take the file named ""MSVCP71.DLL"" (Don't mistake it with ""msvcr71.dll"", which is in lower caps) and paste it into C:\WINDOWS\system

3. Copy the file named ""msvcr71.dll"" and paste it into C:\WINDOWS\system32 

4. Try running the game.

Apparently, the files ""MSVCP71.DLL"" and ""msvcr71.dll"" didn't exist in my System/System32 folders. Once I plugged them back in, the game worked like a charm. 

P.S.: Looks like the last comment here was posted just south of 5 months ago. But if this works for you, help others by posting more info or letting us know that it worked.  "
,guitarjoa,2011-07-01T23:52Z,"Thanks, works like a charm! 
Didn't work at first but after I applied war_peanuts solution no problems. XP"

This game couldn't run pass the acceptable FPS on a notebook PC with DirectX 8 and Duo core 1.8Ghz! Better buy this online STEAM or kick Billidiot Noob Gate$ and his Microsoft-dick Windows dead!"
,JViper91,2011-09-21T13:02Z,"If you're running Windows 7 64bit, put the two .dll files in the Windows\SysWOW64 folder instead of the Windows\System32 one, that worked for me."
