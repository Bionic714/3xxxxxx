,rossirep,2007-09-20T12:12Z,"OH JUST TO LET YOU ALL KNOW - the drives for the nvma F20 will NOT work in vista 64 bit, and as far as i know Navman dont give shit, Not once have they got back to me to tell me of nay issues or updates. Works well in XP though. (thank god i have 2 Pc's )"
,Giam777,2007-09-30T21:48Z,"Thanks!
Do you have maps of central-Europe? Please!"
,merikiito,2007-10-02T14:08Z,How do you put the speed camera database onto the F20 Navman?
,rossirep,2007-10-03T22:16Z,"to install the new data:

first open the software, 

create a new csv file, and call it say ""mobile cams"" etc...

copy and paste the locations from the speedcam file or what ever its called. 

then save it,  and copy to device.  

You have to assign an Icon to the new POI file,  but do a google search for full instructions, i cant be arsed to type anymore."

,syncro16,2007-10-31T12:41Z,"Couldn't download.
I'm new at this - does your PC have to be up and running (suppose so) to be able to download?
Should I leave my uTorrent on, and let it wait for the PC at the other end to come online?
Bear with me - beginner."
,rossirep,2007-12-10T13:04Z,"@ Syncro,  Start your torrent client,and leave the pc on untill it downloads. 

I actuall got threatened with legal actionregarding this torrent, POCKET GPS WORLD can suck my stump. THEY SHOULD GIVE THIS INFORMATION OUT FOR FREE!!! SO POCKET GPS WORLD, how can you copyright GPS co-ordintes? I DONT THINK YOU CAN, a series of numbers, and commas...  go fuck yourselves! "
,mrvorn,2008-01-01T01:00Z,"Had a bit of trouble with the image file tried everything I could think of including using virtual drive manager and magic iso ,( amongst others ), maybe it s me but I cannot get the disk image working."
,catswingsteve,2008-02-04T21:36Z,"Does anyone know if this will work with an F10
I dont want to pay out ÂŁ15 for a usb cable and dvd if this is the same program
