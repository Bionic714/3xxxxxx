,death734,2007-09-21T18:14Z,i was just browsing through the latest tv torrents and noticed this. just wanted to say its a good idea to include the season and ep numbers when you put them all in 1 folder or season folders so that way people actually know which episode each is and actually watch it in order not be on season 1 in one episode then all of a sudden be in season 4 or whatever by viewing in alphabetical order
,Dan6971,2007-09-21T21:13Z,"(You're Welcome)

When you drag and drop these files into iTunes, all of the Seasons should be shown and the episodes should list in order."
,Dan6971,2007-09-27T04:38Z,To all of you that have completed downloading this compilation - please seed...
,adventurejunky,2007-10-20T01:25Z,"I started watching these season when I was 11.
I never comleted the series and saw how they ended up,im 26 today. 
Im with death734 complete seasons are the best torrents.
Good job Dan6971"
,Dan6971,2007-10-24T05:10Z,"Thanks man.

I hope you enjoy them all.

I won't tell you how it turns out, but it's memorable.

Notice the irony of the last episode and how it intertwines with the first episode, with Kevin & Winnie...

Go back and watch them again.

I also have every ""Seinfeld"" & ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" if interested..."

,slcuper,2008-07-23T19:12Z,"These episodes are definitely watchable on IPOD, but not recommended for rendering to DVD...just a heads up before you spend a week downloading this.  "
,cali808,2008-09-10T02:13Z,"Thanks a lot for all 115 of these. I wish they were numbered though, I don't use iTunes/iPod. Does anyone know how to access the hidden meta-data in these to name the titles proper?"
,notcoolenough,2008-10-11T01:07Z,I am glad i found this. I agree that they should be named according to the season and episode though.
,usmcjgill,2009-05-30T02:24Z,"appreciate the download, thanks for the effort, however...
yeah the quality sucks and the episodes are missing the best damn part: THE INTRO SONG!!! Everyone whpo dowloaded this or wanted to was looking forward to the childhood feeling they were gonna get when they heard/saw the intro..."

,steveaust,2012-04-02T14:58Z,"Thanks Uploader. great show.
but
- Video quality is like an old VHS tape! with a bad antenna
- Episodes are not organised at all ... I guess I could use wiki to work out what order to watch them in ...
There are DVD sets out there, I might wait till someone does a DVD rip ..."
