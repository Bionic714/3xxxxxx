plzzzz answerr mr Imc-arlovv plzzzzzzz"
,faithie270,2008-09-29T18:03Z,"There are different types of phones like Samsung or Sony Ericcson. So everything is different, but I suggest you try the following to get the games into your phone:

1. Open your phone manager in the computer, and send it there. (Samsung - I know you have to get the JAD and JAR files from JADMAKER.exe and then send it to your other files section. Then open the JAD file to install.)

2. If you have a memory card, and your computer has a memory card adaptor slot, insert your memory card into the computer and transfer the games. No need for JAD files. (Samsung - this doesn't work, all it says would be ""unsupported format"". If you use the first method however, it fully supports the format.)

3. USB cable your phone to the comp. See #1.

Hope this helps.."
