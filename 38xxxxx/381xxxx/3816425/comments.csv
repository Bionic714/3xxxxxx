,z0diac,2007-09-23T15:16Z,why is the file always split into 2 different .avi's with audio differences so they can't be merged??

,beatnick,2007-09-23T17:10Z,Thx! I have some hopes that shogun will hurt Griffin badly and also like to see Sanchez get his ass handed to him. Will watch it later this sunday evening.
,gratefulvay,2007-09-23T17:41Z,Thx sooooo much man!!!
,Ryhelios,2007-09-23T18:30Z,THANKS GUY! WILL SEED FOR A WEEK OR SO!!
,MrPiratetoU,2007-09-23T19:42Z,Ok.. Chuck Will win by knockout in first round. Shogun by knockout in second and Fitch will punish little gay boy Sanchez bad! These are just my predictions. No spoilers! Thx uploader!
,z0diac,2007-09-23T19:52Z,"@Tom78,

what the fuck are you talking about?? i never said shit about not being thankful.. just asked a simple question.. are you too stupid to answer it without flaming for no reason? homo."
,D[E]A,2007-09-23T19:52Z,"Tnx alot hossahot

cheers DEA"
,Just_Another_Peer,2007-09-23T20:52Z,"Come on people, SEED,SEED,SEED"
,Ryhelios,2007-09-23T21:01Z,PIRATE YOU ARE A DOUCHE
,h4ns0l0,2007-09-23T21:01Z,"eintti: um yeah ya see ""downloaded"" means the .torrent file not the payload, it takes time to build a good swarm. I've got 8 100% peers currently so this one is going plenty good, of course I will seed 300% once complete just like everyone who is honorable will do as well."
,Ryhelios,2007-09-23T21:03Z,"WELL I HAD TO READ THE WHOLE THING... SORRY ABOUT THE DOUCHE COMMENT,  I DONT KNOW.  SANCHEZ KNOCKED KARO PARYSIAN TEETH OUT.  AND I READ THAT FORREST... WELL... I DONT WANT TO BE A DOUCHE.  "
,Ryhelios,2007-09-23T21:10Z,"Chang there is 106 seeders as of 2:06pm,  thats not bad considering I started leaching a few hours ago, and there was like 60 or so.  be patient, the ratio of  leechers to seeders is over 10:1. but as with all of these fights there will be more seeders than leechers by the end of the week.  Bottom line, maybe you should have paid for the fight last night! Stop taking TPB for granted!!"
,LSKytte,2007-09-23T21:15Z,Is the aAF version better than the OMiCRON version ?
,cguentzel,2007-09-23T21:18Z,Thanks so much...I can't wait to see it...I love the UFC...oh Sanchez i use to like him but his ego made it where i want him to get his butt beat..come on koschek beat him already and he was lucky when he knocked out karo parysian...i believe its going to b a good fight between jardin and liddel...continue seeding and i will continue seeding as soon as i am done...again thanks man
,beatnick,2007-09-23T22:55Z,"There was a time when l hated Sanchez so much that l would fight him for no money, just to crack jesus out of his mind. Now l feel only pity seeing him facing the bold truth...You are lonely kiddo. Do your thing and leave the religious stuff in the church."
,Ryhelios,2007-09-23T23:55Z,"you say it was luck?  did you even watch the fight? the guy knocked his teeth out!  afterward he GnP'd his ass!! Karo ran out of gas!! then it went to the cards!!  that was a test of strength and endurance!!  anything can happen in this sport!  luck was when Rampage beat the Iceman!  Lucky shot! Chuck did get careless, though. Luck was Garbanzo (or whatever) and Cro Cop.  Anyone is beatable, but the Parysian vs. Sanchez fight was no luck my friend!!"

THANK YOU FOR THIS ELITE UPLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,underh20,2007-09-24T06:22Z,"Keith Jardine has a ugly technique, no finesse and style, (HE FIGHTS LIKE A CRAB) however he did out score and out heart The Iceman.

I think chuck was just scared of him!!!

FORREST GRIFFIN IS THE SHIT!!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!

DIEGO DIRTY SANCHEZ SUCKS, GET THE FUCK OUT OF SAN DIEGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,juudu,2007-09-24T15:22Z,What is this??
,Ryhelios,2007-09-29T06:16Z,"listen here joneson you faggot Aussie!  The reason you dont like people who know some shit is because you are fuckin retarded!  I happen to get over thirty  seeders on a regular basis.  Second of all, you have nothing credible to say about MMA or torrents for that matter, so don't post a flaming comment.  Just keep running your mouth behind your computer, because I would bet 6 months pay that I would fuck your ""wanker"" ass up.  FUCKIN PUFF."
