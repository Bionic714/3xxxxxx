David Icke:I am me_I am free


from the book

...So who the hell are you, then? What lies behind those eyes? When you
look in the mirror, what do you see? Do you see the real you, or what
you have been conditioned to believe is you? The two are so, so,
different. One is an infinite consciousness capable of being and creating
whatever it chooses, the other is an illusion imprisoned by its own
perceived and programmed limitations.
Which of these ???yous??? is controlling your life? Infinity or limitation?
Self love or self disdain? Freedom of thought or a prison of the mind?...

The Global Dictatorship
Control of the world over a very long period has been achieved by the
means I have already outlined: mind manipulation, manufactured
division, and most important of all, fear. This is the emotion that has
handed control of our lives to the manipulating clique which I call the
Global Elite.
Once you can make people fearful they will look to someone to
protect them from whatever they have been conditioned to fear. This is
why history, and the world today, is full of hyped up ???monsters??? and
???dangerous people??? - a focus of fear from which we must look to our
???leaders??? to save us.


I highlight hundreds of people, events and organisations,
who in the public arena appear to be in opposition, but in truth are
connected to the same Global Elite. Among these connections, for
example, are those between George Bush and Saddam Hussein, the
???opponents??? in the Gulf War of 1991. The manufactured Cold War
between the West and the Soviet Union was another classic of this kind...
