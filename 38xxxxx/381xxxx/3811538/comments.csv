The torrent NEEDS seeds. The torrent NEEDS seeds. The torrent NEEDS seeds.  

Currrently there is only one seed, and that seed is not connectable,; everyone has been stuck at 93.7% for days.  

Please, if you are the seeder, open your BT port so people can connect to you and then you will not be seeding for nothing."
