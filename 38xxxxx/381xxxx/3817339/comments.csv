,Pirate-Bean,2008-02-12T10:42Z,"To those having problems with no voices at lessons or during flight:
Make sure your default sounddevice for playing and recording is set to your soundcard where you have plugged your loudspeakers to.
Allso make sure (the importen one) the voicedevices are listed to the soundcard with your loudspeakers plugged into it. 
If you dont have it enabled to the soundcard you use, you wont hear anything.

To see where your sound is played go to Controll pannel, open 'Sound and Sounddevices' and go to the different taps and check it.

This worked for me. If it doesn't work for you, simply reinstall the game, or pick another soundcard (in case you picked wrong first time)"

,zealousrage,2008-05-23T02:45Z,"======HOW TO INSTALL======
First off to all the torrent uploaders out there; if the torrent doesn't come with detailed installation instructions, its your responsibility to include them in the comment section.
1. Mount the DVD 1 file with PowerISO
2. When the install screen comes up and it says options on the bottom click this and uncheck ""Launch game after installation has completed""
3. Click install and let it do its thing
4. When disc 1 finishes installing and the installer says to insert disc 2, you must first UNMOUNT DISC 1, then MOUNT DISC 2 in the same drive. This is very important because otherwise the installer still thinks that disc one is in the drive, and disc two is not even if both are mounted.
5. Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close
6. Next run the application called ""fsx_sp1_ENU"" this basically an update for flight simulator (note that despite the name service pack 1, this is a service pack for the game not windows it self).
6. unrar the file named ""FsimX_serviceP1_Fixed_Working"", open the unrared file and copy the cracked .dll files into the microsoft flight simulator folder.
7. After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.
-I figured this out using a vista computer so things could differ depending on your operating system, graphics card, etc."

_____________________
** FIX **

I use Windows Vista 32-bit.
1) Take PowerISO and Extract DVD1 into a folder. (I used a desktop folder for mine)
2) Open DVD2 in PowerISO and Extract all those files into the same folder you extracted DVD1 into.

When it asks if you want to overwrite the files - click YES.

Do not use the Folder titled ""Crack"" Open up the SP1 folder, run the .exe and open your FSX Folder and copy the 3 .dll's and place them into that folder. 

It should work!

,bigbirdt14,2008-07-13T00:04Z,"Basics for torrents(Learned the hard, n00bi5h way)

1. Why was TPB down for a few hours recently? they now have SSL encryption, so use it!! (https://thepiratebay.com instead of http:// etc
2. Get Alcohol 120%, idc how. You see all the guys below me who say DISC 2 WONT WORK ZOMGZ!!1, thats because dameontools and many other freeware utilities cant use it
3. I use utorrent, its teh simplest. I like it because right after you install it, it gives you the option to encrypt your downloads, which will eliminate ISP throttling. So do itt
4.Get a good router that supports PORT FORWARDING. some of you are liek, teh fukc is that? well go to portforward.com to find out! My speed, up and down, doubled. Sounds like a pretty fucking sweet deal, and about 70% of routers support it. If a cuntry bumpkin lik me can do it u can too.
5. Last, but most importantly, seed. What is seeding, you may ask? its giving back to the community you get from. WITHOUT SEEDERS, YOU AND I COULDN'T DOWNLOAD.TAHT !S TEH SUX0R. I continuously seed all of my torrents at a bare minimum of 35 kb/ps, which is almost no hit to my speed. I've seeded at 100 While playing Halo 2 and had a ping of 93 on a server in france. Im in texas. SEEDING WILL NOT HURT. Pretty soon when i upgrade to 5Mb/s and 2Mb/s I will seed at 670. It wont be a hit at all either. The general rule is 1/3 speed.
6. If something seems confusing, try to figure it out anyway. A certain game i downloaded 5 times till i figured out how to install it. I love that game dearly.

Lastly, thank the good guys over in sweden who make this possible, they truly have balls of steel for telling everyone to go have anal intercourse with an inflatable ballon, and poking fun at Teh Inturwebz Sherrif. He sucks
Sincerely, bigbirdt14

Please seed for a few days and help some friends out.

I am going at 0.9kb/s 
At this rate it would take me nearly 19weeks.

All I need is a few days of good seeders.
I promise I will seed this game to 600% when I have it fully DL'd
Thanks."
,RonFTL,2008-07-15T10:47Z,"Ok, I set up Port Forwarding on my router like bigbirdt14 said to. 
and my DL rate jumped from 0.9kb/s to 130kb/s
I should be done in 20hours instead of 20 weeks lol.

This is great. Thanks for all the seeding guys.

I set up all my most used applications/games to be port fowarded."

*****""Error 1311. Source file not found: C:\Program\Flightsim X\D2Feat~1.cab. Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.""
I get this when installing the game, DVD 1.

How do I get passed this problem?
Hope tt get a response! Thanks!****** 

BUt i followed these instructions:

*****======HOW TO INSTALL======
First off to all the torrent uploaders out there; if the torrent doesn't come with detailed installation instructions, its your responsibility to include them in the comment section.
1. Mount the DVD 1 file with PowerISO
2. When the install screen comes up and it says options on the bottom click this and uncheck ""Launch game after installation has completed""
3. Click install and let it do its thing
4. When disc 1 finishes installing and the installer says to insert disc 2, you must first UNMOUNT DISC 1, then MOUNT DISC 2 in the same drive. This is very important because otherwise the installer still thinks that disc one is in the drive, and disc two is not even if both are mounted.
5. Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close
6. Next run the application called ""fsx_sp1_ENU"" this basically an update for flight simulator (note that despite the name service pack 1, this is a service pack for the game not windows it self).
6. unrar the file named ""FsimX_serviceP1_Fixed_Working"", open the unrared file and copy the cracked .dll files into the microsoft flight simulator folder.
7. After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.
-I figured this out using a vista computer so things could differ depending on your operating system, graphics card, etc. ********

I did it on an XP system, and it worked for me. Installed fine on the first try after many failed attempts installing from a burnt DVD. Now on to having fun."
,postram,2008-07-23T16:37Z,"I HAVE TRYED FOR 3 WEEKS TO GET THIS TO WORK,LOAD DVD 1 OK DVD 2 WILL NOT LOAD ACTS LIKE ITS NOT THERE ??????? WHAT IAM I DOING ??? WRONG 
HELP   HELP   HELP"
,midsman38,2008-07-26T05:15Z,"OK, some (OK, the important bits :-) ) of the below were blatantly copied from Crunk007 for which I give him credit and thanks. Only difference was he copied the files to a virtual drive whilst I burned them to DVD. I have tried to explain the process to a noob so apologies if I am teaching you more experienced guys and girls to suck eggs.

1.	Burn both disks (DVD1 and DVD2) to DVD's using PowerISO. This is as easy as downloading PowerISO from here, putting a blank DVD into your writer, selecting ""open"" on Power ISO, then finding the .daa file from the folder ""Disk 1"" and pressing ""Burn"". Repeat for Disk 2. You will now have 2 DVD's, disk 1 & 2. This will take around 2 hours.

2.	Put your newly burned Disk 1 into your DVD drive, explore it and select ""Install.exe"" (it may autorun, depends on how your PC is set up)

3.	Open a case of Stella Artois. The install takes ages and Stella makes it more blurred and interesting. If you are American, open a case of ""Bud Light"" but try to drink 5 times more due to the weakly nature of such recycled water that resemble rat piss :-)

4.	If you are American and at this point start thinking of ways to be nasty to me, chill out and sink more beer. I am very pro colonial but very anti your Beer :) Although being an ex squaddie, I am very pro the Busch family (if you have ever served in the Yank or Brit military, you'll know why). Take note, that's ""Busch"" with a ""C"", not the other soundalike.

5.	Follow all the instructions that come up. When the install screen comes up and it says options on the bottom click this and uncheck ""Launch game after installation has completed"". This program is huge, it will take a couple of hours to install (depending on your PC). Insert Disk 2 into your CD/DVD drive when prompted. 

6.	
Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close. For some reason on the 2nd PC I installed it on it ran anyway even though I had unchecked ""Launch game after installation has completed"". DO NOT stop the program if it starts to run, this is no drama, just let it do its thing and then exit the programme before you physically type in any registration details that it asks you for. 

7.	Next run the application called ""fsx_sp1_ENU"" (in the original folder that you downloaded via the Torrent), this is basically an update for flight simulator (note that despite the name service pack 1, this is a service pack for the game not windows it self). This will extract into one of your drives. For some reason on my PC it extracted to Virtual drive ""E"", but on another PC it extracted to ""C"". It doesn't matter where it extracts to as long as you can find it. It will autorun on completion of extraction. If it doesn't and  you can't find it then click ""Start"", ""Search"" and search for ""fsx_dlx_enu_sp1.msp"". Once you find the folder that this is in, click ""setup.exe"" in that folder. A box will come up telling you the progress of the update. Let it run it's course, this may take a while (up to 90 minutes), have patience

8.	Once this is done, go back to your original Torrent download and unrar the file named ""FsimX_serviceP1_Fixed_Working"", (this is ""unrar'd"" by using ""Winrar"", again search for it on here if you don't already have it). Open the unrar'd file and copy the cracked .dll files into the microsoft flight simulator folder. On my PC the folder was ?C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X?

9.	After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.

10.	Go to bed feeling guilty that you have deprived Billy Gates of a few quid that has obviously severely affected his 22 billion dollar personal fortune. You may have also caused Microsoft to have 1 less piece of diamond encrusted toilet paper.

11.	Wake up realising that if they didn't charge so damn much for the stuff in the first place (22 BILLION PERSONAL fortune, remember?), then maybe we wouldn't download Pir"
,midsman38,2008-07-26T05:28Z,"PS, forgot to add that I tried this on a third PC and got the errors mentioned a few posts ago.

Turned out that this was a memory and hardware issue, NOT a problem with the Torrent.

If you have problems running the program after following the instructions I would start looking at your PC as opposed to the file. Look up the original program (from Microsoft) and check system requirements, that's how I found the issue on PC number 3. 

I now have this program running on 3 PC's so I would definitley say that any issues are down to the machine that it is installed on, not down to the excellent file that Stephanie_mm8 has provided.

Thanks Steph"

,wilson1375,2008-08-13T23:33Z,"@Tenshi
I'd have to disagree. Blocking 67% of the internet has got to do SOMETHING.  I've been on torrents that people were missing several gigs due to hash fails, and I had maybe 2megs in hash fails.  A college study has shown that blocking just one specific ip range decreased anti-p2p activity by 50% or so.  It is by no means perfect, but should be standard to all pirates nonetheless.  And people, stop using bullshit bt clients that don't support encryption. Stick with uTorrent or Azureus (again, I know encryption isn't a problem solver, but it helps)

,GKraften,2009-01-07T00:34Z,"@dvldog74: While I may not agree with the somewhat barbed delivery, I have to second Oneill5491's and xiIix's message... At least, I can't personally see a reason for using ""non-standard"" formats on TPB, it just adds to the general confusion, not to mention the resulting oh-so-annoying waiting to DL some obscure app before that other three-week DL can finally work (at least for those of us stupid (and/or lazy) enough not to check the formats beforehand).

That being said; thanks for the upload... I've been waiting to DL this until I got my broken joystick/throttle replaced, and I just got my filthy hands on a Saitek X52 :D

tl;dr"

And no, this is not the perfect torrent as to DL speed vs. seeders (if such a concept even existed), but at least the contents work without fault (which is not as common as you'd like to think).

So if you have a problem with the number of seeders, GO AHEAD AND SEED YOURSELF! Do you honestly believe that even a single person will react to your incessant flood-posting by thinking ""Gee, those guys really want this (as opposed to all the other torrents on TPB that nobody wants)... I better DL and seed it for them if I want any chance to get into heaven when I die. Jesus would want me to seed.""?

I have some questions:

I DL this and installed it according to the instructions. I also DL the Acceleration pack and installed it properly. But I can´t get the multiplayer session to work...
It just disconnects me from Gamespy all the time.
I also get an errror when accesing the game for the first time:
""scenery.cfg error..."" and not just one, perhaps 30 different errors of that type.
The game works great not concidering this...
I´ve heard that Acceleration don´t work together with SP1 while in multiplayer, so I´ve also tried not to install SP1 and just FSX+Acceleration, but that doesn´t work either! :S

I shall add that i´m not a n00b at this, ´cause I´ve DL many games and got it to work with cracks.

PLZ, can anyone tell me what I´ve done wrong or how to do it properly?? :D"

,kespa25,2009-04-19T00:05Z,"======HOW TO INSTALL======
First off to all the torrent uploaders out there; if the torrent doesn't come with detailed installation instructions, its your responsibility to include them in the comment section.
1. Mount the DVD 1 file with PowerISO
2. When the install screen comes up and it says options on the bottom click this and uncheck ""Launch game after installation has completed""
3. Click install and let it do its thing
4. When disc 1 finishes installing and the installer says to insert disc 2, you must first UNMOUNT DISC 1, then MOUNT DISC 2 in the same drive. This is very important because otherwise the installer still thinks that disc one is in the drive, and disc two is not even if both are mounted.
5. Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close
6. Next run the application called ""fsx_sp1_ENU"" this basically an update for flight simulator (note that despite the name service pack 1, this is a service pack for the game not windows it self).
6. unrar the file named ""FsimX_serviceP1_Fixed_Working"", open the unrared file and copy the cracked .dll files into the microsoft flight simulator folder.
7. After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.
-I figured this out using a vista computer so things could differ depending on your operating system, graphics card, etc. "

First off to all the torrent uploaders out there; if the torrent doesn't come with detailed installation instructions, its your responsibility to include them in the comment section.
1. Mount the DVD 1 file with PowerISO
2. When the install screen comes up and it says options on the bottom click this and uncheck ""Launch game after installation has completed""
3. Click install and let it do its thing
4. When disc 1 finishes installing and the installer says to insert disc 2, you must first UNMOUNT DISC 1, then MOUNT DISC 2 in the same drive. This is very important because otherwise the installer still thinks that disc one is in the drive, and disc two is not even if both are mounted.
5. Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close
6. Next run the application called ""fsx_sp1_ENU"" this basically an update for flight simulator (note that despite the name service pack 1, this is a service pack for the game not windows it self).
6. unrar the file named ""FsimX_serviceP1_Fixed_Working"", open the unrared file and copy the cracked .dll files into the microsoft flight simulator folder.
7. After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.

right so you have installed fsx when you go to the floder it should have a fold called crack. in there will be three item's, api.dll, fsui.dll, main.dll. these have to go in to the right folder.

I.E

my computer, local disk (C), programs files, microsoft games, microsoft flight simulator x.

that is the pathe you need to put the three items in there and it will ask you if you want to  overwirte the items alredy in there just click yes to all and there you go you have the full game its the same as the expantion pack to.

For those who keep asking for the key, if your game is prompting you for that, that means you either didnt copy and paste the new cracks into the old , or you didnt paste it into the original download folder which most likely resides in your program files. If you do that properly, it will begin loading the terrainsettings, etc instead of asking for serial.

,Th3_Raging_Bull,2009-12-29T09:04Z,"======HOW TO INSTALL======
First off to all the torrent uploaders out there; if the torrent doesn't come with detailed installation instructions, its your responsibility to include them in the comment section.
1. Mount the DVD 1 file with PowerISO
2. When the install screen comes up and it says options on the bottom click this and uncheck ""Launch game after installation has completed""
3. Click install and let it do its thing
4. When disc 1 finishes installing and the installer says to insert disc 2, you must first UNMOUNT DISC 1, then MOUNT DISC 2 in the same drive. This is very important because otherwise the installer still thinks that disc one is in the drive, and disc two is not even if both are mounted.
5. Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close
6. Next run the application called ""fsx_sp1_ENU"" this basically an update for flight simulator (note that despite the name service pack 1, this is a service pack for the game not windows it self).
6. unrar the file named ""FsimX_serviceP1_Fixed_Working"", open the unrared file and copy the cracked .dll files into the microsoft flight simulator folder.
7. After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.
-I figured this out using a vista computer so things could differ depending on your operating system, graphics card, etc.

Thanks KDGRI"
,yzfpilot85,2010-01-01T04:10Z,"To Th3_Raging_Bull: Thanks for the trick with power iso... didn't know I had to unmount the first disc and then mount the second, huge help. 

To Stephanie_mm8: Nice rip! Next time could we have it in standard .ISO like most anything else on here. I have been doing this for a long time and never have had to use power ISO. Please and thanks... but really, good job."
,CNSZU,2010-01-01T14:37Z,"I'm having the same problem as some other people here. After downloading, in rzr-fsxf.daa there is a corrupt file named D1Feat~1.cab, and in rzr-fsxb.daa there is another corrupt file named D2Feat~1.cab, which means installing this game is impossible. 

I suggest you guys download other FSX torrents in addition to this one, just to make sure."

sounds like ya not cracking it mate if its asking for activation. after install, go to ya main fsx folder, drive C, program files, microsoft games, microsoft flight simulator X, open that file and scroll down past all the folders and you'll see the api.dll, main.dll, fsui.dll amongst a list of others, delete those 3 or create a new folder on ya desktop and drag them into it then drag the 3 .dll files with the same name in ya crack folder into the fsx folder, basically remove the original .dll's and replace with the crack ones. start the sim and your activated. make sure u remove the original .dll's tho, dont just copy and keep both files. i didnt actually use this crack, i installed the sp1 then dl'd fsx acceleration and used the crack from that. also if it still dont work make sure ya using the crack for sp1 if u installed sp1, if you didnt install sp1 then use a crack just for fsx. id dl the acceleration tho if i was you, it gives a load more missions and muliplayer. good luck."

4. When disc 1 finishes installing and the installer says to insert disc 2, you must first UNMOUNT DISC 1, then MOUNT DISC 2 in the same drive. This is very important because otherwise the installer still thinks that disc one is in the drive, and disc two is not even if both are mounted.
5. Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close

7. After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.

install sp1. now when u try to run the program it shows the msxml4 sp2 error

2) copy the msxml4.manifest file from the dvd to the install directory. now if you run it shows the scenery.cfg file missing error.

3)copy scenery.cfg from dvd to install directory(btw u need to explore the dvd image file using poweriso, even magiciso works for this purpose).
now it shows some area 115 error.

4)go to install directory create a folder addon scenery. the in addon scenery create two more folders scenery and texture)
the area 115 prob should be solved but the game terminates in 30 mins.

,rudedog9d,2010-12-19T04:58Z,"To those of you asking people to seed, If they already downloaded and are not seeding, They most likely are NOT gonna see your comment.

Now, to try and answer some questions..

To CD Key people, a crack makes it so you don't need one. 
1) Hit register later, Click finish (If the game opens, it will be the trial version, just close it)
2) Then Copy the files from the crack folder to your game directory (Computer, C, Program Files, Game)
3) you will need to copy over files that are there, So you may want to make a copy of the originals (You can just rename them, such as ""File1"" to ""File1 Original""
4) Play Game!

For those with Issues mounting, You need Power ISO, no other mounting Programs. I don't Necessarily like this, but it isn't hat bad. If you cant figure out how, you better be 8..No, wait, 6. Otherwise go find a creative way to kill yourself and see if it works. The world will better without you.  Below is a link on TPB for a full version, The trial wont work.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5510720/POWER_ISO_4.7

To those with a second CD Issue, The second CD needs to be in the same drive (Or mounted on the same drive, I did same thing)

Also, I know these people wont see this, but I want to make a piont. 
@Exodiaj and bamjuice It worked for all these other people, Did it ever occur to you something on your end F***ed up?"

,diogoloreti,2011-02-07T01:38Z,"======HOW TO INSTALL======
First off to all the torrent uploaders out there; if the torrent doesn't come with detailed installation instructions, its your responsibility to include them in the comment section.
1. Mount the DVD 1 file with PowerISO
2. When the install screen comes up and it says options on the bottom click this and uncheck ""Launch game after installation has completed""
3. Click install and let it do its thing
4. When disc 1 finishes installing and the installer says to insert disc 2, you must first UNMOUNT DISC 1, then MOUNT DISC 2 in the same drive. This is very important because otherwise the installer still thinks that disc one is in the drive, and disc two is not even if both are mounted.
5. Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close
6. Next run the application called ""fsx_sp1_ENU"" this basically an update for flight simulator (note that despite the name service pack 1, this is a service pack for the game not windows it self).
6. unrar the file named ""FsimX_serviceP1_Fixed_Working"", open the unrared file and copy the cracked .dll files into the microsoft flight simulator folder.
7. After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.
-I figured this out using a vista computer so things could differ depending on your operating system, graphics card, etc.


I DID THAT YESTAERDAY AND IT WORKS PERFECT. i use windows 7 64-bit

Reinstall it again. Once disc 2 is almost done installing it will ask Register Now  - Register Later. 

You MUST select Register Later. Then do the rest (copy the .dll files into program files and so on) and it will not ask for a registration key

,Wyvern41,2011-04-30T13:33Z,"Currently downloading at between 1 and 1.5 Mb/s, so no complaints there. 

The comments have provided interesting reading in that I see nothing uncommon about the install ... very typical for a cracked program, but I'm anxious to try it.

Also, even though I have PowerISO, I rarely use it. Most often I open ISO downloads and extract them with WinRar. This one, however, may be too large to extract, then fit onto a type-5 DVD, but ... we'll see.

Thanks, Stephanie ... however it turns out, I appreciate your upload."
,Wyvern41,2011-04-30T14:51Z,"OK ... learned something new here.

The DL completed just fine, but WinRar does NOT open daa files which were invented by and are proprietary to PowerISO. A quick search, however, turned up a small freeware program (daa2iso.exe) that converts a daa file (or set of files) to an iso file quickly and easily. 

Thanks to all for your comments ... very helpful."

====HOW TO INSTALL===

OK, some (OK, the important bits :-) ) of the below were blatantly copied from Crunk007 for which I give him credit and thanks. Only difference was he copied the files to a virtual drive whilst I burned them to DVD. I have tried to explain the process to a noob so apologies if I am teaching you more experienced guys and girls to suck eggs.

1.	Burn both disks (DVD1 and DVD2) to DVD's using PowerISO. This is as easy as downloading PowerISO from here, putting a blank DVD into your writer, selecting ""open"" on Power ISO, then finding the .daa file from the folder ""Disk 1"" and pressing ""Burn"". Repeat for Disk 2. You will now have 2 DVD's, disk 1 & 2. This will take around 2 hours.

2.	Put your newly burned Disk 1 into your DVD drive, explore it and select ""Install.exe"" (it may autorun, depends on how your PC is set up)

3.	Open a case of Stella Artois. The install takes ages and Stella makes it more blurred and interesting. If you are American, open a case of ""Bud Light"" but try to drink 5 times more due to the weakly nature of such recycled water that resemble rat piss :-)

4.	If you are American and at this point start thinking of ways to be nasty to me, chill out and sink more beer. I am very pro colonial but very anti your Beer :) Although being an ex squaddie, I am very pro the Busch family (if you have ever served in the Yank or Brit military, you'll know why). Take note, that's ""Busch"" with a ""C"", not the other soundalike.

5.	Follow all the instructions that come up. When the install screen comes up and it says options on the bottom click this and uncheck ""Launch game after installation has completed"". This program is huge, it will take a couple of hours to install (depending on your PC). Insert Disk 2 into your CD/DVD drive when prompted. 

6.	
Let disc 2 install, upon completion click finish and the installer should close. For some reason on the 2nd PC I installed it on it ran anyway even though I had unchecked ""Launch game after installation has completed"". DO NOT stop the program if it starts to run, this is no drama, just let it do its thing and then exit the programme before you physically type in any registration details that it asks you for. 

7.	Next run the application called ""fsx_sp1_ENU"" (in the original folder that you downloaded via the Torrent), this is basically an update for flight simulator (note that despite the name service pack 1, this is a service pack for the game not windows it self). This will extract into one of your drives. For some reason on my PC it extracted to Virtual drive ""E"", but on another PC it extracted to ""C"". It doesn't matter where it extracts to as long as you can find it. It will autorun on completion of extraction. If it doesn't and you can't find it then click ""Start"", ""Search"" and search for ""fsx_dlx_enu_sp1.msp"". Once you find the folder that this is in, click ""setup.exe"" in that folder. A box will come up telling you the progress of the update. Let it run it's course, this may take a while (up to 90 minutes), have patience

8.	Once this is done, go back to your original Torrent download and unrar the file named ""FsimX_serviceP1_Fixed_Working"", (this is ""unrar'd"" by using ""Winrar"", again search for it on here if you don't already have it). Open the unrar'd file and copy the cracked .dll files into the microsoft flight simulator folder. On my PC the folder was ?C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X?

9.	After this run the game and don't be surprised if the program takes a long time to load textures and such, this is normal and eventually the game should start.

10.	Go to bed feeling guilty that you have deprived Billy Gates of a few quid that has obviously severely affected his 22 billion dollar personal fortune. You may have also caused Microsoft to have 1 less piece of diamond encrusted toilet paper.

11.	Wake up realising that if they didn't charge so damn much for the stuff in the first place (22 BILLION PERSONAL fortune, reme"

1. Mount DVD 1 and install

3. Place files from crack folder into installation directory.
4. If you want, extract Service Pack 1 and install.
5. Patch that with the crack files from the service pack folder.
6. Enjoy
BUT BE CAREFUL. I don't understand why I got hit on this torrent (Game came out in 2006 and there's only a few hundred peers), but I did. First time ever out of a lot of downloads. It may be worth it to just buy the game for about $10. Anyway, have fun."

,tpbNate,2011-10-28T07:50Z,"This is my first time commenting. First Id like to say thank you very much for the torrent. I'm also new to installing torrents and I think I'm getting a little better with this but I need some help with this one.

I uninstalled my basic FSX to install the deluxe version, I mounted the files and started the install but I get an error saying 'a more recent version exists on my computer'... I would love to install this deluxe version! Anyone know what I should do? I did a clean with cCleaner to get rid of all the unused files and registries but maybe there is something Im missing.

Thanks for the help in advance, please be easy on the complexity, Im still new :)  "

Step 2: mount the iso files with daemon tools lite free

Step 3: Install the game mount the disk 2 when setup says to insert 2nd disk on place of disk 1 in Daemon tool.

Step 4: Copy & paste the crack to the folder in which you just installed MS Flight Simulator X

Install service pack 1 if you want but theres no need to do this according to me ."

,nug700,2012-01-22T02:56Z,"Not looking good, I'm running into issue after issue, error after error. Don't waist your time with this. I've tried just about everything I can think of - When I mount the daa file, and after I fix the installsheild issue, I get errors DURING the actual install of the game itself. Doesn't matter if I run it in winXP SP2 compatibility mode or not, both have there own set of installation errors. and It won't convert it with AnyToISO, i get ""Cannot read SECTOR_SIZE from DMG; The image contains no valid DAA or GBI signature"". Likr I said, A COMPLETE waist of my time, It seems to be like this with ALL the FSX torrents. Just buy the damn game, it's cheap. Oh, and the daa converter torrent you mentioned isn't working either. It's not downloading."

Torrent is also working fine, have no idea what anyone is doing wrong. Loaded both disks into daemon tools, installed fine(no errors) and have been playing for the past 3 hours. Enjoyable
