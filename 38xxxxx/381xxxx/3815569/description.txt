to the latest version 1.1.1

MAC Users note/hint:
This is a recent update(July 1st,2007) and upgrades EZdrummer to the latest version 1.1.1. This update includes all fixes for bugs and crashes and is officially a Universal Binary application which means EZdrummer will now run natively on your Intel-based Macintosh smoothy and efficiantly. This update out dates version 1.0.4 which only provided "support for universal binaries" and didn't include fixes for bugs and crashes. Also be sure that the "Host" or  Recording Software that you are using to run Ezdrummer also has a Universal Binary.
