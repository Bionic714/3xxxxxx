[9:34] O you who believe, many religious leaders and preachers take the people's money illicitly, and repel from the path of GOD. Those who hoard the gold and silver, and do not spend them in the cause of GOD, promise them a painful retribution.

[9:35] The day will come when their gold and silver will be heated in the fire of Hell, then used to burn their foreheads, their sides, and their backs: ""This is what you hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you have hoarded."" 

[8:50] If you could only see those who disbelieved when the angels put them to death! They will beat them on their faces and their rear ends: ""Taste the retribution of Hell.

[8:51] ""This is a consequence of what your hands have sent forth. GOD is never unjust towards the creatures.""

[8:52] This is the same fate as that of Pharaoh's people and those who disbelieved before them. They rejected GOD's revelations, and GOD punished them for their sins. GOD is powerful, and His retribution is severe. 

[9:32] They want to put out GOD's light with their mouths, but GOD insists upon perfecting His light, in spite of the disbelievers."

Is it not written in your qoran that all who are not muslims are enemies of muslims and therefore they must desist???? do we not see brainwash fools claiming allah is great before blowing themselves up along with women and children that did NOTHING to the brainwashed fools or its culture?  did we not see the brutality barbarity and complete senselessness of the Taliban executing women in public for pathethic offenses??  the qoran might be a great and good book to read but if you are an illiterate subject then you are open to suggestive behavior such as the foolish notion that  when you die after blowing your arse up along with 20  others that ALLAH will reward you with vestile virgins, or perhaps you could attend the many wonderful ""schools""  that will  teach your kids that j does not stand for jacks but for jihad something that seens to never end.  Lastly, you claim that 22 ""atheist"" converted to islam yet in your babble you claim that christians were also converted are you implying that christians are also atheists? the US gives you the right to free speech so you are allowed post this thing.

,nalu22,2007-09-22T05:36Z,"Hebrews 13-8 (NIV)

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.

Fulfilled Bible prophecy shows that the Bible is the true work of YHWH.  The Koran does accept the Bible as being true revelation from God (and so it should), however, the Bible's standard rejects the Koran as revelation from God because the predictive power of God is not present there. 

If any prophecy is found in the Koran which is virtually and essentially the same as a predictive prophecy from the Bible, then that quranic prophecy must be regarded as having been copied and originally coming from the Bible (so it cannot be credited to the Koran as a prediction), because the Bible is hundreds of years older than the Koran, and it is well known that Mohammed studied and discussed the Bible with both Christians and Jews in Syria and Medina. The fact that Mohammed was not ignorant of the Bible explains why some quranic prophecies, such as the end of history and final judgment, are quite similar to the Bible.

I pray for you and your family to come back to the true Light of this world.

I'll leave you with these very important word;

John 14:6 (NIV) 

Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

Amen

Our ability to speak and write are all characterisitics of our species; whereas a bird can fly, a fish can swim and breath using gills.  I think the feeling that we need an afterlife is an extension of the survival instinct similar to running from danger to a safe place, a refuge. Religion is used to control the masses and to stall critical thinking.  The belief in an afterlife is a methodology to sooth the fears of death. If there was anytime in history, now, people should be aware of the foundations of popular religions and cultures.
