,zlo666,2007-09-18T23:59Z,"just watched day 8 and there audio and video are slightly out of sync. I really didn't mind, but if you want to fix it for yourself you can do that by using virtualdub (http://www.digital-digest.com/dvd/downloads/showsoftware_virtualdub_346.html)
Just open the avi file with virtualdub, set both audio and video to ""direct stream copy"";  go to Audio->Interleaving menu and set ""delay audio track"" value.  Save as AVi."
