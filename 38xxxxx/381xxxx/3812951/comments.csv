,LRN,2007-11-02T00:04Z,I am looking for someone to seed this torrent permanently instead of me. If you're up to that - post a comment here. I am planning to stop seeding in a week or two.
,Eastern_Grevie,2008-03-24T13:02Z,"Well... I could seed it for as long as I'm alive, I just need to finish downloading it first.
But I'm on a bad line so that might take a loooong time.

Sweden Rulez!

,pilnatasha,2008-03-31T00:56Z,could someone tell please what is the main spoken language?
,LRN,2008-04-06T19:00Z,"""Lang(RUS_ENG_POL_ENG(comments))"" in file name suggests that main spoken language (default audio track) is Russian."
,Sablemoon,2010-11-06T14:18Z,This is ONLY in Russian with English subtitles. No way to watch it in English that I can see! 
,LRN,2011-01-12T16:15Z,"Sablemoon, I've just dropped this video file on the VLC player, and the main menu allows me to switch to different audio and subtitle tracks.
The default (1st) audio track IS in Russian, and the default subtitle track IS in English.
If you don't know how to switch tracks - read the goddamn manual.
If your player does not allow track switching - use some other player (VLC is good enough for most people)."
