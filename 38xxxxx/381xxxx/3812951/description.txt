This is a rip of 2-disc special edition of Aladdin animated movie.
And it is special indeed! First - it's the movie itself. Its quality is the best one,
you won't find anything better anywhere. And i tried to preserve this.
Second - a LOT of extras. In fact, a whole 2nd DVD is filled with these, namely -
deleted scenes, early drawings, deleted songs (including new versions of them!),
interviews etc. And these i riped too. Don't complain about quality - these extra
materials were not meant to be of a good quality from the very beginning.
Main movie and some extras come with subtitles.
