,harvard269,2007-09-22T20:11Z,???Where is the Serial number???
,harvard269,2007-09-22T21:53Z,Where do I find SYS id that Kengen is asking For?
,AmpSim,2007-09-22T22:26Z,"First select the Product: (Amplitube v2.x)
then Push ""Generate""
You get your computer's ID by connecting to the net and requesting one within the Authorization wizard. 

It will display your Machine ID, then Copy it and paste into the KeyGen and push generate to an Authoraztion Code in the response field.

Hit ""Back"" in the wizard a few times and insert the Authorization Code manually.

You now have the FULL VERSION!"
,telephone,2007-09-27T04:43Z,"Keygen not working for me.  Anyone else having problems, or is it just me?  Thanks."
,AmpSim,2007-09-28T10:49Z,"It should work everytime. the Keygen should generate a valid serial and authorization code everytime you hit ""generate"". IT HAS TO.

First using the KeyGen you have to generate a key and enter it into Amplitube, then in the process of ""requesting an authorization code online"" it will display your Machine ID (even though you wont actually request one because the keygen will give it to you), copy that Machine ID  into your Keygen then hit generate at the bottom to recieve your Authorization code (in the ""response"" field).   You Will Now Have the Fully Functional Version with No Restrictions."
,daybrother,2007-09-30T07:01Z,"Doesn't function properly for me either. It gives a good serial but after I paste/type in the machine ID it generates an invalid response code. Tried it every which way I could think of: Write down code and dump cache and restart, Hit generate dozens of times, Connected to net to see if sys ID was the same: No Joy. Thanks anyway mate."
,AmpSim,2007-10-01T03:32Z,"Sorry Guys.
I never actually tried this Keygen. I used the .exe version on my PC to authorize Amplitube for my Mac. I can Upload that one if you dont already have it. you could also run the .exe version of this KeyGen on your mac using the new CrossOver demo."
,guitarist1,2007-10-20T07:35Z,"Great Job, all is working...so far. Now to wail out some riffs.. Krank it!!!"
,LarryG,2007-10-25T02:05Z,Works like a charm on my MacBook Pro 10.4.10
,fujicapeza,2007-12-19T11:22Z,"I can't seem to get it to work either. I tried the Windows KeyGen, too. still no luck.
Is it a version issue? I'm using 10.4.11 G5 PowerMac. Sure would like to transfer my 6.9 sessions over.
Anyone know if Amplitube 1 will work with PTLE 7?"
,rkim,2008-01-13T19:09Z,Has someone figured this out? The key gen doesn't work. It generates an invalid response. I'm running system 10.4.9 with protools 7.0. Does anyone know of another Amplitube 2 torrent? Thanks.
,rubarb,2008-01-24T18:53Z,"does anyone have the hendrix edition?or the keygen from air?sometimes the pc keygen works for mac programs,can't get anything from demonoid"
,rubarb,2008-01-28T20:31Z,"does anyone know where i could find the hendrix
keygen of this program,looked everywhere found silch!! "
,kimhoteb,2008-02-25T08:59Z,Thanx for the torrent! I got the keygen to work fine and the program is GREAT!! Thanx again!
,jump23,2008-03-04T23:38Z,This great! Great sound. Everything ork very well. Thanks
,redthread,2008-04-22T11:19Z,"Works like a charm, just follow AmpSim's perfect instructions.

Many thanks :]"
,cwf327,2008-06-07T03:24Z,Hey thanks a bunch! I did have to use the pc keygen for my Mac O.S. 10.4.11 and it works like a charm
,outinmy95,2008-06-19T03:51Z,someone should make a mac torrent for all the updates...like amplitube metal and such
,vokes,2008-06-27T21:35Z,When I try to open the presets for various guitars and basses it says some codecs missing?
,Evil_Laserlord,2008-07-11T13:15Z,Brilliant upload! Downloaded in five minutes and registration went like a charm. No problems at all (OS 10.5.4). I'll definitely get your Ampeg upload as soon as i get a bass :)
,tvpnyc,2008-07-12T16:07Z,"i can successfully use this as a stand-alone app, but it's not showing up in logic 8.
is anyone successfully using this as an AU plugin?"
,DonnyD,2008-07-16T15:38Z,"Hi Ampsim ,

I'm having problems with the keygen.
The generated key isnt working when i try to enter it in amplitube.
It says one part is incorrect so i cant advance to do the check. :(
What can i do ?

Greetz"
,caixa,2008-08-09T16:34Z,The problem with the keygen seems to be that it gets its math wrong under certain processor/OS combinations and produces an incorrect response. On my G5 iMac running 10.4.11 the response was incorrect. When I ran it on my Macbook running 10.5.4 using the same serial and system ID as on the iMac it generated a difference response which when entered on the iMac successfully validated the product. Hope this helps someone.
,zmazli,2008-08-20T20:32Z,"thanks AmpSim!

great torrent! everything works fine..keygen is a walk in the park..no problem on my osx 10.5.4!

cheers!"
,montypi,2008-10-31T08:26Z,"EVERYTHING WORKS %100

I'm even able to forget the included AmpliTube, and download the latest version from their website. Awesome torrent, first Mac keygen I've seen!"
,davidpaul20,2008-11-01T01:38Z,Does anyone know where I can download Ik Multimedia ARC system??
,maconsultant,2008-11-02T16:43Z,"hey davidpaul20 i have the installation files for the IK ARC system and a serial that allows for installation what i dont have is a keygen for the IK Multimedia ARC System to generate a response, if some kind soul will create a keygen for the IK Multimedia Arc system id be more than happy to upload it here.. Please let me know.."
,Evil_Laserlord,2008-11-11T08:29Z,Any chance of Amplitube Metal? I'd love that.
,gnomepark,2008-11-17T03:19Z,"Tried entering the response in Keygen about 10 times and I still get the red underlined  ""...doesn't match..."" notice.  Do I need to keep generating a new serial number and keep repeating????  How many times does it take till it ""takes""?"
,berkov,2008-11-17T21:41Z,"Yeah, I'm having the same problems... It excepts serial number, but the authorization code is rejected... Am I doing something wrong? I put my system ID in keygen, which I got from Disk Utility. Should I do something else?"
,sparks7sparks,2008-11-21T08:44Z,Anyone know where I can get the Keygen for Amplitube metal?  I can't seem to find it at all.  Anything would help.  Thanks.
,sparks7sparks,2008-11-21T08:47Z,sorry...forgot to say for Mac
,Psyks,2008-11-29T22:17Z,"Help! I entered all the details and everything started fine, but now it's asking me to enter the keys again??"
,johnyauboy,2008-12-25T14:28Z,"Thanks man, now i got the best amp sim on my computer I am a happy man...:)"
,Guzzla,2009-01-05T17:29Z,"Hi, i have a problem finding the system id. And i think itÂ´s becuse my mac is not connected to the internet and i dont plan to connect it to internet.
Is there some other way to get/find the 32 digit id?"
,Guzzla,2009-01-05T17:58Z,ok i found it... Skivverktyg =)
,Guzzla,2009-01-05T18:00Z,"haha lol, im blind :x"
,CzarRose,2009-02-22T02:08Z,where's the authorization code? or is this a demo?
,guggevigge,2009-03-18T19:46Z,I have tried to get this working on osx 10.4. I read the thread but does someone have another keygen? or can post a serial that works here.  Thanks again
,lintuhovi,2009-03-28T14:49Z,"I just can't get the authorization code. IK Multimedia Product Registration Page says wrong serial number!
Help pls?"

,kobra813,2009-04-01T23:43Z,"i cant get the kgen to work its giving me an error.

do i register this online? please help"
,kobra813,2009-04-02T00:00Z,"alright so ampsim i followed your instructions to a T. still no luck

caixa. so i have a powerbook g4 with osx 10.5.4
and im not able to get the keygen to work.

does anyone know if there is a fix?"
,posterboy0,2009-04-12T07:59Z,Thanx very much for this share and the keygen instructions were most helpful (this is one bizarre authorization sequence)!  Keygen worked perfectly on my Intel iMac with Win XP under Parallels.
,Axolotlkips,2009-04-25T04:16Z,"I'm pretty sure this keygen just hates non-intel macs.

I've had this old G4 on loan and decided to try the installer on it as a test- it didn't work. I then tried it on another non-intel in my network/hardware lab, and sure enough- no worky.

The two intels I've tried it on, however (both powerbooks) seemed to produce the correct keys."

Works fine for me. After about 6 months it'll ask you for the serial again again, rinse repeat, works beautifully again!

You don't need to be online. Press the 'Authorise from another computer' button."
