,frederic-16,2008-05-17T17:28Z,"Can t you read MTF !!!!!

It is ""The invincible Iron Man""(cartoon) not ""Iron Man"" ( the one that came out on 02/05/2008)"
,joinass,2008-07-21T02:32Z,"Hey can u please seed again =)   saw the movie and i remembered from when i was a little boy.... just loved that cartoon =) 
Please Grawtail !"
,bruno212,2009-05-08T08:05Z,"When I first saw this torrent, it was being circulated simply as IRON_MAN.ISO. It is true that there are a lot of dumbass uploaders around uploading a Cartoon at the same time as the live action movie, without putting a description on it. But anyway, I did watch the cartoon and it was not bad. In fact, I think the storyline and screenplay in the cartoon was much better than the Robert Downey version."
