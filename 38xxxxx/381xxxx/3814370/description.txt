52-Pickup is a single player card game played for points. Cards are thrown randomly onto a pile and the player's job is to remove the cards to form poker hands of straights or sets. Cards are removed to form two "tricks"; each trick can be used to uncover the cards needed by the other trick - thus the need for strategy and brain power. Intensely addictive and with a bright outdoorsy color scheme makes playing a delight. The game offers out different pile layouts to challenge players plus score boards for each layout. Players can also replay identical games to try to improve their scores. High scores are saved online for global competition. In-game help and tutorial makes learning quick and easy. Freeware.
