,titanium5,2008-03-22T03:23Z,Please Seed. Need the Subtitles... There are not any that I can find on the 'Net
,klezmik,2008-04-16T23:44Z,anyone got to get the subs to work with vlc on osx?
,friedfish,2008-04-19T19:03Z,"i have been finding this for ages, once i have it i will seed it on and off continously"
,klezmik,2008-04-21T00:15Z,"seriously, how do I get thos subs to work? Anyone ? ?"
,heckler409,2008-05-10T00:50Z,"After digging through the net and finally opening up the damn sub file it looks as though it's actually in jap, not eng.

It also looks like the sub file is fucked.  I can't find another eng sub file for this movie anywhere which is a damn shame cause this is one hell of a movie."
,heckler409,2008-05-10T01:11Z,"Ok, so I found that if you use a program called BSplayer it will work.  You have to set the subs to english with the player.

What a pain in the ass."
,friedfish,2008-06-16T14:25Z,"thxs heckler409 for letting us know how the sub file works

i actually had to watch the whole movie in japanese..still seeding this baby irregularly.."
,pm911t,2008-07-27T11:34Z,i have no audio. anyone any clue?
,diskspace,2008-10-10T14:47Z,"This sure took a looong time.
First of all, Thank you so much, Spyle, for doing such a great job on making those subs workable.
For those who want to put this movie on a DVD;
Most burningprograms donÂ´t support plane text files. So you need to convert the plain text file to a supported file like a SRT.file.  Use ''Subtitle Workshop'' is very easy and done in a few seconds. you can download this program for free at:

Also a great program for synchronizing you subs.
take care."
,gannofdreams,2008-10-20T15:32Z,"Please, seed more than 1:1 after you finish downloading. I have a 2.5 ratio for this torrent at this moment, but when I'll reach 3.5 I think I'll quit. Seed more - it' s really a great movie."
,MrRipYourHeadOff,2009-01-01T20:46Z,"Spyle, I think those two subtitle files you posted have expired. I can't download them from those links."
,sapperbullit,2009-02-02T04:23Z,"Subs dont work with VLC cant find any working subs on the NET either, check out subtitles first before you download the whole thing. 

Good movie but no english subs ill have to watch it on VHS."
,iamlws,2009-06-23T02:08Z,"Hey guys, 
I tried with BSplayer but I didn't get no sound. So instead I just changed the sub previously names DVD_VIDEO.sub to Heaven.and.Earth(1990)DvDrip.Ac3[Jap]-GAVRIAS.sub and VLC recognized it just fine. 
No need for other subs just changing the sub filename fix it all."
,firefox83,2009-07-30T02:25Z,"Hey all, just DL this movie. Great movie, thanks for the upload. Did what iamlws said, changed the file to read Heaven.and.Earth(1990)DvDrip.Ac3[Jap]-GAVRIAS.sub and works with no problems. Even media player loaded the subs."
,dark_lord777,2012-03-05T09:18Z,"Since I couldn't find an SRT version of this films subtitle file, I posted one at the following link:

 I just made it, so hopefully all is in order. Please post any problems that might come up and see to fixing them..."
,dark_lord777,2012-03-07T05:06Z,"I re-edited the former file and updated it to fix some errors. Hopefully it'll work now. Please discard the link in my previous post and use this one instead...
