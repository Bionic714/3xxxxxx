----The Movie-----

Set in feudal Japan, between 1553 and 1564, the daimyo Kagetora (Enoki) must protect his lands and his people from the ambitions of the warlord Takeda (Tsugawa).

Kagetora is Uesugi Kenshin, In the film, Kagetora must defend his province of Echigo against Takeda Shingen. The famous battles include Battle of Kawanakajima, where Shingen is attacked by Uesugi Kenshin.

The film is large scale dramatic battle scene filmed in Canadian forest and open fields. Many of the regular soldiers wear masks that were historically for mounted Samurai or leaders (over 300 horses used). This is because many actors were Caucasian Canadians or other ethnicities not Japanese or East Asian.

Similar films include Ran, but it is not as battle intense.

Rare and great movie, one of the best concerning the feudal age Japan.
