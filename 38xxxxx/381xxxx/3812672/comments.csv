,NosTraDomus,2007-09-22T07:18Z,"Looks like everything is going good- ill will prob. stop superseeding after 10 successful seeders are done, feel free to use anything in the file, share it,upload it to rapidshare..do whatever- ------------------------------------------------------------ even use this to deligate fights, schedule or challengs then go on any IM and share the IP and connect from there..This is a nice backup-have fun"
,NosTraDomus,2007-09-23T19:32Z,"around 10pm+4zuluhrs i will probaly stop seeding..so ou might notice a slight decrease in data transferance, and mayb a pause..theres enough to make it go on even longer. "

,xexyzl,2007-11-21T03:33Z,"OK, i've got this thing working on XP Pro, albeit with crashes (understandable).  However, I'm having trouble playing on Vista.  No matter which options I try in Compatibility mode, I can't get it to run the installer without crashing or giving me the windows 95/98 message.  I've even tried copying over the microprose folders and missing dlls from my XP partition, but it says I'm missing the Software Render Files.  Any tips?"
,NosTraDomus,2007-11-25T06:59Z,"yea, using XP to run this game is pushing it, then usinig Vista, its not good, vista operates on a differnt scale then its predessors,mayb soo or some other hard core game has found a patch to make xp/98/2k gmaes run smoother on Vista- its  a cool game, and Xfire supports it-"
,TylerCF,2007-11-25T18:33Z,"i have the file but i don't know how to install it, how do you explore the .iso file? Mine just keeps opening in my cd creator program, which program should i be opening it in?"
,TylerCF,2007-11-25T19:21Z,"never mind dude, figured it out, great torrent."

,AdriZ,2008-02-06T12:20Z,oh.. just do what tyler said :P
,NosTraDomus,2008-02-14T04:03Z,"It might be alittle tricky to use compatibility on it, but it WILL work, also dont know if i mentioned this but, XFIRE does offer it..atleast it did upto a month ago..other wise you need DIrect COnnect thru IP w/o a Router, only thru direct connection.. ie, From Cable Outlet to Cable Modem to Computer..

Getting past mission 1:
Its a Hardware Problem-ive gotten 3 emails,
some even bought the game, and installed it, and still had problems, so it might be a problem with the Processor maybe u have a AMD..Duron? or a AMD- "

http://mtxgear.mektek.net/MW4/

MechWarrior: Living Legends is Out...though seems to be a user made mod...has SOME good things..

MechWarrior 5: was due, but since BattleTech series said the game had to many similar mechs like theirs, they SUED, so MW5 is on hold for now...they even pulled the Trailers...

nice to see some seeders...
there are other online tools to play older games online like hamachi or XFIRE"
