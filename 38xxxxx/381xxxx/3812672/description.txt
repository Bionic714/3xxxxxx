The third game in the popular MechWarrior series. Massive Mechs, awesome firepower, and 3D action combine in MechWarrior 3. MechWarrior 3 is a quantum upgrade on all fronts from the excellent MechWarrior 2, which is saying quite a bit. The tremendous attention to detail in the graphics, gameplay and virtually every other aspect makes this one of the best games of the 1990s, let alone 1999. It is the graphics that will initially grab you and pull you in. Flowing landscapes and wonderful animation are all well and good but MechWarrior 3 goes one better. Shoot off an enemy Mech's leg and you'll see the pieces go flying as the enemy crashes to the ground. Drop a Smoke Jaguar tank and you'll marvel at the intricate explosion. This is good stuff.

I compiled all the maps I had, so theres 302 @ 45mb..zipped
alot of clanner maps and personal ones. this is just to get you started..
I also added a few..extras...some trainers..one of mine i made that is compatiblewith WIN XP PRO version(P)

Window XP installation Notes:
To Install/Run Mw3, 
â?¢click on setup.exe and goto properties.
â?¢across the top click on the "compatibility" tab.
â?¢click on the box "Run this Program in compatibility mode for" (Choose win98)
â?¢click the boxes that say.. "Disable Visuak Themes" and "Turn off advanced text services" do those to the setup.exe and after install might need it for the mech3.exe-so if u get an error, just do that to the file thats saying error.
This way works..cause im using it right now and playing.
