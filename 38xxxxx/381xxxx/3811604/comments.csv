,Ka3aK75,2007-09-24T07:15Z,Keys from BlueCart v9 do not approach to BlueCart v9.5
,Rock-it Man,2007-09-26T03:33Z,you can use 'demo' to make this work on your pc.  in the rar they have an unlock.txt that contains this key: JFNSS-HAMNP-FD5K2-KEK37-JCL4N
,marktman1,2007-09-27T22:44Z,"offcource that code does not work on your Unit.

the 10 digit Idnumber of your Unit has to put into a keygenerator in combi with an IDnumber of the maps in this case BC v9.5 is IDnumber ""254"".

mix it and you have a 25 digit unlockcode.
