I have a Gameshark 2 disc, I have a DVD+-R,RW,DL,Rom,Ram... burner. I have a CD-R,RW burner. I have one 8MB Memory card for the PS2. I have DVD+R and DVD-R discs. My DVD burner is 18 x 18. My DVD discs are 16x and hold 4.7GB. I have all programs like Nero 7 Ultra Edition. I have 3 drives: DVD drive, DVD burner drive, CD drive. So if someone could please tell me how to do this. I'll really appreciate it. By the way my e-mail is Narinelover4life@Gmail.com TNX!!"

,BadSwe,2007-10-07T03:54Z,My SECOND iso i try on new Fifa... And IT did NOT work with Swap Magic. Freeze at matchloading. IF any REALLY got it to work 100% (Played it through). Please inform burnprogram and more.. I tried it in Alcohol120 and DVDdecrypter... No success...
,BadSwe,2007-10-07T03:56Z,MY guess is it wont.. 07 never worked until re-packed versions came... and they are usually smaller (ex. 07 was around 3.6 Gb).
,marrtin,2007-10-07T09:32Z,"God damn BadSwe. Extract and burn iso alcohol 120 4x speed. and it works fine:)
Fuck that swap magic and buy somewere mod chip(50 euro )and you all ps2 burned games working perfect."
,BadSwe,2007-10-07T11:09Z,"Lol.. Why should i chip it, then i got SM-disc and ALL garantees left?? I got 190 copied games.. all works 100% Only FIFA thats fucks up every year. I HAD we working re-pack software for that too... But lost it.
AND: it does NOT work in any case with SM... without repack. I have copied in 20 year, so i know."
,oknitro,2007-10-08T05:17Z,"painter21 -

,varunvikram1,2007-10-14T19:29Z,"well i downloaded the game yesterday but it does not  load after the ""press start"" screen. can someone help.i burn't the game with nero"
,ghostridermick,2007-11-30T14:35Z,Is this ENGLISH ???????
,DiDok_przemo,2007-12-08T09:21Z,"When a game don't want to start using SwapMagic or causes problems, download (from some sites) Zone Loader DVD, burn it on DVD, run Swap Magic, change disc to ZoneLoader, run it, then swap discs and run the game. Works with Scarface... =]"
,Gutteslask,2007-12-16T18:27Z,"Can somebody please, please, please give me a detailed instruction of how to turn it from a downloaded file to a game you can play on a PS2??? Please, I need help!"
,ben6ft1,2007-12-20T19:16Z,"crazymofo, if you use swapmagic3 you can select pal or ntsc from the main screen, it doesnt matter where you live. as for telx...i would rather donate my PS2 to charity than move to the UK! Thanks for the upload."
,lunderlende,2007-12-25T00:57Z,"Hi. I have now downloaded this file from you. I'm burned the ISO-file with Alchol 120%. All worked fine, until I tried to play a match. The loading in Fifa 08 stopped when I had loaded about the half of the match. (I tried with ""Kick off"" in the game)

I have Swap magic version 3.6, I have also tried with ZoneLoader. But all the time the loading stop!! 

Can someone here tell me what I shall do?  Does this work with someone other who use SwapMagic ? "
,DiDok_przemo,2007-12-25T20:32Z,"Google says that you must rebuild image file with ISOBuster or sth else - i'll try to do it later, because I don't have any clean discs now =]"

,DiDok_przemo,2007-12-29T19:23Z,"In FIFA 08 and NHL 08 rebuilding is much easier - just open the .iso file in UltraISO, copy all the files to your local drive 9notice that they are only ~2,5GB in size instead of 4,5GB!) and burn them in Nero (use UDF/ISO DVD, set UDF type to physical, 1.02) - that's all. works perfect for me =]
(Remember - FIFA works only on S.M. 3.6 or higher!!!)"

Visit this website- it is awesome- check it out- you will Thank me for this. I swear on my life the greatest day of my life was when I found out about this corporation. I make so much money doing so little. A MUST check out website. "
,kayjiggy,2008-02-12T19:34Z,You need to extract the image files using ISObuster or UltraISO to your hard drive. Open Nero and select UDF/ISO mode. Go to the UDF tab and select Manual setting and set this to 1.02. Burn at 4X and it will work. Rebuilding the iso image using genie will not work. But just extracting the image files and burning with Nero will do. Cheers!!
,petesdragon,2008-02-17T11:10Z,"Unzipped + used Magic ISO - DIDN'T WORK
Unzipped + used Nero - DIDN'T WORK
Tried using ISO Buster - DIDN'T WORK
Tried using Alcohol 120% - DIDN'T WORK

The best I could get was the game loaded, however as soon as a game started it would freeze, very annoying.
Thanks for the upload, but sadly was a complete waste of time+discs for me"
,helpmy...,2008-03-16T08:35Z,thanks please seeda
,mavman67,2008-06-07T11:43Z,"Just unrar the files. (Select the first one *.r00)
Then burn Image from the ISO with Nero.

,bob007,2008-06-12T09:55Z,what does this mean  FIFA works only on S.M. 3.6 or higher!
,Gaslighttwin31,2008-06-27T21:10Z,Thanks for this upload. I did have trouble with the game freezing but I followed the link kulebrun above kindly posted and it now works fine.

S.M. 3.6 = s.m=swamp magic (a cip program) and 3.6 is just the verson "
