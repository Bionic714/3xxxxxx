,sheerliberation,2007-12-23T11:38Z,"Does not contain early singles such as Feuerrader, Kokain, Schwarzes Glas, or Wut will nicht sterben. All in all, though, great release. "
,dave_stein,2008-05-29T05:50Z,"the rip for ""Reise, Reise"" is horrible. It skips at the end of every song."
,W1Ck3dYoungMan,2008-12-17T23:11Z,"Actually. Wut Will Nicht Sterben isn't a Rammstein song, It's by ""Die Puhdys"" Till Lindemann (Rammstein's leadsinger) has a guest appearance of sorts on it.

Other than that though. this is a fine torrent, I'll seed for a while.

Wish it had Stripped though.... :(

,SanDiabla,2009-07-18T21:25Z,"thanks for the torrent.

altho i must inform you that 192kbps is not ""super quality"" and is in fact borderline unacceptable for most people. "
