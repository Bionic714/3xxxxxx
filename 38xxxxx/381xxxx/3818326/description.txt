The Beatles Live at Shea Stadium, August 15, 1965 (Tracks 1-10)... and then, The Beatles Live at Candlestick Park, August 29, 1966... (Their final show ever!!!) (Tracks 11-21). The last song, Long Tall Sally is incomplete because the original tape ran out. Supposedly recorded by Paul McCartney himself... ENJOY!!!
