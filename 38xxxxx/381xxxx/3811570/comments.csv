,Zeppelinfan1,2009-04-03T21:02Z,T downloaded this and it messes up towards the end of the movie. I will redownload this and see if it was just glitches not from the torrent. Will let you know if it is the torrent messed up.
,Zeppelinfan1,2009-04-03T21:05Z,Also it was in the 4th vob file that was messed up just so you know.
,Zeppelinfan1,2009-04-04T17:42Z,"It is confirmed that the 4th vob file is corrupt, and it jumps some also."
,CSNYguy,2009-07-28T06:42Z,"This film definitely has a glitch at the 1:49:00 mark. I downloaded it twice also. Unfortunately, the glitch screws up one of the very best scenes of the movie."
