http://team-fortress2.narod.ru/
Is it the same than this here or another version and can anyone plz telle me why I can't connect to the servers listed on the page above?
Plz help me I want to play that game.

,Woundfucker,2007-09-26T18:45Z,"Oh I just saw the links above and before did not realise that it's the same version.
So my version seems to be okay.
But why can't I connect to a server? I have no Firewall but my router, do I have to open ports on it?
Thx"
,Darkwand76,2007-09-26T18:46Z,Anyone know the command to create a Dedicated server with these files?

,Zoies,2007-09-27T09:11Z,"To make it a bit clear for you poor poeple who haven't managed to play on any online server:

1. Start the game through the ---> start.bat "
,Zoies,2007-09-27T09:13Z,"2. When the game is running type this in the console (the window with a lot of text):

connect *IP*"
,Zoies,2007-09-27T09:15Z,"I've had problem connecting to some servers.
If the game tells you the server's map differs from yours just try another IP."
,cebe_1,2007-09-27T17:53Z,Some of the maps like Lazytown and Hydra isnt like the servers! Also some say that there is a new protocol from 8 to 9. please fix :D
,Dezzo90p,2007-09-28T09:14Z,How do i fix so i can get the console up in counter-strike: source/team fortress 2/half-life 2 etc.. ???
,cuprav6,2007-09-28T15:24Z,"you need to type

-console 

in your launch options"
,Ilendor,2007-09-28T17:12Z,"Can you seed please?
It works so slow..."
,Woundfucker,2007-09-28T17:49Z,"Download it from here:http://team-fortress2.narod.ru/
You can download 5 files at once with a max speed of 50kb for one file. Than you have to wait 3 hours or you change your ip(router restart) and download it without wating. ;)

,Cookie_Holiday,2007-09-29T18:34Z,For some reason when it gets to the loading screen the game closes itself? Any idea what the problem may be? It says directx needs to be at least v8 and i've got v9 so I'm not too sure fo what's going on.
,Glibe,2007-09-30T17:47Z,"Cookie, I assume you're starting the game with start.bat, right?

Otherwise, could you be a bit more specific about what your problem is? Descriptions, etc."
,kaberg92,2007-09-30T19:23Z,"can you play it online throe steam if you have an stem crack that says you got the game?

,HisHighness,2007-10-29T15:44Z,"Hi, I've got the same problem as another user but I'll explain mine as best I can.

When I try to start the game it seems to load up fine, I get the Valve screen with the guy with the spigot in the back of his head, then I get the loading screen with the TF2 chars on it, but then the screen goes black, I can hear the music but I don't see anything except my mouse pointer. When I move my mouse around sometimes the pointer is like the one when your over text to select it and sometimes it's an arrow depending on where I am in the screen.

Any help would be appreciated, and if I figure it out on my own I'll post the answer."
