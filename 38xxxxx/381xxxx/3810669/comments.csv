,TonyTheCat,2009-06-02T04:16Z,"lol ...what a joke you are, you will take from a bitcomet user but you won't give back to them ,ban them, and try to get others to ban them because you believe your way is the best and the behavior of the program isn't up to your standards. I agree bitcomet was f***ed with too much over the years that's why i use an older version and have done so for 6 years .this is a public tracker if you don't like public programs then maybe you should stick to the private websites and stop bitching about what clients people use and let the site moderators deal with it instead of being a hypocrite... what a loser mike18xx"
