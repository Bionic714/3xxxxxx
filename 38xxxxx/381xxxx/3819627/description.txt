Neo Turf Masters captures all the fun of a bar golf game without the pain of pinching your hand in a trackball. This Neo Geo favorite sports four different (and challenging!) 18 hole courses and a host of six generic duffers, but donâ€™t expect see Tigerâ€™s smiling mug here. Grab a friend for a skins match or hone your game solo and experience the essence of golfing pared down to simple, fun controls.
