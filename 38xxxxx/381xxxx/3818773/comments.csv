,arathra,2008-02-08T20:12Z,"Wow, that was fast. Great, thanks! Hope they reissue this one one day."
,Binary-Data,2008-12-31T07:56Z,"Wow! Surprised to find this on here... I love TPB and all, I just don't normally find such rare releases here. Please seed more though, I'm getting insanely low down speed, and I'll even seed it for a while. I'm getting this for my brother because he is a huge Tori fan and this is the only album he doesn't have yet. Kinda a late christmas present ya know. Many thanks slimmonroe, I haven't been able to find this elsewhere."
