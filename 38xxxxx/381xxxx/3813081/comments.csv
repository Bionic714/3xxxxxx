,mrspock09,2007-09-24T03:41Z,ok i found out what to do. and for any1 else having the same problem i had heres your answer. for some reason the youtube ripper didnt want more than 1 file stored in that folder (C:/program files/Youtube ripper.....). so all you have to do is move the file somewhere else (i made a folder for my desktop) and then the ripper will let you download more. hope it helps
