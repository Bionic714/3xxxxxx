,LordSpade,2007-11-17T00:06Z,"I think I fixed my copy of Nero! This is exactly what I did:

1. Installed with Nero 8 keygen.

2. Tried to run Nero Vision, annoying popup comes up and makes Nero into a demo version.

3. Deleted NeroPatentActivation.exe from C:\Program Files\Common Files\Nero\Shared\NL3

4. Clicked on C:\Program Files\Common Files\Nero\Nero Web\SetupX.exe

5. On the left side, clicked on License

6. Added this license: 1K22-2867-0K95-61K4-5000-CKAC-AA8X

7. REMOVED Nero 8 demo from the list.

Works great! No more popups!"

4. Clicked on C:\Program Files\Common Files\Nero\Nero Web\SetupX.exe
when i click the icon for the SetupX nothing comes up what do i do now?"
,LordSpade,2007-11-18T20:10Z,"Yeah, I think I did that wrong.

Either go on Start -> Run and paste this:

""C:\Program Files\Common Files\Nero\Nero Web\SetupX.exe"" -ScParameter=65  MODE=""update""

OR

Go on Start->Programs->Nero 8->Nero Toolkit- >Nero ControlCenter

Then go onto step 5. Hope it works."

Hell yeah thank you it worked oh just some helpful info i used the 
Go on Start->Programs->Nero 8->Nero Toolkit- >Nero ControlCenter  Information that you provided and it worked and its no longer a demo but i still get a pop up that says ""Patent Activation Required"" didnt know if there was a way around that or not. again thanks alot!"
