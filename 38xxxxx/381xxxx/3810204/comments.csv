much appreciated

I watched this game in the pub as well. Be interesting to see how England fares against the winner of this match"
,frank_791,2007-09-18T18:34Z,"Yes, it will be very interesting indeed. The brits will need to sharpen up considerably if they want to qualify to the finals... But the only question in my mind is which team besides SA, NZ and AU to move on to semifinal. "
