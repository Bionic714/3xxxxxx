,Nailbanger,2007-09-23T17:25Z,"Who's the dickhead?If you are submissive enough to march or fly into a mushroom cloud,You are nothing but canon fodder anyways.

Napoleon and Hitler ate through millions of you loyal trusting idiots, and really,Not much has changed since feudal times.The aristocracy sees something they want in another country and they send the poor and young to seize it for them.
The ruling class (likje George Bush) will be kept far away from any bullets thanks to daddy's connections.
Suck my balls you useless piece of human shit!"
,Nailbanger,2007-09-23T17:39Z,"The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country to have nuked two cities full of civilians.You cold warriors are a dying breed thank god..You see Jesus in the mushroom cloud.
Then we permanantly irradiated the Pacific Islands of Rondulap,Bikini,and many others..In 1954 Edward Tellers plan to use a hydrogen bomb to blast out a deep water port north of the arctic circle was finally defeated.

He consoled himself by loading a ship with a nuclear weapon off of the Aleutian Islands..Strong seas blew the ship off of it's anchorage and it detonated an extremely powerful bomb which killed millions of marine mammals and birds.Many Aleutian Islands are permanently contaminated,In one of our richest fishing grounds.Thats the problem with giving power to morons.
Of course the Soviets were way worse,Large parts of Siberia and the Arctic seas are contaminated by them,But the USA really blazed the trail into idiocy.They felt that they had to keep up with our arms race that was engineered.


Just for you Mon Amour I will also post Atomic Cafe,Radio Bikini and Dark Circle.Oh yes, and the doc on the Militarization of space,Helen Caldicott,Bruce Gagion.
Fuck the nuclear cowboys who have contaminated our home with their stupid wars and bullshit."

,housemusc,2007-10-21T06:20Z,Go f#@# yourself. You are just jealous of us AMERICANS. That we are truly free and we dont live in a socialist craphole. You liberals think that people care what you say outside of your kook pals.
,Nailbanger,2007-10-23T23:02Z,"What the fuck are you talking about you cocksucker? I am American,lol.

Does that mean that mean I am proud of our terrible environmental and nuclear records? Fuck no!! I hope you get drafted you little cunt,Then you can listen to your shitty house music while you fight George Bush's wars for him... another simplistic asshole to die in the mud because they dont understand anything.Just like Stalingrad,lol, millions of dumb ass ball lickers like you."
,marchalero,2007-12-15T14:51Z,WE NEED MORE MIND OPENERS LIKE THIS.THANKS
,Nailbanger,2007-12-23T16:19Z,"I hate having to go off on people.But assholes like this clown really annoy the shit out of me,perfect fucking Nazis, never question authority, just wave your corny flag and toe the party line. America has never done ANYTHING wrong!!!

This planets endless supply of morons assures that people like Bush or Hitler will always have someone to lick his balls or fight his wars.

Chinese murderers and African strongmen only exist because of their lackeys and obedient Armies of morons; don't you realize that if you all say ""no"" at one time ,The Bushes and Saddams no longer exist?

The murderers in Tiena min square rolled over unarmed protesters with tanks because they were told to. They ceased to be human and to use the higher powers of reason and mercy; they keep the butchers of Tibet in power, obedient little flag waving submissive morons.

The only people I respect are those who think for themselves- all the rest can only blame their obedience and reverence for ignorant traditions and nostalgia if this planet dies.Which it is well on it's way to..."
,Amsterdamfire,2008-02-02T01:19Z,"Look guys, this is how I see it:
War is never good, nuclear weapons are not good, but there's more to it. If the USA hadn't dropped them A-bombs on Japan, there would have been more casualties of war, in the years to come, than the number of deaths in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. It's the sad true. But now, I think the A-bomb and the H-bomb are serving more to a cause of showing off, you know, it's like saying: Don't fuck with us because we have this up our sleeve. 
America, Russia, France, Israel, Pakistan and somemore (?) have actual Nuclear Weaponry. And though nuclear weapons are bad, they may actually lead to peace. Check out Japan and the USA today! A lot of kids watch only Japanese cartoons and play Sony's Playstation, dusplayed on a sony TV. And some of you guys out there will probably have a Thoshiba computer or monitor. So see, everything has two sides! Oh and in case you wonder, I'm not an American, I'm Dutch (but I love America!)

Just my opinion people!
Peace!"
,Nailbanger,2008-02-05T03:05Z,"Thanks for your voice my friend.
I am an American that is proud of all the great things about my country, But we cannot rest on our laurels, we must continue the process of fighting off fascists and robber barons.

The a bomb was a hard call, I have heard your ""opinion before, that the Japs would have fought to the last person and that this massive display saved lives.Maybe this is true, with their fanatical devotion to not surrendering.
All the same, this is a horrible weapon that is still killing the unborn today. Hibakusha is the Japanese word for a victim of radiation exposure. Babies are still born or born deformed with chromosomal damage.

We have hundreds of ""superfund sites"" here in the states, Leftover toxic factories from the cold war.Places where bomb components were milled and assembeled are pretty much contaminated and leaking their poison into the environment.

The pentagon now directly controls one third of all shuttle payloads, maintaining the illusion of a ""civilian space program"" run by NASA. 

When the shuttle columbia blew up over east Texas, Nasa sent teams in with class five radiation suits because not even they knew what was in the pentagon section. At the same time that they are running through rural East Texas with geiger counters, the PR machine started up, claiming that there was ""no danger to the public""
. Of course the obvious question for me then was "" So why the fuck are the recovery teams in full radiation suits?"""
,proto.pm,2008-02-22T15:41Z,"good shit nailbanger . world opinion is turning on your dirty little government finally , real people cannot be silenced . keep up the fight , respect ! "
,murphysmaster,2008-05-08T23:12Z,"America is a wonderful nation but its leaders don't always do what the people of the nation would have them do, as is true with all nations. However, just because a citizen follows its nations laws doesnt make it an animal blindly following its master. Freedom of speech is one of our blessed rights, not seen in many other nations. "
,bitlebatlebo,2008-05-22T09:15Z,"I do enjoy when people have an open mind and write it so freely as you do nailbanger, so thank you for the input and for the files. I agree in most of what you are saying, but the thing about the Hiroshima and the Nagasaki bombing beeing a hard call is plane out bullshit, at least the second bombing. At least it shouldn't be. The japanese emperror had sad that the japanese would surrender before the second bombing, and in feudal Japan the ""emperors word is law"" still they dropped it. The most probable reason is that the first bomb was a uranium-235 bomb while the second was a plotunium-239 bomb which both had to be tested. And it is important to remember that the respect for japanese lives wasn't that high in the US at the time. The US even put many of there own japanese citezens in concentration camps during the war without trial.

And I think it's a bit naiv to call soldiers following an unhuman order for nazi's who don't questions authority, because not to follow a direct order is mutiny and punishable by death. So an officer can put a bullet in your skull the instance you say no.

And to you stupid fucks who think that the Soviet was much worse then the US should read som non-american written history and a bit physics. When an a-bomb is detonated above ground the radioactiv dust is spread far out in the atmospehere, and the winds spread the radioactivity homogeneously around the north part of the globe. The US did about 30 more detonations then the soviet togheter they did between 250 and 300 detonations, most between 1960-1963. And in the following years world wide leukemia cases where up several times what they had normaly been. So Soviet was not worse, US was the first to develope A-bombs and H-bombs and did more detonations causing more radioactive dust on the planet."
,Nailbanger,2008-06-03T17:46Z,"Great comments and you are correct, the ""snap 2"" mid air explosion in 1964 vaporised several pounds of plutonium over the Indian ocean, making it one of the most lethal events never to be talked about.

Bruce Gagnon claims that the spike in world cancers can be traced back to this single event. There have been numerous ones since then.
http://www.911inquiry.org/Presentations/BruceGagnon.htm 

The Soviets continued to dump their radioactive wastes into the sea long after it became clear it would be a problem. The seas of off Novya Zemlaya is one vast radioactive waste dump. Other lakes in Siberia are just as bad; but I don't want to play the ""who was worse game"".

Let's agree that humans are so consumed with killing each other and fighting over resources that they do not notice the poisons they are killing themselves with. Both America AND Russia lost the cold war, millions of cases of cancer and wasted trillions of rubles and dollars.

Bush , Hitler , Stalin, Napoleon , Mugabe, Pinochet , Marcos, Sudharto, Tian Shan.......

No one race or country can be blamed for the world's problems, all humans carry the unfortunate traits of nationalism and racism. Thank god that Hitler hadn't quite figured out the bomb or there would be no Russians left. And Stalin killed more Russians than Germans, what common and base part of our human brain brought these very real monsters to life?

Americans have no monopoly on mass murder, pollution or being manipulated into ""electing"" tyrants. We are only Europe's bastard stepchild, but we learned well the European lessons of killing and using violence to acquire resources.

 Our collective crime is learning too well from the previous bad examples , and having the resources to execute these ill conceived plans. American occupation of Iraq was just par for the course when Britain did it in 1926, we are just newbies wanting to carve an American empire over the corpses of indigenous people everywhere. Much like the French, British, Germans, Belgians and many others did in the previous centuries.

If they had the power to do it, no two bit dictator would hesitate to use the a bomb, that includes the dictator appropriate to your particular ethnicity."

Politics aside, what movies are in this .iso file?"
