A little late, but better than never comes a special about the third season of Prison Break. Released by BiA, Access: All Areas is a behind the scenes documentary uncovering some filming locations, techniques and secrets, which you can?t really notice while watching the show. There are also many interviews with Prison Break actors and producers about the show. Great stuff if you?re a huge fan of PB.
