What's New in MAtlab Release 2007b

R2007b includes Simulink 7, new features in MATLAB, two new products released since R2007a, and updates and bug fixes to 82 other products. Subscribers to MathWorks Software Maintenance Service can download R2007b product updates. 

R2007b introduces a major new feature: C code generation from Embedded MATLAB functions directly at the MATLAB command line, using Real-Time Workshop. In addition, Embedded MATLAB Function blocks in Simulink support algorithms in multiple M-files.
New capabilities for the Simulink product family include: 
Simulation accelerators in Simulink provide compiled simulations and dual-core or dual-processor operation
Normal mode model reference for component-based modeling in Simulink 
Bidirectional tracing and new target-specific code optimization architecture in Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder and embedded target products 
Code generation for Simscape and SimHydraulics
HDL code generation from Embedded MATLAB Function blocks and support for multirate designs in Simulink HDL Coder 
Continuous time support in Stateflow, with zero crossing detection and differential equation authoring 
Support for parallel computing in SystemTest using Distributed Computing Toolbox
Simulink Design Verifier, a new product for test generation and property proving
New capabilities for the MATLAB product family include: 
Support for numerical arrays >2x109 elements on 64-bit operating systems for many MATLAB functions
Ability to read MPEG, WMV, and other video formats on Windows platforms in MATLAB 
Video viewer and ROI tools for polygon, ellipse, and freehand selections in Image Processing Toolbox 
Interleaving of parallel and serial code with the parfor function in Distributed Computing Toolbox
Interactive graphics for the Web, using AJAX to enable rotate, zoom, and pan in
