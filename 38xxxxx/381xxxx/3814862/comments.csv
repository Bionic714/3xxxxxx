,doctorgordinho,2007-09-24T18:13Z,"This kind of upload is nearly useless as the majority of downloaders are unlikely to have existing license accounts with the licensor. So if you aren't already a matlab licensee, forget this torrent, as it looks as if Medica8ed isn't going to share (or doesn't have) a license."
,lateralus0412,2007-09-29T09:18Z,Eww wast of time....

Thx."
,dartnorris,2007-12-14T10:49Z,"for those of you saying about how this doesn't work, one notice, you can not expect matlab to work with    all AMD cpus, especially older ones...   "
,allrightythan,2008-01-18T18:57Z,"For those of you that have been having trouble, ignore everyone elses comments and simply follow these steps... I have had no problems

1. Open up Winzip Extractor to view files
2. Select the ""setup.exe"" file (There are two, sort files by ""Type"" and select the setup.exe file labeled as ""Install Application"")
3. Once all the files have extracted to a temp folder, the installer window will pop up.
4. Make sure ""Install"" is selected then press ""Next""
5. Insert any Name and Organization you want in the two upper fields, but make sure to copy and paste this code, 18-41519-34649-39940-00621-01988-02577-01245-51575-44112-12966-44686-37374-43430-36283-64095-18584-34803-54175-05965-54469-56859-47170-56703-00300-00857-63903-48349-07297-57752-37962-48933-62342-43508-41646-31266-38461-54713-50260-57403-18654-13756-59612-18880 into the Personal License Password (PLP) field then hit ""Next""
6. Make sure ""Install the product versions from my DVD or local disk only"" is selected then press ""Next""
7. Agree to the Terms, and install ""Typical""
8. After the files have installed (Takes 15min or so depending on comp speed) click ""Next"", and then ""Finish"" and then ENJOY! :D"
