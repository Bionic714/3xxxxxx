High powered Wall Street investment banker, Jack Campbell is at the top of his profession, and he has the luxurious lifestyle to prove it. Life is just about perfect; that is until one snowy Christmas Eve night when Jack unwittingly stumbles into the middle of a grocery store hold-up and in a bold display of self preservation disarms the gunman. The next morning is Christmas but instead of calmly waking up in his beautiful penthouse apartment, Jack wakes up because a couple of kids are bouncing on his bed. He is in suburban New Jersey, lying next to his college sweetheart Kate Reynolds, who he left 13 years ago in order to pursue his high-finance career. A confused and horrified Jack runs out of the bedroom and speeds back to Manhattan. A disconcerting visit to his apartment and office building confirm the worst - his former life no longer exists...
