Fresh Download is a robust and very fast download manager software that turbo charges downloading any files, such as your favorite software, mp3 files, video files, picture collections, etc.

Unlike any other similar utilities (e.g. Gozilla, Download Accelerator, Getright), this software is 100% free, no charges, no banners/ads in the software, no spyware.

Also includes split, resume, schedule and browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape, Opera, and Mozilla) integration features, clipboard monitoring, drag and drop url, download basket, internal zip extractor, integration with antivirus programs and proxy.

New in this version: support for Crazy Browser (using Method 2 of IE integration) and reported minor bugs fixed. Close the old version before installing it.



-LEGAL TORRENTS

Purpose:

create a balance, share the already free stuff,
public domain works, freeware, free music,
free ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.

show the copyright owners that torrent
websites shouldn't bear the responsibility
of what their users upload, torrent websites
are very much similar to google..

users upload what they want to upload,
download what they want to download,
and search for what they want to search..

by creating this balance and sharing the already free
stuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..
