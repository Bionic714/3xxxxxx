,johndmes,2007-09-20T02:23Z,"Waitaminute - A game that shipped on 4 CDs, now at barely a gig?  With  extras?

Something very wrong here."
,Ordeal,2007-09-20T12:38Z,that's my thought..  :O
,GTC,2007-09-20T14:23Z,"It works, downloaded this release before. Its genuine."
,Biosaur,2007-09-22T21:37Z,"Hmm... Seems fishy, because of what Johndmes said. But seems reasonable at the same time. I'll give it a shot."
,skull9490,2007-09-22T21:37Z,seed please........... 
,jrwr,2007-09-24T05:46Z,"thats because CD 2 only had 300megs on it
CD1 was 600megs"
,Amyfers,2007-09-26T17:45Z,"It downloads quickly and works OK, but mods (such as NPC reconstruction) arn't compatible with it.


But if its just the game you're after than its perfect :)"
,DarkSaber2k,2007-09-27T14:13Z,"It is FInal Fantasy 7, it's a legit version. The 'goodies' (such as they are) are a folder full of RAR files: Animated gifs, Icons, Images, 2 sets of MIDIs, a collection of official patches and unofficial fixes (which are already installed) and a spoilers file that has a game editor in it, if thats your thing. Only problem is that it gives a BSOD error every 20 minutes or so, and searching forums shows this to be a common problem with this version."
,CakeSnake,2007-09-29T23:42Z,"I have this installed but when I start it up I get a black screen with the Square jingle playing, then nothing.

Any ideas?

Thanks for the file, shadow!"
,Hellhawkgg,2007-10-07T08:19Z,Please seed....its not even downloading.
,Crozzfire,2007-10-19T00:32Z,"thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!
This is the best game off all time."
,kordis,2007-10-27T20:29Z,"Please help!!!
When I start the game my screen turns black.
What shall I do?!"
,kordis,2007-10-27T20:37Z,"HEY!!!
Must I have Nividia Riva?????"
,toester1,2007-10-28T01:10Z,"i d/l and installed fine got half way through an then tried to play today an i just get a black screen and nothin else any suggestions or advice......

thankyou in advance"
,toester1,2007-10-28T12:09Z,"problems with black screen??? after a few hours of looking i found another torrent with comments to resolve this, the black screen is due to your pc not bein able to play any or all movies in this game so you need to d/l this...
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/ACE_Mega_CoDecS_Pack.htm

And click the ""TrueMotion2 video decoder 2.0.6.2b."" when they give you a checklist (DONT JUST SKIMTHROUGH THE INSTALLATION!!) Its in Fliters. The List is arranged alphabetically, so FILTERS shouldn't be too hard to find. or you can just make sure you select the proffessional version this will install nearly all the codecs

the only problem i had doing this is it prompted me to uninstal my k-lite an divx codecs thus resulting in my movies not playin to well, i use vlc player and some work some dont and windows classic player again some work some dont im not too sure of a way around this as im not very computer literate,but hey at least you can play ff7, my advice is play ff7 then uninstall ace mega codecs an re install the codecs you may of been prompted to remove,

hope this helps it sems to be a common problem for people playin this game,i was half way through when it decided to give me the black screen treatment

thank you for the upload"

,KaptainKrunk,2007-11-02T03:32Z,"Works great, but crashed when I got to the hideout. Any solutions?"
,dandan986,2007-11-04T10:41Z,"Yeah the crash is bit annoying, but not stopping me from playing. :D

But if anyone knows of a fix, it would be greatly appreciated."

,crimsonFay,2007-12-03T12:56Z,"Very good pc edition. works totally gr8 on vista or xp (i have installed it in both os). if you've got any problems with controls, make sure you read the extra readme files that come once you install the game. it doesn't matter if you are using a laptop or desktop. just use the keypad, until you get the chance to configure controls from inside the game's menu. thnks for the upload shadow420csf.."
,shoprat,2007-12-10T01:05Z,"The Game shipped on 4 disks because we didn't have the encoding software and dual-read lasers we have now, note the black disks they were shipped in. this is the genuine article, and alot of good extras. a definite must-have. Thanks Shadow!"

mitt FFVII har för många repor för att klara sig förbi första cdn... spelat lite för många ggr i guess... 
första ggn va vel 8 år sen ...seriöst e d så gammalt ?:D

vaaarför gjorde de ""advent pissungar"" och ""dirge of cereberus"".... ja e så beeesviken..

dirge börja bra.. spelmässigt e d rätt kul i shooter/kingdom hears mix.. men storyn e ju fullkomligt galen..med en PROFESSOR HOJO back from the dead... överlevde VII:an genom att kopiera sig själv ut i internet? X_x.....vem e d som skriver så fullkomligt idiotiska storys...
vart tog magin vägen?(_ _) 

hur kan man äns ha mage att inte göra en fortsatt ""ordentlig"" story på ett av tidernas största speel ...hoppas crisis core ...är i rätt anda iallafall..

o varför står det att 8paletted inte funkar i conf efter denna installation? ..
denna täcker vel allt? (;_;)

jag e inteee bitter...

 men jag e endå djupt tacksam för killen som la upp det här : D... 

hade gärna velat ha i 640x340.. men då går allt super långsamt... + att när första videon slutar rulla så e massa gula sträck överallt.. lär bero på att datorns utgångs datum dog nu på 3:e året..kansee..kansee intee

,Xephyr_Adonis,2008-01-10T19:49Z,"Okay, so I can use enter to access the New Game/Continue menu, but the game will go no further. I don't think that I'm doing anything wrong, but maybe. I am running on an IBM laptop without a  numberpad (I only have my regular keypad) and so maybe that's it? Any help?

Thanks for the upload, Shadow. Great extras!"
,Crimson-Storm,2008-01-17T05:41Z,"Hey guys? I been eagerly awaiting this download, ever since finding these fancy mods to make it look better than ever I've really wanted to play it again. 
Anyway onto my problem, near the end of installation it crashes when it cant read a file (it varies each time I try) is this a bad file or am i just doing something wrong? 
I'd really like to see this game in all it's glory, i felt the psx version shamed such a brilliant game with such poor graphics. Any help is appreciated, thank you. "
,slickshoes34,2008-01-24T07:15Z,yes to crimson-storm it does the same thing for me it gets to the end of installing and doesnt want to go anywhere after that. i have vista. i dunno what the problem could be.?? any help?

,dummyacct7,2008-03-21T10:02Z,"It wasn't detected before, but AVG seems to find a virus in the exe file now. The file is from the nocd crack used on the exe (figures =/), you can test this by using a copy of the 1.02 executable and applying the nocd crack, AVG goes berserk xD. Most of the torrent is good, but the crack and cracked exe seem to not be, so make sure you have AVG on hand ^_^ I think there's a no cd crack w/o any viruses, my computer doesn't seem to have any problem with it at least and ff7 is running with no disc. You can get a copy of it and the 1.02 patch at http://www.sendspace.com/file/ol9wqt while it's up there, or you can just search for the 1.02 patch and the crack named FinalFantasyVIIUniversalCrackLCG.zip on google ^_^"
,disabuse,2008-03-25T00:30Z,"I just want to add that if you downloaded this and got the virus, you will need to reboot your computer and scan again. The virus will bury itself in your system restore files. So you have to scan, reboot and scan again to get rid of it completely."

,nymersic,2008-05-14T00:16Z,"Brilliant, works perfectly.  toester1 was right - if you get the black screen, you need one of the codecs in the ACE codec pack (apparently, the k-lite codec pack doesn't have it).
As far as the worm goes, not that I've seen - scan seems clean - though I haven't used any of the patches.
Thanks shadow420guy."
