,carmichael,2007-11-03T20:14Z,"ATTENTION EVERYONE THIS IS FAKE
THIS IS A SPLICED VERSION OF THE COACHELLA 2006 LIVE RECORDING. CHECK FOR YOUR SELVES THERE IS A SAMPLE ON DAFT PUNKS OFFICIAL MYSPACE OF ONE OF THE TRACKS ITS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE IN THIS TORRENT. PLAY THE COACHELLA AND THIS SIDE BY SIDE EXACT SAME THING. "
