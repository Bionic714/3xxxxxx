,latentlunacyie,2007-09-24T10:06Z,"spazzfrag, check this to learn the basics of using bittorrent.  http://lifehacker.com/software/ultranewb/a-beginners-guide-to-bittorrent-285489.php"
,shai_hulude,2007-09-24T19:36Z,"Seems like there is too much bass.  Otherwise, great torrent."
,Rianski,2007-09-24T22:06Z,"Missing tracks 11, 13, and 15."
,Monstruoso,2007-09-25T19:41Z,"Brutal! \m/
Would someone kindly put the first episode of the second season up?"
,MPOmnis,2007-09-26T08:53Z,These are just low-quality rips from the show. Terrible.
,MPOmnis,2007-09-26T09:00Z,"Whoops! Sorry, this is the real thing. I accidentally opened my old .rar of show rips instead of opening the correct .rar file."
,Jon55,2007-09-26T14:31Z,"is it really missing tracks 11, 13, and 15?"
,Tenari224,2007-09-26T22:39Z,THANK YOU!!!!!Ive waited so fuckin long for them to make a Dethklok album!! When I heard they were making this I knew I HAD to have it!!! BTW spazzfrag WinRAR archiver is the program you use to open this dont worry its free! You can probabley get it off this site actually!
,Tsuribachi,2007-09-26T22:41Z,"is this even the actuall release? i mean, it was released the 25th and your torrent is dated the 20th"
,K1DUK,2007-09-27T00:54Z,Does this have the bonus 7 tracks?
,Irishcult,2007-09-27T01:42Z,BAD ASS!
,rainingblood0187,2007-09-27T22:40Z,"hey whoever was asking about how to run torrents, the new version of limewire supports torrents now, so if you have limewire, just  have it running, click ""download this torrent"", and hit open (make sure it opens with limewire). so u dont need a seperate torrent program anymore. "
,itchino1,2007-09-28T15:31Z,23 tracks in total this includes the bonus disc no missing tracks someone tells lies they should go forth and die.
,tanker21,2007-09-28T19:42Z,Fan man tackar här väntat på det här albumet bra länge :D

TPB FOREVER!"
,asphyzein,2007-10-14T20:38Z,"This is fuckin' great. I have been waiting for this since they announced the first pilot episode of the series. 
Hilarious, and sadly far better than alot of the metal out there... Savage! I am even looking forward to buying it, hahahah.

 - FYI Spazzfrag - Don't use Limewire for torrents... you'd be better off with something like Azureus or a more simplistic application like bittorrent  that won't attack your computer, heh. "
,asphyzein,2007-10-14T20:41Z,"Oh yeah it all appears to be here... so if you're reading through the comments to see if it's the real deal, it is.... stop dicking around and DL IT NOW! "
,WJakobW,2008-02-25T17:38Z,"Wonderful lyrics!!
Completely insane :D"
,Ch0wd3r,2009-07-11T03:30Z,power fuck!
,TechWizard86,2009-07-31T04:02Z,uTorrent is the best. No adware or spyware and it's free. DethKlok is the best.
