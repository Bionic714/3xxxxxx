I loved John Simm in 'Life On Mars', and he rocks in this movie, too. 
Blue/Orange is a 90-minute TV movie based on the subject of psychiatric treatment. I know that sounds dull, but this movie is satirical, funny, shocking and just plain well done. There's a healthy dollop of South Park in it, like a slug of whiskey in your coffee. It moves very fast, and the dialogue just crackles. It is anything but pretentious. :)

Blue/Orange was adapted from an award-winning play written by Joe Penhall. 
The film stars Brian Cox, John Simm and Shaun Parkes. It aired in the UK on February 23, 2005.
