,dj-tazzy-t,2007-09-22T21:27Z,One of the best zombie movies ever! Good soundtrack too.
,nlvmark,2008-02-04T19:22Z,het zijn geen zombies het blijven mensen maar ze zijn wel besmet en moordlustig:) maar idd zonder twijfel een van de beste films op deze aardbol
,fellwarden,2008-02-23T14:52Z,"28 days/weeks later is not tecnically a zombie movie :p

The ""zombies"" are not living dead as zombies are, but they are infected with a virus causing them to go insane or something, apparently giving them superhuman strength and endurance."

Great zombie movie :D and soundtrack "
,garadark,2008-12-02T15:27Z,"i thought 28 Days Later was a little better, but for the second time around it was still the best zombie movie series ever.
...are they making another one?"
,Krokodilliscious,2009-04-18T02:19Z,"Well the best part about these movies IS the soundtrack :-)

**to fellwarden** -well, there is  nobody in these movies getting any kind of superpowers or even enhanced... Only barking raging fury.
