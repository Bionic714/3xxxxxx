,xMule,2008-10-22T07:37Z,"The file is NOT fake.  It works just fine and the quality is excellent.

The world has been blessed to have known such a man.  I'll definitely be picking this album up when I have the cash.  It's nice to be able to check out an album before laying down my hard earned scratch.

Thank you."
