,Snapperhead1,2009-07-16T04:57Z,"Truth be told, this version is OLD.  They just released version 6.5.  While NOTHING is unhackable, any version newer that 6 is MUCH harder to crack.  But aside from some punk ass mofo just trying to hack to prove that he can, why would someone want to hack deep freeze.  The program protects a user from himself mainly.  It also protects a user from malicious code and viruses.  I use version 6.3 and I dont use AV software at all.  Great product."
