,crazysafe05,2007-10-22T12:35Z,Is this really season 4? It's only airing here in Canada this fall. Strange that it's the same size as the Season 3 complete?!? Back to seeding for me.
,Preternatural,2007-11-01T17:46Z,It airs in the states on HBO before it come to Canada on showcase.  That's why I just downloaded it last year instead of watching it on tv (that and I have no time for scheduled tv watching).
,KwizatsHaderach,2008-02-27T04:00Z,Much thanks. 
,Rockstello,2008-06-11T18:46Z,Please seed!!!
,big_daddy_rich,2008-06-26T11:05Z,"it airs in the states on FX, and the reason the size is the same is because there are only 13 episodes each season."

,Twister112,2008-10-31T11:34Z,Well guys if you think a little youÂ´r self then you already knew it was a fake before you downloaded it.. ofcause D04 isnt out yet so stop blame the barstad who uploaded it.. well yeah its lame by Smerri to upload fake but... You guys have to think a bit and ask you r self if its realy posible that its out now.. and no its not so yeah it MUST be a fake.. no need to dl the files to con that

,MovieDude-1,2009-04-01T19:30Z,This is viewable but really painful to watch. something went wrong when they burned the files.  It skips and drops out constantly!
