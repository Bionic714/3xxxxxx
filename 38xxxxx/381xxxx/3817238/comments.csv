,madmax999,2008-03-24T07:02Z,"There are two audio streams embedded.  You need a player like Media Player Classic (it is on downloads.com).  But any player that recognizes the audio streams will work.  Right click on the screen, choose Audio and select which stream you want.  Simple.

LOL - I don't think that the Germans, Italians and others spoke English, but they do in the war movies.  Oh, and Romeo and Juliet were Italian so they would not be speaking English either."
,LowCastle,2008-03-24T13:16Z,Ah!  Makes perfect sense now.  Thx.  And many thanks for uploading this classic.
,madmax999,2008-03-24T22:44Z,"Glad you like it.  This is one of my all time favorites.  I watch it 2-3 times a year.  It is a reminder that arrogance can get in the way of clear thinking.  Fits lots of different situations, not just war.  But mostly I watch it just because it is a great action movie.

Don't worry about the confusion on the audio streams.  You are abut the 8th person to ask for clarification. lol"
,tonymousta,2008-12-15T23:32Z,Thank's a lot for this one as well. Great taste and did you ever happen to see the Saka Zulu tv series ? A great one with marvelous opening scene with the war cry
