Also, the industry is neither ""star-studded"" nor specially ""fabulous"". I'm not saying it's a bad business - not at all - but that it might not be what you think it is.

Misleading titles and blatant pitching of a book with clearly bullshit claims like this is just... lame.

Mind you, I don't know the contents of this torrent, so I'm not saying you shouldn't download this."
