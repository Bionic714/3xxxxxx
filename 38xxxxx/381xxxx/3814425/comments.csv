,tinkertoytech,2008-05-08T13:38Z,"This is a positively wunnerful torent except it's VBR!  SOme players and DJ mixers don't like VBR and for me to use these on 2 of 4 systems I am force to resample it.  I applaud all of the Top XXX of ??? Genre YYY for timeperoid ZZZ but vbr forces me to resample everything.  Please, go gown to 192 CBR but not# vbr PLEASE CONTNUE TO SEND UP THESE WUNDERFUL TORRENTS, BUT CBR THEM at 192 if you want to save a little space to get the quality, 320 would be best for they can be resampled to 128k (level of itunes) if you're trying to jam things into ear bud listneing, but for mixing the higher the bitrate the better my equipment likes it"
