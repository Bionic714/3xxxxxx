,zd26,2008-12-08T20:15Z,"don't mean to be a dink, but how do you get the files to play?"
,quezicotl,2009-04-14T10:13Z,"This is for people who need to know how to play  the file:

To just watch it on ur pc, u will need a Dvd decoder pack, just google.

To burn it, u will need a software like Nero, or Dvdrip.
Both Have the function of allowing to rip a disc to your hard drive, so... you also have the ability to burn a dvd from your hard drive."
