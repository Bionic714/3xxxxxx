This is Aretha at age 26. Not very young but still early in her career. 
She is very much the Reverend's daughter and her style is as much gospel 
as soul.

It is 1968. Black and white. Poor lighting, two cameras and possibly not 
even stereo. The backup singers seems to have had no professional choreography. 
Their moves are homely and awkward, but their singing is so much the better. 
The band is as good as it gets.

Overall it is not the ultimate in quality, but rare as a diamond, and just 
as lovely. Aretha and her group are particularly inspired on "I Never Loved a Man". 

I believe this is the earliest surviving live performance of Aretha Franklin 
done with any professionalism. The original recording was done by Swedish Television, 
and I recorded it on VHS tape from a TV rerun around the millennium. I had it on 
VHS tape for some six years before digitizing it.
