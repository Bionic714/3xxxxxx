Stuck On You is a Farrelly's Brothers comedy about a pair Siamese twins who have their own everything but are joined at the hip because they share a liver. They use their unique gift in a means to gain acceptance and live as normally as possible within everyday life. Everything is going great until Walt (Greg Kinnear) follows his dreams of making it as a Hollywood actor, and persuades his hesitant brother Bob (Matt Damon) to go along for the ride. Hollywood may never be the same as Bob and Walt find fame, love and a new outlook on their unusual but inseparable bond.
