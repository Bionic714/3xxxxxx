These songs are sung during an Native American Church tipi meeting. 
A N.A.C meeting begins at dusk inside of a tipi, a Roadman presides over the night's activities. Other assinged tasks include a fireman who maintains and looks after the fire in the centre of the tipi, a doorman, a cedarman and a drummer. The meeting lasts until dawn. 
During that time a water drum makes its way around the circle of peyote eaters, a person can choose to sing when the drum comes to them. The drummer sits down next to the singer as the drumming begins a rattle joins in from the singer and the songs are sung. 

This is a collection of those peyote songs, some are of better quality than others. 

Enjoy. 

Over 1.5 hours of songs.
