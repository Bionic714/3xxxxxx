It takes just a couple of minutes to rip and seed 
that collection you have gathering dust somewhere.



    ******* DJ OUR PARTIES ********

Do you have a mix already on your hard drive?
Why not share your hard work and spread the spirit!
I know that you can do better than those tired old 
"Thriller and Monster Mash" comps. at Wal*Mart.



    ****** CLASSICAL MUSIC FANS ********

Somber strings and eerie organs. Funeral-appropriate?  Halloween gold!  

Give us something to "liven up" our basement crypts!

Terrified trick-or-treaters of today may become classical patrons tomorrow!
A great way to spread the love of classical music!
