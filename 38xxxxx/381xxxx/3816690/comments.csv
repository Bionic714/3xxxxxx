,artytorrent,2007-10-18T16:53Z,There are actually samples from a lot more drum machines than those listed above. This is a very comprehensive selection of drum hits from a variety of machines. There is almost too much to choose from. I'm in the process of batch processing them into normalised 44K mono WAVs and will eventually upload GM/Battery/Kontakt-compatible kits containing 16 hits per instrument. Thanks for sharing!

,drax12,2008-06-20T17:54Z,"Hi all.  Thanks to every one that has uploaded or seeded the many sample torrents.
In my quest to find the perfect dance kick I sifted through so many one-shots that I was recently institutionalized.
The closest I came was ""Devinekick2"" from Native Instruments' Synthetic Drums and I just found a very similar sample in the July issue of ""Computer Music"" ( Kick287 ).  It doesn't sound like a real drum or a manipulated sine wave to me.  If any one knows how to design something similar please tell us.  Meanwhile I'll just wait in my padded cell sucking on my toes.
P.S This is the best I can do-  Record a sine wave w/pitch LFO. Load into sampler, and isolate a small section. "
