   Click on Custom if you want to select different options
   Click on Configuration Complete and then Install


2. Start Autodesk Mechanical 2008 and Select Activate the Product 
   when ask for activation,  select Enter an Activation Code
   Use as serial : 667-12354321 or 677-98989898 or 677-68686868
   Write down the request code.

3. Fire up the xforce keygen and generate an activation code
   based on your request code. Continue the registration process
   Copy and paste your generated activation code ..
   Restart Autocad

4. Enjoy!

The only way I could get this to work is to follow the above to where one is asked to Enter an Activation Code.  The serial numbers do not yet work at this point.  I had to run the keygen without a serial number.  It assumed a serial number or 000-00000000.  Do not enter that number anywhere!  I recorded the 17 sets of 4 characters each thus generated, then hand typed them in the appropriate spaces.  Lastly, I entered one of the supplied serial numbers and VOILA!! It worked!"
