,leexx,2007-10-29T18:16Z,varför kan jag inte spela på singel player? någon annan som har samma problem ?
,aq1sw2de3,2007-11-03T03:44Z,"when i click to play single player, it says that i have the wrong cd inserted..even though i hav mounted cd1 in daemon tools. Any ideas how to fix this problem?"
,stupid m0nkey,2007-11-03T05:51Z,"ok with cd mounted go to my computer, right click the emulated cd 1, click on explore on the submenu, go to the crack folder, keep this window open while you open another my computer window, in the new window go to the place you installed the game (default location   
C:/program files/lucas arts/  some folder i forgot the name to) then go to the folder named game (i think) then take a copy of the file from the first window NOT A SHORTCUT OF IT and use it to replace the file in the new window


the key is to remember the crack has the same name as the one you have to replace"
