,Desparatus,2007-10-05T04:20Z, the seed is in super seeder mode to force seeds so if you plan on leeching and not seeding dont bother downloading any of my torrents
,loyaldotface,2008-03-19T03:27Z,Could someone please Seed this... I am stuck at 44.3%...Thanks
,Camilla5,2008-03-21T14:24Z,please seed someone=)
,Azarukii,2008-03-30T12:30Z,Seeding would be nice...
,Antormaa,2008-04-09T05:21Z,"Yea. Seeding would be nice about now, im at 48,2% on season 4. And im going to seed when im done. But still need to get down the hole thing. Also have the same problems with season 5,7 and 8. Have downloaded season 1,2,3 and 6. And seeding them when i have the line to do so. Hope that some one that have the complete season's will get to seeding the rest soon."
,Antormaa,2008-04-14T02:28Z,"Desparatus why do you not ansver, on any of the comments that you get on you upload? I know that you have typed: Desparatus p책 2007-10-05 04:20 CET: 

the seed is in super seeder mode to force seeds so if you plan on leeching and not seeding dont bother downloading any of my torrents.

But if no other ppl can download the hole thing why post it at all? 1 thing is that no one can help you seed it to others, and you will use alot of time on nothing.

So if you wan't ppl to download from you then let ppl download the hole thing, so they can make there own mind if they want to only download but not seed. For me i need to seed untill it do say that i have 2.0 cheer rate. That i have uploaded the thing 2 hole times. Afther that i seed from time to time if i don't need move the file to another harddrive.

So please seed season 4,5,6,7 and 8 so other's also can seed for you and with you.

Regards

,dark_lighter1,2008-04-16T08:37Z,Im also stuck at 48.2%. Seed pls! I will seed as soon as it's done!
,Braindrained,2008-04-27T14:44Z,"Please seed, many are stuck at 48%"
,dark_lighter1,2008-05-08T22:48Z,HEY! THIS IS M SECOND TIME TO COMMENT! NO ONE IS STILL SEEDING!
,mekru,2008-05-20T06:02Z,"Please seed. Im stuck on 48,4%....pleeeaaase"
,Kelps,2008-05-29T01:34Z,"I think the original person should seed to someone from sweden and/or norway. They have like 100mbit connections. I am just making a suggestion. I see some seeders from Norway and Sweden that have some sweet upload speeds, and they can help keep this alive. This is currently stuck at 48%

Same for the other Seasons. Do not entice us with seasons of Charmed that you uploaded but will not continue to seed!"
,thessro,2008-07-11T17:26Z,stuuuuuuuuck @ 48.4.. :(

,markkyboi,2008-11-28T14:59Z,"Very Good, People Try Not Download The Whole Album At Once Do Once At A Time Why Your Watching The First One Download The Second One You Get it Done Quicker :)"
,markkyboi,2008-11-28T15:01Z,"P,S And It Depends What You Download It On I Use UTorrents :)"
,Desparatus,2009-08-31T20:41Z,I was a way for the last few years.  I left my room mate in charge of uploading all my torrents. it seems he stopped them all. I no longer have the torrent file on any of these down loads. so if there seeders that are out there don't have the full file don't down load any of these.  I will wait a week then start deleting the torrents. 
,mandukar,2010-10-01T10:46Z,I will seed for a week but then Will have to delete the torrent as I have a limited storage on my computer.
,mandukar,2010-10-02T19:22Z,"I don't know what the problem with your guys are, maybe configer your torrent with an upload of 10-15 kb while downloading and then set it to 0 afterwords, and ya download each ep seperatly it'll also incress your ratio doing this.. 28-58 seeds is enough stop spamming the comments asking for such. Be patient."
