Farscape is a science fiction television series, featuring a present-day astronaut who accidentally travels through a wormhole to a distant part of the universe. It was produced by the Jim Henson Company and Hallmark Entertainment, and filmed in Australia. Drawing on Henson's traditional expertise in puppetry, two of the main characters are animatronic puppets.

The show was abruptly canceled after it had completed production of its fourth season, with a fifth season contracted, effectively ending the series on a cliffhanger. A mini-series in 2004 wrapped up some of the show's hanging plot threads and new webisodes are being produced.
