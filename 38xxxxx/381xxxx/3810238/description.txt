Prince 
Sign O The Times - The Movie

(1987)



Info:
 
This is a x264 rip of the UK PAL DVD (which was itself sourced from the NTSC Canadian Alliance Atlantis DVD)

"It just so happens Alliance Atlantis is also affiliated with the movie's original distributors, Odeon Films. This probably explains why the picture and sound appears to have come from a good high-quality source."



- encoded with megui  (PAL to NTSC video conversion = avisynth script included "assumefps(23.976,true)")
- video: x264 (720x384 - 16:9 Widescreen - NTSC 23,976 fps - 1009 kbs ABR)

For x264, .mkv playback and all your video playback needs, install the Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP). It's all you need: Non-intrusive, small, efficient, pristine uninstall, it's simply the best around.
