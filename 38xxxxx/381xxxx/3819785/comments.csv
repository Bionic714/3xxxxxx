,tiggerpaws,2007-10-03T09:47Z,"I have this torrent on a Unix workstation (well, really a mac which runs unix underneath) so it dont crash on me so I will leave it running"
,crook16 ,2007-10-03T17:17Z,perfect too bad other people dont upload other seasons not even stupid nickelodeon shows it anymore...
,tiggerpaws,2007-10-05T01:37Z,I know. Nickelodeon is not as fun to watch anymore. I remember the pinwheel days so trust me I have seen Nickelodeon in its prime. If I find some of my old VHS tapes I can capture them tu hi  quality files on my mac and I will share them out here. If Nick dont offer them 4 sale. I will offer them 4 free
,rbt200,2007-10-06T01:13Z,"Please, please, please can someone seed this as I've been looking for Rugrats season 1 for 2 years! "
,rbt200,2007-10-06T01:15Z,It keeps saying 'no connection can be made because the target machine actively refused it'. What do I do?
,rbt200,2007-10-06T02:38Z,How do I change the RAR file into AVI files?
,crook16 ,2007-10-06T04:59Z,uhm you just drag the video from part 1 to the desktop or whatever and keep part 1 and 2 together (of the same video) and thats it make sure you seed it too...oh and big props to tiggerpaws for this one!
,tiggerpaws,2007-10-09T18:37Z,"Thanks. Now I know what its like to be a true seeder. When you do it because you truly love what you are sharing and not Only a ratio. Although in some cases, ratio is good for seeding."
,007juk,2008-02-28T23:36Z,"Hi there, I'm struggling to get the AVI files to play. Am I correct in saying that every second file does not cotain anything. When I go to open part 2 with winzip nothing is there. Any help would be most appreciated, thanks."
,tiggerpaws,2008-03-13T09:00Z,"Hi 007juk 
You should only click on the part 1
of each file.

It should then spit out only one avi
file per 2 rar files"
,kojitehman,2008-04-23T15:52Z,"I can't use these files, whenever I launch one it gives me a codec error in windows media player. :'( Help please, I waited a long time to download these ;)"

,crook16 ,2008-07-27T05:36Z,"nope turns out you cant leave megaupload urls

,skinbonez,2008-10-02T02:32Z,"i have an intel mac. i tried downloading the perian software but still i can only see the video and not hear anything. i can only here the first second of every video file at the beginning into to the show.. please help me, i've been looking for this season forever. also my mac uses stuffit expander to turn the rar files into avi files."
,etkirk4Trex,2009-01-09T01:33Z,will seed for months to come... 
,Meadows_zeta,2009-03-28T19:25Z,The first episode is broken and doesn't play.
,Tauntonlad,2009-04-08T22:02Z,This isnt a dvd rip its a tv rip but cheers anyway
,AilesGrises,2009-07-09T23:52Z,"I'm not sure if it's in season 1, but I'm looking for a particular episode. It's where they all play pretend that they go to work and angelica's the boss, and they all decide the the grown up world isn't very fun. I've looked through episode lists but I couldn't find it."
,horus84,2009-08-30T18:40Z,"hello thanx for this but have you ""all grown up"" please ? :'("
,godeatgod69,2009-09-20T20:34Z,The first half of every episode is its file. WHen you click on the second parts folder. It says its empty.
,godeatgod69,2009-09-20T21:20Z,Ive never had this much trouble out of a download in my life. First off every time i click on an extracted file it gives windows an error. Then everything has to load back up. On top of that every second part folder is empty. thankx for the waste of time.
,3ss0neR,2009-10-13T17:36Z,"To run on mac try using mplayer osx ... it'll open anything.  As for the seeds ... not everyone' holding up their end of the bargain, I've been at 0-10kbs for 3 days now ... c'mon fellas!!!"
,wdvilpk,2009-12-01T15:31Z,Downloaded first episode. Appears to have missing index part. See http://www.xvidmovies.com/faq/#4.1 for fix. You need program called DivFix to repair http://download.divxmovies.com/DivFix110.zip End of this episode is cut short. I'll download second episode and see what its like.
,AWSOM-O,2010-04-20T22:44Z,downloads very fast!
,AWSOM-O,2010-04-20T23:14Z,doesn't work
,barda24,2010-05-09T14:40Z,anyone got the entire show?
,MistahSpahkle,2010-10-03T02:15Z,The first episode is broken but the rest seem to be working fine.
,xhizors,2011-01-19T22:03Z,"Absolute waste of fucking time. What fucking asshole uses so many RAR files, not to mention so many poorly named RAR files. Fuck this and fuck you tiggerpaws. Never in my life have I ever had such a bitch of a fucking time and Episode 1 doesn't even work."
,nickguyatt,2011-05-20T12:37Z,"It's ok I guess, watchable anyway, barely. The first episode gave me some trouble, you have to open it in VLC and have it repair the file each and every time you want to watch it. The rest open in WMP well enough even if the quality is rather poor."
