,scottoyster,2008-09-07T20:13Z,PS. when i can figure out how to seed properly I will seed. If any ones knows a tutorial for dummies pls think of retards in need (me) Dropa comment with a link. Cos It took me forever to get this film and others and i think I help others. If I can help myself?!
,TyraelBloodwing,2008-09-18T14:59Z,Its easy to seed ... just leave the torrent active after you downloaded it.
,quadrai,2009-06-23T20:54Z,"I wouldn't recommend getting this one! It is a single huge spoiler :) of the full-length ""Ghost in the shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG"" (i.e. 2nd season).

I'd recommend getting full 26-episode 2nd GIG. For English audio, see http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4186641/Ghost_In_The_Shell_SAC_2nd_GIG_01-26_(ENG-DUB-By-Oj)"
,quadrai,2009-08-16T18:29Z,"Since my previous comment, I'm stuck at 99.7% (only 2 pieces missing!), same as ~4 other peers.

Could someone please seed? I promise to stay seeding until at least one more peer will have 100%.

(To clarify: my previous comment stays relevant, I'm just gathering a complete GITS collection.)"
