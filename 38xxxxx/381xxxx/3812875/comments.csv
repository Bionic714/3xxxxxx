They think that rar'ing the thing will make it smaller, or somehow more convenient to seed.

,ceddieboy,2007-12-14T03:42Z,"Yea, I agree. Music with high caliber dynamics like this should be offered as a Lossless download.  I only seed CD quality FLAC file myself.  

I use 7-zip compression that is similar to the RAR (but better) only to make sure the files don't suffer damage from being download so many times from so many sources!
