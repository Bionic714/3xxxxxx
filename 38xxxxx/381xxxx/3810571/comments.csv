,Str8Pryd,2008-02-24T04:03Z,"I don't want to steal anyone's thunder here, but if you're interested in the uncompressed audio from this performance, I'll be seeding it for a while at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4044247 so you can make MP3's in whatever bitrate or other format you wish.  Just a matter of personal preference..."
,fbsnow,2009-09-09T08:47Z,"If someone has a problem unpacking, I recommend program called 7zip - it's completely free, easy to google for it, easy to install and use, and it opens all kinds of different archive formats.
This release is MP3 VBR -V2 by LAME 3.97 - which simply means it's great quality.
Thanks for uploading and sharing!"
