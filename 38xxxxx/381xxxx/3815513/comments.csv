,furioso1,2007-09-22T18:45Z,someone can tell me what this is? It's a bit silly to download something just to see what it is...
,crazydodo,2007-09-23T21:41Z,FROM THE POSTER: this is the hollander interchange cdrom used in many repair shops to identify parts that are interchangeable between different makes/models/ and years of cars and trucks
,bead1099,2008-02-07T20:32Z,"could someone please seed, which edition is this?"
,bead1099,2008-02-08T00:59Z,"thanks for seeding, don't leave us, this torrent is as rare as chicken teeth"
,sidd2v,2008-04-09T17:36Z,Someone please reseed this thanks
,Leeboy2020,2008-05-14T16:41Z,"I have been loooking for this for a long time...(Thanks) .I cant seem to do a interchange for a part. I keep getting ""Invalid part description""  or ""cant execute query"" Can someone get me over the hump please? "
,bead1099,2008-05-15T13:03Z,"After you open the program, are you starting by clicking on ""Lookup""?

Then choosing from the list generated? 

Whatever you do, you don't type anything in those open fields, just click and choose. 

Holler back.

,NanashiKnight,2008-05-28T06:27Z,"I hope someone reads this soon.

I'm in a real predicament here. I sort of got myself into a nasty situation with my employer, and really -need- to get him a more recent version of this program (As this version only does parts up to 2003) and I've spent all day searching everywhere, but this seems to be the ONLY version out there.

Does anyone have a newer version I could download? I'm really desperate, and running short on time."

,chevyracer5613,2010-10-12T18:08Z,Program works well.....however upon restarting my AV said that prog had rootkit in it.....so I immediately removed it per my research of what rootkit can do....
