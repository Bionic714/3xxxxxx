,Antormaa,2008-04-14T02:33Z,"Desparatus why do you not ansver, on any of the comments that you get on your upload? I know that you have typed: Desparatus pĂĽ 2007-10-05 04:20 CET: 

the seed is in super seeder mode to force seeds so if you plan on leeching and not seeding dont bother downloading any of my torrents.

But if no other ppl can download the hole thing why post it at all? 1 thing is that no one can help you seed it to others, and you will use alot of time for nothing.

So if you wan't ppl to download from you then let ppl download the hole thing, so they can make there own mind if they want to only download but not seed. For me i need to seed untill i have uploaded the thing 2 hole times. Afther that i seed from time to time if i don't need to move the file to another harddrive that is.

So please seed season 4,5,6,7 and 8 so other's also can seed for you and with you.

Regards

,Trtie45ie,2009-02-06T20:10Z,hell something tell me not to try and downloaded this.
,Desparatus,2009-08-31T20:45Z,I was a way for the last few years. I left my room mate in charge of uploading all my torrents. it seems he stopped them all. I no longer have the torrent file on any of these down loads. so if there seeders that are out there don't have the full file don't down load any of these. I will wait a week then start deleting the torrents.
