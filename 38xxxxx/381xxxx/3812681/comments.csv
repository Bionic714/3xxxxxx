,zaxu,2007-09-26T20:34Z,"Ok, first of all. I dont really cheat. Sometimes I do however download cheats to just test them and see how they works. And I do so on non VAC secured servers which I believe are there allmost just for cheaters. I dont worry about cheaters in-game since they so to say allways get banned by VAC. This cheat however, I must say, seems quite much like a account stealer. Things start to seem a little fishy when it asks for account name and password so that it can stream to the Team Fortress 2 folder. So if you like me are only going to  test it a few times on non VAC servers I would not recommend downloading this as it might send your account information to someone who might use it for evil. ;)"

,zaxu,2007-09-26T20:37Z,"Why the hell would it need your steam password to stream to a fucking folder anyway? Okay it could possibly have just your uname for finding the right directory in the SteamApps folder. But password? Neh, me not think so."
