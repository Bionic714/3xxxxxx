So what is it about?
Well it will extract the AutoIt3-script(*.au3) from any AutoIt3-Installations(*.exe)
--> http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/
To see if some file is a AutoIt3-Installations watch the file properties version information.

Yeah i know there is also a decompiler included in AutoIT3. But this has some minor improvements.

So What has improved? 

To make things easier there is no need to enter the pass phrase anymore to make exetoau3 to decompile the script - it is auto filled for you during decompiling in the pass phrase textbox
The pass phrase is stored inside the script anyway so why enter it again? 
Just of the case you forgot to check the 'allow decompilation checkbox' or the pass phrase.

You get not only the source but with it comes also more functionallity like debofuscation, support for >modified Script Exe's< and incase something don't work DIY-fixing, all you need is M$Word+some basic programming skills to debug/Code in Visual Basic.

And it has support for AutoIT v3.2.6 files that the normal exeaut3 don't support because it uses tokens.
