Halloween H20 "Producers Cut" VHS Copy with timestamp at the bottom.

Years ago I bid on a collection of copies of tapes from the Halloween movie series. Of those tapes was one called "Halloween H20 "Producers Cut". Recently I had gotten back into the Halloween movie craze by the release of Rob Zombie's Halloween. This got me remembering about the tapes I had. I searched the internet to see if this version of the movie was available anywhere. I couldn't find a torrent for it or even a P2P. So I decided to capture it to my computer and make a torrent of it myself for those who would want a copy.

The video quality is that of a copy of a copy from a VHS. I'm not going to lie and say it's great, it's not. The audio isn't too bad.

I don't know the differences between this and the actual DVD that has been out over the years. I think this may just be a few differently shot scenes and different music. Not too sure. Again it was labeled Producers Cut when I got it.

Main upload from a 12KB/s upstream connection that isn't on 24/7 so prepare to wait while downloading this if you do.
