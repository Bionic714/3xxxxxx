,HaengarN,2007-12-16T23:16Z,"Mount with latest alcohol 120%

Install
(if it says file missing, go into the cd and manuelly press setup in the mdf file)

Paste the crack+fix into your settlers folder, /base/bin. 

Mount mds file in latest alcohol 120%.
(if you comp freezes, change the location of your mdf+mds file first to a normal or USB/extern drive and it will work) (the freez error means it is located on a RAID-DRIVE, just google if you dont get it)

Play the game from the settlers6.exe in your instalation folder, /base/bin (

becuse if you dont the autoupdate will start and then you will have to enter serial, using this will not be autopupdater!)

cheers ;)"
,tizlenis,2007-12-31T09:18Z,"Ok, the thing is that i didn't download Settlers6 from this site. Everything works perfect except the runtime error. I am sorry if you(HaengarN) already told how to fix this problem, but my lack of knowledge in this didn't let me understand what you said."
