,johnzhill,2008-03-06T12:15Z,"Hi

I am having a problem burning to DVD and converting the game to an iso with poweriso. Everytime it gets to 35% on either function it fails to go any further. It has come up with the error that it cannot read the image file.

I have registered the poweriso software using a keygen.

Tried Magiciso and that doesn't support the .daa format."
,poescuntnaaie,2008-04-05T21:45Z,"I feel the need to releave yawl from your little

,Huhnthis,2008-04-28T17:39Z,"Can someone please give some detailed information about the cracking and installing.
(especialy the cracking)"
,Huhnthis,2008-05-01T13:24Z,"Just tell me where to place or instal the crack, because i can't run it because it says something about:""missing bwink32"" or something like that. I just need to now where i have to place the crack, and if i have to to it before or after instalation.
Please help me guyz."
,S3MM7,2008-05-11T00:40Z,"Huhnthis.
Normally you have to copy the crack and paste it in the directory where you have installed the game (after installation). 
go to the main map (overlord) and copy the crack there.

goodluck ;)"
,S3MM7,2008-05-11T00:42Z,"and for those who are saying that someone is a noob or dumbass or anything, you had to learn it too, you didn't knew what file belongs in this map etc..
so STFU! and help each other ;)

grtz!

,thewaste,2008-05-15T00:09Z,"I just downloaded and installed it and it works fine.

Here are step by step instructions for anyone who needs them.

1.) Open the DAA File with PowerISO (You can download it for free)

2.) Click 'Mount' to mount it to a virtual CD and then the installation tutorial will start.

3.) When it finishes, go back to PowerISO and extract the .exe file in the CRACK folder.

4.) Place the crack in the folder where Overlord is installed to, overwrite the old one and you are good to go.

Have fun."
,SpackyBack,2008-05-22T05:07Z,"Thanks works just fine!  My first game download and no probs on first try! Also thanks to thewaste for the step by step instructions, great help!"
,zander18,2008-05-30T14:41Z,"hey, downloaded this yesterday, work ok-ish ( some random crashes) but its the performance thats bothering me. My specs

-Windows XP pro 32 bit and Vista 64 home basic. ( duel boot running the game in XP atm, but same prob in vista)
-AMD duel core 5600+ (o.c to 6.2 ghz)
-4gb of ddr2 1066mhz OCZ sli ready ram
-150 gig Western Digital Raptor ( 160 gig secondary)
-Asus m2n32 sli delux mobo
-8800 gtx
- 600w coolmaster igreen power.

Ok ive seen a few threads with people having the same problems. In the start up screen in the dungeon im getting around 7 fps ( almost unplayable, and all settings maxed, makes no diff whether i lower them or not) but then when im in the tower i get a solid 30 as the game is capped at that. but then when i go into the meadows, pow back down to around 7, i run the Counter Strike Source fps test with 215 fps, and my setup should eat this game alive, does anyone have any suggestions as to what could be causing this horrible performance?"

Btw are these stats enough to play Overlord?

,arpisor,2008-10-29T20:41Z,"hi guys, i just want to ask if there is anybody else who is having the same situation like me, which i won't call it necessarily a problem but whenever i am playing the game the image seems to be moving quite slow and the sound moves ahead of the video. i know that the pc performance counts the most, but i am having a packard bell dualcore 2.13 ghz processor, 2GB ram and 512MB video card which is ATI Radeon 1600 Series. I have also installed the latest directx and the video drivers they're the last ones available to download. what should i do? it is not a big problem but whever i am in a bigger fight with more enemies i can't keep a steady target because i am on the move at all times! any suggestions anyone?"
,mguk,2008-11-29T14:55Z,"I couldnt get it to work either upon unzipping it tells me files are corrupt even though power iso works with other files. 

Following the instructions given in the other comments hasnt helped either so its either a power iso problem or the actual torrent

,hahddw,2008-12-30T13:53Z,can anyone tell me how to crack it please
,LordVossler,2009-01-13T23:12Z,"Hi.
The game installed without to much problems, and I managed to work myself around the Daa file,but when I wanted to start playing, the game got stuck on the first loading screen.

Does anyone know how I can fix this?"
,Gamer_92,2009-01-20T15:58Z,When i put in on DM its acting like a emty file or disc please help plzz
,p1emonster,2009-04-07T12:03Z,"Good, Working torrent
Downloaded for me about about 200kb/s without forwarded ports.

You get an uninformative text file and an DAA file. 
DAA is not compatible with Deamontools

Working fix:

-Google Magic Iso and download the official version, dont worry about paying just use the trial. This will save you downloading the full version illegally and cracking it :S

-Open the DAA file with Magiciso. The largest window contains all the files needed. Highlight them all > right click > click ""extract to"". select somewhere to extract to, i chose the same place as the DAA file

-Once it has finished open containing folder and all the files you need are there. just run the launcher.exe which will install the game for you

-Find the folder you have installed to and replace the Overlord.exe icon with the replacement found in the ""CRACK"" folder

uninstall magiciso if you want because you dont need it anymore. 
You dont need to mount anything either.
