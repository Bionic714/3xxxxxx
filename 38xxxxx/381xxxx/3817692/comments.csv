[T],HackShackJack,2008-07-12T13:12Z,SO is there a crack or a patch or a CD key or what? I tried the patch PlanetMaster made for v8 but it just crashed when I tried to get intoi converting to MP3 I tried the crash preventer and reinstalled and everything and finally had to uninstall. SO I am looking at this but it doesn't seem like it's been opened up just yet?
