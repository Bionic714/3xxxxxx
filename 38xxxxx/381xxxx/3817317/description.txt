I want my 90 minutes back, 29 January 2004


Author: (murple@murple.net) from Washington, DC 

While I find the ethical message of this movie to be somewhat offensive, endorsing theocratic fascism, I can get past that and still enjoy a good work of fiction. What I can\'t get past though is the horrible, stiff, forced, wooden cue-card \"acting\" and the unbelievable plot holes. The only reason I would tell anyone to watch this stinker is to see just how bad acting can be. I suspect even most Christians (which I am not) would find this movie repulsively bad.
