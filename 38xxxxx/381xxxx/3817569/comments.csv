This application has failed to start because dslobby.dll was not found.  Re-installing the application may fix this problem.

,laharal90,2008-02-10T08:07Z,if i remember right that's a file to do with directx just get version 9.0c and install it that should clear it up
,laharal90,2008-02-10T08:09Z,or just search the internet or some of your CDs for dslobby.dll and if on there place it where it needs to go good luck with that

hahah, really i bought this twice now and keep loosing my copies from moving around so much (university student). love this game series. everyone should check out the BSG Homeworld Mod , its very very impressive.

I personally download games/demos and try em, if there really good, then i buy em, and make an ISO back up usually, along with recording the CD key. i'v deleted the iso, but still got the key; so i guess thats handy."
,Dexxty,2008-04-12T19:49Z,Hay im kinda new with all this stuf and i cant get Homeworld 2 to work it keeps on saying  gslobby.dll was not found. and i tryed the directX 9.0c thing and it dosent work.... someone help plz!

,Valamar_943,2008-05-03T17:12Z,"alwayssafe
you have to add the exe  to the list of allowed applications. control panel-system-advanced system settings(requires admin acount)- settings(the one for performance)-click the data execution prevention tab, and add it to the list."
,alwayssafe,2008-05-06T06:50Z,Thanks for the tip.  I tried doing it that way but Vista still said it knew better - wouldn't let me add homeworld2 to the list of exceptions.  So I found out how to turn off all DEP from a command prompt.  You can find the exact info pretty easily through a google search.

,RexHavoc,2010-03-21T13:45Z,"My First Comment!!! Been Pirating it up here on TPB for a LONG time just never registered but this game is worth it. Came across HW2 when a friend was done with it (doom3, halflife, and a few others as well, a very nice day) Have to say was a huge fan of RTS before, this took it to whole new dimensions, 3 to be exact. Allowing you to move on all three axes, being able to hide below, above, or even cloak and letting the enemy slide right past you. Add on the multitude of mods made for HW2 and you're talking close to LIMITLESS hours of exciting and challenging fast-paced action. 



(""Warlords"" the Starwars mod is pretty epic)
P.S. This IS a FAST and CHALLENGING game, SAVE OFTEN, as in this game situations can change in seconds and things can go wrong even faster. All in all a great game everyone will enjoy, happy hunting!"

I have had the same problems with it under Win7 64bit. How I solved it is that there is an option at the video settings, a checkbox for Vsync enabling or disabling. I found it disabled and I enabled it. After that the mouse sort of felt a little bit draggy but it fixed the issues with the right-click actions (rotating, zooming, issuing move orders, etc).

And also for the rest of the readers here, regarding the various Win7 64 bit compatibility issues, there are mentioned many ways and tweaks to make it work. I don't know about all of them, but what worked for me is that I had to get the german exe for the 1.1 version (this is also mentioned here among the early posts), and I also had to make this exe to run in compatibility mode for WinXP, sp3 or sp2.

I hope this will help someone."
