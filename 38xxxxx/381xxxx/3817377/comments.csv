,Madhur,2007-10-22T15:26Z,"I have installed the VP7-codec by using the link, but  I still don't get any picture. I'm using the latest VLC-media player. I can play the file, but I only get sound. Any help would be appreciated..."
,oobaka,2007-10-28T00:38Z,"madhur
You'll need to use Windows media player.
It's the first avi I've seen that VLC player won't play"
,oobaka,2007-10-28T00:39Z,"No offence to Keggerman but these rips are useless...to me anyway
I can't play them on my stand alone and I can't even convert them in VSO ConvertXtoDVD
What's the point in making quality rips when you can only watch them on your computer?"
,KEGGERMAN,2007-11-04T21:41Z,"OOBAKA: I did a lot of testing before settling on the VP7 codec, it had the best results for its small size. I actually thought I had tested it with VLC because I thought it did work with that player however I just tested it again and found that indeed it does not work with the current version. I use Media Player Classic and it works perfect with that player (very similar to VLC)"
,Dagor_88,2007-11-06T04:24Z,"So even VLC won't play these? That sucks ass...dam KEGGERMAN why couldn't you use a more common codec? 
Oh well, thanks anyway...I appreciate it nonetheless. "

"" I use Media Player Classic and it works perfect with that player (very similar to VLC) ""

Not true , these will not play with Media Player Classic"
,heinzbitte,2007-11-18T15:53Z,"You can get this to work in either Windows Media Player or Media Player Classic.

Go to http://www.on2.com/index.php?496 and click the green download link(Download VP7 Personal Edition!).  

Then just install it, and open with mpc or wmp."
,Sicktus,2007-12-28T16:24Z,"Sound seems out of sync, even after I installed the Vp7 codec... I use BS player by the way... "

,piraton,2008-01-25T08:51Z,cool stuff keggerman dude thank you
,Geprodis,2008-02-13T20:48Z,"Keggerman, I appreciate your uploads...I watch them on my computer using windows media player and have no trouble. I wish there were more seeders."
,btw123,2008-02-16T14:27Z,Could have used more common codecs...thanks just the same but not worth the download
,carsten.666,2008-04-28T00:44Z,Download k-lite mega codec pack. Includes media player classic. Plays everything. Even RM files.
,kemenyadi,2008-04-30T01:16Z,"excellent work keggerman! very good quality, thank you.. dont listen to those ppl. It works PERFECTLY with Media Player Classic and ConvertXtoDVD. I tested myself. VP7 rocks!!"
,Xenity,2008-06-07T23:08Z,"Linux users can convert one of these 'VP7' files to a VLC-playable AVI file with this one-liner:
mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o /dev/null && mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:bitrate=950 -o destinationvideo.avi

Change 'somesourcevideo.avi' and 'destinationvideo.avi' to the input and output files respectively.  Requires 'mencoder' to be installed.  For batch processing, see the script on this page:

,gurkhat,2008-06-28T13:42Z,"works fine with BS player and K-Lite codec pack, thanx."
,ushkp6,2008-07-17T19:31Z,"I downloaded the K-Lite Codec Pack, and it works with WMP and Media Player Classic.  But for some reason, the video keeps pausing and starting while the audio is smooth.  This makes the video/audio out of synch.  Should I use BS Player or something else? (Doesn't work with VLC)."
,redbeardv2.0,2008-09-11T20:21Z,Keggerman you are amazing! Thank you so much for putting these torrents up here.
,_043,2008-09-21T12:24Z,"Wow, this torrent rules! At first, I used the ""Simpsons_Seasons_1-18_[Darkside_RG]"" torrent, but the quality there is really shitty beginning from season 4. Then I found this one, and I've got to say that it has awesome video/sound and plays perfectly with MPC. Thanks Keggerman!"
,Pujan7,2009-01-23T21:08Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent !
I have already downloaded and watched 7 complete Seasons ripped by Keggerman, and currently I am downloading the 8th Season.
All you have to do is to download VP7 Personal Edition (Free) Codec here: 
http://www.on2.com/index.php?615
And enjoy the good Video and Audio quality.
Many thanks to Keggerman
I am looking forward for next seasons."
,PsychopathicMetal08,2009-05-29T03:11Z,"Episode 17 - WHY THE FUCK IS THE VIDEO UPSIDE DOWN?

I installed the codec, audio works nicely but the picture is upside down on this episode, not sure if this is a re-occuring issue since thats the first episode from this season to complete.....

any solution or anything?"
,PsychopathicMetal08,2009-06-03T06:13Z,"Problem solved, just downloaded ACE Mega Codecs Pack and all the episodes play fine..... thanks, not quite sure what was causing the issue. Maybe it was my OS, probably just a codec screw up or something but if you experience an upside picture then simply download ACE Mega Codecs pack, if this doesn't fix your problem then I dunno what you can do but I imagine the codec pack will put you right.

That codec pack has about 100 or so codecs to play basically any video you can throw at your media player.... without any problems."
,bigdaddy82,2009-06-22T23:56Z,hey anyone that is havin trouble with not gettin any video to come up on the screen i had the same problem till i found the k lite mega pack it plays all codec types no i can watch the episodes while i listen to it
,satish100,2009-06-25T18:16Z,Thank you for the wonderful rip.Works fine after installing vp7 codec.

,AWSOM-O,2010-04-07T22:56Z,"this torrent doesn't work!!!!!!
don't download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,e5frog,2010-04-17T14:45Z,"It works just fine, strange resolution though: 576x384, gives and aspect ratio of 1.5 (3:2) instead of 1.333... (4:3), solved by playing full screen ofcourse. Try Media Player Classic, if it doesn't work - download the right codec. Too bad you have to make your own divx/xvid conversion to be able to run it in your enabled DVD-player/mediaplayer - VP7 isn't a very handy codec, only for computers."
,jebemmajkuti,2010-05-21T19:13Z,"any way to play on dvd?
