              Black and his C.I.T. henchmen, Dolph, Kearney and Jimbo Jones. Worse
              yet, instead of sports and arts-and-crafts, the kids are expected to
              pass their days sewing counterfeit wallets. The only thing that gets
              Bart through this ordeal is the hope that Krusty himself will visit,
