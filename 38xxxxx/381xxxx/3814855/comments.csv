,the_noc_list,2007-09-22T05:47Z,why is it in Finnish?  Are you saying we don't hear the original (arabic) audio?  And why is no one seeding...?
,signal left,2007-09-22T07:29Z,"Just another part of the Global Matrix Scam. Pay no attention to this. The real threat to the world is the governments of United States, Saudia Arabia, Russia and China."
[T],Knaster,2007-09-22T08:19Z,"The real threats are the conglomerats, capitalists and the commies of the world. 

All hail the new order of nationalsocialism, save your countries from the fall of civilization."

,mikesmith,2007-09-23T10:06Z,Fuck bin laden... All he can do is hiding in someone`s asshole...He is a real fucking camper...He should play some CS!!!
,PeakOil,2007-09-23T10:50Z,"Funny how he managed staying so young hiding in caes and having kidney problems requiring dialysis......what you're saying ....Fake? ....They wouldn't would they.....ah yeah thats right, they sent thousands of young men to die in Iraq (not counting the private mercenaries of black water as private contractors aren't part of the oficial stats) whilst ensuring a million of them gets killed just to ensure control of oil.
I guess I also forgot that the Bin Ladens are old business partners of the Bush family."
,PeakOil,2007-09-23T10:52Z,"Sorry, it should have said caves, not caves. 

Can you pirate guys please install proper forum?  
There are so many funny nuts here thinking that 911 was the result of 19 fanatics with box cutters who hate our freedom that it is almost ammusing hearing them spew out their hate."
,hookeyed,2007-10-07T21:26Z,"Thanks for the upload, can I get a seed please"
,hookeyed,2007-10-09T00:57Z,Thanks for the seed! Why does the video stop (audio continues) when he talks about current events? Happens through most of the speech actually...strange. 
,CNYBC,2007-10-14T04:56Z,There is no way that this was filmed anytime recent. That is unless Osama uses Just For Men and gets regular Botox injections. He looks much heavier too than is most recent photos.
,CNYBC,2007-10-14T04:58Z,That is why there are interruptions when talking about current events. This video is probably from the late 90's and one of the little Goebells spliced in the current stuff. He is either dead or way too afraid(cautious) to show his face.
,cooolway,2007-10-27T22:48Z,please seed this if you have downloaded it.
,Hede88,2008-04-24T04:26Z,"Exactly.. The persons who benefit from the war are some of those behind 9/11.

We have ties leading to the international bankers (money lenders), the owners and the CEO's of war industry corporations like Halliburten; DICK CHENEY. There is also ties to people connected to Israel like Paul Wolfowitz, and speaking of him, other members of the PNAC (Project for a New American Century), Council on Foriegn Relations, Trilateral Commision, Bilderberg Group and of course the Federal Reserve System profiteers and defenders and owners of the MASS MEDIA.

Ill tell you what needs to be done.
You guys need to join the revolution that's already taking place and demand a new investigation into the 9/11 attacks. 

If possible then you should make a new political party with the sole purpose of getting to the bottom of these questions and holding people responsible. Before you look around you would be getting a third of all the votes ! If all the votes are counted that is.

Here is greetings from Denmark.
Ron Paul 2008
911 Truth NOW!

Jeppe"
,dynamoehummm,2008-07-07T23:47Z,"Funny thing about all the 'wake up' people and the 'truth' etc.  I've asked for over six months for anyone who has actually worked Ron Paul's economic numbers?  Don't sigh, he's made just a couple of claims about gov't revenue, gov't expenditures, and the comparisons of today, vs. his planned cutbacks and what yesteryears gov't spending equals his.  I don't want a debate, I want someone to tell me my math was wrong.  God help us if I'm the economic last line of defense.

sorry this is off topic, but it angers me and saddens me that it seems in despising the few dishonest tyrants, those politicians in opposition by default must be troothful.

It sets with me to a point of pulling out my teeth to see those that sincerely want good change, ie RP'ers, should be the very people to have done the most first hand research.  I want to believe too; but feelgoodery rhetoric don't feed the bulldog."
