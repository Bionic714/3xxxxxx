,TrshDept,2007-09-19T14:34Z,I made a slight mistake when creating this torrent. I have stopped seeding and have now made a new one that will be up in a couple of minutes. I am sorry for the inconvenience. Please check for new torrent shortly.

Please advise, I'd really like to play this."

,DarkRiegeSen,2007-12-06T04:08Z,"I am pretty sure this is the one I downloaded... if it is, then thank you. This game rocks. Ever since I played Half-Life 2 I always wanted to see what the first were like. They kick ass! I had no problems with this. I ran it and it was awsome. I have beat Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing Force so far. Thank you, alot."
,TrshDept,2007-12-08T14:02Z,"I'm the original uploader. Since Demonoid went down, I have been upping my best torrents here. This is a fantastic release of all three of the first episodes of half life. They come as .exe files and are very easy to install. No virus, etc. You also have the option to install in Spanish if you want. They also come with a High Definition pack which updates the textures of the original game. You must have THIS Half Life installed to play the other two episodes!! I don't think these work with Vista, but let me know if they do. Enjoy and remember I am a former Demonoid  so all my uploads are totally legit. Thanks and thank you PB for being here. I miss Demonoid, but we all need PB now more than ever.

,steveo3242391,2007-12-29T19:45Z,"These games works fine, I played and beaten both.  Install HL first then whatever you want to play.  There are just 2 problems I want to point out.  And they are both in opposing force.  You can't really jump well, so right after you hit he jump button hit the crouch button and you should make it there. and the other one is whe you are going in an elevator, up or down you an get frozen and you will have to re-load your last save; I tried to fix it and all you have to do is jump repetively.  GREAT UP!"
,Worfsonofmogue,2008-01-07T18:55Z,"Downloaded and unpacked brilliantly, but...
I am using an AMD 5600 dual core with nvidia graphics, 3gb ram and  this game is too fast.
It moves too quick even in walk mode it seems like it is on fast forward, is there apatch or something, please help, as I am an idiot and am desparate to play these games.
Half life 2 and ep2 worked perfectly.

,mr.serv-on,2008-02-02T13:59Z,"Games played good, no random crashes. One big problem with Half-life is that you get stuck a lot on on elevators(have to get off before it stops or jump alot) and certain spots. Now this isn't a big deal but it's incredibly annoying and happens way too often. Besides that its flawless, I highly recommend it."
,InspectorLupus,2008-02-04T16:56Z,"In the beginning of Half-Life, right when i touch the H.E.V. suit to acquire it, the game crashes and gives me a fatal error:

If you just removed the torrent but still have the files from the torrent, you just get the torrent again from this site. If all goes well, it should recognize that you already have the files and tell you that the torrent is complete and seed it for you. Did that a few times as well."

,mcdermott87,2008-07-12T10:35Z,"Is this with the new menu style (like cs1.6), or with the old?"
,RPDL,2008-07-16T21:10Z,"I'm glad I can say I've played this game.

However, I must admit I would rather have been playing a newer game.  It wasn't always enjoyable.  Here are the negative aspects of these games (its just my opinion):

Boring puzzles.  Almost all of them involve activating two machines so you can activate this one larger machine that'll open up a path to keep going.  When it came to puzzles you didn't always know your objective or what you were doing, you just activated everything and then a path would open up so you could keep going.

Annoying enemies.  Soldiers were made of metal.  You could stand in front of them and fire 10 machine-gun bullets into their head.  I got desperate and often reloaded the game after combat segments in the vain hopes I could win the fight again but by losing less health.

While some enemies were tough, many othes (Vortigaunts, bullsquids, sound dogs, headcrabs, pit drones, zombies) were too weak, and if ever I fought them I would pull out my little pistol and kill them in 4-5 shots, and I'd keep all my other weapons for more powerful creatures.  The game lacked medium-strength aliens.  They were all weak or strong, meaning it was boring to manage my ammo and tactics.

My biggest beef is the fact that monsters teleport out of thin air.  At first this is cool, chaotic and spooky, but it becomes very very tedious when a quarter of the game's enemies just pop out of nowhere when you've walked halfway across a room.  This just shows that the developers had a hard time integrating the aliens into their environments so they made them appear only when you're there, and for a few seconds.  It felt like the devs made a game that was against the player and not with him: headcrabs were placed exactly where you wouldn't see them coming, and vortigaunts appeared behind you before you had time to react.  I felt I was being treated unfairly, and everytime an enemy got me by surprise I just reloaded the game, which is no fun at all.

A lot of people liked the game's mood, but I found that after a while I just got really less absorbed after seeing a whole bunch of scripted events of scientists dying again and again.  It felt like they were always pushing the same ambience down my throat.

Needless to say there were a lot of big ""donts"" that you wouldn't find in today's games and that make the game less fun."
,Syndacate,2008-07-18T01:03Z,"I just played through regular half life and it works 99% - lil glitchy - but nothing to even think twice about.

,Amoebas,2008-09-25T14:06Z,"Just writing to say, installed without any problems but there's something strange about Blue Shift.

I don't know what it is exactly, I'm no computer whiz. But the symptoms were apparent from when I started playing the game. First of all and most obvious was the slight distortion around the edges of walls, characters and shapes. Best described as big, blocky pixels. 

Secondly there is the comodo firewall alerts. I don't know what triggers them (sometimes it's nothing important) but the reason I can't tell in these circumstances is because as soon as I get the alert the screen goes double and the graphics all become very distorted - everything is unreadable. Even after closing the game the computer remains in this state so I have to press the power button.

I know its not my graphics card because the original Half-Life game (and other games I own) plays without any such problems.

Just pointing this out to anyone who might be interested in investigating the issue."

,jarik464,2010-01-06T20:35Z,"to solve the ""unable to load authentication library"" (or something) problem, go to >options>video> then set renderer to open GL."
,nebek,2010-05-10T15:27Z,"As others: I already has a error: ""Fatal Error -- Unable to load authentication library, exiting ...""

AND THIS IS MY SOLUTION TO GET IT WORK:
step 1. Start hl.exe (because this is MAIN console for ALL OTHER packs)
step 2. In main screen go to: ""Options""
step 3. Go to TAB: ""AUDIO"" and for quality select: ""LOW""
step 4. Then, go to tab: ""VIDEO"" and select these options:
4.1. for ""RENDERER"" either select ""D3D"" or ""SOFTWARE""
4.2. for ""DISPLAY MODE"" select: ""NORMAL""
4.3. for ""RESOLUTION"" select: ""640x480""
4.4. for ""COLOR QUALITY"" select: ""MEDIUM (16bit)""
step 5. go to tab: ""VOICE"" and UNCHECK option: ""Enable voice in this game""(because I don't have microphone and the game persistently is checking it!).

I have 2 PCs with W7 x86 (32bit) and after very LOOOOOONG dealing with this issue finally I resolved it."
