,doc1696,2007-09-30T06:14Z,"When I burn this, a disk shows up in the top right corner and a red bar flashes on the top and bottom of the screen.  I tried this on both a DVD and CDR.  Any clues?  P.S. and yes..my PS2 is mod'd"
,CrazySk8erKidd505,2007-10-01T03:50Z,Thats What its Suppose to do cause that means its loading 
,doc1696,2007-10-03T06:45Z,I guess it takes longer then 30 mins to l oad then huh?  I stopped it at 30 mins.. please advise if I should wait longer :P
,trb454casull,2007-10-03T23:25Z,I get the same disk and flashing red bars I don't why. any help please
,CrazySk8erKidd505,2007-10-04T01:49Z,try burning it on cd then
,castface,2007-10-27T20:08Z,"Is there any reason why you should burn it on a DVD?  Is there any difference (personally, I can't see there being a difference).  Plz, let me know either way.  thx."
,castface,2007-10-27T22:12Z,"I'm getting the same thing - it won't go past the loading screen (with the disc and the flashing red bars).  Do u need a dongle for this to work?  For those who don't know, a dongle is a special memory card for gameshark that only holds gameshark codes.  If u do need a dongle is there any patches available for it?  Also, why do u say to burn it on a dvd - it'll fit on a regular cd?  If anyone knows why the loading screen stays and won't load past it, let me know."
,Skyline-r34,2007-12-11T12:11Z,"well my 1 worked 2 times then yeah, then the 3 time it got thoes red bar. why?"

,NightWanderer,2007-12-18T20:59Z,"I've tried this on its own and by loading swapmagic first, either way it keeps telling me it's an invalid ps2 disk. I'm not a noob to torrents, media backup, or ps2 hardware. Any suggestions? does anyone with this torrent actually have a working disk?"

,Pepperor,2007-12-30T19:16Z,This doesnt work. All you'll see is an image of the back side of a disk on the corner of your screen.
,stassano,2008-01-13T13:08Z,"sad fully same story here... I insert disk in my chip modded PS2... it shows the disk on the right top corner and suddenly a flashing red frame around my screen and thats all it does...

Ive burned lots of games so I know you need a dvd per game (shark) and close the multi session, write no faster than 2x etc etc... it is the program itself...

Any suggestions?"
,offthewall2112,2008-01-17T18:44Z,"Gameshark copies may not work in you're console if you're mod chip doesn't support gameshark, actionreplay2, etc.. I know my modchip does, so I will be downloading this, and when it's finish I will verify that it is working."
,ManiKatti,2008-01-20T02:26Z,Cheat engines do not work on Modchips idiots... Your better off just using the Action replay compatibility off a SwapMagic 3.8 coder if its modded.
,Pepperor,2008-01-23T07:27Z,my ps2 is v16(i think) not modded nor do i use swap magic and i have been playing backup games that i made myself and downloaded for a while now. im interested if the is a patch that can make this work?
,Davidbeats23,2008-01-26T07:07Z,i burned it it works at start but gives me black screen an red on side and dvd picture on the upper right of it!Answer me whats  wrong?
,Davidbeats23,2008-01-30T05:26Z,"my ps2 is modified not modded and its says at start ""Playstation 2 infinity v.1.38"" does it support this gameshark 2 that i download? Is there any way i could make it support it? whats Action replay compatibility off a SwapMagic 3.8?FUCK YOU MANIKATTI!"
,fjfairchild,2008-02-19T23:04Z,modded is the same as modified you dunce if its changed other than how it came out of the sony factory then its modded
,domas19,2008-02-22T21:06Z,After my download completed I burned iso files onto a cd-r disk. When I put it into my playstation it gave me a disc read error. The second time it said please insert a playstation or playstation 2 format disc. I am wondering if I burned it correctly or not. If I did burn it correctly how do I fix this error. I used ISO Recorder to burn the files. My playstation is not a slim one if that makes a difference or not. It is not modded either. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
,badtupeu,2008-03-02T19:51Z,MAKE SURE TO BURN IT ON DVD....????try burning it on cd then...!!  tell me haw is correctly....CD or DVD .
,mfmac91,2008-03-10T04:06Z,hey i bought an older one a while back and alot of you have had questions about the spinning disk on the top right corner. it's normal it means that its loading.
,BillIsGay,2008-04-20T10:35Z,"Hello!!!

I donwloaded this file and burnt it on a DVD and well I have to let u guys know that this DISK IMAGE doesn't work on my PS2. 

All I saw after loading this IMAGE is a BLACK screen with a CD icon on the UPPER RIGHT corner of the screen. It sits there doing nothing for a couple of hours and yes I did reloaded it and reset it for a couple of times.

I think this disk image is a lost cause."
,empty_xyz,2008-05-19T02:48Z,"This is a waste of time.I think what the uploader did was, simply dragged and dropt all the contents of the gameshark dvd to his computer, and made that into an ISO. Although that method does work for the gameshark 2 V3, it obviously did not work for this version."
,CrazySk8erKidd505,2008-07-12T00:26Z,I used it on Swap Magic And It Worked 
,v1ncentmay,2008-08-17T13:36Z,i just logged in how do i download
,datagjord,2008-09-07T16:04Z,"WTF!""
i downloaded it an burned it and the screen is all black and it sounds like my ps2 i like throwing up... (and yes, ive been burned like 30 games before )"
,whiteboi,2008-09-11T08:37Z,"yeah it doesnt work, 
tested with swap magic 3.6 both with cd and dvd,
the dvd does what it does for everyone else (the cd in the top right and a red box around the screen)
and it wont even read the cd one,
if someone can get it to work with swap magic please reply, and tell us how you got it to work"
,Some_body,2008-09-19T18:39Z,"seeda sn채lla

,VampJoseph,2010-01-22T07:35Z,"For those of you that are wondering why this torrent won't work in your PS2, make sure that your console has been ""chipped."" Meaning that you have had a mod chip installed that will allow you to play backups. If you're not sure, try to start a backup disc in your system. If it works, your system has been modded, If not, there are many places that can tell you how to mod your system and even sell you the chips to solder in yourself. Or even mod your console for you."
,Dramachine,2010-03-26T05:05Z,..dude thanks for the application! i downloaded the game and burn it to a dvd r using alcohol 120%! and it works! but the thing is when i used it to my game(ffX) the cheat is not working! can someone teach me how to use this gameshark properly! thanks in advance and more power to you guys
,yukuku,2010-06-28T16:46Z,downloaded game sharks dont work sorry
,xliftopdavex,2010-09-28T18:58Z,can i do use this with hd loader
,kukuhri,2011-08-07T10:08Z,"Does not load properly in pcsx2. Screen only displays an image of a CD in the top right corner, against a black background."
,kukuhri,2011-08-07T10:09Z,"Crash report:
CDVD READ ERROR, sector = 0x0003c69c"

[wx] can't open file 'cheats\ba8f5d93.pnach' (error 2: the system cannot find the file specified.)"
,kukuhri,2011-08-07T10:21Z,"lol sorry for all the comments, just realized something else. The disc title is being recognized as ""Crazy Taxi (NTSC-U)""
Definitely a bad upload. Don't get it."
,Twiggy123,2011-09-22T17:13Z,kukuhri: STFU. Its a legit copy and i prefer this one rather than praxis copy. This one works in PCSX2 and without errors. Its Titled Crazy Taxi yes but if you bought a copy off the shelfs in wallmart they say the same thing :)! Soooo. Yeah! Download and seed because its deffinetly reals!
