,Trelligan,2007-10-01T21:38Z,"Thank you so much. Now I can toss the stacks I've been holding on to so I could read them again 'someday'. (I'll check for missing first, natch!)"
,marlw77,2007-10-09T22:32Z,"Thanks for this posting, I am a huge fan of HM.
As I am new I'm a bit fuzzy on this ""seed"" thing, I need some help. Thanks"
,lildevil4,2007-10-19T02:30Z,"To seed, don't remove the torrent from your torrent client program after you have finished downloading."
,semijack,2007-10-28T19:02Z,Many of these files are password protected according to my reader -- can you reveal the password?  Not so useful without.
,lildevil4,2007-11-08T02:45Z,"I would suggest you use the included reader.


Not a single issue is password protected.


If you are in any way unsure of this, change the extension to .rar for .cbr and to .zip for .cbz and open up in winrar"
