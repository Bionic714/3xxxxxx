,reapsy,2007-09-22T22:00Z,"Sorry my last comment didn't make sense.  I'll try again.  I used the generator to make a key which I then put in using the nero control center, however when I then tried to use Nero it said that I had used a pirated key, I was just wondering if I need to do anything else or if the keygen doesn't work for version 8.03?"
,slysilverfox,2007-09-22T22:02Z,i think that nero 8 is only an up-grade at this time.....too many pirated serial numbers against nero 7 stops up grade
,Thiopental,2007-09-26T23:21Z,Use your firewall software to block any web activity of the software. It works just fine.
,dersteppenwolf,2007-10-01T23:03Z,"Just configure your firewall to block internet access to "" NeroPatentActivation.exe"" before first run.
And obviously don not allow automatic updates."
,dersteppenwolf,2007-10-01T23:07Z,"More, 
referred to all this noise about trojan code and keygens, I've submited this one and it had only two hits out o a bunch, as supicious. It seems to be safe, but just in case, let your system run in a safe sandbox firewall."
,sirjason,2007-10-02T10:50Z,"This is the one. I stayed up until now(4:30am-Oct-2-07) To make sure I had the latest software. I always do and Greatly Honor Embrace for the Work that they do. God Bless you guys. By the way it took me about 15 seconds to Download with Cable. After trying so many torrents at no avail, I was shocked at the time it took when someone finaly got online and shared this one. I am Seeding also to give back to others who also Like to enjoy the finer things in life and can't afford other options. Enjoy guys and Girls. BTW! I alwasy wander how many Ladies are out there doing this. Downloading from The Bay and understanding what hey are doing. I am teaching my wife alot about PC and she is really catching on fast."
,sirjason,2007-10-02T10:57Z,"Also,
  dersteppenwolf made a good point. He knows what he's doing folks. Take his advice. Always disconnect your internet before you install any program if you can and do not reconnect until you have fully installed the program and have turned off the updates. Updates allow the company who designed the program access to your PC and Information about registration. Sometimes they will shut your program down or your whole pc in time. Updates can at times slow your PC down when you need Speed and Bandwith the most."
