,Morph1234,2011-04-04T11:34Z,My last comment was in response to a user who had posted a comment that this program did not work on Vista. The comment has since vanished. If anyone has tried this on Vista or Windows 7 please post if you were able to get this working on either of those operating systems. I use XP and it works fine for me.
