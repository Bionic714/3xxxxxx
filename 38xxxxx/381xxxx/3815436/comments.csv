Also if you have an Intel-Mac make sure your ""Host"" or Recording Software also has Universal Binary or else this plugin will not work.
The Guitar Rig 2 plug-in needs a Host with a Universal Binary to run it properly."

In the audio config I only have ""audio core"" as an option and built-in, built-in-input,-built-in-output, I tried any combinaisons but without success. Somebody could help me? Thx"

,Soular09,2008-03-03T01:18Z,Seems none of the save fuctions work from the ap to the hard drive. Tape deck won't save either.
,Soular09,2008-03-05T19:09Z,Responce to : Seems none of the save fuctions work. Moved the .nfo and .diz file to the proper folder and all works properly.  Thanks !
