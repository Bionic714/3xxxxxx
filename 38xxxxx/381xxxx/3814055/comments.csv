,Neblin,2007-11-01T21:36Z,"Hi!
I downloaded this torrent, and I did what it told me... Bridge to plugin folder, libs to root folder (I take ""root folder"" means simply the general c4d r10 folder, as in C:/Program files/MAXON/CinemaR10), but then I open c4d and under render settings - effects, I don't see vraybridge anywhere :( all I get is under Plugins menu in C4D, a tag that says ""Vray Material Converter"".

Can somebody help me please? :)"
,Neblin,2007-11-03T17:00Z,"Hey hey, I just realised how to make it work :)

Once you've done what it says in the pdf ""how to install"" included, start C4D. Under the render settings->Effects, click on the ""Post effects"". There, under the list that appears, select ""Vray Bridge"", and TADA! All the Vray rendering options appear :D

Hope it helps!"

,jeminnovations,2009-11-28T07:29Z,I was wondering if this vray will work in Cinema4D 11.5 ver? Thanks to everyone for all the comments
,jeminnovations,2009-11-28T07:36Z,Also if anyone can help me find Evermotion archinteriors for C4D it would be greatly appreciated. I`ve been looking for weeks and no luck so far. Thanks
,jeminnovations,2009-12-06T18:38Z,I need help...I tried using this on C4D 11.5 and it wont work. I also tried it on C4D 10.5 and it worked fine. Do I have to use Vray 1.5 in C4D 11.5 or do I have to install this Vray 1.01 differently in the 11.5 ver. Please help me out
,lockdrop,2010-01-06T10:34Z,"@ jeminnovations and/or anyone else.  not sure about this one but.... I found v1.05 here  http://www.gappon.com/v-ray-for-cinema-4d-v-1-05-705093.html  - it works on 32 bit only though.  took me a while to figure that out, usually I run the 64bit version...opened the 32bit and there it was.  works perfectly. "
