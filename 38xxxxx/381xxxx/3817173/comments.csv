,Papaloupis,2008-03-03T18:26Z,What soundtrack does this version have?
,schmitty84,2010-01-16T08:42Z,I guess the soundtrack is whatever you happen to be listening to at the time you watch this. It was made in 1922. A time period in which silent movies were about it. You should really do some research before posting stupid comments.
,silentfreak,2010-07-03T23:16Z,"Hey Schmitty,  follow your own advice and do some research.  Every silent film has a musical soundtrack.  This particular film has several different ones.  Papaloupis asked an itelligent question.  Looks like you're the one who posted a stupid comment.  "
