DONT DOWNLOAD!!!"
,FooFun,2007-12-20T05:07Z,"I too have had my virus software report a virus, But....

I was running CA internet security and it too came up with: win32/vmalum.vzv.
 I did search for information on CA web site and found nothing about this virus.
Now how can CA setup there anti virus to detect this but did not list a description of it on
 there site???? 
I all so did a Google on this virus and nothing turned up except this torrent and one other.
So nobody knows anything about this virus not even CA. Food for thought.
So I removed CA from my computer which I was going to do any way since CA slowed my computer down 
(I got CA as a free offer and I don?t think it was worth so much as that price. I do not recommend
 this Software).
I took Godfather's advice and installed Avast Anti virus and scanned the file and it found nothing
 So I can confirm that Godfather is telling the truth. As far as the comment that Avast Av is crap
 I just don?t buy it. These are professional people in this company and this is there bread and
 Butter. They can find the other virus out there but are not been able to detect this one and code
 for it sorry I don?t  think so. On top of that at least one of there competitors was able to set
 up there AV so as to be able to detect it. That's a big stretch to buy into that one.
So getting brave I felt confident to try running the key, but I scanned my computer before and
 after running it. I found no virus none nada. Computer is running fine while I am posting this
 message.
Conclusion: This file will scan as infected by some Anti Virus programs but it is only a false
 positive.
Here is a good question: Who would pay good money to have an AntiVirus company report a file as
 a false positive? Yes I know it could very well be just be just an unentended false positive and
 if this was any other kind of file I would think that too.

Here is an other good question: Why would An AntiVirus Company not have any discription on there
 web site about a virus that there program could potentialy detect on one of there clients
 computers. Don?t you think an infected client would want to learn about this virus to know what
 damage such a virus caused to there computer and what they need to do to get rid of it? On top
 of all of this no body else seems to know any thing about this virus ether, at least as far as
 a Google search?

Well I believe if you ask Good questions then you are not far off from getting the right answer.
What do you think are these questions good enough?

As far as any one else I can certainly understand if someone still would not want to take a chance
 at down loading this software, that?s up to them. As for me I am convinced that these is no virus
 nada nothing clean and Im going to enjoy this program Thanks to Godfather!

I don?t have a problem with someone reporting simply that they think there is some thing wrong with
 a torrent that?s a fair exchange of information and it's there opinion, but otherwise I think some
 people that posted some comments on this torrent owe Godfather an apology!


Thanks Godfather for good advice and a good torrent I hope the crap you took here will not put you
 off from seeding any new torrents. Thanks again.


I would like to know what other Av programs report this file as a virus and which one's do not. I hope
 others will post there findings with there AV's to this torrent.

If any one can find any thing out more about this so called virus I would like that as well.

Scaned file with Symantec. No virus.

Usually keygens are considered trojan. They are submitted to the companies by the AV users, or by the company. If you are using Vista and have UAC active (let's hope you do...) then you can be assured that is the keygen is asking for adminitrative rights, be assured that it is a Torjan/Virus.

I believe its the residential shield that prevents it from working. i just ended all to get it to work and it works fine. after you use the keygen and no longer need it  delete it( from recycle bin also so delete twice) scan your pc with VS and you shouldnt find any viruses any longer.

you can mount the file using poweriso or even roxio 9 if you got it
once mounted its just like having an extra dvd drive on your pc!!

,Xists,2008-03-18T04:05Z,"Honour among thieves....don't post shit with trojans and virii.  And for those of us that get sick of it..

1) Create a virtual machine with basic os and run the cracks and installs inside(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx) it's free...worst case you delete the virtual machine and start over again without screwing your normal windows install. This way you can test the apps/games before you load em on your good install.  

2) Other option is to use soemthing like oh, say Trueimage 11...create a full image of your drive before you install warez..if they screw up your machine you can restore it back in about 15 minutes...it's the only software I thought worth buying and did.
