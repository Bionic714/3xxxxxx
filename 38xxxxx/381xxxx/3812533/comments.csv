,sparkmaker,2008-02-14T18:21Z,"Hi Can you help? I had DW8 for about 4 months, then another user tried to update. The program crashed and will not now start up. Task Manager says ""program not responding"" I have tried everything I know; reinstalling, re downloading, but the same thing happens each time. What have they put on my computer to prevent this program from working? Can I get it off? Any help would be appreciated. To: tc26zxy@yahoo.co.uk"
,Caffeinationz,2008-03-10T07:13Z,"Wow the program works!  However I haven't tried the plugins yet, but the program itself works with the serial.  Before this i tried to install the cs3, but I was having way too many problems so I opted for this one instead =)."

,axxo_team,2008-04-16T23:01Z,"@sparkmarker
Maybe something in your Task Manager is incorrect."
,AboynamedChristy,2008-04-19T04:23Z,Retards... if u look at the files you downloaded one of them is the serial code and the other one is the installation file. serial code is wpd800-58436-27232-80204 btw
,hugeaardvark,2008-04-22T05:49Z,"this nutsack serial no longer werky. 

""The following error(s) must be corrected before this form can be completed:

* That serial number is invalid. Please try again.""

fuckyfucky"
,chilaxe,2008-04-24T05:26Z,"Sparkmaker, if updating an application causes problems, restore to a system restore point from before the update.

Start menu > Accessories > System tools > System restore.

Windows deletes system restore points if you get low on harddrive space.

Sometimes updating is fine, so it could always be something else."
,Nicolon,2008-05-03T23:38Z,Works GREAT. Thanks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,zimonhe,2008-06-03T12:06Z,"Oh, goodie goodie.. just bent backwards for 30 seconds and then boom, finished.

,SumeklamKidd,2008-06-18T21:10Z,"Works great. Insert the serial by hand, do not cut and paste. Do not register. Do not download the update. Enjoy. wpd800-58436-27232-80204"
,SumeklamKidd,2008-06-18T21:12Z,"Some of you folks that gripe and whine really drive me nuts. Why don't you just shell out the bucks and buy the program instead? Sheez.

Ingrates."
,Slodom,2008-06-25T23:24Z,"Having a problem. After using the program one time..it seems I can't open it again. It starts to load and then just dissapears. I tried to Uninstall/Reinstall but even when I try to re-install it never asks me for the serial again...

Any help?"
,kennypashel,2008-07-11T04:20Z,"The link to register with the key is dead, suggestions or another link or i'm doing it wrong?"
,kennypashel,2008-07-11T17:39Z,"Yeah when I click ""buy"" to register with the key it takes me to a dead link, 404 error.  Any other way I can register this?  They must've just done this because I don't see any one else having any other problems before this month...lucky me.  I'll seed if I can get it to work."

"
,kill_joy,2008-08-19T10:36Z,"Not sure if I did this right or not, But it did not ask me to enter a Serial number. It works fine, but I havent uploaded anything I have done on it. You say no activation needed, but then where does the serial number come in at? "

,rv53705,2008-10-05T16:09Z,"Works fine. Thanks. I've discovered CS3 and 8 are the same, but CS3 uses more RAM and CPU."
,m1t0s1s,2008-10-24T20:34Z,"To solve the vista problems, try google:

http://www.google.com/search?q=dreamweaver+8+vista

Dreamweaver 8 was released more than a year before Windows Vista became publicly available and does not officially support this new operating system.
