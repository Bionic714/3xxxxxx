Joe D'Amato's masterpiece Anthropophagus is both one of the finest and the least appreciated of the Italian Horror Golden Age. D'Amato had already established himself as the master of raw gore in Blue Holocaust (aka Beyond the Darkness aka Buried Alive), and the snuff movie footage in Emmanuelle in America (the inspiration for Videodrome). In his entry into the slasher genre, he enriches Anthropophagus with a steady build-up of layered atmosphere until he has recreated the old dark castle effect of the classic Universal monster movies of the 30s. Then he lets the blood flood. Released butchered in the states as Grim Reaper, this version is uncut and contains the films two highmarks: the scene where a fetus is pulled out of a pregnant woman and eaten, as well as the pull out your fingernails climax where cannibalism is taken to it's most extreme. Most haunting is the flashback explaining where the flesheater came from, it makes your stomach drop. This movie establishes D'Amato in the ranks of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci as one of the masters of the spagetti nightmare.
