Recently a story broke--though not very loudly in the mainstream media--that six nuclear warheads had been "accidentally" flown from North Dakota to Louisiana.

... several air force folks from the two involved bases (Minot in North Dakota and Barksdale in Louisiana) have since turned up dead.

Is the explanation so monstrous that most people would refuse to accept it?
