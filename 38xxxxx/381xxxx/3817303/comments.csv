,rogueqd,2010-10-15T05:27Z,"While these are great docos, the quality is very low.

Video resolution: 320x176
Audio bitrate: 80kb/s (stereo)

The image quality is reasonable if you can handle watching something at such a low resolution.

This is a DVD-ROM image. Burn or mount to access the .avi files inside."
