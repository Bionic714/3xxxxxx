2002 - THE CENTURY OF THE SELF



"This series is about how those in power have used Freud's theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy." - Adam Curtis

Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, changed the perception of the human mind and its workings profoundly. His influence on the 20th century is widely regarded as massive. The documentary describes the impact of Freud's theories on the perception of the human mind, and the ways public relations agencies and politicians have used this during the last 100 years for their "engineering of consent".The Century of the Self asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of modern consumerism, representative democracy and its implications. It also questions the modern way we see ourselves, the attitude to fashion and superficiality.

The business and, increasingly, the political world uses PR to read and fulfill our desires, to make their products or speeches as pleasing as possible to us. Curtis raises the question of the intentions and roots of this fact. Where once the political process was about engaging people's rational, concious minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a society, the documentary shows how by employing the tactics of psychoanalysis, politicians appeal to irrational, primitive impulses that have little apparent bearing on issues outside of the narrow self-interest of a consumer population.

Episode List:
Episode 1 - Happiness Machines
Episode 2 - The Engineering of Consent
Episode 3 - There is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads: He Must Be Destroyed

2004 - THE POWER OF NIGHTMARES (The Rise of the Politics of Fear)



The series consists of three one-hour films, consisting mostly of a montage of archive footage with Curtis's narration, which were first broadcast in the United Kingdom in late 2004 and have been subsequently aired in multiple countries and shown in several film festivals, including the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.

The films compare the rise of the American Neo-Conservative movement and the radical Islamist movement, making comparisons on their origins and noting strong similarities between the two. More controversially, it argues that the threat of radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organised force of destruction, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is in fact a myth perpetrated by politicians in many countriesâ??and particularly American Neo-Conservativesâ??in an attempt to unite and inspire their people following the failure of earlier, more utopian ideologies.

The Power of Nightmares has been praised by film critics in both Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from conservatives and progressives.

Episode List:
Part 1 - Baby It's Cold Outside
Part 2 - The Phantom Victory
Part 3 - The Shadows in the Cave

Personally I have been desparately looking for a great Paul Newman film called "HARPER" from 1966. It was called "The Moving Target" in the UK. I've been looking for it for years! I only managed to get an ed2K copy but that was in Spanish. So if anyone has a copy of it IN ENGLISH:
Please Please Please!!! Put a torrent up!!!
