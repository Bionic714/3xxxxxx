Thank you very much for this awesome torrent. I bought the CD more than 10 years ago, and then I lost it when I moved to a new house. It's a very hard to find CD now. I will definitely seed this!"

Special renditions of some of the album's songs are featured in the fabulous Broadway production, which made me miss this album even more.  Thanks again!"
