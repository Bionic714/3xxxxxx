Need a flashed X360, Use IMGburn.

1. Unpack all .rar, .r00, .r01 .... .r66 to .dvd and .iso file

2. Install and open ""ImgBurn"", choose tools -> settings -> write. Change Layer Break (For DL Media) to User Specified and write there 1913760.

3. Next, tools -> drive -> change book type, and choose your dvd burner and press Change For: and choose Drive (For DVD+R DL Media). Then press New Setting: and DVD-ROM. Change and OK. 

4. Then Choose Mode -> Write. Set write speed to 2.4x then open .DVD file!!! Then start burning on your DVD+R DL disc."

,bomberboy,2008-07-20T18:23Z,"For everyone's help:
A .dvd file is simply a small text file used by the program ImgBurn (download it - it's free) that tells the program what to use for the layer break. Usually this number is 1913760 and can be changed manually in settings. But if there is a .dvd file then don't worry about it. Just open the .dvd in ImgBurn and set the burn speed to 2.4x and voila! You know have Halo 3. Just think of a .dvd is an .cue file.

You will also need a dual layer DVD burner to burn a dual layer DVD :)

As for playing on live, I know that one of the copies of Halo 3 floating around has a bad kreon rip, meaning that it's possible to be detected by Microsoft. Chances are this one is fine but play at your own risk.

Opening this iso in dvd mulleter shows almost all the boxes are checked, so does that mean i need to do anything with it? Do i have to worry about inserting the SS files or anything? Also, the layer break 1913760 appears correct in the .dvd file, but why does it say ""bone.iso""? Should it be ccclx-halo3.iso? If no one answers i think i will just burn it without the .dvd file, using the imgburn settings instead."

,choas44,2009-10-07T01:19Z,"OK here is my situation.I know this may have been answered but,i have just flashed an xbox firmware and all and the only thing i need to do is test if it was succesfull,so i burned the entire folder using nero burning rom to a dual layer dvd and in the xbox the disc came up as ""mixed media disc"" and when i hit ""a"" it does nothing,so have i done this wrong and if so what is the correct way to do it,pleez and thank you..."
,000king000,2009-10-11T23:26Z,just a question but what do you do with these 67 files to get it into an image file?
,clomkfly,2009-10-28T14:53Z,"@000king000 and @chaos44
havent download fully yet but best guess is like all mulit-rars. 
1)use winrar to extract the first .rar by left-clicking and itll extract all of them and combine them in a folder for you.
2) inside folder shold be a "".dvd"" file and your iso. run the iso thru agbx360 (download if not already)
3) download and install imgburn. open it. goto settings>write> and change layer break to ""user specified"" and insert  ""1913760"" (no quotes). lol
4) use imgburn to burn the .dvd file to verbatim brand dual layer dvds. burn at 2.4x speed. if issues occur, reburn at 4x.

depending on your burner drive you may have to manually change booktype to DVD-ROM. google is king in that adventure. (try searching for ""xbox360 imgburn backup booktype""!
hope it helps guys
please add or edit anything i may have forgot"
,clomkfly,2009-10-28T14:54Z,"if anyone is download using uTorrent. goto bottom bar an left-click upload, click unlimited or your game wont burn correct! LOL HEHE"
,thefutureworks,2009-11-09T21:45Z,"What a load of rubbish. This has been uploaded by some company trying to get business or something. For starters it downloads as .iso file, which you have to extract (7 zip will do it, google it, it's free and easy to use) and then the game itself is winrar compressed and won't uncompress untill you sign up to some internet site (which I thought I'd do, just give some fake name) but the link doesn't work. I have never downloaded an xbox game like this before. WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH. I have this on order from amazon. I'll upload it as soon as it arrives, with out all this crap."
