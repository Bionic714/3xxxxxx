,Meltdownpyro,2007-10-06T07:49Z,"oh an btw while its ""activly refusing"" my connection im only getting from 5-20 kb/s so it sez 3 weeks now....."
,sheffboy,2007-10-07T18:58Z,"I dont know why it said the tracker actively refused it Meltdownpyro.
But it said ETA 1 day because I have seeded 19% to 19 people and they will seed that 19% to you at very high speeds, but they cant seed for me beyond that because they dont have the data to seed...
my connection is crap, but its going at a solid 25kb/s and I will leave it on 24/7 for however many weeks it takes.

If you want to hurry it alone, DL some episodes from another torrent and add them to your DL folder for this torrent, then do force re-check and you will be nearer to completion"
,Meltdownpyro,2007-10-11T03:37Z,i've been busy the last couple days an im only gettin max of 25 nemore but i leave my comp on 24/7 so soon as i get a moment ill find some episodes an do that but when im done ill be able to transfere at alot more than 25. ill find out my max upload capability an let ya know jus for somethin to do.
