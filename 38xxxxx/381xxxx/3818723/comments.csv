Bill W, what a looser he was. Just another greedy alcoholic that wrote down his delirious thoughts just after 2 years of soberness. The very same man said that it takes at least 7 years of total soberness to gain sanity again. So, how in hell can anyone believe in what he said? And when he recommended LSD as a great medicine for alcoholics.. hAhahahahahahaha

tuberok, i am not complaining on you, just the trash you uploaded here"
