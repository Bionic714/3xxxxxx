Emmy Awards 2007

These are funny clips with Steve Carell, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Lewis Black.

1. Nominations for writing in music/comedy program: Colbert Report, Daily Show, Conan, Letterman, Real Time with Bill Maher.
As usual the nomination clips are kind of little sketches made by the shows themselves.
Conan O'Brien wins and the writer who accepts is pretty funny so I kept that bit (unfortunately the first joke demands that you saw Katherine Heigl's acceptance speach, where she said even her mother told her she wouldn't win).

2. Steve Carell presents award for music/comedy series (includes taped bit of Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer), and Jon Stewart accepts for The Daily show.

3. Lewis Black does a rant slash standup routine.

4. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert presents award for lead actor in comedy series.  Hilarious.  Steve Carell joins in.  Not to be missed.
