Why do the writers keep ruining everything that's good? Superman/Batman stories are such a rich source of great material and yet here we get crap. I mean WTH! Superman is the angsty recluse and Batman is saying go team go? At least Batgirl wasn't in this episode, talk about character assassination.

Props to the animator who made Lex's building, that was the highlight for me.
