There are 50+ all stuck at 90.7%"
,the_slasher,2007-09-24T16:14Z,"I'm really sorry for the crappy upload rate and to all getting stuck at 90%. I left the laptop on but forget to tell my roommate not to turn off the modem.

I am seeding it now...hopefully some of you would be able to seed this faster than my connection....


cheers =)"
