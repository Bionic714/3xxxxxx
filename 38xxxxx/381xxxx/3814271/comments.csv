It's good that you include nfo file and sample now. This way, the origin is still visible. Nice. One last suggestion: I'd find it cool if the torrent name would be the original one, but with an [UNPACKED] added to it. This way, all can see what it is. Btw, I am neither a douchebag nor mpaa. No hard feelings from my side :-)

cheers"
