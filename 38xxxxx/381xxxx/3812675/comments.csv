Some of my friends and I may subtitle it; unless a group does a good job first.  Please, if you sub it, give credit where credit is due for the rip."
,navarr,2007-09-20T05:33Z,"Also, when you receive, PLEASE SEED.
Since nobody else has released this; there is no way I can support everyone by being the only seeder.  It will take forever to download; please, please seed.

Thank you, and goodnight."

Nice torrent, but it would probably do better if it was subtitled. Please put some subtitles on this as soon as you can, who knows if the movie will ever hit US shores!"

,navarr,2007-09-30T20:16Z,"I'm sorry about that michitakem.  More people who have downloaded this, please seed.

This torrent has been around for 10 days, and has been downloaded 22 times, yet, I've uploaded a total of 20.1GB (36.6 copies).  Wow."
,dxmkrew,2007-10-05T09:30Z,"a subbing team called tatertotz has done an english subtitle of this.  it comes in 4 parts, you can download parts 1-4 at animesuki dot com.  

i'll leave this open for seeds whenever i have utorrent open.  i'm still hoping someone will do soft subs for this file.  the tatertotz version is okay but some of the subtitles overlap eachother and stuff.  it is still great work though.  totally recommended."
