My first torrent so bear with me.

Included in the torrent:

1.) Windows Vista Home Premium x86 32-bit Dell OEM.iso file.

Use Nero Burning ROM, PowerISO, MagicISO, ISO Recorder, or your favorite app to burn the ISO to a blank DVD. It is a bootable ISO, so pop it in your DVD drive, reboot, and you\'re good to go!

2.) Clony OneClick Activator

All you need to do is double-click this file, and it will install. When told to do so, reboot, and Vista will be activated. Kudos to Clonysoft for this, as I did not make it. So far, this is the only one that worked 100% of the time for me, and my colleagues.

And you\'ll be done! Passes WGA and updates as it would usually. 

I will seed as long as I can.
