[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-09-26T22:27Z,"@sirATthebox: 

sure does. everything works on it ;). 

Oh, and if you have a Dell computer, you don't even need a crack! It will be already activated since it is a Dell OEM DVD.

@reminisce; no, sorry, you need a DVD and a DVD burner to copy the image to the DVD. All Vista versions come on DVDs because the data stored on the disk is too much for CDs."

[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-09-28T00:10Z,"Yep!! Updates are fully functional. Passes WGA, as well. But I will say this again; If you are using a dell machine, you don't even need the crack or have to worry about Updates/WGA, because Dell OEM + Dell machine = Automatically Genuine ;)."

,troiscake,2007-10-03T20:01Z,"hi, i was wondering:
1. what is meant by Dell OEM? will this work on a non Dell computer?

2. and when burning the vista dvd, do i include the activator program on the disc?

thanks"
,simme_7070,2007-10-04T07:07Z,plzz seed stuck at 80%
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-10-04T21:46Z,"Dell OEM just means that it was made by dell to be installed on a Dell computer.

It is just like any other Vista install disk, but it doesn't ask for a Serial # when you first install it, and it includes a bit of codes for said machines. 

To answer your question in plain language, no, you do not need a Dell computer to use this disk.

To answer the 2nd question, you could include the activator on the ISO, but if you cant, a simple Flash drive or something will be suffice.

,davidz23,2007-10-09T17:16Z,On another preactivated by dell torrent there are comments from people saying they had to pay a registration fee after 28 days of using the software...100% sure this doesnt happen on this one?

[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-10-13T16:38Z,"If your computer is a Dell, then you do not need to crack it.

Clony OneClick is a simple activation crack that changes a few registry values to make it genuine in Microsoft's eyes. 

You double click it, let it run, then when it tells you to reboot, do so, and then upon reboot it is genuine."

,Archannon,2007-10-29T03:07Z,"Hiya, I'm having trouble with this. I tried two things:

- Burned the ISO straight to a DVD, which did nothing. (Not even when I tried to start it via boot menu)
- Used Daemon Tools to mount the ISO and then made a DVD copy of it.
I had somewhat more success here, albeit limited.

Here's what happend:
I rebooted, booted from the DVD. Yay, installation window. So I tell it to format my C partition with my old windows XP installation, works. I tell it to install on the C partition, I get to a window where it says 5 steps, the second being ""Expanding Files"" or something similar. This stays at 0% for a while and then I get an error saying it doesn't have the correct setup files and the installation is aborted.

I made a second attempt, same story.
I made a third attempt in a different manner, I had it install to my E partition instead, keeping the windows XP which I had reinstalled in between on my C intact. THis time I got much further, I went past the Expanding Files, all the way to the final step ""Completing Installation"" on this step it hung for about 40 minutes at which point I rebooted figuring it shouldnt take that long.

My PC is less than a half year old with all recent hardware in it. Anyone have a clue as to what I'm doing wrong?

Cheers"
,Bluedk,2007-10-29T14:30Z,"@Archannon 

Sounds weird yea.. Im going to try and install it later today, and I'll let you know how it goes.

,Bluedk,2007-10-30T04:43Z,"Hi again

Got it downloadet, burn't it on a DVD. and tryet to boot with it, nothing happent, it just starter up normally, I guess it couldent ""see"" that it was a Win disc in the drive.

I tryed to unpack the file, and no problem in that. (used WinRAR) - I now got all the files just like with a normal WIN cd. I burnd all the unpacked files (9 with the VistaActivator) onto a DVD. and clickt on the SETUP file and installed the hole thing with no problems at all, and it works. And the VistaActivator works to. Ofcouse it sucks a little that it dident format my HD. first like with normal win. installations but wtf :) It createt a DIR. called Windows-old, and I just deletet that when I was done installing.

So maybe do it like that Archannon? :)


ONLY downside is, that my PC. now think it a DELL. :D :P

,Bluedk,2007-10-30T04:50Z,"ohh and btw, another downside..

[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-04T04:59Z,"The AVG scan is false. 

It just says that because the activator changes the registry on a wide scale, and modifies system files without confirmation.

I am downloading this to see how Vista works, and I will get a retail version in the near future. Here are a couple of questions I hope you can help me with.

1) I understand that Clony OneClick Activator is just a software, so if I were to do a clean format and install with the retail version, the effects of the Activator will be wiped clean? i.e. the systems strings that were changed.

2) Do you have any issue with any programs you might have while the Activator is running in the background?

Thanks for the reply in advance, and happy holidays =)"
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-12-25T05:19Z,"No no, I think you have it all wrong. This application is not a app that runs all the time...its a one time thing. Run the app, it activates, you never see it again ;)

Of course, there are no drawbacks.

To answer vistaflex's question, no, you most likely do NOT need to use the Clony Activator to activate your Vista. If you do, well you know where to find it ;)"

,DiggerDan,2007-12-31T20:54Z,"Downloaded this several weeks ago. What a pain in the ass unless you have the Dell license. After searching and searching I was able to find a whole list of manufacturer licenses.

Originally was Genuine for the last 3-4 weeks. But as of 12/29 no longer genuine and in reduced functionality mode. Can buy a legit license for $119 which isn't bad. Might just go for to Ultimate for $199 which includes the install DVD.

Don't talk about crap that you don't understand.  It's a Dell OEM you turd.  It's preloaded with a serial number (Dell's), thus not having to ask for a serial during install is normal.  It is preactivated on a Dell computer, and not activated on non-Dell motherboards.  So I'm asking my question again.  Uploader, where is your source of this ISO?"

If your computer is a genuine Dell machine bought within the last couple of years you will most likely not have to activate, this is the Dell OEM version meaning it is pre-activated for Dell computers.

If you install this on any other make of computer (HP Compaq, Sony, Packard Bell, Fujitsu Seimens, Gateway etc. etc.) it will NOT be activated and after 30 days it will demand you activate it and give you reduced functionality. The uploader has included a crack to get round this. Run the Clony OneClick Activator and it should now pass activation. 

I have a feeling those of you saying this does not work are using non Dell computers and have not run the crack. Read the guys instructions, he's made it pretty clear!"

,Thibor65,2008-04-14T00:31Z,"I have a feeling most of the people having trouble activating this are not using Dell PC's. Vista Dell OEM's usually do not need activating if being used on a Dell machine. To answer ghost_pirate702 Vista  comes with loads of drivers for all sorts of hardware so thats why you didn't have to download any, As for your driver issue, Have a look in devices and see if any have a little yellow triangle next to them, If they do chances are thats your unknown device, Just update the driver for it.
Burning a .iso file: Use SuperISO or nero burning ROM AND you have to burn it to a blank DVD as a CD is only around 700MB so not enough space to fit 2.6GB on it.
Hope this has helped some of you.
I'll download it and try it on my Dell Inspiron, Its less than 2 years old so should work fine. I'll let you know."

,Steven6767,2008-10-12T06:48Z,"Hmm, this torrent still asks for activation. Im on a Dell E520, performed a clean install and everything. I've also used every crack possible and I still cannot crack vista! (timerstop, paradox, clony, vista loader, not one crack works!) I've also download 4 vista versions supposedly pre activated. STILL asks for activation! Now im running on the stupid 30 day evaluation. Anyone got any suggestions? Thanks in advance."
,Steven6767,2008-10-12T18:23Z,Nevermind I finally found a working crack! If anyone is having trouble cracking vista try Timerlock. Google it and you'll find it. All it does is pause the timer for your evaluation period. Really easy to do also.

,fliptop_,2008-12-29T22:07Z,"hi all - it took me 5 days to d/l this file due to a lack of seeders.  i'll continue seeding as long as i can, it looks like there's a few peers actively looking for this particular file.  i'm currently at 1.4 ratio."

,Wolfshadow6,2010-10-28T11:34Z,Does anyone know if this works on a Non-Dell PC that has an OEM version of Vista Home Premium? Trying to wipe the HDD clean of all the crap HP puts in their computers and would like to use little sister's existing Windows Key. Would this work? 
,6daemon9,2011-11-06T16:40Z,"Downloading now at ~400Kbps to reinstall a Dell XPS 410.

Hopefully this version works for the CD key i already have.

Will report back after installation."
,6daemon9,2011-11-07T21:54Z,"Followup:

Disk image worked perfectly! The Dell XPS 410 was sold in 2007 and this image let this install without question and was registered properly upon entering the OS.

Just to double check, I manually changed the key to the one on the sticker and the activation code was exactly the same and stated Windows was genuine and activated.

Cheers uploader!"
