,PaleSmurfeee,2008-03-11T19:38Z,"I echo that. Thank you so much, mothish. I usually don't seed much more than my share, but this is a wonderful show that's really hard to find. Will seed for a long time. THANK YOU!"
,dbg1115,2010-08-14T04:48Z,"its poorly seeded, yes. but i'm okay waiting a few days for something this good. i try to seed, but you cant seed and watch at the same time, making it a easy choice to be a douche and enjoy the show, or be a good person and have a boring weekend."

@dbg1115: Why can't you seed and watch at the same time? Something wrong with your computer?"

Seeding this to 100 GB."
