,Twilight99,2007-09-24T17:51Z,Thanks! I've been waiting a long time for this. And extra thanks for uploading it uncompressed.
,sonic_fan1,2007-09-25T08:23Z,"No problem and your welcome! :-)
It's up to you to decide if you want to compress it before burning it, or just leave it as is and burn it to a dual-layer DVD.
And, as always, enjoy and please share as much as possible 8-)"
,vinryk,2007-09-26T18:01Z,"Oh, great upload. I was wondering if it would ever get released at all. Unfortunately I don't see any seeders at all."
,sonic_fan1,2007-09-27T21:09Z,"Just be patient once you start downloading it... I have limited outgoing bandwidth.
Once a couple people have the whole thing, it should be easier to get ahold of it."
,vinryk,2007-10-02T22:31Z,I will be patient. Please keep it coming as this is a very rare release.
,sonic_fan1,2007-10-03T01:33Z,"Well... I also have the DTS disc of this movie (in both English and Japanese) and I'm considering posting it on here if there's enough people who would be interested in it.
So, post and let me know what you think."
,vinryk,2007-10-03T18:50Z,I am getting download speeds of ..... o bits per second. Sometimes a quick burst but this is going to take a few weeks for me to download. Please keep seeding.

I can see you're working hard because from time to time I get a great download from you. This tells me you have good speed but to many peers.

The problem is that all the peers on your throat will ask for the same thing and you will end up seeding 30GB just to make one of us a seed (a huge redundance).

If you ""ban"" all but say 5 of us, those five will get a lot higher download and can in turn send to others. 
Find five peers that seems to have a good speed (I see you have the official client) and ban the rest. From time to time you will have to get back and clean out some newcomer.

I bet the total speed will at least triple if not more !... also for the ones that you've ""banned""... and you will be rid of this :-)"
,sonic_fan1,2007-10-06T10:02Z,"Okay... is that any better, anyone?
I set the limit to 5 people at a time for awhile... at least until a few people get it.  Thanks for suggesting that one... I really want more people to get this one.
I couldn't find an option or right-click menu for setting bans for people, otherwise I woulda done it that way."
,vinryk,2007-10-08T18:21Z,"I am currently at 86%. It is taking a loooong time, but it will be worth it."
,hfw,2007-10-09T22:59Z,"""I couldn't find an option or right-click menu for setting bans for people, otherwise I woulda done it that way.""

hmmmmm

When you said that I wonder about your possible settings.

In BitTornado you can set ""superseed"" which as I understand it send out each piece once... if someone else ask for a piece you've already sent your client says no and that leacher has to go look somewhere else. This is by far - of those clients I know - the most effective seeding.

In BitComet (I'm most accuainted with BitComet) you can ""ban"" all but a few and that is bad but not as bad as trying to seed a 200 leacher swarm.

In Âľtorrent (what I run now) there is this option called ""initial seeding"" and that behaves as some kind of superseed I guess.

The official client... I dont know... I would recomend you to switch to Âľtorrent.

Sorry for beeing unprecise

But I suspect that if you check some ""summary"" of your torrent you will see you have sent away about 20GB by now..."
,goteki49,2007-11-26T04:05Z,I was so pissed when I bought this DVD at suncoast only to find out when I got home it was only music videos using the music from the film with random footage from the film. (That suncoast went out of business and wasn't accepting returns either). WTF is with these company's squeezing every last cent from the consumer?
,swanie5555,2008-02-12T02:02Z,"thank you for seeding, luv this show "
,ahall77,2008-04-24T07:45Z,"Sweet deal that you did the full uncompressed file! Need more seeders like you.

Too bad it's PAL. Not bitchin' or anything. Anyone know where to find an NTSC version? Full DVD9 would be great."
,sonic_fan1,2008-04-29T09:56Z,"I would have gotten the NTSC version, but after researching it, I decided that this one would be a better deal: the NTSC version is a strictly bare-bones release (Japanese-only audio, english subtitles, not much else)... the PAL version presented here has much more to offer in my opinion."
,sonic_fan1,2008-05-14T05:27Z,"Also... this is the full uncompressed DVD of it; unmodified from what's on the Region 2 DVD (Disc 1).  If enough people ask for it, I'll rip and upload Disc 2 which is identical to this one, just instead of stereo and 5.1 audios, it's DTS only."
,herr-grinch,2008-05-22T04:23Z,I'm seeding this at 50 kbps for a while. You're welcome :)
,kylehinds,2008-08-23T20:18Z,it would really be cool if u posted the dts version i saw a demo of the movie ona dts demo disc an i would really like to have it but its not on sale in my region if u have the time and resources would be a good torrent   thanks 
,sonic_fan1,2008-08-31T21:55Z,"Okay... I posted the DTS version!
It's located at: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4372161/ 
Hope you enjoy it... just remember that it's DTS only (Japanese and English) and it's dual-layer."
,DEXECON,2012-01-27T14:52Z,"hey guys can someone tell me what these files are? i'm currently downloading it but i have no idea what these files are. there doesnt seem to be a video file but alot of .vob files

,DionisBah,2012-01-28T19:32Z,"Thanks for sharing.
