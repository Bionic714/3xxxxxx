already downloaded this..."
,shmerkeljerk,2007-11-06T00:57Z,"I just installed it yesterday. Works fine for me. Haven't noticed anything suspicious or anything. Great upload!

(I had to uninstall the express version that comes with VS2005.)"
,shmerkeljerk,2007-11-10T19:11Z,"Follow-up: FYI: I don't think this will install the server stuff on XP (just the client stuff). See system requirements at http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/enterprise/sysreqs.mspx

(I thought it was installed 'cause the new client thing transparently hooked up to the SQL Server 2000 process on my machine.)"
,mgusten,2007-11-28T19:15Z,"do i need to enter a key?
because i can just choose to install: Sample databases, samples, and SQL Server 2005 documentation

These are not an option i can check
#  Database Engine
# Analysis Services
# Reporting Services
# Notification Services
# Integration Services
# Replication
# Management Tools
# Connectivity Components

whats wrong?"
,LeMans2005,2007-12-14T14:27Z,"OK, this is a fully working copy which does not need a key. It runs perfectly on Windows Server 2003 Enterprise and all the options are available. It won't run the SQLServer on Windows XP because it was never deigned to, but you can install the SQL client on your 2000/XP Pc.

It installed and ran on my 2003 Enterprise server, and even after changing the date to 2009, rebooting a few times, then changing the date back to 2007 it still ran every time

So I guess it's fully operational. Thanks for the up, this has saved me a lot of cash!"
