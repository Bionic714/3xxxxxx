,Rev911,2009-03-30T07:49Z,"Jingo, you don't have enough sense to make a penny. So what if there's fucking subs? Grow the fuck up and buy the damn movie if you don't want the damn subs. Oh, and it's sad that you talk like that and somehow actually WANT to watch this movie. People like you ought to be shot like the stupid animals you are."
