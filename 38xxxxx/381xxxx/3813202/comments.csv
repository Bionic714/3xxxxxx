,SpifJif,2007-09-27T06:52Z,"Hey Dopeman, something I noticed when I downloaded GTR2 from you on another site: Whenever I play the game the graphics are very bland and bad looking even though I know I can run the game on high and I do. I think its something with dling games cause I got rFactor recently and the graphics look awful too. Im not sure what to do.
And im high.
Thanks for the torrents though"

,xiIix,2008-04-21T02:48Z,"Wow, what a piece of shit compared to the original Word Racing. The physics have been ruined, and it's just not even close to as fun to drive. They turned what could've been a great sequel into a steaming pile of arcade shit. I've never been so disappointed. 

It's been a few years since I played World Racing, so I nabbed it yesterday, and decided to give the sequel a try today to see if it was any better. Holy shit, what a waste of bandwidth. This could've been such a great game if they'd just stuck with the characteristics that made the original so great. Typical folly made my a dieing software developer that tried to bring in more cash by raping it's best titled of what made it so great in the first place."
,xiIix,2008-04-21T04:41Z,"And ""viperjago""... this release works just fine. Get your head out of your ass and make sure you know what you're talking about before you spread mis-information. The game might suck balls compared to the original, but this release does in fact work."
