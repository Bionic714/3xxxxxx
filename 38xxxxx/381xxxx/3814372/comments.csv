,artylandia,2008-02-19T23:21Z,"Well, yeah, this one is out of synch, for only 2 seconds, but it is not the end of the world, if you are a Hard-Core fan like me, this is what I did:
Open the VirtualDubMod-->File-->Open Video File-->AmericasNextTopModelS09E01.avi-->
Open-->No-->Streams-->Stream List-->Save Wav-->Name it ""ANTM S09E01 Audio""-->Save-->Close the VDub-->Open the Wav file with the Windows Media Player and let it play in the back-->Open the Video File With BSPlayer in MUTE and synch it yourself with the Rewind/Forward, really easy (the WPlayer plays the Audio, and the BSplayer the video) its 2 seconds, once you got it enjoy the show..."
