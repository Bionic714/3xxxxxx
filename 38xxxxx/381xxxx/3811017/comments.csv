From Casoe84"
,casoe84,2007-09-18T19:40Z,"Yes there is a keygen in the ISO file in the folder ""Crack"", and i know it works because I have installed on both my computer with that keygen"
,silverfoxdk,2007-09-19T09:38Z,25 download ! 1 Seed ??? com'on people ! let's seed a bit.
,freeb1rd,2007-09-19T22:31Z,"I downloaded and am seeding however, I can't get the KeyGen to work. It keeps telling me that the generated code is either invalid or is an upgrade code and asks me for the previous product and its code. I'll keep seeding and hopefully someone will get it working..."
,caxarlis,2007-09-28T09:30Z,Do we know if it works now?
,Eera,2007-09-28T15:18Z,"To casoe84: Very nice torrent, thanks for putting it up here.
To anyone having problems with the keygen: Mount the image, install it and load up the keygen from the Crack folder.
Generate Serial, use the top then bottom serial (The bottom one worked for me, the top one didn't) After than continue through it until you come to the page about how you are on the 30day trial, go to other options (I've just woken up and done it so forgive my bad memory) and you should have the option to activate via phone, choose this and it will give you an ""Activation code"" and paste it into the box under ""Generate Serial"" and then click Activate, you will now have a new code under that box, type that into the boxes in the screen and OK, congratulations thats you done.

Hope that helped"
,secret42,2007-09-28T17:45Z,using phone activation.... where do I get the activation code?
,iguessthisismyname,2007-09-28T18:16Z,"Works perfectly, no troubles.

The two keys generated are for (a) the current serial and (b) the original serial.  Paste the first serial in the first screen and on the next screen paste the second one.

When activating, select by telephone, it'll show an activation code under the serial you entered.  Paste this into the box in the keygen and click activate.  The code that appears is what you're looking for.

Cheers casoe84."
,caxarlis,2007-09-28T18:18Z,"Thanks a lot for the help on how to activate it.
Cheers for the upload!"
,sdrugger,2007-09-28T23:38Z,"After successfully using the keygen and starting the install, the installer routine hangs during the ""validating install"" segment with the progress bar at about 60% complete.  I've waited more than 15 minutes to see if it would resume and no joy. Have also tried installing as a trial user (i.e., no serial number) and installing from a desktop folder with all the install files copied to it.  Still no luck breaking the ""validating install"" hang.  Any ideas?"
,sdrugger,2007-09-29T00:43Z,"Disregard previous comment.  I needed to sever my internet connection during the install. Once I did that, then the installer finally timed out and completed the install.  Activation by telephone as described elsewhere above went smoothly. Product is fully functional."
,ebusch,2007-10-01T00:25Z,Awesome... It Works!!!
,greatmac27,2007-10-03T13:13Z,"read comment by eera....
use the key gen to get the first number, then paste the activation number from the 30 day trial, into the key gen then activate, put that number in on adobes page the viola."

,calista48,2007-10-08T19:26Z,"lol ok nevermind., i have it now. i was not generating a activation code. i installed it offline, generated the serial, i had to choose version 6 bc ver5 didnt work and then i entered the serials and then activation by phone option and then pasted the number in the crack and generated the code. works great now. thanks so much.

,vinnie1337,2007-10-13T22:17Z,"Problem - doesn't ask for activation, but always asks for registration, no matter what you do. Both ""remind me later"" and ""don't remind me"" don't work, and filling out the form (with fake details, of course) and accepting doesn't work either. Otherwise fully functional (as of now). "

Works Great (after re-reading the instructions in this thread). Here's what I did:

1) Download AcroPro_80_efg.exe from Adobe's website
2) Run AcroPro_80_efg.exe.
3) Run Key Gen
4) Click on ""Generate Serial"" button in middle of app.
5) Adobe Acrobat 8 setup asked me if I wanted to install trial or full version. I selected Full version and entered the 1st (top) serial that was generated from the key gen.
6) It tried to confirm the # but couldn't. It then asked me for a valid serial number for my upgrade. I then entered the 2nd serial number from the key gen (the one above the ""generate Serial"" button.
7) The install then proceeded as normal
8) When I launched Adobe 8 it asked me to ""activate"". I clicked on the activate button and it gave me an error.
9) In Adobe, I clicked the Activate By Phone option.
10) It than showed me a screen with the 800 number, My serial Number (entered from step
5 above) and an ""activation number"". I cut-pasted this number into the white text box under the Generate Serial button, then clicked ""Activate"" in the lower left hand of the key gen.
11) I then entered the number that it produced into the ""Response"" section that Adobe was asking for.

That's it!!!!! Follow the steps and it should work fine. A little confusing I know, and if you have a previously registered version of Acrobat you may get something different."

,tmpzor,2008-02-21T05:35Z,"This torrent works 100%.  I was a bit confused with the crack at first (as many others seem to be).

The keygen is a bit confusing, I tried 4 times before I realized I was doing it all wrong.
There are two buttons (""Generate serial"" and ""Activate"")
The Activate button is used only when you do the phone activation thingy; - and you will get a THIRD serial number (it will appear on the grey field above the activate button in the keygen)"

3 - run Acrobat V8/9 and click Accept inthe  licence agreement - it shld work.

4 - logout and log back in to main user

,OnePiecePirate,2011-08-06T03:43Z,"Got a few rather confusing problems:

1. How do you get the keygen to run? I double-clicked/opened it, but nothin happened at all (The installer screen was at ""enter serial"" for the full version)

2. Eera said that ""you mount the image, install it, load the keygen..."" By install, does it mean wait after installation is finished then load the keygen? If so, that wouldn't be possible since I'm stucked at the enter serial for full version--unless I go for the trial one. Then the activation code, which I don't even know to get it, is needed.
"
,OnePiecePirate,2011-08-06T04:39Z,"O.K forget my stupid comments above--after rebooting and reinstalling it again and again, I found that it was ad-aware that blocked the keygen (i only stopped officescan lol sorry 'bout that)"
,OnePiecePirate,2011-08-06T05:39Z,"O.K! Now everything is alright! Followed Eera's instruction and now I can edit my lecture notes.

Here's a detailed step-by-step:

1. Finish the torrent download

2. Mount the download--""Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional"" (used DAEMON tools lite)

3. Double-Click the ""Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional"" folder

4. Double-Click the ""AcroPro"" installer

5. Accept the agreement

6. Choose your installation preference (I chosed ""Custom"")

7. Enter whatever you want in the NAME & COMPANY fields

8. Choose ""Full Installation--enter serial (sth like that)""

9. Go back to your mounted iso--there's a keygen in the ""Crack"" folder (For those who can't find it must have been EXTRACTING the iso instead burning/mounting it.)

10. Make sure you allow ""keygen"" in your anti-virus program(s)--otherwise you'll ended up like me :p

11. Double-click the keygen and it should open up the usual keygen window (see step 10)

12. Click the ""Generate Serial"" button--it should give you two serials above the button (each has 24 digits)

12. Copy the top serial, and paste it in the ""enter serial"" field as mentioned in step 8--it should work

13. In the next page (Upgrade...), choose ""Verify Serial"" and copy-paste the second serial

14. It should then start the installation--wait for it to finish (about 3 mins for me)

15. When it launches Acrobat, highlight the tab ""Help""--> highlight ""Activate"" and choose ""Activate by other means"" or sth like that... (Those who can't see this options, but instead boxes to fill the code must have been installing the TRIAL as opposed in step 8--if you did, run the installer again and choose ""remove"". Then repeat what you did but choose FULL not TRIAL)

16. Then you choose ""Activate by Phone"". You will see the one of your serial and also the Activation code (containing 28 digits)

17. Copy-paste the Activation code into the empty space under ""Generate Serial"" button of the keygen and click the ""Activate"" button in the lower-left corner of the window.

18. It should now give you yet another 24-digit code WITHOUT any dashes/hypens/whateveryouwanttocallit

19. Enter the numbers (I don't think you can copy-paste the whole code) in the Acrobat page (step 16) and click ""Activate""--It should work. If it doesn't you must have been very sleepy and entered a wrong number(s) in those box(es).

20. That's it. You will be prompted to register afterwards--but it's up to you since it's not really necessary.

AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED. Happy Pirating."
,snoopy9,2011-08-16T11:38Z,"Keygen seemed to work, I got to the end of the installation, and it gave me a message about ""cannot find adobe(something-something).dll on windows vista cd, please provide path to file.
