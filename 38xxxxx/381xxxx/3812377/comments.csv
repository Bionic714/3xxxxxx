this will help with installing it if you are having trouble"
,StikkyB,2007-09-22T12:47Z,"Cheers rawvik.
I didnt really wanna install without a serial number but that worked ;)"
,ajemeister,2007-09-24T08:40Z,"well if you burn it to a cd or explore the ISO theres a folder called ~*~*SERIAL*~*~ with cd serials in a text file.

i don't know why it brings up divX but its microsoft office.. did you try burning to a dvd and then installing from there?"
,johnny-7,2007-09-24T20:25Z,"Guys , is this the english version of OFFICE 2007 or it's in another language ??"
,mtl4life098,2007-09-26T21:33Z,"I downloaded it and when i try to open the setup.exe file i get this message: ""Setup cannot find the required setup controller file. Either there was a network error, an error reading from the CD, DVD, or other installation media, or a problem with the package you downloaded.""

Any ideas?"
,Zetareticuli,2007-09-27T01:33Z,"F:\~*~*SERIAL*~*~ is not accessible.

The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

Didn't work for me."
,ajemeister,2007-09-28T07:02Z,i used magicISO to compress the file.. you can use that to explore the cd and it should work...
,AlBa-DaVo,2007-09-29T19:33Z,Thnxxx mann
,ajemeister,2007-10-04T17:33Z,"sorry it took me so long to get back to you..

so here's the scoop.. i currently am not running office 2007, mostly because i dont like the new-gen applications and prefer to run ms office 2003. About the CD... my college has a network drive dedicated to just applications and didnt realize students can copy programs off it :) . so i figured i'd share it online.. i'd assume it would have to be valid, if there's a piece of the file i'm missing maybe you can fill me in and i can recreate this.. i have like 7 serials, but noticed when i burnt to DVD that the serials no longer showed up in the folder specified... let me know more please."
,ajemeister,2007-10-04T17:34Z,"sorry.. and heres 5 of the serials..

,Mada666,2007-11-13T09:09Z,"Dude, you are a life saver....I already had microsoft office student edition 2007 on my computer. But it was a trial version. All I did was copy and paste that little key you provided, and bam...I have microsoft office now. Thx!!!!"
