,baduin,2010-11-27T21:30Z,"A surprisingly witty movie, with perfect acting by Vincent Price. The doctor is a monstrous murder, but the viewer sympathises with him, perhaps because he considers it to be a justified revenge, but mostly because of his dignified behaviour.

No problems with the download or the file."
,Hexen-NI,2011-06-08T02:49Z,"The music at the start of the film (that Dr Phibes plays on the organ) is called ""War March Of The Priests, by Felix Mendelssohn"".

Complete ALL STAR CAST movie."
