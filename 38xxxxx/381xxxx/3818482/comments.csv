,barnettbeans,2008-02-06T14:06Z,"If you follow the directions you shouldnt have a problem however there is a slight change i would make. once you have the aw.dat file saved with your ethernet address simply drag it over the kegen and a command prompt will flash. Thats all you have to do now start maya.

thanks for the upload does anyone know if endorphin plugs are available anywhere?"
,friend55,2008-03-20T05:04Z,"If your ethernet address is FFFFFFFF, Maya license will not install.

I tried for ages on a machine with no internet connection.......so my host id/ethernet address was FFFFFFFF.

I finally installed the ASUS wifi driver, chose not to set up the network so it remains unconnected to the net...... and my ethernet address/host id changed to the alpha num.

Maya now works."
,vinc3nt1n0,2008-03-21T21:15Z,"Ok friends this trick is for who have the FFFFFF address (like me :P)

Install vmware server
http://register.vmware.com/content/download.html
When vmare askes serial number click on skip button...and that's it!
Now if you go on Autodesk-->common utilities-->FlexLM license utilities you'll see a new ethernet address.

So now you can follow the cracking-guide posted some thread ago!

Thank you! After paying for school, this wasn't an option to try and buy the program in time to start out on my own."
,twistedrevolution,2008-06-07T18:25Z,"Ok I had issues getting th crack to work. But finaly got it to work. Heres my solution to the issues I had.

So number 1 the Address: If you have more than one type of connection on your computer, like LAN and Wireless, in this sction there will be multiple numbers seperated by a space. make sure to only use one of the numbers before the space or after the space. 

Second resolove, rather than useing the run facility, just drag and drop AW.dat onto of the awkeygen.exe after you have edited it.

Next issue, can't see a dat file when trying to register it? Make sure you make it see ALL files in the licenceing tool, then slelect the visable option, it's not the dat file you use to install the licence. well this was for me anyway.

If your getting an issue saving the aw.dat with your address I found I had to put it on the desktop the orginal aw.dat then edit it and save it into the flexlm folder. 

I must say most of the issues I've had seem to be VISTA based, on XP it's a lot smoother. 

anyway I hope this helps some of you."

,mwmerz,2008-07-18T22:24Z,"I know instructions have been pasted for this over and over.  Some work for some people, not for others.  The following is my step by step process i used to get it working in Mac OSX Leopard 10.5.3.  If you can adapt it for yourself, awesome.  If not, i tried.

All of these steps are AFTER you run the installer from the dmg

- [ ] Step 1 - Run terminal
    - [ ] On your mac, use spotlight to run the ""terminal"" application
    - [ ] Alternatively, you can go to Applications/Utilities/Terminal
          to find it
- [ ] Step 2 - Get MAC Addy
    - [ ] Type the following command into terminal then hit enter:
        - [ ] ifconfig en0 | grep ether
    - [ ] You should see something like this:
        - [ ] ether 00:11:ff:0e:a9:32
    - [ ] Copy everything after ether
        - [ ] 00:11:ff:0e:a9:32
    - [ ] Remove all of the colons (:)
        - [ ] 0011ff0ea932
- [ ] Step 3 - Edit Aw.Dat
    - [ ] Where it says pastenetaddress (or your host here) paste the
          final number form step 2 (after ether, with no colons).
    - [ ] it should read:
        - [ ] HOSTID=0011ff0ea932
- [ ] Step 4 - Run aw.dat through the awkeygen.exe
    - [ ] Copy aw.dat and awkeygen.exe to a flash drive
    - [ ] connect the flash drive to a windows computer
    - [ ] drag aw.dat onto the awkeygen.exe application
        - [ ] If you are familiar with DOS, you can alternatively open a command prompt
        - [ ] go to the location of awkeygen.exe (typically f:\ for
              your flash drive)
        - [ ] type awkeygen.exe aw.dat and press enter
    - [ ] It will not give a confirmation for success
- [ ] Step 5 - Copy aw.dat to /var/flexlm
    - [ ] Bring your flash drive back to your mac
    - [ ] Click on your desktop (or any finder window)
    - [ ] click Go (on the toolbar) -> Go to folder
    - [ ] type /var/ and press go
    - [ ] this should bring up a window with various folders that may be
          unfamiliar to you
    - [ ] create a new folder in /var and name it flexlm
    - [ ] copy the aw.dat file from your flash drive to the flexlm
          folder
    - [ ] You are done!"

I said ""installer from the dmg"", it is not a dmg, it's an iso.

When i created the quick steps, i used omnioutliner and just copy/pasted.  should have had indentation, but it should still easily be read."

,sabbabk,2008-11-16T16:58Z,"1.  First Create a directory on the c: drive (even if you install maya on different drive) called
    FLEXLM
2.  Copy the aw.dat and awkeygen.exe file to this directory.
3.  Install Maya
4.  Goto start-->all programs-->Autodesk-->common utilities-->FlexLM license utilities
5.  Under system settings copy Ethernet address (without quotes)
6.  Open the file (from the directory FLEXLM) aw.dat with Wordpad and replace the words ""your host""
    with the copied Ethernet address. Save and close wordpad
7.  Using the run utility and type: awkeygen.exe aw.dat
8.  Goto start-->all programs-->Autodesk-->Maya 2009-->Licensing

9.  Browse to the path of the file aw.dat
10. Click install
11. Restart computer
