Judging from the number of downloads and, more importantly, the number of seeders, there isn't much interest in my "Choices". I have therefore decided that this will be my last. My apologies to the people who did download and seed.
I refer those people to Shankly's Mixtapes and/or Spinner.com for an excellent alternative, although I can safely assume that they already know of the existance.
