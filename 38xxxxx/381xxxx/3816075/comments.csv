PLZ :D:D:D:D:D"
,pbVeteran,2009-01-12T14:17Z,"You just need to put it to ""ms0://ISO"" folder on your PSP if you do not have it just create it [*.cso format is treated as iso in psp just DONT put it into any folder only plain file in ISO folder is enough]

Other way is to have UMD burner but using a MS is better in my opinion

Btw if you dont have a custom fw PSP you cant use it of course :)"
