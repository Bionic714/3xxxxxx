,Tippin,2007-09-24T19:33Z,for god sake?  is every picture packed one and one?
,Brad3514,2007-09-24T19:42Z,more padding files? 
,twatley,2007-09-24T19:45Z,"Each set was packed into a rar file.
I originally made the torrent with the individual files and the torrent file itself was 2.5M which kept timing out to upload. The torrent even now is 380k.
I'm going home. I'm uploading to a server here so I can leave it seeding from work and I'll seed from home as I have 20M upload from work but only 1M from home ;-)"
,framitz,2007-09-28T01:39Z,"Twatley,
This sounds interesting and I started to download it, but with so many RAR files it is just not worth the trouble.

If the torrent containing the actual files is too big, try RARing them into a single archive for easier extraction.  I bet it will be more popular.

Thanks for the effor though."
,twatley,2007-10-02T18:18Z,i use winrar and you can exxtract them all easily with it.
