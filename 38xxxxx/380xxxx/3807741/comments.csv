,D@rk @cid,2007-09-15T23:08Z,Thank you veru much!
,kukenifitta,2007-09-16T10:38Z,"Cool upload, Credington.

The book is absolutely awesome. It was filmed in the 60s as ""The last man on earth"" and follows the book much closer than ""The omega man"". 
The remake with Will Smith later this year seems to be a rape of the book, though."

I didn't realise it was being remade. Good timing. This has always been a favourite of mine and when my brother said he had the DVD......; )"

Thanks man!  Have I ever been looking for this flick?? I saw it as a kid in the States and it scared the shit out of me. I must confess it still creeped me out when his dead wife came back.

,faheyd,2009-08-02T21:50Z,"Use DVD Shrink or Decrypter to strip the region codes if any.

I had the avi and it was in single audio channel. I downloaded this one, and imagine my surprise, the movie was release in MONO audio. "
