,ST205lvr,2007-11-12T00:11Z,THANK YOU!!!!! Thank you for putting up this torrent. I have been searching for this movie for a looong time. If you'll keep this torrent going long enough for me to get it I'll keep seeding it for at least a month I swear. Just please keep it active long enough for me to get it from you. ~PLUR

,coco_lea,2009-01-10T02:24Z,can't seem to open the movie. i have all the codecs but not working..says cannot render the file. can any1 help?
,Lyuking,2009-04-10T16:33Z,"There's something wrong with audio... counter runs too fast (like 2x speeded), audio plays too fast too.

I tried to decrease speed in MPC, but all I got is awful audio desync (for about 20 secs)...

Should I try another torrent (pure DVD, 7 Gb)? 

Found it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4520595/Groove_-_Mundo_Rave_(2000)_Full_DVD

But it has only ONE SEEDER :(((("

,FearTheUndead,2010-01-13T02:08Z,"Thank you for this upload. I saw this many years ago & am glad I found it again. It brings back so many memories of a wonderful time. I almost wanna cry when the last record is spun. 

PLUR to everyone I met then & to those who get what I'm saying now. If you don't understand; then I guess you just had to be there... "
