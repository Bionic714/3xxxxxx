,Ears14U,2011-10-16T20:29Z,"Keygen is screwed, and my damn original has way too much Starforce protection to run on a dual core windows 7 64bit. So Don't worry all, I hope the hell I help someone else that's struggled so much finding a serial for a ""cracked"" install. So this is my original game serial for you. HA! The finger to Techland and their starforce crap! Enjoy!
XR-WFP97-RXPXY-KK9P9-RRA4T-TXPEK -> original XR Xpand Rally #
XRX-F3TPE-XYAKY-ECKF3-ATFWK-R7WEC -> XR Xpand Rally Xtreme # "

Great game, animals around the road, the driver can be killed or injured. Try out the 3 night stages at Moonlight challenge. Only the car names are not real."

,MortenSilt,2012-07-01T10:51Z,"I installed the game, found a working serial key from the internet, pasted all the crack files into the game main directory but when i try to start from xrx.exe it says 'Couldn't locate jvm.dll! Check if you have JRE in oyur directory'' after that i downloaded the jvm.dll file and put it in C:/Windows/System but the problem didn't go away. 
I am usin Win7 64b, anyone know what to do? I'll try reinstalling."
