,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-09-13T18:33Z,"I'll be seeding this for a while.  I also want to mention that you can install all of the packs (Enterprise, Viso, and Expression Web) without any problems, and can do updates from Microsoft and Office updates, but you can't do updates that require you to pass ""Genuine Validation"" unless you uninstall Viso and Project and use the registry entity pack I include in the torrent."
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-09-13T20:31Z,Seeding and/or thanks will be appreciated. ;)
,paluka55,2007-09-16T19:56Z,"Two thumbs up. Despite 30 hour download on my crappy cable bandwidth, it's now up and running on my Vista Home Premium. Used MagicISO to extract file to a new folder for install, DVD burn was not required. AVG 7.5 detects no virus. Just completed a Windows Update. No problems. Thanks."
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-09-17T01:23Z,"You're welcome, I made this torrent with quality in mind."
,gayasura,2007-09-18T03:15Z,"Hey can I write this image file to a CD.
I ask this question because the size of this file is 1.1 GiB."
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-09-18T16:37Z,"If you wish to write it to a CD, you have to write it to a DVD-RW, since CDs only have 700MB of free space."
,meesmujalt,2007-09-18T18:52Z,"working exellent,thx Dragon."
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-09-19T06:23Z,"meesmujalt -- Of course.  Glad if worked for you.

gayasura -- It must be a DVD-R or DVD-RW since CDs have only 700MB of capacity, while a DVD can hold 10GB.  I recommend a DVD-RW so you don't waste the 8 or so gigabytes you don't use on the disk."
,en1285,2007-09-26T08:09Z,can someone walk me through how to install this im new to ico
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-09-27T17:02Z,"All you have to do is get the program MagicISO from this site, and install the optional program MagicDisk."
,d2mac60,2007-09-27T20:39Z,A DVD holds 4.7GB not 10GB Nitemare Dragon
,Torrentmaster22,2007-09-28T05:31Z,"Alright, I can't figure out what's going on here. I downloaded the torrent fine, used magic iso to extract the file to a folder on my desktop and an Icon labled ""launcher"" appeared. However, when i open the application it says 

""error install files not found""

Anyone care to comment? (I'd appreciate it)"
,2headedboy,2007-09-28T16:28Z,"Like a charm!!

Nitemare_Dragon, you are on my favorite person list for at least a month! Thank you kindly for your work."
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-09-28T21:20Z,"d2mac60-  True, but I was referring to another type of DVD that can hold (my mistake) 9GB.

Torrentmaster22-  I don't know what to say, I never tried to extract it, I simply mounted the image with MagicDisk.  Try double-clicking the Autorun file instead of the launcher.

2headedboy-  Lol, thank you."
,romeoboy,2007-09-30T18:55Z,"I installed this on Vista Ultimate. Seems to work ok except for the fact that it keeps asking for a serial number even after I did the registry thing. All I did was install office without a serial since it lets you, and then installed the reg edit file. Now everytime I open a program it wants a key, but lets me skip input and continue to the program if I want. Is there a way to stop it from asking?"
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-10-03T04:02Z,You have to add the serial to keep it from doing that.
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-10-03T04:04Z,"Trust me, the Registry entity will overwrite the CD key, but it has to be in there to start with.  If the issue still remains, then the problem is Vista, not the torrent."
,b303487,2007-10-03T22:15Z,"romeoboy:  I didn't burn mine onto a CD either. When I installed Office Enterprise, I was also asked for a serial key. I found something on another torrent file which seems to have done the trick:

Keygen1: F3DJD-6FFQ4-XQTQF-PGK47-8MDQ8
Keygen2: CM9R7-9X4DV-F43J4-JVC67-GYDQ8

maybe this will work? "
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-10-04T00:07Z,"As long as there is a CD key that the program accepts when you install it, it shouldn't matter what key you enter in.  I do have keys that I know for sure work in a text file within the ISO image."
,Heero14,2007-10-04T00:57Z,"The thing is that it's not true that it enters a serial by itself while you install, or at least it doesn't work. You have to write one of the serials from the ReadMe file yourself. That's what I did, and then I did the registry thing, and I've never had any problem, works like a charm."
,Dodge34,2007-10-04T15:19Z,"The problem with the new Office 2007, it get rid of every part of the other Office suite (the menu bar is not there anymore, no file, no view, nothing) so its perfect for the new users who just bough their first computer, but its a nightmare for a long time Office user like me, so just be warned, if you used Office before, consider keeping the 2003 edition if you don't want to re learn everything you know about Office from scratch."
,bigballss,2007-10-04T15:32Z,"Hey,  I am new to this whole thing.  I was wondering how could I open a .rar and .uif do I need MagicISO to open these files?"
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-10-04T17:28Z,"Heero14-  The launcher Application will enter the serial by chance...sometimes it doesn't work.

Dodge34: Yes, there is an option to leave the old Office on there.  There is no menu bar, like you said.  If you click the shiny new Office Button, that's where all of the menu stuff is.  And if it's not in the Office Button menu, then it's in the ribbon below the button.  It took me a little bit to figure out the new features, but once I got it down I love the layout.  I will never go back to the old Word again.

bigballss:  The rar file you unpack with a program such as WinZip, while the ISO or UIF file you use MagicIso or MagicDisk."

,Scullyy,2007-10-05T17:33Z,Nice! Just what I've been looking for. Downloading now.
,Scullyy,2007-10-05T19:32Z,Mine doesn't work. It says it can't find the installer files. And that magiciso program can't make it into ISO file because it's only the trial version...
,Griskotten,2007-10-06T02:49Z,Thx MAte
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-10-06T05:46Z,"Scullyy:  You can easily get a serial from this site, a keygen (don't recommend unless you have a Trojan scanning tool to use afterwards) or from a serial website.  Google ""MagicISO version (your version here) registration key.""

Try running the Enterprise installer manually.  Double-click Enterprise inside the UIF image

Griskotten:  You're welcome. ;)"

,HenkusFilijokus,2007-10-08T11:20Z,"I can´t seem to install this (or any other distribution) on my Vista setups. Could someone please give me a hint?

The computers are running Vista Home Basic and give me the error messege ""X:\Enterprise.WW\oinstall.dll could not be found or is not valid""(or something similar) every time. Oinstall.dll is clearly there. The same thing happens with every distribution I´ve tried, as well as with the Office 2003 wich I use on several XP machines. There was no problem a while back when I installed 2007 on my brothers Vista Home Premium-laptop.

I haven´t been able to find a resolution anywhere and I´m actually quite clueless as for what to do, please help!"
,Kyfus,2007-10-10T13:51Z,"When I have extracted the file with MagicISO, which seems to be the only thing you can do with MagicISO... I get a folder with lots of files ...

When I then click on the launcher and all goes fine, the installation starts etc. But in middle of installation a window pops up saying """"! The files that they need are in there somewhere, but it doesn't work. 

Some here say it works if you just mount it as an ISO instead of extracting it .. how do you do that? MagicDisk? is that a part of MagicIso? I dont get it.

Help please"
,Kyfus,2007-10-10T13:54Z,"EDIT: 
Ah forgot to write what it says .. something like ""Enterprise.WW\enter.something.. could not be found or is not valid something, lol.

Once again, how does MagicDisk work? I need somethjing as easy as daemon tools tho .. magic iso is so much more diffacult."
,Nitemare_Dragon,2007-10-12T04:54Z,"MagicDisk is very easy to use, and all it ever shows is a tray icon.  Right click the tray icon and a very simple-to-use menu appears that will get you mounting ISO, NRG, BIN/CUE, UIF, and more running quickly."

Fair enough I thought, downloaded MagicDISC and tried mounting the file instead but installs stalls once more and says it cant find a 'proof' cab file which is there too. Any suggestions?

"
,Nitemare_Dragon,2009-05-03T18:19Z,Those that are having troubles obviously didn't read the instructions. DO NOT EVER run any regkey before you install. NEVER..you run it after you install the program. I have installed this on 23 computers and it has always worked. Pay attention to what you're doing and read the instructions or you'll end up pulling your hair out.
,GreyHaven1,2010-04-26T08:38Z,"Downloading now, around 120 kb/s. It seems certain users do not have the ability to follow instructions... I don't want to speak too soon, but I have made installs of this nature plenty of times before. If they are so unhappy, perhaps they should just buy the software, know something about computers, or learn how to follow directions. Noobs..."
,nkmk,2010-05-19T06:49Z,"Thank you so much! Works great!
For those of you having problems do this:
1.)Download this file
2.)Go to control panel and uninstall microsoft office if a demo version is installed
3.)Mount the  UIF file using MagicISO (google it, the top one on there website works for Windows 7)
4.)Install Microsoft enterprise, and you have all your programs!
5.) Go to the make office genuine folder and click on the ""office"" option, and hit yes.

You should be working and each program should not ask for key, if it does, instead of auto running the UIF file open it and in the read me section under enterprise it will have 1 working key.

There you go!

Hope I helped."
