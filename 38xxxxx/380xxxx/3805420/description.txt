Note, this Second Edition DOES NOT make any changes to Office 2007 (see below).

This is a full version of Microsoft Office 2007 (US English Only) packed into a CD image (.uif) containing:
* Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007
    - Access 2007
    - Excel 2007
    - Groove 2007
    - InfoPath 2007
    - OneNote 2007
    - Outlook 2007
    - PowerPoint 2007
    - Publisher 2007
    - Word 2007
^ Microsoft Office Visio Professional 2007
^ Microsoft Office Project 2007
^ Microsoft Expression Web (new FrontPage)

*  The "Make Office Genuine" Registry Entities only works for Office Enterprise.
^ You will not be able to do Genuine Updates from Office Update if Viso, Project, or Frontpage are installed.

The serials are written in by the launcher application, if there are problems they're also in the readme file inside the CD image.
All the products don't need activation, therefore you do not need a keygen, this is not a trial, it lasts forever.
Windows Update does work with this Microsoft Office 2007, but if you want to do "Genuine Office Updates," you need to use the Registry Pack for Office 2007 to make Office truly genuine.
