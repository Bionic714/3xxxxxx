,jonarni,2007-10-16T11:17Z,Dosn`t  work. cptrackerx.exe won`t start.
,Rickz2,2007-10-16T19:41Z,"Yeah, it doesnÂ´t work. The Tracker cannot connect to fsx :-((

DO NOT download...."
,alex06ze,2007-10-24T18:23Z,"3. Flight Simulator X only: Software changes due to FSX compatibility.
Operation of the Cargo Pilot software has not changed - with one main exception.
The Cargo Pilot Tracker (=the program which is monitoring your flight) now is fully automised and is integrated into the Cargo Pilot Launcher (the program which starts FS and restarts Cargo Pilot after ending FS).
Automatic FS start:
You must have selected the option ""Start Flight Simulator automatically"" on the Cargo Pilot ""Options"" page.
After clicking on ""Fly Now"" on the Cargo Pilot briefing screen, the Launcher/Tracker will start. It will also start Flight Simulator and will try to establish a connection to it.
In case of any errors or problems the Tracker/Launcher will display a message. In this case please try to deetemine the problem or contact tech support.
As opposed to the Flight Simulator 9 tracker you do not need to manually start the tracker.
Always leave the tracker running the the background!
When you flight has ended the tracker will display the message ""Flight Completed"".
Shut down Flight Simulator X. The tracker will end itself and will start Cargo Pilot.
Manual FS start:
You must have deselected the option ""Start Flight Simulator automatically"" on the Cargo Pilot ""Options"" page.
After clicking on ""Fly Now"" on the Cargo Pilot briefing screen, you will see a message, prompting you to exit Cargo Pilot and launch Flight Simulator manually.
- Exit Cargo Pilot.
- Launch the Tracker:
Browse for the folder [FSX]\CargoPilot\Presets\FSLauncher
and start the program
CPTrackerX.exe
The Tracker now will try to establish a connection with Flight Simulator X.
- Start Flight Simulator X.
- Load the Cargo Pilot flight: On the FSX main screen select ""Free Flight-Load"", then from the list select the ""Cargo Pilot flight"".
Always leave the tracker running the the background!
When you flight has ended the tracker will display the message ""Flight Completed"".

,tazzharm,2008-03-05T20:20Z,"well. after a few nasty words to myself I finally got it to work..so for those who can't get it , it will work only thing is yes you start with just enough to buy plane and very small airport park but it does work.
would be nice if we could find a money trainer or cheat .
follow alex06ze instructions ( very knowledgable )
If anyone knows about cheats and or if you can see ground crews loading/unloading let us know 
thanks allot for the upload 
I will keep this seeding ."
,tazzharm,2008-03-20T00:32Z,"hey 
well its not a money cheat but just a way to make your flights faster
once you've chosen a job fly now as normal
then once you've reached the air click your map and drag your plane over the map to your airport you are landing in and click ok.
it will auto land your plane on the runway and then you can taxi to parking or gates once you communicate with ground and then exit as normal.
again this isn't a cheat but it will cut your flying time to about five minutes so you can make faster flights.
hope it helps."
,bl4ze428,2008-06-25T21:45Z,"i am trying out on Flight Simulator X and i will leave feedback soon, hopefully good."

,Steudl4,2012-04-14T10:47Z,"Found a way to cheat more money.  Description below.

1. Go to CargoPilotProfiles

2. Choose which profile you want , make a backup copy of it.

3. Boot up CP.

4. Sell your Aircraft, and close any bases you have.

5. Exit CP

6. go into the back up folder, copy the Airports.dat and Aircraft.dat files.

7. Go back into CP.

You now have your AC, Bases and Money.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat as wanted."
