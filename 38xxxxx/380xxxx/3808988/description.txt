Synopsis: During World War II, a group of G.I.s are thrown together in the notorious German prison camp Stalag 17. For the most part, they spend their time scheming ways to help each other escape.

William Holden was awarded an Oscar for his performance as a cynical, sharp-tongued soldier who spends his time scheming up rackets and trading with the Germans for special privileges...
