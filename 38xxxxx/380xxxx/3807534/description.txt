Delve into the rituals that mark the passage from one phase of life to another - where pain is the price of acceptance and failure means a loss of pride and sometimes even a loss of life. 
NGC takes viewers to Australia, where members of an urban subculture are pierced through their skin with giant stainless steel fishing hooks and hang suspended from the ceiling. 
Then, deep in the Amazon jungle of Brazil, teenage boys thrust their hands inside specially woven gloves filled with hundreds of giant stinging bullet ants. And they repeat the excruciating ritual 19 more times in order to become men. 
Finally, in Papua New Guinea, see how boys endure swallowing about 24 inches of raw cane down their throat to the pit of their stomach so they can symbolically die as boys and be reborn as men.
