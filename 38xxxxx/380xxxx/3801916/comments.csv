,grantypantyy,2008-02-17T07:43Z,How does this file work exactly? Please explain it to me like you would a six year old girl.
,Twiztid,2008-04-04T01:25Z,google ePSXe and download that emu...and the bios and plugins can be found by a torrent...just search
,BabelonKing,2008-04-19T13:49Z,"Before I decide to download this, I would like to know if the format is ISO or BIN? Anything else doesn't work with ePSXe. Since you put the file in a .RAR archive, it's a waste of time to download if I don't know what the format is?! And just FYI, I've seen this exact same torrent uploaded on Mininova, with a different uploader. Just a thought... could you be the same person, only with a different uploader name?"
,xISOAPIx,2008-10-01T05:59Z,"alright, so everything downloaded beautifully,
i go to  epsxe, run iso. then it kinda goes black like normally but then just sits there, the whole screen freezes. any help with this>?"
,xISOAPIx,2008-10-01T06:00Z,you can change the file into an iso. file if you want for your emu.
,xISOAPIx,2008-10-03T07:27Z,"alright, i tried to follow the instructions in the read.me file as best as i could, but i'm fucking something up.
can someone help me out here and explain it to me, very nicely 
thanks :D"
