Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rocks again!
Good news: i finished (finally!) my SubRip modification for correct TTXT subtitle
ripping. Now all subtitles (in this release) are properly positioned and colored
(well, they are originally white, so no changes here actually). Also i changed
default font from Arial to Arial Unicode MS (now you could see \'2/8 notes\'
characters in the inro song subtitles!).      
Also, Russian tracks in this release are 100% dubbed (overral quality is better
than 2nd season). It\'s a shame that translation itself is...well...far from
perfect. And last (but not least) - slight changes in deinterlacing procedures.
As you probably know, Telecide() can\'t always detect interlaced frames properly
and could either deinterlace normal (not interlaced) frame, or do not deinterlace
interlaced frame. Both are bad. But for my taste later is less noticeable than
first, so i tweaked parameters accordingly. Because of this you may see some
frames (with small motion) not deinterlaced, but there will be less improperly
deinterlaced frames (usually they look like someone been chewing all horizontal
and diagonal lines).
Bad news: only some (less than 50%) episodes features subtitles. Because there is
no subtitles on the DVD.

I\'m planning to rip 4th season soon, so stay tuned!
However, future of 5th (AKA Lost Season) is dark and murky. I do have access to
5th season DVDs, but there is no Russian audio for it at the moment, and
Ninja Tribunal episode is nowhere to be found.

To rickw512: thanks for nothing. You delayed me,but you can\'t stop me, mwa-ha-ha!
