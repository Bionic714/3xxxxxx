,LRN,2007-11-02T00:03Z,I am looking for someone to seed this torrent permanently instead of me. If you're up to that - post a comment here. I am planning to stop seeding in a week or two.
,sirtgus,2007-11-05T22:51Z,If you can leave it seeding long enough for me to get both season 3 and 4 then I will be able to seed them both for a long time. I normally don't take things off of my seeding list for a month or two.
,LRN,2007-11-07T06:14Z,"While ""month or two"" is not very long from my point of view, it's still better than nothing, so - thank you. Post here after you complete both seasons."

,LRN,2008-11-30T02:56Z,"xziqt, English, please."
