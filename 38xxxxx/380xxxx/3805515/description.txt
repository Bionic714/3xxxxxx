From Wikipedia:

Clean, Shaven is a 1994 film directed by Lodge Kerrigan.

In this raw and disturbing film, Peter Winter (played by Peter Greene) is a schizophrenic man desperately trying to get his daughter back from her adoptive mother. The film is an auditory nightmare and one which tries to objectively view schizophrenia and those who are affected by it.

It is a piece attempting to allow the audience to explore their own reservations and prejudices about people with mental illness.
