,Raul_Anakin,2007-09-19T17:02Z,"Just burn it with Nero and play it in any DVD-player, or mount it with MagicISO and then watch it in your computer. Almost any DVD-program works. Like the one u get when installing Nero for example."

Blir skit ändå går ej att se spelarna tar den ej"

,ikkyrulz,2007-10-10T09:51Z,Please seed this....... thanx raul for n excellent find. Also thanx mod for an excellent site
,torrent696,2007-11-18T19:55Z,"hi raul,
i dont have nero and am on mac. how would i make your UIF file work? i have never seen such a file ending...quicktime does not know what to do with it...toast neither.."
,Raul_Anakin,2007-11-21T19:49Z,"Sorry mate! I'm not good with Mac. Just google for answers and/or try putting out a question in some suitable forum.

The reason i chose UIF is cause NERO always suggest me to use that instead of ISO. Supposedly it is better, i guess. But, I will not do that again. Promise."
,o0_Tef_0o,2008-02-01T06:24Z,Difficult to decompress ... but worth the effort thx :D
,torrent696,2008-04-06T21:51Z,"whats this dvd called, i wanna find it somewhere else...but need a complete title to seacrch it ? your uif file from nero sucks, since its not playablele and burnable but only on nero, my friend. you should have done an iso file or divx.
