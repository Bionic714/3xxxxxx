Abolish the state!"
,BloodLogic,2007-09-17T22:50Z,"It looks like there are 15 leechers or so, with 42% of the torrent already shared and easily available.  I'm fighting for bandwidth, as I don't use my own line for upping stuff, so please be patient.  Just like all my torrents (click my name), I'll always seed until there are plenty of seeders.  PEACE!"
,tlittle,2007-12-24T18:22Z,"Wow, this is awesome!  Holy shit.  Thank you Bloodlogic.  It's damn near impossible to find this show otherwise.  Word up."

,LadyAmbar,2008-05-24T07:41Z,"OH, hell yeah!  Thanks, Blood.  A big smacking kiss for you, man!"
