,Vrekarn,2008-02-21T00:55Z,Why dont you have the second season just season one and three??
,cptnwinky,2008-06-04T17:24Z,Once I finally get the whole thing from the original seeder (more bandwidth available to this torrent would be nice) I will leave it seeding till at least a ratio of 10:1. I've been downloading this for over a week now so hopefully I can help others not have that same problem.
,cptnwinky,2008-06-04T23:02Z,"Thanks, I got it and almost the rest of episodes 2-5. If you can get the rest of this season I would help you seed it, I have an ultra fast fiber connection.

Since I'm in the US I can't seem to watch it on iTV2 (they only allow UK IP's) and I don't know where else to get it.
