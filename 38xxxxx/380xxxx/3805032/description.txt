VERIFIED: The installer searches / prompts for a valid FSX installation. In an event where it doesn't find a valid FSX installation, the installer quits. This makes it impossible (yet) to use it with FS2004. I don't have FSX installed, so have seen the installer quit. I am sure it would work with FSX installed.


** It would be great (for me and all other FS9 simmers) if somebody on TPB manages to upload the RIP and maybe also include instructions on using it with FS2004. **
