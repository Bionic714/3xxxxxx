Thanks anyway for sharing it."
,Tantalos,2007-09-13T13:52Z,"For FS9, try Nick's Lightfix as an alternative. It's freeware, and really impressive."

,NoFlyZone,2007-09-15T06:35Z,"Hi guys, I had the issue where it wouldn't install into FSX too. So I tried copying the setup file directly into the FSX install directory and ran it from there.
It worked first time.
Cheers"

,rogue_can,2007-11-25T14:51Z,"It works well in  FSX , however it wont work with FS2004 .

You also have to manualy add in a line in the aircraft.cfg file , if you want these ( very nice I might add ) lights...it will add em , to default planes but not to add ons , hence the extra line of text in the cfg file.
