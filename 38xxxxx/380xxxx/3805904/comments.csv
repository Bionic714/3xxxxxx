,RCBEG,2007-10-06T15:30Z,"Why not adding Portuguese subs?
Almost 200 million speak and write this language in the world (Just in Brazil...140 million...)... but people donÂ´t care...
thatÂ´s why : 1 seeder....2 leechers..."
,punxrus,2008-04-29T06:03Z,A bunch of us are stuck at 64%... so if you could seed it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
,Zinedin,2008-05-04T11:54Z,"I am stuck at 96.9%. Please seed?! I can't believe there is only 1 seeder on this one. This is really a great TV show. Maybe it's because of the size of this release... I personally like better DVD 1:1 copies with menus and all the extras than DVD ripp offs as AVI and MPEG files. Once I get this, I promise to seed it for at least next 6 months. Too bad there is no Season 3 of this release series.

Please seed! Thanks in advance."
