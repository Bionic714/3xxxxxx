,arcnet,2007-09-15T18:02Z,"Somehow messed up the info here on piratebay:

Hi, I was missing the x64 Version of Kerio Winroute Firewall on Piratebay, so I decided to make my first torrent.
Installer is from kerio.com, keygen/crack from keygen.us by Team Linezero (nfo File included - see ""keygen by Lz0.nfo"") - Just in case a new version is released and not cracked soon enough ;-)

For a step-by-step tutorial read arcnet.nfo"

Explain why there is suspicious Trojan/Worms in your keygen.exe?"

,arcnet,2010-01-25T20:20Z,"Xillion, sorry that I see this so ""late"" (afer there were some seeds I didn't bother checking here again), but in case someone else thinks I'd somehow distribute virii:
As I said the keygen was from keygen.us (without me changing it), and I only scanned it using uptodate AntiVir - which reported no virii.

But the crack was a filepatcher (if I remember correct), and so maybe some of the antivirus heuristics just thought it *might* be a virus.

*If* I wanted to take over some computer, I could just abuse known security issues in webapplications and the like - there are enough servers out there. But I don't see any reason to do so."
