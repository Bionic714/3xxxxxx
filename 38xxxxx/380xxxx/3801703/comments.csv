,EvO91,2008-01-17T17:51Z,"for U700!

it works!

I've just cut and pasted the instructions on z edge's forums seeing as I can't seem to get a link to work... thanks to the guy who translated if from a german website and to others who figured out the extra steps (see my post immediately below for what they are!)....


First you need the â??Qualcomm USBâ? drivers and â??BitPimâ?. Prepare the USB cable, but dont put it in!

Driver: http://uploaded.to/?id=u8j08i
BitPim: http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitpim

a. Unpack the drivers to a folder (exp. Desktop), but donâ??t install it!
b. Install BitPim.


1. You must entering follow code: *#0523#
2. [9] common >> [6] USB Configuration >> [2] Qualcomm USB [*]
--> Qualcomm USB Configured.
Plz Reconnect the Cable.0

3. Now put the USB cable in the phone and Pc.
--> Windows found a new hardware.
Install the hardware manual and chose the Qualcommdriver folder.
Now go to the Hardware manger ->Modems->Qualcomm, you must know the port number.

4. Open â??BitPimâ? and configure the software for your u700.

Phone type: Other CDMA phone
Com port: *look at step 5*(you can Browse, but chose the right one!)

And press â??OKâ?

5. Start â??BitPimâ?, go to the menu â??Viewâ? and active â??View Filesystemâ?.

6. Klick on â??Filesystemâ? (left in BitPim).
Now can you see a blue folder, open the folder (press on â??+â?).
--> â?¦ retrieving 

7. Now put the games (jar and jad files) in the follow folder â??Gamesâ? (Media->Games).

8. Disconnect the USB cable from the phone.

9. Leave the Qualcomm menu and entering this code in your u700: *#6984125*#
Now are you in â??Admin settingâ? menu.

a. Select the menu [4] Internals (Master Key: *#9072641*#)
b. Chose the menu [7] Storage settings
c. Update media database, Update Java DB and Create AX Dat File.


That itâ??s!! (You can leave â??Admin settingâ?.)

Important: DONâ??T delete the games with the mobile phone, you must delete the games with â??BitPimâ?.

,LasseP88,2008-05-18T07:54Z,"Installing Java games for U600

Got a tip on another forum how to install Java apps and games without having to use WAP:

1. Transfer the .jad and .jar files to the phones memory to the 'Other Files' folder.
You can transfer the files from Samsung PC Studio's 'Phone Explorer', or just transfer it straight to the memory card and move it to 'Other Files' from the phone's menu.
If you don't have a .jad file, you can download 'Jad Maker' (google) and make a new one.

2. Exit all menus and type in this code: *#9998*4678255#.
You should now get a 'Activated' message. Java install is enabled.

3. Go to the 'Other Files' folder and select the .jad file (should be 1kb).
Press 'Options' (left touch key) and you should get a 'Do you want to install' question.
Press 'Yes' to install.

4. To deactivate Java install, simply type the same code again.
You should now get a 'Deactivated' message."

,bzzall,2008-07-19T11:55Z,can I Use for my Sgh-f480 Touchwiz? or where can I find some other games for it?
,{MUS}pig,2008-07-21T02:15Z,"Facts.
Most Samsung Phone doesn't allows you to copy *.Jar or *.Jad file onto the phone to play even tho it support java. It needs to be installed into the appropriate folder (which is hidden of course) on the phone (Not Memory Card). The folder is ""Games and more"".

What is JAR and JAD?
Jar is the java game its self. JAD? required for some older phone i think. old Samsung phone doesn't required JAD, so just IGNORE it!!

Here is the method I found working.

Step 1: Download some *.jar files
Obtain some 320 x 240 java game, usually *.jar + *.jad (2 files). If you can't file, you can download from here by subscribe and register to this website to download. 

http://www.ixphone.net/ Lots of Java Games, remember to get 320x240 version. Unfortunately you need to register then you can download.

Step 2: Upload the JAR to this web services. http://www.wap-upload.net/
I choose to upload to Samsung Java Games Public folder for easy sake. (no need to register lor).

Browse the JAR and upload it to the public folder. Select Samsung.

[edited]Found another services http://www.filetac.com/ 2MB upload limit

Step 3: Use your samsung phone and connect to the internet (IDEAS, or whatever, the top-right button key). Choose Option, number 9 (Enter URL)
Enter wap.wap-upload.net and wait for the page to load (I might be kinda slow, have patience)."
