Its Good Quality. Meaning if you don't care if there is a millisecond of a pop(which there isn't) . Even aXXo torrents are not exellent but GOOD quality. So if you think its bad, then everything is bad quality for you bitch.


I guess the bass isn't good. But the original is good. Very sorry if its bad. I just downloaded off of limewire. Its hard to find it now. And it takes 2-3 hours to download it off of limewire with high speed.

Again, next time i will do better. "

Masterpieces should be in full DVD quality sound, or Studio quality if you can get a hold of it. This isn't Soulja Boy. If you can't appreciate good sound quality, go listen to your 28kbps MP3s or MIDIs."

,Mulreay,2010-07-26T22:48Z,Good quality in my book as I just tweaked it slightly. Thanks for the upload I was looking for the full orchestra version. Very pleased.
