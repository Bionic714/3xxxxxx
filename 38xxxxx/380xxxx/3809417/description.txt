"Forced Entry" is a very low budget hard core rape/porn/horror which contains some of the nastiest and ugliest rape scenes ever filmed.Truly the rapes are filmed in hard core and are very uncompromising.In the film,the rapist played convincingly by Harry Reems makes the first victim to give him a blow job telling her that he won't torture her to death,too badly if she does as he says-she'll die anyway,but if she messes with him she'll suffer.He cuts her throat-the second victim is dragged from a shower to a bedroom,thrown on the bed and forced to give a blow job with a gun against her head.He then rapes her from behind and tells her "I didn't enjoy that..." and starts cutting her body with a knife and then stabs her in the breast.This murder scene is really nasty and cruel-not for the faint of heart.The dialogue is the worst aspect of the film:what he says is really dirty and unbelievable for example:"Is it starting to bleed in there a little hun?You don't know what bleedin' is do you,I'll show you some,I'm gonna' show you a lot of bleedin'!".Anyway,this film is extremely brutal and vulgar,I was really shocked and disturbed when I first saw this.Nothing is left to imagination,everything is shown in unflinching detail.I can't believe the fuss being made over "I Spit on Your Grave" when this film exists.Meir Zarchi's infamous video nasty is really tame in comparison to this one.Not a film for all tastes,but it pulls no punches with its sheer nastiness.Check it out,if you can handle it.
