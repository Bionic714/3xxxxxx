The year - 1602. Your future is uncertain as cities are overcrowded, and poverty and starvation abounds. You and a small band of fellow voyagers set sail for a new life and a new world.
   
 
Welcome to the ranks of explorers and pioneers where players decisions and abilities in areas such as colonization, diplomacy, production, trade and warfare, will determine the fate of the colony. 
Europe's best selling PC game of 1998, 1602 A.D. successfully combines real-time strategy, colonization, commerce, and land and sea battle elements into a complete and all-consuming gaming experience

Features: 

  Nearly 700 islands with differing landscapes
 
Dynamic artificial intelligence adjusts to player's skill level automatically; 5 tutorials guarantee easy entry into gameplay
 
Single Player mode offers a choice of seven campaigns, continuous play or more than 40 scenarios with pre-set missions
 
Multiplayer support for up to 4 players per network or 2 via modem including more than 30 unique multiplayer scenarios
 
  Direct 3D sound processing
 
  More than 90 different building types
 
  Real-time land and sea battles
 
  More than 30 unique trades
 
  Lavish 3D animations replace functions previously filled by statistics
 
  Cinematic quality animated interludes 

 

It is also possible to create network scenarios using the editor. The player can create new island chains either from scratch, or by modifying an existing map. The appearance of these islands can be determined right down to the last detail. The easy to use object-oriented editor in the same style as the game allows even inexperienced players to create new worlds and scenarios.
