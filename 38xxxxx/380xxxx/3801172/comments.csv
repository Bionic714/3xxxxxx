,Diceman_,2008-04-29T16:07Z,"Hi, I burned these to DVD (ISO format) and the files will not play (""cannot render the file""), even if coped to hard drive.

What has happened here, I have had no problems with any other torrent."
,Nayon,2008-06-05T05:41Z,"Diceman

You using VLC or Media Player Classic to play these on your computer? If not get em. K-lite codec pack is a godsend. If the codecs to play them are installed the Burning programs like Windows DVD Maker, Nero Vision will allow you to burn correctly and view this content on a dvd player."
,sconnoll,2008-06-25T23:50Z,You will get a copyright infringment notice if you download this... I did
,Smekofc,2008-06-26T21:50Z,the speed on this one is pretty fucking gay tbh..
,sivikoutkast,2008-07-26T00:16Z,"This is frustrating, torrent is at 200k for about one hour or two, then drops in and out between 5k-20k for like 3 days now.  What gives?"
,sivikoutkast,2008-07-28T16:49Z,What is the fvcking deal with piratebays  seeders and leechers ratio.  Do they manipulate it so you will download from them or what.  Right now it says 190 S  and 98 L.  Bull fvcking shit.  Sometimes you can refresh and it will show like 100 S and 1500 L.  WTF
,exxcezz,2008-11-01T18:39Z,"What the hell u guys want with subs? 
omg if u cant english .. thats bad ass xD"
,LezDawson,2008-11-02T01:42Z,"Spiderbaby: why would you want to convert an avi file to DVD format?  You'll actually lose quality just by converting it from one format to another, and increase the file size massively.  You can get DivX-compatible DVD players so cheaply these days (I mean dirt cheap - just google), there's no point in converting to DVD."
