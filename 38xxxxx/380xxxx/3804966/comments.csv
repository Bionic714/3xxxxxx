,jakesmom,2007-09-13T08:46Z,"Fucking Seed God Dammit!!!
Im uploading 30/kbs, and Downloading 2kb/s
Thanks all!!"
[T],sotis,2007-09-13T09:02Z,"Well im seeding with 11,5 MB/s and have already uploaded over 100 GB. But just as important as seeders is that all leechers share while downloading. Make sure you have the right ports open in your firewall/router, and try not to download/seed a lot of other torrents at the same time."
,munken,2007-09-13T09:27Z,thanks dude
,BalleKnalle,2007-09-13T09:29Z,HAve this Multi Language like Swedish English Fin Rus etc?

,hurikan,2007-09-13T09:53Z,"omg people seed pls. 2 KB/s, its too bad. 11 seeders ? where ? :)"
[T],sotis,2007-09-13T10:10Z,"Each seeder is only connected to a limited amount of leechers. But it doesnt matter becouse the leechers together have 100% of the data many times around. So if only you all leechers open up the right ports in your router/firewall and share to other leechers, the speed will pick up. Im still seeding with 11,5 MB/s, so please be patient. And stay on as a seeder when youre done!"
,jakesmom,2007-09-13T10:13Z,Its Speeding up!! Thanks for the upload sotis!!

,ukonpoika,2007-09-13T18:55Z,This game is full of shit...EA hasn't made almost any of the changes it said on their website. This is practically a patch for the last year's game. I think they do this because they can get easy money from pc users and there is no rival for the game on pc like the espn's 2k series.
,tandfen90,2007-09-13T19:10Z,tja någon som vill lägga ut cracken till mig på en annan torrent:) har clone realesen:D där fick man inte med någon crack

I got the game loaded on a virtual drive but it keeps saying I have the wrong dvd in.  I know what the instructions were ""Copy our crack from DVD to game dir overwriting the old then play.""  This was where Im having trouble.  BTW thanks sotis!!"

,Viktorinho,2007-09-13T22:08Z,seeders are those who uploads. you can't control the seeders. just ask them to seed. ;)

,NoMoreVIP,2007-09-13T22:36Z,jag vet inte hur bra du är på eng!?! men det står att cracket finns på DVD så om du uppnar dvd å sedan lär du hitta cracket å sedan tar du bara den/dom filerna å över för dom till den mapen du har spelet!

,alfred_chicken,2007-09-14T04:06Z,i finished downloading the game but i cant open it....can anyone tell me what software to use to open it?
[T],sotis,2007-09-14T04:36Z,You need to unpack all the files with WinRAR. Then you have an .iso-file to burn with Nero or mount with Daemon. Now you are ready to install. And to finish copy the crack from the DVD to the install folder on your HDD and replace the .exe-file thats already there. Good luck!
,shrxfan91,2007-09-14T07:10Z,is this being watched?
,Mr.n0n,2007-09-14T11:35Z,"Alright. I haven't played NHL on PC since NHL 06. Nothing much has happened in 08. Same old graphics, no good animations, etc. I'm gonna order it to the PS3. In other words, NHL games should be played on consoles, way better than the PC versions. Sad, but true."
[T],sotis,2007-09-14T12:02Z,"@ gphagfy: Im a lucky owner of a 100/100 connection, max upload is around 11,5 MB/s :) This torrent should work fine without me now, there are around 500 seeders now. So I stopped seeding now, with a share-ratio at 450 and a bit over 1 TB uploaded!"

When I play Skellefteå, the commentators says ""Leksand"".

And it continues to do this."
,paxel500,2007-09-14T18:22Z,if your computer got a bluetooth device then you should turn it off. because it maybe thinks that you have a controller input to the computer

I have downloaded, extracted the files, burned to DVD, and installed the the game onto my computer.  I am having troubles with finding where the crack file is located on the DVD.  Please give me an exact file name.  Also which file do I paste the crack to?
Please help asap.  I can't wait to play!!
Thanks."

Now you need to find your game directory on your harddrive. Its probably something like this C:\Program Files\EA Sports\NHL08. Right-click in this window and choose ""Paste"" to copy and replace the original ""nhl2008.exe"" with the cracked one. Now your done! Good luck!"

,RawSnake,2007-09-15T17:01Z,"What a dissapointment....its like a patched nhl 07. The pc version isnt even close to the same game as the 360, ps3-versions. (Next gen graphics, all the new content ""golie-mode"" for example) If you have nhl 07 you might aswell stick to that game cause its almost the same game. Get a grip EA or just stick to the consoles"
,jakesmom,2007-09-15T18:16Z,"I agree with you RawSnake!  This is just a regurgitated recycled version of 06, 07. I think this is the final dagger to Ea's heart. Why waste our time EA. Pc users are what made you such a rich corporation. If you love console gamers soo much, why dont you just leave us Pc users alone. Im definatly not buying this crap!!!!"

Well first welcome to this wonderful world of torrents... :)
So I don't know much what kind of problems do you have. I could help you but we should  contact each other by mail or  a messenger...
If you want me to give you some advices here, I will but tell me at what stage you are at the moment and what are your problems... Its up to you...
Rawsnake: yeah i agree too, they should put some next gen graphs for the PC, that sucks to see consoles gamers having fun on a cool loking game...
jakesmom: well duh, if you dled this game why buying it or not, I mean if you liked it you keep playing the torrent, if not just delete it... 
Larpp1: NO the crack is here so that you dont waste time on burning anything :P
Zp_theart: this is normal in torrents or any, lets say, ""illegal"" release ( :P ). Its due to the fact that to play online you usually need a cd key(valid) and most of producers/developers  block the online part by putting the key protection so if 3542 ppl dl the game, how do you imagine the online play posible with that amount of players using the same key??? you want to play online? buy the game simple as it is...

,hannes90,2007-09-16T10:22Z,when i try to configure my joystick it all fucks up
,sidorenkoPL,2007-09-16T11:00Z,"Larpp1:
No you copy the crack into the game folder it should be smth like this : ""
And about your files like .005, I also have this problem... but its very easy to bypass it, just hit properties of the file that wears  .001  and choose Winzip/rar as  the default running program, then extract and youll see other pack to ecract, etc...
Well if you have this problem you wont have to mount anything cause with this method youll directly exctract the cd files onto your PC, there wont be any ISO file...    So just hit setup, enter the cd key and then enjoy :P
Oh and if you lack of space on the HDD just be sure to delete  all rar/zip packs that you extracted but wont need further, if you want to preserve the game on a dvd burn the last package  ( if i see it staright there should be like 4 of them :P ) delete the rest cause they will each time take the whole 2.31 Gb on the HDD

Hannes90:
Do you have a connected printer or smth like that in the same time  cause it could be the reason . they are often incompatible each other, as for me when my printer is connected my mouse(Logitech) and the Joy (thrustmaster) are not working very nicely.
Other explanation, you can have the same problem as me, when you configure it the buttons does not correspond to your pad,  so configure, play, see the differencies and rectify   it takes about 10 mins its a little frustrating  but after that youll be happy to play it :P"

I övrigt är spelet en mer eller mindre kopia av NHL 07 förutom att de ändrat kontrollerna så att det ska kännas nytt t.ex. så är byta spelare bundet till passningsknappen igen och inte på en separat knapp som i 07. Slå undan pucken är inte längre bunden till passningsknappen utan till handledsskottsknappen. Det tog en stund att vänja sig med 07s kontroller och nu har de gjort en rockad igen. Suck, fokusera på att utveckla spelet istället."

DIRECTIONS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

With your DVD inserted, you open ""My Computer"". Locate the icon for the NHL'08 DVD, right-click on it and choose ""Open"". Go in to the ""FAIRLIGHT"" folder and there you will find the cracked exe named ""nhl2008.exe"". Right-click on it and choose ""Copy"". 
Now you need to find your game directory on your harddrive. Its probably something like this C:\Program Files\EA Sports\NHL08. Right-click in this window and choose ""Paste"" to copy and replace the original ""nhl2008.exe"" with the cracked one. Now your done! Good luck! "

I have install that game long time ago and i haved difficulty to understand how install FLT FILES on a DVD. First: You need WINRAR 3.71. You can find it free here:  http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3871224/WinRar_3.71_final___keygen_(Works_100__)  It,s a pirate version. After the instalation of WINRAR 3.71, EXTRACT THE FILE FLT 1 with WINRAR 3.71.  This will extract all the game in a folder.  Now you need to transform that folder to an  ISO because this is the format necessary to BURN (copy) a game.  OPEN WINRAR 3.71. and click on the option BROWSE. Find the folder than you have extract before.When you have find that folder,CLICK ON THE RIGHT BUTTON OF THE MOUSE and choice EXTRACT ALL. This will TRANSFORM THE GAME TO AN ISO. NOW  you need NERO v6.6.0.13 to copy the game on a DVD. You can download the pirate version here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3763806/Nero_Burning_ROM_v6.6.0.13___keygen   Install NERO v6.6.0.13 . After the instalation of Nero v6.6.0.13 open NERO. In the options select DVD.You'll see differents options. Select BURN AN ISO. Now, you will see others differents options. Choice browse and try to find the iso you have create. It's in the WINRAR so, in the browse just go to winrar and click on the iso. In the NERO options click OK. IT'S FINNISH !!!! The game will be copyed ON A DVD !!!! After the copy to activate the game just see my others previous comments here. If you have problems or others questions, don't hesitate.   "

,c14phillips14,2008-05-01T00:33Z,"I opened the files with WinRar, then mounted them with Daemon tools. Burned the ISO file to disk. I'm able to install everything correctly. Replaced the exe with the cracked one. Then when I go to open the game, I get a pop up saying to ""Insert NHL 2008 CD/Disk.""

Would anyone know what stepped I may have messed up on?

Thank You For Your Time.

,lareth2209,2008-05-13T06:58Z,Either my eyes have been compromised or you left out the actual crack file?

so ive tried another one with which i could start the game, but then i didnt see the menu, just the background, and the music was playing  o_O

,neffernin,2008-06-11T05:29Z,"Steps to install
1) Download
2) Unzip
3) Mount iso with PowerISO or Daemon Tools
4) Run EASetup.exe from main directory of the CD
5) Serial is in the .nfo
6) After that copy the file in the ""Fairlight"" directory on the main directory of the CD to where you installed in on your HD.

Simple stuff folks, do you even try?"
,neffernin,2008-06-11T05:31Z,"Sorry, to elaborate on Step 6:
Copy the file cddir:\fairlight\nhl2008.exe and replace the instance of it in c:\program files\easports\nhl2008\"
,pbfanatic321,2008-06-14T15:28Z,"Guys when I get this downloaded and i open the folder there isn't anything to extract, it's just a bunch of files that I've never even seen.  And I am not able to mount them with Daemon tools cause its like not the correct file.  The files in the folder aren't like an iso so thats why I'm having a little problem.  Thanks guys."
,Deputy276,2008-06-15T06:12Z,I agree with pbfanatic321. All I got were a bunch of files with NO extensions on them and no ISO file at all. Also no executeable. Nothing there to unzip. This torrent may be totally corrupted. 
,shogged,2008-06-15T10:55Z,"right click one of the files, use the ""open with"" menu item, and open it with winrar.

they are still zipped files, they just have the wrong extension in the name so windows won't recognize it as a rar or zip file."
,Deputy276,2008-06-15T16:59Z,"""they just have the wrong extension in the name so windows won't recognize it as a rar or zip file."" 

Too late. I dumped the whole download. Pretty disappointing that this download was put together so sloppily. And from a guy with the skull and crossbones next to his name. :-("

Jag ser att fler har samma problem som mig. Jag har installerat spelet korrekt men jag får inte upp några menyer när jag väl startar spelet. Jag hör musiken och kan byta osv, hör t.o.m. ett ljud när jag trycker på ""Y"" på kontrollen så nåt händer men inga menyer. Några idéer?"
