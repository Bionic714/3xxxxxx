Notes:
======

We would like to point for the scene that SKIDROW is unable to crack any
sort of game protections. Theyr Medieval.2.Total.War.Update.1.3-SKIDROW
said Securom7 in the nfo but guess they were too busy taking some
download exe, that they didn't notice that it was actually protected with
SafeDisc4.
"Still making fuckups like fucking fat chicken?"
