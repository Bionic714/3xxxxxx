Thank you, finally a download that has all the files I need. When I tired the other ones they didnt have BIOSes and when I put them in they still never worked, here I set the BIOS to the one included (There are some here:http://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070121051502AAOfVas).

It said something about something and opened a thing and I pciked the first option in the list and it went as it should!"

,bluecelt1155,2008-01-11T17:25Z,"Excellent, works well. Two questions: Can I use real PSX memory cards, and can I hook up a PSX controller?"

No, unfortunately you can't use real PSX memory cards.  You must use the supplied .mcr files for saving game information.  Unless you have a USB adapter for your controller you will need one designed for the PC.  I recommend the Logitech RumblePad 2.  It is a PS2 controller clone."
