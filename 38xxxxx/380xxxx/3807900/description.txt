Acer Aspire 3000/5000 Recovery Cd's

Acer laptops - Acer notebooks usually ship their computers with one or more hard drive data recovery CDs (also known as Acer laptop recovery CDs, Acer laptop hard drive recovery CDs, Acer laptop hard drive restore CDs or Acer laptop hard drive data restore CDs). The Acer laptop hard drive data recovery CDs are specifically designed for your Acer laptop computer, usually contain an image of what was on the computers hard drive when it was first bought, & they allow you to return the Acer laptop to its original state (as new). This is particularly useful if the machine has been attacked by a virus, if the original hard drive has developed a fault, or if you simply wish to replace or upgrade the Acer laptop hard drive, & need to re-install your original software.

The Acer laptop Windows recovery CDs are also sometimes referred to as Acer laptop Windows installation CDs because they completely erase the contents of your hard drive & then re-install your operating system (Windows). However, they differ from normal Windows installation disks in that they usually restore all programs which were originally installed on the hard drive when the computer was first purchased (any additional programs or files which were not originally installed will be overwritten).
