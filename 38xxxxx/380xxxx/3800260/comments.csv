I have a DELL OEM Vista Disk and it doesnt ask for any serial or something else, that's every OEM disk does.

More Information:
The latest trend in Windows Vista cracks is to utilize OEM certificates in order to bypass the activation process of the operating in Dell, HP, and Sony OEM
In this regard, the Vista activation is persistent, which means that just by providing a correct and valid OEM product key, the operating system will not need to be activated online. Hackers have also released OEM versions of Windows Vista DVD media complete with the digital certificate.

so typically its just another way to activate Vista."
