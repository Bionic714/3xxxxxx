,randigastrumpan,2007-09-22T23:48Z,"sorry but i don't get it, never done it before, but it is still like the test version..."
,Ubehage,2007-09-23T19:43Z,"After you located the folder with the Patch, it will take a few seconds - and everything is done :)"
,Humble0511,2007-09-24T05:11Z,Thanks alot Ubehage for your help man.However here is the thing. I patch the folder and it says cracked but nothing really happens.Now i am able to open the program but it says unregistered version is it suppose to say that?
,Ubehage,2007-09-25T00:00Z,"Humble0511>

Sorry.. :)
You have to enter a name in the Patch, before applying it.
Then it will register the program to you :)"

,Zeuzi,2007-09-29T16:38Z,"If you don't know how to, these are the instructions:

1. Run setup.

2. Go to Program Files, drag n drop the patch file into the MagicIso Program File.

3. Go into the MagicIso Program File and run the patch.

4. Make it register to your name or whatever you want it registered to.

5. Click Crack."
,botinis,2007-11-07T21:11Z,is it ok with windows vista? anyone with vista installed this allready?
,Ubehage,2007-11-10T15:22Z,"Yes. I use it with Vista, and it works fine."
,Enzio_Ferrari,2007-12-07T15:27Z,This one DOES work! What more do you want?
,Zmir,2008-01-02T11:40Z,Thanks! Works nicely :)
,patrioticparadox,2008-01-12T01:46Z,I agree RingPeace. its ridiculous. im downloading this just so i can burn a .uif thats over 300 MBs and then as soon as thats done its getting uninstalled. USE ISO PEOPLE!
,Jalle13,2008-01-16T17:48Z,Thanx works great! No virus.
,NYCRocker,2008-02-05T15:21Z,Excellent! Follow Zeuzi's instructions if you don't know it.
,torrentjor,2008-02-08T13:37Z,"path said  ""successful"" but still unregistered.

I triedthe Zeuzi at 2007-09-29 16:38 CET: #4 
4. Make it register to your name or whatever you want it registered to.

But still not working.

Any ideas?"
,torrentjor,2008-02-08T13:40Z,Never mind.. it worked
,qwerty4030,2008-02-10T23:06Z,thanks works great!
,bwmcmaste,2008-02-21T06:28Z,I agree with RingPeace and patrioticparadox. This .uif file bullshit needs to stop. .iso is good enough for anything a normal person needs.
,bwmcmaste,2008-02-21T06:50Z,It's fair to mention that this file works flawlessly and the patch is perfect. The only problem I have is that now my context menu includes a link to the magiciso site.
,fille87,2008-04-08T11:44Z,"OMG This works like a charm!
Just drag patch to dir, then patch with ur name or something. It worked fantastically! No virus :D"
