No. 14 AP ranked PSU Penn State Nittany Lions (Big Ten Conference) going into the season vs the unranked Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The file is indeed in 16:9 format, but the resolution is a little low. Next time any 16:9 release Ill try to go for bigger resolution to see if theres any difference, I doubt therell be a lot though unless my source is truly HD. In any rate, enjoy, and let me know if you find a way to grab unaltered HD files of my HR20-700... Also I need someone to test if this works on a PS3 and AppleTV.

Enjoy! See my previous torrents for other PSU releases.

WE ARE ... PENN STATE!
(We dont give a Notre Damn!)

cheers,
