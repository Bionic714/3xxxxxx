Release Notes:

"Magic" will be a welcome arrival for long-time Springsteen fans for whom 
"The Rising" is the only album of new songs featuring the entire E Street Band 
since 1987's "Tunnel of Love." Springsteen broke into the rock and roll 
mainstream with the classic "Born to Run" in 1975, and solidified his place as a 
mega-star with 1984's "Born in the USA." "Magic" will be the 24th album from 
Springsteen since his recording career began with 1973's "Greetings from 
Asbury Park, New Jersey." During that time he has won 15 GRAMMY awards 
and one Academy Award, for the song "Streets of Philadelphia" in 1994.
