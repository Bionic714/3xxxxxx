-yes it´s a fake but was there any orginal at all?

,dliwehtfollac,2008-02-20T17:42Z,i recently watched a documentary on snuff films and according to them there is no actual snuff film ever found....so relax guys its fake
,HurtByTheSun,2008-04-08T19:30Z,"Of course it's fake, you idiots.  Look up the series to find out information on it.  It was Charlie Sheen who watched them and thought they were real; he reported the tapes to the FBI and Hideshi Hino (the guy who made them) was investigated and all sorts.  Then some serial killer (can't remember the name) took inspiration from them whilst committing some of his crimes.

The films are definitely not for the squeamish, or for watching with your mother.  However, they are interesting as a study on pain and suffering.  It's quite clear that the children who've watched this and left comments here are too daft to think about them rationally.

Cheers for this, by the way.  I lost the first disc of my box set and this can replace it.  Flowers of Flesh and Blood is the best in the series."
