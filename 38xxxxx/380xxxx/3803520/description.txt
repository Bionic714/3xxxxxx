 [Plot]
 Leave it to Monty Python's Flying Circus to create something like this.
 "The Meaning of Life" opens with a sketch about a bunch of overworked accountants taking
 revenge on the yuppie bankers, Errol Flynn-style.
 
 Then, the movie shows the various stages of life.
 Among these displays are an explanation of why "every sperm is sacred",
 John Cleese's demonstration of having sex,

 Terry Jones as a man who has quite literally had too much to eat
 (and continues having too much),
 and finally, death - prior to which you are chased by half-dressed women.

 Anyway, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Eric Idle,
 Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones do their usual stuff.
 
 A laugh riot from beginning to end.
