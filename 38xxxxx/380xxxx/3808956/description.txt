Cleopatra Fortune is a 1996 puzzle game by Taito Corporation.

The gameplay is similar to Tetris in which the player has to direct blocks of stone and treasure to create closures which eliminates the treasure and adds to the player's score. Also if a full line of stone blocks is formed they will disappear in a similar fashion to Tetris and also add to the player's score.

The game's name comes from its mascot which is a super deformed version of queen Cleopatra. Additionally the game utilizes an Egyptian theme.
