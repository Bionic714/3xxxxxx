,Jenssterr,2007-12-20T18:36Z,"If you want to install ;;
1) download magic iso maker
2) select the 4 files in your download from crashday 
3) richclick on it and go to the icon from magic ISO
4)and select add to CRASH.UIF
5)magic iso is going to comprimise the files into a iso
6)Run deamon-tools/Alcohol 
7)mount the ISO in to a drive
8)Instalshield now begins automatic, just instal
9)Copy the crack file to your instal destination, if it ask to replace it just say yes

I hope it works for you guis now ^^

Good luck"
