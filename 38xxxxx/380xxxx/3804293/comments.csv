,shango,2007-09-12T18:14Z,wow this sounds like the dumbest video ever created. Especially since the us government was the last to admit that global warming was even happening i doubt they are behind the conspiracy to be on the bandwagon behind it.. and they arent. They paid many scientists to lie about information related to global warming. If globabl warming was funded with tens of billions of dollars like they say then maybe something would be done about it but unfortunately that is a blatant lie. Sounds like right wing propaganda.. oh wait! it is.
,pooleyboo,2007-09-12T18:43Z,"Where political and religious ideologies have failed in the past to control the masses, Global Warming, if we let it will triumph.

Trading and capitalism, production and manufacture are fundamental economic mechanisms available to anybody on the planet who wants to make a living. The pursuit of profit is taxed and this ultimately pays for all the governments and their advisors. You cannot send the same dollar around the system and not expect inflation without injecting in some fresh money as well, such as taxes from profit or interest from investment. Communism failed to do this and that is why it failed.

This system of trading and similar systems have been around for thousands of years. It helps to keep societies stable because the majority of people become productive members of society and stay focussed on their personal carrot, such as mortgage, rent bills and car. A balance between tax and personal wealth is achieved and usually fought over at elections, but governments know that ultimately they have to protect and nurture wealth creation as without it, they are out of their jobs.

To conclude, just what system are these Eco-commies going to replace all that with, if we are really to except and be brainwashed into believing that us, one species out of millions, is doing all the damage?

By the way I am not right wing neo-nutter. I am British and from the UK. Historically, a successful trading nation."
,Darndare,2007-09-12T23:47Z,pooleyboo. I'm with you. Without trading (capitalism) there would be no societies. It makes it older than religion 'cause you need a society to agree on a religion. 
,shango,2007-09-13T05:05Z,I guess you have never heard of neo-socialism. It is a way of living not a way of making a living. There is a difference between having socio-economic programs to help people and doing away with capitalism. Those are older forms of socialism and communism and have nothing to do with economics. Do some research.

,oldngrey,2007-10-17T21:12Z,"The Big Myth! Global warming.
The film ""An Incovenient Truth"" would make a great presentation if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forbodding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depressed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temperature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobel prize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not su"

,Mimimae,2008-10-12T19:18Z,"No, ""oldngrey"", you are not the only one (who believes i whatever he wants), but you are one of very very few, and increasingly fewer, who still finds it meaningful to challenge the major thesis or the film, namely that we are seriously contributing to global warming by filling the atmosphere with carbon dioxide.
And frankly, I would buy stuff from you company too, if you had scientific decency to mention that the same judge you are so keen of quoting concluded that the major thesis of the film stands and that it is suitable for the in class, school education, if completed with more less dramatical and more scientific evidence. Look at this (and yes, I do make it possible to check my sources in full):

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/11/AR2007101102134.html 
High Court Judge Michael Burton, deciding a lawsuit that questioned the film's suitability for showing in British classrooms, said Wednesday that the movie builds a ""powerful"" case that global warming is caused by humans and that urgent means are needed to counter it.

*****************'
And ""oldngrey"", remember that Gore's and Guggenheim's film is just an informative/propaganda film, for something that really needs propaganda, for it has been oversighted for too long, and as such, a damn good one film, too.
