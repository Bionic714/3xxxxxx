LAO TZU SAYS:
ALL THE WORLD SAYS:
MY TEACHING, TAO, GREATLY RESEMBLES FOLLY. BECAUSE IT IS GREAT, THEREFORE IT RESEMBLES FOLLY. IF IT DID NOT RESEMBLE FOLLY, IT WOULD HAVE LONG AGO BECOME PETTY INDEED!
I HAVE THREE TREASURES; GUARD THEM AND KEEP THEM SAFE. THE FIRST IS LOVE. THE SECOND IS, NEVER TOO MUCH. THE THIRD IS, NEVER BE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD. THROUGH LOVE, ONE HAS NO FEAR; THROUGH NOT DOING TOO MUCH ONE HAS AMPLITUDE OF RESERVE POWER; THROUGH NOT PRESUMING TO BE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD ONE CAN DEVELOP ONE'S TALENT AND LET IT MATURE.
IF ONE FORSAKES LOVE AND FEARLESSNESS, FORSAKES RESTRAINT AND RESERVE POWER, FORSAKES FOLLOWING BEHIND AND RUSHES IN FRONT, HE IS DOOMED!
