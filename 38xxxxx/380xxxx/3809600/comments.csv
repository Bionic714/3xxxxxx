,austex_chris,2007-09-19T17:27Z,When you download this the install instructions make you e-mail this guy and give him 25 euros for an unlock code. Not cool dude.
,marktman1,2007-09-22T00:03Z,"nee,voor een dubbeltje op de eerste rang.
gewoon betalen en je hebt een perfect werkend stikje software.
tsja je kan ook nieuw kopen.

,ChillinVillin,2007-09-24T19:05Z,"Marktman1: 

Logical to make some money back if you paid the $69.00 from Garmin, 

And if you sold the unlock for $1 you could have made a few quid. 

But since your a greedy prick.

Here's a free link;

i don`t look overhere everyday.
and maybey you were in my spamlist

try again.

and for the people who were helped,maybey they type something overhere.

and chillinvillin you are probarbly right.
always people who didn`t fuck lately and have to yank overhere.

there is no free link."
,mergedown,2007-10-01T13:26Z,martman1 has been very responsive to my emails. Has anyone tried this successfully?
,Ales27,2007-10-01T15:25Z,"You don't need to unlock, i've just updated my 4 garmin c330 with this. Just put a 15$ 1gb SD card (http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2792216&CatId=380). Insert SD card in GPS, plug it with USB cable, start the program, choose the regions you want and upload it to your GPS. It's that simple!!"
,ultravista,2007-10-04T01:22Z,"Ales27, how do you upload to your mini-SD card without using hte Garmin software?

The unit will complain about the maps being locked.

How did you get around this? Direct upload of the map to the mini-SD - through the Garmin or a reader?

Please explain."
,krisbuxton,2007-10-29T00:56Z,yeah im curious too i also have a c330 and says those are locked your using the v8 if our doing otherwise 
,sabresfan,2007-11-06T08:49Z,"has anyone been able to find an unlock key for this??, It's sort of pointless to download it, if you can't unlock it"
,marktman1,2007-11-09T16:09Z,"people people.

everybody know there are no free Garmin maps.
keep asking if there is and when you find tell me.
so mail me for more info."
,1sh0t1kill,2007-11-12T00:41Z,marktman1 works for the lawyers of Garmin. Send him $$ and you'll be added to the Garmin Lawsuit. 
,zandora,2007-11-14T05:55Z,"Charging is not cool.  If 50 people sent him 25 euros, he would be profiting quite handsomely off of someone else's work.  Its people like this that make the whole system threatened. Either don't provide the key to anyone, provide it to anyone who asks, or provide some kind of crack. I would like this product, but I won't pay for a key, and shame on anyone that does. I uploaded Garmin Topo USA 2008 DVD, which although it does not do routing might be helpful to some of you, and does not have a key."
,shaun3000,2007-11-24T02:02Z,"OK, I can't seem to get it to install. When I run any of the MSI files, it runs through the ELUA, install location (C:? That seems strange) I click next, it shows the progress bar for a split-second, then says it had to quit due to an error. Am I doing something wrong?"
,wvy,2007-11-25T18:22Z,"I only need a number to use it on my PC (non GPS use). I don't need ""DEMO"" .. 

So, who post a unlock to use this program on PC??

,hittinem,2007-12-03T21:54Z,how do i install my unlocked map to my streetpilot 330's internal memory. i cant seem to figure it out with the mapinstall ormapsource programs. it is saying that i have no free memory left. i want to swap my original factory installed map with the city navigator nt 2008. thanks for any help and great work on getting the unlock codes for free.
,left123right,2007-12-09T04:42Z,"I can't get this unlocked, can someone help me? email me at left123right@gmail.com"
,Newb787,2007-12-10T08:21Z,"How much does Garmin charge for an unlock code, just wondering?  

Also, how is this file different than the other one on PB?"
,Newb787,2007-12-10T08:22Z,"BTW, the other NA 2008 is 2.54 GB. Big difference between the two."
,jba474,2007-12-13T04:21Z,"PLEASE NOTE: I take no credit for this guide as I have stolen it from various places on The Pirate Bay.  I can confirm that it works for Nuvi 350 using City Navigator North America NT 2008.

NOTE: This keygen is not yet compatible with Garmin MapSource application. To see maps in the MapSource, use the key provided with the map.  To unlock the maps on the PC use: type  VE76V-AXVLW-9CQTA-4ADB8-8DQZ9 into unlock wizard.  This code is for  City Navigator North America NT 2008, sorry I don't have one for Europe or any other country.

1. Get JetMouse Kg v.1.1 http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3924373/Garmin_Keygen__made_by_JetMouse_
2. In Nuvi go to -> Settings -> System -> About -> Unit ID (10 digits or so)
3. Enter the ID in keygen to get Device Code.
4. Select Map Product or Select ""custom mapset"" in keygen and enter 284 to get unlock code for City Navigator Europe NT 2008.

Now you have two options here:
Option 1 - saving mapset on a SD Card
--------------------------------------------------
1. Once you get your Map Unlock Code, save it into a file called GMAPSUPP.UNL (using Notepad)
2. Rename your downloaded gmapprom.img to gmapsupp.img. 
3. Create a directory called Garmin on your the root directory of the SD card
4. Put both GMAPSUPP.IMG and GMAPSUPP.UNL to \Garmin\ directory.
5. Insert the SD Card into the Nuvi and restart GPS unit.

Option 2 - overwriting existing preloaded mapset within the Nuvi
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Once you get your Map Unlock Code , save it into a file called GMAPPROM.UNL (using Notepad)
1. Connect your GPS Unit to the PC and go to \Garmin\ directory.
2. Make a backup copy of your current GMAPPROM.IMG mapset file to some place safe on  your computer.
3. Delete GMAPPROM.IMG mapset file from your GPS unit.
4. Upload the new GMAPPROM.IMG mapset to your GPS unit (same directory) along with GMAPPROM.UNL and restart GPS unit

NOTE: This keygen is not yet compatible with Garmin MapSource application. To see maps in the MapSource, use the key provided with the map.  To unlock the maps on the PC use: type  VE76V-AXVLW-9CQTA-4ADB8-8DQZ9 into unlock wizard.

PLEASE NOTE: I take no credit for this guide as I have stolen it from various places on The Pirate Bay.  I can confirm that it works for Nuvi 350 using City Navigator North America NT 2008.

PS I agree that selling something you didn't pay for or make yourself is shameful."
,yqren,2007-12-14T21:05Z,"I tried the code from this site. The CODE does unlock the map for Mapsource on PC. But I can't tranfer the data from PC to UNIT (street polit C320) 
Error Message: "" The map havn't been unlocked for your GPS""
Then, I transfered the data to a SD card and insert in my Unit following the instruction on the website. Still doesn't work.
Maybe the solution doesn't work for regualr GPS UNIT?
Any suggection?

Thanks in advance."
,christopherhammer,2007-12-29T07:32Z,contact me at chrishamma@aol.com for unlock code.  Mine is 1000% legit.  10 us dollars via paypal for working code....
,SunyJim,2008-01-07T09:10Z,"Ok the non-direct to the card.
I've done this with North america 2008, and bluechart 9.5 so it works.
 i have an etrex legend cx. 
I installed the maps to my computer.  Use the reg cracks when there are ones to fool it into thinking that you are just updating. 
Then once it's in... the computer says you must unlock. Use the Jetmouse 1.3 crack with map id, and your device id, run the unlock wizard twice, once to enter the device serial, the other to enter the map serial.  Then that's it, you can choose sections to upload, even parts of one and parts of another, just like unlocked maps.

ps. keygen is here on piratebay. 
the paying to unlock people can go stick it"
