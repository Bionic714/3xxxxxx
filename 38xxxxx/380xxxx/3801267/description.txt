Recorded and edited with Adobe Audition from the Xbox 360.  EAC/Lame to convert .wav\'s to mp3\'s at a 192kbps.

The original Hexic HD soundtrack \"Hexophilia\" can be found at http://lockjawlabs.com/blog/?page_id=5 . Download it.

There is no world on Hexic 2 getting a soundtrack officially, so here it is unofficially.  No track names (unless someone can get them).

Check other uploads I have, such as the Guitar Hero II songs by the actual artists (fuck covers). http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3684264/Various_Artists_-_Guitar_Hero_II_Soundtrack_Xbox_360_Version And also the Wii menu music http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3611428/Wii_Menu_Music
