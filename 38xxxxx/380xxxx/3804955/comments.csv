,bmorgan303,2007-09-14T05:44Z,"Oblivion is a WEAK-ASS console port. Its a playschool RPG for little console kiddies. This game is gay....but whats gayer than that? The dipshit who needs a fuckin strategy guide to play this worthless shitbag of a game. Thanks to the uploader, thanks for posting this worthless torrent for us. Thanks a million."
,saakeli666,2007-09-14T06:26Z,i put this only if somebody need this.
,Robinhero,2007-09-14T17:46Z,"bmorgan303... you are one sorry piece of shit my friend. First off, Oblivion is not a console-port. Playschool rpg? Compared to what? I concider myself a hardcore gamer, and my only complaints about oblivion is that all enemies lvl depends on the player. Other than that it is a SWEET-ASS game that deserves all credit. You on the other hand is a WEAK-ASS gay-porn lover with to much bs in your brain... I bet 50$ you hate oblivion because your computer canÂ´t handle it... sucker! :)"

,Evil_Nova,2008-01-10T20:24Z,"lol@bmorgan303 - comments like yours are truely playschoolish behaviour. If you don't have anything constructive, or nice to say, what's wrong with just keeping your mouth shut? Grow up, find some carbonbased, humanoid friends instead of just playing with pixels, and quit whining  ;o)  "
,cheesepie23,2008-02-05T15:04Z,is this guide just for the original game or for the expansions too ??
,thatonekid393,2008-02-28T23:23Z,"Well, ignoring the argument going on, I'll go ahead and post what I think of this file

Fantastic!!! I had lost this when I switched computers and have found it again. This is the bona-fide Prima strategy guide scanned for Adobe to read. Love it, thank you, now I can continue on in my game life :)"
,kipenz,2008-07-13T20:30Z,"Although never officially recognized as such, Oblivion for the PC IS a port. Exemplified by the many subtle details such as only 8 hotkeys (dpad anyone?), numerous low resolution textures for the xbox's low memory, phisher price menus to display better on a television, etc. Bethesda knew that the console market was a massive investment, so designed the game for consoles first, and the hardcore PC community second. 

Luckily however, Bethesda was so kind to include the TES editor. Allowing the community to make up for their corporate mindset and laziness."

you wrote that comment almost three years ago yet you still remain a piece of shit to this day. Oblivion on the other hand is still just as badass as ever. "
