Melways maps (Victoria, Australia) for OziExplorer.

These maps were assembled and calibrated from map segments obtained from streetdirectory.com.au. There are some spots on the maps which have errors, such as misaligned bits of map, but these errors are in the streetdirectory.com.au maps and I can do nothing about them. When that site corrects the errors I wil rebuild the maps and re-release them.
