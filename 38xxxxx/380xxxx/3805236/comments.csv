,gwerro,2008-02-21T21:10Z,"Thanks for the torrent. There's one little problem, though. When I try to extract the AOW.rar file, winrar says the archive doesn't contain any files, or that they are corrupted. Any ideas?"
,costadill,2008-02-23T15:25Z,"gwerro: You haft to mount the file named AOW
use demontool or Alcohol. "
,LoganEV,2008-03-24T23:17Z,Mounted the image and the setup won't run.. blast!
,behemut,2008-03-31T22:41Z,legendary game that should have received more acclaim!
,splatcat,2008-05-06T14:43Z,Thanks for the upload but this file is definitely corrupt. i know two people who have downloade from mulitple locations and the ISO will not mount...re-submit? thanks!!
,sunfire23,2008-08-11T20:14Z,"As of today image is indeed broken, ""unexpected end of archive""."
,shaggadally,2009-01-21T16:40Z,"i can't open the no cd crack!:(
please help me*"
,int19h,2009-03-23T09:45Z,"The file is _not_ corrupted, it's just not an ISO. I think it's a raw image (BIN). This program could mount it for me:

(note that it also works on Win7, unlike DAEMON tools)"
,Doomgaze_89,2009-06-07T01:19Z,"plz seed a while longer, almost done :) 

sorry for asking, but is this the first game?
Been looking for it quite long now.

If it's the real and first game, i'll help seeding for at least a month or two. (found 5 or 6 others but they where all fake) "
,Doomgaze_89,2009-06-11T09:44Z,"The game was clean and worked perfect! :)

I've been seeding for 3 days now, will continue until the ratio's up high.


Thanx again for a great upload!! "
,farmor2k,2009-07-04T05:27Z,Please seed this. I'm at 95.7% and no one seeds anymore. Please help me out here! I will seed when I can!
,farmor2k,2009-07-04T17:09Z,"Sorry for double posting. But I'm at 98.4% now, and there's only people leeching atm. Please just seed it for just an hour and I will be done, ready to seed. And I'll be seeding for a long while if someone helps me.
Thanks."
,motley666,2010-06-30T01:41Z,"Always mount with power iso, opens anything related to iso files."
,Light92,2010-08-10T16:06Z,Works perfectly.
,Krehlmar,2010-09-21T17:34Z,"I can't get the 32-bit installation (thats what its called in the Windows Task Manager) to install !
I can get the game installation screen to open (the one thats graphiced, with ""Install"" or ""Exit"" but if I press Install windows just asks me for acceptance, then some loading time, then nothing happens. 

The install window never pops up for me, windows 7, tried both Daemon/MagicISO, tried opening it and just running the pure ""Setup.exe"" fire but nothing has got it to install. Any tips?"
,shaggadally,2010-10-25T22:30Z,"it doesnt work on my 64 bit windows 7 laptop:(
i can install it and the patch works, but the no cd crack says some .dll file misses. it also doesn't work if i just try to play the game without patch or crack. anyone can help?"
,termite43,2010-12-06T04:31Z,"Works Windows 7 x64.  HOW TO INSTALL:
If setup doesn't respond, restart your computer - it will work.
Run patch, get missing dll file here:  http://forums.heavengames.com/redir/http%3A//www.dll%2Dfiles.com/dllindex/dll%2Dfiles%2Eshtml%3Fmsvbvm50
Unzip file to c:\windows\syswow64
Click Start button, type run, click run, type regsvr32 c:\windows\syswow64\msvbvm50.dll
Hit enter.
Copy crack to install folder and run it.
Thanks"
