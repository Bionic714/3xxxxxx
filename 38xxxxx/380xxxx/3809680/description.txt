Here's the second "Portugal Night" CD, which I hope matches
what "our" Portugal is at night. Joao Reis once again, one
year later, chooses what he felt was the sound of this year
of 2004. In a time when discs and CDs are a rare thing one
can work on, we present you our second CD, with a big thank
you, for everything you gave us with the first "Portugal
Night". Hope you like it, and mainly you enjoy yourself
listening to this compilation of ours. --Miguel Barreto
