Guy Maddin's films almost defy description, since they're so surreal and just plain bizarre. Imagine a film that has the look of a German expressionist film of the 1920's combined with more modern themes and ideas and situations that are just out of left field, and there you ALMOST have it except for the fact that this doesn't really do it justice either. "Careful" is a film about a small town in the Alps where everyone has to be extra quiet so as not to provoke avalanches. Also thrown in are some incestuous thoughts, butler school, the ghost of a blind father who lost one eye as a baby to a "carelessly pinned broach" and the other to a cuckoo clock (that has a duck instead of a cuckoo), and almost too much else to describe. It has the look and feel of a film made in the 1920's (with color tinting, I think) and yet one never saw someone cut off their own fingers with pruning shears in any 1920's movie that i've ever seen. It's a love story, of sorts, but probably not exactly the most wholesome sort of love story. It's also sort of a comedy, but mostly of the dark variety. I don't know, I feel rather at a loss to describe most of Maddin's films, they're better if you just watch them & try to figure them out yourself. They are very compelling to watch, but you need a sense of adventure and humor to watch them. 8 out of 10 stars, most weird.

The torrent includes the film and Noam Gonick's "Waiting For Twilight," a documentary on Guy Maddin and the making of his "Twilight of the Ice Nymphs," narrated by Tom Waits.

My rip. By request. Enjoy!
