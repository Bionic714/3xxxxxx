,lizzers,2008-03-06T02:59Z,"it says there are 8 seeders, but on my torrent it is showing 0... can someone (or two) seed pls?"
,lizzers,2008-03-09T10:52Z,"DEAD TORRENT !

So much for 1:1, hey kids? "
[T],clownmonkey,2008-03-23T04:27Z,Not true!  I seed all my torrents.  Try again?
,treemosser,2008-04-16T00:07Z,This is awesome. I'm actually downloading this at a pretty good speed. Good to know people care about Guy Maddin. Keep it up!
,retirer,2008-12-04T11:15Z,"clownmonkey, you are quite wonderful.
Careful is one of the Maddins that I have not seen.
Thanks!!!"
,PenniesOS,2009-04-27T22:18Z,"Haha, interesting that this turns up on a search for Tom Waits."
,MonsieurBoner,2009-06-16T22:14Z,"I videoed this by mistake one night many years ago instead of ""Yojimbo"" and have always been curious about Maddin's stuff. If it's as weird as I remember, it should be fun! Thanks!"
