With 19 releases, 6 American and 3 European tours, one Lollapalooza tour, 3 videos, and 9 t-shirt designs under their belt, Tsunami brings you a 70-minute, 22-song compilation CD of their hard-to-find singles, b-sides and compilation tracks from 1991-1997. Pretty prolific for a band that squeezed tours and practices between the full-time fun of Simple Machines, day jobs, various side projects and bands, and a drummer finishing his college degree 460 miles away from the hometown of DC.
