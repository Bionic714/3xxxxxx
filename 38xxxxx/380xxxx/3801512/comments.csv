This comment has been approved by Keyno!"
,eNuffSaid,2007-09-10T08:55Z,Thanks again. Lovely stuff.
,redoxidus,2007-09-10T08:59Z,"Yeah! with 4x in business again...it's time for a party, so birng up the cheeks and pussies.

So, I REQUEST: a case of Beer for him! lololol

(btw, what happened to the Lionheert Buckert  x FS9? has it been released hier? ja oder nein? I can't see anywhere)"
,81hotrod,2007-09-10T15:30Z,"Thanks for this 4x! Ok, noob question.... I'll preface it by saying that I've spent the past few minutes trying to figure it out on my own. Where/What is WoS?"
,4X-AXG,2007-09-10T16:47Z,"haha WoS is a soon-to-be-history forum with FS addons..it's fair to say members are supposed to pay 6 bucks..after that the guy who collects the money purchases addons and shares them with everybody..he always claims the addons are 'purchased by' him and he neglects to inform people that he purchased them with their and not his money
oh well
fuck donating :)"
,N537JB,2007-09-10T21:37Z,"huh? What?

You don't like WoS, but yet you do a fake account there? huh? Hmm... I guess you'll be needing them in the end anyway, eh? (I guess you already made a fake account over there again lol) =)"
,4X-AXG,2007-09-10T22:41Z,huh? what fake account?
,N537JB,2007-09-11T14:15Z,Are you familiar with 'Sarah'? lmao.. :)
,4X-AXG,2007-09-11T14:42Z,"ehmm..yeah I am
Sarah (don't get too excited, not her real name) is one of my sisters..she's one of the very few females interested in FS actually..that's why she had an account at WoS..and since we all share the same IP..voila"
,eNuffSaid,2007-09-11T16:43Z,"Yes, WoS, that absolutely POINTLESS site if you want to get stuff for free.  Uploads are split into several files and uploaded at filesharing sites. You get only that much amount of data you can download from those sites, so by the time you've reached the 3rd file, the upload is removed from the file sharing sites. It's happend to me several times. Either that, or I lost track of which files to download, and quite that site all together.

Yes, you can pay $$$ for access to the VIP site, but then I'm thinking who is the thief; the downloaders or the guy charging money for STOLEN software.

WoS is utter crap. Forget that site. People come here spamming TPB by plugging WoS. It's obvious that site is in dire need of income. ROFLMAO."
,4X-AXG,2007-09-11T17:10Z,I mentioned my sister and there's yet no sign of panodilo? :D
,N537JB,2007-09-11T17:22Z,"Is she your sister? Huh? lmao.. so you're a girl or? Cos sometimes when I've been watching WF/WoS have I seen the both of you online..

Or wait, maybe you have 2 PC's? LMAO.. Try to fool yourself.

enuff, hm.. I've got 2 RAPIDSHARE Accounts (yes both premiums), paying NOTHING for them, also I've got VIP access there, but I never paid them. You see, by having contacts, many things can happen (which I doubt you'll never get)! ;-)"
,4X-AXG,2007-09-11T19:14Z,"that's what I said..multiple computers, one internet connection

and trust me, for a woman she makes great landings ;-)"
,N537JB,2007-09-11T19:59Z,Rite... As said earlier. Try to foold yourself ;-)
,4X-AXG,2007-09-11T20:50Z,"haha dude you've watched too many x-files episodes

but hey, I wonder what happened to fergie and ozzie at WF? LOL"
,N537JB,2007-09-11T21:13Z,"lmao..

Well, I guess you went bitching to the WF admins.. lol."
,4X-AXG,2007-09-11T21:55Z,you guessed wrong..again :)
,N537JB,2007-09-11T22:09Z,"soo.. again eh? So when you got all those addons, those weren't from WoS, or? lolol.. YOU got wrong..... AGAIN."
,4X-AXG,2007-09-11T22:42Z,I didn't get them from WoS no..can't access WoS remember? first you guys block/ban me and then you accuse me of downloading addons there? isn't that kinda contradictory?
,81hotrod,2007-09-12T13:38Z,where is wos? i can't find any address to it.
,N537JB,2007-09-12T15:03Z,"LOLYou can't access there? But your 'sister' called Sarah, with the same IP can?.. Hmm getting confused."
,4X-AXG,2007-09-12T19:16Z,"no I never said sarah could still access the site..it's very simple kiddo, first my account was blocked, and then somebody above 50 figured I was my sister (nasty shit though she's not bad lookin') since we had the same IP..so no, neither of us can access the site and neither of us can download stuff from it
so again, it doesn't make much sense to accuse me of downloading from WoS if they banned my IP"
,N537JB,2007-09-12T20:21Z,"kiddo? Who are you calling kiddo seriously? lmao.:

Aiight now listen. While that Sarah (you) was on WoS you uploaded TONS of stuffs, just for example, Airport Facilitator X, Flight Pyrenees Orientales BasePack. Since you were blocked, where did you get them? You're just getting more stupid for every day that goes in the world, boy.

btw, I'm not above 50 (Not even close to that LOL) ;-)"
,4X-AXG,2007-09-12T20:48Z,"I'm calling you a kiddo, kiddo

about those addons..I got them from all kinds of sources..websites/forums, friends, contacts, networks..it's very well possible that a few of those addons originated from WoS, never denied that..I just didn't download them from WoS..if you wish to believe everything I get my hands on is from WoS, you're both incredibly arrogant and stupid..WoS is just one of many sources out there and by far not the most important one, trust me

you're not over 50? I know you're confused, but don't confuse age and IQ boy"
,N537JB,2007-09-12T21:05Z,"So you have a Rapidshare Premium account why? To get stuff from WF? (WOW, Sarah, they really do release  THAT much stuff that hasn't been on the scene)

So, my IQ is 50 or what r u tryin 2 say? If so, I guess your IQ would be around 24 or so.. Atleast I've got higher than you do =D."
,4X-AXG,2007-09-12T21:14Z,"haha I'm not trying to say you're IQ is 50, you're overestimating yourself

and no I don't have a RS premium account, why do you think that?"
,4X-AXG,2007-09-12T21:29Z,"but hey folks, general question for everybody..

how's this scenery running for you? it's extremely tough on the frames at my computer"
,N537JB,2007-09-12T21:42Z,As said earlier... Contacts is the shiznit ;-)
,eNuffSaid,2007-09-12T23:07Z,"Hey N537JB,

Talking sh1t3 again? Next time try to pass your breath by your brain before you fart.

Thnx."
,4X-AXG,2007-09-13T00:08Z,"oh come on, give the kid some credit..he didn't make any anti-semite remarks at all today! that's an achievement!"
,eNuffSaid,2007-09-13T07:50Z,"owww... let me have some fun, please. :)"
,N537JB,2007-09-13T12:29Z,Am I making fun of myself? lol The only ones who are making fun of theirselves are for example jedithief and enuff... I guess 4x got some bitchboys =)
,eNuffSaid,2007-09-13T21:35Z,"I'd rather be 4X's bitch than yours. All you do here is bitch bitch bitch. 

I say booooooring."
,N537JB,2007-09-13T21:43Z,"All I do is bitching, but all you do is bitchboying ;-) Be his bitchboy, cuz I don't want you ;-)
