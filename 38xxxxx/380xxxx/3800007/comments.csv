,wille_jr,2007-11-19T01:04Z,"Well, the torrent was stuck around 9% (IIRC) for a good while, so it might actually finish sometime... Patience my friend.

As for subs, there ARE English subs, .srt files are included for each episode and they should load automatically if you use, for instance, directvobsub..."

,rev888,2007-11-27T14:02Z,"I'm currently seeding the 83% I have, and will continue to seed the entire file for months if I ever get it downloaded.  Why release a torrent if you're unwilling to seed?  Please seed!"

,swillis,2007-12-27T05:25Z,"Has anybody seeded yet ? Will this thing finish loading on my pc (I've put huge effort to get to 72% at this time and still going) ?   

As to being stuck at 99.9%, that means pretty much all but 1 or 2 files are complete. Isn't it possible then to watch 18 or 19 of the episodes, and download the missing ones seperately ?
