And sorry for my upload speed...not too good i know."
,HazeMan,2007-09-10T21:57Z,"I meant God's sake, not God sakes..."
,v4rdy,2007-09-10T22:44Z,i thought this required a key?
,HazeMan,2007-09-10T22:58Z,"This is not the BETA, this is the DEMO...like every other demo, it is meant to give you a taste of the full game so you'll buy it."
[T],Knaster,2007-09-10T23:27Z,This game will most likely suck
,bcap,2007-09-11T02:05Z,Im at 80% now. I have a bad upload (max 30kbps) but will seed till ratio 2.0
,seedbitchimnotgonna,2007-09-11T03:32Z,I have a monster system but even if i set everything at highest possible settings graphics looks old. Gameplay is good though and innovative for an online game. Really wish game would have used ut3 engine that would have made it a top game now ill pass.  
,blaffe,2007-09-11T13:00Z,this sucks... to much battlefield spirit about it :( and the strogg's just sound silly xD
,Gonzalesss,2007-09-12T18:54Z,"Yeah , this game sucks big time... BF2 is better"
,Dannevafan-,2007-09-14T12:16Z,shit guys! seeed!!! ill uppload like hell ones im ready!
,marcusn,2007-09-30T00:52Z,"if you like hardcore shooters with much blasts and explosions this is the game for you!

but it is not well-balanced and has no feel to it like Battlefield 2. for an example the vehicles are a total disastre when u drive them."
