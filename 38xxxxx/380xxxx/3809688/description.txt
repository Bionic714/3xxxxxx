Though Villa-Lobos was responsible for introducing
Brazilian rhythms and folk music to the world of classical
music, it was neatly packaged in a style he had absorbed
during the time he spent in Paris as a young man. That is
particularly true of his piano music, for while he wrote
large-scale orchestral works, he is a miniaturist at the
keyboard, the more substantial scores constructed from a
number of short movements. Though the works on this disc
cover 15 years, they form part of his early period, and
were cast in the form of pictures. From a leisurely
Brazilian look at the Waltz in Tristorosa from 1910,
through to the Ciclo Brasileiro completed in 1936, we can
enjoy music largely unknown on the international circuit.
This is the third volume in Sonia Rubinsky's cycle of
Villa-Lobos, its international acclaim well-merited. She
handles the music's technical demands so easily that you
are unaware they exist. The recording, made in Canada, has
captured a most natural and pleasing piano tone.
