I thought I would upload this as it looked quite interesting. This is an animator, designed especially for use with mobile phones (and I presum other portable devices?) Looks to be quite easy to use, and from a few of the demo?s I saw, the output looked quite nice.

Build rich content for mobile phones today. Start by creating graphics using industry-standard applications like Adobe Illustrator and CorelDRAW. Then take advantage of Animator?s easy-to-learn interface to create animations, user interfaces, multimedia messages, and much more. With a broad installation base for Ikivo SVG Players, you can count on a large audience for your content.
