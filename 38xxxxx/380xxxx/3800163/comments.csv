why do I even bother?"
,frehleythunders,2007-11-07T19:28Z,maybe cause you know people love JT and are just kinda lazy?? Sad but true..BTW...most of your JT stuff here freezes at like 95.3%...and would GLADLY SEED if the damn things would UPLOAD ALL THE WAY..but that could be just my luck..any advice?
