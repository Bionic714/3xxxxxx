Ok, so i thought this was a really good type of waffle everyone should learn how to make. 100% sure this isn't starcraft : bw.  If it was, the missions wouldn't work, but skirmish and lan/vpn network play would most likely be very useful.  Plus if that were to happen, there would have to be many proz maps and replayz from teh BoXeR.  Even some of my own for teh noobs.  Honestly, REALLY GOOD WAFFLES that you could start making right now, cuz if it werent, you'd have to start it via BW Launcher...
