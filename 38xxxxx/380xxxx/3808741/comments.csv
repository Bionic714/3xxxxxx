This for every aspiring Chemist and pharmacist or just people who like to laugh, there is no other game ever made like this. Mix real chemicals using real lab equipment etc but so much more.

first unzip file
then unrar multirar files
now you have an iso
use poweriso or alcohol 120% to mount disk
preferably burn it to a CD disk at this point
either way run ""setup.exe"" 
remember the folder it installs to, an go there
in the sierra folder then the FPFPCDW folder
in here you will find sierraw.exe
right click on sierraw then click the upper TAB labeled ""compatibility"" 
now select or put a check next to:
  win95 mode
  run in 256 colors
  run in 640x480
  click apply and/or OK

you should be good to go but 
LEAVE the CD in the drive or the iso mounted
when you play, 
the GAME WILL NOT TELL YOU TO
this is so you have voices instead of TEXT only

depending on your computer,
to make it play in a LARGER WINDOW
you may have to right click on your desktop
select properties
select settings on upper tab
set your resolution to 640x480
if you can't select the next lowest!
800x600  then click apply and/or OK

now it will play right on XP in a decent window for you, play with disk mounted or in drive!
it will run without the disk, but with TEXT ONLY

IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT!
YOU MUST HAVE : The Modern Day Book of Health and Hygiene

it contains the chemical formula's you need to make certain potions and pharmacological concoctions, there's also other hilarious content.

find that here:

This is a true masterpiece and classic in every sense, and it's a shame there is no modern hi-res sequel. 

Everyone should play this game at least once in their lifetime.

Once again thank you boilman I could only afford/find  the  3.5 diskette version in 1994
which have since degraded since they are magnetic media. This should be listed in the top 100 games of all time if not the top 25!!
