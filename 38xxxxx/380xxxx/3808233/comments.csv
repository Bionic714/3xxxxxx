download the HOMM5 .dmg file from[url]http://freeverse2.cachefly.net/Mac/Heroes/82hd04nau26vueh6129oe6gx/HeroesOfMightAndMagicV.dmg[url]

then download the crack from the listed crack torrent which I've put up.

then download the V1.5 patch from the apple website.

put them all in a folder titled HeroesOfMightAndMagicV (no spaces, with same capitalization) and you'll be a seeder in no time."

,harshd,2009-10-31T15:02Z,"SIMPLE GUIDE FOR ALL MAC OS 10.5.x versions - I am on 10.5.8 so I am assuming this will work for all previous versions as well.

We just have to follow ""razultull"" instructions which I am copying below with slight modifications:


1. follow step one of what RomanSPQR (torrent author)

2. if the crack doesnt work, you need to downlaod ipatch, click on show package contents (after rightclicking) then go to contents>resources>ipatch. Youll see a unix executable file. Should be 212 kb.

*******************************
MODIFIED - Most probably the crack wont work as we have all upgraded from Tiger - to Leopard or maybe Snow Leopard for some. So you MUST download ipatch from www.ipatch.org - Its FREE.
Copy this Application to any folder on your computer. 

Now click on show package contents (after right-clicking) on ""ipatch"" then go to contents>resources>ipatch. 

AFTER

contents>resources>ipatch (small icon) - (which is a small icon - application)
show package contents on this small one again then
contents>macOS>ipatch THIS IS THE UNIX EXEC FILE SHOULD BE 212 kb.
********************************

3. Open show package content in crack icon (after pasting it in the file location of heroes V app), then Contents > MacOS > ipatch. (208kb)

MODIFIED
********************************
Now paste the Crack file in the same folder where you have saved the HOMM application.
Now, follow step 3 as outlined above.
********************************

4. THen replace this shit with the new one, yea? (the 212 kb one) .....kk 

5. Now run the crack.

6. Update the game and enjoy..........my minions.

7. So far so good.

8..yea its done now..

However the above guide is vague and in some respects - WRONG. Ipatch isn't free, but you can get a working crack for it here (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4644894/iPatch_3.7.1_Crack_only)

The Unix exec file is called ipatcher not ipatch, and on my system at least is 217k not 212k.

The most important thing is, what files do you paste where? What does this mean:-

*************
Open show package content in crack icon (after pasting it in the file location of heroes V app), then Contents > MacOS > ipatch. (208kb)
*************

Do you paste ipatcher here?

We really need proper instructions."
,NordWing,2009-12-30T17:59Z,"harshd>>
Hey, maybe I can entice you to create the file and then upload it?"
,jjallen,2009-12-31T15:01Z,"Okay, I have worked out what the problem is for Snow Leopard users. The crack was made with an old version of Ipatch. To get it to work, you have to replace the ipatcher application inside the cracked no SN file, with the ipatcher application from the latest iPatch version.

If this sounds confusing, iPatch is the name of the application that creates patch files for applications. It has a GUI which runs a smaller terminal application called ipatcher.app. Ipatcher.app is inside the Ipatch.app file. Ipatcher.app does all the actual work.

The crack isn't working because it uses an old version of ipatcher.app. You need to replace this file with the newest version.

To do this, go through the following procedure:-

**** Install HOMM V ****
Install the v1.4 version from here.

****Get the latest version if iPatcher****
Download iPatch using the link above. Use the Piratebay link, it's NOT free. 

Install iPatch.

**** Extract the latest ipatcher.app file ****
Go to iPatch and right click on the application (on my system it's called 'iPatch cracked') and select 'Show package contents'.
A new Finder window will open with a folder named 'Contents'. You need to use Finder to go through the folder structure to >Contents>Resources>iPatcher.

Richt click on this, go through the folder structure again and find the following file:-
>Contents>MacOs>ipatcher.app

Copy this file to your desktop. This is the file that you need to replace inside the v1.4 No SN crack.

**** Copy ipatcher.app to the crack file ****
Paste the Heroes of Might and Magic V NoSN.app into the >Applications folder

Right click the above file and select 'Show package contents'.

Navigate through the folder to:-
>Heroes of Might and Magic V NoSN.app>Contents>MacOs
This will contain a file called ipatcher.app

Copy the latest ipatcher.app from your desktop into the above folder, replacing the existing ipatcher.app file in >Heroes of Might and Magic V NoSN.app>Contents>MacOs

This replaces the file that causes the crack not to work in Snow Leopard. 

**** Run the noSN crack file ****

This fixes the problem and removes the serial number request."
,adamruss,2010-01-02T17:09Z,"i have snow leopard.

i follow'd everyone's instructuons:
- fixed the crack
- crack the 1.4
- patch to 1.5
- saved the freeverse framework file
- patch to 1.5.1 (which told me that the game is still 1.4 ?! why?)
- put back the cracked framework file

NOTHING WORKED! ARGH!!! at any stage, the game did not start, or it asked for a serial, or it just didnt do anything.

anyone got this working on snow leopard 10.6.2?"
,NordWing,2010-01-02T18:19Z,"adamruss>> I have the same problem and have tried a little of everything, therefore I hope for a wiser person can help upload a crack that working with snow leopards SOME ONE!?!?! =)"
,matsfojo,2010-01-03T11:21Z,"when a open the crack and click on select Heroes of might and magic V_App, what program am i suposed to open it with? it doesent work with the gamefile in app."
,adamruss,2010-01-05T11:00Z,"OK!
anyone having problems running this after the crack/patch:

if your home dir (specificlly ~/Library) is on a fat32 partition the game will not run. needs to be on a mac partition"
,Yoss7,2010-01-16T10:19Z,"No, iPatch isn't free, but you don't need a registered copy to extract the UNIX executable to fix the Heroes 1.4 crack.

Works fine for me!"
,Yoss7,2010-01-16T10:23Z,"Btw, updating to 1.51 breaks the crack. It works fine with the included 1.50 update, but the 1.51 reverts to asking for a serial number.

Curiously, both updates detect the application as being at 1.4, whether you're at 1.4, 1.5, or 1.51. Weird."
,Yoss7,2010-01-17T02:20Z,"It crashes on me just as I finish the third map of the campaign, the one with the two towns. Does anyone have any idea why this is or how it can be fixed?"
,Yoss7,2010-01-17T14:14Z,"Backing up the freeverse lib file, updating to 1.51, and replacing the new lib file with the backed up one *does* preserve the crack, but my game still crashes after that one map. Maybe if I start over..."

Steps:

I am installing Heroes by dragging an icon to the application folder, then I should crack this game, but how? I am right clicking to show the contents but still I don't know what to paste into this folder."
,marjozz,2011-04-25T18:37Z,maybe i can help you if you tell me witch folder/icon you drag to the program folder!
,Johnnyjn,2011-05-02T11:06Z,"after 1 week i finally figured out how to install it and its quite easy (new to mac)
so.... if you have snow leopard 10.6.7 this is how you do it in baby steps
1 download the game 
2 load the image
3 drag and drop the heroes icon in the application folder (this is how you avoid the cd key problem)
4 after you finish with that don't run patch/crack 
 download this crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6179381/Heroes_Of_Might_And_Magic_1.5_Crack_(working)
5 run this crack and select the heroes 5 directory(witch should be in application or where ever you copied it)
6 after this run the 1.5 patch 
7 and voilla it will work 

IF this dosent work then you should go and just buy the game cause your case is hopeless 

Hope this helps!
and does anyone know if the expansions are out for mac?"
