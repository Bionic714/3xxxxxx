,michaelrwatson,2008-09-04T04:59Z,"It *looks* like this one has subtitles for the foreign parts--which is good because there are numerous sequences where they're speaking Arabic and American Indian. Let's face it, most of these are English movies being watched by English speakers. (The other rip [695 MB one] indexed on isohunt.com does NOT have subs and is utter crap.) Keeping fingers crossed for BoBo...."
,bobo_igor,2008-09-07T03:15Z,"Yes i made an extra effort and filtered the english subtitels for bad hearing people so i became subtitles for only the non-english parts.

Enjoy"
,MikeQuest3,2008-10-21T11:13Z,"Hello
Thanks for uploading & to those who are seeding
This is a great movie I wonder why so few are interested in this movie....
A great print both audio & video are good the subtitles (for non eng) are incomplete thou, a nice choice for download.

,murf0411,2009-11-03T14:44Z,"hey great copy but there is subtitles missing when the aribs are speaking, is there a copy with the english subs in it?"
,arcanus55,2010-01-13T06:51Z,"Downloading now at 1.2 kb/s, for the love of god people SEED!"
,206andy206,2010-03-19T11:05Z,"I don't like the fact that you put ""English subtitles for Hidalgo[2004]DvDRip[Eng]-BoBo"" in the .srt file so it shows up in the movie, its a bit pointless, people already know what they downloaded... Movie isn't great quality anyway.

A:6
