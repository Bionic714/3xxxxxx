,THE-REVIEW,2008-12-06T18:47Z,"-----------------

Quality is between 240kbps and 260kbps on average

When adding songs to iTunes, U2 appears in front of EVERY song name! NOT FUN :(

Thanks anyway Bluemoonin!
----------------"
,THE-REVIEW,2008-12-06T18:51Z,"----------------

To get rid of U2 infront of song names, removed the songs from
my library.
Then i ONLY added the songs to the library

So, besides being able to just drag the entire folder, a good torrent!!!
