,RUSKYUK,2007-09-29T21:37Z,Cheers just got told by someone else all you do is double click the reg file winp and it installs itself all you do is click on the yes buttons.
,Imdrivin,2007-11-03T18:07Z,Does info plus  work as well ?
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-18T00:09Z,Yes I have used this version for a little bit now and I have been able to connect to plus info and have all of the plus features. I have been a loyal winpatrol user since day 1 and have bought there software before. I will not run a computer without it. I have never gotten spyware (that I know of) and this program makes it really easy to manager your PUP's and BHO's. Also it's great for commanding your services and browser addons. Good Luck thanks ANTJE14
