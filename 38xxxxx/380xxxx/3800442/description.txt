I installed this thinking it was going to be another crappy start-up program editor, with a few little extras. What I found was that this tool does exactly what it says, and does it well. It finds hidden files, BHO (and the like), as well as editing your start-up programs. I am running a bit short on time so I will leave it at that.

WinPatrol uses a heuristic behavioural approach to detecting attacks and violations of your computing environment. Traditional security programs scan your hard drive searching for previously identified threats. WinPatrol takes snapshot of your critical system resources and alerts you to any changes that may occur without your knowledge. You?ll be removing dangerous new programs while others prepare to update their definition/signature data files.
