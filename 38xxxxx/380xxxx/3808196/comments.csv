,Frink1234,2007-09-16T14:54Z,Hmmm...my AVG says Obfustat.JWW virus in Keygen.
,(FUQ)TheDrizzle,2007-12-09T00:49Z,this is fake . virus in keygen ! 
,montecristo1,2008-04-14T19:27Z,"Please keep in mind that some AV give false positives. I scanned with NOD32- found no threats. So installed and it works. The keygen provides a working serial number. You can also download the free version with out the perks here http://www.solveigmm.com/?Products&p=AVITrimmer
Good freeware program. FYI- uninstall AVITrim if you have it before installing Solveig Splitter- it will not let you register it."
,montecristo1,2008-04-14T19:28Z,FYI: AVG sucks- gives too many false positives... switch to Nod32 or Kaspersky 7- you're missing out on great software.
,T2G,2008-05-27T08:28Z,Trend Micro PC-cillin Internet Security 2007 (8.710.1002/5.299.00) also detects trojan in the keygen. Be very careful if downloading this torrent!
,Randal2,2008-08-18T14:50Z,"its probably a virus because it doesn't work (got an error message).

there aint no keygen"
,TheHumungous,2008-08-28T16:54Z,"montecristo1, that is 100% bullshit, because my NOD picked this up immediately as a virus, though not the name that other poster's AVG called it. Mine shows it as Win32AgentTrojan, or whatever. Nevertheless, it IS picking it up. So either you are lying, or just have some really old ass NOD version.

What is sad about this, is this app is definitely the best vid splitter available right now. The only thing it lacks is MPG-1 support (which is odd, because supports MPG-2). The developer said he is going to add that in about 1-2 months, and also AVC/x264/MKV support. Then it will be the best one out there.

Everyone ive tried, and believe me, i tried alot (xilisoft, ultra video splitter, speed splitter, boilsoft video splitter, zealot all video splitter, super video splitter, aurora media workshop, absolute video splitter). They all either require you to re encode to the same or another format (fucking retarded that is), have distorted or garbled images after split, or the player in the actual prog lags or plays them in slow motion because their built-in decoders are crap.

Anyways, i have a junk/test pc that im going to run this keygen on and see what happens. Ill note the key (if it even runs) and then enter it on here. Furthermore, there is a new version out (March 08, v2.0) and it supports mpg2, and soon mpg-1 and other shit will have support as well. Im hoping the key will work in this 2.0 version.

Very little is known of this app, but i highly recommend you guys use it. Only gripe is how you need to 'mark' the area of splitting, it wont do it until you 'delete' the other fragments (in blue) that are not marked, then you have to highlite the area (in orange) that you want split. Other than that, its fantastic.

One last, cant you fuckmooks test shit better when you upload things? Stop using 'Johnny Dumbasses Virus and Malware Detector', and install something like NOD, Kaspersky or Bitdefender, ffs."
,peter07,2009-07-05T00:34Z,"Well i agree totaly with TheHumungous..
This Splitter is so easy and fast to use its worth the god damn money hands down. Stop being such tight-asses and lend some cash to the broke-ass developers of this sweet-ass product..
(i dont work on solveigMM..)
Why do people upload virus and trojans to tpb.
Cant some of you hackers out there track the ip number of this fool ayaname and send the info to me. That guy needs some BAD-ASS JAILSTYLE treatment
If the trojan/virus was inserted by a 3rd party im sorry for that last comment. I HATE THESE FUCKING VIRUS-SPREADING IDIOTS..."
,Ralphski,2009-12-22T10:20Z,"Try this one:

,mrpunk50,2010-09-23T16:57Z,"Avira Antivirus detects trojans in pretty much every keygen it looks it. I suspect they're all false positives. In this case I'm not too desperate for the software so I wont risk it. 

@peter07: congrats on managing to utilise ""tight-ass"", ""broke-ass"", ""sweet-ass"" and ""bad-ass"" all in the space of a few sentences! :D
