Comment from IMDB:

Good lord, this show is good. It\'s thought provoking. Really, so many of the decisions made are poor, so many of the characters do fairly rancid things. But you can\'t help loving them and you can\'t help loving the plots. I\'ve fallen in love with every member of the Botwin family. This is a smart, very funny, sexy and sophisticated show. I\'m not going to summarize anything here because I\'m sure people are aware of the premise.

It sounds like it could be ho-hum, but you must see it- each episode, people are dealing the characters deal with difficult decisions. Sometimes there\'s deliberation, sometimes there\'s regret- the show\'s smart enough where it assumes we know what the \"right thing\" was that one should have done. Most often, the characters don\'t do that right thing, and yet we love them, maybe even think \"I would have done that.\" This is a show that basically says, beneath the normalcy, everyone is pushed to the limit in some way. It\'s no where near as dark as \"Twin Peaks,\" but somehow, without the freakiness/fear, it reminds me of it because it\'s intelligent and it shows what lies beneath a bit.

When you watch it, watch out for Shane Botwin who is the Id of the show, and Andy, his grown up version who I personally hate yet am totally charmed by.

Ah, and yes, the acting is superb.
