One of the later entries in the notorious Guinea Pig series, Android of Notre Dame is much more tame than its reputation would have you believe. Basically a low budget, shot-on-video rehash of Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator (1985), it tells the story of a dwarf scientist who conducts experiments on dead bodies in hope of finding the cure to his sister's deadly (but unnamed) disease. Most of the film is taken up with the dwarf experimenting on the decapitated head of his corrupt corporate sponsor, which he keeps alive in a elaborate machine.
