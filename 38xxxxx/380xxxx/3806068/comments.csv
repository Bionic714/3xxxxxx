,mycarrion2,2007-09-15T03:44Z,"I remember one called Horror at Party Beach my parents let me watch on Creature Features in the 70's.  Been a ""B"" movie junkie since that night.

It was kind of a cross between the Creature from the Black Lagoon and my ex-wife's vagina after spitting out two kids.  It scared the crap outta me(the vagina).

Hope to find that flick someday...

Thanks again, Frank!"

the movie you're referring to is titled 'Shockwaves', featuring Peter Cushing.............def a classic and hard to find!"
,mycarrion2,2007-09-15T22:29Z,I found it quite easily.  Must be a lucky day for me.  ;)
,Sicrea,2007-12-16T23:10Z,"I pledge guilty , i have download a few hundreds of movies; buy hey..., how haven`t ?.

Initialy i went after the good stuff and the best movies arround but after the high speed inet and the dirt cheap DVD-r; i get download more and more unknow stuff.

Damm some stuff are realy bad, Frank have upload a lot of shitty stuff. This one sucked ass and is not because is FFF porn.

Battlefiel earth?; why don`t just burn the cash in  a bonfire; would be much fun to watch.

Killer Tomatoes?. When your 3 year old niece say ""is a stupid movie"" you are shure is a stupid movie.

Gigli: If a girl askme me into seeing a  movie like this; I'll just fuck and dump her.

Jaws, revange: I prefer be eat by a shark than see this piece of shit, is a lot less painful.

Etcetera, I like a B class movies  but in this... The sountrack is lifted from other movies, the continuity is atrocious, The special effects---oh dear God, the latex is peeling off in the middle of a take, green face zombies have pink hands. The history is stupid and completely lacking in logic EVEN for a Zombie movie

I mean, how hard is it to get a movie about Nazis, Rapist Zombies and Naked ladies right? and in a infested pond?.

Is the worst movie ever made.

Worst than your uncle`s vacations tapes"

,H2Kzero,2009-12-16T10:43Z,Actually I am just messing mrblotto is right.
