,ChrizD,2008-05-15T22:34Z,"what do you mean ""only track 3 has vocals""?
so does track 5, 8 and 10!"

The vocals suck, Apocalyptica is at its best without vocals

And thanks for the upload!"

Great torrent - thanks cholo24!!! :D 100%

Also, it isn't just track 3 with vocals!?! Are you deaf MachineGun_187!?!

But even if it was without any vocals, Apocalyptica are amazing & don't bloody need them!!! :P
(But it is especially cool that they have Till from Rammstein in ""Helden""!)"
