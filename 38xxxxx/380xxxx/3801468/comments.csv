,Verwandlung-,2007-10-30T12:01Z,"Interesting , but not seeded unfortunately."
,igorce,2007-10-30T17:00Z,You can download it from eMule.
,reisinger,2007-12-21T05:13Z,This REALLY works. I used to suffer from chronic anxiety and panic attacks and this eliminated it completely. I am downloading it now for other people to use who I know suffer with this. 
,ppierce,2008-04-04T08:47Z,"Yeah, I gotta say that this does work. It may take some time, but you will start seeing the interval of feeling normal between panic attacks increase. 

Just remember that when the panic comes again, that this does not destroy how far you've come, it is normal and it's just a little speed bump along the way to being well again."
,Informante,2008-04-26T01:57Z,"I just started learning how to become a NLP instructor for personal needs, and hell ive become a lot better, i just need to get the fucking clonezepam (typo) out of my system, please tell me, does anyone know if this will somehow crash with what i have learned at the NLP school so far? Any help is accepted with gratitude :D."
,Heqq,2008-06-04T13:52Z,"So, i hope this works for social anxiety, i'm desperate"
,ponkass,2008-08-19T19:26Z,"Does anyone know what pack from their official site this is? Is it the DL version?

,rikardpah,2009-01-03T23:23Z,"it seems that the The-Linden-Method-Manual.pdf is password protected, anybody solved that?"
,jamesmorgan1,2009-01-28T23:42Z,Password is Linmet28 I think dude.
,toothpick_massacre,2009-02-06T01:48Z,"cant wait to start thanks for the up load.
only thing it says to listen to....
 ?Meta Mnemonic Programming? CD before each session.'
Is that missing?"
,Apl3x,2009-02-06T15:54Z,"OMG! Thank you so much! I was about to buy the same book for 70$ :O
"
,Apl3x,2009-02-07T01:57Z,"IMPORTANT!!!!!


For those of you that can't play the video in the downloading folder, you must use RealPlayer!!!!"
,Elmacoo,2009-03-07T16:27Z,Does this work for Social Anxiety?
,frenchguy707,2009-04-01T19:39Z,"This works amazingly well !
I downloaded it last week and already feel better. There is hope for ALL OF US.

I have the same questions as a few of you guys ...  Charles talks about a subconscious-opening CD to listen to before each session. Is that one missing ?
Also the Linden Method download version is supposed to have 16 sound tracks. Sounds like we are missing 6 here ?
The other printed versions you can buy online have 7 CDs. Anyone knows what's on them ?
Thanks !

Ang again ... just listening over and over to what you can download here you will start seeing the end of the tunnel soon ..."
,bobspez,2009-04-19T03:53Z,"To view the video you need to install the indeo legacy video codec.  This is because windows no longer has the codec.  Once you install it by running the downloaded iv5seteup.exe file you can view the video with the windows media player. The legacy codec is free at this link:

,flapcats,2009-04-30T13:27Z,"Hi there - I have a hacky solution for the video problem. The Indeo installer failed on vista, so I UPLOADED THE VIDEO TO YOUTUBE as a 'private' video - I can watch it there or download it with flashgot as an FLV."
,Sharonkaypenmanenman,2009-06-12T11:40Z,Isn't this supposed to have 16 audio books
,Tekita235,2009-06-12T20:39Z,Is this virus free?
,setonfire,2010-02-02T18:09Z,Thanks a lot!
,Lucas1233,2010-02-27T00:09Z,Pass word protected on one of the pdf;s ? :(
,AmoThePirate,2010-07-06T14:41Z,"I solved the video Dilemma,

Rename the video extension to .rm instead of .avi and the video will play in VLC!"
,tundri,2010-08-09T03:59Z,Thanks a lot for sharing OceanAnon. Really appreciating this. God Bless you all.
,mephimort,2010-12-06T20:02Z,"if it works n u have money, go buy! :D"
,mephimort,2010-12-06T22:11Z,"audio file 03 - The Visualization, the audio quality is reaaaally bad..not good coz this cd u need to concentrate...any chance for better audio..thanks anyway!"
,CharlesLinden12345,2011-06-27T19:48Z,"What is wrong with you people. Whilst I sleep, people download my programme (which won't help them in isolation because 3/4 of it is missing) and take money from us whilst I work 17 hour days to TRY to create enough income to help more and more people legitimately.... This stinks folks. You probabbly all think you are very clever but you are stealing from other anxious people that I can't reach because you are sapping the funds that allows me to reach out to them. My team are qualified specialists... would you steal from a hospital or clinic. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. The Linden Method won't work if you download it from here because MOST of the important material and guidance is missing. Also, you are breaking the law! Charles Linden"
,jdkeates,2011-11-03T22:00Z,"This is really good, just knowing the first view facts in the first section really! helps, i see charles linden commenting saying this is wrong to download here, and i think anxiety isnt something you can put a price on, at all."
