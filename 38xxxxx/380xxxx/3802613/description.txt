
Another one I got from the newsgroups. 
http://www.slyck.com/ng.php


When searching the web I found thru www.packetnews.com that episodes 1-13 are currently available in irc
on EFNET,
Channel: #xtv
bot [xtv]ny_

and http://torrent-finder.com shows that they are also already in torrentland, but at www.torrentzilla.org, a private site.
If anyone wants to grab them from irc or torrent to bring them public that would be great otherwise I may try to get some more myself. Only 3 ep's were posted to usenet but if the other ones get uploaded I'll try to grab them from there.
I'll start with these 3 anyway, all help to get the other episodes is appreciated.
Search this site to get the .torrent files for eps 1-3 and possibly others in the future or see
