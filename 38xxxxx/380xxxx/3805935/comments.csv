Devil May Cry follows the adventures of the demon hunter Dante who himself is half demon and half human. Dante is hired through his own business named ""Devil May Cry"". The characters are based off of the popular capcom playstation 2 games."
,yeehaa,2007-09-14T15:40Z,Help me seeding. I won't be seeding forever. Atm there is only me seeding and 31 leechers. Comon guys!
,jebuss,2007-09-15T18:26Z,I cant seem to get a seed
,jebuss,2007-09-15T18:26Z,I cant seem to get a seed
,yeehaa,2007-09-15T20:55Z,That is because I cannot seed all the time and everyone else doesn't seem to give a shit about seeding after they downloaded.
,yeehaa,2007-09-19T01:54Z,"Nice, finally some ppl noticing this torrent :)"
,sinthason,2007-09-21T20:41Z,this thing has virus..
,yeehaa,2007-09-24T02:44Z,No it hasn't. Stop spreading lies about my torrent. Some virusprogram might think there is potential harmful objekts in it...but like we all know. They are often wrong.

,yeehaa,2007-10-04T12:05Z,"No, it hasn't been dubbed to english yet :P And frankly I don't know if it ever will be."

,aztec15,2007-11-15T11:20Z,i am downloding in 8 kb/s and uploading in 1mb/s so its a pretty slow torrent i think
,Nahawen,2007-12-04T01:01Z,Anyone know a way to get Episodes 10 and 12 that are not by FANCHAOS? Their translations are horrid. x_x
,DannOrly,2007-12-28T10:03Z,"Even though some of the fansubs are horrid and ep 12 bugged out (AHHHHH), just click here to watch it:

Thank you so much for compiling and uploading this, yeehaa. I truly appreciate it."

,uwer,2007-12-30T04:18Z,Seed plz
,yeehaa,2008-01-13T13:54Z,"Np, tried to seed for along time. But i just cannot be arsed anymore, since people are just stealing the torrentfile...putting it up on other sites as ""theirs"" :P 

I'm glad you enjoyed it tho :)"
,yeehaa,2008-01-13T13:56Z,And i don't know why episode 12 isn't working for some of you guys. Worked fine for me. I'm using K-Lite Codec Pack and DivX along with VLC player. I'll check if i got the episode somewhere and maybe upload it. Stay tuned!
,Alexxxx,2008-01-20T16:38Z,"Ep12 doesn't work for me either and I'm using VLC along with the latest codecs. Also tried in WMP, didn't work.

And I agree FANCHAOS kind of sucks :P Horrible spelling and translation.

But thanks alot for this one :)"
,free_highway,2008-01-29T16:12Z,"plz seed i know you are seeding but if you could seed alittle more it would be very great

,zyrian,2008-12-05T16:29Z,"Thanks a lot yeehaa
sweet anime!"
,Insurgent84,2009-02-19T09:49Z,"Good stuff! 

My only grief is that the files are named weirdly, which makes my computer sort them out of order. Something like 4-5-6, 1-2-3, 7-8-9-10-11-12. They are numbered, though, so just rename them.

The files seem to be from different fansub or rip sources."
,pessoa93,2010-01-04T23:05Z,"yeehaa...

thanks"
,pessoa93,2010-01-04T23:07Z,"but episode 12 sucks

check Utube: devil may cry anime episode 12
if u can't wait 
;)
or please upload episode 12"
,SnoBaer,2010-10-10T10:54Z,"Good quality. Unfortunately, the series as a whole isn't very uniform due to the translation done by different subgroups. Also, note that the subs are hard-coded, meaning you cannot turn them off. This isn't a big issue but for some it might be.

Thanks for the upload."
