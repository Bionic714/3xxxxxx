I know the music from The Bonzo Dog (Da-Da or Doo-Da) Band is not exactly recent, but they digitally re-mastered their music and brought it out again. I thought it would be a nice tribute to Neil Innes and Vivian Stanshall to list the satirical song that that famous band uses for their name.
Kat Deluna doesn't really belong in this list, but her album is really well made and that is more than you can say of the albums from Fiction Plane and PJ Harvey. I think I got the only two most decent songs. I.m.h.o. it's the albums from Super Furry Animals and Bowerbids that deserve most praise.
