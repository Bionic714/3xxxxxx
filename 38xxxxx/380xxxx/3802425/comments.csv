Answer for your question:
Extract keys to your desktop or anywhere you want them to be.
After this, open Kaspersky, go to Activation, press Install Key, Select 'Apply existing license key' Option, click Next, Browse, go to your folder where you placed your Keys and select one, hit 'Open'.
Now your Kaspersky Anti-Virus software should be Activated.


Any more questions?
Just ask.

,BadSubject,2007-11-24T23:29Z,"ConChimBayXa
Yes I do,
I am releasing them probally soon.
But before that I recommend you to do what
eilly said;
Delete the old key,
then install the new key.
Use the second key for sure.
Should work now."

,aqwxsz2,2007-11-28T01:31Z,"Hello BadSubject

Thanks you for your torrent and your keys but unfortunately all those keys (from june 2007) are blacklisted. :(

By the way, I also got a similar copy of your work on emule ;)

It should be great if you could release others keys or better: post a keygen because I suppose your new keys will be ok but for how long?

This is the real problem, using licence keys and the program connect on the server to see if your key is genuine or not. One day or another, the key got blacklisted.

Anybody heard about a keygen or a crack that would avoid us to enter a key?

Thanks you. :)"
