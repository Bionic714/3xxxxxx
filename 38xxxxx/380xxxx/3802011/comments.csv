,rogard,2007-09-10T18:17Z,"@kidnice

Well that's the whole point here: I try to avoid to download torrents that look suspicious. Who know who is behind that. might be mpaa or whatnot.
Thing is, if somebody has 2 torrents with different names but exact same size, this IS supicious, and don't tell me otherwise. 
The Name is clearly wrong, there is no sign of a Xanax CAM of this Film on any Release site I visited. So if the names are wrong, the rest might be wrong as well by evidence. I rest my case.

Apart from that, you did not heed my advice, and other people are free to do the same. Often enough I am right, and i hope I help people be more aware and cautious of fakes. That's what this is about. nuff said."
,rogard,2007-09-10T18:32Z,"lol, I just read Kidnice's posting again...so I am responsible for poor kiddies downloading the ""real fakes""? lmao rofl. Thank you, sir, you just saved my day..... :-)"
,paulsmedia,2007-09-10T22:27Z,To rogard - if you can read you will notice that yes there are two torrents the same size but one is a vcd and one is xvid. that is the differance uploaders are giving us a choice as some people still like the outdated vcd shit. nuff said yer not right this time

,doodad,2007-09-12T05:59Z,This fucking thing is either fake or was messed up when converting to XvID. It can't be opened with either media player or mounted with Power ISO. Don't bother goddammit!
,dirtyodesertdog,2007-09-13T10:27Z,Just like doodad says.Dont wast your time downloading this.Ive also tryed to mount and burn.Nothing seems to work. 
,techfella,2007-09-13T19:42Z,"Burning was a little tricky, I burned directly from the .bin files with Nero"
,AdDonahue,2007-09-15T06:51Z,"One down side with burning with Nero, it's not compatiable with everyones DVD players"
,English_Steve,2007-09-22T20:22Z,"I'm no amateur and have tried everything to convert this bastard. No joy, it's either corrupted or fake. I've tried VCDGear, Power ISO, Nero and none have worked. If I'm missing something or anybody has any ideas please post!"
,mgdspirit,2007-09-26T04:21Z,same as below. fubar bin/cue. thanks for nothing. 
,SpringareG7,2007-09-27T23:59Z,"Vad är det här för dynga?

Det går inte att öppna och jag undrar vad f-n det är som driver folk att lägga upp ren skit för att få andra att tro att det här går att ladda ner!?

Med andra ord - vad är det för idioter - det här är inte första och tyvärr inte sista gången - som lägger ut rent felaktiga filmer. Bara för att jävlas eller? Människan är uppenbarligen ett jävla ont djur i grunden!!!

Idioter! Kan inte sammanfatta det på annat sätt. Vad f-n är det som driver er att lägga ut dynga och lura andra? 

Skulle vara synnerligen intressant att höra exakt VAD det är som driver dessa människor...att lägga ut filmer som är fake, tv-serier som är fake osv...VARFÖR???

IDIOTER!

,silverpeak,2007-10-07T13:50Z,"Try This: How to rip or extract the mpg video from VCD or SVCD CDs or BIN/CUE images using Isobuster. 

VCD(DAT) to MPG 
SVCD(MPG) to MPG 
VCD BIN/CUE to MPG 
SVCD BIN/CUE to MPG 


VCD(DAT) to MPG 
This method will let you copy the VCD video to compliant mpg file(s). If you just copy the .dat file(s) with windows explorer you may experience problems because windows copies all sectors in ""raw mode"" instead of ""vcd mode"". 

Tools: Isobuster. 
Install and run Isobuster. 
Select your CD/DVD Drive. 
Click on the MPEGAV folder. 
Select all dat files and right click and select Extract but filter only M2F2 Mpg frames. 
Save the new file as filename.mpg. It will automatically be converted to a compliant mpg file. "
