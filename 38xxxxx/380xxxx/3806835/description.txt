Overview:	In the future, the world is coming to an end.

At the corner of the Earth, a dormant volcano suddenly erupts with the most horrific monsters. Scientists believe they might be creatures from the Ice Age...

These ferocious and damaging monsters seriously threaten the existence of men, and they are under the command of the Demon Princess to take over the world.

To stand against these creatures, Professor Liu Ying-te, the director of a satellite research station, transforms the brave scientific researcher Ray into the most powerful and indestructible The Super Inframan. This superhero possesses the ultra power to strike and defend, together with X-ray vision, solar armor, laser blades, flaming bombs and soul-splitting kicks. The Super Inframan is meant to be invincible, but the Demon Princess mesmerizes a station researcher Chu Ming to steal the Inframan blueprint for her.

Demon Princess sends Chu Ming and Armadillo to blow up the research station. As Armadillo is setting up in a cave, curiosity has driven Mei-mei, the Professor's daughter, and Ray's young brother Tiger to walk in and discovers the monster. Armadillo captures and leaves the children inside the station. At the last second, Ray rushes in and saves the day.

The same night, the Professor has successfully invented the most powerful "Lightning Fists". But Chu Ming and Armadillo are back and kidnaps Mei-mei again, threatening the Professor to come to them...

The ultimate battle between men and beasts is about to begin...
