SCARECROW AND MRS. KING, SEASON III
***********************************

IMPORTANT, PLEASE TAKE NOTE:
These files have been made based on SCREEN CAPS
recorded when the series was originally aired.
I tried to clean them up but not always with much success.

Do not expect top-notch quality or you will be VERY disappointed!
In fact, the quality of a few episodes pretty much sucks.
But as far as I know, this season has never been released either
on VHS or DVD, so this is the best you can get for now...

Subjective \"quality scale\":
(A) - Good, comparable to VHS quality
(B) - OK, rather blocky and/or out of focus
(C) - Barely watchable :-(

There are EXAMPLES for each quality rating in the EXAMPLES subfolder.
Download these before anything else!
