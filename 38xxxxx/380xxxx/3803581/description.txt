BIOGRAPHY


Anticulture Records has announced the signing of the Finnish black metal project GLOOMY GRIM.

It all began in 1984 as HELLSTORM. Agathon (vocals) got his first influences as a teenager from the bands like VENOM, HELLHAMMER and BATHORY.
HELLSTORM ended quite soon, but the title \'Fuck The World, Kill The Jehova!\' remained. GLOOMY GRIM used it as the first demo name.
The folklore tells that HELLSTORM was the first black metal band in Finland. Agathon wanted to create dark music, music from the depth of the darkest pit of Hell
and with no compromises from any other band members. Agathon started GLOOMY GRIM as a one-man band. The biggest inspiration has always been the dark life itself
and the soundtracks of the horror films he collected. Agathon made four albums with a strong line-up.
GLOOMY GRIM has also made some furious live shows in continental Europe and the Baltic states.
After the latest album ( The Grand Hammering 2004 ) and +30 000 sold titles GLOOMY GRIM is back on his throne!

GLOOMY GRIM\'s new album will be released in early 2008.
