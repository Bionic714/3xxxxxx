@turay_og

Just follow the steps on the serial.txt file:

1) Install cepstup.exe found in folder CEP 2.0

2) Run Cep2reg.exe and when prompted insert the following 
   name and key as follows:

	Marco Hardmeier
	200-00-Z3738EJ5

3) Now install cepsetup.exe found insider folder CEP 2.1 and    you will upgrade Cool Edit Pro from version 2.0 to version 2.1
   automatically. No name or key will be required this time.

You have to register before updating."

,uknown1,2009-01-13T02:01Z,why is  it asking me  for a adminitrator account.
,durian1,2009-02-10T22:26Z,I have downloaded this and followed the instruction exactly. But there is no prompt that shows up for me to enter the name and serial code in and it keep telling me this is a 21 day trial version. I even tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it a few times always with the same results. Any ideas how I can get this thing to allow me to enter the registration info?

,bfg666,2009-11-27T20:26Z,"I've been using CEP for 12 years now and I didn't even know there was a version 2... I've tried a lot of music editors before settling with CEP and it's a really easy-to-use AND powerful software : unlike Cubase or ProTools, you don't have to go through the painful process of learning how to use it, yet you can do pretty much what you want ! The only downside is that there is no automatic tempo tool : I hope v2 has this feature implemented. I'm downloading this right now !!! Thanx
PS : Be sure to check out the OhmForce plugins. They're amazing !"
,poll6666,2009-12-03T02:55Z,"It's infected. I submitted the file CEP2REG.EXE  to virustotal.com

,booyaboy,2010-03-12T19:55Z,same as durian...it doesnt prompt me for the register info...just a 21 day trial.....
,bdseeder,2010-05-13T09:43Z,"I've downloaded and installed following the instructions given in text file. but it installs only a trial version which has 21 day validity and only first 60 sec. mp3 recording facilities!

Is there anybody to provide me a torrent to download the complete version of Cool Edit pro??"
,panzersiddhartha,2010-05-16T21:53Z,231 seeders and I read that it has a trojan and is a 21 day trial..? Whadup?
,panzersiddhartha,2010-05-16T22:01Z,"Hm... Can't I post comments here...?

So, I read about 21 day trial and trojan virus?
Whadup?"
,FoIY,2010-06-22T21:57Z,Has a trojan. Don't DL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,smg_sterlin,2010-07-03T03:24Z,"The detected virus is called a false positive. Anti-virus programs detect most cracks, and keygens as a virus of some type. IT IS NOT A REAL VIRUS. AVG/Symantic/Mcafee/Whatever only SAYS it is a virus. It's not.
For good measure, *******THIS IS NOT A VIRUS! IT JUST SAYS IT IS!*******"
,smg_sterlin,2010-07-03T03:28Z,"Also, very good torrent, 697 kb/s was my highest speed during the minute it took to download. :)"

,dukejustice,2011-09-22T23:15Z,Thanks you for the post. Had lost my original file and am redownloading it. Good thing not to have to buy it again. I hate giving money to adobe for their overpriced products.
,VirtualVernon,2012-06-11T17:35Z,How do you install the RegKey?
,VirtualVernon,2012-06-11T17:42Z,"Everyone that is having problems installing the regkey, I figured out how to do so. All the directions can be found within the serial.txt file within the Cool Edit Pro rar you downloaded. Here is what to do!! 1. Create a new folder name Cool Edit Pro 2.0, then unzip the file you downloaded inside that folder. After you download and unzip the file, 2. Install the cepstup.exe found in folder CEP 2.0. Run Cep2reg.exe and when prompted insert the following name and key as follows:

User: Marco Hardmeier 
Pass: 200-00-Z3738EJ5

3. Now install cepsetup.exe found insider folder CEP 2.1 and you will upgrade Cool Edit Pro from version 2.0 to version 2.1"
,VirtualVernon,2012-06-11T17:57Z,"Also this program does wonders with Fl Studio 10 XXl producer Edition. Best digital combo for making beats! Been using both since 1999, when there was just  Cool Edit Pro, and Fruity Loops ""Fl Studio 1"" was the name then!"
