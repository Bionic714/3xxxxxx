,rogard,2007-09-14T01:52Z,"I've heard there is a sequel. Made by Uwe Boll. Is there a DVDrip yet on the scene? All I've found is a CAM, but it's very short. Bit weird, you just click install, then ok, and after a short flash the screen goes dark. But maybe there is a  director's cut? aXXo aXXo aXXo, pleasepleaseplease, can you upload it sooooooooon? Muahahahahahaha

ok, I really need to get some rest...ommmmmmm... :-)"
