Here is the latest version of Atomic Alarm Clock, which is an alarm clock for your windows computer. I have personally used this and can say that it works a charm. Does everything I wanted (wake me up in the morning with any song I want :) ), and more, and now the latest version is also fully compatible with Windows Vista.
