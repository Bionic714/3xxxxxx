,Wiiga,2007-12-14T06:30Z,"mrbabytony: Before you start yelling stupid things like ""This crap dont work"" you might try ""getting it to work"" before saying stuff like that. It works just fine and you dont even have to mount it with daemon tools. 
And just because om so nice i'll even tell how to watch it. Just download a little program called VLC media player and tadaaaa you can jerk off all you want. 
NOW GO TO BED NAUGHTY BOY!!!!! "

,woodycat3,2008-05-31T13:07Z,"I agree with Willga. If you have any sense you'll have several media/video players on your system that can accomodate a number of formats. I currently have five players including VLC and all the usual default players with most OS. In addition, you sometimes have to tinker with the vids like manually advancing the vid, bypassing the corrupt files. This is a great anime/hentai vid and if you're a dedicated watcher, you'll find a way!"
,killerkazama11,2008-06-06T06:23Z,I use BS Player along with a codec bundle called Vista Codec Package. This works flawlessly on everything I've ever tried to play. You don't have to have a lot of different programs that do the same thing on your machine.
,gruppenfuhrer,2008-06-23T03:52Z,Can't get the sound to work on this one. 
,tattooedmermaid,2009-01-08T02:21Z,I HAVE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR THIS!! i love you! keep it up! (literally lol)  and people  dont forget to SEED!!!   oh and matt  lemme know if you got any Dark Shell or Moonlight Lady.... cant find good copies of those anywhere...
,heisiandiishe,2009-07-18T20:40Z,"hey you nooby noobs, just mount the file in bla bla bla bla and then download the soundpack and bla bla bla... 

Just think of how the world would be without computers, actually much better. I use it all the time and im pretty good. But many people lose their normal life nowadays and hangaround at home typing bullshit at their keyboards instead of reading a book or cooking a nice meal. life is fucked up and people are stressed. but ok it is good that you can download amazing stuff and jerk all day and night"
