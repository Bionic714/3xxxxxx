new level.

and motivation behind the martial artist. Choose your character's fighting style,
appearance, and even skills! So, even if you are matched up with an opponent 
whose character has a similar appearance or uses the same fighting style, the 
gameplay will always be unique. It's up to you to create a legend, one beatdown 
at a time.

Another new and exciting feature in KwonHo is the ability to create or join a Gym. 
Interact with other players by training and holding Gym matches. Hone your skills,
and then seek out players from other Gyms to duke it out for bragging rights. 
The glory and prestige of your Gym is at stake!

train in. You can choose from Tae Kwon Do, Tai Chi Quan, Ba Ji Quan, Muay Thai, 
or Judo.
