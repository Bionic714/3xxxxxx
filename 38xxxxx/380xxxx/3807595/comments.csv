I recently looked up all your uploads and downloaded every one that sparked my interest, only problem is like this download no more seeders. do you mind re-seeding a little? for this one im at 99.2%. 

one other game that isn't downloading right now is your Onimusha 3, re-seeding would me much appreciated.

Thanks in advance :)"
