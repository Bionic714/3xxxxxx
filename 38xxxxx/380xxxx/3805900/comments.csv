[V],Subzero!,2007-09-15T14:06Z,"i know whatcha mean, a reason might be that they cant earn enuff money with, on the other hand, if you dissassemble program code from todays-games, you would see that most of them are not really well coded... thats my opinion, and i saw alot of crap--programming-code latly.... its sometimes really unbelievable, guess dopeman knows what i mean, games filled with crap-code just to make it look bigger or so, dunno why they do that!...

,Kyrol,2008-07-06T21:31Z,"""* The game can be played from a first-person OR third-person perspective, 
* marking it as the first boxing game to offer this unique viewpoint.""

Yep. The first, as long as you don't count 4D Boxing. Which did 1st person, 3rd person, and, oddly enough, your opponents first person views. It also had a career mode, and the option to create your own fighter.

Mind you, it's ancient and low rez, with, maybe 50 polygons per fighter, and that's if you turn up the settings to max. And good luck trying to get it to run without DosBox. 

I spent hours playing that one, back in the early 90s.

,Kyrol,2008-07-07T09:32Z,"And...

Having, now, tried this one, I have to say that 4D Boxing is still the better game.

How hard is it to make a decent boxing game on the PC?"
