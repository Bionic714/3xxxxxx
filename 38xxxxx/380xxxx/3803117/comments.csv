,Acidrainisapain,2007-09-18T18:38Z,"Hey, could you upload the Triumph album on its own? Or is that the ""Live album""? The live album is still locked. I remember writing you a comment about this before, but you've deleted it, please help!"
,T4MC,2007-09-18T22:58Z,"Sorry, I can´t unlock the Live-Album! That´s why I had to create the torrent for a second time. (And because you put my e-mail-adress here :-(   )

Use utorrent, than you can choose which files you want to download."
,yangwee,2007-10-02T22:43Z,"if there is any problems with this torrent, i would like to know it now, because i'm downloading it now. please answer."
,T4MC,2007-10-03T13:10Z,There is no problem with this torrent. It works fine (checked it)! No locked files! Everything works alright!
,skoputsen,2007-10-17T01:02Z,"thank you got this one,, adore michael!"
,T4MC,2007-10-20T00:30Z,"Come on, nobody to tell anything good about this? It´s a pretty good collection, not? Don´t tell me you already had all of these classics."
,Acidrainisapain,2007-10-20T22:14Z,"Hey mate. Sorry, I totally forgot about this download! I felt like listening to some of the 'ole classic Michael Jackson today, so then i remembered. Lol. I also apologize for adding your email in that comment. I've seen a lot of good reviews on the Jacksons Live Album. I'd really like to listen to it. I downloaded everything you uploaded last time. Is there any way you can upload just the Jacksons Live Album, so I don't have to donwload everything all over again? How do I use utorrent? Right now I azureus to download. "
,Acidrainisapain,2007-10-20T22:19Z,"Regardless of what people think of Michael Jackson, he's never released a piss-poor album. The Off The Wall, Dangerous and HIStory album rock, so many under-rated tracks. Thanks again for this upload, I discovered a lot of gems from the early Jackson 5 days too. I love Butterflies from Invincible, shame that album went to waste with all the bust-ups with Sony. I hope MJ does release another album. "
,T4MC,2007-10-21T16:21Z,"!!This referres to a different torrent, not this one!!

@Acidrainisapain: Sorry, but again, I can not upload the Live album. I bought it online and it is locked. Sorry! You should get it anyways, becuse it is very good! 
utorrent is a program like azureus, it is very small and easy to use. When you add a torrent to download it askes you which files you want to download. So you can choose which albums to download, don´t have to get the whole thing."

True or not, who cares anyway?  Turn on the music and enjoy.  I don't want to think of how many artists I'd not/ never had listened to if I judged their music by what I knew about them.

,lazrak_,2008-10-18T20:34Z,"Am I just blind or is the album ""Forever, Michael"" missing?"
,T4MC,2008-10-18T22:07Z,"Right, ""Forever Michael"" is not there. I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's not an album, just a collection. But one thing I am sure of is that all songs from ""Forever Michael"" are included. I did not include Best of-albums (except the J5-Box), because there are hundreds out there, I tried to put together the additional songs that are on Best-of's in the Diverse-section. "
,MarcCutty,2008-11-02T23:45Z,"This is a fantastic collection, T4MC. It has almost everything but there are two things that are missing. Jackson 5's Lookin' Through The Windows is missing, but the majority of those songs are already on the Children Of The Light album. The other is Michael Jackson's Forever, Michael album but, again, some of those are on One Day In Your Life. It'd be nice if those two missing albums were included since they are studio albums and the other two are compilations. Do you have the missing songs? Other than that, a brilliant collection."
,srobs2121,2009-01-01T23:58Z,Awesome collection thanks!!  Will seed for as long as I can!
,T4MC,2009-02-16T21:00Z,"@MarcCutty: No, I ain't got those two albums. If you have them, please upload! But, as I said before, I'm not 100% sure about which ones the real albums are and what are collections. You read this and that. I have some other compilations here and probably have all songs that are on these two albums, but - to make sure - please, please upload!"
,T4MC,2009-02-18T00:40Z,"OK, I got ""Forever, Michael"" now! All songs of that album are included here, I believe. If you ask me, I'd call that album a compilation with some new songs. "
,looover,2009-03-16T04:07Z,"Correction T4MC... ""Forever, Michael"" IS an studio album. One day in your life is a compilation album and so is ""children of the light"". Not that it matters though. Big J5 fan, just had to correct you. Great collection anyhow.  "

,umarnawazkhan,2009-06-29T01:45Z,"you should watch the news channel mate...
Michael Jackson converted to ISLAM.

MICHAEL JACKSON, the world-famous superstar converted to Islam at a ceremony at a friend?s mansion in Los Angeles on Thursday (November 20). The 50-year-old superstar changed his name to Mikaeel after the conversion

While taking oath, Jackson was found sitting on the floor wearing a tiny hat after an Imam was summoned to officiate the process. According to the sources, Jackson decided to convert while he was at the home of his friend to record a new album. 

An Imam from a mosque was summoned and Michael went through the ?shahada?. ?Shahada? is the Muslim declaration of belief. 

His new name, ?Mikaeel? stands for one of Allah?s (the Almighty) angels. But Michael rejected the alternative name ?Mustafa?, which means ?the chosen one?. David Wharnsby, a Canadian songwriter and Phillip Bubal, a producer were Jackson?s two friends who counselled him. Wharnsby would now be known as Dawud Wharnsby Ali and Phillip Bubal as Idris Phillips.

The guy had fucking LUPAS and Viligo. His primary care taker stated this on the news. Thats why his skin was too white. His dad beat him and he had a terrible self-image. Thats why all the cosmetic surgery. 

So fuck you. All the charges against him DROPPED! One kid even confessed to lying.

,Vladlen1986,2009-07-02T07:59Z,"I don't care about him, just his music. Of course he may have done some bad things(which I don't believe he did when he had his own kids, plus millions of dollars to fuck any girl he wanted..) but still.

His music is amazing and anyone who can respect music enough can appreciate his work. He was a great artist in both singing in dancing from when he was a child till the day he died.

Like I said. I could care less about his personal life. I think it's just funny watching all the pathetic people who waste their lives arguing enough about this topic.

Just something I wanted to get off my chest since I seen it on the news ever since. :)"

[T],tigerdirect,2009-07-07T22:15Z,"It truly amazes me how quick people are to trash someone that they do not personally know. 

Here is my two cents......the only VALID opinion that anyone can have about Michael Jackson as a person are the people that knew him personally. Otherwise your only knowledge about who he was whether it is good or bad is spoon fed to you by the media. If you listen to the people who knew him personally, you can't find one person that speaks negatively about him. All the molestation charges....alleged I might add, that were never brought upon him, in my eyes say that he is innocent.

Finally, the only connection or personal attachment that most human beings on this earth will ever have is through his music. That is how I know Michael Jackson. 

It would probably be best for everyone to ignore the retarded wankers on here talking a lot of shit about nothing. Because 10 times out of ten, if you dog someone else out, it is probably because you are not happy in your own life.........so how about trying to get one?????"

Have you given away millions to help starving kids in Africa? Have you given away millions to find a cure for HIV/AIDS? Are you the greatest entertainer on Earth?

No, I didn't think so.

Too bad you're gonna get HIV from ramming your cock into your mum and sister.

Stupid dumbass. 

And who's Gary Glitter? Is he your boyfriend?"
,Flying_Thor_II,2009-07-11T07:53Z,"""Have you given away millions to help starving kids in Africa?"" - I'm supposed to feel bad for not giving millions to starving kids in Africa? Fail. 

""Have you given away millions to find a cure for HIV/AIDS?"" - Seriously, how many billionaires do you think are downloading pirated material from this site? Again, fail.

""Are you the greatest entertainer on Earth?"" - Yes. You'd know this if you'd come to my sell out sex show. People especially liked the part where I dressed up like MJ and shagged a dwarf dressed like macaulay culkin.

""Too bad you're gonna get HIV from ramming your cock into your mum and sister."" - Yeah, he did kinda waste millions on that cure.....I guess thats a fail on his part, wouldn't you agree?

""Stupid dumbass."" - Third fail. This isn't going well is it....

""And who's Gary Glitter? Is he your boyfriend?"" - He was, but I don't do long distance relationships. And if you don't know who he is now I wouldn't fret, just wait til he dies, there's enough idiotic downloaders in this site to throw a few dozen torrents into the top 100."

,Jimmy54669,2009-09-07T00:56Z,"Last I heard, 12 people had committed suicide over Michael Jackson's death. I shit you not. And that was a few days ago, so even more ultra-sensitive souls might have offed themselves since then, for all I know. I haven't had the TV or radio on for days because if I hear one more update on Michael Jackson's death, I'm gonna go on a killing spree. I remember when Chevy Chase saying, ""Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still seriously dead,"" was funny because it was a fucking JOKE -- but now it's on my goddamned TV 24 hours a day about this one-man circus! Especially infuriating are the perfectly-coiffed overly made-up ""news""-sluts who ask one or both of these annoying questions over and over and over: ""Who killed Michael Jackson?"" and/or ""What killed Michael Jackson?"" MICHAEL FUCKING JACKSON killed Michael Jackson! And he did it in the conservatory with a mountain of drugs! I swear, this guy should be given a posthumous Nobel Prize for the MOST INEVITABLE DEATH EVER! 

Hey, I liked the music, I really did. I enjoyed the Thriller video as much as anyone else. Anything that put Vincent Price to work is the bee's knees in my book. Yes, Jackson was talented, that is unquestionable. But there are a lot of extremely talented people in the world -- talented people who aren't also batshit crazy, and rich enough to realize every single solitary goddamned batshit crazy notion that pops into their spinning heads, and insane enough to keep doing it even after they can't afford to pay for it anymore! When those extremely talented people die, do I have to endure more than a week of wall-to-wall coverage (and it isn't over yet, people)? No! Sometimes I don't even hear that they're gone until days, weeks, or months later! I mean, if Jesus fucking Christ came in the clouds right now and the dead started rising from their graves, the story would be lucky to get a brief mention somewhere between the latest update on Bubbles the fucking Chimp and the weather report for Jackson's memorial service. 

Paul Newman was one of the greatest movie stars Hollywood has ever seen, and a damned fine actor to boot, and he spent much of his long life quietly raising hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the lives of sick and dying kids -- and to the best of my knowledge, he never SLEPT with any of those kids, and if he DID, he wasn't so BUGFUCK CRAZY that he admitted it on television and then got his sequined panties in a bunch because all those nasty, mean people in the world just didn't understand what a wonderful thing that was. He didn't hire anyone to pop babies out for him so he'd have a little kiddie petting zoo, he didn't dangle any babies off of fucking balconies, and he didn't undergo countless plastic surgeries to mutilate himself into a GODDAMNED GELFLING FROM HELL! He got cancer, died, it was in the news for two or three days, TCM ran some of his movies, and it was over. If anyone deserved more than a week of chest-beating and garment-rending, it was THAT guy. But NOOOO! We reserve that for a guy who was so weird, he made the incredible nutjob Howard Hughes look like PAT FUCKING BOONE! I don't know who's more insane -- Michael Jackson or US. "
