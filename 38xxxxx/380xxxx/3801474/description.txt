EBM Collection, including known as well as underground EBM bands and their catchiest pieces. Mostly oldschool or oldschool influenced. 

This collection's purpose is to introduce the Electronic Body Music genre to those who aren't familiar with the style, as well as to spread less known, but good quality EBM bands. Thus it does not include full albums, and only has an introductary purpose. Support the bands and artists if you like them. This is an upgraded version of the collection with more than twice as many bands and songs. 

Enjoy, and look out for new versions with more bands updates from time to time.

SEEDING: I am a traveler, thus there will be periods when I can't seed (i.e. 10 days from now for a week or two) and so on. Thus any seeding help is appreciated! :)
