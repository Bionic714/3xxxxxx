          Plot - Synopsis ..: The lavishly erotic paintings of Gustav Klimt were the subject 
                              of great controversy and scandal in Austria at the turn of the 
                              20th century. In this setting, amidst the opulence and decadence 
                              of Vienna, KLIMT depicts the most productive, and tumultuous, 
                              period of the artist's life. From his passionate, hedonistic 
                              affair with the notorious French dancer Lea de Castro, to his 
                              battle with an oppressive government for control of his work, 
                              KLIMT, as performed by John Malkovich and directed by award 
                              winning filmmaker Raul Ruiz, is a feverish and sensual homage 
                              to a man who insisted on living his life as he painted it.

          |  NOTES  |

          We often get asked by friends to rip DVDs for them and right now we're all using
          multimedia HDs a whole lot more than the DVD players themselves, so as to save on 
          disks and storage space. Thus, we decided that, from now on, we'll release some of 
          these to the scene, in case anyone wants them too. We're not looking for glory or
          anything like that and You won't see us releasing CAMs or any "I-wanna-be-first" 
          0-day stuff. We're just having some old school FUN.


          Enjoy! :)
