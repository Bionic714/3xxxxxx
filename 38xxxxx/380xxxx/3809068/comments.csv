,klipa,2008-02-03T22:17Z,Has anyone downloaded and tried to watch this video? I don't trust to big RAR files because I can't check quality of video before downloading whole file. Thanks.
,pazert,2008-02-05T07:00Z,"Quality video is AWSOME !!!!!!!!!

Can't you read the NFO? Here's a copy-paste:

""Total = 4434Mo, quality is very very high""

You guys should start buying a brain and read what it is indicated. The poster say ""quality is very high"" and you ask ""is quality good?"" LOL

Stop asking stupid questions, download, seed and enjoy rather to count on others."
,klipa,2008-02-10T23:02Z,"Like R. ?erbe?ija said: Ne znaju ?to ih ?eka... 

First, there is no stupid questions. Second, your reaction is stupid. Third, this is not answer I wanted to hear=1 point for do not download. Fourth, if you don't have anything to do, don't do it here. Thanks again for helping :D"
,maxkill,2008-03-10T07:37Z,a good show but this show was canceled before the conclusion which sucks ass....!
,InTouch28,2011-05-16T14:24Z,"Would anyone have a 720p version of this show?

The quality of this file would be great on my 32"" monitor, but on my 52"", the quality isn't good.  If there's a 720p version out there, it would be appreciated and I could seed it a while so there are enough copies out there.  Thanks."
,ninline,2011-10-26T19:57Z,It's a 2005 show so I don't know if it's even in High Definition at all.  Amazon is selling season 1 (the only season) on DVD for 9.95.  I don't know that I'd bother downloading this to save $10 myself.  Probably never see it on bluray.
