Osho Nataraj Meditation

This is a 65 minute dancing meditation in three stages, with specifically created music.

Disappearing in the dance, then relaxing into silence and stillness, is the route inside for this method.

?Forget the dancer, the center of the ego; become the dance. That is the meditation. Dance so deeply that you forget completely that ?you? are dancing and begin to feel that you are the dance. The division must disappear; then it becomes a meditation.

If the division is there, then it is an exercise: good, healthy, but it cannot be said to be spiritual. It is just a simple dance. Dance is good in itself ? as far as it goes it is good. After it, you will feel fresh, young. But it is not meditation yet. The dancer must go, until only the dance remains?. Don?t stand aside, don?t be an observer. Participate!

And be playful. Remember the word playful always ? with me it is very basic.? Osho
