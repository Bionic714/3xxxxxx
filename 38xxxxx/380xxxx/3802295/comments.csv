,tootles131,2007-09-11T15:31Z,"oh yeah, anyone manage to capture Feedback's film Megasnake??? I would love to know where to find this =)"
,narfbert,2007-09-11T18:28Z,"Darn! I looked on sci-fi, whether the final ep already aired and saw who won!! :(
Can anybody upload the final ep, please? I'd like to watch it nonetheless."
,vedelminashigo,2007-09-12T07:32Z,I need to see the last episode SO BADLY!  I would love to see Mega Snake as well...please help a guy out?  
,narfbert,2007-09-12T14:39Z,"Argh! Come on, please! Anybody?"
,narfbert,2007-09-13T15:55Z,"@laser
Yeah, the last two aired one after another.
That's why I know the next great superhero is....damn. I'd like to see it nonetheless."
,tootles131,2007-09-14T06:55Z,anyone have any luck yet?? I still can't find the last ep anywhere =(
,vexredseptembre,2007-09-14T19:23Z,I was under the impression that the 2 hour final was shown on the 13.09.07 which would be episode 8. At the end of episode 7 they said catch superhero next week!!
,vexredseptembre,2007-09-14T20:26Z,I think i am wrong though! This is so confusing and we've had no decent and faithful uploaders! Whatever happened to AVI lol
,narfbert,2007-09-15T00:56Z,"One could watch the ep online, but not if you're not in the States. And if you don't want a spoiler on the first page, don't visit sci-fi's site!
Someone really should upload it though."
