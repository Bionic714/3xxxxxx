The film is in the mold of a survivalist adventure yarn set in the Amazon jungle, with set-pieces including animal mutilation, eye-gouging, castration, cannibalism  and a live and screaming female victim impaled through both breasts by suspended iron hooks, identical to the ritual Richard Harris's character endured in A Man Called Horse. John Morghen (AKA Giovanni Lombardo Radice) stars as a drug-crazed, womanizing lout, and porn star Robert Kerman (the star of Deodato's film) turns up as a world-weary New York detective.

Cannibal Ferox was released uncut on video in England circa 1982 by Replay, but the film's transgressive imagery prompted it to be quickly banned under the Obscene Publications Act, finding itself languishing for years on the video nasties list.
