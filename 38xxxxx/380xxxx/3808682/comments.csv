good news, it's a suppository!"
,pwncakes,2009-03-01T01:53Z,"well, i thought it was funny...

to install the codec, unzip the archive, find the MPG4C32 file, right click it, and select install.

if you're using vista (AND WHY WOULDNT YOU BE?!) youll need to select to allow it to run in the windows popup (like most program that requires administration permission)

hope that helps"
,pwncakes,2009-03-01T01:58Z,"also, just now noticed that stortkanda had given the exact same instructions, so kudos to him :)"
