,JiMiTh1nG,2007-09-15T18:08Z,bullshit this plays fine in VLC.  It possible I may have renamed it wrong..and thats making quicktime mad.  When I got it from the rev3 site it wanted to name it redirect.mv4 or something.. so I renamed it with the episode number and name.

The error mentioned does happen in QuickTime, but load up VLC and it's fine."
