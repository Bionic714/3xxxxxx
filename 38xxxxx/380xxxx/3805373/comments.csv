,Alero_Driver,2007-09-14T14:23Z,"isn't this season 4 wasn't air date until 28.9, i mean that what the scifi channel program guide says ?"
,sallvll,2007-09-14T15:20Z,And thx for this bye the way
,tantanx,2007-09-19T20:45Z,"Alero_Driver, this isn't an aired ep. This is a leaked workprint or screener as been said before. SciFi will air 28.9 (or sometime around then)

To uploader; thanks a bundle!"
,TheTrekhippy,2007-09-21T18:04Z,"Quoted from one of the Producers blogg sites or something.  Search Wikipedia.  ""I?m not sure if any of you have noticed, but it would seem that the first two episodes of season four have made their way onto the internet. That, my friends, is what I would call a bad case scenario. But not a worst case scenario. No. You know what a worst case scenario would be? If Sci Fi sent out the first two episodes of the season in their press kits and mistakenly included rough cuts instead of finished episodes. Yeah, that would be the worst of both worlds. Not only would the episodes be available for the fans to screen well before the premiere, but they would be half-finished episodes with temp visual effects and devoid of music and sound effects. Ho ho ho! Imagine if THAT happened?"""
,Denniz(DK),2007-09-21T21:59Z,Thanks for this!
,NosTraDomus,2007-09-23T19:29Z,"Yes, its another ""What if"" scenario..."
,koskn,2007-09-25T22:55Z,"Thanks for upload. I really appreciate it. I don't really care about this ""sound problem"" since I've waited too long for this :D"
,Smiffy008,2007-09-29T12:35Z,"This is rather weird, watching without SFX is.. well weird."
,gregersamsa,2007-10-03T11:10Z,"Weird but cool. Thanks homp for leaking this to us. I'd love to know how you got your hands on this, BUT I realize that you'd probably compromise yourself by telling us so... I'll just imagine...

You're a disgruntled assistant on the set, they never paid you well and they never will... This is your way of getting back at all those snooty actors and writers who scream at you for not getting them a tall macciato just the way they like it...

:-)"
