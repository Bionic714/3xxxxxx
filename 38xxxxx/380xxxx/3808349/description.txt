About the band:
"Synaptic", the english adjective for the term synapse; a switch in the brain.
The name is program, the muscial ideas go from the brain over the hand of the
musician and the instruments directly to the ear of the listener. Clich√©s are
confirmed or sarcastically smilied at; the influences blur in the decades and
genres. In short, having fun with the music and emotional dedication are in the
foreground! It's just Rock 'n' Roll!
