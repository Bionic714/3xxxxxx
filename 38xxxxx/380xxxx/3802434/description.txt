Grande Size Me 

To prove a point, Ron decides to eat only Bueno Nacho from now on. Meanwhile, HenchCo is holding an auction for a molecular transducer. After Ron falls into a vat of serum, he transforms into a giant. Now Kim must get Ron back to normal, and stop HenchCo from selling the transducer. 

Note: Use VLC to watch the episode as QuickTime doesn't work...at least it didn't work for me.
