After this one, you have only to register the software with following code(it works well):

name: Apple Retail

enjoy"

,quicktime_pro,2007-09-10T16:05Z,"Apple's server averaged at almost 50 KB/S... and i gave you a direct link to my server (http://www.thepiratedock/qt) which averaged at a little over 70 KB/S... but i  imagine apples works as well. And the serial provided changes with every new version they put out, the ones in the package will be good forever. Not to put you down nobody but I've done so much research that its practically ridiculous."
,quicktime_pro,2007-09-10T16:08Z,lol sorry... if you want a direct download from my server its http://www.thepiratedock.com/qt
