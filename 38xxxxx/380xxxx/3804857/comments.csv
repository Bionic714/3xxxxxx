,baddayrising,2008-01-25T09:36Z,Totally and utterly... not worth the download time... keeps freezing up....... music and film quality so bad its only sadistic to the poor veiwer...definetly one part of the 70s to forget..other than that keep up the good work frank you do have some great files to share.. sorry about this one.. guess its someones ...thing
,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2008-02-20T22:53Z,Does not freeze up and it is worth downloading.
,stuart0305,2008-06-28T11:51Z,"freezes when forwarding. leave it playing and its fine.
thnx for this fff. fucking awesome it is.

,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2008-07-08T21:51Z,Well yes I also would like the soundtracks...
,dynamoehummm,2008-07-16T06:07Z,"Deepspacefreelancer was right.. the MUSIC overlayed on these 8mm whathaveya films is INCREDIBLE.  From Leather Nun on great.  

Now.  The Video.  The grain film is PERFECT for this onioneyed classic!  

This is great great stuff!  Horror gore.  70 sadistic slash satanic camp hard core bdsm.  

Back when Satanic stuff was 'cool' lol.. Look for a guy who shows up in a robe like some dungeons n dragon goof and the chick says like 'cool robe'.  

lol this is good stuff if you like Classics HC BDSM and suprisingly great soundtrack.   "

In the 70's MEN were MEN and SLUTS were SLUTS and there where no crack whores.
People were raw and they took as normal and natural their deviant behavior. "

[T],bill_214,2009-05-01T16:10Z,"I have to wonder why the fuck the origional ripper chose to rip an almost 2 hour movie into a 600 MB file.

Then again, I don't get why some rippers delete the titles from DVD rips.......I can undersytand it when it a VHS rip and the titles are chopped off for whatever reason."
,prasnto,2009-08-17T07:02Z,"Death in June did not form in 1981, so how can one of their songs be on loops from the 70s? "
,prasnto,2009-08-17T07:03Z,"*until 1981, not 'in'"
