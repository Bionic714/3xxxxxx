,freebrd,2007-09-15T03:03Z,"Cool thanks.

Would it be possible for you to create a torrent with just the crack?
We could just download the demo from Sony and the crack from you."
,cybernero,2007-09-15T13:43Z,"Ppl who dled this stuff could possibly publish just the crack?
I mean damn it i have already dled vegas 8 and al i want is the crack.
And 49 ppl DLed so far nobody confirmed it's working!
WTF?I will dl and give you info guys!"
,terroradagio,2007-09-15T14:02Z,"Crack is essentially useless. Let's you run Vegas, but you can't render MPEG2, WMV, etc.

What we need is a proper keygen for Vegas 8 and DVD Architect 4.5. Hopefully SSG does one."
,cybernero,2007-09-15T14:27Z,"And the crack for those who dont want to DL all the stuff!
BTW it's working.Hail manjoo for giving it to us!"
,JasonTrevor,2007-09-15T17:20Z,"ATTENTION!!!!! The crack works OK but the program is TOTALLY crippled and does not have any of the FX, Transitions or ANY text editor available! DON'T bother even dling it!!  "
,THINKER100X,2007-09-16T05:55Z,"its good dude thnks! please upload the full version including keygen. This one has no basic transitions and video fx, seems like i cant open my dvd video jst AVI. Totally not complete. Im sure the next one u will upload is the complete version. Thnks! Great Job!XD"
,JasonTrevor,2007-09-16T08:14Z,"Yeah, let us know if and when you get it working properly - weird that it's cracked but crippled - hej, what do I know anyway?!? :-) V8 has this great Text Editor but it's not available with this crack --- :-( "
,kamran_pro,2007-09-16T09:00Z,Nice torrent but no video transitions and effects :-( .
,polymatt,2007-09-16T11:49Z,THIS SONY VEGAS IS THE CORRECT PROGRAM HOW EVER THE EFFECTS TAB & MEDIA TABS TEXT TABS ARE MISSING & CAN NOT BE FIXED THE PROGRAM IS A PILE OF CRAP DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS WAIT WILL BE WORTH IT
,JasonTrevor,2007-09-16T16:50Z,"It would be cool to hear from the majnoo man  considering the condition of this crack. Should we expect a ""upgrade"" :-) or is this the whole banana? "
,BazzaB,2007-09-16T18:18Z,"download some vegas transitions/ vid effects extras from here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3660856/Pixelan.SpiceMASTER.Pro.v2.5.for.Sony.Vegas.Incl.Keygen-SCOTCH

I really hope we can get hold of the original Vegas Vid Effects? :("
,JasonTrevor,2007-09-16T20:52Z,Yeah! Come man - lets get the app working!! 
,Finatic,2007-09-17T01:55Z,"does this crack work with the legit download from the Sony Media Software site?

i have been working with the trial version and Vegas 8 rocks."
,JasonTrevor,2007-09-17T07:10Z,No - it cripples the program totally so DON'T seed it!!!
,THINKER100X,2007-09-17T07:13Z,"@majnoo: dude... i already have the serial... what we nid is a reg/activation code...even i have serial its ask for a registration code... pls make a crack for a registration/activation code..
they made it jst like the other v_editing software.
a serial with activation. thnks! hope u cn make it!"
,JasonTrevor,2007-09-19T07:29Z,I can't belive ppl are still seeding this shit!! Don't seed it - it's a TOTALLY crippled program!! Stay with V 7 until we get a real Key Generator!
,Elixus,2007-09-20T07:08Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, sure the crack plus the program works, but the program does not come with any Transitions, editing tools, anything which makes the program completely useless."

,JasonTrevor,2007-09-23T08:33Z,Don't bother seeding this! It's a waste of everyones time!
,jacksomeone,2007-09-26T05:32Z,"Full NON-TRIAL serial and activation required program for code-digging to make a keygen:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3816282/Sony.Vegas.Pro.8_DVD.Architect.4.5.NO.KEYGEN

Seed it, you're gonna need it for a proper keygen to be released."
,THINKER100X,2007-09-26T23:32Z,why seed? its not working! stop seeding this!
,jacksomeone,2007-09-27T02:44Z,"Go and seed mine, it's the real deal."
,terroradagio,2007-09-27T05:24Z,Yours dont work for shit either.
,jacksomeone,2007-09-27T13:08Z,"Without a effin keygen, it doesn't. But use mine to make an effin keygen goddamn it!"

,bluPulz,2010-03-22T15:42Z,"Targa123; I believe that you have the program and the plug-ins in different program folders. 
Ex: C:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas.exe
     C:\Programs (x86)\Sony\Shared Plug-ins\"

,klamity,2010-06-27T06:33Z,Can anyone PLEASE tell me how to get video plugins? ive even tried reDLing the torrent and NOTHING!
,robofet,2010-08-09T04:27Z,"This is really great. It was easy to install and everything, but there is one simple problem - there is no MainConcept MPEG Plugin!! The last time I got vegas it had it. This really sucks because I have a hard drive camera and ALL of my clips are in that format. Could I have installed it wrong?"
,sfrrsman64,2010-08-31T07:44Z,"omg...please help me someone. ok, i installed it and it all works nice, EXCEPT, i can't insert title effects???? HELP!"
,WiZxKiD,2010-10-06T16:45Z,This torrent works great! Just follow the instructions and it works like a charm. Thank you very much! No viruses or anything. A+++
,zackpejic,2010-11-24T14:49Z,i installed with no problems. great torrent. only problem is that there are no video effects or transitions. is that just me or is vegas 8.0 like that?
,Twistedfate122,2010-11-30T23:54Z,FAGGUTS THIS DONT WURK GO FUKIN DIE. jk it works flawlessly thanks and i can spell i was replicating idiots on this site
,saftad_burk,2010-12-20T07:19Z,"I'm having some problem installing the program!

Have put the crack in the ""sony setup"" map in C/programs and made short cut to the desktop. Can't open the applications with the short cut though. ""vegas80k.dll"" can't be found...

What should i do?"
,adre120,2010-12-24T22:12Z,"To those with this problem: ""vegas80k.dll"" can't be found... If you are running Windows 7 you might want to try checking what directory you installed vegas to. I found that by default it was being installed to programs x86, and was giving me that error message. Try moving the whole Sony folder into the regular programs folder, and then run the crack from there, and it should start up saying ""expires in 0 days."" hope this helps."
,Shily,2011-01-15T17:46Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!

Installation and crack work fine, but there are NO video effects and transitions at all. Confirmed this with two other friends. This is a crippled and useless torrent."
,IrritableWOcoffee,2011-03-11T18:21Z,"It does work great, not going to lie. Added a movie clip to edit, all excited about new machinima, and absolutely NO plug-ins, no effects, nothing. You can do more with Windows Movie Maker. Very disappointing."
,ashley_mcgowan,2011-03-31T18:15Z,"it was a fast downlload and install  but none of the plug ins / affects are there what's going on.

freebrd has an awsom ideaon the first comment im gona try it"
,Infliktion,2011-09-26T16:27Z,"Some of you honestly shouldnt be downloading torrents if you dont knw how to follow simple instructions.. This obviously works like a charm, and I havent een downloaded it yet. Working with cracks is stupid easy... Find the location of Sony Vegas on your disk drive and drag the crack file where Vegas is, and it will ask to replace files. Click yes YOUR DONE. fuckin noobs... smh"
,abscorpy,2012-02-20T23:17Z,Does not extract!
