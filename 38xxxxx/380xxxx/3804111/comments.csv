,exclusiveripper,2007-09-14T12:27Z,Yes it works great on XP.. i just tested it a week ago :)
,Tantalos,2007-09-15T01:40Z,"Thanks! Didn't work at first, but with the 1.18 patch and crack it's all smooth now! I also downloaded Thief2X and the Ultimate Difficulty mod. I can strongly recommend it!"
,exclusiveripper,2007-09-17T01:28Z,"Nice Tantalos, well thanks for recommending the game :) that means i made a quite good release aswell :D"

,exclusiveripper,2007-10-08T03:19Z,"i do not know if this game is running correctly on Vista, IKKIN. Give it a try your self. may work, may be not. It's a old game. But you may go ahead and try and report it in comment box? :)"
,MxxSao,2007-10-28T08:17Z,"for me, it won't go past Install. I have Xp, so it should be working..."
,MxxSao,2007-10-28T09:30Z,"I got it installed after fooling around a bit, but even though ive installed the patch and the crack, i get a 3d acceleration driver error. Any Idea what might be causing this?"

,wierdguy,2007-11-04T21:59Z,please keep on seeding mate
,exclusiveripper,2007-11-19T02:11Z,I don't know why you get the 3d acceleration driver error. it worked for me when i tried it.. so it should be working. i tried on winXP pro (SP2)
,Geheimnis,2007-12-04T23:21Z,"

Word to the wise: If you're getting a 3D Acceleration error and you use a Nvidia card, try rolling back to some of the earlier drivers.

Radeon cards, however, don't seem to have this problem."
,bad_habit,2008-01-05T19:43Z,"it won't install for me and i have XP, each time i click on install the launch menu freezes and then dissapears. same if i run it from the setup.exe in the first image. any help?"

,Seven_Dubb,2008-07-08T22:45Z,"I can tell by the other comments that people are playing this game. I just can't seem to figure it out. I have daemon tools, all that good stuff... I am socially DYING to play this(I'm putting my psychotic need to play T2MA before my friends and fiance) ... The instructions I guess were just oversimplified for me or something... I ""mounted"" it with Daemon tools... but I don't know what the ""cd crack"" is or what the game directory is to put it in there... I know I probably seem fucktarded at this point but I'm just not used to this stuff ... pls someone help"
,Seven_Dubb,2008-07-10T01:42Z,Ok. I was an idiot for not exploring the folder and finding that exclusive directory ... BUT - the game keeps freezing on me right around the time I shoot out the first torch with a water arrow in the first mission... Can someone PLEASE help me?
,sboagent,2008-08-11T15:47Z,"Seed plz!!!!
it downloads reeealy slow!"
,sboagent,2008-08-11T15:51Z,"this will take days! please seed! i will do the same! and to all you seeders, you freakin rock!"
,MissRiv,2008-09-14T17:56Z,Seven_Dubb i keep having the same problem except i learned how to avoid it. But i'm trying to use the club now and it keeps freezing and not responding when i go to hit the guard. I cant figure out how to keep it from freezing. I cant find a patch for the 1.18 and i dont know about a crack bc i didnt see one in the folders. It sucks because i really want to play
,1130210,2008-09-28T13:54Z,"Worked fine on vista for me

-Dark Project Works Fine - Run as ADMIN

-Thief 2 - Works Fine Run as ADMIN.

http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=75031

go to that link to get your movies to work.

ON VISTA it'll take more than that

1. go to scrooges perminent movie fix

2. DO EVERYTHING IT SAYS EXACTLY

3. to make RegIndego. you MUST use NOTEPAD
MUST! Instead of right-clicking find it in your
accessories in the start program

4. Copy and paste RegIndego into your directory
wherever you installed thief.

5. now heres the important part that most people
dont do with vista
AFTER YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING

RUN REGINDEGO AS AN ADMIN
RUN THIEF AS AN ADMIN
RUN REGSVR32 AS AN ADMIN.

Also you may need to download the codecs
below the fix. and there they will work now.
thats the fix for vista"
,nasio,2008-12-05T17:44Z,I'm with Nvidia GeForce 7300 card and i can't handle this annoying error with the 3D accelerator thing.Can anyone help me with this issue?
,theRealKarmine,2009-01-13T11:25Z,thief2x requires a legit copy and ive never found a crack for THEIR exe.
,themalk69,2009-01-20T02:53Z,"how do you get this thing to work, mounted it with daemon tools, installed it but when i hit play it tells me to insert the disk any help?"
,Akolyte01,2009-02-13T16:19Z,"So, where is the crack exactly? I have an ""eXclusive"" msInfo document, two .bins and two .cues

No folders or executables. :("
,Akolyte01,2009-02-14T16:57Z,Where are people getting the 1.18 crack?
,MaD_BuLL,2009-02-15T12:20Z,"Acolyte, try mounting cue files with Daemon Tools, so that you can open the disks and find the Crack directory there. Didn't download though, doin it right now. Thanks for those who seed.

I have got a question: Will it work if I run it in a virtual Win98 system?"
,philly666lol,2009-03-05T16:51Z,"Hey, is there any way to have the cinematics 'cause they don't work for me... pls"
,escalonaricardo,2009-04-18T18:28Z,Works fine for me. I had no problem at all. great game
,redshirt07,2009-06-02T07:55Z,"Alright, I know it's a little late, but if it can help anybody...

If you have trouble either with either the cinematics not playing or freezes and crashes and have multiple processors (either duo or quad), try to only have one activated and get rid of the rest for the application. To do that, just start the game, then hit Ctrl+Alt+Del and find the game in the process tab. Then, simply right click on it and go to ''set affinity''. Uncheck all the processors except the one marked ''0'' and you should be fine.

Hope this helps people play this great game !"

,arkitip,2009-10-11T00:40Z,"I cannot urar any of the files, for some reason they have all opened up as a VLC media file. I tried opening them and exacting, mounting them in daemon but it just wont work, i have no idea what to do :(. After that i tried to find the answer on google, and even on the forums but no dice. what do i need to do?"
,bibiana24,2009-12-23T18:48Z,"I'm having the same the same problem as arkitip, I can't unrar any of the files and all I get is the text document and four VLC files. Anyone know how to fix this?"
,Chaosmet,2010-01-06T06:24Z,"This doesn't work for me. I mounted the bin files onto magiciso and converted to iso burned to discs installed and everything seemed fine and legitimate but when i try and start the game it keeps saying ""insert correct cd rom"" and i have already done a full installation and tried both discs to no avail. Unless I did something wrong this does not work for me"
,Chaosmet,2010-01-06T06:33Z,scratch that i forgot to copy the executable file on the cd to the game folder...to find that it says my video card is uncompatible with it! Boourns all i got is an 8600 nvidia....this sucks lol
,Chaosmet,2010-01-06T07:08Z,"okay all this seems like a huge pain in the ass to get going...I went to this site http://forums.eidosgames.com/showthread.php?t=76531 and did everything up until the ""ddix"" fix or whatever its called and just seemed like a huge effort to spend considering at the top of the readme file when downloaded it says ""This was tested on non pirated version 1.18 of thief 2 other results may vary"" and i'm not about to waste my time opening the thief.exe with a hex editor when the patch overwrites the exe [which you have to change to make it work] for chances of it not even working when you have to do a ton of other stuff....Let me know if someone else wants to waste their time doing that cause I won't lol Or if there's another solution to this madness"
,Arrrrrow,2010-03-21T13:43Z,"Guys, Daemon Tools

Mount .cue file, install and done.
Read the description. Yes, I made an account to tell you that.


Torrenting now, sounds like an awesome game."
