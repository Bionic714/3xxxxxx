I have been downloading this one nonstop for some 35 hours, and I have only reached 19%...

I'd really appreciate to have some help in increasing the download speed!"

Leecher.

,TiticacaAndina,2008-08-26T06:04Z,"My download of this movie stopped after 46,6%.  Then it just died.  Nothing more...

Another Native American Movie, ""Stolen Women, Captured Hearts"", died after 97,0% - ages ago.  Nothing more happens, it's just dead....

Both these movies are difficult to get hold of, unfortunately.

It really is very disappointing to first be happy to find a movie that you really want to have - and then have to face the fact that it won't download to 100%, so you still can not get and watch the movie.  Pretty meaningless IMHO. :-((
