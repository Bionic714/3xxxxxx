,Aventinus,2007-09-21T08:39Z,"Hi!

I have the same problem like on the other S04E01 version:
After 20 minutes and about 30 seconds the picture is paused, the sound is paused too.
And if I go up to about 27 minutes, then it start back again. Something missing from the file - or the coding was buggy.
I tried mplayer, mplayer frontend - the latests, and download the newest ffdshow tryout to my WMP, but it was all the same.

So now I must really use VirtualDub to decode and recode it again?

(three times downloaded from this torrent)."
,Alq,2007-09-23T05:46Z,Thank you.
,DrChandra,2007-09-23T20:43Z,"pretty cool to get the eps before they air. also interesting to see the ep without the mood music and foley work. great find and if someone knows how it was gotten I'd love to hear it.
that said I think the experience is so different that the title of the torrent should include the nature of the release. for instance workprint without sound effects. spice it up with preair"
,DrChandra,2007-09-23T20:45Z,6 minutes missing in the middle is worth mention too
,Double_X,2007-09-24T13:19Z,"Does anyone have a clue when the proper episodes is coming? The TVrip I guess. With sound and without the 6 minute gap.

Does anybody now??;)"
,army1,2007-09-24T18:57Z,"comments:

Episode 1 : After 22 minutes it sucks, it freezes.
this is not driver related, or software related, those work properly."
,Chikaca,2007-09-26T16:16Z,"WOOT FINALLY SOME FRESH STARGATE!!!

Can't wait for some proper versions!

Rodney FTW! Hilarious Character!

Oh and now theres the chick from Firefly! Thats cool! Can't wait to see more of her ;) Damn why did they drop that show anyway it wasnt that bad..

In the Scifi category I would vote it right after the stargate series. Firefly was funny and interesting too much like Stargate and they had some GOOD characters in Firefly too!

But thanks for giving us the goods! Keep it up :)
"
,Alero_Driver,2007-09-28T19:02Z,PROPER episode is coming 28.9  SCIFI CHANNEL
,blake9999,2007-09-29T19:04Z,"I think it's kinda cool to get a copy such as this. Watching the two of them ( workprint and final) you can get to see the kind of effects they add to make the series more compelling. Even the slightest things, like footsteps and beeps from the medical equipement are noticed in the final. Goes to show you how much work the sound guys go through to give more feeling to a standard TV show."
