***************************************

This is the batch of my first Scorehero chart conversions for Frets on Fire.   To my knowledge, none of these songs have been imported into Frets yet unless someone did it for themselves and didn\'t feel like sharing - which would suck if they did.  

My thanks to the talented throng of chart makers over at Scorehero for their hard work and their dedication and commitment to putting out first rate songs for all of us to play, console & pc players alike.  The Frets people have a few song makers that make some great stuff but their numbers and the amount of songs being put out don\'t even come close to what I\'ve seen over at Scorehero.

All songs give due credit to the chart makers in the song INI files.  Hope you Frets on Fire players enjoy this song pack and I hope it will inspire some of you guys to give the Scorehero peeps a run for their money.

******************************************************


All songs playable in Amazing mode.  Some are playable in other skill levels and may have Bass co-op but I never got around to keeping note of which ones.

Chart conversions done with GHex.
Song files ripped & converted using Nero Wave Editor.
Sync and timing done when needed, in Anvil Studios.

All songs ripped from my own massive CD collection - believe it or not.  I\'m from an era when we used to buy LP\'s and CD\'s. Freaky I know.

Unless these songs have Easy or Medium difficulty, I don\'t recommend them for beginners.  I do recommend using Frets on Fire 1.324 with the RFMod add on - I\'ve never had any sync issues and the notes are easier to hit and play with the RFMod add on.

Happy Frettin\' to You All,
