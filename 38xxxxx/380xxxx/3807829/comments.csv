,Cepsita,2008-10-26T05:12Z,"I'm having the same problem too. I have tried either to mount the ISO (I use Alcohol 52%). I could install that way, but won't recognize any of the images if I mount them. I have also burned the ISOs to no avail. It won't take either CD 1, 2 or 3 on any way. Any ideas? "
,Cepsita,2008-10-26T05:26Z,"I've solved it. I have managed to run the program correctly. I uninstalled the progam (from my ""all programs"" menu) and used the CD 1 (phisically burned) to reinstall. Then, when i start the program, I feel the computer reading the CD. And when I choose to ""study"" a language from the list that is on disk 2 or 3, and insert the required CD when prompted, I feel the computer spinning the disk, and finally reading it. I think that's the way to go, to burn the set of CDs, use them to install or to run the program and enjoy!!"
