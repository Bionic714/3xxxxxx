Iron Mask - Hordes Of The Brave
power/Speed Metal

Iron Mask is the sequel to Belgium\\\\\\\'s power metal act Magic Kingdom fronted by guitarist Dushan Petrossi. Hordes Of The Brave follows up their opening, Yngwie-inspired, CD \\\\\\\"Revenge Is My Name\\\\\\\" - this time without instrumentals. Eleven neo-classical metal vocal tracks are offered, with Petrossi handling all song writing chores. Vocalist Goetz Mohre covers territory staked out by throatmen such as Graham Bonnett and David Coverdale, while Petrossi shreds in the \\\\\\\"Rising Force\\\\\\\"-era style, appeasing fans of the furiously technical genre. Standout tracks include \\\\\\\"My Eternal Flame\\\\\\\" (slow) and \\\\\\\"Demon\\\\\\\'s Child\\\\\\\" (fast). Neo-Classical Metal/Shred, total running time, 59:24
