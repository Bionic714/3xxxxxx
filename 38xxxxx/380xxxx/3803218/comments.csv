,Xiados,2007-10-07T17:06Z,eehm wich program do i use to run these games??
,StAaG,2007-10-08T00:29Z,How do i run the games 
,Xiados,2007-10-13T16:03Z,"Okey i found out how to run these games.
To do so you need to make a new text dokument.
name it anything you like and at the end of the name write .html for example flashgames.html
Then you need to make a new folder.
you can name this folder anything you like.
Then you need to put your text dokument and all the flash games into this folder.
Now you open your new text dokument (not in your webreader but as a text dokument)
then you copy this and write it inside the text dokument.















then you change the Value and the embed src to what game you want to play.
Dont forget to put   "".swf"" at the end.
as you can see i have written swords and sandals 2.
now you save the changes and now you can open your web reader and play the  game you want to play.

,demonon,2007-12-31T15:27Z,"Get flash player, I don't know why you don't have it.
Right click on the file, open with any webbrowser you desire e.g Firefox or IE.
I don't know how to save your games."
,t2BeDLaM,2008-01-04T05:30Z,"great upload! for these other peeps ""How do I play them"" lol
these are shockwave flash games, make sure you have it installed. Chances are you do. then just create a html file and add each game filename to its own link, save and click the names to play. Personally, example....
I have in a folder like this...
C:\games
Then open your browser and type in C:\games\whatever the name of game   and play!"
