Yes, you can burn the iso's to cd, or you can mount them with Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120%

Original-sims går att installera korrekt. Sen när man ska uppdatera kräver den cd 4, och när man då sätter i cd 4 ""blinkar"" det bara till, och uppdaten verkar inte installeras. När man sedan försöker installera exp. (university) så kräver den uppdatering och cd 4. När man då sätter i cd 4 kraschar hela installationen. Hur går man till väga?"

,megamanfre,2008-01-10T04:40Z,"Every time I try to extract The Sims 2 initial file (not one of the expansions) I get an error from WinRAR saying:

""The Sims 2 - (01) Original and nightlife.rar: CRC failed in The Sims 2 (01) Original and nightlife\Sims2Deluxe 1.mdf. The file is corrupt"" 

and 

""The Sims 2 - (01) Original and nightlife.rar: CRC failed in The Sims 2 (01) Original and nightlife\Sims2Deluxe 1.mds. The file is corrupt""

When I just browse the contents of all the .rar files without extracting, they show up in blue text.

I tried to install using the .iso burnt to CD, and got a few different error messages, just like the text file said.

Anyone else have this problem, or know what may be the cause, and a possible fix for it? I restarted the download, hoping that maybe it was something with when I downloaded it, but hoping I can somehow get the .iso install working.

I already have the sims 2 on disc but lost the Serial Number and couldn't find a good site to get the Number so I downloaded this torrent mostly for the Number and the Expansion packs.
I installed the Sims 2 with my disks, then installed the updates after I tried to install the expansions but at the end of the installation an error message would come up and it said ""Update couldn't be found, Terminating Installation"" and it stoped and de;eted everything. I then uninstalled everything but it wouldn't let me uninstall Sims 2 as it said there was Expansion still installed so I deleted evrything then uninstalled it but know every time   I try install the Sims 2 via the ISO files and Daemon Tools it comes up with (after the Serial Number Screen) Sims 2 University Expansion and Freezes at the end of Disk 2 ...

If you want to run your game from your stuff pack....you need to go to www.gamecopyworld.com
and get a ""crack"" for the game. Download the .exe crack file and copy it into the files where the game was installed. Replacing the original .exe file. 
otherwise, if you got freetime or any other current expansion, don't go any further.
just run your current expansion and you'll see your stuff!
don't worry cause it'll run all your expansions and stuff packs as long as they are installed properly.
Make sure you also have the most up to date patch for your current expansion ONLY.
*a tip: you only need to have one crack for the current most released game, like free time. hope this helps? :)"
,melissaishere,2008-07-25T18:18Z,"

This happens to me all the time...lol.
okay, before saving the game, go into your options menu and select ""don't show dialog box at start up"" and select ""custom content"" on. save game and restart the game. if that doesnt work switch them, save, and start over. i cannot totally remember exactly what it said, but close enough. you'll get it!!:)"

1. Open daemon tools and mount ""sims university CD 1"" and wait for autorun screen to load.
2. Go back onto Daemon Tools and change ""sims university CD 1"" mounted image for ""sims university CD 2""
3. Go back onto Autorun and click next, It will now ask for you to insert CD 1. 
4. Go back onto Daemon Tools and change ""sims university CD 2"" back to ""sims university CD 1""
5. Click OK on Autorun, enter serial number and click next again.
6. Once installation hits 78% it will (finally) ask for you to ""Insert Disc 2 into the Drive""
7. Go back onto Daemon Tools and change ""sims university CD 1"" to ""sims university CD 2""
8. Click OK, Watch Installation finish

Once it finished and it says it needs to check for an update click OK. If it comes up with an error ""The Sims installation cant continue please reinstall the sims 2"" click ok.. 
Now on the "" Setup will now terminate/discontinue"" Hit CONTROL + ALT + DEL ON your keyboard to open up task Manager. 
Go into Processes, highlight Autorun, and click ""End process""
Sims will be installed, and all is fine :D You can get the crack image file for university from:

I have followed the instructions and installed everything in the proper spot (i believe), and when i go to click the sims 2 icon it tells me to put in the H&M stuff cd, and when i do, it tells me to do it again, and it just closes out and wont load the game. WHAT DO I DO?"

Help"
,canababe23,2010-05-02T08:46Z,"xxcompleteprincessxx 

1st your game ask for cd because you have to take the crack example deluxe, and go to 

c:/computer.program files. eagames. and put crack in deluxe file. hope it works!!

and the other thing is to get it going like a dvd but there is no dvd in there you have to download 

deamon tools pro, you can find that at any torrent site also this one,, and then you can convert it so it plays it like a cd. but i am not too formiliar with that i am still testing it out myself.. hope it all works for you "
,canababe23,2010-05-03T06:06Z,Great Great upload thanks sooooooo much i just instaled the games + all expansions game works super good thanks soo much for the people that it say you need cd is because some people dont start sims 2 seasons but they start sims 2 start sims 2 seasons people thats how it works.. thanks soo much ubehage for this upload i keep seeding!!!!
,tigerjen,2010-06-15T11:02Z,"I'm not sure if anyone will ever read this comment but I think I'm out of luck otherwise.

I just downloaded everything and burned the images to dvds and all of that. I have the sims 2 installed already. I ran the update, installed all of the expansion packs, ran the second update, moved the crack, all in order. 

However, when I go to open the program it says to insert the correct disc. I've tried the original Sims 2 disc that I have, and H&M Fashion Stuff. Neither work. It tells me to ""please ensure the cd/dvd is in the drive, select ok and restart the application"" and to ""insert the correct cd/dvd and press ok to retry"" but nothing happens. After I press ok and restart it gives the same message. 

I don't claim to be tech-savvy, but I do know when a disc is in the drive, and it is. 

Any thoughts?"
,Brentbrw,2010-06-29T07:44Z,"Very nice man!
For people with startup problems, after your complete with installing, click the shortcut for SEASONS that it should have installed to your desktop.
you do NOT need to mount images to PLAY the game, after your DONE installing."

U MOUNT THE IMAGES , USE THE PROVIDED SEIRAL CODE (if none go to copyworld.com) INSTALL DRAG THE CRACK INTO THE INSTALL PLACE... (if theirs no crack to gamecopyworld) WALA U CAN PLAY  and if it asks for a 2nd cd just mount the 2nd it is so fucking simple"

,PC_Girl,2011-03-27T04:42Z,"Ok, so I'm a rookie at this whole 'Torrent thingy'. This is my very first Torrent download :)

My question has to do with the installation instructions. 

So far I have ""Installed the Original The SIMS2"", as stated in the instructions as Step 1. I mounted each ""Disk"" (1-4) one at a time and with each one I clicked on ""Burn Image With Astroburn. Then I installed ""The Original SIMS2"" with each disk (in order) as it prompted me to. 

After that, I proceeded with Step 2: I ran ""The SIMS2 Update"" from the ""Updates Folder"" and it updated successfully. 

So now I'm on to Step 3: ""Install the expansion packs in the correct order"". My question is this: What is the correct order? Is it what's listed below? I wanna make sure I install everything right so I don't mess it all up.  Any help from anyone is welcome and appreciated :) Thanks guys!

- The Sims 2 Nightlife (2 disks).
