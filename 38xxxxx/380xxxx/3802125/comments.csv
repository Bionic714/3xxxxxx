,Ioz-of-Mer,2007-09-10T17:06Z,This DVD has been recompressed to fit on a single layer disc. It's meant as an NTSC alternative to the PAL version found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3254834/Britney_Spears_Greatest_Hits__My_Prerogative_2004_-_complete_PAL
,aknid,2007-09-29T06:24Z,"seed this file, plzzzzz"
,jimmio,2007-09-29T10:54Z,plse more seeda
,aknid,2007-09-29T15:53Z,OMG! Im stuck at around 60% :(
,Ioz-of-Mer,2007-09-29T20:05Z,"Sorry folks, but the upload speeds on my end are painfully limited. I'll keep the torrent online for a couple months or longer, for as long as I can. Barring the occasional reboot or program restart, that'll be 24/7. Please be patient."
,aknid,2007-09-30T08:38Z,"thanks, mate! The speed is a lil bit faster now. I will help u seeding it, as soon as i have finished downloading :)"
,aknid,2007-10-07T17:25Z,"wow, there are so many seeds today :D"
,aknid,2007-10-07T19:04Z,"dunno why but im stuck at nearly 100%. It goes 99.8% then 99.9%, and then 99.8% again, and just keeps going like that :("
,aknid,2007-10-08T10:02Z,this is getting really annoying. How can i finish when it keeps going like that. im going crazy x(
,Ioz-of-Mer,2007-10-08T12:02Z,"Hey Aknid, I have no idea why you're getting the weird behavior from your client. Have you tried restarting it?  What software do you use?"
,aknid,2007-10-09T05:34Z,"I tried it like a hundred times but it stayed the same. BTW, i use uTorrent"
,Ioz-of-Mer,2007-10-09T12:07Z,"Are you using a feature called 'SuperSeeding' (Initial Seeding)? If you are, try turning it off and see what you get?  I tried looking up your problem but the only threads I could find dealt with seeding problems not download problems.
You can read through these links to see if they offer any solutions.

,Ioz-of-Mer,2007-10-09T12:11Z,What version of uTorrent are you using? I don't use uTorrent. Has anyone else had Aknid's problem?  
,Ioz-of-Mer,2007-10-09T12:42Z,I'm not sure if this will work but you could try copy-and-pasting the file and then resume downloading it with another BitTorrent client. If worse comes to worse I'll keep the file up till you get it.
,aknid,2007-10-12T06:13Z,thanks for ur help but i have deleted it :P Think i will try downloading it again someday :)
