This is John Leguizamo's stand up comedy that was aired on HBO awhile back.  Check the IMDB link for more info.  Picture isn't DVD quality, but it's not too shabby for what it is.  Any questions, feel free to leave a comment.  I will try to seed from 9 pm to 9 am but don't quote me on it if for some reason you aren't able to leech.  Hope you all enjoy!
