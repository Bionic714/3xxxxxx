,3ogdy,2012-06-28T17:56Z,"PEOPLE! Torrent Clients should have an option like uTorrent has: Initial Seeding. Right click on the torrent in your torrent client and click on Properties. In the newly opened window look at the bottom of it and you will find the ""Initial Seeding"" option. Make sure you check it and keep it enabled as long as you're downloading the files. After that make sure you uncheck it."
