S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of packed exe's (>ToeD-info.exe<)

as a lame virus, (coz it's the mostly byte by byte check error of  em!.)

This is truly a false information!,  a so called false positive, you can read 

and learn! more about in your VirusTool-Manual or WebSite!.
