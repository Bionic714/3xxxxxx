I am also looking for ""The Tien Tao Qi Gong Correspondence Course"" if anyone can seed that, the links that are out there are dead.

Thanks again for an excellent torrent and those who have seeded.

,Vtorimac,2009-03-22T16:02Z,Hi - I am very new to this arena. My step son 21 told me about it. I am very interested in qigong and ti chi but the download via Vuze has been going for 2 days now and I was wondering if that is normal. I have looked at the FQA with no avail. If someone could instruct I would appreciate it very much.

It all depends on the number of seeders and ur internet connection speed . The more seeders , the faster the download is . But if ur connection speed is like 100Mb/s but there's only like 2-3 seeders on a 2gb torrent , then the speed will be like around 20+kb/s and u need to wait for weeks to complete the download . Hope this helps :)"
