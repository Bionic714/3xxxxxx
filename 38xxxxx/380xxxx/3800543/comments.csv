,Sailingmaster,2008-02-09T22:23Z,"Game keeps crashing on me, error message comes up about options.ini

Anyone else getting this problem?  Or, know a way of fixing it?"
,thegirlwiththeflute,2008-02-11T00:40Z,"It probably has something to do with the .crk file.

I opened it with notepad, but all it gave was a bunch of code and the message ""Removes the CD-check. Remove CDilla protection wrapper first.""

Hopefully someone can clue us in. I only got it when I went through training and when I try to use quick play, but it's still really annoying."
,thegirlwiththeflute,2008-02-12T07:39Z,"I get this error:

exception: attempt to write to null in mw4! (+0x177D5D)

Anyone know what this means and/or how to fix it?"
,Rhainor,2008-03-04T21:57Z,"Crack works fine for me, but the I get no video and I can't do anything.  I have to three-finger-salute and use the Task Manager to kill it in order to exit the game."

,Terrial,2008-11-06T09:17Z,"Game istalled fine for me... just use daemon tools to mount the iso, apply the patch from the virtual drive, then copy all the content from the virtual drive to the game dir :)"
,Terrial,2008-11-06T12:19Z,sorry I made a typo ^ copy the content from the crack folder to game dir
,MorpheusOmikron,2009-01-12T10:03Z,"Had a strange problem. Mounted image and installed game, but couldn't run it, said it ""Couldn't find the cd"" I have a few ISO games and they don't do this to me :("
,HeeroHikari,2009-01-14T20:25Z,yea i dont get it -_-
,HeeroHikari,2009-01-15T15:17Z,i think you have to have mechwarrior 4 mercenaries to run it
,HeeroHikari,2009-01-15T15:41Z,still doesn't work i just think this is just a bad file and i say don't download it!
,Terrial,2009-01-20T00:09Z,MorpheusOmikron & HeeroHikari: u have to copy all the content from the crack folder to the installation directory (only 2 files if i remember correctly) ........... i got this game working very well!
,Levethian,2009-07-07T13:01Z,"Rhainor, I thought that was an error too, but its normal...

Starting the game for the first time needs patience while the game configures, then the AutoConfig thing will open, allow you to continue, and it should work fine.

Thanks for the upload :)"
,maleus,2009-10-10T15:41Z,"Hi all!
I downloaded the torrent. Extracted, copied the crack file, than deleted it. After this mounted on Demon tools. Istalls and runs perfectly. No problem so far. Crack works just fine so as the upgrade pack. 
It cant see tha mech packs though. But that is not a big problem for me.
Thanx for upload. Will seed for 3 months.
