Requiem (2006) is a German language film by Hans-Christian Schmid starring Sandra Huller. The film has been promoted as a more truthful depiction of the real-life events of the exorcism of Anneliese Michel (September 21, 1952 - July 1, 1976), a German woman who was believed to have been possessed by six or more demons. These events also served as the the basis of Scott Derrickson's 2005 movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
