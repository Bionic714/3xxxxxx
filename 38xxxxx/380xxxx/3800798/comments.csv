This doesn't work so WELL.................."
,girlygirl00,2007-09-10T06:53Z,I am not sure why you are having this issue.  I have downloaded all updates and other things such as templates and haven't had any problem with it asking me for my key.  It has worked flawlessly for me.
,girlygirl00,2007-09-10T06:56Z,"sorry, i just wanted to clarify what i said earlier:  ""haven't had any problem with it asking me for my key"".....by that i mean...it does not ask me for the key."

,IrvingDJ,2007-09-30T07:48Z,"I ran the office.reg file, and it confirmed the file was added to my reg.  When I tried to download a template, it said I didn't have a genuine version of ms office.  Any thoughts?"
,gorillaz3d,2007-09-30T14:26Z,"I uploaded a real good version of office here

,samiedu,2007-10-01T14:13Z,"When I doubleclick the reg file, Notepad opens and views the content...doesnt ask 'Yes' or anything. What am I doing wrong?"
,samiedu,2007-10-01T14:30Z,"Nevermind, found a solution thanks to Google :)"
,girlygirl00,2007-10-02T05:35Z,"IrvingDJ...i am not sure why you wouldn't be able to download any templates.  i haven't had any problems at all.  my only suggestion might be to uninstall office and reinstall then try again.  sorry i'm not much help.  let me know if you have any luck, and if so, what you did to make it work.

samiedu...i sure didn't have the problem you had!  i am glad you were able to find a solution!  :)"
,LukeJay,2007-10-08T20:28Z,Is there something similiar for 2003 ? Or should I say would this procedure work for 2003 ?
,girlygirl00,2007-10-09T16:14Z,i never had any issues with my 2003 so i cannot honestly say.  i am guessing that this particular registry modification would not work though...because i would assume that the registry for 2007 was written differently than that for 2003??  sorry i couldn't help.  :(
,ConChimBayXa,2007-11-15T17:52Z,"hi girlygirl00  this works!!   thx   kindness...for sharing...  'sharing is caring'   hehe

,AMIRZ,2008-06-28T17:36Z,"Yes, I have tried it. Very succesful to make my office 2007 enterprise  genuine. However, where could i find same stuff but for Office 2003 pro as well? One more, if i do a repair /reinstall of Office 2007, it seems not able anymore by doing this trick. Do you have any suggestion please? Thx Bro/Sis. "
,girlygirl00,2008-07-02T06:17Z,AMIRZ...i do not know of one for office 2003.  i have the office 2003 that has been around for download forever...and it never needed anything extra. i was always able to update and also download templates.  as for a reinstall/repair...i am not sure.  once you reinstalled or repaired...did you try double clicking on the .reg again to reapply it?
,AMIRZ,2008-07-22T22:13Z,"Hello Girlygirl. sorry for late reply. About ""genuine fact"" of your Office 2003, i am very interested with it, please could you tell me/us how to make it 100% genuine?  About reg file, thanks I have retried it as you said, and finally it 's 100% fixed! Thanx alot for this great torrent Sis'. great work, Regards -Amirz

Piratebay rocks!"

,girlygirl00,2008-08-09T07:54Z,"you're welcome everyone :)

AMIRZ, now i am the one responding late!  sorry about that.  :)  as i said in my earlier response...i don't have a reg file for 2003, as i never needed one for mine.  i don't know which particular office 2003 you have, but you might want to just uninstall the one you have and download and use this one:

once you download it...then if you are unable to find the serial for it...check the user comments because one of them posted the serial.  this is the exact same serial that i used for mine and it has worked great!  i am able to update and download whatever i need for it.  i hope this helps!  :)"
