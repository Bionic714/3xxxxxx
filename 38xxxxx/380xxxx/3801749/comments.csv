,pakron1122,2007-09-11T03:22Z,"Once you guys start getting this file completed, let me know how it compares to the other guys' torrents. If it compares favorably, I can upload the other 5 movies. I noticed my rip is a higher resolution and framerate, and NTSC native. It is a straight rip from the HBO broadcast, and I didn't run it through any converters or compressions. I'll leave that up to you all if you wish. Not sure if this one turns out better, but give it the old eye test and let me know!"

,torpidfence,2007-10-04T22:55Z,"Excuse me

How is the picture encoded? avi? mpg? my pc has issues with avi and i would like to know before i invest the time.

thx"
,pakron1122,2007-10-07T04:10Z,"You can see the file anf format by clicking on the torrent, and then clicking ""open"". Your torrent client should open and display the contents of the torrent, which in this case is a .mpg file. Hope this helps."
,Vadim Makarov,2007-11-17T22:22Z,Does the 30 fps framerate mean motion is going to be jerky? Or does a software player actually sort the frames into 25 or 24 fps properly when playing this?
,pc39707,2008-01-27T20:29Z,how do i fit this on cd? can i winzip it to 700mb?
,pakron1122,2008-06-21T03:21Z,"vadim, 30fps plays perfectly.

pc39707, are you serious? Why dont you just put it on vhs tape instead? If you want a cd version, this isnt it. This is meant to be burned to a dvd 9 and played on a hd or blu ray player. Or just leave it on your pc."
