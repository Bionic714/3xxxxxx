,NightCaller3,2008-04-04T02:21Z,It seems that sound and picture aren't in cordination. Did anybody had same problem? Is there a way to fix this problem?
,cabdriverjim,2008-05-02T06:33Z,Its not so much that audio/video are out of sync.  It sounds like the audio track is total garbage.  Seems like about every 10 seconds one or two seconds of audio just totally disappears leaving the video further and further out of sync.
,cabdriverjim,2008-05-02T06:35Z,"VLC says the AVI Index is corrupted.  Running the repair still doesn't fix the sync problem.  The repair does allow the file to play properly, though.  Several video players I have refused to play it before the repair."
,thewolfdog123,2008-08-20T21:49Z,"I had the same problem too but I think some of the movie is missing I remember that when he was a kid he performed in front of some adults and was using foul language.

and the audio part is really annoying.

but thanks for the up"
