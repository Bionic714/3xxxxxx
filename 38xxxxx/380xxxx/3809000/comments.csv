I never put viruses, McAfee may recognise this as some trojan, many have said that. So don't complain! 'Cause it is virus free!"

,kanonkas,2007-11-02T22:00Z,"Shut up hallvall or whatever your name is, if you read what he said it says ""Why did you password protect the 7z archive ""DudeRisk Production""""

what he said was: ""Because, many torrent sites try to host my torrent without permission to share on other sites.""

2nd it's 2 zips inside the 1 because he wants you to download both, I've tested it and kaspersky and nod32 said it was ok, now shut up you weird sweden dude, ok? I respect him, you haven't even uploaded anything so just shut up, youth these days? Huh?! "
,kanonkas,2007-11-02T22:02Z,"No, he zipped it 2 times because, first you need to extract it, then it's one 7z. that needs a password, so you extract the other one first and gets it, then use it on the other one, that explains it? "
