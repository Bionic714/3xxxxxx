http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html
and download that, you will need a file from TI's actual website too to run it, you can find that here
http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti89.html?bid=8

that program will emulate any TI calc, no need to torrent"

As far as I know you are wrong.  Virtual TI (vti) requires a ROM image (.rom file), which is not the same as a calculator operating system (.89u for example, which you linked to).  I am not able to import a .89u file, nor does the import work when I alter the file extensions.

,connie111,2008-01-31T07:18Z,"Thanks for this, it looks real neat. I have and use the TI-89, and can't wait to see what this does.

Thanks!!!!"

,fogus,2009-01-04T04:59Z,"I don't have much upload bandwidth, sorry.  I can guarantee that this will be seeded by yours truly until something completed replaces it (as with all my torrents)."
,horrorjunky,2010-04-28T17:34Z,please seed i have been stuck at 0% complete for like 3 days now  and there are only 5 seederes....so plz seed
,horrorjunky,2010-04-28T17:38Z,can this think create graphs for Quadratic Equations??? cuz thats wat i need this for cuz i am having a hard time trying to figure out how this math crap works........im not stupid...its just i have a hard time understanding math and my older sister lost her 110 graphing cal. and so my parents wont buy me one so i have been looking for a torrent  an d i found this one...but for 3 days i havnt even gotten  1% complete so plz seed my chances pf passing algebra 1 depends on it 
,sundi712,2011-01-17T23:05Z,all of the emulators I have found do need ROM files. I found a torrent with seeds but their upload sucks so far
,thistleman,2011-02-14T03:33Z,"Dude, Fogus, I love you for putting this up. It literally saved my calculus grade. Seriously... SOOO USEFUL!!!!!!!"
