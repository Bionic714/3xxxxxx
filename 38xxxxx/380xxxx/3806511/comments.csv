What would be the best way to proceed? Should I remove the torrent? I hesitate to do so only because people are already downloading. I would be grateful for any advice."
,bladderpuss,2007-09-14T17:33Z,I find it fascinating that the people that are the biggest jerks on these bittorrent sites are always the ones who have lousy or no share ratios. Svettipunk has no uploads at all.

Tomorrow, I can start posting my torrents in the right place...
but you'll STILL be an asshole."
