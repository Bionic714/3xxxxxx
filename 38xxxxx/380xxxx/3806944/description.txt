MediaDefender-Defenders proudly presents 9 months worth of
internal MediaDefender emails

By releasing these emails we hope to secure the privacy and 
personal integrity of all peer-to-peer users. The emails 
contains information about the various tactics and technical 
solutions for tracking p2p users, and disrupt p2p services.

A special thanks to Jay Maris, for circumventing there entire 
email-security by forwarding all your emails to your gmail 
account, and using the really highly secure password: blahbob 


So here it is, we hope this is enough to create a viable 
defense to the tactics used by these companies, also there 
should be enough fuel to keep the p2p bloggers busy for 
quite some time.
