This is a lengthy email, but I just wanted to get these issues down on paper.   I know many of these are being worked on or are low priority.  Queue them up for the team as you see fit.  



One new concept:  Octavio makes a good point that things that are manually queued should probably go below the 3 current transfers.  They can move or delete the top three, but it is somewhat disarming to see your download that was 70% done to just vanish.  It would be nice to keep a record of how done a download is even if it is not in the top three but not a critical feature.  



Here is the list of features/fixes.



The port probe error in ?recently downloaded? when the web page is launched.  BTW, I get the same error when I launch the library page from the tray icon.  



Animated pics work on the media page, which is awesome, but it seems to be refreshing the whole page about 10 times.  After that it is smooth.  



Still need searches for Library and History



History should have check boxes for deleting specific entries



Enlarging the queue and library images



Hard drive management from the tray icon.  Basically making sure we don?t take too much space on small hard drives.  



Search with the family filter on goes pretty slow sometimes.  Other times it works fast.  I assume this has to do with the amount it is filtering out.  Not sure if anything can be done, but just wanted to note it.  



Fitting the whole page in my browser resolution.  It is only a few pixels off.  



Quicktime files don?t play in my browser.  Prob because they are trying to play in Windows Media.  Not an urgent prob.  



Uninstalling miivi should give the option to remove all downloaded files.  



Miivi installer should create a launch from the program files that brings up the queue page.  



We should make the applet download like the application so that it does not over burden XP. 



The applet should recommend installing miivi if the user is trying to download more that three things at once using it.  



I am getting an error in the bottom left corner of the applet downloader.  It seems to work but there is some sort of error.  



I don?t think the bandwidth sliders in the applet are functional yet.

Here are the examples of the files we talked about for U2.  Keep in mind there are infinite potentials of implementation and combination.  These are only meant as talking point examples.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of ideas for the file formatting: 

Apply Lowpass/Highpass Filters

Add Static

Changing Bitrate

Modulated Bitrate

Re-encoding to a low bitrate then back to a high one

Adding random noise 

Lowering or raising the volume over the course of a song

Applying a periodic volume wave

Switching from Stereo to Mono

Switching audio from left channel to right channel

Changing between Left and right channels

Adding Channels

Adding Audience Noise

Adding a laugh track

Adding Reverb/Echoing

Adding Voiceovers / advertisements

Blanking out random words

Censoring/beeping random words



We don?t want people to think the song sucked.  We don?t want people to think the file was deliberately altered.  We don?t want people to find patters in the decoys to listen for.  We want people to think these are natural aberrations in mp3 encoding.  Feel free to forward this to whoever needs to see it.

The dead torrents will be moved to the ?dead_torrents? folder on the ftp site. QA can verify those torrents to see if they are really dead or very much alive.

So, Randy loves the animated thumbs.  You can probably guess what that means.  He wants the thumbs in the queue, lib., fav., and hist. to be a little bit bigger (maybe 100x75 ?).  He also wants the media page view to have the animation.

but changing the health bars would mean people think that's what a healthy file looks like.  and if those files download very slowly (and are ostensibly healthy), that would look bad, no?

if the featured section of the site ever is an appealing reason for people to come to the site, those files would be downloaded and re-shared frequently.  i'm not sure i understand why we would ""puff up"" health on these files.

Gerald manually changed the health bars specifically on the Featured Content page so they would all be above 3 (because the ones with low health were all uploaded by myself directly). He is now setting it up so that for those vids only, the health bars will be the same throughout the site (including the queue).

Dylan,

The health indicators for videos on the Featured page is COMPLETELY different from how the health indicator for those same videos is when they're placed in my queue, suggesting that MiiVi-sourced videos aren't properly calculated for health on queue.php.  Videos from MiiVi network that have blue and green health bars, when queued show the single red line for few sources....

Also, we talked about the kludgy un-scaleable publishing, and he thought we should stick published files toward the top of people's queues until we get a more complete 'network drive' solution in place.  I told him sticking them in queues would require the least development, but it might be confusing.  He thought it would be fine in the short term. 

Anybody have any thoughts on that?

No, they weren't in order of importance, it was more the order I remembered them, but they are all ""necessary"" for launch. 


Feedback - go to a Youtube movie page. Under the movie, to the right, is a link ""Flag as inappropriate"".  Same thing.
Embedded - Randy wanted to embed the applet, but I told him that would be a pain, so he said a linked thumbnail/screenshot would be fine.
Metadata - all the stuff under the embedded movie that's currently hard coded.
Yes, the tivo warning that a file will be deleted soon unless you say to keep it.
Preview - Yeah,the first 10MB thing.  Now that you're feeding the data from the app, maybe you can just send whatever's been downloaded(and written to disk) up to that point.

Two other things:
Installing the App from the Applet.
Systray app for windows.  Serg is already working on a systray service, but he'll need to be able to communicate with the app.

Publishing
Comments
Favorites


and Jay said:


Publish,
feedback(inappropriate content),
link and embed URL(like Youtube),
rating,
Metadata
warning file about to be deleted(TIVO)
Preview


So the publish we agree on. What is ""Feedback"" going to be? Link is fine, embed ... How the fuck are you going to do that shit? Rating, fine. ""Metadata"" means what? Warning about deleting a file is already in there ... Unless you mean ""Warning, this file is going to be deleted soon."" like TiVo kind does? Preview ... The first 10mb? I'm going to have to think how to do that one.

It's not much, but it's a start. The conversions are about as good as the first opt-in for ringtones on a cell phone (about 1 in 300). RK converts 1 in 6500 on avg, using credit card. Adult friend finder converts 1 in 2000 on limewire. If we want more users, Dylan's eDonkey messages would get us a lot of Europeans that are a little bit older crowd....

""Jay, Octavio and Randy,

Attached is how the downloads for our Uber 2 Kanye West and 50 Cent files have gone out over the holiday weekend on gnutella.  We don't have any comparable way of looking at this on eMule or Ares at this time.  This Uber 2 experience so far is basically a test/dry-run of the real decoy distribution system that Jay's team is going to start developing soon.

Keep in mind the attachment is from our legacy gnutella file distribution system (Ivan's original decoying system).  The thing I find interesting is Kanye West's tracks were downloaded from us more frequently than 50 Cent tracks.  Let me know if you're interested in having more data like this pulled from the gnutella decoying system.
