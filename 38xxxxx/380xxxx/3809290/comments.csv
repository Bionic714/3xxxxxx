,Stevo24,2007-12-22T07:53Z,"SEED PPL. If u do, ill seed for u!"
[T],agentpiratebay,2007-12-23T09:22Z,"Most of the time when the ""corrupted file"" is experienced (installing games, unrar, etc), it is because your download is not 100% complete, assuming your not using a fake torrent.

Bitcomet will run auto hash-check every time you finish downloads.  If your client dun have this feature, you must hash-check manually.  It is likely that your client shows 100% complete when your task is in fact not complete, especially the size of contents are huge, like this one (2.24GB in total).  You can seperately perform the hash-check of the files, that would be better than if you hash-check all the files at the same time.

To manually hash-check, you need to remove the task first, then open the torrent like you did before.  Your client will automatically hash-check before seeding or downloading.  Repeat the hash-check until your are convinced the files are 100% complete.

This torrent is awesome!  You dun really need other software, like Daemon Tool, in order to install or play the game.  Simply double-click the ""setup"" and your homefree.  Make sure you go through the settings of the game, because it is preset as ""very high"" for every performance.  Select ""Auto detect"" would be wise.

Hope my two cents help... "

,ragnapunk,2011-09-05T06:09Z,"for Far Cry no crack just go to www.gamecopyworld.com and for those who has black screen problem its because this game needs shader 2.0 or up it depends if your video card supports it,just download the latest update for your video card or just go to
http://www.systemrequirementslab.com check if you can run that game on that pc."
