,0jizzmaster0,2008-10-13T21:41Z,"You must be seriously deluded if you call this good quality.  Although a child may not know the difference, I do.  Why would someone not want an original copy of a movie as it appeared in theaters?  Not only is this fullscreen but it is obviously very compressed.  It looks and sounds like VHS and it's in PAL (not really a problem but c'mon WTF?  PAL is just such a hassle and it's got a low frame rate which gives me a headache).

So, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS if you have any respect at all for quality or having movies in closest to original quality as possible.  It literally looks like this guy recorded it from a VHS tape.

I am extremely disappointed and this is really starting to piss me off (this happens quite often; low quality, fullscreen, PAL etc...)

Here's a suggestion.  When you make a DVD rip, RIP IT AS IS AND DO NOT CHANGE A FUCKING BIT OF THE ORIGINAL.  Do not compress it.  Do not ""shrink"" it.  Leave it as is and let the downloader decide what he/she wants to do with it.  I think it's a slap in the face to the people that made the movie (more so than not getting paid) for it to be so chopped up and shitty.

This torrent is a disgrace.  I hope you do better next time.

P.S.  Why are people so obsessed with DVD5?  You're already getting the god damn movie for free and you can't pay 50 cents extra per DVD to watch it in full quality?  The whole point of DVD was to ADVANCE in quality, not to be stuck at VHS quality.  SHIT!"
,0jizzmaster0,2008-10-13T21:44Z,"This reminds of those DVDs you buy on the corner.  Yes it's cheap and the movies aren't out on DVD yet but it's so shitty it's not even worth the 5 bucks you pay for it.

Thanks for wasting my time and HD space."
