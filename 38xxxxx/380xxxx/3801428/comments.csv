Thanks for your efforts."

,TheNethos,2011-10-06T20:12Z,There are a few good password crackers for archives out there to get around stuff like that. Problem is most of the time the whole point is to get you to register on their site so the contents of the file are just something they found somewhere else and slapped a password on.
