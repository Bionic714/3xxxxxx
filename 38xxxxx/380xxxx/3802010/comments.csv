,dirtyodesertdog,2007-09-13T18:37Z,Ive downloaded both 310 to Yuma's and neither one will work.Like every one is saying.Must be a fake are just doesn't work.I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.
,techfella,2007-09-13T19:46Z,I'm posting because I did figure out how to burn the CDs. I went straight to the .bin files using Nero. So far this is the same upload as all the rest. Poor video quality and fare sound 6/10 rating. It's a good movie which makes it worth watching. I too am waitng for a better copy to surface.
