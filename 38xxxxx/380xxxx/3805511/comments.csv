,TujaBuja,2007-09-16T08:57Z,SEED PLEASE :D
,D0rus,2007-09-16T11:08Z,"Lovely collection. Untested, but it looks good.

One thing makes me wonder trough: What kind of moron are you when you seed both the packed (rar) files, and the unpacked files?

No need to download the files in the (01), (02) ... (12) dirs. They contain the same files as the rar files in the main dir. You can spare yourself half the download size and time that way."
,rundini,2007-09-16T11:15Z,Is this multi-language?
,NinaGreen,2007-09-16T14:43Z,"Hur installerar man The sims 2 ? 
måste man bränna ut det på skiva? 
jag får inte alls rätt på det. / tack . "
,TujaBuja,2007-09-16T21:43Z,"Det går att instrallera Jorden Runt (bon voyage) men sedan när man ska spela spelet, så står det ""Sätt i orginal skivan"" Snälla!! Hjälp mig!"
,JimmyAM,2007-09-16T21:58Z,"Dear Citron,
first let me thank you for the share, second I have 2 questions, 1. are those packs and the original game (The Sims 2) working and tested by you? 2. are they cracked and need cd/dvd to work or not?, have in mind that I have the original game (all 4 CDs) and it is working great with the no-cd crack but I cannot use my building tools same as most of the users who have the no-cd crack.

thank you once more
be well and safe,
Jimmy"
,TujaBuja,2007-09-16T22:50Z,"Sådär, jag fick rätt på det !! det fungerar utmärkt! Tack så grymt mycket !! [ Thank you SO mutch ]."
,steff_ice,2007-09-16T23:01Z,Multilang?
,steff_ice,2007-09-17T01:26Z,(Swedish lang)?
,citr0n,2007-09-17T16:46Z,"det finns svenska..
After installing all expansions copy Sims2EP6.exe from the fairlight folder on the bon voyage cd and paste it into your TSBin directory of the Bon Voyage install(Overwriting the current copy. If you try to drag and drop windows will just make a short cut, so make sure to use copy and paste.)"
,citr0n,2007-09-17T18:23Z,"yeah it have multilang
the no-cd crack is in the  fairlight folder on the bon voyage cd its named (Sims2EP6.exe)
paste it in your TSBin directory of the Bon Voyage folder thats should work its work perfect for me and some other sry by the rar files and the folder:S"
,steff_ice,2007-09-19T01:30Z,"Bara en fråga...varför är den här typ dubbelt så stor som dom andra torrentarna? Dom andra ligger ju på mellan 8-10 gig, och den här på nästan 18?!"
,citr0n,2007-09-19T10:51Z,jag råkade lägga in RAR filerna och mapparna i torrenten:S

,steff_ice,2007-09-21T18:28Z,Men The Sims 2 Deluxe har ju bara engelska och spanska??? Det skulle ju vara multi (svenska) på alla?!
,citr0n,2007-09-22T18:55Z,om man instalerar den sista kan man välja svenska vissa finns det inte multilang men om man installerar verionen efter kan man välja svenska och då blir det svenska!

,IDtje,2007-11-20T12:17Z,"I don't get it...

I installed everything just as you said in the notepad-file. But in the end, the file of the ""bon voyage"" folder just isn't responding. Well, actually, it does respond, but only with a big X, what means that something must be wrong.

Can you please tell me what's wrong? 'cause I installed all the games and according to your file, it would have to start then.

Even the sims 2 without expensions isn't reacting. So everything went ok, untill the start of the game...

Anyone who knows to solve this issue?

Thanks,

Martin"

I installed the Sims 2 Deluxe (the first part), and when i wanted to install Univerity it all went smooth, untill the end. It said that the program will try to update the game or something. I clicked ok (the only option) and then it said 'update not completed sucsesfully, installation will now terminate'. I was like, wtf?
