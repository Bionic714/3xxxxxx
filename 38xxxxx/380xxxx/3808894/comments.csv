,IvanPIC,2007-09-16T20:26Z,"Hallo, for me The RatDVD is something like compresion utility for Dvd Video. It allows you to compres dvd to 1 - 1.5 Gb and save download time.Program have 2 mods. First is to conpress and second to uncompress ratdvd file to original."
,piffy,2007-09-16T21:33Z,Wrong category!!
,ScorpioTiger,2007-09-17T04:22Z,Only one problem. DVDs are already a compressed format. The only way to significantly compress any further is to use lossy compression (ie. You lose some of the original data. This is NOT recoverable). RatDVD uses lossy compression and it is NOT possible to restore back to the original DVD.

,duns2068,2007-09-18T21:41Z,"ratDVD takes a full featured DVD movie and puts it into a highly compressed .ratDVD container format file - while preserving all the features of the original DVD such as: 

-Full anamorphic picture, seamless branching, multiple video angles, multiple audio channels, subpictures, etc. 
-Keep movie versions (Directors Cut, Theatrical version, etc.), Alternate story endings, making of, video commentary , cut scenes, etc.. 
-Keep complete menus, navigation and features 
-Reliable high quality, valid check-summed container. 

You can also convert a .ratDVD file back to DVD format, burn it to a DVDR and watch the movie using a regular DVD player. 

ratDVD supports metatags similar to ID3 tags in MP3 files. The metatags can contain information about the movie, such as title, actors, year of release, plot outline etc. It can even include a thumbnail of the DVD cover. The information for the tags is automatically retrieved from IMDB. "
