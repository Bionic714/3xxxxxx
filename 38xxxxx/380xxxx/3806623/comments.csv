,nativecodder,2007-09-16T02:45Z,Thanxs. I wonder when their next update comes out. I've actually got this 3.3 but the critical updates is June/July. Hopefully they update it with the Aug/Sept updates.
,BlackBird1010111,2007-10-01T17:42Z,"You can download critical updates from Microsoft and drop them into their respective folders in the Customizer. I'm pretty sure the program just enumerates the folder and runs everything in there. Just make sure the update supports the /silent and /norestart options.

Also, app expires November 4, 2007."
,TheKingfish,2007-11-06T22:20Z,Thanks BlackBird but any chance of uploading the 3.4.0 version since this one is now expired and rolling back the computer's clock is getting to be a pain?
