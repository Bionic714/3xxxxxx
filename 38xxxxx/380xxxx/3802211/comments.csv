,martinmupp,2007-09-11T00:05Z,"Haha, I'm totally astonished by the amount of seeders this torrent has assembled since I put it up earlier this evening. I did it simply to share some nice music with a couple of friends, but this went far further I think.. ;)

Quiltys first album (from wich I have taken the three Quilty songs in this torrent) can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3347833/Quilty_-_A_Drop_Of_Pure (I try to seed it, but of some reason I can't download more than 99% percent of it.. :-/)"

,djnforce9,2007-11-10T22:32Z,I like all genres but I go crazy over Irish music. It seems to have a high appeal for me and evidently for many others too according to the seeding stats.
,martinmupp,2007-12-11T16:36Z,"Now I also seed both albums by Quilty, a great band playing irish folk tunes, featured in this torrent!
