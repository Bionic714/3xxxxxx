,Jekyll007,2011-04-07T15:59Z,This is an EXE file.  At first I was apprehensive but I took a chance just to see.  It is just a self-extracting file.  I've scanned it.  It's harmless to the best I can see.  It will self extract the AutoCAD 14 CD contents and inside is a TXT file with the serial.  as expected from the early 90's.......

Thank you andock! I've been looking for this!

Back in the 90's i use to write Autolisp programs that makes drawing in Autocad easy.  Until now some programs i wrote in AutoLISP (unpublished) does not reflect in recent versions of autocad.  I'll try to rerun them again 'coz R14 is still the quicker option at least in 2D.

Nice upload... thanks again...
