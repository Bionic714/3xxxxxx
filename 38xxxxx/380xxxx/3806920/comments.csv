,mu57i11,2007-09-29T16:59Z,"You no what really pisses me off? Its when people just post comments about how you wouldn't want to download something and how it contains viruses.
1: If you don't want to download it, move on, there are obvesouly other people who do.
2: This torrent was reasently reported as containing viruses. for fucks sake."
,DIVXHacker,2007-10-21T14:59Z,"seed please, the pack I have iz old!

I have my antivirus off when downloading things like this. Problem is, I get attacked, and a bunch of viri install themselves. 

I just simply reinstall the OS after booting a French WinXP on CD, and copying the archive to a backup hard drive.

C'est la vie!"
