But I seriously doubt it...

Please explain ""Good quality""...?"

As I stated in the email, there is a difference between dvdrip and R5. Both R5's that are out are nuked as mislabeled workprints.

DVDRips are always off the retail version unless stated otherwise. In this case, Otniel just said nothing really, R5 or not.

@ lexxx3b

There is no rule whatsoever that prevents me from commenting before I download. Often enough I am 100% spot on when saying ""fake"". This time, I was just saying that the info is missing and that does not make the whole thing more trustworthy. Right or wrong?

I downloaded my share of crap and fakes and I learned to look closely before downloading, and now, whenever I see something obvious, I post a comment and contact TPB. Only way to make people more aware and prevent some of them to DL fakes. 

Honestly, if uploaders would follow the naming conventions, provide info about their source and don't put it all in one rar or zip, I'd be one happy downloader..."
