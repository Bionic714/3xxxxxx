Note About Dual Audio Tracks
	These .AVIs are all Dual Audio. To properly play them, I reccommend
	Video Lan Client (VLC). All videos have been tested using that program.
	If you choose to use mplayer, use the -aid 2 to listen to the second
	audio track.

Note About Audio Tracks Regarding File-Sizes
	Scene rules say that these file sizes are not right... They aren't... 
	However, if you want to make them right, use a program and 
	disable the second audio stream in each AVI, then re-save the 
	.avi copying the video and audio stream. If you do that, all episodes
	fit to 172 MB. 
	
	Reason why it's encoded that way?: 172 MB AVI with 2 audio streams
	means degraded video quality to fit in 172 MB. The way it's been 
	encoded is that the video and audiotrack1 together are a 172 MB AVIs, 
	and there's no video quality loss with the adding of the second audio 
	track.
