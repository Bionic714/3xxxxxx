,averde,2008-04-20T10:02Z,It's not easy to get those /&%%造造&%造/ flac-files out as wav pr mp3. You loose interest in the album before you get that far. Uploader is probably a arrogant geek - and an asshole....
,ArsNova,2008-05-24T13:43Z,"@ averde
you should be more appreciative.
flac is a pretty normal audio format these days.
there is nothing more stubborn or resistant to change as stupidity."

I thought 'bout that the same way but till the moment I understood whats going on.
Actually - music in FLAC format is in better audio quality, it is more ""juicy"" than in mp3 format.
Of course - mp3 files are in diferent bit rate, that is the reason.
Everyone can convert FLAC files in mp3 using Switch Sound File Converter -
this software is for free.
Only one thing, before converting - need to change bit rate options, the best one is 320 kbps.
Good luck!

Thnx uper!"
