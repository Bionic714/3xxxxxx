,rogard,2007-09-09T10:07Z,"Shagster is right. There is no aXXo release of this film, therefore it is AT LEAST mislabeled and I bet my ass it's a FAKE!

iaintnocop, your name might be well chosen, but unfortunately you could have named yourself like this as well:

""iaintverybright"" ""iaintolderthan12"" ""iamasillyperson"" LOL."

,jeiroq,2007-10-17T15:24Z,"""This is real, I just downloaded and checked.
Please don't make comments about fake if you are not sure.""

But.. it is fake. It's not an aXXo release therefor it can't be ""real"". Maybe it's a movie but the name that this person has to use in order to make it known is what's in question here. 

""shagster, your commentary is ridiculous and sad. You're the little retarded gimp hanging on the big mighty axxo's every word...""axxo, master master, let me bask in the light of your genius..."" sad pathetic little person...""

Actually it's not ridiculous or sad, axxo is known for quality releases and has a reputation from that. Go suck on your nutsack. "
