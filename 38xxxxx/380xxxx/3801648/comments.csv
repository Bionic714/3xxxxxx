,rwencel09,2008-01-29T17:43Z,"what the hell is .m4a? all i want is a simple .mp3 format that i can listen to and burn. can somebody help me out and tell me how to make it .mp3?

/thumbs up"
,Hunter_Killer_117,2008-02-21T06:43Z,"You have to convert it if you want it in .mp3 format, I would advise against it because .mp4 is a better format as it is obviously the upgraded .mp3. If you still want to convert it you should just search for audio converter. I can't recommend one at the moment because I don't have one anymore.
As an afterthought, .mp4 is also the format videos have to be in able to play them on your iPod."
,Hunter_Killer_117,2008-02-21T06:48Z,"lol Sorry, I read your comment incorrectly I thought you said .mp4. Sorry for my misunderstanding. I don't know exactly what .m4a files are for off the top of my head."
,Milkandham2,2008-03-18T23:38Z,.m4a is the format itunes uses for ipods and they have it coded so that you can't take ipod to dif comps and copy all the music from the library to ipod and vice versa
,FCCKiller,2008-03-31T23:52Z,"In response to what Milkandham2 said, that would only be the case if the m4a files are DRM protected. 

These torrent m4a files are not DRM protected."
