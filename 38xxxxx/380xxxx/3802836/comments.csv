,Noodlehorn,2008-03-24T13:50Z,Can somebody help please? I'm trying to play The Hill which I've downloaded from TPB. There is pic but no sound on any player. In Nero ShowTime it says I need this Plug-In. I have downloaded it and opened it. I've clicked the install button but nothing much happens. Where do I enter the serial no.? NeroShowTime still has no sound. I have Nero OEM installed.
,Noodlehorn,2008-03-25T13:49Z,"Forget all this, forget Nero. I've just downloaded and installed VLC Medi Player free and it plays everything WITH SOUND! Easy as pie!"

Seems to work.....always had trouble with burning file with audio bitrate 256 and above and had to use convertxtodvd but i like the quality of nero better.....hope it really works!

,vertechs,2010-12-12T20:47Z,"Uh, Trojan?!  McAfee picked up an Artmemis trojan when this file was downloaded.  I doublechecked.  those who have already downloaded this, ya might wanna check your files or pc.  Someone may have screwed with the original files.  This rarely happens to me, just a heads up.    "
