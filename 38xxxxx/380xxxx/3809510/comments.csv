,frantzpan,2007-09-17T18:51Z,so does it werk?
,_j0n_,2007-09-17T22:28Z,did ya try it?
,_j0n_,2007-09-17T22:28Z,it worked for me. - I even got it on Live.
,AuburnT5,2007-09-18T03:17Z,is there any way to get this game installed/running on XP?
,_j0n_,2007-09-18T03:44Z,"there is a way, but it requires a file that I don't have and is already on here.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3729916/%5BPC%5D_Halo_2_XP_ACTIVATION_WORKAROUND_%5Bdopeman%5D

that should work for you.



but seriously? still using XP?  you can get Vista ultimate off here and a couple of ""butchered"" versions as well. custom installs usually work quite well."
,Maxx0r,2007-09-26T17:59Z,Where do I paste the serial? Help please!
,Maxx0r,2007-09-26T18:13Z,"Okay.Mine is  --->C82E70954290472cA2EDEFE95B12CA1E

I can't place all of that there.What do I do.Please help..."
,Maxx0r,2007-09-26T18:37Z,If anybody got theirs to work.Is it possible that they please share their keys?.I just really want to play this.I have Halo one and two but i'm afraid I trusted the wrong people with this and it was ruined.Please help me with this.
,_j0n_,2007-09-27T03:44Z,the whole serial won't fit-  put as much of it in as it will allow.
,Maxx0r,2007-09-27T17:12Z,I did...but it's saying I have an invalid serial :(
,_j0n_,2007-09-28T06:56Z,"try using the MF.dll crack thats on here- I guess this won't work for you.

if you have the other crack and you use the lankey you might be able to get on Live but I'm not sure.

some things just don't work for everyone. sorry man."
,undermyoath431,2007-10-04T01:36Z,"Well, I looked at the  junk. It seems to be exactly 32 characters. Anyone seeing anything? Could it be an MD5? Try unhashing it."
,ozke,2007-10-08T17:38Z,"well mine is also 32 characters and it dosent work, and im using the MF crack but how to you know if the crack works?"
,_j0n_,2007-10-08T23:41Z,"I have both XP and Vista installed on my system- I tested this 'crack' on Vista proper, and used the MF.dll to open it on XP as it wouldn't install without me editing the .ISO file I had of it with the .dll hack.

answer your question?"
,ozke,2007-10-09T17:13Z,"no sorry i have no idea what you are talking about, cant you just tell us how you got it online? what code you used and stuff. Thx for the answer though"
,_j0n_,2007-10-10T07:01Z,"I really don't know how I got in online. Maybe Live was glitchy that day and let me in...

just use the mf.dll and when live asks you for your code enter the first 25 characters of your copy."
,ozke,2007-10-10T19:29Z,"Hmm, i have placed the crack (MF.dll) in my install path. And when i first installed the game it asked for a activation code but then i just pushed ""activate later"" and when i trying to join live in game and enter the code it dosent work. =( Btw it seems that all the ""lankey"" codes are the same..."
,_j0n_,2007-10-11T01:59Z,"okay then. I guess you can completely disregard the whole thing.

I assumed my experiences were repeatable> sorry for the confusion."
,ozke,2007-10-12T14:48Z,"Well it dosent matter now, besides i already have Halo 2 on the xbox and i can play that one online for free =) thanks anyway mate!"
,_j0n_,2007-10-13T06:10Z,"how do you play online for free?

is it that lan hack thing?"
,ozke,2007-10-13T11:27Z,"Yeah, you have your computer conected to your xbox and then run a program and u can play online via the system link. 

If you wanna know how i can tell you =)"
,_j0n_,2007-10-13T13:51Z,"i have the stuff on my computer somewhere, but I'm not so sure as how it will work with my 360."
,ozke,2007-10-13T19:47Z,"Well as far as i know it works on both Xbox and Xbox 360, and there is guides how to make it work on the net"
,_j0n_,2007-10-14T08:31Z,thanks for the info. I'll look it up later.
,ozke,2007-10-14T15:22Z,NP (no problem) mate!
,skater_9119,2007-11-02T04:58Z,"how do i do this if i have 3 iso files
.B00

,_j0n_,2007-11-07T01:32Z,You have to have it installed already before you can do anything of this sort.
,ankkasd,2007-11-10T11:00Z,wtf ?? what i have to use as serial or what?
,_j0n_,2007-11-15T00:12Z,"it says to use it as serial... but don't count on it working too well.

,ShadeSeven,2008-09-15T10:46Z,"if u were in the right file u would know
but  it doesnt work for me :("
,mal1t1a,2008-09-19T22:51Z,"Ok guys, if you can't find it, AFTER you installed Halo 2, go to the install directory (e.x: ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft games\Halo 2"")

Once you are there, there is a file called halo2.exe.cfg, open that up with notepad, it'll say: 
the code you copy is here

I haven't tried this yet because I can't find a working torrent of halo 2 vista, and I'm thinking I'm just going to buy it :P Hopefully that helps. BTW, let me know if it actually does work."
,mal1t1a,2008-09-19T22:54Z,"ahaha, the code won't show up but it says 

lankey  between the """" then it says lankey and a / between the """" then between both lankey's and the """"'s that is the code he is talking about

(""""lanky in between)
code is here 
(""""lankey and / in between"")"
,desquishybanana,2008-09-27T23:49Z,"ok i found what i think is it but when i enter it, the code i found was to long to fit"
