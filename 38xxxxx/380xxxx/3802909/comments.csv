,rokvondogg,2009-03-22T20:09Z,Thank you for sharing all the knowledge you have thus far occultmobolization. I was wondering if you knew where to find or if you had in your possesion and books by Rene Guenon available in english. Any help you can offer would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

,Catatonicat,2009-05-31T01:15Z,"Thank you for the upload of these works. I am especially curious on the Dragon Rouge book as I intend to join the order as well as the Haitian Vodou book as I am very fascinated by it. I'm currently reading Wade Davis' book ""The Serpent and The Rainbow"" which I find quite amazing.
Will there be a thread dedicated to newer publishing houses' works, like Ixaxaar and Rotter Drache?"
