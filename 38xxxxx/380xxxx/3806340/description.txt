Here comes another one!


This Animé tells te tale of our world "the real world" and a paralell world called Soul Society, where the Shinigami lives. The Shinigami are litterally "Death gods" (which are invisible to human eyes) that sometimes "runs around" in the real world helping poore souls, otherwise known as ghosts, to the "other side" (in this case Soul Society) By doing this the Shinigami are maintaining the balance between the dead, that are leaving the world (the souls that I mentioned erlier), and  the ones that are being born (the ones coming in). However, if a soul wanders for too long in the real world, the anguish that they bare, problably because some of them have some kind of unfinished buiseness or bare some kind of a gruge, sometimes turns them in to a scary looking creature called a "Hollow". Once a soul turnes in to a Hollow they can't be converted back and must therefore be killed. So one night the main character, Kurosaki Ichigo, finds himself in the middle of a fight between a young female Shinigami called Kuchiki Rukia and a fat-ass Hollow which are trying to "eat" one or all of Ichigos famiy members (I can't remember all the details) because they have an unusually high Reatsu (Spirit energy), and accidentally absorbs Rukias Shinigami powers.

Thats the basics of the story but it gets A LOT better later down the road.
