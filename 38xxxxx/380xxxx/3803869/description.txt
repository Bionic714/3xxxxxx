The free software iPhone unlock ?the only one that counts? has been finally achieved and it has been independently tested. Everyone can now unlock their iPhones for free. The names of the rebel heroes from the iPhone Dev Team are (in alphabetical order): Daeken, Darkmen, guest184, gray, iZsh, pytey, roxfan, Sam, uns, Zappaz, Zf, plus Nightwatch for his iPhone toolchain. So no, the unlock was not achieved by GeoHot, who actually has no unlock
