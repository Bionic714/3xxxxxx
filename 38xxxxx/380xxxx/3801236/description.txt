This is actually one game. Its pontifex 2 and Pontifex 2 v1.3 upgrade also called Bridge Construction set. 

So to install Pontifex 2 v1.3 do this....

1 - Install 1_File Number 1.exe
2 - start   2_keygen.exe (or use the premade regfile, PFX2.rg and GOTO 4)
3 - Click Save or start the game and enter reg details manually : Quit game : GOTO 5
4 - COPY PFX2.RG to the installdir for Pontifex
5 - install   3_File number 3.exe IN THE SAME PLACE AS 1_File Number 1.exe !!!!!!!!!!


Extra stuff

If you want the extra map(pack)s and contest maps, copy the FILES folder to the MAIN BCS/Pontifex folder.
The Packer.exe is a tool for creating MAP Packs, put in main folder.
Manual.rar is just a HTML MANUAL. It teaches you all you need to construct bridges. 
Just Unpack manual.rar into main BCS folder, and click manual.html to be enlighted.

thats it....
 play the game and be creative!
