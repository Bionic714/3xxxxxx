,mjmjkfgfdg,2007-09-13T21:39Z,"it doesnt say ""nuked"" so there must be subs"
,shagster,2007-09-13T21:56Z,text language says english so why do u say russian subs i think u think this is the same as the others on tpb i dont think some1 would be so sad as to post the same stuff as whats already on here.
,macsponge,2007-09-14T00:08Z,thanks man samples looks great best one out there whole family love ya
,walkmaster,2007-09-14T00:41Z,"There are no sub-titles in this copy, you can look at the sample and see. Also the audio is a little weird but nothing too bad, I think it is a good copy."
,shagster,2007-09-14T04:39Z,yes there are subs and they are english all the way throught the movie picture is great so is audio but if you dont like subs then dont download.
,dashmasha,2007-09-14T04:47Z,DUDE you can turn off the shitty subs. I did it in Windows Media Player Classic. And watched the whole thing with out those fukn subs.
,dandigla,2007-09-14T06:08Z,how do i change the mkv format to avi?
,latulipe,2007-09-14T07:09Z,"you don't change it to avi, for its only a container (and a better than avi).
just search for 'matroska'-splitter and you will be able to playback in all software-players.
of course you need a h264-codec,but which has nothing to do with matroska"
,dashmasha,2007-09-14T07:16Z,If your having trouble converting this file to avi or to dvd video files... then use this link and download this mkv codec.... I did and its converting fine. No spam no viruses..

,dashmasha,2007-09-14T09:32Z,I used WinAvi to convert it to DVD video files and burnt it to DVD and its playing fine. Could only convert it when i used the above codec. Cya
,mjmjkfgfdg,2007-09-14T09:40Z,best one so far
,datsura,2007-09-14T11:27Z,"subs out of sync.. not fun to read the dialog 2 sec before they are spoken..
"
,mjmjkfgfdg,2007-09-14T13:08Z,Did anyone else end up with horrible delayed sound after converting this with ConvertXToDVD?

,itchino1,2007-09-15T18:21Z,Yes I too have audio problems when using convertxtodvd so far it only plays well when playing on pc soon as I convert the sound goes crazy looks like the wait goes on picture quality good.
,some_j,2007-09-15T21:41Z,"itchino1-- i got the same problem,
i downloaded aac codec and all, it plays fine on pc,
but when converting to dvd the audio is f***ing nuked, can someone help me out here?
thx in advance"
,dashmasha,2007-09-15T21:52Z,"hey some_j,
Once I got the right codec, i converted it to dvd using Win Avi vid. converter and audio was synced fine, no problems"
,some_j,2007-09-15T22:03Z,"ok thx dashmasha 
i'll try winavi then"
,drksoul,2007-09-15T22:08Z,"Cropped away russian hardcoded subs and Re-encoded from probably line r5 copy, then added english subs wich is way out of sync..

And since it is cropped, bottom part of image missing and i also think some of the top of the image as well.."
,some_j,2007-09-15T22:23Z,"that doesn't work either, winavi crashes every time,
and only with this movie, 
strange,
anyone another idea?"
,Markalicious,2007-09-17T03:28Z,"wats a good program like WinAvi, except for mac?"

,oppaker,2007-09-20T02:40Z,"Great quality rip. Thanks a lot, guys! Yes, i will seed, till a ratio of 1,7/1 (Maybe more).
To those with problems: In GOMplayer it runs smoothly,
with crisp sound and picture quality, and just right-click, and choose
""Subtitles""/""Hide subtitles"", or un-tick the ""show subtitle""-box,
and those annoying, out-of-sync English subs magically disappears.
This is probably the very best copy out there, so enjoy it, and thanks again.

,THOR.DK,2007-09-25T15:31Z,"Best upload there is at the moment, and absolutely worth to download. its as god as dvdrip, dont forget to download Lazy Mans codec (google it) and then Use WinAvi 8 to convert it into DVD. "
,Zjohn,2007-09-25T19:58Z,"Honestly, ppl that post comments like ""bad sound"" etc is just su stupid it clearly says R5!!!!!! And on like 80 percent of all the R5's there is a little worse sound quality then then real deal, atleast the ones ive seen, Thx for a geat uppload :D ~"
,luke187420,2007-09-26T21:00Z,"I have vista, ripped to a dvd via win dvd maker no problem, and I've yet to ever encounter a file it can't convert, I think it's the best dvd converter out there, simple and makes a cool interface.

Quality of video is standard for a R5, but audio falls to about a 7/10.

The bottom is cropped to hide russian subs. The crop is very slight because the subs on the other Harry Potter R5 file were very small, so personally I'll take the one with the subs because they're not really bothersome or annoying at all."

,Falacer,2007-10-05T00:12Z,There anyway to remove the subs completely? Would be worth keeping until a better version comes out if I could remove the subs altogether.
,phil286,2007-10-05T08:14Z,"excellent video, sound isnt bad.
but the horrible hard-encode subs ruin the movie.
If youre gonna encode an [u]english[/u] movie with [u]english[/u] freaking subs, at least learn to speak the language.  If it isnt misspelled, its quite often the wrong damn words."

The subs really suck, they're misspelled, incorrect and doesn't even sync with the speach. It kinda ruins the movie since you have to concentrate not to read them all the time."

,DogNo7,2007-10-13T01:30Z,"I think this movie and story were just bad.

If you don't want spoilers, skip the rest of this message.

Ok, first, the title is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, but the Order of the Phoenix is never really developed very well, and Harry Potter NEVER becomes a member, carries the gauntlet for the order of the Phoenix, etc.  In short, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix never really get together, and this is true of the rest of the movie.  It just doesn't build up to anything.

The movie had all the elements and ingredients to be an entertaining romp, but instead, it was just incredibly poorly developed.  Sort of like the previous four stories thrown in a blender, set to puree, and then the resulting goop poured onto Movie screens and DVD players.

Everything felt awkward, including the acting, where I often felt like the actors were wondering, ""what the hell am I doing in this crappy movie script?""

As far as the quality of he Rip, eh, that really wasn't the most glaring deficiency.

Use your hard disk/dvd storage for something better.  This isn't worth downloading or watching."

,petterhot,2007-10-23T18:30Z,"Thanks for torrent!
The movie works fine, with good pic.q. But the sub is some unsync.

Keep up the seed everyone!"
,altgeeky1,2007-10-27T16:00Z,"Why do people go through the extra effort of HARDCODING subs? It is a huge disadvantage, ruins the bitrate/quality, and is just plain annoying. It's also very common (THOR group comes to mind)."
