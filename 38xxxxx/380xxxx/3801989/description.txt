A good lexicon with these abilities:
Greek <-> English
Greek <-> French
Greek <-> German
Greek <-> Italian
Greek Thesaurus

------------
I use this lexicon (older versions) since 1997.
My knownlenge in English sucks.
I owe what I know (from all these english books I read until now) to this program.
It sounds lame, but I ashame that I not yet pay for this program.
Its a good greek try, and I believe this is a program which every Greek person need.
Well, I promise, when I migrate to Kubuntu Linux, I will buy the Linux version of program.
