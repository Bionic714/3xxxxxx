The Back Trax Band

Seldom does a band survive for over 20 years as a local, fun loving, and increasingly talented musical enterprise.  But, BackTrax has and has done it with hard work, dedication & class.

From Classic Rock to Country, From Polkas to Blues, From the 50Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s and 60Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s to TodayÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Hits, BackTrax continues to entertain hosts of people at public establishments as well as private parties in a fun and memorable fashion.

Equipped with the latest technology and seasoned with years of practice and experience, the members of BackTrax play primarily for one reason Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ they love to play and entertain. 

BackTrax is based out of Marshfield, WI in north central Wisconsin.

 Who Are These Guys?

BackTrax consists of a powerful rhythm section driven by the beat of Al Duerr on the drums and by the sub sounds of Wayne Jellish on the bass. Jellish has over the years provided the vision, leadership, and glue for the bandÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s longitivity.

Adding a complimentary keyboard sound and saxophone on top of this rhythmic bottom line is Donnie Keiffer, known for years as one of the premiere country sideman in the upper Midwest.

Rounding out the band with mind bending guitar work are Aaron Jellish and Don Kerper.  Jellish is considered by many as one of the top modern rock guitarists in WI.  As for Kerper, well the blues is his thing as well as that folk rock sound of the Eagles and CSNY.
