Version 2 has been rated better than the competition by the major independent reviews. And award-winning CounterSpy has a new secret weapon: the VIPREâ?¢ anti-malware technology protects you against today's increasingly complex malware threats. 

Groundbreaking Technology 
Now, the most menacing spyware, rootkits, and blended malware threats have no place to hide! With CounterSpy V2's revolutionary new design you get faster, more effective spyware scans and real-time protection that removes even the deepest rooted malware from your PC. 

There is a problem with some freeware you might run... 
Since no one wants to spend money they don't have to, you might be running free Anti-spyware like Ad-Aware and/or SpyBot. That's where the problem comes in! Unfortunately, by now these products simply don't cut it anymore. Recent reviews show that over time they have fallen behind significantly. They just don't catch the really bad stuff any more. To illustrate the point, SpyBot recently only got 3 Stars atand Ad-Aware just got 2 from PC Magazine. In this case it is true that with freeware "you get what you pay for". You absolutely need better, weapons-grade Anti-spyware against soaring Internet crime.
