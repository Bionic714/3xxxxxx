,RNTgames,2007-11-18T14:42Z,Only use XPize if you dont want to play games because it stops you from playing games even if you uninstall it

,umarnawazkhan,2008-04-12T01:35Z,"So I assumed you should know any builds of SP3 RC* are a time limited beta software that will expired on June 30, 2008. When SP3 final is released in the first half of 2008, you need to uninstall the beta software before installation of SP3 final, whichever comes first.
