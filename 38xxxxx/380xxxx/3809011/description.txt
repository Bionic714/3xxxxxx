A collection of 34 books dealing with suppressors. This includes their design, manufacturing techniques, and much more. The guides for suppressors range in size from .22 rimfire to .50 BMG. In addition there is an extra 104 patents dealing with them. Some of these patents even contain rocket launcher suppressors, and a ton more of other cool things, but it would take up way too much room to list them all. Certainly a valuable set of books!
