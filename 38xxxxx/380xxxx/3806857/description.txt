Burger Cop aka Don't Give A Damn (Sammo Hung, 1994) - VCD/Rmvb


Plot:	Sammo Hung pulls overtime as director, producer, action director, and star in this police actioner. Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, and Takeshi Kaneshiro are the mismatched trio, all out to capture a ruthless drug lord. Zaniness ensues...

Overview:	Sammo Hung Kam-Bo plays a cop on the trail of drug dealers. Customs officer Yuen Biao is investigating the same gang. Sammo's new partner is eager-beaver Takeshi Kaneshiro. Despite each having their own ideas on how best to proceed, they are teamed together and must put aside their differences in order to crack the case. Romance, plot twists, comedic asides, and, of course, plenty of fights bring the film to a climactic and bruising conclusion.
