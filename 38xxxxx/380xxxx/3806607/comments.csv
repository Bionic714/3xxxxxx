,_Vecyraz_,2007-10-17T22:04Z,so how does this work?
,_Vecyraz_,2007-10-20T12:57Z,I tested this and its great! its like the original dragonball budokai 3 only new skins on the  characters and news background music that goes great with the story mode. Great Job whoever modded this. it has a small graphic problem but you wont even notice it much.

,dumpcoco,2009-06-01T11:03Z,"Hug ... here I was looking for the original version because of my broken Dvd and I found ... this ...

Well here the point guys, it's a mod so if you like mods you'll be grateful, they change models, maps, musics ( and not ""add"" as everyone could think ).

Since it says ""New characters"" it's actually ""New Costumes"" that show different models.

Something that could make you laugh is when Goku says "" You're freeza ? Funny ! "" and it's written "" You're Super Sayan 4, Nappa ? Funny ! "" brrrr !

So most of the ""new costumes"" replace the originals and you could see Goku in his magnificient blue and green tunic ( Hug .. ), Krilin with red hair, Nappa with red tunic, and as the main screen could let us guess, it seems that we could play with Goku SSJ5 ...

So far ! Because if you had already finished the original budokai 3 you will have to finished the ""budokai 3 AF mod"" again ! Scary !

The story mode is messy from everywhere ! It could make sense if you don't play with voices and yet from time to time it's not perfect

 so here you go to the story mode and begin with goku who must fight the terrible Radi... Huuuuh !!! I mean Metal Cooler or something like that who cares about his sayan pride ( Raditz's talking of course )

Another thing that makes me laugh was Baby fighting instead of Ginyu or someone else I don't really remember, Baby's model is actually Majin Buu in Blue .. that's all :s

Then the musics ... OUCH ! You have Nightwish musics on the world map ( huh ? ) then some rap songs when you're fighting ( Huh ? )
you must be thinking "" If things continue like this I couldn't keep going for finishing this mod O_O ""

The menu isn't bad nothing to say on this one as the original one was quite messy too.

In conclusion you can lose

-original save file
-original costumes
-original story ( I can't put myself in the new one really )
-original musics ( even if they can't beat the Anime musics it's still better than rap )

It reminds me the time when I modify some skins on the ""Donkey Kong"" game on Snes it was all messy :s"
