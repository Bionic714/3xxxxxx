PLOT:

Legend has it that the world of ours is really three worlds: the 

world of humans, the world of man-beasts (the jyujinkai) and the 

nightmare world of the monster demons (the makai) who take on earthly 

forms to pour their mighty energies into the bodies of human girls. 

Every three thousand years comes the superfiend Chojin, whose destiny 

it is to unite these three worlds into the land of eternity. As 

Amano, from the world of the man-beasts, battles with the forces of 

the monster world in his quest for knowledge, he realises what the 

chojins land of eternity will be....a sickening place of horrendous 

violence, uncontrollable lusts and supernatural forces beyond the 

imagination.
