I tried to join that shit for weeks or find someone to invite me, it´s bullshit!!!! 

I recommend to visit graphicboards.org and boygj.com   here you´ll find all the latest stuff : )))

Now I´ve got so many templates and scripts that I dont know what to do with it... exept from creating a nice torrent and present it here on the piratebay ; )  best site ever!!

So keep your eyes open guys.... ehe!"
