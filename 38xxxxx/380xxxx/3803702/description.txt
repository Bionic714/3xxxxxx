As Nick Kang, your brutal reputation and lethal skills have landed you a nasty job: heading up an undercover task force to stop the Chinese and Russian gangs from turning the City of Angels into their hellish playground.

Drive, fight and blast your way through a massive array of unpredictable missions, using stealth techniques, martial arts moves and an ask-questions-later arsenal.

For maximum replayability, a changeable, branching storyline gives you the freedom to complete missions as you choose-however, you also have to face the consequences of those choices for better or worse. Successes or failures lead to entirely different game experiences, unveiling multiple storylines with no repeated missions. 

Ps. it works 100%
