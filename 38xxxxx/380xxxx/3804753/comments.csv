,revered0ne,2007-09-14T01:29Z,I have nothing to do with this upload...I do however see ALOT of people having the license expire issue...that's because all the releases up til this point have been beta versions....and were set to expire on 9-1-07..... If you've had a different version of CS3 installed you will to REFORMAT you HDD to wipe out the activation code...entering a new Serial won't do it....deleting the cache won't do it....OR depending on the stuff you want ...there's a PRODUCTION PREMIUM torrent floating around...it has everything but the web stuff!!!
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-14T04:16Z,"I installed the Suite on 9 Sep and had no issues; however I had no previous versions of CS3 on my system, just CS2. If you have other versions of CS3 installed this installation may not work without a complete reformat or thorough registry scrub. That will likely be the case for any CS3 Apps. As a frequent user of P2P I?m always prepared for a complete reformat (never know when something destructive might sneak through) but many aren?t so I guess it just depends on how badly you want the Suite."
,rainkingcc,2007-09-14T05:55Z,If possible can we get a working confirmation? Going at 500kbps rock on and thanks.
,Uber_nova,2007-09-14T10:52Z,hey does this have on location and the other extra stuff that's on the other disks? or just the install files? oh finsterc and whats the best registry scrub program or one that you recomend.  
,rainkingcc,2007-09-14T16:32Z,Seed you greedy bastards!
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-14T18:24Z,"To be honest I don't know of a registry scrub app that will assist in finding all software registration keys. You can try ""Your Uninstaller 2006"" to uninstall any previous CS3 apps. That might eliminate any hidden Registry Keys. It works great for programs that use the Microsoft or InstallShield installers. I don't know how it works on and advanced installer like Adobe's.  You also might consider getting an advanced Registry Manager like ""Registrar Registry Manager"" which maps and logs any changes made to your system registry. That way you can go back and remove keys installed by installations. It is also an advance Registry Editor you can use to search through the database and remove any thing that you need to, but I wouldn't recommend that if you are unfamiliar with the System Registry Database. To answer some other questions, I'm not sure which # DVD the .iso file is from in the original package includes but it includes full installations of all apps listed above except those marked with *.
I've installed and tested them all and I assume they all work as they are supposed to but honestly other then Photoshop, Flash, Dreamweaver, Premier Pro, and Soundbooth (which all work great) I'm not familiar with the rest of the Suite yet. I can tell you that all the apps installed without a problem and open up. I received the original data from an associate already burned to DVD that has been passed around for a while now. Not sure where the original came from but it contains an X-FORCE Keygen. I don't know of anyone who had problems with the installation other then having to generate a few serials until one worked, but I also don't know if anyone had other CS3 apps installed. I know I had multiple
CS2 apps installed which were successfully upgraded. I also just did a full wipe and reload of my system a few weeks ago because I had the same type of problem with an install of AutoCad 2008. Nothing else worked but a $6500 dollar app is worth it. This $2500 Suite might be too. A confirmation from anyone who has a successful install would be great just to rule out any hash problems with the torrent. And rainkingcc is right SEED. "
,nctvking,2007-09-14T21:16Z,I burned this to a dvd and it worked fine. But when I try to use the uninstaller to remove an preview of premiere cs3 nothing happens. Can you only load this 1 time ?
,Nisse Owned,2007-09-14T22:39Z,"Jeez, seed guys, according to comments people have downloaded this successfully, yet only one seed, WTF?
I'll seed it as soon as i get it, but with one seed it isn't easy"
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-14T23:02Z,177 downloads and I'm seeding 471 peers on my own. WTF?
,Uber_nova,2007-09-15T02:32Z,hey if i download will it automatically seed or do i have to do something special to seed it after downloading?
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-15T03:09Z,"Depends on which P2P app you use. Most automatically seed after download but may stop if you access the file. Be sure to keep the original Zip file in the download location so it can properly seed. If the torrent disapeared from your P2P app, just reload it and it should seed if the downloaded file is in the correct location."
,Uber_nova,2007-09-15T05:03Z,cool i'll seed as soon as its done thanks for the help man

,Frukostflingan,2007-09-16T14:28Z,"Great torrent, but it comes in a DAA file, how do I open it ? "
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-16T15:48Z,"Actually it's an .iso file but if you have PowerISO installed it might recognize it as a .daa. Either way you can burn the image to a DVD (most CD/DVD burning apps work) or what I do is mount it to a virtual drive using DAEMON Tools.
http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon
These will both allow an install."
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-16T15:54Z,"Thank God, Finally some seeders, now I can recover some bandwith. Comments installations, good or bad, would be great."
,Jannez,2007-09-16T16:11Z,"When trying to unzip Winrar says:

[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-16T18:27Z,1st check the torrent properties in your P2P app and ensure it was a clean download (not a large number of hashfails). 2nd try unpacking with another app like WinZip.

Anyone have any thoughts?"
,Lightning_Rider,2007-09-25T22:20Z,You can use the auto updater. I used it and it still works great. But I noticed that you have to update several times to actually get some of the updates installed properly. And the Encore update doesn't seem to want to install at all. I dunno why but it doesn't really matter. Just run it a few times and everything else should install properly... except the Encore. Maybe it's a bug and they have to fix it with another update...

,ailsa1208,2007-10-12T16:27Z,"To ElvedinElvis, the first time I installed this collection it's completely normal, then I decided to uninstall the previously installed adobe software and reinstall them from this one (so I can use just one product key), then I got the same error message as yours, ""Please insert CS3 Master Collection disk 1 in (C:) Drive""

Then I took someone's advice and downloaded ""Your uninstaller! 2006"" and it solved all the problems! I think the reason why the message shows must be related to the uncleared registry, I tried ""ccleaner"" but it doesn't work like ""your uninstaller 2006"" does. Use ""your uninstaller"" to scan for temp files or uncleared registry, then delete any files with the word ""adobe"" in it (only if you don't have any other adobe software in your computer) by hand, or you might hurt other software- especially those use keygen or cracked files.

[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-10-28T08:03Z,"Sorry, haven?t been keeping up with this thread like I should be. Recent posts have confirmed that the app is still working and the info hash is not corrupt. The majority of install problems I?m seeing seem to do with system issues, or user knowledge. Some quick tips. 
-	There is no virus. Many AV apps view Keygens as malware but it is not.
-	You cannot extract an ISO file. It needs to be mounted to a virtual drive or burned to DVD. 
-	If you attempt to reinstall you must ensure all registry entries are deleted first. (DL Your Uninstaller 2006)
-	The updater may work now but it won?t be long until Adobe fixes that. I wouldn?t suggest continuing to use it.
-	If you are getting a corrupt file error check your P2P client log to ensure there were not a large number of hash fails. This occurs if you have a slow internet connection or are trying to download more than your system can efficiently handle.
-	Most importantly, ensure you disable your network connection during the install. The app will attempt to communicate with home base on install and is likely the reason for any ?License expired? errors.

Dude, calm down.
Have you tried uninstalling by using the program ""Your Uninstaller 2006"" To remove your registry files? if you did, maybe that version of ""Your Uninstaller"" doesn't delete everything from registry. As for getting the Expiration error, it doesn't seem to happen to me, although  I haven't gone online with that computer yet out of fear that it might do it (despite im done installing)."
,joopslim,2007-10-29T21:14Z,"Jay 8,

The *ss-kicking was just for fun.
But I've been busy for four day's now, whit no progress what so ever.
I've cleaned everything whit the uninstaller 2006, regcleaner, cs3clean, and manually removing everything that has got something to do whit adobe.
Still it won't work.
The installer finished 5 min. ago, and it gives me the same errors like before.
So only half of programs, and the licening errors.
In short: It doesn't matter what I try, it just won't install correctly.
ps did I mentioned that the computer was off the network?
I'm going back to the stand alone versions, because I dont have the time and will to try it another time.
Hope there will be soon a fix for this, because I still think that this is one hell of a package."
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-10-30T04:43Z,"joopslim, seems you have both system issues preventing install and anger management issues, sorry I can't help with either of those.
Jay8, you can reconnect after install, just shut deactivate the auto updater. I have have known people to set their firewall to block apps they don't want phoning home.

HERE IS HOW I GOT IT TO WORK.

The installer wasnt working right.  It would install, but at the end it would have an ""X"" over every program I wanted to install so basically it wasnt working.  So here is what I did.

1. Burn the ISO to a real DVD (not mounted with poweriso, daemon tools, etc)
2. Run the CS3 Clean script from adobe http://download.macromedia.com/pub/creativesuite/script/3/wincs3clean.zip
3. Unplug your ethernet while installing
4. Use the keygen to create a SN

Fresh clean install of Vista no Adobe at all on machine
Using latest version of Bittorent

I Downloaded torrent  It downloaded as 1 folder called AdobeCS3master and  one zip file also called AdobeCs3 master (outside of the folder.)
Inside the folder contained a .daa file ( I left the file inside the folder alone) outside the folder was a zip file.
I used winzip to unzip the the Adobemaster.zip (the file outside the folder) to a temp directory
There inside that temp directory it showed torrent as .rar file I then installed Power Iso  (just search piratebay for PowerIso)
and that .rar file turned into a Power Iso gold Icon I opened up Power iso
I Put in a DVD-r and had power iso burn the image to dvd this toook a while
Then after  the Dvd was created I installed the DVD into my drive the installer popped up automatically I selected to install all programs and it asked me for serial number I gave it a serial made from keygen included in torrent and it installed  Perfectly
All Programs working no errors at all
this is a great Torrrent!! not a thing wrong with it
thank you

I hope this helps anyone who needs help installing this torrent"
,--EtraX--,2008-03-18T22:21Z,could somebody give me a serial to Adobe Illustrator CS3?
,Fluidfox,2008-03-21T09:18Z,"If this performs as advertised, and it looks like from the comments it will if you don't banjax it up... I'm afraid, FiNsTeRc, I'm going to have to build a small shrine to your honor. "
,Fluidfox,2008-03-22T02:36Z,"To settle all doubt, I'm about to install it. I've run 3 hash checks with UTorrent, Bitcomet, and the default BT client.  I'll go ahead and scan it with Kasperski and Nod though I'm sure by now we'd have heard more squealing if it was dirty. I'm doing this on a almost clean factory install of Vista home Premium on my two day old laptop. No prior Adobe installs other than the free reader that came with the laptop. So, we should be able to use this as a control in our little experiment here.  I'll get back to you. "
,Fluidfox,2008-03-22T06:12Z,"Well, It looks like I need to go out and get some incense. I was thinking Sandalwood.. (for the above mentioned shrine) 

It all went off without a hitch. Here's what I did:

0) As mentioned above, I manually ran the hash check after download. It's just a good idea with anything you've spent more than an hour downloading.... (used to running a VERY crappy old desktop, so if all this seems paranoid, hey, it worked didn't it?)

1) Unpack the .rar archive. I used the winrar corporate from this site. 

2) I burned it with Nero 8 Ultra, also from this site, and just to be safe set the burn speed to 4X   and requested it to verify the burn afterwards.

3) Restarted and shut down all my non critical programs, including anti-virus and anything trying to be ""helpful"" in the background. I tried Safe mode, but that also shuts down windows installer for some asinine reason, so normal mode with minimum programs.

4) Popped the burned DVD in and it auto-loaded the installer. I got everything how I wanted it (and installed about 6 gigs of stuff that I didn't need or want so I could test it out for you guys) But you can select which ones you want to install.

5) unplugged my LAN and flipped off my wireless switch after starting the installer, but before would probably have been better. I just remembered after the fact.

6) went out and got something to eat, came back and checked on it...  it was like 30%

7) talked to my girlfriend and took a shower. 60%

8) stared blankly at the screen and zoned out for about 20 more minutes (What? I'd run out of things to do!)  and...  POOF!  done.  

Total install time: 1 hour, 47 minutes. 

Everything worked.  No exceptions that I've found.  Though I'll admit that in the interest of going to sleep sometime tonight, I only opened up and went through the initial startup for all of the programs. (I did this still with the internet off, by the way)

Now, I'm running the uninstaller (just run setup again, Add/Remove programs doesn't do it) to take off all the ones I'm not going to use. 


I hope this has been helpful. I'll hop back on and post if anything explodes, but from what I can tell, this torrent is perfect.  It doesn't have all the  additional stuff that you'll get in those 9 gig packs, but it works 100% from what I can tell if you do it right.  I'm only keeping acrobat, Photoshop, and like.. 2 or 3 of the others I'll use, but if anything goes wrong with those, you'll be the second to know."

If anyone get a message sort of like ""Critical errors found"" at install, that's because you've already installed a CS3 component(Dreamweaver, Flash Pro) that is conflicting with the ones you're trying to install, so what you need to do is to uninstall them.

If that does not work(worked for me), google for it(the error msg), and you'll find a script provided by adobe to set things right."

,bobbytomorow,2008-09-24T04:14Z,keygen is not a trojan noob your a/v is picking it up as a false positive

,Matt_Crax,2008-12-31T17:18Z,Its a trojan becouse its a virus to crack open the program. thats all
,Morgan235,2009-02-04T15:26Z,"I cannot get any of the programs to work!!!  Please help!! The installer appears to install evrything.  All the programs appear in my start menu, but when clicked, nothing.  However they do appear as active processes in the task manager.

I made sure there were no adobe apps already installed, I used the serial that was shared by lazy inc, because I couldn't get the keygen to work.  I am running a factory new vista system with 4g ram and amg quad processor."
,modziw,2009-02-19T03:18Z,"FYI, trojans, by definition, are a type of virus that opens a backdoor to your system.

keygens are often classified as viruses because they tamper with the program, but that does not make them trojans

SO, can someone please comment whether the keygen is in fact a trojan or a virus or neither??"
,modziw,2009-02-19T03:18Z,"btw, thanks for posting the serial justpoo, that is the way to do it!!

=)"
,Sharryanne,2009-09-13T11:21Z,Many thanks
,lancedass,2009-11-06T22:35Z,"for the record, there's also a trojan in the encore .cab file. it may be a false positive like the keygen, but that seems like an odd place for one.

and for anyone bitching at ""noobs"" about the false positives, switch to decaf. knowing it's a false positive doesn't help when your AV flips out and refuses to even let it run. 

the x-force keygen doesn't set off most AVs if anyone else has that issue."
,ragtop69,2009-11-14T01:44Z,Hope it works. Thanks guys.
