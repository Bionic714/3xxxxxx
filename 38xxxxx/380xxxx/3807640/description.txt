To maintain the "buzz" before the real proper edition, I've decided to construct the C11 as it probably would have looked like had it been compiled by the end of July. 
As these eleven show, there were actually quite a lot a great albums released this summer, here represented by an almost 50/50 blend of singery-songwritery acoustic-laden pop and sneeringly majestic indie rock. Enjoy!
