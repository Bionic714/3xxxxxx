This is a torrent wich aught to be in the top 100, thanks again for this great upload your the best."

,tefflonman,2007-09-27T12:37Z,"this is the best copy out there but the sound isn't spot on in a couple of places but well worth the dl thanks boggit
sound 8/10
picture 9/10"
,monicarnsg,2007-09-27T17:44Z,"The sound quality is great.  But I still can't see anything, an advice?  First time user."
,monicarnsg,2007-09-27T23:36Z,Never mind. Got it!  Looks great.  Thanks!!
,rogard,2007-09-28T16:59Z,"Thx for thr upload, although I am not too happy with it.

Sound seems amplified too much, it distorts.
Video is clearly re-reencoded. Many blocky artefacts around the edges. It's okay if you activate postprocessing though.

I'd say, measured on a DVDRip standard, I'd give it this:

Sound: 6/10
Video: 5/10

But it's well watchable, so thx again."
,Tweetiengram,2007-09-28T18:29Z,I am new to all this.  I download.  I see I have 53part Winzip or Winrar files and an sfv file.  What do I do now?
,Zinsei,2007-10-02T15:35Z,Seed please!
,holymoses3,2007-10-06T02:30Z,"I have just watched this film i won't give it 10 out 10 , i give it 15 out of 10.  Brilliant copy. Thanks  Boggit."
,Hollywoodj,2007-10-12T05:58Z,"Can someone on this site tell me why, when I download certain torrent files I get hit by mediasentry like crazy, but with others, I don't at all... is there anything out there besides PeerGuardian that can protect me from this evil organization? I know in the past I didn't even USE PeerGuardian, simply because I was stupid enough not to research the possible consequences of downloading torrents. Now that I know, im getting paranoid, any information would be greatly appriciated, and im sure will help others because ive been telling everyone I know everything I know to prevent getting busted.

Thanks ppl, hope someone sees this that can answer my questions..."
,Hollywoodj,2007-10-12T06:01Z,"BTW, this IS one if the files that made me get over 100 hits from mediasentry, obviously not Boggits fault, but just for anyone that would like to know.  The minute I paused it, the name stopped showing up in my block list."
,Neverknowaleash,2007-10-20T19:46Z,plant them seeds please =]
