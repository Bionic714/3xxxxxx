,pegbundy,2010-05-09T19:04Z,Ok so it is in a Rmvb file and not AVI or divix or xvid. If memory serves me corredctly this is a Real Player format. I used ConvertX to DVD4 and it did an OK job. Remember the Rmvb has less frames per second. Any way when I played it there was no sound! I converted it a second time changing the audio settings and there was no sound again. The Original Rmvb file has sound when playing in my PC real player but not the converted DVD. This is a great movie. I still have a copy but my copy is too scratched up to play or even fix. I need to replace it. Can any one offer some advise...........And before I seem ungrateful I want to thank you James for sharing so many wonderful Martial Arts movies.
,pegbundy,2010-05-09T20:29Z,"OK, now I tried converting it with ""Super"" by eright. It did an OK job but it pixelates and has green lines all over it. At least the sound came through this time. So far only watching this on my PC using Real PLayer seems to be the only solution."
