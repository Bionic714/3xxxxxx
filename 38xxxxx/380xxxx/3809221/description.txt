(sorry i made a mistake in my last upload, here the same thing w/o german umlaut filenames.)

German TV documentary (broadcasted on BR-Alpha) about new trends in mass media. Two 'TV-Guys' (that's how they call themselves) make a film about how blogs, youtube and co fuck normal television and other forms of one-to-many communication.

Part one "Glotzendaemmerung": What could the future of television look like? Includes interviews w/ Lawrence Lessig and other icons of the open source/free culture movement. 

Part two "Digitale Revolution": Political aspects of the change that comes with the internet-aware generation. Includes some footage of the last "wizards of oz" conference. Includes extensive Interview w/ Martin Gretschmann from Console. Includes the creators of the documentary fighting each other playing some Wii boxing game :)

Part three "Gesellschaft 2.0": More politics! Includes footage of German PIRATE PARTY deploying a Trojan horse in the ministry of interior affairs.


This is not my first rip, but the first torrent I put on the net, so please be gentle  =P

Enjoy.
