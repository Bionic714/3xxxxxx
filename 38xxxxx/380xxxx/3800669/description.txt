If there was ever a film that went out of its way to be even sicker, gorier, and more offensive that Blood Feast, it's this twisted puppy, the last film to date from HERSCHELL GORDON LEWIS, and easily one of the most appalling, ultra-violent horror movie gross-outs of all time. 

A lunatic with a grudge against g-strings, pasties, and pretty women is slaughtering the sexy strippers who work for strip club impresario Marzdone Mobilie (HENNY YOUNGMAN -- yes, the Henny Youngman). Not content with mere murder, the psycho enthusiastically mangles and mutilates the women, thus turning Marzdone's go go girls into The Gore Gore Girls. 

Trying to solve the gruesome goings-on are obnoxious private eye Abraham Gentry (rank Kress) and a ditzy reporter Nancy Weston (Amy Farrell). Burrowing through the underbelly of the sleaze-and-tease business, Abraham eventually offers the killer the perfect bait by coercing a drunken Nancy to perform in an amateur strip contest... 

Of course, the threadbare plot is just an excuse for a parade of extremely over the top gore scenes which, despite the obviously sloppy special effects, are still dazzling in their creative savagery. The carnage include a face being steam ironed; a bare buttock bashed bloody with a meat tenderizer ( to which salt is then literally added to the wound); a pair of eyeballs squeezed and popped; scissors snipping off a woman's nipples which squirt white milk and chocolate milk into champagne glasses; and even a head being boiled to death in a bowl of french fries! 

Yes, It's a comedy. 

Also known as Blood Orgy (for those audiences who found the original title too, uh ... sophisticated), The Gore Gore Girls (like I Drink Your Blood) was among the first films ever rated X for Violence by the indi-hating MPAA at a time when the ratings board was actually far more liberal than it is today). Lewis appealed the ruling, lost, but nevertheless released the film uncut.
