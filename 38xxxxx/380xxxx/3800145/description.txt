I couldn't find a decent copy of this, so I've made one. To Taylor: It's Divx, not Xvid. I haven't watched it, but it looks good, even better, storywise than 1.
There is one huge fault with this movie: No nude Natasha Henstridge. At least, I didn't detect decent naked scenes of the venerable Tasha when I skimmed through it looking for that All Mighty Redeamer of all mediocre-to-poor films: beautiful naked or semi-nude "actresses" running around or at least naked chick pretending to act. At any rate, The Nude Natasha Factor in this movie is nill compared to the first movie, but I think it's still worth watching.
