For you photo people out there, here is PhotoZoom Pro, to help you make those huge pictures? BIGGER! Well this claims to be able to do it the best with its ?pantented, self-adjusting, many times awarded S-Spline interpolation technology?? Sounds good doesn?t it, so why not give it a go!

PhotoZoom Pro? 2 is based on S-Spline XL: a renewed and improved version of our patented, self-adjusting, many times awarded S-Spline interpolation technology. As we did with S-Spline, our S-Spline XL technology again introduces a revolutionary breakthrough in digital image enlargement. It is able to render sharp and crisp clear image magnifications, perfectly focused, yet without the jagged edges, loss of detail or lack of photorealism that normally come with enlarging images.

Program Features:

    * New S-Spline XL interpolation algorithm!
    * Improved, powerful yet very easy to use interface
    * Advanced fine-tuning tools for even better enlargement results
    * Batch conversion
    * Extensive support for high-end image formats (such as 48 & 64 bit images)
    * Works as standalone application as well as Adobe Photoshop compatible plugin
