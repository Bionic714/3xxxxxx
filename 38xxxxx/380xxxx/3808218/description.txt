A homebrew music title from one of the leaders in the hobbyist development teams -- this DDR-type game for the Dreamcast (designed on the KallistOS development kit and pressed on boot-ready discs for all Dreamcast systems) features DDR mat compatibilty as well as DC control pad play, 2D and 3D graphic design, music based on the OrgVorbis codec, 49 unlockable extra features such as bonus games and vocal outtakes, and 22 songs from Cryptic Allusion's DJ Geki (aka Roddy Toomim), FinalPlanet's Chojin, Kudos, and Aaron Marks. The game also features a unique challenge mode called "Typing of Fury" which uses the Dreamcast keyboard as a typing challenge, with letters instead of arrow/dance pad moves moving to the beat.
