Lonely, Elvis-obsessed man (Christian Slater) gets a whore for birthday from his boss. He makes one of the better decisions one can make and marries the whore and has a run-in with her pimp when he goes to retrieve her belongings. He gets the wrong bag from her pimp\\\'s house and from there...watch it or I will give away the whole plot! Tarantino\\\'s best movie in Doodad\\\'s humble opinion.
