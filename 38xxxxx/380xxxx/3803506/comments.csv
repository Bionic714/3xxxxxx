,beenbee,2007-09-13T09:02Z,I don't know whether you've spotted but I'm seeding all the time unfortunately at 17kB/s max. Patience is a virtue and hey you got it for free.
,Hory1989,2007-09-17T00:49Z,"Awesome work, beenbee! Lookin forward to finish the download (and you finish the seeding)."
,WilliamN,2007-09-24T13:17Z,"Great torrent - BUT the CD 2004 No Silence - CD2 - seem to be corrupt. No software available to me (have tried UltraISO, Toast and many many more) is able to read it. Please reseed that CD separately in another format than the fairly uncommon bin/ccd/sub!"
,beenbee,2007-09-25T15:10Z,Try mounting it using Daemon Tools or burn using Clone CD. It works fine for me but yep I could've done this better. Sorry :P

,beenbee,2008-05-27T21:44Z,Use Winamp... so you could convert lossless files into any lossy format you prefer? bez czerstwych pytan prosze
,w0G,2008-06-14T00:54Z,"Is this worth downloading, judging on the negative comments"
,matrixx740,2008-06-19T21:00Z,OMG... Wha all files have tags of last file in album?
,gromsurfer,2008-06-21T05:12Z,files won't play in itunes thus no music on ipod. Don't dl!!
,codeis,2008-07-17T10:48Z,"Never heard this artist. Went to myspace and listened his songs. Just awsome.

,Trancer3,2008-08-14T10:02Z,I love the song Don't Stop in Movin' Melodies. Used to listen to it a lot back in the days.
,Hej001,2008-11-20T23:51Z,Thanks :)
,redeyeJedi,2008-12-02T09:30Z,"Ok first of all to all those who say this is a bad torrent.

You must like mp3's with up to 70% Music loss...


NTY Flac = LOSSLESS RIP

Means you are missing nothing, Every beat, drum, string, EVERYTHING is there. 

Wonderful Torrent Will seed for a long time.

Ty Beenbee"
,balazs92117,2008-12-05T20:08Z,Thx!
[T],PARiSHiLTONCLUb,2008-12-27T21:21Z,"haha lol, you guys have the same ""problem"" like me.
i tryed to burn, played: EMPTY
foobar2000: EMPTY

this is fake. And if it worked for YOU, what the f*ck did you do?"
,progressor,2009-02-05T23:48Z,"FLAC =Free Lossless Audio Codec
it's cd audio in a zipped filesize, and can be unzipped/converted back to .wav or mp3, m4a etc.
unlike mp3 which compresses the music by cutting the freq to reduce size, even 320kbps mp3 mostly doesn't match the freq of the cd source

thnx beenbee for this awesome release in best quality possible :D
I hope people upload music more in flac, it's the same as having the actual cd, especially when ripped with EAC (BTW FLAC plays in winamp too)
Cheers m8s :)"
[V],LosslessDude,2009-02-07T19:24Z,"USE THIS TO CONVERT THE FLAC FILES GUYS! : )

SET THE ENCODER FOR MP3 CBR 320 STEREO FOR BEST QUALITY

,djmopa,2009-03-14T04:42Z,"FLAC, which stands for ""Free Lossless Audio Codec"" FLAC are typically reduced in size 40 to 50 percent, so the quality of the audio is closer to an ACTUAL CD... People, quit bitching about FLAC... you would be happier, if you knew the technology behind it... 128K, 160k, 192k, 320k... has nothing on FLAC... a FLAC can be damn near 900-1000k... so imagine the quality of a 320, but only 3 times better?

If you use NERO... there is a FLAC coded dll file you can install into your plugin directory folder so you can BURN FLAC audio to CDR...

FLAC FUCKING ROCKS!!!! "
[T],greek200,2009-03-16T21:29Z,Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks 
,Tech-Noir,2009-03-29T15:05Z,"djmopa: I feel I need to slightly correct your comment. FLAC isn't only close to ""CD"" audio, it is an exact replica of the original songs, bit for bit. The difference from MP3 and other lossy formats is that FLAC doesn't remove data to get filesize down, but instead it simply uses compression similar to WinRAR or similar programs to use less data to describe the original file. When playing a FLAC file, the computer or device that is playing the file back is ""unpacking"" the original audio as the file plays, and although the file itself might have a ""bitrate"" of say 900kbit/sec, the actual playback of the file, after the audio player has unpacked it, is at a full 1411kbit/sec, assuming it's 16/44.1 CD audio.

Just wanted to mention it. :)"
