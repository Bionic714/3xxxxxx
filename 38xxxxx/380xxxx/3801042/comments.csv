Uploading 50 gigs and not including ANY info doesn't seem like a chessmove i must agree.. But you got to appreciate the effort ^^

Some of the movies included:
Desperado
Die Hard 2 & 3
Garfield
Interview with a Vampire
Madagascar (hungarian dub)
Pinochio
Narnia
Novocain
Solaris
Taxi 2
Traffic
Transpotting
Triple X
Thunderdome
Underworld
Van Helsing
X-Men 1 & 2

All in all a pretty decent collection, and im guessing most have either hungarian dubbing and/or subtitles.

But your still a n00b. TRY AGAIN lol"
