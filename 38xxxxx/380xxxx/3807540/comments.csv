Hi, FLAC files are audio files similar to MP3 and WAV. You should be able to run them in whatever media player you normal use, such as Windows Media Player. If you can't, you can download a nifty media player called VLC, which runs almost any audio/video file.

As some bonus info, FLAC files use a lossless compression as opposed to MP3 which use lossy compression. Simply put, they tend to be larger file sizes but with higher quality - as the name might imply, no loss in quality whatsoever.
