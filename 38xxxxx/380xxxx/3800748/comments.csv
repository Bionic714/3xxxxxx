Need torrent ID 3789972

PLease PLease PLease"
,bubach,2007-09-11T02:10Z,"I'm am so very sorry, I had no choice but to remove the old torrent. Some of the episodes was damaged when I created the torrent, and after fixing the files I couldn't seed past 99.5%.

So this is a new torrent. If you got 99.5% from the old torrent it means that you can't be missing more then maybe 1 episode? If so, download only that missing episode from this torrent."
,core500,2007-09-11T03:22Z,"ARGh i'm only 20 meg short.... lol its cool. Thanks for replying dude I'll just download what I need.

,bubach,2008-05-29T07:18Z,"I'm back seeding for a while now, but I think it's strange that you got stuck on 99.5% when ÂľTorrent reports 4 other seeders. :/"
,ladyrava,2008-08-20T05:19Z,"I'm stuck at 89.4%. Can anyone reseed?

Thanks!"
