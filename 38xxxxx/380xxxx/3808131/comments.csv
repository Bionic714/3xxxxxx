Seed or lose this and future CFL games!

I put a lot of time and effort into recording, editing, encoding and publishing these games and I make exactly $0 for doing so.

ALL I ASK IN RETURN IS FOR YOU TO SEED IT!

Bit Torrent technology as a whole was built with sharing as the main goal.  Don't f#@k it up with you greedy hit and run ways."
