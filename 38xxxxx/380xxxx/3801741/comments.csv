,GizZo,2007-09-12T11:19Z,"Problems with audio sync.
Am i the only one with problems for the audio sync on this one ? 

Any ideas ? "
,Dick Jerkins,2007-09-16T22:19Z,I'll keep this one going for a while. I haven't checked the audio yet. I don't know what causes that to happen. The Canopus ProCoder seems to fix that - but it takes a lot of time to process.
,Dick Jerkins,2007-09-25T02:21Z,This is the sorriest piece of shit I've ever downloaded.
,chemogrizzly,2007-10-02T23:32Z,"dick jerkinsor jerkoff ,whatever it is

,Neuster,2007-11-14T19:46Z,it's off 7 seconds. about 7 seconds.  just download Media Player Classic and do audio offset to 7 seconds.

,Mullin92,2008-05-27T14:27Z,swesub?
,Leo86,2008-07-18T11:15Z,How do I extract the movie to watch?.. Can't seem to open the files in winrar or anything. Hint here please.
,correctcd,2008-07-21T01:44Z,Do not download this shit.. Sounds is fucked up..like 10 sec after...
,Titey330,2008-08-20T05:59Z,waste of time not very good sound picture is good quality don't get this file if you ask me the audio is out of sink
,rcmooch,2008-09-11T22:12Z,Sound is off for me too. Really sucks since this the only English non iso format out here.
,nikeey_2k,2008-10-10T03:21Z,well its good movie but the sound is kinda slow witch def sucks for me as i cant fix it am not that pro but ty for the uplode :)
,tweekville,2008-12-13T02:02Z,The audio is about 12 seconds off...it also seems like it's a problem with the stream itself.  It open right and then after the WB logo it jumps ahead.
,supertreat,2009-11-23T01:37Z,"nice tip by Neuster, download media player classic, english version here http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli/files/Media%20Player%20Classic/MPC%206.4.9.0/mpc2kxp6490.zip/download , and go to play > audio > options >audio time shift, putting in 7000 and checking the box corrects the timing issue."
,rjcook,2011-11-07T04:49Z,"This is a pathetic excuse for a torrent upload.. even after fixing the audio via shifting the sync, it drops out completely after watching for some time. Fix your movies before you upload another and waste someones time."
,nytman,2011-12-14T12:56Z,how to download this movie from here....where should i click to start my download
