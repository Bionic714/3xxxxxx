I can't understand the lack of torrents on the web for this one; I've seen a few torrents claiming to have the complete CH discography, and they just leave TOLM out. It's my second-favorite of their albums, behind Together Alone, and contains several of their best songs.

Elvis Costello picked this as one of the best albums of the 80s; Bruce Springsteen personally fought for Crowded House once he heard this album, loved it, and learned of the complete lack of commitment/promotion from Capitol Records. It's introspective, dark, literate, intelligent and catchy pop songwriting of the highest order. And of course it has that wonderful Beatles-like energy that CH always had. If you're any kind of discriminating listener of popular music (as in "bands") you need to hear this one.
