Amazon review: "Here is a triumphant effort to bring back from oblivion a book that the CIA was alleged to have commissioned detailing the construction and utilization of various chemical and biological weapons. It covers a myriad of lethal materials, including those which may be cooked up in the kitchen. A major breakthrough in the realm of improvised munitions."
