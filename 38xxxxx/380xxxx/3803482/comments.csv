I've seen this movie twice on the TV and am quite positive it was in French. Now, I downloaded the movie and it is in Italian.  Strange thing is that on IMDB is also shown that the only spoken language in the movie is Italian. Also, all actors, director, producers, etc. are listed in Italian in the begining of this version of the movie. But, it is obvious that the voices are dubbed. Does anybody know if there is a French version or I am just  halucinating.

Waiting for someone's response.
Thanks in advance!

Also,
plx tell me it has an english sub? :("
,brunorfmiranda,2008-07-01T18:53Z,"I saw this movie a long time ago. It is great. Unfortunately, I am having a problem with this file. I can not see any image... and I am listening the sound... do you know how to fix it?"
,ohjes,2008-08-13T00:00Z,Same problem here... No picture!!! Something seems odd. Have tried several players and I can normally play any film. Fake or mistake?????????
,An4h0ny,2008-10-13T01:25Z,i hope to god this works b/c it's IMPOSSIBLE to find this ANYWHERE.  i'm going insane trying to find a copy of it.  
,charleshamm,2008-10-31T23:47Z,"great movie
I have it taped from TV
and it's in French

Looks like it was shot in French
it doesn't look dubbed
Depardieu is French
Polanski lives in Paris with a French wife
(guess he can speak French)

but the director & crew is Italian

 a great film anyway"

,JBNyen,2009-03-15T11:24Z,"The Movie Summary (from iMDB)

Onoff is a famous writer who hasn't published any new books for quite some time and has become a recluse. When he is picked up by the police one stormy night, without any identification, out of breath and running madly, without clear memory of recent events, the Inspector is suspicious. Through interrogatory dialectic, the head of this lonely, isolated, broken-down police station tries to establish what has happened, by delving into the mind of his writer-hero, and clearing up a mysterious killing."
,falcon.other.one,2011-09-19T19:15Z,"The French release was also the one I saw, with English subs (Une pure formalitĂŠ / A Pure Formality). Still looking for a torrent of that release, too. Indeed a wonderful movie, but a few specs on the file would be nice as well."
