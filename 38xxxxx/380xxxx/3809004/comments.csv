,rapeMPAAhardintheanal,2007-09-17T04:33Z,"cudos to them for trying to stop CP.

but its the other stuff their doing thats bad, illigal in many countries. its a bad company, doing bad stuff. this being released imo to defend our personal rights on the internet, and to distrupt a corrupt company. imo worse thing about this is the heavy colaberation between the music organisations and MD, because the music organisations obviously dont have the balls to do illigal things to collect evidence to their law suits, their relying on MediaDefender to do these things for them.

it shows how corrupt everything is, they can do illigal things how they want and use material from it in court cases in countries where sutch activeties are illigal..

CP or not, they must be stopped from what their doing, and even if its CP involved they should hand over that information to the real organisations that handles sutch things, legally btw.."
,rapeMPAAhardintheanal,2007-09-17T04:41Z,"MD is commiting crime, thats the point.. and their going to hurt for it.. in a sence its also proof that music organisations are commiting crimes aswell, as they rely on MD for their ""proofs"" that they cant collect themselves because its not allowed by laws etc.."
,serrebi,2007-09-17T18:49Z,"can't argue with those points. lol, I just saw the imediate context and was like meh... Some interesting stuff came to light because of this. It'll be interesting to see what hapepns. At least I recycle. lol. What I love about this convo the most is not the content itself, but the unsure context md was talking in. I guess you don't have to have good speaking skills to make it far now adays.
"
,ThreeDee,2007-09-17T21:02Z,"The name is actually sorta odd. MediaDefender-Defenders would mean they are defending MD, not trying to hack in and expose everything about them..."
,TheGoose31,2007-09-18T01:45Z,"No, they're ""defending"" the public from MediaDefenders. :)"
,Animal1000000,2007-09-18T02:55Z,"
Hum, I wonder if this is usable by the legal teams of anyone fighting an RIAA lawsuit? If it is, it could really shake things up."
,uberfu,2007-09-18T19:13Z,"Something else -

If this stuff is going to be used for fodder against Media Defender - or in defense when the RIAA/MPAA come after individuals - someone should use the content to press charges against ANY entity that hired Media Defender to conduct such practices [such as Fox Studios]_

I mean an individual in the US can be endicted on charges for soliciting anything from a prostitue to drugs to hiring a hitman to kill a spouse_  So why shoul Fox or Universal [or whoever jumped on board with Media Defender] be any different ?"
,JoakimLj,2007-09-20T21:33Z,"LOL, will listen to this and download the mails just to get them angry :D"
,capnchronic,2007-09-21T05:18Z,"I'm downloading this now, ill try and uplaod this and any other stuff MDDefender rls, just incase people stop seeding etc. 

Keep up the good work guys :D"
,KarmaKomik,2008-05-08T07:38Z,You guys are awesome :) .... Keep up the good work !! .... It would be great if MDDefenders could get some really embarrassing info abt any MD employee [everyone has a skeleton in the closet] .... And also on those RIAA and MPAA arseholes .....
,ld78,2009-02-24T11:35Z,"This would be very amazing.
Thank you so much for this great work, keep rocking :)"
,4l13ndud3,2009-03-02T07:23Z,i doubt they even care about CP. They're probably just saying they care about CP to keep the General Attorney distracted from their evil anti-p2p intents
