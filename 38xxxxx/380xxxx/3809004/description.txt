MediaDefender-Defenders proudly presents some more internal
MediaDefender stuff... more will follow when time is ready.

MediaDefender thinks they've shut out their internals from
us. Thats what they think.             

The past 9 months we also monitored MDs phone systems. This
is just one phone call, 25 minutes long, with the New York 
State General Attorney.

Spread it like the wind! Someone willing to transcribe this
so the search engines will find it as well?
