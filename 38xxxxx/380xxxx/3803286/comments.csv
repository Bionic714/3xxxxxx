,Anonymiter,2007-11-22T11:36Z,"   Its a simple, easy to use program that looks and feels much like your basic image editor. However, this program's primary focus is on icons, and it does them fairly well. It allows you to create your own icons, edit preexisting ones, and even format multi-icons and icon libraries. Though its not the ""end all"" in icon design, it does provide you with all the necessary features to create top notch icons for whatever reason you may need them. 

   Another notable and, in my opinion, amazing feature of this program is the cursor options. Once you've finished designing your 32 pixel image(the only size supported by the feature) you can choose to convert it into a cursor. All the fixings are there between hot-spot placing, test buttons, and even colors areas to make sure your fun little image doesn't disappear on your new background. Lastly, by adding in the ability to make your cursors animated you open the door to a world of fun.

   Though this little program isn't going to obliterate the almighty PhotoShop, it does serve to be a great use to those that need it. Besides, who could pass up showing off your new glowing lightsaber or flaming gun cursor to all your geeky friends? No one... thats who!!"
