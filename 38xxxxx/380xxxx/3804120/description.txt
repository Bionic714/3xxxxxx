Plot Outline:
When the ten-year-old son, David, (Blake Woodruff) of a wealthy New England socialite is abducted, his kidnapper Max Harper (Josh Holloway) and his seedy associates assume it will be a routine kidnapping in exchange for a large ransom. Unknown to the kidnappers, the shy and reserved David actually has a hidden agenda of his own, and a mysterious way of tapping into the minds of others. Soon, Max will wish that he had never kidnapped David, much less even heard of him.
