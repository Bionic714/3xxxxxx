,sphinxios,2007-09-14T09:55Z,"for people to be aware of is that bearshare has
spyware built-in it self so use it with caution"
,D3LinQuENT,2007-09-14T15:40Z,"i advice u to scan it for adware or spyware then talk shit about it. 
Bearshare is the fastest P2P, i tryed before LimeWire, Imesh, Ares, eMule they were the shit, Bearshare rocks it has the fastest downloads, and u nobs dont talk shit when u dont know nothing about Bearshare this is not the sponsored version its full version u dumbasses."
,sphinxios,2007-09-14T23:01Z,"maybe its fast but it sure has software added without ur consent so check ur things out first
and read their policy first"
,D3LinQuENT,2007-09-15T04:22Z,"@sphinxios

dont u understand, this is not the sponsored version, the sponsorised version  which is free, has a software in it befor was Save and yes it had a viruses, but this one is Full version download and install it and check if any hidden software will be installed then come back here and tell us.

P.S i am using BearShare for 4 years now and i never had problems with viruses, spyware or adware  Kaspersky Internet Security is my antivirus "
,blackal,2007-09-15T17:00Z,so is a good download or what?  It would be really cool if the administrator or someone would test and post their reccommendations for best torrents.
,skofdoggy,2007-09-27T13:41Z,"Oh get a fucking life you cookhead!!!!

What did ever come good out of limewire??? Oh yehh its full of goodies VIRUSES! You are just a random dick head! Bearshare is a milion times better than limwire! Of curse its going to have im it if some prick put it in the installation file and uploaded it. But it usually don't have that! So fuck and gain some knowledge before you post shit!"

,kaen89,2007-10-25T01:07Z,"i have also heard that bearshare have spyware and trojans etc, but ive never experienced it. so ill give it a shot!"
,Dryper,2007-11-02T11:00Z,"OMG! OMG! whats wrong with peoples these days....

Limewire and Bearshare uses the same network so they have both exactly the same viruses. LOL!  you guys are agruing about who that have most virus... omg then i would say Kazaa LOL ahahahahaha uber noobs..

This is 100% spyware free (The installation) but be aware of the Small files in your search results :) "
,deepshit69,2007-11-18T11:07Z,How can we get rid of these illiterate SOBs who talk shit about Gnutella and similar p2p file sharing networks. Eat shit and die. Bearshare rules so does Klite K++ and Âľtorrent. Everything works if you know how to make it work and remember next time don't get me so pissed off that i had to stab ur mother's pussy with a dagger. l8r muthafucka's

,coke_beard,2007-12-20T19:36Z,"bearshare was the god of p2p before it was bought out by imesh. this is the last good version. bearshare started putting adware in it's free version before they sold out, but the pro (this) version is clean. I can get up to 500 sources for one file on average. if I get over 90 in limewire it's probably trash"
,thesickest,2008-01-22T17:06Z,Working 100% This is the real deal. No Virii/Spyware Sharing is even disabled by default. Leech Bitchz and STFU.
,xExUxBxExRx,2008-02-19T20:34Z,"BearShare is the fucking SHIT!Nice upload dude,scaned with eset nod32 B-E and no spyware found!thanks again bro."
,Hadge1,2008-03-16T01:53Z,"great upload D3 its a pity we get twats on here that dont know their pricks from their thumbs apart from their pricks have a nail on it.
So listen hear pricks, this is a 100% genuine download no viruses or fuck all spyware, and it runs with Vista. 
The only viruses or spyware you will get is what you download, either it be from bearshare, limewire or what the fuck, its up to you to have the suitable software to block it. 
For fucks sake dont get on at these guys that are uploading software your benefit, you should be grateful and write more positive things instead of having a pop at them"
,Rockerx,2008-03-31T19:50Z,"Thanx for uploading and sharing this version of Bearshare pro...I have tried them all,and Bearshare i like it a lot the are no virus /trojan/adware in it not in Limewire either...The only Limewire i like is Limewire Turbo 5.4.8 from pro sharing and they have also BitComet Turbo 2.5.0.0 is also verry good to....Thanx again D3LinQuENT its verry good!!!"

does not work"
,D3LinQuENT,2010-02-09T20:58Z,"WARINING: To all of u who cant get it to work bearshare follow these steps...

The reason bearshare can not connect to the Gnutella network is because it thinks it is firewalled because it couldn't find any other nodes to run the usual test.

Here's a fresh list of nodes to connect to. 
http://www3.telus.net/Aaron_Walkhouse/connect.zip

Shut your Bear down and unzip it to
C:\Program Files\BearShare\db, then start back up.

If it still has troubles get the beta in this thread and use the controls in Options/Service
to kick it into ultrapeer mode."

You would think these tard would figure out over time that most of these ""cracked"" or pirated programs have trojans or viruses etc....But what you fucktards dont get is the files/programs used to crack these programs send automatic redflags to most anti-viruses. Thats just the tip of the iceburg. Ever Hear of False PosotivE???which is all to comin the the pirate world haha. Well im ganna download this and see if its any good.

,nemosrings,2012-08-04T08:49Z,"Yep, false-positives is when the anti-virus software gets it totally wrong. And not only anti-virus software but some other security software such as anti-spyware and anti-malware get it wrong too, sometimes because the developers of such software are anti-file sharing so automatically set the program to give such false results. Some such developers have admitted to doing this.

And then again, some security software will give a false-positive because it simply does not recognise some part of the software. This is actually a common reason. Ok there are many reasons, and another is so that such security software deliberately does it so it looks like you are getting what you paid for.

Getting reliable security software is something you need to research for reliability for results, and research the bad sides to such softwares."
