An exclusive live mini gig from KT Tunstall to promote the CD Drastic Fantastic at the Old Fruitmarket in Glasgow. As with all my uploads it's encoded in ACC (ITunes) format and includes a custom cover already attached to the files. 

Tracks:
Little Favours
Black Horse And The Cherry Tree
Saving My Face

Hold On
Hopeless
If Only
Stoppin The Love
Suddenly I See

Enjoy!
