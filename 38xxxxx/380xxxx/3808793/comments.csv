,nosferatuthevampyre,2010-03-20T00:16Z,"seems like the bonus levels somehow got missing in this 64mb version? very weird.

completed all tracks #1 and no bonus.

i'm playing the arcade version of this alot so great anyways to check shortcuts for free with this one :D"
,droid27,2010-09-04T19:24Z,"Can you please upload a torrent of the full .iso file. There are certain options that are unavailable in the 64mb version (such as sfx and bgm volume). Also, i have heard that you need the CD to play on the bonus tracks as well."
