Here it is my first torrent, and what I think is a great one. 

You remember Hydro Thunder for the N64 and Dreamcast (I believe thats all they were out on). Well now you can play through all the awesome levels on you\'re PC. 

This game works great with any game controller / software.

Its in a .ZIP compressed format so mostly anyone can un-pack it and start playing.

After you unzip the folder, open it, and there will be an icon labeled \"Hydro\" just double click and you\'re away to play. NO INSTALL NECESSARY (I guess unless you\'re still using Windows 98 or something)

PLEASE enjoy the game and I will try and answer any questions you have.

peace.
