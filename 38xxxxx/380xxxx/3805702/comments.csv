Same style of game, done by the makers of Subspace/Continuum, the spaceship top-down view multiplayer shooter game.

Multiple styles of play, free, and its MMO.

First link is the free version started after Sony made their version P2P. It is run by veterans of Infantry from when it was owned by Harmless Games, and some newer players.

Second link is the official Sony version, which is free once again.

Stop by at peak time to either one, they are both enjoyable ;)"
