,Sizuper,2008-06-10T01:18Z,"Hi all - I burned this ISO to DVD and it plays great on the computer, but the DVD player won't recognize it. Never had a problem with ISOs playing on the DVD player, but 3 torrent ISOs so far won't play. What am I missing? Any tips would be greatly appreciated - thanks!"
,Izzual,2008-07-02T05:05Z,Sizuper are you aware that this is a PAL dvd and not NTSC this could be your problem if you are in the US or a NTSC region your PC will play the dvd but tv will say improper format or video doesnt match
