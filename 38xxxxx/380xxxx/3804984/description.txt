1985
Anyone who dismissed a-ha as a one-hit wonder must have missed out on the band\'s fine debut, Hunting High and Low. Though the band spawned many further hits across the rest of the world, \"Take on Me\" exploded in the States and the group never cracked the top of the charts again. It\'s a shame, because the album contains a handful of songs that nearly match the manic energy and emotional crack of its big hit. Further, it\'s a cohesive album with smart pace changeups, and it rarely fails to delight or satisfy a listener\'s need for a synth pop fix.
