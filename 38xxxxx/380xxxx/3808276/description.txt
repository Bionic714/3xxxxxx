It's the complete 1. OAV and the first two episodes of the 2. one - as soon as there are some fansubs of the further episodes (and I find them) I'll upload them as well.

If you just stumbled upon this: Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro chan is an anime with a rather random kind of humor. Basicilly the main joke is about the main character getting brutally killed and revived. If you do not want to download (yet) I'd recommend this site for streaming:- just search for it there.

last time i checked I couldn't find the first episode with english subs anymore, though. Also on the site you can find many different languages subbed (spanish and german for example).
