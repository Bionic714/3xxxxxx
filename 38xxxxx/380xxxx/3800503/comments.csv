Now probably there is way to make it run. Video Card setting and so on, but that I did not try."

,unpress,2007-11-28T23:34Z,You need to run the patch (for removing bugs)and the 2 cracks from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3893075/Rollcage_2 :) It all runs at least for me after this ... 
,Gooiorgasm42,2008-02-14T00:05Z,"This torrent sucks BIG TIME!!

For your information, the music is only available on the cd, it was pointless trying to rip it, the quality was shit, regardless what codec or software you used. Any download will be without the music dumbass!

Here is the game without the (set-game.exe) file, which is actualy a trojan ;)

All you need to do is run the Rollcage.exe
