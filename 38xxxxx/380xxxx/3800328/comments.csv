,nicozab,2007-10-22T02:01Z,ATTENTION: THIS FLASH COMPONENT APPEARS TO BE EXPLOITING THE PRE-9 FLASH PLAYER VULNERABILITIES AND SENDS KEY STROKES THROUGH INTERNET. This is a already know vulnerability -you must upgrade to version 9 of flash player-. The Kaspersky Firewall warned me about a keylogger activity every time I was running the movie.
