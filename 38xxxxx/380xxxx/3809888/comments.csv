[V],Kuthumi,2007-09-18T08:36Z,"Sample will not play in WMP, MediaPlayer Classic, DivX Player, or Total Video player. Dr. DivX does not recognize it either."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-09-18T11:19Z,"However, the whole 700 Mb file plays well. Sound is good stereo and picture quality OK."

,badmotorfinger,2007-09-18T18:28Z,This release don't run in xbmc for me.  Neither does http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3809727. MPlayer reports an error just a few seconds in when I run it on my pc where it btw works. But xbox and xbmc don't seem to handle this error. 
[V],Kuthumi,2007-09-20T08:52Z,"Sorry about my previous positive report. The sound tracking was bad in my standalone divX-dvd player, so I used dr. DivX on the file, and now synch is way off."
