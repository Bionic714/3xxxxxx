The Montreux Music Festival gets an infectious case of the blues as Carlos Santana assumes the roles of musical director and special guest guitarist for this memorable night of music captured live on July 12, 2004 and featuring three of the biggest names in blues guitar. In the first set, Bobby Parker takes the stage to offer eleven soul-stirring blues classics including "Straight Up No Chaser", "I Ain't Superstitious", and "Going Down Slow". A ten-song set by Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown finds the renowned Texas blues master igniting the stage with such classic songs as "Strange Things Happen" and "Grape Jelly" before the night winds to a rousing close with a ten-song Buddy Guy set highlighted by such tunes as "Done Got Old", "Hoochie Coochie Man", and "Drowning on Dry Land". Additional guest appearances by both Santana and Chic icon Nile Rodgers, this is one night of music that blues fans will want to revisit time and again.

July 12, 2004 was a very special night at the Montreux Festival for any blues fan. With Carlos Santana as musical director (and special guest guitarist), three musical legends took to the stage. Each one delivered a full concert set packed with some of the finest blues guitar playing you'll ever hear. Bobby Parker, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, and Buddy Guy are all headline acts in their own right, so it was a real coup to get them on one lineup. Throw in the guest appearances by Carlos Santana and Chic maestro Nile Rodgers, and blues heaven is complete!
