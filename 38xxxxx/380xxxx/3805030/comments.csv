,pcangel,2007-09-13T09:45Z,"Holy crap man I didn't think this would be real
so I downloaded the first 20 megs and played it in my patched up mplayer incase it was a virus
then noticed the intro
and WOW
How the hell did you get this?

THANKS!!

I don't want to get nailed and I live in Canada
or else I'd upload it to here..

somebody who lives in a more uploading friendly country please seed the actual file :p"
