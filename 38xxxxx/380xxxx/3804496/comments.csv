,Enzo03,2008-06-28T18:40Z,"So is this real? It's not 1.37 gigs of 27 Giant Porn pictures or something? >_> (I understand that a disk image may be huge)

Also, I don't need the emulator that comes with this. :x I already have it, but the other GCM I am not so sure about being that it has almost no one downloading or seeding."
,Enzo03,2008-07-19T19:14Z,Hehehe... it goes s-s-o-o-o-o s-s-s-l-l-l-o-o-o-w-w-w due to the gamecube being hard to emulate :)

,dlbrody69,2009-02-04T18:15Z,"this is from the dolphin help file: 

Q: It runs slow on my 4.8GHz PenthloniumXT64++ Pro!!! What's wrong?
A: The Nintendo Gamecube is a very advanced platform and computers are not fast enough yet to emulate it with the techniques we use. Expect speed improvements in the future, though.

THERE YOU GO!!"

,TheBariClariDude126,2011-07-04T01:05Z,"travmo

you only need to extract the ISO with winRaR. don't waste a blank DVD"
,AwesomeC,2011-07-22T13:21Z,why is everyone writing you dont deserve to have a comp just explain instead why its going so slow
,MrPoopers,2011-09-06T19:14Z,"@AwesomeC Because it's emulated.
An emulator uses the original files of the game/software and recreates the platform, running in a sort of container, so that the game/software can be successfully run even on other hardware (for example, a Gamecube emulator for the XBOX360 would let you play Gamecube games on the XBOX360 (just an example)).
Here (with Dolphin (the emulator)), an effort to emulate the platform (Gamecube) on completely different hardware (the Gamecube is built on the PowerPC architecture and Dolphin is for x86 architecture), but since Nintendo did not and NEVER WILL release the technical documents that would make developing an emulator straightforward, the hardware (for the emulator) must be reverse-engineered, which pretty much equates to stabbing in the dark in a room the size of a city (they are doing really well so far).  So if you think that the emulator should be faster, donate money or time to the Dolphin project."
,VegitoDBZ,2012-04-23T15:42Z,"Game works amazing, noobeh can't install it :3"
,squigglesklok,2012-05-01T04:51Z,"Couldn't get emu to work so I used 2.0 which I already had, never used the GC one. I never realized it was already working so well lol! Flawless image! Thanks! Runs good and I can even use my Xbox 360 wired controller xD Really fast DL too! got up to 1.7mbps through alot of it xD"
,1337haXXor,2012-06-14T16:45Z,This is the PAL version. But it works fine on Dolphin.
