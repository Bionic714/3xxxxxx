,m_anderzon,2007-10-24T20:13Z,What program do open a .daa file with?
,HooglyBoogly,2007-10-27T15:08Z,PowerISO should be able to open it.
,LazyD,2008-01-13T16:34Z,"Is this for real and clean?

Are these all properly portable? I mean, surely a lot of this stuff isnt the fully portable version, does it leave stuff all over the place? Did someone tailor these into portable versions? I ask becasue I know there isn't portable version of lots of these programs.

But if this is real (and not malwared) then HooglyBoogly is the man."
,LazyD,2008-01-13T22:52Z,"Scanned it with AVG antivirus, A Squared free anti spyware, spybot s & d and ad aware se, all of them found nothing suspicious. All of my definitions are up to date today.

Looks clean, but I'm gonna delete that monstrosity Limewire anyway just to be safe."
,HooglyBoogly,2008-01-22T00:53Z,"^haha Thanks. I decided to add all the most commonly used applicatons and npt ust every random one I could find.

Looks like it was a good idea!"
,Fairbod,2008-03-02T16:58Z,"I was trying to work out how you portabled up all that to 357Mb. When I couldn't get OpenOffice down from 199Mb. Simple , they're mostly compressed installer packs from www.portableapps.com. Some are not though like 'Portable TMPGEnc XPress v4.3.1.222' its a Thinstalled and writes to the Host machine. Saw that didn't bother checking the rest.
 However nice collect , no virus which is cool thanks for the upload."
,HooglyBoogly,2008-09-30T06:28Z,"Are you sure that it wasn't a false positive?

Neither of my computers have been effected by any sort of virus from when I put AVG on my pc. They don't have firewalls, either."
