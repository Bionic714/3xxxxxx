This release is a good-quality VHS-Rip of the movie "SÃ¶ndagsbarn", also known as "Sunday's Children".

Was made by Daniel Bergman, based on the novel of the same name written by his father, Ingmar Bergman.

Please note: This version is in swedish and needs a texted translation!

Not much to add. If you like Bergman works, know Swedish or simply want to help me seed this torrent, you are welcome.

I will have a capped connection beginning on october 1st 2007, and will have to stop seeding at that point until I find a new provider.

Some technical data:
Video codec: XviD
Audio codec: AC3
Framerate: 25fps

That should be enough to start a texted translation.

Subtitles Workshop should greatly help you in this way.
