,zygarch,2008-04-02T08:08Z,"Tunglov, I just saw the documentary about Hirsi Ali on the Sundance channel here in the states. I was so impressed, I cried. Thanks so much for putting this up. I look forward to hearing this book! I am adding Ayaan to my VERY short ""Role Models of the World"" list! Will see if I can put up something inspiring in return. Thx again."

,Ploni,2011-05-13T17:05Z,"I agree with basik77 ... fuck her, who is she to share her dramatic life story, one which shows a woman triumphant over backwards chauvinist culture! How dare she address the anti-Semitism indoctrinated into her and purge herself and even worse how dare she openly speak about her transformation from an antiSemite to a brave free woman fighting for equality of all humanity. What a dumb bitch! Most of the Dutch are sick of her because they hate women and love chauvinism (as it should be) ! Perhaps the world would have been a better place safe from feminists and human rights activists had the perpetrators of Van Gough's murder been successful in killing her as well. basik77 speaks for me when saying that she is a piece of crap and insinuating that people like her have no place in public dialog! 

Just kidding... What a douch-bag basik77 is... What a hero Ayaan is! "
