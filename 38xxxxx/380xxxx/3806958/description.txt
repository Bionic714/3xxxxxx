Hirsi Ali writes about her youth in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya, about her flight to the Netherlands where she applied for political asylum, her university experience in Leiden, her work for the Labour Party and her transfer to the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. The book ends with her return to the Tweede Kamer (Dutch parliament), over two months following the murder of Theo van Gogh, with whom she made the film Submission.
