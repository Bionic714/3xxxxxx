Alley Tramp:
"She went for anything in pants!" the ads of this notorious cult film screamed. Produced by Herschell Gordon Lewis. The seemingly innocent little cutie Marie Barker (Julia Ames who had worked with Lewis a year before on Blast-Off Girls) voyeuristically watches her Mommy and Daddy doing it, and she soon develops a ravenous appetite for physical love to become an Alley Tramp.
The next day, Marie's third cousin Phil (Steve White) stops by to help with her French homework, and Marie seduces him. Soon Marie and Phil are cutting class on a regular basis for assignations in cheap motels and in the woods. Back at home, however, Marie is starting to see how infidelity can ruin a happy family as the after effects of her dad's affair with his sultry secretary result in mom's decision to go cruising for strange men at local cocktail lounges. Mom soon begins an affair of her own with a greasy bar-pickup named Herbie, and when Marie discovers who and what she's been doing behind daddy's back, she decides to hop in the sack with mommys recent conquest. Marie's recklessness catches up with her when she discovers she's pregnant. 
Completely enjoyable if unremarkable trash film.
