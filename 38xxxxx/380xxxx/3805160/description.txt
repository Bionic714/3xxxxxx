V-Planner is a decompression program that uses the Varying Permeability Model (VPM-B) for decompression profiles. VPM-B is the latest decompression model that is well suited to today's technical diving. The deco profiles will start deeper than traditional models, accounting for micro bubbles, giving a better decompression.
