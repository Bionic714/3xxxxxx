,Dagby_theone,2007-09-11T09:58Z,"Tanks man!:D

,Conformist,2007-09-11T14:16Z,"Lmao.
NES?
Where'd you get Ness?
Lmfao!!
Thanks man, I was so sad yesterday when I couldn't rockbox up my iPod.
Hopefully this'll be done today so I can make all my friends feel dumb when I show them my iPod. :PPPP
Thanks again [Maga]Zine, I'll be seeding shortly, I hope. :D"
,Conformist,2007-09-11T15:33Z,"Alright, it's done.
I'll seed until...
Probably until I can't seed anymore.
Ha.
Thanks [Maga]Zine. :D
Again.
Ha."
,Stiker71,2007-09-11T16:07Z,"Since its more likly you will look in here, 
Does this work for 5th Gen too?
Or only 5.5?"
,Conformist,2007-09-11T16:13Z,"I think it might work for both, I don't see why not, but, hell, give it a shot, if it doesn't work, what's the worst?
You have to load the original settings for the iPod back?"
,[Maga]Zine,2007-09-11T22:43Z,yea i have this on my 5gen and 5.5gen ... Conformist thanks for helping me seed no clue where I go the nes haah jeez
,Conformist,2007-09-11T23:37Z,"I need help [Maga]Zine...
The rockbox doesn't seem to work on my iPod..
I don't understand it, maybe I'm missing something in the instructions?"
,[Maga]Zine,2007-09-11T23:48Z,what seems to be the prob? what all have you done? u have 5.5gen right?
,Conformist,2007-09-12T00:43Z,"It just doesn't seem to work.
Like.. 
I extracted the RAR, copied it in ''Kyle's iPod'' and then ran the patcher.
It said something like ''Would you like to install... etc.... .
Of course, 'Y' is for yes, so, I did that.
It said it was reading it, did some action then said it was finished.
""Press ENTER to exit ipodpatcher.exe'' or whatever.
So, I did, unhooked my iPod, and it just reset, went to the thing about ''Apple OS'', ''Disk mode'' and ''sleep''.
Then, if I picked one, it would reset itself and be back to normal.
No rockbox. :/
Hellllpppp!!!!"
,[Maga]Zine,2007-09-12T03:35Z,ok dont exctract rar to kyles ipod just .rockbox GB MUSIC VIDEO try putting those on the iPod then repatch it
,Sup3rkirby,2007-09-12T18:47Z,"Ehh.... I have nothing wrong with packaging all this stuff nicely together, but just for the info, you can download RockBox freely from http://rockbox.org/

It is open source, so of course it is free.

But It is nice for this package to include things like the Doom rom and RockBoy(gameboy emulator).  Those don't come with the default download of RockBox(neither does pacman)."
,[Maga]Zine,2007-09-13T00:21Z,Sup3rkirby: uhh yea thats why i uploaded it... plus this comes with ipodpatcher.exe made by me.. thanks for info.. seriously
,Conformist,2007-09-18T22:21Z,"[Maga]Zine!!
Sorry I haven't been on lately..
Yeah.. 
So..
My mother went to get my computer 'cleaned out' and the guy..
Well...
All he did was go into 'Kyle's files', 'Kasirae's files' and 'Cody's files'.
Now, I have no 'iPod_Control'...
What should I do??
I would restore it to see if it would work, but he also deleted all of my audio/video files.
Bittorrent as well, which means I'm not currently seeding for you, but I will be soon.
I need my music back on iTunes!!!"
,[Maga]Zine,2007-09-19T20:22Z,damn Conformist.. that blows sorry to hear.. just restore your iPod i guess man sorry to hear what that happened damn
,fab88dv,2007-09-23T01:18Z,"hey guys, i was wondering if these games damage ur ipod after a certain period of time and if i can uninstall them from my ipod afterward...thanks alot "

,l2oXXol2,2007-10-18T18:20Z,"@ Conformist
Simply download EphPod for Windows:
http://www.ephpod.com/
then rip the music off your ipod onto your computer into the music folder...bam you have the music back, as for everything else, if he reformated your computer you are boned, if not either use GetDataBack or a undelete program and it will restore your deleted files...just do a search for the files missing in some or a full scan in GetDataBack...peace"

I tried also to install ipodlinux and had the same prob of it not being found, even though it appears as drive M: in my comp.

Plz help, thanks"

,Yurn,2009-06-13T14:24Z,"Rockbox is pretty shit anyhow. Sure it supports some extra stuff, but it fails to support standard stuff. Reading album art from album tags is pretty basic man. And the user interface is just cluttered a lot of the time. Too many unwanted options.

Also, the themes are really not that great especially if you have something like an iPhoto. Hell, all up I've seen like 5 or so actually ""good"" themes. And no-one goes out of their way to keep making themes for older ipods (which aren't even 5 years old), when the newer models come out.

The bullshit can't even read a 250x250 jpeg and that's pretty typical res for album art."
