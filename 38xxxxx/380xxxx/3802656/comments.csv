,kajlin,2007-09-24T10:57Z,"WOW you are all a bunch of suckers, kanye, 50, there both jokes. almost all hip hop nowadays is a joke.

why not listen to music with real meaning? or are the days of good music over?

lets get one thing straight, if you get shot 9 times and survive, its not cuz your tough, just extremely lucky that the person shooting doesnt know how to use a gun."
,shaqot29,2007-09-26T20:17Z,"kajlin, people like u is d reason why hip hop is d way it is, dumbness all around. You need 2 b tough 2 survive a shooting, specially if u got shot nine times, and need 2 be lucky also, but 2 recover from it also? Besides, if u don't like it, don't hate it, nobody is making u listen 2 it. Try singing or rapping, maybe u'll change the way music sucks......."
