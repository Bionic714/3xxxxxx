The new and first video from Sansui Rocknroll for their new single The Reason I Am Still Your Friend Is For The Better.

Sansui Rocknroll is a new and upcoming swedish band with the intention of taking over the world. They have a fresh and crazy sound quite of their own but still with influences from Bob Hund, The Animal Five, Modest Mouse and The Flaming Lips.

The videobudget was 57 kr (about 8 USD) and of course you can see that. Still the video is cheap and simple, its really appealing and enjoyable.

If you like rock, pop and surf music you should be a big fan of Sansui Rocknroll.

The album is available on iTunes but Ive got a secret mail from one of the bandmembers who told me this:

-- Sure we sell the album on gigs and on iTunes but our biggest exposure will come when we make the album available on Piratebay.

So hold on, it looks like we will get the album soon!!!


Support thoose guys, they are really good and cool!
