Please write your comments here, I like to read them! "

,ZeNiTH_NL,2007-09-13T08:40Z,"NOONE IS SEEDING! Cmon..please don´t cut it off when you have the files! I can´t keep on seeding for everyone. 
I havent been able to download anything for days because I am giving my full upload speed to you, so please seed after you are done!
From tomorrow on, I will be changing my upload speed in Azureus. If downloading is then too slow, then complain to the others that refuse to seed. "
,ZeNiTH_NL,2007-09-15T21:24Z,Thanks for seeding people!
,codecoptor,2007-10-08T04:06Z,"You sir, are a genius! I own some cappella, but ofcourse when I was younger didnt have the money to buy much, and then later, when i did have the money, the earlier stuff was impossible to find. so later, you search for torrents with ""Helyom Halib"" and other words, and find very little. e-mule has a few single mp3s, but such bad quality. your torrent is just amazing, thanks so much in anticipation. I'm sorry that none of TPB users are seeding or leaving comments, but this is, i'm afraid, your average TPB user. Slow seed is definitely the way to go, also keeping this torrent running for a long time so the real cappella fans will find it (its not the kind of thing you search for every day). I have several Cappella CD Singles, which are unfortunately at my parents house. I'll reclaim them around March next year (2008), and post them here on TPB for you"
,ZeNiTH_NL,2007-10-13T20:51Z,"Thanks codecoptor  :) Happy to see that someone is grateful! I put uncountable hours of time in this collection
I´ll be happy to see your singles online :)

Now I HAVE a reason to buy that 500Gb hard drive. This is one of those times I should have free space on my laptop :)"
,gimme5,2007-10-18T01:26Z,"ZeNiTH_NL, I just ordered my 500Gb HD... can you seed till I get all the files? I'd really appreciate if you will"

,nixwf,2008-09-12T05:02Z,Yayy!! I dont know why I haven't thought to look here on TPB For the last 2 years for some Cappella. I used to love this group when I was younger and the songs were always really motivational. I'm sooo glad this is here and I'll be sooo happy when my download is complete. This is definitely worth seeding folks! *excited* ;D
,nixwf,2008-09-17T02:24Z,"Yo! Finally finished!!! Up and seeding. Thanks for this, I'll leave it seeding for moons to come. I'm loving the collection. Enjoy ;)"
