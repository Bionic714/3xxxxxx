The Mac OS X Address Book application allows you to send and receive SMS messages and make and receive calls via a Bluetooth connection to your Sony Ericsson phone. Unfortunately, Address Book has not been updated to support any new Sony Ericsson phones since the K700 back in 2003.

The Sony Ericsson Address Book Enabler adds support for many new Sony Ericsson models.
