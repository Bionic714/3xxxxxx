Dutoit\\\'s recording of The Planets is a double-threat: not only is it widely acclaimed as one of the very best recordings of the piece (the clear favorite of many, including me), it\\\'s also one of the most outstanding engineering achievements of modern classical music recording. It won the Gramophone Engineering Award in 1987, and 20 years later it\\\'s still considered by many to be among the best available demonstration discs. The sound Decca captured from this orchestra is beautiful.

Mars is never more chilling than it is here; the full-orchestra tutti at the climax is startlingly powerful, and the trombones that follow are fierce. Saturn is achingly mournful, Uranus nightmarish, and Neptune is awe-inspiring in its evocation of the infinite depths of space. All the movements are outstanding...


\\\"A superb recording ... the best available. This spell-binding account of Holst\\\'s The Planets could be recommended hand-on-heart as a supreme example of today\\\'s orchestral recording standards.\\\" - Gramophone
