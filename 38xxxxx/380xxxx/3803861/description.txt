Almost all games have Solution, codes and manual?
Don?t know if all works, but they should. Havent tested them all, but all those I have tested works good on winXP using dosBox

I would recommend DosBOX 0.72 or newer (included) for playing.
And READ Notes.DOC, it contains info about how to solve tec problems.

It DOES require some brain and medium basic DOS skills to make all games work?.
And I DON?T GIVE SUPPORT!!!!


I will not seed 24/7
