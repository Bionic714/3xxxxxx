,Economics,2008-04-03T23:00Z,"This torrent is very sloppy. Audio files seem to be missing from sq6, and the crack method can only be described as retarded and not essential in a DOSbox environment. The sq6 cp is not included (the sq5 cp is in both the sq5/sq6 directory. SQ4 contains the very old Space Piston cp, which was removed from the game in the late 90's (though purists may want it). Colonel's Bequest is cracked, but this is not specified. QFG5 is a demo version, and even cracked, does not represent the full game (missing datafiles). Larry 7 is missing datafiles. Most of the games work just fine, but overall this torrent has a lot of garbage. "
,SON-of-ZORQ,2008-04-28T00:44Z,"...and Larry 3 is actually Lemmings 3. It doesn't help that they are all packed in one rar file either, which, besides being completely pointless, prevents downloading individual files. There is a lot of good stuff here, and I do appreciate the effort, but please sober up next time before making a torrent ;)"
,SON-of-ZORQ,2008-04-28T00:51Z,"...and i forgot to mention that Larry 1 VGA is in Russian, or some such language I can't read."
,cronicclapper,2008-05-15T18:06Z,I can't even unzip this.  Says the handle is wrong.
