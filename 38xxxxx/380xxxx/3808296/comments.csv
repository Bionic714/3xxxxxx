,SalLimones,2008-01-26T04:27Z,Don't bother downloading anything posted by this dumb-fuck. All his uploads are missing one part of the archive.
,darkNiGHTS007,2008-08-06T20:19Z,"SalLimones, you're an idiot, nothing is missing."
,mikestrutter,2008-12-07T20:40Z,"I can't seem to open the files with anything? The extensions range from .001 to 016 and theres one file called e-f355.sfv  

I've tried burning with Alcohol 120 and discjuggler but neither recognise what the file type is.

What am I doing wrong?"
,Kilonum,2008-12-11T21:20Z,open e-f355.001 with WinRar and unrar
,Kilonum,2008-12-11T21:21Z,Winrar will piece it together from all the other files.
,xiIix,2009-03-22T17:15Z,"Well I hope this isn't corrupt or missing rars. I'm curious about this game, from the videos I've seen it seems to have semi-simulation like physics."
,xiIix,2009-03-22T17:30Z,"You guys think you could open the taps a little bit? Not man people on this torrent, so you gotta let it flow."
,xiIix,2009-03-22T17:30Z,*not many
,xiIix,2009-03-30T05:06Z,"I got it. Thanx. Also, you guys might wanna check this page out, it has tons of DC and other roms with direct links.
