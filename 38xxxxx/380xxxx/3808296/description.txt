Get set to take to the track in the realistic, aggressive racing of F355 CHALLENGE. In case you didn't know, F355 stands for Ferrari F355 F1 and seasoned driving fans will find much to enjoy in this Dreamcast tribute to the Italian prancing pony. Blaze across lovingly reproduced professional racecourses (some hidden and unlockable) like Long Beach, Sugo, and Monza, as you compete against up to seven computer-controlled opponents. You can also use your four assist systems (like automatic braking) as you race online against worldwide rivals and post your best times.
