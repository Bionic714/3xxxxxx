,Wieeeeeee,2008-08-16T23:40Z,"Who cares about a wrong category?  I'll upload a torrent in the correct category if it bugs you THAT much...
Anyway, it installs fine, plays fine and it's a darn good time waster!!!

Thanks a lot.  I'll upload a torrent in the correct category for those who want it but I'll sure keep seeding this one as well.  Great game, great torrent, fast download and no problem to install.

Just a missing TXT file with instructions.  I can expect some people not figuring out that you have to copy the crack file to the folder where the game is installed.

(and on a sidenote, I never really understood why cracked EXE's are always a LOT smaller then the original ones... does the serial key programming take up so much of the EXE file or what??? LOL)

Thanks again!"
,zadma,2008-08-29T09:28Z,well the game works just fine but the crack file and progam dosent work
,scorpio_india69,2008-12-31T10:38Z,Thanks
,SLiM16,2009-01-11T17:57Z,"@ Wieeeeeee

Cracked exe's aren't always smaller. I've used many cracks that have been significantly larger than the original."
,X-U,2009-04-13T21:30Z,"I can't open the crackcode.

I got an error which said that I needed an bass.dll file. I downloaded it and put it in the system32-map.

If I try to open it now...nothing happens.
I changed the file to a .doc-file, but word goes crazy if you open it that way.

What should I do?

Maybe somebody can just copy paste the crack? "
,hasbeenhonshu,2010-08-16T01:06Z,"Downloaded with Azureus on a  system running XP, 32 bit; copied to system running Windows 7, 32 bit.

Ran the installation program ""en_riseofatlantis_inst.exe"" which is in The Rise of Atlantis + Crack folder but did not allow the program to run after installation.

Copied the executable ""the rise of atlantis.exe"" which is in the Crack folder into the Program Files folder The Rise of Atlantis replacing the installed ""the rise of atlantis.exe"" file.

The program runs like a champ and is a breath of fresh air after all the Kill em all and let God sort em out games I've been playing for the last few years.

Thank you ulysses56 and good fortune to you."
