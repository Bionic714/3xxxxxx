THE GREAT CHEESESTEAK DEBATE by Scott Vosbury--A war wages on throughout the streets of Philadelphia, the city of Brotherly Love. Who sells the best Cheesesteak? The intense--but always comical--rhetoric between fans of rival eateries is chronicled here. (13 minutes)  -Scott Vosbury.

The second short swings wildly around in a light-hearted direction. The Great Cheesesteak Debate starts off hackneyed, but also fun and brisk, a man-on-the-street chronicling Philadelphians' intense opinions on who makes the best cheesesteak. The short quickly becomes repetitive with endless shots of people saying either "Geno's" or "Pat's." My initial suspicions that this wasn't going to be much more than a Food Network segment proved prescient. -Michael Buening at http://popmatters.com/film/reviews/f/full-frame-documetary-shorts-vol-3.shtml


Buening writes like a pompous ass. This is a great flick throughout, and if you find that a very amusing 13 minutes of movie-watching has become "repetitive" then your attention has become warped by all your first person shooter video games and daily diet of Super Gulp cokes. It's comical. It's short. It's worth it. -Kibbles
