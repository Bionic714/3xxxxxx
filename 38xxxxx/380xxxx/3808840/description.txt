Jasc has added effective new image-editing and productivity features to Paint Shop Pro 9. But more significantly, the program hews closer to its name by debuting some creative painting tools.


Pros: Terrific value. Impressive painting tools. Innovative History palette. Excellent new image correction commands.


Cons: History palette can be slow. Fill Flash and Backlighting commands could be better.
