,KKM116,2007-10-14T20:00Z,No movie here! This torrent is supposed to be the movie and a sample clip. The 8 minute sample clip is the only part that works though. The other video is 1 minute of a green screen. 
,smumdax,2007-11-26T22:06Z,"I don't know why KKM says there is no movie. I've just downloaded it, movie works fine (I'm using VLC however).. However, there is much wrong with this torrent... first of, it's a near-3h movie in a 700 Meg file... that is NOT good.

Also, specs are not accurate. Notice that it is written ""Source resolution"" so these specs seem to be before the conversion began.

This film is not 720x480 but rather 480x208. It is 23.976 fps, and sound is 192kbps.

I don't really know why anyone would care about the Audio & Video size...

So there you have it. On a side note, the NFO attached with this torrent says ""Come visit us at the [...] for a true account of how torrents should be done""... Can I laugh?"
,smumdax,2007-11-26T22:14Z,"How... forgot one thing. The sample is not reliable either... First, it's an near-9 minutes long of the entire film cut into 1 seconds sots, with no sound... next, it is not the same resolution as the full movie, nor is it the same quality at all...

A sample should be a simple 1 minute random cut of the associated torrent. Not this undescribable... thing.

There's a reason for having samples. First it's for people to see what the movie looks like in a quick downloadable way. Second, the sample reflects the quality of the full-film. This one is like false advertisement..."
,digvoo,2012-03-04T00:30Z,"Yeah, probably the worst quality I've seen so far."
,digvoo,2012-03-04T00:32Z,"Uh, I forgot.
A = 1
V = 0"
