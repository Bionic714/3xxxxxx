This is actually a re-distribution.  When I first released this here, I didn't have the poster art that it has now, it was incorrectly titled ""Tombstone [1993]"" as if it were the theatrical release, and I incorrectly marked the Texted language as English when in fact there are no subtitles at all.

And yes, the quality is excellent hehehehe"

Will keep looking for an intact file."
