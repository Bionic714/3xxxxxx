IMDB review..........

The hilarious Bob ("Love Camp 7", "Erotic Adventures Of Zorro" etc.) Cresse in drag as Granny Good is the saving grace of this VERY infantile tale of a girl school threaten by undercover cops and monsters. The girls are, of course, in the nude for like 90% of the movie and that's okay by me cuz there's some major poontang. The tall wolfman's make up is done by Harry Thomas who worked on Ed Wood's "Plan 9 From Outer Space"! If your girlfriend is a hardcore feminist, watch it with your buddies over a case of brew - you'll burst with laughter!
