,kaltis8,2012-08-02T10:17Z,"Thanks for this one -- it's bad cinema at its best! Like some of the others here I had no luck getting this file to play on some players. I dropped the file into an AVI repair utility and it couldn't repair it, but it reported that it was an MKV file! So I simply changed the ""avi"" in the file name to ""mkv"" and now it plays fine in all my players."
