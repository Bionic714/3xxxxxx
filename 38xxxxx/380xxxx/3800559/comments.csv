Most likely I suspect they found out about this through piratebay and only suspect me because I haven't uploaded enough to make any other seeders yet. It seems like they started using this tactic on sept 1, 2007 and it looks like it might just be a scare. 

To the asshole who looked up this torrent and took this action, watch your fucking back, The pirates are gonna fuck you royally for trying to deny us our intellectual rights. Money soon won't be the driving force that controls everything in the world. The people at the bottom are gonna want their revenge when their day comes, so watch your ass, you fucking moron."

While I respect what you do... and I'm certainly grateful that you do it... that comment is complete and utter bullshit. What about their intellectual property rights?

You even say it yourself... we're pirates. We are stealing. It's theft. Lets not sugar coat our thievery and bootlegging by shouting slogans of ""information should be free"" because that does not apply here. You're a thief, I'm a thief, and that's all there is to it.

Sure, I'll keep on doing it, but I'm not going to pretend to have some lofty purpose. I want to watch House and I don't want to pay for the DVD's. Period. Saying that it's anything loftier than that is just lying to yourself.
