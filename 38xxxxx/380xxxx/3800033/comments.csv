,Bosse2k6,2007-09-08T19:17Z,Can people seed a little bit more when they download and not be so cheap? I got like 2 kB/s down and 22 kB/s up...
,Bosse2k6,2007-09-08T19:19Z,Now I will lower my upload because of that since I don't get anything in return.
,Bosse2k6,2007-09-08T19:23Z,Well there u go cheap asses...

,Teoball80,2007-09-09T19:35Z,Is this the old WWp 2d or a brand new WWP?
,Undefeated915,2007-09-10T07:09Z,Doesn't seem to work for me.. I click on the .exe all i get is an error. Does this work on Vista?
,Eirik312,2007-09-10T14:01Z,"It's the brand new 2007 edition.
And I haven't tried it on Vista, so I don't know.."
,LawrenceX,2007-09-14T13:09Z,"I don't get why you said it's 2007 edition. It's an old game. Anyway, it works well on Win XP. I can even patch it (not knowing either it's necessary or not, no version written in it in the game). I'm seeding it. Thank you."
,Eirik312,2007-09-14T13:16Z,"It said 2007 on the cover when i bought it, so :)"
,x100762,2007-09-15T09:44Z,"c'mon mates seed.....

,Eirik312,2007-09-18T11:13Z,Can anybody recommend a program I can use to make texts on the movies?
,Eirik312,2007-09-25T21:33Z,"omg, I have the cover right here where it says 2007. =)
Anything else is bullshit =D"
,Undefeated915,2007-10-20T22:13Z,"You can't play this online? Even if I download the patch?

Is this the US or UK version?>"
,Eirik312,2007-11-03T17:08Z,"It's the UK version.

Have you registered it?"
,ulv130,2007-11-18T21:47Z,"How do i seed?
I'm a little newbie at this:P"
,Eirik312,2007-11-23T22:08Z,"After you've completely downloaded the torrent, you just leave it, and it will start seeding, WHEN its finished 100% :P"

,HinadaRuso,2007-12-05T01:50Z,"Okay, I have the game up and running, but is there a way to play on the wormNet (online) It says that it could not verify a CD so I am wondering how I can play."
,Eirik312,2007-12-05T06:40Z,"Um..use Daemon Tools to fake the CD room.

Just extract using winrar, and fake it with DT!

Working?"
,Kolonnellovon,2008-01-01T20:14Z,"Fair rules! OK for seeding, but dowloading's quite slow... anyway, works good.
Thanks for keepin' seeding!"

,walnutjack,2008-01-23T02:18Z,does anyone know if this will run on MAC OS X??
,Edgemaster1987,2008-02-14T18:39Z,I've looked all over google under the name Worms World Party 2007 and the closest you'll get is for a nokia NGage (2005) and everything I found was the old game from 2001. Even on cdcovers.cc under PC and no covers for Worms World Party form 2007 sorry
,Edgemaster1987,2008-02-14T18:43Z,"-walnutjack-
I'm gonna check this game and if this is the game from 2001 i'll guess you'll have to shoot a white arrow after it, but if this is the game from last year i really don't know"
,Edgemaster1987,2008-02-15T12:07Z,"-walnutjack-
This isn't for mac OS X
-Eirik312-
This isn't a game from 2007 it's just the game from 2001 but thanks anyway"

Worms World Party is from year 2001 not 2007

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_World_Party
-------------------------------------------------------
Yes it was originally released 2001... it has mostlikely been re-released 2007, so thats probably why."
,pvt.punch,2008-04-17T19:11Z,"its from 2001, even the included readme confirms this! but hey, this is a good torrent, it works well.

to install the patch, go the official website and download the ""Service Pack 1"" for europe edition. after that, if you try running wwp.exe you'll get a no cd error, so download a no-cd patch from gamecopyworld. they've got one there specifically for this sp1 patch."
,Belsebub19,2008-05-08T07:23Z,Seed please!!
,MatteKalle,2008-05-18T14:14Z,"Bästa spelet någonsin!

Kul om så många som möjligt spelar det...
därför ska jag hjälpa er som har problem med att få det till att fungera riktigt under Vista.

ctrl+alt+delete
aktivitetshanteraren
processer
avsluta process explorer.exe
starta sedan spelet genom att välja arkiv - ny aktivitet (kör...)

Jag har även inställt på att köra spelet i kompatibilitetsläge för win98/win me och ikryssat att köra det som admin.
Dessa ändringar vet jag inte om man behöver göra.

I vilket fall så funkar det felfritt för mig. Det blir aldrig något fel med färgerna eller så"

,TheShevy,2011-10-11T22:29Z,"mm, Eirik......I got some trouble, could you tell me what to do? 

It's done downloading and all

and I've run the landgen and regsetup without problems (don't know if that was necesary but.....anyhow)

but when I run the WWP.exe file it starts and a few seconds later windows tell me that there is a problem and that they're trying to fix it (looking for solutions on the internet, or something) and i get a message that says that there is a problem with WWP and we have to shut it down........

Anyone have a solution???? A little help???

Much gratitude
