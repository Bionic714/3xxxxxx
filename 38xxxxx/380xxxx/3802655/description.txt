This isn't diablo2 lord of destruction, this is a picture of cake, that was very good.  But i bet if it was diablo2LOD 1.11patch cracked, you'd have to unzip it and the password could be alex, and to have started the hypothetical ''game'' you'd have to drag the blank "game" icon over the diablo2.exe file.  and the sounds in the 5th act would prolly be a little messed up also.  But, then again, thats only if this were actually diablo.  This file is a picture of cake, that i am 100% sure, isn't diablo two lord of destruction...
