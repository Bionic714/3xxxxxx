,feralear,2007-09-17T07:10Z,"Billy, they'd be the smart careful kind who haven't been kicked off roguesci!"
,TheGuruTim,2007-11-20T03:11Z,What kind of person wouldn't DL this? The kind of person who reads BS like Harry potter and other story books. Anyone with a desire to expand their mind would DL this.
,sneakypeople,2007-12-06T14:59Z,"I'm sorry but I like to read Harry Potter, I like to read books of this nature as well....Don't ever fucking say that interest in one genre excludes me from interest in another. I have around 400 books in my room, 700 on my computer and I have read them ALL"
,RivieraDude,2008-01-05T11:50Z,"Sneakypeople, why don't you perhaps share some of all that knowledge with the rest of us ;o)

And big tnx to Roguesci for the outstanding uploads."
