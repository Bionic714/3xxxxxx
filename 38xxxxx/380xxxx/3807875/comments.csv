,egolost,2007-09-16T08:37Z,Download it from me? wait until the torrent got a lot of seeders and you will see that the transfer rate is a lot greater then to download it from the original site and there no 40 min queue to wait in before you're able to download. I cant understand why the didn't distribute it with bittorrent in the first place. 
,seedbitchimnotgonna,2007-09-16T20:19Z,Do I need a key or something to play? Buddykey or something like that? Im interested in trying if this game is for me.

,zoltan_jeff,2007-10-02T12:28Z,"Can i play this game at a private server? You can play WoW at Private server for free... So, do i have to pay for this game or can i play it for free in someway?"
[M],Lollash,2007-12-30T15:27Z,"This file can be downloaded from alot of file sites, fileplanet, fileshack, ausgamers etc.  And even if you download it from their sites, you have to use over 10 hours of downloading through the LOTRO luancher with 12 KB/s for some patch.  I didnt even try the game, i just gave up even getting finished with all their slow poke patches. And no, the patches cant be downloaded from a website like those in WOW... you have to sit and wait for a 100 years."
