Everyone's torrent is stuck at 96.8%
No one has 100% of the download...

Any chance you could re-activate your own share (same torrent, not a new one) long enough for a few people to get the rest of it?

Thanks."
,snathi,2007-10-03T15:29Z,Sure! I'll run it for today as long as I can.
,Dmiaf,2007-10-13T06:57Z,"I just started downlioading it, and I've heard that it should be really good...

I like the books a lot (they're like my favourite books), so I'm just hoping that you will keep on seeding for some more time.

Best regards, Dmiaf"
