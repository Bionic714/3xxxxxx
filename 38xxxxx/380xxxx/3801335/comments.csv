,Aerionix,2008-09-25T13:35Z,"Much love for another one.  Only thing is, I can't get it running.  I know the torrent is fine, and ToeD doesn't release bad games.  So it must be something on my end.  

Basically installed like always, unzip, run the lil whatchamajigger, run the game.  Starts up, Capcom screen, cue ominous music, play intro movie, then does it again.  and again.  endless loop.  I can interrupt it with a key press, but just starts it over.

There some secret way of getting to a main menu?  Thanks to anyone.  "
,mowe15,2008-10-02T14:33Z,is there a virus in this torrent file?

,Aerionix,2008-11-14T19:52Z,"Solved the issue I was having today.  Realized I might have discovered sooner, had I posted my system specs like any normal person would.

Anyway, it didn't like my Radeon 9550 card I suppose.  I upgraded this morning to get fallout 3 running, figured I'd run through all my old games on higher settings, and bam, this one actually worked.  Thanks again for the torrent."
