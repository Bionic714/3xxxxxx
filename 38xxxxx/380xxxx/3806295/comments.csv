,UglyPilot,2008-04-25T00:33Z,"FOR ANYONE HAVING ISSUES WITH BLACK SCREEN UPON START FOR S.T.A.L.K.E.R AND COLIN MCRAE DIRT: HERE'S MY SOLUTION:

There is a file called adi_oal.dll in directory; c:\windows\system32\adi_oal.dll

Or if you have a 64 bit system;
c:\windows\SysWOW64\adi_oal.dll

DELETE OR RENAME THIS FILE!

I had installed colin mcrae dirt for over 4 months and luckily I found this solution on codemasters forum. And I can play both stalker and colin. Before this, I couldnt play both."
