The story follows Tommy Lee, a world-class martial
artist and former captain of the U.S. National 
Taekwando team. While visiting relatives deep in 
the American south, Tommy comes to the defense of 
a small town being threatened by a deadly 
white-supremacist organization. But when the 
townspeople resolve to take a stand against the 
violence, and the group begins targeting members 
of Tommy's family, the martial arts master vows 
to strike back. Accompanied by his brother-in-law 
Sheriff Jack Banning, Tommy must infiltrate the 
enemy compound to bring this war to an end once 
and for all.
