Witchcraft - 2007 - The Alchemist

Magnus Pelander (formerly of Norrsken) formed Witchcraft in 2000 in order to record a tribute to Pentagram's Bobby Liebling and Roky Erickson. The "No Angel or Demon" single was released in 2002 by Primitive Art Records which caught the ear of Lee Dorrian's label Rise Above Records, who quickly signed them. A year later, the band were brought back together with Jonas Arnesén taking the place of original drummer Jens Henriksson. Their debut album, Witchcraft, was worked on in a basement studio with vintage equipment, which gave them their very seventies-esque sound. In mid-2004, the band toured Europe with Orange Goblin and Grand Magus. The band recorded their second album, Firewood, in England, which was released on Rise Above in 2005. That same year the band toured the U.K. in support of Corrosion of Conformity, backed by the "Chylde of Fire" single. In mid-2006, Jones Arnesén left the band and was replaced by original drummer, Jens Henriksson. The band toured the US in latter part of 2006 with Danava. During this tour, on November 11, 2006, Witchcraft performed at the Rock and Roll Hotel in Washington, DC. For their encore they played two Pentagram covers ("When the Screams Come" and "Yes I Do") with Bobby Liebling on vocals. Their recent EP/singel release, "If Crimson Was Your Colour," was released on 7" vinyl on November 6, 2006.
