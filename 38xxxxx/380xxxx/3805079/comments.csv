,encaloma,2008-02-20T23:52Z,anybody have any news about season 7. I heard that because other actors from the series have other movies to do and that Jack Bauer was drunk driving and has to do some jail time that the day 7 will be delayed until 2009.

,RunningRabbit,2008-07-01T20:43Z,"I'm going to seed again (100mbit upload), but I can only give up about 1TB of bandwidth up for seeding this month, so that means about 12 full seeds. If everyone can keep seeding for at least 100% after completion, that would be helpful.... don't just drop it at 50%."
,Osterhus,2008-07-17T14:46Z,Seed plz!
,mineslax,2008-07-23T05:12Z,"What player is needed to play season 5?

WMP gets no sound at all and VLC Player just gets the backround soundtrack (No voices)"
,walled,2008-07-31T22:06Z,"This is a great torrent. I started from season 1 to a little in the middle of season 5. Expecting to finish season 6 soon. I've had this torrent for over a month and I had decent speeds ranging from 10KB/sec to speeds more than 200KB/sec, but the average is usually around 40KB/sec. 

It still has amazing quality and it's free so you shouldn't really complain. If you got a problem with speeds, you should probably seed or upload more to people who don't have what you have yet; that way it is more efficient and get FASTER speeds. I uploaded a whole lot of gigs around 30 and will continue to for others even though I am not done with the download.

Thanks timberlax "
,walled,2008-07-31T22:10Z,"@mineslax

Just play it with VLC media player and update it at http://videolan.org. It works perfectly on my machine. And if you want to play it with WMP get the right codecs for AVI format. Go to google and type in k lite package."
,walled,2008-07-31T22:16Z,Also a tip: choose which ones you want to download. Typically 3-5 at a time.

Sometimes it's just the little things (like a pat on the back) that make it all worth it!

So, consider this mine, and maybe add just a few more for some of the folks who ""forgot"" to mention it!

HERE'S AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF ""24"":

""Sutherland says he's on for 8th season of '24' ""

""Kiefer Sutherland will be back to play Jack Bauer for an eighth season of the hit counterterrorism drama ""24,"" but the show's longevity will depend on its writers, the actor said Tuesday.
The 42-year-old told The Associated Press that ""24,"" currently in its seventh season, will start shooting its eighth in May [2009].""

Good work with this but i have something for you
today April 11th 2011 i just discovered that u have the wrong files of season 3 episodes 21 22 and 23, the file of 21 is actually the 22, the 22 is actually the 23 and the 23 is actually the 21. maybe i can edit this if u correct the files but i dont know if i can actually edit my comments or if u can actually move the files without altering the ""torrent"" that we people are downloading, but, if u can edit the text in here, u MUST put this in the tittle:

Actual----> Real
S03E21--->S03E22
S03E22--->S03E23
S03E23--->S03E21

Hoping the best,
