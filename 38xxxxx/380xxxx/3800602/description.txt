Just released. Ripped to 192k mp3, because tape quality does not justify a high bitrate torrent. 

From Stephen Stills:
 "I was at a Judy Collins session in New York in 1968, and when she was finished, I peeled off a few hundreds for the engineer so I could make a tape of my new songs. Some you'll know; some you might not. The following fall we made the first CSN album, and the tape has been lost to the wind for almost 40 years. Somehow, it's found its way back, and these songs now feel like great friends when they were really young."
