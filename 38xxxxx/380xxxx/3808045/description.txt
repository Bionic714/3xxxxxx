After the Twin Towers and Building 7 were brought down by controlled demolition,
this high resolution photo of the WTC Complex was taken by a satellite from space.

It shows the extreme amount of destruction that took place.

The core of each building should still be standing, but everything was completely vaporized into powder and dust by the lethal demolition charges and thermate.

You need a pretty good computer to be able to view this file.

If you have a program like Paint Shop Pro, or Photoshop, load the image into that program instead, since the default Picture Viewer in Windows is very, very slow.
