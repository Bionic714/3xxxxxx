,aliasdavidoff,2007-09-11T22:45Z,So I can't burn it on a DVD?
,duns2068,2007-09-12T14:27Z,with ratDVD to turn it to DVD and later to burn it.
,007craft,2007-12-31T00:08Z,"ratdvd is the worst thing to happen to movies ever.  Its basically a compressed DVD.  We dont live in 1999 anymore.  There is no need to give up movie quality to make a download 1.39gb instead of 4.5gb.  

I cant believe anybody uses this ratdvd garbage.  Probably people with crappy monitors and tvs who dont know what the word ""quality"" means."
