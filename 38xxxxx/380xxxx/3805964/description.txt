The English patient is the sweeping World War II romantic epic that's been compared  to films such as Dr Zhivago and Casablanca.
After a badly burned pilot is pulled from the wreckage of his plane in the Sahara desert, he's placed in the care of an army nurse and identified only as "the English Patient." As his memory slowly returns, a passionate and consuming love affair with a married woman is unveiled, and lives from both the past and the present become inextricably altered. Set against breath-taking backdrops in North Africa and Italy,THE ENGLISH PATIENT is a riveting cinematic masterpiece that stirs the heart and touches the soul like no other film in years...
