My final version .
Dont use version 2 it had a very big bug. This version works with all the shows and 

It's quite easy for you to add more.

Requires a php server installed. check http://www.wampserver.com/en/ if you dont have it already.

Gets episode names from tv.com.

It automatically renames the files with a nice formatting and the episode name
instead of the usual technical descriptions.

It also moves the files to the correct folder at your choice.

It is important that you edit line 11 to the folder that contains your files.
Check the source code if you want to add more shows.
