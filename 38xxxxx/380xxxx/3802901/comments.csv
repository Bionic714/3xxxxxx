useless to download again and again and again...

write a script, then test it GOOD for bugs, and then release.
otherwise we download millions of versions, its worse!"

I had a scandir (function) related error so upgraded to PHP5. But the code does nothing now. "
,JontePonte,2007-09-22T09:23Z,Which path have you specified in line 11 because you must have write rights to that folder
,JontePonte,2007-09-22T09:25Z,It is working perfectly for me have you pressed the scan folder link?
