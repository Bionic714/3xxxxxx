,geertb,2007-10-20T09:01Z,"You can only click (and run) the icon of the patched expansion pack!
So it is either the icon for 'Seasons' (with crack Sims2EP5.exe) or 'Bon Voyage' (with crack Sims2EP6.exe) if you install up to 'Bon Voyage'.
Because all the older installed expansion packs are available via the icon of the last expansion pack, there is no need to patch the older expansion packs.

So this is what I did:
- Install up to 'Bon Voyage'
- Patch 'Bon Voyage' with Sims2EP6.exe (available in the ?FairLight? directory of the ?Bon Voyage? CD)
- Remove of all the other Sims 2 expansion icons from your desktop (they are not patched and will ask to insert the original CD)
- Run 'Bon Voyage'
- Sims will tell you that you that you need to create the neighborhoods of the other expansion packs if you want your sims to be able to visit them?  So create these?"

Once it downloads all 9.6 Gigs of Data, just mount the .iso, .img, etc. files in Daemon-Tools (daemon-tools.cc), and run the installers. The rest can be followed from the torrent description above. Anymore questions just PM me on suprbay.org: http://www.suprbay.org/private.php?do=newpm&u=1956
