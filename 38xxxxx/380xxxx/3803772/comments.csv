,ChronicDK,2007-09-21T23:20Z,"when I opened the .dmg file, it didn't work when I just copied the icon file into applications. How do I get the game to work? An installation guide would be nice :) "
,RomanSPQR,2007-09-21T23:49Z,"make a folder on your HD and name it whatever you want.  Drag everything on the dmg to the folder, including folders, data, etc.

you don't need to dmg loaded to play the game you just need all the contents in one place.  I hope that helps!"
,ChronicDK,2007-09-22T09:58Z,"Thanks, buddy. It worked :)"
,Manhax,2007-10-20T19:38Z,Thanks for seeding! Such a great game.
,mozingeaux,2007-12-31T18:47Z,"Thanks Roman! I'll help you seed this for as long as I can.  For those of you who have finished downloading it:  as Roman said, all you have to do is make a folder in your applications folder and name it Ford Racing 2 (or whatever you want), then drag all the contents into that folder. Then eject the dmg and start playing!"
