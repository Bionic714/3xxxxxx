The major themes running through the work of Rudy Adrian are 
nature's earthly majesty and the navigation of space. On Par Avion 
(78'45") Adrian adds a third dimension, questions about his place in 
both. As this CD is part four of the Sequencer Sketches series, the 
first five tracks are centered on the animated and dynamic skipping 
sequencer patterns Adrian has become so good at producing. 
Rhythms build, layer upon layer, as each piece plays out - endlessly 
melodic, dreamy and light. The musical progression repeats in dozens 
of variations to create an intoxicating architecture of sound. The 
remaining two tracks are a sobering 30 minutes worth of music made 
in a reflective mood. Patient listeners are richly rewarded as every 
tone is colored and inflected with the mythic qualities of a natural 
synthesist. This new territory is particularly searching. Onerous to 
describe, wondrous to hear, these slow movements are radiant and 
still with an inexpressible air of mystery. This music has been 
meticulously designed and executed in an attempt to illuminate the 
inner darkness. The expressive potential for this region seems 
limitless, but who will reach? In Rudy Adrian's world beauty is still 
relevant, and people still possess the ability to recognize it.
