,=Post@L=,2007-09-14T11:51Z,"Im glad you finally acknowledged there was a bug but...
Following animations still missing:

Artic1.bik
basin.bik
Iceberg.bik
more1.bik
more2.bik

plus a load of movies

Install the bik player and you can see what the bik file contains.

Just download the whole gamemovie directory here and you have it all. Because its from the original disks:

And it also works perfectly with this version."
