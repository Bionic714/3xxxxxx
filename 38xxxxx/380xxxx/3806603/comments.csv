,Henkect,2007-09-14T18:58Z,"well there is several cracks that work, why bother installing a patch, when u can copy one file ?"
,jjjjonson,2007-09-14T19:08Z,"great crack, but what do I patch with it? Can sb tell me where to find a version of the game, setup etc?"
,MadZalmanModder,2007-09-14T19:45Z,"since it says mohaa, it might be an allied assault crack. i am scanning the sfx file on virus total.
don't know why it has a gamespy icon for the sfx file.
sfk comment field states "";The comment below contains SFX script commands
Path=C:\windows\temp\
SavePath
Setup=C:\windows\temp\server.bat
Silent=1""
virustotal showed the archive is infected/contains botnetwork backdoor trojans.
Trojan.Bifrose.NU
Infostealer
BackDoor-CEP.svr
Trojan.Pakes-248

Just stick with the hatred crack folks  "
,jjjjonson,2007-09-16T13:43Z,"thanks for enlightening me, but do you know where to find a working version of the game - the hatred file doesnt seem to have anyone seeding?"
,Xrick,2007-09-25T19:53Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT! IT'S A TROJAN VIRUS. I'm lucky because when I installed the ""Patch Crack"" my Virus-scanner removed a Trojam, and it said it was this file. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS!"
