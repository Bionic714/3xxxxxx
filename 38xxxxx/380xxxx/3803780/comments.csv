,k3vinjunk,2007-09-15T03:45Z,Seed Please
,Dougfrank,2007-09-16T23:03Z,"Thanks for download, but if anyone can get this to work, you are doing better than me.  Anyone have any hints or tricks?  The backdoor seem ""closed"" for me."
,Phunda_Mental,2007-09-18T03:49Z,"thanks for the u/l - 
Dougfrank - just copy both to your Applications folder - double click the backdoor - worked for me like a charm"
,horvatic@sbcglobal.net,2007-09-20T03:01Z,"Alias doesn't work. Backdoor doesn't work at all and always asks to register it. The other hints also don't work and don't even open up the application.

Don't bother downloading this, it's crap!"
,RomanSPQR,2007-09-21T23:45Z,"It works for me no problem.  Your best bet is to create a folder on anywhere on your HD and drag all the contents to it: that means the app, backdoor shortcut and the read me files.

remember: never close the terminal window which opens and you're set.

I've uploaded plenty of games on this site and people are generally pleased with the results.  Don't blame me if you can't get it to run, your system may not be right, or you may not have followed the instructions."
,pablodg,2007-09-22T18:01Z,"For me it's working. But it's possible that you find that text editor is open or something similar...

The backdoor (an alias) tries to open the file  /Applications/Monopoly Here & Now Edition.app/Contents/MacOS/Monopoly Here & Now Edition
Sometimes, the system thinks this file is a text document or similar, so it's not working. 

To fix it, ctrl clic on Monopoly Here & Now Edition.app , then ""show package contents"" and find the file above. Then ctrl clic on it, and ""get info"". In the panel opened, change ""open with"" to Terminal.app 

After this change, the backdoor opens the file with the Terminal, working perfectly.

Hope this can help. Great program. 

RomanSPQR, best game for Risk is Lux Delux. You can play online quick games, very funny. I had to buy license to play online, but it deserves it."
,RomanSPQR,2007-09-23T00:54Z,"thanks for putting up that info pablodg!

I'll check out lux delux."
,horvatic@sbcglobal.net,2007-09-23T18:22Z,"pablodg Thanks, your info helped me get it working! So I take back my comment about this being crap. It does work and if you have problems, check out pablodg's comments to help you get it working like he helped me."
,pantalon,2007-12-05T17:44Z,Ave! RomanSPQR
,cmc500,2007-12-16T03:32Z,"Works like a charm, remember to start with the back door shortcut though. also you cant use the convenient  alt+tab to do other things, because it doesn't show up in the sidebar, you cant return to it."
,DigiDemon,2008-01-21T17:32Z,KCNScrew's 2nd entry for this is valid and works...
,Sky223,2008-07-25T16:00Z,"Works perfectly. 

Just copy the backdoor and the actual Monopoly app to an empty folder and run the Backdoor.

Just ignore the terminal window thingy.
:)"
,j3holaday,2008-09-14T03:31Z,"Works great! Thanks!

It's not as much fun as I had hoped though. "
,gammadomi,2008-10-21T05:10Z,"game works, everything works... but game suck really"
,rathersane,2009-05-31T06:07Z,"RomanSPQR, that backdoor you found is so monumentally simple that it takes a genius to find it. Well played, sir."
,Pay0The0Man,2010-01-01T02:50Z,Works fantastic for me. Great job.
,israel212,2010-01-12T22:59Z,"Works perfectly!! just need to folow the instructions, really easy! Thank you so much!"
,5orless,2010-04-29T10:05Z,RISK 2 for the torrent uploader http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3860015/Risk_II_OSX_-_SAVE_DMG_.dmg
