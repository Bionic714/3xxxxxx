Hi Guys, the torrent is huge as an angry Hulk, I know, and it will take you a while to download.
It starts slow too but gets faster after a while.

It is the most comprehensive of the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno series on the net.

I didn\'t want to change anything, because s17b44ee frommade it, and he updates it frequently when he has new files available.



Season 2 is missing Escape from Los Santos, Wildfire, No Escape (first 15 minutes)
Season 3 is missing episodes 19 onward
Season 4 is missing episodes 3 onward
Season 5 is missing

I someone has any of the missing files please don\'t hesitate uploading it and notify either one of us if you don\'t mind.
Thanx, Elynitthria
