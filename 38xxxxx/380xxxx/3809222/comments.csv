,gubbensomvaegra,2009-02-07T02:16Z,"this is not the complete album,i have it on vinyl somewhere.
IÂ´ve tried to buy it on cd but with no succes,please are there someone that can upload the complete album(its realy the only one of there albums that is really good).....but this one its REALLY good,a real classic!!
songs missing:
Black December(side one)
Plastic Dreamer(side two)
Once around the world(side two)

The big problem is that these are the best song on the album.
I live in hope of the community
