Avg. Rating:  	
  3 / 5 (based on 5 ratings).

Plot:	A brother and sister must face a yellow-robed warrior, the Red Python, a sinuous snake-charmer, and a silk-masked beauty (who must kill or wed the first man to see her face) before they can bring peace to their battle-addled family.

Overview:	Pao Hsueh-li, the trusted co-director for several of Chang Cheh's most memorable productions (including The Water Margin), here creates one of his own. A brother who loves books and a sister who loves swords must face a yellow-robed warrior, the Red Python, a sinuous snake-charmer, and a silk-masked beauty (who must kill or wed the first man to see her face) before they can bring peace to their battle-addled family in this special, cliche-smashing production.
