,isafos,2008-10-05T02:56Z,"It's a cdi self-booting file, so as long as you have a Dreamcast you should be able to get it going. Just burn the .cdi through 'image burn' in Alcohol %120 at x8 speed to a CD-R (HAS to be a CD-R) and you'll be fine. Otherwise, maybe try emulators like Chankast. "
,everettpf3,2008-11-18T03:08Z,to those asking if its for the pc: IT SAYS DREAMCAST IN THE TITLE.
