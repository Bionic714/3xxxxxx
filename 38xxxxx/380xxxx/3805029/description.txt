Pat Metheny & Lyle Mays 
As Falls Wichita So Falls Wichita Falls 
This 1981 collaboration between Metheny and his longtime alter ego, keyboardist Lyle Mays, presents an aural representation of their roots in the Midwest, a fascination melding of folk, jazz, and Coplandesque classical flavors. Particular highlights include the strumming 12-strings and piano flourishes of "Ozark" and the ethereal "September Fifteenth", their tribute to Bill Evans (who passed away on this date in 1980, while they were recording.)
