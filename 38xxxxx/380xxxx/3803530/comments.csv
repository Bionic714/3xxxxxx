Resultant files are too big for one disk, and DVD shrink doesn't acknowledge it.

I'd rather spend more time D/L larger, easier processed torrents.

Anyone have a simple way to burn this? (ratDVDs)"
,duns2068,2007-09-13T00:26Z,"you must install codec ratDVD, with ratDVD to turn it to DVD and later to burn it. "

like using popular Media Player Classic?"
