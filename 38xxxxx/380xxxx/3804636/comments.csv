,bigmahlman,2007-09-13T06:50Z,"yep, bad quality"
,iHAVOCK,2007-09-13T14:26Z,"I have no idea what you two are talking about, the quality is fine,even if it a little bad its still isn't worth not downloading, unless you want to wait."
,lostkid12,2007-09-14T14:15Z,"um i dont know what YOURE talking about. every other song is a different birate, sounds like it was dubbed off a stereo. its crappy. you can listen to the album on mtv.com perfect quality until Tuesday when its in stores"
,iHAVOCK,2007-09-17T21:10Z,"Well thats really fucked up, when I listen to it they all sound great and every song is the same birate, something must have happened when it was uploaded or compressed, I apologize for the crappy sound."
