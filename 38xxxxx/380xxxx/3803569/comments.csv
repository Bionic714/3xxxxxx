damn, dont you have a brain to read the description...????


S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe ( SimTractro.exe "
[V],Subzero!,2007-09-11T22:04Z,"@ShaneCD 

as a lame virus, (coz its thebyte by byte check error of em!.) 
Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics
you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.
(heuristics). 

LEARN to use a real virustool... bonehead!
Learn to read Descriptions!...    bonehead
Learn to read Descriptions!...    bonehead
Learn to read Descriptions!...    bonehead
learn to send this so called VIRUS to your 

virus tool website, they will tell you aswell that this is NO VIRUS!

hope you learned something NOW! (or never)

btw: way over 250 torrents ive been contributed and still there are boneheads who believe there is malware in them!.... wtf?"
