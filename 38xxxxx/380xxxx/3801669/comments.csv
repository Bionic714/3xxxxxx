Two-disc DVD ""special edition"" was released by Warner/Turner in 2007 and has both the reworked version plus the original cut. The original, however, has only a mono soundtrack [it was made with 4 track stereo]. The DVD also includes approximately 35 minutes of additional performances and other footage that was not included in either edition."
