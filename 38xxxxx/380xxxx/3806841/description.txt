The man who brought martial arts movies the most recognition was the legendary Bruce Lee, who introduced kung fu to western audiences. There is still no comparison to his lightning quick abilities and screen charisma, however, his untimely death in July 1973 left the martial arts film community in despair fostering countless imitators.

Other Hong Kong filmmakers had different plans and visions, and produced films based on the Shaolin Temple, the ninja, and the kickboxing genres. As audiences thirsted for more and more action, a "new wave" of filmmakers brought new standards and fresh ideas. Today's maestro of artistic violence, John Woo, now directs blockbuster movies in Hollywood, including "Face/Off" and "Broken Arrow".

"Cinema Of Vengeance" features previously unseen footage and an exclusive interview with Bruce Lee, as well as profile of John Woo, Jackie Chan, Cynthia Rothrock, Chow Yun Fat, Sammo Hung, Jimmy Wang Yu, and many others.

One thing remains, supported by generation upon generation, these films will always have an audience.
