1-what is it?

Rockbox is another operatin system like apples ipod os or linux...

You can play homebrew on your iPod.. Play games like DOOM!
Use a TXT editor.. ect.

Easily switch between Rockbox and stock iPod firmware...

2-HOW TO DO IT ALL EASY by [Maga]Zine:

1. Copy the folders .rockbox, music, video and ipodloader.config
   to the root of yoru ipod (example: F:/)

2. open ipod patcher.exe it will say a bunch of stuff basicly just
   confirm that your ipod is the one that it says it is. and press
   enter to install ipodloader..

3. when its done exit and take off iPod.

   boot into Rockbox or iPod Video firmware. Choose Rockbox

5. DONE! pretty self explanitory from there.. You can download themes
   from www.rockbox.com 


3-GameBoy games!
   Ok whats sweet is you can play Gameboy and gameboy color games.. I included a couple
   of gb games along with this.. ok so if your firmilar with ROMs you know that Gameboy
   games and gameboy color games have an file extension of .gb or .gbc right? well the trick
   is when you put them in the GB folder make sure you change the extension to .rock
   Then open rockbox and go to files and then the GB folder. Hold down the center button
   and a new menu will pop up. Click Open With...  then select RockBoy and your GB game
   will run... Switching to HOLD brings up menu to save, load, exit..
