,jimmie9,2007-12-29T04:55Z,"WOW! Adrenaline, Around The Fur, B-Sides, Deftones & White Pony....Nice surprise considering its a 'blind-torrent' LOL, thanks friend!"
,Stewabis,2007-12-29T07:01Z,"Music is all there and in check with the albums mentioned there, all good quality.
Something fishy about the directory all the albums are in though...keeps telling me the directory is in use and there is NOTHING using the directory on my user side of things. Anyone else getting this? (IE: moving/deleting the directory - wont let you do it.)"

I wouldn't bother with this torrent."
