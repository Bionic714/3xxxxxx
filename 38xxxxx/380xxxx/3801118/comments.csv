,Nightwalker05,2007-10-07T17:19Z,"kjaksweden, Thank you so much for putting this amazing film here and bringing it to our attention. Dick Proenneke was a amazing man. I was pleased to learn more about his story at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Proenneke 

I will be seeding this for a long time."
,spamel,2007-11-06T19:52Z,"Is anybody still seeding?  I have about 27% done so far, would really like to see this as Bob Swerer won't ship the DVD's outside of America and other outlets are also being difficult, so screw 'em!"

,PikKirby,2008-06-09T11:24Z,"OMG111 tahnks so much for the upload!

,spamel,2008-07-20T01:00Z,"Damn!  DVD got scratched badly by the kids and I had wiped this one off my HD!  Looks like I'm grabbing it again, although it's going much faster this time round.  Will seed it back too, thanks again! :D"
