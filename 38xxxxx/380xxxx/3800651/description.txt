Re-enacting battles from World War II is a popular summer pastime in the UK. But although we won the war, it's the Germans that most people want to portray and the SS who are the most popular of all. All good clean fun for most of those involved but there's a dark side too. John Sweeney tours the biggest event of its type in Kent and discovers David Irving, jailed for denying the holocaust, signing books, a trader selling a relic from Belsen and some Nazi enthusiasts expressing extreme racist views. Britain went to war to defend free speech but should it now be the home of activities which are banned by law in Germany and in future perhaps, across the EU?
