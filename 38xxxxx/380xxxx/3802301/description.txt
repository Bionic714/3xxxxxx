Here is what is said about the product:

Dealing with BMW complex Electronic Control Units (ECU) along the entire process chain requires reliable communication and data description. The Diagnostic Tool Set consists of a set of PC â??based applications which support developers, engineers and technicians in all aspects of communication with ECUs and vehicles via serial communication lines.

> Specification of ECUâ??s diagnostic data
> Communication development
> Reading and clearing error memory
> Flash data uploading and downloading
> Reading measurement values
> Input/output control
> Calibration of single ECU variables
> Coding of ECU variables
> Coding of ECU variants
> CAN (Controller Area Network) bus mode emulation

Since BMWDT provides solutions for all these use cases it is used within the entire process chain from engineering to test, from manufacturing to after sales. This is done by either directly using one of the highly suited BMWDT applications or by integrating BMWDT into an application specifically development for a distinct task.
