,mickeys240,2008-08-24T05:05Z,"stuck @ 99.2%    If it does not Dl that ok.  There are like 4 other torents that have the complete episodes from 1-10.   The cool thing about these dvd sets are there great image quality.  and yes they play in dvd players quite well.   However on an xbox, in the main menu, there is no volime control option from the IR remote control.  I think this is a bug in XBMC and not in the DVD.  
Thanks jjakob, I am going to send these out to my friends that also can not buy or see top gear for them selves. "
