Could someone help, please?"
,bunj,2007-10-05T04:54Z,What is the license # for this version?  Mathematica keeps saying the password generated by the keygen is invalid.  But I think this is because I'm just guessing at the license #.  Anybody? 
,adamisawinner,2007-10-05T07:05Z,"Use the license number (the bottom left group or characters on the key gen ) on the first screen of the registration then click OK.

math id will be the first thing on the next screen. enter it into the keygen and use the keygen to generate a password."
,theseus999,2007-10-06T19:44Z,which math-id do i have to use to get the keygen runnin?
,Magrudys,2007-10-24T08:43Z,Can someone help us out with registration?  I downloaded just the window version and I dont get any keygen.  Perhaps adamisawinner can write down the registration code? Thank you
,Magrudys,2007-10-24T09:45Z,I got it thank you and sorry for being impatient....just follow instructions by adamsisawinner..thank you again
,aoreida,2007-11-04T16:39Z,"Hi!

Having downloaded Mathematica and done the following as per instructions: Unrar, burn, install, I'm stalled. I have followed the first two steps, and what I burned was emwin601.bin and emwin601.cue. But how do you install this? Call me an idiot, but I'm a novice at hese things.

Cheers aoreida"
,Codebender,2007-11-19T07:35Z,"aoreida:

If your burned CD has two files on it (bin/cue) you did it wrong.  You need to burn the *contents* of those files to the CD.

Most burners have something like ""Burn Image"" where you select the cue file, rather than selecting what files to include on the disc.

If you use Daemon Tools or Alcohol120 you can install from the disc image without burning it to a physical disc."
,Dr.Stein,2007-11-27T14:56Z,"Will this work on mac? The title seems to say that it will, the information seems to say the contrary... "
,mcr00,2007-12-01T14:07Z,"This will work for Mac.  Actually there are three sets of files: one for Windows, one for Linux, and one for Mac.  You only have to download the set that corresponds to your platform.  Once you download and unrar you need to burn the CUE file to a CD as an image, NOT a as a file.  For Mac users you can use the free program ""Burn"".  Then you just install from the CD.  However, you will need to run the keygen (also on the newly created CD) on a Windows or Linux machine.  The process is just as adamisawinner explained; open Mathematica and you'll be prompted for your license and you'll use the license provided by the keygen.  Hit next and you'll be shown your MathID and prompted for a password.  Paste the MathID into the keygen and hit Generate for you password."
,DeclinedShadow,2007-12-16T18:01Z,"Hey guys, I downloaded it for Mac, got to the registration process and keygen. Did as adamisawinner said exactly, right License and math ID, but the password(s) doesn't work. It's on a strange form though; ""9833-835-211:0:10"", is it right with the colons? "
,azazate,2007-12-18T18:45Z,"Does anybody can only post the crack please.
thx."

,dev1987,2008-02-17T11:07Z,"I have tried to unrar (linux one) the files but it is asking for password. could other who installed it ..tell me the password ... 
please mail me at dev1987@gmail.com
i will be waiting 
thank"
,vslink,2008-02-22T04:47Z,"Dev, very brave of you to post your email. I wouldn't do it!

As to your problem, you must run the keygen on a windows machine. Take the license number that pops up when you start the keygen (Lxxxx-xxxx is the format), and enter it into the first panel of the authorization window of Mathematica along with your name and organization info. Press Next or OK or whatever it is.

The next window you should see something called MathID. Enter this number in the MathID box in the keygen and press Generate. This will give you the password--basically a string of numbers with colons and dashes in it.

If for some reason this exercise doesn't work, close the keygen and reopen it and try again with a fresh password.

I have experimented with this and I have learned a couple of things. First, you have to accept the password the keygen gives you--if you enter your own choice along with the MathID Mathematica gives you, the keygen generates the wrong password.

Second, the MathID in the keygen has to be the one Mathematica generates from the licence number on your your machine. The MathID is unique to your machine and is used by the keygen to generate the correct password for your machine. We just can't send you any old password--it won't work. The password is connected to the MathID and the MathID is connected to your hardware. Change one factor in all of this, and Mathematica won't activate.

Finally, sometimes the keygen doesn't work, and the licensing wizard will give an error and say you are trying to licensing a feature you don't have access to. Don't despair--just go back to the keygen, reopen it, and start with a new license number. Enter it into the licensing wizard, get the MathID, put it into the keygen, and generate a new password. Hopefully, it will work.

Good luck!"
,vslink,2008-02-22T04:57Z,"I used the Mac version, and it works beautifully, but I must admit that it was a bit frustrating getting the actual files out of the bin/cue files. There seems to be no Daemon Tools equivalent for Mac OS. I tried to mount the bin/cue files on a windows machine, but of course being a Mac disk image I couldn't open it :) I had to do it the old-fashioned way--use Burn to create an actual CD. After that it was smooth sailing.

I don't like to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it may be easier for Mac endusers if the Mac binary were in a dmg or iso format that could be simply mounted, no burning required.

Does combining the actual Mathemetica dmg and the keygen provide some measure of safety? Or is it feasible just to set up a two-file torrent for Mac users, including the Mathematica 6 dmg and the keygen? If it isn't horribly risky I may think of uploading such a torrent myself.

Any thoughts?"
,hemphemply07,2008-02-25T20:41Z,"I don't know if it's just me, but I've installed the windows version just fine, but I can't generate a password!  I followed all of the above instructions...   I've tried about twenty times, but each time the Keygen just throws back the Invalid MathID! message.  Does anyone know how to get around this?  Has anyone had success by just continually trying? "
,hemphemply07,2008-02-25T20:47Z,"I just noticed that every time I put the liscence number that the Keygen gives me into the registration form, the registration form gives back THE SAME MathID.  That is, no matter what the liscence number I get, the exact same MathID comes back.  Any ideas as to how to get around this issue?"
,us_anjan,2008-03-10T04:40Z,"Hi. I can't find the EDGE directory where the keygen is supposed to be located. When I un-rared the files, I had a .bin and .cue file. I used Daemon Tools to ""mount image"" the .bin file, which installs the trial version of Mathematica, but does not give me the keygen. Could somebody please help me? Thanks."
,Orlybird,2008-03-16T21:07Z,"Bitdefender SAYS ALL THE KEYGENS CEPT ONE THAT DIDNT ALSO WORK, WERE TROJANS!!! BEWARE!!!!! WE need to have this working please help with trojan free keygens!!"
,jamesonsson,2008-03-28T19:24Z,can i just open the keygen in windows and use the passwords while registering on mac or do i have to open mathematica in windows start registration and then open the keygen. im not familar with keygens.  If someone could explain the process of getting this to work on a mac a little better i would appreciate it thanks
,jamesonsson,2008-03-28T19:28Z,i downloaded on mac and i got dmg file ready to open I want to just put keygen on flash take it to my friends house and get registration codes if that helps you understand better
,jcsoldier11,2008-04-06T05:04Z,"It worked for me after some fiddling, so here's what I did:

After extracting the files from .rar format I used Alcohol 120% to burn the .bin image file to a cd (even though it said it wasn't a supported file type, it still worked). I reloaded the new cd and Mathematica started installing. To find the EDGE folder with the keygen you have to go to My Computer and right click on the CD icon and ""explore"" the contents. There you will find the EDGE folder with keygen. The keygen will have a number, you put that in mathematica as a serial, then they give you a math-ID that you put in the top bar in the keygen. Then the keygen gives another number, which you put under password in mathematica and hit ""ok"" and you're done!"
,ramtsor2,2010-04-26T21:16Z,"Here is how to solve the "" Invalid MathID! "" problem with the EDGE keygen for Wolfram Mathematica 6/7. 
1. After you put in the license (from the keygen) and your info in the installation screen you will get a MathID from Mathematica. Copy this number. 
2. Go back to the window of the EDGE keygen. 
3. Select all the text in the top bar and press the delete key. (So now you should have just deleted the ""Please insert your MathID"" text, but it will still show there-- this is ok). 
4. Now paste your MathID in the top bar. 
5. You should now get a password! 
6. Put the password in the installation screen and now your are done. "
