  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

                Wolfram Research Mathematica v6.0.1 for Windows

   Yep, not a great improvement in version number, but indeed a large
   improvement in functionality, speed and bugfixes... Check out:

     http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/07/mathematica_601_arrives.html

   for more information...

   "It's now two months since we released Mathematica 6, and I am happy to
   say that all our years of development and testing seem to be paying off:
   Mathematica 6 is a robust system that is performing excellently.

   Looking at our internal development database, I see that 6.0.1 contains
   259 individual code improvements relative to 6.0.0 (as well as a great
   many documentation and tutorial updates).

   What are they all? Well, they are distributed throughout the system (as
   well as in an update to the free Mathematica Player) - reflecting the
   continuing work of our many software development teams.

   There are a few areas that we pushed hard to include in 6.0.1 on the
   basis of feedback about 6.0.0. A leading example is the enhancement
   of automatic and manual proxy settings for internet connectivity.

   Connecting directly to the internet is a new capability for Mathematica,
   and feedback indicated that we needed to make it easier for people to
   handle complex internet connectivity setups. So, we have done this in
   6.0.1.

   Another area is legacy documentation. In Mathematica 6 we upgraded many
   pieces of functionality from "standard packages" to built-in kernel
   functions. The old standard package functions are still available for
   compatibility - and now in 6.0.1 their documentation is fully searchable.

   There are some good infrastructure improvements, too. After additional
   testing time, we're now satisfied that we can release a change to the
   low-level interprocess communication protocol we use - which improves
   MathLink throughput by a factor of nearly 50 on Mac and Unix systems.

   We've also made changes to our asynchronous process startup mechanism to
   streamline the initialization of services such as the Mathematica in-
   product help system.

   Speaking of the help system, we've been adding many new function
   examples and many tutorials, all of which are now available in 6.0.1.

   We've also added many updates to our curated data for functions like
   CountryData and FinancialData. Many of these appear automatically
   whenever Mathematica connects to our servers, and all of them are
   included in 6.0.1.

   We are continually improving the core code of Mathematica, making it
   more efficient, broader, and more robust. We made many such improvements
   in 6.0.1 - for example, greatly increasing the performance of ListPlot,
   ListPlot3D, and Plot3D for inputs involving a large number of data
   points.

   We're quite obsessive about the overall software quality of Mathematica,
   hunting down every last bug - sometimes for years. For 6.0.1, we squashed
   a whole range of bugs. To give a sense of what they were, here are a few
   random examples: On 64-bit Windows, the front end could crash if the
   contents of a Tooltip were insanely large.

   On Linux systems with Firefox set as the default browser, hyperlinks
   containing "&" would not work. And in some extreme cases on Intel
   CPUs, RandomInteger with the non-default method MKL could return
   values outside the prescribed bounds.

   And, of course, everything you've created in Mathematica 6.0.0 will work
   in Mathematica 6.0.1.

   But a few new things will work too, and it'll be a little (or in a few
   cases, a lot) faster."

   Long recognized as the world's most powerful mathematical software system,
   Mathematica has steadily grown in breadth and depth to become today an
   unparalleled platform for all forms of computation.

   Powering innovation in research, development, and education.

   With thousands of original algorithms and a tightly unified overall design,
   Mathematica spans projects of all sizes, from simple calculator operations
   and educational demonstrations to large-scale systems deployment and
   maximum-power supercomputing.

   The most important advance in the 20 year history of Mathematica.

   Building on two decades of world-class algorithm and software development,
   Mathematica 6 represents a dramatic breakthrough that immensely broadens
   Mathematicas scope and applicability, and redefines the very way we think
   about computation.

   Made possible by Mathematica's unique symbolic architecture, Mathematica 6
   introduces a sweeping unification of language and interface concepts that
   makes possible a new level of automation in algorithmic computation,
   interactive manipulation and dynamic presentation, as well as a whole new
   way of interacting with the world of data.

   Mathematica 6.0 fundamentally redefines Mathematica and introduces a major
   new paradigm for computation.

   Building on Mathematica's time-tested core symbolic architecture, version
   6.0 adds nearly a thousand new functions almost doubling the total number
   of functions in the system, dramatically increasing both the breadth and
   depth of Mathematica's capabilities, as well as introducing hundreds of
   major original algorithms, and perhaps a thousand new ideas, large and
   small.
