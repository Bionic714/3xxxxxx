,dan6550,2007-09-23T02:08Z,"when installing what does ""mount or burn"" mean?"
,piolp,2007-09-23T02:53Z,wtf.... IMG file???? how do I mount that?
,wouterman,2007-09-25T17:24Z,i cant open install.exe or autorun.exe it is error  CAN U EXPLAIN???
,DoaKao,2007-09-25T21:47Z,"I wouldn't recommend this... Nothing wrong with the torrent but this is the second time I've downloaded this game and it still doesn't work for me. I just get a blackscreen when I start the game. I've tried different resolutions in my settings, updated my drivers and even tried to run it on another account, but the same blackscreen appears. I've looked for the 1.1 patch but the only one I can find is the US one, which seems to be incompitable with this version.

This game is literally driving me mad..."
,DoaKao,2007-09-30T17:57Z,"I don't know, I have a pretty old Geforce 6800 GT, 256 MB, seems strange that it wouldn't work with this game, since it works with all the new games such as FEAR :(

But it seems most logical that the problem lies with my GPU."
,eatthypet223,2007-10-02T21:20Z,"Alright so I just finished downloading this game and When i got to unzip the files i get to about 30% and i get an error message saying that one of the files is corrupt. 

This is exactly what I'm getting every time at 30%
""My Documents\BitTorrent Downloads\LOTR\lOTR Fellowship Of the Ring.rar: CRC failed in Lotr The Fellowship Of The Ring.img. The file is corrupt""

Has anyone else had this problem and if so, any suggestions on how to fix it? At first I thought that maybe something went wrong during the download but just to make sure I'm downloading the game again. 

I'd appreciate any help you can give.

,DoaKao,2007-12-28T23:29Z,"Thanks man, the game starts perfectly fine now! Although, I can only run it for like max 5 mins before it locks up ^^ But I suppose that's nothing you can do anything about.
Oh well. I got to try it at least."

Then check the box for the lotr fix

,pandirazor01,2009-06-07T22:38Z,"Hi, i need some help with this game. I was able to download, burn and install the game, but encountered some problems while trying to play it. I downloaded the 3D Analyze 2.36, and as I didn't find a ""lotr fellowship of the ring.exe"", I just used the ""Fellowship.exe"" file that's the game folder.
