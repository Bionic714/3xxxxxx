I'm of the age to which the spoken word is more enlightening. I have downloaded all of your uploads of the Economist and have enjoyed them thorough. Please continue to upload this excellent publication. Thank you again. Cheers."
,test_account,2007-09-20T04:58Z,thank you.   I am on the verge of paying for the Economist this week because I don't see the newest upload yet.  Unfortunately I only see full year subscriptions at their website and I will only be here for another 4 months.
