,spankbot,2007-09-22T21:16Z,I wish some genius would make those ISO torrents!!!  Fuck...  I guess I'll have to do it.
,blemishednicely,2007-11-22T16:18Z,"2 Things- 1st, if this is ""only an ISO file of 'Cov. Op's'"", does that mean I need the base game in my comp. or it's useless? Cause if so, your connections to GET the disc(s) don't appear to be functional-Know of anywhere else I can find it?
-2nd, I've heard reference to Tiberium Wars, Sun, Dawn & ""Kane Edition""...d'you know if these are all DIFFERENT games, or just people's slight VARIATIONS/SLANG?"
,blemishednicely,2007-11-29T16:44Z,"Uhh, Senor...Hello?"

,dill3377,2008-04-16T05:02Z,"hey, i deleted the torent, i can make a new one if u want, sorry, thats y it doesnt work lol"
,Lucky13s,2008-06-13T02:22Z,"Tiberium Dawn is the first C&C game Released in 95. Covert Ops is the expansion released in 96 i think. The Red Alert and Generals is under the C&C franchise but have nothing to do with the Tiberium Storyline. The 2nd ""Tiberium"" game would be Tiberium Sun set probably about 20 years in the future released in 99. The 3rd and latest would be Tiberium Wars set half a century in the future released in 2007 and the expansion is Kane Edition. 

Red Alert was released after C&C covert ops, it has an entirely different storyline with no references to tiburium

Generals has nothing to do with any of the other games"
,Barbarus1,2009-01-01T21:46Z,Generals is from the same developers

Try to run it from the DOS Box program. ;) Its not very easy to use, but can be helpful if you like old games."
