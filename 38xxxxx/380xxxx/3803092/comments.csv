Just one question for you. what did you do with my notepad file. please do tell me. truth is DID NOT COMPILED BY FiNsTeRc Your a fake and will be one if you don't upload your own stuff. 
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-13T14:41Z,"Serch results for Uploader:sickamore - Your search did not match any torrents. 
Now of course you still have the torrent on torrentbox uploaded 2 days later, but again this is a Rip from the European release, but I'll admit I did get the video from Stage 6 which i converted to .avi. Thanks for the comment, try again when you have some uploads."

[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-14T02:11Z,"YO Sickamore, I bougt the CD in Baghdad along with the new 50 Cent Cd last month. We've had bootleg copies of the Euro and Asian releases for a while now. I'm home on R&R and figured I'd share it with others. Before you make threats you should know I get paid to kill people for a living and I'm pretty good at my job. I'll be sure to look you up next time I'm in St. Lucia. 
"
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-14T02:34Z,"NO, Not the clean version."
,edhones,2007-09-14T02:57Z,Thanks FiNsTeRc. Great torrent
,sickamore,2007-09-14T04:26Z,"do you want to mouth talk you mouth about things here, Yes i am from st.lucia. You kill people. You know what i do. I don't need to explain for you. When you sure do come here ask around. I will personally skin you alive and feed you salt water everyday as you beg for you life. Yeah right i was ripped by you. Every thing i see on you is fake and will always be like that. Simple just admit that you stole my shit. And you really pushed me. But i guess i will just have to take actions. "
,sickamore,2007-09-14T04:47Z,since you can steal go and steal useek's james blunt.lil mo. swizz beats torrents. that will do you some more fame.
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-14T06:30Z,James Blunt Sucks! I think you are mistaking your fantacy Role Playing Games and Anime for real life there Sickamore. By the way did you steal the name from the DJ or a video game. And you call me a thief. 
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-14T06:42Z,P.S. I checked out USEEK. It sucks too.

,Timson90,2007-09-14T16:23Z,"For all you who hate 50, well.. fine. but no one force you to listning to his music, right? so why make him stop doin' music? 
..just a thought.."
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-09-14T18:27Z,Looks like Kanye is leading in Album sales but 50 is leading in P2P dowloads. Go figure.
,JokerUppTownDown,2007-09-16T22:55Z,"I really hope that Kanye wins this battle!
50 isn't that good anymore, YOUNG BUCK is the gangsta now!!!!
