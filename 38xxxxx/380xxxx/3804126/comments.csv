,NotThePokerDude,2009-08-22T05:51Z,"GREAT story, well written, directed and acted...an amazing film - everyone should see this.  

Trivia fact:  This was the first movie ever made using ONLY Native Americans for the cast, crew, writers, actors, EVEN the funding!(glad to see those Casino dollars making art!) ...The entire film was made entirely by Native Americans."
