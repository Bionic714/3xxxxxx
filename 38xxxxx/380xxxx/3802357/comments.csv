,natasadj77,2012-03-08T17:28Z,"Well I played this game 5 years ago and it was excellent. But I changed the computer and it was lost. I download it many times but never found how to play it. But now Im happy because this was so easy. I did it like this: download by Vuze (get torrent file, not with magnet) then open the game. I opened file name Support, then file named Harry Potter II code, and I use this code 2501 5635676ďťż 9791120 3400 (it worked for me). Then I get back to the files and open file System i went to the file Game with owl icon and game started, yeeee. It was so easy, I couldn't believe it....I send this icon to the desktop like shortcut and that is all. Enjoy..."
