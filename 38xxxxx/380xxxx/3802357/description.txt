It?s your second year at this school full of wizards, and things just keep getting weirder. First this strange elf with big ears told you not to come back to Hogwarts. Then you traveled to school in a flying car, which you crash-landed in a very violent tree. And now there?s something loose in the castle ? something that terrifies everyone and petrifies all who look upon it ? something only you understand, for only you can speak its language . . . but how?

Thus begins Harry Potter?s second year at Hogwarts, full of wizard duels, secret diaries, disgusting potions, and a deadly mystery. Don?t miss a minute of the intrigue ? play Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
