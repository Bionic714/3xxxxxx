Please, its all about tricking you into believing a global tax apparatus will save you from the evil CO2 you exhale...trading carbon tax credits won't do dick for shit.

Hey global warming tards lets ban dihydrogen oxide, it is used in every chemical factory on earth and emits the most CO2 than any other source on earth........(it's H2O)


Global Warming is not your fault, not a problem, and not even an issue. In the 1980's they taught us in high school there was an imminent ice age and doom was at hand....

GLOBAL WARMING IS THE SAME BULLSHIT from the same BULLSHITTERS

Thanks for the file....."
,duhprane,2007-09-16T08:54Z,"Oh yeah, I can't burn leaves in my yard because Toyota bought up all the fucking carbon tax credits in my county.....

tell me - what the fuck has that got to do with freedom - and how the fuck will a pile of leaves in my motherfucking front yard gonna doom the planet? 

Fuck all dipshits who believe global warming is man made - tell me fuck tards, how has burning leaves in my front yard managed to melt the ice caps on mars you fucking jag offs?

,septis1,2007-09-17T19:38Z,"Yes, I am also amazed at the amount of sheeple that buy into the Global Warming Theory. Even in the 70s when I went to school, I remember newspaper articles and science teachers telling us about the upcoming ice age. Global Warming makes for some great campaign contributions and some wonderful political promises. 
   Al Gore, the same man who told us he invented the Internet."
,Sachaztan,2007-09-17T19:39Z,"Urh...who ever said that you burning leaves in the yard=doom of planet earth?

Anyway you all sound like retarded American republicans and I can tell you that you don't make USA any more popular in the world by talking like that.

Just...do your own research instead of watching documentaries. And no, Global Warming isn't the most pressing issue as there are far greater perils to earth than that (most of them are created by USA and China), and yes, Global Warming exists and it's just stupid pretending it doesn't exist."
,oldngrey,2007-10-17T21:11Z,"The Big Myth! Global warming.
The film ""An Incovenient Truth"" would make a great presentation if it would tell you the truth about global warming , it's quick flashing scenes and ill begotten music gave me a sense of forbodding and doesn't not help to convey a sense of workable energy alternatives, this film made me feel helpless and depressed. Much of the film is with Al Gore without anyone really backing up his views , it is like a big ego trip.My conclusion is if you want a pure disaster horror film then this is the one for you, but if you want a unbiased view of global temperature change then look to the bbc horizion documentary about global climate change. the nobel prize has lost all of its meaning and prestige since Al Gore got his. If anyone believes that humans causes global warming is either ignorant or having an agenda. Al Gore does have an agenda, look at his new company which buys and sells carbon credits, instant money for nothing.The ""Greener"" religion just doesn't standup to Scientific facts. Al Gore would sell his mother for a little feel good publicity. Alfred Nobel is probably rolling in his grave over what the Nobel prize become. The Nobel Peace Prize had lost it prestige long ago when it was given to Arafat, the father of modern terrorism.

The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not su"
,Tripps77,2007-11-08T05:52Z,"Just a little something to say to the person who believes we're all republicans who are only interested in profits:

THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE!  They have been pretending to ignore the environmentalists by not acknowledging the Kyoto accord.  They think, 'we're going to pretend  we know it's a real problem, but continue to ignore it.'  They'll continue to say 'it's not real, it's not real' all the while appearing to be evil, while they have other ""scientists"" going on about the validity of the global warming theory.   Then some noble (nobel) person with seeming credibility and shady proof will show up and say, 'yes it's definitely real, the debate is over.'  

Then he'll be awarded the highest prize to solidify his credibility with the people.  Even though most of them won't even bother to research these things for themselves.  There is a new carbon tax coming, people, that's what this is all about.  Yes, I'm sorry, but this really is happening folks. 

Big polluters have been saying no to making changes to the way they do business for a long time.  The environmentally friendly people who want them to rethink their stance because we'd like to breathe clean air should be commended.  But DO NOT pick up the torch for global warming.  It isn't happening.  

We exhale co2, as most beings on the planet always have.  Plants 'inhale' co2, and give us oxygen.  This system has been in place for an awful long time.  There were a lot of dinosaurs on the planet not too long ago doing an awful lot of breathing, but I don't think anyone is going to suggest that they became extinct due to global warming.

The planet NEEDS co2, and it can handle A LOT of co2.  I suggest you take your own advice and do some real research.

Btw, that cute little line graph that Gore puts on the big screen in his film, he forgot to mention how the temperature changes PRECEEDED the changes in the co2 level.  Yes, they are most definitely related to eachother, but it is the higher temperature from the sun that releases the co2 from the oceans, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND."
,grooverf,2008-01-13T22:04Z,"90% of the world's scientists agree it's
happening and we are responsible.
Check out IPCC

,Tripps77,2008-01-18T03:58Z,"Oh, you posted here too groover.  Same comment.  I take it you didn't bother to read the statements above your own comment.

Again, I strongly urge you to watch this movie.

Bear this fact in mind.  Polar bears can swim 300 miles.  They only like to swim 150, but they can do 300.  The polar bears are not drowning.  And they are not running out of hunting ground, they are thriving.  But do you see how the propaganda operates to coerce someone who doesn't know this fact?

Watch the movie.

,thamask21,2009-07-16T04:39Z,All of you guys posted so I may as well do the same...carbon credits...al gore owns a company that bought a good chunk of them up already and if this bill goes through we will buy those carbon credits from him so that we don't get heavy taxes...and if it isnt us who has to buy maybe the business that you work for will have to either way he gets his change...same thing with autmobiles he is into that business of making cheap plastic cars that I guess people will buy once the oil explodes upwards and it will...when it takes like 100 bucks to fill ur car up with gas heh that is what they say will take us to really start getting into these golfcarts they plan to sell to us and just forget about the jobs...way too many taxes here and buying carbon credits will more than likely be pricey as well so those jobs are overseas for good.
