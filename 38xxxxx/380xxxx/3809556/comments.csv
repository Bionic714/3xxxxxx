,K5sju,2007-10-02T12:33Z,"I hope this torrent works fine.
Because I need NDS games."

,zindy18,2007-11-26T07:36Z,Thank you so much ! 
,gazgaz,2007-12-02T22:36Z,"I am about to buy a handheld for my son
and need to know your thoughts on which one and psp or DS and a site for info on how to use the downloads; do I need to chip the handheld like my wii/ps2 thanks"
,JoshuaSmtih,2007-12-03T03:42Z,Great Torrent and Great seed rate Thanks a Million!
,sumthingsoft,2007-12-04T01:01Z,"@gazgaz - I own both the psp and ds and prefer neither. They are two very different systems. I use the psp for much more than just psp gaming (I have a host of emulators, as well as psp games and homebrew) whereas the ds is purely a games machine for me. You can make it do other things but the psp is more suited to that I feel.

You won't need to chip either handheld. You need to buy a piece of hardware to play DS roms (google R4, M3 or cycloDS) whereas you only need to hack the firmware on the psp.

Start here (http://www.qj.net/ ...in the appropriate channel) for more info."
,gazgaz,2007-12-12T11:26Z,"thanks for the info
bought the ds
and the cyclo

,blondbond007,2008-05-22T19:33Z,"Just to help anyone who is new to this:

I just bought a DS with a R4 card and a 2gig MicroSD card.

I can play all my backups of DS games by transfering them to the R4 card (+MicroSD inserted)

You only need to put OS files onto MicroSD card (either by cd or by going to thier website)

Next just drag and drop all your backups onto MicroSD card and then plug it in to your DS (by inserting MicroSD into R4)

The whole lot cost approx ÂŁ160 (DS lite, R4, 2 x 2gig memory cards (THEY MUST NOT BE SDHC!!!)

Lots of help on the web if you do a quick search + loads of ppl with problems, if you get any, and their solutions.

Does that help? Hope so :)"
