Top Nintendo DS Games rated by IGN and Gamespot. All games rated with score >= 8.0 until 17 sep 2007 were included (from both sites)

Most of the roms were tested on the R4DS and all of them worked. (including worms open warfare 2)

Each one of the roms is packed in the 7 zip format for better compression.
You can download 7z from http://www.7-zip.org/ . Its a very simple, fast and reliable zip application (can also read rars, zips, tar, gzips etc) with a very practical embed right click menu.

Thanks!
