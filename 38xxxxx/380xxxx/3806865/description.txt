Tai Chi Warriors (John Chiang, 2005) EN, Uncut


Meet Henry who descends from Beverly Hills upbringing to a car thief and goofball Bruce, a so-so actor that never lasted three days on the movie set. To escape the harsh reality of L.A. they travel far to try their luck in exotic china. Thinking martial arts is the ticket to turn around their pitiful lives, the two decide to be enrolled in the Tai Chi School of Master Dragon. Instead of any vacation atmosphere, they face one set of unorthodox training after another. Two Chinese beauties, Fay and Ling, enter their lives. A hilarious battle of the sexes erupts. Verbal sparring escalates to an amazing kung fu bowling competition. Then the four unite to fight a vicious bike gang. The bike gang reports to Master Tiger a shady fighter and an old nemesis of master dragon. He challenges Master Dragon's school to a network-televised no-holds-barred martial arts smack down to settle all scores. Unable to keep his school/orphanage afloat, Master Dragon reluctantly breaks his moral code of not using his skills for financial gain. As the series of matches get tighter and more intense, an unexpected turn of events leads to a huge surprise.
