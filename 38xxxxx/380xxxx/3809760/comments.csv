,cleddau,2007-10-06T20:13Z,doesn't work. Liscence expires after reboot
,bitemeborb,2007-10-10T04:22Z,This is correct. Great program but...the license expires as soon as you reboot.
,Kintak,2007-11-13T09:58Z,"Completely useless. The license isn't accepted.
Why isn't there a group working on a patcher for this? I'm sure it would be quite easy to do. There was an old one, but they added in a function that detects ""corruption"" of the program files. All the new patcher would have to do is disable that function."
,rcdail,2007-11-23T19:56Z,"Program installs fine.  But when I try to load the text file for the license, it says the certificate is invalid.  So it will only run for 30 days.  How do you get around this?"
,_zener_,2007-11-28T14:31Z,"license not valid. tried to uninstall and remove stuff with ccleaner, and install again with blocking in firewall, but it did not work anyway"
,eusuntsiva,2008-02-04T18:09Z,Well now it dose not work ....
