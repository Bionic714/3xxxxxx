,railrock,2007-09-19T00:43Z,thank you very much! I can not find it even in edonkey. Please keep seeding!
,ptfg,2007-09-19T01:17Z,"railrock - You're very welcome!
I know that it's nowhere to be found, that's why I bought the DVDs, that's why I decided to share it, I had been looking and searching everywhere.
I will seed for as long as it needs to be, hopefully others will do the same, in about a week I will release the rest."
,starca,2007-09-21T13:17Z,"Thank you very much for this fantastic show!
Can you seed 09, 21 and 22 episode from Season 03? I didnt came to leech only this episodes from season 03.
Best regards from

I am glad you enjoy NYPD Blue, me too!
I am re-seeding Season 3 episode 9, 21 and 22 for you. Enjoy! 
By the way, in the U.S.A. Turner network (TNT) is showing the COMPLETE NYPD Blue series again.Right now they are broadcasting Season 1 and 2, it will be quite a while before they get to 5, 6, 7 etc. We must all be patient, but looks like we're in luck to get 'em all! (:-))-

,starca,2007-09-21T23:50Z,"Thank you for seeding this episodes!!!
I got 9 and curently leeching 21 but it seems that I got the problem with 22! I already got 84% from this torrent NYPD_Blue_SE03E22_He's.Not.Guilty-He's.My.Brother_DVDrip_by.PeaTea_Engl.avi
and I only see 5 leechers. Did I must start again from this torrent 	NYPD_Blue_SE03E22_He's.Not.Guilty,He's.My.Brother_DVDrip_by.Pe???
Best Regards from

,ptfg,2007-09-22T11:42Z,"starca -
Try: NYPD_Blue_SE03E22_He's.Not.Guilty,He's.My.Brother_DVDrip_by.PeaTea_Engl.avi
(the one with the comma (,).
That should work, the other one (-) was my mistake!
Hope it works for you, I see seeders at 9,21 and 22.
Have a nice weekend!
