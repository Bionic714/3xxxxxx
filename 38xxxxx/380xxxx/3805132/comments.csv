[V],Subzero!,2007-09-14T01:32Z,Looks like there is a REAL FiX from Dope out!
,=Post@L=,2007-09-14T11:33Z,"@subzero

Yes he posted a fix finally after I had said for months there was a problem with it. I posted this first he got pissed about it because it wasnt tested and he made a fix himself. 
But he only posted the 6 missing animations from the gamemovie directory. There 's still more missing like a lot of intro/outro movies , animations of waves in the sea. If you download this and overwrite the gamemovie directory you got all the movies/animations blablabla because this is from the original disks. 

Anyway you decide what to download.. better just download the iso disks."
,chipsahoy669,2007-09-14T17:55Z,this game is old and no one cares. save it uploader. you are much to concerned.
