The Hidden and Dangerous 2: sabre squadron dopeman rip wasnt complete. Some animations were missing, like the blood animation in first person view, which shows up when you get hit in the original version. In dopemans version, when getting hit in first person, you get a binocular overlay bug because of the missing animation files. 
I made a torrent of the whole /gamemovie directory from the original hidden and dangerous2+sabre squadron. This directory includes all the missing animations and some other movies which were left out in dopemans version.(mostly intros and outros). When you downloaded this torrent replace the 
<path>Illusion SoftworksHidden & Dangerous 2Gamemovie directory with my Gamemovie directory. If windows asks to replace a file click 'yes to all'. 
I hope this works out for you because I didnt test it. If not.. I will make a complete rip of the hd2 disks. First try this.. because its a smaller download.

any questions leave a message in the comments.

have a nice day,
Chris
