what a waste of upload."
,DizziWizzy,2007-09-14T19:51Z,"LOL!!!!

Lameass, first of all...the torrent you recommended doesn't seem to popular if I look at the comments. :p

The second, sure I screwed up. I actually searched for this torrent before I uploaded, but didn't get any hits. I don't know how ""picky"" this search engine is when it comes to ""dots"" and ""undersores"" etc...

And this isn't fake I've played it myself. I've got better things to do than seeding fakes. 
So pls, go fu*k yourself..."
,Splitti,2007-09-17T07:41Z,"How do i install it.

,b_gyeti,2007-11-27T17:54Z,"Not work!!!
Nice job!!!"
,DANZ1G,2007-12-12T17:43Z,"It SEEMS like it COULD work... but WINRAR doesn't work with it, so I used 7zip and extracted a file... but it seems that I couldn't mount the image, nor could I expore it.

So... Dizzi, can you PLEASE explain how to extract these files? You spent so much time uploading this, you should at least explain.  This is not a typical extraction like just about EVERY other file on this site.

I don't suggest anyone download this unless you want to waste time and space on your Hard drive.

Wait for Dizzi to explain, or avoid this torrent."
,RaZorLeaf,2008-01-17T14:01Z,OMg the game is an epic failure
,lothainroxos,2008-02-14T03:46Z,"had the game for xbox, it was cool for like ten minutes, then extremely monotonous. DIABLO RULES!!!"
,kallegurka,2008-02-24T03:16Z,what is the serial key?...when i start the game it says i nedd it

,genestarwind2007,2008-06-14T06:44Z,Wow you guy really need to learn how to use winrar. It is NOT empty space. All you have to do is right click on the first file and hit properties. Then choose open with program and select winrar. Then open with winrar....Then extract...Then mount...install...etc
,1124,2008-07-30T00:03Z,is it really being tracked or is it a lode of horse crap
,Stamik,2008-08-03T20:23Z,How do I install?
,tr3v0r,2008-09-01T20:17Z,"This is, in fact, all blank space. Complete waste of a download. I don't think it was ""corrupted"" in transit, it's actually just loads and loads of blank data. Corrupted data looks different.

Don't waste your time with this distro."
,Ifrit13,2008-09-15T16:08Z,why the fuck would some one post 7GB of nothing? Fuck yopu for wasting my time. i hope you die of cancer.

,FamouSaint,2009-10-25T02:32Z,"Basically, This download sucks."
,MintySurpriseOYA,2009-12-18T11:56Z,"This can be downloaded, installed and patched but still doesn't work. Works up until the menu where you enter your name and then it shouts out a fat turd that says NOPE!

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

P.S. The majority of Razor 1911 files do not work so go with dopeman or reloaded. Much better choices"
,XxPlOsIvExX187,2010-01-31T03:23Z,two worlds is 3 gigs not 7.
