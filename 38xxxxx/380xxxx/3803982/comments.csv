,teetee,2007-09-12T10:01Z,What is this? On Nero homepage says Nero 8 is to be released during first week of October 2007!
,BoRock2,2007-09-12T10:22Z,"Yeah: What is this....My Nero 7 ultra says there is NO updates.

AND:  NERO SUCKS...I can`t see the point ?

Im into  DVDFab Platinum !"
,Darndare,2007-09-12T10:27Z,"From 7 to 8 is no ""update"", it's probably a ""buy a new"".
TeeTee. I guess you are new at this? Most software is found here before you can buy it. Photoshop CS3 is but one other example."

,monsterone,2007-11-07T20:15Z,"You don't need to get your firewall to block nero accessing the net to get round the activation thing.
Goto 
C:\Program Files/CommonFiles/Nero/Shared/NL3- 

Delete NeroPatentActivation.exe file."
