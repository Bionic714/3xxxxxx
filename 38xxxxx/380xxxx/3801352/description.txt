VA-OST-Can't Stop The Music (1980)

A kitsch classic. 

Possibly one of the worst films ever made. Producer Alan Carr, who had had two blockbusters with Saturday Night Fever and Grease, invested soul and credibility in this pseudo story of the birth of disco group Village People. 

Winner of the Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay at the 1980 Golden Raspberry Awards, and nominations in Worst Actor, Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actress and Worst Director.

Starring American Olympic Gold Medal Winner in Decathlon, Bruce Jenner, Steve Guttenberg Valerie Perrine and The Village People as themselves.

Soundtrack includes songs by the Village People, The Ritchie Family and David London.
