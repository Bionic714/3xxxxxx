Wedding Toasts and Speeches

The wedding toast - that poignantly tender gesture proposed to the newlyweds, a mysterious melding of poetry, quotations, prayer, wit, anecdote, and heart-rendered sentiment. Why so mysterious? Because the wedding toast has evolved through the years from a simple TO YOUR HEALTH AND HAPPINESS to a soliloquy that requires personalization, preparation, practice and presentation.

Here is a collection of three books dedicated to wedding toasts and speeches. An indispensable tool for the groom, best man, fathers√¢?? of the bride and groom and the bride.

1. Complete Book of Wedding Toasts By Diane Warner
2. Wedding Speeches and Toasts by Angela Lansbury
3. Wedding Toasts Finding the Perfect Words by Jo Packham

The scan quality is fair. All I did was cut the spine off the books, and then ran them through the office PDF maker. Every page is perfectly legible, just not professional quality. I scanned the front & back covers with a conventional scanner, for better quality.

Once your wedding is over, please post your thoughts and how well a particular speech worked for you.
