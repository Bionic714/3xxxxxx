                                   Presents


Happy Returns:

Rodney's in love with Debbie from the newsagents. Could this mean the end of his dirty magazine fetish? Trouble is, she's only 19 and 19.5 years ago Del was pretty friendly with her mum June.

Strained Relations:

Grandads funeral brings relations from as far as North London, including Uncle Albert who's intentions leave Del feeling 'like a turkey who's caught Bernard Matthews grinning at him'

Hole In One:

Rodney's non-too-shrewd investment in suntan oil during 'the worst winter in two million years' demands emergency measures and Uncle Albert decides its time to display his only talent - that of falling down holes without any real injury.

It's Only Rock N Roll:

Instead of the Albert 'all, Rodneys pop group were heading for 'sod all' until Del discovered their commercial potential. As usual, it doesn't quite work out like they'd like.

Sleeping Dogs Lie:

Del is onto a great new money making scheme - looking after Marlene and Boycies new puppy Duke for a steal at Â£60 a week should be a doddle.... a bit of the old pedigree chum and they should be away. Then Duke falls victum to salamonella poisoning.

Watching The Girls Go By:

Rodders is desperate to find a woman for a party at the Nags Head. Nothing new? This time he's got a bet on with Mickey and Del's gonna make sure he wins..

As One Door Closes:

When the bottom falls out of the louvre doors, times get hard for the Trotters. But nature will find a way as Del and Rodders go butterfly collecting.


Enjoy!
