,heddes,2007-10-25T20:03Z,how does this work i've tried winzip & winrar but it won't work
,tkingstl,2008-01-05T17:37Z,"Here's what I did to get this game to work:

1. Rename the file rzr-toc.001 to rzr-toc.r01 and extract it with winrar.

2. You will be prompted with a pop-up box asking you to locate the .r02 file. Change that file extension to .002 and winrar will proceed to build   a bin annd cue file.

3 From there I used Magic ISO to build the ISO file from the bin and cue files.

4. When yopu extract or mount the ISO file there is a setup.exe in the root directory. Run this first (it will take a while to install)

5. After it installs there is another setup file in the DX9 folder. You MUST run and install this for the game to work.

I followed the above steps and everything works fine. I am loving this game."

,TheLunchLady,2008-02-15T00:27Z,"I get sound but no video when trying to start 07 and 08 of WSOP. I called activision they said the game has issues with ATI X series cards. Why on earth wouldnt they test out those cards before publishing the game. Those are popular cards. Anywho activision told me to just install the gfx drivers and not the catalyst. I tried that and still the same problem. So I tried that on my media center pc and that seemed to work. I was able to play the game for a day, Now the game just gives me the blue screen of death about 1 minute into the game. Anyone figure out a way to get this to work?"
