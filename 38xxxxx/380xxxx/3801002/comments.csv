,pimpernell,2007-09-09T14:53Z,"THIS IS A FAKE. 

It's pure bullshit. The songs are just looped in the 1. verse. "
,hellogello,2007-09-09T16:05Z,"AAAAAAAGH! I've been longing for this album since I don't know when! And when I finally find it, it's a fake! God damnit faab21, why the heck do you upload something like that?! CRAP!

Don't download this people. It's only the first verse that they repeat in every single song. From the very start to the bitter end."

,dearsina,2007-09-10T19:36Z,"A fake, but someone has really gone to town to make this fake.

I suspect it's the work of the record label, trying to dissuade people from pirating the album. They are bigger idiots than I thought.

Dear Mr Record Label Sir, You cannot stop piracy. Ever. Now stop wasting your time with these silly fakes."
,esun,2007-09-11T01:33Z,Thank you Mr. Record Company.  I see what you did there.
