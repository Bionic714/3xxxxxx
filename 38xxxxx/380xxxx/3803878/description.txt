PLOT:

Legend of the demon womb continues with our hero Amano's quest to 

seek out the super fiend, Chojin. The rather shy Nagumo, a high 

school student, has already been experiencing some twists in his 

personality, but can this clumsy kid be the Chojin? Why is his good 

friend Takeaki, also his cousin, acting so strangely since his blood 

transfusion? Will Myunhi suceed in his evil manipulation of Takeaki? 

Will the three worlds ever be united into the Lands Of Eternity?
