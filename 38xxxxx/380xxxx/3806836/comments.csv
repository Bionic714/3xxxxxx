,smeegley,2008-01-15T09:15Z,great video quality as it is a dvd rip but the video was remixed or spliced.  you'll be watching them perform one song then all of a sudden out of nowhere something else pops up. it's like someone was recording and turned the channel then turned it back.  it's happening through the video.  which sucks because it is dvd quality.  it just would have been nice if it wasn't peppered with channel switching effects in the middle of folks holding the groove.
