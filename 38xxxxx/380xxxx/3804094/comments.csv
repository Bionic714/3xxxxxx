However, they are not .mp3s; I can't get them to play.

Maybe someone else will have better luck."

,swedanX,2007-09-12T13:13Z,"The files is pictures. .jpg. All pictures looks the same, but with different sizes. Guess it is mp3s hidden in the jpgs. Have seen software that can do that..... Anyone that can extract the mp3s?"

there's a new version of this, i know i guy in USA that has it so it has leaked.. just that this torrent seems to be fucked up..

i just got a conspiracy theory.. i went to isohunt and found it like an hour ago maybe.. started download, while i was downloading i went to piratebay to check it out there and it was the same.. so i read some comments and they all said it was fake and this and that and that you couldn't open the files.. only in paint.. so when i got it i tried VLC, Itunes, windows media player and winamp but nothing worked so i opened it paint and yeah there it was.. a big ass pic of a cave/mine or something.. you know dave wrote a song about some guys that were trapped in a mine for days(weeks) anyway.. so i think it's the record company that leaked this fake version.."
