 now when it comes down to heros,smallville, dexter ect, when im Dl them i always release my upload linit to unlocked and fully open, now why cant you the users be the same as we are all trying to get this, other wise i will join the masses and limit the up load to 1kbs as no one else gives a rats arse.
