Gaels vs. Ghosts in the Clocktower, the 5th release from net label Wounds of the Earth, is a colossal journey through waves of terrestrial post-rock into outer reaches of the cosmos. Gaels brings his trademark thickly atmospheric mixture of post-rock and ambient which flows seemlessly into Ghosts in the Clocktower's dark layers of field samples take from the outer corners of our universe. A must have for fans of progressive and melodic ambient!
