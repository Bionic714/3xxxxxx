Right Click>Properties>Compatibility>Run in compatibility mode for XP Service Pack 2
It won't crash when you change the icons if you do this"

 Im running XP Pro sp 2 so what fluxer said wont help me."
,lazy_prodigy,2007-11-11T20:11Z,The crack works on XP Pro SP2.  Execute the crack and if it is not in the same folder as the install directory then it will ask to search for it.  Locate IconExplorer.exe and the patch will work.  Don't need to restart.
