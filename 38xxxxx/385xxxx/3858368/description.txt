Episode 10: Rescuing the chapel from the rescue

At the last show I made two blunders. I used an untested encoding and killed the sound for a lot of you and I used a layer mask with a lot of gray in it where it didn?t belong. So the sea didn?t look good.

In this episode I correct that mistake and add a bit of burning and dodging to get parts of the image darker or lighter. I don?t use the burn and dodge tool but use again a layer for better control. A bonus tip for the readers of the blog: If you set the foreground colour at start to medium gray and select then ?foreground colour? as the layermask, you get around the step of filling the mask.
