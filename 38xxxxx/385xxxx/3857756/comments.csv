I CAN play skirmish, though, but not with Japan, India or China and when I do, the .xs file for the computers AI is missing. I tried to download some guys fix for this but it didn't help anything what so ever."

@ quadrapop: that's all well and good im sure MagicISO will work in order to burn the iso but that is provided dat u can extract the iso which you cannot do because the three files (024 028 and 047) all report CRC errors

,Xafke,2007-11-07T17:47Z,"@rickardberg

It's not a VLC file!
Open it with Magic ISO, you can download it! Google it!"
,madshredder,2007-11-21T03:11Z,To install the game download a file called extract now by googling it (it's completely free unlike magiciso.)  Open up extractnow.  After that go to the folder with the downloaded files from the torrent and select all the files in the folder and click and drag them into the extractnow box that opened up.  Then click extract.  It should make a new folder inside the asian dynasties folder you downloaded.  Download the daemon tools program and install it.  I had to download it from a differant site then the official one becuase it kept restarting my computer and never installed.
,madshredder,2007-11-21T03:11Z,"It should only make you restart once in the middle of the installation.  After you got it installed right click on it and choose the virtual cd/dvd rom drive option then choose choose the device there (it should say no media.)  Choose that drive then choose mount image.  An explorer window should pop up.  In it go find your asian dynasties downloaded folder and choose the new folder ""extractnow"" created in it.  There should be a file in it named ""flt-aoey.cue"" in it."
,madshredder,2007-11-21T03:12Z,"It should only make you restart once in the middle of the installation.

,madshredder,2007-11-21T03:14Z,"Double click it and wait untill the asian dynasties window pops up asking you to install the game.  Install it and then play.  If you need a crack go to ""http://www.gameburnworld.com"" and search asian dynasties then download the crack for the version of the game you have.  The one you downloaded is the very first set incase there are updates in the future.  To use the crack download it then take the file from the thing you extracted and rename it something differant like ""Age of Empires 3 Asian Dynasties"" then copy and paste it to the folder with the asian dynasties game in it.  The default is ""C/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires III.""  Double click on the file you pasted and the game should start up.  Hope this helped:)"
,madshredder,2007-11-21T03:15Z,My bad please ignore the third coment I posted about installing the game.  I accidently repeated the same thing.
,madshredder,2007-11-21T03:18Z,"Also if anyone could help me out on this problem.  I installed the game just the way I posted but the only problem I had was the Warchiefs expansion doesnt work with it.  Example, I can't play as native CIVS in asian dynasties and I can't play as Asian CIVS in War Chiefs."
,Mazen,2008-01-26T21:23Z,"Hey mate! Were stuck at 82,7% could you please seed it out? :)"

,Tiwo,2008-05-17T22:06Z,"Could someone please help me? I've installed the game and it launches and everything. The sound works on the stuff before you get to the main menu, But the it doesn't work. Also i'm having problem playing it, sometimes when i play it the menu thing dones't appear and i can't do anything. So eh..Anyone got any idea where i screwed it up?"
,vampire15g,2008-10-03T22:13Z,"is there anyone know how to us this game???
i just download it and all of them file formats are flt-aoey."
,Fortune8,2008-11-02T08:46Z,"Love this torrent.
Got 200kb/s atm! Also first time ever I have got a green tick at the bottom of the screen in UTorrent!
Cheers for seeding."
,Fortune8,2008-11-03T20:05Z,"Great download speeds but a bit confused with installing properly.
I extract using WinRar and mounted using PowerIso and from that i ran the install. I entered the product key - cheers - and it proceded to install. It completed and that was that. I then went to the folders in the extract adn found under Fairlight folder the age3y.exe and copied it. I then went to program files and pasted it OVER the other age3y.exe. It was a slightly bigger file. I then tried to run age3y.exe and my comp totally froze. CPU was maxed out. HELP!!! How do i now play it?????? "
,UnknownAlly,2008-12-16T18:13Z,"It says that ""flt-aeoy.020"" and ""flt-aeoy.047"" are corrupt. I'm trying to re-download only those specific files but no seeds.

Can't extract AEO3 Asian Dynasties because of this."
,UnknownAlly,2008-12-16T18:19Z,Re-downloading alt-aoey.020 and alt-aoey.047 right now.
,UnknownAlly,2008-12-17T11:06Z,"After having to re-download 2 files "".020"" and "".047,"" I needed Daemon Tools.

I mounted the image and Asian Dynasties popped up. I clicked install and got this error:
""1670: Unable to load module F:\ISSetup.dll Error Code: 999.""
Can someone help?"
,UnknownAlly,2008-12-17T12:13Z,"I re-downloaded ISSetup.dll from another torrent. Success.

It was installing but I got an error which said ""YPack_~1.cab"" was invalid or corrupt.

Can someone help? Re-downloading is not an option because it is a 550MB file!"
,UnknownAlly,2008-12-17T12:15Z,"Do not waste your time downloading this. It is crap.

So many corrupt files and when you re-download it, you end up needing to re-download another 550MB!!!"
,UnknownAlly,2008-12-20T02:39Z,"Okay I got it to work,
but I had to re-download some files. I also had to make a whole new image file because the other one (aoey.cue) was corrupt.

Does anyone know if there is a keygen that can generate never before used serial numbers? I want to play this online but the serial provided is already in use."
,UnknownAlly,2008-12-20T02:42Z,"If anyone wants this on CD,
email me at dreamcars69@hotmail.com

Downloading this will just give you a whole bunch of corrupt files. I fixed all that."
,Agamenox,2010-08-26T15:59Z,"Excelent Torrent, I download now, and work perfectly. Only I run 7zip in manual mode to uncompress. The Torrent is OK and Works! "
