Thanks to a lot of people in the forums and IRC that made this happen! This is a guide to help you all in getting your Leopard Unpatched DVD to run on your hack.

First, I just want to let you know that depending on your configuration, you may need some files that are not included here (meaning, kexts). But I will try to help the best I can to get you going. Don???t give up!
