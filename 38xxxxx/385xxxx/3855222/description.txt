Notes: This is the complete I&I performance featuring Blind Melon on DVD. Also included is a packed extras menu including Galaxie from David Letterman 1995-09-21, Shannon & Rogers hosting MTV Beach House 1995... Joey Ramone even shows up (??!!), a few acoustic demos plus several radio appearances & live tracks including a rare performance from 1993-03-25 at The Wetlands club, NYC (mislabeled on the DVD as being from 1992). Artwork included.

Source: I&I was transferred from a first generation tape. Excellent audio and video from VHS source.

Video: The video after it was digitally transferred was ran though a light video filter to any remove VHS noise. A small amount of color correction implemented to bring out the color. The video was remastered into 16X9 ratio. DVD video was encoded in a VBR format with min=2000 avg=4500 max=8000. Because of a video blemish at the bottom of the screen, the video was cropped to a 16X9 ratio "Widescreen" to hide the video glitch. Other than the hidden glitch I&I is in perfect condition. NTSC.

Audio: The audio was digitally restored to remove any broadcast noise. The audio was also raised by 8db to add more punch. The DVD contains both Dolby Digital 2.0 (stereo) and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The 5.1 track has been completely remastered to give the best spatial sound possible. *Please note the extras are in Dolby Digital 2.0 only* The 5.1 mix is for the main feature only. Only use the 5.1 audio option if you have a 5.1 setup. Otherwise choose the DD 2.0 option. The default sound stream is DD 2.0
