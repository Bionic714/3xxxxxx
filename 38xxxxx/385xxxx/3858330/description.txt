Meet the Gimp! is a weekly videopodcast about the Gimp graphics software from the view of a digital photographer. 

In this first episode I show how to get an image ready for the web.

In a quick tour I cover rotating, cropping, pushing the colours, downscaling and sharpening to show a bit what the GIMP can do.
