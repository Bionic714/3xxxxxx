the image file wont work in nero??"
,pelle987,2007-10-24T14:55Z,"I suspect the ""imagefile"" is actually a cue file. 

Download the freeware Cue Splitter and use that to split the cd into tracks which u then burn as a usual audio cd."
,pelle987,2007-10-24T14:57Z,"no sorry... my bad... i didn realise u must have meant the rar file... or did u?

however... u'll need Winrar or similar to unpack the rar file... then u can burn it :)"
