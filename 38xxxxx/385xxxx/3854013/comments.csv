,Hegetin,2007-10-23T20:53Z,c卒mon ! more seeding please !
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-23T21:20Z,"2Hegetin: Im seeding as much as i possible can but there is a leecher who's 15% ahead(I have blocked him so you other people will caught up soon). Please don't complain that the seeding is slow im doing all i can to get it out fast and i have a slow connection and little access to my computer. Nobody is forcing you to download now you can wait until more people have it and can seed faster. 
SO Please NO Bitching!!!

2Podin&gumsel: You guys are very Welcome! Im glad you enjoy my uploads! "
,korksi,2007-10-23T22:25Z,uioplkjhbnmm; write me to: skyline.dot@gmail.com for 端bermovie link... thanx 4 this
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-23T23:04Z,"2korksi; Before i send you an email i want to know some more about this link.
This is nothing personal against you i just don't wanna take any unnecessary risks. To me a risk is anything even like sending an email.
I hope you can understand this and will not take any offense because of my actions.
trust me i want the movie.
If you could just tell me some more about this link like where you found it what way to download and just plain info that would be great and if not than thats no problem and thanks anyway. 
By the way i will post a message here before i send you an email so if you get any emails from somebody claiming to be me and you see no post here its not me!
You are welcome!
once again i hope you understand why i do this  just wanna be safe."
