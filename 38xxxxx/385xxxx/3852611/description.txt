Two songs from the the Gentle Giant "Giant on the Box" DVD

These songs are from German TV 1974.
Gentle Giant aren't the most accessible music. The have been called the Kings of Quirk, and the genre is prog rock, art rock or, in the case of GG, baroque-and-roll. I just call it awesome!

Special attention is to be paid to John Weathers, hard hitting drummer extraordinaire.
