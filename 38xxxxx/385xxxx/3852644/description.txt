Anti-Guru UG Krishnamurti - The Stranglehold of Thought

To read U.G. is to be introduced to a "spiritual terrorist": he overturns all of our accepted beliefs -- God, mind, soul, enlightenment, religion, humanity, heart, love, relationships -- and gives us a totally different picture of who we are. The result is a grenade in the brain. 

People who come across this odd little man are indelibly marked by a strange and lasting impression that each one finds difficult to define. People report that they are either deeply shaken or overtaken by curiosity after a few minutes talking with him. He doesn't offer hope, love, peace or spiritual salvation. On the contrary, his words are rather deflating. He discourages people from coming to see him and most often politely turns them away. 

Never has a `philosopher' become so famous while emphatically denying that he even has a philosophy. Yet, what makes a man who so avidly shuns publicity so talked about? How does one who never gives a public lecture get such a following? How does a "guru" with no organization get such media attention? U.G. is India's most controversial teacher and categorizing him is extremely difficult. He has been called "the anti-guru", "the un-guru", the "seer with no solutions", "the raging sage", "the thinker who shuns thought" and "the anti-Krishnamurti", referring to his namesake, J. Krishnamurti, U.G.'s better known contemporary with whom he shares no family tie.
