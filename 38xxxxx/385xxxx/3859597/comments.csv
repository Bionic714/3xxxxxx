,rickstar,2007-10-26T22:26Z,"is this the one that is only available from Wal-Mart? and now all the hippy fans are crying foul because the Eagles are such tree huggers? In fact is this the one that glen frye had to have a press conference to say that all is well and now he has the ear of the CEO of W-M and all will be well in Corporate rripoff Americal now?

thank u for not letting us give  that scum sucking corporation more money to ruin the enviornment and support child labour"

,Mikey90sg,2007-11-04T19:19Z,"BigDickBubba: Do you even know what Anarchy is?  You are a moron if you think it would possibly work.  When you get out of your teen angst years you will understand, dont worry...."
,Righteous_Jude_of_CA,2007-11-21T13:29Z,"If you want this CD in better quality as 320kbps LAME MP3 or as WAV files, check this Pirate Bay Tracker link: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3902489/Eagles_-_Long_Road_Out_Of_Eden_-_Entire_Album_(2CD__s)_-_A :)"
,AngelGrrl,2007-11-23T09:57Z,"This torrent has bad files in it, they will skip when you play them. Probably a bad rip. Look elsewhere."
,DeutscherAmerikaner,2007-11-23T17:45Z,There is a *much* better torrent for this Eagles CD with no problems of any kind. Much better sound quality too. Here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/user/Righteous_Jude_of_CA/
