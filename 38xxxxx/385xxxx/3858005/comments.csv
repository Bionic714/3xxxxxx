Btw you got to make a release of the witcher, the one that came out was a total bullcrap, seems that no one has got it working, including me."

Lets hope that dopeman saves the day :P"

,MikLarh,2007-11-02T12:59Z,"Hey dopeman. 

This comment actually hasn´t got anything to do with this torrent. But i haven´t been able to find an answer for my question in any of the comments concerning my problem. 

I reasently downloaded splinter cell pandora tomorrow rip made by you. But i can´t get i to work. when i start det single player game and choose a profile everything works, but then the game starts to load and exits without any messaging to inform me why.

Please help if you can. I´m really fucked here.

Thanks 
MikLarh"

It's really fucked that people like you feel the need to contribute your stupidity to a community like this. What makes you think that anybody is interested in the moronic dribble that you post? Nobody cares about your opinion. Go and kill yourself. I sincerely hope that your most loved family member gets cancer and dies horribly very soon."
,axy_david,2008-12-07T12:27Z,"tredixert and all the others

,KevMovieMan,2009-04-14T17:50Z,"The Game Works! If you have the problem with Alyx in the elevator there is a fix, unrar the SAVE File and load that and it will work. No there isn't a DOPEMAN release for HLE 1, the game rocks by the way.... BRING ON HLE 3!"
,faraza,2009-06-29T12:18Z,Tell me some names of good First-Person Shooter games. Write names as comment. I will read after sometime.
,Diceman_,2009-12-27T07:41Z,"I just discovered another fix, grab stuff with the gravity gun while Magnusson is talking and fire it at the elavator, I had a chair, bucket and box that made Alyx stuggle to get to the button and voila, she pushed it and walked away instead of standing there like a mope."
,qayum1616,2011-01-31T10:23Z,"You are the best dopeman thanx for the fix!!!!!
