,FooSnik,2008-01-31T03:40Z,"Thanks a lot for this!  I had some early DJ Premier mix tapes from the late late 80's, early 90's that I got from Tape Kingz and they were the best hip hop tapes I have ever had and probably ever will have.   I lost them and have been trying to get them again ever since.  I hope maybe one of them is here.  Thanks again, bro!"
