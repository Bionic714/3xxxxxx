BADBUSTER - RELEASED 15/10-07


IE plug-in that tags up companies with an environmental score as you surf the web
**********************************************************************************


WHY GET THIS POWER?
Companies paint their own picture of how environmentally friendly they are. There's no simple way for consumers to see how serious companies are about cutting their negative impact on the environment. BadBuster will change this by compiling published environmental ratings of the companies and deliver them straight into web browsers.  

 


Companies' environmental aspects should be a big part of who they are. Companies may say the environment is a big deal and buy lots of green-looking ads, but until now it's been tough to see who walks the walk.


Try it and "FEEL THE FORCE SURROUND YOU!"
