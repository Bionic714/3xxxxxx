Collection of medical books in Palm reader (".pdb") format.

This is a "repackaging" of another torrent, "Medical Library" found on Mininova, organized to allow the leacher to choose individual documents, and with some standardization of document names.  Most of these books are quite advanced and are not likely of interest to the reader with only a casual interest in medical science.

This torrent contains one version of each of the titles of the original torrent, as well as the reader software.
