what we need is a vista compatible ollydebug.exe and so far I have been unable to get this to work on vista32. any ideas guys?"
,lasorus,2008-10-22T21:00Z,"I got this working on vista 64 bit home premium. I had to use an xp system however to get the key.  First I changed the computer name and user name on the xp sytem to match that of the vista system.  I then ran ollydebug on the xp sytem and wrote down the key. I then ran the install program by itself on the vista system, entered the key and voila!"
