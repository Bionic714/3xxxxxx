This is a Nero formatted archive with the hfs forks intact.  If you are on a Mac and need this, put it on a USB stick, walk over to a PC with Nero, and burn it to a CD.  Then put the CD in your mac.  Voila.

I created this torrent mainly for people attempting to run Mac emulation, but unable to find the operating system they were looking for.

I plan to upload some rom images and pre rolled virtual macs for running on PC's.
