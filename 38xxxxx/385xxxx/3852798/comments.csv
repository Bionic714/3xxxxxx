,nordin,2007-12-19T08:39Z,det er ikke noe password bare hente det 책 brenne det med nero det funker som fan
,dechamp,2009-01-29T10:12Z,"mondocain... you are an idiot. These files are 320kps mp3's, and are not in a copy protected wrapper. They work fine.

There is also cover art and the files are properly ID3 tagged."
