,tallviking,2007-10-22T06:37Z,What year is this ? 2007 ?
,SS_Camaro,2007-10-22T15:17Z,2006.  The new update (7.1) will come out in November.  Someone PLEASE seed this...we're stuck at 96%
,ScotchMode,2007-10-22T16:19Z,"This was seeded to 100% for a few people, but once they hit 100% they bailed.  Once you complete your download, seed so others can get a full download.

If anyone has 7.1 for Gen 3, please upload that as well."
,SS_Camaro,2007-10-22T18:14Z,"I'll seed it.  I appreciate it, dude!  I don't think that the 7.1 has been released yet, but I'll definately be looking."
,SS_Camaro,2007-10-22T18:15Z,"Do you HAVE to use a DVD+R DL?  I mean, it will fit on a 4.7 DVD..."
,vyessaie,2007-10-22T18:34Z,I will seed this for a few days. Has anyone burned this successfully?
,vyessaie,2007-10-22T18:37Z,I just extracted...it says Gen 5.....
,ScotchMode,2007-10-22T18:57Z,"It extracts as ""Toyota Navigation DVD Gen 5 v6.1 464210-0750.iso"" but it is for a Gen 3 unit.

The original torrent ""Toyota Navigation DVD Gen 5 v6 1 464210-0750 7z"" was mislabeled as Gen 5 and is about 6 months old.  Since it was named wrong, nobody checked it.

The 7z file was just renamed correctly and uploaded so it would be found.

What you need to look at is the part number.

btw:  7.1 for Gen3 is released just not out as a torrent.. 
part # 86271-33036  not sure about the 464271-xxxx number.

BTW: I've tried burning to a Memorex DVD+R DL as suggested on Toyota and Lexus sites.  It reads ok but if I search for an address or POI, I get read errors.  Next thing is to try Verbatim media.

Please report any successful burns and include media type and recording method.. ImgBurn, DAO, Incremental, speed etc.."
,ScotchMode,2007-10-22T18:59Z,BTW: it's a 7z file which needs 7zip to extract.  The resulting ISO is about 8 gigs so it definitely needs a DVD+R DL.
,SS_Camaro,2007-10-22T19:06Z,"Gotcha!  Thanks for all the help, ScotchMode!  I'll let you know how it turns out.  I'm not at home right now, but I *think* I have Verbatim brand +R DL discs."
,vyessaie,2007-10-22T19:09Z,Thanks for the advice Scotch!!!
,SS_Camaro,2007-10-23T03:15Z,"I can't get it to work.  I've tried burning it on a Memorex DVD+R DL, and the HP variant.  Neither works.  Anyone have any ideas/success?  I'm trying it in a 2002 Lexus ES300/ Gen 2 Nav."
,SS_Camaro,2007-10-23T03:16Z,"ScotchMode, what Lexus/Toyota sites are you using?  "
,ScotchMode,2007-10-23T19:22Z,"I have a Gen3 unit.  I've searched several sites..   google for ""toyota nav backup dvd"" and you'll find a lot of information. unfortunately, there are several different ways that ""seemed"" to work, but the consistent method is to burn it at slowest speed using ImgBurn and bookmark it to DVD-ROM. Most people having luck are using Verbatim discs."
,ScotchMode,2007-10-24T02:45Z,Anyone have luck with this?
,SS_Camaro,2007-10-24T14:59Z,"No, still no luck, but I haven't tried Verbatim discs. Three failures so far."
,ScotchMode,2007-10-28T06:01Z,Anyone have any luck yet?
,SS_Camaro,2007-10-28T14:18Z,I'm gonna try it one more time as soon as I can find some Verbatim discs.  I've also seen somewhere that you have to change the booktype to DVD-ROM to fool the nav into thinking that the disc is the original. 
,ScotchMode,2007-10-28T15:54Z,"There have been consistent leechers for almost a week.
I'd like to hear form other people as well."
,ScotchMode,2007-10-28T17:14Z,"Great news..  How did you do it?
Software..ie: ImgBurn.. 
Media..ie:  Verbatim DVD+R DL
Any special methods?  DAO, incremental..
etc?"
,ScotchMode,2007-10-29T22:47Z,Success with Verbatim DVD+R DL
,chithom,2007-10-30T05:00Z,"Scotchmode, great news but what mode/method, software??? please, I've fried about 5  disc's already and the nav drive (2001 LS 430) cannot recognize the disc's at all. Suggestions please . . ."
,ScotchMode,2007-10-30T17:04Z,"K3B - Linux  (ImgBurn should work well also)
DAO (disc-at-once)
Verbatim DVD+R DL
2.4x"
,chithom,2007-10-31T03:53Z,"Well . . . it almost worked . . . the drive recognized the disc then updated the system then ceased working and now comes up as 'no disc recognized'. Used ImgBurn w/ DAO Verbatim DVD+R DL 2.4x, any other ideas/opinions."
,rvdsabu,2007-11-01T00:44Z,"OMG Scotchmode you are the beeeeeeeeeeeest! i was about to drop $250 at the dealership for this disc. I used an office depot brand dual layer which has the ritek D01 media code and it worked PERFECTLY in a 2002 camry. I cannot thank you enough!!!!!!!! WOW you just saved me a ton of money. P.S. version 7 is out now, maybe itll show up soon to download. "
,ScotchMode,2007-11-05T04:31Z,"As I posted earlier, I simply repackaged this torrent with the correct name.  The original was named incorrectly and for the most part ignored.

Now let's see 7.1 for the Gen 3 :-)

Part #s are:
86271-33036
464210-0930"
,kezami,2007-11-07T05:06Z,Works great with Verbatim DVD+R DL - only problem is I get a disc read error when I try address mode in Canada and some US regions too.  Anyone get address search to work properly?
,ronchem,2007-11-23T22:24Z,"Works GREAT! Thanks ScotchMode!!!

,ronchem,2007-11-23T22:26Z,"BTW: I seeded 375%  - share the 1's & 0's
cheers."

Peace out."
,aggierob,2007-12-06T18:22Z,"I'm having problems burning the DVDs. I'm using ImgBurn, Verbatim DVD+R DL media, and the Ver4 ISO image. Can I get some help from you ScotchMode? I'm not sure how to PM on this site... should I just leave my email addy?"
,aggierob,2007-12-07T16:16Z,"I just tried with another disc brand (Memorex) just to see if that would help, but I get the same error. The Nav system starts to read it, then gives me ""Unable to read DVD. Check to see if disc is damaged or dirty."" Ugh!"
,babylonboots,2007-12-08T00:46Z,"Anyone get this to work for an 01 LX470?  I tried Verbatim, HP, Memorex with no luck.  DVD looks as if it will read, but it doesn't.  I'm using version 1 of the DVD Nav program.  I wonder if I have to upgrade the software with another version prior to loading this one.  "
,Esch,2007-12-21T17:05Z,"Having trouble with burn.  2 failures...disk read error when booting up system.  Using verbatim +R DL, DAO, 2.4X, Book Type:DVD-ROM.  Interested in hearing about any other success stories."
,MadHitter87,2007-12-22T22:27Z,"Hello, I am really new to this and need help cuase I don't know what I am doing.  I downloaded the uTorrent and have DVD burning software, what now?  Anyone willing to help me, I would love to down  Toyota Lexus Navigation DVD Gen 3 v6.1 as my disk has a problem and I need a backup!"
,greenhorn31,2008-01-01T09:05Z,"I just successfully burned the image with Nero 7 Ultra using Nero Burning Rom. To change the Book Type: 1. open Nero Burning Rom (you can select this from the left menu on Nero Express) 2. Close the ""New Compilation"" popup window. 3. At the top click ""Recorder"" then ""Choose Recorder"" or Ctrl+R. 4. Select your Dual Layer Recorder then click options in the lower right corner and it will extend the window down and you will see a ""Book Type settings"" then just select DVD-ROM. 

Below are screenshots of the process:

Whew!...

I have installed the disc in my Lexus RX330 and it works flawlessly. Thanks again ScotchMode.

BTW I will be uploading my old ver. 0.51 if someone needs that. 
"
,Esch,2008-01-11T05:26Z,"coasters a plenty.  Are we sure this is a gen 3 database and not really gen 5???I have tried to burn this thing with both nero and imgburn.  2 different images using 2 different burners.  Same result.  ""cannot read disk""  Please confirm it is really Gen 3.  This is getting expensive!!!"
,allivant,2008-01-15T23:28Z,"Used a Verbatim DL and it burned successfully.  It works perfectly on my 03 Camry SE.  Tried another successful copy with my father's 01 LS430 and it did not work.  I could not input any addresses or use any functions.  I put the old one back and now that gets a disk read error.

Did not try mine in his yet, too cold out.  Can a successful burn not work?"
,Esch,2008-01-16T01:37Z,found Gen2/3 V7.1 on another site.  Burned using same parameters as was unsuccessful with this image.  Works flawlessly.  Go figure.
,chithom,2008-01-16T06:48Z,"Well good grief Esch, share the link,  please . . ."
,TopGunz,2008-01-17T03:54Z,"allivant, I'm having the exact problem you are having with your Dad's 01 LS430. Did you try your DVD on his LS430? Just Curious."
,ScotchMode,2008-01-19T16:14Z,"if the link doesn't show up, go to torrentz dot com and search for ""toyota nav"""
,gastric456,2008-01-24T14:27Z,I pulled V7 from Mininova (couldn't find it here for some reason) and noticed it fits a single 4.7GB DVD instead of requiring a dual layer. There's no comments for that torrent so I'm unsure if it's geniune or not. Guess I'll burn and stick it in the car and find out myself. ;)
,ScotchMode,2008-01-24T21:05Z,"That's compressed.. it does need a DVD+R DL.
Play it safe and use a Verbatim.
Worked first try."
,kash134,2008-01-25T17:52Z,"Has any one tried it on a LX470 2001, I have the orignal 2000 Nav DVD in there, does anyone know if it is OK to directly go from version 1 to 7.1? I do not want to end up like those, with messed up Nav systems. But I also do not want go to the dealer
All suggestions are much appreciated"
,babylonboots,2008-01-28T22:36Z,"I used MagiISO to create ISO file and Power2Go to burn to DVD.  Loaded up into a 01-LX470 that had the original DVD-Data2000 ver 1.  

It accepted the DVD and began upload.  Then I got an error message that the program file couldn't be found.  Popped the DVD out.  Turned off the power and then turned back on, re-inserted the disk and it worked.  Took a while to load everthing - POI, complete map set.  Seems to be working fine. "
,babylonboots,2008-01-28T22:51Z,"Oh, yeah. Forgot to mention
Verbatim DVD+R DL used.  Total Size ~7.7 Gb"
,gastric456,2008-02-09T19:47Z,"Finally got this to work with ImgBurn on default settings and Verbatim DVD+R DL.

However, I still have not gotten the UIF V7 version to burn successfully. Someone needs to host that as a usable ISO as I suspect the UIF version has issues as MagicISO itself hangs when trying to convert the UIF to ISO and extracting the UIF results in 7GB+ of files but burning it to a DVD UDF format with Nero6 results in an unusable disc."
,FromTheLeft,2008-03-19T14:21Z,"Just so everyone is clear on this and hopefully this will help some others also. This 7z file unpacks to a file called ""Toyota Navigation DVD Gen 5 v6.1 464210-0750.iso"". This is incorrectly named and it really should be named ""Toyota Navigation DVD Gen 3 v6.1 464210-0750.iso"". It is for a gen 3 model and worked great in mine after burning at 2.4x on Verbatim media. Also, you should know that the ""LOADING.KWI"" file on the DVD is v5.1 and the data on the DVD is v6.1. The reason for this is that the v5.1 firmware (LOADING.KWI) still has the hidden menu capabilities and the ability to override ""programming the NAV unit while driving"". The ""lexnav.uif"" file or ""toyota nav""mentioned previously is version 7.1 data with v5.1 LOADING.KWI. Hopefully that helps some others."
,FromTheLeft,2008-03-19T14:29Z,I've heard talk in some toyota forums that 7.2 is out. Anyone have?
,Jester1868,2008-04-16T02:36Z,Just uploaded 7.1...search for it!  :o)
,marmajini,2008-09-24T19:05Z,"Hello,

Anybody know if it works in a Toyota Avensis 2004?

Thanks
