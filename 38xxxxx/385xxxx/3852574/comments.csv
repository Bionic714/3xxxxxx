,dupral,2007-10-22T02:17Z,"This is not a comment in this torrent specifically, but on win xp x64 in general... That version of XP is nothing but a joke... I got a 64 bit laptop and tried to put x64 xp on it and it was slower then regualr windows. very little if any driver support. I'd only reccommend using it if you know that every peice of hardware you use has a 64 bit (xp - unfortunately alot of the vista drivers don't work) driver... or of course you know how to write/modify drivers. ha I actually had better results w/ 64 bit vista... which is pathetic.

,X,2007-10-22T17:40Z,To dupral: Maybe You should learn more about Win64-systems ! I have no problem at all and i am running it on two computers at home. They work as a charme to be honest.
,Thorsson_86,2007-10-22T19:03Z,"can i add a language pack then to this windows? I don´t want this to be a wasted download, i´ve have upped it about 40 times it´s size so i think i deserve an answer, or atleast get to know wich language it´s in."
,k3N70n,2007-12-16T04:31Z,"Just installed.  Works perfectly.  
Passed Windows Genuine.
Installed WMP11  etc.  
Also, scanned with AVG ->clean"
,CK94,2007-12-16T22:14Z,"Hmm..didn't even get passed the blue screen at the beginning says it was missing a file. 

Be careful on this one. Didn't work for me at all. "
,CK94,2007-12-17T08:27Z,"I retract my previous statement. The previous burn must not have worked properly even though the burning program said it did. 

This torrent did work for me. 

Thanks Jack! "
,Turcca,2008-01-06T00:23Z,"Excellent upload.

Unfortunately the slipstreamed drivers crashed (blue screen) my system on startup every time, so it didn't work for me. With the right hardware, this would rock."
,jaqaq,2008-01-09T05:32Z,"So this is Windows Xp Pro 64-bit version? Not 32, rite?"
,Z33raPh,2008-01-13T10:03Z,"Thx for an excellent upload! Loving it, works like a charm and I´m actually writing this comment using the system right now"
