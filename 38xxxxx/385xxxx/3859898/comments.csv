,Blazedbill,2007-12-13T09:26Z,"Lol, yeah. Apparently the timing is way off, the movie is spoken in German, and about 1/2 of all of the dialog is not subbed. I have found a decent Subtitle timing speed ratio (subtitle : video) for DirectVobSub. It is 1036 : 995. Took a bit of tweaking to get it to work properly, but it should do the trick... Whoever subtitled this thing needs to be beaten though....."
,Blazedbill,2007-12-13T10:06Z,"At around 56 min. or so into the movie, it should be changed to 1036 : 994......"

LMAO, True. It's possible the subs are for another copy, I have 2 copies of this film now, this one and another in Russian which is dubbed directly over the bloody english words so it's amuddle!

I'll try your idea. After I see this I will have seen all of Jet Li's films so I need to see it! :P"
