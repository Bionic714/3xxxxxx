,Crater_Face,2007-10-26T22:42Z,"Well, according to MagicISO, this thing is corrupt :("
,lebra1,2007-10-28T17:26Z,not corrupt..i installed it..doesnt have a crack though
,Theflyingwin,2007-10-29T22:29Z,doesnt have a key.
,ironwarlock,2007-11-08T12:28Z,"Are you kiddig!? When you download you get 3 files (as shows on this side ""Files:3"") One of them is called ""Read Me (KeyCodes).txt"". Does it get less complicated? My problem, on the other hand, is the ""please insert correct CD"".. "
,ironwarlock,2007-11-08T23:42Z,"Ok.. There's no info here or in the download, but i found the answer on google: you need to use the ""NWNEnglish1.66HotUUpdate"" that comes with the download."
,Turbis,2007-11-16T06:47Z,"Vilket program ska jag mounta med?
Deamon tools vill inte funka fĂśr mig.

What app should I mount it with?
Deamon tools wont work for me."
,jackman234,2007-11-16T18:15Z,"if you really want it just buy it, its $20 and you dont have to deal with finding a key that works etc. you also support the makers and help ensure a new game comes out"
,lame_n00b,2007-12-19T22:47Z,"Turbis, first convert it to .ISO (with MagicISO or anything you like) and then mount it with Daemon...It should work."
,paulboscu,2007-12-30T10:35Z,"hey guys if the game asks you for the cd update it via the update button to version 1.68(the latest i think) and it will work because 1.68 doesen't do a cd check anymore.
i allready played it that way with an older nwn+sou+hou copy that i'v dld from tpb also.
i'm dld this because whant to play the premium modules too,witch i don't have.

hope that hepls you guys..."

,billydark,2008-02-05T02:14Z,"download the critical rebuild from nwn.bioware.com I had the same problem, what it does it replaces all of your files to 1.68 so you can play :)"
,tvax,2008-03-05T23:32Z,"10/10 awesome donwload and the readme is really good, simple and good ^^

thank you"
,jcoyne,2008-04-01T19:18Z,"Anyway of getting around the whole ""your CD key is still in use, please try again in 5 minutes"" thing?

I assume that is because everybody who downloaded this is using the same key yeah?"
,TKCMullahOmar,2008-04-07T05:15Z,"u notice no one says if it has Game modules from the developers of Neverwinter Nights
    * BioWare\'s Aurora Toolset, for easy mod and game creation
    * Neverwinter Nights Kingmaker expansion, including three complete BioWare designed adventures: Kingmaker, ShadowGuard, and Witch\'s Wake Remastered"
,Zealin,2008-05-14T18:28Z,Worked perfectly thank you =D
,Scamander,2008-07-04T12:38Z,"I, too, had the ""corrupt or unknown format"" prompt whenever I tried to mount the UIF or decompressed ISO using MagicISO.  My solution was to extract the UIF straight to a folder in my computer and to just run the Setup from there.  Worked great.

Also thanks for this."
,radnad616,2008-07-19T00:20Z,downloaded fine and everything but only question I have is what do i do with the files in the Neverwinter Nights Wyvern Crown of Cormyr by OUTLAWS folder?
,maverick1987,2008-09-02T04:51Z,kindly seed
,umeboshi,2008-09-07T09:44Z,"I had to use MagicISO to convert the uif file to an iso.  I then compared the files on the resulting iso to the iso in this torrent here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4045216/

Everything was complete and identical.  There is no good reason to keep going with this torrent.  Unless you're close to completion, I'd really suggest using the torrent mentioned above, and let this torrent become stranded.  I'm going to stop seeding this one, but I will continue to seed the torrent mentioned above."
,umeboshi,2008-09-07T09:52Z,"On top of that, it seems that the md5sums of the images turned out to be the same also.

9ca5e76b6ef10234c04230bf94710bb1  Neverwinter Nights Diamond Edition/NWN Diamond Edition.iso
9ca5e76b6ef10234c04230bf94710bb1  nwn.iso


It may be possible (I haven't tried this) to use MagicISO to convert the incomplete image, then start the other torrent, replace the iso with the incomplete one, then do a hash check and resume.  You might come out better that way."
,HLHTw1x,2008-10-16T19:02Z,everytime i mount the iso to a drive and when i run it it keeps saying that i need to reinstall it as a full install i need someone to help me..wut should i do?
,Zamorak1,2008-11-30T11:37Z,Could the modules be uploaded seperately?
,Triplehammer,2009-01-03T10:21Z,"The premium modules may have worked with the included serial numbers when this was first uploaded, but they do not now.  These modules require an online verification every time you play them which has not been cracked: Infinite Dungeons, Pirates Of The Sword Coast, Wyvern Crown Of Corwyn, Kingmaker, Shadowguard and Witch's Wake.  None of these will work, no matter what you do.

Kingmaker, Shadowguard and Witch's Wake were included on the Diamond DVD, and are supposed to authenticate offline, but I could not make that work, even uninstalling, reinstalling and using only the 1.66 patcher on the DVD.

What will work is the original campaign, Shadows of Undrentide, Hordes of the Underdark, and whatever free modules you can find on Bioware's site.  Darkness over Daggerford, Dreamcatcher, Shadowlord, Kosigan, and Penultimate are all good ones.

Install instructions:

1. Unplug your internet connection from your computer
2. Boot into safe mode (to avoid a hangup at the end of the install)
3. Run the setup.exe on the NWN Diamond Edition image
4. Say no to Kingmaker, it won't work anyway
5. Download the NWNEnglish1.69HotUUpdate.exe from bioware (323MB download), because it is officially the last update they will ever make.  You don't need any other official patches.
6. Get the CEP v2.2b or later (900MB download).
7. Install whatever free modules you want."
,josip1987,2009-01-13T21:29Z,can someone tell me pls where can i find a working torrent for Infinite Dungeons only...
,josip1987,2009-01-13T21:55Z,"lol, nwm... I found it"
,jgerund,2009-06-09T23:55Z,"I'm kind of new to this, if anyone could email me directions on how to download, install, and use this, it would be very much appreciated.   jgerund@yahoo.com"
,Sievel,2009-07-31T18:13Z,"If you do not want to buy the shitty programms used to create and open .uif images
here: http://www.techzilo.com/extract-open-uif-files/
you can find a converter that will convert it to a nice .iso

and please spread the word that .uif is crap and totaly unnessecery

ps.: the game installs fine. it took me about a day to download it."
,Kaolccips,2009-10-14T19:33Z,"This torrent works fine and I'm using it now.  I had a few problems at first, I figured I'd come back and help some people out that might run into the same thing.

This is if you use Vista or Windows 7.. I think it works fine with xp.

If you're getting a error saying you have a wrong windows version you have to get the Hordes of the Underdark Patch v1.69 from here:

http://downloads.gamezone.com/demos/d22912.htm

or wherever else.

Install that, then right click and change the compatibility to XP service pack 2.

and btw, I'd go ahead and install the patches from the update as far as you can go until it messes up.  Then run that 1.69 patch.

(also MagicISO doesn't work for Win7, so you should google Virtual CloneDrive or PowerISO)"
,AzureFire,2009-12-01T00:55Z,Adyrans 1m edition has the authenticion crack!
,thejust23,2010-01-16T21:57Z,can this work with windows 7
,iH8MSandU,2010-02-16T17:16Z,"Um. thanks for the upload. 
Great game, fast DL. 
BUT wtf is up with .UIF? i know, i know, it's magic disk/magic iso format, but why couldn't you just make it an ISO like everything else so people can burn it to a dvd without buying a crappy program?"
,Ctornade,2010-03-10T01:33Z,SEEEEED please!
,jc_azrael,2010-06-12T07:22Z,"Thanks uploader, the game works."
,kolayhe,2010-08-31T00:20Z,"Everything worked fine and perfect, just like the info says.
only thing which doesnt work is the premium modules, but thats understandable due to activating online

and for those who have ÂŁ2.50, you can buy the full edition on amazon... pretty cheap IMO"
,Grukan,2010-09-26T10:32Z,THIS EDITION IS NOW DIAMONDS
,chriswr,2010-09-28T05:03Z,btw if anyone is still having problems with the uif file just download UIF2ISO (very small file) and itll convert it to an iso file for daemon tools or whatever you use pretty quickly
,theRealKarmine,2010-10-02T20:58Z,"uploading anything other than iso is retarded.
second the premium modules work fine, you are just idiots.  you just have the wrong serials in the wrong place."
,Cossackelite,2010-10-27T06:41Z,"Works 100%, much thanks for the upload mate!"
,randizzle482,2010-11-02T22:42Z,Ya i had a question why cant u play online. Every time i try to says that im band. Can u not play online?
,nihil418,2010-11-14T02:44Z,"works great, thanks!"
,FrankieFame,2011-04-11T03:13Z,"thx alot for this game, it worked fine a bit tricky but figured it out, appreciate it."
,egervari,2011-06-04T07:31Z,"You are a piece of shit. Why do you use a compressed iso and force us to download a program just to uncompress it to a standard iso for? Why not just upload the actual ISO file?

You know, I could understand if it really made a difference with respect to the file size... but it doesn't! It's almost the exact same size! What the hell is the point? Just use ISO like everyone else!"
