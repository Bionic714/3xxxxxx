   format for PC; AudioUnit, VST, RTAS for Mac OSX Universal Binary and 

   VST, MAS (no RTAS) for OS 9 designed to improve the quality of digital 

   sound recordings that often lack quality due to excessive digital 

   sterility and harshness. The kit consists of: PSP MixBass, PSP 

   MixSaturator, PSP MixPressor and PSP MixTreble. As the name of the 

   collection suggests, the plug-ins which make up part of this series 

   are specifically for use during sound mixing. However, the quality of 

   the algorithms employed also allows them to be used in mastering.
