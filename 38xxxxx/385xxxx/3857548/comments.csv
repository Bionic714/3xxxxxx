,sal10851,2008-03-17T23:56Z,"Movie Info:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283139/"
,sal10851,2008-03-18T00:00Z,"This is one of my favorite films as well so no need to thank me. I wanna thank those who download and appreciate a good movie not to mention its book. Its based off a novel ""White Oleander"" by Janet Fitch, read it if u havnt! As always the book is better than the movie."
,theRealKarmine,2008-06-07T11:52Z,"gotta give my thanks for the only torrent for this at least on pb.  and yes, the book is recommended reading....even if its on the shitter."
,theRealKarmine,2008-06-09T06:38Z,after watching im inclined to say the book is significantly more detailed.  some of the actors didnt fit what i visualized from the book as well.  and the worst part is they left the best parts of the book out.  i was really anticipating seeing drunk russians so i was very disappointed.  but the quality is good.
