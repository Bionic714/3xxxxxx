,panomies6,2007-10-26T15:21Z,"Sweden let Finland down. They refused to join forces against Jew-Soviet empire. Swedes only sent hand-knitten gloves to Finland, not arms. ""Finlands sak är vår"" is as false as official history of ""neutral"" Sweden during WWII as nazi ho. 
"
,R2/D2,2007-10-26T17:43Z,"You are wrong , panomies. You are victim of a very popular myth that Sweden did nothing to help its neighbour. The Swedish government's contribution to Finland during 1939-40 was at least 490 Mkr. That's more than the Finnish state budget at the time! The contribution did not only consist of money but weapons as well. Not to mention the Swedish voluntary corps, ""Frivilligkåren"", which consisted of 10.000 men - almost a whole division. That's the largest voluntary corps from a single country that has ever existed! Of course Sweden couldn't join forces with Finland and go to war with the Soviet Union. That's ridiculous to suggest! "
,panomies6,2007-10-27T11:14Z,"brainwashed poor people still not yet made up with their dirty history as nazi ho...

""voluntary corps"" - what a joke, needed more men to protect them, e.g. no help but burden. most of them run back home to mom after first shot from russians.

Sweden let Finland down. Finland asked Sweden for help. Sweden refused. This is the true story.

My grandmother did her strongest protest, she cut prenum of DN. "
,R2/D2,2007-10-27T20:20Z,"You still don't get it, do you? Finland asked Sweden for help and Finland got help, in terms of money, weapons, men etc. But Sweden just couldn't declare war on the Soviet Union to fight for the Fins. Do you think Finland would have done that for Sweden, if Sweden was attacked by the Soviets?"
[T],prien,2007-10-28T08:55Z,"Thanks for the comments.

I didn´t believe this should be an political site. So I must do some coments by myself:

ari.man I thank you for what you wrote. But swedish people dont understand finnish so me 
either and I´m married with  finnish woman since 30 years...and she is still finnish, she´s
to proud to be a swedish citisen.

panomies6 your signature translated in swedish shouldbe: ""knulleman6"", and that says all
about you. You seems to me as a small little child who need help on a mental hospital becuse
you are realy retard.

R2/D2 Thanks for you coments, I believe you have a ""lot on your feets"". I can only say that
my wife is born 1937 in Turku and.. fan, jag klarar inte just nu översätta till engelska,
så jag fortsätter på svenska (det är inte lätt för gamla gubbar) och hon upplevde när 
ryssarna bombade hennes hemstad. Varpå hennes föräldrar tog det svåra beslutet att skicka
henne till Sverige för att undkomma kriget. Hon kom till Stockholm med endast en liten 
väska i handen och en lapp om halsen med hennes namn och togs omhand av en svensk fosterfamilj
som betraktade henne som sitt eget barn.

Så du knulleman6 läs lite bättre på din historia."
,panomies6,2007-10-28T13:27Z,"to prien: Your English is as bad as Your knowledge in history. What comes to Your ad hominem comments on my username, I totally understand because You don´t know Finnish, and unable to correlate what this username means, e.g. context. Cannot help - case lost

Swedes have a long way to go before they made up with their dirty past as Nazi ho. They still teach their kids that they were neutral in WWII. Their king was always welcome to visit Hitler, his dear friend.

,kantastisk,2008-01-04T03:04Z,"My goodness is this amusing. For those (potential Finns) who would call Sweden a 'nazi ho', I'd like to direct your attention to the so-called 'Continuation War' that followed this war only a year later.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_war

And for those who don't care to follow the link: Finland sided with Nazi Germany against the Soviets and The United Kingdom. 

That's right, *sided*, as in 'Nazi German forces entered Finland and fought alongside Finns against the Soviets'.

I'm not making a case for any of these countries - I simply don't even care to try. But I do refrain from using terms such as 'Nazi ho' on any of them - except perhaps Nazi Germany.

-And this is partly because I'm from Denmark...

Please cool your rage... There were no clean hands during WWII."
,Mayor1,2008-01-05T21:51Z,"
in ww2 was 3 side, and neutral for sweden or finland isnt option

if cherchil was faster when sweden became aliance ho

and where is nothing wrong fighting with nazi vs sovet for returning home territory

if aliance disarm nazi as in ww1 when stalin may go much far

... and there were no clean hands during ww2"
,kerkko85,2008-01-11T01:30Z,"I am a finn myself and i'm so ashamed of what panomies6 is spitting. I know we had some help from swedish volunteers and i thank you for that, as i think the majority of us finns would.
Great movie btw :)"
,eKi100,2008-01-15T04:26Z,"Then again kerkko85, panomies is partly right.
Even tho finland did recieve some help from sweden, it wasnt much.
Money, oh yeeaah, what finland needed was men.
And the men sweden sent, men who runned away after noticed theyve being shot at!
Unlike finnish who standed & fought. If they would have runned, finland would have been lost, and after that, where would have russians turned their attention, maybe to sweden? 
So sweden kind of owns finland a big thank you from sacrificing few generations of good men for the sake of free finland & free sweden also.

As well as finland owns a gratitude to sweden cos sweden offered ""safeplace"" for so many finnish childs during war (although some were never returned, but then again it was quite a chaos)

What comes to fighting with nazi's, like said, well justified cos fighting against russians to get lost territories back, and dont forget the fact, that finland also fought nazi's to drive them away from finland, wich caused nazi's to burn buildings as retreating to north towards norway.

Nobody isnt perfect, and war is always hell from some point of view at least..

But now, lets all concentrate on watching such a great movie shall we? :)
Afterall its a great movie & story of our grandfathers (yes im from finland & proud of it)"
,lowet1982,2008-01-21T21:34Z,"This debate is absurd, unless there are any 80 yeard old finn here who fought in the winter war. For the rest of you, you have nothing to say, you where not there. you did not fight. Stop condeming Sweden for not joining, (yeah even though a small number of volunteers did). My grandfather is Swedish he flew a Gloster Gladiator up in Rovaniemi and downed two Russian fighters, but you don't se me bragging about it, why? I WAS NOT THERE. 
Please, stop taking pride in Finlands great achievement of stoping the russians, you where NOT THERE! YOUR GRANDFATHERS WERE! Be thankfull instead. "

,lonnjohan,2008-02-16T20:18Z,"The Panomies6 guy is hilarious. Whale repeatedly stating Sweden should reconcile with it's ""nazi history"" and calling them ""nazi ho's"", he's being very Finnish in his complete denial to the fact that Finland went to war against Russia with the very same nazis.  Panomies6 - are you all nazis in Finland?
Now, you know, we forgive them that, we understand, we know. But hearing knulleman6 pointing his teenage finger at Sweden is pathetic. He should wash his own dirty laundry first. And don't come saying finns didn't admire the Germans at that time - everyone  did. Pre-2WW-Germany had been a political, cultural, intellectual and military superpower for centuries."

,Drago1976,2008-02-22T17:18Z,"Prien, plz ignore all that panomies is saying... I`m from finland too, but I don`t have anything against Sweden, nice country, nice peoples. Don`t judge us all to beeing idiots, cause 1 stupid jerk is saying something... From my side of view, panomies can go to hell with his ideas of nazi & backstaping...  In WW2 every country made their own decisions, some good, some bad. And every country that took a part to war lost... Only winners are those who survived trough it all alive in frontline."
,madina,2008-02-28T10:43Z,"Det verkar vara ett hett ämne. Tyvärr föddes jag några år efter kriget så jag kunde inte delta men kännde en som var med. Vilken version är detta, från 50-talet? såg den när jag gjorde lumpen."

[T],Knaster,2008-03-30T10:22Z,"panomies6 u cunt/fag and mongo freak, my grandfather served as a volunteer in Finland and after the Winter campaign he then joined waffen SS along with some Finns and exile-Estonians in the feldzug of Barbarossa. He often talked about Swedish/Finnish brotherhood of war and said such great ties will probably never be seen again. ""Why"" i asked!? He then said history would never acknowledge what we did in a proper way and only men would remember.
Oh' and behold his prophecy came true. 
Well i atleast believe in an united Scandinavia as a family. "
,62461,2008-04-04T02:56Z,"First of all, prien - thank you for the upload. I had seen this on TV years ago but after watching 'The Iron Cross', 'Patton', and some other war movies recently I wanted to see this again. (The Iron Cross, I recommend very much)

As for other political comments - as a Finn I am greatful for all Swedes and other who volunteered to help Finland, although I arguably naturually have no firsthand knowledge of [the] war, I am most greatful, without closer knowledge - at least for my grandfathers' sake.

And as others on the thread very correctly said, there were no clean hands in WW2 and that surely stands true for Finns as for any other country associated with the conflict, and any man who has been faced with the horror  that is the true state of war. Hopefully we shall not have to face a state such as that in centuries to come."
,okkis,2008-05-28T01:38Z,"Great movie. I think I've watched it every time it's been broadcast on TV.

As far as politics go, yes, Finland sided with Nazi Germany. And of this I'm glad: Otherwise I might be speaking Russian now.

I wonder where all this ""The Swedes were such pansies, they ran away when they noticed they were shot at"" crap comes from. Any references, other than your own opinions?

In any case, Sweden took in a lot of Finnish children. (My Swedish colleague refers to this as ""we ate your babies"") This was also important help. Even if Sweden had given Finland more men, I don't think it would've made much difference. The Soviets would still have had the upper hand. Maybe if Sweden had taken an official stand on Finland's side before Continuation War the Soviets hadn't attacked as eagerly, but that's just a maybe.

,Bosse6614,2008-06-26T17:02Z,Tackar o bockar...!!!
,bryggarebob,2008-07-02T23:22Z,"Sweden were discussing, in 1940, the possibility to suggest an alliance with Finland. But Hitler made it impossible when he promised to protect Finland in case of an Russian attack .

Sweden almost emptied all its supplies with modern guns, spec. machine guns, to send them to Finland during the winter war. 

The swedish army in 1939 hadnt the skills to fight during the winter, due to the short national service after 1925."
,nisse220d,2008-09-07T02:24Z,"Well, I just recently dowloaded this movie. I´ve seen it before, but if you don´t want to see a movie again, it can`t be that good... I Just want to say :F**K YOU Panomis6. I have 5 uncles on my mothers side. Non of them are alive, but one (1) of them survived jatkosota (they all voulonteered), then he spent 20 years in the french forigen liegon to heal his wounds( U know from seeing his 4 brothers die to protect the birth of a stupid asshole like you!).

,aqqt,2008-10-17T07:20Z,"Skitbra film! Nog den mest realistiska filmen om WW2 hittills, och den första som kommer i närheten av hur det var (enligt vad släktingar har berättat).

Great movie! Probably the most realistic WW2 movie so far, and the first one even close to how bad it really was (judging by what relatives who were there have told me)."
,okeido1971,2008-12-04T18:55Z,"Some (panofag6 for example) ought to take history lessons... Sweden was afraid of getting involved, so all it did was supplying finns with weapons and intel and helping the germans in any possible way they could invent. There wasn't much help from the _nation_, but it was a group of swedish individuals who risked or gave their lives to fight for Finland and for the western way of life. They deserve our appreciation and certainly have mine. They took lead just like my grandfather did. Just imagine, join the forces of your neighbour to fight a third country - would you do it today?

Thanx for the up!"
,DethronedGhost,2009-01-08T00:26Z,"Like somebody said, no one in WW2 had clean hands. Both Sweden and Finland sent Jews to concentration camps during that time... So blaming Sweden for being a nazi ho is just laughable, as we Finns were more of a ho than they were... Almost allies. Yeah yeah, Continuation War was declared as our own war, but we were a part of the frontline which invaded Soviet Union in 1941.

And yes, I'm born and still living in Finland. But hey, cheers for the movie!"

,jabijabo,2009-10-22T17:37Z,"Royskatt. I respect your VIp icon although I've never seen your work yet. But i have to disagree strongly. NO i cannot be happy that anyone share crappy bad work and he can waste all the time he wants, I couldn't care less if he did not waste ours and insult those hundreds who worked hard to deliver a technically good film. and YES i would much prefer and be happy that he stops posting at all FOREVER if that is only to continue this way. Because amateurish encoding is just polluting the site with bad rips and worst of all A LOT of wasted bandwith all around. So yes I am happy to confirm again my thoughts that everyone would be much better off without such bad encoders. If he want to test his results, at least mention it. And really the paying argument does not make sense at all. It is not because it seems free (although nothing ever is) that it has to be shit. Quite the contrary. Good work has nothing to do with money, quite the contrary. Proved by genius starving artists and wealthiest super rich Mc Donald or Microsoft."
