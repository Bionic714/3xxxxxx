,staern,2008-02-24T18:21Z,"ThereÂ´s one song, ""Bright Light Fright"", on the album ""Draw The Line"" which is not included on this download."
,Krissmatic,2008-03-20T23:19Z,"Mayby not all songs are included but I gratefully thank you for it!

*happy*"
,dormido,2008-05-22T17:58Z,"200 seeders, 88 leechers, and about 2 weeks i have 9% but folder size is 1,54Gb...
why this could be?"
,tko1,2008-05-23T09:43Z,"As far as quality...I have acrappy 128mbps copy of Draw The Line and the file size of the title song is 3.13, The same song here shows 3.11, so its gotta be 128.
Kinda sucks, seems all the Aerosmith torrents are all at crappy bit rates, and its hard to find the old albums anywhere."
,Murzoo,2008-05-23T22:02Z,"Use the freeware Switch, easy to convert the 128 to 320kbs"
,srm6578,2008-06-09T00:13Z,"True, because making the bit rate higher adds quality... "
,srm6578,2008-06-13T08:47Z,"True, my reply was sarcastic.  :)"
,Perry_R,2008-07-28T14:17Z,No songs are tagged! There is like 370 of them too.
,putunifladfisk,2008-07-30T12:21Z,"yes, all aerosmith torrents are crap"
,ScottG,2008-08-21T18:46Z,"I agree with hayythere... If something is originally recorded at a bitrate of 128 then it excludes the information that would be included in 320... so its not like 128 hides the info to be later revealed... its not even there, thus making the converted to 320 songs the same exact quality but taking up room on your computer... am I wrong?"
,Gh0ztly,2008-10-29T17:01Z,Please Seed. Thanks.
,butyok13,2008-11-07T09:17Z,"What is codek?My Winamp don't play !
Not render the file!!!
Please help !Please link codec"
,jidanni,2008-11-25T10:47Z,"Bogus Swarm:
Even just pick one song to download from this torrent.
Check you client's peers window. Everything looks great. Lots of peers. Lots have 100% of the torrent.
But you will soon see that even just downloading that one piece or two takes forever: Failed checksums over and over.
So the swarm is filled with phony peers.

Perhaps Pirate Bay's tracker could be trained to not pass along these phony peers addresses?!"
,jidanni,2008-11-26T00:12Z,"Even with all blocklists enabled, etc. These peers download slower and slower... and when one finally passes 99.9%... wham, checksum error. And it all starts again.

Note, the above observations are on just selecting one itty bitty chunk of the whole torrent!"
,Twinkles927,2008-12-26T06:56Z,With 237 seeders why is it that there is not one that is really seeding this ? not even 1 ? How can anyone get this file if not even 1 seeder seeds it ? 
[T],stanky1219,2009-01-18T08:39Z,kings and queens is either a re-performed version or a demo on gretaest hits and walk this way is live? this torrent is fucked up.
,VolKoV47,2009-01-28T19:52Z,Fuck! No tags? Screw this torrent.
,Habazub,2009-02-09T23:16Z,COME ON!! SEED!! 99% and it STOPPED?? SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!
,wontgetfooledagain1,2009-03-02T16:15Z,"Ugh, every Aerosmith torrent SUCKS on here! And that FLAC link is broken...
Fuck it, I'll just buy the albums. -_-"
,bumminy,2009-06-22T01:14Z,"I had no problems... though I only downloaded one song. >.> I have all of the albums because I owned them at one point in time, but I accidentally deleted one song I couldn't live without.

Anyway, good luck finding a good Aerosmith torrent. I'd create one myself, but mine wouldn't be good quality either. Sorry, guys."
,bumminy,2009-06-22T01:15Z,"Oh, and my one song had tags..."
,Alexzander212,2009-07-17T08:03Z,"Hate to be the asshole that says this,
HOWEVER you need to actually need to provide some structure to the Torrent.
Not just a large amount of mp3's in a folder.
Dued take the time to at least at the artist names to the MP3 files.
Itunes IS free."
,Crow_FoReVeR,2009-08-05T15:30Z,"There is 2 tracks missing. Track 5 from ""Draw The Line"" and Track 3 from ""Greatest Hits"". Everything esle is good, just need tags edited and converted so all has the same bittrate. Witch I already did on them. Thanks."
,dawm,2009-08-23T06:14Z,"WTF?! NO TAGS? You've got to be kidding me.. 

Warning: No files are tagged.."
,TheultimateG,2009-10-12T08:47Z,For all you whiners complaining about tags get some brains and download a tag editor. I recommend: http://www.jthink.net/jaikoz/
,rolfosten,2010-02-04T19:20Z,"The crapies't consert i have seen is
Aerosmith.The band that warmed up was a 100 
times better.(the Cult)"
,MoonDookie,2010-03-11T22:53Z,thank you !!
