,jamiemorr,2007-11-26T23:20Z,"Wow - absolutely fantastic stuff, can't thank you enough for uploading it all. Hard to believe that I'll hopefully have 17 DVDs worth of Peel at the end of it!"
,brixtonpunk,2007-12-02T19:43Z,"Oh come on people this is just stupid 
I got tons of people connected but a download rate of between 2 and 10 kb
Dont be so fucking selfish and seed once youve got  the damn thing"
,brixtonpunk,2007-12-02T19:47Z,"btw thanks for this PirateMike its fucking fantastic if I ever get it !!!
thanks again. Peely mentions me and my dog in the '01 festive fifty and the disc i burnt it to 6 years ago dont work any more so double thanks 
a lesson there dont archive on cdr's if u gotta archive on disc then use rw's I guess this goes for dvd's as well"
,pavemental,2008-01-03T16:47Z,"I love your Peel torrents, they are so great, never thought I'd get to hear these broadcasts again. This particular torrent though seems to have some issues. Some of the mp3s appear corrupt (ie they can't be played). 

So using Azureus, I downloaded those ones again. Second time round most were corrupt still. On my PC, to keep things more organized, I created a new set of folders and moved uncorrupt mp3s from both downloads into the new folders. Turns out that process corrupted some of the previously good files. All very weird. 

Anyone had any similar issues or got any advice?"
,pavemental,2008-01-08T17:11Z,"I've downloaded this torrent three times now, and there are definitely some corrupt files in there. I'd say as much as 10%.

1995, 1998, 1999 and 2000 are all fine every time, every other folder has a few mp3s that don't work (I've tried several programs to play them).

Two files that have been unplayable every time are from the 1992 folder: 07 #44 - the klf & extreme noise terror - 3 a.m. eternal.mp3 and 08 #43 - drag racing underground - on the road again.mp3

I'm on a PC using Azureus 3.0.4.2. Anyone else had this experience? Can anyone rapidshare the files I need or something?"
,senshisteph,2008-04-05T05:33Z,You just completely filled up my brand new mp3 player - thanks so much!
,hatdog7,2008-04-18T04:46Z,looks like a great compilation thx.. i have been open and downloading for 3 days and need a seed for last 18%

,ant0,2008-08-30T17:20Z,Thanks so much to PirateMike for this series of torrents. I downloaded Part 2 already and have started listening to the Festive 50s in chronological order from 1976 onwards. It's a great way to listen to the best alternative music that was out at the time.
,Zejock,2008-10-15T20:55Z,"Cheers, can't wait to listen to all this (going to be a while tho, pleeeeese seed)."
,tristant,2008-12-05T22:23Z,"PirateMike, thanks a lot. Was thinking I would never be able to hear his shows. It feels right that there should be an archive. Does anyone a full or partial collection of all the singles that were in the box that he take with him in case of a fire? See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel%27s_Record_Box"
