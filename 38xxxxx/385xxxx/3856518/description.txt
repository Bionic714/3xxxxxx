Compiled by Freeaatmah and Flipknot                                          
We at Foot Stompin Records are firm believers in the philosophies of great    
thinkers of the past (and in the power of the network of thought).            
We are happy to be working together with passionate and dedicated artists    
from across the world and truly creating a 'network of thought'. In this      
compilation we have tried to pack in the experience of an intense psychedelic 
journey. A transition from night to the break of dawn A voyage through time a 
deeper understanding of the premise that 'Time is Thought'.                  
This music is dedicated to all the dance floors across the Universe; to      
spreading the understanding, realization and expression of the potential of  
our connection - our 'Network of Thought'.
