AVI -> DVD re-encode of episodes 19-20 from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3653035/, which are a tv-rip.

Made these to tide me over until next Spring, when the R1 DVDs come out; thought I'd share.

NTSC; English language, no subtitles; 5-minute chapters; cheesy menu.

They're half-D1, but the source AVIs weren't much better.  Still look pretty good to my eyes tho.
