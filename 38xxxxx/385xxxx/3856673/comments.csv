,casperboo,2007-12-19T02:15Z,"OH MY GOD... you people are so stupid.

reece1993, if you don't know how to extract an iso from a multip-part archive, why the hell are you on Pirate Bay.  I can not believe your dumb ass copied 23 files to the mem card.  Get a clue!

Quit complaining like a bunch of whiny kids and open up Google... do some research.

Finally, I wouldn't be suprised if most of you retards don't even have custom firmware, in which case you can't play this game anyway.  "
