,vitorvious,2007-11-10T10:24Z,alright im really confused right now...my favorite jackie chan movie is the drunken master...made in 1994...this says revenge of the drunken master..made in 1980 so it couldnt be a sequel... so what i want to know is. Is there a sequel to the drunken master made in 1994 starring jackie chan?
,vitorvious,2007-11-10T10:31Z,"nevermind, i found the answer to my question using my bestfriend...google. For anyone interested the drunken master made in 1994 was the sequel to the drunken master made in 1978...name is the same but the movie is different."
,vitorvious,2007-11-10T10:33Z,oh and this movie...i have no idea wat the fuck this is... doesnt have jackie chan in it so its probably not worth watching
