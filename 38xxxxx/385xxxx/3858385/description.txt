Episode 16: And the Winner is?. / Frames and Tryptichs in a new Way

In this show John Arnold from Photowalkthrough draws the winner of the triptych contest. Before that we talk about why you should also listen to his podcast and about a really nice workshop. I have to work at that time (May 5th to 7th), but otherwise I would have shelled out the money and gone there.

Then I?ll show you a new way to make a frame around an image or to do a triptych. It works with layer masks. The tip to do it that way was sent by Jason from New York.

Finally you?ll see all the triptychs made by you in a slideshow to the full lenth ?Surreal in Vienna? by _Ghost - the music I use in the intro. More from _Ghost at ccmixter.
