Sorry everyone... my useless Gateway laptop crashed and I lost everything that was on my hard drive. Fortunately, I had a copy of this movie on another computer. If you were trying to download this avi, please delete the old Whisper of the Heart torrent (I removed it from TPB) and download this one instead.

This is a DVDrip of "Whisper of the Heart" (Mimi wo sumaseba - 1995), an animated film by director Yoshifumi Kondo and Studio Ghibli (Hayao Miyazaki wrote the screenplay). Original Japanese audio with burned-in English subtitles.

From imdb:

A young girl finds that all the books she chooses in the library have been previously checked out by the same boy. Later she meets a very infuriating fellow... could it be her "friend" from the library? The boy's grandfather has a violin sales and service shop. The boy wants to be a violin maker like his grandfather.
