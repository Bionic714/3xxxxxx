pwdservice.exe

Next, the program registers the downloaded file as a remote service.

The program creates the following registry entry:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Explorer\""000"" = ""pwdservice.exe""

but thanks for the upload. It is clean. Dont listen to these homofukkin noobs."
,wayngrove,2011-04-08T21:50Z,"Good quality Key Gen program.  If you're looking here, it means you're doing something that Microsoft frowns upon, so why wouldn't it show up as a virus on a scan?  Two words; it works.  just make sure you unzip it on the PC you need the key for, and it should work right away.  Go XP!"
