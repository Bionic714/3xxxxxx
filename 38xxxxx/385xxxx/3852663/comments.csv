,mahavirbharti,2007-10-22T22:38Z,Whats the read order?tried searching the net but didnt find any info.downloaded but dont know in which order to read.
,Re-actor,2007-10-23T00:50Z,"I am not sure myself about order.
I think it goes like this:
30 Days of Night 
Dark Days
30 Days of Night: Return to Barrow

place others in order by using wikipedia!

,nagar911,2007-10-24T10:54Z,Yeah dude i do buy them(got a huge collection been reading them since i was three) but the place i am from does not have many new comics coming around.all we get here are the classic box sets etc.
,knoxbox,2008-02-14T04:49Z,"im guessing that this is what inspired the movie, the movie is a bit different but the 30 days seems to flow with parts of it such as burning of the cellphones, thats as far as i have gotten so far... excellent up."
