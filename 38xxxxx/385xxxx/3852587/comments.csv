,dellboys,2008-03-24T14:48Z,"there's a possible bug in this. First I had a problem installing it (like it wanted to go to the mother site)
Then when I was doing a watermark on a film it stooped at 60% and said no room on my hard drive' (I have 49GB left)  I checked  my drive and there was nothing left, it wanted to  reboot and luckily I said no. I deleted this program and my pc came back to normal with my 49gb.  So be warned."
