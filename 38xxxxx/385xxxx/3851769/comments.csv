,shizma,2007-10-22T02:48Z,"It works just fine, it has 50/60 Hz selector aswell. Great game"
,shizma,2007-10-22T02:49Z,"50/60 Hz means PAL/NTSC selector, for those who don+t know"
,khano,2007-10-22T05:53Z,"Can some one please tell who i burn a ps2 game when i have downloaded it, wisch CD do i need and wich cd ord dvd program do i need.

Can some one please tell who you do, and can you play burned games when you dont have a chip in your ps2? please help-..."
,shizma,2007-10-22T07:44Z,"...download the game, open first file with winrar, extract the file somewhere in computer, use alcohol120% or dvd decrypter to burn...

...i use traxdata value pack and burn on 4x speed, no problem so far with any game...

...yes, you need modded ps2 to play..."
,barfly14,2007-10-22T12:49Z,nice upload. is this english version?
,PAOJIM,2007-10-22T19:25Z,shimza then extract must mount it or not...
,manmade2008,2007-10-22T19:46Z,".. some tips for noobs, burn at slow speeds (like 2x) on Verbatim or other quality media.. it's preferred to have a quality modchip'ed ps2.. buy isopropynol agent (u get it from CD/dvd Repair kit for instance) and q-tips (or similiar) and clear yer laser every now and then (but do it fast, and dry the laser IMMEDIATELY, unless plastic irritation might occur) .. if u've got a 2 years old ps2 or even 3 and newer, always AVOID cleaning with agents, just a dry rinse of the laser should fix MOST reading problems.. never, EVER, use DVD to CD ripped games, since yer laser will be ruined. And the same goes for NOT clearing the laser from dust... when it comes to swap magic, every now and then u have to 'rebuild' a game, especiallly if a game is a certain size, 'filling' the dvd disc.. but even me, with a modified ps2 have to rebuild certain games.. use MagicIso to unpack the ISO to a folder, and then use Nero Burning Rom (or similiar) and just copy the files from the folder (NOT the folder) and burn it as a ISO/UDF (!!!!) dvd..  last but not least, remember that all dvd and cd lasers are sensitive to smoke.. so, if u're a smoker (like me), it'll kill the laser ;D anyways.. have phun, and seed once u're done.."
,datsura,2007-10-22T19:55Z,Works fine with HDLoader
,manmade2008,2007-10-22T20:16Z,"..would just like to add, google the words/references u might be uncertain of... when it comes to burning at 4x or even 8x (some ppl have the analogy to burn half the speed of the dvd media, I really never tried it out), all I have to say, the slower u burn, the better the inprint.. got 1400 burned titles for ps2 now, those r still working since back in the day when dvd media was alot more expensive ;D .. but, it's true, u actually don't need a modified ps2 to enjoy a bunch of ps2 titles, u need swap magic (2 discs, one for cd another dvd)... 
bought an Xploder VGA cable, to connect my ps2 to a PC monitor, and I wouldn't recommend it, since u have to boot up the Xploder HDTV boot disc first, but then, besides from constant re-sizing, u'll experience a whole lot of games not working at all, or just abit (just intro or ingame play)... if u really want to play ps2 games, modify yer ps2 with a DMS4 modchip (go pro if u want).. but it's a prof. soldering job.. anyhow, maybe there's ppl out selling their modchip'ed ps2's now that the technology is _this_ old.. the best ps2 experience visually must be on a Commodore (s)1084 or similiar old monitors.. that's it, back to ufc 77.. ;D oooh.. and ALWAYS be careful when opening the ps2, since there's a cable to the on/off & open/close buttons, so, do not use any force.. the same goes got cleaning the laser.. be ultra-sensitive ;)"
,shizma,2007-10-23T06:03Z,This release doesn't have to be mounted.
,CelestialPenso,2007-10-23T23:58Z,Thank u for your release and please seed!
,rarashannon,2007-10-24T17:05Z,Okay so consider me a complete idiot! Can someone explain to me how I'm to burn a game to DVD+R for my Playstation 2. What do I use and how do I do it. I have NO clue what I'm doing!!!
,john cena54,2007-10-25T17:38Z,does anyone have a player manual so i can know how to do the new moves?
,jay7son,2007-10-25T19:18Z,"there is no sound at all on this accident release on the 2 gig pack or the 2.4 gig pack and yes i have tried burning both at 2x
apart from that both packs seem to work fine"
,jay7son,2007-10-25T19:32Z,correction there is sound it was my dodgy lead after all 
,phantom67,2007-10-25T20:44Z,"im downloading at 3 kb/s :(
with what speed are you guys downloading?"
,schocher,2007-10-26T22:09Z,hi can anybody help me cuz everytime i try to extract the file to iso i keep recieving a message that says that there is not enough space on the disk and only NTFS file supports files larger than 4 GB
,give_up,2007-10-27T16:56Z,"schocer, your hard drive is formatted as FAT32. This means that you cannot have a single file of 4 GB or over. NTFS-formatted hard drives do support 4GB or over. 

But this shouldn't be a problem because the iso is 2.4 GB when extracted."
,give_up,2007-10-27T16:57Z,"ALSO, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST 2.4GB FREE ON YOUR HARD DRIVE."

,baadshah,2007-10-30T10:53Z,"Yeah i also have the similar problem it comes up Playstation 2 and then goes black and doesn't get any further sometimes says disc error before coming to ps2 screen tried to unpack the rar file 2 times and also burned 2 times

,Ouffer,2007-11-01T18:45Z,"Do i just burn the iso file, or do i extract the iso file and burn it? fast answear please=)"
