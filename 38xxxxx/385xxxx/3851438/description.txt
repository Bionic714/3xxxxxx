October 1, 2001 - If I could pick three of my three favorite coin-op games from the mid to late '80s, along with Ms. Pac-Man (the table-top version) and Ikari Warriors would be Midway's SpyHunter. The fast-action racing-shooter relieved me from my English studies when I needed it, stole time from my girlfriend (which was a good thing sometimes), and was the receiver of some cruel, harsh words when I performed badly at it. SpyHunter, undeniably and perhaps sadly, was a big part of my childhood, and it's helped shape my idea of what a great arcade game should be.

And don't forget seed.
