Step 2

Now look for the file "realmlist.wtf" in your installation folder.
(example: "C:ProgramWorld of Warcraft")

Open it with notepad and make it look like this: 


set realmlist 71.6.145.123
set patchlist us.version.worldofwarcraft.com

Now save it.

<------------------------------------------------------------>

Make a account at: http:/71.6.145.123/Hellreg/

Start the game, login and play! ;]

(If the updater starts again once logged in, let it update
and check the "realmlist.wtf" again, to check if it's been changed or not.
If it's been changed, then changed it back to "set realmlist 71.6.145.123"
and try play again =)
