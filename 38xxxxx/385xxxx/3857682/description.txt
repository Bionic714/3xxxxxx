This torrent is dedicated to Oink\'s Pink Palace...
Rare but groovy music like this made it very special place. I found so many new artists and albums which I wouldn\'t have found without OiNK. I made also a new record of buying albums in the present year, spent nearly all my money, more than 1000EUR in music that I had found on OiNK. We miss you...
From now on I will buy other things because it\'s against my conscience to support organization that destroyed one of the greatest cultural archives of all time. Nevertheless, hope you enjoy the album!
