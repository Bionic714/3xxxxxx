If you are going to use someones wireless AP... Go for the ones that secured it (thinking they are so smart), hack it. It is not hard. It depends on your wi-fi card if you can change the manufacturers settings on it (put your wi-fi on sniff mode). Oh shit let me shut-up.... This is about a movie... Not Hacking! 
Oh and He0n... I'll get back to you on the  ""CINEA protection"". I have to tinker with it for a bit. When I have a solution (Me and Da-odarz) , we'll hit you up! Other than that. I have a CISSP test tomorrow. I am out like roaches when are the light are off!

@Nuhkka
Easy way to make torrenting secure
1) get peerguardian 2 (google, but only download from phoenix labs)
2) get uTorrent
3) force protocol encryption in uTorrent under bittorrent preferences
4) try to steal wireless :)"

I've converted it to DVD and burned it and the audio stays in sync for the whole thing, so no major complaints on that front. 

The video is a tad on the darker side, the colors are also a little bit faded, but for this sort of a movie, it really shouldn't matter.

Warning you to stop downloading illegal content. Always have PG2 running when you are downloading. It blocks known, fake IP's from connecting to your computer. Only setback is... they cant find 'em all. But keep it updated and you should be cool.  FIGHT THE GREED.

However I don't see why your wasting your time, theres the dvdr and the xvid release. Why convert when you can get the dvd?

Alternatively, you could buy a divx compatible dvd player and put 6 movies on one dvdr. Something like a philipps 3380 can be got on ebay for under 90euro if you shop around.  Its the best option really timewise."
