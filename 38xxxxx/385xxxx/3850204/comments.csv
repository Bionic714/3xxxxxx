,NinjaWanker,2008-04-27T22:17Z,The textures are broken.. anyone know what that is?
,NinjaWanker,2008-04-28T22:01Z,Broken textures turned out to be a driver problem. 
,tez_no14,2008-05-30T20:39Z,"Hi, i'm sorry if this is annoying and i realise that there has already been advice posted on how to install this file, but i am having a problem. 

Essentially i extract the .mds file and then try and mount it with daemon tools and i get an error message ""unable to mount image, file not accessable"" 

anyone have any tips as to why this may be happening?"
,jonksu467,2008-07-26T10:36Z,This really works thnx man!!

,Anarith,2008-11-23T13:53Z,"hmm, the mouse appears as a white box and many things don't look right, like enemy's their shape is good but they got bricks as face, i already tried to change compatibility"
,tanketorsken,2009-01-16T11:13Z,"Nice game, there's actually still a small competitive league/community for this game, also downloads for some more maps etc. it can all be found here : http://www.tcl.jolt.co.uk/"

,Daxx990,2009-02-01T01:14Z,I need step by step instructions. 
,Daxx990,2009-02-01T02:08Z,never mind
,mr-dante,2009-12-26T01:13Z,strange....i noticed that the game does not work on separated graphic cards....:s cuz i have 2 pcz and the game worked in the one with integrated graphic card and worked for some buddies whose computer contains an integrated graphic card...anyway thanks :d.
,unRheal,2010-02-28T05:49Z,mr-dante: I think that with your extensive testing with 1 (one) machine with a graphics card in it that failed to run SoFp... it may be just a tad pre-mature to declare the game unable to run on any machines with graphics cards in them.
,kornklone,2010-08-24T08:04Z,"I have the same problem as Anarith. I have installed it twice with different torrents and the characters and weapons are the right shape, but weird colors and the characters have brick faces and shit. ive tried messing with settings and setting everything to low, but nothing worked. im guessing its probably a vista thing. any ideas?"
,dmmm123,2012-05-26T17:23Z,"I'm having a problem with installing the game on Windows 7 x32.
When I mount the MDS file, and the menu screen for the game pops up, where it says 'Play', 'Install', 'Extras', etc., I press Install, and a splash image shows up with the SoF:Platinum logo, and in the bottom right corner, a small setup window with a loading bar pops up. When the bar reaches 100%, the window and the image stay on my screen for about a minute or two, and then just disappear. Crash. The only
processes that still remain in Task Manager are '_ISDel.exe' and '_INS5576._MP'. I tried running '_ISDel.exe' directly from the 'Setup' folder on the disk, I tried setting the autorun launcher, the Setup launcher, and '_ISDel.exe' to the WinXP Service Pack 3 and 2 compatibility, I tried ticking off all other options like setting the resolution to 640x480, and that desktop composition option, but it still does the same thing. It hangs and then crashes to desktop.
I can't even install the game. I've tried downloading from other torrents, but they're all the same image, so I'm still having the same problem.
Can anybody help me? I really want to play this game."
