,Karl Mundt,2007-10-25T10:59Z,"Thanks for the upload. What is the make up of the DVD's: disc 1 The film, disc 2 Extras? Or is the film on both discs"
,roma_barca,2007-10-25T11:53Z,"the movie is very long ~300'
so I guess the picture is on both DVD ;-)

but I would ask : is there only english subs ? Even if you wrote this I can't understand how in an untouched DVD, if there are three spoken languages, there are no three subs ???"
[T],Artleo,2007-10-25T17:26Z,"1. Disc 1- 1900. Disc 2- 1900 + Special Features.
2. Believe it or not: subtitle options: English / None."
,roma_barca,2007-10-26T12:40Z,"thank you for your answer, ARTLEO !

great anyway ! ! ! ! !"

,merkurious,2007-11-03T21:43Z,Please SEED....stuck at 94.28% for the last two days!!
[T],Artleo,2007-11-04T11:53Z,">merkurious.
 There is no evident reason why you should get stuck at 94.28%. The swarm now has far more than 100%. So exercise some patience and you shall be rewarded. And don't forget: the more you give the more you get. 
 P.S.
 I'll resurface now and then for some time on so that availability wouldn't be less than 1.00. Cheers:)"
,SRC1022,2007-11-14T08:20Z,Any possibility on a reseed for this?

,amytriptilin,2008-03-20T08:49Z,"Artleo,

It seems that one of the vob files has some problems. Specifically, I'm talking about VTS_01_1.VOB from the DISC 1; when I'm opening this file alone, regardless of the player I'm using, I can see that the file begins with a scene that shouldn't be there; that scene is 3'08"" long and corresponds to a moment in film that begins at exactly 01h 58'28"". Can you please confirm if your file has the same issues? From what I've read it seems that this kind of issue has something to do with unreferenced cells / and or some PGC errors in that vob file.

If I normally play the DVD, there are no problems at all, but if I want to convert to .avi, the resulting file is exactly 3'08"" longer than it should be, because the scene I mentioned above appears twice, first at the very begining of the film, and second where it actually belongs.

I just wonder if this could be related to some shrinking issues or the original DVD has the same problem.

Thanks in advance for your support."
[T],Artleo,2008-03-22T16:28Z,"amytriptilin, it seems that original DVD has the same ""problem"". I decrypted the VOB file in question once more with identical results. 
But I'd have never noticed it , had you not written about it here, cause it's absolutely of no importance to the overall picture."

,piet7104519,2008-12-08T13:15Z,amytriptilin - r able to modify the VOB file before coverting 2 avi ?
