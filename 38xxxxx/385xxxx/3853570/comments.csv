,emercer1,2007-12-31T08:13Z,I'm having a problem extracting all of the files. It's asking for a .c00 file
,lechampion,2009-03-27T01:55Z,"THIS GAME WORK GOOD ! ! ! (no music but it's not very important)

SIZE: 637 mb when decompressed !

1: Extract all the compressed archives EXCEPT the file IFISHING.ACE .

2: NOW you can extract the file IFISHING.ACE ( it's why Emercer had problems )

3: Click on SETUP.BAT ( 637 mb after this SLOW decompression )

4: Now click mp3unpack.exe

5: click on the IN-fisherman icon to start !"
