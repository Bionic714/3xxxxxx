this pack contains episodes 1 to 14 of "Heroes Unmasked" (the BBC behind-the-scenes documentary about the series "Heroes")

i put these together from individual episode releases by BiA (except S01E01 by PVR and S01E05 by ??)

there seems to be some confusion about the numbering of the episodes, and i decided to stick to the official website at http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/heroes/unmasked/

but they don't list the special that aired between S01E08 and S01E09, so i just called that one S01E08a (to keep the alphabetical order)

the re-numbering shifts all episodes after S01E08a down by 1 (e.g. S01E10 becomes S01E09, etc.)

to make things a bit less confusing i also added the episode titles to the file names


enjoy!
