,Bizak,2007-11-01T14:47Z,"Reminds me of the Incontinent Truth when you could still not get a clean copy after a good half year after its ""official"" release. Postal had its release 14 weeks ago, how long can it possibly take?"
,Bravesniff,2007-11-02T00:51Z,"It amazes me that germans still refuse to stop dubbing movies, what is wrong with them? Learn english for heavens sake!"
,FTW2000,2007-11-03T16:35Z,I really wanna watch this movie despite of that all speak german(havent got any problems with german pornos though....Jaa das sindt sehr gail! ). Thanks !!!!!!
,ReasonsUnknown,2007-11-03T16:54Z,"@Bravesniff
Stop complaining and learn german for heavens sake! O.o"
,squeek0,2007-11-09T03:27Z,germans dont believe in internationality since they are nationalists :P
,Honkus,2007-11-11T03:34Z,"Yeah right, we're all little Hitlers...
@Bravesniff: German speaking market nets ~ 100 million people, so they dub stuff.
On top of that, Writer, Producer and Director is Uwe Boll, who is in fact a Nazi - errrr- german.
What's your problem again?"
,Honkus,2007-11-11T03:36Z,"Thanks for sharing btw., been waiting for this one! :D"
,matsv201,2007-11-16T00:48Z,Is there any English/Swedesh subtitles around? Or can someone who is skild in both languth make one?
,Doktor_Schmerz,2007-11-22T00:44Z,"well, you kiddys are pretty easy to amaze..
dubbing works well for germans as for any other large language group ..its simply business cause the market is there..

why do you even check this torrent and post retarded comments when the torrent name even contains a big fat ""GERMAN"" what you're obviously not looking for.

anyway.. i cant understand why there aint no engl. screener yet.. strange strange.

by the way.. dubbed movies are sometimes so much more fun than the original.. i just love the german versions of the bill and ted movies :D ..way better than the original, lmmfao!!

,agibaer,2007-11-24T07:48Z,"Geez.............................................................
Complaining about Jerrys not subbing foreign movies.... I wonder how big the market for SUBBED movies in english speaking countries is.... must be round 0,001 per cent as even DUBBED movies don't reach more than 2-3% !

@Bravesniff: How many foreign tongues are you fluent in? Most germans speak at least english, many more another foreign language.

Wouldn't harm english natives to learn foreign languages, rises both IQ and education..."
,Doktor_Schmerz,2007-12-02T18:25Z,i use Media Player Classic for playback. i has an audio time shift function where you can enter the time shift in milliseconds an get rid of the sync problem.. great feature among other.
,jagardod,2007-12-24T19:40Z,does somebody know where you can find it in english??

So only the germs can copy the dvd for now. Since only 1% of germans can actually speak other languages than german they dubbed over it and threw the original somewhere, so theres nothing to do but wait for other dvd release -_- "

,mrwaterbuffalo,2008-02-07T05:48Z,"Anyone know of ANY subtitles for this?

I'm still gonna watch it even if I don't have any"
,antii_bergstroem,2008-02-07T14:25Z,"I've seen the movie in english, I've got it on DVD mohaha :D"
,miles87,2008-02-10T00:16Z,for god sake... please anybody who has this movie in english please please please upload it!!! i want to see this so much!!!
,lizardman666,2008-02-12T09:28Z,if you have in in english then quit being a bragging dick face & upload it.
,OmicronPerseii8,2008-03-05T09:29Z,"why dont you english speakers learn some other languages instead of whining all the time... the germans can dub whatever they damn well please, and i you don't speak german, well, too bad for you!
fucking etnocentric americans..."
,Vomiter,2008-03-05T12:55Z,"OmicronPerseii8, I support you on this to an extent. People need to stop being babies about the language and either learn it, or wait for a different copy. But randomly bringing America into it makes you look ridiculous.

English is the second most common language in the world. Im sure you can pawn this off on a number of different countries. But then again it isnt trendy to attack any place that isnt the US."
,lizardman666,2008-03-05T18:59Z,"I do speak other languages, German just sure as hell isn't one of them, and the movie was shot in english.  It's pretty retarded to suggest that someone is going to learn german so they can watch one movie.  We're talking about a movie here, and us that speak english are requesting the english version, I'm not sure why that brings out the prejudice in you, unless you are a german, then it makes a little sense"
,Odroerir,2008-03-06T12:23Z,"OK, that's enough, I'm going to try finding this one in English and upload it as well. And btw - English is third place, Spanish is second and Mandarin Chinese is of course the most popular with their overpopulation, unless I missed a new statistic.

And of course everyone should learn foreign languages, it helps understanding the function of languages, foreign cultures and therefore mankind itself. But if the chosen language is German,  English, Hindi, Icelandic or wtf ever is just not important, and noone can force you to either learn German or English or whatever just to watch one goddamn movie!"
,Ssschhhh,2008-03-07T00:09Z,"It's not a matter of knowing German or not - or even that Uwe Boll is German - this movie was MADE in ENGLISH. So it should be watched in ENGLISH. I really don't give a fuck that germans, or whatever nationality anyone may be, don't want to ""read"" their movies (which is the real reason they dub movies, not because they're stupid, or don't know english, or whatever) because if they're so fucking keen on keeping their eyes on the movie to not miss anything - why don't they see that the TALKING DOESN'T MATCH THE MOUTHS? And it's often badly mixed, you can always hear that you're not listening to the original dialogue. Oh, and if germans do know english like some people claim, then why the fuck do you still want the dub? I don't know a goddamn word of Japanese but I still watch anime subtitled. I don't know German either, and if you ever make a German movie worth watching (yeah, RIGHT) I'll watch it in German."
,joepirate2003,2008-03-07T14:52Z,"Since I live in Germany I was just contemplating renting the movie and uploading it (it was just released for rental) - but there is no english track on the DVD!!! So there still is no DVD in the world with an english track!!! Uwe Boll seems to have a very firm grip on this movie, it's even like he doesn't want us to watch it (it certainly never was screened here...)!"
,Odroerir,2008-03-08T01:54Z,"Ssschhhh, I agree with you on this one, but until now I just can't find an english version, only fakes and German ones. If there were one, I would have uploaded it already and never uploaded this one whatsoever, because I personally hate dubbing movies, too. It's just that the whole discussion here has become such a pile of bullcrap... Who cares?"
[T],LGLuX,2008-03-12T17:46Z,"Quality is good , movie is good too.

I do speak german but i guess ome jokes are just better in english"
,baab32,2008-03-19T21:58Z,i downloaded it and it wa sstill funny lol even in german
,8l4ck4c3,2008-04-02T20:32Z,"I'm dutch and I speak both english and german, still I hate almost all movies dubbed. There usually badly synched anyway. Dubbed deutsch movies make me laugh for a couple minutes then I get irrated and switch it off. 
anyways there is no need to shout at german people because they like to sync movies and this movie only happens to exist on the inet as a german dub. Hope someone with a english version is nice enough to up it :)
all im trying to say, just be nice for eachother k? ;)"
,zidern,2008-04-15T04:33Z,How about simply having both english and german audio tracks? Then everyone can be happy!
,lizzers,2008-04-15T09:19Z,haahaa - my friend is one of the machine gun girls.. i wonder how she looks dubbed in german with english subtitles!!!! too funny.

,PWNZOR,2008-06-01T16:09Z,"If u watch a dubbed movie (unless your 11 and its a cartoon) you are a dumbass. I dont know why ppl feels it right to rape a movie so hard.

And the reason that swedes speak english better then french is not becuse of schools its becuse we chat on english,listen to english songs and watch english movies.

Dubbed movies sounds and look silly. its like a muppet show."
,dttnbguy,2008-06-06T06:36Z,"dubs always suck, its only there so people who dont read very well (or cant, or are to lazy) dont BAAAWWWWW. if you can read subtitles, you will watch with subtitles.

and as for this movie, fuck boll and his habit of sticking our english track so far up his ass, he cant find it, dont blame the rippers."
