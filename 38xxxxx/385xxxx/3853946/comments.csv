,fneh6187,2008-04-03T21:48Z,Can anyone tell me what quality/bit rate these are in?
,Coversyl,2008-05-25T14:22Z,"The one track I downloaded was at 96kpbs, although audio quality sounded better than expected."
,persian92,2008-05-26T21:30Z,"seed man, please. my speed is only 2kb/s, what the fuck!"
,drumpeter,2008-05-28T20:46Z,96kbps on all the stuff I D/L'd BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
,Sanicle,2008-07-23T11:02Z,"I'm getting sick of saying this, but here we go again, clearly.

YOU'RE. GETTING. IT. FOR. FREE!!

persian92 - Be Patient!

drumpeter - Buy it yourself if you don't like the quality! Anyone with half a concience will buy the music they really like and maybe download some stuff illegally to see if they like it before going out and actually buying it! If more people thought like this then maybe the pirate bay and places liike it wouldn't be fighting the law quite so much."
,honestgreen,2008-07-23T17:13Z,"I only download to sample the music, the CD's you buy at at store sound better, and you'll be supporting the bands. and one more thing, remember to buy a Shirt from the bands website, show'em you love em and wanna support'em. thanks for the Torrent Andy! ROCK ON!"
,Drunk_Mexican,2008-08-05T00:41Z,"You aren't supporting the band when you buy CDs fag-bag. You are supporting the Record company fuck over places like Piratebay. If you really want to support the band go to their concerts.

Thank you for the torrent andy.

Stick it to the man!"
,Marroe,2008-08-10T17:34Z,"well, i dont belive ozzy needs any more money anyway. so lets just download and be happy. i recomend buying the cds anyway tough."
,blahablahablaha,2008-08-16T00:43Z,"Its only the album ""The Essential Ozzy Osbourne"" thats 96kbps, the rest is 128kbps"
,TheFrisk,2008-09-02T21:00Z,SEED FUCKING RETARD!
,WizHole,2008-09-11T19:44Z,STOP CRYING TheFrisk AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT YOURSELF!!!
,cheeto24,2008-12-15T00:37Z,I'm so tired of hearing about how I should buy this sh1t instead of downloading it... for one... i'm poor... two... the artists only see pennies for each CD sold.. they make their real money from tickets and merchendise... so if you really want to support a band... download their music and then go buy a ticket to a live show... and if you think otherwise... maybe you shouldn't be on a torrent site.
,cheeto24,2008-12-15T00:38Z,@ Drunk_Mexican - it's good to see someone else out there that knows how it is.  Keep on Keepin on...
,libia,2009-05-09T19:24Z,"Thank you so much for this torrent. I had tried a few others but didn't succeed.

Thank you Andy"

100% Agreed. I have the entire Ozzy Collection, but I just want the mp3's so that I can put them on my iPod instead of having to rip all those damn cd's, lol."
,Graadrich,2009-05-31T06:52Z,"IDK what ppl's issues with downloading are, i downloaded this file at about 900 kb/s, yes, 900 not 90. so maybe its your fault your dl is slow idk."
,cimino15,2009-06-15T09:53Z,"@Graadrich they're talking about the bit rate for the music not the download rate of the torrent.


Dummy."
,.Unlt,2009-06-29T12:24Z,"Good torrent, been looking for an Ozzy discography, once im done ill seed for a while."
,Rathyas,2009-07-05T10:51Z,"Ah, yay. Great Torrent. Thanks!~"
,BigDawg030,2009-07-16T19:15Z,this torrent was terrible yea i got it for free but when the songs skip and are half corrupted i say screw this DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TORRENT DOWNLOAD THIS FROM ANOTHER SITE!!!!
,lovntorrent,2010-01-31T01:26Z,"Man this was tagged perfectly, my only problem is track 8 on speak of the devil, it won't let me put it into the album, it wont let me edit it either, other than that every album was perfect & MANY THANKS andyguitar !!!!!!  99.9% perfect torrent, i will proudly seed :)"
,enriquejones666,2010-04-12T09:22Z,"FYI - This is a repost of torrent posted in 2004 (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3229844/Ozzy.Osbourne.Discography#filelistContainer), so don't expect super high fidelity in these mp3's.
128 Kbps was typical for CD rips back then, and mp3 encoders were not quite as good as they are today."
,Jimself,2010-07-04T01:32Z,it's great. will seed
,ljs9108,2011-09-01T04:21Z,"THNX 4 THE UP ANDYGUITAR
What freakin' difference does it make what the bit rate is? This digital shit will never sound as good as when they used to scratch it on wax. Just download the stuff and be thankful you got something for nothing. I'm sick of these freakin' whiners."
