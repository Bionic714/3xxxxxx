,cryptobones,2007-12-11T08:27Z,"i only need this for one car, do you have to install all 10 repair disks or can you just install one? If you can, can someone tell me which one has info for a 1992 Dodge Spirit? thanks"
,41ph4514ck3r,2008-01-03T05:45Z,"does ne1 know if this program expires and is unusable after a period of time? i was told that the actual program is useless after a few months and a new version with updates have to be purchased in order to continue usage... Also, if this program does not expire, can future prices be updated manually in the program without installing new software? 
Thanx"
,uhorra,2008-01-07T22:30Z,"This program does not expire. It does not update, thus you need to download newer versions as newer cars come out. This version covers from 2007 to 1983. Cryptobones, the first disk covers the 1992 Dodge Spirit and you also need the install disk."
,41ph4514ck3r,2008-01-10T23:14Z,Thnx uhorra -- any idea how often newer versions will need to be downloaded or will be made available? 
,uhorra,2008-01-13T04:11Z,"Mitchell comes out every quarter, this download is the first quarter of 2007. Since this is a real big file, once a year is good enough for me. The older car info (1983 - 2005) stays the same so they usually only update the new car (2006 - 2007) information. "
,A 65,2008-01-13T22:38Z,Just a little question. HOW do I install this. Are there any installation files that you forgot? All the files looks the same but with different size. Help please.
,uhorra,2008-01-16T02:42Z,You need to download the installation disk here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3862018 . 
,A 65,2008-01-16T18:20Z,Thanks Uhorra.

,drummerbouy,2008-01-22T22:56Z,I'm assuming i need dual layer dvds for the data dvds????
,uhorra,2008-01-23T13:00Z,"I copied the iso images to my hard drive and used a program called virtual drive http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3961653/Virtual_Drive ,that acts like you have multiple cd/dvd drives. Then I loaded the Mitchell iso images and directed the Mitchell program to look for them on the virtual drives."
,colowgio,2008-01-24T00:10Z,i need to get the manager plus for mitchell on demand 2007 can anyone help me please anyone have a link for it?
,tperk004,2008-01-26T10:13Z,HELP! The install disk will not work. Am I missing something. Windows says it can not open the file. 
,jgram69,2008-01-26T16:12Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3996833
""no install""\portable torrent here for those who cant get the install to work."
,jgram69,2008-01-26T16:54Z,"uhora... you can also mount the iso's then copy and   
paste to folders ""repair1"",""repair2"",etc. and no need to run the virtual drives."
,uhorra,2008-01-28T04:19Z,Thanks jgram69 for the info.
,thedude808,2008-01-29T22:27Z,shit! beat me to it.
,drummerbouy,2008-01-31T08:35Z,"Nice! thanks... oh another thing, when i click on a ""figure 1"" in the program, an error message comes up saying ""Unable to extract file, Extract Error code: 2)... did i do something wrong? it's the right dvd maybe i need to use a different program to mount?"
,drummerbouy,2008-01-31T16:12Z,"Nevermind, the problem was the way i mounted it... i mounted the image file with winmount and lots of stuff didn't work, then i used virtualdrive like those other guys said.... here's virtualdrive pro w/serial:

,Shooter3k,2008-02-23T21:39Z,"EVERYONE PLEASE NOTE: If you are getting errors after a successful install such as the following: 

Unable to extract file. 
Extract Error code: 2 

The figure file does not exist. 

DynaZip UnZIP Error: 
ZIP file read error! 

This means that you probably linked to the already extracted iso data on your hard drive. In my experience this does not work and you need to mount the ISO's as a drive.  

A super easy program to mount the ISO's can be found here: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/620/xp_small_free_way_to_use_and_mount_images_iso_files_without_burning_them"

Also, the crack did not appear on the install program.  Anyone else have problems with this and how do I get the account number.
