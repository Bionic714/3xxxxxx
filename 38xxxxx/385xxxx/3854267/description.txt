Both were part of PROJECT TALENT, an unacknowledged MK-ULTRA military program. Controller and soldier? Their relationship is unclear. Two men from vastly different backgrounds have come together as friends only to discover what brings them together may be far more mysterious and sinister than either is prepared to remember. [towards the end of the vid, a weird thing happens, a 'physic pulse' is fired at the house and both interviewees pick up on it]

Dan Burisch Revisited - Stargate Secrets
Whatever you currently know or don't know about Dan's experiences, we think you will find it of significant interest.

Dan goes into great detail about both the technology and the politics of the Stargates and the Looking Glass. He also discusses the 'Cube', which may or may not be the same device as the fabled 'Yellow Book', or the 'Black Box' reported by our important witness Henry Deacon...  more - http://www.projectcamelot.org/dan_burisch.html

Gary McKinnon - Hacking the Pentagon
Gary is lucid, eloquent and extremely intelligent. He is currently facing "fast track" extradition to the USA for hacking into 97 United States military and NASA computers in 2001/2002. He made it clear that the real reason the Americans want to extradite him is not for any damage he has done, as there wasn't any. They are pursuing him because of what he might have seen. Specifically, documents revealing a list of "Non-terrestrial officers" and off-world cargo operations somewhere out in space, hinting at the real possibility of military activities taking place in relation to other planets... more - http://www.projectcamelot.net/gary_mckinnon.html

Jim Sparks - The Keepers
Jim Sparks has become well-known as one of the few multiple abductees who has 95% recall of all his experiences. Having been abducted many hundreds of times, he rebelled and refused to co-operate with the aliens who repeatedly took him to their craft. He attributes his recall of memories to this rage and his outrage over the continued abductions and violations. Jim gradually seemed to become trusted by the aliens - who he calls The Keepers - to assist them in increasingly significant ways. In turn, he understands better now what their agenda and modus operandi might be. The story he tells on camera is spellbinding... more - http://projectcamelot.org/jim_sparks.html

Marcia has taken the old paradigm and refashioned it to bring new insights into innovation and the world of business.
