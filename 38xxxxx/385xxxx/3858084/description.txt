Municipal waste are an amazing band, proper thrash metal!!!!!

from wikipedia:

The Art of Partying is the title of Virginia crossover thrash band Municipal Waste's third full-length release, released on June 11, 2007, through Earache Records. A limited edition version was also released at the same time, containing two bonus tracks and including a free woven patch.

All songs written by Municipal Waste. Tracks 16 & 17 are bonus tracks on the limited edition version of the album. The track "Mental Shock" is subtitled "(Death Ripper Part II)" in the liner notes, and is presumably a continuation of the song "Death Ripper" from Hazardous Mutation. "Born to Party" is a rerecorded version of the song that appeared on an early split 7", and is probably intentionally 4:20 long. Much like the previous two Municipal Waste albums, the last song (on the regular version), "Born to Party", contains a joke hidden track after a period of silence; a recording of the band performing a song in a radically different genre from the rest of their output.

The cover is a visual representation of the song Chemically Altered.
