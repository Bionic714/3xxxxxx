,sourgrapes,2007-10-22T00:18Z,"Would love to see it mate, but if it is mkv it be a waste of time for me."
,redchameleon,2007-10-22T00:32Z,The mkv is merely a container; the underlying video format is Xvid.  A codec pack like K-lite installs everything required to view the file (why the original author chose mkv is beyond me...)
,Headinajar,2007-10-24T14:44Z,So this is a Xvid packed in a mkv? Isn't it a h264? Do you have the original nfo?
,redchameleon,2007-11-07T04:13Z,"Sorry about the false advertising, but you are right that it is indeed h264 (I checked the files with GSpot).  I thought mpeg4 was mpeg4, but according to wikipedia, xvid (mpeg4 part 2) and h264 (mpeg4 part 10) are totally different.

On the plus side, you should have no trouble watching this on a PC.  If you had other plans (such as an xvid-compatible DVD player) you might be out of luck."
,homericICON,2007-12-05T14:49Z,"Well I'm gonna get this thing anyways as I have my HDTV hooked up directly to my Computer. But I really fail to understand why people encode to oddball codecs such as h264 or VP7.
Even if they are technically superior, DivX/XviD is the defacto standard for standalone players. I have made the XviD 1.2SMP Codec installer available here... http://www3.sympatico.ca/jtrenholm/XviD-1.2.-127-25022006.exe"
,thehaj,2007-12-13T15:59Z,Is this the whole series or just first episode?
,redchameleon,2007-12-28T07:23Z,"By ""whole series"", do you mean both episodes?  This torrent is the entire ""Race to Mars"" broadcast, but does not include the companion ""Mars Rising""."
,amontoth,2008-04-03T23:00Z,"it 4 1hr episodes or 2 2 hr airings, depending on channel.
