,antmartain,2010-12-07T03:33Z,"I bought this game on Steam, it's got to be one of the most underrated shooters of all time....the repetitive enemies are a shame, but the story, visuals, and gameplay more than make up for them. Clive Barker is a motherfreakin genius."

,timmyns,2011-06-11T23:00Z,"Can someone make a full tutorial. I extraced the flt-jeri.001 with WinRAR, but when I tried to mount the power iso it said there is no data on the file. And when I tried to run the instalation it said to turn other programs so I turned everything off and it still wouldn't work."
,elnino316,2011-07-31T08:01Z,"hey buddies..this torrent is perfect.The crack is in 'fairlight' folder...
1)extract the file flt-jeri.001....i used 7-zip to extract
2)you will get an iso image file
3)mount this iso (with daemon tools) and install the game
4)copy crack from 'fairlight' folder of iso image and paste it in 'bin' folder....C:\Program Files\Codemasters\Clive Barker's Jericho\bin
5)play the game!

if you are unable to extract,then probably the download is corrupted...re-download the torrent and try again."
