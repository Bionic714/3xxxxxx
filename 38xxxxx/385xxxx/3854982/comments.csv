,KINGLOAD,2007-12-15T21:50Z,thanks 4 the upload...... anyone know where i can get war from with will smith in ?? 
,KINGLOAD,2007-12-21T08:32Z,i have downloaded this and it's not in english wot a waste 
,OrpheusDude,2008-07-06T01:34Z,This is a DivX file.  The program I have to convert torrents into DVDs (ImgBurn) does not support this kind of file.  This is the first time I am having this problem - it converts every other kind of file I've downloaded.  I can't find any freeware to convert DivX to DVD (or even to .avi).  Any suggestions?
,OrpheusDude,2008-07-06T01:37Z,"To KINGLOAD: Play the DivX file on VLC Media player (free).  Right-click and you will get a full DVD menu, including audio output.  Click on the second option and you will get the English audio."
,Suusel,2008-12-11T18:29Z,"it took me a while to figur this out.. but OrpheusDude is right!!
To get the English version:
- Start the movie (in VLC Media Player)
- Right click
- Choose in the 3th Colom the First option
- And select the other 'audio' (one is alreddy selected)

Tadaaaahh... the Deutch is gone, and welcome English =D

(sorry for my bad english, i hope you understand)"
