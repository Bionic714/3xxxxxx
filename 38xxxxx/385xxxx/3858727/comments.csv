,erik1099,2007-11-27T19:57Z,"Well...we're stuck at 71%, the tracker shows a seed but it's not showing up in my listings on Azureus and based on how the torrent is stopped, somethings not right..."
,erik1099,2007-11-28T02:07Z,"Hmm.. now there is a very slow trickle. My ports are open, I'm uploading at 35k. Azureus is giving me a green light. I guess I must be more patient!"
,erik1099,2007-12-02T09:38Z,"Well, its 3 days later and we're up to 88.7%; if another seeder could help that would be great... I watched disk 1, thanks Rubicon for upping these. What I don't get is why Razor is coming out on dvd before season 3..."
