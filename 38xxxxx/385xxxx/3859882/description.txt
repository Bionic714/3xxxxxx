Overview: "Cheetah On Fire" is a by-the-numbers thriller about government agents tracking down an errant arms dealer, culminating in a raid on the arms dealer's outpost in the southeast Asian jungle. The action is mostly gunplay but is enlivened by some solid kung fu action performed by hero Donnie Yen ("SPL") and a quartet of memorable villains led by Gordon Liu ("Shaolin Master Killer"). The highlight is a fight between Donnie and Gordon, represending two generations of kung fu stars.
