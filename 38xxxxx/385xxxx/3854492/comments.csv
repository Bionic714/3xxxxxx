,420dopeman,2007-10-24T16:55Z,"ok little update.
This is an ENGLISH only rip. IF you have trouble with the language, or find it challenging to edit a file with notepad, plz. d/l a different version.

Also, there is a game bug affecting random users where the game will not save your edits, this is a Konami game bug, NOT a rip bug. 
You can read more on comments of the full installed game here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3853339

I will fix this when Konami fixes it.

,sadox,2007-11-11T06:27Z,"having played the fifa series for a long time.. i decided to dl pes 2008, just to check it out. but after playing it for some time, i really knew that fifa 08 was way much better. here are some reasons why pes 2008 sucks
-first, from the beginning, the menu is so shitty. it takes a long time to get to another selection.
-they have a few small selection of stadiums.
-they use only adidas products
-all soccer balls and boots are adidas, and they still have a small variety.(fifa 08, uses adidas, nike, puma, and diadora procuts.
-players like Rooney, ronaldinho, and roque santa cruz and many others do not have their trademark boots...instead they use shitty ""pes"" boots.
-lots of teams including manchester united do not have proper uniforms... ie. manU is called manu red, and their crest is very different. it took me for ever to find them.
at the beginning, national teams do not sing their anthems.
-the songs are very crappy compared to fifa08.
-there is no ""restart match"" option in the menu while playing a game.
-it takes too long to load 
-the chants of the crouds are very cheap.
-fewer leagues.
-the looks of the players look very different. (i couldnt tell who some players were)
-there is no live podcast type thing. fifa 08 has a espn podcast that turns on when connected to the internet.
-and of course the gameplay is worse.

overall, pes 2008 sucks compared to fifa08.
it is a waste of almost 4G.
plz feel free to add anything i missed.

........FIFA 08!
"
,Speedylunar,2007-11-11T15:23Z,"Sadox, I totally agree with you, I can't see why some game mags think PES is better than Fifa. I also want to add this:

The devellopers were too lazy to replace the Xbox-360 controls, buttons and control setup menu with a normal keyboard. I don't know what A, B, X, Y etc. is on my keyboard, and I don't wanna know! I wanna play with a game that tells me A=shoot, D=pass, E=sprint etc.

They also didn't add widescreen at high ress and no real advanced settings, which is plain stupid.

Downloading this game was a waste of time. I would like to thank Dopeman for making the torrent, he can't help it that this game is bad either. Fifa 08 torrent, here I come ;)"
,wastedtalent,2007-11-14T10:32Z,"sadox what the hell are you going on about? go back to fifa which has never had as much realism or proper gameplay like pes or winning eleven.

stadiums aren't all there? so what, do you spend your entire game looking at the ground?...

music is shit... yeah ok fair enough it isn't great.. never has been really.

how the hell did it take you ages to find man utd? man red, can't say its very difficult is it?! Can you guess who man blue are ;o)

You've just listed a load of stuff that we all know EA are good at, menus, music etc, where the real deal is about the gameplay, althou fifa 08 is improved (they just took a load of ideas from PES and stuck it in 08, I mean, look at all the previous FIFAs; shoot from anywhere outside the box and its pretty much a guaranteed goal) its still not like PES, where you have to play like the team does in real life to get anywhere. I don't think the ball is weighted rightly in PES7 but its leaps and bounds ahead of FIFA in gameplay terms.

Oh yeah and whoever was whinging about dopeman ripping what is apparently a shitty game, rip it urself you wanker!! hah."
,tukbriz,2007-11-14T19:56Z,"Cheers DopeMan, thanks for your efforts...

In my place if you ever compare fifa to pes,you will be humiliated,and in some gamehouses,even thrown out. fifa is for youngsters.it does not give you the kind or feel pes gives. No one ever talks about fifa.EVER."
,nilpferdkoenig,2007-11-21T22:31Z,"sadox: more than half of the things that you don't like are because Konami doesn't have the licences for all that stuff.
I like FIFA more too.

@ReaperManT:

You don't really believe that any producer would be stupid enought to place his games on Blu-Rays and HDDVDs, right (except for PS3 games)?

Nobody knows which format is gonna win and it will not be decided until like 2009! 

Crysis has some bad ass textures and fits onto a DVD if it's compressed. WTF should I use a 30 Blu-Ray DVD for that and pay 200? for the player if I can burn it on a 4? DVD with a 20? player?

Games will not be coming out on Blu Ray or HDDVD until 2012 is what I say. 

Just my two cents.^^"

Here is what i did:
I extract it to C:\Program Files\PES2008\Pro Evolution Soccer 2008.
After that i download http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3856908.
From this one i got, regsetup.exe and regsetup (text document) In the regsetup (text document) i placed:
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\KONAMI]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\KONAMI\PES2008]

C:\Program Files\\PES2008\\Pro Evolution Soccer 2008"" thats the place i extract it. You can place it anywere else.
So now i place the regsetup.exe and regsetup (text document) in the folder were i extract. Now you ready for playing, just double click on PES2008.exe
Hope it works."

a answer til you who says: fifa is much better than pes....

The company who makes fifa has a much higher budget than the company who makes pes! But when you were playing pes, you will se that when you`re in the game/match, pes is a much better GAME than fifa. The best thing with fifa it`s all the elements around the game ; )"

You dont need to ""install"" just run from the game folder.
You cant patch unless there is a specific dopeman patch.
You cant play online unless you use a private server.
You will need to install directx and /or ageis phsyx which will be included.
Files sizes are smaller because the game has been specially hacked to reduce size. (movies etc re-encoded)

I recommend playing on Regular or Hard (if you consider yourself good at sports games) right from the start if you don't want it to be too easy.
The difficulty level is kinda low, I remember  PES 5 and 6 as being much harder.
