Yes there is 1 wallaper but there are also the 9 working keys in it.

Please some of you write a comment to confirm, to shut the fucker up.
The rar file has been downloaded over 500 times already and no one else complained
exept from Mr Buttface called ""ShareAll"""

,Justlittleoldme.,2007-10-30T17:32Z,Only one key and it's blacklisted.
,dsrs,2007-10-30T19:12Z,"this is time-wasters heaven
how dumb do you think kaspersky is
if you put the keys here all they have to do is download them and blacklist them
so kav works for like five days on any one key\
either pay or get a free av
stop wasting your time"
