,DeHawk89,2007-12-02T21:31Z,I dont get any txt7subs....help
,ilive4harleys,2007-12-04T22:05Z,DeHawk89 the instructions are included in the folder. Read the read me first file and it gives you everything you need to know whether you are on a Mac or a PC. I have no problem at all getting the subtitles.  Follow the directions and you will not have any problems either. Or you can just go the easiest route and learn Cantonese and/or Mandarin. They are simple languages to learn.
,ilive4harleys,2007-12-04T22:08Z,"btw JamesKees, thank you for a wonderful upload. I have the DVD but it is dubbed and even though Jackie Chan does the dubbing of his own voice, I hate dubbed movies. Well done on the upload, the very explicit and simple to follow instructions for the subtitles and the clarity of the picture not to mention how to convert the format to record to a DVD. 
Thank you again James. You sir, are a gentleman and a scholar :-)"

Desperate to escape this brutal teacher's cruel regime, he flees but is confronted, humiliated and beaten senseless by a hired assassin whose really name is Hwang Jang lee. Now Fei Hung is hungry for revenge, ashamed and very angry returns to his drunken master....For more information go to wing-chunws/Drunken%20Master.html"
