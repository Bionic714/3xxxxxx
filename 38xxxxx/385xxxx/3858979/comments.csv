,keykeeper,2007-12-13T23:50Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this, dyspersis!
But it'd be nice if someone could help me... The music does not work for some reason that I can't quite figure out. It keeps showing this message: ""Script executing error. File[bgm_02.wav] could not be opened"" ... It doesn't do this with just a few songs either, it does this with every single one.

So.. Help? Anyone else had this problem yet?"
,Raynor_Foxhound,2008-01-29T10:00Z,"I appreciate the upload as well but am saddened to say that I, too, suffer the same problem as keykeeper. For all musics involved, it reads that ""Script Executing Error. File [bgm_xx.wav] could not be opened.""

Voices and visuals are fine as far as I can tell, but the music seems to be the only issue. I would appreciate any advice on how to fix this problem.

Again, many thanks for the upload and I hope this can get resolved soon."
,pansytook,2008-02-06T13:33Z,your games work great for me! Do you take requests? : )
,pandemonium06,2008-02-18T19:47Z,"I've installed it, but when I try to play the game it starts off with a black screen and does not load.  Am I doing something wrong? "
,leanntwilight,2008-04-10T05:51Z,"I've had this problem on a previous game.  I'm still downloading it but it seems they have included the files for you.  Look in the download folder...you should see two or three files with ARC extensions. (BGM, VOICE, etc.) These are the audio files that the game is looking for. Copy these and place them into the game folder located in program files.  

I hope it helps.  "

,velvetbird,2008-12-07T12:34Z,"Thanks for sharing this wonderfully brutal game! I'm enjoying it so far, starts a little slow but the characters designs are nice and the concept is good. Loaded fine for me. "
,xprisonicfairytalex,2008-12-13T07:25Z,"The Black Screen of Death has appeared for me as well.
._. Did I install it wrong?

Halp."
,xCamyx,2009-02-03T10:22Z,"For those who have problems with a blank screen, just go to Program Files -> Langmaor and delete Op.  I've had this happened with Absolute Obedience.  

It's only the intro movie anyway.  Nothing exciting really.

After you do that, play the game and even when it says ""cannot find [whatever]"" you can still play it."
,xCamyx,2009-02-03T10:43Z,"Whoops, I meant the folder Will, not langmaor."
,EroNaruto,2009-02-08T23:54Z,more yaoi in http://narutoyaoi.com
[T],Hgames,2009-03-19T20:28Z,I actually have this game uploaded and it's a PROPER release. Perfect copy of the cd and everything is working including the music. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4784204/Enzai_-_Falsely_Accused
,kurpanya,2009-11-27T07:11Z,I'm probably the stupidest person out there but how do you download this game? I have no idea where to go.
,debunny,2009-12-13T23:03Z,"I'm having a problem where after installing it, whenever I try running it a error box pops up and says the Direct Draw failed.
Does anyone know what I should do?"
,estazolam0086,2010-01-06T17:39Z,"I delete the Op. and it still doesn't work +_+......
Just keep getting black screen when I start.
Somebody help me!"
,savageb,2010-02-19T05:37Z,"When I try to run the enzai.exe application, it says ""Registry Error"" and closes. I tried deleting the OP but that didn't work. What's up?"
,uwahhhh,2010-07-01T01:22Z,"if you get a registry error when you try to run enzai.exe, you probably forgot to install the game. just run the setup and you should be fine."
,love811010,2010-12-25T00:44Z,"Oh no i treied running the Setup and it shows 'Illegal setting up information'!
What do i do?"
,SnM_fairy,2011-06-12T03:45Z,will the game work on a mac?
