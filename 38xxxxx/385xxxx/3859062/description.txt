Instructions:-

Like you need me to tell you! Get Nero, Or MagicISO or whatever you want to burn ISO's with, and burn the two ISO's.
Next install the EZ DRUMMER VSTi software but DO NOT apply any patches at this stage.  Next, go in to each relevant expansion folder and install them all one by one.
Once you've done that, THEN apply the patches and use the Keygen provided in the Patch folder once you run the software (via Cubase etc). In other words, when you load Cubase and choose EZ Drummer as your VSIi, it'll ask you to authorise it.  Use the keygen and guide provided.  That's it!
