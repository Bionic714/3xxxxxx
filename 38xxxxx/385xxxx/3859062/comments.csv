I am sorry if my seeding is slow.  I hae tried searching the internet and I can't seem to find a reason for why I'm seeding so slowly.  My firewall and router is set up as it should be.

,FTF96,2007-11-06T22:30Z,"Guys, I created the file, so no one else has 100% of it.  I'm sorry its slow, I have asked you all for help, but no one responded.  I am seeding 24/7 to help, but if you're gonna be rude, I'll just stop.  I created these ISO's myself to help you all out.  There are other versions out there, but they have corrupt archives so if you can actually spare the time to be patient, it is worth it.

I have torrents that people just wont seed, and it's predicted I'll get them in a month.  It sucks, but it happens.  Everyone is responsible.  If you cap your speed, you know you're doing it and if you're doing it, someone's doing it to you.  You all know this.  My ports are open, firewall is configured, router configured, uTorrent configured, there's nothing else I know how to do.  So if anyone NOW wants to volunteer to help me sort this out, please don't hold back.

,kdubbs89,2007-11-07T05:19Z,"Hey FTF don't worry about people getting impatient, you clearly explained that you are doing all that you can.  All of us really do appreciate your offering.  You have got a ton of people pretty excited (know i am).  
As far as your speeds go it sounds like you are doing the right things (ports!).  Wish I could help beyond that but its all I know.  My only other suggestion is that you could walk the file over to a friends with an external hd and have them seed too.  I guess you would have to associate the file on their computer with the existing torrent somehow, I can't help there either.  Wish I could.  
Not that you should feel obligated to do that, your efforts so far have been great.
Once the full file is out there this won't be a problem anyway.  I'm patient.

Really just wanted to say thanks.."

Is there anyone that can help me? Or should I try a different software? If anyone would care to do this step by step I'd be very greatful =)"
,kdubbs89,2007-11-19T10:05Z,"garfen666:  vst plugins go in the vst plugins folder set by programs that use vst.  mine is c:\programfiles\steinberg\vstplugins cause i use cubase.  find yours.  Vegas should have a path somewhere in the audio/vst settings.  
ez installs to its own install folder and puts a ezdrummer.dll in the vstplugins folder.  then you wil see it.
When you install ez tell the installer where the vstplugins folder is.  (vegas takes vst right??)

To all:  This is working for me except the twisted and clausterphobic kits which show but don't load anyone solved this?

there is a ezdrummer.dll somewhere in there (plugins folder?)  get that and replace the one in the vstplugins folder with the one from the download.  then you can use the keygen etc.   also, when the installer says it cant find files from the drumkit from hell pack just skip them (its only 4 samples).  Hope that helps!"

I also had someone from another country pay me to send the two disks to him so he didn't have to download them and they work for him too.  If you're having problems its not related to my torrent at all."
,TTTONY,2007-11-21T16:04Z,"OK OK , I SHALL ANSWER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS :

1:  to get Nashville to work ,first you must update EZ drummer to 1.1 version  (it is a torrent 20 mb if you don't have it search internet)   and then you must install Nashville

2: Twisted has got problems ,try to get it from someone else 
      or find a keygen if that is what is needed

3: DFH is missing 2-3 snare samples but you could ignore them or download it from elsewhere if you want.


to get EZ working , copy-paste  ezdrummer.dll  (search in first DVD for  PLUG , open it)  in your sequencer's VSTI folder where you shall see one or more .dll files already in that folder. Choose EZ drummer as a VSTI instrument through your sequencer (like choosing a piano plugin or guitar etc)

That's it ! . More questions means that you don't have an idea for sequencers , well try searching and reading yourselves dudes, i can't help you all.

,gn0m0n,2007-12-18T19:16Z,"So: mostly this works great for me.  

Stopzilla did identify malware ""Zxx"" in the Nashville and Claustrophobic keygens, but it may be false positive as I've heard that cracks can do that.  Anyway, I used them and then did a full scan and removed threats.  

For some reason the updates were not working for me, perhaps because I already had the original program installed, but anyway there is a small ~20 MB torrent out there with an update to 1.1 that worked for me.  After using that I could load the Nashville, Claustrophobic, and Twisted kits.

Unfortunately, as a couple people said, there does not seem to be any keygen for the Twisted Kit here :(  And I have not yet been able to find one that works.  There are a few torrents out there that are supposedly just that but both of the ones I've gotten have turned out to be corrupt zip archives.

Drums from Hell is missing 3 or 4 samples.  But COME ON, 3 or 4 samples out of thousands ain't bad!  :)  And besides you probably won't really notice them too much because they're all stereo sampled, i.e., you should have the left channel snare sample, just not the right.  And it's only the top-mic snare, so the bottom-mic channel is there for both left and right.

Haven't had ""grog"" turn up but I will do a thorough scan now to be sure.  

**If anyone finds a working Twisted keygen, please please please post a link here!!!!***

Thanks FTF!  If you have a twisted keygen and just forgot to include it, can you please post?

Also you don't need to burn them if you have virtual ROM's. When you install it. If you have more than one piece of music software. Don't get frustrated if you can't find it. It might have installed itself in another program. Just run a search for the EZDrummer.dll, and it will show you what program and where it was installed so that way you can share it:)"

,2Dogs_Studio,2008-07-20T15:08Z,"Hi FTF96,
EZ Drummer installed fine and so did Cocktail. The rest of them wouldn't.  (The PKG files wouldn't open) So I installed the update for Mac and ran the KeyGen in XP.  By the way, EZ Drummer won't work with Garageband but it does with CuBase.  I ran CuBase entered the auth code produced but it won't work. Computer ID AAQZH-HTVF3-CY2.  Is there a new KeyGen kicking around perhaps that would work.  Any tips would be great. Tks mate,     "
,2Dogs_Studio,2008-07-20T19:26Z,"Hey folks, YOU'LL WANT TO READ THIS ONE. I GOT THINGS TO WORK.  HERE'S HOW:

Finally got things to work (to a point [got audio issues in CuBase now]). Thanks FTF96 for posting btw.  Very nice of you indeed.

Ok, tips for MAC users like me.  I'm Running OSX 10.4. was not having any luck in Mac OS. The authorization codes kept failing in Garageband and CuBase LE.  Got EZ to install from a torrent at http://www.chilewarez.org/index.php?showtopic=217326    BUT couldn't get the code to work.  So I downloaded FTF's package and went from there.

So I tried this full compilation on the Mac and that failed on several levels.  Other than EZ and Cocktail nothing else would unpack properly and the code wouldn't work in the end when Garageband sometimes recognized the plugin.

I then installed the whole thing again but in XP this time using VMWare Fusion on my MAC and using CuBase LE. I followed every step given by FTF96 and YOU MUST ALSO replace the DLL file once everything is installed including the updates.  The DLL file is located in the PLUG.Cab file which is in the EZ Drummer Install/PC folder. 

Right at the end the auth code failed again and instead of trashing the house and doing burnouts in front of my neighbor's house, I decided to DISABLE my network connection without closing CuBase or the EZ Drummer plugin.  To my shock and surprise the EZ Drummer plugin automatically recognized the change in hardware configuration and generated a new Computer ID#.  So I opened the KeyGen and it too recognized the new Computer ID on its own (or maybe it was a fluke) and it gave me a new authorization code.  THAT one WORKED.    All the expansion packs are there and they work too.  I scanned the whole thing with several antivirus packs including Norton and its good to go.

Give that a try.  I did get a Mac version to install on the Mac yesterday from ChileWarez.org but couldn't get the code to work.  I'll try again in the Mac with no network connection and will let you know what happens.

Good luck,  "

I've used this program before (a different torrent a while ago, and I lost the files) with Cubase so I know my way around it, but I have no sound in EZDrummer, both the Default kit and the Drumkit from Hell are completely silenced. When I click on the drums nothing happens except some lag.. And clicking play on any file in the grove list has no effect neither.

Any idea what might be wrong? By the way, it may be worth noting that EZDrummer never asked for a key to be registered with when launched for the first time!"

First of all, download this update:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3815569/EZ-Drummer_Update_1.1.1_-_PC_and_MAC_(Universal_Binary)

Install it, then you need to make your virus checker exclude your VST plugin folder from being scanned. I noticed if I disabled my virus checker, I could click on Twisted and it'd ask me for the code, instead of crashing.

You can get the Twisted keygen from this torrent:

,Leenix20,2009-03-20T19:40Z,"I finally found the solution guys :) To Vista and XP 64 or 32 bit.

1) Get this torrent. It is Zipped up all it needs is just to extract, and as small as hell, no more downloading those bullshit 1gb Cubase Torrents.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4212016/Cubase_Studio_4.1.1_by_Antony_GR_(Portable___Non-Install_version


Then go here and Download the Asio4all Driver.
It wil Reduce Latency on Which All Midi Works.
Meaning if you use Ezdrummer as a trigger for your Electric Drums and have 1 Second delays, this is a MUST. Even if you dont have Edrums YOU MUST INSTALL IT.
http://www.asio4all.com/


Now for Ezdrummer.
Get this Torrent, it Includes Both the Ezdrummer Installation and the Drumkit from Hell which is 100 times better than the standard Ezdrummer Kit.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4565497/ToontrackEZdrummer1.1.1-Mac-and-PC-with-DKFH-Full_with_Serial



And Finally update Ezdrummer with this Patch, it will add a couple of new features in Ezdrummer and make a noticable sound fix to your drums.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3815569/EZ-Drummer_Update_1.1.1_-_PC_and_MAC_(Universal_Binary)



No more need to look here and there for shitty torrents that dont work on Vista. THIS IS THE SOLUTION FINALLY."

,dbackagain,2010-12-16T22:50Z,"I'm fairly new to torrents, but this torrent installation was fairly easy to deal with.  

I'm on a Mac-Snow Leopard, download this torrent, and installation is a breeze.

Once you install the main plug-in, make sure to go through all updates and install them too.

I couldn't find a way to open the Keygen program from the Mac (Like I said, I'm fairly new to torrents and Macs in general), so I just copied the Keygen to my flash drive, open it up on my PC, and presto, the keygen works like a charm).

But open up the Ez Drummer from your DAW, and this will cause the program to authorize itself.  Switch to the PC, enter in the information, and it will activate.  I was a little worried about all of the comments about the Keygen not working, and I can say, I got everything to work without a hitch.

I believe I had to find another torrent of the update to 1.2 in order for Logic 9 to see Ez Drummer.  Basically, just trust in the torrent, and it should set you free.

Good luck."

,skizotom,2011-07-05T11:12Z,"How to Install on a Mac!!!!!

For the expansions:

The MAC installers don't work so it has to be installed manually. make sure you've installed EZdrummer first. If it hasn't created the following folders you may need to run it before continuing.

Drag the EZX_Percussion (or whichever expansion you're trying to install) from inside Install/PC/EZHOME into Library/Application Support/EZDrummer

Then drag the files inside 'Midi' to Library/Application Support/EZDrummer/Midi

Start up your Sequencer and when any authorisers come up copy the challenge code and run the authorisers on a friends PC. 

Note the Twisted Authoriser is missing so you'll have to find that somewhere else. Also I couldn't get the Claustrophobic keygen to work.

Happy Drumming

,nemo3,2011-07-06T13:14Z,"Thanks ""shizotom"" for the infos, here is how I proceed:

1- I get in the EZ-DRUMMER PROGRAM folder, than to the Toontrack DFH EZ drummer VSTi than to the install folder, than to the MAC folder I click on the EZdrummer installer.mpkg. By ow I've installed EZdrummer and the folder is been created under applicationsupport, applicationsupport/EZdrummer. 
2- I install cocktail by clicking on the EZX cocktail installer.pkg, so cocktail is installed under applicationsupport/EZdrummer/EZX_cocktail
3-I did what you suggested and moved the files firslty the drumkit from hell expanson from inside Install/PC/EZHOME into Library/Application Support/EZDrummer, than 
dragged the files inside 'Midi' to Library/Application Support/EZDrummer/Midi than repeated this last step for the remaining expansion in the .iso2 as well.

If you're installing it as a VSTi that'd be your problem. Logic uses Audio Units (AU). You may need to find another installer. They are out there ;)

If you have infact installed as AU, check the Audio Units Manager (Logic Pro/Preferences/Audio Units Manager and see if EZdrummer shows up."

First of all, what is a VSIi?

And secondly, Would FL Studio 10 work? In fact, could you give me prime examples on what software will work with EZ Drummer?

,Shinka-,2012-08-17T18:26Z,"OK Somebody please listen. i know this is a vst plugin and i'm using Pro tools so i have to convert it to RTAS using Fx expansion or any other such software. But there is no exe file or vst file that can be converted, Could someone please read this and tell me how i install this on pro Tools or if it's not possible reccomend any other torrents. Im using a Pc windows 7 and have converted various vst plugins to RTas and i know there is an RTAS version of this as well so can it be converted or does it have to be wrapped and if so how!?!?!?!?"
