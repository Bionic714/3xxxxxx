DESCRIPTION 

The History Boys is an engaging, thought-provoking, and wickedly funny look at history, the pursuit of knowledge, and the utter randomness of life. 

SAME SEX APPEAL 

Eight boisterous, yet talented, schoolboys hoping to gain admittance to England's most prestigious universities using their gifts of charm, youth, sport and sex appeal. 

Their journey becomes as much about how education works, as it is about where education leads. 

They're aided on their quest by two teachers, a shrewd young upstart and an inspiring old eccentric, whose opposing philosophies challenge the boys to confront the true meaning of education and the relative values of happiness and success.
