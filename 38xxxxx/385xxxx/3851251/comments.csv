,Ruiner27,2008-01-22T06:14Z,"I just downloaded this and the main menu doesn't work at all for disc 1 but everything works perfectly for disc 2.
I burned these to dual-layer discs with nero without removing or changing anything.
Is anybody else having this problem?
Hopefully not because I just wasted a good disc and alot of bandwidth on this."
