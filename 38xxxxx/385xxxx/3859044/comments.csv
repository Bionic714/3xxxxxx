,David9876,2007-10-27T09:02Z,agree. why do people think 90s pop qualifies as trance? its stupid
,Kaleidoskopet,2007-11-06T18:21Z,"WEll I downloaded your torrent and started listning...

And well.. some tracks are good... But theres alot of really random tracks...
And dont blame others for not puttin in ""real"" trance... Because songs made by Bob Marley and Basshunter isnt ""real"" trance either..

Anyway beside that.. its a good torrent.. Seen better but worth the download.. I will seed for a week or two"
,Mcgillconey,2007-11-09T19:39Z,"Yes, my torrent does have a couple non trance songs, and that's my fault for being a hypocrite. The other 60 or so songs are trance though, so pick what you like, delete the rest, and enjoy. Thanks for those of you who downloaded/seeded my torrent. "
