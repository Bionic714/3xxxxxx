,finnisoestella,2007-11-01T01:26Z,PLEASE!!!!! CAN ANYONE SEED THIS!!  One week and I'm not even at 50%.  My ETA shows up as infinty.........damn
,Menace6,2007-11-01T22:22Z,"ja, seeda för i helvetti."
,strizbiz,2007-11-02T23:31Z,"dont waste your time, 1 seeder & 115 leechers means it will take forever and then some and its not as good as after effects cs3"
,death_strike,2007-11-07T05:54Z,"There aren't any explanations on how to apply the FCS2 SN workaround...

Easy: look for the Final Cut Studio System ID file on your hard drive (use spotlight) or get to it manually from the Finder in Library/Application Support/ProApps/Final Cut Studio System ID

Now replace the Final Cut Studio System ID file with the one provided here. Enter the serial number once when you start your applications the first time. That's it! Worked for me!

Great workaround! Works fine to solve a small (yet annoying problem).

ps. I will be posting the full version of final cut studio 2.0 (about 50 gigs) in a couple of days (takes time to create the torrent file)... anyone interested?"
,isaha,2007-11-07T14:47Z,"My download speed is most of the time = 0, upload speed about 25. Stuck @ about 70%"
,NorBeta,2007-11-08T00:44Z,"Yeah, 250KB/s here now! Only 1 GB left! :D Keep up the good work, seed it for a couple of hours now, and I´ll keep seeding for a loooooong time. "
,logicalnot,2007-11-08T22:13Z,"Doesn't seem to be any seeders in the swarm. PLS SEED, thanks stuck at 87%"
,nissebanan,2007-11-09T11:07Z,SEED anyone???!!!!
,BytorrTorrent,2007-11-09T20:07Z,"Thanks death_strike, I forgot the explanation.    Anyway what I did was first installing, then enter the SN, upgrade all apps. with software update and then do the workaround. Thats another way of doing it."
,LebaneseLarry,2007-11-10T04:24Z,"90% We're gettin' there. At this pace only a couple more days and we're finally done. Just wanna say thanks to BytorrTorrent for the Studio upload. It works like a charm. You don't really need the serial workaround, there are plenty of working serial-numbers out there, even for the update. Looking forward to this one. Again, thanks for your effort, it's very appreciated."
,m_bowen3,2007-11-11T00:37Z,"please seed gang. Im at 91 percent. Right now, this torrent seems to be the biggest thing I have going on...sad I know"

,tattootroy,2007-11-12T04:43Z,can you please tell me wat disk of the 9 has motion 3 and motion content as its faster to download on unenet?
,strizbiz,2007-11-12T15:36Z,"hey all, i too was once at 87 for days, but check this out, I download the contet file from rapidshare in less than an hour from rapidshare. I had to pay like 6 bucks i think to get an acount (last for a month) but it was way worth it. I got almost all the disck from fcs2 and so far no serial to work around or whatever, anyway check this
http://my.opera.com/aironclear/blog/final-cut-studio-2?cid=3909121

by the way I am not getting paid or anything to get people to sign up for rapid share, lol. I just know what a pain in the ass its been trying to get this stuff!

Striz"
,strizbiz,2007-11-12T15:40Z,"by the way if you go this route the motion content is on disc 2,  and they also do paypal for an acount. they do let you dl for free but only like 2 or 3 files a day and the motion disc is partitioned into like 64 files because rapidshare only lets you uplaod a 100 megs at a time. also read the posting there by benix and myself if you have any problems after you download.

Striz"

,doriansend,2007-11-12T19:17Z,"BytorrTorrent - Is it possible you could do me a huge favor?? My internet is really slow right now....would it be possible to upload just the SN workaround and the text as a separate torrent? I know it's less than 1kb....just until I can download this whole collossus. The original one from anarchist666 is invalid, and you're the only other person that has it. I really appreciate it if you could do this. Thank you so much in advance!!!! :)"
,doriansend,2007-11-12T20:21Z,Nevermind that...I was able to select which files to download. I got the workaround for now....sorry about that.

,peacetrain67,2008-03-10T06:23Z,p.s. ill seed once my d-l is finished whichll prolly be like the 15th unfortunately i have a terrible isp and the lack of seeds doesnt help one bit.

,armetis,2008-05-25T21:25Z,probably a bit late now but I've just downloaded this torrent and my mac won't recognise the dmg file. Had no problem with Final Cut Studio 2 which I got. I wondered if the torrent could have been corrupted during download and if it's worth trying again.

,bzhou,2008-06-18T07:44Z,"I have the same problem when I open the dmg, it said fail to recognized. but I try to use Toast Titanium 8, and choose COPY-Disc image merge, and click select mac image, choose the motion 3 dmg, and then Mount..it worked."
,proappsguy,2008-07-13T23:29Z,"I'm now really confused..

Ive downloaded this and installed it now what?? How do i actually open the programe?
Do i have to have final cut studio to actually use this programe?

I downloaded the dvd pro studio 4 from bytorrtorrent and it worked a treat its actually a stand alone programe no need for final cut pro!

I can see the motion folder with all the goodies like the templates and stuff but how do i get to use them??

                                  OR

Maybe i'm thick and doing something wrong.

Can anyone help me ???"

This is just the content for Motion 3, and obviously you will have to have Motion 3 installed to use Motion 3 content
