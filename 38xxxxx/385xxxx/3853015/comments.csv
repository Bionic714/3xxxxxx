Does anyone have the Expansion packs for this (mac format)?"
,Hotknife,2007-11-19T01:33Z,"Awsome post, thank you!"
,wonderwoman99,2007-12-19T10:49Z,"hi. thanks for the torrent. i cant figure it out though. i mounted the .bin and installed the program, but then all the files that come with it (Documentation,Lfo Waveforms,MIDI, programs, etc.) were there but not the actual program itself. the installer said it installed it correctly, and it should have been in the the start menu or under Program Files. any help?"
,KaptenCannabis,2008-01-06T21:02Z,"wonderwoman, its a plugin for music creation programs like cubase or others that support VST, DX or RTAS plugins...you dont run the program itself"
,TheFirstMan,2008-01-11T13:12Z,"wonderwoman99: LOL, this is not a program. You will need a sequencer that supports VST/VSTi plugins. Examples are Cubase or FL Studio.

So get a sequencer first!"

,inkscrap,2008-10-03T00:47Z,"Tried to register after installing and I got a wrong registration number. I used ISO to burn to disk,,  installed and all went through, but won't accept the number.... Any advice...???"
,supersamson360,2009-03-12T05:43Z,"this is meant to run with sonar, is it not? i'm not really sure. waht's recommended fo ruse with this program?"
,VyperCA941,2009-06-12T00:39Z,How do I use this program? I have CakeWalk SONAR 8.0.  Can SONAR open Rapture? What program do I need to get to use it?
,jaimeboy,2009-08-15T08:06Z,guessing it doesnt work in vista =/
,jonthe12,2009-11-21T02:44Z,"I dont understand where to write the registration code, anyone? 
I try to press options in the program but nothing happens. I have used it for like 1 month and then no sound comes, i think its because demo is out."
,MassDisaster221,2010-06-19T18:31Z,What Version is This?
,placemat1212121,2011-01-19T23:46Z,It's version 1. Says it in the title!;-)
,Antilochus,2011-05-19T20:20Z,"Ok, so when I downloaded it, it was just a .Bin file, not an ISO. What do I do now? Is there a folder in Sonar that I am to put it to? Sorry about the newb questions it just doesn't make sense to me and I have d/l a lot of complicated things and got them to work.
Thanks"
,jackmedia,2012-01-09T06:23Z,"Thank you, Erixuz! I don't know where everyone else went wrong, but no problems on my end...fully registered and functional VSTi. Much appreciated! By the way, I used the ser/reg from this site and not the extras given in the torrent. Peace."
