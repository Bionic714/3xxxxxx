I get to do the missions and mess with the new aircraft and also the biggest thing for me is the SP2 that is a part of the expansion that adds dx10 support.

that even solve the gauge problem in the hornet?"

I think your method is only going to work for people who have the legit original copy of fsx.  Because your copy is actually activated, there is no reason why fsx acceleration shouldn't install.

Right now i have FSX, SP1, FSX acceleration all working except for the gauge problems.  Just hoping a fix for this will come out at some point."

How did you do a clean install of a cracked fsx and then installed the Accel pack without encountering the dreaded activation popup? Did you first installed the SP1 with crack?

,jayrodathome,2007-10-31T22:29Z,"I have a Legit Copy of FSX Standard
I installed SP-1 from Microsoft
I installed Acceleration from PirateBay
I Then applied crack supplied by Kaliki

I get no error Messages. No activation Messages. I have full use of my FSX. The only thing i don't' have is gauges in the ""Maul"" All other gauges in all planes work and are visible. The ones in the ""maul"" are not there and i can see outside through the spaces. 

I just assume the dx10 works because i saw around a %20 increase in my frame rate after installing accelerations. Regardless of the activation you get the DX10 Support through the SP2 that is built into Acceleration. "
,vEcToR_2007,2007-10-31T22:29Z,Doing it now but no avail. Accell keeps nagging about activation. Even with the latest cracked dlls'. Its pissing me off.
,jayrodathome,2007-10-31T22:31Z,"one more thing. The ""maul"" is not available in my Section for aircraft selection. I can only use it when i'm in a mission that uses the ""maul"" as the aircraft. 

But then again i do not have fsx deluxe which originally included the maul.

,jayrodathome,2007-10-31T22:43Z,"Just to Let everyone Know. The Flight Deck 5 files from Rapid share work excellent. For both FSX and FS9. It just takes a while to download without a rapidshare account.

,vEcToR_2007,2007-10-31T23:21Z,"Okay, now I am trying the Kalaki method. Extracting the MSI installer from Acceleration. Hereafter copying the enigma dll's. Hope this works. "
,painful_rectal_itch,2007-11-01T04:02Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3867800/FS9-FSX_Flight_Deck_5

I've uploaded and am seeding the Flight Deck 5 installers for FSX and FS9 with serial.

REALLY COOL!"
,SPEC_06,2007-11-01T12:41Z,Flight deck 5 look like shit. VC is so bad in every plane that i uninstall these.
,younlaot,2007-11-01T14:35Z,"You don't get dx10 support right out of box.  I found out there is an option in the settings under general that you have to click while in Vista that says ""Preview DX10"".  This is the only way to get dx10 effects.  The 20% fps gain is just from optimizing dual core and graphic drivers within SP2.

As for the crack, the gauges are missing for me and most others....  so someone with a legit copy of the game that has acceleration installed, just go to your gauges folder, zip up all the gauges (if you are unsure) or just the 3 new plane's gauges and give it to us to use!!!

Thanks."
,SPEC_06,2007-11-01T15:36Z,Mayby better will be all dll files from orginal sp1.
,fulcrum_21,2007-11-01T16:06Z,"Finally I managed to do a full install with working gauges in the FA 18 etc. 

1. After downloading the iso-file, open it and copy all files to a folder on your HD.

2. DL this cracked setup.exe
http://rapidshare com/files/66485527/setup.exe.html

(insert dot after rapidschare...)

3. Copy the new setup.exe into folder with all installation files.

4. run setup

This setup will install FSX X even over installed priated version AND adds the necessary registry-entrys for the working gauges.

5. copy Enigma cracked files into fsx folder.

Now everything schould work."
,SPEC_06,2007-11-01T16:27Z,You are my hero :D Thanks I wait for this :D
,kalaki,2007-11-01T16:53Z,"oh well. one more uninstall and install for me. totally worth it, thanks for the installer crack, its what i was waiting on."
,fulcrum_21,2007-11-01T17:43Z,You don't have to uninstall. Just run the new setup over your existing FSXX. It will add the missing files and registry entries.
,Bengan6505,2007-11-01T18:01Z,This worked perfect...Thanx a million Fulcrum_21

Shut up you tuna-smelling DOUCHEBAG. You wouldn't know a good-looking plane if it FLEW OUT YOUR ASS...oh wait, it'd HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOUR HEAD FIRST wouldn't it, ya stupid fuck. Take a flying fuck at a donut, YOU MORON.

TAKE A FLYING FUCK AT THE MOON.

This torrent is dead anyway. Go download the cracked Enigma version."
,jayrodathome,2007-11-01T23:37Z,"Here we go:

1. Uninstalled fsx genuine
2. installed fsx deluxe razor911
3. installed sp-1 cracked
4. installed acceleration w/cracked .exe copied from disc. (instructions below)
5. applied enigma crac

Result: everything works. Both service packs. The full acceleration. No gauge problems. all missions and plane are usable. 

Thank you all and your genius minds for making this possible for my broke ass to play. 

one more thing.. i ran the game in between each step. I dont' know if that made a difference but i encountered no problems and the whole process took about 2hr

. I run acceleration great except for the gauge thingies are missing. I read your fix about installing over with your patched setup.exe. After running it on the very last percent when its ""caching"" it decides to roll back and not install itself, fsx still works without the gauges on some aircraft. I'm reinstalling everything over again including fsx and your accel setup. Hopefully this works. Is this normal?"
,DeakStarwalker,2007-11-04T08:06Z,Req: Iris the new F-15SG
,jayrodathome,2007-11-05T04:21Z,"Yeah i would do a fresh install although you do not have too. 
I had a genuine copy of fsx but everything worked better with the hacked version for some reason. I installed FSX Razor 911 then the cracked sp1, then installed acceleration from the cracked exe. Then finally copied over the .dll's from enigma. Aftter that everything works. and my fsx has never run better. Now only if some good payware scenery for fsx will come out. "
,fael097,2008-01-12T07:43Z,"ok, i have the same problem as many ppl here,
i installed the genuine FSX standard, then downloaded FSX:Acceleration, and im missing the 2-D panel in the new aircrafts....
according to what i read, i'll have to download the FSX Deluxe (almost 9gb) just to put some 2d panels in my aircrafts?"
,fael097,2008-01-13T03:49Z,someone please reupload the Setup.exe... please!!!
,mattgts30t,2008-01-16T08:19Z,Does anyone still have that exe?
,johnno74,2008-02-23T09:46Z,"Hemi77 & anyone else without a legit registered copy of FSX having issues with this:

Download this torrent + the one below:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3869141/FSX_Acceleration_crack.zip

Mount the ISO here, and copy all the files to your HD.

Open the 2nd torrent, extract setup.exe to the folder you copied the ISO to, overwriting the existing one.

Run setup normally.  It won't complain you haven't activated.

Once setup is complete, copy the 3 DLLs from the 2nd torrent (the enigma crack) into your FSX directory.

Seems to be 100% working for me, dials work, no timer.
