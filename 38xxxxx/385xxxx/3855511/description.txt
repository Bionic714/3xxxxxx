Nezzox's notes:
This movie was ripped and released by XanaX. However the sound was about 500ms out of sync troughout the movie. Not in all players though, but in alot of them. I have read alot of complaints about this, but no one did anything about it. So here it is, the reworked edition. The video is untouched from the XanaX release. The audio is decompressed to wave and then recompressed to 128kbps 48khz VBR mp3 with 500ms offset, making it more or less spot on.

So, now you can enjoy this movie... in sync!
