This torrent is dedicated to Oink's Pink Palace...
Beautiful music like this made it very special place. I found so many new artists and albums which I wouldn't have found without OiNK. I made also a new record of buying albums in the present year, spent nearly all my money, more than 1000EUR in music that I had found on OiNK.
From now on I will buy more other things and less music because it's just against my conscience to support organization that destroyed one of the greatest cultural archives of all time. Nevertheless, hope you enjoy the album!
