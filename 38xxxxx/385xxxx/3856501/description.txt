This is the debut album from Australian artist    
Lost Keys.It is an album full of wonderful treats  
and magical surprises, with sounds ranging from    
funky progressive mind benders, into full on      
psychedelic body benders, whilst all the time      
maintaining a warm, spacious musical dimension    
for the listener. With emotive melodies, smooth    
guitar sounds and grooving beats, Lost Keys'      
music is similar, yet unlike anything else heard  
before in the dance music genre. This is the      
first major release for label Fowl Play Records,  
and is sure to cast a magical spell over the      
dance floor!
