Release Notes 
Formed by producers Gabriel Rocca and Thiago
Peduti, Audio-X is one of the most
outstanding live act projects in the
Brazilian trance scene. The duo started in
2002 and has played in major events such as
Universo Paralello festival in Bahia and
parties like Orbital and Xxxperience.
Now, 5 years down the road, Wired Music
releases their debut album 'No One Can Stop
Us Now!' a mature work that gathers the duo's
best musical experiences. The CD brings
partnerships with Brazilian projects like
Life Style and Cosmonet, besides the remixes
of the tracks 'My Rave', from Eskimo, and
'The Way', from the brazilian Wrecked
Machines (top 55 DJ Mag), showing the duo's
characteristic sound.
Another track that stands out is
'Everything's Gone', produced along with DJ
Noronha bringing a fusion of styles such as
trance, techno and house. In the track 'The
Things People Say', the duo used techno
references mixed with trance beats. Other
tracks that deserve attention are 'Jackpot',
which is more like progressive, and the
album's title track 'No One Can Stop Us Now',
created along with the Brazilian project
Hyperceptiohm.
