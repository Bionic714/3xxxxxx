,manmade2008,2007-10-22T19:33Z,"seeding, but.. not much right now, since ppl manage to stop other ps2 torrents issued here without seeding much at all... so, I have to keep those alive abit longer... sad ppl, since private trackers r nerdworld places were they rule (the only place these loosers can)... so, when, be patient, keep ps2 torrents alive, and all the whining is ignored.. buy it if it's too slow.. thx to all the ppl seeding tho, gr8 work."
