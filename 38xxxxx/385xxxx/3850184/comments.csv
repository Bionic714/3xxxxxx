,TRYER25,2007-12-03T01:31Z,"That was a nice long DL. I got the CD1, 2 and 3 Files but in them are a lot of rld-eusa files.

Is it supposed to be that way or is it a glitch in DL? And what program should I use to all those rld-eusa files??? Thx"
,Chelz77,2007-12-06T00:04Z,"I'm having a problem with this game. After only a short while of playing the painted graphics will disappear. I'll be left with a white background and the characters as 3D images in grey and white. I go back to the main menu, which is also now white and only some of the buttons appear. I manage to save it, and exit. When I go back and play the saved game, it is OK, until it happens again. I'm also confused about the number of rar files and which ones to use, as some of them appear to be exactly the same. Can anybody help? From what I've been able to play, I'm really enjoying it, but the technical glitches are annoying."
,karl415,2007-12-29T00:40Z,i have this game and it also does the same thing as what your all saying with the graphics. can any one tell me on how to get the ripped letter out of the bin in the gardeners room. thanks and keep up the good work.
,moonshimmer,2008-01-03T16:18Z,I'm also having the strange bug that causes all the colours to disappear. It's awfully annoying. Is there any way to fix this? I'm pretty sure It's not my pc that's causing it since more people are having the same problems...
,prat1976,2008-02-16T12:58Z,How do use this now I've downloaded 
,life06,2008-02-24T01:13Z,i've downloaded it but now what?
,Dagger20,2008-04-22T10:37Z,All those having graphics problems there is a patch out for this just go to adventure company website and download patch.
,RickityRick,2008-06-06T19:01Z,I seem to have a problem with the ripped up letter of regret in the bin....even though i'm SURE it's correct (and I've checked it loads) it won't merge and go into my documents. Is this a bug? I have already downloaded the patch.
,thewatchmaker,2008-10-24T15:44Z,"mucho thanks for the torrent, also thanks to dagger20 for suggesting the patch which is the obvious first thing to do. thanks again to you both."
,thewatchmaker,2008-12-31T17:07Z,"You wouldn't believe it! Been saving this game to sit round the fire and play a good mystery at Christmas and, when full of leftover turkey the game crashed when trying to feed a stale corned beef sandwich to the dog in the pub! Has anyone else got this problem? Or any ideas? "

,Starshine23,2009-01-09T21:29Z,"The only image in the whole download is for CD 1. When it asks for CD 2, there's nothing there to mount. How in the hell did the rest of you get it installed???"
