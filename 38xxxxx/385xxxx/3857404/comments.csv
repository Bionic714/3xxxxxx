I know gift horse and all... but... If you could try to fix the problem and upload these torrents as seperate MP3s and not a gigantic RAR.

I'm nervous that with 26 torrents coming a few of the torrents are likely to end up 97% or 82%.

Also, I can't afford the space for 2 copies of this collection. I'll need 60GB RARed to seed and another 60GB unRARed to listen to.

I'll have to pick either seeding or listening. :("
,Anti-pirat1,2007-10-25T23:58Z,"well well

I Like what i Get so far from But i will be more satifies when we come to ""M"" and Hope you have the ""BAND called MONOTONE"" with there greates Hits Zero To Zero""
ohter wice these albums you are making are Great However ill have a Little Point to you if you will Put them into a Libary instead of single Files "
,mooddragon,2007-11-05T09:35Z,"the rar files are good as it means people are not just downloading the tracks they want and leaving others without any 100% seeders, and if you want to listen then burn it off onto cd or dvd for listening and seed back the rar from your pc, and as for library it would be a huge file not everyone has the download limit  to manage that or the space keep them comming just as they are cheers dude :D"
,itsafootball,2008-03-09T09:58Z,you'd be better off allowing people to download individual songs; I'm not downloading 1.3gb for two songs.
,automatric,2008-03-16T09:32Z,"A real big thank you.
From the community's point of view, a rar file is the best solution."
