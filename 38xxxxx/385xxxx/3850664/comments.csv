,Stringt,2007-10-20T21:37Z,"since theres not yet ep 10 in pb?
umm have you checked this

,eKi100,2007-10-20T22:09Z,"Nope, since for me it doesnt show a single episode 10 when i search them, not even this my own :S

Well anyways its made so here it is :)"
,devastaticon,2007-10-24T03:31Z,"you know, people would seed more if you did not compress the file... the movie file itself is ALREADY a compressed video file, which is why there's usually around only a 10k difference in the size.... you NEED to leave the movie file unzipped so that people can view their shit and seed at the same time. making it a .rar file only makes it like 0.0001% smaller. 

seriously, stop .rar'ing your files it makes no sense"

As u might see, its even named with -XOR extension, i just downloaded it from other site & at the time i did, pb didnt show any ep 10 for me,  dunno why now it does, so i decided to upload it here :P

U dumb fuck, of course i wouldnt have packed it if it would be made/recorded by me :)

But since it wasnt, i didnt see any reason for share the unpacked file, since some guys seems to prefer rar packages instead, for reasons like: If file gets corrupted during download etc, u dont need to download whole shit again, only the corrupted part wich is few mb's, instead of few hundred mb's ;) 

u feel it? It does make some sence ;)

(ps. get bigger hdd, so u dont have to complain about having same file twice on ur pc, in rar & unpacked. Some might do it different ways than u prefer, like uploading the rar package like a month, then removing whole torrent/packed file & keeping only unpacked for own use etc..)"
