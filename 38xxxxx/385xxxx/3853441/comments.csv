,gorejuice,2008-02-01T21:37Z,"Nice comments... cheers, I've installed pretty much everything as an AU for use with Logic... but I can't seem to get the Pro-53 to work in sync with Logic. It works so nicely as a stand alone unit, but that's not much help when using a sequencer! 

Any suggestions?

Thanks

,eraeya,2008-03-11T18:39Z,"Anyone got keygen/serial for this? Just for Reaktor would be a-okay... (for anyone who knows iSerial: the SN just enables install + 1 month demo, no hard crack.)

,momo333,2008-04-14T10:23Z,Reaktor won't save in Leopard which is a known issue for this version. Would be great to get a crack of 5.1.5 which will save and quit new ensembles.

,WOWwtf,2011-08-21T09:34Z,"NO POINT WITHOUT THE LIBRARIES.

Another half ass upload.

It's beyond me.... Absynth is useless. battery is useless.... just about everything is useless.. 
So fuckin senseless dude 

fuck the apps and the patches just buy the whole thing. 

don't risk downloading something thats essentially useless.. I can't believe this people actually download this shit.

"
,Eejay.Jauregg,2011-09-23T00:29Z,"if this works, it is simply amazing.

to all those saying ""useless without library"":
there are plenty of ways to get the respective libraries. this contains the apps only, and that's great as it is."
