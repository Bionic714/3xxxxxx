PSU Penn State Nittany Lions (Big Ten Conference) going into the season vs the Wisconsin Badgers (Big Ten Conference. I ran into some problems encoding, and for some reason the file size is smaller? If anyone have any problems with this encode let me know, I will remove it immediately and replace it with a 1.43 GB one. Otherwise, enjoy!

Enjoy! See my previous torrents for other PSU releases.

WE ARE ... PENN STATE!

cheers,
