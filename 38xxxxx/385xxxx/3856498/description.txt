Release Notes 
After years of heavy involvement in the
global psychedelic trance scene and countless
released tracks and collaborations with some
of the biggest names and labels, Bamboo
forest is surely one of the most important
names out there. His first two albums have
been massive sellers and have received an
enthusiastic feedback from the most influent
psy trance djs.
Bamboo Forest means psy trance as it is
supposed to be, pumping, happy and
psychedelic and in the days of hundreds of
disposable releases every year, this album is
the tangible proof that good psytrance still
exists and big names still rock!
