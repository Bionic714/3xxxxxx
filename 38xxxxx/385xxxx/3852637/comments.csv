,Morberis,2008-01-08T12:35Z,"""The file you are attempting to play has an extension (.p3) that does not match the file format.

Hmm audio converters won't work on it either."
,Morberis,2008-01-08T12:39Z,"Tried to use Gspot to identify the file formats and it comes up as unrecognized, Eset NOD32 doesn't say its a virus so I'm gonna try another dl..."
,WonderSlug,2008-04-05T13:03Z,"Thank you for this fantastic upload!

All files play well, and because of the great number of seeders (100+ at the time of this writing), quite a few high-speed, I DL'ed this at 450KB/sec and finished the DL in about 15 mins.

Sound quality is pretty good, being around 160kbps VBR.

,zap_papa2008,2008-10-11T11:54Z,wonderful - better than the 'talkie' original!
,max2562,2008-11-21T21:14Z,"@ Morberis

try editing the extension from "".p3"" to "".mp3""

also, a good converting program that has never failed for me is EasyCD-DA Extractor. it's always fixed any corrupt file among other things it can do. "
