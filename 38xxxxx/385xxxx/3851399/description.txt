Works fine. Use DAEMON or ALCOHOL with .mds file and after install, copy the crack file from the other archive into football manager\'s directory  

Unrar the graphics archive into C:\\Documents and Settings\\...\\My Documents\\Sports Interactive\\Football Manager 2008, and in the game go to preferences, unmark \'use skin cache\' and mark \'always reload skin after confirm\'
