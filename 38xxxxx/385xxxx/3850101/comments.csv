,PiratePete1337,2008-05-22T17:21Z,"Also Skankin Pickle says this is a ""covers and favorites"" album."
,Kottkvarn,2008-05-24T13:18Z,Not in huge letters on the front of the album where I can see it without looking very hard!
,Tulkoju,2010-06-24T21:37Z,"I bought this album at a concert of theirs at the Phoenix in Petaluma. They presented it as a cover album. I think Bruce Lee (Mike Park) had already left for his solo projects. I think it's the last album they released.
They were my favourite ska band back in High School.
It's nice to be able to download this instead of fishing it out of the cellar."
,Tulkoju,2010-06-24T21:41Z,"aka ""The Green Album""
Anyone have their best album ""Sing Along With Skankin Pickle""?"
