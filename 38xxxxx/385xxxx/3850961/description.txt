Here's a somewhat hard to find VHS tape from Toni Childs (1989).  It features three videos from her debut A&M release Union.  Dominic Sena directs the first one, "Don't Walk Away."  There's also a short interview with Toni at the end.

Quality is decent.  Video source was NTSC but, most of the video didn't appear telecined.  It ended up looking better to me after just de-interlacing and leaving the frame rate alone.  Audio is MP3.
