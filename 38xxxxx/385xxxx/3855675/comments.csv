,zeinabqureshi,2008-04-16T23:13Z,"This is a rather cruel place to put this sort of comment... If anyone's interested then I can upload a rip of this... in two CDs, of course. This is a huge movie... well over three hours, so I guess a 7.5 GB download is justified. "
,RagingBill,2008-06-26T23:30Z,"Please, continue to seed this masterpiece, my friends!"
,RagingBill,2008-06-28T08:22Z,Seed please!!!

Is there any chance you might find it in your heart to seed a little more of this and ""Marco Bellocchio - Buongiorno Notte (Goodmorning Night) 2003.iso ""?
It is quite difficult to find great italian movies with english subtitles.
Thank you again
