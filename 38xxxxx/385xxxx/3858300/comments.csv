This is such a good program that you should buy it instead. I´m not kidding.

I´ve dl a lot of things, belive me. But this one -the best. And not expensive either.









So, buy. If so after you´ve tried it.

,Zeuzi,2007-10-28T16:18Z,"MD2k, you should DL the patch first then NOD32 to save you time OR download the torrent & DL the patch afterwards."
,GerryT,2007-10-29T18:33Z,"DL went fine...
