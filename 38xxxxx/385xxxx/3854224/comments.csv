,spartangtr,2007-10-23T11:22Z,"I try to seed this as much as possible, right now I'm devoting a little over 130 kbps upload for this torrent, but this computer can't stay on at all times. I believe I've already uploaded 100% to a couple people so you'll have a few seeders. I'll seed as much as possible though, just be patient I know this is a large file. "

See: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4463428/Ennio_Morricone_Remixes for the MP3 Version"
