Years after the Raccoon City disaster, Alice (MILLA JOVOVICH) is on her own; aware that she has become a liability and could endanger those around her, she is struggling to survive and bring down the Umbrella Corporation led by the sinister Albert Wesker (JASON O'MARA) and head researcher Dr. Isaacs (IAN GLEN). Meanwhile, traveling through the Nevada Desert and the ruins of Las Vegas, Carlos Olivera (ODED FEHR), L.J. (MIKE EPPS), and new survivors K-Mart (SPENCER LOCKE), Claire Redfield (ALI LARTER), and Nurse Betty (ASHANTI) must fight to survive extinction against hordes of zombies, killer crows and the most terrifying creatures created as a result of the deadly T-Virus that has killed millions.
