Roger Shackleforth is desperately in love with Leila. He visits an old professor looking for advice on how to win her. The professor, after some resistance, sells Roger a love potion. After its administration, Leila falls madly in love with Roger. But soon, her love becomes stifling. So, Roger returns to the professor to buy his 'glove cleaner' (poison). When he gets home, he prepares a glass of poisoned champagne. Just as he is about to give her the glass, she tells him that she is pregnant, which shocks Roger into dropping the glass. He dazedly admits to himself that he couldn't have gone through with it anyway.
