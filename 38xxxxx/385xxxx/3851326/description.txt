Boycie and Abdul pitch a diamond scam to Del Boy, who immediately turns them down.
That is until they offer him a Â£15,000 cut of the estimated Â£150,000 sale of the stone on the UK market. Del finds himself designated as the courier between Holland and Britain.
No sooner has Del enlisted a reluctant Rodders, he hears his old foil Chief Inspector Slater is eyeing Boycie and Abdul as drug dealers. Del decides to hide undetected in the back of Denzil's van.
Denzil then getting in and driving them to Hull (pursued by Rodney) was not part of the plan. Thinking quickly, they hire a boat, and let Uncle Albert guide them to Amsterdam.
Overcoming counterfeit cash, Albert's amnesia, it's only the arrival of Slater that scuppers them. Despite this, it's Del who has the last laugh.
