,adamkatt,2007-10-27T00:58Z,Just looked around on the bay...  You have 4 versions of this upped???  Why not just one good one next time eh?
,msevil,2007-10-27T01:42Z,"Hmm the sound.... it's really bad. At least at the beginning of the movie. Just started watching it. 
I agree with adamkatt, why don't you just upload one version who works? Or, maybe you're new at this? I hope you can take constructive criticism.. 2 you who's thinking of downloading this example, look for another one, the sound is bad on this one. "
,ndwildboy,2007-10-28T15:47Z,"Sup He0n,

I was just curious, does the source actually have the samples or do you make them yourself?  I know everyone keeps talkin about you and loder (a bot no less) but the main difference to me is that you put samples with alot of releases that loder usually doesn't.  This is why I usually get your releases.  Keep up the good work."
