I was going to download this torrent because I need like 10 songs from the Flower Power collection...

Acouple of the ones I needed were not in this torrent 

Tom Rush The Galveston Flood
Fred Neil Bleecker And Macdougal 
Country Joe & The Fish Feel Like I'M Fixin' To Die Rag 
Blues Project Wake Me Shake Me
The above tracks I needed were missing, there may be others missing from the torrent but these are just the ones I was after.

and songs that arn't part of the flower power collection WERE included..

Alice Cooper = Not flower power
Iron Butterfly = Not flower power
And thats just the 2 off the top of my head.

Thanks for the upload tho, was able to get acouple of tracks that I needed."
