,shmuckhead,2007-10-24T01:34Z,"Mr. 4X-AXG-FAG,

You don't need a grenade.

All you need is love.

But we all enjoy you being here. It's like you can't live without us so you seek us out and colour our world hopping we'll connect with you, desperate for some interaction. We can feel it.

We're all glad you're here, and we love your new sense of humour. Grenades...  You're the best!"
,subicbay,2007-10-24T02:15Z,"Thanks for this!
Is WoS down? "
,01T,2007-10-24T09:44Z,"4X, any chance to see Flight Environment X?"
,Simmer5,2007-10-24T16:07Z,"Flight Environment X almost is like the holy grail of cracking at the moment.  The problem is that all users have to connect with a online database of files to get stuff- which requires everyone to have a different name and everything, which is going to be a bitch to crack.  

So I guess I'll finish my statement this way:  If you don't see it here, stop asking for it so much.  If someone gets it, then they'll post it. "
,shmuckhead,2007-10-25T03:04Z,"Mr. 4X-AXG-FAG,

You know what I like best about you, it's the way you find a style for every moment. Your new style, the long posts, are allowing us precious extra seconds to spend with you while we scroll down to the bottom to read those extra special punch lines.

Grenades... I mean really, I'm still laughing from yesterday.

Enjoy the day, and remember, there's only one thing you need - Love

Bye for now, but we'll see ya soon!"
