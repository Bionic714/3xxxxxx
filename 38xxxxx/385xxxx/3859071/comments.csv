,microchip,2007-10-28T19:45Z,"As expected something found:
Trojan horse Generic8.QHA in FineReader.exe
Virus identified Obfustat.UBR in ProductLicensing.dll
reported by AVG Free"
,rumsfeld69,2007-11-12T22:29Z,"No viruses detected by AntiVir; no malware detected by SuperAntiSpyware.

Files work beautifully for me.

Be sure to stop the ""ABBYY FineReader 9.0 Licensing Service"" in your Windows Administrative Tools before copying the cracked files over, then turn it back on before you run the program.

Thanks, looki9856."

,keihtan,2008-03-16T01:00Z,"My antivirus software (McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8) alert me there is a generic Trojan in file ""FineReader.exe"" but Spyware Doctor stay silent. So i disable on-access scan on antivirus and try to install. Indeed, all works great! So grab all this release cause i do not find anything else that works for FineReader v9. Just exclude in your antivirus software file ""FineReader.exe"" or map where you install FineReader..."

,Zoned87,2008-09-09T02:33Z,"Would someone please, PLEASE upload the newer version of this program that supports Japanese/Chinese and Hebrew.

I have tried absolutely everything to get it to work, serial hunting, cracks for older versions and even editing its registration files... the program quickly locks itself up and blocks me.... it costs $400 and I can't afford that...
