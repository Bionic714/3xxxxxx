,Pandziura,2008-01-20T10:07Z,"sandwichmonster, that's great about the ogg's. Ppl this is a free format and every portable player should include ogg's. The quality is superior to the mp3. Keep going"
,mcfreds,2008-03-10T12:27Z,"Thanks for seed that, ogg rocks"
,chickenmofo,2008-04-18T00:59Z,"nice start i guess, but you're missing 'you can play these songs with chords'. Not only that, but some of death cabs best stuff comes from their EP's. Just a friendly reminder, man. Keep it up. "
,jamessland,2008-05-13T01:17Z,this file type is shit
,FallenSky417,2008-06-11T17:58Z,"This is a terrible discography, missing all the EP's and the full album You can Play These Songs With Cords."
,skydiverQ,2008-10-12T11:45Z,"FallenSky417, ""You Can Play These Songs With Chords"" is not a Death Cab release.  It was a solo project by Ben Gibbard, Death Cab was formed after it's release.
