Episode 5: A ship in the fog (3) - off to the print shop!

In this episode I'll finish the editing of the image that kept me busy in the last shows. There was a lot to do - darkening the ship with a selective layer mask, cloning out some driftwood and half a bird, correcting the aspect ratio to something the printer will be happy with and giving him a hint how to print the image with a gray and colour gradient.
