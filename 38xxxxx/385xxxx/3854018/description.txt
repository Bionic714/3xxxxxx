This is only a temporary crack! After closing the program you'll need to repeat steps 2 to 4 every time you want to use driver detective. 

1. Install driver detective and launch the program. Select manufacturer then close driver detective.
2. For windows XP: copy the licence file to the directory: 
C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication DataPC Drivers HeadquartersDriver Detectivedd.lic    (This is a hidden folder. In order to see it go to control panel, folder options, view, show hidden files and folders)
   For windows Vista: copy the licence file to the directory: C:UsersAll UsersPC Drivers HeadquartersDriver Detectivedd.lic
3. Open driver detective and enter this registration key: 
e7cfc8a6-253a-445a-b35c-36f0ce49e5c9 
4. Hit the validate button and you should see a checkmark beside it and the program is now registered. 
 


The licence provided should be good for one year until oct/08.
