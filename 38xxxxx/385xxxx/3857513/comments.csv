,ianc125,2007-10-25T01:45Z,I figured out how to remove the old nvm
,castiboy,2007-10-25T11:21Z,"thanks. :D

only problem:

it's ""The Unthinking Majority"" with ""the"" in it.
it's ""Praise the Lord and Praise the Ammunition"" and it's ""Beethoven's C***"".
songs 12 and 13 are actually 11 and 12, and 13 (""the reverend king"") is missing...

thanks for the bonus stuff though."

I had media monkey auto tag from another site, which must have had it wrong

2. 	""The Unthinking Majority""
3. 	""Money""
4. 	""Feed Us""
5. 	""Saving Us""
6. 	""Sky Is Over""
7. 	""Baby""

9. 	""Lie Lie Lie""
10. 	""Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition""
11. 	""Beethoven's Cunt""
12. 	""Elect the Dead""

iTunes and Japanese version bonus track
13. 	""The Reverend King""

Limited edition bonus disc
1. 	""Blue""
2. 	""Empty Walls"" (Acoustic)
3. 	""Feed Us"" (Acoustic)

As can be seen above (Info from wikipedia) ""The Reverend King"" is not on all editions of the album!"
