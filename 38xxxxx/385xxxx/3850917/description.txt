These MP3s are ripped off the audio tracks of a German "Die Siedler II - Gold Edition" CD. Because of the mixed data and audio tracks, they are numbered from 2 to 9.

The titles (in filename and ID3 tags) are in the original German provided by iTunes (with umlauts replaced to avoid character set trouble). Translations of the titles are below.

Track number - Title:

#2 - Die Roemer Ziehen Los (The Romans set forth)
#3 - Die Felder Bluehen (The fields are blooming)
#4 - Die Traurige Baeuerin (The sad farmer`s wife)
#5 - Das Gesunkene Schiff (The sunken ship)
#6 - Der Grosse Kampf (The great battle)
#7 - Die Hochzeit des Feldherrn (The General`s wedding)
#8 - Ankunft in Japan (Arrival in Japan)
#9 - Das Tote Schlachtfeld (The dead field of battle)
