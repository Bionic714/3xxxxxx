"This album comprises two sessions. The first is a nonet which has the same instrumentation as Miles' Birth of the Cool sessions and some of the same players. Gigi wrote all of the tunes with the exception of "The Kerry Dance." I don't believe there are very many recordings of his arrangements for a big group, so it is interesting to hear what he can do here. Although it does have a cool sound, it doesn't sound like the Miles group. Gigi and trumpeter Art Farmer get most of the solo space, though trombonist Jimmy Cleveland has a nice, dreamy solo on "In a Meditating Mood." Vocalist Ernestine Anderson appears on "Social Call" and "You'll Always be the One I love," which adds some variety to an otherwise all instrumental session.

While the first session has a cool sound, the second session (last four tracks), featuring Gigi in a quartet setting with Thelonious Monk, has a much harder sound. Other than "Nica's Tempo" (by Gigi), the tunes are by Monk. (...)"
