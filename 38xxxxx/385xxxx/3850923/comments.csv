,Nvdia_Kevin,2008-05-30T20:00Z,"Superb, works really well.
The easiest way to play, just mount the file in a program like Daemon Tools. But some advice, make sure you have a decent graphics card, 'cause a card like the Ati Rage Pro 32mb 4X AGP for example, totally doesn't work."
,RumRunner1000,2008-06-03T02:11Z,"I don't understand. I mounted using daemontools, but I get the message ""Insert Correct Disk and Try Again!"" PLEASE HELP ME!"

Just mount halo.nrg file with daemon tools or any other cd/dvd emulating program and the install will run automatically...
