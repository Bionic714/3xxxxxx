,kheoz,2007-11-02T13:17Z,"this is what i did. 

-extract the first numbered file001 or whatever.
-from that there should be an image file .iso
-mount it with deamon or in my case alchohol 120
- install the game 
-when you try to play it the error ""insert original pes2008"" will appear.
-dl the vitality crack rar it the click on the PES icon 
-game should start as normal

* in the game the crowd is not visible, if anyone knows how to fix this or if there is a patch out. also to fix the team names and ability to save. hope this helped"

,liewyuqiang,2008-03-19T16:54Z,Another Fine Fairlight FLT BRAVO!
,liewyuqiang,2008-03-19T17:07Z,"Everyone relax! You use WinRAR to extract flt-pes8.001 (Double click on flt-pes8.001 say you want to use winrar ) and after that you should see winrar on the Flt file. Then, Double click on it again! then you should see a file and (...) double click on the file and wait for it to extract. No need the mount image thing, partly cause i don't understand what the others are trying to say.

Please respon.

,liewyuqiang,2008-03-19T17:13Z,"Can anyone help me now? My download speed is like Average of 0.3 kb/s please tell me a programme which makes torrent download faster.
