Whats that  Magic Akir?
Why not give good cracks and not fake ones?"
,awudu,2009-01-01T13:46Z,"Also after running ccpsvr, there's a new update (Server version 5.2.113 and client version is 5.1.607...
You have to update the server before youc an update the clients...
MAgic akir, give valid License information to register ccpsvr 5 ultra edition. Cybercafepro is the best and good cafe timer when it comes to user interface."
,awudu,2009-01-01T14:29Z,"After the update of the server, I can update the clients but they gave me (the server) a 45 days as trial period.
How do I license this cybercafepro v5?
