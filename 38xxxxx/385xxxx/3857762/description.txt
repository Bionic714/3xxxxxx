This is one of many so called Video Nasties about fictionalised World War 2 Nazi POW camp atrocities. The film focuses on a senior female SS officer who has created a half man/half beast dwarf creature in a bizarre genetic experiment. She goes on to torture the female POW's in her care by giving them to the vertically challenged beast who subsequently "bonks" them to death. The SS officer has the tables turned on her at the films climax when the POW's get the upper hand and give her a taste of her own medicine. This film has a load of vile scenes and genital torture. Another video nasty that can actually be called 'nasty'.
