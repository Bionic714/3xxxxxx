Alex is a good filmmaker and a real truthseeker. I wish I could help him to distribute his movies in europe with correct subtitles for each country, so that all can understand his message. Don´t stop the good fight!"

Nitehawk_ I was thinking of doing that too.. are you still interested in distributing Alex movies, drop me a line."
,Davjon,2008-05-10T02:12Z,Where can I get a hold on information like this on dvd. My inglish is limited so for me too be able too comprehend everything I would need some subtitle. i'm greatful for any help you van give me  
,Ola435345345,2008-12-24T02:22Z,"I had a hard drive crash because the seagate disk went too hot since I have been seeding this one and the first ISSUES upload for months. Wouldnt say I´m satisfied with Seagate. Now I bought a Western digital including heat pipe cooling and I hope it will last longer. However I need help seeding this some days now so I can get the material back (Christmas 2008). Thank you whoever will leave the computer running .. Thank you. 

Sorry Davjon I don´t have an answer to that. I don´t us subtitles myself since the Swedish subs never includes everything anyway, and it destroys the picture. Maybe you know some one who can be explaining to you. But I dont know maybe  ther is subtitles somwhere! try to search for the material in other uploads here or in google. A search like ""American blackout torrent"" will get you somewhere. Then use micro torrent so you can choose in the list of files to download so you only get the subtile file."
,debba,2010-08-31T01:02Z,so any one knows if there is any place else where i can find this video still seeded or when any one will reseed
,debba,2010-08-31T01:04Z,"BTW for nighthawk i got the same idea if you wanna team up for making subs for docu's like this  so any way hawk if you like the idea of teaming up for this
