,Gamepie,2008-01-20T13:11Z,I found it an easy install
,limabravo,2008-06-12T14:26Z,"I realy apreciate all these FS add ons you put up guys, but I cant install this one, as someone else has said where are you supossed to extract the zip to, as I have tried my FS9 directory and the aircraft directory to no avail. 

PS posting I installed it no problems, without saying how you did it dosent help anyone else, it just makes you seem unhelpful"
,TheBean911,2008-11-02T22:43Z,"-flightsimFS9- Try this to install , it worked for me. Creat a temp folder on your Desktop,call it whatever (2) Exstract the zip file to the temp folder , with a check mark in all files and USE FOLDER NAMES. (3) you will have a folder called Twin Comanche with 4 other folders and a dll file (4) Inside the Aircraft folder is the Eaglesoft Twin Comanche CUT and than PAST that folder to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS9\Aircraft.(5) Effects 4 files plus a texture folder CUT the 4 fx files and Past them in FS9 Effects Folder than inside the texture folder CUT and Past that 1 file to EFFECTS\TEXTURE (6) Fonts go into FS9 Fonts Folder(7)Sound; you have a folder ESDG ;CUT and PAST that to your MAIN FS9 SOUND FOLDER ; (over right if nessuary): (8) GaugeSound.dll ; CUT and Past to your Main FS9 folder ; ie. C:\ program files\ microsoft games\fs9. (9) The gauges are inside your PANEL AIRCRAFT FOLDER ; there are 3 gauge files and 1 cab file CUT the 4 files and place them in your MAIN FS9 GAUGE FOLDER.-----That's It if done right it should work----Good Luck and Happy Flying"
