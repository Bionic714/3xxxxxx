,lordbk,2007-10-27T15:08Z,"wow - i am deeply impressed. 
i love NINs ""year zero"" and this sounds equally rough and complex.
also the web distribution in different quality formats at a reasonable price made me just place my preorder. 

something like this needs to be supported.

can't wait until november 1st..."
,Oetzi101,2007-10-27T15:48Z,Trent you dirty dog you. Thats illegal :)
,hans86,2007-10-27T20:20Z,thanks trent
,josephshebib,2007-10-28T00:06Z,"thanks - encourage everyone to pre-order, two options are offered.  easy payment via paypal.

so, is it an-alien-cure or anal-i-encure ... although I don't know what encure means... it sounds nasty.

,analiencure,2007-10-28T03:45Z,"This was uploaded on the behalf of TR.

""An Alien Cure"" is in reference to the Gary Numan song of the same name."
,deathdr0ne,2007-10-28T17:11Z,"Thanks analiencure a.k.a. guy keeping trents hands clean. ;-) Anyway good song even though hip hop style isn't really my thing. The fact that it is a collaboration really does open new doors, and I think I'll be downloading the rest from nin.com or where ever it will be in flac. How much is that going to run again? 5 dollars? Thats pretty sweet although for four dollars more you get packaging and an actual disc with some artists. Either way the fact that the money goes to the artists, and not the fucking labels is what matters here. "
,deathdr0ne,2007-10-28T17:14Z,"If you could get a message to trent.... Tell him to obtain the rights (if he doesn't have them already) to all his previous releases as well. My original 1989 copy of pretty hate machine has played it's final play, and no longer works .... :-( I don't want to pay the labels for another one. Yeah I know it's old but still I rock that disc at least once every two weeks...sometimes more, and hey thats a lot when you own over 300 discs."
,PolyNoxx,2007-10-29T09:59Z,"Yes, this is right what I expected - new dimension of music. This is really BREAK! Well done work! Such music is exactly my ""blood group"". Thanks!"
,JC4,2007-10-29T23:42Z,"I'm really digging this track and tr(n)igger, they've got that same clean production that made year zero so impressive. I'll be paying for this. 
Can't wait."
