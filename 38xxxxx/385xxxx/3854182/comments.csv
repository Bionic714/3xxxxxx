If you don't already know this, 
Windows update checks your system for activation info. Using this 'hack' will activate your system, but when windows update checks for activation info, it will find that you illegally activated your copy, therefore will not let you use Windows Update. Although, there is an easy way to get around this...MANUALLY DL UPDATES!"
