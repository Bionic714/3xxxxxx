I've been trying to DL this for freakin ever now.  I mean months and was stuck at like 31%.  Now I am litterally stuck at 99.4%  I mean COME FREAKIN ON!!!!!  Is this a cruel joke or what?

I see that someone else has finally uploaded another one with dif size that has 15 seeders.  gonna try to DL it and hopefully get.  I have tried and tried getting this thing but this stuck at 99.4% for like 2 weeks now is just cruel and unusual punishment.  For those reading this, here's the link to the other torrent.  I hope I get it or this one finished.

,slapahoindians,2008-10-31T12:35Z,Just wanted to add.  I just checked.  I've been trying to DL this since 8-25-08.  This is some dedication I have towards this movie just to get a full copy to seed to all the others who love this movie and to be the bane to the others who don't love it yet are forced to watch it during the 24 hr marathon.
,slapahoindians,2008-11-21T11:55Z,SWEET!!!  Almost exactly 3 months later and finally 100%.  Let the DL's begin!  I will seed this as much as possible.
