A kindly fellow?s life is turned topsy-turvy when he receives ?help? from his guardian angel.

Mr. Bevis loses his job, wrecks his car and gets evicted from his apartment, all in one day. Bevis then meets his guardian angel J. Hardy Hempstead, who assists him. Bevis starts the day over, except now he is a success at work, his rent is paid, and his car is now a sportscar, instead of a jalopy. However, in order to have his new life, Bevis must make some changes: No loud clothes, no zither music, no longer can he be the well-liked neighborhood goofball. Realizing all these things are what makes him happy, Bevis asks that things be returned to the way they were. Hempstead changes things back, but arranges for Bevis to get his old jalopy back. However when he's about to be ticketed for parking next to a fire hydrant, the hydrant suddenly moves a few feet over... His guardian angel is still with him.
