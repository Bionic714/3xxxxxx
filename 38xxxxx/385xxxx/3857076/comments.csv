,Bogge.se,2007-11-15T13:54Z,"I think thats not the deal either..
Just so you can use some of the apps in the touch"
,cyberbkk,2007-12-23T08:27Z,"@JONTE_SUPER - come on, you cant be that stupid, of course you can not make the ipod to a phone with these apps, but the reason why somebody may want them are the apps like mail, maps,...."
,MADDSPD,2007-12-25T19:46Z,"Haha, of course you can't use the Touch as a phone with these apps... It's just apps like Weather, Mail, stocks, and stuff that are usefull.  I tried the Phone/SMS app, but nothing happened... *duh*"

[edit] Easy Way for 1.1.1 and 1.1.2

Just discovered this. Go into Installer and choose Sources. Edit > Add > Enter ""repo.us.to"" > Refresh... after this it can take a while, just wait.
Go to Install and there should be a new category named ""iPhone 1.1.1 Apps for iTouch""
It appears that this works for 1.1.2 now, too. It's in the category ""iPhone 1.1.2 Apps for iTouch""
For MobileMail or MobileMaps make sure you install MailPrep and MapsPrep first. This sets the touch up to install the main applications.

,Eastcoast_pirate,2008-01-09T03:56Z,"I installed maps and weather and have them working properly, but i couldn't mobilmail working properly :( maybe with some TLC you might be able too. But anyways heres a link to the tutorial that i used and got everything working.

http://www.touchdev.net/wiki/Enable_iPod_Touch/iPhone_Applications#Easy_Way_for_1.1.1_and_1.1.2

Oh yeah and when it says to ""SSH into your iPod and type the command: chmod a+x /Applications/Maps.app/Maps"" or ""Run the command while connected to your iTouch via SSH "" chmod -R a+x /Applications/* "" just use  the command prompt in WinSCP to give the commands. And also use WinSCP to put the apps  on your ipod touch. 

But thats it, just follow the tutorial and your done enjoy! :)"
