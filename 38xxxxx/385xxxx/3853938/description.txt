This movie is in PAL format, it is region-free and has the original German soundtrack with the BBC English dubbed narration. There are no other spoken languages and no subs.

This was a project I worked on simply to present the movie as it was originally enjoyed in the 1960s by millions of British children who didn\'t have the luxury of colour TV. It is, therefore, presented here in glorious Black and White.

Download the \'1 MIN 30 SEC MOVIE SAMPLE.VOB\' and/or the \'SAMPLE OF MOVIE MENU RESOURCE.mpg\' before downloading the entire 3.93GB movie, just to ensure you\'re not disappointed.

Enjoy !
