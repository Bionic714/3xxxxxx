dont bother with this crap"
,macdotnub,2007-12-03T18:34Z,"""TeamOfHackintosh"" first don't post under that name, you're nothing to do with ToH, have some guts and use your own name if you have a problem with me.

Second it works fine for most people, 100's - literally - of people have emailed me thanking me for making the install DVD and to say it works fine. Here's one I got last week...

""wanted you to know your last DVD is still running GREAT on my computer.

i was hoping that you might make a 10.5 version soon. anyway, thanks for all the work, hope another mac.nub version comes out again.""

I also get thousands of visitors to my website each month. The popularity of the DVD was so great that the original topic had to be locked on InsanelyMac.

Anyone wanting to ask questions now should either ask at forum.osx86scene.com in the ""Mac OS 10.4 Tiger"" section, as I am a moderator over there, or ask via my website.

As for ""stolen sources"" I bought my own Tiger 10.4.10 Install DVD /w License that this was based on. I don't have a ""distribution license"" but nor do any other Install DVD makers.
