RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries, news headlines...etc.

This torrent offers a free Java based RSS reader for windows x86 (32-bit) : RSSOwl/1.2.3 2006-11-26 (Windows; U; en).

It will allow you to keep track of newly released torrents without having to go to each torrent site to see what\\\\\\\'s new.

How to :

1_ Install Java Real time Environmemt : jre-6u2-windows-i586-p-s.exe. If you have a more recent JRE it will not install.

2_ Install RSSOwl : rssowl_1_2_3_win32.exe. There are more recent versions of RSSOwl but this one is smaller, memory-friendly and stable (I have been using it for a while).

3_ Run it a first time, then close it, to create the folder : C:\\\\\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\\\\\[YOUR_USER_NAME]\\\\\\\\.rssowl

4_ Copy the provided \\\\\\\"user.xml\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"C:\\\\\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\\\\\[YOUR_USER_NAME]\\\\\\\\.rssowl\\\\\\\" overwriting the original one to track the torrent sites I already preset (the blog of Christopher Jon Bjerknes is also there).


After a little experimentation you will be able to change the settings and track more webpages as you wish.
