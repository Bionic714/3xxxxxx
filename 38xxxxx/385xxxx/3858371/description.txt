Episode 11: RAW converting with UFRaw

RAW conversion was a thing a lot of you wanted to know something about. And in this show I tell you how to use the program UFRaw to get RAW images into the Gimp. My job was coming a bit into the way - I had to build the schedule for my school. So this show contains some ?should be? outtakes and perhaps I have overlooked some stuff. Please feel free to ask - I will be glad to answer all your questions in a follow up show.
