,Memone,2007-11-16T02:38Z,"This series fucking rules !
Guess its gonna get a ""few"" more downloads now that the game is out! :P

But to you who think ""polish series? cant be good?"". Just what i though, but its fucking awsome!"
,Mcbubby,2008-02-08T06:21Z,"Big thanks matcail! I'm McBubby who oversaw the original English subbing project, I'm so glad that people are still checking out this series and that people like yourself are helping to release it; rounding up people to translate sure was a difficult task! Glad to see it was worthwhile."
,Vermon,2008-09-18T19:21Z,Hi I'm from Poland but still I'll download this and seed for u and by the time watch this series again^^
,ElinHime,2008-09-20T01:59Z,"Truly a wonderful series.
Was a bit sceptical about them talking polish before i started watching it, but it realy fitts the fantasysetting.
Thanks for sharing, and thanks to the people that did the subs."
,viciouspixie,2008-10-31T11:37Z,"OMG!

Thank you very much for putting this up! I originally read the book in polish loooong ago.. then ended up picking it in english.. 
I didn't know they made a series out of this, this is fantastic now I can share it with my non polish speaking friends wee! ^_^"
,LeGreque,2009-01-11T17:04Z,Please seed takes ages!!

,inzhuna,2009-03-12T14:36Z,"People! Please seed more!! The speed is less that 1 kB/s, and most of the time its just 0 B/s! Please help!

Thanks!"
,evilminded,2009-10-04T23:29Z,"just watched the first episode... i must say it was quite more then i expected :)

if you liked the game or/and the books then the movie is a must!

thanks to the uploader and especially to the subbers :)"
,kenoxite,2010-01-11T16:42Z,"As others have said, if you have the slightest interest on the game or the book series do yourself a favor and download this. Then seed it.

I was skeptical at first but, believe it or not, this is good stuff! "
,Sebastian011,2010-02-04T12:32Z,"V: 5/10 (512 x 352)
S: 7/10 (The sound is good)

The subtitling sucks, some words are spelled wrong, sometimes they are stacked so it shows everything they say for the next 20 seconds (which fills half the screen) and sometimes there is no subtitles because you read what he said 10 seconds ago, very confusing. But it is definitely watchable "
,Bad213Boy,2012-03-06T03:30Z,Awesome series. I really enjoyed it. I wonder why it never made it to the US. Showtime or HBO could have really done a great job on this series.
,F1R3B2LL,2012-03-26T21:25Z,Epic torrent thanks. I am perma-seeding this. But more people need to seed this & keep on seeding it nevertheless. 
,adripper,2012-06-25T01:33Z,"The subs are not done to well, the special effects on the show are weak.  Chances are that you came here because you fell in love with the Witcher storyline and you wanted more...this delivers.  I'm currently on episode 6 and I am really enjoying this series."
