,strmybkln,2008-03-11T07:39Z,"Guess what, tracks on Not of this Earth and I'm Alright Jack are v.1 DRM'ed. Can't even use FairUse4WM to decrypt.  Had to burn a lossy codec and then rip for even more loss.  Not to bust balls, but if you had the license file, you should have stuck that in there too."
,strmybkln,2008-03-11T07:41Z,"Other than the DRM, good rips, nice job and thanks."
,Kodakwhore,2008-03-14T18:08Z,"Ok guys, I dont know anything about this..Discography I found it downloaded it on EMULE - for your pleasure..
