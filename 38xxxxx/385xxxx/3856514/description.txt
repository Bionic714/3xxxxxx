Felix Nagorsky aka Time Lock was born in the former Soviet Union and raised  
in the northern city...                                                      
...of Carmiel, Israel.                                                        
Felix has been producing music for over a decade. During this time, this      
unique artist has issued numerous releases, first under PPS Project, included 
on labels such as Mdma Records, Dust n Dust rec, Hadshot rec and later as Time
Lock on ZMA rec, Neurobiotic rec, Starsound rec, Columbia music int and

In 2006 Time Lock was awarded the honor to compile the first of the 'Advanced 
Options' compilations, put out by BNE/YoYo and months later contributing his  
massive hit 'Inner Bright' on 'Advanced Options 2'.                          
October 2007 will see the highly anticipated new studio album: 'Prototype    
0.1', once again containing 9 empowering high tech produced tracks. While each
track is different in it's direction, the raw power and Time Lock energy      
unites them. Prototype 0.1 contains thick melodic baselines, Full-On Psy      
Trance, with House and Electro influences, all wrapped in an energetic and    
unique Time Lock style. The album includes a new remix to the immortal Oforia 
hit 'Return of the Machines', with additional collaborations with Quantum and 
Basic.
