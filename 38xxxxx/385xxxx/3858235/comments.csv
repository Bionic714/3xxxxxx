,thomascirca,2007-12-27T03:21Z,"hey stan i have the same problem, it takes a long ass time to load. i can get to the GH3 loading screen, but after that the disc keeps spinning and spinning. i think the best bet is just to borrow the game and copy it with alcohol or dvd decryptor. 

btw what ps2 verison are you running? i'm using the v10 console"
