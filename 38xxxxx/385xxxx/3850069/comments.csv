,matpoubelle,2008-04-16T04:20Z,torrent is dead
,Kottkvarn,2008-04-27T13:39Z,It is very much an alive torrent. I see 8 seeders and I know for a fact I am seeding for hours daily now.
,cajunchef,2009-05-30T15:07Z,"This torrent is indeed alive, it stayed at above 350 kbs, I must admit that I did have one problem, at 99.8% finished, it went dead. I stayed patient, smoked one, came back, and the complete dl took 9 min. Good sound quality, all mp3s. Great up Kottkvam!!!  Will seed for a while. Peace!!!!!"
,cajunchef,2009-05-30T15:10Z,"Oh, and another thing, all 18 tracks....it is the complete album. Thanks again Kottkvarn!!"
