,hornywarney,2007-11-18T01:28Z,"The ones that I opened were ripped at 128kb/s. You may be OK with that quality, to streamish for me! Thanks for the post though."
,Slabbe,2007-11-23T22:06Z,"For being Mp3-128kb/s it's sounds like SHIT. Test this instead:

,BobBag,2007-11-26T21:22Z,"hellrazor69 ...........there is fuck all wrong with the quality. Try new speakers or maybe a cotton bud or 2 and get the crap out between yer lugs.

if you want high quality, by the cd original!you don't have to dow this .hapy new year! FOR ALL!!!"
,QBMan,2008-01-01T03:21Z,128Kb/s is CD quality. I have downloaded all the files and there is nothing wrong with them!! I suggest anyone with an issue should invest in some decent audio hardware!!!! 
,LORD_KaOs,2008-01-15T05:00Z,128Kb/s is CD quality. Well anyone that knows anything about cd quality knows that cd's are at least 160kb/s. However true cd quality is 192kb/s. 128 will do though. i downloaded and the quality is fine. Like the man said if you think the quality sucks then buy some new speakers...LOL
,Puritan,2008-02-18T14:40Z,"The quality isn't good at all!
I wouldn't waste my time, damn already did, ok for all you other guys dont waste the time."
,serious_gamer,2008-03-14T20:17Z,"hellrazor69 , with all due respect, You have no idea what are You talking about, but are entiteld to your opinion..."
,Evil Bastardo,2008-04-06T19:40Z,"Attention Everyone:

CD Bitrate is actually 4110kbps in a .cda file.
So whatever the bit rate is on these it pales in comparison. I'm sure the sound quality in these files is just fine. Try burning them onto CD's and check the sound quality on a GOOD stereo system. 

When ripped with a quality codec even 64kbps will sound OK when played on a good quality system."
,schmallie,2008-04-10T20:11Z,"fan fxxxing tastic thank you verry much .
i mist this in my collection"
,m_furman,2008-04-30T12:38Z,"Thanx 4 great archive, tho' purists may have doubts about quality. First see if you accept the ""Jazz"" album (listen esp. to backing vocals)."
,cornishcowboy,2008-05-15T15:23Z,15 may 2008 quality very good took a while to download but worth the wait.if your a fan of Queen you will be very happy.... cowboy
