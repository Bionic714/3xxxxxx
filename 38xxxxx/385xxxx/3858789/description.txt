"Up, Bustle and Out's flair for the far-flung continues on their third full-length, which incorporates an even wider array of styles than its trip-hop-heavy predecessors. Light 'Em Up has its fair share of beat logic, of course, but the group has filled out the flamenco, Brazilian, and gypsy influences that only peppered previous releases, resulting in an odd, off-kilter, truly original sound." -allmusic.com
