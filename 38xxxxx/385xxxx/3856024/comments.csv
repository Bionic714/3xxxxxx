,backups,2007-10-24T09:26Z,thanks for your upload gametorque i just want to ask how much % dvd shrink says main movie compression was?  you said that source was DVD5 but you also said that you choose maximum sharpness and analysing but those options only apply when recompressing
,gametorque,2007-10-24T14:29Z,"I don't remember what percent exactly cause most of my backups have been awhile and i don't keep track of percent. I don't remember if the movie was dvd9 but probably was. Whenever I shrink a dvd I usually keep everything with menues and such at a fairly high compression and the actual movie at a lower compression so that i don't loose that much quality. the maximum sharpness and analysis usually helps out a great deal and you wouldn't see the quality difference unless you were using a high res screen. i have a 17"" widescreen laptop that has 1920 x 1200 and all my backups look great on it."
,cub91,2007-10-24T15:29Z,"nice upload, but I would have recommended to remove the spanish audio and possibly the DTS-soundtrack to increase the quality..."
,backups,2007-10-24T21:31Z,"im using a dlp projector on a 120"" screen thats why quality is a concern, is there any posibility that you can make a 1:1 DVD9 release??? i think im not the only one looking for good quality :) if you cant i still thank you for this one."

,scooter0011,2008-03-15T18:59Z,"Nice. Always like FULL DVD5s compressed or not. Just want to mention the French audio IS missing. For those who want full quality, go buy it."
