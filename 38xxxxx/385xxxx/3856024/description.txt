This is the full dvd with nothing cut out. I did some tracking and I guess that this is the dvd that has been going for quite some money lately so here is a backup of you investment.

spoken languages are English & French

Subtitles are English & Spanish

Audio is AC3 2-channel, AC3 5.1 surround, and DTS 5.1 surround

all extras and entire disc is intact from the original.

I used dvd shrink to make the iso so use dvd shrink to rip and burn it.

when I backed up this movie I used high settings for analyzing and at maximum sharpness. these are the settings that I use for all dvd's i backup so there is less of a loss in quality. the only loss you would see is in the menues unless the dvd was a dvd5 format in the first place, then there is no loss in quality.

I hope this has made the halloween season bright for all.
