,thewinwizard,2008-01-19T14:38Z,Where's the video? I've dowmloaded this twice and all it contains is audio.
,Catee,2008-02-26T22:55Z,"Thanks so much for providing all of these great videos!  You totally rock krackaboi!

After watching this fine video of yours I realized this was Volume 1 and that there is a Volume 2.  Would you happen to have that one as well?  They advertise it at the end of the show.

Thanks again!"
