,whocares401,2007-10-30T00:18Z,It took long enough to get this file only to find that the instructions for the crack are in German and even then it didn't work. Serial number is not accepted. Anybody got any suggestions?
,tutting,2007-11-11T23:34Z,"Here's how to do it....
Don't put in a serial when you install, set it as the 30 day trial.
Run the software, now use the keygen to get your serial. Choose activate by phone and put newly generated number number into the keygen, this will give you the activation number for the software.
Finally copy over the premiere.dll, overwriting the original. Works for me :-)"
,Mike217,2007-11-23T17:40Z,"Hi

When i try to install it says this version has expired and won't do anything do u have any tips?  Thanks"
,svullos_pekfinger,2007-11-26T19:46Z,"Yeah, it would've been great if you uploaded in some other format than .daa. Beacause you need to have the full PowerIso to open it, at that's not exactly free.. Fuck this."
,alec456,2007-11-29T15:36Z,"Lol, i got free PowerIso, and its working just fine!"
,RedDestroyer,2007-12-01T05:06Z,"For those having problems with ISO files, use WinRAR or ExtractNow."
,Zygote_991,2007-12-06T00:46Z,Hey anybody get a problem after doing the activation and swapping DLL's of the program hanging while it is loading at 120mb of memory?
,hejmeddig123,2008-01-09T19:13Z,Help  i open setup but its says close internet i do and it still says what do i do .? help me 
,SS383,2008-01-10T19:07Z,"All works fine.

Almost full instruction:
1) Download.
2) Convert DAA to ISO with DAA2ISO converter: http://w-shadow.com/files/daa2iso_gui.zip (this build includes GUI frontend).
3) Mount .iso to your virtual CD or just unpack it.
4) Run setup.exe, follow instructions.
5) Run crack\keygen.exe and generate serial.
6) Change date to something before 1 Sep 07.
7) Copy and paste full serial into installation program. (In many apps you need to enter code separately, not there).
NB: Don't use ""trial"" mode, use generator.
8) After install (btw, restart is not actually needed) run program, choose activation by phone, use same keygen to generate activation code. Yeah, at this moment you can enter code only separately, unlike step 7.
9) Replace original Premiere.dll (by default it will be in c:\program files\adobe\adobe premiere pro cs3) by cracked version in ""crack"" dir.
10) Restore the actual date.
11) Enjoy!

Note: With all CS3 apps Adobe installs you a Bonjour services. If you not sure you need it (or maybe it have conflicts with smthg), follow these steps:
a) Create a text file with *.bat or *.cmd extension (use any simple text editor like Notepad), containing the next strings:
sc stop ""Bonjour Service"" 
sc delete ""Bonjour Service""
b) Save and execute it.
c) Download and run LSP-Fix: http://www.cexx.org/LSPFix.exe
d) Check ""I know what I'm doing"", mark mdnsNSP.dll, click "">>"" button and ""Finish"".
e) Restart system & kill Program Files\Bonjour.
f) Have fun."

Listen guys it works for me :D:D only thing you have to do  is like ss383 say put your date before 01 sep 07 then put the srial.. install then go to crack.. find the premiere.dll file copy and go to  C/program/adobe cs3.. put the  premire.dll file there in and start and if ur not sure its for ever.. check help and there is acktivate but its grey cause youve already activated :D
,SS383,2008-02-01T23:56Z,"hejmeddig123, go fuck yourself. ;-)"
,create12,2008-02-10T17:12Z,"I have installed Adobe Premiere CS3 by this torrent. I followed the instructions of tutting. However, when I open the program, it tells me that I need to install additional codecs that are not included on the trial version. These codecs allow you to export video, audio, etc. So I say ok. It gets to about 13% through the installation and then comes up with an error saying that it was unsuccessful. 

Because the additional codecs were unsuccessful during installation, I am not able to export anything. When I try to export, it crashes the program.

Does anyone know what I can do about this? 
Thank you."
,meowing,2008-02-11T03:38Z,WHY are there even people USING that ridiculous .daa format???
,KappaWing,2008-03-31T04:25Z,"Same problem as create12....

Tomorrow I will check if the date thing fixes then, then I will get back to you."
,KappaWing,2008-03-31T13:05Z,"Still doesent work!

Thats not the problem create12, although it may be a part of it. Fuck this shit, I just wasted two days making a video and trying to get it to export."
,KappaWing,2008-04-01T00:56Z,"Create12, I just got it to work! HOORAY!!!!

I run a dual core system. I set the compiling process to run on one of my processors while setting the adobe premiere pro process to run on the other. Adjusted both their priorities to high and had a successful compile!

YARR HARR FIDDLE DI DEE"

To install the attached Keygen. If, when you first start the program expired license is simply ""Premiere.dll"" over the original copy."
,qwertycat,2009-12-04T02:33Z,"I don't get it when I do the phone option, do I have to call them because it tells me too? If I do, is it a machine or a person?"
