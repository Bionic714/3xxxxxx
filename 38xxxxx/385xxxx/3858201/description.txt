
Advanced Energy Research Organization (AERO), LLC ( http://www.aero2012.com ) is a new research and development group formed to develop and strategically protect new energy and propulsion technologies. It is our goal, utilizing a unique strategic approach, to bring forth these new environmentally sound technologies to replace virtually all fossil fuel, internal combustion and ionizing nuclear technologies within 20-30 years.

"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."

- Margaret Mead, anthropologist


About AERO

Advanced Energy Research Organization (AERO), LLC was founded by Steven M. Greer, M.D., in July 2007. AERO is a new research and development group which will develop and strategically protect new energy and propulsion technologies that will completely replace oil, gas, coal, and nuclear power.

AERO is the group that is most strategically ready to develop, disclose and establish the long-suppressed technologies that will enable us to establish a truly sustainable civilization on Earth. 

It is time that humanity move on to its next level of development. This cannot happen with the internal combustion engine and fossil fuels. Time is short. Indeed time- and obscurity- are elements that must be overcome for success to occur.

Company Officers

Steven M. Greer, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer

** August 20, 2007 - AERO CEO Dr. Steven Greer gave a presentation in Bethesda, Maryland, at a meeting (the Advanced Energy Technology Colloquium) to review advanced energy and related technologies.  Several other presentations were given at this time by scientists, and other experts, that are all involved with a massive scientific and technological movement that will radically change the world for the better within the next year, and forever onward. All of these filmed presentations have been archived on Google Video, and this torrent consists of converted copies (.flv to .mp3).  These important presentations, including detailed information that has been recently added (featuring Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, Prof. Dr-Ing. Meyl and others), have been archived at Green Salon: http://www.green-salon.com/presentations.htm (SPONSORED BY THE MACCOBY GROUP: http://www.maccoby.com/ ORDER THEIR LATEST BOOK ?THE LEADERS WE NEED?) **

A SPECIAL REQUEST TO ALL INTERNET BLOGGERS, RADIO HOSTS, ARCHIVISTS, CONCERNED AND AWARE CITIZENS, AND ALL PEOPLE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE REVOLUTION OF ALL REVOLUTIONS THAT IS CRUCIAL FOR HUMANITY AND WILL DO THE MOST TO HELP THE PLANETARY CRISIS WE ALL ARE FACED WITH: PLEASE RESEARCH AND EDUCATE YOURSELVES ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS TORRENT, FROM http://www.aero2012.org/ , IS FOR REAL AND IS POSSIBLE WITHIN A RADICAL NEW UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE, WHICH HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY WORKED OUT.  ONCE YOU ARE SATISFIED OF THIS TRUTH, PLEASE SPREAD THIS MESSAGE AS FAR AND WIDE AS POSSIBLE BY POSTING LINKS, SHARING MULTIMEDIA DISCS, TALKING WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY, AND INFORMING PEOPLE IN SOCIETAL POSITIONS WHO NEED TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION.  THE POWER AND SUPPORT BEHIND A.E.R.O. IS ALREADY IMMENSE, BUT THE RESISTANCE AND SUPPRESSION AGAINST RADICAL CHANGE REQUIRES AN INTENSE GRASSROOTS EFFORT.  ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN CONTRIBUTING FINANCIALLY TO THIS CRITICAL EFFORT, BY INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF LIFE ON EARTH, CAN DO SO BY CONTACTING A.E.R.O.

The following list of advanced energy and related technologies were reviewed during July and August 2007.  Follow-on events are scheduled in Washington D.C. as early as this fall, to include National Press Club briefings and meetings with members of Congress.  Next August, the 14th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (ICCF 14) will also be held in Washington D.C., an event that has already secured $250K in sponsorship funding.  ICCF 14 is being organized by Dr. David Nagel ( http://www.ece.gwu.edu/people/nagel.htm ) and is sponsored in part by members of the International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science ( http://www.iscmns.org/ ).
