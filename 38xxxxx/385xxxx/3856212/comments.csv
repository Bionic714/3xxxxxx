I'm still not used to the idea of not finding Oink present every day after work but life goes on.
New places to search and visit in the hope to find one as good as dear old Oink.
Oh and thanx for the music activist."

Thanks a lot for the upload. Klaus is really one of the greatest. Sadly, some problems occur when I try to burn the files on a music CD. As the NERO program tells me that the files failed to be added to a compilation. Anyone please...  "
