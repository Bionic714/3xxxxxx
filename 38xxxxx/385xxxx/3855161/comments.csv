,DuckBuck,2009-01-18T22:51Z,"@ M.w.a: You are just another dork, with nothing better to do but submit crappy and highly insane comments! Get a life! Message boards are to post useful information dude and not bigotory, slanderous crap like you take pride in posting! For a comical way to understand jerks like M.w.a, hit Youtube and key in sister salad and look for Yo Comments Are and enjoy their spin off on lame idiotic comments like M.w.a's"
,Bytes.NL,2009-03-27T22:09Z,"Eeeejj Jay2k8 THNXXXZZ for the serialszzz.
Yes my scannner was hitting the bell also but heee its not your fold and also not your problem because most the keygens i use are discovered as unpure by my scanner but it does not mean there is a REAL threat.....(Kaspersky deleted my trail extender for KISS 2009 GRRRRR)
If you want to use piracy apps or games you have to take the risk and do NOT cry and SCREAM for your mammie  if you get infected.
By the way, these keygens are no poblem at all...."
