Overview: In the days of the Ming Dynasty, dozens of wicked eunuchs overrun the government. The White Haired Mantis (martial arts superstar Sammo Hung) and the Tien Law Net Set kill everyone who opposes their leader, Wei Chung Hsien (Chang Yi). Yung (Carter Wong), the escaped son of one of their victims, finds refuge in the Shaolin Temple. Ten years later, Yung is well-versed in the ways of Shaolin and, after defeating the 18 bronze men, is allowed to leave the Temple. Yung teams up with a group of defectors from the Tien Law Net Set and Yuan Hsiao (Polly Shang Kwan), "adopted" by Hsien after he butchered her parents. Together they must prepare for their ultimate test--and face pure White Haired fury!
