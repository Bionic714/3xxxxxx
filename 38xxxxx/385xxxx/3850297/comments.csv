,thebatman_1,2007-10-22T11:30Z,"Ok figured it out.

Extract the files with WinRaR.

Then you need DAEMON TOOLS. 
Mount the finished attracted file to DAEMON TOOLS and it will start to install automatically.
Once finished you will not yet be able to play it.
Attract the CD CRACK and drag it in the FOOTBALL MANAGER 2008 file and it will work perfectly.
Started playing and its fantastic. Thanks for the upload Folkvord01."

Try this.
Go to the folder where you installed the game and right click on the icon fm (the one that starts the game). Choose ""preferences"" and then ""Compatibility"" (not sure if it's called that but it should be something similar). There were you can chose between ""windows 2000"", ""windows NT 4"" and such you can unchech that box.

1. Download torrent.
2. Extract htd-fm08.rar
3. Mount Cue file in Daemon Tools.
4. After installation open up the HATRED file and the proper Football Manager File (Windows > Programs > Sports Interactive > Football Manager 2008).
5. Move the FM08.exe (from HATRED file) into the proper Football Manager file.
6. Click ""yes"" to replace. And then just click on the .exe and voila!

Hope it works for you guys :)"
