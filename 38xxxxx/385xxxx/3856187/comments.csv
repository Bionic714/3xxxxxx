Fuckin trance is the most stagnant genre in any musical respect and these douche bag club kids keep makin these cock suckin DJs think they are the shit. Ewww Im a college student, I do E and i luv Oakenfold. Total garbage music, literally the same shit song just remade 8 billion times, Honestly reevaluate your musical taste if you waste your time getting this shit, fuckin candy kids and tool box club dorks.

,airxin,2007-11-02T14:24Z,"Trichome, l I just registered to piratesbay to tell you how sad and pathetic you are.
You just got told how retarded you are from 4 people (now 5) not because you hate this genre of music but because you sit there wasting your time on telling us your opinion about Paul Oakenfold. Like we give a shit about some angry fuck ups opinion. 

Get a life and maybe a girl friend (if your capable of that) and stop wasting your time and everyone else's. 

Go masturbate or sumthing fucking faggot.

:]

Oh and I'm sure there is gonna be more comments about how fucking retarded you are.

,poonflap,2009-12-06T22:19Z,"Trichrome...Paul Oakenfold is one of the founding fathers of the genre.  Ever hear of Perfecto Records? That's his fuckin' label! Perfecto Records has been around since before I ever touched a turntable. We are talking mid 90's. Who knows when your mother shit you out of her ass, but in case you were still just a peanut in your mom's impacted ass canal:  For the record...music sucked back then! Shit like: ""James Brown is Dead,"" ""Speed Racer,"" ""Cotton Eyed Joe."" It all pretty much sucked. Too much of that techno organ bullshit. If it wasn't for the efforts of dude's like Paul Oakenfold, Joey Beltram, Laurent Garnier, Moby and William Orbit; techno would have merely been an offshoot of New Wave/ Industrial music. These people made techno palatable for the masses and gave it a fuckin' soul of it's own. And even though he travels the world with his own entourage of hot ass strippers and raver bitches, he isn't as full of himself as you might expect him to be.  I met him back in 2001.
(Fuckin' riot cops showed up an hour into his set. My homie lost about $15,000 on that fuckin' party.) 
Not to brag or boast or anything. Cool is a way of life.  And I was as cool in the 90's as I am fuckin' now.  Suck it, douchebag."
