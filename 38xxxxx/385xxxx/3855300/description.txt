Here is a collection of materials on antigravity and free energy. Mostly these pertain to the work of T. T. Brown, but there is some other stuff thrown in also. There is some stuff here on generating indefinite amounts of energy from certain minerals and elements. (rock batteries...) There is enough info here to keep a serious researcher busy for a lifetime!
