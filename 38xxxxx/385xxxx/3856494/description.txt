The three members of A Mountain Of One come from  
the world of underground techno, being studio      
hounds and beat-masters, and they're familiar      
with the demands of clubs and dancers. But the    
music they make as A Mountain Of One would only    
have value in discotheques with beds: it has      
already been tagged by those canny folk at Vice    
magazine as "future Balearic classics". AMO1      
themselves recall the experimental dance outfits  
of the early 90s such as Ultramarine and the Orb,  
whose epic, exploratory ambient techno was        
steeped in krautrock and the "Canterbury Scene"    
of Soft Machine et al. Early-70s fetishists,      
their songs, often 10 minutes long, are slow and  
meanderingly melodic, and their ambition is to    
make the 21st century Dark Side Of The Moon.      
Their lead singer has the tremulous voice of a    
latter-day Bryan Ferry and their music is epic    
with pretensions towards the elegiac and          
exquisite.                                        
A Mountain Of One love the 70s, only instead of    
punk and disco it's to the proggy and dreamy,      
elegant yet enervated West Coast 70s of the Floyd  
and Fleetwood Mac that they aspire: Ride, their    
limited-edition debut single from last summer      
which sold out in days, recalled the luscious MOR  
motorik of Lindsey Buckingham's compositions for  
the Mac. The recent EP2, which also sold out      
immediately, furthered their adventures beyond    
the ambient-techno ultraworld in fine style: lead  
tracks Innocent Line and People Without Love      
(featuring beat poet Jamie Kelsey) are typical of  
AMO1's serene electronica, reminiscent of          
Avalon-era Roxy Music, with its sense of a        
pastoral idyll in the urban jungle. New single    
Brown Piano is to be lifted as a single from      
their forthcoming EP compilation, and comes with  
a remix from Swedish GUM favourites Studio. It    
was recorded at James Lavelle/Unkle's All          
Surrender studio with Pablo Clements of            
Psychonauts, with whom they achieved the song's    
strange, disorientating effect, making it sound    
as though it could have come from any period from  
the last 35 years of sonic British invention. The  
Studio remix accentuates the slow-but-steady chug  
of AMO1's dubbishly spacious psych-kraut motorik  
MOR.                                              
A Mountain Of One's Collected Works is not a      
greatest hits compilation but rather the debut    
album release, made up of two EPs and one new      
track, from a London-based collective consisting  
of three core members. It is unlike any other      
album you'll hear this year.
