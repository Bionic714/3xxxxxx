Overview: When Hong Kong's new wave, gravity-defying action style hit the scene in the early 1980s, so did a new wave of actors: Canto-pop stars. "Little Dragon Maiden" intelligently mixed the old with the new to create pure golden magic as kung fu fighting veterans Chen Kuan Tai and Lo Lieh joined relative newcomer Leslie Cheung in a far-out, costume-action love story that really cooks. Cheung garnered international recognition in John Woo's "A Better Tomorrow".
