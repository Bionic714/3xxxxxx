Best Orvar8."
,snubbedpeer,2008-05-11T02:20Z,What a pathetic album. Not a single track is worth remembering. The only reason to download this sordid album is to find out what a completely hopeless guy Charles Manson was. Good thing that he is still in prison. May he remain there until his death.
,TheGreyFox,2008-07-01T00:35Z,lol what a guy
,TheToughestBloke,2008-11-14T00:18Z,"Quite a daft bastard indeed, but some of the things he said were very true."
,jwinthrop,2009-01-07T23:56Z,Sick City is a very disturbing song (and kind of catchy too).  It gives you an eerie glimpse into what was going through his mind.
,JustinStAnarchy,2009-04-04T09:30Z,yea he was a sycopath but his music is catchy and i find it interesting.....
,thoughtc,2009-09-08T12:31Z,"this music is amazing. think about the guy behind it is kind of creepy, but it adds to the music in a way. the crazy part is alot of what Manson says is true."
,geojamo2525,2012-02-17T23:52Z,he can play and sing. nothing special but better than some. certainly had potential. would have been good with a co writor or editor but I dont think thats manson's style lol
,Mortified-Penguin,2012-05-10T02:34Z,"Great songs 
Charlie shoulda been a musician not a hobo"
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-07-30T00:23Z,"If Manson wasn't who he is, nobody would give a rat's arse about his music. He almost made it big with The Beach Boys, but they recognised him for what he is; an untalented nutjob."
