The actual file is only 327k, the rest (21 MB) is Adobe Reader!!
Why force ppl to download shit they probably already have, or won't use if they don't?

Not all BitTorrent clients allow you to choose which files you want. 

IOW: thanks for sharing the ebook, but please don't over burden people with adobe shit they don't need."
,eatmybiscuits,2008-05-23T19:54Z,"It's only CHAPTER 1 AND 2!!

the same version is available on Gutenberg free.. why is it being torrented??

I read the manifesto, but WTF? At least make a note of the missing other 14 chapters, instead of passing this shit off as the real thing, and attaching some political message to it.
