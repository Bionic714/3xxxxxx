,mrspock09,2007-10-22T17:38Z,"thanks for the hack. its a lot of fun, but you may want to tell people this hacks not for kids to play lol. but so far everything seems in sync"
,brokenhope8,2007-10-22T18:02Z,"haha yeah, this is R-Rated.  Try selecting the Grim Reaper and look at his scythe"
,mrspock09,2007-10-22T18:18Z,"ok will do and i just found 1 song that was out of sync so far. its ""Halloween"" - Helloween (Encore) but thats it so far"
,samsungman,2007-10-30T21:23Z,"Brokenhope, these customs metal versions are awesome!  

One question though, Quest for Fire?!  Why oh why!  hahah oh well, it's still maiden at least. 

Oh and it always freezes going into practice mode for me(cause i suck and need to practice) is that a known bug?  Seems odd since you have the song sections all laid out.

Anyways, keep up the good work!  \m/"
,Stragd_gh2,2007-11-04T20:23Z,samsungman - it's common to remove the practice mode versions of songs to reduce the size of the ISO.  Since this is only 1Gb I'm sure that's what he did.
