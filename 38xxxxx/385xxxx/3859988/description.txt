In morte veritas. Georgia Byrd clerks at a New Orleans department store.
She defers pleasure: cooks gourmet meals, eats Lean Cuisine; likes a 
co-worker in silence; has savings, but hasn't left Louisiana. All that
changes when an MRI discloses she has three weeks to live. She cashes her
savings and heads to Europe's Grandhotel Pupp, where Chef Didier presides.
She checks into the Presidential Suite, orders everything on the menu,
snowboards, and comes to the attention of the chef and the hotel's powerful
American guests: a Congressman, a Senator, a retail magnate, and his
mistress. She has nothing to lose, so she tells them what she thinks.
Will the truth set them free?
