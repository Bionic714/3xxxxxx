newest nod 32



skip step 1-2  if you don't have nod32 installed.

1. unstall nod32. i would prefer with your uninstaller 2006, to get rid of unneeded registery files.

2. reboot

3. if you uninstalled (or don't have it installed) nod 32, install the application.

4. DON'T! USE THE USERNAME+PASSOWRD LOCATED AT THE NFO FILE! use the already printed in username+password

5. install and DON'T reboot. start the patch and patch.

6. reboot now.

7. enjoy! :)
