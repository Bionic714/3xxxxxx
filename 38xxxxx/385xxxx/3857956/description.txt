A myths revisited special. Were Jamie and Adam responsible for a trombone travesty? 
Did the exploding hammers myth strike a low blow? As well as two other high-calibre 
myths. First, a myth that has long been a bone of contention with fans. A trombonist 
wants to put a bang into the 1812 Overture so he fills his mute with firecrackers. 
When they go off, the force of the blast turns the trombone slide into a musical 
missile which strikes the conductor and knocks him into the audience. But no matter 
how much black powder Jamie packed into the trombone, the slide wouldn't fly. 
Fans have been demanding an encore performance ever since.
