,Razorbladesoup,2007-10-23T19:07Z,"anyone else having a problem with this?
im running it on a fresh install of xp..2ghz cpu 1gb ram and a geforce 6600gt
when i run portal the hl2.exe pops up under proccesses...then disapears and never runs"
,psmaniac,2007-10-23T19:29Z,"Razorbladesoup i had some problems, but i ran it with the ""my pc sucks"" then changed the video settings inside and it works fine now.
you should try that.

this is the only good rip out there. all the rest that are just Portal and not the other mods don't work at all. just noob packers i guess."
,SENSEIDA,2007-10-23T23:34Z,"Razorblade soup I'm having the same problem you are, and Psmaniac- IT's not going to work like that. He and I run either batch file, and it will get to the blurry splash screen, and shut down. There are no options to change videos or anything.

I also have more than enough specs, and Dx9.0

Any help, people? "

,Mota77,2007-10-28T03:01Z,"i think it might be possible to get a saved game to work on portal, if placed in the right location. but as much as i search through google, etc, i cant find any sources where you can get a save file, so good luck to anyone out there with this problem. it looks like steam/valve really didnt want this one to get pirated... to bad for them since some people are becoming successful Xd"
,dpdpdpdpdp600,2007-10-28T08:54Z,"Damn Dopeman, last one I dl'd was 2.5 GB's, impressive upload 583.32 MiB, wow!

Probably because of ""no bonus developers commentaries""  ? 

regardless, great game, great upload, ty."
,dpdpdpdpdp600,2007-10-28T08:57Z,"Mota77 there is no way to get a new game up and running?  I myself can upload a save file right at the start of the game,  you'd have to drop it in Potal/SAVE folder, is this the problem, does anyone need a start save?"

,GhostShoes,2007-10-29T18:27Z,"Works Perfect! This is the best Portal RIP I've played. All I had to do was run MyPCSuks.bat and everything ran fine.

Though it could've been because of my computer.
Note: Don't finish the advanced chambers or else it crashes the game due to it trying to access Steam for Achievements.

Theres really no way to fix this but you can play the entire game without it."

,pravoslavnie,2007-11-01T19:14Z,Jolt_Boy: did you edit that batch file in notepad to see the switches in there?  mabye google on those switches and you may find what setting you need to put back to what is was before.  ??...  just trying to help.
,pravoslavnie,2007-11-01T19:15Z,"Does it matter what compression utility you use to unzip this?  I use IZArc.  So far, I think the people who have been successful use Winrar, right?"

,pravoslavnie,2007-11-01T19:28Z,"Jolt_Boy: yes, a batch file is a .bat file.  Right click and do ""edit"" or ""open with"" and choose notepad.  or open notepad and do 'file' > 'open' and browse to the batch file in question.

I still need help with my issue so if anyone can write a comment I would greatly appreciate it.  Otherwise, I will have to buy this game!  BTW, I am a seeder!"
,Jolt_Boy,2007-11-01T19:34Z,"Hmm. I'm not sure but, I downloaded some nVIDIA Drivers yesterday. You think that's why I can't change the graphics? I think you need older drivers rather than newer. Sound weird, I know but It's worth a try.

Excuse my shitty english."
,pravoslavnie,2007-11-01T19:54Z,Jolt_Boy: i would think the newer drivers are the way to go.  i've never heard of having to downgrade your driver version just to be able to play a 3D game.  you can try it if you'd like of course.

Jolt_Boy:  I don't know what to do about your graphics settings.  If you have nVidia, use the nVidia control panel to force higher quality settings for that .exe file.  Also, at the beginning of the game, do you have an option to change video settings?  I would tell you where to go in the Portal menu, but I CAN'T GET TO THE MENU, AGGGGHH!  ;-)"

,axxofan,2007-11-02T15:36Z,"OK Well. My Original problem came from Portal Unleashed version. When all else failed I wanted to try my_pc_sucks_portal etc to see if that would help (even though my pc doesn't suck) so I downloaded this version in much less time and it works beautifully! Strangest thing I dont even need the my_pc_sucks to play, full screen, full graphics, and loving it.   

For anyone with directx problem, downloading this version instead of Unleashed allowed me to finally play, good luck!"

Make a shortcut out of hl.exe, goto it's proporties and where it says ""C:\whatever\hl2.exe"" add there (after "") this: -game portal
when you see whiteness there is no other way than just copy parameters from ""My_CoMp_Sucks.bat"" file SO:
""C:\whatever\hl2.exe"" -game portal -window -dxlevel 81 +mat_forcehardwaresync 0


HAVE FUN :]"
,Lintlizard,2007-11-06T23:44Z,"I just went to the DirectX site and got the latest edition, AND followed Zielak's instructions. It's still telling me the game has a minimum requirement of DirectX 8.0 to run properly."
,djnforce9,2007-11-07T02:13Z,Wow! Download speeds are fast on this one (and I'm behind a school firewall so that's saying something right there). I'll have it no time. Looking forward to trying. Thanks everyone for seeding. I'll seed myself when I get home with this. Looks great!
,Zielak69,2007-11-07T17:01Z,"Lintlizard, sry to hear that though, can't help with it.."
,Marohen,2007-11-07T22:29Z,"It looks like a great game... but... It crashes right after going through the first portal, and always does so despite any change in graphics setting I attempt. Any help on this would be muchly appreciated."
,Marohen,2007-11-07T22:41Z,"Upon further investigation the act of going through the portal itself is not the cause of the crash, but some sort of possible rendering error I can't identify. If I look at the ground and pass the portal, sticking to the outer wall and not looking at the cell I once was in, I can prevent crashing for an extended length of time. I will re-extract the file to see if a missing object is the cause..."
,Marohen,2007-11-09T01:15Z,"Never mind. Upon further examination the problem in question was due to my on-board video processing. As powerful as my laptop may be, it just can't deal with this.

My problem is that I double-click both bat files, prompt comes up a split second, then goes out (that's normal) and then NOTHING.

I tried to run the bat files via the cmd window. All I got was a lousy Made by comment. Nothing else.

I DON'T have any exe anywhere. Could the original uploader explain how to make this darn thing work like a normal program? (Normal= double-cilk exe and games starts)... If not, well then can anyone explain what I should do to actually have a first screen up at all?"
,jingizu,2007-11-15T13:56Z,"@smumdax, hl2.exe should be in the same folder as the bat-files, if its not, you have done something wrong at decompression, also, IF the file is there, and i still dont work, try this (cmd in same folder as hl2.exe) ; ""hl2.exe -game portal -window -dxlevel 81 +mat_forcehardwaresync 0"" without the """"

dont know why, but the bat-files dont execute as they should for some reason, there is no fault in the batfile, im *guessing* that its an ""feature"" added in some update by M$ :S

(oldtimey way of creating lame viruses was through batfiles).

Also as allready stated by others, the endgame music MUST win atleast an grammy, or why not MTV:EMA? =) best god damn tune of the year! ;D

also, game is waaay to short :/

The problem now is that I have deleted the Rar file to free up some space... I now have to re-download the whole thing... and that is not fun.

But like any wise guy who easily replies the following no-brainer to complainers: it's pirated and free, so stop whining.. pfffff... Crap is free... Would you not complain if I was to throw it in your face once and a while?

,slippiefist,2008-02-17T21:26Z,"@devilsrage

I was having both problems mentioned by people in these comments:  when I click either .bat nothing happens, when I start from the .exe it works but nothing happens when I click the new game button. This is how I got it to work:

Make a shortcut to h2.exe. Right click on the shortcut, choose Properties. Go to the Shortcut tab. In the Target box, add these parameters at the end, after the quotes:

 -game portal -dxlevel 81 +mat_forcehardwaresync 0

So the Target box should contain:

""C:\Program Files\PoRTaL\hl2.exe"" -game portal -dxlevel 81 +mat_forcehardwaresync 0

(assuming you put the game in C:\Program Files\PoRTaL)

If you're on Vista, you may want to go to the Compatibility tab and choose Run this program in compatibility mode for XP SP2. 

Push apply, then OK. Use that shortcut to start the game, it should work. Good luck. Great game."

I have posted about having problems myself, and the fact is, that if you cannot get through the first portal (containment cell to outside room) in the beginning of the game, or you have the light with swirling polygons portal, oyu must upgrade your graphics memory. If your computer is dated and has a regular PCI Bus like mine, I recommend the GeForce 6200, because it is cheap, and it seems to be working fine for me. On another note, thanks for the rip dopeman!

You cant patch unless there is a specific dopeman patch.
You cant play online unless you use a private server.
You will need to install directx and /or ageis phsyx which will be included.

Try upgrading to a card that uses NV20/R200 or later G/VPUs. ie GeForce 3/Radeon 9000 or later, excluding GeForce 4 MX

Also try updating your drivers.

btw I had a few glitch the first time

1. You can never click on hl2.exe
2. Play_portal.bat wont work the first time
3. Click on MyPC_SuKS_PoRTaL.bat. I changed it to 800x600. that's all
4. Play_portal.bat is working now.

Only problem is that the sound skips a bit, like when GlaDos is talking it will skip forward and cut off a random word/letter in her little speeches. 
It's annoying, but hopefully it will go away. Nothing that makes it unplayable, though. ;]

Thanks Dopeman for another clean, easy to use torrent!"
,camydoger,2008-12-28T17:35Z,"Yeah this works great on my laptop but on my desktop it does the ""First portal crashes the game"" thing. That is proof that it isnt the game thats bad, its your pc nothing else.

Also, some of the textures dont load properly and come out as purple. I suppose it helps to identify non-portable walls."

,NeftyPR,2009-01-08T09:00Z,"Working 100%. Sometimes it randomly crashes. Sad thing is that I beat the game about 1 or 2 hours. But it has unlocks, achievements and its very very fun to play. You can download custom maps too, I downloaded 40 Levels, they are very hard, Im kinda stuck. Heres the link http://portalmaps.wecreatestuff.com/

I get arround 25-50 FPS with MyPC_SuKS_PoRTaL, at low settings.
I get arround 10-25 FPS with Play_PoRTaL, at low settings.

My Specs:
Intel Pentuim 4 2.4ghz
Nvidia Geforce 6200 A-LE 256mb AGP
1GB Ram
80GB HD

IT HAS CONSOLE STOP SAYING IT DOESNT. 
To Activate it, go to:
Options>Controls>Advanced...>Enable developer console

You can activate NoClip:
Press ~ to activate console
Type in: sv_cheats 1
Then: noclip
To deactivate it, type noclip again in console.

NoClip lets you go all around the map and ""cheat"". You can use this when you are stuck. If you are stuck google any walkthrough or go to YouTube then look for the chamber you are trapped.

Go to FPSBanana.com to download maps, skins and much more for alot of games including Portal.

Have fun."

If you're having the error happen after the first Portal I can confirm that it is most likely a graphics card problem. I recently moved from a Geforce2 to a Geforce4 Ti and the game works now. 

http://mixman.res.lt/?status=articles&show=4

Hope that link works. If not, go to YouTube and search Half Life 2 Directx Fix. The link should be in the 'more info' part.

The site has patches for the Engine.dll for Half Life 2 Ep2, Portal and Team Fortress 2 for people with Directx  7 cards. 

I can't confirm that it will work for Portal but it's a possibility.

The Ep2 one. I wouldn't bother. You'll have many graphical issues. Rainbow colors included, lol.

I've never had a problem with a Dopeman release that couldn't be easily fixed. It's always in the NFO or requires something simple like renaming a folder. 

Thank you Dopeman for you many, fantastic releases.

Thank you dopeman!

,Morphie,2009-08-20T01:17Z,"Dopeman's version of Portal -> SUCKS. Sorry to say this, it is Way More Buggy than the other torrent 'Portal - Unleashed' the first thing I discovered of Dopeman's version was the bonus levels crashing... cheap RIPs like this suck ass!

I suggest http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3837572/Portal-Unleashed I have tried the both versions and I can tell 100% sure that Portal-Unleashed is better version and works flawlessly for a RIP and you can make it to be detected in Steam also."

Even so in the end after the final battle I'm got a cenario mostly with black and purples squares and the manetence areas have a lot of purple.

,Oxyfast,2010-01-23T18:43Z,"THANK YOU DOPEMAN!

I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely think you, Doperman, for this upload and the numerous others of yours that I have downloaded and enjoyed greatly recently. 

I can't even believe some of the comments on this (and all) torrents. 
For example: ""Thanks for wasting a couple of hours of my life, I installed it then followed the shitty instructions and it didn't work, I won't be downloading from you again.... ""

I can't imagine what this kiddo is like in real life. Probably the kid that all the teachers hate and none of the kids want to sit by. The kid that gets a new car for 13th birthday and throws a fit and kicks it because he doesn't like the color. 
I just don't understand what this person is even thinking...
To the kiddo that wrote that and all of the comments like it: Go play in traffic, don't come bitching like a prom queen to a good torrent because you are ""bad at computer"". The person who put out this (obviously good) torrent put a lot of effort into ripping it, packaging it, accurately .nfo-ing it, and seeding it initially. What did you do? Probably nothing, you probably don't upload more than 3kbps while downloading and sure as fuck don't seed. You've done nothing. The people who rip these and the people who seed them do these things for community benefit and AS A GIFT in a sense, so don't come running your mouth as though you were owed this.
This torrent happens to be perfect, however if it were not that would not give reason to leave a personal attack on the poster. Only that the torrent didn't work for you - Beggars can not be choosers. 
The next time any of you idiots like 55Slickuser look a gift horse in the mouth and blabs around like a toddler, I hope it straight kicks you in the cunt on your face that you call a mouth.

ANYHOW - 
This torrent is perfect, 100%. I had no issue whatsoever using the standard .bat file to start it. No missing textures, graphics issues, broken levels, missing sound, none of that at all. Unrar and play. Perfect.

I've learned I can trust Dopeman rips at this point. His Half Life Ep. 1 and Half Life Ep. 2 are also perfect. The single very minor issue involving an NPC not boarding a train in Ep. 2 is discussed at length in the Dopeman readme and includes a simple fix for it. That is quality. (if you look at the comments on there you can see all of the 55Slickuser type of third graders crying about the elevator problem, clearly never having read the readme or any of the dozens of comments. If it werent for the fact they had to type their message to begin with, I swear I'de think these people couldn't read)"

,jra64,2010-02-15T12:18Z,"How do you get normal settings back?!

I ran MyPC_SuKS_PoRTaL.bat and now the settings won't go back to the badass graphical settings.  I reinstalled, even downloaded a different Portal torrent, still nothing.  In the bat I see it sets these settings:

hl2.exe -game portal -window -dxlevel 81 +mat_forcehardwaresync 0

I can't seem to change those in settings, if I copy the bat and change them there (which I haven't tried yet) it will probably work.

- After finishing any ""Bonus Level"" the game crashed. Every time.

,superfastracer,2011-05-01T22:16Z,"this torrent works perfect on all my computers, never ever had a virus from dopeman, can't escape trolls where ever u go online."
,superbull,2011-05-04T03:14Z,he's probably right...this game is only 600 mb...the actual portal game is about 6 gb..portal two is about 10 gb...i'm not downloading..i don't know about you...
,FiveManX,2011-05-10T04:22Z,It works. No trojans or anything. If you are worried about viruses and trojans etc. then why are you on The Pirate Bay?
,Slammer94,2011-05-19T00:48Z,Have you ever noticed how people who post VIRUS ALERTS in all caps and write it about a billion times are always wrong? This is COMPLETELY clean. [dopeman] is always to be trusted. Works brilliantly off a flashdrive too. Enjoy one of the coolest puzzle games ever created.
,lolmaker1998,2011-05-23T18:02Z,"thanks dopeman

all your cracks are working perfectly om my computer :D
