,CrazyJake,2007-10-24T09:11Z,"After 24 hours waiting for downloaders, I recreated the torrent and listed it under 'Music' for better exposure.

If you want this concert video, search under Video, keyword 'tagalog' should list it.

The torrent is already being downloaded under Music so I will NOT be seeding it here under Video... :)"
,CrazyJake,2007-10-24T09:12Z,I must be tired. Search under 'Audio' NOT Video... :)
,Irog,2009-02-02T20:42Z,"This torrent has no seeds so you cannot download it in its entirety.  After a week of staying signed in, the most I could get was 85 percent.  Been stuck there for days.  Waste of time."
,Irog,2009-02-02T20:45Z,My bad!  The torrent listed under audio is seeded. Sorry...
