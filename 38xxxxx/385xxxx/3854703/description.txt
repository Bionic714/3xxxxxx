AEGIS - Live in Calgary (Sep 30/2007)

To our knowledge this is the first authorized concert recording
of an Aegis concert. The concert is complete, from start to finish
and was captured by a fixed center camera and two roving stage cameras.

The audio and video quality of the original DVD is excellent.
In an effort to preserve the audio and video quality as much as possible
and still have a reasonable download size, I decided to allow a file size
of just over 1.1GB using the XviD codec instead of compressing this to the
typical 700MB range.

For Aegis fans, this concert is a MUST HAVE... :)
