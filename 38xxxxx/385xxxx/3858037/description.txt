I mourn the loss of oink.cd by uploading everything I got from there that is not on TPB yet :)

from wikipedia:

Boss Buckle EP is the first recording released by the Alaskan metal band 36 Crazyfists. At the time of release, in 1995, the band were not widely know, and therefore this EP is very rare. This is one of the three EP albums that the band released prior to being signed to Roadrunner Records.

This EP features a much more raw sound than that found on later 36 Crazyfists releases, the songs are more unusual and rapcore influenced vocals are evident.
