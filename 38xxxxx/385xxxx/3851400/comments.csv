,dchiou,2008-02-27T21:19Z,"i watched a bit of this movie, very funny. But a little confusing. THanks for the upload, will seed"
,Zetareticuli,2008-03-03T21:10Z,"The quality is great, but it has subtitles embedded in the video that I can't turn off. I'd rather not watch subtitles through the whole movie unless I need to translate a foreign language."
,AngryBadger,2008-03-27T12:46Z,"Subs aren't hard coded mate, disable them from within your player."
,mmx9999,2008-05-08T10:01Z,"Great qualitity, but you have to set the aspect ratio manually (1,85:1). The subtitles are annoying, you also have to turn them off manually. So far no problems with GOM player."
