Cartoon rating guide for the smart adult: v1.2, 1/2007



Note: This is a rating guide, not a review book -- hit up Google & Wikipedia, then Amazon and IMDB forums for extended analyses. It's purpose is to quickly alert you to animation you may never have heard of. It is also skewed from the perspective of an adult animation fan -- a lowly-rated show may be immensely enjoyable for small children and even competently-made, but was of little interest to me; a highly-rated show will be competently-made, and may or may not be enjoyable for or even marketed to small children. Lastly, if a show has English-language versions, those are the versions I have likely watched (and I appreciate good dubbing and loathe bad dubbing).



This list covers mainly animated television series, although several films are included. I have not seen every episode of some shows rated 7 and lower and many episodes of shows rated 5 or lower; indicated ratings may change if I see new episodes of better or worse qualify than those previous, or if many better or worse episodes of other shows alter the landscape.
