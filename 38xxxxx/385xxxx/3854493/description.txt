Someone once said that if slaughterhouses had glass walls everyone would be a 
vegetarian. Slaughterhouse - The Task Of Blood is that glass wall. 
This powerful observational documentary reveals the day-to-day workings of a 
small, family-run abattoir and attempts to get inside the minds of the people 
who work there.
