However, The download did not unpack under Windows Vista.

Regardless of the folder I select, There is a pop out message asking me to change the folder.

,stormindes,2008-10-26T18:01Z,"Guys, V.8 onwards & Vista. 64 bit version is a bitch to get working. ODBC drivers do not exist for 64bit O/S, you cannot force 32bit to load in preference over 64bit. All 32bit DB's are rendered useless.  Google 64bit ODBC issues to find out more and then be depressed...
Otherwise, great software :( when working!

,whitefang_razorblade,2008-12-29T08:06Z,"I tried it on an online server because my trial version expired so I tried the keygen and i works great except that after few days like two weeks adobe finds out about it. I don't how but they just shut the coldfusion down. 

Can you guys give me an advise because i'm not paying 7K for this software it's too much. Is there a way to prevent coldfusion from sending information to adobe, or adobe from accessing my server to check my serial key. 

My plan is to use peerguardian to prevent certain IP's or www.adobe.com/ website from accessing my server. But my question is will it prevent my coldfusion from sending info to adobe (outgoing)? "
