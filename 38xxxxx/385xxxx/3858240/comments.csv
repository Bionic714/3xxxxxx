Thanks"
,H-2-O,2007-10-26T09:24Z,It works fine (and downloaded much faster for me than the other file) and to get it work you have to select the .rar file (and NOT any of the .001 etc.. file) to also get the .MDS and not only the .MDF... simple trick
,Brtttt,2007-10-26T09:44Z,whats the difference between this one and the non multi for english users? nothing im guessing?
,matlo,2007-10-28T10:50Z,"I can't mount the file :( ive tried, alcohol 120% and Daemontools, and then i read that some one said that you have to use Daemontools pro advance 4.0... etc but when im trying to start the program it says ""Error: The application is corrupted."" any ide? I really want to play this game :("
,ka_sick,2007-10-29T21:17Z,"So it works. U have to do it like this. When u have already installed the game (like me) do it this way.

1. Get Daemon Tools Pro. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3860616/Daemon_Tools_Pro_4100218___working_crack.rar
2. Deinstall old DT and Install this one.
3. DO AS SAID IN THE NFO. !!!!! 
4.Then start Daemon Tools Pro. 
5.In the DT Pro Windows, click the 6th icon from the left on the TOP Toolbar. ""Add IDE Virtual Drive""
6. Mount this Image http://m0001.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_the_witcher.shtml
7. Play and have fun."
,alkkfkfkfkkf,2007-10-31T23:13Z,"hm, this is strange, I was able to play it for a couple of days, but now all the sudden it asks for the correct dvd, even though I have it mounted in a virtual SCSI drive in deamon tools, just like I did earlier :S "
,electron6633,2007-11-02T10:18Z,"I have the same problem as alkkfkfkfkkf .
I was able to play the game (but I used an virtual IDE) yesterday. But today Iv'e got a message that tells me I should insert the correct disc even if I do exactly as I did yesterday to get it work :-|"

,Magicballs,2007-11-03T19:30Z,mbeck111 i have followed the instructions exactly but still i get the same problem which is when i try to mount the file the pc sort of freezes( the mouse can still move but everything else is static) so i have to pull the plug. Can you help me with this please?
,dropyourpants,2007-11-03T19:40Z,"fixes the freezing problem..

Install SPTD 1.51 beta after installing DTPRO as according to changelog they have something done regarding this problem.

"" (Fixed issues with Intel RAID controllers)"""
,mbeck111,2007-11-03T19:55Z,"Magic,

Sorry it didn't work for you, I have no idea what is causing it.

I've with success tested this on 3 pc's with different hardware different OS'. I'd suggest you try dropyourpants advice and get the STPD 1.51 beta, but fyi, I don't have it installed, and don't have problems at all.

Please let me/us know if it works for you."
,dropyourpants,2007-11-03T20:10Z,"problem is only with RAID controllers.

You dont have them mbeck111, so of course you no have problem.

,UrHighness,2007-11-04T10:13Z,"I have read all the comments on all the uploads of this game now. None solve the problem I have.

When I try to start the game i get a different error message: ""(APILOADER) - Entrypoing 'GetProcessId' in 'Kernel32.dll' not found!

I have no problem with Daemon tools, och getting the image mounted in the IDE drive like most people. I have seen only 2 posts where other people have the same problem as me, but no sollution. Perhaps because it's a bit more rare problem? If anyone has a sollution for this please post it.

And don't repost these normal ""do like this 1,2,3 - guides"". I have followed them all to the point, several times. I'm beginning to think there may be som hardware issues.

Any clue anyone?"
,UrHighness,2007-11-04T13:55Z,"Nevermind. I found the solution. Just install service pack 2 if you get the error message ""(APILOADER) - Entrypoing 'GetProcessId' in 'Kernel32.dll' not found!""

Worked for me."
,pellepoliti,2007-11-04T14:01Z,I dont get the deamon tools to work on my vista. is there a crack to this game?
,WcLasT,2007-11-04T17:42Z,"Ok, so i finaly got this peace of shit to work. 

It's not so hard when u know how to do. 

First of all. Download Daemon Tools Pro Advanced Edition 4.1  

It will not work with the regular Daemon tools. 


Ok, so when you have done that, just mount it in daemon tools and it will install =)


Then you need a crack to the game. Download the crack at  www.gamecopyworld.com 

it's called  multi5-no-cd crack. or something. 

Mount the crack in  IDE-mode.   its the 6th button from the left in daemon tools pro.  It says  IDE Image.   

When u have done that, click on the game ikon and it will work.  


Hope u get what i said, i know it sounds a little much, but when u finaly understand this shitty construktion, it will work. 

Have fun!"
,pellepoliti,2007-11-04T18:02Z,ty. but when I open deamontools pro I get this message: Unable to add adapter. Insufficient privileges. anyone have a clu:)

,Exzyle,2008-02-20T23:08Z,"Hey

I made a stupid mistake.
I only extracted the .mdf file and deleted the .rar files before I realised never did the .mds.
So in lieu of having to re-dl the file, would someone be so kind as to e-mail me the .mds file at fallen-yamakasi@hotmail.com?
I'd appreciate it."
,Arash.au,2008-04-19T11:28Z,"This game works and it is sweet!

You don't need Russian Cracks or what have you to get it to work.

All you need is Daemon Tools Pro 4.10.0218.0 or later. The difference is subtle but important. 0214 for instance doesn't have the option for creating a virtual IDE Drive. So it has to be 0218 or higher. 

Here's a link: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4142259/DAEMON_Tools_Pro_ADVANCED_v4.10.Build218.0_REPACK

Uninstall previous version of Daemon tools (make sure you reset), install this and create a virtual IDE Driver. It's the 6th button from the left on the toolbar. 

I installed using the normal Daemon Tools and then switched to the proper virsion and created a Virtual IDE drive, mounted the very image I installed from and then started the game and it worked. 

But installing off the virtual ide driver and running the game straight away woll probably work too. I'm a noob and I'm not sure what the difference is. But if I can get it working then so can you.

Good luck!"

,Rumour,2008-08-01T00:32Z,"GOOD NEWS PEOPLE!!

THERE IS NO NEED TO INSTALL DAEMONS TOOLS TO PLAY THE WITCHER TO GET AROUND THE TAGES PROTECTION SYSTEM.

The story goes like this I've played about a quarter of the way through The Witcher on an older computer using Daemon Tools Advanced and decided it was time to get a more powerful games system. 

The problem was my new computer (probably the OEM installed drivers) refuses to play with the latest DTA. My system hangs when it is installed (the STPD problem) and I can't even get to the desktop unless I uninstall DTA in safemode.

Woe me ...woe me I will never get to finish the Witcher. Damn, and it was good too. I tried everything to try and get DTA to work but to no avail (and I know my situation is not unique- just google Daemon tools+system hangs, among other problems). Soon the Witcher was becoming a distant memory...a happy memory.

That was until I updated my copy of UltraISO to ""UltraISO Premium Edition version 9.3.0.2600"". I know for a fact that my older 9.1 version could not play it in its one virtual drive (I think it was more designed for playing DVD.iso's than getting around games protections).

I was able to install The Witcher to my hard drive (load the .iso into the virtual drive and press the magnifying glass symbol by the side to autoplay The Witcher.iso). I then updated it to v1.2 patch and replaced the witcher.exe with a no-cd crack.  

I have no idea why it was able to work as UltraISO is not a dedicated games .iso emulator like DTA. BUT IT WORKS...DAMN IT...IT WORKS.

No more DTA for me. In contrast UltraISO is non-invasive on your system and I've had no incompatibility problems or issues with it at all.

NOTE: I'm not sure if Witcher.mdf format works with this program so play it safe and use a rip that is a Witcher.iso. I downloaded this copy of UltraISO with a serial no. You can get it anywhere on the web: most torrents. 

I won't divulge the exact site simply because there are some silly fuckers out there who think it's a great idea to start forum threads with good sites names posted all over it. Over exposing good non-torrent sites and getting them shut down in the process. 

Hail me for I am the new King...long live the KING...long live the King!.

BTW I got my version of The Witcher from 

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4236683/The_Witcher_iso__1.2_patch_censorship_patch(optional)_no-cd_crac
(just for reference)

I will spam the other Witcher torrents here to spread the good news."
