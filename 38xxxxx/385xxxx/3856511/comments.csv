,conservburken,2007-10-25T14:47Z,Why is CD1 & CD2 put into only one mp3 file?
,shrewsbury,2007-10-29T21:04Z,"You need to open the .cue files that come with the torrent with a program like Cue Splitter and it'll rip the mp3s into proper sized small ones. Without the .cue files, those two large mp3 files don't even do anything. 

BTW. Cue Splitter is free, you can download it just do a search off google."
,sy_lennox,2007-10-30T10:38Z,"too much hassle, lol"
,Lococard,2007-11-01T01:12Z,"Works perfect for me.

I used Cue splitter and it split them nicely into separate mp3s.


Thanks."

,the_jibble,2007-11-06T13:48Z,"your all nOObs

,Jouloupouki,2007-11-07T10:13Z,"Voi Paska, This is a Shit file it dont open with nothicg who idiot upload so shit file. just upload a normal mp3."
,lespen,2007-11-08T22:42Z,"If you really want them in single tracks, you should pay attention to what I'm saying now:
When you unpack the files, there's a .cue file, open that .cue file in ""Cue-splitter"" it's a program that you can get here: http://www.shareup.com/CUE_Splitter-download-30218.html
Then just make ""Cue-splitter"" split the tracks, and you will have both Hardbass Chapter 10 CDs, but in single songs.
Hope this was helpfull, so we don't have to hear more silly questions about why the CD is one big mix :)"
,smokeypeacock,2007-11-13T11:05Z,"Can i suggest to everyone that when ripping mix cd's you use Exact Audio Copy.  This is free software and by far the most precise at ripping cd's.  I will create a cue file for you or m3u files.  This then allows for multi or mixed tracks.  Food for thought for everyone.

Cheers "
