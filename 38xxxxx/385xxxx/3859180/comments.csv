,oblachubs,2007-12-11T05:28Z,Thanks for continuing to seed this.  I was also wondering how to convert a DVD to a .DPG format.  I can seem to do it for some AVI's but not sure about a DVD.  I assume it needs to be converted to an AVI somehow first and then to DPG.  Anyone?

it works fine for many other people. newer versions of moonshell wont work because it was wncoded with the older version of dpg convertor.
of coarse it isn't by AXXO you moron... it says right in the nfo that i converted axxo's release into this...axxo doesn't do NDS releases..."
