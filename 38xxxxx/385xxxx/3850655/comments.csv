I downloaded it,
I changed .img to .iso,

I mounted it.

Now it shows as a WinRar file.
And Daemon tools won't mount it.

What should I do?"
,vickei,2007-11-19T04:22Z,"@b-1-66-er
There was no need to change the file type! You can break files doing that! There is no need to unpack image files either.

I am pretty sure I have mounted an .img image in Daemon Tools before, just make sure you have it set to ""all files"" in the browse window."

,MatthiasForVendetta,2010-06-06T04:29Z,"Fallout 3 was great fun and all, but storyline is a big must for me. Still, the feel of 3 was astounding and I really hope there's enough of the gaming feel in New Vegas with more of the story of the older two."

,IsackMedici,2010-08-22T23:30Z,"JMRboricua, are you some kind of idiot?

Never played RPG?

RPG like D&D and Vampire is turn-based, everyone have to act in his own turn or else it wold be a real mess since RPG is meant to be played in group.

Ever thought of everyone rolling dices at the same time? I don't think so, since you are a damn fucking racist and an idiot."

,Gamejunkiez,2010-09-16T16:49Z,"- Mount and install to any location.

- Open the install dir and delete the ereg files.
(So it will not bug you each time you start)

- Crash explorer.exe using the task manager.
- File --> New task ---> and enter path to your game.
(Example: E:\Games\Fallout2\fallout2.exe)

Now the game will launch without mixed up colors and without ereg crap.

Enjoy. :)"

,CannabisKing,2011-07-11T01:45Z,"Game works and all, but bits of the cut scenes are screwed up,  like all thermal and shit. Seems many people are experiencing this judging by the comments so I'd recommend dling a different torrent for those who haven't dled this yet."
,CannabisKing,2011-07-15T14:04Z,"Although then after playing a good bit of it the actual gameplay does function 100% perfectly, so it's a pretty good torrent after all. The whole thermal bits in the first cut scenes are still annoying though."
,ismellfunny67,2011-10-12T11:07Z,"@beatlefan78

It almost seems like your anti-virus might be deleting cracked files or detecting the .exe as a virus. Just an idea, try running the .exe without any kind of anti-virus auto-detect running. Might fix it."

Any help?"
