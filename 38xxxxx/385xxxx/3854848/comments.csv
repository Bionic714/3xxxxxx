(I think that was the web address you ask people to go to in the text file accompanying the .rar file) then why not make sure that that web page will actually load on a  browser. Seems to be a fake. Why password such a file? What is the point? If someone gets a password can you post it in a comment here..... though I am doing another download of this from another source."

[M],Q91,2007-10-23T21:57Z,you guys do know that TiAMO is one of the those who actually runs the site?

,lan-di,2007-10-24T00:23Z,are you insane guys??? the .rar files are not password protected. never tiamo's uploads are pass protected. the only reason the episode is uploaded in parts is to be seeded faster. for your own onvinience. stop complaining.
,moviewatcher10,2007-10-24T06:56Z,"If this has been uploaded by someone who runs this site then he has a right to do whatever he wants.Of course ! But I don't think this is the case. I downloaded this life and it was password protected.When I went to the website indicated on the text file in the downloaded folder I couldn't access the site or get the password. So, I really can't see how this could be a genuine upload.It is as simple as that."
