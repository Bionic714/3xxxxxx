"Black Rose: A Rock Legend" by Thin Lizzy, 1978 Polygram.

Please Note:  I am not an audiophile, so if for some reason you find 
a serious problem with this vinyl-to-digital tranfer, please do not
murder me.  It is presented in a high-quality compressed format.

No noise-filtering of any kind has been done, so you get the sweet
sound of a vinyl LP in a convenient digital format 
(analog->digital=Digilog?).  Some EQing has been done in order to 
improve the overall sound quality.

Also, when burning these files to Compact Disc, remember to leave no
pauses between tracks, or else the "flow" will be interupted, which will 
mess up your whole day, and possibly taint your mojo.  A program such as
Nero Burning ROM is recommended.

You have been warned, Mwahahahahahaha!!!
