Respect!"
,fael097,2008-02-09T16:05Z,"ok

,Kanelstrejf,2008-05-26T23:40Z,is this something you can toy around with like a sand box? or just some software for development or something
,GreenDixy,2008-09-09T20:50Z,more seeders pls will seed once i get it on a 16mbit line up and down
,xiIix,2008-09-19T19:17Z,I'm interested if this is a sandbox-type of software as well.
,Venom_Exe,2009-03-30T23:43Z,"If its true (i havent tried it), this is the Unigine Ver. 0.33 which is an old version of the game engine (needless to say, the engine is definitely neither opensource nor free)

From what i gather, the engine seems to be quite good, but u better get Ogre3D if you want to just sneak a peek"
