Bonfire of the Manatees (#GABF18 / SI-1618) 11 Sep 2005 
 When Homer falls for a football betting scam and owes money to Fat Tony, Fat Tony decides to let Homer pay off the debt by letting him shoot a porno film in the house. When Marge finds out, she drives off, and while she is calling Homer, the phone booth she is in is attacked by a manatee, which is driven off by a marine biologist specializing in them (right down to his "I Love Manateess" tattoo). Marge becomes fascinated by the manatees, which doesn't escape Homer's notice, so when a pack of them are attacked by jet-skiiers, it's up to Homer to save the day, the manatees, and then himself.  

   
The Girl Who Slept Too Little (#GABF16 / SI-1616) (18 Sep 05) 
 When a new stamp museum is going to be opened behind the Simpson house, the Simpsons protest its construction to the point where it is moved to the site of the Springfield Cemetary, and the cemetary is moved to behind the Simpson house. Lisa is afraid of the things she sees, and Homer and Marge are afraid that if Lisa keeps sleeping with them, they'll go crazy, but while Homer and Marge ask a psychologist for help, Lisa has her own solution: if she can make it until midnight without calling the Corey hotline - wait, wrong episode - if she can spend the night in the cemetary, she can overcome her fear.  
 Note: Fox originally announced that this episode would air as the season finale on 15 May 2005; however, when The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star was pulled from its original 10 April 2005 air date, it replaced this episode in the schedule.  

   
Milhouse of Sand and Fog (#GABF19 / SI-1619) 25 Sep 05 
 When Maggie comes down with the chicken pox, Homer actually takes some advice from Flanders and holds a "pox party" so his friends could have their kids infected. After one too many Marge-aritas, Kirk and Luanne van Houten decide to get back together. However, Milhouse realizes they're too interested in each other and not interested in him, so he tries to breaks them up by planting a bra in his parents' bedroom. One problem: Luanne discovers it's Marge's bra, which leads to Homer and Marge breaking up yet again...

Marge's Son Poisoning (#GABF20 / SI-1620) 13 Nov 2005 
 Marge buys a tandem bicycle because she thinks Homer will ride with her, but when she ends up trying to ride it on her own (and failing miserably), Bart decides to ride with her.

When everybody blames Mayor Quimby, the town calls for a recall election, and Homer decides to run for mayor, along with pretty much everybody else in town (just like the time 135 people ran for Governor of California when Gray Davis was being recalled in 2003).  

   
The Last of the Red Hat Mamas (#GABF22 / SI-1622) 27 Nov 2005 
 Homer gets into a fight with an Easter bunny (after stealing other kids' Easter eggs when they grab them right in front of Maggie). resulting in Marge being shunned by her friends, so she ends up joining the Cheery Red Tomatoes, an organization of older women whose interests include talking about their husbands, skydiving...and stealing Faberge eggs from Mr. Burns (who decided to renege on a million-dollar charitable donation); Lisa needs to be able to speak Italian in order to qualify for a summer program in Rome, so she hires one from a telpehone poll flyer - Milhouse, who spends two weeks in Tuscany every summer.  

   
The Italian Bob (#HABF02 / SI-1702) 11 Dec 2005 
 Mr. Burns's Stutz Bearcat finally breaks down, so he decides to buy a new Italian sports car, and have somebody pick it up for him - all together now: "The Simpsons are going to Italy!", only to end up in a small town where the residents aren't aware of the criminal past of their new mayor - Sideshow Bob, who is married and has a son, and gives the Simpsons the run of the town, and asks only that they keep his past from the townspeople...but when he forgets that wine and Simpsons (especially an eight-year-old one) don't mix very well, Marge quickly finds out what "vendetta" means in English.  

   
Simpsons Christmas Stories (#HABF01 / SI-1701) 18 Dec 2005 
 It's D'oh-Ho-Homer with these three Christmas stories: 

"The First D'oh-El" (no, I'm not going to call it "The First (ANNOYED GRUNT)-El") - when Reverend Lovejoy can't make it to church to deliver the Christmas sermon because of a train wreck (a model train wreck, that is), he asks Ned to deliver it, but when Ned gets a paper cut, it becomes The Gospel According to Homer, with Marge as Mary and Bart as Jebus Jesus 
"I Saw Grampa Cussing Santa Claus" - in a World War II flashback, Grampa and Mr. Burns end up stuck on a deserted island where Burns shoots down Santa Claus

My Fair Laddy (#HABF05 / SI-1705) 26 Feb 2006 
 On the advice of our lawyer's, we have never heard of an episode that has both a plot and songs like My Fair Lady, where Lisa tries to turn Groundskeeper Willie into a refined gentleman after Bart accidentally destroys his shack with an ice-filled ball; Homer discovers that the company that makes his favorite blue pants has stopped making them

Well, when Ned wins a computer in a rubber duck race at a church bazaar, he decides he doesn't want it, so he gives it to the Simpsons, and in exchange Marge agrees to watch Rod and Todd while Ned attends a left-handers' expo. With Marge in charge, the boys have the time of their lives, and want to see more of Marge, so Homer is left to watch Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, which leads to a trip to a museum for old show business animals, including one who misses her children, who are still in show business.  

   
Homer Simpson, This is Your Wife (#HABF08 / SI-1708) 26 Mar 2006 
 Homer sees Lenny's new plasma TV and wants one of his own, so he enters a contest in an attempt to win one, but instead wins a trip to Fox Studios, where he gets involved in a show similar to Trading Spouses: Meet Your New Mommy and ends up trading Marge for the no-nonsense wife of another man (voiced by Ricky Gervais of the BBC version of The Office, who also wrote this episode); while Homer's "wife" runs the house with an iron fist, Marge's new "husband", unaccustomed to a woman who is nice to him, falls in love with Marge.

The Wettest Stories Ever Told (#HABF11 / SI-1711) 23 Apr 2006 
 When dinner at the Frying Dutchman takes a little longer than expected to cook, thanks to an uncooperative octopus armed with knives, and the Sea Captain doesn't know any sea tales, the Simpsons take up the slack by telling stories of three famous ships; Lisa with the Mayflower, Bart with the Bounty, and Homer with a ship that sounds an awful lot like the Posiedon (and is even named for a god of the sea, albeit the Roman one)  

   
Girls Just Want to Have Sums (#HABF12 / SI-1712)  30 Apr 2006 
 When Principal Skinner makes a comment at "Stab-A-Lot" (the Itchy & Scratchy musical) that girls aren't as good as math as boys, he is replaced by a new principal who separates the school into boys' and girls' schools.

Regarding Margie (#HABF13 / SI-1713)  7 May 2006 
 When Marge bumps her head on a stool by her maximum-strength cleaning solution she uses to clear the house before her free housecleaning (which "she" won thanks to Homer painting the address number on the curb in front of the house), she gets amnesia, but quickly remembers everything except for two things - one, that she's married to Homer, and two, who Homer is.  

   
The Monkey Suit (#HABF14 / SI-1714)  14 May 2006

Does Marge have something up where her sleeves would be if she didn't always wear a sleeveless dress to help Lisa?

 The Springfield Isotopes's star first baseman is having marital problems, so when he sees Homer and Marge kissing on the Jumbotron, he asks them for advice, but when Homer is later caught giving a neck massage to the player's wife, they break up again - and it's hard for them to give advice when they're not talking to each other themselves
