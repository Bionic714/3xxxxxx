As you [has could] seen in the link above;

I've create this torrent 'cause of the original server for this long-awaited demo were dropped out 'cause of traffic.

I was one of the first who loaded this programm BEFORE the server got lost.

So, someone got asks early loaders to create a torrent to share these demo for all who couldn't get this stuff.


So, if you don't understand the circumstances get on your own problems !"
