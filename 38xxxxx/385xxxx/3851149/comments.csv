thx a lot!"
,kwcatron,2008-03-02T23:09Z,"Kinda works.

you will have troubles if you try to use w/ vista :

To get Disc 1 setup to work on vista you gotta right click setup.exe and run as admnistrator. That should get that one to work. Disc 2 is just optional install stuff.
I couldnt get J++ (disc 3) to install. I tried the run as administrator trick for that one but it didnt work.
So you basically get everything except j++

If your running Xp or lower then ignore the above, everything should work fine."

,suckbox554,2010-11-05T05:05Z,"Visual Studio 6.0 is the standard for MFC Win32 GUI programming as current as 1998. If you are trying to use the 99 C++ standard you need atleast the .Net 1 C++. For the latest bugfixes and releases, Visual Studio 2010, PRO/ULTIMATE/STUDENT, etc, are all fine.

This is probably going to be used mostly by beginners who are intimidated by the .net framework. But really, there is no need to be. It is something you will have to learn anyways!

There is so much more to do in .net definetly try it out. This is great upload thanks you uploader"

[V],FalconFour,2011-03-13T15:09Z,"Going to be using this to get my way into desktop programming... apparently it's the IDE used to build uTorrent (in C++), so it's OK in my book. .NET is anything but cross-platform, I hate how many convoluted, bloated DLLs and registry settings it relies on, and how easily it breaks. For me to build an app that runs in MiniXP on my Boot CD, it'd better be clean and sleek. Plus, I don't need a huge .NET environment sprawled out on my laptop when I may only use it once or twice..."
[V],FalconFour,2011-03-13T16:01Z,"Need this guide to install on any modern OS (installed on Win7 SP1 x64 here): http://www.ponticstar.com/blog/2009/07/13/how-to-install-msvs-on-windows/

Haven't tried opening it yet, but managed to get it to install after editing KEY.DAT from \Software to \Wow6432Node\Software. Any worthy of installing this software should know what that means to do ;)"
,efeffess,2011-07-04T02:46Z,"This is an amazing torrent for an old schooler like me. MinGW/MSys was being problematic with my OpenGL code, but VC6 eats it up like it's candy. (Mmmmmm, chocolate.)

While installing under XP, however, an error message appeared stating: ""javasign.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry."" If this happens, don't uninstall anything, and follow the instructions in this article:

http://www.dmcinfo.com/blog.aspx/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/102/Installing-Visual-Studio-60-on-Windows-XP-or-Vista.aspx

Then begin the installation again.

(My condolences to those who have been mocked so oppressively and insulted to thoroughly by the mere presence of Windows Vista, by the way.)

Also, if you're looking for the MSDN Library supplement, you can download it from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5679846/ and skip the Visual Studio discs."
,jtwg,2011-07-13T17:44Z,many thanks. this should be on msdnaa but its not :'(
