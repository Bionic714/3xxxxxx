Here, Shen Yi (The Angel Strikes Again), Essie Lin Chia (Return Of The One-Armed Swordsman), and Pan Ying-tzu (The Eight Dragon Sword) are the swordswomen three -- taking on Shaw?s first international superstar, Lo Lieh (King Boxer) for possession of the powerful Han Family Sword. That makes this a four-star treat for action fans.
