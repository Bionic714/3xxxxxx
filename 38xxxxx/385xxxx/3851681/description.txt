Evan Almighty [2007]
Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) is a Buffalo newscaster who was just elected to Congress. His slogan was to "Change the World". He moves his family to Virginia to start his new life. What Evan doesn't know is that his world was about to change. Evan prays for guidance in his new house and the next morning he begins to encounter strange things. First his alarm clock goes off at GEN 6:14, and then he finds a house warming gift, a box filled with old tools, at his front door. The next weird thing is a truck load of wood is delivered to Evan's house. Finally, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan, and commands him to build an ARK just as Noah did before him, and fill it with animals to protect them against the coming flood. Evan believes he is under a lot of stress and that is causing him to go a little crazy. So it takes a little persuasion from God to get Evan to build an ARK. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
