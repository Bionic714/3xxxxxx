This is a series of messages from my local church (Christ Community in Cleveland, Tn). I really enjoy the practicality of the messages, and the way they approach religion rationally, so I thought I would share these messages with you. Enjoy.

Technical info:
These files are highly compressed so that any one message may be sent in an email attachment (10MB or less) They use the free speex codec for speech, and vorbis for music in one case. In the message containing music, there is a section in speex before and the music in vorbis, all chained in an ogg container.
To play these files I suggest using VLC http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
