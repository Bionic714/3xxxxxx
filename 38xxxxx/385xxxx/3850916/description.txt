Gianni Visnadi, Paolo Visnadi, Janice Robinson, Doris Diggs



Profile:


Livin' Joy was an Italian House project of Gianni Visnadi and Paolo Visnadi. Their first single "Dreamer" featured the voice of vocalist Janice Robinson. Released in 1994, the record became a hit the following year. Unable to reach a deal with Janice Robinson for the follow up single (and subsequent album), she was replaced by Doris Diggs AKA Tameka Starr. Using the tested formula of "Dreamer", "Don't Stop Movin'" did well, but was the last big club hit for Livin' Joy.
