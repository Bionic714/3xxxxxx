,Tech-Noir,2007-10-23T12:13Z,"I get CRC errors in the .mdf file when trying to extract with WinRAR, but it might just be me. Others will have to confirm otherwise the problem is at my end. :)"
,Tech-Noir,2007-10-23T12:25Z,"OK, I just forced a re-check in uTorrent but everything seems to be fine. No errors reported. WOuld anyone care to enlighten me as to why the torrent data seems to be intact, yet I cannot extract due to CRC errors? Is it WinRAR at fault perhaps?

Or am I missing a rare (or just not enountered by me before) problem?

The FLT release I downloaded simultaneously unzipped fine with WinRAR though."
,luziito,2007-10-24T01:00Z,"so what do you say, something is wrong?"
,Tech-Noir,2007-10-24T01:05Z,"I am not saying something is wrong with the torrent, but I got errors trying to unzip when uTorrent told me the downloaded file was as it was supposed to be.

That's all I can say, others will have to confirm or deny that the file is OK or not. If someone out there has managed to unrar it ok, then the file is probably ok, and the problem lies somewhere else. :)"
,chinow,2007-10-24T14:33Z,File is corrupt
,Tech-Noir,2007-10-24T15:41Z,"I guess it wasn't just me then... :)

Glad I don't have any RAM issues I didn't know of, always a plus. :)"
