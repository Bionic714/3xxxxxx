[T],Olafsos,2008-01-17T16:08Z,"Hy guys I have solved the problem with number 2 and 3, in both torrents (also the one with the rapidshare link) are french charachters (letters) which do not work without the french windows or language pack. So you have to remove these charachters from the registery and the Map directories of mapset 2 and 3, so that there the same.

I can select them, but see only empty maps on the screen. The directories on the PC (C:\Garmin\France Topo...) are normally filled with img-files. Anyone any idea what's wrong?"

sorry I made a confusion on the originator of the latest versions of the maps... Often absent minded ;-)
Can you help with my problem with region5 (Paris) map 722? Only found a .img (+.ccd and .sub) that wouldn't unlock...
Thanks for these very useful maps ...and trick !"
,Dusha,2008-04-06T16:13Z,"martinette 
ccd+img = ClonedCD image, not mapsource 

Use either Clonecd to burn the CD, or use a DaemonTools (www.daemon-tools.cc) to mount this image and install."
,walioli,2008-05-30T19:27Z,"I've dowloaded the maps since 3 month.  But forgot to dowload the keygen.

Doens't work anymore.
DO you have another way to find this link or is it possible to send it to me by email ? Thks"
,zflag,2008-06-03T04:28Z,"Just want to summarize a few things:
If you choose to download the locked maps (latest versions), here is what you should do if you are simply using Mapsource on a handheld GPS:
For instance, map 719, regedit, change the directory: 
1 -HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Garmin\MapSource\Families\FAMILY_719
C:\Garmin\FAMILY_719product.mdx -> change to C:\Garmin\FAMILY_719\product.mdx
2- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Garmin\MapSource\Families\FAMILY_719
C:\Garmin\FAMILY_719MDRMAP.IMG -> change to C:\Garmin\FAMILY_719\MDRMAP.IMG
3- Download GarminKeygen 1.3 or better 1.5 (look on the web, there are plenty of torrents for this)
4- Open GarminKeygen, Enter your unit ID, then go to Select Map product, select Custom Mapset, and enter 719.
Under Mapunlock code, hit Generate.  
5- Open Mapsource, cut and paste this code into it, and your map will be unlocked.  This will do the job if you have a GPS like mine, the GPSMAP60CSX."
,zflag,2008-06-03T04:32Z,"Completing the above, it assumes you have downloaded Daemon, which allows you to open the .ISO format file as if you had it on a CD.  Opening the file wil Daemon will lauch the installation of the map on your computer.  Then you can follow the steps that I have written above."
,walioli,2008-06-03T16:31Z,"@ zflag

Thanks for procedure to install map.  Install successful on my vista Hcx.
In the mean time i found the keygen V1.3... without virus.
Indeed there are plenty of torrent for this, but pay attention to virus !"
,mikado60,2008-10-24T15:28Z,"Hi, sorry I have some problems with the procedure.
I want to use these maps within MapSource on my pc and on my etrex vistaCX handheld. After downloading and installing, new FAMILY directories were created. MapSource asks for a code. Codes created with keygen 1.3 or 1.5 don't help. If you try it 5 times keygen will create 5 different codes! - Is keygen to be used when using a etrex? I created GMAPSUPP.UNL in the shown and put it in the same FAMILY-directory. Restart MapSource, but same effect.
Legal installed Topo Germany, Topo Swiss and Topo Austria work fine. They all don't have a GMAPSUPP.UNL in no directory!!! - Something is going wrong with installing the Topo France. When trying to put a code in MapSource thes program sends ERROR and wants to send a error mail to Garmin...
Trying to read the registry but couldn't find any important notice there...
Who can help?"

i want to have topo france, what do i have to do?"
,sprockett2103,2009-02-06T12:45Z,"maps installing ok, but not showing in mapsource... any ideas please"
,zflag,2009-03-28T03:25Z,"sprockett:
I assumed you followed the procedure that I wrote to install the map.   The maps are locked, you have to get the keygenerator as written above.   At the bottom sectiono of jetmouse keygen, you have to enter each mapID with your Garmin unique ID, then hit generate.  You will have to paste that code under Mapsource Utilities menu to unlock the maps.   You can get your Unit ID directly from the unit, or from Mapsource Utilities menu.  Hope this helps!"
,zflag,2009-03-28T03:33Z,"Mikado:  I suspect you don't have the proper keygen.  Look for Jetmouse Keygen Garmin 1.5, be carefull for viruses.  At the bottom section of the keygen application, you enter the map ID and unit ID, and hit 'generate'.   That 25 digit code is to be pasted into mapsource Utilities menu (unlock map).  I suspect the keygen you have is a fake and actually messes up with the registry more than anything.  Garmin is probably flooding the web with  keygens to prevent us from hacking the maps!!"
,djhog,2011-05-30T23:32Z,"i know it's been a while since this is on, maybe there is a new version downloadable? if not, i downloaded this one, but when checking the register, i found the family map, but the files weren't in there, also I noticed mapsource has a runtime-error when installed? can anybody help me?"
