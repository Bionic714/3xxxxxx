A bit small, I'll let you know if I find a better one."
,BoLasse,2007-10-24T22:51Z,"When I play this at my computer it doesn't autostart , if it doesn't, go into the VIDEO_TS folder and start VTS_01_0.IFO (with e.g. Windows Media Player).
In an ordinary DVD player it should start without  problem.

And, forgot to mension, the little synchronization error at the end of Creeping Death isn't my fault :)"

,floydfreak,2011-06-01T18:38Z,"THIS is considered ""good quality""?? Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. Audio isn't so bad but the video is grainier than a Kansas silo. So much for truth in advertising. No track selection either."
,DamageIncM,2011-07-17T12:25Z,"@floydfreak

I didn't see this yet, but what do you mean by grainy?
Do you mean film-noise or do you mean compression artifacts?

This recording COULD be quite grainy.
I have watched parts of it before and it does seem to have a good grain in it, but I'm not exactly sure.
Grain is good, it's part of film, artifacts (blocks and other noise) are bad, it's part of modern digital compression.

I really hope they have this on actual film and not SD-tapes or something, cause this should come out on BD."
