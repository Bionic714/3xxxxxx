This is Metallica's legendary Monsters of Rock concert, in Tushino Airfield, Moscow 1991.
According to some sources number of people out there exceeded 500,000.

I haven't found any high quality recording of this amazing gig, so I've taken the best video and the best audio I could find and put them together. The video quality is very good I think, and the audio is mostly very good as well, quite shifting though.

If anyone know where I can get better version, please let me know :) And keep seeding, folks.
