Release Notes 
Rise to the occasion, it's a renegade
invasion! Go from zero to hero, toe-tapper to
dancefloor-freaker in 3 simple steps: Insert
CD, press play, turn it up.
This is going to have adrenalin marching
through your brain - like gnomes in
radioactive rubber pants on the rampage. Each
gnome doing lines, on the back of a dodo,
with signs saying 'Let's Party Mofo'.
Bred and tested and tried on virtually every
dance floor in Cape Town this summer, we've
eliminated the guesswork on this one. So let
go, lock on, batten down the hatches and rock
on
High voltage kicks off the album with some
'Tasty Licks' which whiplashes round into
Broken Toy's 'Nijhong Beats' and right up its
ass is Clock Monkey with a wacky 'Wabawanga'.
'Who's got the bag' keeps it rolling then EMP
vs Clock Monkey spank it with 'Initial
Slave'. Alice.D's debut release 'I was dead'
infiltrates and decimates followed by EMP's
'Break sum more' which will be played for
years to come. Then AliceD's back with The
Organization and the steam train keeps
rolling right through EMP's 'The Dawn' and
just to polish off the end, On with 'The
Quantum Effect'.
