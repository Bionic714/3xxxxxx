[REViEW]                                
Celebrating the 10th birthday of the groundbreaking    
Israeli Psytrance label HomMega Records this issues      
covermount CD Astrix & Friends presents the range of    
their roster mixed by Astrix.                                
We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying.
MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands !!
You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout.
