As the description says: the DTS version of The Alan Parsons Project album Stereotomy.

Burn the .iso as a normal audio cd. Audio is 5.1 surround. Be careful not to turn your subwoofer up too loud, if you have one. Subwoofer levels are higher than common with this disc! But the disc plays equally well or better without the subwoofer, I find.

With DTS discs, you will need a dts decoder to play it, for example built-in  in your reciever or in your dvd player. Be sure to use a digital output from the player to the reciever if you use the amplifier's decoder, or else all you will hear is awful noise.

Covers are included as bitmaps for best effect (they were difficult to scan in my poor scanner to good results), but no glasses come with the torrent!
