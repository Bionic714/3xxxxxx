,JimmyRcom,2007-10-24T00:39Z,"one requirement for version 3 is an internet connection. If it says it's already been activated that's not a good thing, that means they saw you're using a pirated redistribution. It probably won't let you use its features until you activate, that's why you're all reporting it won't open old isos, ""even though it has already been activated""."

CD1 is not working. You can open CD ( but you will not be able to add language Level1 (CD1) It could be a problem with file SK-ESP-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.7.1.0.r29 in Language folder. I couldn't open it.

Plus all CDs needs to be activated.(activation is not removed yet. You are able to use only 2 lessons out of CD and then it forces you to activate the program.

Anyone can bit that?"

,LindB377,2008-04-13T23:42Z,"OK, I bet this guy has a good upload and everything, but I found somebody else who is dealing with Rosetta Stone and their's is CLEAN and works great!

Follow these instructions if you want to get a clean download of Rosetta Stone and getting by the activation process.

Step by step instructions: (Do them in exactly this order.

1. Download the version 3 application from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3852202/The_Rosetta_Stone_Application_(Version_3) and install it.

2. Download the version 3 update from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095208/Rosetta.Stone.3.0.57.UPDATE and install it.

3. Download the version 3 patch from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095215/Rosetta.Stone.V3.Patch. Put patch.exe in the Rosetta Stone directory at C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone V3 and double click on it. If you are using Vista, right-click on it first and select run as admin.

4. Download the languge files you want from esarhaddon's page:http://thepiratebay.org/user/esarhaddon/0/1 and mount them with daemon (the easiest to use).

5. Run the Rosetta Stone application and click check for updates later, click on add languages, add the first language, unmount the first language disk and mount the other levels of that language or other languages you want to learn. Do add another language until you have all of them that you want.

6. Click on activate or whatever.

7. The patch will keep RS from going to the RS website and ask if you want to activate by phone. Click on show me how. Enter all Xes for each of the languages listed.

8. RS will show you some numbers to give the person you supposedly are calling. Instead of calling, enter all 1s as if the RS representative had given you them, Once again, do this for all the languages listed.

9. Click OK and RS will thank you for licensing.

10 Start learning. At least one unit per day creates the best retention rate!


This works for me!"

,Lemarchand,2008-04-19T12:09Z,"Many thanks Criten for this release!

I received various errors when trying to install this program, and found that a complete uninstall (including removing all folders and registry entries relating to the program) and then re-installing did the trick.  Might be worth trying if you're getting error codes and such.

LindB377's guide works great (thanks Lind!) but it didn't work for me until I performed the aforementioned clean install.  So, if you have a previous version of the app installed, or if you've attempted to install this particular version several times, just start from scratch and you should have more success.

I have one question, however.  Why does the program always check for updates when I start it, despite my clicking of the ""Do not check for updates again"" option each time?  Bloody annoying!

Cheers!"

Deleted the tracking.db3 in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Rosetta Stone\  (Windows XP).

Hope that helps.

I know the one included with the 360 version works.  I have to assume that the same mic is included with the PS2/PS3/Wii versions.  Following that to its logical conclusion, the microphone from any version of Karaoke Revolution should work.

,hachimitsu,2008-04-28T08:51Z,"Okay so here is what to do - 

UNINSTALL Rosetta Stone - 
Go to 
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data
Go to the TOOLS > FOLDER OPTIONS and within that choose the VIEW tab, choose to SHOW HIDDEN FILES AND FOLDERS
Find the Rosetta Stone Folder - delete it (after uninstalling) also delete the program files/rosetta stone/ rosetta stone v3 folder
THEN 
REINSTALL, when the install finishes let it open rosetta stone once, choose to be reminded later of an update, [NOW HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART - PUT THE PATCH IN BEFORE UPDATING ANYTHING SO THE LICENSEDLL.DLL file is still there]
go to where you patch is, move the patch to the program files/rosetta stone/rosetta stone v3 folder,
double click on the patch, let it do its thing,
... now here is where I am choosing to not install the 3.0.57 update because this is where things got ""wonky"" last time and caused me a whole headache of trouble... I may try to update via torrented update later...
... SO... I let it install the language, so far so good 
AND NOW I COME TO THE PART WHERE IT WOULDN'T LET ME PUT IN XXXX-XXXX... last time ( I am assuming there are more people in my situation out there... I hope this helps, at least in some way if it doesn't end up actually working it may give someone a clue on how to fix this)
[btw, I chose to mount everything using POWERISO, because I am NOT wasting CDs until I know all the stuff works and I can have backup CDs]
... so... the language installed, 
Huh, weird, it skipped to creating a USER instead of ""activating"" the language... I wonder what this means? Any thoughts?

put in all X's

then choose to get help by phone, put in all 1's

it should work!

-----------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
-----------------------------------

-Do NOT update to the 3.2.11 version. doing so will prevent you from using the patch and using the software. You dont need it.

-If you already did that:

1-Uninstall RS COMPLETELY (if you dont find it in Control Panel>Programs and Features, simply mount it using Daemon Tools and run setup again)

2-Download Windows Install Cleanup (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301) and run it. Look for any RS entries and remove them.

3-Go to Program files and remove the RS folder (make sure to copy the patch file to your desktop if you already placed it in the RS folder)

4- Restart your system and install RS from scratch following EXACTLY t0qt4u's instructions below.

5- Dont let this be a fling (this is directed to myself as well) You CAN learn the language. 

Good luck!"

,tazorama,2008-06-24T19:17Z,"joescuba007, In this version of RS, once the language is installed you no longer need the ISO file you downloaded. You can easily install the language by mounting the ISO file using Daemon tools and then running RS and clicking (add or remove language) Top right corner. If you want to keep the original language file in case of a format or something, I strongly recommend burning the ISO file. This way you can just pop the CD in and install the language by clicking Add or remove language. RS will search for it and find it."

I downloaded the torrent of the language... but how do I load them onto a disc.  I have NERO, MagicISO, and Daemon Tools, although I don't have alot of experience with the last 2.  So do I extract the ISO with Winrar which breaks them into a ton of files... and then burn those files to a disc, or just burn the ISO file to a disc?  If the latter can you give some guidance on how to ""mount""/burn the iso file to a disc."
,tazorama,2008-06-24T20:43Z,"---------------------
Clarification
---------------------
-The update in t0qt4u's step number 3 is a GOOD update that you need. it is update 3.0.57

-The BAD update is the one that RS prompts you to download if you check for update. That is why you should click Check for updates later and save yourself a ton of misery.
-------------------------------------

joescuba007, I honestly am not sure what you mean by ""load onto disk"" so here are some detailed steps on how to get the language to work so you can start learning. You need Daemon tools. do this after t0qt4u's step number 5 

5. Download the languages that you need.

5a- Run Daemon tools by double clicking its shortcut. A red square should appear on the bottom right corner of your screen (next to the clock)

5b- right click the red square, a list appears. point your mouse at the first choice: Virtual CD/DVD-Rom.

5c- Another list appears. Point your mouse at the first choice: Device 0: [F:] empty. (notice that the letter between the [] may not be F, its OK)

5d- Another list appears. Point your mouse at the first choice: Mount Image. click it.

5e- a window opens. Navigate inside it until you find the language ISO file that you downloaded. for example: 

Rosetta.Stone.V3.French.Level.1.iso

5f-Double click it. Now it is mounted. a window may appear with the files Data, Documentation, Languages, speech in it. just close it.

5g- Now run RS which I assume you have already installed. Top right corner there is a circle with 3 lines inside it (next to a question mark) click it. then click Add or Remove Languages>Add a language level>Continue>Install Selected Languages.

Once you are done, close RS, LEFT click the red square on the bottom right corner and click Unmount all drives. Now repeat The steps 5b to 5g but select the Spanish ISO instead.
-------------------------------------------------

If you have not installed RS the application:The Rosetta Stone Version 3 Application (Mac Win).iso, Mount it instead of the language ISO in step 5e and install it.

I hope this helps.

If this is not clear enough. I'll try to make a youtube video and post the link!"
,Spasik,2008-06-25T00:04Z,"OK I followed t0qt4u's instructions but even though I delete the tracking.db3 file, when I run the update, the tracking.db3 file comes back. Is there a way preventing it from coming back once you delete it? Or is it just my computer?"
,joescuba007,2008-06-25T22:45Z,"Thanks everything loaded great.  I was thinking i needed to burn the ISO files to disc before loading them... I got them all running and activated.  I do have 2 other small questions... when I read the activation instructions (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095215/Rosetta.Stone.V3.Patch) it says at the end to perform an online update and then rerun the patch.  DO I REALLY WANT TO DO THE ONLINE UPDATE??  I thought we were trying to avoid that.  @nd Question... Do you know where I can find the French files?
Great instructions btw... I thought you were being sarcastic about the Utube video offer... made me laugh... made your just a better man than me!! :D"
,alucard20xx,2008-06-26T23:35Z,"I was having a 9212 error all the time. I followed LindB's instruction on comment page #2. After that, I allowed Rosetta to update to 3.2.11. Works great. Make sure you delete the entire folders before fresh installing. Also, follow all directions to a T. No skipping around. My sound card supports the program fine, no need for USB microphone. 

--------------------------------------------------------
OK, I bet this guy has a good upload and everything, but I found somebody else who is dealing with Rosetta Stone and their's is CLEAN and works great!

Follow these instructions if you want to get a clean download of Rosetta Stone and getting by the activation process.

Step by step instructions: (Do them in exactly this order.

1. Download the version 3 application from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3852202/The_Rosetta_Stone_Application_(Version_3) and install it.

2. Download the version 3 update from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095208/Rosetta.Stone.3.0.57.UPDATE and install it.

3. Download the version 3 patch from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095215/Rosetta.Stone.V3.Patch. Put patch.exe in the Rosetta Stone directory at C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone V3 and double click on it. If you are using Vista, right-click on it first and select run as admin.

4. Download the languge files you want from esarhaddon's page:http://thepiratebay.org/user/esarhaddon/0/1 and mount them with daemon (the easiest to use).

5. Run the Rosetta Stone application and click check for updates later, click on add languages, add the first language, unmount the first language disk and mount the other levels of that language or other languages you want to learn. Do add another language until you have all of them that you want.

6. Click on activate or whatever.

7. The patch will keep RS from going to the RS website and ask if you want to activate by phone. Click on show me how. Enter all Xes for each of the languages listed.

8. RS will show you some numbers to give the person you supposedly are calling. Instead of calling, enter all 1s as if the RS representative had given you them, Once again, do this for all the languages listed.

9. Click OK and RS will thank you for licensing.

10 Start learning. At least one unit per day creates the best retention rate!


This works for me! "
,new_user,2008-06-27T23:54Z,"I followed the instructions (install application, 3.057 update, patch, then languages). For those who haven't done it yet, disable automatic updates in RS and do not accept any more updates because you will not be able to run the program if you update. 

For error 5118, I deleted tracking.db3 in the Application Data folder, and that worked.

For error 4112, I removed the language file that was affected (levels 2 & 3 were working after I installed them but not level 1) and then reinstalled it. I hope that helps someone.

Program works great, thanks!"

It's all the same problems everyone else is having except that everyone says to delete tracker.db3  I can't find this file anywhere on my computer, I'm viewing all hidden files.

Any ideas?"
,dexphan,2008-07-19T00:56Z,"Ok, got it fixed for windows vista.  

Start from scratch.  Install.

In windows vista your tracking.db3 is in C:\ProgramData\ my folder didn't show up in explorer even after i hit ""show all files"" so i just clicked start and typed in ""c:\programdata\"" and opened the folder that way.  

Delete the empty tracking.db3 file

Run Rosetta Stone before trying to update or patch.  It will create a new tracking.db3 file but it will have some info in it (mine was 88kb)

then you should have no problems running the update and then the patch.

at least that's what worked for me."

Enjoy!
PS I have created a Torrent that holds these download instructions as well as Rosetta Stone V3.0.35 and the two Updates, and the Patch. Maybe we can get that going.

,UKRich,2008-11-08T02:57Z,"I gave the warning once before and i will give it one last time. The MBlast worm IS IN THIS VOLUME! As for the guy who couldn't find it with AVG Free TRY AVG PRO!!! You people amaze me sometimes. You'll install anything EXCEPT the most important thing ....... a good Anti-Virus. Duh!! And no, I don't work for Rosetta, I have been a member of The Bay for over 2 years. If you want to download it then do so but sooner or later your files will become mysteriously corrupted, Word docs become unable to open, same with PDF. It is a slow and patient but VERY destructive worm. Personally, I tested with AVG PRO, Kaspersky 2009 and Avast PRO."
,ashnoob,2008-11-23T22:28Z,"Okay... I know how to use daemon tools and I had a previous download of rosetta stone but I formatted so here I am, confused.


I downloaded the program, Installed Rosetta stone, patched it... works perfectly. But where I get lost is the four folders it extras. The .rsd files. I mount any one of those and try opening rosetta stone to mount the image and it says theres no cd language files in the drive.


So can someone briefly explain to me... what exact file I need to mount? I have the four folders (data, documentation, languages, speech) In data its just a bunch of 00, 0a, 0b, 0c... files that are .rsd and ive mounted multiple ones and none of them are picking up when i run the app as a language cd... ?? "
,ashnoob,2008-11-23T22:38Z,"Okay i figured it out. Instead of unzipping say ""spanish level one"" and trying to mount files that unzipped you just mount the whole file zipped file. Doh simple but I wouldve never guessed it. "
,Saadi,2008-12-11T03:51Z,"Hey Guyz This Guide worked flawlessly on My PC
*******New Updates*******
*************************
1.) Download the version 3 application from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3852202/The_Rosetta_Stone_Application_(Version_3) and install it.

**2.) Run the program! It may go right to the activation screen. Ignore it, and close the program after opening it. This will automatically generate the necessary tracking.db3 file needed to run the update on step 3! Simply deleting the tracking.db3 file may or may not solve the 5118/9212 error message.

3.) Download the version 3 update from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4095208/Rosetta.Stone.3.0.57.UPDATE and install it.

4.) Download the *NEXT* version 3 update from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4155016/Rosetta_Stone_Version_3_(v3.2.11)_Update_from_3.0.57 and install it.

4.) Download the version 3.2.11 patch from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4210973/Rosetta.Stone.v3.2.11.Patch
Put patch.exe in the Rosetta Stone directory at C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone V3 and double click on it to run the patch. If you are using Vista, right-click on it first and select run as admin.

5.) Download the languge files you want from esarhaddon's page:http://thepiratebay.org/user/esarhaddon/0/1 and mount them with daemon (the easiest to use).

6.) Run the Rosetta Stone application and click check for updates later, click on add languages, add the first language, unmount the first language disk and mount the other levels of that language or other languages you want to learn. Do add another language until you have all of them that you want.

7.) Click on activate or whatever.

8.) The patch will keep RS from going to the RS website and ask if you want to activate by phone. Click on show me how. Enter all Xes for each of the languages listed.

9.) RS will show you some numbers to give the person you supposedly are calling. Instead of calling, enter all 1s as if the RS representative had given you them, Once again, do this for all the languages listed.

10.) Click OK and RS will thank you for licensing.

11.) Start learning. At least one unit per day creates the best retention rate!

***Additional notes: A headset IS NOT required to use this program, although it is recommended for the learning experience."

,funkeymonky9810,2009-06-01T20:39Z,when i get to 9th step to click patch it says that it cannot patch becuase the file is in use. any ideas?
,hihihang1987,2009-06-07T01:04Z,"hey funkeymonky9810
that could be because you are using vista. if so, right click on the patch and choose run as administrator, that should work fin after that. i had the same problem too. Enjoy :)"
,metro99,2009-06-10T03:36Z,"Can someone confirm if this file has the MBlast Worm or not?   

Seems odd only there's only 1 comment about the worm.  If it were true seems like there would more comments about it.

,garrison23,2009-06-15T01:50Z,"Ok I am new to this but I really want to use Rosetta Stone.  I downloaded the torrent and followed the instructions but I never got the message when I copied the RSV 3.2.11(Update 2) and pasted it in the application folder

""Activation area replaced with ""minor error""...Click 'OK'

enjoy :)""
-click on ""Patch""

Also is that the ""patch"" or the update or is it both in one?? And when I opened up the application to paste it, the file with the same name is already in there and when I click paste it just asked me if I want to override the existing file...so I clicked yes and then double clicked on it and it just restarts the update installation.  And it still asks for the activation code too.  So can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong?!?!?  I am using windows XP.  Ive have tried with the internet ON and OFF and still doesnt work.  Thank you"

,johnd177,2009-08-08T07:05Z,"I have having two problems: 

1. I can't find the licensing file in the program data and program file folders. So, I couldn't install the patch. But, the program is not giving any errors as of now. 

2. I am unable to install the chinese language pack. I burned a cd, but RS refuses to see the cd. I mounted the iso file, but RS doesn't give me the option of looking in a different drive. It searches on its own and comes up with nothing! 

What can i do to solve these problems? "
