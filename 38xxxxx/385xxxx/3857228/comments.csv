,Salx,2007-11-17T19:11Z,Any updates on the seeding capabilities on this one? Is it moving forward? (I'm at 51.9%)
,Expedience,2007-11-18T06:01Z,"I was able to provide several episodes on my own, and my ~100 kBps speeds worked excellently for those. It also looks like someone might have helped on seeding the specials -- or else the early swarm had a lot of people focusing on that as high-priority.

Some quick math suggests that at his present average speed, it'll take maybe around 20 days more to complete the seed, even if he's super-seeding. It's quite possible that he has not been super-seeding, in which case, who knows? If he started super-seeding, dedicated his bandwidth to this torrent alone, and had 20-30 kBps upload, he could manage to finish the torrent within a week or so. 

I'm going to see if I can't find duplicate copies of some of these episodes on other trackers. Hopefully I can speed it up by a couple of days. But I'm not optimistic."
,digchaos,2007-11-18T19:20Z,Stuck at 51.9% someone who has 100% please seed

,zdubsey,2008-01-12T22:59Z,"Not a bad collection at all.

The labels are a bit off, mainly not consistent.

It has the first 4 episodes of Season 6 (3 episodes and 1 special)


The only things missing are Season 5 Episode 1 - Hindenburg Mysteries  (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3599417/MythBusters_-_501_-_Hindenburg_Mystery.avi)

and Specials 6 and 7


Which are Mythbusters Revealed and Hollywood Exposed

,007craft,2008-01-15T01:17Z,Just to let everyone know you might want to hold out on downloading this one.  Im currently working on a true organized pack with seasons 1-6 with every episode + special + numbered correctly and All the highest quality around the net.   All WS and most dvd rip too.  Im still hunting down 10-20 episodes but once im done I will be sure to upload it and the quality will be much better then any of the packs released thus far.
