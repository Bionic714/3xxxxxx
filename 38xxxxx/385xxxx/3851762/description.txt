Here it finally is, you Machinae Supremacy fans. Their first musicvideo which have been long waited for, by this rising underground band which has shaken the very foundations of metal. 

Machinae Supremacy is a band located in northern Sweden playing the musical style "Sid-Metal". In short - A mix of metal and tones made by a "computerchip" (Commodore 64) making the sound to be reqognized in, for example Super nintendo games. Dont let that explanation make you take this band unseriously. This is very real epic music that could blow you away.
