Ive been in the scene since I was thirteen, since 86, but I never listened to them. Ringo Starr said he liked them once on TV. Well, I read an article and got on here to get some stuff, and I saw you have this, their first show on video. So thank you very much, I have a lot of experience in Rehab and Psycho care facilities myself. And have a special interest in how others are cared for. Peace and Love."
