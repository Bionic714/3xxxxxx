,krinkkrinkkrink,2008-01-30T22:55Z,"Wow!!!! Thank you so much (muchas gracias?) 5 hours trying to get the ""other"" (awkeygen.exe)  crack 2 work, following directions to a T, every cobination of possible interps of globetrotters instructions, I was almost ready to give up.  2 mins 1 click and this prog puts a aw.dat on your desktop. simply create a folder called FLEXLM on your c:\ drive( i guess u cld call it anything?),drag the file his prog made from your desktop to the new C:\Flexlm (none of that DOS command-line *!%) into in your FLEXLM folder. try to start 8.5; when it complains about not being reged, select i d like to enter my info/then..from file\-- direct maya to ur c:\flexam\aw.dat maya made a happy face, so did I all works well!! . his [her?]program created a perfect dat file!!!

You could also select id like to entr reg info / copy and paste from the aw.dat on desktop, and i think ---select paste or type reg  information/ paste it and maya will do the rest.. not sure, but i think thats how it would work as an simpler,alternate mthd. 

ANYWAY____THANKS< Nobody, you really should take credit for that one- made a lot of peeps happy!"
,tfrazer,2008-02-09T17:26Z,In english... simply run the filegen.bat file which creates a file named aw.dat in your desktop. Then open Maya and select the register from a file option. Select the previously created file then it's done!
,Trackstar721,2008-02-21T15:14Z,"After I downloaded this, my friend tried to use it on a Mac and it said that there is a trojan in this crack. I didn't get any warnings from my anti-virus though. Info would be appreciated."
,SCA_Kaiser,2008-03-19T23:42Z,"I can't get any keygen / crack to work. Is it absolutely necessary to have it on a C: drive? All my computer has is F:, and I can't find a free partition software to make a C:. is there something else I'm missing? I follow every set of instructions and modified instructions I find, but it always comes up with ""There are no appropriate licenses installed on your computer"". SO LAME!! Someone please give me a suggestion that works..."
,vinc3nt1n0,2008-03-21T21:14Z,"Ok friends this trick is for who have the FFFFFF address (like me :P)

Install vmware server
http://register.vmware.com/content/download.html
When vmare askes serial number click on skip button...and that's it!
Now if you go on Autodesk-->common utilities-->FlexLM license utilities you'll see a new ethernet address.

So now you can follow the cracking-guide posted some thread ago!

ENJOY!! "
,xenunymous,2008-04-04T21:15Z,"If you're on a MacBook and are using Parallels to run Windows for the crack, but installing Maya on the OS X side, remember that your Ethernet address is different in Parallels. Go to 
System Preferences/Network
click the Built-In Ethernet
click on Advanced
go to the Ethernet tab, and there you will find your ethernet address.
When you type this into your aw.dat file, remove any "":"" between numbers. "
,gl23,2008-04-15T04:06Z,"I have a Mac pc G5 and but when installing Maya 2008 unlimited it says that it needs to search for prekey license. Could some help me. I install Maya 8.5 with no problem and it didn't ask for an prekey before installing it. It just in stall, and they i just simply follow the instructions that was give by the user who upload software."
,blimeyoriley,2008-04-26T16:08Z,"ok after spending quite a while trying to figure this out myself, i feel it would be helpful if i described what i did.
i have a mac running leopard, and xp installed via boot camp.
i used the awkeygen.exe method.
first get your ETHERNET address. i am using airport, and tried my airport address but it didnt work, so copy and paste your ethernet address into aw.dat (replacing ""your_host"")
this can be done by opening aw.dat in textedit.
then copy the edited aw.dat and awkeygen.exe to windows.
drag aw.dat onto awkeygen.exe.
then double click awkeygen.exe.
this will edit aw.dat
copy aw.dat ONLY back to your mac to /var/flexlm/
to get to this location open finder and press shift, command, g
then type /var/flexlm/
and copy aw.dat to that location
there should only be one copy of aw.dat there, so if one already exists, replace it
open maya, and voila!
hope this helps"

,vivasvan,2008-11-10T18:52Z,nope it didnt help..i ve tried it with both my ethernet adresses and with this crack still it dont find any license says instalation incopplete:(
,arseface1985,2008-11-13T05:21Z,"Well... I was having a lot of trouble trying to activate this too...
I took a shot with the automated crack with no luck also... so i got maya working doing the manual keygen aw.dat stuff as described from de torrent but using a different number for my ethernet: 

at FlexLM License Utility I was getting for my Ethernet this kind of number: 0015af237f3d 001bfcedbe53 001bfcedbde0

The number will change from computer to computer, but it was that long...
I tried everything: adding ""-"" between the number groups, adding "":"", removing the spaces... but it would generate an ""wrong syntax"" or ""invalid parameter"" error in every attempt.

So, if you are experiencing the same problem as mine, try the following:

1) go to run and type ""cmd"".
2) in the prompt, type ""cd\""
3) type ""getmac /v""

a short list of your conections will show up, with a bunch of numbers, some of them will look like the one displayed in the FlexLM License, for they are as big as the one that showed up.

BUT thats the trick: do not use none of them, instead use the shorter ones that comes before the long ones. They will appear in this kind of syntax: ""00-00-00-00-00-00"" using letters and numbers.

copy this fella (you gotta chose wich one is from your active conection I think, but thats ok, I just got 3 of these in my attempt, and the first one was the correct) to your aw.dat and replace the ""your_host"" with it (don't forget to remove the ""-"", so that the number will be in this syntax: ""0000000000"", a 10 digit number and, of course, without the quotes).

Now you can do the mumbo jumbo described above or simply drag the aw.dat to your keygen... and VOILA. install the license and go get yourself a beer.

At least it worket for me.

Hope I have helped. "
,blovcandy,2009-03-16T23:51Z,"Thank you so much dude ! vinc3nt1n0..

Now Maya 2008 works excellent in My system. 

Actually i got a fuckin problem with Maya 08 for a long time. I could not install the ""FlexLM keygen.exe and aw.dat"" because my ethernet ID was fffffff some thing, that's why  i didn't run maya. 


After your instruction i installed the ""VMware server console"" from 

http://register.vmware.com/content/download.html


i installed it and i got new ethernet ID, now maya working perfectly. Thank you dude.

If any one having problem with FFFFFFF ethernet ID please visit above mentioned website and download ""VMware server 1.0.6"" it is the ""EXE"" file, it will come around 140 MB size

1.download it and setup. it will take some time
   Keep wait... at end of installation it will ask  you register number you just press ""skip"" button. 

2. Your system will restart

3. Now Go to Start ----> All Prog. -----> Auto   desk ---- Common utilities ----> flexLM utility

4. Under ""system settings"" find Ethernet Address. it will be like this """"001cc07b85c8 005056c00001 005056c00008"""".

5. Be careful while copying this address, please copy the last no, i mean ""005056c00008"", dont copy whole number (without quotes) 

6. Now open aw.dat (C:/FlexLM/aw.dat) with wordpad and replace ""your host ID"" save and exit.

7. drag this aw.dat file on the awkeygen.exe

8. It is almost finished now. do  the remaining procedure... Maya will work... Gud luck dudes

I did exactly as explained here, in the install.txt and everywhere else.
When I choose the aw.dat from the license tool I got the message everything was okay. However when I tried to start Maya, I still got the message ""no valid license..."".

Finally I tried to disable my network card, rebooted and enabled it again. Then it worked! Don't ask me why, just wanted to share how I finaly got i to work.."
