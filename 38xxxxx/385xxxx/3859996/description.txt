When four buddies reunite for the first time at their college reunion,
they are immediately challenged by Rick Foster (Kevin Dillon) who didn't come to laugh
about old times, but to win some cash in a not-so-friendly game of All-American golf.
Their carefree days of college come crashing into the realities of adulthood
during this wild golfing weekend where these old friends rediscover 
what they've lost on the Back Nine of life.
