There's a couple of different torrents floating around for this particular PAL DVD R2 release, but I just wasted several days downloading this only to discover it is the SHORTER 1984 re-release version from Disney. It is only 102 minutes and it SHOULD be 129 minutes! Several scenes and songs are cut from this version of the movie.....This version should never have been put out on DVD, let alone put out online. Total waste of time!"
,kriegerg69,2009-10-20T04:12Z,"NOTE: Among the songs missing from this version is the main song from the film, ""Candle On The Water"", which was Oscar-nominated as Best Song that year.

I seriously can't believe this is still online, and that no one else has complained about how short this is!"
