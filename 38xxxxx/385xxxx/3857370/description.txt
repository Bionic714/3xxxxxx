Ahhhh, the good old days before Harry Potter we had "The Worst Witch". In my opinion, the author of harry potter got her base idea from this movie. oh well.
This is a full 1:1 dvd5 image of the worst witch. the only one available is the full frame. if there is a wide screen i wish i could have it.

I hope this brings back memories to all who have seen this.

note: this is not the series of the worst witch, this is the actual film that started all of that.
