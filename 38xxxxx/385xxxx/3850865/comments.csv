,sappy,2007-12-24T16:39Z,"Working very well! (not a fake as someone said)
Nice job. "
,dondashall,2007-12-31T00:02Z,"HOw do you copy this? I tried burning the .iso file with toast and the xbox finds the game, but it can't play it. What am I doing wrong?"
,sup2000,2008-01-14T12:44Z,"hmm
i downloaded similar torrent 
burned it as i always do
but this time it did not work (the dvd shows the picture - put this disk in xbox360). my xbox see this disk only as video one. whats wrong? is this one working on PAL xbox?"
,Jonathan1321,2008-02-05T17:58Z,How can i burn these files onto a DVD any guides or tips as to what i do. Do i just make it into a .ISO??
,Gamegod0462,2008-08-15T06:54Z,in this case MULTI5 does not mean region free.  Wrong region error on us ntsc consoles.  I will go back to playing and scratching up my original.
,Bjorkved,2008-08-23T11:08Z,Tack!
,akjake,2008-12-01T16:52Z,How do you make un .iso file out of this?
,PYTWOTL,2008-12-06T03:15Z,"Can someone please seed, i'm stuck at 98%...."
,PYTWOTL,2008-12-07T15:27Z,"I'm using my computer and hoping the emulator works although i dont know how to use it, can someone help me"
[T],Distrance,2009-01-01T15:57Z,"To all dumb people : You can not run this game through emulator. Actually, I would be pretty damn interested where do you find a computer to emulate Xbox 360 games perfectly fine without lag. Don't be stupid, you get 360 for much cheaper than a computer able to emulate... rofl noobs."
,Pette94,2009-01-08T15:11Z,how do you make a iso out of this?i dont know how to use this...
,VampireSwizzy,2009-01-17T09:47Z,"Answer to those of you that don't know how to use this kind of release: unrar/unzip the files! (mark all of them and select: Unrar/Unzip)

Then you burn it OR test it with ABGX360/XDVDMulleter"
[T],Distrance,2009-01-20T23:13Z,"Is there any things I need to know when burning 360 backups ? I was thinking to do it with Xbox backup creator, but what kind of disc do I need ? I know it must be DL, but DL-R or +R ?

Someone said I need +R but with booktype set to -R... but my dvd drive doesnt let me change the booktype with a program so -.-"
,zedjohan,2009-05-21T23:00Z,"To all of you who have problems with this files.
mark one of the files and use ""open with"" then you chose manuly WinRar. then you will unrar it like you use to with other xbox games...

hope it helps.

btw

Great game works fine and is region free.

two tumbs up!"
,thehelo,2009-06-20T07:45Z,"so i downloaded this not paying attention to the fact that its pal until xdvdmulleter told me.

damn"
,thelazy1,2009-07-12T20:36Z,Also downloaded without looking.  It is not Region Free like the previous poster commented.  Ran through abgx360.
,Gurraburran,2010-12-01T20:44Z,can anyone please seed this?
