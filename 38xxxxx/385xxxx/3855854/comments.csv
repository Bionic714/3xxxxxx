I have downloaded already some Airbus from Wilco from TPB, and I've ever had problem with the course, speed selector in the cockpit. The don't work, they stay 340 (HDG - Heading) and 000 (Speed Selector). 
I've the problem with the Airbus A32x and A330/340.
Why this?
And how can I solve this problems?

Thanks, and sorry if my english is not very well."
