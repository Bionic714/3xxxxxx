,FUBAR117,2007-10-26T00:30Z,"Not attacking anyone, but SOAD is not breaking up!!!  If you go to their website, it specifically says that they are not breaking up.  They are merely taking a break from touring.  Like what Kiss did.

Great torrent btw. XD"

,Blazig,2007-11-18T23:46Z,"I think that all Serj cares about is that people hear his music. I mean, his lyrics have got a real deep meaning.
And to Acxer: What the hell do you mean buy ""Buy this CD and SOAD might come back""? It's not like they took a break because of financial problems. xD"
