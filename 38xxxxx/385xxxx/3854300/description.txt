AVI -> DVD re-encode of episodes 07-12 from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3653035/, which are a tv-rip.

Made these to tide me over until next Spring, when the R1 DVDs come out; thought I'd share.

NTSC; English language, no subtitles; 5-minute chapters; cheesy menu.

They're half-D1, but the source AVIs weren't much better.  Still look pretty good to my eyes tho.

Episodes 01-06 (DVD9): http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3853130/

Episodes 13-18 (DVD9) and 19-20 (DVD5) forthcoming.
