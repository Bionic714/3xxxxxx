Editorial Reviews
Amazon.com
Daughter of original Bossa Nova legends Joao Gilberto and Miucha, niece of the great singer-songwriter Chico Burque, Bebel Gilberto's talents have proven more than worthy of her exalted descent. She has not only helped to revitalize modern Brazilian music but has established it as a major force on the world stage. But are these 13 remixes worthy of her? The answer is a qualified yes. The whole point of this type of exercise is to reveal new facets of an existing track by inviting another artist to collaborate on it--after the fact. Everyone involved with these re-workings displays considerable taste and restraint; thus any negative impressions would have to be completely subjective. The originals were produced by Marius de Vries and were comparatively pop-oriented anyway. Gently-imposed beats and touches of chilly electronica do not freeze the singer's digital hothouse bloom but add an additional dimension. Some tunes, such as Ceu Distante, even emerge embellished with a surprisingly genteel, retro finesse. --Christina Roden
