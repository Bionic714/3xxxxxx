AVI -> DVD re-encode of episodes 01-06 from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3653035/, which are a tv-rip.

Made these to tide me over until next Spring, when the R1 DVDs come out; thought I\'d share.

NTSC; English language, no subtitles; 5-minute chapters; cheesy menu.

They\'re half-D1, but the source AVIs weren\'t much better.  Still look pretty good to my eyes tho.

Episodes 07-12 (DVD9), 13-18 (DVD9), and 19-20 (DVD5) forthcoming.

Please seed after downloading!
