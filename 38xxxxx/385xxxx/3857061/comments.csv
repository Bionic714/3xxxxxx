,KingManon,2007-10-27T12:26Z,"My bad! Caused by seeking, the sound has to catch up!"
,megamhz,2008-01-27T09:51Z,i could not get it to play properly tried a bunch of things ?
,s3x.m4ch1n3,2008-08-11T07:41Z,"its because it's being converted to dvd, and the maximum horizontal resolution is 720px. your dvd player(any dvd player) can't handle anything alse. If you want to keep the HD resolution I suggest you convert it to a blu-ray or hddvd format and try playing it back on either 2. www.digital-digest.com might help you."

The only problem I had was that to burn it to a AVCHD DVD (aka for a PS3/BD Player) I had to re-encode it, so I recommend encoding in a more compatible format next time. (I think it has to be profile 4.1, and maybe a few other changes)"

I guess I'll be trashing this file and looking for another."
