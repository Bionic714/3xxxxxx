Star Wars
A New Hope
1080p

x264 video, the original audio track and the commentary from the DVD in HE AAC, the original chapters from the DVD and a nice versatile MKV container.

This is for all those who love h.264 quality!



Right now you may be asking yourself what the difference between this release and all of the other copies of Return Of The Jedi in HD is. There is one major difference. I have taken the commentary from the DVD by George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher and incorporated it into this copy. Also I added the chapter directory from the DVD. I often backup movies to DVD for archival purposes and I know many other people do as well so I have decided to split this movie into DVD friendly portions. I have incorporated a function called linking which is only available in the .MKV container into these files. So when both parts are played from the same directory they will play as one. If you select the second part to watch the movie will play from the beginning. The time code is also seamless between the two segments. The second part doesn't begin at 0 with a new time code. Watching these two parts should be one seamless stream to the observer. This is why I have chosen to make this movie a .MKV instead of .mp4 as I usually do. So with this copy there is no need to have your HD Star Wars movie watching experience interrupted at some arbitrary point because you need to load the second part.



Luke Skywalker stays with his foster aunt and uncle on a farm on Tatooine. He is desperate to get off this planet and get to the Academy like his friends, but his uncle needs him for the next harvest. Meanwhile, an evil emperor has taken over the galaxy, and has constructed a formidable "Death Star" capable of destroying whole planets. Princess Leia, a leader in the resistance movement, acquires plans of the Death Star, places them in R2D2, a droid, and sends him off to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Before he finds him, R2D2 ends up on Skywalkers' farm with his friend C3PO. R2 then wanders into the desert, and when Luke follows, they eventually come across Obi-Wan. Will Luke, Obi-Wan, and the two droids be able to destroy the Death Star, or will the Emperor rule forever ?
