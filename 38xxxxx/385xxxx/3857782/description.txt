Japanese import with bonus track \\\\\\\"The Prince\\\\\\\". Due to the Japanese standards of audio mastering, some would say this is the best available version of ..and Justice For All. We aren\\\\\\\'t fortunate to have a DCC version of this album so this is the cosest we will get. I\\\\\\\'ve compared this to the Elektra release and have noticed a higher level of clarity in this version. Don\\\\\\\'t take my word for it. Hear for yourself.
