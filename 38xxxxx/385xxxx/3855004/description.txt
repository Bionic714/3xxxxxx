How many of us bought the overly priced expansions, expensive SCSI harddisks and
CDR/W drives after Korg told us they would work, only to find they didn't?  And
then on top of that, they release floppy disk soundbanks at $50 each?  We love our
Trinity, but hate getting screwed.  This is why I made this release.  I spent years
accumulating these sounds by buying them, and through extensive searching.  In many
cases, where I obtained them from other countries, I had to get the names of these
files translated into English.  Finally I have achieved the COMPLETE COLLECTION.
This is EVERYTHING (and more) that Korg ever officially released for the Trinity.
Every sound, every PCG, every Akai Sample.  I hope you will enjoy this as much as I 
do.  In addition to these, I have also included every manual, utility and software,
as well as the REASON TRINITY REFILL, to give you an additional "Virtual TR Rack".



-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


Instructions:-

First of all you MUST have either the HDI-TRI Harddisk recorder board or the SCSI-TRI
expansion installed in order to make the most of this.  If you have neither, you will
be spending hours copying the files to hundreds of floppy disks!

IMPORTANT!

If you don't have the PBS-TRI (Akai Playback Sample Board) installed in your Trinity
(Trinity Pro / Pro-X may have this as standard), then you won't be able to load/install
half these files.  Any model of Trinity can install PCG's, but if they relate to PBS
sample banks, it's not worth installing them either.  Basically, only PBS users can
open Korg multisamples.

Secondly, if you don't have the SOLO-TRI or Z1-TRI (Korg Prophecy / Z1 / V3) boards installed, 
you will not be able to install those corresponding files either.  I am
fortunate enough to own a Trinity Pro-X, and can install everything in this torrent,
but you may need to check your manuals first.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCSI CD-ROM OWNERS

Simply Burn the ISO and put it into the CD-Rom you have connected to your
Trinity / TR Rack.  All other files are to be opened or installed on your PC.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCSI HARDDISK / IOMEGA ZIP250 OR JAZ DRIVE OWNERS

Either burn the ISO to a CD then extract the files to your Zip/Jaz/Harddisk, or
use MagicISO to extract the files directly.  The Trinity can read these files
straight off the bat without need of conversion.  All other files are to be opened
or installed on your PC.

That's all there is to it!  I won't say "If you like it, go buy it", because you can't.
All these ROMS / Files are out of production, and screw Korg anyway! They screwed you!

HAVE FUN AND ENJOY MY FIRST RELEASE!
