,FTF96,2007-10-23T23:41Z,"Hi

,slippery1,2007-10-24T01:03Z,"hi this sounds great.. do you plan on seeding?

should i send an email? i really want this "
,FTF96,2007-10-24T03:28Z,"I have been seeding, but whilst I went out tonight, the computer restarted due to an update, and uTorrent didn't reboot as a result.  It is seeding now.

I do occasionally have issues with my comptuer restarting, but once it's back up, I always seed immediately."
,FTF96,2007-10-24T03:35Z,"URGENT:

A quick update to this ISO.  You should all know that in order for this to work on your Trinity, you MUST do the following:-

If you plan on copying to a harddisk/Jaz/Zip, the disk MUST be formatted in FAT (FAT16) and NOT FAT32 or NTFS.  The Trinity OS cannot read anything else.  Also, The formatted disk MUST NOT HAVE A PARTITION OVER 530MB.  Any partitions over this size will render it unreadable, and the Trinity will label it ""unformatted"".

If you plan on burning to a CDR, the same applies.  The disk must not be over 530mb in total file size.

So to recap; SCSI Disks / Harddisks must be formatted to FAT16 and no larger partitioned than 530MB.  CDRs must have a file size of no larger than 530mb.  If you fail to meet that criteria, this torrent will not work on your Trinity.

Finally, please remember to check that your Trinity has the appropriate expansion boards to cope with them.  SOLO-TRI files are for the Solo board, PBS-TRI are for the sample board, and HDI-TRI/SCSI-TRI for a SCSI connection.  If you don't have any of those, you will only be able to load a small percentage of .PCG files.

,FTF96,2007-10-24T03:39Z,"Oh another thing.  For some reason this torrent is seeding from me at 99%, but I assure you it is complete and working.  I don't know why it's not showing on my end as 100%, so I hope it is for you all.  If you get to 99% and no further, try to burn it anyway.  I'm pretty sure it'll work."
,FTF96,2007-10-25T00:27Z,50 leechers and no thanks? That's just bad manners.
,FTF96,2007-10-29T21:34Z,"Just so everyone knows.  999% IS 100%.  I am the original seeder and it says I am seeding at 99.9%, yet the files still work fine.  If you get to 99.9% and no further, just burn the ISO, it'll be fine.

,Avatar4550,2008-02-29T18:31Z,"I am not a Trinity user (just interested in music software in general and saw this browsing...). I wanted to commend you on your thoroughness and logical approach to compiliing all this... well done!!
