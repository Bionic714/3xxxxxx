Drunken Master II (Jackie Chan, Ti Lung, 1994) EN, Remastered - Rmvb

HKFlix Says:  
Pretty much as good as it gets for Jackie Chan martial arts films! Lots of creative fight scenes (Jackie Chan does "drunken boxing" better than anyone!), filmed very well, with characters you care about; interesting sets and cinematography; and a good, simple plot. Top this off with an irresistible performance by the ever-naughty Anita Mui and a great soundtrack, and you've got a real winner. 

Avg. Rating:  4.8 / 5 (based on 54 ratings). What did you think of it?  

Plot: When the British government is discovered smuggling precious Chinese artifacts out of the country, folklore hero Wong Fei Hong uses his uniquely outlandish style of martial arts--drunken boxing--to salvage the valuables before it's too late! 
 
Overview: This sequel to 1978's DRUNKEN MASTER features Jackie Chan returning to his role as the mischievous martial artist who outsmarts his father and tangles with Euro-thugs in the streets of Hong Kong in order to rescue stolen Chinese artifacts. Chan employs the hilarious but effective style of kung fu known as the "drunken" style. The movie is a true action masterpiece featuring some of the most intense fighting sequences ever filmed.
