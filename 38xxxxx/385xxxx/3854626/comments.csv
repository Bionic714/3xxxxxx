,Ahrie,2008-03-01T07:31Z,Hey Crane_Man... just wanna say that I LOVE YOU!!!! I'm at the point where I'm just downloading all my ipod videos from you only. I tend to have trouble with playing other people's mp4s on my ipod... but you're have all been go thus far. So... I was wondering if you took requests? Maybe... the other 4 Harry Potter movies? And maybe some of the Disney classics? I'm a disney and other animated movies junkie... and my goal is to get all of them on my ipod..lol. =)
