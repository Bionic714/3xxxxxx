Sigur Ros at the BBC Electric Proms performing a live set before the screening of heima.


# - The Cecil Sharp house is packed to the gills in anticipation of an evening of Sigur Ros saturation ...

# - The first of tonight's triptych is a live set . The Culture Show's Verity Sharp is introducing them.

# - Goggi, Jonsi, Kjarri and Orri take the stage. Jonsi says they're just gonna play a few songs, and then it's straight in.

# - A baby grand, dry ice and beautiful scenery visuals for first song, 'Vaka'.

# - Some tired helium balloons stuck against the ceiling seem strangely fitting.

# - Samskeyti Ageatis follows. The acoustic setting with drums played with brushes translates, nicely laid back. Orri's drumming in thick socks ...

# - Ooh, it's the one everyone loves! Byrjun. You sigh on, as we sing along in English.

# - Now everyone's swapping instruments. Jonsi's on harmonium, goggi's on marimba. They play staralfur. They are true masters of the pregnant pause!

# - Aminna, string quartet join for 'Heima'. This drawn out tune is the signature of the night. It's a little bit Philip Glass, a little bit Michael Nyman. Lovely.

# - Now the saddest song Njosnavellin. So much longing is captured in some made up words.

# - The lighting and strings are all much warmer now. Drums played with beaters and a picture behind of a house with white picket fence.

# - Finally, the double bass gets a play!

# - Jonsi has a quiet moment with his acoustic guitar. Pins drop.

# - A sudden end, Goggi puts his shoes back on and they have a stage bow to all the whistling and wooping. Fantastic gig.
