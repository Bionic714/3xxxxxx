The Honolulu rock scene is small. In fact, it\\\'s virtually non-existent. It seems logical that any band worthy of playing for a crowd of more than ten would pack it up and head for bigger horizons. That\\\'s exactly what a group of Oahu upstarts known as Chokebore did some 10 years ago.

ENJOY THIS AWESOME INDIE ROCK BAND,,,WHICH TOURED WITH THE NIRVANA ON THEIR LAST  SHOWS..
