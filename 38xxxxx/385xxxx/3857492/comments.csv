,larka2006,2007-10-25T01:25Z,"Why do you talk so much rubbish, dont you think the police would have charged them by now, also why did the cheif detective get sacked, and the second in charge, i'll tell you why becuase they were trying to frame to innocent people who have been thorough the most horrible of circumstances, i just wish people would stop accusing the parents, it obvious they played no part in their daughters dissapearnce."
,MrBert,2007-10-25T11:21Z,"yes its sad and tragic, but how many other kids go missing/kidnapped etc and i dont see their bloody parents getting 1 on 1s with the pope, over hyped far too much. 
and fyi the portugese police (if you read the papers) cannot press charges/take them to court unless they have a body. so even if they were involved as long as there is no body there are no charges.
if they do turn out to be guilty i would not be shocked and vice versa. too much hearsay, too much hype, too much press coverage, too fucking much.
 before you start flaming me, if your kid went missing 1 week after maddie and you got 0% press coverage i dont think youd be on their side."
