,siromaha,2007-11-19T01:28Z,but it works perfect
,manulpz,2007-11-19T01:35Z,I drag the file into the patch but when i try execute the office 2008 say me that the time expired. I have  restart the mac os x?thanks.
,Interpolice,2007-11-19T07:06Z,But where is Mac Office 2008 beta?
,k3vinjunk,2007-11-19T11:58Z,"Didn't work for me...I patched successfully multiple times, but I still get a ""time expired"" message when I launch office. If this ever worked, my guess is that if you patch before the time expired it worked, but not anymore."
,xtraa,2007-11-19T14:43Z,"duh, 

If it doesn't install or work, do the following: 

1. uninstall Office by deleting it from 
- Applications
- Library/ApplicationSupport
- Library/Receipts

2. disconnect from the web

3. set your date back to anything before Nov. 10th

4. install Office, let it start up, then exit.

5. apply patch

6. start office, exit

7. reconnect to the web and set your date back to the actual date.

That serial is the one everybody is using.  The beta has expired.  You still need the crack to remove the time bomb. Read the torrent description above."
