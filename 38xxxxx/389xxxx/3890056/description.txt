
Debian Linux Transparent Web Proxy Virtual Machine

VMWare image of Debian Etch, running, Squid, Dansguardian & ClamAV setup as a Transparent web proxy. This proxy server was
created with parents, schools & small business in mind as there really isn't a solution at this price range.

Extract the 7Z file using 7Zip (http://www.7-zip.org) and WinRAR. Open the vmx file in VMWare Player/VMWare Workstation/VMWare Server

Login with the following:

user: sysadmin
password: sysadmin

or 
user: root
password: debianrocks

Dansguardian is listening on port 8080. Type ifconfig to see your IP Address and configure your browsers to use a proxy at that IP, port 8080
