Visit this website- it is awesome- check it out- you will Thank me for this. I swear on my life the greatest day of my life was when I found out about this corporation. I make so much money doing so little. A MUST check out website. "
,SlapBass,2008-01-04T16:32Z,"How the FUCK am I supposed to extract this file with WinRAR or anything else, if there isn't even the main file in it!?! files starts with ""dgr-nfspsp.001"" and not with .rar!?!?!?!"
,Drunken Fella,2008-01-09T01:23Z,"I have downloadet this release [from another site though, but still DAGGER's release]. Just as a note, I really think this game is a great disappointment considering graphics. Especially, if you compare it with GT4, or even Burnout: Dominator [which is a EA-game as well]. And for some of the questions: YES, it works fine, even in Europe. I burned it using a noname DVD using Nero 7. I play it a PSTwo with Matrix Infinty using an original Sony component cable [which I absolutly can recommend - just looks ten times greater than the std. composite signal]"
,effiepeffie,2008-01-11T23:35Z,"..of course it works good in europe - never had a problem with us games.
although ntsc is lower quality than pal

would have preferred an english pal version but this will do.. thanx"

,JwMonE99,2008-02-24T20:00Z,"Hey I am kinda new to torrents especially with the games. If I download a torrent and let it finish with azurous, I just burn it into a disk and play it on my ps2 or do I need a mod chip or what? Thanks "
,Kicksilver,2008-02-27T18:06Z,"I'm willing to seed this, but I need to have it downloaded first! I'm stuck at 34%, please seed!"
,fordklub,2008-03-07T20:21Z,How get working this game ? is starts but says DISK CANNOT PLAYED i exract file to iso and burn and i use matrix infinity chip. What i do wrong. My burning speed is 4x and i use programs ultra iso and alcohol.

,signcodeindie,2008-08-25T13:01Z,"I am in india have a Mod chip PS2, i burned it using DVD Decrypter but it never goes beyond PS2 Logo Screen.

What i am thinking is that this is am running in PAL thats why it doesnt work.

Can anyone give pointers of how to convert to PAL?"
,orbitztlc,2009-04-03T08:44Z,"HI signcodeindie,

Ur PS2 has a Mod Chip....so that means that it is will play PAL as well  as NTSC discs..both. Dont worry about converting it to PAL. There could be other reason why its not working fine.

But ur PS2 is good if Mod chip is installed."
