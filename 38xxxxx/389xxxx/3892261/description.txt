PhotoRescue supports the recovery of all file types but its algorithms are
particularly optimized for JPG or JPEG files, TIFF files, GIFs and BMPs. It also
offers a constantly updated support for CRW, NEF, ORF, MRW and many types of movie
files. In some cases, we can even rebuild pictures that have suffered minor
corruptions.

If your card is damaged, corrupted, or has been formatted, PhotoRescue is the best
data-recovery solution you can get: it consistently beats other solutions in
independent tests. PhotoRescue even deals with cases where the media is NOT visible
as a drive letter anymore. We get at the pictures other recovery software does not
even see. Our unique unfragmenting technology rebuilds cherished memories that would
otherwise have been lost forever
