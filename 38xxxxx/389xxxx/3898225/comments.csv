Just a couple of frases from one of the best live albums ever. Not only funny, but musically high standard. Way to go odoman!"
,ShadowMastr,2009-03-05T20:06Z,"Thanks very much for the collection. Saves me from having to digitize my LP's with their assorted pops and hisses.

The mp3 bitrates are all over the place. Even on the same record, they go from 96 to 160. Most are in the 128/160 range, but the odd 96 here and there kinda disappoints. "
,JonYo,2009-05-22T10:43Z,"Nice collection, I'm checking it out now...

Quick note -
Unfortunately, track 8 on Young And Rich is only half there, it cuts off at around 1:30."
,JonYo,2009-05-22T10:43Z,"Whoops!  Make that track 7 that cuts off, ""Proud To Be An American"""
,BoxMac,2009-05-29T21:09Z,"How the fuck is ""She's A Beauty"" not on here ?!?
That's the only song I want.  lol"
