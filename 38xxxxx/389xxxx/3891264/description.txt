This is my first attempt at creating a KVCD distribution. I need
feedback on how well this works with different VCD and DVD players,
so leave comments, please. I have the entire Werewolf (1987) TV series,
and yes, I plan to release every episode on KVCD's, at least until the
production company realises that there are people who would buy this on
DVD!

I will seed as long as I can before moving on to the next episode, so
PLEASE help me seed this if you want to see the entire series released.

Eric Cord comes home to his apartment to find his roommate and best
friend, Ted, loading a gun with silver bullets. Ted confesses to Eric
that he is a werewolf, and that he is responsible for a series of
brutal killings in the area. Ted wants to end his own life, but he
doesn't believe that he is strong enough to do it, so he asks Eric to
help him. Eric doesn't believe until the pentagram appears on Ted's
palm and starts to bleed. Ted transforms into a huge werewolf and goes
after Eric. Despite his love for his friend, Eric has no choice but to
shoot him. Eric later discovers that he has been bitten and infected
with the curse. Using the information that Ted gave to him, he skips
bail to search for Janos Skorzeny, the progenitor of the werewolf
bloodline. If he can find and kill Skorzeny, then the curse will be
lifted. Meanwhile, the bail bondsman has hired a bounty hunter named
Rogan to find Eric, and he's closing in...
