u have the other 29 episodes?"
,preservedforposterity,2007-11-14T14:59Z,"Yes, I have the entire series, all episodes. If people help me seed this, I'll keep posting until they are all uploaded. Also, anyone who wants to put these on other torrent sites - go for it. I think there are a lot of people who will want this."
,snorleif666,2007-11-14T15:37Z,"ill seed for a verry long time.

thanx  a lot!"
,preservedforposterity,2007-11-14T15:41Z,"Thanks. My maximum upload is only 30Kbps (isp restrictions), so it will take awhile for everyone to get this first episode from me initially. After the pilot, the episodes are only 30 minutes (actually less without the commercials), so they should go quicker. As soon as a few seeds have accrued on the Pilot, I will upload the next episode."
,aaronmcinnc,2007-11-15T00:40Z,"Downloading right now.... seeding at 30kbps, but once I finish downloading I'll kick it up. I was 10 when this series came out, and I loved it!! GOD I hope it plays on my player!"
,preservedforposterity,2007-11-15T02:53Z,"If it doesn't play on your player, leave a comment. I can make them into dvd's instead of kvcds. Would that be preferable?"
,preservedforposterity,2007-11-15T03:11Z,"At this moment there are about 15 people already at 97+%. A couple have already pulled a ''snatch and grab''. Come on people, help me seed this if you want the remaining episodes posted. thanks."
,lroven,2007-11-15T10:13Z,To bad the quality is poor
,preservedforposterity,2007-11-15T13:34Z,Wow - you folks kick arse - plenty of seeders so now I go to work on the next upload. I'm going to do these as DVD's instead of KVCD's - that way everyone can enjoy them. About four episodes per DVD. Back in a bit with the next up...
,preservedforposterity,2007-11-15T17:36Z,"The next four episodes have been uploaded.
Enjoy. and seed...seed...seed - thanks
have also re-upped this episode as a DVD."
