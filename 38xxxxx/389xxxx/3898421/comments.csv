This game works 100% no bs!
ALWAYS Read and follow all directions!
Installed on WinXP Pro w/SP3

I been playing the shit out of this since Feb. 08.
It's really good and driving is a lot more realistic when using a digital steering wheel.

I was having so much fun playing that i forgot to thank you. lol

Thanx ToeD
