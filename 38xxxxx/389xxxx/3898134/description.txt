In Search of The is a set of 13 albums by Buckethead, released on February 21st, 2007, each have been personally numbered and monogrammed by Buckethead himself. No two sets are the same, as the covers are handdrawn and totally unique from one another.[1]

According to Travis Dickerson;

â?? ...this is not a regular CD. It's hand made, hand burned. The cover is whatever is deemed to be written on it. This is not a manufactured deal, each one is different and will be numbered and monogramed. No two of these will be the same. I have never heard of an artist doing something like this. This is as direct from the artist to the fan as I have ever heard of. 
As far as the content, I don't know, but the mystery around it is no surprise. Again, I can't speculate because I don't want to mislead anyone, I just don't know anymore. My gut sense is this is a conceptual work, a piece of art. It could contain anything.
 â?? 

The set can be purchased as either a box set or separately. There seems to be no underlying theme or thread to the songs on the separate discs, and feature many different and diverse styles of music. The set also lacks any type of track listing for any of the songs.
