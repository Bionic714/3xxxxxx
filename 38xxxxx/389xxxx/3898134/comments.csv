,rohagymeg,2010-03-22T19:19Z,"I sometimes ""forget to seed to 1 ratio or more"" but It's not because I don't want to share, It's because my slow upload speed. But I swear I will come back and seed this torrent to more then 1 ratio.
You know what? Here is my email. When you see no seeders, just drop a mail me ok? This is the least what I can do!
