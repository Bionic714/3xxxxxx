,eckov14,2008-03-15T14:38Z,Has anyone had problems with audio?
,hotaches,2008-04-02T20:29Z,"Glad you like the film. It took me a year to film it, and months to edit it. If you bought the DVD then you'd see it at decent quality, and I might scrape enough money together to make the next one.

no problems with the audio

brilliant video, did you know 2 people have done it since him? they both did it after working on it for only a few days.

but this guy took about a year to do it. althoug he does say at the beggining that he has never done anything but a 8a+, and this is an 8c+.

i think the climbs that are this highley graded, are graded this high purely from the lack of protection. there is a limit to how hard a climb can be before its impossible. they just get more and more dangerouse. as the grades get higher."
,adeffis,2012-01-02T01:24Z,"I'm not affiliated with Dave in any way except in sharing the passion for climbing. In my opinion Dave MacLeod is one of the most respectable, humble climbers out there. I would suggest if you CAN, save on a couple of fast food meals and use that $ to support a fellow climber by going to his blog and buying one of his films or books. I know I have and as a climber, his book ""9 out of 10 climbers...""  has helped me a lot. Happy New Year fellow climbers and fellow pirates too."
