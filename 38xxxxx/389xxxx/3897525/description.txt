"A Unique insight into climbing at the highest level"

One of the best all round climbers in the world is on a mission - to take rock climbing to new levels of both difficulty and danger. Dave MacLeod attempts to be the first to climb Rhapsody, the hardest traditional rock climb ever and the first to achieve the grade of E11 7a (trad f8c+, US 5.14c).

This film enters uncharted territory, taking you beyond the action it reveals the frustrations and the shear physical and mental effort that goes into climbing at the very highest level. We see MacLeod take a series of terrifying, gut-wrenching falls and the strain begins to show as he struggles to cope with the difficulty and seriousness of the endeavor. With a dogged obsession he keeps returning to his ultimate project - Rhapsody.
