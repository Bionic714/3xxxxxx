,honkytonck,2007-11-28T15:24Z,"hi there, I downloaded the torrent(SafeDisc3.x.ccp), so what do I do know? 
you say ""put it in the profile folder"", how does that work? when in the CloneCD program I tried to select the file 'cd2-MRE_2007-2008_DXv1.img' but the program gives an error by opening (says that the system can't find this file). HOW CAN THIS BE SOLVED?

PS I didn't have any problems burning the Benelux-version (no extra torrents needed there)
thank you in advance for your help!"
,Eotaxin,2007-11-30T11:03Z,"To put the file into the CloneCD profiles folder, simply copy the file, and go to e.g. Program Files->Slysoft->CloneCD->Profiles and paste the file. If you open the CloneCd program, the profile should be there when you want to burn something.

For your other problem, I don't know, are you sure your file 'cd2-MRE_2007-2008_DXv1.img' is in the right location?

If you did not have problems burning the Benelux version, maybe you do need this profile at all? I just posted it because it appeared to help me out after burning a lot of CDs that did not work...

Good luck"
,honkytonck,2007-12-01T00:20Z,"thanks, adding to profile succeeded!
BUT, still no luck with opening the MRE-file :o(
what location are you referring to?
it doesn't matter to what location I unpack the WINRAR-file, or does it?
maybe something wrong with the torrent?

would almost ask you to burn me the freaking cd..."
,Eotaxin,2007-12-01T11:59Z,"I do not know which file you are trying to burn but try this:

Choose the option """"burn from image file"" (or something similar) when the program starts up.

Select the .ccd file (should be in the same folder as your .img file) with CloneCD."
,honkytonck,2007-12-02T10:41Z,"the file is named:
'cd2-MRE_2007-2008_DX v1.ccd'
the other 2 files have the MDF or MDS extention..."
,honkytonck,2007-12-02T22:46Z,"""should be in the same folder as your .img file""?
this is how my folder -after unpacking- looks like"":
- branden met Clone-cd (text-document)
- cd2-MRE_2007-2008_DX v1 (CCD-file)
- cd2-EUR-MRE_2007-2008_DX v1.mdf (mdf-file)
- cd2-EUR-MRE_2007-2008_DX v1.mds (mds-file)

when I use CloneCD it selects the ccd-file and then its says the system can't find that file ...
driving me nuts!

,Eotaxin,2007-12-03T07:44Z,"Honkytonck: I cannot help with you with this, I suggest you google yourself to the solution..."
,honkytonck,2007-12-03T23:48Z,"ok, don't sweat it
I've just bought a perfect copy
so fuck this torrent afterall!"
