Many people experience problems burning CDs with TravelPilot maps for navigators.

You need to burn the CDs with Slysoft CloneCD, that's for sure.

For me, it only works if I use the CloneCD profile of this torrent.

Simply put this file in the CloneCD profile folder and burn the TravelPilot image at 1x speed using this profile.

This profile was originally included in this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3512970/Teleatlas_DX_-_EU_-_Alps_-__BeNeLux_-_Fr_-_ES_-_D_-_Pl_-_Cz_-_Sc

For me, this profile also worked with this torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3743146/Teleatlas_Travelpilot_Benelux_Dx_2007-2008

I cannot say for sure if this will work for you, but it did the job for me, using Sony CD-roms and a Philips burner.

If this file worked for you, please leave your torrent open and help some other people!

Good luck!
