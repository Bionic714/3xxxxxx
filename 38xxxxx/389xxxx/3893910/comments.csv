,druss666uk,2008-04-09T15:53Z,"Okay, here are my thoughts:

I had just downloaded and completed this, and can safely say the tags could have been tagged a bit better. There is a brilliant tagging program called Musicbrainz Picard which tags files from their own database. It's free and offensively easy to use, so check it out.

Second of all, please include information such as the bitrate of the songs. For this collection, it averages around 128 and 160 for a lot of the tracks which is fine. But some tracks plummet below this threshold, resulting in poor playback. If you ripped these files yourself, please go into whatever program you use and see about increasing the bitrate.

Besides these nitpicks, you have provided a great torrent. Thanks! :D"
