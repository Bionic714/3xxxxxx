Rip Notes

THREE'S A CROWD - Gotcha CD 3

Last year Matt Tilley's Gotcha CD raised over $200,000 for the Royal Woman's Hospital, the year before it was the same for the Mercy Hospital for women..this year, the Fox is spreading the love and giving back to the community that got us to Number 1 again!

If you're a charity, community group or worthy club, NO MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL, we want to hear from you! Simply register the details of you and your organisation below. Tell us how much cash you need and what you need it for?and before you know it, Matt and Jo and the new Gotcha CD could be coming to the rescue.

We'll be selecting stacks of organisations and dishing out the proceeds from the sales before the year is out (Matt and Jo are already counting the sleeps til Christmas!).

The new brand new DOUBLE CD "Three's a crowd" is ready to roll and will be in stores November 10. The more you buy, the more you could get back.(The director of marketing made us put this naff slogan in?)
