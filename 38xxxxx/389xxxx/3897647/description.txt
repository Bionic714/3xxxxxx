This version of the Four Seasons (with some other concertos) is for any who even likes to listen to music, much less of the classical genre. The London Philharmonic complement Itzhak Perlman splendidly.

Everybody knows "The Four Seasons". Spring is one of the best known classical pieces of all times. Perlman's playing is lovely and the music is superb and famous for a reason, but it is my personal opinion that what is truly wonderful here is the small selection of violin concertos.

These concertos are rather well known to those who are knowledgable in classical music or play an instrument (violin, in this case). To the rest of the world they are much less known, and that is a pity. These are wonderful pieces of music, played incredibly with great sound.
