The Impossibles
(Never) Say Goodbye - DVD
FBR055

The Impossibles' (Never) Say Goodbye DVD is an incredible DVD with 55 minutes of footage from the Impossibles' final show at Emo's in Austin, Texas. It also features 24 minutes of interviews with Gabe, Rory and Craig about the history of the band as well as some old videos. There's even a commentary option with Rory and Gabe. The DVD almost never happened when last fall, the hard drive which stored all the footage crashed. The footage was nearly destroyed, but was barely saved by an outside data recovery team.
