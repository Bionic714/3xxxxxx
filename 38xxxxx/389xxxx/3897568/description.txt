Review
=======
Sounds from some alien swamp then a very slow bass sequence provide quite a tranquil start to the title track. Gorgeous mellotron adds to the peaceful scene. At first it is just in the background but it isn't long before it takes lead duties. It reminded me a little of some of Edgar Froese's earlier solo work. In the fifth minute we descend to cosmic twitterings out of which emerges a rapid high register sequence, more tron and bass pulses. A second rather tasty sequence joins in, then a third, creating pure Berlin school heaven. They are cranked up, increasing the excitement all the time. Now Edgar never quite gave it this much oomph! Indeed we are probably entering AirSculpture at their most aggressive or even Redshift proportions. In the fourteenth minute the sequences all seem to change pattern, the transition accomplished masterfully, keeping the interest high. Indeed nothing here ever outstays its welcome. We finish with the finest mid 70s style Tangerine Dream atmospherics. A fantastic opener.
'Radiant Transmission' is initially all rather dark with deep rumbles and windy effects. Out of this the heaviest sequence so far emerges (very Rubycon / Arcturus) which continues its devastating progression becoming more powerful by the second accompanied by yet more mellotron. Yes, it's the classic formula but it doesn't get done any better than this. Lead stabs add even more aggression. The mellotron swells trying to sooth the feverish wall of pulsations but all it does is create a backing over which the barrage of notes seem even more effective. A mournful virtual guitar lead adds a moodiness to proceedings. In the seventeenth minute the sequences submerge under a sea of bubbling, twittering, sighing atmospherics with crashing percussives and half heard vocal chatter (yet again sticking to the tradition of a mid track break). And true to form a couple of minutes later another slow but mean sequence growls into being, a more rapid one bouncing away lower in the mix. Lovely flutey synth plays over the top. 

'Phosphor Skyline' starts all ethereal and well spaced out. All very fine it is too but the 'tone' of the album has already been set so you know it is just a matter of time before the sequence arrives. When it does it takes moodiness to new levels. If ever there was a grumpy teenager of a sequence this is it! Flute gives a melancholy edge whilst a faster more positive sequence darts around underneath like some pesky little brother. We get another atmospheric interlude full of attitude then the sequences return once more bringing a few friends with them. Even though this is quite heavy sequencing there is still a subtlety that works very well. Surprisingly the track concludes with a very pleasant piano solo. We finish with the rather short 'Torque' which takes us back to the deepest and spookiest realms of the galaxy complete with TD type half vocal twitters. For Berlin School fans this will probably be one of the favourite releases of 2007. (DL)
