,black francis,2011-04-10T16:47Z,"You need DosBox for these games. Download it and run it. Type Intro or Help in the prompt and the instructions on how to get it to work are there. It's quite easy. I recommend making a folder on c:\ called games or dos or something like that. Then you can just mount c c:\games and then type c: and you're in the folder where you have hopefully placed your games. Dosbox emulates soundblaster sound cards (soundblaster, soundblaster pro and sb16) so you will get all the original audio as well."
