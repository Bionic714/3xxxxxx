In the brutal World War II Battle of Saipan, Marines Joe Enders and Ox Anderson are assigned to protect Navajo American codetalkers Ben Yahzee and Charlie Whitehorse. Trained to use a secret military code based on their native language, it was the only one never broken by the Japanese and was key to winning the war in the Pacific. The Marines' mission was "to protect the code at all costs" but as the bonds of war are forged, how far will they go to stop the code falling into the enemies hands...
