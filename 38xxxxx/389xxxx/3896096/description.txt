Chess-7 v2.0 | 3 MB

Chess is the most exciting, ancient and popular board game in the world. With the help of the program "Chess-7" you can play chess both with the computer and a human partner, analyse chess positions, and solve chess problems. You can widely change the appearance of the program window. And of course we paid special attention to the appearance of the board itself and the chess pieces: the program supports skin add-ins by their simple addition to the program catalog. You can use in-built skins or create your own ones.
