Correspondent Dominic Cunningham-Reid speaks with diamond miners in the West African nation of Sierra Leone, a country emerging from a ten-year civil war. A serendipitous product of the enormous heat and pressure exerted upon graphite deep beneath the earth, diamonds are the world\'s most sought-after stone. Despite their role as an international symbol of love and affection, diamonds have financed the brutal civil war in Sierra Leone and other African countries.

Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Diamonds are not really a commodity like gold or silver,Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ a leading New York dealer explained one day. Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½You wonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t buy a stone from a jeweler and then sell it back to him for the same priceÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½heÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s not going to give up his profit. But they are definitely the easiest way to move value around. I know a guy who had to leave Iran at a momentÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s notice during the revolution there. No time to sell his house or get to the bank, but he had time to pick up 30 million dollarsÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ worth of diamonds and walk away.Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ 

Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½They are a form of currency,Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ remarked Mark van Bockstael of the Diamond High Council in Antwerp. Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½They back international loans, pay debts, pay bribes, buy arms. In many cases they are better than money.Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ Monrovia, capital of Liberia, for example, is known as a mecca for money launderers seeking to turn questionable cash assets into diamonds that can then be easily moved and sold elsewhere. There have been unconfirmed reports that Osama bin LadenÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s terrorist organization, al Qaeda, made use of this operation. 

As van Bockstael expounded on his favorite subject, we were strolling to lunch from his office in the cityÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s diamond district, the heart of the worldÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s diamond bazaar. Eighty percent of the worldÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s rough gem-quality diamonds are traded every year along three short streets next to the Antwerp railroad station. The Antwerp district has extensions in many cities: West 47th Street in New York, LondonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s Hatton Garden, the high-rise offices of Ramat Gan in Tel Aviv, not to mention the Opera House district in Mumbai (Bombay) and the other Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½diamond citiesÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ of India, where, in a union of modern technology and cheap labor, 800,000 workers craft stones weighing a fraction of a carat into polished gems. Each of these business centers revolves around personal contact and connections, thrives on rumor and gossip, and cherishes secrecy. Multimillion-dollar deals are clinched with a handshake and the word mazal, Hebrew for Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½good luck.Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½So many secrets,Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ sighed van Bockstael as we skipped to avoid a cyclist in a long black coat and a broad, flat, fur-trimmed hat. Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Nothing is what it seems in the diamond business, and half the time you donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t even know if thatÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s true.Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½
