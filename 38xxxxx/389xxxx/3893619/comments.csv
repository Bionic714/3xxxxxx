,azerbadjan,2007-11-15T19:43Z,"I see 5 peers and me as a seed on the tracker, but no seeders or leechers in the statistics on this page... 
But don't worry, I'll be seeding this for a week, then you guys can take over :)"
,azerbadjan,2007-11-23T14:02Z,"well. I hope you guys can take over the seeding now, since I'll quit seeding..."
,Jadus,2008-01-24T14:17Z,Anybody here?
,Ssschhhh,2008-03-05T20:13Z,Holy fucking shit! Thanks!!
,Ssschhhh,2008-03-10T16:33Z,I wonder why nobody seems to be able to reach that one seeder.. We're all stuck at 96.8%.
,Ssschhhh,2008-03-12T21:21Z,"Well, this was a complete waste of time... The video has a very low bitrate, and a frame-per-second of only 15. The result is nearly unwatchable, and an audio track of only 22kHz doesn't really help either."
,bkzland,2008-08-20T14:28Z,"In case anyone still needs it, I'll join the seeding.
The movie is in awful quality, as Ssschhhh pointed out, but I like it anyhoo. "
