Description:	

Tapping the energy of the contemporary club scene and plugging into the wired-up world of smart technology, this selection of music-based shorts collides the raw look of film with the frenetic sample-aesthetic of digital multimedia.

From lo-fi to sci-fi, through cyberdelia and cyberpunk, this follow-up to FUZZY LOGIC showcases some of the most stylish new work on the international scene, including contributions from ambient 'imagemeister' George Barber, design group tomato, Eric Saks' sardonic and unnerving short narrative TOUCH TONE, plus promo-related material from Stakker/Aphex Twin, Subterrain/Tortoise and others
