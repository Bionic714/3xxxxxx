,kurkosdr,2010-05-15T22:59Z,"- MANY THANKS TO THE UPLOADER!

This torrent contains the original DOOM II game (full windows version), plus Ultimate DOOM, which is the original DOOM I game with an extra episode. 
All you have to do is download the ""Doom Install.rar"" file (the other rar files are extras, so they are not neccessary)

Some tips:

- HOW TO RUN UNDER XP/VISTA:

There are lot's of people out there asking how to run this game inder XP/Vista. So here is your step-by-step guide:

1. If you get a ""DPLAY.DLL not found"" error, it's because you don't have DirectPlay in your pc (the geniuses at microsoft removed it from Vista and some XP versions). So go and get DPLAY.DLL from here: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?dplay
Then copy and paste it in your C:\Windows\System folder.

2. Sometimes, Windows will block it (for no reason whatsoever), so after you copy and paste it, right click on DPLAY.DLL -> ""Properties"" and click on ""Unban"".

3. Now you can play the game. But before you click ""New game"", don't forget to go to ""Advanced..."" -> ""Screen Resolution"" and set it to 640x480 to make it fit your screen better.

- HOW TO LOAD SAVED GAMES:

Since Norvine and RebelScum001 asked, here is how to load savegames

1. Before you click on ""New game"", go to ""Advanced..."" --> Select the one you want --> OK. Then click ""New game"""

,Frankist,2011-03-19T16:28Z,"Remember, if you are playing a pirated version of DOOM II you are going to HELL."
,kithylin,2011-04-04T04:14Z,"THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL MS-DOS VERSION, ANOTHER 'WINDOOM' VERSION.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE ORIGINAL MS-DOS VERSION DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!"
,reactii0n,2011-06-30T04:45Z,Am I the only one in 4 years to point out Doom wasn't the first FPS?
,StarFkr,2011-08-09T09:41Z,"@reactii0n, I was just about to mention that haha!  Some would say Wolfenstein 3D was the first but its not either.  It's IDs first first person shooter.

The ""first"" first person shooter actually goes to Mars Wars which dates back to the 70's :D"
,Lunacy666,2011-11-17T14:21Z,"Kickass games, thanks for the upload!

Btw, the first real fps game was Catacomb 3-D, then Wolfenstein 3-D and then Doom :)"
,mw2pro123,2012-01-25T12:39Z,"This is the ONLY torrent that contains the full Final Doom, thanks so much!"
,Bradz00,2012-01-31T02:56Z,"Anyone know how I can get a LAN Multiplayer to work, when I click on Winstock TCP Connection for Direct play it has an error message of “Das gick inte att ladda DirectPlay-tjansten C:\Window\system32\dpwsock.dll” and when I click new game it says “The instruction at 10005df5 referenced memory at 00000000. The memory could not be read from. Click ok to terminate application”… the computers are connected and everything but I can’t get it to work, thanks in advance."
