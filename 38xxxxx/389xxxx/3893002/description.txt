Implacable is a brutal DOOM death metal band hailing from western Norway, haunting the underground with low frequency noises since 1995, contrasting the subsonic death metal grind and downtuned guitars distorted beyond redemption with soaring organs and angelic female vocals.



This release is made and supported 100% by the band, please support underground DOOM metal by distributing it as much as possible, download our other releases and get your bones massaged by attending our concerts!

The recording was done from a dv-camera on a tripod, audio leeched from the mixer. Please don't expect blemish free "pro-quality", we are not rich enough to cheat.
The at times blurry image is caused by the entire venue trembling from the sound of the deep B of DOOM.
