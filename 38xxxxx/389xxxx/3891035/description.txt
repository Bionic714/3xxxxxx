Amateur suburban stunt man Rod Kimble (Andy Samberg) believes he?s destined to follow in the footsteps of his late father, who made test runs of Evel Knievel?s stunts before the better-known daredevil repeated them and took all the glory. Kimble risks life and limb strictly for fun and the entertainment of the neighborhood kids, but when his macho stepfather, Frank (Ian McShane)--who repeatedly beats and belittles Rod in basement sparring matches--develops a life-threatening heart ailment, Rod attempts the biggest jump of his career to raise the $50,000 necessary to get Frank a heart transplant so that he can have one last chance to fight Frank and prove his manhood.

Cast: Andy Samberg, Isla Fisher, Sissy Spacek, Will Arnett, Ian McShane.
