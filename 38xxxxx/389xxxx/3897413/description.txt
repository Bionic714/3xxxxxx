These are 10 books by Anarcho-Capitalist Murray Rothbard on Libertarianism, Ethics, Monetary Policy, etc. You may check them out of you are interested in such stuff.

This is not my collection. I DL'ed them from the now offline Demonoid. The books are freely available at http://mises.org

PS: This is my first torrent, so please pardon if you face any problems.

Cheers!
