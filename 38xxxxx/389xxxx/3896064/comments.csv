,cory420,2007-11-17T13:58Z,thanks a lot for this shit been trying to find all week you da man stealth195
,YourSpleen,2007-11-17T17:06Z,"Yes, I am desperately looking for the actual text, either PDF, LIT, or whatever.  If you see it, can you please upload it!

Thanks for this though, stealth, I am excited to read the end of this series. ;)"
,stealth195,2007-11-17T21:43Z,Thanks for your comments. I'm also looking for text version and will upload as soon as I find it. The trouble is Terry Goodkinds' Sword of Truth series isn't quite as popular as Harry potter. I do hope we don't have to wait to long though
,tobis986,2007-11-17T22:55Z,Anyone got # 10?
,stealth195,2007-11-18T02:45Z,Please keep seeding to a ratio of 1.0 or more. That is how the bittorrent works
,jpinks,2007-11-18T19:20Z,Whats the quality on this after reducing it that much?  
,stealth195,2007-11-18T21:10Z,The quality is exactly the same. I just deleted a second set of files in a different format.

,Relanor,2007-12-03T15:21Z,Does anyone know of any sites where I can find the text like the one above for book 10 for all of the other books?

,Relanor,2007-12-04T14:17Z,"Sorry Stealth, I don't think I was clear with my first post.  I am actually looking for a site or a text doc that has the other books.  All of the e-books I have found so far are missing parts, the site listed for book 10 seems complete. 

I would like to see something similar for books 1-9 + book 11 in text "
,stealth195,2007-12-06T02:22Z,"Sorry about that Relanor here is what your looking for. I'm still reading confessor when I get the chance. I want to savor it cos it's the last onehttp://thepiratebay.org/tor/3903789/Terry_Goodkind_-_Sword_of_Truth_(all_11_ebooks)
