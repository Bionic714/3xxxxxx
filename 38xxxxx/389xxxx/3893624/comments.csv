Ron Paul not only takes money from white supremacist groups, but seems to have no problem with it. Why are you fucking morons still supporting the shithead? HE IS A BIGOT!

I stand by my statement- if Ron Paul is elected president, I will move to Israel."

Ron Paul has more minority support than ANY other GOP candidate because his message speaks truth to all people. He is also the only candidate on either side willing to end the Federal ""War on Drugs"" which actually creates more crime and disproportionately affects black and hispanic communities. 

> Ron Paul not only takes money from white supremacist groups

First off Ron Paul only takes money from individuals. He wouldn't allow any ""group"" or company to influence him. There was 1 (ONE) $500 donation of questionable origin from Florida. It was pointed out to him weeks later and he was asked if he would give it back. His answer was if this person is so bad, how would giving it back be good? He puts it towards his campaign of Freedom, Peace and Prosperity and the bad-guy loses.
