      |      Jesse Aarons trained all summer to become the fastest       |
      |       runner in school, so he's very upset when newcomer         |
      |       Leslie Burke outruns him and everyone else. Despite        |
      |     this and other differences, including that she's rich,       |
      |      he's poor, and she's a city girl, he's a country boy,       |

      |       Terabithia, a land of monsters, trolls, ogres, and         |
      |       giants and rule as king and queen. This friendship         |
      |     helps Jess cope with the tragedy that makes him realize      |
