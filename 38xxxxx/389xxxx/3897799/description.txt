Attack Of the Gryphon 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494206/

This is a conversion of http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3864934/Attack.Of.The.Gryphon.2007.STV.PAL.DVDR-LoRD
Essentially I unpacked the .rar file. 

Then unpacked the .img file.

Then converted from PAL to NTSC, all for a savings to you of many hours and several gigabytes.

As you can see from the data below, we still have a good dvd bitrate at about 30% the size. English only. No menus, subtitles or other languages. Just burn it and play.

It's up to you folks to seed. I'm off after the first few seeder's are generated.
Enjoy!
