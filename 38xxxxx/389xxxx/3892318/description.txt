This is the American version for Playstation 2.  The music is from the Japanese version Sparking! METEOR.  The music has been remastered using the BGM Collection, the 5 disc set,plus a few extra songs including ANIMETAL covers that may or may not play during the game.  The opening movie now has the japanese lyrics restored.  Enjoy!
