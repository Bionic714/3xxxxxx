Guitar Pro is a multitrack tablature editor for guitar, banjo and bass. Besides writing scores, Guitar Pro is a complete tool for young and accomplished guitarists alike to progress, compose, or simply accompany themselves.

Features of Guitar Pro:
- A Powerfull, Simple and Intuitive Editor. Guitar Pro allows you to create whole scores for guitar, bass or other stringed instruments in a few minutes.
- View and Listen to your Tablatures. Far more than a simple editor, Guitar Pro allows you to view and listen to a score under the best conditions.
- A Complete Workshop for the Guitarist. Guitar Pro includes many tools for the guitarist such as the chord diagram generator, the guitar tuner, the metronome, the scale tool or the fretboard...
- Import, Export and Share! Import and export MIDI and ASCII format, and enjoy the tens of thousands of tablatures available on the Internet in Guitar Pro format.
