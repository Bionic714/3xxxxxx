Peace"
,samsaatana,2008-02-10T12:47Z,"Thank you all, this is just great!"
,morphman86,2008-02-10T20:34Z,"WTF is up with that .rar? First, you've deleted the ending, so I (the downloader) have to manually type in .rar, then I find out that the .rar has a .ZIP with the files in it, along with a bunch of french crap, that has NOTHING to do with guitar pro.

BTW, what's up with that french dude talking to a webcam for like 20 minutes on the .avi-file?

Next time, just include the .zip...."

,maddnezzsszz,2009-10-03T21:59Z,"For those who don't know how to open this: 
go to the guitar pro file, right click on it, and if u have rar installed it should say something like extract (I have the dutch version so that's what it says in  my language) After doing that, u should be able to follow the regular rar procedure, piece of cake :) 
Great torrent dude, but maybe a little bit more convenient if u'd uploaded the rar file itself. Other than that: thnx, been looking 4 this 4 ages!!"
,aGHATORSfan,2009-10-17T05:09Z,"It's really easy Willgirzim, just right click it and open it with winrar, if you don't have winrar a quick search at google may help you acquiring it.
If you need more help my msn is ariel_harrier@hotmail.com"
