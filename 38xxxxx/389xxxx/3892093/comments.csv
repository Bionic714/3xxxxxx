,xcunik,2009-04-17T13:32Z,rar file? wtf..
,eveyd,2011-10-21T16:00Z,"rar is a zip file
i prefer rars over loose files 
only problem is rip quality of these songs which is pretty low - on my good speakers i hear alot of snapping, pops and crackles, which makes it unlistenable for me - but thanks for trying"
