,smurfix,2007-11-28T09:59Z,Seed please (for 1-5-combined)!
,FuckYourReligion,2007-11-28T11:23Z,"I believe the seeder counter is incorrect; I know for a fact there is more than 1 seeder. We have relaxed the security settings on our network to support a broader scope of connections, this should alleviate any problems you may be having in connecting to our IP (216.128.88.40) to obtain the files in this torrent."
,LinguaIgnota,2007-12-21T00:51Z,Awesome upload. Thank you very much.
,JebusKryst,2007-12-21T17:13Z,"This is great. I will seed this until my uplload ratio is x10, then someone else can take the batten"
,radio0o,2008-01-08T00:16Z,"Thanks for the torrent but to all those curious about this I'd suggest not wasting your time. Richard Dawkins is a pedant and seems to have some sort of agenda in every work he does. He seems to be more interested in convincing you of something than he is of informing you. This is not what the job of a ""scientist"" is. Avoid this man's work and keep yourself from losing IQ points."
,Orcos,2008-01-12T21:12Z,Dawkins is a formidable scientist and an excellent educator.  These lectures are fascinating and vivid.  Thanks for the up.

and by coincidence, you are a creationist? or worse you believe in ID?"

What sort of negative agenda could there be in teaching people about evolution? This isn't one of his works on religion, and it happens to be one of the most informative sets of videos one can watch on the topic. 
ps i bet youre a creationist lol"
,nsofast,2008-04-08T03:49Z,"if your a creationist like radio0o, and you would very much like to remain a creationist, you would do well to avoid reason and brilliant men like dawkins "

,amberfail,2008-06-10T12:31Z,"Thank you so much for this upload.

This is the most fascinating and interesting educational material I've ever seen. Richard Dawkins is truly brilliant.
To anyone wondering whether to download this or not; by all means do. Dawkins manages to convey his knowledge in a way so anyone - and I hold myself as a benchmark for ""anyone"", seeing as I'm a middle school student genuinely uninterested in most scientific subjects, and I still find these lectures extraordinarily captivating - can easily understand it. There are no long, unintelligible Latin names, no complicated splitting apart atoms and unreasonably difficult-to-understand physical terms; in short, these lectures easily appeal to even the relatively ignorant viewer with little to no previous knowledge, and I believe that's an accomplishment of dimensions.

I recommend watching this as early on in your life as possible. Don't let the fact that it's educational or ""nerdy"" scare you off. It is by no means boring. In fact, it's quite the contrary. It's vivid, captivating, easy to sit through, and almost child-friendly. It's the kind of thing that you just don't want to end, and - lest we forget - it does the perhaps most important thing in the world: It makes you smart, gives you new knowledge. If that doesn't make it worth watching for you, I don't know what will."
,roscopp,2008-06-30T16:34Z,Thanks a lot for this.  Recommend this to everyone.
,roscopp,2008-06-30T16:40Z,"Radio0o, thankfully we don't live in a world where scientists can't have opinions.  We need more people like Dawkins to stop people so easily swallowing the bullshit.  Im not saying he's always right but if you prove him wrong on something im sure he would be glad.  Now that is a scientist"
,Switch756,2008-07-07T08:57Z,"Science is interesting, and if you don't think so you can fuck off.  This torrent is amazing btw.  

The hard work of one person, in this case FuckYourReligion for making this torrent, has done more than every prayer ever given, ever.  Then again, prayer doesn't do anything so it's quite easy to out-do in comparison...but I'm at least glad we have people on this earth willing to do the hard work. Thanks again for this torrent."

,raphao,2008-08-03T16:28Z,"somebody have the subtitles? 
it could be in english"
,donpedro,2008-08-09T19:11Z,This should be mandatory to watch in all public schools.
,mogto,2008-08-23T13:34Z,"""Richard Dawkins is a pedant and seems to have some sort of agenda in every work he does.""

That agenda is, of course, teaching people about natural selection, and just how powerful the idea of evolution is.  And as ""professor for the public understanding of science"", it's his job.

By the way, this is the freely available ""online version"" - 320x240, H.264 - and not a DVD rip.  Still great, but just to let everyone know the resolution is a bit lower.

Many thanks to the uploader and the seeders.  (It downloaded at about five times the officially rated speed of my connection!)"
,mogto,2008-08-23T13:39Z,"raphao:

There's a transcript here: http://richarddawkins.net/GUITUtranscript

Maybe that can help.  Or if you buy the DVDs, they have subtitles."
,kr0niXzX,2008-09-30T05:22Z,"THanks for the torrent, truly excellent subject."
,Cain303,2008-11-30T22:02Z,Good stuff!
,GodOfFuXXX,2009-01-01T02:02Z,"Anything to prove single deity religions lie is fine by me. This and many videos like this continue to prove evolution is fact and not just an idea. Now if we could just get this and education, intelligence wasn't taught to be looked down upon and feared by major religions we would be a better society."
,atheistmafia,2009-02-25T06:30Z,Outstanding...thank you!

,bubbabead,2009-12-27T14:43Z,"Very interesting series

Thankyou a lot"
,Peterc340,2010-01-06T18:17Z,"I was never a believer and I always thought people who huddled into churches were missing the entire truth of the matter. 

However, after listening to Richard Dawkins' audio books, as well as many others, it becomes clear just how DANGEROUS religion is to our continued survival and progress as a species. 

I'm shocked at how many people fall for this supernatural garbage, even in the face of all the huge, steaming, stinking piles of NO EVIDENCE!

Thanks FuckYourReligion for this series! I thank my non-existent God for people like you that have thought this through enough to stop worshipping thin air.

Here's some more good stuff I've found on TPB (and elsewhere) to download on this topic:
Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion (audio book and PDF)
Christopher Hitchens - God is Not Great (audio book and PDF)
Sam Harris - The End of Faith (audio book)
Craig Winn - Prophet of Doom (audio book)
Michael Shermer - Why People Believe Weird Things (4-part audio series)

Keep the [lack of] faith!"
,dubblue,2010-08-27T20:29Z,"Superb. One of the best downloads on The Pirate Bay. Everyone should see this, and understand what total rubbish religion really is. Richard Dawkins has the ability to put into simple reading/audio material what most of us are really thinking, but don't know how to express. More of this please."
