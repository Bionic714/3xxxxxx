,daddyg74,2007-12-12T01:20Z,Wicked Collection!!! Pretty darn thorough
,blue squad,2008-01-08T19:46Z,nice i don't have alot of these thanks 
,johnheesen,2008-02-11T13:01Z,"Thanks, keep up the good work."
,DenialTwist,2008-02-17T21:35Z,"would've been nice to have the artist's  names in the torrent, too. only the song titles, which was confusing. i didn't want to download them all, but had a difficult time selecting which was what and i just gave up. cool song list, though."
,jimmie9,2008-02-21T09:23Z,"I love the free tunes and I'm not one that usually complains, because free is free...but damn, you go through the trouble to upload a libray like this, take the time to list the artist's names. I tried to go through this torrent 3 times, but in the end it was way to frustrating. I give you credit for an amzing library of tunes, but very poor oranization."
,xpd259,2008-03-01T19:04Z,"fantastic collection I think i have the same cd collection this is from
but an interesting serial number on each of the tracks in the mp3 tag that needs removing to make this a perfect torrent"

,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-04-14T22:31Z,Explain how I got this collection when searching 'Bone Thugs 'N' Harmony' because im thinking wtf...
,DenialTwist,2008-04-15T02:50Z,"LOL. Because a Bone Thugz n harmony song is in the freaking list. THINK, MCFLY, THINK."
,haft01,2008-04-24T08:58Z,This a great list. I lost a lot of music in a flood and I'm trying to find some albums. Like the bands on this list. (The Ass Ponys and The Rentals). Any of their early stuff (Albums). Does anyone know where I can find any of these albums? I have spent a lot of time and money trying to get my collection back. Any help would be great. 
,wag_kang_aalon,2008-05-06T05:45Z,is there a way to just get SOME tracks?
,petnorth,2008-05-08T19:21Z,C&C Music Factory's 'Everybody Dance Now's correct title is actually 'Gonna Make You Sweat'
,Xenon4U2C,2008-07-05T03:31Z,"If you liked this, then you might like mine as well.

,machiavelus,2008-07-08T17:49Z,this is nothing without tupac shakur
,gustavojr,2008-07-26T05:24Z,"I was in high school in the 90's, now thanxz to you i will know better those great artist, excelent work, you can't get that collection not even on billboard cds, 
Please don't complaint about this torrent, just look for any other free stuff of your convenience.
Thank you theemotron, latinos are seeding too..."
,xebby,2008-08-03T21:08Z,"excellent excellent job! Thanks for the effort theemotron! 

and just the fact alone that you have King Missile - Detachable Penis on here makes this a great torrent lol"
,tikkig0d,2008-10-23T01:51Z,tak theemotron :)
,TheWutt,2008-11-04T07:07Z,"this shows up when you search for ""dog sex"", what the fuck? shitz whack. there's no porn here..."
,Randombass,2008-11-05T20:40Z,"Damnit, love this! thanx"
,kellypi,2008-11-09T06:51Z,"definitely badly organized. i wanted one cd and there is no listing even by band. just by song name. nice attempt. and thanks for that, but this is useless to me and probably to most users

thanks for the upload, but i dont have the bandwidth to download it for a few cd's"
,debakaputite,2008-11-23T01:27Z,"To:  kellypi at 2008-11-09 06:51 CET
-------
Listen idiot, you are the stupidest cunt I have ever seen. I know it's not much :) but you reeeeallllly are dumb, get it?? 
Poor guy , not bandwidth, he wants one CD .... I will cry for you. 
There is a wonderfull compilation, alphabetic list and stuff , all the groups like Queen and U2 are here... what the fuck are u moaning about ?!?!
Oohh I forgot ,because u are stupid cunt :)
All other guys over there - cheers."
,Hal440,2008-12-06T14:46Z,"kellypi- you are definitely an idiot on many levels, you do not know how to use what i would consider basic features of windows. it would take you roughly 1 minute to sort all the 'problems' you speak of."
,jake3261,2008-12-20T01:10Z,"uhm, regarding TheWutt's comment, all i have to ask, is why are you searching for that in the first place?!!?!?!?!?!?"
,mrmojorisin365,2008-12-24T04:06Z,"Looks like an amazing collection.  Thanks for the upload.  If you could organize the mp3 file names so it was easier to sort through, it'd be just about perfect."
,Frisky_Dingo_666,2008-12-29T04:22Z,A nice compilation that represents hours of hard work. This is greatly appreciated. Exactly what I was looking for. Many Thanks...
,FaugYou,2009-01-01T22:28Z,Dude??? Thanks for the upload but why the hell did u go to all the trouble to organize the description and then just leave all the file names as title.mp3 instead of artist - title.mp3 shit u should change ur name to theemoron
,NRchist,2009-02-04T04:55Z,">>misterjag
thats very interesting"
,cjhard,2009-02-12T07:45Z,"A 90s collection with no mention of Back Street Boys, Vengaboys, Spice Girls OR S Club 7? I know they're all shit, but that's what most people remember about 90's pop. Mecarena isn't even in this shit. FAIL"
,ParadoxBoy,2009-03-19T12:27Z,"terrific collection, but quite hard to pick what you want out of it; try renaming stuff by artist then reupload the whole thing."
,Fig-Neutron,2009-05-30T04:11Z,"Awesome collection.  For those that want Artist in filename, if you have Tag and Rename (gee, where could you get that?):  

You can rename files - just choose [Artist Tag] - [Title Tag] and voila!"
,davinximode,2009-06-08T15:07Z,having a time machine nowadays may be impossible i guess this might help :)
,mad.hag,2009-06-08T17:43Z,"Great Collection, thanks. My only criticism is that the artisis are not labelled - but thats no biggy."
,phobos258,2009-06-23T17:36Z,Nice collection. Good Variety.. however it does need to be better named. and tag and rename only does it to the properly tagged tracks... had to rename like 20 after tag and rename did its thing. also there are too many songs with jitter.. at least 15 songs so far i have deleted because of it. i should have stated a list.
,SiyoTheMadFox,2009-07-24T16:31Z,"Woooooooooooooow, talk about a shit pile. I was excited at first. I was gunna cancel half this shit but still, I would have downloaded, but then, when I went to cancel artists and albums in Utorrent I noticed the fatal flaw to this: 2FUCKING GIGABYTES OF UNSORTED MUSIC! NOT EVEN PUT UNDER FILES TO DISCERN ARTIST! OMG! Nice try though. Try to reupload with a little organization to it. Then I'll download."
,smartcliff,2009-08-04T14:51Z,dude thank you i cant thank you enough this is the best music torrent i have ever downloaded so far and trust me i downloaded countless torrents...dnt listen to all the h8ters...this is orginized to me the artist are there and the titles are there idk what is every1 is complaining about...i fckn love the 90s u made my day
,partykiddie,2009-08-05T17:45Z,"Screw what the others said! this collection is going straight into my 2 gb iPod :D perfect size, perfect sorted :) Ty alot bro :D"
,DjMarkie,2011-06-07T08:31Z,"Great collection of tunes. And a big ass Thank You to Fig, had you not mentioned that prog I would have spent a lot of time renaming all of this awesome music. "
