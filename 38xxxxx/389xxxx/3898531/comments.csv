,thingnblah,2008-09-19T06:24Z,Thank you for the upload but please title the torrent correctly in the future.The first 6 episodes are .WMV and 11 and 12 are .rar.  If you are going to title your torrent with the words .Xvid please make sure all of your files are Xvid.  The .rar is almost half understandable but the .WMV is ridiculous when the torrent is titled .Xvid.
