> A makeshift prison is set up in a research lab, complete with cells, 
> bars and surveillance cameras. For two weeks 20 male participants are 
> hired to play prisoners and guards. The 'prisoners' are locked up and 
> have to follow seemingly mild rules, and the 'guards' are told simply 
> to retain order without using physical violence. Everybody is free to 
> quit at any time, thereby forfeiting payment. In the beginning the mood 
> between both groups is insecure and rather emphatic. But soon quarrels 
> arise and the wardens employ ever more drastic sanctions to confirm their 
> authority.
