[V],Subzero!,2008-01-11T21:15Z,use esc!... and make sure you have all gamepads unplugged!... otherwise the game wont work!.
,kris1213,2008-02-03T00:53Z,"Well, i got this downloaded, and now i want to know how to start installing this ;s ? It says in the Ceasar fil that i need to run a start.exe, but i don't got such a exe fil :s ?"
[V],Subzero!,2008-02-06T04:52Z,"you cant see file extensions, because theyre de-activate on you windows (seems so!), anyways, look out for a red/white ball icon, and click this twice... "
[V],Subzero!,2008-02-06T04:55Z,"ahh possible your virustools detected this file as virus, but its a false positive , you can see in other descriptions of my uploads... in case your virustool has removed this, you need to un-rar the whole thing again, and this time you de-activate your virustool, dont worry, there is nothing which can affect your pc!..."
,MiGhtyF,2008-02-23T00:02Z,"hey iam downing this but can u pls give some more info about the game?

,Ruostepoika,2008-09-29T18:22Z,"Umm... I have a question. English is not my primary language, so i don't quite understand what a joypad is (...requires a joypad with at least 6 available buttons...), nor do i understand how to get past the first screen with ""Please press start to *something*"" Please answer as soon as possible. "
,Ruostepoika,2008-09-29T18:25Z,"If joypad is something you have to buy, you should have mentioned before, not in the readme..."

,tropicvibe,2009-10-11T15:46Z,"I have the original copy of this game but never worked with my mouse and the keyboard would just freeze after the 1st level. I believe a gamepad or joystick is required to play the game. I just been too lazy to go and buy one, lol"
