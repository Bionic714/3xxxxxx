DEAR MUSIC LOVERS,

This mixed music cd is one of my MIXAMIX series.
This cds are made mainly as road music but some of them can be easily used for parties.
I make this cds to accompany me and my friends at car or excursions.

The motive for making these cds was the fact that I could not find a radio station 
playing the music I like without interuptions. So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.
I like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not many djs in the world. 
Till now only Paul Oakenfold , Daniel Davoli and a few more 
have managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.

Anyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.
Remember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.
The date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. 
The creation may take from just one day to many months.

A few words about MIXAMIX 20071008

Dear music and trip lovers. 
This time I am proud to give you a real road mix. It's been a month since I started it but I believe it really worths it.
I 've done many alpha and betas versions road tests to come up with this final. I have worked every single transition for hours 
and I have come to create many of my own unique mixes reviving some old tracks.
Hear for example Apoptygma Berzerk - Mourn (Mesh Remix) combined with Insomnia tune and wonder why was is not like this from the beginning.
Bronski Beat - Smalltown Boy is lived up with new fresh beat.Knack - My Sharona too. 
Try to detect what is the quitar sample I used under VnV Nation's - Beloved. 
Also as you can see from the selection this mix has a great deal of rock sound and with this I hope I satisfy some of the 
friends that contacted me and asked for more this. Of course being loyal to my music style I have a little bit of everything as always!
Come by my site rate my mixes and leave a comment if you want. Hope you will enjoy this as much as I do. 

	Keep travelling, sharing music and have fun!
