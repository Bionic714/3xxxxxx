I only stopped because of the lack of free space I have on my Hard Drives, because this one deserve to be seeded more and more you are right ! I had to shrink the 2nd DVD, so I can only continue with the first DVD. All the DVD of your collection will be greatly appreciated ! I would be grateful to you, by mailing you my collection of DVD, in order to afford you to choose one among those. The only thing I could say is : could you begin to up' the DVD you have in Multisubs, in order to afford the max. of people to connect to it ?

Am I wrong?
