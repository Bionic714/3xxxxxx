,volex,2008-01-18T07:33Z,"Thanx for the upload! This is a great torrent. I have been looking for something like this but I have only found some short movies on youtube.com, so this is much appreciated!"
,Tuttankhamun,2009-05-10T07:20Z,"Wow ! Speechless, man...awesome dude...!
This is a thorough A to Z nunchaku / shuang jie gun / double-stick tutorial guide by a young korean master. 
I have been looking around on Google for this but it's just simply the best ever made.
A very highly recommended for beginners and even advanced nunchaku users.  
It's just too bad i don't speak korean...:) 
I personally have to thank Mr.Thorminator for uploading this torrent. 
Thank you so much, sir."
