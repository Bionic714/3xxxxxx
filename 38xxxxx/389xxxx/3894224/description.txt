I can do nunchaku.

A collection of nunchaku educational videos, in three parts, of a Korean (i think) nunchaku master.
All videos in .avi

My first UL ever.
UL a torrent because a person on a community wanted something like this.
Hope you like it Serenity. :)
And for others to enjoy also.

No text, and in Korean language, but damn it's neat.

If any of you other guys don't like it, just shut up.
It's as simple as that.
