Velvet Underground + A Warhol movie :o)

This is an upload for those of you interested in that
mythical and magic 1960┬┤s era, Pop Art, music etc...

One of the most mythical groups from that era was
Velvet Underground featuring the former
German model Nico, Lou Reed, John Cale and some others..

The band was formed in 1966 under the wings of the
legendary Pop Artist Andy Warhol...

Their first "officially released" record was
"The Velvet Underground & Nico" in 1966...

That record is here in this upload :o)
This is the "deluxe version" that
consists of both the original mono version
and the later stereo version of it...
It comes here In lossless Flac-format....


The Warhol movie?
Well, this piece of movie is a really rare one
Andy Warhol shot a movie of Velvet Underground
jamming at "The Factory" just a few days In of
the groups existence..The movie is in black and
white, very noisy and far out...sixties far out...
It┬┤s just over an hour in length...
It comes here in Xvid avi-format....
The source for this rip is NOT some old badly damaged
videotape :-) Nope...
The source for this rip is a DVD from
Museum of Modern Arts own library of
Warhol movies :o)...
