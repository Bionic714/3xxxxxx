One problem I'm having is with the letter 'S', when I try downloading it, I get told to save it on another hard drive, which I do, it starts d/loading but errors saying there isn't enough space on the drive which I know there is. Any ideas ? Cheers"

But, since no one else said it, I have to ask what's up with the Shania Twain obsession?  *rofl*

Guess everybody's got their thing. Mine is Prince and Tori Amos.... and 80's pop music. *giggle*"
