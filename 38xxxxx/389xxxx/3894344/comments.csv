I'll be uploading till the 23rd of Nov and then after 16th Dec as I'm out of town, hope to upload entire film before the 23rd. Please keep all the torrents alive for the amt you like the film. The other Bresson too.

I'm using Auto GK, does any one know a better way to make a quality .avi file?

Thanks Nax610 "
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-04T07:19Z,"The film is based on Dostoevsky's 'White Nights', which I consider one of the best love stories I've read. It's been adapted to the 1960s, but it is faithful to the original. (The other work based on Dostoevsky being, 'Un femme douce'). "
