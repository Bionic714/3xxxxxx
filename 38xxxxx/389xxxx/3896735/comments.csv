,SynGate,2008-04-05T10:20Z,"This album is officially available through my label www.syngate.net - no sweat at all! ;-)
So go ahead, download them, but please remember that artists such as Alien Nature do not have a big label behind him and can only keep making music by selling the very few copies we sell - we are not Justin Timberlake - so if you like this album, please buy a legal copy on CD-R, OK? Illegal download quite simply kills the music, and if honest music made with the heart dies to leave room only to commercial crap made by marketing guys, the world loses something important: a part of its soul.
Thanks ;-)
SynGate Records, an independent label that work with enthusiam for the music and not for money!!!"
