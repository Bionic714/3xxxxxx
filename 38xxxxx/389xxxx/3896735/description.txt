The idea for the title of this CD means to me that sometime in my life there would be a change. This is exactly what happened over the past few months. And with these changes you would sometimes imagine that there is a 'Distant Calling' of some kind that you cannot quite put your finger on? But down the line somewhere you'll have this feeling that something's gonna happen...
