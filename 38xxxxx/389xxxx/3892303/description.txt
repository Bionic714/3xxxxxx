New widescreen F-16CJ cockpit for Falcon 4.0:Allied Force.

This cockpit is made for 1920x1200 resolution (16:10) and scales down to lower resolutions like 1680x1050, 1440x900 and 1280x800. 

Can also be used with other widescreen resolutions like 16:9 but will look a little stretched horizontally, but not too bad.
