[Realmlist Setup]
You're almost close to being connected to WoWscape. In this step, you will need to download the WoWscape Server Launcher, which will automatically modify your World of Warcraft files to run WoWscape. You can download the WoWscape Server Launcher (WSL) by using the following link.

If for some reason the official WoWscape Server Launcher does not work for you, you may always manually modify your files to connect to WoWscape. To do this, please follow the following steps:

1.) Go to your World of Warcraft directory. The default directory is (C:Program FilesWorld of Warcraft), but you may have installed it in another directory depending on your preferences.

2.) Open up the file named "realmlist.wtf" with any default text editor and replace the entire data in there with the following data:


CODE
set realmlist logon.wowscape.net


3.) Run World of Warcraft and start playing!
