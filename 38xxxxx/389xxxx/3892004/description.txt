A video instructional series in German for college and high school classrooms and adult learners.


Follow the story of Professor Bob Di Donato and Marion, his assistant, as they create a German course using a ?German studies? approach. They weave together minidramas set in Germany, interviews with native speakers, and documentary footage on history and culture, all of which help increase fluency in and comprehension of the language. The narratives, presented in natural, authentic German, cover topics such as school, employment, travel, and personal relationships. Time codes on the videos make it easy to find specific segments. Levels 1 and 2 address vocabulary, topics, and structures for basic communication in German; level 3 continues many of these topics but goes into greater depth. The series is also appropriate for teacher professional development.
