The audio is fine but the video stops every few seconds as though it isn't 'buffering' quickly enough. HOWEVER, after I converted (with Any Video Converter ) to flv to half the size for putting on my phone, I noticed that the video was playing smoothly. So basically, download it then immediately convert all of the files (to avi/wmv/mp4 etc.) and it should be fine!"
