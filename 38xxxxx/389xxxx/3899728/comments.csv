Contains virus ""W32/Sdbot.worm.gen.bj"" according to McAfee"
,Dozirulf,2008-02-28T00:19Z,"*** WARNING *** #2
Symantec AntiVirus (SAV) finds ""W32.IRCBot"" in the keygen.exe

The pain in the ass is that the keygen DOES WORK.  I used it BEFORE I had SAV.  After a scan, SAV deleted the file and now I can't download the same keygen without SAV stomping it out of existence the moment it's downloaded.  Bummer."
,Thorcsf,2008-10-26T04:14Z,"Can someone please put here a serial for this app?
The keygen doesn't work with me. It says: ""Windows cannot access the device, path or specified file. Perhaps you don't have the adequate permissions to access the item.""
I am the system administrator."
,Thorcsf,2008-10-26T04:42Z,"Oops, it worked now! :)
It was my anti-virus - avast! - that was blocking from executing the file.
I disabled it and than the keygen worked."
,Thorcsf,2008-10-26T04:48Z,PS: it looks that the trojan encountered in the keygen is harmless! ;)
