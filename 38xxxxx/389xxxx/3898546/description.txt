Watch your movies on the go
With CloneDVD mobile you can put your favourite movies or TV series on your mobile video equipment and watch them wherever and whenever you want. Let the kids watch their favourite cartoons in the car. 

Incorporating the user-friendly interface of Elby's CloneDVD and the well-engineered open source project MEncoder as the conversion engine makes CloneDVD mobile a fast, easy-to-use and quality product that is very reasonably priced. 

Copying a DVD to your mobile video machine is achieved in a few mouse clicks and without the need to rip it to your hard-disk. Note that copying protected DVDs also requires AnyDVD.
