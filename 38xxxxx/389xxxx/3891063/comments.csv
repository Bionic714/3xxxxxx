,bsiderat88,2007-11-20T20:27Z,"I've downloaded it, but when I play it with the ratdvd program I only have visual, no sound. If I play it with mediaplayer it's the other way round, only sound no visual and I can't get it right.
Someone who can help me?"
,duns2068,2007-11-21T14:17Z,"you must install codec ratDVD, with ratDVD to turn it to DVD and later to burn it, or play with windows media player. Windows VISTA using Media Player Classic 6.4.9.1 is included in K-Lite Codec Pack http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm"
,bsiderat88,2007-11-21T20:15Z,"I already had a codec pack but without media player classic, so probably not the good one. It works perfect now, thnx!"
