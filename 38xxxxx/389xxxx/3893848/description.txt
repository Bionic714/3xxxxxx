Original Air Date: 23 February 1997
Just back from a holiday in Spain with his friend Kitty Rayford, DI Jack Frost investigates the death of Jeanette Barr, found on a nearby riverbank. The autopsy reveals that although she downed, it more likely happened in her bathtub and in the river. In the course of the investigation, Frost learns that she was having an affair with Richard Sheridan, a graphic designer who worked for her husband and his brother but he has an alibi for the time of her death. Jeanette's husband, Jack Barr, is known to Frost from when he investigated the murder of his first wife 10 years previously. Unfortunately someone is already serving a sentence for that killing and Jack finds himself suspended while an internal investigation takes place.
