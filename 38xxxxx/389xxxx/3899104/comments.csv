OK. I can sum this movie up easily. Bad. This movie made ""The Marine"" look like ""Casablanca"". I have no idea who allowed this movie to be made but I am going to start a petition that anyone who had anything to do with this movie at all be summarily executed for crimes against humanity. Just a terrible movie that was painful to watch. Bad dialog, bad acting (the fact that it has Ice Cube should tell you everything you need to know), and just generally a bad story that should never have made it to production. Save your time and your money. If you're considering watching this film, do yourself a favour: Jam a 12 foot pike through your door and just run full speed into it head first. At least that way you can be granted a quick death which is more then you'll get with this film. Please, for the love of god tell me that Ice Cube will never appear in another film. To John McGinley: Shame on you. If you were that desperate for money you could have simply taken up selling crack. It would have been more honourable. How do you go from Platoon to THIS!?!?! Kill yourself man. You're never going to live this down. ""
