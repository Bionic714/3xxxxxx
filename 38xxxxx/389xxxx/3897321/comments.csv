,jarom,2007-11-18T05:13Z,"I would suggest applying these updates in the following order:

ut2004-winpatch3369.exe
ut2004-ECEBonusPack1-1.exe
ut2004megapack.exe

Any order after the above were applied:
cbp1.zip
cbp2-volume1_zip.zip
cbp2-volume2_zip.zip
AS-Confexia.zip
dm-forbidden.zip
ut2004-onsbonusmappack.zip"
,jarom,2007-11-18T07:50Z,"If you are impatient, you can get all these files from the link in the description.  If you do, however, please seed!

Note, dm-forbidden.zip is corrupted on some of the mirrors, so be sure to check the md5sums.  I think the server in the Netherlands works."
