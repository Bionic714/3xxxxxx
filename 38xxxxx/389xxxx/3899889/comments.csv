,isepiq,2012-06-19T01:04Z,"Go here : http://kingdomszone.com/Downloads.htm

Download This: Ultimate TA:K Pack Version 1.0

Make sure you install TAK 3.0 first, THEN 4.1. Just give it time it will put up several install windows. Do the 3.0 install first. Cancel anything you do not want. It is ALL 100% safe.

Go to your program files menu & open TA Kingdoms & click on Campaign Without CD. I put a copy of this shortcut on my desktop. This will give you the NEWEST most up to date Kingdoms WITH Iron Plaque ALSO! The download is direct & FAST. No ADDS etc. Very nice"
