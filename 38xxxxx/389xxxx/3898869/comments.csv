,DogNo7,2007-11-20T06:34Z,"Actually, I seed things until I establish other seeders, and check back periodically to finish orphaned torrents.

Usually, to start, I seed to two people, who are in turn sharing with other people.

This seems to be about optimum, as this is the quickest way to get torrents to 100%, and not a lot of redundant transmissions from me to others, which would slow things down.  (Yes, it could be slower.)

Currently, I seed about 4 movies at a time, and I try to stagger them, so when I get torrents to 100%, I can drop the bandwidth from me to that torrent, so I can allocate more bandwidth to torrents that are still getting established.

Black and white is normally an advantage as well, as it results in smaller files.

So, I usually sprinkle B&W with colour movies.
