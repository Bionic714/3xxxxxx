,Mournfel,2007-11-17T01:06Z,"I actually agree, im not a fan of the game at all lol but some like it and i had it lying around so i used it as my first torrent upload, kind of a experiment, just to make sure everything is working with the uploading process but to those who like it enjoy lol."
,daystogo90,2007-11-21T07:33Z,Mournfel its people like you that make p2p such a great thing I thank you for this game and I look forward to other great uploads from you   will you be uploading cracks or key codes for games or do we need just to find that out on our own just was wondering  now Iam starting my download
,Mournfel,2007-11-21T18:12Z,"All my game torrents will have the needed cracks and keygens in them and very simple directions on how to make it all work, i know how frustrating it was when i first started to DL pirated games"
,daystogo90,2007-11-22T07:14Z,yes I saw that mornfel  good job its cant wait for you morrowind  game  havent played since I had my xbox stolen and I wanted to beat it     good job   
,daystogo90,2007-11-22T07:16Z,"oh and your fable and halo games you uploaded have no seeders so how can someone download it, did you forget to start seeding them or can you just start the download and then I become the seeder???"
,daystogo90,2007-11-22T19:16Z,92.7 percent downloaded  all most there then I will seed  lets keep it going
,Mournfel,2007-11-22T20:27Z,"to Daystog: yeah im not sure whats up with that im seeding it, i think it could be that i started seeding the torrent before i uploaded it to pirates bay, im gonna send them an email to figure it out. morrowind will be out as soon as i can crack the expansions, shouldn't be long now."
,90daystogo,2007-11-24T18:00Z,yea this sucks  I have to redownload this after I was done downloading I forgot to put on disk and I installed windows xp 64bit edition and had to wipe my drive woops. oh well
,90daystogo,2007-11-25T18:32Z,oh yea Iam seeding for everybody   good upload mornfel looking forward to your next ones
,90daystogo,2007-11-26T04:08Z,hey this is a good game not to bad never played it before and its not to bad

,spiderpie,2007-12-02T09:11Z,"I must be doing something wrong...

I downloaded, mounted and installed. I then placed the crack in to the Program Files/Deus Ex - Invisible War/System folder next to the original EXE.

When I try to play, I get all of the title screen (Nvidia etc.) and I click on New Game, watch the opening cutscene, choose the colour scheme and avatar, and as it's loading (or not loading) I get a No CD error.

Any Ideas?"
,Mournfel,2007-12-04T18:54Z,Don't put the crack near the original exe replace it with the crack
,Mournfel,2007-12-04T19:13Z,"If that doesn't work you might be putting it in the wrong folder (shortcut folder) thats a common mistake that would produce that result, but its probably just the game still running off the original exe instead of the crack copy the original file and put it somewhere for safe keeping, its always a good idea to be able to restore the game to its original. hope this helps and i will include it in future install notes."
,TazeR-117,2007-12-06T21:56Z,"I got everything installed.
Mounted disc 1 .ISO
Loaded with the original DX2 application, and it worked up untill the title screen, where it freezes right away.
I realized I forgot to use the crack.  In a comment, you said to replace it with the original DX2. It still doesn't work.
I click it, and it doesnt load anything...
my mouse does the loady thing for a second, but nothing. :(
any solutions?"
,jimmybeebop,2007-12-08T12:59Z,"I am confused, i seem to be having the same problem as TazeR-117 
i've loaded the iso files via daemon and put disk 1 back as the mounted disk

then copied the crack file to the same file as the games original exe as your 'how to install' instructions say - this is where it goes through the first scenes of the game setup then says the wrong disk is inserted

then i replaced the original exe file with the crack, as you mentioned in a prvious comment, and it cannot load anything as its looking for the 'DX2.exe' file

any suggestions?"
,forb,2007-12-08T13:24Z,Having the same problem as the two above :/
,dpspcdrgn,2007-12-08T13:55Z,"Yo, that's too bad; I've been trying everywhere to get this game and well, I have to admit that this looked to be promising; Alas I also have the same problem as the two people above me, and (being a veteran at this sort of thing) I was certain maybe I couldn't get it working because I was overlooking something, but....                               Oh btw why is there 2 Ion Loaders on Iso #2???
One won't even copy to disk...      Plz help us figure this out as I know at Least one of us who is itching to play this game!"
,dpspcdrgn,2007-12-08T14:11Z,"Ok Ppl, I've finally figured this one out (and apologies to Mournfel if I seemed abrasive in my prev comment). Ok, what you have to do is rename 
CRACK.EXE to Ion Launcher.exe and overwrite the Ion Launcher.exe which is in your Deus Ex - Invisible War/System Folder.     Thanx for the game Mournfel but next time plz plz plz make it easier for ppl to understand what to do.      I'm defenitely no noob and this took awhilez  =D 
Anyhow enjoy !"
,jimmybeebop,2007-12-08T14:38Z,Well done dpspcdrgn that worked perfect!!! and cheers for the game Mournfel got there in the end!!
,dpspcdrgn,2007-12-08T15:55Z,"Only prblm is I can't patch =(  
                   If someone figures out how...
                                   Plz be to lettin me know
                    ^.^"
,lamichealfu,2007-12-09T07:38Z,"Why is it that when I load the game it goes through the opening logos then starts loading the actual game it just closes? I've tried everything, replacing the crack, different ways of installing it, mounting, unmounting, any ideas?"
,thepiratebayrocks,2007-12-09T19:26Z,"CRAP DOESN""T WORK FOR ME I""M TRYING OTHER WAYS OFF OTHER WEBSITES YOU LET ME DOWN I SURE HOPE FABLE CUZ THIS ONE DIDN""T"
,TazeR-117,2007-12-10T22:20Z,"Gah... that didnt even work for me... :[
this is hopeeeelessss!"
,Mournfel,2007-12-11T03:12Z,"oh snap dps is right about renaming the crack to match the original exe, i left that out of the instructions, my bad, you wont have to rename any  files in any of my other releases, because i had decided to just tell you what the crack file was called and where to find it, and this game is a working copy i have played the version i cracked through to the end and given the file to friends with just the instructions and they have gotten it working not to mention other comments on this page indicate others have it working so i assure you aside from having to rename that file  this is a good working copy of the game, so if you are still having problems after renaming the file ""Correctly"" then you have done something wrong, more then likely placed the crack in a shortcut folder. Uninstall completely and try again fresh, dont place the crack until you are sure it is the proper folder w/o shortcut files."
,Langerz,2007-12-16T03:00Z,"'How to install.odt' is like an essay. :D
Please for instructions keep them, clear, concise, and only about a paragraph long. 

1. Install game using a CD-ROM Emulator, or extract the ISO's, or burn the images to a CD-ROM.
2. create a backup file of  ""{INSTALLED_GAME_DIR}/System/Ion Launcher.exe"".
3. Copy CRACK.EXE to ""{INSTALLED_GAME_DIR}/System""
4. rename ""{INSTALLED_GAME_DIR}/System/CRACK.exe"" to ""{INSTALLED_GAME_DIR}/System/Ion Launcher.exe""

Enjoy!

If people do not understand that, then they probably shouldn't b using torrents to begin with, since they don't have basic computer skills, and will likely just leach and kill torrents off."
,kreme,2007-12-19T18:07Z,"i use crack from this download...
but it always crash....

but i find a way to solve the crash

first after you install it...
find patch deus ex invisible war v1,2
and install it...

and then use crack from this
http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=932
find the crack for v1.2

then copy paste it into the deus ex 
system folder...

after that...
click the DX2.exe

then u are ready to play
with no lag and no crash"
,Mournfel,2007-12-20T22:14Z,"In response to Langers : I made the instructions so that anyone can make the torrent work, and I don't agree with your snobby tech elitist attitude, tghe reason most people who download a file don't continue to seed is because they cant get it to work so they delete the file and why wouldn't they when i DL a torrent and it's shit i dont continue to seed it either i delete it as would you im sure. everyone deserves to learn."
,Mournfel,2007-12-20T22:16Z,I will however add a basic step by step guide along with the nobs guide in the future
,rasko1nikov,2007-12-30T04:25Z,"maaan, this torrent is ageing me prematurely.   i think i've done everything right: copied the crack into system folder, renamed it, remounted disc 1 in order to play, blah blah, but when i start a new game and have chosen my character and it's all loading up, the game cuts out and tells me to insert disc 1. why would it do this to me? maybe i deserve it but i don't think so.  looking at some of the other comments it seems a few ppl had this problem but overcame it so where did i go wrong?

any help greatly appreciated forever (or at least a week)."
,rasko1nikov,2007-12-30T11:39Z,"ok, scratch that, i've got a different problem. 

when the actual game loads up now (after selecting new game and having chosen a black guy with white man's spiky hair) it doesn't ask for disc 1. instead, it loads for an indefinate amount of time which isn't actually indefinate (5 mins) but feels like it... after the promise of the loading screen it eventually just cuts out without so much as an explaination.

i didn't wanna be on here whining like a little bitch but damn, i wanna play this game bad."
,rasko1nikov,2007-12-30T23:25Z,"yip yip!

at last it works!

 i went to the pub, and imbued with the power of ale i came home, sat down in a haze and drunkenly uninstalled everything before installing again and this time it worked! 

love to Mournfel and the guy who figured out the renaming the crack deal.

now... i need to lie down."
,linear_soul_child,2008-01-11T02:31Z,"HERE'S A SOLUTION THAT WORKED FOR ME:

After my initial install the game froze on the Menu. So I installed Patch 1.2 and used the crack on the link provided by 'kreme' (thanks a heap for that!) 

Here it is again: http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=932

But after this it still froze. I searched about and found a few articles describing a problem some old games have with Hyper-Threading! One method is to execute the game, Ctrl-Alt-Del, then right click on the game executable (probably DX2.exe) then click 'Set Affinity', then unclick everything but 'CPU 0'.

This, alas, didn't work for me. The second and more surefire method is to go into BIOS (by pressing Del when the computer starts up) go into BIOS Settings and turn off Hyper-Threading. Save and Exit BIOS.

The game now works fine for me. If you have a freeze problem with this rip then check if you have a Hyper-Threaded chip, then turn it off. 


Hope this helps!"
,klobos,2008-01-29T09:21Z,Thank you Mournfel this game works perfectly also i have hyper thread and i didnt had to do anything else but to follow the instructions correctly you can play it.thank you again!
,Diablojoe420,2008-02-08T14:24Z,How is it some people have no problems and others have nothing but? I've tried both solutions (renaming AND patching/downloading other crack) with no success. The game still freezes at the main menu.. This is just leading to one giant headache. Going to mess with it for a few more hours before I delete the torrent. -_-
,klobos,2008-02-15T09:13Z,"Diablojoe420
I dont know if i can help you but the mistake i did the first time and had the same problem was that after i put the patch i started the game from the shortcut icon in the desktop but not you have to open in from the .exe icon that you put the patch or to make a new shortcut after the patch"
,klobos,2008-02-15T09:15Z,sorry on my previous post i dont mean patch but crack :P
,grantu9998,2008-05-26T22:15Z,"installed...  cracked... everythign was fine, no ""insert cd"" prompt,

but i open the game and it goes directly to a blank screen, press alt+f4 to get out then the opening credits roll on. so i thoguht ""good"".

credits finish, loading screen appears, bar goes up half an inch then the game closes out. even tried updating to 1.2 then patching with a 1.2 patch and its the same, any idea what the problem is?"
,noman313,2008-06-07T08:59Z,"I have the same problem as the above poster, though it appears it may not have anything to do with the crack, as the same thing happens to me regsrdless of whether I have applied the crack or not. Anyone have a fix? I have installed the game on plain old XP Home, running on a mobile Intel chipset."
,Red.XII,2008-06-25T12:43Z,"Much thanks to linear_soul_child  I was dicking around with this for about an hour before I read his comment about the multiple cpu issue. Works great now, thanks Mournfel."
,wcatdoor,2008-07-06T05:58Z,"Weird, i got this game with my graphics card. i porbly still have it just lost some where. I started using the command system like in oblivion to cheat and ignored the plot. I am so glad i dont have to go find it to play it."

,noot02,2008-10-09T08:44Z,"After spending too much time trying to make it working, I gave up, stopped the seeding, trashing everything about and started downloading this one:

,jessez,2008-11-17T23:12Z,thanks langerz your directions was not 100% but good enough for me it works just great and you can't realy copy the crack then rename it you need to rename it first or it will say there is already a file with that name then you replace the file i actualy did simular before reading the post i renamed it DX2 but it failed but renaming it Ion Launcher works great and you don't even need cd backups to run it awesome

Like quite a number of other people here, I tried all the suggestions, cracks, and patches but came up with nothing. Echoing what gord12 said, this definitely qualifies as a well deserved fuck you. I've trashed the torrent and won't be supporting the download of something that's a waste of everyone's time, from an uploader who's a waste of air, and a dipshit faggot to boot."

Black screen, nothing happens... When I AltTabbedOut, the window minimized but it came back displaying setup screen, but after hitting ""start new game"" it went back to the black screen again.

I've tried all of the cracks but nothing worked... same story every time.

But I've decided to uninstall it and do a fresh install from the scratch and I've used this crack EURO 1.2
And voila, it worked, but the game is sooo bad...
I mean, it's been only few years since 2003 when this game was released, but the difference is unbelievable... the physics, the graphics... damn...
Hopefully it will help someone and spare you some frustration.
