,superhenk,2008-03-23T21:14Z,why do i get this when i asked for static-x?
,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-03-26T02:20Z,"most likely reason you get this when searching Static-X is because on this theres a song called mutant-X and the ""-X"" on mutant-X is just what it brings up because of the ""-X"" part in your search for static-X if thats not the reason you get this torrent in yourr search results then i dunno wtf this comes up for?

also GREAT TORRENT, i already have all of these albums (that i downloaded from various places) and the albums i downloaded had a few tracks missing from most albums so your torrent is fantastically completing all my albums and supplying me with the tracks i need to complete my collection so thanks and keep seeding ;)"
,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-03-26T02:27Z,"also has anyone got 

The wraith: shangri-la
The Wraith:Hell's Pit

as a torrent (both together or two seperate torrents) because i have both albums yet incomplete so i need a few tracks to complete both albums and the only torrents i could find here already are dead and have no seeds

can anyone help?"
,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-03-26T02:29Z,"and im not talking about the wraith remix albums, i just downloaded those from here :D

,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-04-06T11:28Z,"not sure if that dudes still looking for the calm album but anyway you should be able to get that with any insane clown posse discography torrent here... if the calm isnt on the torrent then its not that much good of a discography however i got an ICP discography off this site and it had the calm on it =]

just to let y'all know i have every ICP, Twiztid & ABK album now so ignore those requests of mine a little higher in the comments list =]

but can anyone get me a jumpsteady, blaze & nate the mack discography and theres a new dark lotus album coming out on the 15th april 2008 called the opaque brotherhood so MMFWCL to anyone who can up a torrent of that to this site =]"
,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-04-19T15:47Z,"can anyone upload a torrent of Killa C's tainted flesh and Project deadman's self-inflicted

as two seperate torrents would be fine but both albums as one torrent would make my life easier also id rather them not compressed with winrar because i only need a few tracks not all of them =]

,TheEndSmiles,2011-02-28T00:22Z,"ok so this whole torrent is prolly fucked up because on Independence Day Monsters Ball and Bury Them All have their names switched around, and none of the albums have the right tags. so good luck sorting that out"
,thesouthernthreathimself,2011-06-14T13:40Z,This is my demo that I am offering free to all who are down to listen. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6469142 It contains a mixture of that which is realistic with that which is fantasy. Hard times have helped to create that whom you have the chance to understand. Enter this realm with an open mind and willing ears and you shall learn much. This demon which guides these hands have created a masterpiece which you are sure to enjoy. You like the music? then go toand add yourself as a fan and find my facebook and request to be added to my friends list as well. MMFWCL to all those wicked family keeping the underground strong and thriving!
