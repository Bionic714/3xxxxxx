This emulator allows you to run almost any CD/DVD-ROM (not CSS-copy protected DVD)applications from your hard drive or network server. In your hard drive space, you can establish and access up to 23 different virtual CD/DVD-ROM drives. It works by creating image files of the CD/DVD-ROM \\\\\\\'s content on your hard drive. It can also run programs much faster than they would if they were running off a conventional CD/DVD-ROM drive.
