Sorry, not very techie..."
,raulv04,2010-06-22T08:07Z,"Thanks a lot! I used to have the double album about thirty years ago, and lost it when I moved to another city. I've been looking for this album for almost a quarter of a century. Thanks, oh, thanks a lot!!!!"
,raulv04,2010-06-22T08:08Z,"Sundaygirl, this is because iTunes does not support FLAC audio. You would have to convert the flac audio files to mp3 for you to upload them to iTunes."
