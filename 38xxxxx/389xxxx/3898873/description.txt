This was one of my favorite concert recordings in my youth.   These days I find the production values to be a bit lacking, 
with poor edits and other sound issues that would not make it to a major commercial release in this day and age.   Still 
though, the performances are quite energetic and there is certainly something to be said for a live album that (presumably)
has no overdubs.   For example, it would have been relatively easy to trim the "false end" from the Rockpile/Plant track, but 
why?   This is what you would expect to have happen at a fundraiser jam session and leaving it alone shows us the 
authenticity of the presentation.   In this way it is almost like a very good quality bootleg rather than a label release.

Of course I don't have to comment on the artists.

The record is in very respectable condition for the most part but it will probably not surprise anyone to find that side
four suffers a little more wear than the other three.

Includes flacs (what else?), art and checksums.
