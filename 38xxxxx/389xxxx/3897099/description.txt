Well, my children, I did as threatened and dug around in storage and came up with 22 more CD's of medieval music. Track information and cover art may therefore not be available for all of them. I went and checked at Amazon.com for each one to verify that they were out of print; some are available used, one was listed for SIXTY DOLLARS (!) and some simply didn't exist. These are lost treasures. Keep them well for me.

To save time and space, I ripped these at 320 kb rather than in Windows Lossless. As before, there are five torrents in total. This one includes:

Harmonia Mundi 1994 New Release Sampler
Officium (Jan Garbarek) <-- medieval Czech chants + modern saxophone = unique listening experience
Istampitta II (NY Ensemble for Early Music)
A Treasure Of Music For Hurdy-Gurdy (Rene Zosso ; Anne Osnowycz) <-- this was the $60 one

Be certain to download my other torrents of medieval and archaic music! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!
