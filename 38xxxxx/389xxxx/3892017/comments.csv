,mike902,2007-11-24T11:12Z,im getting an error message saying the installation is not supported by my system. anyone know what might be the problem?
,jahbulion,2007-11-24T11:18Z,Anyone got the NoDVD crack for this one?
,pappakeler,2007-11-24T11:24Z,The game doesn't work!! I need a no cd crack or something.. Or is it any other way to get it to work??
,aeikan,2007-11-24T13:01Z,"to make it work, just burn the *dmg image to a DVD (you'll may need a double layer DVD though).

when the dvd is burnt, the ""insert dvd"" message won't appear when trying to start the game. enjoy!! :)"
,jumbograde,2007-11-24T13:22Z,anyone got a no-dvd crack? i really can't be bothered to burn it... :(
,mike902,2007-11-24T13:24Z,it says i cant open the installer because it's not supported on my system. anyone know why thats happening?
,jumbograde,2007-11-24T13:36Z,"that's weird mike... worked perfectly on my macbook up till the ""insert DVD"" part.."
,mike902,2007-11-24T13:40Z,ok ive got it now. I burned the installer to a dvd and it works fine.
,jumbograde,2007-11-24T13:46Z,arghhh... guess i'm gonna have to buy some dvds tomorrow..
,mike902,2007-11-24T13:58Z,now its installed but its asking me to insert the dvd to play it. this is frustrating.
,mike902,2007-11-24T14:31Z,im trying burning the game data to a dvd hopefully it works.
,jumbograde,2007-11-24T16:17Z,"tell me if it works.. i really want to try this game, seems pretty awesome"
,pappakeler,2007-11-24T17:12Z,"i tried to burn it in to a 4,7 gb dvd! but it says the file is to big.. but it's only 4,4 gb! what is wrong????"
,mike902,2007-11-24T19:29Z,"didnt work and it wont let me burn the disk image to a dvd because it says the file is too big, even though it's not."
,mscottparker,2007-11-24T20:03Z,"I burned the contents of the *dmg to a DVD as a DVD-ROM with Toast but it didn't work.  Advice, anyone?"
,mike902,2007-11-24T21:03Z,"mxlx3, did you have the original game or did you have a burned copy ?"
,Japhthor,2007-11-25T00:07Z,Tried numerous combinations of DVD in the drive; no joy yet. :(
,mscottparker,2007-11-25T02:17Z,d'oh!
,Burbla,2007-11-25T10:45Z,"Regarding the file size. Take a closer look, it´s actually 4723659776 Bytes.

"
,mike902,2007-11-25T13:39Z,so if we have a double layer dvd it should be fine?
,madcrea,2007-11-25T17:18Z,"for burn in a single DVDL...
mount the .DMG image - move ""Extras"" folder to trash - open toast - choose UDF burning type - then drag the new Republic image to Toast- Burn"
,mike902,2007-11-25T18:43Z,"I did that and it still doesnt work, although It seems I put some of the files on twice. could that affect it?"
,mscottparker,2007-11-25T18:57Z,"Nope, I've done the same thing also... three times.  Next idea anyone?"
,mike902,2007-11-25T19:03Z,mxlx3 did you have the original game or did you have a cracked copy? what are we doing wrong?
,Thesamenio1,2007-11-25T20:48Z,So there is no crack for this game??! 
,Steveio,2007-11-25T23:28Z,"Yea I also get the ""Insert DVD"" msg when I try to play the game. any ideas? I tried burning it to a DVD but it said the file was too big."
,mscottparker,2007-11-26T03:06Z,"I FINALLY got it to work!  I didn't do anything different than the first time I tried.  I just burned the contents of the .dmg minus the extras folder onto a DVD in Toast.  

It didn't work for me the first time.  Then I did it again and it didn't work.  Then I decided to create a new .dmg file and that didn't work, either.  But when I tried the second disk I made again it worked.  Who knows.  Keep trying.  I'm gonna go play Republic.  Good luck, guys."
,mxlx3,2007-11-26T07:58Z,MXLX3 here. I have the original DVD.  I'm surprised so many people are having issues.I tested this before I uploaded the torrent.  I just mounted the image via toast. It installed perfectly and played fine. I have a macbook pro 2Ghz/ OS 10.5
,mike902,2007-11-27T12:59Z,exactly what files were on the working cd? i bought a double layer dvd+r and burned the whole dmg on it and it didnt work. im going to try burning just get game data on it.
,mike902,2007-11-27T19:50Z,could someone seed the extras folder from the disc image please? i accidentally deleted mine.
,Japhthor,2007-11-30T04:38Z,Mounted the .dmg via toast; re-installed from that mounted .dmg; game still demands that the dvd be in the drive.
,kenogramm,2007-12-01T02:32Z,just look for the hidden files on the image. copy them too.
,collin_stevens,2007-12-01T03:04Z,Keno what invisible files exactly do I want to copy to a disc? And do I just use copy disc with Toast or can I just drag and drop the contents of the mounted image (those that I need to copy anyway) and burn it that way?
,cdb8256,2007-12-01T17:21Z,"I tried to burn a DVD with invisible files. I tried with Toast and also with Disc Utility. There is an invisible files you cannot select because you have absolutely no privilege on it:HFS + Private directory data. Checking informations on this file says it's closed.
So i put all the other invisible files including ""Spotlight-V100 and SafeDiscDVDBundle.
But once the DVD is burnt, it does not work."
,collin_stevens,2007-12-01T19:17Z,Same here I did the exact same thing and it was still a no go. Can't somebody figure this thing out? It seems that only one person has had any luck with it and I'm not even sure if that's true or not.
,kenogramm,2007-12-01T22:43Z,"convert the image to read/write. empty the extras folder. create a new image with burnable size. copy everything (incl hidden files & folders, also the hfs+ folder) to the new image. burn with toast. it works."
,collin_stevens,2007-12-03T05:33Z,"I did like you said Keno and I'm still having trouble. Maybe I still didn't do it right. The image was already read/write. I made a 4.7 gig .img with Disk Utility , then I enabled hidden files on my Mac and made sure to copy everything on the Republic .img except the contents of the extras folder, which I trashed, to the new .img which I made with Disk Utility. I made sure to include the hfs+ folder as well. Another thing that seems strange to me is the fact that the mounted image is only a little over a gig, where as the file itself is obviously over 4 gigs. Did I miss something or go about it the wrong way? Any help would be awesome."
,kenogramm,2007-12-04T22:00Z,"the only hidden files on the burnt disc are SafeDiscDVD.bundle and euro.tif-
hope this helps."
,Luffar-Antastarn,2007-12-11T18:37Z,I can't get this to work at all... It just crashes the second I try to start it.
,cdb8256,2007-12-12T21:10Z,"Well, i manage to burn this DVD by creating an image disc of 4,7Go. I insert all the files one by one, except the Extra, and I include also invisible files, even the SafeDiscDVDbundle file which is  more than 3Go.
When you insert all the files one by one there no problem of insertion. The DVD was 3,38Go and I manage to burn it with Disk utility.
I installed the game with the DVD inside my Mac and when I started to play, it asked me for the DVD. So it's obvious that the DVD is not recognized. I don't know what is needed for the DVD to be recognized, maybe the extra file I didn't insert....But it's too late to try, I trashed them.
I thnk we need a no DVD crack."
,cdb8256,2007-12-12T21:28Z,"i noticed also that when you mount this DVD republic .dmg, with toast or with Dsik utility, if you open a window in the finder, the disc does not appear in the upper left corner of the window, like the other disc or drive. It only appears on the desktop. Maybe it's why it is not recognised by the game."
,cdb8256,2007-12-12T23:25Z,"Hey guys! I finally manage to make this DVD working!!
OK,Mount the image disc and make all the files of Republic.dmg visible. Select Menu > get information and make all the file Read and Write. 
The best thing is to put all the files in one folder and make all this folder authorizations Read and Write (for you and, the group and so on..) and then you select apply to all elements
So you are sure all your files will get correct authorisations.
Then, open toast and select File copy, not Disc Copy ! select file Copy as if you were copying text files...
Put all your files here, the visible and invisible files and then Name your disc Republic.
burn it, insert it in your mac and play the game.
It should work.
I hope it will help. Sorry for my english, I am french...

"
,mike902,2007-12-14T17:06Z,how do you make the files visible? 
,cdb8256,2007-12-15T16:29Z,Use Tinkertools or Cocktail which is free to make visible the invisible files
,Japhthor,2007-12-15T21:57Z,"Holy crap I got it to work.

Mount .dmg. Make a new folder on the desktop (republic-burn)

Make all files visible using Pathfinder (free trial) http://www.cocoatech.com/download.php

Copy all files except those prefixed by a . and the Extras folder to the burn folder.

Get Info on all files (from Pathfinder) and make sure they're all read-write for everyone, recursively.

Insert a new dvd.

As cdb8256 said, manually drag each file into the new dvd's burn folder. You don't need toast; I did it just in the normal mac burning setup.

Make sure the new disc is named Republic.

Profit! ;)"
,linsux,2007-12-16T01:38Z,"Holy cow! It worked! Thanks!!
The game goes haywire, though! I can see somem parts of the game user interface displayed, but the view area (the ""world""?) isn't drawn. I have to restart the game everytime.
I also couldn't find ""Quit"". Seems like a nice game, thanks to mxlx3 and cdb8256!"
,mx_seb,2008-02-03T15:19Z,"Salut je n'arrive pas a graver le fichier en ""image disque"" car il est trop grand...

Comment faire?
Est ce que quelqu'un serait dans la capacité de me répondre en francais? 

Merci beaucoup"
,Blackmoumoune,2008-02-06T12:18Z,"Oui, je teste la procédure en français et je te tiens au courant après ma douche!"
,Blackmoumoune,2008-02-06T13:36Z,"Je reprends la procédure en français, pour ceux qui ne parlent pas la langue de Shakespeare:

-Monter le fichier Republic.dmg sur le bureau
-Télécharger PathFinder (http://www.cocoatech.com/download.php), qui permet de révéler les fichiers cachés dans l'image disque 'Republic'
-Copier tous les fichiers (dont ceux cachés) contenus dans l'image disque, sauf Extras et les fichiers précédés d'un '.' nommé 'Republic-burn', vers un dossier sur le bureau
-Changer, avec Pathfinder, les autorisations des fichiers copiés. Ils doivent être autorisés en lecture-écriture pour tous les utilisateurs. Bien vérifier que cela est fait
-Insérer un DVD vierge
-Copier les fichiers depuis le dossier 'Republic-burn' vers le DVD. Le tout fait 4,28 Go et tiennent sur un DVD.
Graver, soit depuis mac os, soit depuis Toast. Personnellement, pour moi, ça a planté avec mac os, mais pas avec Toast.

Et là, installez, et faites vous plaisir.

,xaviel,2008-02-11T04:57Z,"I did this ""for burn in a single DVDL...
mount the .DMG image - move ""Extras"" folder to trash - open toast - choose UDF burning type - then drag the new Republic image to Toast- Burn"" and it works, BUT YOU NEED TO EJECT THE REPUBLIC IMG BEFORE INSERTING THE DVD, when trying to play.!!"
,LarsenLouper,2008-03-29T14:20Z,seed seed please
,TheMediocrePirate,2008-04-06T08:20Z,"works fine on my lintel MBP. 
just make sure that when you copy the disc image you remember to copy all invisible files (http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/24632/invisibility-toggler), delete name it ""Republic"" or else it will not work. "
,fatboylard,2008-05-12T16:47Z,"Hey guys, found a no dvd crack for this one at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4055968/_No_CDs . only thing it's part of a large folder containing cracks for a load of other mac games. 

if you install the game, then open republic.dmg in the crack folder, drag the 'Republic' crack file into the republic folder in applications to replace the original. have only started playing this one and the gameplay is rather juddery even with the graphics at lowest spec.

am running an intel I-Mac on OSX 10.4.11"
,Rholmm,2009-08-21T00:31Z,"Many thanks to Japhthor and Blackmoumoune. All worked just fine for me. I appreciate it. Kudos to you.

Merci à Japhtor et Blackmoumoune. Les explications étaient très claires et cela fonctionne parfaitement pour moi."
,cma6math,2010-01-08T19:07Z,Please someone SEED. There are people who want to download this.
,LakeOfSorrow,2010-01-26T21:32Z,"With the cd or with the crack I get the same problem: when the game starts, the image gets stuck and mouse pointer gets crashing all over the display. Any clue?"
,LakeOfSorrow,2010-02-04T01:02Z,"Works fine in my PowerBook G4 (PPC). In my intel iMac, it doesn't."
