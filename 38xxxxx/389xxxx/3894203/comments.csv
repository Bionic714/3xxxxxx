,ari5429,2007-11-25T20:30Z,it still dosent work after repair it still shows 30day crap somebody help please
,lukewarmfish,2007-11-27T05:23Z,"Laurentio is correct. After you apply the crack and get the error message, repair the installation. Next, copy over the cracked version a second time. Works like a charm. Thankz all."
,eager-seeder,2007-11-27T15:30Z,PLEASE also help me someone! I followed all the cracking instructions but i keep getting this error message and even after I repair it the 30 day registration thing comes back on and I copy over the cracked dll file again and the error message comes back! IM STUCK! HELP 
,lukewarmfish,2007-11-28T01:56Z,"I suspect people who are having problems have attempted to upgrade the software. If this is the case I am afraid you may have to wipe clean (remember to uninstall both premier and server programs) and begin again. Even though the crack says upgrade first, I believe Intuit is definitely on to this trick.

As a thought experiement, I ntentionally ""broke"" the crack by upgrading, then wiped it clean, and went through the steps a second time. This works. It's frustrating and not a clean crack overall, but it works."
,ari5429,2007-12-05T17:28Z,thanks for your help after repairing product i overwrote the patch again & it works thanks very much
,buzz1234,2007-12-19T01:03Z,"If you read the info, the crack is specifically for patch release 6 (R6)...   Current update level is patch R12.  Unless a newer crack for R12 is available, best to only apply R6 and forget the newer patches from QB!"
,buzz1234,2007-12-19T03:59Z,"Sorry... for 2007, current Intuit patch level is R10..."
,buzz1234,2007-12-19T04:11Z,"OK... Here is the link to the R6 patch that matches the crack...
http://sharedld.intuit.com/pub/quickbooks/2007/r6/

With this update level and the crack listed, it should work fine..."
,PrimalFear,2007-12-28T18:11Z,"So just to be sure, can you confirm, DO NOT UPGRADE until newer crack comes out? that being R12 version!"
,ambrosia13,2008-01-29T19:49Z,"i cant even install it, i get a DIZ file which when opened all i get is text. help"
