,scottsasse,2010-12-19T00:00Z,"THANK YOU!! This music brings back memories. I got a chance to meet Ice-T during his first tour with Body Count. Before the concert the Virginia Beach police dept made it clear they would arrest Ice-T if he performed ""Cop Killer"". Well he did and the pigs drew their batons but for some reason never made their arrest. Most artists would have pussed-out, FUCK THE POLICE!!!!!!!!! "
