,Rezagrats,2008-02-10T09:19Z,"my advice; cut off the torrent. repost it having the .uif file converted into a .iso file so that everyone can use it, idk how it'd work but get the message to everyone seeding."
,Rezagrats,2008-02-10T11:07Z,"you know what, fuck this bullshit, i've jumped through enough fucking hoops, i can't open this ungodly file"
,saqib786,2008-02-12T04:09Z,"Guys, use the latest version of WinISO (trial version works fine too) to open up the uif file. Then just extract all the pdf files inside to a folder."
,johanmark,2008-10-26T10:17Z,good! extracted the pdf files by mounting the image using magiciso

MagicISO is a CD/DVD image file creating / editing / extracting tool. It can open / create / edit / extract CD/DVD image files, and it can convert bin to iso and back. 

Universal Image Format (UIF) is a compression image file format for backing up CD/DVDs. 

MagicISO has a ### freeware program called MagicDisk ### that can open UIF files on Windows computers.

For the Mac, you have to convert the file to ISO format and the tool UIF2ISO promises to do that by simply dropping the UIF file onto the tool. Once converted, the file can be opened or burned
