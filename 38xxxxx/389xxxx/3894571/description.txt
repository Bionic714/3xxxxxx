Other grps proper was invalid because you can't proper for qualitive reasons
such as blocking or 'coloring'. If you could then alot more people would
find themselves being propered for such things

That said, other grps release was just as blocky if not more so, was blurrier etc. 
The colors in our release weren't perfect either so we took some time to look over
it and reencode with better filters and as one complete full 2-PASS encode and that
fixed the minor issue from before. If you have the other one and find it watchable
then there's no need to redownload this one. If you found the other bothersome, 
then we've made this one for you.
 
And oh yeah it was 13seconds shorter too. 

Lastly, happy 1000th release to us. Here's hoping for thousands more to come.
