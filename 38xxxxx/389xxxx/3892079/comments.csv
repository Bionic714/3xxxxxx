Disc 2 contains sample tones, scenery, other useful things you'll need.  And Disc 3, has 4 tones installations.  Be sure to follow the ""INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.txt"" file when installing these files.  Hope this helps with the installation process."

,pan!C,2008-05-25T23:54Z,Great download.. but no serial key. Anyone know where to get a keygen? Cheers.
,pan!C,2008-05-26T00:02Z,"Sorry, i found it. For all you that are wondering, if you mount the image onto your computer:

Make sure that CD1.iso is mounted.

Open ""My computer"" and right click where it's mounted. Then hit ""explore""

You'll see the CYGiSO folder.

Serial.txt is in there with the serial number on it.

Enjoy."

,WChobbs,2008-08-11T02:02Z,"The CD Key is on the first disk. Here is is:

EWE3D0-98NV60-C9VJ60-NBHT20-XFEB00

That is the serial on the CD, I have used it on both XP and Vista and it works.  There are no letter 'O' is is zeros. "
,AlmightyWeird1,2008-08-11T09:39Z,"Okay, I'm totally lost. (I'm also new at this, so please don't be mean)

I don't really understand what you mean by 'mount', if it's 'move the file somewhere'... where do I move it?

I keep getting the same problem, Error: 9, or more often than not, it tells me that it needs 'Evaluation'... I can't figure out how to make it work!

Also, I've read magicISO here a few times, what is that? I click on the files and it automaticly asks me if it wants to open in winRAR or Power2GO (Some ISO CD burner thing)

I'm really confused... Help? (I'm running on Vista, if that means anything)"
,WChobbs,2008-08-12T02:40Z,"Download and install Daemon tools lite

http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

When installing, make sure you check the options carefully, there is an option to change your homepage and install a toolbar, best uncheck those unless you want them :)

It will also need to restart, so be prepared for that when you install it.

After it is installed you will have a Daemon Tools icon in your tray next to your clock, right click that icon for a menu.

Go to Virtual CD\DVD ROM, expand that and go to 
Device 0: [H:] Empty (H: is a drive letter, may be different for you) expand that and go to mount image.

Browse to where the ISO (or other image) is stored and select it.

Daemon Tools creates a virtual CD\DVD-ROM on your system, if you go to my computer you will notice you have a new optical drive, that is Daemon Tools, when you mount an image it is virtually putting a disk in that drive. You can go there to explore the disk. Autoplay should start as soon as you mount it."
,WChobbs,2008-08-12T02:48Z,"Alternatively, you can burn the images to a disk and install them. Look for alcohol 120% to burn them with, you can find it here on PB. 

But daemon tools is a great way to test them before you wast a disk :)"
