,-ScarZ-,2008-12-15T14:59Z,"OOH! This game looks really funny (downloading it now) i will see if it has got virus or not, but i don't think so, cuz ""Subzero!"" has got the green ""VIP"" skull with his name and i will trust him!"
,shaunchar,2009-02-28T02:40Z,"can some1 help me? i downloaded razor's version, but when i go to install it, just says that the wizard was interrupted! can some1 gather up instructuions for me?"
,Hitman_47_Agency,2009-03-15T20:18Z,"Well, there is no virus in here. Though everybody say they trust him because he got a green skull is another matter. Pink skull i trusted user, green skull is VIP. You can actully just donate a lot of money to piratebay and suddenly you're a VIP. I don't complain, it's a great game with no viruses, but for those who wonders, you shouldn't really trust a user 100% just because he got a fancy green skull. Good job ToeD."
,DJLoVe,2009-04-10T05:04Z,"great game tnx :D,all who think this has an virus or a trojan you should read the jaws.txt,its clearly said that some antiviruses might recognize the code as an virus or a trojan,but in fact its not so its safe :P "

I followed directions to the letter, clicked on _JAWS-START.EXE, And when I tried to hit ESC the fucking intro (which was annoying and sucked) wouldn't let me. After I forced it to close, I tried clicking the Jaws.exe, and promptly received an error stating ""some game files can not be found please reinstall""

Useless, utterly USELESS."
