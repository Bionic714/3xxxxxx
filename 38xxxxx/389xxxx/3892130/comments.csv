,PopArt,2007-11-15T01:46Z,"Serious 4X, I thought highly of you before.

But now I see you're ruining the pirate community of FS2004 / FSX.

Some guys are already leaving, because they don't feel like buying (yes, we ACTUALLY buy them) and sharing these add-ons anymore. If this continues you won't be able to enjoy these add-ons yourself. Is that what you wan't?

Please live up to the Pirate code-of-honor: we don't steal amongst ourselves."
,Cornshark,2007-11-15T03:55Z,"Alright.. I've just got to say something here.. I don't know what Wos is (somebody here called it Wus ??), and I don't know nuthing about 4X-AXG... So it seems I'm the most objective party here to comment on this:

If I had to chose, I'd have to side with 4X-AXG.. We're all pirates here. We give, take, share & steal all the same. What the fuck is the problem?? If youre not  a fuking pirate, you shouldn't be hanging around commenting on The PIRATE Bay. Get a fucking life already! Go .. join the police department or something. If youv got nothing to post here but the tears of your sobbing, fuck off and die cuz you are no pirates .. Your a bunch of fucking wanker cry babys.

4X-aXG: You do good things charing here, and very many of us appreciate it very much. Keep on sharing! Thanks

2 all utherz: FO&D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,luke97,2007-11-15T05:38Z,"Same opinion, PopArt. 
I always respected and thanked 4X-AXG for its releases, but today he demostrated heÂ´s just a child.
Its a pity."

,kharmann,2007-11-15T08:32Z,"FUCKWOS: Drink beer and shut up, you stupid ass!!

The guys will stop buying - and all of you are dead. The Pirate Community will be dead. 

Go on doing so... make suicide, assholes!"
,Cornshark,2007-11-15T09:04Z,"The Pirate Community was around long befor u were, asshole. Pirate communty has been around since the days of C=64 & Vic20 and  it will still be around long after you are stopped ""buying"" softwares. you dont know what your talking about. Stop sheding tears here and do something else, butthole!"
,N537JB,2007-11-15T14:09Z,"Cornshark, why are you even opening your mouth? First, learn to write, then come back. Second thing, you don't even know what WoS is so why the f*ck do you involve yourself in this?"
,Proctologist,2007-11-15T18:12Z,FUCKWOS AKA Eagle420 well what else can I say. You bring as much to this table as you did there which was alomost ZERO.

,4X-AXG,2007-11-15T22:04Z,"oh wow..poor kids! but okay, I will respond to you guys, hoping this will end up in a nice discussion..no screaming, no yelling, no calling eachother assholes and fucking jews, just a normal discussion

here we go!

@ PopArt:

Well, I gotta say, ditto. I thought highly of you before as well. You were THE Pirate Bay hero. You were extremely respected and well known all over the world. You shared amazing addons with everybody; black, white, poor, rich, young old. And then what happened? You left the Pirate Bay, you joined WoS and now you are releasing addons only to those who pay? The ones who don't pay can wait days or weeks? YOU should live up to the pirate code of honour: sharing is sharing for everbody, not selectively. What's next, making shares available for only males with blond hair and blue eyes? It's either all of nothing. THAT's what I'm fighting against, this whole 'VIP' nonsense. I have nothing personal against you, luke, hell, not even against eagle, 537, fergie and whoever is a WoS member. I'm not the none who is breaking pirate codes; WoS is.

@ Cornshark:

Thanks for the support

@ Luke:

again, the same message I just typed to PopArt. Sure I'm a child, especially compared to Fergie LOL. But you guys all take this personally. I'm not fighting you guys personally, I'm fighting your idealogy, your concept. You guys wanna 'defeat' me? It's so easy: share your addons with everybody instead of with so-called 'VIP's only.

FUCKWOS is not Eagle420. WoS may have a lot of friends, they sure do have a lot of enemies as well. FW is just one of them.

Now to everybody. I have been in scene for many years now. I have done well over a thousand posts, mainly to usenet. At least 75% of the addons that are being offered at WoS come either from me, PopArt, or have been shared at usenet or the Pirate Bay before. Does that make me God? No. Does that give me infinite respect? No. But it does give me the right to stand up for REAL pirates, pirates who share their addons with EVERYBODY. Especially PopArt knows exactly what I'm talking about; we are very similar, whether he likes it or not. Look at PopArt's shares here at the PB and you will find dozens and dozens of 'thank you's' at every single one of this posts. Nobody had to pay for them, he, just like me, shared them with everybody. That is what piracy is all about. No system that gives special treatment to a handful of people who either 'donate' or suck up. You are killing the piracy scene, not me. Treat everybody the same. And one last word about the whole 'give credit' issue. First off, of the dozens, possibly hundreds of addons I have shared at usenet and PB that appeared on WoS, I have seen credit towards TheFlyingDutchman or 4X-AXG maybe a handful of times. And I'm NOT complaining about that; credit is nice to get, but not necessary. But then don't expect me to give you credit if you don't me credit.

All summed up. Piracy is about sharing. For everybody, for anybody. For people who could be your best friends in reallife, for people you would hate. No selection, no preference for certain groups of people. Share your addons with everybody and the piracy scene will blossom like never before.

One final word for you WoS guys. Don't waste your time on the wrong things. Hunting for the 'mole' is useless. Yelling and screaming at me is useless. Fighting, wherever it may be, is useless. Share your addons and even more importantly, actually FLY Flight Simulator.

Let's become real pirates AND real pilots again.

4X-AXG, formerly known as TheFlyingDutchman"
,Cornshark,2007-11-15T22:14Z,"N537JB- 4X-AXG has shared more FS things here than probably anybody.. way more than you ever have or ever will! And you come here and wine about it ...... Stop your tears man! We are sharing what we got here.. no matter what the fuck Wos is. I don't need to know Wos man.. I don't care! Wos coul,d be God himself for all I can care, it doesn't matter. FUCK WOS!!

I speak the truth man. You should be banned for crying!

So now I see why this guy he calls himself FUCKWOS. haha  Like I say, all the rest can FO&D!"
,Cornshark,2007-11-15T22:23Z,"Well, it looks like my post came too late to beat 4X-AXGs sensible words! Go get em 4X!!!"
,N537JB,2007-11-15T22:28Z,"Cornshark give me a break dude. 

Yes he may have shared more than me, but, please take a look at his uploads.

If you take a look from page 1-3, how many uploads/releases are HIS own? AFAI see, there's around 3-4 releases that come from himself.. Where are the rest from?! Hm wait, let me thing.. A guess, WoS?


4x, you're totally full of crap. You're whining about credits and that and that yourself, but when every1 else are doing that, they can fuck themselves. 

Atleast many people know who you are now and what you have done.

Btw, Popart is still the king, together with WM (Sorry, you dont fit here;)"
,Cornshark,2007-11-15T22:57Z,"N537JB- Take a look at pages 4 through 7 dude! Yeah, how about that huh?  I'll give you a break.. I'll give you a break right across the bridge of your fuckin nose, winer! You are no pirate, only a crier. Go away and stop asking for breaks cuz you won't be getting any around here.
You don't even mention anything at the core of what 4X-AXG said. The credit issue was one of the smallest points he made, but that's what you pick to comment on? What a dummy. You're wrong and you know it, that's what it comes out to.

Hehe ..... all this and I still don't even know what Wos is. hahaha  I don't need to. I don't even want to to be truthful. 4X-AXG is looking more and more right the more you guys cry about this."
,Cornshark,2007-11-15T23:06Z,"Oh so now I see all about Wos! You want me to pay you so that I can have the proviledge of being graced with your shares on the site? Unbelievable.. that is same as the sites that charge you for their crack libraries! A real scam! Ill stay right here at TPB and share with those who share their warez. You don't deserve money. Talk about breaking the law.. that takes ""piracy"" to a new level. People get thrown in jail for selling pirated stuff on black market. Thats what your doing! Nobody ever got thrown in jail for SHARING. You better hope governments don't track your IPs cuz you're all going down if you keep that shit up. Your crazy!"

,montyburns70,2007-11-16T02:24Z,"Excuse me, isn't this about pimping Flight Simulator and enjoying it? There's so much hateful comments here, that's terrible!
One question, 4X-AXG: If keyno asked you to wait for one week so they can do their VIP thing at WoS, why couldn't you just do that?
If keyno has bought it with his money and this is what he wants I could have waited, no problem, everybody could be happy that way.
I appreciate all your uploads, 4X-AXG, and I appreciate you personally especially after what you wrote above. But could it be that you didn't wait because of vanity reasons?
Sorry, I'm just a thankful leecher and seeder! Happy landings!"
,Proctologist,2007-11-16T03:33Z,"FUCKWOS = Eagle420

As that old Cajun Cook used to say-----------------GUARANTEEEED!

;-)"
,FSSR.Keyno,2007-11-16T03:47Z,"Hmmm. Trying to figure out the major cause of all of this. I think i know what the problem is.

Feelings, peoples feelings are getting stepped on.

Why do people share? To make others happy. I make good money and i share my uploads to the ones that can't afford it. I feel good when people are happy with my shares.

I used to belong to FSSR. But that only invited site stopped buying and sharing. (Flight Simulator Share Reactor). So i went to WoZ(Wings of Silence). It took awhile but i donated, felt weird at first, but felt better later. 
Its just money, really just trump change($5.99)

I have spent over $500 of my own money sharing FS addons, since FS2002. So $6 bucks ain't nothing. A dozen members over at WoZ are  some really nice guys, like me, sharing. So i put my share in the VIP room, for the guys who donated to WoZ. Its my share, and i think i have the right when i want it released to 100+ FSimmers, who will not say thank you or ever buy anything to share.

People talking shit on WoZ doesn't make me happy. Its my group of friends. So please stop it.
Live and let live.

4X is my friend, still. I like him, because he takes the time to share others, who don't have the time to do it them selves.

Again feelings, people who are sharing don't wana feel like a joke is on them.

This FS community has the chance to be something better than this. A high % of you guys i'd have a beer with and shoot some pool.

They say all good things come to end, hopefully this FS sharing community won't.

I'd like to hear, ""This came for Keyno or PopArt or Boss from WoZ"" ""thanks for the share WoZ"" Or from the original owner.

 I'd rather have friends than enemies, so respect others and lets share and feel good about it. 

Class, todays word is Respect.

This such a great hobby to have.

Ciao

,SmashFlash,2007-11-16T09:46Z,N537JB These guy's have been around way before WoS even got started. Dude and I am even a member over there and with the way I see it 4X is right why am I lining the pocket of someone I don't even know. Ya he buy's add on  shares em but only for you the vip that has paid for it! with him getting cash on the side! I hope my membership over at WoS goes off since I have seen this!

,N537JB,2007-11-16T09:55Z,"LOL, Cornie, where do you think he got 2/3 of all those addons on page 4-7 ... let me guess? A thing called Newsgroup maybe? - yea yea you can go on with your BS. I've been here far far longer than you have, so I KNOW what I am talking about (Compared to others here).
And why should I reply to ruuds shit reply? He's just trying to escape from the shit with that crap of talk. Unfortunately, he won't make it :)

Steve I had respect for you be4, but it seems like u became a son of a bitch to 4x, so stfu yourself ;-)"
,N537JB,2007-11-16T09:58Z,"Smash, if you are a member of WoS, then you should know that you don't HAVE TO pay. You can be a regular member aswell. I can't understand why everyone is complaining about WoS when WF (no offence to you guys over there) has the same priority?! I didn't pay to get a VIP member over there. By doing great stuff, you get great stuff back."
[T],stevekasian,2007-11-16T12:27Z,"N537JB: BFD. I couldn't care less whether or not you have, or have ever had, any respect for me. You don't know me and I don't know you. You're nothing more than a username on here, just like everyone else... including 4X.

I don't know 4X from Adam, but as Cornboy pointed out above, he seems to be the most clear-headed party (as well as Keyno in his later post) to this whole bitch-fest you've started here. All I go by is what users do & say here. If they act like fools making dumbass comments, upload torrents without seeding them, or try to upload the actual file they're trying to share instead of the .torrent file (LOL), I'll call 'em on it every time... and I actually laugh out loud as I do it, because it's fucking hillarius. It's entertainment. It makes me smile. :D

I don't live in your fantasy world of imaginary ""screenname"" friends on the internet. I come here to take care of business and that's it. Sometimes that business involves bitch-slapping a bunch of dumbasses around a little bit to get 'em to wise up - to help keep things running smoothly here at TPB. Other times it doesn't. Either way, it's all in the name of FUN. When it becomes un-fun, I no longer take part. It should be that way for everyone. It's called ""NOT TAKING YOUR COMPUTER TOO SERIOUSLY"". You shoud try it sometime. No, really... you should!

If you are such a loser that you allow your entire world to come crashing down around you because someone shared some bullshit that you shared on some BBS 1 week ago, which you never intended to go any further, then you are quite simply a dolt - a stupid, dumbass, idiotic fool who deserves whatever bitch-slapping comes your way, be it from me, 4X or anyone else, because that's just what happens on the internet. (You should know this by now, since you've ""been around here for so long"".) There's nothing you can do about it. It's the nature of the beast. It's what happens on the internet, and it's as simple as that.

Now at this point, you appear to be that dolt. So just grow the fuck up and stop your bitching. Go fly your fucking flight simulator for cripes sake. Have some fun!! Holy fucking shiza man."
,N537JB,2007-11-16T14:07Z,"LOL yes, I really do see who is taking his PC too seriously.. By writing those long essays (yes they call it that nowadays;), you don't come far.

I have my opinion and you have yours. 

Oh yes, really? You don't take sides anymore? Why are you defending him? Jeeeeez=>i-love-to-bitch-for-4x-axg.

Oh no, whole my life is gone now, that guy uploaded a thing without giving credits, oh no. I'll be dying now. haha. (You see, there's differences between us. For example, I don't take this seriously, but you do).

And me a dolt? hm, let me think. You say; Don't take the PC's too seriously; Still you write an essay. Hm what more. ""Oh no I'm not on anyone's side"" => ""I love to defend you"". Please be a little more discreet if you can.

Though, there is one thing you are right on. I don't know you, and neither would I like to!"

Thnx for 4X and ALL the others who makes flightsim more fun via TPB and other sources, whoever they are!

Like *we* (the many anonymous simpilots) care who's made it all possible. Credits, who give it a shit? Maybe selfish, I rest my case. Hell, it's the real world. Like it or not.

IMHO: Most so called *addons* don't deserve any dime they ask for, but some do! Like PMDG, LevelD, a lot of Aerosoft stuff and so on I've bought afterwards. Yah, thanks to the pirates here at TPB! ;-)

,Husky42,2007-12-27T11:11Z,"BE AWARE:

What 4X-AXG does is like Fairlight stealing something from Razor or Deviance.

This would not happen within groups, it is about competition. All 4X-AXG has managed to do was alienate himself as a non team player and thief.

This would not have been accepted years ago. A child to the game 4X-AXG will continue to steal. But be aware, he has never released a file that was not released elsewhere first.

He has never purchased and sold, or donated to help a cause. He is the lowest of the lowest when it comes to file sharers and in no way deserves any form of respect. He does not even know how to give appropriate credit.

4X-AXG you are nothing more then a pathetic fucking thief."

THANk you so much for a lot of your great uploads.  You are one of the few individuals I know I can doanload from and know it is not a fake file or something harnessed with viruses and crap.

Have you or anyone else here access to the Feelthere Airbus series volume 1 and 2?  I know there are older versions uploaded, but the current versions are ""3b"" for Vol. 1 and ""1d"" for Vol. 2.  These aren't public downloads so it's not as simple as downloading an upgrade or patch like other Feelthere/Wilco products.

I'll seed and assist in every way possible with these two products if I can get hold of them somehow initially."

,flightcrazy,2008-01-28T00:10Z,"HUSKY42:

When an individual such as yourself signs up on a torrent website such as this, it is becuase you wish to download *PIRATED* software.

Calling another member, especially 4X-AXG (or many other great uploaders) something like this is a childish act. Not only because we *ALL* download software, but becuase we, every signle one of us are thiefs.

In many cases, i am sure you would not class yourself as one, as you probably don't upload. But just downloading pirated software itself is a petty crime, something only a thief would do. 

Think of 4X-AXG (and the other great up's) as someone that can pinpoint to the last detail exactly what it is you wish to have, and things inwhich he feels of help to the community.

Everytime you download (even log onto a torrent website) you're IP address is logged. Meaning, that you have a username and email address, you yourself are a pathetic, no good for nothing piece of shit. 












































































































































































I myself couldnt give a rats ass about protected files, im just happy to recieve files such as these to add on to my ever growing collection of FS9 add-ons (most of them by 4X-AXG).
