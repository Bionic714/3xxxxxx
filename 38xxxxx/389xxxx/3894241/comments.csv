,totalhack,2007-12-18T04:03Z,just to clarify. this is the U.S. version.
,totalhack,2007-12-19T02:29Z,"more than likely those of you who are having problems its because you are confused on the update process. during install qb asks if you want to check for updated files. if you click yes it will say you have the most up to date files. so then proceed like normal. and finish installing.

DO NOT COPY THE FEATURES.DLL file yet.

now start up quickbooks and select which version you want. quickbooks will setup the version you want and then close.

now start qb again. once the program has started select the ""help"" menu and select update. follow the update process. 

ONCE YOU ARE FULLY UPDATED COPY THE FEATURES.DLL FILE

,PrimalFear,2007-12-20T00:37Z,"Having the same issue with the ""the procedure entry point ?GetOneAvailableRecNum@@YGJXZ could not be located in the dynamic lin library qbtool32.dll."" 
I followed the instructions to the T.
Installed, started, Closed
Started again, updated, closed.
Copied DLL file after renaming old one, still no joy.
Perhaps QB has a update that kills this?"
,Jdav1,2007-12-20T02:30Z,I agree. Quickbook has fixed this glith. I have tried and downloaded almost 4 different crack and none of them work. They all give the same error. Uninstalling/Reinstalling the software several times. Even before the update if you change the feature.dll file you will still get the same error message. No one currently has the fix for this online as I have done extensive search.
,PrimalFear,2007-12-20T20:56Z,"Thanks for the confirmation Jdav1, thought I was missing something & you just saved me from installing it again.
I suggest all you peeps spread the news so some smart geek can have a Crack at it, pun intended. :) "
,DaBag,2007-12-21T02:28Z,"Try this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3941999/crack.exe

,PrimalFear,2007-12-28T17:25Z,"DaBag: The crack that comes with QB on this page actually works, it's when you install the updates that the programs fails. So basically there probably the same crack or at very least accomplish the same thing. Not sure though, anyone want to pony in..."
,XweAponX,2007-12-29T01:51Z,"The deal with these Ituit Programs is that you have to perform any UPDATES WHEN THE PROGRAM Tells you they are available... Right after you install it.

I ran across this same thig with QuickDicks 2007... If I did not perform the update right away after I installed it, I could not download it later.

Thats how these cracks work."
,DaBag,2007-12-30T12:15Z,"PrimalFear - I agree... i think they both accomplish the same thing.  XweAponX - with QB 2007, you are not forced to perform the updates; you just have to click Install Later every time you run the program."
,vand3r,2007-12-31T07:31Z,"This is how to get this to work:

Follow all directions EXCEPT dont download any updates via QuickBooks.  Download only THIS update from their website: http://sharedld.intuit.com/pub/quickbooks/2007/r6/   its the R6 update, which the crack only works on.  Install this update, replace the features.dll and turn off automatic updates.  All set.  Worked for me."
,dustonio,2007-12-31T09:05Z,"The link (and crack) mentioned by DaBag worked (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3941999/crack.exe).  Just don't install updates, other than the critial updates."
,blkvenm,2008-01-09T11:24Z,"Ok, nice instructions. Correct me if I'm wrong Step 5 says go to folder where FEATURES.DLL is located which is QuickBooks 2007.  Then step 6 says to rename FEATURES.DLL to FEATURES.DLL.original meanwhile the file is still in the same directory QuickBooks 2007.  Step 7 says to copy the new FEATURES.DLL which I just renamed to FEATURES.DLL.original, now there lies the problem the file is already in the directory and it is renamed so how am I supposed to copy this new FEATURES.DLL file which does not exist anymore because I just renamed it to the folder it was already in?  Follow me?"
,protongeek,2008-01-10T21:25Z,blkvnm - Your confused. You need to take the FEATURES.dll file that is located within the QuickBooks download directory ( Location where you downloaded Quickbooks from thepiratebay.org )and copy that FEATURES.dll file into the QuickBooks installation directory. Remember you renamed the original FEATURES.dll to FEATURES.dll.original. This is so you have a backup .dll file I believe. I realise these guys are not very thorough with there installation instructions. I too have difficulty with there instructions and I have been in IT for 10years. Some cracks are great and others less desireable.
,protongeek,2008-01-10T21:28Z,"It would be great if someone would post the new correct installation instructions that are thorough and from a successful installation.

Thanks."
,Sparky68,2008-01-11T15:27Z,"Okay so after much aggravation, I FINALLY GOT IT!!! Download the torrent and get it installed by which ever means you deam suitable. I'll just cover what I did to get it to work. 

First Props to Vand3r, This link is the KEY, http://sharedld.intuit.com/pub/quickbooks/2007/r6/ . 

Okay Here we go.....
After the install Start the program and select which version you want.
Then Close the program.
Then Run the update you get from the link above(make sure you've already downloaded it).
Then Rename your Features.dll to Features.dll.original
Open QB again and it will ask you if you want to install recently downloaded updates, CHOOSE INSTALL LATER.
Now that screen will come up EVERYTIME you open QB.
What I did was with QB open I went to the Help tab, and choose update Quickbooks. this brings up a pop up screen, you'll notice that the auto update is probablly turned on. Click the options tab and turn it off there. ALSO take note of the download folder, Mine was C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Intuit\QuickBooks 2007\Components. There you will find a folder named DownloadQB17, I renamed that folder to DownloadQB17.old. NO MORE INSTALL NOW SCREEN AT START UP.

Hope This Helps
Sparky"
,Sparky68,2008-01-11T15:38Z,"I forgot one Step, It goes after the rename Features.dll. 
There is a cracked version of that Dll floating around, I'm not sure which torrent it came from because I've pretty much downloaded every QB torrent Available to try and get this to work. FIND IT YOU'LL NEED IT. Get it before you start this process. Mine was in a .RAR file.
After you rename the original .DLL file. Extract the cracked .DLL from the .RAR file I just mentioned to your default directory for QB. Mine was C:\Program Files\Intuit\QuickBooks 2007. Then follow the steps in my previous post.

One Word I did not have to repair like others have mentioned. Follow my steps and G/L
let me know how it worked for you

,protongeek,2008-01-16T06:24Z,It works success at last. You cannot update this during the install. I am going to test it out by updating it now I know it works and see if it continues to suppress the 30 day trial.

,evaluator1,2008-06-27T10:47Z,"I finally got this to work after many attempts on vista.

tip: if you messed up once, you should totally wipe away its existance before trying again:
- erase the 'intuit' folders from c/program files and c/program data (hidden)
-scan and del with a registry cleaner (like CCleaner which is free/gpu)
- run>regedit....than go through directories lookin for any thing intuit/quickbooks...look for quickbook files types .q** and get them too. (thanks to Interlopoko for that suggestion)

installing:
-disconnect from internet (just hit the button on your modem if applicable/if not, pull chord)
-burn to disk or open a virtual drive using poweriso (rg-qb27p.bin file, btw)
-run installation exe...deny all update oppertunities
-after install, OPEN and select your type (ie manufacturing/wholesale)...this is where i think i was messing up cuz peeps were saying not to open until after install or just open and close. NO, select your type now, cuz if you do it later, you get the error.
-while open go to help>update>turn off all..then close
-run the updates 6 (download qbwebpatch from sparky earlier on thread)
-I restarted after this point(donno if you have to, but can't hurt)
-Now, go to c/programfiles/intuit/quickbooks2007 and rename features.dll to features.dll.old
-Extract the new 'feature.dll' from Intuit.QuickBooks.Premier.2007.R6.Registration.Crack-BEAST INTO YOUR c/program files/intuit/quickbooks2007 to replace the one you just renamed (use winrar or other compression agent for this file)

Just run setup.exe in the root directory to install .net framework."
,BPMonster,2008-08-23T20:27Z,"OK, this procedure is for this torrent.  However, the principals apply for all Quickbook installations.

Note:  This bin/cue file is for Year 2007, Rev. 0.  You will have to download an update file. Shut down the Internet.  install Quickbooks. Run Quickbooks. Turn off Automatic Updates. Run the update file.  Keep Automatic Updates permanently turned off.  Enjoy.  

The steps are described
in more detail below.

1-  If you previously have installed Quickbooks, search all of your hard disks for remnants of Quickbooks and delete.
   Quickbooks uninstall is notoriously incomplete.

2-  Get PowerIso.

3-  Create a ""virtual drive"" using PowerIso.

4-  Mount the small .cue file to your new virtual drive.

5-  Double-click the drive to open up the contents of the disk.

6.  Disable your Internet Connection.

7-  Click setup to install.

8-  Run your regular installation process. (when it asks you the first time if you want to download installation files, choose NO)  Use License: 9636-9458-4939-500, Product: 809-384.

9-  Install the version you need (Retail business, etc...)

10- It is going to ask you to update again- choose NO.

11- After your version is installed, open the program and turn off the automatic updates.

12- Choose NO UPDATE anytime it asks you.

13- Close out of any installation windows.  Enable Internet.

14- Obtain patch for Rev. 6 from http://ftp.quicken.com/pub/quickbooks/2006/r6/

15- Disable Internet.

16- Execute the patch, qbwebpatch.exe.

17- Rename FEATURES.DLL in the Quickbooks directory.

18- Open up on your hard drive Program Files -> Intuit -> Quickbooks 2007, and drag the new FEATURES.DLL file into that folder.

19- Open Quickbooks and enjoy.

20- But do NOT do any further updates or turn on Automatic Update.  If you do, you will be back with a trial version.  This FEATURES.DLL only works with Rev. 6.

Note:

Here is how to tell what version of Quickbooks you have.

1.  Open Quickbooks

2.  Choose Help/Update Quickbooks.  In the Update Quickbooks Window, you will see a number in the format of
    xy.x.xxxz.x.  X = ignore.  Y is the last number of the year, i.e. 7 = 2007, Z is the revision number.

20- But do NOT do any further updates or turn on Automatic Update.  If you do, you will be back with a trial version.  This FEATURES.DLL only works with Rev. 6.

Note:

Here is how to tell what version of Quickbooks you have.

1.  Open Quickbooks

2.  Choose Help/Update Quickbooks.  In the Update Quickbooks Window, you will see a number in the format of
    xy.x.xxxz.x.  X = ignore.  Y is the last number of the year, i.e. 7 = 2007, Z is the revision number.

I followed what appeared to be the right instructions (kill internet, install, no updates, select edition, turn off updates, try and install web updates)

I tried installing R5 after I had given up and it worked fine. I'm confused but I will try uninstalling and starting over"
,kurt2439,2008-08-25T14:48Z,"So I uninstalled quickbooks, searched the registry for ""intuit"" and deleted all keys until it found nothing else, ran CCleaner to delete any other registry keys, deleted the progamdata/intuit, program files/intuit and users/me/AppData/Roaming/intuit /users/me/appdata/local/intuit folders. 

Then I Install QB2007, had the internet off teh whole time, opened it, selected contractor edition, turned off auto updates, then tried the web patch but it still says ""You are attempting to update a different version of quickbooks"" or something to that effect

WTF? Anyone have this problem and know how to fix it? I'm on Vista 32 bit"

,kpslick,2009-01-10T17:16Z,"Hi everyone.  I have been reading all the comments and have noticed that a LOT of people have been having trouble with this install.  I am running vista and have just installed with no problem.  Below are the steps I took.

First of all you will need to either burn this torrent file onto a disc or mount the image on a virtual drive.  I prefer to mount images as it saves wasting a disc.  To do this I recommend Deamon Tools.  Just google it and download the lite version.  It's free, so just download and install.  After it has installed you should see the icon in the system tray.  It will be a red box with a lightning bolt through it.  
You also need winrar to extract the crack file later on.  Winrar is like winzip, it just extracts files that have been compressed for ease of use.  You can find a copy of winrar on thepiratebay.org.  Just search for it, download and install.

So now that you have your virtual drive installed (dont worry, i'll explain how to use it later) and Winrar, you need 3 files to get this program to work.  We will download all of the files we need first, then worry about installing them after.

So, the files you need are;

1.  The file from this torrent.  Click 'DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT'.

2.  You also need to download the update file from here - http://ftp.quicken.com/pub/quickbooks/2006/r6/

3.  And last, you need to download the crack file from here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3894203/Intuit.QuickBooks.Premier.2007.R6.Registration.Crack-BEAST

KEEP NOTE OF WHERE THESE FILES ARE DOWNLOADED TO ON YOUR MACHINE.

Now, let's get installing.  (Just to be safe, disconnect your internet NOW.  We DO NOT want the program to update!)

1.  Right click on the deamon tools icon, a pop up list should appear.  Move your mouse up to Virtual CD/DVD ROM and hover over it, another window will appear.  Now move your mouse over Device 0: [F:] Empty, then click 'mount image' from the next pop up window.  Now browse until you find where you downladed this torrent file.  It is called - QuickBooks.Premier.2007 + Crack.  Double click it.  You will now see a file named rg-qb27p.cue.  Double click it.  There, the image is now mounted.  If you have autoplay enabled, it should pop up now.  Select 'open folder to view files'.  If autoplay is not enabled or doesn't pop up, your new virtual drive will be visible in 'my computer' right next to your existing CD drive.  It should be called F drive and it will appear just like you have 2 CD drives on your computer.  Right click it and select explore.

2.  Now you will see 5 folders and a setup.exe icon.  Open the crack folder and copy down the license and product codes.  They are;
License: 9636-9458-4939-500
Product: 809-384

3.  Now close this and click the setup.exe icon and install the program as you like.  DO NOT update.  Deny if it asks you.  Not that it will be a problem if you have disconnected your internet, but deny anyway.

4.  After it has installed, run the program.  When you first start it will ask you what version you want to use ie. contractor edition/wholesale edition etc.  Select what version is appropriate for you.  Now, after I did this step, the program shut down.  If it does for you, just restart it again.  

5.  Now, ignore everything else on the screen and go to help, update quickbooks, click the options tab and selct NO for automatic update.  Now click save and then close down the entire program.

6.  Now we need to run the update that we downloaded earlier from http://ftp.quicken.com/pub/quickbooks/2006/r6/
Go to where you downloaded it to your computer.  Mine goes to downloads.  The file will be called qbwebpatch.exe.  Double click it and follow the instructions.

7.  After the update has finished, we need to install the crack.  First thing to do is navigate to the location on your computer where the quickbooks program files are.  This should be -  c/programfiles/intuit/quickbooks2007.  This folder will be full of various different files.  The one you want is called FEATURES.DLL  Right click this file and click r"
