Crionics are a blackened death metal band from Poland founded in 1997 in the city of KrakÃ³w by MichaÅ? Skotniczy, Dariusz StyczeÅ?, "Marcotic" and Maciej ZiÄ?ba. In their early years they played fast and melodic music under the strong influence of Norwegian black metal band Emperor.

A year after the band formed, they recorded five songs. This material has never been released because of its bad production. Six months later the band recorded their first demo. It contained four tracks, including "I am the Black Wizards", cover of Emperor. In 1999 Crionics engaged Bartosz Bielewicz as a guitarist. Bielewicz contributed to the second band's demo Beyond the Blazing Horizon, recorded in a home studio. In 2000 Maciej Kowalski replaced the current drummer, Maciej ZiÄ?ba. In August 2002 the first studio album, entitled Human Error: Ways to Selfdestruction was released. With the start of 2004, Crionics released the second album, Armageddon's Evolution. In 2007 their third and latest album Neuthrone was resleased.
