Well, my children, I did as threatened and dug around in storage and came up with 22 more CD's of medieval music. Track information and cover art may therefore not be available for all of them. I went and checked at Amazon.com for each one to verify that they were out of print; some are available used, one was listed for SIXTY DOLLARS (!) and some simply didn't exist. These are lost treasures. Keep them well for me.

To save time and space, I ripped these at 320 kb rather than in Windows Lossless. As before, there are five torrents in total. This one includes:

Adam de la Halle- Le Jeu de Robin et Marian (Ensemble Perceval)
Ars Magis Subtiliter: Secular Music from the Chantilly Codex (Ensemble PAN)
Sacred Bridge- Jews and Christmas in Medieval Europe (Boston Camerata)
Lo Gai Saber (Camerata Mediterranea)

Be certain to download my other torrents of medieval and archaic music! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!
