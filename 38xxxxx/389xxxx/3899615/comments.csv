,michaelthegeek,2008-05-15T00:03Z,you can put it on a disk by using Nero (Nero express Essentials) and it should burn it to a disk if you don't have Nero download it or just barrow it from a friend you cant install Nero on as many computers  as you want and it very popular so there should be someone that has it if any of you have any more questions pleas e-mail me at mjfisonline@mail.com
,michaelthegeek,2008-05-15T00:10Z,sorry i meant you can install it on as many computers as you want
