,theblacknumenorean,2007-11-15T00:20Z,I forgot to tell you that you must run wavelab in compatibility mode xp sp 2. Right-click on Wavelab-app.exe in your wavelab folder and check the compatibility mode.

Genius...."
,bearcy,2007-12-28T14:42Z,"If you haven't got Steinberg WaveLab 5.01b, you should download this torrent instead.

It also has got included this Vista-fix that you'll find above."
,Kojones,2008-01-22T23:06Z,"Waiting for wavelab 6.1 (or an upgrade). Fore those who are interested: THAT IS THE ONLY VERSION IN WITCH THE WAVES L3-16 WILL WORK AS A VST!!!
hope we don't have to wait too long."
,Fito33,2008-02-04T17:07Z,"If this works, I'll give you a hugh and a kiss, If I was a woman or gay, and this works, I'd suck you dick!"
,Fito33,2008-02-04T17:24Z,"And it works! I have tested several usaes that I know, and man it works great, I'm so grateful m8, I'm gonna keep this on my seed (I usually erase after doing my share) so others can feel as happy as I to find this genius work of yours."
,Kojones,2008-03-11T17:55Z,"Desperatly seeking for wavelab 6.01. In this version it will be possible to
work with waves L3-16 for mastering. In prior versions of wavelab it is not possible. (don't believe anyone who says it is possible).
Thanx !!"

thanks"
,saxo08,2008-06-15T00:07Z,"Another thing that might occur as a problem with the combination of Wavelab 5 and Vista, but fortunately seems solvable, is that after the otherwise successful installation and first usage of Wavelab, it could not find any CD/DVD burner devices although other apps do. After some browsing I found the site www.frogaspi.org. Download the file from there, rename it according to instructions and copy to C:\Windows\System32 (you might not have had the WnAspi32.dll there earlier but perhaps in other locations, anyway it seems that it anyway should be in the System32 directory in order to make it work). Restart Wavelab and you might now see your CD/DVD device in the dropdown of the Write CD dialog."
,nolan3034,2008-08-06T02:34Z,You're a genius. Thank you!!!!
,el_thompson,2008-09-10T20:31Z,any ideas where to find a proper cracked Wavelab 6?
,PhoenixML,2008-09-15T19:35Z,"It still crashes. I installed 5.01b, and I copied both files and whever I do ""open"" or ""save as"" it still crashed.

If I try to open the application in the program files, it says that there is a problem with CommonVcPh.dll. If I try to run the program with the shrotcut on the desktop, there is no problem until I click on ""open"".

tried with winxp sp2 compatibility and without, no difference."
[T],yellow_sunshine,2008-10-25T03:29Z,thanks a lot :o)
,diarreetkever,2008-11-30T11:59Z,"Hey numenorean,

I really want to thank you for this fix man!
Greetings from the Netherlands!"
,onanetvoya,2009-03-26T18:09Z,Thanks for your work ... HOWEVER ... it does not seem to work on Windows 7. Could you try to repeat your magic again and fix this for us Windows 7 users? Vista sucks and I have never installed it and I never will.
,Dan2999,2009-04-05T01:52Z,I did exactly what you wrote and still does not work.  Can you suggest anything else that I could try?  Thanks a lot!  Daniel
,HowlinHusky,2009-04-12T12:29Z,"Works great !!!
& well to follow instructions. This saves me a lot of wordk and time, because I had it running on another PC & on XP!

So: I owe you one! "
,bearcy,2010-04-04T19:38Z,"
