
A 2 hour documentary about challenging situations and emergencies performed in a special flight simulator with real pilots.

 
Using a special, full-size Boeing 737NG cockpit and with the participation of real world pilots, Cockpit Secrets features simulated situations that you can never (or very rarely) see on real flights or in other cockpit videos. The documentary explains that there are precise procedures for virtually every emergency, and flying remains absolutely safe - even in case of failures or challenging weather conditions.
