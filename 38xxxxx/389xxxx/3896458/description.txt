Commentary on the international political stage and the reality of the modern media. The director has not only misled and manipulated politicians from his homeland Denmark but from all corners of the world in this provocative and thought-provoking satire.

With a hidden wink at JFK, AFR is the ultimate reconstruction of a political murder in which the whole truth never emerges and about which a variety of theories circulate. With his documentary about an alleged attack on the Prime Minister by a young anarchist, the Dane Morten Hartz Kaplers is continually looking for the ethical boundaries of the medium film itself and with it of the media in general.Using an enormous arsenal of existing archive material of political leaders throughout the world, he composes a perfect investigative documentary in which fictional evidence by close friends of both victim and culprit create the necessary credibility. While the most wide ranging possibilities - from political plot to crime passionnel - are considered, the director is of course not interested in what the truth is. With a convincing analysis that has misled and manipulated many politicians in Denmark and abroad, he demonstrates above all that whoever has the power - be it the politicians, the media magnate, the film maker - can force through any truth. This makes AFR an original satire on the modern world and a warning for the ease with which even alert viewers can allow themselves to be convinced by â??factsâ?? that are as fictional as they are worrying. In the end, the film is a passionate plea to maintain honest democracy and freedom of expression. (SdH)
