Too bad :)"
,Tolstojevski,2008-07-16T19:01Z,"Yeah, pirating indie games... Way to go... I live in a third world country, money is very tight, and the price on this was still no prob. If you got a PC and net you can afford it. I don't mind pirating big corps and people who try to rip you off, but this sucks man. Big time. Sami (the maker of this soft) is a great man, and the amount of work he put into this deserves the price tag very well. Plus you can buy a bloody single version for 3 dollars. 3! Whats your excuse for stealing? Bloody idiots."
,NetherAngel,2008-07-23T00:28Z,"I totally agree with you on that, but on the other hand I do not know if the next 'big' update is coming tomorrow or in another year.
Surplus, will the game be updated out of bugs?

Still, I do find that you are right, downloading is just easyer.

(I am actually already considering registration, but hush... I dont want anyone to know and I want to know what the game gives after those darned 10 days... ^^)


TO THE MAKER OF UNREAL WORLD!!!
Please do make a possibility to regain your (time-limit-killed-) character after registration, it is one of the most frustrating things out there to lose the first adventurer in a game like this, CERTAINLY due to registration. 
It made me nearly let the game screw off, but currently I'm trying to find out the registration stuff/waiting for a new version so I have the most out of purchase :)

(Is there a RSS feed on news about URW?)"

Trust me, the version I bought years ago was, for me, at 100%. Sami just keeps going upwards:). Yeah, it sucks a bit to miss out on a major update, but perhaps give a shot to the single version license to see if you indeed enjoy it, and then save up for the lifetime reg? This is the one game that is actually a part of my reinstall kit, windows->drivers->utils->urw, so I am quite hearty in standing up for it:-). Worth every dime, plus you got superb support from Sami. The dude somehow manages to answer each mail I send before 24 hours pass. And its going places, a borderless zoomed in map and custom buildings where fantasy back in the day;). "
,centime,2008-09-20T23:52Z,"Tolstojevski, what are you doing here if you are against downloading this torrent for free?

I agree with supporting the people who work so hard to bring us great software, but a lot of times the demo doesn't give you enough of an idea of whether you want to purchase the game or not.  So you download the thing, give it a good trial, and then - even simply out of gratitude - you buy the license.  That's what I do, anyway.

If you know of a place to get software for $3 US I'd like to know about it!  Perhaps at a second-hand store, if you are lucky.  Then, it doesn't come with the manual or box or anything, and the titles you find in the second-hand stores suck anyway, lol.

Again, why are you here?  Perhaps you are a spy, or someone with a stake in something that compels you to come and try to persuade people here that ""stealing"" is wrong.  Oh, but its okay if it is done to ""big corps and people who try to rip you off"".   Don't you think that is kind of hypocritacle.

How about people who have purchased the license, but want to be able to run the game/utility/whatever without the disk in the drive?  Like me, in certain situations.

People pirate for all kinds of reasons; of cousrse, in addition to the ones I have stated above, there is always the ""I just want it"" or the ""Why not?""

But please don't come here - for whatever reason - and accuse folks of stealing, and call us ""bloody idiots"", when you don't know that everyone is doing that.  Some of us want to save disks, or be able to try software out that isn't crippled, and fully intend to buy the license.  There is even one game that lets you play the demo for ten minutes.  TEN MINUTES!  You can't even get the controls down in ten minutes!

Now what would be wrong with downloading the full version of that, then trying it out realistically, then buying the license if you like it.  Anyone who doesn't like it enough to buy the license won't be using it anymore anyway.

Oh, and as far as ""If you got a PC and net you can afford it"" goes, my PC was a gift, and my internet connection is free.  I live on a fixed income ($339/month) because I am disabled.  Don't tell me what I can afford and what I can't, and don't tell me what I should and shouldn't do.  If you don't like what people do here, don't be here.

And Again, why are you here???

Sorry about this rambling diatribe.  Again, if you don't want to download things here, don't.  but don't come and leave a comment calling us names and casting aspertions.  Okay?

Have a nice day :)"
,Tolstojevski,2008-10-06T04:00Z,"Centime, firstly, the place you can get this software for 3 dollars is at the authors site. He is probably aware that a lot of people can not afford much and is offering a single version license for the exact price. 
Secondly, I am not at all against pirating, I myself am a reverser and a ripper. I am against ripping off small, indie, folk. I do not mind ripping a new one on the big corps, and I have cracked and ripped quite a few of their apps.    
And, as third, even us crackers (at least the ones I know) frown upon commencing attacks against the indie folk. You will never see a proper cracking group publishing cracks for indie games. Why? Because there are a few people on the other end and a few sold legal copies could make the difference between seeing a new version of the soft or halting the production. Take this game for an example, if a few of us really started working on it you would have a crack rest assured, there is yet to be a protection that can not be bypassed. And you have a few leaked versions and cracks of very dubious quality. Again, why? Because everyone with good enough smarts to crack refuses to touch indies who offer good softs at good prices. 
I am very sorry to hear you are disabled and living off such little income, but I hope you understand why I am defending this indie.  
After all, even us pirates got some morals:).          "
,centime,2008-10-12T14:43Z,"Tolstojevski, I have to say fair play to you for responding to my ascerbic comment (with all the typos!  You got me worked up, you did :)

I also have to apologize for being so nasty.  I guess I just took issue with certain assumptions (and then there was the name calling, lol) 

I absolutely understand your defending the developer of this title, and believe it or not, I agree with you.  Its the same reason I drink my coffee at Solstice in the University District in Seattle instead of Starbucks.  Support the hard-working ""little guys"".  Without a doubt.

I still meant what I said about trying before I buy.  I will acknowledge the fact, however, that the majority of people who download software for free never intend to buy a license for it.  I just have to know that I am going to want a game before I spend money on it, and I have been disappointed a few times by an incomplete or miserably short demo that didn't give me a realistic idea of a game that ended up as a coaster on my coffee table.  

So perhaps I have a different motive than some downloaders.  $3 is no risk for me, though, and if I could get this game for that little money, there would be no reason to download the torrent.

I googled the title to see if I could order the game directly from the developer, but couldn't find a site.  Any thoughts?

Thanks for being reasonable in your reply :)"
,jacknitro,2008-12-19T10:52Z,Not going to happen. At least it's only 3 dollars.

,Logrin,2012-01-03T07:10Z,"Hey Cryssorel. Great torrent. 

I was wondering if it would be too much to ask of you to put up the newer version? Combat among other things has been vastly improved.

The old registration doesn't work for the newer build."
