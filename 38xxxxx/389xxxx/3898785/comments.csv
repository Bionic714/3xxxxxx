this is in memory of Stephen Allmark XX and i dedicate this to you my precious darling. you did once exist on this earth and will allways and forever be close to me..your steve xx"
,portis40,2007-11-20T07:19Z,"Just remember this is NOT DVD quality, folks...Seeder just re-encoded an Xvid he found on PB."
,hotvette123,2007-11-21T13:10Z,"again portis  why be silly at least this has been availiable to share..weather it was originaly decoded from cowdung who cares,,apparently you did enough to make a comment..download it then comment on the quality !!"
[T],oddeven,2007-11-22T13:18Z,hotvette123 -can I ask why there are two identical looking posts of this DVD? Shouldn't everybody be focused on one (if they are the same)?
,verbatim2,2007-11-22T22:12Z,portis40: is the Xvid still available on PB? I'd rather download that file.
,verbatim2,2007-11-22T22:14Z,"hotvette123: Please seed again. There are numerous of downloaders stuck at 12.13 % now, but no seeder."
,Psychonauyen,2007-11-26T22:56Z,"Ehh... 12.1%, Pleez zeed."
[T],oddeven,2007-11-30T18:49Z,"My impression is that this is an advertisement for a dead boyfriend.  Pardon me, but this is a bit pathetic.  
Hugs and kisses XOXO"
,slumpy,2007-12-01T19:34Z,"Looks to me like this torrent needs a cry for help. Maybe it's a cry for attention by the seeder, who seems more concerned with dedicating it than doing it - some dedication!

DVD is out in Feb 2008, probably quicker to wait for that!"
,apicus,2007-12-02T05:45Z,"great movie. anton actually sold his house because nobody wanted to finance it. download AND buy the dvd, or see it in a cinema!"
,hotvette123,2007-12-04T00:33Z,"this is hotvette..i have put the original file i downloaded on here for you lot to share. its a smaller file size in two parts it was zipped but i have unzipped it for you.ok. i do wish the person who said this is just a tribute to my dead boyfriend, would just go and fuck your self. you arse hole. what if it is a tribute, just stop being so fucking petty, ok."
,hotvette123,2007-12-04T00:34Z,"me again.... one other thing  don't download this if you dont want it, and bug someone else ok.."
,hotvette123,2007-12-04T00:35Z,"a change of life
a change of style
a change of hopes
with no regrets....."
,slumpy,2007-12-06T18:49Z,"I stand by my comments - there are now THREE fucking torrents by the same fucking person of the same fucking movie, AND NOT A SINGLE FUCKING ONE HAS MANAGED TO COMPLETE!

SOME FUCKING TRIBUTE!!"
[T],hoch88,2007-12-11T11:29Z,So this particular one stinks too then?
,Whatley,2008-01-25T02:17Z,"folks! do not expect too much, at least not if you are joy division fans. it's a nice family drama but only a liitle bit about ian curtis music. one woders at the end why he should have been fond of singing at all. cheers"
