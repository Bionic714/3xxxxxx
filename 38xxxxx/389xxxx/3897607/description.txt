Freedom Against Censorship Thailand (FACT) has been fighting Internet censorship under martial law since September 19, 2006. 

Beat_the_Censors.iso contains every known software tool, application and method for circumventing Web-blocking. The use of circumvention software and anonymous proxies is now illegal in Thailand under a new cybercrime law which includes life imprisonment! 

Beat_the_Censors.iso also includes all FACT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s political action to date, in Thai and English.
