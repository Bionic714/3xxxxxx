CNN Presents: God's Warriors is a three-part series, which is an interesting report on passionate followers of three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. A casual check of the blogosphere finds devotees from each faith fuming about Christiane Amanpour's investigation. She examines some of the motivations behind "God's Warriors," and the resulting conflict between each religion and secular society.
