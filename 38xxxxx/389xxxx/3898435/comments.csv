Thats the reason there is no Sound Playing while in the Game.. can you please check on this ?"
[V],Subzero!,2008-01-16T02:56Z,"ok sorry wrong description... > movies and music have been removed, besides this some gfx like company logos and sh*t like that, + trailers are also removed. thats the reason why its so damn small! ;) ... ( compare to the iso release! ) ;)"
[V],Subzero!,2008-01-16T02:58Z,"and even when it works, go here and let them check. we'll never know, maybe its something totally different, (cant remember exactly what and what not was removed, too many games ) i have uploaded meanwhile... hmm... "

(will help seed this for a week or so at least (; ) "
,iamreadyforanything2009,2008-08-02T08:14Z,"@Cecatron and @dicca-

Sounds to me like a driver issue, or an incompatibility issue, try updating your drivers and if that doesnt work roll them back, if that doesnt work, re-install and make sure to add the game to the registry, and finally if that doesnt work than GIVE UP, ya' cant runit, thats about all:(

Anyways, THX for this one TOeD, this is a cool game, I thought it was gonna be gay, but I WAS WRONG it sweet, So THX and keep it up!!!

Lates,
and
Happy torrenting,
-Ready2009"
,iamreadyforanything2009,2008-08-02T08:18Z,"And @chris8833-

UnRAR is to simply unpack the compressed file to a bigger file, and then you run the install to ""unpack"" a BIGGER file...

To unpack, just go here a piratebay.org and search for WinRAR or 7z, whic 7z is my favorite;)
And the fav of many Uploaders too, just install the software and then you can unrar almost any compressed archive that there is:) HAVE FUN!!!

Lates,
and, Happy torrenting,
-Ready2009"

,iampower,2008-08-14T02:29Z,"Why are the textures lo-res? I tried to tweak everything high, and theres one option that I can't use ""Use Hi-res preset"" or somethin. Is that the reason why the textures are so lo-res and if so, what do I do to tweak it?"
[V],Subzero!,2008-08-28T12:48Z,"hi-res has been removed, to keep the download Size small... play it like it is... or you might wanna leech the big big .ISO... your decision anyways
