This unique educational documentary reveals the wonderful and relaxing experience of flying a small aircraft. Take a Cessna 172 single-engine aircraft on a nice cross-country flight around Budapest, Hungary, and fly to the famous and picturesque Danube Bend in Hungary, enjoying the view recorded with multiple cameras.
 
Luckily, besides being a pilot, our host happens to be a well-known flight simulator expert and builder as well, so viewers also get to see his unique, full-size Cessna 172 flight simulator in action. Instead of technical details, vertigo, and breathtaking stunts, this documentary shows what it really feels like flying a small aircraft for fun in real life, and how some procedures can be practiced at home using Microsoft Flight Simulator combined with a video projector and a full-size instrument panel.
