,Saerain,2008-08-27T13:10Z,"Some information about the black screen error:

If you open the videos in WMP, you'll notice they play normally, so it is not a codec issue. You'll also notice that the video plays normally in VirtualFem if you right-click in the video area and go to Zoom -> Full Screen. Of course, then you can't see the chat box. It's an obnoxious state of affairs.

It has to do with loops and the WMP SDK, and there's no fix as of yet, aside from running in fullscreen and using TTS and VR instead of the chat box."

,Jurosem,2010-03-25T22:11Z,"Hi, I see a lot of people talking about a black screen problem, but I'm having one of another kind. The game loads up fine but when I double click on one of the girls I get ""Runtime error '339': Component comdlg32.ocx or one of its dependencies is not correctly registered: a file is missing or valid."" And then the game shuts down. 
Running Vista 32. Tried both this torrent, and the other torrent of this game on Piratebay and got same problem with both. 
Anyone else? Any help?
Thanks "

,guitarhero32,2012-06-25T03:26Z,"I have downloaded this but it will not let me install it. When I double-click on the setup.exe I get a message that says ""This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Create an association in the Folder Options control panel"". Then when I click ok I get another message that says ""The loader successfully loaded the Windows Installer, but failed to run the Windows Installer package C:DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGSSAMMYMY DOCUMENTSVIRTUALFEMINSTMSIW.EXE."" Any help with this would be very much appreciated. When I try to run it as an administrator I only get the second message. Do I need a program or something to run this?"
