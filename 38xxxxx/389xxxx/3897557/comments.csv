Just browse my user name here to get a listing of all my past Comic Packs and find the issues you need.    Oh, before I forget...  this message is for the person with the user name ""djtdon"" here on The Pirate Bay.  DO NOT BOTHER DOWNLOADING ANYMORE OF MY TORRENTS! YOU HAVE A NASTY ATTITUDE AND ARE ALSO A TOTAL A-HOLE!   To everyone else, have a nice day."

,navybarker,2007-11-18T10:02Z,Hey love your work could you help out with the Hulk and Thor and keep up the good job 
,MistahG,2007-11-18T14:02Z,"MANY MANY THANKS for these.

Quick request for World War Hulk 5 too.

Keep up the great work SBM. Much appreciated."
,sunnymatharuuk,2007-11-18T16:01Z,"you truly are a god amongst men.

There's some stuff you put up since you've started, that I never heard of but am hooked on now (BSG, 30DoN), and the pack you had a while back with the whole 'House of M' saga (complete!) was amazing.

That said, after going through all your packs, I hope I can make a request since I couldn't find these anywhere in them.

Ultimate X-Men #83, #84, #85 and #86.

Also, I know you've recommended CDisplay for Windows, but (you may already know of it) there's a cool app called ComicRack which I find to be way better.

Keep up the good work"

,sbm_from_la,2007-11-19T01:51Z,If you don't see something here that means it hasn't been released yet.

,sunnymatharuuk,2007-11-20T00:00Z,"hmmm...these ones are definitely out since I have issue #87 from somewhere else

Ultimate X-Men #83, #84, #85 and #86

no worries if you don't have them though...you're still the best there is for comics.

Do you own a comic shop by any chance...or work in one?"
,martelfs,2007-11-21T08:29Z,"Thanks a ton for the comic goodness!

I see Grimm Fairy Tales #4 here and I can find #0-2 in previous uploads from you but I can't find #3 anywhere...  Did I just miss it?  Could you point me to where I can find it?  Thanks."
,azrael73,2007-11-21T21:21Z,"I'm after the Return to Wonderland 3 as well, can you help???"
