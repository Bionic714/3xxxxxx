Twixtor raises the bar in motion estimation. Twixtor introduces a complete rewrite of its tracking. Twixtor is much more accurate, tracks objects farther, and exhibits fewer artifacts when there are objects crossing in the scene. 

This means less tearing and stretching of objects as they cross or go out of the frame.

Twixtor enables you to speed up, slow down or frame rate convert your image sequences with visually stunning results. In order to achieve its unparalleled image quality, Twixtor synthesizes unique new frames by warping and interpolating frames of the original sequence... employing RE:Vision's proprietary tracking technology that calculates motion for each individual pixel.

Here are some key features of ""Twixtor"":

· Calculation of motion vectors at each pixel. 
· Warping and interpolation of frames to ""time warp"" input footage. 
· Smart processing of interlaced material
· Stretching of a sequence using a single scaling parameter. 
· Keyframable retiming for complete control on a frame by frame basis.
· Frame rate conversions made easy (Important Note: frame rate conversions are supported only from within After Effects and Combustion ).
· 8 and 16 bits per channel processing (no floating point).
· Tracking completely rewritten from the ground up. Twixtor is much more accurate, tracks farther, and exhibits fewer artifacts when there are objects crossing in the scene.
· Option to automatically enhance dark imagery or imagery with poorly defined edges. In many cases, footage that was difficult to track becomes much more well-behaved upon retiming.
· Now contains an option to remove motion motion blur upon slowing footage
· Support for marking material so that Twixtor does not motion-interpolate across a cut.
· After Effects only: ability to remap audio and video using AE's time remapping tools but using Twixtor ""under the hood"".

,roolOne,2008-01-31T07:55Z,"scuse me, the serial for this?"
,meeble,2008-02-03T10:15Z,what version?
,digi8boy,2008-02-04T20:35Z,"This is version 4.5.8 and there isn't any serial, so I don't see the point. You can download the latest versions for free at the home site. There's a key floating around (P123456781111111) but it tricks you into thinking it works when it's really installing the demo. These serials are usually planted by reelsmart itself, I'm guessing. All in all, this torrent is a waste of time."
,mirceadobre78,2011-05-11T15:39Z,"for FCP version download the demo version of Twixtor 4.5.11 from the official site and add the bellow username and pass (I take them from KCNScrew):
Name = The Blade
Serial = b2c6TQYpt5nAKXxH
License = Pro

p.s. no need to patch anything, just add the sn and username and you'll be fine."
,chronolgc,2011-09-07T15:04Z,Anyone made it work in Premiere / AE CS 5.5 on the mac?
