,Rav3rPills,2008-01-26T09:36Z,"Overall, I would give this mix a 4/10. Why? Because only 4 of the songs in this torrent were actually pretty good. This is, of course, all based on my opinion. If you like quick hard PSY, this may not be the first pick. However, Astral, Infected and Vibe Tribe do ok. In other words though, wasn't really pleased. 

Hope this helped"

,TertaHC,2008-04-19T12:57Z,"These tracks are what I would call ""generic"" psy, meaning they are basically mainstream psy if you know what I mean. I completely agree with Rav3rPills - there is way, WAY better psy out there."
,M3Z,2008-04-20T23:53Z,well fellows that's why there's a list of the tracks that you can look at before downloading if u already know what type of psy u want :)
