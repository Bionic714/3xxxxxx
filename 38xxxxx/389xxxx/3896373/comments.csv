,maldama,2008-01-20T02:43Z,HI ALL. DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW CAN  I PLAY THIS WITH K-LITE CODE AND MEDIA PLAYER CLASSIC ?
,Vadim Makarov,2008-02-17T14:19Z,"To play this in PowerDVD 7.3 Ultra, I've first had to make an iso image using ImgBurn, then mount it with Daemon Tools. PowerDVD does not seem to be able to play directly from the disc copy as provided in this torrent."
,Vadim Makarov,2008-02-17T16:18Z,"I mean, it all worked well in the end :). You can get cracked PowerDVD 7.3 Ultra here in the bay, and the two other utilities are freeware."
