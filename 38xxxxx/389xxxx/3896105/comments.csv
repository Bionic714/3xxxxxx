,gary85007,2008-08-17T07:55Z,"Wow, what a snot.  7 gig for one DVD seems huge, yet you say this is ONE dvd?  You don't know what you're doing."
[T],Abrasax,2008-09-23T21:39Z,@gary85007 - seems like you are the one not knowing wht you doin'. All DVD's are about that size if you leave them untouched. Most of the uploads here have been shrinked to fit into a DVD5. So you just burn it to a DVD9 and it will work just fine :)
