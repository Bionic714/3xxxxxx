,SPEC_06,2007-11-17T18:38Z,Thanks man. 
,viscount007,2007-11-17T21:51Z,"They may be ""shitty"" but they are unique!..Better being able to fly one that is less than perfect - than not being able to fly one at all?"
,palmofsweden,2007-11-17T21:56Z,"Yeah but the thing is also that alphasim charges as much money as it would have been a top product. And many freeware products are much better than alpha also. But hey, is it free, why not grab it!"
[T],supaturtle,2007-11-17T22:00Z,"well, as i wrote: as requested"

Thanks "
,bfifteenv,2009-04-10T19:39Z,"Thanks for ULing this! 

I have ULed the same aircraft with a flight dynamics patch to make the VTOL function work like it should. 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4837981

If your client will let you do it, you can just download the patch separately from that same torrent and apply it to the aircraft in this torrent.

You also need FSUIPC 4.0 or higher to make it work - that is also available in that same torrent.

Again, thanks for uploading the original file!"
