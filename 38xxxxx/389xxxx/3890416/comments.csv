,schizogeny,2007-11-14T15:29Z,"My client says my ratio on this is 3.5?
What's up with TPB?"
,PSPlaystation,2007-11-16T15:17Z,"That's TPB for you my friend. It's seeding pretty good at the moment though.

I've got uploads here that I've given a ratio of 30.0 or so and still there's hardly anyone helping with seeding. The level of leeching here is unbelievable.

Can't wait til Demonoids back, always more seeders there."
