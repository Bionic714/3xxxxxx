,Macpidamurdock,2007-11-24T22:50Z,Well a little bit of seeding would be nice... 
,Macpidamurdock,2007-11-26T00:11Z,"Oh and by the way, thanks! Been looking for this season forever now."
,impact0r,2008-07-12T19:22Z,What about the other seasons? Would be cool to get them too.
,WENDINGO22,2008-11-16T03:20Z,Does anyone have season 2 or 4?
,tomalex1,2009-01-18T00:42Z,"TiGGer seems to have the best torrents for Nash Bridges. Higher quality (maybe his source was better?) And his F/X network source has less editing than USA network. I'd like to find seasons 4-6 from him. WENDINGO22- did you find what you were looking for? I could probably figure out how to reseed season 2 and 4 if you can't find it elsewhere. 
I heard they butchered the DVD season 1 release. Could someone upload the extras from that set?"
,ronniesmit,2009-06-01T11:19Z,"Hello,
i also like to have season 2,4 and 6 from the nash bridges series. Anyone an idea were and how to find it?"
,eastcoastgal,2010-09-14T00:59Z,"Season two is available here. It needs seeds badly but I am doing what I can and so are a couple others; if anybody wants to join in we can probably keep it going for a while.
