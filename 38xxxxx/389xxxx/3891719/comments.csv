,SpeedyUp,2007-12-19T14:39Z,"Yes, the game is a quite unoriginal classic """"tycoon"" game, but it is indeed fun and easy to play. 
The game is kinda like Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2, with better graphics."
,w1nther,2008-01-03T23:27Z,"I am having problems starting the game

First, I installed the game
Second, I replaced the crack/patch (named: golf) with the one in the file directory.

Should it not be running when i click on the ""autorun"" file then? 

What am I doing wrong?

Help"

Cannot locate CD-Rom - Please select the CD-Rom and restart the application"
,Minerva.TheGift,2008-01-09T04:08Z,"This game doesn't need a patch or a CD key, it's way too old for that :P The patch (v1.03) does not replace the original .exe.  Instead, you double click on the patch and it will install a few updates.  Sorry for any confusion.
As for problems with it not finding the CD, I'm sorry, but I haven't had that problem myself.  Note that I've only tested it with Alcohol 120%, so while burning it to a CD should work, it might not."
