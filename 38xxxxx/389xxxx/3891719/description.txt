This torrent contains SIMGOLF.iso, SimGolfREADMEfromMinerva.txt, SimGolf_Patch_v103.exe, and EA Games - 94 key generator.exe all compacted into a .rar file. To open it, you'll need WinRar or something similar.
The .iso should work if burned to a CD, but I've only tested it using Alcohol 120%. Note that the CD image is very small (about 210MB or so.)
This is my first torrent, so let me know if I screwed something up.

Here's the contents of the .txt file:
26 Mar 07 Sid Meier's Sim Golf: This is a fun, if unoriginal "tycoon" style game.
The disc image is very small (two hundred some odd megs) so that helps if you're playing on a computer with a small hard drive.
A CD key is needed, but I found that the EA Games 94 Keygen (a copy of which is included in this folder) includes a keygen for this game.
A note for once the game is installed: After you quit, credits roll so just hit Esc when they're up to exit completely.

The patch is version 1.03 and fixes a few bugs and game balances.
The .exe file just extracts a few files and is set by default to extract to the standard SimGolf root directory.
I think there's also a .txt file in the patch (one of the files it extracts when run) that details the changes.
I got this from the simgolf website, so I don't expect any problems with it and if you need more info, just look up simgolf on EA's website.
