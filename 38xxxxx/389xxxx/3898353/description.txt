This authoritative, thorough, and scientifically sound guide to nutrition and wellness provides information on weight loss, detoxification, low cholesterol, better digestion, mercury poisoning, cholesterol--and more! Optimal Nutrition for Optimal Health covers the same topics as current bestsellers such as Prescription for Nutritional Healing and The Nutrition Bible in as great a depth--but in a smaller, handier trim size and at a much more affordable price.
