,xplycyt,2008-03-16T03:37Z,I finally finished downloading but ca't figure out how to play the 'Image' file. HELP!!! PLEEEEEEEASEEE!!
,djdumbbi,2008-03-26T05:22Z,"This is how you play it:

Download: Daemon tools Lite x86, do custom install and uncheck the option to change homepage and install toolbar (it's spyware). You might have to restart your PC before continue install.

After install done, Download: K-Lite Codec Pack (google it and it'll show up first thing). Get the Standard pack. (if you got this already then go next step.)

You will see a red thunder on the system tray in bottom right corner. Click on that, then click on the 'drive' so you can 'mount' the 'image'.  Browse to image (the breaktannica folder) and double click on the ISO.

Now your computer might do autorun, if it does, select to play with Media Player Classic. (It'll load and start playing).   If it doesn't come up, then go to My Computer, right click on the drive that the image is mounted/ or says that a DVD is inserted (you can tell if the name of the dvd comes up).  Then click play or auto play, and play with media player classic.  Enjoy, LEARN, AND PRACTICE!

If you can't do the above steps, then just go to Youtube and watch most of the clips there instead, but you won't get the quality of the DVD.

Heads up: The menu and navigation system on the DVD S-U-C-K-S!  But all the skratches are good.  Also, learn to use the Pause Button too!"
,greeencalx,2008-06-17T20:07Z,can you burn this to dvd?
,Wububu,2008-08-03T20:31Z,"Hi guys, i need some help. Every 10 minutes the file fails because it says i dont have enough harddrive space. Currently i have 10 gigs free. Anyone have any ideas how i could fix this problem?"
,Djrelmz,2009-06-20T01:07Z,"your operating system requires free hard drive space for virtual memory, so it might be reserved for that.  try freeing up more space on your HD."
