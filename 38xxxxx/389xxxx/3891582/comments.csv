,ryder74,2007-11-20T20:50Z,"In 5 minutes, I'll be seeding..."
,Angel44,2007-11-23T03:30Z,I'll seed thru the weekend. Thanks for the up.
,ipv6freely,2007-11-26T10:21Z,"Since this is still an Interscope release, I'll be getting it here and not paying a dime. But heres what I'm going to do (and encourage the rest of you to do):

When the next NIN album comes out, and is put online using the Radiohead/Saul Williams model, I will pay for both that album, and this one.

For that matter, if Trent ever sets up a ""pay what you feel it's worth"" model, I think I will send $5 for every NIN release I've downloaded and don't own (which isn't many of them, mostly singles)"
,supercatski,2007-11-26T19:59Z,"that is a great idea, i download every album however, i then go buy it also. i cant wait to be able to give trent my money directly. the music revolution has started. fcuk the suits, bet they dont even get it! stroll on tossers."
,M1911,2008-01-03T18:38Z,"Thanks for the opportunity to listen to the CD before I buy it! Loved it so much, pounding my skull that I bought it and enjoy it even more. Thanks for Seeding. Thank you NIN for another awsome CD!"

,Quenox,2008-03-05T22:34Z,"My quick comment: if you want a torrent to survive, DONT PACKAGE IT IN A SINGLE FILE! You get "
,Quenox,2008-03-05T22:36Z,"(cut off my comment) less than 1% compression with media, so there is no reason to package it. You just take up twice the space on my drive, because I have to decompress it to listen to it. I will seed at least to 200%, but please just stop doubling the space that my downloads take up."
,SirenShade,2009-08-18T00:11Z,"Seed? I'm dying for this album. 
Ladytron and Nine Inch nails. "
