,sakura2006,2008-09-08T08:22Z,"Dear Taeguki San, Hontoni Domo Arigato Gozaimasu for all the torrents of Japanese animation. I believe Nippon Animation is one of the best in the world. But it is just a pitty that some of these Japanese anime cannot be downloaded, because of no seeder, and no leecher. So would you please seed these torrents yourself. Dozo Yoroshiku Onegaitashimasu."
