can anyone upload the paintkits for the FS9 and FSX Version please?!"
,Husky42,2007-12-27T11:12Z,"BE AWARE:

What 4X-AXG does is like Fairlight stealing something from Razor or Deviance.

This would not happen within groups, it is about competition. All 4X-AXG has managed to do was alienate himself as a non team player and thief.

This would not have been accepted years ago. A child to the game 4X-AXG will continue to steal. But be aware, he has never released a file that was not released elsewhere first.

He has never purchased and sold, or donated to help a cause. He is the lowest of the lowest when it comes to file sharers and in no way deserves any form of respect. He does not even know how to give appropriate credit.

4X-AXG you are nothing more then a pathetic fucking thief."
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-06T07:10Z,"yeah but he sure does share an awefull lot of file for everyone on TPB. And I also believe that a ""pirate"" is a theif. and we're all none paying members of this Pirating website.

Honors is not necessary among thieves as long as everyone gets what they need. "

Thanks !!! "
,dotcomvictom,2008-06-01T20:58Z,"Thanks 4X-AXG, U R THE MAN!!! I just discovered your treasure chest of FS. I will gladly seed your stuff until I drop 

unless you advise otherwise, but first I need a little seeding help from your loyal followers. 

Thanks soo much for the great upload :)> 

BTW, can anyone suggest where I can purchase some used HW (peddles, etc..) to play these little gems more efficently?"

And you're ""nothing more then a pathetic fucking"" whiner.

What of it?

The elitist attitude ""sceners"" have against the rest of file sharing community is one of the most laughable cases of snottiness.

Years ago, many aspects of modern society would not have been accepted (for better or worse). Sure you can pretend to live in the past and gasp in horror every time you see a girl's ankle, but the fact remains that society has moved on. You choose if you want to go along with it.

Admittedly, credit could and should have been given."
