Great one, now lets work onnnnnnn....... Please refer to email........... :P"
,osmondmania,2007-11-19T06:16Z,"I just had time to do a quick check on how the torrent is doing. 

I've uploaded 400 mb of 667 mb, so it's getting there! I'm personally connected through Utorrent to 26 of a total of 52 peers, uploading at a steady 35-40 kB/s. I'm of course going to leave this uploading day and night until at least 20-30 of you have it and can take over the seeding while I post another one. So, share it as soon as you get it, if everything goes well with this one, I'll attempt an even larger MB torrent in a few days.

Sure..Firewoman..I'll check my email right now!"
,osmondmania,2007-11-19T15:55Z,Hi everyone. Just to let you know. Don't necessarily go by how many seeders/leechers that Piratebay says. At times it is not accurate. Right now for example. Utorrent is showing me that there are more than 20 seeders 51 leechers. So there are plenty of people helping me to share this that have completed it.
,tvane58,2007-11-20T03:29Z,"Thanks for another fine effort. I've helped upload over 5 GB of the Donny & Marie torrent and am doing the same for this one. You have really helped fill a void that a lot of people were hoping to find one day. All of my original versions of these albums were on store bought cassettes and were lost long ago to tape decks that chewed them up. After that happened I found out they were out of print and unreplaceable. Thank you so much.

,osmondmania,2007-11-20T17:47Z,"As always tvane58 great hearing from you and ""thanks"" so much for being as dedicated as I am to seeing these get to as many Osmond fans as we can! For many of us, you are right, these are replacements for things we actually paid for and spent our hard earned $$$ on in the past. I really appreciate you talking the time to write. I don't have the exact figure but going by how many mb's I have uploaded of it, and how much you have, how many seeds I see getting it, then leaving.. well, it must have at the very least be approching 100 complete downloads in the last couple days, I would imagine. Please feel free to drop me any comment about anything, the torrent or whatever, whenever you have the time. It's always a pleasure hearing from other Osmond fans...."
,tvane58,2007-11-21T02:49Z,"These sound great! I'm missing track #8 from Alone Together, which is ""Other Side Of Me"".
It appears that this is the only track missing from this torrent. You can up it seperately and provide people a link to it in this one if you want.

Thanks again for doing these ;)"
,tvane58,2007-11-22T02:53Z,6.85 GB uploaded and still going. :)
,Fire_Woman,2007-11-22T06:27Z,I have all three of them still going even if there are no leachers. This is one of them things that I want to have available in days to come. This guy really rocks with this collection. 
,tvane58,2007-11-24T03:08Z,12 GB uploaded and still going. :)

,theeke,2007-12-25T15:43Z,toppie ik doe mee thanks dit is wat ik al zocht thanks en Happy Christmas
,sunshinerose63,2008-01-11T03:30Z,First I want to say thank you - thank you - thank you for all the hard work that you have put into making this torrent ( I would have no clue where to start).  I lost my full Osmond collection along with lots of other things in a fire in 1990.  I have been slowly being getting it back through e bay.  But NOW I have it all on my pc and can put it on my iPod - Whooo Hooo.  Please do not think I am being criticle but just in case you didn't realize Alone Together is missing Track 8 - Other side Of Me (I have it on my pc already so was able to add it)  Also the picture cover for Donny Osmond Album is there twice but the picture cover for Donny Osmond (89) is missing.  I know someone is uploading from me and I look forward to you next addition.  Thanks once again.  ( I am going to see if I can learn how to load a torrent)
,zomgfem1990,2009-01-04T02:31Z,"Hey, once I get this dl'ed I will be completely in your debt. I've been looking for the Joseph soundtrack with Donnie on it for ages and no one is seeding the other torrent of this version on here.

Perhaps we could get a few more seeders yaeh? *bats-eyelashes*
"
,jasdts,2009-09-26T20:58Z,Osmondmania I am begging you to please seed the part  IV. I have been siting at 94% for a month now with no progress. Please Please help me. Good torrent but does me no good if I can't finish it.
