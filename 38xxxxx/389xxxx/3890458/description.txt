Rebuilders estimated high bitrate is not accurate. I made changes to rebuilders ini file (hidden settings).
Now when you need high bitrates (like quick movings, moving backround), CCE allows bitrate to go higher (up to 9000). Check the sample. Sources avarage bitrate was very high.

There is a sample, and high resolution finnish cover.
