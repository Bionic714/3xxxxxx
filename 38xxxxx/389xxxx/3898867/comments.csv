This was uploaded over 17 hours ago.

I guess I'll check back in later or tomorrow to see if you're seeding it yet.

,DogNo7,2007-11-22T01:43Z,"Be somewhat reserved and suspicious when you see the Pirate Bay tracker saying there are 0 seeders.

I have noticed this problem on my torrents and other people's torrents when they are first uploaded.   Quite often, even though we are ""Force"" seeding, the tracker will report 0 seeders, even though I am seeding.

So, my advice when you see 0 seeders is to download the torrent, and let your bit torrent client figure it out.

You might just be pleasantly surprised that someone is seeding the torrent.

it would be great if you could seed this for me.
Thanks!"
,DogNo7,2010-06-10T18:28Z,"This torrent is dead.

I no longer have the file to seed.

Thanks a lot axxo.  >.<

This had some funky codecs, or the original file was corrupt.  In any case, I will create a new torrent for a new rip when I get around to it.
