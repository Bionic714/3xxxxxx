Are all the episodes uncut and uncensored?
"
,molybden123,2007-11-19T10:10Z,"most of them uncut
:)"
,molybden123,2007-11-22T09:19Z,"my bad!
All of them are uncut and uncensored and english subs!
Enjoy! :)"
,AlexMalkavian,2007-12-18T10:24Z,"Can someone tell me why OVA 4-5 doesnt work?
It looks like it is empty file (but download is 100%)."
,mastersturm,2007-12-20T02:10Z,"Several problems with this torrent.  Urotsu 2 doesn't work.  Why?  Try renaming it to a RAR and you'll find it is indeed a RAR, disc 2 of the PC game Alien vs Predator 2.  I'm assuming the problem with OVAs 4-5 is the same and that'll be disc 2 for Alien Vs Predator.

Also, Legend of the Overfiend is redundant.  It's OVAs 1-3 in one single video file making it NOT the actual Legend movie (which was re-edited to be somewhat less explicit but also included new and restored animation at the time).

New Saga is the same as the torrent that is the New Saga on its own and cool.  Haven't finished 3, 4 or 5 yet though.  Hoping they aren't bum files too"
,mastersturm,2007-12-20T02:11Z,typo.. I meant to say OVAs 4-5 was probably disc 1 (one) of the AvP2 game
,mastersturm,2007-12-20T10:22Z,"V - The Final Chapter has finished downloading for me.  No playback, this doesn't seem to be a video file either.  Can't figure out what it might be though, it's definitely not a rar or an iso (tried, failed)."
,mastersturm,2007-12-21T16:52Z,"okay, last comment. Episode 1 for Inferno Road, also not working.  Inferno Road is NOT in japanese with eng subs, it's an english dub.

I found where all of these urotsu vids came from, or at least a forum pointing to the rapidshare links they came from: http://banatfun.com/vb/showthread.php?t=3032

the page is in arabic but you can grab the links, and the password for the RAR's is at the bottom of the page (tijal).  I've grabbed from there what was not working in this torrent.  Works great from that link, word of warning about v-The Final Chapter though.. it's in Japanese with NO subtitles.

I'd recommend people disable those broken files, even if you're finished and seeding.  They're a waste of bandwidth."
,AlexMalkavian,2007-12-21T22:08Z,"""Inferno Road"" and ""The Final Chapter"" works. Maybe you need some codecs?
Inferno road with Dual Audio (Japanese & English tracks) i found only here
http://animelayer.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=895&spmode=full
But it is without subs and needs registration to download."
,mastersturm,2007-12-22T02:44Z,"I'm of the mindset that if it doesn't work with K-Lite codecs and on either VLC or Media player classic, I'm not going to risk installing more codecs (not worth the risk for just a movie, a rogue/conflicting codec can screw up the entire video platform if you do video editing in Windows.. I know, it's happened to me before, only solution then is to reinstall windows).

The odd thing is that those rapidshare links I found (I think that page is in hindi, not arabic on 2nd sight)... the files extracted from those rar's are identical in size (and I mean down to the last byte) to what's in this torrent, yet they work perfectly.  Maybe my earlier RAR findings were just a coincidence in code that made it look like an archive in winrar.

Maybe the problem is a corrupt seed source somehow slipping through?  Who knows.  Still need subs for Final Chapter though.  Did you find subs in your working copy from in this torrent?"
,AlexMalkavian,2007-12-31T12:10Z,"mastersturm
No... there is no subs for Final Chapter. And I haven't found any subs for it in net"
,RamonNZ,2008-11-22T02:34Z,Uh... so what is working?
,the-chojin,2008-12-11T02:17Z,what is ova the last one in list.
,the-chojin,2008-12-11T18:35Z,"Urotsukidoji V - The_Final_Chapter has no subs.
and although it say 100% but wont play do a manual hash check as its not 100%. thats what i did and it works fine now.
the last on list ova is l.o.t.o in its original form as 4 epps uncut "
,Ferrit6Winter6From6Hell,2009-02-23T22:58Z,"All movies work fine except the file ""OVA 4-5"".
And ""Inferno Road"" is in ENG no subs.
Thanks for that great torrent."

,Pwny,2011-03-17T04:16Z,"Shit, all these comments are so confusing!
Are any of these what they say they are?
Someones talking about AVP video games, and shit being the Hell on Earth box set??

Can someone confirm?
Uploader, can you edit description or something??"
,RufusChainsaw,2011-09-03T23:43Z,"They all worked fine for me, the only issues are:
- There is random censorship through the entire series except the first chapter and the New Saga. You get the idea though (perverts).

- The 4th Chapter 'Inferno Road' is in English and it is terrible. This version has an alternate ending designed to wrap up the series when production of the 5th chapter was canceled. So there are some continuity issues between the 4th and 5th chapters (described below). 

- The 5th Chapter is in Japanese but has no sub-titles. Only the first episode of the chapter was ever made due to popularity dropping off and being banned in several countries. It also continues the story line assuming you saw the original ending to the forth film in which... 

*SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE DOWN* 

...(apparently) the Mad Regent meets face to face with the Chojin (Akemi and Negumo's Child, now in adult form) who reveals that he is actually a Demon King that has been hanging out in Akemi's womb drinking the blood of the true unborn Chojin making him super-powerful. He proceeds to rape the Mad Regent who then apparently turns the tables and rapes the Demon King to death. I think maybe she dies also. Then later the true Chojin is born and that is either the penis-gina sentient spaceship or the hermaphrodite that lives in it or both. 

The first episode of the 5th chapter ends with Amano finally realizing that the True Chojin plans to replace humanity with his chirping space cadets and Amano vowels to destroy the Chojin. 

- There is also some continuity confusion between the first and second chapters. The only way it makes sense to me, is if the events in the second chapter take place between the events in the first. Sometime after Negumo gets his Demon of Destruction powers and before he causes the Apocalypse. 

Props to the uploader, these are very hard to find."
