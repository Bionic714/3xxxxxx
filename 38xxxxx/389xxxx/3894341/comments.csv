,Ssschhhh,2007-11-16T08:20Z,TYPE WITH ALL CAPS AND I WILL TOO
,team_sleep,2007-11-16T08:25Z,Awesome!!!! Thanks for upload. 6 more weeks before they hit Australian shores! Now to find the first disc....
,DemonWizard,2007-11-16T08:26Z,"WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER DISC?

CAPS FTW \0/"
,DemonWizard,2007-11-16T08:27Z,The two discs are available at Mininova. But i´m not certain if its the real deal or the bootleg of Bercy 2007.
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-16T08:53Z,"lol@caps. im working on getting the rest of the set, which is being downloaded to my comp right now. plz be patient.



*wow alot of ppl are downloading this already??*"
,DemonWizard,2007-11-16T09:25Z,"The one from Mininova is a weird mp3. Winamp lists the encore as having 67:43. And the music skips all the time. Disc one too (518:17).

This one is 9:58. And the music is playing fine. Which is great. :)"
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-16T09:40Z,"the rest of the set should be available within a week. its dl hella slow to my comp right now..

but in the meantime enjoy (and please seed) the encore, and check out my around the world/hbfs remix if you want"
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-16T16:44Z,"(update)


looks like i'll be getting the set to you guys alot sooner than i thought. def. today or tomorrow. :]"
,DemonWizard,2007-11-16T18:33Z,Great!!
,tenshu,2007-11-16T19:44Z,"dunno it this is real 

Just a post to say that the encore is a remix of Together Human by DJ Falcon.
Encore light show by daft unk wearing tron like costumes is so wonderul!"
,DemonWizard,2007-11-16T23:18Z,I´m beginning to think that this one is the bootleg. The sound quality is too crappy for a Daft Punk release.
,DemonWizard,2007-11-17T21:57Z,It´s the bootleg.
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-18T08:25Z,"god you are a persistent fuck arent you? quit letting your bullshit get to your head. this aint no fucking bootleg, only one bootleg exists of bercy and its shitty ass quality. you guys should know that already. "
,timtiti,2007-11-18T18:03Z,"Of course this is the real Alive Encore. 
The mp3 is top quality!!

Thanks ixlikextoxdansex"
,DemonWizard,2007-11-18T21:34Z,"If you compare to the disc one that ixlikextoxdansex posted, the quality of this one is pretty worse. And clips near the ending.

The other disc maybe the real deal, but this one sounds almost like the bootleg."
