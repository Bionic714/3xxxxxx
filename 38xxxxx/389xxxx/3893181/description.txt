Release Notes:
--------
Led Zeppelin fans will have a lot to celebrate this fall thanks to the release
of three new titles in multiple configurations. First up on Nov. 13 via
Atlantic/Rhino is a two-disc, 24-track best-of, "Mothership." A deluxe reissue
of the soundtrack to the 1976 concert film "The Song Remains the Same" with
previously unreleased material and a new DVD edition of that movie will arrive
Nov. 20 via Atlantic/Rhino and Warner Home Video, respectively.

"Mothership," tracks for which were chosen by surviving members Robert Plant,
Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, represents all eight of the band's studio
albums. In addition to a two-disc set, the album will also be available in both
"deluxe" and "collector's" editions with a DVD featuring varied live content
from the previously released "Led Zeppelin DVD." A 4-LP vinyl package will also
be sold.

As for the "The Song Remains the Same" soundtrack, it now sports six songs not
included on the original album: "Black Dog," "Over the Hills and Far Away,"
"Misty Mountain Hop," "Since I've Been Loving You," "The Ocean" and
"Heartbreaker." The album and film were recorded during a July 1973 stand at New
York's Madison Square Garden.

"The Song Remains the Same" DVD includes all 14 songs from the original concert
for the first time plus previously unreleased performances of "Over the Hills
and Far Away," "Celebration Day," "The Ocean" and "Misty Mountain Hop." Rounding
out the bonus items are a 1976 BBC interview with Plant and band manager Peter
Grant and contemporary footage from the robbery at New York's Drake Hotel during
the MSG run.

Beyond a standard DVD, the film will be sold in both HD DVD and Blu-ray formats,
as well as a limited collector's edition that includes the soundtrack, a T-shirt
with the original album art and reproductions of memorabilia from the era.

All the catalog activity gives further heft to rumors Plant, Page and Jones will
reunite to perform at a proposed Ahmet Ertegun tribute concert this fall in
London. Although no details have been announced, the group is also said to be
mulling offers to tour under the Led Zeppelin name in 2008 with the late John
Bonham's son Jason filling in on drums.
