,jeromedevine,2007-11-16T11:05Z,"Ok so I figured how to upload my first torrent and start its seeding - so let's hope it works fine! My favourite song from the bunch is ""1.03 Bag End.mp3"". :>"
,zohardues,2007-11-16T18:15Z,Thanks :)
,jeromedevine,2007-11-17T06:20Z,"Hey, I don't understand why the Seeders & Leechers Count at the moment (after 1 day uploading) have remained at 0. Right now through uTorrent I see that there are at least 9 seeders and 46 peers and in the queue I see peers having speeds up to 106kb/s :\ Weird. 

Anyway hope you are enjoying this torrent. It would be a great addition to every Lord of the Rings Fan, and it is cool also for some quiet symphony listening! :>

Also, once I get the Return of the King Extended Soundtrack (Final Part of 'The Complete Recordings') I will most definitely post it here, with the direct download links that I used at that moment if any, so stay tuned. However if anyone finds the links before and would be so kind as to post the links here, well that would be great, and I will upload the files after tag and artwork is perfected by me."
