                                                                                     On a prom-night dare, a trio of high-school friends chant an incantation, unleashing an evil spirit from the past with deadly consequences. That same night, the girls are abducted by a gang of high-school jocks. Once rescued, their tormentors receive their just desserts, dying one by one in a chain reaction of gruesome murders, each with a bizarre "Urban Legend" twist. Is it all just a high-school prank taken to grisly extremes--or has "Bloody Mary" returned from the grave to wreak her own vengeance?

   From the Director of Pet Sematary, the terryfiying Urban Legend trilogy comes full circle with Urban Legends: Bloody Mary, delivering hair-raising scares in the style of The Gridge and The Ring.
