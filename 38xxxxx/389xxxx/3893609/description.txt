This is pretty much my digital remaster of the X-Rated classic, the original "Debbie Does Dallas" starring Bambi Woods, in which she wears a cheerleader outfit remarkably similar to the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders uniform, prompting a lawsuit by the NFL franchise. I used Avery Lee's free program Virtual DUB with embedded filters and free downloaded ones to sharpen the video, enlarged it and add coloring three stages, each of which took three days for the computer to do (with several active filters). Along with VDub, I  used the Divx codec and finally the Divx Converter to fix the perspective. The original file was the best one I every downloaded from a torrent and it took me several years (and downloading several rotten copies) to find it and download it-RUBrTOE
