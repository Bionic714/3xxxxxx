,Pepara89,2007-11-16T17:26Z,Subzero can you rip Gears of War and Crysis?
,nilpferdkoenig,2007-11-17T14:42Z,"Cool. Nice any tiny!^^

But it did kinda take you a while...

Thanks!"
,Caner66,2007-11-18T21:20Z,^^Cheeky twat...never mind how long it took. Just be thankfull you got it for free
,nilpferdkoenig,2007-11-21T13:41Z,Look for the .exe or setup button.
,ultrapope,2007-11-23T01:13Z,"I'm having issues with the sound - it's as if the db that indexes sound files is bullocksed up and it plays sound files at the right places, only the wrong sounds. Too bad... :-/"
,sweatersdc,2007-11-24T23:16Z,"I'm having issues getting this to work. I downloaded and extracted it, then ran the .bat file. It takes me to a loading screen (""loading game content"") and a splash screen with The One Eyed Dude and a list of people he wants to thank... then the only way to get out of that screen is to hit Escape. When I do that I get the message ""d3dx9_25.dll was not found"" or something like that. I have that file in my C:\WINDOWS\system32 folder, along with the rest of my DX9 files. So why doesn't the batch file find it?"

go there and download this to your folder (game) or reinstall directx completly!... "

same here game works perfect but all the hints/ radio cues are in wrong order . so the storey dosent gel example in bioshere old mick the paddys supposed to be talking about rapture instead i get details of the doctor talking about surgery and making ugly people beutiful
same with when he explains about his wife and child,i get a totally diffrent audio cue again
shame realy as its perfect in every other way
"
,N4mdDissent,2007-11-25T18:07Z,"Yep.  Same here.  Seems to run fine, but the sound clips in-game are off.  I also have some clips that run endlessly in a loop.  Can make you a little crazy."
[V],Subzero!,2007-11-26T00:42Z,"update your sound card drives, this is a bug inside the gamecode, works fine, with updated drivers..."
,logos81,2007-11-27T04:36Z,can somebody tell me what sound card drivers to download?
,radskiradish,2007-11-27T09:59Z,"nope drivers are updated does shit(already have the latest so i dont know wtf subzeros on about)

only part that is in order is the ryan piece at the begining as soon as atlas starts telling you to pick up radio of which you wont here unless youve turned subtitles on, it still out of audio cue(the aphrodite piece is played which again after playing retail copy is out of place until further in the game same goes for when you save the kids the old bints cue is a mixture of the incorecct audio piece,s and past radio conversations)
i think what sub is thinking is tht our sounds are corrupt this is not the case ,sound is perfect its JUST not in trhe order of when its lined up to come into play 
if your wanting to play turn subtitles on and turn
voice over volume to zero 
youll still get annoying looping of some spoken sound bites but the game will play along alot better than being misled about the storey"
,ultrapope,2007-12-02T17:59Z,"I just downloaded another rip version; it shipped with an AMD driver in a folder named ""amd dual core timing fix"" - I haven't had time to check it (it requires a reboot and I can't reboot quite yet), but the driver can be downloaded directly from AMD; 
http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_871_9706,00.html
It is currently the second download on that page; it is labeled ""AMD Dual-Core Optimizer"". HTH :)"
,Deesotilio,2007-12-02T21:39Z,"Yup, same audio problems. I hope someone figures this one out. Updated drivers, reinstalling Direct X 10, etc, do nothing. I'm disappointed, 'cause this game's so metal :P"
,snowspinner008,2007-12-06T07:44Z,"PLEASE SEED!!!!!

I am going at 15 kb/sec!

My ratio is 3.3 right now."
[V],Subzero!,2007-12-10T22:39Z,"well checked about the sound issue, with this result...

some peeps dont even have them!...(like me!)
some peeps do have them (like some of you)
and some peeps cant get the game working( but that another story )

what i wanna say is, that i dont know what the fucking problem causes, and besides this, i cant find out, on my bioshock (see above , i dont have sound issues!), well anyone who can tell me how to fix sound problems , where none are, will win a nice prize, otherwise i cant help you peeps!, how ?..."
,Dennis 25,2007-12-16T21:10Z,Thank You!!... Very Nice Game.
,Dreamfuel,2007-12-19T22:37Z,OOooh ! Thank you man! I've been looking for this game for ages :)
,Tiki832,2007-12-21T19:20Z,"If anyone is able to find away to amend the audio files that come with this rip (Or has a working copy and could simply upload the the libary files for us to download would be even better), other then simply downloading anew version of the game, letting us know would be great. Other then that, great rip Subzero thanks."
,Tiki832,2007-12-21T23:16Z,"Ok, found a way to solve the problem. Definatly faulty libary files in the ""Sounds_windows"" folder, but only for level 1 fortunatly. Got hold of the Bioshock demo, and use the level 1 files from the demo and overwrite the files found in this rip. Problem solved, Level 2 (Or rather the medical lab) files are perfectly fine so no worrys. Enjoy"
,starwolffan,2007-12-23T15:48Z,What do i use to extract? 7Zip and winRAR says its not extractable
,Tiki832,2008-01-01T01:28Z,"Ok once you get to neptune after the medical labs, the libary files are corrupted again. I'd seriously suggest people to download another rip rather then this one, unless you got access to a uncorrupt copy of the sound files."
,wazbi,2008-01-03T17:00Z,This game works!!!
,smiledskateboarding,2008-01-04T18:57Z,Subzero i just love your rips man !. please bro can u rip gears of war ?. that would be lovely to everyone !
,alienus,2008-01-06T22:48Z,"My gameplay works great, (thought the sound ""barrier"" problem was easily solved by just reading subtitles)\
my game gets stuck every time i want to go to the 1st lever (loading the city Rapture).
my windows says that bioshock got stuck, and that a message will be send when te problem can be solved (yeah right.. like they ever do that) but the main problem is: i can't play the rest of bioshock now :S
what, or where can the problem be?
(p.s. i did not download the new patch already) "
[V],Subzero!,2008-02-02T10:43Z,"sound issue can be ""real"" solved while using a tool called : DirectX Control Panel and de-creasing the sound acceleration. people did solve the ""sound+speech"" not working issue..."
,rastafarite,2008-03-22T11:30Z,blud r u jokin its taking ages 
,1stonep94,2008-03-31T20:53Z,"Currently downloadding,

; )"
,AG_Nemesis,2008-08-14T05:11Z,"People with sound issues, I have figuered out how to fix it, 
-Run down on Problem- The audio files kinda work, they are just mixed up,
-Solution- Get new audio files, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3801473/Bioshock_sound_files this is the link for them, down load them 

-installation- after the torrent go into your Bioshock folder and open Content, Sounds_window, Delete the files in there at the bottom, and Paste the new downloaded ones in. Simple as that"
,Copycat100,2008-08-24T09:38Z,"Seed please almost 60kb/s!

,TheBigHase,2008-11-07T10:10Z,"Installed and runs with no probs at all - patched to 1.1 with no probs at all - toed u r  da  king of games with a HEART for the poor! Thanx so much! :-) Bioshock sure is one of the most awesome games ever - the atmosphere is more thrilling than many Hollywood Movies (I'm sure there will be a film someday btw.) - it's really goood, highly recommended!  10!"
,TheBigHase,2008-11-07T10:33Z,OhOh! Happy too early! :-( After I have patched it it crashes after loading  - Question: Is patching possible or does this lead to this prob!? Thx for help!
,TheBigHase,2008-11-07T10:56Z,"...and the sound is mixed up - will try the sound files link posted here - btw. when it is not patched it runs , tried again - so I guess it can't be patched - well maybe someone knows more!? "
,Rick78,2008-12-03T23:31Z,Great game works fine so far iv had no sound probs at yet but ill see further into the game if any arise. so far all is good happy days :)
,TheBigHase,2008-12-13T12:08Z,"Mine works fine after installing the sound files!
How about the Patch - the game don't run after being patched?"
,bill857,2009-01-18T08:30Z,"Subzero:  On the mininova site for this torrent, it says you ""ripped"" the movies.  Does this mean you removed them?"
,GonGon1,2009-07-12T04:58Z,"Omg, the download is going slooooow.  It might be going for another day or two D:"

,RubberJohnny,2011-09-19T09:31Z,Game works Thanks for the upload. Unfortunately sound and subs were way out of sync. I am downloading the sound files now and will see if that works. I wont apply patch because i have seen numerous of issues expressed on here. 
,blastpower36,2011-10-29T16:47Z,dit is een slechte download   want  het download  niet   
,Equionox,2012-02-10T02:16Z,"Okay, to be generous I will now seed this torrent upon completion. This torrent deserves more seeders due to the fact that you CAN NOT find another working torrent (or any torrent that is 0 seeds) so this torrent is your best bet. Thanks guys and cheers. "
,Equionox,2012-02-10T07:45Z,In dire needs of more seeders. This torrent seems to be dead as of what I can see.
