Instead of waiting 13(!!!!!) days to your question, dont you think it will much faster for you to download it and find out for your self??

Some people should not be on the internet...."
,Frankillin,2007-11-30T22:08Z,"whokilledbambi,
To answer your question, I usually do download to find out to see if there's English subtitle on sample; However in over time I learned that not all sample showing subtitle eventhough it does have subtitle on DVDR afterward you download it ... AND I am DEAF. I truly dont want to waste any of my DVDR. Ask me before you bite me ~ GET IT?"
