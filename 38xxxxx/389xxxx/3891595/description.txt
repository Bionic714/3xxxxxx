Synopsis

Beowulf & Grendel tells the bloody tale of the warrior BeowulfÂ´s battle with Grendel, a great and murderous troll. In this throughly updated version of the seminal Angelo Saxon poem, the battle-scarred Norse hero Beowulf leads a troop of warriors across the sea to help an old friend,King Hrothgar whose kingdom is being ravaged by the marauding troll, Grendel.

However, BeowulfÂ´s attempts to fight the troll are thwarted when Grendel refuses to engage him in battle. When Beowulf meets Salma, a mysterious and sensual witch, his understanding of revenge is further complicated. Beowulf & Grendel powerfully entwines themes of vengeance, loyalty and mercy,stripping away the mask of the hero myth, leaving a raw and tangled tale that rings true today..
