,pistoncito,2007-11-16T21:06Z,"Yes, sorry, i forgot to put it in the name, There are FLAC files."
,pistoncito,2007-11-17T05:24Z,"Yes, the CD is the original that it's selling now in my country. I rip it with sound juicer in Linux directly to FLAC."
,tbone4690,2007-11-17T20:49Z,"Thank you! FLAC files are the best, love them."
,leswart,2007-11-19T18:54Z,how do you covert Flac to mp3 or 4?
,falcott,2007-11-22T06:46Z,"Is there a problem with Misty Mountain Hop, disc 1, track 5? It seems to stop abruptly at 4:43. Or is it a problem with my download?"
,Flyfisher61,2007-11-22T07:22Z,"I see no seeders, what's the problem?"
,falcott,2007-11-22T20:56Z,"From googled research, the length of Misty Mountain Hop seems okay, surprisingly...  "
,Styxx10,2008-02-17T00:46Z,"I have downloaded this twice, thinking if its FLAC , its good quality, both times, it has POPS and jumps throughout.....Don't waste your Bandwidth.....You have been warned..."
,_kewlCat,2011-06-13T18:14Z,"Perfect FLAC files through & through :).  I wore the vinyl version out a long time ago, digital sounds almost as good. Thanks for the jam :)"
