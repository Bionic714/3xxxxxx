,snoopymcpoop,2007-11-21T09:15Z,Thanks for this!
,s_hill38,2007-11-23T02:11Z,"This is excellent- the only track you got wrong was The Pixies' ""Wave Of Mutilation."" You put the intro version from their greatest hits album. The real version is way faster and rocks. Otherwise thanks! I had multiple copies of that track already anyway."

,shadowmoose,2008-06-13T09:55Z,The sound quality on some of these/most is just terrible.  I will not be seeding this.  I'm going to have to download most of these songs seperately because these ones do not meet my quality standards.
