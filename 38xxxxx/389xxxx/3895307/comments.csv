if anyone is interested in me putting together a full collection: email me a request at zerothdegree@gmail.com

(no offense to sandwichmonster. at least you have some good taste) "

My apologies, I got everything the store I buy from had but I generally don't bother with singles, live, or compilation albums but feel free to use any of this in another torrent.

Also it's in 256Kbps OGG not MP3 just to clarify (all of my music is)."
,kard23,2008-04-16T17:56Z,:-\ I don't like ogg...
,eric235u,2008-07-01T02:37Z,everything should be in ogg.  it's 'rms' free and superior quality.  thanks man.  can't wait to listen.
,wafflerevolution,2008-12-25T21:30Z,"missing ""wonder what's next"""
,pavonessa,2009-01-03T19:58Z,"""wafflerevolution"" I think you're referring to Filter's 2008 studio release ""Anthems for the Damned"" cuz' ""Whonder What's Next"" it's Chevelle's best album."
