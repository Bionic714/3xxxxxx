Description
Another rare album from the 80's that brings back memories for us who were around. 
This is an album that I (until now) haven't found in full anywhere on the internet. The album includes the original release of the huge hit "Maniac" which was part of the Soundtrack for the 80's movie Flashdance. The album is filled with great tunes with unusal titles. Many of the world's finest musicians participate and the songs are  typical for the 80's.


Relax, listen and enjoy...and make sure that you to seed it to others!
