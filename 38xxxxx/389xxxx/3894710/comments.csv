,NO_BS,2007-11-22T17:48Z,"Thank you!

PS: Please buy this game if you like it, people... It's a great game. Only rip off the shitty cash-grab titles.

I got STALKER from here, and after playing it, went out and purchased a copy. Some people actually do deserve our money...

Have some respect!

,pstterminator4,2007-12-22T14:14Z,"[NO BS]
My bad if i can get it working for free i couldnt give a shit about buying it."

,Artuir,2008-04-25T22:40Z,there's still people out there who use norton? get a real antivirus program. Norton sucks a dick.
,patrioticparadox,2008-05-02T04:58Z,yeah norton sucks balls

,gamerjasso,2008-06-03T21:34Z,Backdoor virus !
,gunnrose5,2008-07-08T04:24Z,"so does the keygen work or is it a virus/trojan?
can someone who actually donwloaded and tried it tell me?"
,sean_7,2008-07-19T09:39Z,if ya wanna do something smart by a old computer say a 98 or an early XP and hook it up to the internet put your security system on it and download from that if the program is virus free then transfer it to your good computer... you can pick them up for under $500 and a 500 GB hard drive would cost you what? $250 at the very most... if your think about it... it's cheaper then having to get it taken in every couple of months because your computer is full of harmful viruses... after a years time you'll be benefiting heaps...
,sean_7,2008-07-19T09:41Z,"I'm testing it now...
will let you know if there is viruses or not.."
,sean_7,2008-07-19T10:01Z,"worked a charm for me...
not one virus detected
but just to save you the trouble of downloading it heres the code

HJA2-CFVG-A2P3-Z6X4-1911"
,IGLOOMAN,2008-08-30T08:22Z,"I went ahead and tried to use it anyway. It didn't do anything for me but call up a cryptic error message - deleted.

Don't anyone bother with this shit, just use the key Sean posted. Not like offline play cares how many of us are using the same key, right?"
,evertos115,2008-12-18T03:09Z,"IGLOOMAN?

Have a nice day :)

Tested with NOD32, so please stop with the annoying virusalerts. Theres no virus and it works perfectly."
,vo_danh,2009-03-22T09:35Z,"If you want to blame someone, blame the software companies for keeping loads of money for themselves instead of using more of the profit to pay the developers, not the few users who are poor and downloading it, they wouldn't have bought it in the first place, they should be happy that that user got exposure to their work at all."
