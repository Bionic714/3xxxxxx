Raine Maida, the lead singer for the Canadian band Our Lady Peace. His first solo album following the release of his EP a while back. If you like it, go buy it! I'm putting this up here to spread his music because I'm pretty sure he cares more about being heard then getting paid. 

If you want me to seed, drop a comment or send an e-mail... I'd be more than happy to!

Thanks, Enjoy!
