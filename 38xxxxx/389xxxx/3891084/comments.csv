,gelbherz,2007-11-16T20:15Z,"Works perfectly so far. English fix mentioned above makes text and voice in english, easily. Bit of a system hog! Man, they dressed this game up a bit too much for my taste, but I'll give it a shot!"
,gelbherz,2007-11-16T20:16Z,"As far as gore, I didnt' notice ingame one way or the other, but the cutscenes have it! Don't think I'll even notice one way or the other. They scream real good when ye kill 'em, still - he he."

,gelbherz,2007-11-21T17:37Z,"Can anyone else PLEASE comment on whether you can save your games offline with this. I've played through several levels, and when I restart, they're all gone. I suspect you have to be online since the game warns me at one point that some features won't work offline.
Is there a crack or fix to beat this, if it's the case?"
,schlixx,2007-11-21T20:18Z,yeh i have same problem. are there no saves? maybe someone could upload a save? its quite confusing. and crashes at some times aswell...hmm
