Many Thanks to the Uploader! 

Now, I clicked the .exe and got the following screen: 

""Installer UI Mode Error

Installer User Interface Mode Not Supported

Unable to Load and to Prepare the Installer in GUI Mode."" 

Of course I got Java here, working fine. 

Any hints?

,M._R.,2012-06-14T05:13Z,"Neat little program, quite functional.

I'll just summarize the install instructions above for novices:

1. Extract with Winrar [free program from website, just google it].
2. Open the info file named ""Serial"" info file with notepad.
3. Go inside the folder ""Windows.install"", right click on the install file ""VT_Setup"", hit ""properties"", then go to the compatibility tab, click on the compatibility mode pull-down menu, click on ""Windows XP (service pack 2)"", then click apply and ok.
4. Install
5. When prompted, enter the serial from the notepad file you previously opened, and all is well. :)

Thanks for the torrent mt_dew."
