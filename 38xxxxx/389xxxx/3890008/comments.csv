,Xooxer,2008-02-09T00:36Z,gaiatry thanks so much for sharing. Can't wait to see this film. gurkhat  thanks for the subtitles link. I'll be sure to seed plenty. Everyone should see this great film!
,gurkhat,2008-02-09T12:05Z,"well I really liked this movie, but the video quality of this torrent is not very good. my guess is it was compressed with a constant bitrate and it means the quality degrades EXTREMLY much in the very psychedelic sequences towards the end. this movie really deserves good picture,
and 1.1GB should be enough if it was properly compressed. but it isn't. just so you know. it is still perfectly watchable 95% of the time."
,gaiatry,2008-04-18T00:07Z,i aint no pro in this...just ripped it and put it up...
,s___amson,2008-05-04T22:37Z,"Ehm.. the subs you linked are retarded. The English is subbed in english and the french is subbed in french, my issue is not with hearing... it is with the language..."
