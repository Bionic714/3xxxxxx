The western meets William S Burroughs in Blueberry, an hallucinogenic experience starring Vincent Cassel as world-weary Marshall Blueberry in the 1870s. Raised by injuns as a teenager, Blueberry's upbringing comes in handy when a group of greedy adventurers cross into Indian territory in search of buried treasure. Caught between his lawman's duty and loyalty to his adopted people, the Marshall finds himself embarking on a drug-fuelled trip into the heart of his own darkness. Looks like the West just swapped wild for weird.
