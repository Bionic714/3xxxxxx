The Abridged History of these releases.

Jon Carvajal: Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar
Asa Morris: Vocals, Acoustic Guitar
Steven Scotch: Drums

AandtheBKillers was a project that came out of 65, which was more of an experience, than a place or time (although it was DEFINENTLY a place). The basic idea of AandtheBKillers was to make acoustic music that, well, was cool all around. 

\\\"Tra-la-la-la-la, go fuck yourself\\\" this was written and recorded in one night, about 10 minutes longer than the actual record. In fact, three of the tracks were freestyled (we\\\'ll let you guess). This is the first recording from AandtheBKillers. It was only Jon and Asa at this point.  Early 2005.

\\\"AandtheBKillers\\\" was a promotional disc that was handed out to a few people here and there. It features some stuff from Tra La, but also a couple of newer demos, from the whole band. Late 2005.

\\\"Wow, This Sucks!! Live, Shitty and Acoustic, New Years Eve 2006\\\" This was the final (and only REAL) gig AB had. The set was actually about 10 songs, but Asa split his finger open during \\\"Boy on the Couch\\\" at the end, you might hear it. So, it was whittled down to the six here. Pure acoustic punk out, which really reflected the whole idea of AB at it\\\'s purest. This set was only Asa and Steven. (New Years Eve 2006)

\\\"Variedades\\\" this was the DVD that was only available to friends and family of the band. It chronicles the various stages of the band, from nearly the begining, right to the last rehearsal (\\\"Get it on Film\\\"). Featuring plenty of rehearsal stuff, recording bullshit, stuff from \\\"Wow, this Sucks!!\\\", and plenty of shit of us just being us. These are the DVD back up files, and can be burned like copying a DVD, or opened up in any video editing program and rendered to any other format for easier playback.

\\\"Demos in Various States of Quality\\\" is a collection of shit that isn\\\'t that good, but somewhat interesting to us. Too bad for you.


all releases copyright 2007 65music, except the shit we didn\\\'t write. :)

REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD THIS MUSIC SUCKS, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PERFORM OR RECORD IT AS YOUR OWN, AS YOU WILL BE HUNTED DOWN AND EATEN.
