If you want dancey, its there. If you want to dream, you can. If you want to take yourself away from it all, then go. Airport One is never blaring, harsh. It glides. And it is an experience from the first track to the last. Enjoy. And that's an order. visit the myspace music and search Airport One to visit a great site and have a listen while you read :)"
