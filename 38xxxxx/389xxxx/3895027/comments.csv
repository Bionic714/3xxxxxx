,MrAlabama,2008-02-11T10:00Z,I can't find swe sub to this release. Anyone?
,Praetor_810,2008-03-22T08:34Z,"It doesn't work on the PS3 because I didn't encode this for the PS3.  It's a DVD rip to XVID with mp3VBR audio (exactly as the filename says).  It's for playing on a computer.  If that's not what you want, don't download it.  I don't know what format is necessary for playing on the PS3.  I really don't care.  I don't own a PS3 and I never will.  If your setup requires specific formats, download appropriately.  If you're using bittorrent to get movies you might as well get a media computer hooked up to your television so there are no issues with encoding or formats.  But if you want to stick to your PS3, look for full DVD copies.  They're easy to spot, they're not ~700MB.  If you could figure out exactly what you're looking for that would make you a 1000x better leech.

It's easy to complain about something, but have you uploaded any torrents?

I'm also not a 'move releaser'.  I simply ripped a movie I had because someone I know wanted it on their laptop.  It happens to be a movie that is several years old and has probably made it around bittorrent many times over.  I figured I'd share it just in case anyone else wanted it.

There's also no subs and I don't know how to find them.  This file is offered 'as is'.  My DVD doesn't contain subs and even if it did I would've stripped them out.  It works exactly as intended.  It plays on the computer and as far as I've noticed, there's no file corruption."

,Praetor_810,2008-04-15T23:03Z,"It sounds like your computer lacks the proper codec.  Video files can be encoded a variety of different ways.  I encoded this file as an XVID.  You can get the proper codec here:

http://www.xvid.org/

DivX is another popular codec used.  You can get that here:

http://www.divx.com/

Don't bother installing the player, the toolbar or any other nonsense.  Just select the codec for installation.

If you have Vista you should also search Google for a ""Vista codec pack"".

You can learn a lot about codecs if you search Google for ""video codec"".

Wiki also has a good page about codecs:

,psychoticcherry,2008-04-21T05:51Z,"Thankz for the upload haven't seen this movie since my vcr quit working, can't find it on dvd anywhere. Great movie....

For the ps3 owners download ""dvdsanta"" and convert the .avi to dvd format then burn to a dvd (if you don't have a burner crawl out from under the rock and get one)"
