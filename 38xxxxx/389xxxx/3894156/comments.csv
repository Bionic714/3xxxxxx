,Xeonix,2007-11-17T20:13Z,"NeroMorte Nice work awesome upload,  The only problem I am having is with MQ2 . I was wondering if you could reupload it . I'm getting an MQ2Auth error"
,NeroMorte,2007-11-17T21:43Z,"Hi Xeonix,

Yea about the MQ2

You Run MQ2Auth.exe
Requires C++ 6.0 to Compile it

Let me first its not Recommend to use MQ2 it's Highly Traceable Meaning easy Ban.

With that said you can either use like Cheat-engine or Winhack v2.00 or T-search and Manual Enter the Hacks. Add me to MSN i can Explain more. DaHexor@hotmail.com

If you still want to use the MQ2 Double click MQ2Auth.exe and send me your MQ2Auth0.h File.

Good Luck"

,axillion,2007-11-18T21:22Z,"hi im newbi how to change !
can i get some help how to change to a private server i cant find the file ""%HOMEDRIVE%Program FilesSonyEverQuesteqhost.txt
or part of it thats is close to the name.
thanks"
,NeroMorte,2007-11-18T22:38Z,"Hi axillion,

The %HOMEDRIVE%Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\eqhost.txt just Type that in Window Run (Start Button -> Run)

The %HOMEDRIVE%Program Files is = to C:\Program Files IF your Main HARD Disk Drive is C if not thats what the %HOMEDRIVE% Does it Auto Detects your Main Drive.

Now if you installed the Game in different location then your kinda on your own But all you need to do is Go to where you installed the game then Look for eqhost.txt File and edit it.

Hope this Helps if Not Post Back.

P.S. you can Also Add me to MSN and Chat to me there More Live Like ( LCHexor@hotmail.com )"

,bjones62,2007-12-17T04:59Z,"Hey, I just dled this, installed beautifully, but I'm having problems getting onto the free server... it's probably because of user error lol.

I followed all your directions, then when I try to run EQ, it gives me an error message that says ""Please run EverQuest.exe""... so after several attempts, then rechecking like three times that I renamed the shortcut properly, and followed all directions, I found the original .exe, and tried to run that.  That didn't work either.

Please help??"

Question
  	When I install from the CDs, I get the error code 6001. How do I fix this?


Answer
  	The 6001 (or -6001) error code is an InstallShield problem, and is not directly connected to the game installation or the CDs.

This InstallShield error indicates a corrupt version of InstallShield is installed on your computer. To correct this issue, simply delete the following folder from your computer and attempt to run the installer again:

C:\Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\Professional\RunTime\0701

If this fails to correct the problem, we recommend you RENAME (not delete) the entire C:\Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\ folder and try again. You may rename the folder to anything you like, but we recommend something similar to 'InstallShield-old'. "

,alkore,2008-02-25T14:07Z,"Well this is no good here. I don't know what you are all doing to get this to work.

You say it is in .ISO also when you download the torrent in your client it says they are named .ISO , But when you download it and look at them they are not. They are .Rar then when you up rar them disk 4 will not extract the cab file says it is damaged. I have tryed everything i even sat there and downloaded this torrent TWICE! i would love to know how you all got this silly no good torrent to work.  So since this crappy one won't work i will just have to download disk 4 from some one who knows what he is doing."
,NeroMorte,2008-02-25T18:51Z,"Hey Bird113,

I've hear People Say it works with Vista i'm not really sure, Maybe when you get it download Comferm if it does or not.  Thanks Bird113 for offering to Help Seed once you get it."
,NeroMorte,2008-02-25T18:57Z,"Hey Himejime,

So you Download this it says complete and you get only a 17k File?

Thats weird i've never seen that before.

If you wish Email Me at LCHexor@hotmail.com with you IP, I will Personaly Try Uploading you my Copy and see if you still get same Problem.

Can also add me to MSN Live at LCHexor@hotmail.com and Chat with me more Live on the subject."
,NeroMorte,2008-02-25T19:07Z,"Hey Alkore,

I Dunnno what your Problem is First off Don't Diss Me I'm doing you a favor by giving you a Free Game.

Second I Do Say it's all *.ISO so Don't come off saying you getting RAR's because my Upload has not freaken RARs in it at all So you must be downloading from someone who Try RARing each ISO. then Start to Share it. I dunno what Noob would do such a Dumb thing. But i can Promise you it's not my Doing.

I Will Personal Send you CD's that are not working if you E-mail me you IP at LCHexor@hotmail.com

Now i Noticed Like 15 People Using Protocol Encryption, with my Personal Experience I've notice when you Enable this it 9/10 Corrupts whatever your download so i urge People to Disable this in there options.

So Alkore if your Done Dissing me Basically Calling me a Noob. And you really want to download this E-mail me Man and we will get this working for you Cause this is a Working Copy I've Share 450GB So Far now Doing Math on that it's About 136 People i Personally Uploaded this to Witch of only eeh i would say 7 People Had a Stupid Problem just cause there new to torrent or some shyt i dunno."

First of all, Daemon tools doesn't seem to be compatible with Windows Vista, so you will need an alternate .iso image reading software.  I used  this program called the ""undisker"".  The url is http://www.undisker.com/products/undisker/download.html

Basically, you'll use that program instead of the Daemon tools to extract the information from the  .iso files.  Once that is all extracted, simply find the  setup.exe file, and you should be golden as far as getting EQ installed.

From there, each server is a little different.  If you have any questions about SoD, though, I should be able to help.  < Trigunknives 007 @ gmail . com > is my email (obviously without any spaces.  I don't like being tracked).

Well i haven't Download this other torrent you Speak of thats 4.01GB Nor do i Care to but there can be many Reasons why one is bigger then other but don't mean one works and other doesn't just mean maybe he Included something extra with the game.

Now ur Other Question CD3 Error...

Thats not explaining much to me Computers Give out many Errors not just one type of error. So without more information there is no way for me to help you.

But i can tell you this i know for a fact 100% this Torrent Works and people even Confirmed it does.

Ur CD3 Maybe got Corrupted while it was downloading and there is nothing i can do about that it's one of few things.

1. Either a Made Modem the got Disconnected. and started back up a few bytes Ahead there for missing some

2. Bad Settings in the Torrent P2P Application you use.

3. Firewalls, Virus scanners can Cause Torrent to get Corrupted.

4. Bad Routers or Bad Router Settings.

thats all i can think of now unless someone care to put in some input.

I Suggest you Try Downloading Torrent again only this time just download CD3 if ur Torrent application don't let you pick what to download well that sucks i dunno what to tell you there other then use uTorrent it's the Best.

Anyhow hope this Helps Some and Explain your Problem alittle more to me so i can Help More i just Assumed by you saying Error you meant Corrupted.

NO WAY TO FIX A CORRUPTED FILE.... MUST RE-DOWNLOAD BAD PART OR PARTS."
,Jayblue8000,2008-05-04T12:08Z,"Hey,
First of all thanks a mil for sticking this up NeroMorte! And keeping it alive

Just a quick question though - i was getting about 50 kps up untill the 75 % mark - then i had to reboot my pc and when i started the dl again, my speeds were down at less then 10kps at best! right now its at 0.7kps

I tested out my connection with a test torrent and im getting speeds upwards of 100kps which for my 1mb connection is perfect.

My upload speeds have been about 8-10/11 kps which is normal - I have them maxed at 15 kps.

Anyone else get this slowing since last night?
Whats the story? I admit bittorrent mystifies me a bit sometimes!"
,NeroMorte,2008-05-04T21:11Z,"Hey Jayblue8000,

Yea i Was Proby connected to you Last Night. But then my Friend Came over and wanted to Play and EQ was Lagging cause he was Running 2 and i was Running 3. So i closed uTorrent hehe

If you still downloading it and feel like sharing ur IP Email me it and i'll Get you ur Last 30%"
,Jayblue8000,2008-05-05T00:21Z,"Yea still downloading it! 25 % left now ;) 
still slow -  that'd be great! 
you can mail me at jaylune@gmail.com and il reply with my ip, which hopefully works! otherwise, could be a long few days ;)

I notice the network status icon is yellow though, although im still uploading so i must be receiving incoming connections?

I should / will go to utorrent's site and post these issues course;)"

,NeroMorte,2008-05-09T18:30Z,"Hey DROOX,

This Torrent i First Started Hosting on Demonoid before they started getting into Trouble.

It Appears they Didn't update there Old Trackers or something cause there new Domain Doesn't think this Torrent Exist. so there for the Demonoid Tracker is Dead.

After Demonoid was Down for 2 Months i Figured they wasn't going to Come back so I started Hosting the Exact Same Torrent on The Priate-Bay.

There for that is why This Torrent has Both Torrent i Had Forgot to Remove Demonoid.

I Will Try Update it So it will work whatever Tracker you use."
,bendhist,2008-05-11T14:12Z,"hey NeroMorte, nice upload. i installed the game but when i tried to save the eqhost.txt changed thing you know Run>>>%HOMEDRIVE%Program Files thing it says it cant save and to make sure the path and/or file name is correct. i tried the alt ctrl del thing but it wasnt on the list. plz help!!

,NeroMorte,2008-05-14T20:47Z,"Hey bendhist,

I Don't Get how File can not Exist you people with this Problem must have Alot Admin security on your Computer.

Might sound Stupid But did you Try Save as... And Target EverQuest Folder?

Also on CD5 i have a Folder Named: Morte Extras

Then a Zip Named: Morte Extras.zip Open it up
Inside There goto Morte UI, Morte_Mix.zip

inside there is the UI i use but also i included the eqhost.txt and eqhost.bak witch is Original, Edited Text File just Copy em Both to EverQuest Directory if it Ask Replace click Yes and you should be Set to go.

Hope that Helps Some =)

Enjoy Gaming Hope to see you on:

i have one big problem, after downloading the files
i've tried using dameon andalcohol 120%, and after it installs the first disc it says it cannot find the path to the second disc.  i'm running this on windows vista, i'm not sure if that is whats causing the problem or not.   any help would be greatly appreciated.  i'm guessing it not the files themselves but rather something i've been overlooking.

,NeroMorte,2008-06-17T18:56Z,"Hey williedagod,

I'm Sorry i haven't Been on TPB in a few days.

To me it sounds like you didn't edit the Shortcut on your Desktop.

3. Now Modifying the EverQuest Shortcut.

Right Click the EverQuest Shortcut the Install Made. Goto: Properties

Now Change Target 

From: ""C:Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\EverQuest.exe""
To: ""C:Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\eqgame.exe"" patchme -w

Click Ok Button.

That Should Stop it from Trying to Patch to Live.

Then Just Double Check make sure you Edit Host File.

1.) Go to Run Type in ""%HOMEDRIVE%\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\eqhost.txt""
Without the Quotes

2.) Now Modify the file to look like.

[LoginServer]
Host=eqemulator.net:5998

Goto File, Save and close the File now.

,Sirbacca,2008-07-12T11:20Z,"Hey NeroMorte thanks for the torrent!

It downloaded great and your instructions were great but I ran into a problem when I was doing the private server setup part. You said to type in ""%HOMEDRIVE%Program FilesSonyEverQuesteqhost.txt"" in the run window but when I typed it in it said it could not find the file. I did a browse for it and found an ""eqhost.txt"" file and ran that which should be the same file...I hope. That was the only problem I ran into during the setup and install but now when I try to run everquest it wont start. I just get a windows error saying ""eqgame.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience"" I have double checked every step and everything is right as far as I know but it still wont work. Could you help me out?


Sirbacca"
,NeroMorte,2008-07-16T21:06Z,"Hey Sirbacca,

Yea it's a Typo, 

1.) Go to Run Type in ""%HOMEDRIVE%Program FilesSonyEverQuesteqhost.txt""
Without the Quotes

Should be

1.) Go to Run Type in ""%HOMEDRIVE%\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\eqhost.txt""
Without the Quotes

Now for eqgame.exe Crashing are you sure you computer can handle the Game?

Change or not Changing the eqhost.txt Has nothing to do with Game loading or not loading it only Redirects it to right Server.

P.S. this does not Connect to Server to Download Files you Delete So do not Delete Files it says to Delete.

Pretty much it just say Update your Video Card Drivers.

I'd Try that out.

Peace Sirbacca"

Nope Just Follow the Readme.txt i know it has few Error if i could fix em i would but when i try it compains that it's not downloaded 100% lol cause i changed it.

Then i would have to make a hole new Post here for Torrent it's just to much Trouble.

But Basicly the Readme is all you have to do.

,xanith1,2010-02-21T07:05Z,I for to tell you im using win7 it auto reads the iso's as though they were zip files I just extracted then to separate folders and then burned the entire system to 1 disc.. first disc 1 then the other files in there separate folders 2-5 while installing  it asks for the location of the files so I direct to the diff disc's on the main 1 the auto run loads and there ya have it

First off, I have Vista. If you do not have Vista this may not work to solve the problem.
What you need to do is right click the shortcut, and run the program as administrator. The reason for you having to do this is because your administrator settings are incorrect, and you might want to fix those if you don't want to keep having to open Everquest this way. Hopefully this helps somebody :P."

Use a third party patcher and server. Google will tell you what to do. And most decent free servers have detailed instruction even a literal retard can follow.

Thanks to those still seeding this pack. It is required for SoD and a few other nice free servers. And it is much quicker for most people to download it than to find their antique CDs.

If using Windows 7 you should not use that version of Daemon Tools. Just download the newest version of Daemon Tools Lite. It does everything you need."
