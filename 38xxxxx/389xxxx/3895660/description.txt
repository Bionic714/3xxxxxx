Carl Theodor Dreyer

La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc
The Passion of Joan of Arc
1928


With its stunning camerawork and striking compositions, Carl Th. Dreyerâ€™s The Passion of Joan of Arc convinced the world that movies could be art. RenÃ©e Falconetti gives one of the greatest performances ever recorded on film, as the young maiden who died for God and France. Long thought to have been lost to fire, the original version was miraculously found in perfect condition in 1981â€”in a Norwegian mental institution. Criterion is proud to present this milestone of silent cinema in a new special edition featuring composer Richard Einhornâ€™s Voices of Light, an original opera/oratorio inspired by the film.
