,sarrip,2007-11-18T01:13Z,Which version? The Usa or the French one? The longer (about 110') o the reduced one? Some extras? Anyway thanks for this masterpiece and (I assume becouse of the size of the torrent) for not compressing.

If it's Criterion then it must run 82 minutes.
Knowing Criterion (their DVDs are usually DVD9) I guess something must have been stripped/compressed. That's up to Apokarteron to clarify."
[T],Apokarteron,2007-11-18T22:08Z,I got if from Demonoid before it closed down :(

extras.avi requires resync (3 sec delay)
use Avi Mux for this.

,RexRexroth,2012-05-04T16:22Z,"This is a travesty: there is no decent copy of the Criterion edition of “Le passion de Jeanne d'Arc” on either Demonoid or The Pirate Bay.

The 4.33 GiB full-disc rip (VIDEO_TS) file is the exact same on both sites and the 10.9 MB part containing the extra features and color bars – VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_0.VOB – is corrupt and will not play.

The film itself, with the choice of silence, Richard Einhorn’s musical score (in stereo or 5.1 Dolby), or commentary tracks, seems to be OK, but I am not sure if you burn this to a DVD (isn’t that what a VIDEO_TS upload is for?) that it will play.

The corrupt file whizzes by in about one second (when played on VLC Media Player) and then the system crashes with a pop-up from “Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library” which states, “Runtime Error! Program C:Program FilesVideoLanVLCvlc.exe – This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application’s support team for more information.”

You then have to click “OK” to get out of the pop-up and close the VLC screen which has frozen with the last image from the corrupt video data (the color bars).

There is a reduced .avi version of the Criterion edition available, too, on TPB, but the synchronization is off by quite a few second on the bonus materials.

So all I can find that works are some grainy, un-restored .avi copies with a droopy old soundtrack which is very out of place.

Can somebody with the Criterion edition please correct this omission?

Thank you."
