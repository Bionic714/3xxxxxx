,Carobu,2007-12-12T03:20Z,"Dude, you totally slapped the satanic bible and rituals book in here took a bunch of other books from my collection rar'd it and reposted it as your own wtf?

My own release of the official EMBC is here
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3759268/The_Enlightened_Mans_Book_Collection
with the exception of the two satanic books it's got all these plus many new ones, is much more organized and is much better than my first 2 releases."
,golfing22,2007-12-12T03:29Z,"Dude, as an original ""ENBC"" subscriber, I am deeply offended that you would steal carobu's torrent, add 2 crappy books then use the same title.  You could have at least been creative to change the title."

,mistergroenevingers,2009-09-22T22:48Z,how come this torrent has 10 seeders when it's got major negative comments?
