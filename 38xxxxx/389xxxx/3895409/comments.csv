,SunDown13X,2008-08-14T01:18Z,"Doesnt work for me. Looks like this only works on the Master Edition... I have the regular CS3 and it doesnt work. It generates an invalid key.

Also for the record... (for that guy that said trojan) 99% of the time AV programs will see a key gen as a trojan... dont worry this one is save.

PS: i had a good key for my version of CS3 but after switching from XP to Vista it now needs an activation code"
