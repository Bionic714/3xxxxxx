,xenuismycopilot,2007-11-15T08:24Z,Yeah I couldn't find the delete button when I looked before but I located it now.
,xenuismycopilot,2007-11-16T06:35Z,Slightly less lag like 10% at the most.
,wilson-psp-hacker,2008-04-12T01:34Z,"Tried and tested works fine, brilliant all n64 classics in one well worth the download!!"
,gambetwar,2008-04-15T05:28Z,how come when i try to download this only a page appears that wieghs only KB when a zipped 250 mb is suppose to pop up... i already have the torrent so what do i do?
,LPsoldier88,2008-04-22T02:20Z,"can someone help me with this. all it says when i add is ""The Game could not be started (80020148)""

help would be appreciated "
,xenuismycopilot,2008-04-26T21:11Z,You need to download the 1.5 subset upgrade for M33. Go to dark-alex.org to find it. You'll also need the 150.EBOOT (1.5 firmware file.)
,arrowflash25,2008-05-21T05:42Z,does this work on 3.71 m33?

,bustamo,2008-08-06T10:40Z,"Hello, to get this working eg ""game cannot start"", make sure u have m33 firmware w/ homebrew support (like it says) and run a umd game, then go to 'home' (exit the game) then start the n64 game off the ms.

Very simple n00bs guide to play w/o UMD

---Make sure u copied the 'daedalus' and 'daedalus%' folders to the 'GAME' section which in the 'PSP' folder on the mem stick eg G:/PSP/GAME. 

ok now thats done...

---hold 'R' (right trigger) and switch on the psp to go into recovery mode. In the menu, go to 'configiration' and select the option 'umd mode' and press x so it says 'no umd'. While ur here u can make the umd region free so select 'free umd region' enabled.

--ok now go back to the beginning menu, go to advance -> advance config -> and make sure they are disabled. Then go to the beginning menu again and exit. Done. Easy as pie. 

Now u can play games off ms w/o umd and it should give no error. This works for all psp games that are on ms generally better for slim+lite but works for fat one as well."
