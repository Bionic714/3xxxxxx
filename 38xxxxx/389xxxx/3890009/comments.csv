,zandora,2007-11-14T06:42Z,"There is no unlock code required.

Will install fully to PC so no DVD required in drive while using MapSource.

BTW, this version has Land elevation contours with elevation shading on the PC.

All of USA including Alaska and Hawaii will fit on a 4 GB micro SD card with about 3/4 of a GB to spare, if transferred in chunks or manually."

,1sh0t1kill,2007-11-19T06:23Z,"I downloaded and installed. This works perfectly and best of all, it's FREE! Thanks Zandora. 

""F"" these people who want to charge for ""unlock codes"". Thanks for remembering what the torrent world is all about. "
,PreDeadMan,2007-11-23T05:19Z,do you need an sd card for it to transfer to the unit or can you do it VIA usb cable? i'm ordering this gps unit i want to have the updated map prepared for when i purchase it thanks
,zandora,2007-11-24T17:48Z,"You can transfer maps using the USB cable. There is a limit on the number of items (map segments, tracks, etc.) you can upload at one time. I bought a 4GB SD micro but it is flaky, as many readers don't see it all. The best card to get is probably the 2GB SD micro.  You will want some kind of card as the 60CSx has only 256MB of internal memory."
,1sh0t1kill,2007-11-26T03:49Z,"Zandora, 

If you want an unlock code for 2008 NT make a bogus email, post it here, once I see it, I'll contact you at that email address. "

,zandora,2007-11-26T19:12Z,"AFAIK, no ""Topo"" products from Garmin support routing, and they do not require unlock keys.

All their routable products like City Navigators require some kind of unlock key."
