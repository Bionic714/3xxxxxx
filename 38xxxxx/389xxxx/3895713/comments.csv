,mightybutch,2007-11-17T03:55Z,Yeah tnx but why not seed???
,BloodLogic,2007-11-17T19:47Z,"It is being seeded.  It's just reporting zero seeds now because they're still doing work on TPB tracker.  Right now I'm only seeding with 75 peers, and it's now at 89% availability.  Almost done...  I hope the people at TPB get the reporting of seeders/leechers to be accurate.  As anyone can easily tell, the numbers reported on any TPB torrent for seeders/leechers is about one tenth of its actual number; sometimes just reporting a zero for the newest ones.  Besides that one issue, TPB is the ideal, torrent community."

just download the torrent and give it awhile to start and see for yourself if theres any seeders."

Some douches have decided to put only the eps on private trackers, as we can see on mininova."

,BloodLogic,2007-12-01T19:14Z,"Sweet.  It looks like the stats have been somewhat repaired.  wtg, tpb guys!  And thanks for all the comments people.  Remember that I upload entire seasons of many other shows, plenty from Adultswim.  Check it out: http://thepiratebay.org/user/BloodLogic/

Trying to upload some new stuff at the moment, but the tracker is acting pretty weird right now.  Peace!"
,BloodLogic,2007-12-01T19:30Z,"Wait, nix that.  I just had to log out and back in, and now it took my new torrent.  Yes, all for season 1 of Snoop Dogg's television show.  What a big loss that would've been if I didn't up that. ;)"
