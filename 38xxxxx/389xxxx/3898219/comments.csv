,JoakimLj,2007-11-18T17:33Z,Thanks.. Hope this is a good one!
[T],lkobescak,2007-11-19T17:19Z,Yes I liked it.  Some may see it as sympathetic to the troubles in Iraq.  I see it as how you skillfully design a problem which you must continually have a presence to resolve.  Think of it as a roadmap to de-civilization.
,chatavi,2007-12-01T04:25Z,"Ikobescak has a good point..design a crisis thinktanks, military ind complex, aggro bureaucrats and then spend about a trillion dollars (revealed so afr) to solve it..imagine a 15% spinoff..for democracy..."
,atom224,2007-12-24T05:28Z,we could have fixed iraq the first time for about 1/1000 of the cost and zero loss of life.  I'm always amazed at how we think we can win friends by dropping bombs on their heads.
,sing_sling,2008-01-06T12:27Z,"I'm amazed at the intelligent comments for this movie - it make a nice change from the usual diatribe of insults and horrendous English. 

The abuse by the military industrial-complex goes back to wat before even Eisehower - and given his background as a General, isn't it even more poignant coming from him?! 

Iraq is very much like a film sponsored by Coca Cola or BMW . . . The Iraq War, brought to you by Haliburton. 

Tragic"
,emandem,2008-01-13T13:19Z,It seems to me that our comments are supposed to be about the quality of the movie that we download not for us to be critics about the content. We're not movie critics. As far as the movie is concerned it is of good quality (video and audio). Both are clear. It is a good movie to download and downloads in a short time.  Everything works fine and is in English. Has no closed captions nor subtitles. Thanks to Ikobescak for uploading it for us.

,furtherdown,2008-02-16T15:04Z,The hate comments I generally hear on the streets are about white people.
,Amerifox,2008-03-06T21:29Z,"The only thing we can do to help these facists do nothing at all! Never say we can't do anything for we are men and women and we are alive, and if they are men and woman and are alive AND have done something then there is no reason that we cant do anything. We are many and they are few, all we can do for now is get the word out, change the minds of the people EVERYWHERE not just your own country, from complacent to open-minded, and then come together as a whole of humanity, I say xenophobia and a discrimination is nothing but a falicy, a burden on the growth of the human being as a whole And now that the world has become smaller (metaphorically) with flight and that the information world has become more diverse, we only have more power to come together, more strength then ever before, i say ignroe the disinformationists and the sceptics, and allow them to come to mind of thier own time when theyre ready, but as for us, those who are willing to work together... those who are willing to become HUMAN we can rise up and make the world a better place for all... not just the better place for some! Eventually everyone will come with us, i know in my heart theres a better way than what these silver-spooners are doing, and i may be a spoiled assed american but i am trying, i am trying to do what i can for everyone, and everything for that matter, and i think we should all join together, as a band of all people not just a group under another group, a round table to a square one, a flat plane to a pyramid, true equallity is our last hope as a human race, lest we be doomed to repeat our past mistakes... oh and dont take my speculations as gospel, take them, think about them, and make your own, but for the love of all things be open-minded about it!"
,Amerifox,2008-03-06T21:30Z,"thank you pajaco for blaming the goverment and not us, weve been under control for years and only now are a minority of us seeing the light, i hope everyone in the world will understand what i see, as that we are all one people and need to work as one if we are to change the world"
,rdean007,2008-03-24T03:49Z,"Yeah, it is worth noting that bush has like high teens low twenties approval ratings atm.  Anyway, I took the main point of the film to be: we could have won but did not because our (Americans) leaders are incompetant."
,sith7,2008-04-11T05:35Z,rdean007... it has nothing to do with incompetence.. every move they make is an intelligent one.. they are right where they want to be.. which is causing unrest and killing innocents in the middle east.. same as they've been doing since the early 80's. 
,sim0b,2008-04-14T14:34Z,"Hi everyone, I need some help...! Im using Roxio 9 to burn my ISO downloads onto disc which works successfully if my downloads are ISO only.

,NFLMAN,2008-06-07T20:09Z,U.S. Armed Forces occupy the Middle East for one reason: PROTECT ISRAEL nothing else is important to U.S. leaders.
,Moviebro,2008-09-02T19:35Z,"Trillions of dollars that could have been spent on: A) Education System that needs lots of work B) Fix Roads C) Get the poor on their feet D) New Gas Alternative Technology E) Getting more people educated, that can't pay for school F) Actually helping people in the Middle East as in helping to make their daily life better, so they don't become terrorists. Beats bombs G) Health care for every American Citizen. I believe a trillion could cover it. I could go on and on. Iraq is simply a clusterfuck."
,skullfcukyou,2008-10-17T18:41Z,wicked doc. the iraq war was going better than expected. This was unacceptable for profit-from-war driven corporations. The Iraq war was bobbled on purpose so it would last as long as possible. This was seen before in vietnam. treasonous bastards.
,Graham Wellington,2009-06-23T17:13Z,"No war on Iran. Wake up and THINK. Do YOU want ANOTHER IRAQ style war??! There will be a lot more than 4000 Americans killed this time. Gas at $30 a gallon. Nuclear exchange and contamination of oilfields to make sure it stays that way. Massive debt, probably TRIPLE the already huge amount we have now! This means we will have massive inflation - $50 for a loaf of bread. Can't afford it, maybe you can seek relief in a FEMA camp. THINK before you let the media TRICK you into another WAR!"
,geelad1212,2010-02-19T01:15Z,think i have stumbled onto a thread on political chit chat.  so is the quality on this any good then.

This is what we get for being evil, or at least encouraging evil with our ignorance."

,J2daR23,2011-07-13T02:52Z,"This country is fucked... Its ran by a money hungry government that only wants to grow bigger and stronger. Our government wont be happy until it has control over the world. My greatest regret was being born into this shitty ass country. We The People need to wake up and stop sleep walking at here. That shit can only get dangerous for you. Ive never understood why we feared our government when we actually out number it. To those out there thinking this movie is a set up and its bashing christianity, the government and other bullshit. Take the time to ask yourself this, Whens the last time your government showed up to your door giving you some of that money they borrowed to fund these damn ass wars? (which only made our economy weaken). Whens the last time your government stood up for you when you were being attacked? Whens the last time your government said to you ""Its Ok, ill fight this battle for you?"" If the bible is so sacred and to live your lives by it brings complete happiness and joy to all. Why in the hell are we in this FUCKING situation? Why doesnt all of humanity read out of this Bible? When your born, why dont you get a bible along with your smack on the ass (birth certificate/ssn/name)? Life isnt that easy that someone can write/read a book (The Holy Bible) and it tell them every answer to their questions to come in life. (Ive read the bible, and actually had more questions then b4 i read out of it.) Thats where our government failed when creating it. Think of it as your child, your child will believe anything and everything you say. If you say jump, your child will say ""how high mommy/daddy?"". If you raise your child in a room his/her whole life and only fed them what you wanted them to know. That child would be a walking, talking, spitting image of whatever you taught them. Well I hate to break it to you, but WE are the children of this government. And they have put us in a room and spoon fed us whatever they wanted us to know. They put us in a box and told us to stay like a dog in a kennel. Well i cant stay, I refuse to stay. I wasnt brought into this world to follow. I was brought into this world to lead. I wasnt brought into this world to just exist. I was brought into this world to make a difference. "
,Doowangle,2012-07-11T04:19Z,"Almost every comment here can be summed up simply

'I took a college class, I know more about these things than anyone in the government. They are all stupid' 

'I've got it figured out, all we need to do is ...'

Its ironic how the same arrogance and stupidity mix that this film showcases is also most apparent here. "
