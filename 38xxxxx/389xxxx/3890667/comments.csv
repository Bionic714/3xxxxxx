,6691username,2008-01-17T05:41Z,"Would somebody please seed this one, I had 95% of it then it went dead :-("
[T],flixer,2008-04-16T11:34Z,"My apologies. Because this was created as a multi-tracker with Demonoid and Zero, I thought it had died when both those trackers went down. I just realized that TPB had been included and that there were people stuck. Very sorry! I'm seeding now and will repost on other sites to keep this one alive! Will be posting other new ones too!"
,DarkRoast,2009-08-21T06:02Z,Thank you!  I'm seeing all the ones I've downloaded.
