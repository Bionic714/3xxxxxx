Boris Karloff's THRILLER
Season 2 Episode 11 

"Dialogues With Death"  

Thought it was about time to see Karloff actually acting in a thriller. Two separate tales: In "Friend of the Dead", a morgue attendent seems to be able to have conversations with the corpses, and in "Welcome Home", a young couple arrive at the home of their aunt and uncle who seem to believe the pair are dead.
