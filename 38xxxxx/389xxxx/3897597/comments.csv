,rivion81,2007-12-17T07:25Z,"jesus fucked little boys, i know my mommy told me so"
,stylishirish,2007-12-22T22:55Z,"...and all that talk so close to christmas... damn... well... anyway... this is an awesome torrent...all the movies are the 2004 release (i think)....meaning that episodes 4-6 are redone for special effects, storyline continuity, and some scenes added, deleted...which...when i watched them all i was really really impressed and felt like a little kid watching them again.

any starwars junkie will appreciate them all on 6 cds -- the quality is great... not dvd... and this is the only type of film i would say that about...the special effects and having so many scenes and chararacters that arent really there...and all the theatre shaking sounds....well...it is a great torrent....but just know that it is what it is and it isnt quite the same as dvd..... very very very close though =)"
,redtagpalmer,2007-12-24T13:59Z,how is quality
,stylishirish,2007-12-25T09:43Z,quality is definitely worth the download! 
,Brogdel,2007-12-29T07:38Z,213 seeds!  I'm  a big Star Wars fan and I'm glad everyone is enjoying this.
,musicboyxiii,2008-01-01T16:25Z,"It's a fantastic upload! 
I have over 270 seeders, so thanks everybody!

PS: You can download the movie you like if you're using Âľtorrent (for example only episode III) "
,tanel952,2008-01-07T16:33Z,"Im stuck at 89.8 but if i press info and put open folder it wont put out the movie in windows media player only the sounds do i have to download bs player or some other program or is it just a mistake
that it has to download to 100% "
,stylishirish,2008-01-09T14:47Z,"FYI - vlc can tweak the audio sync simply... its ctrl-k and ctrl-l .... you can also tweak aspect ratios as well ... video menu ... show advanced... and you can put in your own aspect and crops in 00:00, 00:00 format... then right click when the film is playing and change it up... i have a 16:10 flatscreen so i have to tweak it most of the time anyway... just fyi

thank you again for this torrent! it is great quality and they are the 'redone' (2004) releases i believe so all the extras and effects are in there for story continuity with the episodes 1-3 an to add a bit more to the experience... this is a must have for any star wars fan :)"
,joelovell,2008-01-11T14:33Z,"Thanks for the upload!
But please, seed more people. =]"
,xxdaxx,2008-01-14T18:41Z,Brill torrent...May the Force be with you!!!
,tsw_gnaget,2008-01-26T13:17Z,"Do you think you should watch all the movies according to their release dates:

Star Wars (1977) IV : A New Hope

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)

____________

Or should you just watch them in order:P

Because it seems more fun to watch them in the order of the release dates..:P"

,Wayfarer247,2008-03-26T00:39Z,"Yes, I would be interested in the Quality of the Movies.  ~600 MB per Movie probably isn't going to result in the best Quality, but the compression rate is nice..."

I wanna rip the
ORIGINAL UNTOUCHED TRILOGY DVD
to a decent sized pic, good quality, about 700mb, to seed, but havnt got the first idea of what to use!?

If anyone would want that, please help?"
,PAWZ76,2008-05-15T14:38Z,"To play with the right aspect ratio, just get 'vlc' (it plays almost everything) and while its playing you can go through all the aspect ratios by pressing 'a'. And if any of those arent right you can put your own ratio in in the settings!"
,snakepro7,2008-05-28T10:57Z,hey thnx for uploading this torrent...but im stuck at 75%...plz seed for a couple of days after downloading...it would really help those still on the track...
,texasdragonman,2008-05-31T04:18Z,"zakimar..... in the many years i have used pb i have never made a comment other than thankyou's to the people uploading.... how ever in this case i feel i must. episodes 7, 8, and 9 were never made. and lucas has said that he has no intention of ever allowing the screen plays for them to ever be produced. and one last thing about all your racist comments if you are going to pick under represented countries, do your home work and pick countries that dont have a history of attempted genocide huh...?!?"
,Sunderas,2008-06-07T02:15Z,Thanks a lot
,taijim,2008-06-14T18:55Z,Thank You I finally got all of them and the Quality is great
,ryanasaurs23,2008-06-22T14:29Z,"Thank god someone else said something...

There will be no VII, VIII, or IX, and has not been one already.

There are scripts for them on Supershadow.com, but they are obviously fake as he says he got them from Lucas because he is his only and truest friend, the movies will be released in 2019, and Mark Hamil, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher are already signed on, and there is supposedly already a trailer (for a movie coming out in 11 years).

Also, it appears the he is saying that not only will Darth Maul be in the new trilogy, but so will Mace Windu, The Clone of Anakin Skywalker, The Force Ghosts of Qui Gon Jinn, Aunt Beru and Owen Lars... also, Quinlan Vos, Darth Bane and Exar Kun are supposed to be in it....


Exar Kun existed many thousands of years before Luke, Leia, and Han, and Darth Bane over 1000 years.


Basically, there is, and never will be a third trilogy."
,OSXdundermifflin,2008-07-02T06:27Z,"seed please :]. stuck at 0.9 for the last hour or so!

,john0pain,2009-07-05T12:01Z,"actually, George Lucas wrote a script for atleast one more movie. It is about Luke's Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. But he has said for hiumself that he won't do any more star wars. But maybe someone else will pick up the saga? :3"
