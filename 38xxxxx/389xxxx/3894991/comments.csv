,chumbucket,2008-05-16T16:29Z,Can we get a seeder to help us out on this one? There's a bunch of us stuck at 85%.
,miensch,2009-01-18T19:17Z,"Video is good quality for an old grainy/blurry movie. Audio is excellent quality (and is hosted by Rod Serling!). Audio is _uncompressed_ PCM (like CD)! That is why the file is so large. I converted this into a MKV file with video stream copy, and the uncompressed PCM compressed to FLAC, and the resulting file size is 578.3MB with no loss in quality.

Video: DIVX 640x480 24bpp 29.970fps 1200.5kbps
Audio: uncompressed PCM 441kHz 2ch s16le 1411.2kbps
Runtime: 52:27"
