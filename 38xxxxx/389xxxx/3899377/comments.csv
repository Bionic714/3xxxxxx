,PlinkOh,2007-11-21T21:34Z,"Some have moved onto a private BT tracker. The rest of us are on Winmx OpenNap. Get on there and I'll send you an invite to the private server with chat. There will be a lot of people there you know.

You need an older version of winmx, like 3.31. Private server bans higher versions, and you have to share at least 3 gig.

install, Use the same name you did on Demonoid, run winmx, disconnect from Public P2P, goto OpenNap, Inport .WSX

Connect to one of these servers, I'll be able to find you.
