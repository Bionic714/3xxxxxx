Just my 2 cents."

[T],oddeven,2007-11-21T01:54Z,"It's pretty simple if you have DVDShrink, a free program (you don't have to shrink the iso, but it will remove the regional encoding when it creates the file).
All you'll need to do is link the torrent to the iso (I don't know which client you're using so I can't be too specific).  It will only be one file, so you don't need a folder.
If you put it up uncompressed, downloaders can decide whether or not to compress it, as well as what parts they might not want.  Of course, there will also be some who don't know what to do with any DVD9 file (I'm only guessing that your discs are DVD9, they might need no compression).  Good luck."
