,squeegn4t3,2008-08-07T21:25Z,"you can't ss this to iTunes because it is a FLAC file

If you convert the Flac's to Apple Lossless, they'll play. Just download dbpoweramp, and you can convert them.

Here's the link to it. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4880524/dBpowerAMP_Music_Converter_13.1_(Retail_-_Full_Codecs)_%5BRH%5D"
