Of all the horror films of recent decades, few can claim the notoriety achieved by "Centipede Curse" a harrowing 93-minute vision of Asian hell that left film festival patrons alternately wigging-out and gagging. More than living up to the hype, the film went on to a successful release on a VHS, but as of 2006, remains thankfully unavailable on DVD, with good reason: Despite the misleadingly innocuous title, this is heavy stuff indeed though rewarding for those who can take a hefty dose of angst with their grue. The film lingers on in your head, rattling around like a nightmare too hellish to forget.

The denouement of Centipede Curse is extremely gruesome; Sam Raimi says this is the most frightening movie he has ever seen, and its likely to stay in the mind of many viewers for quite some time afterwards. You'll have seen gorier, for sure, but seldom has such grue been delivered with such solemn conviction. It is thoroughly nasty, and even I, a David Cronenberg fan, had to watch it through my fingers! If you don't find the sight of a woman belching up a series of over-bloated centipede husks and assorted maggots out her own throat disturbing, I fear for your sanity...
