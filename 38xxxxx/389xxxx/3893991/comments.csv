TwiztidTim: Sorry, could´nt understand a word you said. Speak English please."
,nikson,2008-02-15T11:09Z,"Why so cocky and unpolite Karlen? There is no movie named ""For a few Dollars"" (För en handfull dollar). The movie you are referring to is ""A fistful of Dollars.  Now you gotta ask yourself who really is the retard here. An apologize would come in handy.  "
,fartillhelvete,2008-07-06T14:16Z,"There is a movie called ""For a few dollars more"", you motherfucking swedish retards. 

Lee van Cleef is in it and it's a kick-ass movie. Just watch the first couple of scenes and you'll see why - or at least go to IMDB.com before making your sorry lives known to humanity.

Thanks for a great seed, Karlen."
