Just because it may be different from mainstream thinking doesn't make it groundbreaking.  The reason mainstream thinking is mainstream is because it makes sense to experts and laypeople.  Time to grow up and think like an adult.  Or you're 17, and will eventually grow up on your own."

If you have been looking at what I am seeding, you have wasted more time at this than I have.  Just because I have seeded something, does not been I subscribe to it.  I view these videos as for fun.  They are entertainment.  If you are looking for enlightenment, I would suggest you put the remote down, get up from your computer desk and go outside.....

Let the light shine on you!  Cuz you won't be able to do anything else with it...."

 Time to embrace the new paradigm and the absolute and total magic of the universe of which the ""Arc"" is a very small part.
 Onement brotherhood and peace. "
