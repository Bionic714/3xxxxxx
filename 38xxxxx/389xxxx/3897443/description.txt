An Amatuer archaeologist discovers the lost Ark of the Covenant in Jeruselum 1981

The footage seems compelling.  I have not been able to locate it in better quality

yet but I am still looking.  For now this will have to do.


    - Shows the Location of the Crucifiction

    - Shows the Location of the Tomb

    - Shows the Location of the Hidden Temple Artifacts (Ark of the Covenant)

    - Offers an Explaination to the relevance of the locations to each other.


Amazing Stuff, whether you are a Christian or not.  


Help me Seed !!!
