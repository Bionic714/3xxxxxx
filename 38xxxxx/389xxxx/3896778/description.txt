This is all of the songs by fiddler Hanneke Cassel on her album "My Joy" and one song from the album "Silver", in .ogg format.

This has been uploaded due to the severe lack of Hanneke torrents on the net, so I'm uploading my not-so-complete collection so more people can enjoy and appreciate great fiddle music.
