,keltern,2007-11-18T13:47Z,"Scalper: I have somewhat the same problem.. But have you tried setting the affinity to just one of the cores of your CPU? I'm not sure if this game supports multiple cores..?

Either way, this game seems heavier to run than previous NFS versions.. :\"
,scalper,2007-11-18T13:53Z,Keltern: How do i do that?
,keltern,2007-11-18T14:12Z,"Scalper:

When the game is running, Alt-Tab to windows and go to the task manager. Choose processes, and look up the nfs.exe, right click and choose ""set affinity"" or something similar.. :) Just make sure only one of the cores are processing the game. 

However, if this doesn't have any effect on how the game runs, undo these changes.."

,mikesoft,2007-11-19T06:31Z,"It's necessary sometimes to limit your upload rate, especially if you are using a DSL connection, upload rate can hog your DL rate, my connection is 1024Kb/s (120KB/s download, 60KB/s upload) so I have to limit upload to about 40 or 50KB/s, sorry, but this is how things work in venezuela.

,hardstyler67,2009-07-12T14:12Z,"how to download Need for speed pro street crack for dummies (no fail)

this will solve everyones problems!!

STEP:

1: download the 'Need.For.Speed.Pro.Street-RELOADED' torrent (safe)

2: download with utorrent or whatever

3: once downloaded make a file in your documents to extract the NFSPS files into.

4: download PowerISO

5: extract(NOT MOUNT) with powerISO (dont worry about registering it unless you want to keep using it, if so just down the keygen for it pritty simple).

6: now double click the 'EASetup' application, but, if this fails to work open the torrent file on powerISO and right click the 'EAsetup then it will go.

7: When asked to enter the serial code just open the keygen in the crack file and away you go (if you get a probem saying it cannot find the 'nfs' (application) file just simply click ignore.

8: when installed DO NOT run nfs pro street or else it wont work, where the new nfs file is in your documents place the crack 'nfs' file into it and to be sure (because im unsure) place that same crack file into the file that you made to extract all the nfs files into and click copy and replace (for windows vista) but just make sure you replace the other one :).

NOTE: if you come accros the problem when clicking the EAgames file and it says file 'd3dx9_34' Dll file just type it in on google and download that file and extract with winrar or XAce (which is what i used).

*if you do have more problems it may be the cause of your graphics card of memory of your RAM which is something i cannot help you on :(

*I am using windows vista and runs well, and once on the game make sure if you have a standard CRT monitor change the resolution to around 1024 x 768_60herts or to what ever your monitor resolution settings are.

the games quality is real good just make sure your computer is running fast and you will have no problems"
