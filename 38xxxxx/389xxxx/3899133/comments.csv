,S_A_i_T_E_k,2007-12-29T13:46Z,"I understand you all. i had problems with playing .avi to.. but when they are finished i just played them in winamp and it worked ; ). if you don't like winamp then use VLC or Quicktime Pro. it's better downloading quicktime and have the full payd version ( by that i mean dl serial key/keygen :P ) Try diffrent players untill you find one you want. otherwise if u have no music. play some of your favorite music in another player while playing the movie. Enjoy!
And thanks again steffo. Great Ski movies. Keep it up!  / SAiTEk"
