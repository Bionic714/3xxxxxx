Great band. Their first demo. Worth a listen. Promise

From the deapths of southern Sweden, in a place not commonly known as Rockville, the band Logan Nevada saw its first daylight a little bit over a year ago and since the band probably was hung over they didnÂ´t like the sun very well that morning. The first demo contains nine songs and the albumcover.

enjoy.
