During the 1970s and 80s, horror and gore films made up an important part of the Shaw Brothers repertoire, and many of them came from the hands of horror master Kuei Chih Hung. One of the Shaw Brothers' key directors during the studio's golden years, Kuei was a versatile filmmaker who dabbled in a range of genres, but his signature was undoubtedly gore, and usually of the extreme, stomach-turning variety. With infamous titles like Killer Snakes, Corpse Mania, and the Hex series, Kuei sealed his named into the top ranks of cult cinema. His elusive 1981 classic Bewitched, the precursor to its notorious 1983 sequel The Boxer's Omen, is now finally available on DVD.
