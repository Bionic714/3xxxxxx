,saladxead,2008-08-28T22:36Z,"Has anyone got this to work with this version of the game? 

""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3736514/Resident_Evil_4__%5BPCDVD%5D%5BMULTI5%5D%5BPATCH_1.10%5D"""
,Nomiss009,2008-08-31T08:04Z,"I'm pretty sure I used that version. All you have to do is put the folders you get from the rar files in the same folder you find the xfile.dat and xscr.dat (haven't played RE4 for a while, but I think that's what they're called) files in."
,onteanqui,2008-09-25T18:30Z,"Yeah, it work very smoth, like Albert say ""this is best than the original fro ubisoft"", and works in any vers铆贸n of the game.

Play for ever...."
[T],ooStevo,2008-11-15T01:51Z,"This does work very well,and for resi 4 fans id recommend it.It does away with all those pathetic PS2 textures and replaces them with more 'suitable' ones."

,rob360115,2009-02-01T12:16Z,"Hi,

,trippay,2009-03-08T12:23Z,i was wondering why the 1.10 version still looked like shit after all the screenshots i've seen that seem to imply otherwise.  this clears things up.
,link1438,2009-04-27T23:01Z,"This is a general improvement mod, that increases all the textures in the game to GCN Quality +.

A recommended download from The RE4 PC Modding forums."
