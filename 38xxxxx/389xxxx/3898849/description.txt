This is the official 6 Disc World Of Warcraft by Blizzard entertainment.

Burn each folder (Disc #) to a *Seperate* CD (each folder gets its OWN cd) ,

After that is done, put in disc 1, then click install on the window that pops up.

When it asks you for disc 2 pop in disc 2, so on and so forth,

after they arew all done, restart your PC, and run WoW!

Enjoy! 

*NOTE* You will need an ISO program to Open it with, and it might not work to mount.
