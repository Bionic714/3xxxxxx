                         Clint's Mix Presents: PT Request #1



SHOW: VH1 Legends- Grateful Dead
SIZE: 2.92GB
LENGTH: 44 Minutes
FILE TYPE: "Ready To Burn" VIDEO_TS Files
SOURCE: VHS (EP Master)>Panasonic DMR-EH75V HDD (XP)>DVD-R

NOTE: The master VHS of mine was a bit old so there are a couple spotty moments in the transfer that could not be corrected. I should also add that the commercial cuts are pretty abrupt due to the fact I was 15 years old at the time and wasn't as picky  about the way I record things these days, which also explains why I originally taped it in EP speed as well. This is still completely worth the download, especially if you've never seen this episode of Vh1 Legends.
