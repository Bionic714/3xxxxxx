All star cast in a brilliant farce about American politics.

After being caught in a scandalous situation days before the election, the president does not seem to have much of a chance of being re-elected. One of his advisors (DeNiro) contacts a top Hollywood producer (Hoffman) in order to manufacture a war in Albania that the president can heroically end, all through mass media.
