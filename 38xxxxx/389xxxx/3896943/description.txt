his is a perfect sync of Stanley Kubrick\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\"2001: A Space Odessey\\\\\\\" (from the Jupiter chapter on) and Pink Floyd\\\\\\\'s hit \\\\\\\"Echos\\\\\\\". 

a little history:

--When film maker Stanley Kubrick was making 2001, a Space Odyssey, he asked the band to contribute to a predominate part of the sound track. Krubrick is suspected to have requested selections from \\\\\\\"Atom Heart Mother\\\\\\\" but obviously, Floyd turned him down. Roger Waters had been quotes as saying that this was one of the few career moves he ever made that he \\\\\\\"truly regretted\\\\\\\". 2001 was released in 1968, and Meddle was released in 1971.--

   Both the song and final chapter line up perfectly being 24min. a piece. I lined up the first \\\\\\\"ping\\\\\\\" from the Echos song and the chapter title appearence. It\\\\\\\'s pretty clean and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did the first time I saw it!!!
