,radar201,2007-12-23T00:06Z,"4X-AXG, I'm new here and I've downloaded quite abit and I would like to give back to the FS community. I've been trying to upload MegasceneryX Las Vegas but it seems to take too damn long to upload or I'm not doing it right. Any suggestions.  Also I would like to request Captain Sim Hercules C-130 for FSX please help me"
,Husky42,2007-12-27T11:10Z,"BE AWARE:

What 4X-AXG does is like Fairlight stealing something from Razor or Deviance.

This would not happen within groups, it is about competition. All 4X-AXG has managed to do was alienate himself as a non team player and thief.

This would not have been accepted years ago. A child to the game 4X-AXG will continue to steal. But be aware, he has never released a file that was not released elsewhere first.

He has never purchased and sold, or donated to help a cause. He is the lowest of the lowest when it comes to file sharers and in no way deserves any form of respect. He does not even know how to give appropriate credit.

4X-AXG you are nothing more then a pathetic fucking thief."
