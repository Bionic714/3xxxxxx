,ufcaza,2008-10-21T18:26Z,Bear grylls kicks ray mears ass! but ray is still good :D
,plizken,2008-10-26T05:50Z,"Ok.  ill seed for a while again.  

ufcaza> Bear Grylls is dangerous.  He is no survival expert at all.  Following he´s instructions in a real ordeal would be suicide.  "
,donkeydude,2008-11-12T12:40Z,"One of the best torrents on TPB

And plizken, you are so right. Grylls is a mere entertainer and only a fool follows his advice.

Ray on the other hand is sincere and professional. 

The seeders for this torrent keeps increasing, good job."
,plizken,2008-11-13T16:16Z,"its almost a year since i uploded this torrent and still over 100 people downloading.  Nice. 
"
,solidpope,2009-01-10T21:37Z,seed please
,noekie,2009-02-01T01:09Z,"Ow please can you seed please please,im stuck on 98,9 % Thank you :) X"
,Berenz,2009-03-05T10:05Z,"Seeders: 31 + Leechers: 127 = wasters!

Bear Grylls' show is designed to be more entertaining and he is an expert survivalist, but if you followed his advice you'd be dead most time. Have you noticed that he doesn't get anywhere near enough water? And the show is getting more and more like Fear Factor with a lot of unnecessary killing of wildlife just for the gore factor.

Ray is a legend and also an expert. Less showboaty than Bear, but far more informative."
,Yoggie,2009-03-28T19:12Z,A lot of good stuff on this torrent.  Some I want and others I am not interested in.  But none the less a useful torrent to get.
,littleohah,2009-03-29T04:47Z,SEED PLEASE
,Yoggie,2009-04-03T00:48Z,"Excellent quality but the book is very much incomplete.  May as well buy it for the rest of what the book has to offer.

Apart from that it is a excellent torrent and the videos are wonderful to watch."
,Muckers,2009-06-16T00:33Z,"The thing with Bear Grylls is that he knows what he's doing (my god does he know what he's doing), but so little is actually imparted to the audience. He's ranted about this in various forums, how he tried (in the early days) to actually give helpful advice, but it was largely edited out to make it more entertaining. Now it's just a show about a dude in a weird place.

Bear grylls is what would happen if some scientist took Steve Irwin and Ray Mears and mixed them up in a test tube."
,svadilfari,2009-06-23T22:26Z,good stuff thanks for the upload duuuude
,shotgunjesus,2009-07-15T01:07Z,i can't seem to play ANY of these files. i have no idea why. what codec should i be using? i have the newest k-lite pac(jul 14/09) and that doesn't work. someone please help me!!!!
,perkele76,2009-07-18T10:27Z,"i donno whats up with these files but if i open em while downloading,and start to watch some parts that are almost ready,it plays fine BUT hey...theres some XXX material between films too :). Atleast in my pc it shows some porn in middle of rays lessons...or then,my computer is goin insane."
,perkele76,2009-07-19T12:30Z,"!

folder 2,in extreme survival,is ""jungle survival"" named film,its corrupted somehow i think."
,Niffo2,2009-08-04T22:40Z,nothin like watching mears with a few beers
,plizken,2009-08-14T02:30Z,"perkele76 >  You may have some virus or something because there is no XXX material in this torrent.  ;)

And about the codec, Try VLC-player. "
,tk76,2010-01-22T09:16Z,please seed!!! ive been downloading for 4 days and now stuck on 67% :(
,ptv83,2010-01-25T19:01Z,"awesome upload, please seed for everyone else. if this downloads 100% for me i will seed for 100 years"

cheers"
,Punkristo,2010-04-27T21:18Z,Wow this is a great torrent!
,stewox,2010-06-30T15:50Z,"THANKS FOR THIS TORRENT , YEAH!!!

I agree , Bear is a phony , fake and just for entertainment and drama , they faked a bear (animal) attack with a costume. 

Ray Mears is an real expert, he has his own life job at his Woodlore and his site on www.raymears.com , he sells a lot of stuff for exploration , master guides and training / exploration services , and that's genuine.

Ray mears said , that he saw Bear Gryls with his show, but he described him as ""boy scout"" , look at wikipedia. "
,PathOfWar,2010-07-12T07:28Z,"If you really want to know who the better survivor is, imagine which one would saw their leg off with a pocket knife in order to survive.nnRay has a wealth of knowledge but so does Bear. The difference between Bear and Ray is that Bear has an impressive resume that goes on for a mile.nnUntil they both agree to a \""Survive-Off\"" we can only go by their accomplishments, which leaves Bear as the indisputable victor."
,parkcentral,2010-11-13T15:48Z,"Why do so many of you guys want to compare Ray Mears to Bear Grylls? This is a non-sense comparison.
Ray Mears' shows are generally about purposeful and prepared travel into the wild for sustained survival.
Bear Grylls simulates accidental stay in an extreme environment with the intention of getting back to civilization ASAP."
,xylolz,2011-04-10T23:10Z,thanks
,zengjansen,2011-04-18T01:28Z,ray RULES
,Lugubrizione,2011-05-21T13:01Z,"Thank you for a nice upload!

One thing, tho - there seems to be 2 versions of Extreme Survival Season 1-3. Why is that and which one do you recommend?
"
,Sgugzi,2011-07-17T18:59Z,"Thank´s!
