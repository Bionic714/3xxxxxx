,Hobbes73,2009-11-24T21:04Z,"This is italian and english with both subtitles in italian and english (as mentioned in the description).  No spanish. Unfortunately  It doesn't feature the commentary track I was looking for.  Can anyone point where can I find that?

ISO is working OK,although VLC crashes on Mac opening the VIDEO_TS folder.  On iDVD is fine   ."
