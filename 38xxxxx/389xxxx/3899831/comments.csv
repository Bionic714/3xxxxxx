,Bruce_Wayne,2007-11-20T04:30Z,"I'm sorry to ask, but I'm new here. DVD RLS Date means release date? So this one is not the real DVD of the movie?"
,sk8flawzz,2007-11-20T04:49Z,"hey bruce, alot of times people/groups get a retail DVD before its released, so this could be the real dvd, i.e. pirates 3 and harry potter are both available but havnt been released"
,DeLaGoya,2007-11-20T13:46Z,Finally! Thanks for the upload(hoping that it works)!

,gsxr1000mbw,2007-11-21T23:50Z,"Don't know why you didn't make this an ISO or compress it in some way. Anyway, after DL'ing this for 2 days I have all the files, only things i can get to run are the menu which is unresposive (of course), and VTS_01_1 which works for 6 seconds."
,Tripp9,2007-11-23T18:05Z,"I cannot get the torrents to download.  It says that a certain port is being used (how do I change that).  Secondly, I have Comcast cable internet and Vista slowing me down (how do I change that).

Thanks"
,voyeurman,2007-11-24T13:15Z,Is this really working properly???
,ivc105,2007-11-25T00:13Z,Thanks
,johnnymoe88,2007-11-28T16:34Z,"To get this to work, download DVDshrink at: http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_software/dvd_rippers/dvd_shrink.cfm

open the program, hit open files, and find your superbad folder, select it without opening the file, and hit ok. This will pack all of the files together in an ISO which you can then either burn to a blank dvd to watch in your player, or you can mount the image in alcohol 120, and watch it on your pc.

Great copy; real DVD. Thanks for the upload!!!"
