,mrsandwitch,2007-11-19T11:36Z,how to put this on dvd????
,Kowalski1977,2007-11-20T18:37Z,"^ I normally back up all my games on two dvds in multiple rar format though you need to put all the rars back into the same folder on your HD for extraction if you need to access the iso again to install or what not, as for this game I'll think I'll pass until someone releases a good rip of it 10GB is way too much for a game that seems to be getting crap reviews although I can't say I'm not interested in it just another one to throw into my fps archive so please somenody get a rip copy up quick"
