A change of scene, with no regrets,
A chance to watch, admire the distance,
Still occupied, though you forget.
Different colours, different shades,
Over each mistakes were made.
I took the blame.
Directionless so plain to see,
A loaded gun wont set you free.
So you say

plz seed..."

,https,2007-11-29T00:30Z,"There seems to be a lot of interest in this dvdr and an inverse amount of seeding. Does anyone have anything more than 12% ?

By the apparent eveidence, this could well be activity related to the harvesting of IP addresses for marketing purposes and the tracking of torrents by all the wrong people.

Never more than one seed ?

""A DVD release hasn't been set, however amazon's online store claims the scheduled release date to be 18th February 2008""

Which, logically, may well mean that it's hotvette123 who is the fanny.

Admin opinions ?"
