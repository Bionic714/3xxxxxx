,tenshu,2007-11-18T13:21Z,"Hopthis is real

i could easyly know it i was there at Paris concert

i'll post back later

If you can't wait there's a bootleg of this live (minus the encore)
http://fubiz.free.fr/daft-bercy.mp3"
,tenshu,2007-11-18T14:11Z,"sounds legit Technologic contains the ""fuck fuck fuck .."" sample you could only find in the encore 2007 tour
But mixing seems sligthly different from the bootleg i had linked in my previouspost

Moreover  there is no encore

Wait for something real ..."
,tenshu,2007-11-18T14:12Z,i mean Alive 2007 tour and not encore 2007 tour
,DemonWizard,2007-11-18T14:22Z,"Sounds like the bootleg of Bercy, not the album."
,team_sleep,2007-11-18T15:43Z,The reviews for this album have said the crowd recording is high. So i dunno.....
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-18T17:33Z,"you guys are idiots for saying theres no encore blah blah..i POSTED THE ENCORE 2 DAYS AGO. retards, i even mentioned it in the info on this same page.
fuckin be grateful that this is the only real alive 2007 up right now."
,timtiti,2007-11-18T18:05Z,"I doubt that someone during the concert can record at this quality rate! This is definitely the real concert!! 

Thanksss"
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-18T18:11Z,"the only bootleg in existance that has the best quality is the live@rex club set. that was recorded straight from the mixers which results in perfect quality, and virtually no audience noise whatsoever."
,DemonWizard,2007-11-18T20:02Z,"You´re wrong. Live @ Coachella has better quality than Live @ Rex (but rex is good too). I still think this is the bootleg. And also the Encore.

But i like the suff you upload."
,DemonWizard,2007-11-18T21:00Z,The quality of this one is by far better than the Encore you posted.
,DemonWizard,2007-11-19T02:28Z,"I don´t think that this is the bootleg anymore. It´s Alive 2007.

The only thing missing is a good quality encore."
,strafe,2007-11-19T12:03Z,"I ended up purchasing this on the weekend (Has been released in Australia ?!?!), great CD.  Well worth the download, even better to own ;)."
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-19T18:48Z,demon wizard you are a fuck for releasing the split up version of MY torrent. god job being a complete cunt. i will report it.
,boaber22,2007-11-19T22:28Z,Has anyone purchased the actual CD yet? If this is the kind of quality to expect from the official daft Punk CD then I dont think Ill be getting it. Coachella recording quality is much better I think. Great to hear the encore though. 
,DemonWizard,2007-11-20T06:16Z,"I think the quality of Alive 2007 is slightly better than Coachella 2006. But thats because the Coachella bootleg was recorded straight from the mixers.

If you want to compare, download the single of Alive 2007 Harder Better Faster Stronger (radio edit). The quality is the same of this release.

If you want the ultimate sound quality, listen to the Kraftwerk live album, Minimum Maximum. Those man are good."
,PPKLP,2007-11-20T14:57Z,"I've put up a FULL RETAIL version of the Deluxe edition (2 disc). It can be found here:
