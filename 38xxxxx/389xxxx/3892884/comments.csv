,stuart38p,2007-11-22T21:43Z,Thanks
,josepfring,2007-12-10T11:07Z,Hi! can you upload another karaoke creator? cause this software does'nt  work with my pc. thanks
,lydialea73,2007-12-19T16:29Z,"OK *warning* I'm a newb...I downloaded and that went great, I got the eval copy, I went to the help pull down window to unlock, I copy'd and pasted the info in the crack but...something didn't work. what now? what did I do wrong?"
,DDRLord,2007-12-19T21:32Z,"I'd recommend not downloading this one. Apparently this serial causes the program to act all wonky, so it will crash randomly and output CDGs that don't work. I even tried installing it on a fresh window install without internet enabled (in hopes maybe it was phoning home and checking) but it still showed the same glitches."
,IsItWorthIt,2008-01-22T13:37Z,"I agree with DDLord, the program tend to always crash after about 4-5 minutes, so you have to be quick if you want to render some .cdg files. 

The output of the .cdg files is not great either, the lyrics get all messed upp with red and yellow colors making them hard to read, but other than that, it works.

But seriously folks, is this the best .cdg making program available on TPB?
If you got something better, please post."
,Kiss_Me-Bum,2008-01-22T19:32Z,yep yep....tells me theres a runtime error then closes....if anyone can get power video karaoke.....thats a good one...i've tried but too no avail :(
,josepfring,2008-01-31T08:48Z,"tell me how to up load, cause i want to share my Videoke creator, this works better  with my Pc, But i don't know how to upload, please tell me how."
,josepfring,2008-01-31T08:52Z,You can send your tuitorial letter to e-mail add. josepfring@yahoo.com
,stuart38p,2008-02-03T05:41Z,"My install falls over as well.
I've found this to be the case with all powerkaraoke programs using the serials provided by others.
I got their cd g burner working but you have to use a keygen, just using someone elses codes won't work."

,HammeringOracle,2009-03-27T10:01Z,"I'm with most here. Doesn't past the smell test. Even if it isn't nefarious, It shuts down in the middle of making the cd+g. :("

,aviris,2010-09-01T18:04Z,I only get runtime error when creating the title/artist screen. No viruses. Works fine but it does mess up a little when the lyrics change color. Overall a 'B' rating.
,pvt.punch,2010-10-27T05:40Z,"The crack in this torrent (which is just a .txt file) works with the latest version, which you can download risk free:
