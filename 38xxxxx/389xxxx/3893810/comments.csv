[V],SciFi-Sumo,2007-11-15T21:44Z,Thank you again ZLO. I am getting not available. Is anyone else? ( with uTorrent 1.7.5 )
,joem35,2007-11-16T00:29Z,"So am i. Best guess, it's a new file with only zlo in possesion of it, so until he's online, no one will be able to get it. I could be wrong, but the first day was also slow at first."
,don44y,2007-11-16T04:45Z,"Thank you.  Once I get it, I'll keep it seeded."
