This is my first attempt at uploading, so any comments would be very useful. I have a boxed set of Kieslowski's early/rare documentaries waiting to be uploaded and i'm working on how to get the subtitles from the disc into the torrent file, so any suggestions would be good. Enjoy."

Also, try AutoGK, a tool that's good for ripping DVD's to avi files *and* includes VobSub to help automate ripping the subs.
