I was hoping you'd seed these here now that Demonoid is offline.

Thank you a gazillion times for keeping us C2C fans supplied no matter what the trouble.

You are the BEST!  :D"

Was worried I would never hear your torrents again with the demise of demonoid. Guess the internet isnt so big after all."
