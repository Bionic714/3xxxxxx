This is the Criterion Collection restored print of Kenji Mizoguchi's acclaimed masterpiece of human tragedy, "Sanshô dayû" (Sansho the Bailiff), as ripped by "gx", and found by me (Honeyko) on eMule. I have corrected numerous errors in the associated English subtitle file; it should play automatically if the movie file is launched in VLC. It is recommended that subtitles be viewed in a large yellow font (customizable in VLC).

Praise for Sansho the Bailiff on IMDB:

gut-wrenching, 25 July 2007 - 10/10
Author: Ron from Upstate New York
Watching Sansho the Bailiff is an emotional, gut-wrenching experience, yet worth every second (and then some) of your involvement. As many others have commented here over the years, this film is a masterpiece.

Luminous, 23 November 2002 - 10/10
Author: allan825 from Colorado Springs
Luminous...painterly...haunting...devastating...in terms of both substance and style, a cinematic achievement of the very highest order. Like all great works of art, it is incomparable, although it would not be misleading to place it in the company of the very best of Renoir, Ford, and Kurosawa. It has the same kind of compassionate humanism, high-caliber storytelling, and effortless-seeming mastery of the medium...the same generosity.

A haunting, heartbreaking masterpiece, 24 October 1999
10/10 - Author: sansho-4 from Seattle, WA
Man's inhumanity to man is presented here with no artifice. This has long been a favorite of mine, although it's difficult to sell many others on the premise -- an honest, benevolent Governor in medieval Japan is imprisoned by the military regime, forcing his wife, son, and daughter to fend for themselves. They are soon captured, separated, and sold into slavery, but remained determined to reunite.

There's something about the medieval Japanese setting that lends itself to explorations of grandiose themes painted with a broad brush. This will break your heart, and belongs on your shelf next to "Ran"
