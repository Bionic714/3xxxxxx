This is 23, not "The Number 23".

So, this is the Deutsche movie also known as 23 nichst ist so wie est scheint.

Some classic scenes are in the movie, that show Commodore 64's and TRS-80's at Germany's Pride and Joy, a group of hackers known as:  the Chaos Computer Club.

I don't know what the mini mainframe in the movie is.  Maybe a PDP8 or 11.  Looks like a boat anchor for wayward electrons.

From the IMDB:

"The movie's plot is based on the true story of a group of young computer hackers from Hannover, Germany. In the late 1980s the orphaned Karl Koch invests his heritage in a flat and a home computer. At first he dials up to bulletin boards to discuss conspiracy theories inspired by his favorite novel, R.A. Wilson's "Illuminatus", but soon he and his friend David start breaking into government and military computers. Pepe, one of Karl's rather criminal acquaintances senses that there is money in computer cracking - he travels to east Berlin and tries to contact the KGB.

English subs are in the divx itself as a subtitle track, as well as in a separate file.  If you Sprechen the Deutsche, you don't have to watch the subtitles:  i.e. they are not hardcoded into the video stream.
