,DogNo7,2008-12-22T14:21Z,"The subtitles are somewhat offset from the film.  So...  What you have to do is use your viewer and set an offset for the subtitles to line them up with the movie.  Once this is done, they will stay sync'd for the rest of the film.

The subtitles were downloaded some time ago from Gott knows where, and no Subtitles came with the DVD as this is a German DVD intended for German audiences.

It has never been released outside of the EU.

Seed the damn movie! We're stuck at 92% :-\"
,DogNo7,2010-06-12T00:40Z,"Thanks for the link and the id on the mainframe.  Kind of interesting, if the AS400 was new when this film was filmed, and considering some of the indignities it suffers in traveling around the German countryside.
