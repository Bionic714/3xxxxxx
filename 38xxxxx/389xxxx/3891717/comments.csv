[T],mt_dew,2007-11-18T23:44Z,"The install how-t0 is located in the MSInfo - Signmaker text... open with notepad.

unZiP or unRAR, burn and install

Open Winrar find the Signlab file that you just downloaded... Highlight and select extract to... That is where you will extract cd1, cd2 folders, inside those you will find .001,.002,.003 etc.  Right click the .001 file and select open with and then choose Winrar, it will open Winrar and the you will see a .bin and .cue file and MSInfo text hit extract to and extract the image file, after all this... Open your favorite .IMG, BIN, CUE, etc. burner (ie: Nero) after you burn it.... Install from disk!  "

,payohtea,2008-03-14T14:54Z,"Regarding the font error:

first, get msjet35.dll from:

next do a search in cadlink site for:
dao35.exe and dao36.exe
download them both, install 36 first, then 35.

next, copy msjet35.dll to the signlab directory.. IE: dir where the main signlab exe resides.

that should do it! if not, uninstall signlab, fire up regedit and delete the entries for cadlink under hklm and hkcu, reinstall signlab then copy the msjet35.dll file once again to the installed dir."

,SolidSnake01,2008-06-08T21:45Z,"As previously mentioned does someone find posting clear install instructions?

So, I've downloaded the torrent and unzipped the Signlab7 folder which contains 13 other zip folders which are named SIGNMAKER part 1 to 13.

I then unzip all of those together, correct? Enter the password given in the text document to proceed.

I've now got to folders CD1 and CD2. Inside the folders are files which simply cannot be opened with programs on my computer. Do I then burn CD1 to a disc (Do I burn the folder CD1 or the contents?) and burn CD2 to a seperate disc and boot them up?

I really need this program folks so any help would be appreciated.

Cheers!"
,SolidSnake01,2008-06-08T22:10Z,"Right folks I've got to the bit where SignLab asks for a License disc or correct path? What do I do from here?

For anyone else struggling.

Do as I said above until you get to the folders CD1 and CD1. You then want to use WinRAR to unzip the 001 file. Unzip the two files from there into the CD1 folder. You then copy those files to a CD or do what I did and use PowerISO to run the .bin file.

It starts the install but then asks for the license path or file which is where I'm currently stuck now.

Any help appreciated folks!"

any help with this would be gratefull!!"
,BlowBye,2008-09-16T12:56Z,"The torrent works real well and the software is of wellknown high quality. Many thanks to mt_dew for putting it up although the way the files were structured and instructions could've been a lot of better.

Best for this kind of install is to simply put up one iso-file for each CD. So much simpler for all and same file size as the .rar file in this case.

Whatever: It can be installed in a number of ways but here's a step-by-step of the way I handled the install on a Win 2003 server machine using WinRAR and PowerISO. YMMV and all the normal disclaimers for other SW, OSs, typos, brainfarts etc. etc. but the below works 100% for me. Thanks to others who pointed out solutions to the fontmanager issue etc.:

1. Download the ""Signlab7.rar"" file
2. In WinRAR, extract the ""Signlab7.rar"" archive using the default directory setting
3. In WinRAR, open any of the .rar files in the ""Signlab7"" folder
4. Using the password ""ryan20021982"", extract the archive using the default directory setting

- You now have a directory structure under the folder ""SIGNMAKER"" containing the folders ""CD1"" and ""CD2""
5. In WinRAR, highlight the ""CD1"" folder and extract it using the default directory setting
6. In WinRAR, highlight the ""CD2"" folder and extract it using the default directory setting

- You now have two new directories with working .bin-files:
 - Folder ""s-csv7141"" containing the .bin-file for CD1
 - Folder ""s-csv7142"" containing the .bin-file for CD2
7. Burn the .bin-files with whatever software you are comfortable with.
 - PowerISO is much recommended as it mounts any .iso and .bin file to a virtual drive with no need of burning the files to a CD. If you have not tried PowerISO, please do, it'll save you tons of time and headaches.
8. Install CD1
9. CD2: Never mind the install files under ""photoscript"" on CD2, that software is already installed from CD1. The other content on CD2 are simple fonts and clipart files. Copy as you need it.

- Issues when when starting the software:
1. If ""MSVCP70.dll is missing"" pops up at program start, then go to the installed ""\CADlink\Cut Manager 2.0""-directory and copy files ""MSVCR70.DLL"" and ""MFC70.DLL"" from there to your ""\WINDOWS\system32""-directory

- To get rid of the fontmanager error:
1. Go to http://www.cadlink.com/support_train/technote.php?tn=2506 and download the files ""dao36.exe"" and ""dao35.exe""
2. Go to http://www.cadlink.com/support_train/technote.php?tn=2485 and download the file ""msjet35.dll""
3. Run ""dao36.exe"" and ""dao35.exe""
4. Copy the file ""msjet35.dll"" to the ""CADlink\Signlab7.1"" directory
5. Copy the CDLFONT.MDB from the ""CADlink\SignLab7.1\Fonts""-directory to the ""CADlink\Signlab7.1""-directory
6. In ""\CADlink\SignLab7.1"", change the FONTMGR.INI file to ""Path=C:\CADlink\SignLab7.1\CDLFONT.MDB""
7. Reboot the computer and run the program"
,BiiggDDD,2008-09-17T03:59Z,"Yeah I did that and now I get this error when I install signlab to a new pc

The procedure entry point_iob_func could not be located in the dynamic link library MSVCR70.dll.


Anyone know how to fix this problem? I reinstalled and installed signlab + added the missing two files that you said and still no luck.

Do you know anything else I could try?"
,BlowBye,2008-09-17T18:22Z,"Like I said, the above worked perfect for me and I am real happy with the software, it beats the old stuff I had by miles, so much easier to work with. The error message you get indicates that the application has found your MSVCR70.dll so it is in the right place but is corrupt or the wrong version for your OS.

Google for MSVCR70.dll and the OS you have and try to find out if there is a more recent MSVCR70.dll than version 7.0.9466.0. Someone suggested to install .NET (or upgrade it if you already have it on your computer) to get what is needed."

,wallrack,2009-09-03T09:09Z,"I never cared for Mt_Dew till now.  Thank you big time. 

It worked the first time, but I ran into non-related issues. 2nd and 3rd time.

1st did the regedit Then system restore. Then followed the steps of my first install.

Now I am a hero of a print shop. I charged them nothing for this!

I am willing to post the exact steps I took if someone will post How to reseed this. As I am now using a different PC than when I downloaded it and don't know if I should offer it as a new upload???

My last successful install went somewhat like this: I installed Singnlab71 with Enod32 running running. It detected signlab71.load.exe as a possible virus and quarantined it. I finished the install. Restored the quarantined file: Removed the anitvius form the start-up, and rebooted without Enod ; ofline.
Then I did all of the manipulation except for the fonts. 

It worked.

Then I put the 3 files from the \cut folder \into the windows\system32\ folder

This is an a approximation of the procedure.  

This is, by far, the most difficult install i have ever done.

It works.

Doing happy dace here big time!!!!!

So far, I have found that the program is fully functional, apart from not being able to print to a nornal inkjet/laser printer (it gives an error message that the security device (dongle) is missing. But I have had it connected to my plotter, and it works fine.
I wish that Signlab 5 rev12 was available in preference to this. This program is OK, but signlab 5 did all I needed without the complications. Hope this helps, and thank you to the other commenters. Id never have downoaded it without your advice."
,happydavid13,2011-05-14T15:27Z,"Just to add to my previous comment, this really does work well. When you get it up and running, cut and paste the fonts from CD2 to your HDD and then install them in Signlab. This way, the program will automatically find them on your HDD rather than looking on CD2 for them.

Also, I have now installed Parallels on my MacBook. This enables me to run XP alongside OSX, so I can install signlab on my MacBook. Runs really quickly on there...much better than on my PC laptop.

This is a really good download."

Is this something I have done wrong? I have reinstalled multiple times on different operating systems. Any help would be great!"

,Rudaye,2012-05-13T05:06Z,"Okay, I'm using windows 7 and i'm trying to install this. I've had experience before with torrents, but when I try to install this I can't. I burned all the files to a disc ( is there any specific type im supposed to use?) and regardless of what I do, they still remain .bin files or well, .001 files as what it says, How do i get rid of this? I tried installing the trial version of Sign lab 9.1 but It didn't fix anything, anyone please help."
,pullmyleg,2012-07-25T00:28Z,"Sign Lab Install (UPDATED FOR WINDOWS 7, GUARANTEED WORKING)

Download and install Signlab 9 Trial, to do this go to: http://www.cadlink.com/products/signLab/sl_trial_demo.php 
You will need to create an account before downloading. Just install the full trial and if wanted any additional features. Do not uninstall the trial ever or signlab 7 will cease to work. After installation continue with the below steps. 

1. Download the ""Signlab7.rar"" file
2. In WinRAR, extract the ""Signlab7.rar"" archive using the default directory setting
3. In WinRAR, open any of the .rar files in the ""Signlab7"" folder
4. Using the password ""ryan20021982"", extract the archive using the default directory setting

- You now have a directory structure under the folder ""SIGNMAKER"" containing the folders ""CD1"" and ""CD2""
5. In WinRAR, highlight the ""CD1"" folder and extract it using the default directory setting
6. In WinRAR, highlight the ""CD2"" folder and extract it using the default directory setting

- You now have two new directories with working .bin-files:
- Folder ""s-csv7141"" containing the .bin-file for CD1
- Folder ""s-csv7142"" containing the .bin-file for CD2
7. Burn the .bin-files with whatever software you are comfortable with.
- PowerISO is much recommended as it mounts any .iso and .bin file to a virtual drive with no need of burning the files to a CD. If you have not tried PowerISO, please do, it'll save you tons of time and headaches.
8. Install CD1
9. CD2: Never mind the install files under ""photoscript"" on CD2, that software is already installed from CD1. The other content on CD2 are simple fonts and clipart files. Copy as you need it.

- Issues when when starting the software:
1. If ""MSVCP70.dll is missing"" pops up at program start, then go to the installed ""CADlinkCut Manager 2.0""-directory and copy files ""MSVCR70.DLL"" and ""MFC70.DLL"" from there to your ""WINDOWSsystem32""-directory

- To get rid of the fontmanager error:
1. Go to http://www.cadlink.com/support_train/technote.php?tn=2506 and download the files ""dao36.exe"" and ""dao35.exe""
2. Go to http://www.cadlink.com/support_train/technote.php?tn=2485 and download the file ""msjet35.dll""
3. Run ""dao36.exe"" and ""dao35.exe""
4. Copy the file ""msjet35.dll"" to the ""CADlinkSignlab7.1"" directory
5. Copy the CDLFONT.MDB from the ""CADlinkSignLab7.1Fonts""-directory to the ""CADlinkSignlab7.1""-directory
6. In ""CADlinkSignLab7.1"", change the FONTMGR.INI file to ""Path=C:CADlinkSignLab7.1CDLFONT.MDB""
7. Reboot the computer and run the program"

,WildBlondie,2012-08-25T14:28Z,"With win7 64 SL7.1 was already installed, THEN, I downloaded and installed Version 9.1 trial and it worked ( under deep freeze, so I'll have to try it again, thawed, but it should work, ok) Pullmyleg has the answers to the rest of the errors encountered"
