,007craft,2008-01-22T10:23Z,"no its 6x08.  your a moron.  use a proper episode guide.  theres only 13 episodes in season 5 before season 6 starts.  Unfortunetly theres tons of guides out there that have it all wrong, not realizing season 6 started.  To top it off, the scene is using all the wrong guides.  It seems more people are gettings marter tho and using the proper guides now"
