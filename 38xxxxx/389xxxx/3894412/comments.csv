,savethenaugs,2009-03-22T19:34Z,"Thanks!  Works great, but not a great game."
,wingwing3,2010-08-08T08:47Z,"Thanks for the upload! It installed fine with the patch and crack that rodgman recommended. I'm a fan of the series (having played MM6-8 when they came out, and replayed them recently). These comments are to help others to consider playing it.

This one has a brand new 3D engine, so the graphics are entirely different (tolerable if you don't mind older games). You pick your full party at the start, like in 7, and there unfortunately aren't any dragons or vampires to join you like in 8 (that I know of)-- though this might make it more of a challenge. There is no alchemy skill (a bummer since I was pretty into the whole chemistry set in the previous ones). Initially you pick from either Might or Magic for your character classes, and they later on pick subclasses (including some new ones such as Assassin, Gladiator, and Lich). Each class has its own specialization skills that can't be deviated from, like in MM7 and 8 (the Paladin is an expert at Armor and Clubs, but isn't good at Bows, etc).

Initially, the interface takes some getting used to, though its not entirely incomprehensible. All keys are fully customizable, including the mouse buttons. Looking at a monster (for stats/HP) truly does require the ID monster skill now, and pressing the ""G"" button. 

I got my heiney handed to me by midget skeletons on the first island until I remembered I could rest with ""R"" (as I was out of mana and healing potions)-- so do yourself a favor and do the same! 

Lastly, if you do get a kick from these enjoyable old school RPGs, and you need another to try in the same vein, check out Wizardry 8. "
