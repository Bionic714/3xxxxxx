,fuz123,2008-07-12T05:45Z,This is a POOR torrent. IT is incomplete. I should have known better. ADVERTISEMENT for a torrent site with partial game files. THIS IS CRAP. WILL NOT WORK. I dislike being sent to get more files when you are presenting this as the torrent for the game. Very deceptive. Plus if you don't know Spanish you are screwed.
