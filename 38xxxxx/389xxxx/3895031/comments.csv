1. Keep the Osmond torrents I""m uploading ""alive"". If they go dead.. I might have to stop concentrating on putting up new ones, if I have to go ""back"" to the older ones to keep re-seeding them. 

Do your part, please. Don't download and run away, stick around..and help me..help other Osmond fans enjoy these classics from the vinyl days...

2. Please continue to buy the ""new"" Osmond stuff. I don't want any of the Osmonds ""mad"" at me for posting this old vinyl stuff for you to get free"" I think..though don't know for sure..If we buy their newer cds/dvds etc maybe there is no problem sharing the older stuff..

Thanks to everyone keeping my other Osmond torrent alive!

,osmondmania,2007-11-16T19:56Z,"Just a quick side note:

Feel free everyone to post a reference to this torrent on all the other torrent sites. I only registered here at Piratebay and this is where I""ll be posting all future torrents as well.

So, if some of you are registered at Mininova, Btmon. Torrentreactor go for it! The more people we can get sharing (uploading/downloading) the better :D"

,Fire_Woman,2007-11-16T22:57Z,"Ok, everyone that is downloading this little treat. You will find that the ""Little Jimmy"" he is singing Japanese. A little boy. WOW. I never heard the Japanese imports before today. Osmondmania, thank you. I rather enjoyed the ""Jimmy Lullaby"". I cannot wait to talk to my buddies SUPE who is from Tokyo Japan. I may share that particular one to them. You really rock. Thank you a million times for doing what you are doing here. "
