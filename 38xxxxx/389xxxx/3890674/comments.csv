,mrincubus,2007-11-17T02:37Z,Hey Douche Bag...  Thanks for nothing!  Sound cuts out soons as the jokes start!  Don't waste your time!
,eraser851,2007-11-17T07:29Z,Don't know what you're talking about. The sound works just fine. 
,headcover,2007-11-17T22:31Z,VLC says the avi file is 'broken'. Anyone got the same problem or know whats wrong? 
,Kymaira,2007-11-18T17:55Z,I'm getting audio but no video.  Any Ideas?
,gooseman21,2007-11-22T07:40Z,Funny Stuff Thanks a bunch!
,SHaDOW_PHaNTOM,2007-11-25T21:17Z,"Yeah, I downloaded this too, and when finished VLC tells me that the AVI file is ""broken"".  However, it still seemed to play alright.  The audio and video worked fine on computer, and burnt it to a CDR and watched on my DivX player.  Worked perfectly, and GREAT quality.  Thanks eraser!"
,SHaDOW_PHaNTOM,2007-11-25T21:20Z,"Kymaira, your problem of no video is most likely to be because you don't have the codec required.  Try downloading VLC Media Player, and playing it in that.  Or you can also try downloading the K-Lite Codec Pack.  Whichever you choose, you should be able to see video afterwards.  And Mrincubus, obviously you're the only one with this problem so far.  Seems as though it might be a problem with YOUR computer, so don't go calling the uploader a Douche Bag, because you don't know how to operate a computer correctly.  And Headcover, the problem with it saying that the file is broken, is fine as long as it still plays.  If it still works, what's the problem?  Mine had that message and still worked fine, so it's all good.

Thanks again Eraser!"
