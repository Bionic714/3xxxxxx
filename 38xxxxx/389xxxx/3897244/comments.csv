,Kvitild,2007-12-22T20:09Z,"You can also try downlading the ""unsolved mysteries GHOSTS"", or the ""A haunting"" series, if you havent done it already.
The Jane Goldman investigates paranormal series is also possible to find on torrent, I downloaded it from BtJunkie last week.

Can anyone please seed the Ghost huners series? I am downloading all the three seasons, but there are not many seeders, and it is going very slow... "
