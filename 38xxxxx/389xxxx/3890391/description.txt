No crack, no keygen, no tricks and trojans. This is a simple workaround.

All you need is included in package. It is not much, a text file that explains how you do it, a registry file and NOD32. Just make sure you follow the instructions by the letter and it works. Takes just a second to do.

This method should also work with the 64bit version, but I have not tested that and therefore I havent added the 64bit installation file in this package.
