,NezzoX,2007-11-14T16:24Z,"How come I see 40 seeds in my torrent program, but not a single seeder or leecher in thepiratebay?"
,meu56th,2007-11-15T02:49Z,"I don't know why PB is showing 0 seeds, I have a torrent posted on PB and it has the same thing, 0 seeds and 0 peers, but it shows lots in my torrent client... must be a bug of some kind or something, I dunno...

Thanks for the up, nice workaround too, smart stuff, top marks !!!"
,NezzoX,2007-11-15T15:26Z,"What the fuck did you do to make that happend? I have talked with a lot of people that have tried this, and you are the first one to fuck it up lillebror500!"

,Rommpan,2007-11-21T13:40Z,"Is this the full version with ""smart security"" or is it just the AV. would be nice if someone could answer that for me. Thx"
,Zwartje,2007-11-21T18:21Z,Thanks
,NezzoX,2007-11-22T00:52Z,"It is only the antivirus... but, the workaround works with the full package.. actually running it now. So.. ther you have your answer Rommpan."
,90daystogo,2007-11-24T17:42Z,Hey does anyone know for sure if this works on a 64bit xp operating system cause I just upgraded yesterday 
,NezzoX,2007-11-27T20:23Z,Well mr 90daystogo. I am sure that if you download the 64bit installer from somewhere the workaround will work just fine.
,90daystogo,2007-11-28T06:51Z,thank you sir
,kingofeverything,2007-11-28T10:03Z,"lillebror500. Do you by any chance have another av-program installed, in that case that might be the problem. uninstall the other one and you'll be good"
,bentrader,2007-11-29T10:33Z,someone seed please!
,marcusn,2007-12-16T03:20Z,"manustephen: what was the adress again??

about those crashes. my computer acting like hell, it froze, and i got a black screen, but it was because i had another av program installed."
,springymabob,2007-12-16T11:25Z,I have got this working like a charm.... People that are moaning probably forgot to Disconnect there internet lmao! I did everything it said and it worked absolutely fine.
,Killer Death,2007-12-16T20:08Z,"It works, but don't try to use the workaround with the full package (eset security suite) because it works only for the antivirus."
,shehzadali3,2007-12-24T13:05Z,"thanx a lot NezzoX, but i have a little problem. When i click on the uptade box it says that the username or password is invalid. The username and password is tha same as you gave on the text file. What should i do now?"
,knightgangsta,2007-12-24T18:12Z,i have the same problem
,The Crimsons,2007-12-26T20:31Z,"did exactly what the text file said. when i restarted and turned on my internet connection again and update it was complaining about the username and password. so i took a password & username from the www.nod321.com homepage. WORKED!

BUT the license was only valid to 08-01-26 :(

someone know what i did wrong?
"
,Killer Death,2007-12-27T16:51Z,"You did nothing wrong, it just doesn't work anymore, you must keep changing usernames and passwords untill someone makes a working crack or fix."
,SandWorm,2007-12-29T14:37Z,"Same problem-Invalid user or Password.
Did someone something bad with servers?
I did everything exactly from the ""How to do this.txt"", but when I click ""update"" error occures.
Can someone help?"
,NezzoX,2007-12-29T23:58Z,"Yeah. They kind of figured out my trick over there at ESET. Try this one...
