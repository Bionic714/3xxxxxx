,tomwatson,2007-11-15T16:51Z,"Please be patient. It's not that there's bad data, it's that I'm the only seed, and it's a HUGE file. I'm in super-seed mode (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-seeding) and I'll leave it like this at least for a few days then revert to normal seeding until the torrent is healthy. It could also be a problem on your end, since you seem to be the only one stuck. (Others are at 40-50% already)"
