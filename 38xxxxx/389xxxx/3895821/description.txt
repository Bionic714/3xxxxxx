The zipped OSInstall.mpkg file is basically hacked/bypassed


All you need to do is go to /Volumes/XXX/System/Installation/Packages

and replace the \"OSInstall.mpkg\".


** Where XXX is the name of your External HD or Image Disk of your Leopard Mac OSX 
Install Disk.

** It apply to SL DVD or Full DL DVD.


Note: For Best min performance, use min 512mb of ram / G3 mac totally not supported.
