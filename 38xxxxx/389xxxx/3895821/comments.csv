I am now installing 10.5 via a Single Layer 4,3 Gb DVD onto a Tibook G4 500Mhz.

The following works if you have an old Motorola G4 400Mhz and up. Min 500Mb RAM. 6Gb free space.

.. Whats the trick? I hear you ask..

Recepie:
1: 6,6Gb DVD Image of Leopard
2: An empty 32MB sparseimage (call it backup)
made with Leopards DiskTool.
3: Use Syncronize Pro. Select Bootable copy
4: Unselect all /System/Installation/Packages/ > printerdrivers (can be installed separatly afterwards). Don't use, Carbon Copy 3.0.1, it still has issues, maybe next version?
4: Unselect the XCode folder
5: Unselect some language packets Japanese & Chinese you donÂ´t care about.   
6: Replace the OSInstall.mpkg - this torrent has a working version for basically all G4's. Forget any G3. This step can easily be done via the Terminal.
7: Check the size of the sparseimage. It should now be less than 4,3 GB in size.
8: Burn the 4,3Gb SL-DVD-image with DiskTools, NOT Toast. 
9: Press the alt-key during startup on your old G4 Mac. Select the DVD.
10. Your DONE! 

Hint.
For a fast install / No Hazzle.. 
Reboot your old G4, press Shift. This way the DVD will WORK and Install correctly, even if in Safe-start mode. No network during install will be needed anyway. 

Naturally all this is totally outside Apples support. Don't forget to buy your original DVD-Installer. Don't Copy that Floppy!!

This is a free download and will enable install of )SX 10.5 onto unsupport machines. DUH?"
