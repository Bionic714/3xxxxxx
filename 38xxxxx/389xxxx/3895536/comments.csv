Great Movie."
,richbob,2011-02-19T22:28Z,"I'll be seeding this movie for a while, its fantastic and deserves more views. "
,EelsUp,2011-08-14T22:24Z,"Don't bother with this one. Great film, but the file will take around ten hours to download and THE FUCKING AUDIO STOPS AFTER THIRTY SECONDS. What's with that?"
,bettyw,2011-10-19T00:34Z,"Thank you thank you.
Downloaded so fast I didn't have time to take a crap before I heard the ding.
It is a VHS rip and I can't express how much I love it. Lines running through the picture and all yellow just like watching movies from this time should be watched.
Sound was flakey on my VLC but ran flawlessly on Quicktime- strange. Either way: Awesome!!!"
