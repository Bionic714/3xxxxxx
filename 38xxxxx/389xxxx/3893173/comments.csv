,Mr.x999,2007-12-30T02:38Z,"Somebody reseed this.  I'm stuck at 97.5 percent.  There is one seeder with 100% downloaded but the connection is useless.  (0.1 kb every couple of minutes for a few moments then it disappears.  

Please Reseed"
,idratherbuyit,2008-06-27T23:49Z,"Please seed!  Someone with a faster download than I have just got themselves up to 95.5% off of me, and then disappeared leaving me at 78.2%.  What a jerk!  Anyone out there have the whole thing?  Even between us we only had 95.5% anyway.  Until someone wakes up and realizes how many of us would happily buy DVDs of this show, I'd really like to be able to watch it again even if it is only a torrent...."
