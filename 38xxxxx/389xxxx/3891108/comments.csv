,johan_n76,2007-11-15T13:30Z,"And of course, there is a number of problems with running this under WinXP and other modern operating systems. 

Go get DOSBox to solve those problems. Most older DOS games run like charm.

,mordor_scum,2007-12-07T00:41Z,"Game keeps crashing..

Running on XP, even tried error safe (fucking fels채kert!) mode, but didn't do the trick.

Point is, the fucking DOSBox doesn't work..?

""This game isn't playable in DOS mode"" or some crap like that.

I mean come on, shouldn't one be able to play a crappy game from fucking 1993?

Any help here would be grately appreciated"
,blenpir,2007-12-14T13:12Z,thanks for the torrent this is a really good game i hope i can get it to work 
,loveyourdaughter,2008-01-16T11:11Z,"Despite the oldness of this game and the fact that it has to run in DosBox this is one of the best games ever made. It's a cross between civilization and heroes of might and magic, except your heroes will have far more interaction and importance.  You will also be able to cast spells and enchant unique items  for each hero.

5/5 stars "

,troimer,2010-06-16T23:18Z,Thanks man! This is indeed one of the best games I ever played. I always felt like nobody else would know it XD
,subversion,2010-11-06T05:26Z,"So I've got this running in Dosbox, but I have no sound. Any suggestions of something I'm missing?"
,faeruszorander,2011-05-31T14:42Z,"wow omfug! i finally found this game after 15 years, i played this when i was in preschool, so excellent, if this copy is great i will seed permanently :D thankyou so much"
,faeruszorander,2011-05-31T15:04Z,"aight i have this game running in dosbox, pretty easy, just place it in your primary drive, for example c:, mount that folder in dosbox by following intro tutorial, then type magic.exe to run it, but i have the same problem as above, no soundXD, i has no idea why, is it because i use usb sound? or 64bit windowz? any help would be great"
,faeruszorander,2011-06-01T10:41Z,"ok guys, if you need to know how to get sound working, i have figured out how to do it
im running windows 7 home premium, with a standard logitech usb headset, here's how i did it:
mount your drive
type install.exe, it should bring up the mom installer witha  config button, click that,
then select set sound, choose a soundblaster card, then select configure at the bottom, choose option 1. each time, then click ok, then type magic.exe once your complete, and bingo, sound works hoorah! thx again uploader"
