Dare to take a shocking look at our time. We live in a violent era 
where man's inhumanity to man abounds. Death tolls are rising and 
acts of violence are becoming increasingly frequent. As we close in 
on the year 2000, we must ask ourselves whether we can end our 
cruelty. Witness first hand the horrific acts of violence that occur 
everyday: Murders, Carjackings, Executions, Drive-By Shootings, Gang 
Violence, Mob Hits, Drug Slayings, and much more, far too gruesome to 
be mentioned. Feel the adrenaline of fear without being there. 
Witness the raw horror of Facez of Death 2000
