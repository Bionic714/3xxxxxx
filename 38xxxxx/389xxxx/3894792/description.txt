LOTR 3 Soundtrack -  The Return of The King
-------------------------------------------

This is the Soundtrack of the Movie 'The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King'.

Please note: This is not the Extended version that will come out to stores on November 20th, 2007. This package is the Official Soundtrack that came a few years ago and which I thought you might find handy.

Enjoy!

Any comments are accepted! But please don't flame me! :>


P.S. Anyone who does have the Extended version of the Music of the Return of the King - which I believe is composed of 4 Disks (and 1 DVD) please upload it here or post the links for direct download!
