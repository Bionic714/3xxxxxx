Superseeding or supersizing at McDonald's notwithstanding, thanks SO MUCH for seeding these episodes each week.  You are greatness.  I'm NOT complaining about speed, the number of seeders or how long the drive thru line at the bank can be.  Life is great!!!!

Thanks again for the time and trouble it takes to upload!!!!!"
