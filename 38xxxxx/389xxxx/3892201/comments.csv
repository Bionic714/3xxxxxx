,pinhit,2007-11-16T14:44Z,annot play dvd: file VTS_01_5.VOB bad/corrupted?  Downloaded a new version of VTS_01_5.VOB but still doesn't work. Suggestions? 
,videoot,2007-12-07T14:59Z,"I'm scared of downloading this torrent by the comment of pinhit.
Does it work??"
,joesmarth,2007-12-13T12:14Z,ignore Neros warning! works fine 4 me.
,videoot,2007-12-31T20:04Z,"It's great,but i can play it only on my computer,my burn programs don't recognice this as a dvd so i can't burn this,and i really want this on dvd.
Anyone else have the same problem or am i doing something wrong? "
,Dime81,2008-01-06T13:36Z,Spasibo za disk. Davno iskal. Uvelichte pogailusta skorost'
,guzu,2008-03-24T20:36Z,"copy VTS_01_0.IFO over VTS_01_0.BUP (to make the dvd work, mostly) and copy VTS_02_0.IFO over VTS_02_0.BUP (just to be the same, these are both broken as far as i can see) and write the dvd with nero."
,onslapa191,2008-05-25T08:37Z,Same prob for me i'm afraid... tried guzu's advice but had no joy.
[T],Goldfish_92,2008-12-01T11:58Z,"I'm downloading now... If I can't get the DVD to work then I spose I could RIP and upload just the vids separately... I'll have a look.

Nice up :)"
[T],Goldfish_92,2008-12-06T00:57Z,"Ok.. did what I said...
