,diamond-optic,2008-07-26T08:35Z,"""What is the qulity on this like? Are these TV rips or DVD rips?""

well each avi file is only 325mb so quality cant be all that great..

but this is still awesome :-D"
,wflyer,2008-08-02T23:51Z,"I don't know if these are DVD rips or not, but the quality really sucks - It's no better than the TV-rips that have been out there before. The image is really fuzzy. At these file sizes (325MB per a 45-min episode) the quality could be MUCH better as long as the source material is good. I don't recommend downloading this. At least check out the quality of a single episode yourself before downloading the whole thing."

by the way, you can download the episodes indervidually. if your using utorrent or somthing just goto file's tab and set priority to ""dont download"". so you can get the first series episodes and watch them while your downloading the next :)"
,derekc,2008-10-31T15:34Z,"Does anybody else have trouble burning these onto DVD's?

I am using Xilisoft's avito dvd.

,emcee2k,2009-03-21T22:29Z,"I think these were trimmed down some when they went into syndication. For instance, I distinctly remember a scene in ""Good Knight MacGyver"" where Sir Duncan kills the page who delivered the King's food. But in this version the scene is mentioned but not shown.

I wondered what else is missing."

,Trajan23,2012-07-17T01:07Z,"I love this show, I'm glad I could find it.  

A=10
V=10

I will say one thing though, one person mentioned that he remembers a scene from Good Knight Macgyver that wasn't in this torrent.  It turns out that that one episode in this torrent is about 45 seconds shorter that all the other episodes here, so you may want to find that episode somewhere else.  But one minor problem in this whole torrent doesn't take away from its overall awesomeness!"
,iamhelix,2012-08-20T14:00Z,"thanks for the up, this is what p2p was made for, we need to keep this kinf od stuff alive."
