,Hardlydan,2007-12-18T02:16Z,"I'm not a noob, but thanks all the same! Easy install,works fin and downloads faster than the other Fable torrents. A wonderful game that works perfectly with clear concise instructions, (unlike loads of others out there!) Will seed forever! Well done Mournfel. I will use more of your torrents, you are truly the axxo of gaming! Respect!"
,Hardlydan,2007-12-18T02:19Z,sorry about the typo! It should read fine not fin. I am a bit drunk and using a clunky old keyboard!
,Hardlydan,2007-12-18T02:29Z,"OK maybe the axxo of games is a little too far, you only have 3 games out, even axxo had to start somewhere!"
,Hardlydan,2007-12-18T02:33Z,for all those who haven't read the instructions (assuming that you just installed it in the standard directories IE. just clicked yes to everything.) install the crack in: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Fable - The Lost Chapters
,Mournfel,2007-12-20T22:21Z,"lol I was about to say I dont think I'm ready to be placed on the axxo pedistal quite yet but thank you, axxo is the bomb for movies if any of you didn't know who it  was so if you want a great quality movie check out his work , I have mad respect for that guy."

,PhoenixG,2008-01-15T18:00Z,"TO ALL WHO GOT IT WORKING THEN STOPPED:

I think your problem is that you have to have the fable file mounted in deamon whenever you want to re-play it.....i've had to do that with some games, however, i've not come across this problem with fable.

Either that or your system isn't quite up to scratch to play the game!

Anyways i just also want to say thankyou to Mournfel for this game, it works perfectly and I appreciate it! Invisable War will be next on the agenda!

Cheers buddy

p.s. message me when you get some more games done so I can check em out!
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK"
