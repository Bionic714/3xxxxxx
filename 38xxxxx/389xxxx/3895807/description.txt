I was sick of spending hours searching for game torrents, then spending additional time downloading them just to find out the files were utter crap and wouldn't work, so i decided to make my own torrents with games and files that work. I also include a noobs guid to instalation with common mistakes noob pirates make and simple instructions to get you playing like a pro pirate in no time. If the file says (By Mournfel) on the end of it you know its 100% functional. 

I also have Deuse Ex - Invisible Wars out and soon Morrowind Game of the year edition.
