I think you included the RAR file AND the single MP3s in this download?!?!?"

,Andy0000069,2007-11-17T08:02Z,Whoops must not have had my glasses on when I looked at the RAR. It's a sign of old age I'm afraid to say!
,yabber,2007-11-17T16:54Z,"Ya, there duplicates. So for anyone downloading - you probably want either the RAR file *OR* the MP3s but you don't need both.
