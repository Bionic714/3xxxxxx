This fifth film in the Prophecy series picks up the tale of the secret battles between hell, heaven and the earth caught between them. Allison (Kari Wuhrer) now possesses the Lexicon, an ancient text that can reveal when the Antichrist will appear. But renegade angels are on the hunt for the book -- and the woman who holds it. Her only hope may be one righteous cop (Jason Scott Lee), who's all that stands between Allison and the ruthless spirits.
