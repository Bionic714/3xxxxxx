I just wanted to ask how much quality of the movie have you actually reduced.
I assume that that 73,9% makes reference to the entire DVD, my question is aimed for the movie only.
Excuse me for my crappy english and my ignorance on this! haha
Thanks again and I'll be seeding for sure"

How do I watch this?"
,topgj,2008-05-06T20:26Z,"more seeders, please.. i am up at 4.25% and can't download it anymore. :S "
,GandalfUK,2008-06-19T23:34Z,"Fantastic torrent. Why can't there be more like this out there?!!

FaustSnake - Use a PC Software DVD player like Cyberlink PowerDVD, InterVideo WinDVD, etc and select ""Open DVD File on HDD"".
Select the Video_TS.ifo file and hit OK. It will then run as a normal DVD from your drive :)"
