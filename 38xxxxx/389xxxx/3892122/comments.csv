,PCycO,2007-11-14T23:11Z,"You damn son of a bitch!
The credits for this Addon go to HEXER of the great WoS!
Get lost, Bastard! Buy your stuff yourself instead of stealing!"
,kharmann,2007-11-14T23:16Z,"The great 4X-AXG has nothing... nothing... nothing... All he has is stolen...

F*** OFF 4X, damned thief!"
,4X-AXG,2007-11-14T23:21Z,"awesome, the 4X-AXG fanclub is back! :D"
,PopArt,2007-11-15T01:46Z,"Serious 4X, I thought highly of you before.

But now I see you're ruining the pirate community of FS2004 / FSX.

Some guys are already leaving, because they don't feel like buying (yes, we ACTUALLY buy them) and sharing these add-ons anymore. If this continues you won't be able to enjoy these add-ons yourself. Is that what you wan't?

Please live up to the Pirate code-of-honor: we don't steal amongst ourselves."
,Cornshark,2007-11-15T03:54Z,"Alright.. I've just got to say something here.. I don't know what Wos is (somebody here called it Wus ??), and I don't know nuthing about 4X-AXG... So it seems I'm the most objective party here to comment on this:

If I had to chose, I'd have to side with 4X-AXG.. We're all pirates here. We give, take, share & steal all the same. What the fuck is the problem?? If youre not  a fuking pirate, you shouldn't be hanging around commenting on The PIRATE Bay. Get a fucking life already! Go .. join the police department or something. If youv got nothing to post here but the tears of your sobbing, fuck off and die cuz you are no pirates .. Your a bunch of fucking wanker cry babys.

4X-aXG: You do good things charing here, and very many of us appreciate it very much. Keep on sharing! Thanks

2 all utherz: FO&D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,stiffdeadman,2007-11-15T05:27Z,no seeders.... :(
,stiffdeadman,2007-11-15T05:30Z,nevermind.  17 just appeared.
,kharmann,2007-11-15T07:46Z,"PopArt is right. 4X-AXG is doing a suicide by ruining the shareing-communtiy. 

The guys will leave an stop buying?

4X-AXG has then no more to share (wthout giving credtis) - and he will die. 

Oh, I forgot... the unbelievable FUCKWOS will by the addons, if this happens!!!

But this guy has only one thing in his bad brain:
BEER, BEER, BEER...
