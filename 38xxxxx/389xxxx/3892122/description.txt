Enjoy the latest and best in scenery design with Dortmund Airport (part of the German Airports 2). Done in superb detail by the well known German Airports team it will be one of your favorite destinations in FS2004 (and in FSX in the near future). 

Continuing in the tradition of the German Airport Series, Dortmund is featured with its latest and up to date layouts, buildings, objects, runways, taxiways, lights, and navigation aids. Just like the real life airport.

A high definition aerial photograph has been used for ground texturing making the airport and its surroundings seem absolutely realistic. The GA Team have also included the Dynamic Airport Enhancement Services Lite Edition by Oliver Pabst as was the case in earlier releases such as Hanover and Frankfurt. Numerous moving vehicles on the apron and the nearby `AutobahnÃ?Â´ create a lively atmosphere!

Even with this whole range of objects, details and features, the framerates remains excellent.
