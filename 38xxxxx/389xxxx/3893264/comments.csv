"
,iloveyodasass,2007-11-15T21:05Z,Thanks for the upload!!
,preservedforposterity,2007-11-15T21:18Z,"I don't know how to edit this to change it over to a tv show, but I will post the next ones as a tvshow and mention these first ones in the description. The reason there's not a lot of seeders is my max. upload speed is 30Kbps (my ISP says it's 256k, but damned if I know how to get that speed - I think they have applied packet shaping technology to limit bit torrent traffic). I should not have released two today, since they are only going around 15Kbps each. Henceforth, I will release one a day and it'll be done in about 7 days - you'll have them all) :-)"
,snorleif666,2007-11-26T06:14Z,"Been seeding for at least ten days.

Any idea when the next .iso are due?

thanx 4 the upload."

If I remember correctly, it was short lived."
,kinkygrandmother,2007-11-27T17:51Z,"thanks!

,kinkygrandmother,2007-11-27T18:44Z,"no sound!

,snorleif666,2007-11-27T21:39Z,"there is always no sound files in the sound ts folder.

,DONWHISPERZ,2007-11-29T02:20Z,GOOD UPLOAD. I JUST GOT IT AND AM EARGERLY AWAITING THE OTHER EPISODES. I WAS6 OR 7 WHEN THIS CAME OUT AND I STILL REMEMBER IT. PLEASE UPLOAD THE OTHERS. I AM SEEDING BOTH AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.  
,snorleif666,2007-12-05T03:04Z,"seeding   ,still going strong ."
,snorleif666,2008-01-04T20:00Z,ill stop seeding now.
,bitsteal,2008-02-03T14:13Z,"to preservedforposterity .

When your ISP says 256k they mean 256kiloBITS per second.

30Kbps = 30 kiloBYTES per second

30Kbps = 300kbps (You use x10 rather then x8 due to overhead in the transmission)

So you are getting quite a good speed"
,bloodandregret,2008-02-14T00:03Z,"This series is amazing - I finished downloading it and burned it to DVD+R media. I'm seeding it and will continue to seed it until torrents are an out-of-date technology.

PLEASE post the other episodes."
,nosferatu13m,2008-06-25T17:44Z,I loved this series when it first came out.  I been seeding 1-5.  Could you plz release some more for us??  Much appreciated. 
,idratherbuyit,2008-06-28T00:00Z,Could someone go back and seed the pilot?  I'm stuck at 78.2% and some jerk just got himself up to 95.5% off of me and then left the minute he got there.  Even between us we didn't have the whole thing....
,wikid24j,2008-08-08T11:36Z,"Yeah the audio ts file is always blank, but I burned it and still can't get sound"
