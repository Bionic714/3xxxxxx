IRIS Flight Simulation Software is proud to announce the release of the first IRIS Pro Series product range, the Raytheon Beechcraft T-6/A Texan II. The IRIS Pro Series T-6/A Texan II has been designed from the ground up based on the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Student Guide CNATRA P-872 & P873 (Rev 03-04). The two documents (approximately 400 pages each!) contain a wealth of information relating to the T-6/A Texan II, it's systems and operating procedures.
