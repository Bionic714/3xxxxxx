An exposÃ?Â© about the Rockefellers, how they leeched on the american workers, basically extorted them, just to make more money. A description of their extreme wealth, buying of a Governorship and the Vice-Presidency.


I have cut it up into A-jpgs and B-Jpgs for easy viewing on the pc. 

The first 52 are the originals.
If you want print it one-sided, your default picture viewer will do it.



If you want print it double sided, you just have to
1. open Word,  

2. drag and drop all pictures one by one into the empty document, 
   (if it doesn\'t open with an empty document, press ctrl-N)

3. Then set your printer to doubleside printing as you would normally do.

Or, you could try to get the pdf of course. ;)
