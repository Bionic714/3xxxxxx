,black02-z28,2007-12-10T05:55Z,"It is a .rar, which is compressed. Used WINRAR to extract the .iso file."

,toepiece,2007-12-14T06:25Z,oi how do u put the game on the psp?????
,RivieraDude,2007-12-14T10:18Z,"toepiece, first of all you need to have a 'hacked' psp, which is fairly easy if you take it slow, search the web for how to do it,and be careful, otherwise you'll brick it, if you already have a PSP that can use ISO's simplest way is to connect PSPcomputer by USB cable and put the ISO in the right folder.
Good Luck"
,kebabman86,2008-01-18T21:05Z,"Riverdude In got a hacked psp, but in what folder do i put the files i download and do i need ro rename them ???? please help me >< add my msn (vasterviks-kebabman@hotmail.com)"
,tallus,2008-03-05T22:18Z,"Guys, go here and download UmdGen,
It converts the iso's to .cso, the compressed files you can put directly onto your memorystick to play the games from the memorystick. 
UmdGen here: http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/194
I extracted the first .rar from this torrent to a seperate folder and then opened it in UmdGen, then saved as .cso and it worked perfectly.
Best of luck with it, I think the original uploader could have given a heads up on how to convert the files tbh. "

,FernFrond,2010-08-10T06:59Z,"Lolololol. But I've seen psp hack sites where the most asked question is "" How to turn a rar/zip file into an iso"" You need magic my friend. Magic beyond your comprehension"

,tristanfosho,2011-09-21T11:42Z,"Alright goodjob webchella, THIS WORKS 100 PERCENT IF YOUR NOT AN EGGHEAD.
I think i found out why people are having errors extracting, either ur pc is ancient or you didnt click ""Extract here"" with ur winrar, i noticed when i tried to extract it to the folder automatically it gets an error which states ""Total path and file name must not exceed 260 characters"" so it works perfectly if u click ""Extract here"" then you put the 1.14 gig file into your psp, i downloaded this in 5 minutes thnx for compressing it so nicely so we can dl fast webchella. Its a shame so many stupid people try to dl and then post random shit to ruin ur torrent"
