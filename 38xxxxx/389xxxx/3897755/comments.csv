thx for the game :-)"
,btw123,2007-12-16T09:34Z,"mmm thx4free...seems strange that we all are having problems but for you its working. What PS2 systems do you have ? NTSC or PAL ? And I of course burned it to DVD as well, using A120, what did you use to burn it ? Speed X4 ?
Give us some details man, on how you made it work!"
,k.a.r.l.andersson,2008-01-23T12:56Z,"Worked for me to. Tried to burn it to a CD-r first cuz that was what Nero recomended, but that didn't work. So I tried to burn it on a DVD and then it worked. Burned it with Nero at X16. I've got a modbo-chip (745). There's a lot of european languages in this one to, swedish for example, so it's the PAL version. I've only tried a couple of tracks but so far it works.."
