,TheKingfish,2007-12-12T16:11Z,"Actually mockidol, when setting up a new PC, the Customizer can't be beat.  Rather than search through the MRI to find the modules you need (except Windows Updates which isn't there) you check a few boxes and let it do it's thing.  And the Windows Updates feature which is not in the MRI, works wonders when in-home clients only have a dialup connection and there are 90 or so updates after an XP reinstall.  So get it straight, MRI and Customizer are for 2 different purposes and if nobody can post Customizer 3.4.0 then so be it."
