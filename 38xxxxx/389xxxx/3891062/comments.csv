,greekduder,2007-11-17T06:37Z,"Sorry for the people who are having problems with this . I grabbed it in 4 hours and seeded back 30GB in 2 days. I am still seeding, usually I seed stuff I download to around 100-150GB maybe more. 

I will tell you one thing, I have never used virtual mounters such as Poweriso or daemontools, NEVER!!! It may sound odd, but here this...
This does require for you to ""waste"" a DVD, perhaps a double layer DVD, but it has worked for me EVERYTIME! I use this software by slysoft called CloneDVD2. It has this burn setting as soon as you open the program and it is the third one from the top. It is ""burn existing ISO/UDF files"". Thats the moneymaka!! The contents that are IN the ISO file will then be burned on the DVD. You will no longer need to mount anything when you have the disc. You will insert it in your drive and install as if you have bought the DVD. When it comes to getting the crack, go to...My COMPUTER, right click on the DVD drive that you are using to install the game, click explore, and find the crack in the DVD. 

I know it sounds like arduous work, but it has never failed for me. i surely hope to have helped someone.

@akiraX
I understand how you feel. I bet you never asked for help huh? Neither did I. I spent countless hours trying to figure out how to download and install games, but I did it myself. i am simply helping for the installation of the game. Because it really isn't the users fault when the game crashes or it doesn't install properly. Preparing the .ISO image correctly can be everything.

I hope I helped at least 1 person:):):) "
,greekduder,2007-11-17T06:49Z,"one more thing,
I suppose I am helping you more than akiraX would want, bit I'll risk a typelashing. 
After you install the game, don't forget to go to the crack, like I said above. Copy the cracked .exe file, navigate to the directory where you installed the game. It should be under Program Files\EA Games(or Electronic Arts) and paste it there. Click yes to replace.
The most important part, this is where most people have the problem..
Do not place any shortcuts on the desktop when you are installing the game. if you have delete them. Send the new cracked .exe to the desktop(create shortcut via the right click menu) then double click that! 
Again, I hope I helped at least one person. 

Truthfully, if you don't have any idea what I am talking about, ask the experts who are posting comments here. What I just told you in my last two comments is rather pre-school in nature. if you don't know, then you should just save up and spend the 39.99 and buy it, or just do what I did, figure it out on your own, you will feel great.  If you can't, you just don't care!!"

,maxtreeme,2007-11-23T06:15Z,"GameMasta_21 -> You burn or mount the iso file, abd after that you copy from the crack directory the nfs.exe to the game directory. And it won't ask for the cd anymore :)
Viggu -> I dunno what kind of pc do you have, but i have an AMD64 3000+ with Radeon X1600Pro and no matter what graphics i set the game ""lags"" and my CPU is on 100% so that means that the game needs a far better CPU than mine..."
,siquo,2007-11-23T10:21Z,"GameMasta:

Since no1 else is helping you.

Search for a program called daemon tools.
Its free so you don't have to get it from any torrent sites.

Once you've installed daemon tools you can emulate cds on your computer without burning them to disk.

Right click the icon on the bottom right of your screen (once installed) and hover over VIRTUAL CD/DVD >

then select the empty drive in there, and locate the extracted file on your computer. Now install the game as normal and follow maxtreeme's instructions above.

Hope this helps"

,GameMasta_21,2007-11-24T17:08Z,"Ok for all you people who are having problems installing and running the game, here is a turtorial:

1. Once you download, open the file and you should see alot of .rar files. Double Click the first one~!

2. Once you did that, you should see a .iso file, no mounter can open the file and find the .iso file so you have to do is, right click it and choose extract this file to a specified area or something. Extract it to your Hard Drive...

3. Once extracted, right click Dameon Tools, Click on Virtual CD/DVD ROM.. Now choose the one that says Device 0, then go to Mount Image.

4. Now this should bring up a second little box, in that box choose my computer, double click your hard drive.. now find the file  ""rld-nfps"", once found. Double Click it~!

5. Now it should do a auto install from there, if nothing happens then open My Computer and double click the ""PROSTREET"" Icon. 

6. Once installed, you have to open the first .rar as before, now you see the .iso file again. Double click that file, when it's open choose a file that says ""Crack"".

7. Now that you have ""Crack"" open, press start, click my computer, double click your hard drive, click program files.. Now click Electronic Arts, once that's open click Need For Speed ProStreet.  

8. Once in there you should see a icon that says nfs, and one next to it. I forgot what that one says but  it should be directly next to it, delete both of those icons. 

9. Now go back to the ""Crack"" box and drag both of those little files into the area where you just deleted the 2 previous files.

10. Now.. Open My Computer and double click pro street and THERE YA GO~! Your up and running~!"
,GameMasta_21,2007-11-24T17:11Z,"For Step 4, it may not always be in your hard drive, I made an error because mine was in My Documents - My Downloads - Downloads... So it's where ever your torrenter saves your files is where you will find it."

,james77bone,2008-07-11T23:27Z,"   you do need a crack. First check the game version, and get the crack that matchs your game version. few things that can make crack doesnt work:
1. most cracks are very old like 2 or 3 years, and wont work with the latest OS.
2. some games require you to emulate cd images, using virtual cd porgram, like alcohol 120% or deamon tools.

,EmptyThreat,2008-09-30T01:59Z,"Heres for the people who are still having problems..(if this torrent is like any of the other torrents ive seen)

1) select all the .r## (the ones that look like a stack of books)
2) Extract them all to somewhere where you can find it.
3) You should be left with a .iso, so mount this using daemon tools (which is free)
4) go through the installer
5) Open the .nfo file with notepad or something and scroll down to find the keys, then put one in and go through the rest of the installation.
6) once its finished, go to the virtual drive that daemon tools created and right click it and select explore. the crack file should be in there.
7) Copy the crack file and paste it in the folder where you installed it. 
8) this should be it.. run the game and it should work.

good luck. you guys can correct me if you find any mistakes with this method.. it worked for me so i hope it works for you."

,hardstyler67,2009-07-12T13:59Z,"how to download Need for speed pro street crack for dummies (no fail)

this will solve everyones problems!!

STEP:

1: download the 'Need.For.Speed.Pro.Street-RELOADED' torrent (safe)

2: download with utorrent or whatever

3: once downloaded make a file in your documents to extract the NFSPS files into.

4: download PowerISO

5: extract(NOT MOUNT) with powerISO (dont worry about registering it unless you want to keep using it, if so just down the keygen for it pritty simple).

6: now double click the 'EASetup' application, but, if this fails to work open the torrent file on powerISO and right click the 'EAsetup then it will go.

7: When asked to enter the serial code just open the keygen in the crack file and away you go (if you get a probem saying it cannot find the 'nfs' (application) file just simply click ignore.

8: when installed DO NOT run nfs pro street or else it wont work, where the new nfs file is in your documents place the crack 'nfs' file into it and to be sure (because im unsure) place that same crack file into the file that you made to extract all the nfs files into and click copy and replace (for windows vista) but just make sure you replace the other one :).

NOTE: if you come accros the problem when clicking the EAgames file and it says file 'd3dx9_34' Dll file just type it in on google and download that file and extract with winrar or XAce (which is what i used).

*if you do have more problems it may be the cause of your graphics card of memory of your RAM which is something i cannot help you on :(

*I am using windows vista and runs well, and once on the game make sure if you have a standard CRT monitor change the resolution to around 1024 x 768_60herts or to what ever your monitor resolution settings are.

the games quality is real good just make sure your computer is running fast and you will have no problems"

,speded22,2009-09-20T18:03Z,"Ok so since people don't know how to give very good detailed directions I will:

1. Download this Torrent with uTorrent or some other torrent.

2. Download PowerISO (It might work with Daemon Tools as well but I havean't tried it) you don't need the full version of PowerISO to do this.

3. Open PowerISO and drag and drop the whole Need.For.Speed.Pro.Street-RELOADED folder into PowerISO.

4. Click the folder and save it wherever you want.

5. Click the folder and extract it wherever you want just make sure you know where you extracted it.

6. Open the folder from wherever you extracted it to and scroll to the bottom and open the SECOND TO LAST file the one just above the .sfv file with IZArc or Winrar. (thats the mistake I made you can't just open any one and extract it)

7. Extract the .iso file to some place other then the folder that the file was originally in. (I extracted it to my desktop)

8. Mount the .iso file with daemon tools and go through the installation like normal, after you have mounted the .iso go to my computer and right click on the drive that has the .iso mounted in it and open the folder in a new window and open the crack folder and open the second file to generate a CD key and don't close that folder just yet.

9. After the installation is finished go to the installation directory and go back to that crack folder and copy the first file and paste it into your NFS directory.

That should be it that should work, the first time you start the game a black command promt box will show up and sit there for a little bit before the game starts but it will start so.  Enjoy"

,xSany,2010-11-26T22:38Z,In what language is the game
,Smieszek,2010-12-29T09:15Z,"This is the real thing.

1) Download this torrent, and drag it into uTORRENT. Let it download! Mine took about 12 hours to download.
2) Once downloaded, go to google, type in PowerISO and download it. (You don't need the paid version, the free one will do.)
3) After you installed PowerISO, you must restart the computer for the instalation to be complete.
4) Open PowerISO, and drag the ENTIRE Need.For.Speed.Pro.Street-RELOADED folder into the program. At the top you will see ""Save"", click on that and save it to your desktop.(Name it anything)
5) Once it is down saving, make a new folder on your desktop, go back to PowerISO, click EXTRACT and extract it into that new folder you just created.
6) When it is down extracting, go into that folder you extracted everything into and scroll al the way down and go into the second from last folder called rld.nfps.rar.(The one above to .SFV folder)
7) You will need WINRAR to extract the files in this folder. If you don't have WINRAR download it free! All right, so now just extract the file out of this folder onto your desktop.
8) Once you have the file extracted to your desktop, go back to PowerISO, at the top you will see Mount, click on that and click the first option, MOUNT ISO TO: or something like that. Once you select that option, find the file you extracted to your desktop a second ago. 
9) When the mounting is complete, go to My Computer and select the drive the game is mounted to. Open it and follow through with the installation. When you are asked for the CD Key, go back to My Computer, right click on the drive you have mounted too, click OPEN, then click on the Crack folder. In there you will find two files, click on the second one and click Generate. There's your key.
10) When the installation is complete, go back to the crack folder, and copy the FIRST file into your NFS:PS directory. Game should now work! :)

2) After download, look into the folder where you downloaded it from, there are different files, r00,r01. these are just parts of a single archive, and to extract it, you must scroll down to the bottom of the folder and open the .RAR file with WinRAR
2) In WinRAR extract it to a folder. Go into the folder and you will find a single ISO
3) Download PowerISO, you don't really need a registration code for it, MOUNTING is free.
4) Install PowerISO and open it. Click on the MOUNT button and on the drop-down box after Set Drives, select 1.
5) Click on MOUNT button again and Mount Image to Drive [(letter of drive)]
6) Browse into the folder you extracted the ISO and select it
7) The setup will Autorun, if not, the go to the ""Computer"" folder and go into the drive with letter from PowerISO and double-click on Autorun.exe
8) Go through the setup and when it asks for serial key, go into the drive again and go to the Crack folder and double-click the key generator.
9) Put in one of the codes onto the setup and continue installing
10) After installing go to the Crack folder again and copy the crack (EXE file) to the folder where you installed the game and replace it with the original (EXE) file. Make a backup of the original (EXE) if needed)
11) PLAY THE GAME!!! :D"

Torrents contain the most useless info, and they just seem to ignore the most important ones.

,teamphh,2012-04-04T05:19Z,"you need to download daemon tools lite. google it,and download. it creates a virtual dvd drive ,so it can open the need for speed ISO file, thinking its a dvd in your disc drive. once you installed daemon tools ""LITE"" the free version. then go to where you downloaded the pro street ISO. and open it. daemon tools should kick in and open it like if it was a dvd placed in your dvd drive. anything i missed  please anyone is welcome. i know i may not have been as clean explaining. but im about to go to sleep after day of work. bye"
