,omni,2007-11-19T23:50Z,Thanx!
,LmpshYy,2007-11-23T19:33Z,Thank you:)
,_Wintermute_,2007-11-23T21:40Z,Excellent! Finally some quality! The best music video torrent ever ;-)
,firingseeds,2007-11-26T11:13Z,"Yep, cool. Neat quality. Go Demonoid! ( Wish they hurry up and get back online ).

Have you got U2, Where the Streets Have No Name, done on top of the Liquor store, 1987'?"
[T],DaRkFib3r,2007-11-27T02:39Z,"Will keep an eye out for that video, if it comes up i'll post it up."
,dracuger,2007-12-02T08:59Z,"hey DaRkFib3r, nice seeing ur still around after the demonoid shutdown,  i used to download your videos weekly as u would up load them, hope u keep it up here:)

Just wanted to say i really love your work, and really appreciate it:)

Thanx alot cheers! "
,Kosinus1,2007-12-03T22:53Z,"I have a few questions.

Why not posting source videos? Are the files too big? Because the quality must be amazing.

Have you considered using H.264 (aka MPEG-4 AVC) instead of DivX? In my opinion H.264 is way better (I haven't seen your DivX's yet but still).

Are source files MPEG-2 or H.264?

Thanks in advance for your answers. :)"
[T],DaRkFib3r,2007-12-06T23:44Z,"They are captured as Transport Stream (.tp) format from my Dvico Software/Hardware. 

Breaking the file down with a program called Gspot, it states it as a ""MPEG-2 Transport Stream""

The Quality really comes down to the source material, as this is captured from FTA (FreeToAir) HDTV its not as good as some cable providers in the USA or other countries.

I'd most of the video are of a 720p format, so i scale them down a bit to keep the quality good and try and cut the file size down. 

In General the file sizes that i capture with equate to about 100Mb per 1 minute of video, so the video size is usually 300-400Mb per video.

""Have you considered using H.264 (aka MPEG-4 AVC) instead of DivX?""

Yes but i've yet to find a program that is free/pirated that can do the job for me, i just havent had that much time to look around.

Dr Divx if free but it a bit slow with new releases as DivX gets updated, when i have time to search around for something of similar caliber i'll switch."
,Kosinus1,2007-12-07T01:11Z,"Thanks again. My curiosity is now satisfied.

For H.264 compression I recommend MeGUI with x264 encoder, it does the job very well and they're both free."
,agonic,2007-12-22T21:15Z,"Hi.

Thanks for the great torrent. 
If I may suggest, if you step away from the windows realm there's several options to codec using h.264 in linux like ffmpeg and mencoder."
,GareyP,2007-12-30T02:17Z,"with so very many people using windows why would you want to step away from windows.  Divx is very popular, I have a dvd player that will play divx. It will also play avi, or divx files from a removable 500 gig hard drive. Divx is widely used, You can download a free player for the computer. My dvd will also play jpg files and mpg files, but I do not know about newer video formats. Thats my two cents worth"

,rangerrick997,2008-04-16T06:16Z,"I noticed that demonoid is back in action.  I was wondering if anyone here would have an invite available.  I'll still be a huge fan of the bay for sure, but it's nice to have options.  Cheers"
,TD912,2008-04-19T06:39Z,"Meh. Looks like MediaSentry is starting to disrupt this torrent... :(

Time to start up PeerGuardian...

Keep up the nice music video releases, DaRkFib3r. the ones from that SkidVid guy are horrible quality..."
,gav113,2008-07-05T20:26Z,"Fantastic, appreciated, keep it up"
,MeesterDaveed,2008-07-14T12:41Z,"holy shit dude...normally huge packs of videos include shitty quality, boring/stupid videos, doubles of videos, videos ripped from tv, off sync video/audio etc.

are you trying to break the mold? because if you are, my friend you succeeded! this is the exact opposite of all the problems with most music video packs...the quality is not only good, it's literally HD, everything is in sync, it's NOT fucking ripped off of tv...

basically what i'm trying to say is that this collection of videos is a good collection because the videos all vary in style and type and music, the quality is off the charts, and there ARE seeders!

thanks for the effort DaRkFib3r, you are officially, the shit"
,al-Khowarizmi,2008-07-20T18:56Z,"Thanks! You're the man!
This is fucking good!"

[T],towerelect,2010-04-06T22:25Z,MPEG4 sucks unless you like viewing stuff on a MOBILE PHONE.   A tribute to myself the original uploader on demonoid where you can STILL download the far better originals would of been nice too.   towerelect AKA Rigmar Radio sigh...  this makes me sad.
,larlarbd,2010-05-08T07:53Z,"Darkfib3r , You are absolutely right - quality music videos are a hard find , your work is much appreciated man , right now I have a cap on my connection - I'll seed as much as I can but I'm getting a good connetion soon , I'll seed your torrents as long as it takes ... thanks man ( YOU ARE THE BIG BOSS IN QUALITY )."
