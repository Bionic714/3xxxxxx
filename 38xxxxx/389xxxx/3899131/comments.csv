Que bueno que subiste esta version.  

La versión Ultra esta llena de programas que en realidad no sirven para el pirata común!"
,omgwtfpiratebay,2007-11-29T19:14Z,"This is an awesome upload!

For those wondering it comes with a working KeyGen & is virus free.

The micro build is the best!"

,Skanekillen,2007-12-27T10:50Z,"I love this version of Nero. Someone who knows if it works with the software from lightscribe?

,Skanekillen,2007-12-27T12:42Z,I tested to download lightscribe and nero 8 micro. It dosen´t work. Too bad.
,zomgkittylazerz,2007-12-30T04:09Z,It doesn't support .avi or .mpg files. You'll need to download Nero Vision for that (which comes with Nero 8). So you pirates can't burn the movies you download here to a DVD using this.
