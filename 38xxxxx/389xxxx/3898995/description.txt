Airports
========

Flight Simulator 2004 does not include RJGG and VTBS by default, but these airports are used in skAI Traffic v2.3.

RJGG --> I recommend installing the RJGG scenery from http://www.bekkoame.ne.jp/i/m28hama/rjgg.htm.

VTBS --> I recommend installing the VTBS2006 scenery from http://www.siamavsim.com and using Eric Thornton's AFCAD, which can be found on Avsim under the filename af2_vtbs.zip.

If the VTBS2006 scenery is bleeding (grass coming through the runways), use this flatten switch in your scenery.cfg:

Flatten.0=5.0,N13 39.15,E100 45.32,N13 39.55,E100 43.65,N13 42.90,E100 44.76,N13 42.54,E100 46.30

It should look something like this:

[Area.047]
Title=vtbs2006
Local=Addon Scenery\vtbs2006
Remote=
Active=TRUE
Required=FALSE
Layer=47
Flatten.0=5.0,N13 39.15,E100 45.32,N13 39.55,E100 43.65,N13 42.90,E100 44.76,N13 42.54,E100 46.30

It was impossible to include these sceneries in the installer, as I don't know what is installed by whom.
To prevent scenery conflicts I leave this decision up to you.
