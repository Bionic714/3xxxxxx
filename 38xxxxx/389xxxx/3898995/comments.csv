Do you need version 1 to install this one?"
,ATRpilot,2007-11-19T23:06Z,"No need for any other version. This is a standalone. If you have any other version installed, delete it before putting this one."

,Jo Mama,2008-06-13T11:28Z,"Not a good representation of planes at Australian airports, but I've fixed that by using the VOZ AI pack. Perfect now :) I've been using MyTraffic, and just came across this package. skAI is definately streets ahead of MyTraffic, especially for the aircraft models, they're stunning. A little more taxing on the framerate I reckon, but definately worth it."
,snakey-111,2008-08-02T16:49Z,"BEST AI PACKAGE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Definately MILES ahead of any other!!!! But has version 2.5/3.0 due for April 08 been released yet?"

THANKS FOR THE GREAT SEEDING GUYS!!"
,chinopr,2008-08-23T06:22Z,"BTW, 

It took me about an hour to download, so if you guys have problems downloading, its maybe cause your ISP have blocked the ports, or maybe filters the speeds, I suggest that you guys use utorrent. It has a encryption option that makes you ""stealthy"" when torrenting, so your ISP ""dont"" see your habits."
,even_92_norway,2008-09-13T12:02Z,"Thanks for this :)

For all of you using Vista and can't find the correct Temp-folder:
Simply go on the Start menu, write %Temp% and press enter. 

Good luck :)"

Thanks ATR for this post!"

,blandino123,2009-07-01T08:57Z,"@ everybody 
Thanks For Seeding Guys! Downloaded this thing in 20 minutes with you guys help!
@a380person
even if this is suppost to install it automatically you have to manually set how much ai traffic there is. go to your settings and hit traffic, put it up to 100% and watch ur airports fill up!
@everybody
this is the BEST ai traffic program out there.i install fligth1 ultimate traffic,,stupid shit didnt even fill up my airports half way!
@everybody
the 5gb thing is over exaggerating because this doesnt take more then 2gb -_-
@everybody 
ill be seeding for a while to let other enjoy from this great thing :D
@everybody
ive done extensive internet research to find that 3.0 might not come at all. 1.0 and 2.5 where both released by diferent authors which means that ATRpilot just took what the other guy had done and made it alot better :D but i think ATR got bored of Skai and just stopped bothering -_-. "
,dderosa1,2009-07-21T19:59Z,Does this work for FSX? I installed it and none of the traffic is showing up. My traffic settings are high. Where is skAI Traffic supossed to be installed? It installed it in Program Files>Microsoft Games>Microsoft Flight Simulator X>Sim Objects>Airplanes. Is that where it is suposed to go? Someone PLEASE respond!! 
,GCoach,2009-07-30T20:45Z,Nice torrent downloading at 350kb's per second
,GCoach,2009-07-30T21:20Z,dderosa1 I think u just install it in the main directory for FSX
,GCoach,2009-07-30T21:21Z,And then just move everything into the correct files
,tonicfan,2009-08-20T00:22Z,"Why are some of the call signs missing?
I have almost every call sign in the world on my FS and SKAI doesnt pick up everyone.  One I know for sure is US Airways Express it was in front of me before take off and ATC said ""4678"" and no US Air or any other airline named in front of the flight number.  Anyone else have that problem?  And is there a solution?"
,malakas3009,2009-12-28T21:49Z,"thnx :) seedin'
can u upload skAI Traffic v2.5 / 3.0
or higher thnx."
,RID2,2010-01-21T16:51Z,"I've had this installed for over a year now and is fantastic! The only thing wrong is that some planes lighting are off. Like the strobe lights are on the same circuit as the nav lights, so they constantly blink when taxing...which isn't real. lol Simple fix in the aircraft.cfg file though. Not too many do this, but you may find it one day. 

Which brings me to another point. I've discovered new airlines I've never heard of before thanks to this. lol. Even read a little info. on airlines like Sun County and ABX due to my curiosity. Interesting stuff! "

This is another small error I've discovered.  The reason is due to the missing info. in the Aircraft.cfg file located in the folder for that specific aircraft. Finding that folder is kinda hard for newbies.  If you know the aircraft is an airbus A320, then the folder would be skAI_A320_EVAI. Inside look for aircraft.cfg | open with notepad and press CTL F to find the text relating to that airline, like  US Airways Express.  When you find its entry in the .cfg file look for, ""atc_airline="" This is where US Airways Express needs to be. It will look like this: atc_airline=US Airways Express 

Now you need to Google for a program called editvoicepack. Read about it and you should have the callsign. "
