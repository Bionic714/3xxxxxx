then start steampatcher.exe in pacsteamT map ,, 
then start steam.exe .. then it uppdates ,, if that dont work  .. uninstall .. install again .. start steam   , then it updates ,, then log in .. u have no games i know .. then u close down pacsteam and start the online patch then steampatcher.exe.. after that log in .. and it works .."
,Pitbull_Raven,2007-11-25T13:09Z,When I run steam in the login account name box it says: Close this box now and run the cracked patch. What cracked patch?
,Jontey,2007-11-25T15:00Z,there are no cracked patch .. start the pacsteamT in desktop map .. the shortcut .. or steam.exe iin lokaldisk-pacsteamT then steam.exe then it works
,koen11,2007-11-25T15:32Z,"Hi Jontey, I left the problem for what it was, download another program, all steam files or some, it worked, but, now I got the error: Steam main exception unable to load SteamUI.dll

,Pitbull_Raven,2007-11-25T16:25Z,"I kept getting the message that the servers were too busy to process my request whenever i tried to install any game from the list. So i finally gave up and installed a real steam and downloaded a paid version of the game. It started to dload immediately. I went back and tried again via pac. Same thing: servers to busy. Back to the paid version: worked perfect again. So basically, I think they may be on to this and I think it might not work now."
,Jontey,2007-11-25T21:07Z,"koen11:
okey .. so it isnt pacsteam ? 
then i dont know how that program works .."
,lukie99,2007-11-27T00:47Z,"Ok, I got this whenever I tried to download anything

,TheOnlyPilot,2007-11-29T00:10Z,"Well, I thought it was working - for a bit. I managed to get Half Life 2, which was pretty much the only reason I wanted this (that and the HL2 Episodes). Unfortunately, after beating the first level, I could not continue the game into the next level, but had to skip to chapter 6. That's when I realized it was only the demo, even though it took over 4GB on my HD and said it was the full version. 

Ontop of that, the only other games I could download were the lame ones like Zuma Deluxe and Hexen, those retarded things.

I got every error listed here though - could not autoupdate, tried to start with cracked and non-cracked - could not find the SteamUI.dll, when I rarely did manage to get Steam running, it would give me the ""server too busy"" message.

So, definitely a 'not working' for me. Running Vista 64 bit (Steam/HL and some other games run fine on my normal bought Steam account).

Oh well. Any ideas? (Tried everything in the info you uploaded...)

Great upload by the way, those help documents helped me get as far as I could, unfortunately they aren't helping me get any farther but its better than nothing. Thanks! Will be seeding..."
,Jontey,2007-11-30T15:32Z,"TheOnlyPilot:
hmm ,. that with the busy message everybody have it less or more , i dont know anything that can fix that , i think pacman will fix a better version , and less busy message , hmm i also play half life 2 on my pacsteam , but my game is full , without skip chapters .. try to reinstall it :) and see if it works .. it should work right now for you becuse it takes place on the hdd ..

I installed using the pacsteam icon in torrent folder. when asked to confirm extract, I clicked ""yes"" and ""yes to all"" which I believe prevents the ""error cannot load SteamUI.dll"".  I then started Pacsteam through all programs. after it updated itself I created an account. I then logged out in taskbar and ran the online patch in patches folder. then I started steampatcher.exe.  after this I started pacsteam again through all programs. in the name box it said close this window and run cracked patch which caused me much confusion and hours of work but I finally just wrote my username and password and bam!! it started up with full games list!!  Thanks Jontey! your reply to lordgg is what helped me figure this out.   if problems still arise, uninstall and reinstall following jonteys instructions to lordGG to the letter!!   Worked for me!!"

What do you expect?
I mean my god.....do you think the Steam makers are freaking mentally retarded and dont notice this crap going on???
HELLOOOO!!! they HIRE professional hackers to constantly hack into their systems to find holes and glitches in the program....just like...oh i dont know....EVERYONE DOES!....
So don't expect shit to work every time....
The first few games from them for free its pretty much dumb luck....then the server notices your playing their games from THEIR program without paying for it and locks your IP out of the server...
After that....you'd pretty much be lucky enough to get updates.....
