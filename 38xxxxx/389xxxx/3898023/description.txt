Milk is toxic to humans, yet big business and nefarious governments lie to us by claiming it is a good and natural food that is important for our sustained good health.

Well, the reality is that drinking milk greatly increases the chances of developing serious disease, such as Alzheimer's syndrome, osteoporosis, and various cancers.

If you want to improve your health, end unnecessary cruelty to animals, and minimize your impact on the environment, then you need to stop using animal milk.

Good alternatives include; rice milk, oat milk, hemp milk, almond milk, hazel nut milk, and so on. These plant milks are readily available from health food stores and supermarkets. They are also easy to make at home using an inexpensive kitchen device (that does the complete job) or simply by soaking (optional) the nuts (or seeds, or beans), grinding them up, adding water, and filtering out the bulk/pulp.

Milk is for babies (of the same species).
