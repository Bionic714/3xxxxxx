Another Rave From The Grave and Boom From The E-Tomb.Sandra Bullock and Telnet. Had some problems ripping this one and it shows! However still of very watchable quality.
You will probably need to use K-lite codecs pack (http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm) and Media Player Classic. Can't get it to play right in VLC. Remember please I ain't no Axxo, just some guy with a steam powered T21 so please comment and tell me how to do better in future!
