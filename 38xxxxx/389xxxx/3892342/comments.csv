I joined it a couple of months ago, though due to some server issues at their end, have uploaded just 4 vids so far...
My profile is at:

So, you guys can request me for hollywood old classics etc there, and I would try to find and upload.

Best.

PS: I hope I am not offending you Filmofiel. I'm not advertising something here. TPB is great as ever. I just feel it's an alternate resource for getting vids free with instant free downloads and will be useful for the community."
