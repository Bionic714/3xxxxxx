Hey, I'm still looking for a reseed of the week 5 Bucs @ Colts game.  Stuck at 89.3%  Can anybody help out?  Here's the torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3865006/TB_vs_IND_Week5-A_1012YI75620FM"
,nutmeg7,2007-11-18T07:52Z,"P.S. If I get it all, I'll reseed it for anybody else who wants it.  Check out my reseed thread on TenYardTorrents"
