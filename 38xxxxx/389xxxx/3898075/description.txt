Eliades Ochoa - Tributo al Cuarteto Patria (2000)

One of the most talented members of the Buena Vista Social Club project, Eliades Ochoa was slower to gain wider recognition outside of Cuba after the project than Ibrahim Ferrer or Ruben Gonzalez, which is a shame because while his campesino style may not be as polished as some of the more urban traditions of his contemporaries, his guitar playing is infused with fire and passion that make his music a sheer delight to listen to. This album, which possesses superior songwriting to his previous solo release Sublime Illusion, pays tribute to the band that Ochoa has played with for years, as well as to the musical traditions, the Cuban landscapes, and the clubs that helped nurture his love for song. Ochoa displays a passionate voice which is a good partner for his expert guitar playing, and overall this is a nearly flawless portrait of great Cuban music. ~ Stacia Proefrock, All Music Guide
