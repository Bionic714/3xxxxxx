every year i compile a handful of christmas songs because i get sick and tired of listening to the same random holiday crap every year. included in this colletion are original and covered songs by artists like Death Cab For Cutie, Dismemberment Plan, The Matches, Bright Eyes, Run DMC, the pAper chAse, Gatsby's American Dream, Smashing Pumpkins, My Chemical Romance, and more.

i also included a 4-song EP by my acoustic project, because i'm shameless. enjoy.
