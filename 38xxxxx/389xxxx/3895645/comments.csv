Go suicide yourself. We will all celebrate. Or better yet, say ""the holocaust is a fraud"" in Germany. Good luck in jail with Big Bubba!!!

Anyway, great upload, Gohf8iev. Thanks!!"
,UnrealDemon2,2008-05-29T17:58Z,"I believe the so-called frauds are holocausts, but I don't go around sharing my opinion if one does not mention it.

Still, awesome upload. I hope it's in high quality."

,heavenX,2009-04-18T21:19Z,"@ sam: you poor, stupid nazi pig.
I don't feel pity for you because your ideas are evil. You are like the bad weed on the fields that the farmers pull out from the soil in order to extinct it.
Why do you have those ideas? You know that you are lying. You know that there where millions of jews in europe that where killed by the nazis , and millions that managed to flee to save countries. 
So read the book and start feeling. "
,HamEA,2009-05-19T00:50Z,"Yeah, Sam, I guess my grandfather tattooed the number on his arm for fun, right? People like you are disgusting, and truly dangerous to the world. Thanks for the upload, it's an amazing book, though I'd also recommend buying it and reading it because it really is worth it."

,mcon1964,2010-06-04T18:58Z,"Thanks for this, Gohf8iev! I have been looking
for YEARS for Maus in every bookstore I could
find without sucsess.There was one that had it displayed in the window, but it was closed. When I went back, it had been sold. I despaired of ever finding it until I discovered torrents and the
Pirate bay. A note to any noobs: this is in .cbr
format and you may need to download a viewer
to view it. There are several free viewers 
available online. Softonic has one called 
comical win 32 that works with windows 7 & xp."
,mcon1964,2010-06-07T07:11Z,You might also try Cplayer.
