Sipnosis:
Jane (Keri Russell) is a waitress in a small-town diner who learns that she is pregnant. 
Normally, this would be good news, but Jane is trapped in a dysfunctional marriage with her 
lowlife husband (Jeremy Sisto). The only positive things in Jane's life are her two oddball 
co-workers (Adrienne Shelly, Cheryl Hines), her amazing pie-making abilities and her illicit 
romance with the suave doctor (Nathan Fillion) who diagnosed her. This is the final film directed 
by and co-starring Adrienne Shelly.
