Anyone know how to make the game work on Win XP x64bit.  Or anyone whilling to share there working reg entery.  I just need a key that has been loaded a few times with a career started.  After that I will likely be able to load it in Win XP x64bit.   My error is;  

THere was a problem finding or creating one of the game's standard registery enteries.  Please contact support.


THe problem is that Support isn't being very helpful.  I guess that is what you get when you buy software!  Seems you get better support from them when it is hacked in anyway."

Re-installing the application may fix this problem.' But I dunno what to install =| This is probably some stupid thing that I dunno about but please help =]

Thanks in advance ^^"
,havega418,2009-08-12T02:18Z,Talmanonn well did you place the crack in the C Drive? that might be the problem. Place the game in C:\Program Files\Aspyr\Guitar Hero III that might do the trick.
