It's more like average (as in Joe Average), with a bit of the concept of bourgeois.  Though, ""Middle Americana"" would be a neologism, based on ""Middle America"", I think ""South Americana"" would be inappropriate, as it would most likely lead people to think of South America.  In English, Middle America does not have the same meaning as Central America (cf norw. mellom-amerika)."
[T],oddeven,2007-12-07T04:56Z,"There seems to be a fair amount of interest in this film, but no interest in seeding it.  I've uploaded it personally more than 5 times, but every time I see someone get to 99%, they disappear and don't seed.  I know documentaries aren't as glamorous, as, say, the latest Will Ferrell movie, but still, put in a little more than you take, please.  The quicker these uploads take on their own life, the quicker I can put up a new movie."
,grumpygroo,2008-02-21T16:30Z,No seeders. I give up!!!
[T],oddeven,2008-06-01T12:48Z,"ThineChum - I don't know Imgburn so I can't tell you exactly what to do.  I use Nero to burn isos, and if that doesn't work I run it through DVDShrink (without compressing it again).  That routine works pretty well.  I can't remember the last time I had to use another program to get to the burning stages. (I have used other programs like 1ClickCopy to try to squeeze the data out of particularly error-ridden originals).  Some folks might recommend DVDDecryptor, but I have had troubles getting it to work properly.
Please post your results."

i have been desperate for that movie for a while,
it's hard to come by: can't even find it on the eMule network...

I would really appreciate your effort!
