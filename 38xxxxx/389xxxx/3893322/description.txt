I'm reposting a torrent that was uploaded last week but disappeared rather immediately.  I think it's worth a second look.  I went looking for the title again when it was done, as SFTWEJ didn't ring any bells.  It was gone!

This is a documentary about the present-day Southern USA.  It's got some beautiful stories, and some not-so-beautiful stories, ditto on the music.

Quivering Southern Flesh.

Well worth a look.
