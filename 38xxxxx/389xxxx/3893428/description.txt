The one-liners in this game are worth it, e.g

Grunt with sponge-ball gun: "Guns don't kill Gruntz....balls kill Gruntz"

GAMESPOT REVIEW: 
Viewed from a top-down perspective, the world of Gruntz is a colorful place. The landscape is filled with multihued traps and roadblocks. In the single-player game, you must steer a team of gruntz from the starting position to your king, who waits in his fort at the end of each mazelike level. Along the way, you must pick up a puzzle piece called the "warp stone," and one of your gruntz must carry this stone to the king.

A wide variety of obstacles stand in your way. There are raised blockades that must be lowered, pits that must be filled, buttons that must be pressed, and enemy gruntz that attack on sight. Each level adds new challenges or new ways to deal with challenges, making the game grow exponentially more complex, as well as exponentially more interesting, with each success.

GAMESPY REVIEW:
Take control of the Gruntz, a lovable and annoying batch of creatures trying to find their way home. After fleeing through a wormhole to avoid an attack by their evil cousins, the Disgruntled, they are stranged in a strange world and have to fight their way back home. The game is half-puzzle, half-strategy. Your Gruntz move around the map collecting items, activating switches and killing Disgruntledz. The overall goal in the single player, or Questz, game is to recover 36 pieces of the warpstone. There are four pieces scattered in each of 8 different worlds. Each level requires you to retrieve the warpstone piece and take it to the Gruntz king on that level.
