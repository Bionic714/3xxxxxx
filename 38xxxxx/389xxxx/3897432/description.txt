An extremely quirky story of Harry and Flint, an unlikely couple. Harry is a shy young gay man who can't seem to fit due to a large birthmark in the shape of Madagascar on his face. Flint is a crusty, older, and seemingly straight man with a questionable background. They meet on a gorgeous English coastline, and evolve from distrust to deep love.
