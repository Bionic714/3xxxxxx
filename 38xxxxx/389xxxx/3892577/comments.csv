,raggamuffe,2007-11-15T07:31Z,Will this work with wiikey? Or is it necessary with an update disk also?
,raggamuffe,2007-11-15T08:46Z,"Hi HansolPirate, and thx for you answer!
Pls correct this method:
1: Download Super MG
2: Burn Super MG
1: Download update 1.9g from http://www.wiikey.cn/
2: Burn 1,9g on DVD
3: Put 1,9g update DVD in Wii console
4: Put Super MG DVD in Wii consule
5: Have lots of fun:-)
Does this seems to be the right way?"

,ozke,2007-11-17T18:40Z,"I got it work! just re-burned the iso with 4x speed, now it runs perfect!

zlatanista- You have to use filechop, and this is how you do it:

1. Download from wiikey.cn the files 'update1.9g' and 'config.1.3' 

2. extract these files. 

3. open the folder 'config.1.3' and copy the file 'filechop' 

4. Paste 'filechop' into the folder 'update1.9g' 

5. Click on 'start' then 'run'. 

6. click on 'browse' and find the folder 'update1.9g' 

7. double click on 'filechop' 

8. In the open text field, you should see something similar to this. 
""C:\Documents and Settings\Admin\Desktop\update1.9g\filechop.exe"" 

9. add this to the end of the text. bootdisc.xx.iso 1459978240 (were there is 'xx' put your region. For example. bootdisc.PAL.iso 1459978240) 

10. The text in the field should now look something like this. 
""C:\Documents and Settings\Admin\Desktop\update1.9g\filechop.exe"" bootdisc.PAL.iso 1459978240 

11. Hit 'OK' The size of your iso file should have changed now. "
,ozke,2007-11-17T18:43Z,"After the steps above your bootdisc.pal/usa/jap.iso should now be 1.35 gig

then just burn the iso on a DVD, i used TDK discs at 2x speed"
,raggamuffe,2007-11-17T19:34Z,"Hi You all SM fan?s!
Like ozke, I will try to help You all out there!
I see now many of You is wondering about update 1.9g and SMG.
HansolPirate, was very kind to me, confirming how make this working. I have now downloaded SMG, did the update, and yes, it works on my PAL!!
Here is my modyfied method:
1: Download SMG
2: Right click on SUPER MARIO GALAXY.iso(after unrared it), choose burn in NeroBurningRom, burn with Verbatim-R, speed 4x. Burn SMG
3: Download update 1.9g from http://www.wiikey.cn/
4: Right click on 1.9g-beta.rar, choose Extract here(find a proper place)
5:Right click on bootdisc.pal.iso(I need pal to my console), choose burn in NeroBurningRom, burn with Verbatim-R, speed 4x. Burn bootdisc.pal.iso  
6: Put SMG DVD in Wii consule, let the burned DVD do the update.(perhaps you don?t have to do this)
7: Try to start, but with no luck
8: Reset. Put 1,9g update DVD in Wii console and proceed with the update. NB! I had to do this 2 times, and the second time, I saw the updating proceed with red letters, then it was finished.
8: Reset. Put in SMG, and you have the greatest game on the galaxy!

Well after i re-burned the iso with 4x speed i got the 001 error 1 time but when i restarted the Wii it worked like a charm! If you still have the 001 problem try to burn it with diffirent speeds, like when i burned at 2x speed the game didnt start and when i burned at 4x speed it worked...

Yes they work on Wii =)"
,filip_xb95,2007-11-18T20:07Z,"hey guys this is it every one that have problem to make the update 1.9g pal/jap/usa file to be 1.5 gig big.

so just go in to http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download 
and download a program that calls imgburn then install it and at least burn the file bootdisc 1.9.

Basically:

-Update to Wii firmware 3.1E from the wii-console

-Make sure you have region free ON (by switching it on in 1.3) (There is a troubleshooting guide there aswell, if you can't get the 1.3 disc too boot)

-Flash 1.9g Wiikey firmware.
-Insert Super Mario Galaxy and run the update it will ask for.

DO it all in this order! 
PLAY!"
