CH-53A Sea Stallion

The CH-53 was designed to meet an ever increasing demand for payload and range commitments from the Marines and Navy, the Marines were looking for extended off beach deployment to secure there vessels from counter attack. The specifications also called for conversions to assault, personnel and medical transportation as well as downed air frame recovery. Sikorsky won the contract against stiff competition from Boeing and Kaman to produce what is one of todays fastest and heaviest utility helicopters.
