,Razzboy,2007-11-18T10:01Z,Year of production?
,Psi ink,2007-11-18T13:24Z,Thanks but goddamn seed it too?!!
,PurpleDog,2007-11-18T16:59Z,"Sorry guys, I am seeding but my connection isn't always the best. 

Razzboy - accord to the IMDB link, it was released in July of 2001.

The Seeders/leechers thing on here isn't totally accurate - uTorrent is telling me that there are 93 peers - although I am the only one seeding it at the moment."
,Razzboy,2007-11-18T17:54Z,"Hey tanks for information I have also checked IMDB, my download are now stuck on 78,8% so I will be realy happy if somenone couls seed"
,Psi ink,2007-11-18T18:20Z,"utorrent tells me that there are NO seeders, just like this site...and availability has been stuck at 0.789 all day???"
,Psi ink,2007-11-18T18:27Z,I recommend trying this one instead. It has seeders: http://isohunt.com/download/10679957/avalon
,Razzboy,2007-11-18T19:54Z,"excelent, tanks psi ink "
,dzombie,2007-11-18T22:28Z,"wtf? why is it stuck .79? there is ass tons of peers, but no seeders!common ppl! seed damn you!"
,Psi ink,2007-11-18T22:32Z,@dzombie. The torrent I just suggested will start at .79 if thatÂ´s where youÂ´re at. It will check the file and continue where this one left off :)
,dzombie,2007-11-18T22:36Z,"cool! thnx, i will check it out."
,dzombie,2007-11-18T22:38Z,how do i get azureus to check the file?
,dzombie,2007-11-19T10:15Z,"man, this is just like my last relationship. I kept sticking around thinking if i wait just a little longer maybe things will get better.Well, the only thing that really helped me after w broke up was the fact that i had a friend who went through a very similar situation. So, at least we are all miserably stuck in the dysfunction of NO SEEDS together, All sixty friggin four of us !"
,sweef,2007-11-19T12:49Z,"I hear ya dzombie, life after death man"
,PurpleDog,2007-11-19T21:16Z,"Geez guys, I'm TRYING to seed this. It was uploaded like two days ago, and my connection has been funky. My computer has been going on and off because of bad weather, not to mention slow upload/downloads. I've waited much longer without complaining on other torrents - just give it a couple of days, please?"
,bauldersboy11,2010-06-14T01:13Z,Thanks a million Psi Ink
