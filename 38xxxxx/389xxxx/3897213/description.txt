Incredible movie based on the incredible book. It's VERY true to the original book and is almost perfect. Any King Arthur/Camelot fan or Marion Zimmer Bradley fan, or even someone who generally doesn't like fantasy, will enjoy this. I did not originally upload this torrent, it was uploaded by someone else and has very few seeders since the original upload at a popular site that is now closed (we all know which one, I'm sure) and it's the only place I know of that has a torrent of this. I had to share! I've kept this on my computer for at least a year and a half now, that's how great this movie is. It's in two parts, each about an hour and a half long, and is fairly good quality. Not sure if it's a DVD rip or what, though. My share ratio on this is over 100, so I've been seeding it for quite a while :) Enjoy.
