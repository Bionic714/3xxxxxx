Please download this one instead http://isohunt.com/release/102704/maple+11.01+vista"

,ZeRR,2008-03-31T16:52Z,"If you would like open/save features 

find the Maple 11 execution file (maplew.exe?) or a shortcut to it. Right click--file->Properties. 

Select the compatibility tab. Check the box next to ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" if and select ""Windows 2000"".

Apply settings and click OK. Start Maple. Open your favorite math document and enjoy! "
,fonnest,2008-05-16T10:00Z,"If you want to save:
1. Download the latest version of java 
2. Go to C:/programs/java and copy the content of the folder called ""jre1.6.0_05"", and paste it into C:/programs/maple 11, and replace it with the existing ""jre"" folder

ps. The compatibility mode shouldn't be Windows 2000.

You should now be able to save your Maple sheet "
