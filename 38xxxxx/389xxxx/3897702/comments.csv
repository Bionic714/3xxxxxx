For newbies: 
Generally speaking, higher quality videos have a higher bitrate, and therefore a greater download size when compared with similar length videos of lesser quality.  

The quality for a particular upload is often toned down just enough to allow the movie to fit on a 700MB video CD.  This is done to help people who want to watch the movie with a DVD player but can only burn CDs, and also because a CD is cheaper than a DVD.

I hope this helps some newbies because I remember when I was new to this, and I really hated the spread of misinformation that was going on by other newbies who thought they were hot shit."
