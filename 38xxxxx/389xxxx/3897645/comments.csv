,thebradz,2008-03-31T14:32Z,"@ fuzzywuzzyz:
Sounds like you need to download and install Adobe Reader. This is a free program by Adobe that allows you to read PDF files. You can download it here: http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html?promoid=BUIGO

Also, regarding Metamap for the latest patch (2.4), MacReiben has released a ""pre-version"" which you can download on his website. http://macreiben.net/?Metamap

I have not tested this personally, and it may be in French, I'm currently using the guide without the waypoints, etc. so feel free to speak up if you have a version of Metamap that's working for 2.4"
,Archmaster0,2008-04-10T11:56Z,"The 2.4 meta-map from the site is in English and works fine.  The guide is awesome, thanks a lot, been using it to level many characters."

,hotcakes,2008-05-05T13:30Z,"awesome speed, thanks"
,Lordsiriuz,2008-05-12T21:09Z,"Im not sure how this works, i downloaded and installed it and it seems as i have to set the waypoints myself, i dont see the point in this, if this were i could just skip it and walk there myself since i know where it is, is there no way to get that waypoint to point automaticly where to go until i reach 60 or 70 =)?"
