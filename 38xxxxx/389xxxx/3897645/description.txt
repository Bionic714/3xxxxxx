* Re worked 20-60 for patch 2.3 so that all the improved experience changes were documented. This now allows the guide to be 100% questing 1-60 and not one bit of grinding
* Enlarged the font and changed it to a cleaner style
* Removed border from edge of pages while changing the margins slightly
* Added page numbers to all pages
* Seperated the guide into 3 sections. One section for all the starting races up to 20, one section for 20-60 and one section for 60-70. This will reduce lag on machines that had trouble with the bigger file of everything all in one.
