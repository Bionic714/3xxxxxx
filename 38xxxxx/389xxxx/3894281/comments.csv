So I switched to ""Initial-Seed"" mode. 

Please keep torrent running as long as possible!
Thank you!"

[T],troyBORG,2007-11-17T00:53Z,"""Hummm... nice but it whants a Cd key ...""
Yeah, this is just the CD.  

Suppose to be for people who already own the game, but there discs are to scratched to play :p

""Damn.. no seeders or leechers already?""

I still see 8 Seeders. And  I'm upload at ~100kB/s all the time!"

,Vesta88,2007-12-04T03:33Z,"im stucked at 22.6%

I get this messege..

Error: Data Error (cyclic redundancy check)

wtf?"
,wilson1375,2007-12-08T07:56Z,The CRC is refering to corupt data. Run scandisk and/or defrag or re-download. Or finish downloading (if I read correctly) :D
[T],troyBORG,2007-12-28T16:34Z,"Thanks for Seeding people.  I was having issues and had to reinstall my OS.  Then my Router was having issues and kept getting overloaded (dang linksys) so I installed ""Hyperwrt"" on my router and now it is working again :))"
,mongoloid92,2008-02-14T15:57Z,seed guys!
,4enzix,2008-02-15T18:31Z,"Hey, thanks for the torrent!
I'm new to this, i lost my broodwar cd so i thought id give this a try, ive got it downloaded and installed now but it asks for my broodwar CD.  I would assume thats what it means by mounting it?  How do i do that?"
,crazy2be,2008-02-16T00:12Z,"get daemon tools to mount it, or burn the iso to a cd."
[T],troyBORG,2008-02-16T06:52Z,"I use ""PowerISO"" myself.  But yeah, burn or mount the image.  It will work.

I noticed that sometimes when I'm seeding the torrent it only shows like 50% availability.  (I'm guessing people are just skipping the Starcraft and just getting the BroodWar).

I'm right now seeing the new torrent I just uploaded, but I see at least 7 seeds so thanks whoever is still seeing this.  Thanks a ton!"
,wykydtron,2008-03-05T05:33Z,"thank you, i still have my original keys, my original cd's are scratched to hell. dig them up and lets play on battlenet!"

,puljo669,2008-04-14T02:52Z,"Hey Guys, does any one no when Starcraft 2 is coming out???  Thnx for seeding everyone"
,Lumpyraptor,2008-06-01T01:38Z,"i understand how to mount the file and whatnot to daemon tools, but could somebody tell me which file is the ISO? there is no file that says starcraft.iso. i get a bunch of folders such as EARTHLINK and ISP. 

could anybody tell me what file the image is?"
[T],troyBORG,2008-06-14T07:58Z,"I have no idea how ""daemon tools"" works.  I think that program installs spyware on your PC or something.

I use powerISO like I said before.  When you mount the CD for me it just auto-runs and asks if I wanna install.  Else browse the drive and run the setup.exe"
,C_Dissonance,2008-08-29T02:07Z,lost my broodwar cd ages ago.  man i miss this game... thanks!
,unheimlich,2008-10-17T14:58Z,"Can you guys start seed please ,, would be nice :)"

torrent search starcraft+broodwar keygens

Thx for the torrent troyborg, 120kb/s all the way! "
,DanDanks,2009-08-23T06:25Z,"TPB community is so incredible. Just look at all the help and information that has been given out here. Questions answered, CD - Keys provided, instructions given. It's so great to see people work together like this.

Sorry to be a carebear, just makes me happy =)"
,daquist,2009-11-29T11:05Z,ok..i'm very confused about this..i can't figure out how to get it to work with daemon tools..me and my friend are trying to play. we have 1 working brood war disc..the other one needs a 26 dig cd key if anyone has one..and i'm not sure how to mount this one. or which thing to mount to get it to work. please help
,king03jeff,2009-12-15T13:53Z,nice. tested and working on windows 7.
,killshay,2009-12-23T20:01Z,Works great on my XP. Might need a no cd patch though in case I wanna switch from regular Starcraft to Starcraft: Brood War without having to have the CDs spinning in there
,Erasmios,2010-01-15T18:57Z,"Works great; needs activation code, simply google one. Lookup Daemon Tools on TPB to run it also."
,Swarm,2010-01-24T23:15Z,"it crashes when ur in game.. im using windows 7, any solutions for this? thanx"
,plasmafox2038,2010-01-31T14:32Z,Yes. Daemon tools does install spyware with recent versions. Use Virtual Clone Drive.
,Joetheodd,2010-02-23T02:06Z,Try 0000-00000-0003 as a CD-Key. Generated keys don't work on Battle.net anyhow.
,TFCJMHEW,2010-03-25T02:48Z,"i havent tried it out yet but thanks man
it downloaded pretty fast too"
,Pewpewheal,2010-05-15T00:59Z,"Cmon you leechers buy a better internet connection and seed moar only downloading it with half of the current speed can be much more :P 

Thx for uploading, will keep seeding for a long time"
,denikarabenc,2010-08-05T13:27Z,"Great job, very fast download.
Thanx"
,MS000086,2010-08-14T07:52Z,"I can't find my original CD, but I know it's somewhere in my house. Thanks to this, I can use this and just play the expansion. I still have the expansion CD thankfully. Thank seeders, I'll continue to seed this for others."
,Mitzos,2010-09-23T01:11Z,"SOLUTION FOR RUNNING UNDER WINDOWS 7

Download Affinity.exe (game doesn't like dual core)
create a Starcraft.bat (create a *.txt and rename it to *.bat)
put the affinity.exe and the starcraft.bat in your starcraft folder (in this example i will use C:\Starcraft)
type the following text into the starcraft.bat file:

taskkill /IM explorer.exe /F
cd ""C:\starcraft""
affinity starcraft.exe 
pause
start explorer.exe

if the game still crashes, try compatibility mode win 98 and run as administrator (though i am not doing that, runs fine for me)

tested under win 7 64x

great torrent thx!!!"
,Mitzos,2010-09-23T01:15Z,"You can get Affinity.exe here http://www.leweyg.com/download/affinity.html Oh, and i forgot, the starcraft.bat as i discribed fixes color problems and crashing !!! "
,domacleod,2010-12-01T15:14Z,"Yo' for those that didn't know, daemon tools is a little outdated and/or a little too strict. Try Alcohol 120 (or 140)% or Power Iso. Those two can mount any sort of stuff that has cd image on it. (even unrecognized formats)

Ty for seeding, some people like me wanna remember what happened in SC I before we play SC II :P"
,haveaquestion,2011-01-03T01:52Z,Luv you gies!!!

,SmokeTheChron,2011-11-03T16:24Z,"This is a stupid question, but I've got the original starcraft CD case out in my car, keeping mp3 cd's in it since there was no game in it when I found it. (cleaning out a foreclosed home) Would I be lucky enough to have a CD key stated on that case that would be valid? If it does and it works, I'll gladly post here and share. I'm downloading now and I'll report back either way. Big ups & I'll seed as long as I can"
,Sten0ne,2011-11-04T00:12Z,"sad to say that it didnt work for me when i tryed to launch SETUP.exe on the starcraft iso
it said ""no startmenu group found"" or something along those lines

im running ""Win 7ultimate sp1 32bit""
and amd athlon II X2 250 Processor 3.00Ghz
and 4gb ram

so it cant be my pc =/
it might be my pirate copy of windows or something...
eitherway downloaded from somewhere else
thx tho
(will seed 1.00ratio)"
,Jon2theJon,2011-11-13T08:48Z,Thanks for the upload. I actually bought this game over a decade ago but I lost all the CD's but managed to find the key code written on piece of paper.
