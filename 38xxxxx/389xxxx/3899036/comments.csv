,team_sleep,2007-11-19T10:07Z,Awesome dude. Cheers for split upload as im too lazy to split it myself. Going to see em (first time) in 4 weeks time. SO FUCKING AMPED!!!! Shame they'll probably go into hiding and retire the pyramid at the end of this year. 
,Azagedon,2007-11-19T13:15Z,AMAZING I LOVE YOU SOO MUCH!!!! Im seeding! :D 10/10

,carmichael,2007-11-19T18:31Z,Fake? Coachella 2006 recording 
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-19T18:46Z,"carmichael shut the fuck up.

this guy downloaded my torrent (which he kept going on about being fake) then split it up and posted it saying its alive 2007.

wow demon wizard what a fucking cunt you are. i will be reporting this as a copy post you fuck."
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-19T18:51Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!
HE USED MY TORRENT AND SPLIT IT UP AND UPLOADED IT AS HIS OWN.
DONT DOWNLOAD.
HE DIDNT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE DOWNLOADED MY TORRENTS."
,DemonWizard,2007-11-19T18:56Z,"I said in the comments of you torrent that i had change my mind about being a fake.

I´m only offering a splitted up version of your torrent.

Be pissed with the guy on mininova who posted the same thing.

***its one contiuous track, sorry, but you guys arent that special im gonna splice it up for you. you can do that on your own as this was a bitch for me to get in the first place.***"
,ixlikextoxdansex,2007-11-19T19:07Z,"just acknowledge that you at least downloded from my torrent and i'll stop.
"
,Ledaren,2007-11-19T19:11Z,"stop whining ixlikextoxdansex, its just a fucking torrent. I'll rather download this one because there actually several tracks and not just one. So go fuck yourself you lazy basterd."
,DemonWizard,2007-11-19T20:43Z,"Well, you deserve the credits for being the first one to release the real Alive 2007 and the Encore.

But i´m not trying to take that from you. I just wanted to share the splitted tracks that i've made.

It´s a pain in the ass to listen to an one track album in your car player or your stereo."
,ZonzoMaster,2007-11-20T00:44Z,"THX, will seed as soon as it's completed."
,Famf,2007-11-20T05:01Z,"Awesome.  Thanks for the upload.

And taking the time to spilt the tracks."
,allshow,2007-11-20T11:16Z,..wait.. I'm all for torrents.. but do I really see someone upset about torrent ownership?  I think you missed the point. 
,team_sleep,2007-11-20T11:33Z,Maybe ixlikextoxdansex could sue you for torrent copyright infringement. :) I thank demon wizard for splitting it. simply because i dont have the software on my computer to do it and im too damn lazy to find it and then work out where the tracks need to be split. thats the great thing about the internet. if your too lazy to do something. there is always someone out there who isn't and is willing to share. god bless demon wizard and god bless my fat lazy ass.
,PPKLP,2007-11-20T12:05Z,"I'm getting verrrrryyy confused with all the different versions of Coachella bootlegs, transcoded versions of the same source, full lenght mp3's without cue files, Japanese version, thousands of different playlists and people are fighting over trorrent-props... I'm gonna go out and buy the retail version of the dubble album as soon as spot it...

So everybody look out for my torrent in a few days: [PPKLP] Daft Punk - Alive 2007 (inc. Bonus disc) [@320kbps]

I'll post it ASAP!!!"
,strafe,2007-11-20T12:23Z,"I have the original, didn't come with a bonus disc.  Eagerly awaiting a proper release so I can get the encore (if it exists ;) ).  If anyone wants me to upload the Australian Release, plz let me know ;)."
,jayeshb,2007-11-20T13:38Z,Pwnage!
,PPKLP,2007-11-20T14:38Z,"Ok... I did!!! I bought the official release (retail deluxe edition with bonus disc) and I have uploaded it here:
