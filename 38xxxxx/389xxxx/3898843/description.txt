Album notes 
For the 2007 Broadway adaptation of the popular Hollywood comedy LEGALLY BLONDE, actress Laura Bell Bundy ably fills the pink high heels of screen star Reese Witherspoon as the pampered, yet assertive, Valley girl Elle Woods. Highlights of the cast recording include the energetic opener, "Omigod You Guys" and the lightly funky "Positive," songs that reinforces the production's fun-loving girl-power-lite theme.
