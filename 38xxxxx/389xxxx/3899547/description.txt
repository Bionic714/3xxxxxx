	Whereas groups like Staind move in a linear fashion from full-on rockers to ruminative power ballads, the four young men of 12 Stones instead take a page from the book of Nirvana, unabashedly moving back and forth between depth-charge nu-metal and melodic, contemplative moods within the space of a single song. In fact, this is the modus operandi for the lion's share of the songs on the band's self-titled debut album. Judging from the chart placing of 12 STONES it seems that the gambit worked in a big way. And why not? With such songs as "Crash" and "Back Up" those who appreciate the heavy stuff and the mellower mode in equal measure can have their cake and eat it too. Just don't get any of that cake on the band's rug, because judging from the piercing attack of those grinding guitars, they know how to administer the proverbial beatin'.
