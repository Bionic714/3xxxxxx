,nilpferdkoenig,2007-11-21T13:41Z,"Funktioniert perfekt mit dem Xbox 360 Controller, ich bin nur ein sehr schlechter Rennfahrer also bin ich immer letzter:)"
,nilpferdkoenig,2007-11-24T15:51Z,Xbox 360 controller works well but I suck so much at the game that it doesn't matter.

,rt-head,2007-12-05T14:58Z,"how do I install??
dont understand *read me*?"
,fukvista,2007-12-06T15:28Z,"It says you must use the start.exe and not to worry it is not a virus. Sounds fishy so I ran the launcher without the start.exe and voila ran perfect.I don't know what the ""start.exe"" is, but I would not trust it. Game works fine without."
,fukvista,2007-12-06T19:03Z,"To get this to work to it's full potential you must download the update 4.060 Do not run the update, Extract the update file to a temp folder on desktop(the update will not install automatically) Then manually copy and overwrite originals in the SEGA RALLY folder.
To start game  click on ""SegaRally Launcher.exe"" NOT ""SegaRally REVO Launcher.exe""

This will unlock a lot of options and maps that this original does not have. It also fixes a lot of bugs and controllers work much,much better!"
,fukvista,2007-12-06T19:15Z,"Update for Above post

You must use cracked files for 4.060 once you use updated files. they can be dloaded from GameCopyWorld


Also do not overwrite complete folders ie: copy files from ""system folder"" from update and paste files in ""system folder"" Sega Rally directory etc........ "
,rt-head,2007-12-07T11:32Z,"I will try to get i work...but I dont can run launcher?,,say some dll file dont exist and tell me to reinstall?"

[V],Subzero!,2007-12-13T20:06Z,"@fukvista

youre a great example of an nonbeliever!... we'll see if you can play the game to the end!. if you cant!, come back and ill tell ya more about the start.exe!... to increase your knowledge!"
