,smumdax,2008-08-17T21:27Z,"For any one who has problem playing ANY video file, I highly recommend VLC... instead of the above suggestion of installing a codec pack...

VLC plays about 90% of all video files known, and considering that 25% of those are commonly in use, you will rarely find a file that can't be played... and that includes DVDs.

You don't have to download any codecs, just update your VLC once in a while, and everything will play just fine.

Search for VLC player in Google."
