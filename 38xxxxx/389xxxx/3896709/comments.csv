I have PowerDVD 7.3 Ultra, I just don't know how to use it. If someone could help me, that'd be great. Thanks in advance. "

,neurosis13,2007-12-29T05:14Z,"all newer versions of powerdvd do not support 
harddisk playback of 1:1 HD rips anymore.
use google to find PowerDVD (7.3.3120.0).
Only this version worked for me."

,Neuromods,2008-01-29T13:56Z,"Downloaded this and tried with many versions of Power DVD that people posted here. The movie would play showing parts of the making only, then would say file error and play the movie with the directors voice all through it. Can't watch the main movie or use menu. Power DVD would not allow me to choose a menu. I have a Sony Vaio top of the line PC that plays HD files with no problem."
