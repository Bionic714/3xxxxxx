,tbone76,2007-11-17T13:13Z,I stated I would not share if no one seeds. this is good stuff so people need to do their part...
,celemirima,2007-11-17T20:41Z,"Yeah, we are ready to take over, seed just for a little while more!"
,lifewest,2007-11-18T14:36Z,tbone 76 please
,celemirima,2007-11-18T23:55Z,"yeah, I have been stuck at 99.8%, I am ready to kick some ass.  I saw there were 2 seeders for while, don't know if that was true."
,celemirima,2007-11-19T14:43Z,"thanks TheLane for posting, that is great stuff!  It really chaps my ass that we are only 1mb away from finishing!!!@!@@?~!"
,psxguy,2007-11-22T03:39Z,99.9%.  Please someone seed that last little bit.  I'll seed until there's enough seeders to keep it active.  I've already seeded 100% of my download.
,kid_zeal7,2007-11-30T04:16Z,"Dude this upload is awesome but... 99.9% completed.  We need that last 0.1%!!  The only song that's corrupted is Lips of an Angel by Jack Ingram, otherwise known as Hinder.  A shame too, since I love that song!  Please seed for just 1 more day and I will seed for a month minimum!  Already uploaded out over 4GB in 2 days."
,jouir,2007-11-30T15:42Z,"hi  !

,tbone76,2007-12-04T07:22Z,sorry guys went out of town...
,tbone76,2007-12-04T07:25Z,please seed once you have the rest. I spent a lot of time ripping all these down and sharing them. thanks and please bring some to share also.
,kid_zeal7,2007-12-04T08:16Z,Yay!  Thanks for the rest!
,stickybeak,2007-12-04T13:25Z,What player needed for this?
,tbone76,2007-12-04T19:12Z,"almost any karaoke player works. cavs, winamp, windows media player has a plugin that works, virtual dj, pcdj and many more all support mp3+g"
,psxguy,2007-12-07T02:01Z,Thanks for finishing this off.  Left for a week and come back to find 20 seeds to finish off my .1% :D
,Songman,2007-12-19T18:48Z,"Good stuff here but lots of the titles are wrong. Most of the country is titled wrong.  Like George Strait - Give It Away is actually Trace Adkings - Ladies Love Country Boys, which doesn't even appear in the track list. Not taking anything away from the person that made ripped this but just FYI."
,tbone76,2007-12-28T21:21Z,"actually songman, I believe there is only one disc labeled wrong. I use tricerasoft cdg ripper to rip the original cdg and it labels them automatically. If you look up tyhe disc number from the manufacturer pop hits monthly, the tracks are all correct, just those few files are wrong. hope all have enjoyed these as they cost me a lot of money and time to rip...."
,shel74,2008-02-03T08:25Z,"I have a silly question I'm sure. This is my first time downloading Karaoke. I was wondering if I just do with it as I do a movie. Download it, put it through flick, and use nero to burn onto a dvd? I have been doing movies it seems like forever but I really want this and want to make sure I am doing it right. Thanks in advanced to whoever feeds me some help."
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-02-05T08:01Z,"a songlist would be extremely helpful... considering i have close to 10,000 mp3+g/cdg songs, and i'd like to update, if you can get me a songlist, i'll permanently seed this."
,mmanthie,2008-02-29T15:10Z,"If Anyone Is Using Hoster Karaoke I Have 16000
Songs In a Kma Format"
,maggiemoo,2008-05-31T20:12Z,Pls seed... stuck at 27.0%.....:(
,Daven66,2009-01-02T20:06Z,will these work in karoke machines if you burn them to a CD?
,tbone76,2009-03-12T11:08Z,"if you burn them to a cd properly, they will play.

Just for those wanting to know......

this is pop hits monthly pop, urban, and country

from jan 2007 to september 2007

also contains a few extras such as adult contemporary. 

as someone stated, a few tracks are labeled wrong, but if you use a songbook list you will have the propper track. it is not too many though.

enjoy and someone post some newer stuff please. this was all new when i upped it."
