,Agge666,2007-11-15T07:36Z,"According to some people, It´s only to run the installer and then It works fine!"
,SPEC_06,2007-11-15T08:55Z,Samebody have a crack?
,FUCKWOS,2007-11-15T09:22Z,"yes we need a loader like all the other captsim products, where is wildmans?

do we have any crackers out there? maybe they can examine the other captsim loaders to determine what and how to crack this baby,

seems this is useless until then, i have it loaded in fsx but the wheels are missing, it must be looking for a captainsim reg entry or a guage/dll is looking for something,

Agge666, might wanna check your registry for any captansim entries, and check see what dll/s if any that the xload installed,

i uniextracted this exe and there are some dll's but i dont know if these are just for the installer or if they are for the plane itself and need to be in s acertain place,

here the dll's from the exe;

System.dll
UserInfo.dll
csUser.dll
csWinHttp.dll"
,SPEC_06,2007-11-15T21:53Z,"I was working on it but it still dont work...

,Agge666,2007-11-18T16:02Z,"Oki...I searched my register and find a couple of Captain Sim maps. In one of them was some reg. files. When I deleted the files, my wheels disapeared, and the installation program want to register again....well, thats my discovery..2"
,FUCKWOS,2007-11-18T16:17Z,"Agge666,

mid posting the reg entries? or export the reg file?
"
,Agge666,2007-11-18T23:30Z,"FUCKWOS...

I don´t think it will do any good for the wheels to post reg. entries.

I´ve read this on Captain Sim´s site:

The product cannot be installed on more than two Computers. But can be re-installed and activated on the same PC an unlimited number of times.

No, a Crack for the wheels!!!!!"
