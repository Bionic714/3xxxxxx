,Aga1980,2007-11-28T12:19Z,No seeding? No peers?
,Aga1980,2007-11-28T14:52Z,"Oops, tracker problem. Sorry..."
,agenthex,2007-12-01T13:58Z,"Hey dude, you gotta use superseed or this thing not gotta get uploaded."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-12-11T09:45Z,"Megalilo, you have not completed the seeding of this torrent nor of King of Kings. Please do not upload new torrents before you have completed the former ones, meaning that at least a few leechers have reached 100%. The major task when uploading a torrent is the ability to seed it, often for days if it is a dvd, you have to close other torrents and turn the upload speed to ""unlimited"".  "
,sonicalchemy,2007-12-24T17:06Z,"""Turn the machine back on back on seed come on seed.."" I have left my computer on for 40 days on straight and now no seeds wtf its at 97.3 and STUCK. If you are going to be like this I have the subs and I will make a new torrent file because I have the 5 DVDs wich I am STILL SEEDING so whats it gonna be and I will make a more quality rip than yours... just dont try to look cool showing off that you have the goods share the goods! the right way so others can enjoy it also and I will post this message in  my torrent if you don't comply....."
[V],Kuthumi,2008-01-08T08:36Z,"Thank you very much for finishing this upload. However, I can only find subtitles in Russian - not much help when the soundtrack is in Russian. "
,hardloginatgraffiti,2008-01-08T12:34Z,"There is subtitles in Russian, English, French, Japanese, Hebrew, Swedish, Chinese, Dutch, Portugese, German, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and Greek.

Use the program VobSub."
,Gdowson,2009-02-18T19:27Z,"This was a magnificent-looking film in the 70mm original. The print used here does not give a true indication of the way this movie looked.

The subtitles are all included. You hve to unpack the rar file and put the resultant .sub file in the same folder as your movie. But there's a problem...

The Russian subtitles are the first in line, and they are all you see if you use GOM or VLC player. In order to see the English subtitles instead, open the idx file in notepad and remove all timecode information for the Russian subtitles. 

This is easier than it sounds. Just open ""find"" in notepad -- then look for the word ""English"". You will soon see where the English subtitles start. The Russian subtitles are above that; get rid of them.

Once you have done that, you can watch the movie using GOM player. It will automatically show the English subtitles.

I have no idea why there are Russian subtitles prepared for a Russian film. (A few parts of the film ARE in French...)"
