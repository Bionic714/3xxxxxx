Voyna i mir (1968) is an six-hour epic film based on the eponymous book by Leo Tolstoy. Two main story-lines are complex and intertwined. One is the love story of young Countess Natasha Rostova and Count Pierre Bezukhov, who is unhappy in his marriage. Another is the "Great Patriotic War" of 1812 against the invading Napoleon's Armies. 

Like Tolstoy's novel, this epic-length War and Peace is rough going, but worth the effort. Winner of the 1969 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and widely considered the most faithful adaptation of Tolstoy's classic, Sergei Bondarchuk's massive Soviet-Italian coproduction was seven years in the making, at a record-setting cost of $100 million.

Bondarchuk himself plays the central role of Pierre Bezukhov, buffeted by fate during Russia's tumultuous Napoleonic Wars, serving as pawn and philosopher through some of the most astonishing set pieces ever filmed.

According to the Guinness Book of Records, the Battle of Borodino scene included 120,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest battle scenes ever filmed. Many museums in the USSR contributed artifacts for the production design, making it one of the most elaborate films ever created.

â?¢ Adjusted for inflation, this film cost over $560 million to make, and is thus the most expensive film ever made.

â?¢ This film was made with the complete cooperation of the Soviet Army which is how they managed to get as many extras into the war scenes as they did.

It's included into the torrent subtitles in Russian, English, FranÃ§ais, Japanese, Hebrew, Svenska, Chinese, Nederlands, Portugues, Deutsch, EspaÃ±ol, Italiano, Arabic, Greek, English for the Hearing Impaired, FranÃ§ais for the Hearing Impaired. All in sub format.
