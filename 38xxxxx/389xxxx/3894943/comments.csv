,Pufcio,2007-11-18T15:22Z,"I know that, but I've been unable to d/l this via torrent, so I got 2 d/l it via other p2p. After d/l I wanted to share this, because d/l speeds of this release are awfully low. I run my pc 24/7 to share as much data as I can."
,NickTheGreek89,2007-11-20T09:56Z,louist read the read me file inside the half life folder.What i dont get is how to verify the name of the shortcut with the -steam -game ep2 extension it wont let me.
,Ahreeman,2007-11-20T20:24Z,Is anyone going to seed this?
,mnstrfrmhell,2007-11-23T18:07Z,ok i have dl this i have read the read me but i still dont get were im soposed to put the peramiters in and i dont see a hl2.exe i just see hl2 with an icon plz help me.
,Pufcio,2007-11-29T00:33Z,"For all those, who don't know how to start the *.exe with parameters. You have two choices:
(If Episode 2 is unpacked to C:\HL )
1) run the game from command line
2) run the game via shortcut

Ad.1
Let's assume, that exe is located within the c:\HL folder. The command line (Win+R, or ""run"" from start menu) will look like this:
""C:\HL\hl2.exe"" -steam -game ep2

The quotation marks DO matter!

Create a shortcut to hl2.exe (for example - right click on desktop, select new -> shortcut) and browse to hl2.exe. When the path box will fill itself, just add -steam -game ep2, so the final path will look like this: C:\HL\hl2.exe -steam -game ep2

Hope this instructions will help."
,Pufcio,2007-11-29T01:08Z,"mnstrfrmhell - your system doesn't show file extensions - google it, and enable the file extensions display and you'll see the .exe in the file.
Yet, there's another option to make a shortcut - mark the hl2 icon, hold ALT on the keyboard & left mouse button and then move cursor anywhere else in the directory. Release mouse button and ALT and the shortcut will appear. Now it's possible to add -steam -game ep2 to the shortcut command line."
,share2,2007-12-04T13:23Z,How do i make it running??
,DarkRiegeSen,2007-12-12T06:11Z,"Alright I downloaded this but I am having a serious problem. On the level mutual fiend (ep2_outland_11) when you find Eli and he opens the door and Alyx says ""Some things just never change"" and Eli points out the door the animations lock. It says it can not find the gestures ep2/gesture_step_01.bsp or something like that."
,DarkRiegeSen,2007-12-12T06:15Z,I am going to redownload it.
,DarkRiegeSen,2007-12-12T06:25Z,I know what it is! I was snooping around in the folder and I swear I accidently deleted something. I think I deleted those gesture files. I am going to extact my quicksave and redownload this torrent then put it back in.
,DarkRiegeSen,2007-12-12T06:29Z,"I will do anything for whoever seeds this torrent. I have $190..... fuck that, if it is not seeded then I will just buy the damn thing...."
,DarkRiegeSen,2007-12-16T05:02Z,"Nvm, this is not the one I downloaded before. Honestly, it sucks. I am about to buy Half-Life 2 because I am so tired of this shit. Almost all the animations in the game are missing and the transaction part from ep2_outland_11 ot ep2_outland_11a is gone. It sucks."
,Pufcio,2007-12-19T22:41Z,"DarkRiegeSen - screw you! No one except you is fckn complaining, I have finished this game and I haven't discovered any missing animations or other crap. Maybe you're such a retard, that you unpack from r.00 instead of .rar? If game works on other pc's, and you're and exception then who's makin' the fckn asshole of himself here? 
(Hint: at first look at your pity self in the mirror, and then try to answer this question, dumbass)
You haven't uploaded a single torrent here, yet you're fcnk yellin'! I have never ever seen such a fckn looser like you! Go screw a goat, cocksucker."
,PeakOil,2008-01-15T08:31Z,"I finally got the time to install the game and ALAS, I get the Blue Screen of Death just after it finished the Valve intro. 
Something about nv4_disp.dll

Haven't had any probs with the first HL2 episode, so my thinking is that it shouldn't be my HW that isn't up to spec. 

Can anyone help????"
,PeakOil,2008-01-15T09:01Z,"I did an update of the graphics driver and that seems to have solved it. 
Thanks anyway"
,Nyck26,2008-01-31T14:31Z,This torrent is ok. Thanks.

,Phyxious,2008-10-03T18:06Z,Forgot to say that I can find it... but the computer cant. The name of the target is C:\HL2\hl2.exe -steam -game ep2. Am I doing something wrong here?
,Pufcio,2008-10-12T12:51Z,Phyxious - didn't you unpack from r.00 instead of .rar ?

,LovinColors,2012-05-14T08:13Z,"@DarkRiegeSen

Wow. Just wow. I don't know about other torrentors (Did I spell that right?) but the only reason all the pirates I know including myself only pirate because we're young, have no money, and/or parents are scared of online shopping. If you have $190 then you should buy stuff."
