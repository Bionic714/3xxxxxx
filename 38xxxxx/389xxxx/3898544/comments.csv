,Qeenix,2007-12-17T17:00Z,ppl seed! Thanks! :-)
,boulesbleues,2007-12-28T15:26Z,Is this torrent OK? Is it really Island Fever 4?
,sliced68,2008-01-04T04:09Z,"Can't get a player to do this 12GB file correctly so far; tried ""VLC media player"" - mostly black w/choppy audio - pause key brings in some pics / very choppy; also tried ""FantasyDVD Player 9 4 1 Build1218""; anyone else get this to play?
TIA!"
,McShane87,2008-02-05T05:58Z,It takes a lot of RAM and processing power to play these big files which might be why it's choppy for you.  Try KM player it plays anything and uses the fewest resources of any player I've come across so that all your power of your computer can go to playing the file.

To answer your question, yes...yes it is."

lol fd, only the extremist pornobbe's would know the answer to your question. In theory, probably more sperm accumulates coz the eye would transmit a signal to the brain that the clarity of the image is better, hence your tsetostorone will multiply and cause a stronger quantity whilst ejaculating"
,thabag,2008-04-07T19:10Z,Best player is windows media player
,GetPwnt,2008-04-23T09:23Z,lol no. VLC Player.
,Bambi-Slam,2008-05-08T18:19Z,"Definately the highest res porn I have ever seen.
Crystal clear  which can both good and bad I guess, but in this case is good.
There are some glitches in the graphics.  The sort you get on a satellite dish when the wind is really blowing.  Artifacting.  Nothing major, but it affects the video and audio in several places.
Thansk for sharing."
