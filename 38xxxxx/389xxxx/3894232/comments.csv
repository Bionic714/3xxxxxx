,kmell,2007-11-16T07:39Z,"Great! Don't stop :)

Thank You!"
,skamfer,2007-11-16T13:52Z,"THANKS, GREAT.
Can you reseed/restart GUNSMOKE 101-103?
There are no seeders or leechers.
Thanks again and keep them coming"
,skamfer,2007-11-17T01:49Z,"Have downloaded for 12 hours and got only 4.5%!!!!!!!! Open up your seeding people
Thanks"
[T],flixer,2007-11-17T13:17Z,"skamfer: This is a multi-tracker torrent and one of the trackers is inferno.demonoid which is offline at the moment. Be sure you have DHT and PEX enabled in your client to get maximum connections with the swarm. Gunsmoke 101-103 has many seeds reported on Zero.tracker which is one of trackers included in this torrent. Unfortunately, sometimes TPB stats are not very accurate or unreported. Try editing the trackers in the torrent, putting Zero.tracker at the top. Hope this helps. :)"
,skamfer,2007-11-17T13:42Z,"Thanks ""flixer"". I'm not so good at this stuff.
I'm going to try to do what you write.
Thanks again"
,skamfer,2007-11-17T13:53Z,"""flixer"". DHT was enabled but i don't know what PEX is or where to find. On properties on the torrent i had TPB on top and then demonoid and zero tracker on the bottom. I ""put"" zero tracker on top and then TPB and demonoid, is that correct?. As i said previously i'm not so good at this.
Thanks for your help and this serie"
,skamfer,2007-11-17T14:03Z,"I checked on properties again and somehow TPB tracker is on top again with zero tracker is back on bottom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you help me solve this ""problem""?
Thanks"
[T],flixer,2007-11-18T09:42Z,"skamfer, might be easiest to look for the torrent file on isohunt and download the one with the most trackers with seeds. Then point the save path to the directory where you were downloading the file before, do a recheck of pieces, and continue from there. Good luck :)"
[T],flixer,2007-11-18T09:54Z,"PEX is peer exchange. You should use uTorrent or Azureus to take advantage of it. I use Azureus so if you had it too, you would have an easier way of connecting to me through pex or dht. Other clients are not good at handling this trackerless ways of finding peers imnsho. ;)"
,skamfer,2007-11-18T13:54Z,"thanks ""flixer"". 
I will try to do what you suggest. Sorry about all the troubble i give you
many thanks"
,bigh704,2008-01-04T22:21Z,Took 101 - 103 to Elmer this week and he was thrilled.  Told him i would have some more next time I came.  Thanks again
