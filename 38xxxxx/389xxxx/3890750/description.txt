Kubuntu 7.10 removed the feistiness, becoming the gutsiest release to date. Improved desktop, updated applications and increased usability features are just a few of the surprises with this latest release. The goal for Kubuntu 7.10, codenamed Gutsy Gibbon, was to remove the edge and the feistiness from previous releases and to continue on the creation of a secure and stable desktop environment, on a road to becoming the perfect KDE based operating system. The development team has once again succeeded in reaching their goals, and we are very happy to bring you this new release. We hope you enjoy your Kubuntu 7.10 experience.
