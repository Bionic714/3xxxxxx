,kerti,2007-11-16T20:03Z,Sorry for the slow upload speed everyone. My connection isn't the greatest. I'm trying to close my torrents as little as possible.
,gabanna07,2007-11-20T00:44Z,thanks so much!! been looking for this
,kerti,2007-11-20T06:34Z,No problem. :) I know how much searching it took for me to find this and when demonoid (where I found and got it from) went down I felt I had to upload it to a new site to continue sharing it for all the other fans out there.

,fivetwothree,2008-03-31T20:39Z,please seed please please! I have been wanting this for so long!
,kerti,2010-06-08T02:13Z,Sorry that I stopped seeding this torrent. My hard drive that it was on crashed and I have not been able to recover it. :(
