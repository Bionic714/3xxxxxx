I will have more PS2 games to upload - I need your feedback otherwise I'm wasting everyones time, bandwidth and their hopes too.

May I also remind leechers that they are to seed at least 1:1.  Be fair to people on the BT network, it's why we do this - learn how to produce backups and upload them, it's worth it and let EVERYONE enjoy.
