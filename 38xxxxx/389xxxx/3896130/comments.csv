,Jamminrock,2010-07-18T00:43Z,"Great Video, but I have a story to tell... I was cleaning up a house and found a VHS Jimi Hendrix: Live At the Monterey Pop Festival. The previous owners had only taken their clothes and left the house a wreck. It played all of the songs you see here but my VHS Copy has more songs. The video was stolen from me by someone I let borrow it but the one song I like the most on it was the fact that three days prior to the concert the Beatles released Sgt. Peppers Lonely heart Club Band and Jimi Hendrix Covered it 3 days after it was released. Does anybody know where I can find or buy a copy of it on cd or dvd. They don\'t make it anymore, DAMN THEM"
