Back in 1967 Jimi Hendrix made his US live debut with The Experience at the Monterey Pop Festival. This year marks the 40th Anniversary of Jimi's legendary performance (including the famous guitar on fire sequence).


The DVD has been digitally remastered and mixed in 5.1 Surround Sound by Jimi's original sound recording engineer, Eddie Kramer. The picture quality is sharp as a razor, almost impeccable. The original analogue recording mixed in 5.1 is raw, punchy, supersonic and exciting.


The film footage is crystal clear, almost three dimensional and there is no sign of grain. It's as if Hendrix is jumping out of your LCD or Plasma screen.
