,palmofsweden,2007-11-19T17:55Z,For god sake SEED! Im getting sick at people posting a torrent and not seed it.
,Panodilo,2007-11-19T19:26Z,"Settle down there, Beavis. Seeding fine. "
,Panodilo,2007-11-19T19:34Z,Crack works like a fucking charm. Beautiful airport! Textures are juicier than two cum swapping Thai hookers.
,palmofsweden,2007-11-19T20:30Z,"Haha, Panodilo, settle down? Im having a meltdown here, lol."
[T],supaturtle,2007-11-19T20:36Z,damn leechers ;)
,palmofsweden,2007-11-19T23:08Z,"Im up to a ratio of 0.770, and currently there are no leechers whatsoever, hehe."
,palmofsweden,2007-11-19T23:08Z,I will continue seeding tommorow.
,charonB,2007-11-20T01:50Z,"This one's a fake!  }:( 

The cracked files are exactly the same in the FS9 and FSX folders (CRC32-tested) and they don't work properly in FS9 both night and day!  }:( 

So don't use it.
This crack is no FS9-crack!

I can't say, if it works in FSX, cause I don't use it..."
,EDVN,2007-11-20T15:20Z,Works fin in FS2004
,charonB,2007-11-21T00:40Z,"No, it doesn't."
,Rubber_Duck,2007-11-21T14:18Z,"believe in me, it works"
,charonB,2007-11-21T18:12Z,"If you fly at night, most of the textures don't show.
If you fly at day, the runway shows flickering of two different textures. That's wat I call a bad crack! :("
,palmofsweden,2007-11-22T12:26Z,"Then go and make a new crack, if you like to complain so much!"
,charonB,2007-11-22T17:05Z,"@clum: Exactly what I saw.
Without any addons installed at Edinburgh before. :/
As said before: The files for FS9 and FSX are exactly the same - so I suppose, it is an FSX-Crack."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-07-30T19:13Z,Does anyone know if Birmingham or any of the other FSX versions of the Xtreme series are available?  This seems to be the only one I can find FSX-wise on TPB but I could be searching wrong.
,HarryBB,2009-03-25T08:35Z,"worx perfect in fs9: just rename the cracked .bgl to .bgl1 and leave both, the original and the cracked bgl in the same scenery directory... thats me!"
