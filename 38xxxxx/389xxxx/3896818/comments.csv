If you enjoyed the album please buy it if have the chance to do so. This is the only way to support young talents. And after download please seed as long as you possibly can!"

Inace Nevena je prelepa i ima predobar glas.
Onog momenta kad sam je video na netu znao sam da ce postati velika zvezda.

Pozdrav za sve Bugare i Bugarke"
