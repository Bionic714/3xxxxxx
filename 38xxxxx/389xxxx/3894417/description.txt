In a fantasy land where rival kingdoms are at war, you lead your units into battle and on to victory. In Campaign mode, you are young King Larf Nalavale. During your coronation, a rival tribe attacks. As you lead battles against them, you will learn why. Other game modes allow you to skip the story and get right into the action. You control several types of units, including infantry, archers, and mages. The most important units are the Commanders, who are the only units who can construct buildings, equip new weapons and items, and replenish other units. The core of most strategies in Hundred Swords is to use your Commanders effectively while keeping them well protected.
