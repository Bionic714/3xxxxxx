But then I read a comparison with the original Japanese version - holy shit, they fucking gimped the english one: a LOT of items removed, NO DECISION PATHS, etc. From a decent RPG to a barely-enjoyable RTS because the story got hacked apart. God DAMN.

Wish someone would do a real [ENG] patch for the JP version :( Screw you, Sega."
