,freebrd,2007-11-14T03:38Z,"Won't it ask you to active like all adode stuff?
How do you get around that?"
,OverNight,2007-11-14T10:37Z,Is it English only? Thanks.
,flightsimFS9,2007-11-14T14:56Z,"When is the Swedish Verision released?, Anyone who knows?"
[T],passionettez,2007-11-14T17:19Z,This does not ask for activation.  It is just a serial number.  
[T],passionettez,2007-11-14T17:20Z,"As far as I know, it is just english.  "
,Cammys94,2007-11-17T18:46Z,What is the serial number?
,newlife2,2007-11-18T20:08Z,Oh -Oh - be careful ! There seems to be a KEYLOGGER hidden somewhere in this torrent
,sleeptalker,2007-11-30T04:57Z,"Svensk version
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3914622"
,BRAZILINDIA,2007-12-11T16:41Z,keygen might work BUT you STILL have to activate the product within 30 days. thats what people need. the activation codes not just a serial number
[T],passionettez,2007-12-18T21:05Z,all you need for this is the serial number.  
,harrisona303,2008-01-11T21:49Z,WHAT IS THE SERIAL #?!
,klinker,2008-01-31T21:19Z,is there a keylogger in this torrent??
,IIIlllIII,2008-02-20T18:32Z,"There is a trojan (keylogger) hidden in the keygen, but the program and all of its files are clean. it is safe to download this torrent, just delete the keygen and DO NOT run it. i heard there is another keygen you can download that doesnt contain the trojan. i will post a link when i find it so check back soon."
[T],passionettez,2008-02-22T18:40Z,"it only needs a serial number.  

here are a few  

1057-1084-4327-3405-7559-4335
1057-1087-1751-5187-7621-4399
1057-1089-2774-9676-3991-6745
1057-1081-4050-7119-2713-9760"
,vslink,2008-02-24T22:14Z,"passionettez, i am sorry, brazilindia is right--this program requires internet or phone activation to extend after the 30-day period. It is for real too--I inactivated the software by playing with the date on my computer to see what would happen.

i attempted internet activation--probably unwise--and there is a phone activation option too.

It seems to get this thing running for good you need a serial and if you choose phone activation an activation code too.

passionettez, if you have managed to get things running permanently just with one of the serials you posted, congratulations, but I for one would like to know your secret :)"
,vslink,2008-02-24T22:33Z,"perhaps I should confess that I used one of the serials provided by passionettez with the official trial download straight from the adobe site. Software did work, until I tried the date shift experiment, but kept asking for activation and warned of the 30 day grace period.

Is the version of PsE 6 in this torrent somehow different from the official trial download and doesn't ask for activation? I will download the whole torrent and let you know. BrazilIndia, which version are you working with?

Also, I can't seem to find any trojan in the keymaker. Is it hard to find, or is my security software out of date?"
,vslink,2008-02-25T00:00Z,"brazilindia, passionettez is correct.

if you install the software from of full download of this torrent, the serial for either the keygen or the list passionettez has provided is all that is needed.

it seems that the trial version downloading from the Adobe site is version 6, but is a later build requiring not only a serial but activation as well.

using the keygen or one of the serials provided by passionettez with most recent Adobe trial download will not completely unlock the software and it will expire in 30days without activation.

To get a permanently activated copy of the software you need to download the full torrent, not just the keygen, and install from these files. The copy passionettez is sharing does NOT require a second activation step after entering the serial.

passionettez, I am sorry to doubt you!

Finally, if there is trojan in this keygen, I am damned if I can find it. Any tips?"
,andyness,2008-02-25T19:56Z,"Yes, a tip:

The keygen is not a trojan. This torrent is clean. The reason that some sheephead says that, is because their antivirus programs says so. So use the fucking website called GOOGLE and find out that some programs says that keygens is trojans. But so far I haven't found any keygens which is trojans, just my crap Norton says so.

So stop whining. This torrent is clean, end of story.

(ps sheephead, sarcasm? No.)

=)"
,vslink,2008-02-25T23:09Z,"andyness, thank you for the reassurance!

as for brazilindia's initial issue, I did a little experiment, installing the most recent Adobe trial download on another machine. According to the splash screen the build is dated sometime in October 2007. The version in this torrent is dated a few weeks earlier, in September.

So it looks like in those few short weeks Adobe incorporated the second activation step, at least in the official trial download. That step is not required in the version shared by passionettez. Indeed, I do get the registration request screen, but it is easy enough to select ""do not register"". With the official trial download, you are confronted with the warning to activate in 30 days, even if the serial is good.

So thank you passionettez for sharing this version. I can attest that if you download the full torrent and follow the simple instructions, the software will work cleanly and permanently, at least on XP."

[T],passionettez,2008-07-12T09:08Z,Well I have Vista and all I do is install it and put the serial number in...not sure why it is messing up...:(  it works fine for me and a my friends..
,jdoog1234,2008-08-03T04:45Z,"This torrent works perfectly. Just put all the included files into a file in the program files section of your computer, then run the setup.exe included and install it to the default file (on most computers this will be C:\program files\adobe\photoshop elements 6.0) and then restart your computer. Once your computer has rebooted just go back to the file that you created with all the files from this torrent and run the keygen. Copy the serial, run PSE6 and paste the serial. then press next and it should work :) it did for me:) no viruses either. Please trust me I am telling the truth. Just do as I have just instructed and everything should work"
,jdoog1234,2008-08-03T04:52Z,I'm sorry I forgot to thank you for the torrent in my last post. So thank you passionettez.
,ToothFairy007,2008-08-10T09:26Z,Is it safe to update this? Or is that a stupid question? Because an update window popped up after i downloaded this. I'm not sure if that was part of the download process.
