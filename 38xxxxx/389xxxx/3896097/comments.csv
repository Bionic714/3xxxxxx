,djcycosis,2007-11-29T01:58Z,Hey FiNsTeRc i was wondering why sometimes you would rip mp3s in Xing and Fhg or a combination of codecs. I noticed that you ripped the J.Lo album with Xing (old) and it really ruined the quality of it despite being at 320kbps. I listened to a smaller rip with LAME 3.97 and it sounded way better. So I'm also wondering why you rip with LAME?
