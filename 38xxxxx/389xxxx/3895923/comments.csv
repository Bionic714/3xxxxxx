No everyone likes mp3. mp3 actually kinda sucks. I think it only got popular because it rhymes with its self.

To everyone else: 
You use Monkey's Audio to decompress these files into full CD's. Monkey's Audio only works natively on Windows. Linux and Mac users: Wine. Intel-Mac users: there are like 4 ways to install Windows. Bootcamp, Paralells, VMWare Fusion, and one other i never remember. 

If you have to be told to use google.com, you should take a time-out from this site.
