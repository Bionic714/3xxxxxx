WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 14, 2007 12:20 AM (MT) Under the guise of the census, the government can ask you deeply personal questions. And if you refuse to answer them, they can fine you or send you to jail. In answer to outraged citizens, they say they don't actually prosecute-- but they can. Find out what happened to the census-- it's nothing like the constitution required. It doesn't even happen every 10 years anymore. And find out what you can do about it. Then hear about even more government intrusion into parents rights tonight at 10 ET / 7 PT.
