,tylerdm,2007-11-15T02:54Z,"Somebody, please upload the dvd for people in North America. But thank you for this, it will help the wait. "
,Beren_Erchamion,2007-11-15T18:22Z,Here : http://www.smartorrent.com/?page=torrentinfo&tid=56644
,Beren_Erchamion,2007-11-16T13:43Z,And the movie and the bonus are here : http://www.smartorrent.com/?page=torrentinfo&tid=56721
,willem1978,2007-11-16T13:48Z,Does anybody has another link to download the movie? The french one doesn't work...
,Beren_Erchamion,2007-11-16T16:41Z,"You need to use the second one. But, you need to register on Smartorrent (""s'inscrire"" in french) to download the torrent."
,wheresmybeaver,2007-11-20T20:26Z,"That copy of Heima on smarttorrent is no good: the audio volume is way too high and keeps clipping (unfixable). Completely unusable as a result.  Also, anything spoken that is not in English only has French subtitles. Will have to wait."
,Beren_Erchamion,2007-11-22T15:27Z,"I'm the uploader on Smartorrent. I'm really sorry about the sound (I'm on Mac and QuickTime read perfectly the files, with Perian codecs, without any sound problem).

I will re-encode it (h264 + AAC) and I'll re-upload it, but I can do that before January, because I'm on trip for my job until end of December.

I will post it on Pirate Bay.

If someone can upload before, it will be appreciable.

Again, I'm really sorry about the sound. I hope I can fix it sooner...

And, I will put all subtitles, but only French srt will be manually corrected (I can't correct a langage I don't know !).

My apologize again..."
,wheresmybeaver,2007-11-25T02:02Z,cheers beren! actually I might just buy this.... SHOCK!! So hopefully I can upload a version before xmas
,Ruban,2007-11-30T20:48Z,"The torrent on smarttorrent was deleted, but luckily I managed to download it, and I've got no sound problems whatsoever. I'm using VLC Media Player
.Anyhow, is there ANY other version available, with English subtitles?"
,SigurRosar,2008-01-28T08:39Z,"mordow: they are talking about the film, are you? the music is not availible as mp3 or cd, so sharing it here is an absolutely brilliant idea."
,SigurRosar,2008-01-28T08:43Z,"btw, sorry for naming one track wrong. The one I called ""páll í husafelli"" is in fact called ""surtshellir"". (páll is the guy who built the marimba)"
