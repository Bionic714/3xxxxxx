Director Mohsen Makhmalbaf placed an ad in a Tehran newspaper, inviting people to audition for his latest project, and thousands of people heeded his call. Makhmalbaf then proceeded to film the \\\"auditions\\\" of dozens of these hopefuls, many of whom are convinced that they bear an uncanny resemblance to Paul Newman or Marilyn Monroe, or that their obvious abundance of talent will soon have them jetting off to Cannes. These supposed \\\"screen tests\\\" are the stuff of Makhmalbaf\\\'s frequently edgy film, with the director often badgering, hectoring and provoking his aspiring actors, insisting that they cry on demand or leave, asking them to sing a song or mime a melodramatic death, or simply getting them to talk about their lives. The results are sometimes charming, sometimes cruel, but always absolutely fascinating.
