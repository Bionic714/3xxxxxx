,Zetoss,2007-11-20T17:41Z,"Seems a lot of ""ooh I looove CS and FarCry"" mainstream FPS loosers are complaining about this game. Let me explain something for you very clearly:

THIS GAME IS FOR GORE-FREAKS. NOBODY ELSE WILL LIKE IT. EVER.

Translation: It's all about the gore, fuck the story, fuck the gameplay, fuck everything except the gore. Even on my shitty computer this game is awesome, I'm SO buying this as soon as I can afford it!

You guys with technical issues, try the patch or something."
