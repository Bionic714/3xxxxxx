How can a movie like Backwoods be described? Two parts Jackass, one part The Collective, and a whole lot of Dazed and Confused comes to mind. Backwoods is four years of the most insane footage to ever grace the indie market. Bridge jumping, downhill and freeride mountain biking, amateur boxing and fights, playing with fire and explosives... what more could you want.
This fall, Backwoods will wash up on the internet like medical waste on the shore downstream from Hanford.
