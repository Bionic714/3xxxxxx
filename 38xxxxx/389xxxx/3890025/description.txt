Luis Llosa directs this explosive action vehicle shot on location in Miami. An ex-CIA munitions expert known as \"The Specialist\" (Sylvester Stallone) meets a determined beauty (Sharon Stone) seeking revenge against the mob family (Rod Steiger, Eric Roberts) who killed her parents. When the two join forces, it\'s twice the TNT. The (literally) steamy Stallone/Stone shower scene is a classic of 1990s cinematic erotica.
