Tales from Shakespeare was an English children's book written by Charles Lamb with his sister Mary Lamb in 1807. It was illustrated by Arthur Rackham in 1899 and 1909.

The book reduced the archaic English and complicated storyline of Shakespeare to a simple level that children could read and comprehend. However, as noted in the Author's Preface, "his words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in; and in whatever has been added to give them the regular form of a connected story, diligent care has been taken to select such words as might least interrupt the effect of the beautiful English tongue in which he wrote: therefore, words introduced into our language since his time have been as far as possible avoided."

Mary Lamb was responsible for most of the comedies, perhaps 14 of the 20.

The 20 stories adapted from the selected plays were:

    * 1 - The Tempest
    * 2 - A Midsummer Night's Dream

    * 4 - Much Ado About Nothing

    * 12 - Taming of the Shrew
