It seems foolish to repost existing torrents under my profile, just to make them immediately available to my friends, so look for the links!

The list will be only those that I have successfully installed myself; music and apps.

,neoshaded,2008-05-09T20:04Z,"Thanks to everyone for all the encouragement
I guess I'll have to start putting up more good ones.

As far as the last song being ""cut in two"", that's how the song is on the original album. I believe it's a moment of silence in memory of Chris McCandless"
,nirotem,2008-05-18T12:02Z,one of the best! took me only 5 min's to download! thanks

,Agnus.Dei,2008-08-23T20:14Z,"so disturbing with the song guaranteed, the like 2-2½ min pause with no music before it starts again  .. cause i love that song, have tried all the different   torrents but they all have it :( someone who knows a torrent where it doesn't exist? "
,gansobomb420,2008-09-04T21:48Z,"@Agnus.Dei- Dude, that's how the song is supposed to be!  That's how it was made!"
,grinreaper_CCE,2008-09-05T21:59Z,"freaking brilliant, I already knew in January when I saw the movie that this would be my favorite for at least the year. I haven't proven myself wrong LOL 

Vedder made a brilliant soundtrack for this outstanding movie"
,jdogatl,2008-09-17T23:25Z,Props also to Kaki King
,salamandastron,2008-11-20T20:01Z,"A awesome movie, with an awesome soundtrack!"
,Delron40,2008-12-09T04:38Z,"Thank you neo, Thank you Eddie, thank you Sean, Thank you Mr,.Krakauer, and Thank you Mr. Chambliss for living the life many of us taunt, but let go of in the end."
,erasmusinwv2008,2009-01-01T07:46Z,"The music is good, but as an avid outdoorsy type McCandless (sp?) was a moron to go into the woods unprepared.  Even when I first read about him in Outside magazine in the early 1990s my first thought was what a shame, second thought: what a moron!  And the movie just tried to make a hero out of his dumb ass."
,PekKe,2009-04-06T22:35Z,"Thx for the rip!

Nothing went wrong with the last track:

[/QUOTE]
On the album the track also features a hidden track of ""Guaranteed"" (Humming Vocal) after about two minutes of silence following the regular version of ""Guaranteed"".
[/UNQUOTE]

Thanks again for this piece of art."
,silencer22,2009-04-29T15:58Z,Great movie... Soundtrack is also superb!
,4ere6ka,2009-05-01T21:51Z,one of the best sountracks of one of the best films i ever watched...
,infernite8907,2009-05-08T02:15Z,"THANKS!

and erasmusinwv2008 if you read the book, you'll find that he was very prepared for the wild. he made no mistakes. and he dies from a mold that grew on the edible seeds he had been harvesting.

chris mccandless has made me rethink my life, but i havent had the balls to change anything....... yet"
,cancerparty,2009-05-25T01:39Z,"Thanks to all the seeders. Beautiful soundtrack.
x"
[T],Valdo_PT,2009-06-04T15:24Z,"For those who want the song Guaranteed, Here is the song with no silence

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4933056

Name of torrent:
""Eddie Vedder - Guaranteed (Edited) No Silence VBR 100%"" 
from the film ""In To The Wild""
The silence is in the original song, it ends and there is a long silence, I edited it took the silence off the song."
