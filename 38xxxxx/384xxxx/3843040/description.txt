Also included is CD Wave, which is a program designed to aid in
CD-Recordable mastering. It was built for splitting WAV files from any
source, like LP, tape or even CD. After recording, you can let CD Wave
automatically calculate split points, or you can manually add and
delete split points. After this, you can write out the tracks as
individual wave files and use any CDR mastering program to write a disc
that has no clicks or pops in between tracks. Also supports 24-bit and
surround audio.

CD Wave can also act as a simple audio recorder and editor, allowing
you to record and playback audio, and cut out parts that you want to
keep.

Since CD Wave can read and write CUE sheets, you can also use it as a
CUE sheet editor for CDRWin.

CD Wave (1.92) can write files in OGG Vorbis format, in FLAC (lossless
compression) audio and in MP3 format (if you have the LAME encoder)
directly.
