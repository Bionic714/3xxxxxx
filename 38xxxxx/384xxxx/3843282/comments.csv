,Valar_Morghulis,2007-12-22T19:01Z,"Ive Downloaded, burned using Nero 7, and installed and this torrent works exceptionally well. After burning the disks you do not have to mount the iso and you can use the disk that was burnt for gameplay.
To correctly burn:
1. Install Nero 7
2. Make sure you have a blank CD and that your disk drive is capable of writing to the disk
3. Open Nero Express. Click on the Image, Project, Copy on the left and then select the Disc Image or Saved Project option
4. Navigate to the Morrowind.iso file that you downloaded and select Open. The current recorder should be set to the Disk Drive with the blank CD in it and then all you have to do is press Burn and wait for it to finish. Do this with separate Blank CDs for each of the iso files.

After Burning to disk, install them in this order:
1. Morrowind
2. Tribunal
3. Bloodmoon"
,NeroTormento,2007-12-30T12:15Z,Is this the american or the european edition?

,iain88,2008-02-20T15:44Z,Yup. This is without a doubt the most bugged game I've ever downloaded. All I see here is questions and no suitable answers. I wanted to find a solution and share it but couldn't. We're supposed to help each other people! That's what this site is all about. I've tried every patch and crack I can find and still get CTDs or an unworkable execition. GRRRR. C'mon you tech buffs and say something. For shame!
,pirateman187,2008-02-23T08:55Z,"Thanks! works great! no need for cracks just mount .iso files with daemon tools and then install in this order

1.morrowind
2.tribunal
3.bloodmoon"
,pirateman187,2008-02-23T08:58Z,and you need to mount morrowind .iso everytime you start the game with daemon!
,iain88,2008-02-24T06:36Z,You're lucky pirateman. I also tried this approach and had already installed in the correct order. The game remains fatally bugged. I have always got these things working in the past and have tried everything I can think of. Maybe works better on different hardware. I've never failed in the past though so it's driving me mad! Please help!
,_AKUMA_,2008-02-27T08:48Z,"@iain88:  for your info, this game was always a buggy game, even after all the patches.  It's because of the game engine they used.  Go to Bethesda's site and you can find all kinds of shit there that tell you what can be done for certain errors, or to make them less frequent.  Save often (like every 10 minutes) or else you may find yourself wishing you had.  The fact that this is probably a RE-RIP and not the original scene releases probably just adds more errors to the mess, since too many n00bs don't know how to rip theirselves out of a wet paper bag anyway."
,BloodSuckingLeech,2008-03-04T00:41Z,"I did what pirateman says and it works. It CTDs randomly though every now and then. I downloaded the patches for Tribunal and Bloodmoon, and the game works so I guess they're fine to use.

Any ideas about the crashing?"
,BloodSuckingLeech,2008-03-05T10:29Z,"Nevermind. I've been playing the game for a few days and it works near more or less perfectly. Played it for hours with no crashing, frame rates were great, graphics goods, no bugs etc."
,pirateman187,2008-03-06T21:32Z,i have played at least 24h and only 1 crash:) 
,pirateman187,2008-03-06T21:35Z,"tribunal,bloodmoon&construction set also works nicely"
,gnomesgnomes,2008-03-06T22:57Z,"Gamespot and other current video game stores always have this title. And it seems like a century since I last had the time to play it for the original xbox. Though I never bought because of all the newer releases that having piled on top of the 360, I am grateful that someone has uploaded it up on this site!
Downloading it now. Thank you for seeding."
,Sasquatch99,2008-03-07T09:07Z,I'm just learning how to use torrents at the moment but could someone tell me how to mount files?
,BloodSuckingLeech,2008-03-10T00:15Z,"Sasquatch99,
1. Download the files, there should be four.
2. Download and install ""DAEMON Tools Lite"" from here: ""http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5""
3. Run Daemon Tools Lite and a little red icon should appear. Right click it, go to vitrual cd, device 0, mount image, then select morrowind iso.
4. Now morrowind should pop up with ""runmorrowind.exe"" and you can now install.
5. After installing morrowind, then mount and install the other files in the order listed above.
6. Everytime you play morrowind, you must mount the morrowind iso file."

,Esichs,2008-08-02T20:54Z,"Oki Doki. Considering I'm a noob to .iso files, this took me awhile to figure out...but I did [with absolutely no thanks to the two who decided bitching about noobs would be fun]. I have noticed that a fuller explanation is needed. I'm here to provide it. So, here is all is, provided in easy steps that is not a wall of text

1: Down load the torrent. I use Utorrent [utorrent.com] So I really don't know what to tell those of you who are getting down load errors...I'm sorry

2:Open the torrent and extracts it's contents using either winRAR or 7-zip both of which you can easily get free by Googling their name.

3: This is the tricky step for most of you, as its the one you have been asking the most about...the infamous .iso file. Okay, most of you are going to kick your self for this. When you open the torrent and extract folders, don't go poking around in the four folder. Those four folders ARE the .iso files. Make sure you move them all to a place that is easily found, such as your desktop

4: Okay, you will need DAEMONs Tools or a similar emulator program for this to work. If you do not have one, then you WILL NOT be able to mount the files. DAEMONs Tools can be found in a Light version easly through google. Once oyu down load it you will get a red tab of a ""lightning strike"" at the bottom right cornor of your screen, same place where the clock is.
 A] Right click the icon
 B] left click ""Virtual CD/DVD Rom""
 C] Left click ""Device :O [E:]""
 D] Left click on the Morrowind folder to mount it

5: From there it will install like a normal CD ROM. When it asks to uninstall after the full installation, just hit cancel.

6: You will need to repeat steps 4 and 5 for both the expansion packs and the Editor program.

I'm not much for trouble shooting...but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say most of you are using Vista? If thats the case, that may be the cause of most, if not all of your problems. Morrowind was meant to be run on Windows 98/2OOO/ME/XP SO it may be just barley too old to run. I'm running XP, so it runs beautifully on my computer.

Any ways. I hoped this helped most of you who are not sure what the .iso files were and how to install them."

The game isn't finished, and Nero has probably associated all kinds of disc images like the .ISO files of this game, so it doesn't matter if the game is finished downloading or not, so just rightclick on the game in the download list and select ""Resume"" or ""Continue"", should be something like that availble.

This is the best alternative for those who are unable to run Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. In my opinion though this game is right up beside it.

For those having problems I recommend using a Virtual Drive and just keeping the ISO mounted rather than using cracks. Cracks are easy to find but alot are just simply dumb ones that don't do the trick."

,Anthony817,2009-03-15T06:55Z,"How to fix the Error ""Failed to load snowflake: Meshes\BM_Snow01.nif""

To fix this you need to install the games manually

First to solve the Failed to load snowflake: Meshes\BM_Snow01.nif. Insert the Bloodmoon expansion CD into your CD/DVD drive next navigate to
C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\Data Files\Meshes and leave that window open. Next (make sure the Bloodmoon CD is in your drive) go to Computer and right click (D:/) Bloodmoon and click explore then go to the Datafiles folder on the CD. You should notice other sub folders called
BookArt
Icons
Meshes
Textures
First go to Meshes on the CD and copy EVERYTHING into the Meshes folder that you already have open (C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\Data Files\Meshes), by clicking and dragging. This should solve the snowflake error.

If you start the game with this done you should notice that instead of the snowflake error you should get a new one. This shows that it?s working and that the game is using the textures that you supplied. So now do the same with every folder in the data files folder on that CD BookArt into the BookArt folder Textures in the Textures folder etc. etc. With that all done try run your game and it should work, finally!

But after a while you should notice more errors. To test this go to the trader in Seyda Neen and an error will appear in the loading of the interior about a missing texture called Netch leather cuirass. This is a texture that was supplied with the Tribunal CD, so more manual copying. Insert the Tribunal CD into your drive, right click explore, go to the data files folder and do the same that you did with the Bloodmoon CD but the only problem is that this time you need to go to the separate sub folders and place them into the separate sub folders on C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\Data Files meshes textures etc. because Bloodmoon already created them. You need to go this because if you just select everything in the Tribunal meshes folder and click and drag into the data files folder on you C:/ drive it will overwrite the existing Bloodmoon files this should then fix all if not most of Vista's missing texture problems."

,Ulkershan,2010-07-26T03:52Z,"Since there are many dazed and confused people, I thought that I'd help out. I just got this to work on my Vista (x64). Step by step instructions in how I installed. Might not help for everyone. Btw i blind bat shitted this but somehow got it to work perfectly. Google works wonders.

1. Download the torrent and use uTorrent, Bittorrent or what ever else to dl the torrent

2. Install some kind of iso manager. Daemon tools is what most people use (it's got spyware on it) but I prefer MagicIso. (http://www.magiciso.com/download.htm)

3. You should have 4 iso files now inside the dl'd folder from the torrent. Now time to mount the iso files. You should move the folder to somewhere easily accessible like your desktop.

4. If you are using deamontools refer to page 5 in comments. If you are using MagicIso, click Virtual CD/DVD-Rom, click J: (or what ever latter is there for you) click Mount and find the Morrowind iso and click on it and click open.

5. Now it should auto run and ask to install Morrowind click yes. If it doesn't auto run, go to my computer double click on the virtual drive and click morrowindautorun.exe then install it.

6. Once you install morrowind it should be an auto install of the construction se. After that is done repeat step 4 to TRIBUNAL (mount it on the virtual drive and install it)

Note: YOU MUST INSTALL IN THIS ORDER: Morrowind=>Tribunal=>Bloodmoon or you will take a dump on your game.

7. Repeat for Bloodmoon iso. Now all your iso's should be installed into your computer. YOU MUST remount the original Morrowind iso back onto your vitual cd drive after installation is complete to actually play the game without a physical disc. Then once you have Morrowind iso mounted back you can just click the Morrowind desktop icon from now on to play. 

Hope that helped that's how mine worked out. Also people on vista you might also want to run compatibility with windows XP and run as administrator to fix any permission issues"

,Mortiferon,2010-08-20T19:08Z,"Works perfectly on Win-7 Ultimate x64 Bit - thank you!!!

BTW, for the clueless, just burn the damn .ISO files onto your cheap CD-R disks (i.e. ImgBurn, NTI Media Maker etc - and if you don't know how, google it and learn something new)... honestly, CD-R's  are less than 25 cents a piece these days so there's absolutely no excuse not to just do this the easy way and burn them - quickly and painlessly.

After you've burned them, install them (ex. Morrowind > Tribunal > Bloodmoon) and play. No CD Key, no hacks, no cracks, no BS!

Disable the shaders in the loader options, and not from the ingame menu. Your graphics card probably doesn't support them, so that also means no MODs with shader requirements. If you have mods, disable them one at a time to check if they are causing the error."

,evan.14,2012-07-03T23:31Z,"I mounted the iso with daemontools and can get past character creation but when i try and pick up the dagger it crashes and says searching for solution to problem. I use Vista home premium. i only installed morrowind, not the expansion packs. Could someone tell me what i'm doing wrong?"
,evan.14,2012-07-05T01:54Z,Update: i've installed tribunal and tried bloodmoon but got the snowflake error on bloodmoon. Uninstalled it and have just morrowind and tribunal. I also installed the construction set. Still the same problem. I can play for five minutes and then it cuts off. Has anyone had a similar problem and if so how did you fix it?
,KShelbrock2,2012-07-11T18:51Z,if you guys are having issues running the game in windows 7 then try changing the compatability settings of the game to run like XP. if that doesnt work you can get a program called windows virtual PC and run an actual windows XP OS through your PC.
,Vietcong44,2012-07-12T15:15Z,Ok i installed morrowind and the two expansions then it said i needed the cd so i got a morrowind crack from the website and overwrited the oringinal .exes but then the luancher just showed morrowind but not the other expansions and when i luanched the game it said TR_map1 is missing
,Vietcong44,2012-07-13T02:56Z,"ok the last problem i had was fixed but i got a new problem, everytime i enable bloodmoon or a mod that requires it the game crashes when i start the game"
,masonlam,2012-07-19T06:26Z,@Uzay2000  if you use winrar they will show up as winrar files but are actually the .iso's
,AbUTTW3ASLE,2012-07-23T09:15Z,"The [best?] way to install this with no errors is to...

Install Morrowind and TES:CS
   -Execute game
Install Tribunal alone
   -Execute game
Install Bloodmoon
   -Execute game

Do not install all at once. Remember to execute between installations.
This worked well for me on Win7, hope this'll help others having issues. :)"
,spopes232,2012-08-02T22:54Z,"Well, I'm having what I think is a unique problem. The installer for Morrowind gets stuck at 0%. Not sure if there's any way anyone can help, just reporting the error. "
,Molestat,2012-08-15T15:33Z,"@spopes232
Make sure u have mounted the construction set before you start installing."
,xXAstrixxXx,2012-08-16T06:11Z,"Torrent works great, and it is still pretty fast. 

Thank you very much!"
,xXAstrixxXx,2012-08-16T17:42Z,"By the way, it appears as though Morrowind with all of the expansions installed only works if you run as an admin (for me, anyway). I have looked at the different instructions on previous pages on how to prevent texture errors and the like, however, even with those fixed, the game doesn't seem to recognize Bloodmoon or Tribunal. 

But it all works fine if you run as admin, so no complaints. :)

Thanks again! Wonderful work!"
