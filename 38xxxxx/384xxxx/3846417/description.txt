For its 5th opus, Create invites us in a 창??창??entre deux창??창??. A skilful mixture 
between the cosmic vapors of Biospherical Imagery and the 
fierceness of Kindred Spirits. Not that Space Time Continuum has a 
violent temperament. It sails between random and the minimalism 
with melancholic exhalations.

The title track reveals a very spacey cosmic intro where a voice 
announces with regret, nothing can be done, or change. The tonality 
is equal to what the waltzing images of 2001 A Space Odyssey 
induced; a kind cosmico-dramatic fusion on calm, but arid, ethereal. 
The slow orchestral movements sail on a gloomy sea. Follows, a 
beautiful line with ascending reflections which cascades with softness, 
maintaining this chimerical vision of a space drama. The rhythm is soft 
and move slowly in spiral, like an abstract voyage in a synthesize 
sinuosity. A bit as Phaedra, a beautiful ghostly flute floods the 
emptiness. This opens a passage to heavy percussions, with hasten 
beats, moulding finely to a minimalism carrousel which filters its melody 
through synths with piercing and etching solos.
Ghost in the Machine offers an atonic and spacey opening, to sound 
effects with twisty and eclectic vocal breaths, as a crumpling of 
emotions. The movement settles with slowness, as if we look at an 
interstellar ballet where the gravitational movements are of a poetic 
tangibility. Light percussions install a sober rhythmic march, dress by 
beautiful languorous solos and short mislaid melodies to livid colors.
The crystalline flutes of Cryogenics start a parallel structure to Ghost 
in the Machine. Tasty the intro permutes in a nervous and 
hiccoughing sequence about the 5th minute mark. The world of 
Create becomes more agitate and offers a dense and animate 
musical coloring. Mellotrons are dancing on haphazard sequences, but 
structured on a steady rhythm, offering the best ingredients of a 
corrosive and mocking Create. 
Footprints in the Sand starts quietly; amber-colored and fluty Mellotron 
which sails between the worlds of TD, Phaedra style, and Air Sculpture 
before offering an intense and insistent sequential movement. The 
sonorous impulsion is slow, but rushes by heavy spiral sequencer 
which progresses on increasingly dense and rhythmic cylindrical 
tangents layers. An impressive musical journey which circulates 
through superb corridors, to ghostly and orchestral synths. The 
comparison with the nebulas waves of TD, at the time of Phaedra and 
Force Majeur, is impossible to circumvent. By far, the best part on 
STC. 
It is all with carefully that Fading Lights grow Brighter finishes Create 
5th opus of. Strongly atmospheric, nebulosity of sphere of influences 
is heavy and is heartfelt on a space march on dubious tempos. 

After each Create album, we are amaze to mention it has to be his 
best. As if Stephen Humphries controls the art to mark-down and 
innovate. In fact, the English synthesist is unaware of the rules of 
membership, in order to have a better modelling of him with the 
progressive passion that dictates him his approach. 
A more contemporary writing where his emotions are etch with heart, 
sense and heat. Space Time Continuum is a sublime cosmic voyage 
on nervous and arrogant sequencers, an element which follows Create 
to each creation.
