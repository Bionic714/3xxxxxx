Lucy (Dianne Wiest) moves with her sons Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) to California where Michael gets mixed up with local teenage gang, headed by David (Kiefer Sutherland), that is actually a group of vampires.

"The Lost Boys" is an entertaining modern vampire movie with lots of flash, style, 1980's music, and flamboyant effects and interesting design. There's no substance to this picture, but I don't think that the film-makers cared about that. No, they just made a picture strictly catered to the young crowd that is really just for straightforward fun. Don't worry about looking for hidden meanings or symbolism.

David and his gang are a cool-looking bunch with two members (Brooke McCarter, Billy Wirth) who look like they could have been part of a rock group and the third guy is played by Alex Winter - a.k.a. "Bill" of "Bill & Ted".

The young cast is okay; I would only have real criticisms for Jami Gertz's 'performance'. Wiest, as usual, is excellent, and seasoned performer Edward Herrmann kind of looks out of place but he makes up for it with a typically good performance.

Echo and the Bunnymen do a good cover of the Doors' "People Are Strange" and Roger Daltrey does an equally fine cover of Elton Johns' "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me".

"The Lost Boys" is fun if never truly scary.
