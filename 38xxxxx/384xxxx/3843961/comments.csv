,xaeromancer,2008-08-02T17:55Z,"uh, where is Tour de France Soundtracks?

and btw, the original Tour de France is not from 1999, that's the remastered version. It originally came out in 1983. and alot of other tour de france versions are missing. so not really complete."
[T],MrLore,2008-12-08T01:11Z,"No tags on the tracks, drove me mad fixing them"
,pedroalt,2009-01-20T04:48Z,Think its good seeded Kraftwerk coz of many vinyl-covers (images) + rare tracks + everybody who wonna  have id tags hase 2 use some well known tool(s) - thats normal. coz conzumation isnt piracy :-)
,Smut_Pile,2009-01-27T12:02Z,"Oh man, thank you so much for the upload & to those who have been seeding. I just got into Kraftwork & this will really help me decide which albums I am going to buy. (probably a lot of them) I'm getting an incredible 300/kbs down & 100/kbs up so I'll be seeding within the hour & I'll do so for a while.."
,wontgetfooledagain1,2009-02-16T08:03Z,"Thanks for uploading!
Are these the English releases, or the German ones?"
,OOHMATRON,2009-05-08T21:20Z,"READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT TORRENT MUSIC QUALITY!...

1. Download '.torrent' file only - dont download files. (Example - in uTorrent you will see list of files before you start download)

2. Check MB sizes of the song files.

3 Look up the song/album in discogs

4 Compare song length in discogs to torrent MB file size.

5. If for example discogs says song is 4 minutes and in the torrent list the song is 4MB, then the quality will most likely be 128 kbps. I would avoid this unless it was a rare album or one I didn't care about too much.

6. So basically 128kbps is about 1 MB per minute.

7. IMO, for decent quality the song file should be at least 1.5 MB per minute - so around 6MB for a 4 minute song. Off the top of my head this should be around 192kbps!

Ideally The Pirate Bay would allow you to view the torrent files from this page like other sites do.

I worked this out myself, so can you if you become more inquisitive and don't rely on other people for solutions to problems. ;)"
,snowbirds,2009-06-20T06:36Z,"when you download this entire discography, the songs don't have tags, so when you import them into your media player library, everything shows up as unknown album/unknown artist.  You will have to sort through hundreds of songs trying to catagorise everything correctly.  better to download individual albums with tags, IMO."
,okto,2009-07-15T00:36Z,"Reasons this is a shite torrent:

1. No tags.  None at all.
2. Incomplete discog.  Many things are missing.
3. Shite artwork.  Crooked scans, missing art, front/back cover as single file.

Total amateur comp, Stipendius.  Let's see a little more rigor next time, shall we?

(will be uploading a complete, tagged discog soonish)"

,Kapcha,2009-12-20T15:26Z,"Hey ppl, please just seed it, its impossible to have 4,0 kb/s speed for such torrent! just seed it! please! ((("
,Kapcha,2009-12-23T23:18Z,"so. its 192 kbit/s, 15 Albums German+English version. I thing its worth downloading. Will seed. "
,FluffigtDjur,2010-09-25T14:36Z,"Why the hell did you include Organisation - Tone Float but not Red Cone (Kraftwerk - self titled), the actual first Kraftwerk album? No offense, thanks for sharing, but don't call something a ""complete discography"" when it's no such thing."
,deb66,2010-09-29T04:35Z,Cheers m8.
,snowbirds,2011-06-20T05:24Z,Mislabeled:  definitely NOT complete. 
,thefrag,2011-06-22T16:21Z,"seems legit..

,Xandror,2012-03-06T00:28Z,"I'm pretty sure Kraftwerk 2 wasn't their first album, but nice try =)."
