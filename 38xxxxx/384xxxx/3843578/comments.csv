,o_motors,2008-01-17T18:48Z,"So what if it sells for $40.00? It's definitely great to have on computer in .pdf format so you can search through by typing particular terms, with ease. Try finding where in the heavy 1,400 pages hardcover book there are some information about let?s say Teheran Conference,  Rothschilds, Yugoslavia or similar historical moment and you?ll quickly realize the value of having this great book in electronic format! 

Undeceived, thanks for posting this great torrent! "
,UncleUnko,2008-03-27T01:12Z,"Well if this is the 1st edition then it's VERY worth having in any format!!!   If it 2nd edition or later then all the good parts have been edited out.  There's something like 200 pages difference between ed1 and ed2 - meaning 200 pages or so are missing from the second edition and later.

,frnnk,2008-12-11T02:51Z,"ok. lenninist stalinist, enough of your socialist propoganda. the real culprit is... guess what? the white man. obviously. i mean... OBVIOUS, ANYONE?

not the jews, not the capitalist, not religion, bbut whites. everyone else funcitons just properly given enough of the proper elements of our earth. blacks would live just fine, had they never met the filthy portuguese. we would have defeated the arabs, pushed them out of our continent, and formed a peaceful, indestructible continent wide superstructure within 200 years, maybe less. of that, it's a fact. if you don't believe me, read a boook why don't you. start off with ""the fate of africa"""
,tfotis,2009-02-26T01:06Z,thank you:)
,neuralzen,2009-03-02T02:34Z,"Thank you! The 1st edition is stupid expensive, and contains significant parts that were edited out of later editions. Parts that powerful people want quiet. Anyway, thanks!"
,You Rock!,2009-10-07T00:20Z,I've not heard of the author nor the book (I'm sadly out of touch) but the talk on this site tweeked my interest. Thanks folks! I too will Seed!!!
