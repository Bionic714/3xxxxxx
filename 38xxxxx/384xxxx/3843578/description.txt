Want to know how the world really works behind the scenes?  Want to read true world history the way it is never taught in schools and universities (except for the select elite)? Well Professor Quigley was on the \"inside\" and taught the future elite leaders in Georgetown University for a generation.  He was obscure to the public until 1992 when Bill Clinton paid fond tribute to him in his nomination acceptance speech.  Quigley then, 15 years after his death, became instantly world famous, and his brilliant works, especially this one, always intended to be largely secret and in low circulation, began to be scrutinized by people everywhere. The result? Shock, after the realization we\'ve been lied to all our lives, the New World Order is real and this book besides being a fascinating historical work in itself, helps connect those dots like no other. It is not speculative but authoritative.  That is why this book typically sells for $80 to over $1000 in Amazon, depending on the edition. It\'s a deeply scholarly historical work written in a powerful compelling style, and relevant.

Carroll Quigley, Georgetown University history professor (deceased), in Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time, 1966, made this claim: 

\"There does exist and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for 20 years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret record.

\"In addition to these pragmatic goals, the powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world\'s central banks which were themselves private corporations. The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups.\'\'
