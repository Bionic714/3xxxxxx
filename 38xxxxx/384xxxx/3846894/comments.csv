Then i download this torrent and  it works with blu-ray from the hard drive. thank you for the upload

The playing of Blu-ray from the harddrive  feature has been discontinued in 3319f version and above of power dvd"
,SpankyPants,2008-01-29T02:39Z,"This seems to be version 7.3.3304.0

Take a look in system information to see for your self.

C:\Windows\System32\msinfo32.exe

Look under Software Environment > Running Tasks > powerdvd.exe

(you should have PowerDVD running when you do this)

EverestUltimate will also give you the same info.

Other than this, the prog seems to work fine, and the skins are cool too."

,bechapes,2008-04-11T09:26Z,"The install went great on Vista, but Bluray discs that I have ripped to bring with laptop that doesn't have Blueray drive crashes CyberLink rather quickly.  Normal DVDs on hard drive play just fine.  Are others having this issue.  I have a newer version of Cyberlink, but of course my copy doesn't have the ability to play movies on the drive."
,10kingsize,2008-04-19T22:51Z,"SpankyPants  you've let auto update that's why  you see version 7.3.3304.0
I check it myself with EverestUltimate and it is v7.3.3319a"
