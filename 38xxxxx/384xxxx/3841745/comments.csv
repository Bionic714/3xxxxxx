,squire23,2007-10-20T13:58Z,Are the menus on this on English? I know the DVD is PAL but the NORDIC tag is confusing (sorry for such a stupid question)
,Hei_på-deg,2007-10-24T00:51Z,"Nordic means subtitles for all nordic countries.

You'll find english menues and subtitles as well."
,pshycic,2007-10-26T20:15Z,"I have trouble playing this on both my dvd players, but not on the computer why???"
,noseygit,2007-10-28T13:49Z,"try using DVD Shrink then burn that copy to disk, 
it should work fine.

or... get a better DVD player "
,LordExide,2007-10-29T10:20Z,vivic: It depends on wich DVD-player you have and wich files the player can play. My DVD-player can play iso-files and I hope this is an iso-file..
