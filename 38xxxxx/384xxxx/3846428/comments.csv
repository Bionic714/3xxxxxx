I recently downloaded La Piscine, the picture was great, but it had no sound. Any tips how to solve this? It is only with this particular film that I have a problem, and I  can't wait to see it properly - it is one of favorite films ever and you can't buy it anywhere. Thanks,  Roussanka"

I can only second that. Thanks, sidehacker."
