,TSBAMUSIC,2012-01-14T01:27Z,"The file is big, because it's a full disc. It's also .iso (image file) so if you aren't set up to burn Dual layered discs, you won't be able to burn this. You can only shrink the file for buning if you have the file folders or if you're reading from an already burnt discor an original. Sometimes I wonder why you people get on here when you don't seem to know shit about shit..."
