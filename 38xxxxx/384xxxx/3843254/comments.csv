,ed82264,2007-11-16T10:10Z,"2007-10-15 18:37:46 is when this was uploaded; why are there no seeders - why hasn't there been any finished downloads - why is everyone stuck at 68.6%?????

c'mon man - stay online so someone can finish this download - that's the least you can do. once it's finished once, then that person starts to seed, then the next, and the next, etc....


Get IT!!!!!"
