Notes from Wooda:

QUALITY: An unreleased jem from the Wooda archives. VH did a three night stand June 28th, 29th & 30th, 1976 at the legendary Starwood Club in Hollywood Ca. This is night 2. It has its glitches, but when they recorded these shows, I don't think they had any idea we would all be chomping at the bit for them someday.
