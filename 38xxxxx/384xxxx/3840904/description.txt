"Ronald Miller is tired of being a nerd, and makes a deal with one of the most popular girls in school to help him break into the "cool" clic. He offers her a thousand dollars to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. It succeeds, but he soon learns that the price of popularity may be higher than he expected."

I must have seen this movie a million times as a kid. It's one of those feel good comedies that only the eighties could produce, and although it's not my release I still want to share it with you guys. I will be seeding in about thirty minutes from now.
Enjoy. :)
