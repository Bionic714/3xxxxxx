,raisputin,2007-10-13T23:12Z,This is a great movie and one I have not been able to find anywhere near me (Brick and Mortar shops). Thanks for the UL
,Drexel5,2007-10-14T03:05Z,Is this PAL or NTSC?
,LinguaIgnota,2007-10-14T03:47Z,"Seeing as there's only english subtitles I would think it's NTSC. But I'm honestly not sure. I'll start seeding again in a couple of minutes, BTW."
,admireme,2007-10-14T12:56Z,"This is with 4:3 aspect and not 16:9, right ?"
,LinguaIgnota,2007-10-14T14:20Z,"Yes, it is  4:3."
,hardcandy415,2008-01-19T17:38Z,"Could someone please seed?  I am stuck at 96.4%

Thanks"
