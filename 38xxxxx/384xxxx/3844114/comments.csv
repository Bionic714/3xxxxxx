,firewire1234,2011-07-24T00:52Z,"now, after some years, i download my own torrent, cause i lost the data. i have listened to trentemoller, and i am sure he took some parts from 242. i can tell you - i saw 242 2010 in Stuttgart - they still rock as much as they did in Hamburg - 2000 . or 2001 - i can not remember.
They are and will ever be the most influential electronic band ever.

,firewire1234,2011-07-24T02:11Z,"I have been listening to â€œTomboy - Flamingo (TrentemÃ¸ller Remix)â€ and it really makes me go punk!
I must say, I am now way over 40 years old, but when I hear TrentemÃ¸ller electro shit, I fell like 18 and I want to destroy stuff. 
I do feel a little bit bad, cause I uploaded the 242 stuff here on TPB.
BUT â€“ I only did it, cause I want to spread this amazing music.
People need to know what FRON 242 has done for the modern day music.
Most people have no idea about music.
They think, that â€œThe Rolling Stoneâ€ was a great band.
(most people think, that having a child, will improve there relation ship â€“ reality is, that it will destroy it!)
Modern music is not based on â€œthe Rolling Stonesâ€
By the way, fucking a 15 year old girl is in most countries illegal.
It is all due to them â€“ look at DM â€“ Paul Kalkbrenner â€“ Alex Funk â€“ Ellen Allienâ€“ FC Kahuna â€“ Alex Cortiz â€“ Bioground â€“ Cosmic  Baby â€“ D-Formation â€“ Echomen â€“ Fatboy Slim â€“ Filterheadz â€“ Fluke â€“ Girls Under Glass â€“ Goldfrapp - John Digweed â€“ Leftfield â€“ Massive Attack - and so many others.
Front 242 where the first in electronic music â€“ forget Kraftwerk (amature university drop outs with rich parents and expensive gear). 
Front 242 Where the first real â€œsound engineersâ€ with new and real visions of new music.
The whole modern music industry is based on 242 sound (they don`t even know).
I would have never been pulled into the digital music industry without 242.
And I do apologize to the members of front 242, for putting your magic up here for download â€“ please forgive me.
At the time, my brother was listening to â€œmodern talkingâ€ â€“ compare ?!?
Electronic Music and Front 242 is the difference between eating and dining.
Masters and Slaves

I hope, that this text will not â€œkillâ€ me
Well â€“ FUCK IT
