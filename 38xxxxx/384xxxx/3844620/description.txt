Hi there,
This is my first torrent, so I hope it works properly.
I've seen many of you asking for this, so here it is:
Star wars galactic battlegrounds!
I bought this game myself, and I've tested both the disks and the ISO files.
Everything works.

                     STAR WARS: GALACTIC BATTLEGROUNDS SAGA

The destiny of a galaxy hangs in the balance. You must lead the great armies of the STAR WARS saga in intense real-time strategy clashes across land, sea and air. Execute single or multiplayer battles as you deploy your armies and manage your resources.


Play as eight different civilisations: The Rebellion, the Old Republic, the Trade Federation, the Separatists, the Empire, the Wookies, the Gungans and the royal Naboo.

This game works with every computer that works with Age of Empires II.

I have not included a crack, because no one is needed.
This game is not no-cd, because I don't think it's needed. You can surely find a patch, though.

To play:
1. Mount in DAEMON tools or equivalent, or burn it to a CD.
2. Install.
3. Play.

Note: Some people may have to open the contents of one of the disks (I've forgotten which one, I think it's the install disk) and click the install.exe file in order to play the Clone Campaigns. I don't know why this happens.
 
Contents of SWGB_S.rar:
SWGB_INST.iso - Install disk
SWGB_PLAY.iso - Play disk

I will not be able to seed this 24/7, but I will try as much as I can.
