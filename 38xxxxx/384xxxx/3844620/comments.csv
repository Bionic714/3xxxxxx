,aoe3,2007-10-17T08:52Z,yo limejet why i can't see the troopers etc. i only can see the landscape no building i hope u have a explenation
,LimeJet,2007-10-17T20:40Z,"aoe3,
I'm sorry, but I have absolutely no explanation. It has never happened to me or anyone I know that has played this game. 

I've seen several people on other versions of this torrent complaining about it, but no-one seems to know how to fix it.

I dont know if there is any help on this page, but you can try it:
http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/SWGB"
,LimeJet,2007-10-18T07:25Z,"Update:
I reckon there is a manual on one of the disks, consult that instead of me. As I said, since I've had no problems with this game, I didn't need any support, and thus doesn't know anything:)"
,zooka,2007-10-18T17:07Z,Haha awesome man :D cool that you uploaded it only 2 days ago when me and my friends talked about it. hope it works on vista ! THanks ! 
,LimeJet,2007-10-18T20:49Z,"Ok, I won't be able to seed for about 2 weeks now, but since my ratio on this single torrent is about 40, I reckon you guys should be OK."
,Crillie,2007-10-19T15:59Z,"IF IT DOES NOT START DO THIS:

Go to:

\LucasArts\Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga

Right click on:

swgbg

Set compability to:

Windows 2000

And last but not least, thank you LimeJet!"
,Crillie,2007-10-19T16:01Z,"^
^
Also keep in mind this might solve other errors."
,LimeJet,2007-10-19T16:53Z,"Crille,
Thank you. 
I just wish to point out that my old computer had windows XP, and worked absolutely perfect, but if you're experiencing troubles, you should switch the compability mode to windows 98, because of stability."
,LimeJet,2007-10-19T16:53Z,sorry. Crillie.
,undercom,2007-10-29T18:01Z,"When I start the tutorial after briefing it gives me an Windows OK and Details error :(

,Yodamester,2007-10-30T15:50Z,LimeJet and where is that patch in the battlegrounds.
,Crillie,2007-10-30T19:20Z,"Yodamester is too rude, I will not put answer here. 

Instead I will send a message to undercom who has the same problem."

,shaneasmith,2007-11-04T22:17Z,ok im using power iso can anybody please help me to install this game sori
,Yodamester,2007-11-05T14:26Z,This game can not be istalled.
,LimeJet,2007-11-11T22:13Z,"Yodamester,
This game is ripped by me from a retail version I  bought myself, and tested by me and at least ten close friends, and I have found it to work perfectly on windows 98, XP and Vista. If you cannot actually get it  to work, it is only because of your complete lack of competence to do anything, even spelling master, right.
To all others:
Because I have never had any errors whatsoever, I can not answer your questions. Sorry."
,LimeJet,2007-11-11T22:17Z,"There is no patch needed, and the procedure for starting it up in poweriso should be the same as for daemon tools: Mount, install play."
,Mofsera,2007-11-13T22:40Z,A tip....use daemon tools..........
,Drasyl,2007-11-19T23:31Z,"Errr, I seem to be having the same problem as AwsomeX. It says that an older version had already been installed, but I can't seem to find it... anywhere.

Did anyone ever come up with a solution to that?"
,Jouheen,2007-11-20T19:59Z,worked fine on mine thx.. i used PowerISO not DAEMON tools.. no problems at all :D.. hehe like the game system tools it's like that the makers of this have take all from Age of empires II.. look into the senario editor on SWGB and the senario editor on Age of empires II.. they are like twins :D but great torrent thx a lot LimeJet 
,stateofmind,2007-11-21T23:26Z,I'm having the same trouble as a few others.  When I go to install a message pops up and says that a previous version of swgb needs to be uninstalled before it can install.  I downloaded another torrent before this one which was just the original swgb with a crack so that no cd was needed.  I wonder if the other people who are experiencing this problem did the same thing?
,Drasyl,2007-11-23T21:52Z,"Nope, Stateofmind, this is the first time I've downloaded the game sicne it was referred to me by a friend.

... really, no one here knows how to fix this? No magic patch? I've done some looking around, but most of the sites I've visited didn't have anything for the situation. And when gameburnworld.com can't help you, you know you're screwed."
,stateofmind,2007-11-26T05:42Z,"I haven't tried it yet but this is what lucasarts sent me in response to this question a few of you (including myself) have been having, let me know if it works.

The original Galactic Battleground and the Clone Campaign expansion must be fully uninstalled before you can install the SAGA bundle version of the game. This error likely indicates that you have residual registry entries and/or InstallShield files from the original game still present on your system.

Please try the following:
You will first need to manually delete the game folder from your harddrive if it is still present. If you used the automatic install option and installed the game to the default directory (C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds):

- Open My computer
- Open the C: harddrive/local drive
- Open the Program Files folder
- Open the LucasArts folder
- Right click the "" Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds"" folder and select delete. Select Yes to proceed past the warning that appears. You will also need to delete any other Galactic Battlegrounds folders present here (Clone Campaigns or Saga).

You may also need to manually remove some InstallShield files before attempting to reinstall the game.

- Open the My Computer window, go to VIEW on the menu bar in Windows 9x (go to the TOOLS option in Windows XP/2000), and select Folder Options.
- Select the View tab, and click on the option to ""Show All Files"" in Windows 9x or select the option to ""Show hidden files and folders"" in Windows XP/2000.
- Below this option (for Windows XP/2000) remove the check marks next to the ""Hide extensions for known file types"" option and the ""Hide protected operating system files"" option so these options are turned off. Click Yes on the Warning dialogue box that appears.
- Click OK at the bottom of the Folder Options window.

- Next, open My Computer and open the C drive
- Open the Program Files folder
- Open the InstallShield Installation Information folder
- Right-click any of the following folders present here and choose the delete option:
If you had the original Galactic Battlegrounds installed then delete the following folder:
{A202BDBA-753F-41B9-B649-CFB0B45FC03E}

If you had Galactic Battlegrounds Saga previously installed then delete the following folder:
{10133CDD-50B9-4783-B336-8B48F3653715}

If you had Galactic Battlegrounds Clone Campaigns previously installed then delete the following folder:
{0314ED3D-26A7-4F62-86A2-6B23353445E8}

(Note: Other folders may have similar names, so make sure that you properly identify the correct folder by its exact name before you delete it.)

Finally, you will need to remove any Galactic Battlegrounds registry entries before you can (re)install it. This involves making changes to your system that could be detrimental if not done properly.

- Click the Start button and select Run...
- In the Open window type REGEDIT and click the OK button. This will open the Windows Registry Editor.
- On the menu bar click ""Registry"" and select ""Export Registry File..."" to backup your registry in case you make an error and the registry needs to be restored. Type a name, such as Regbackup and click Save.
- To remove the game's registry entries click the + next to the ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE"" folder on the left-hand side of the Registry Editor window.
- Below this, click the + next to the ""Software"" folder.
- Below this, click the + next to the ""LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC"" folder.
- Below this, right-click any and all folders that have ""Galactic Battlegrounds"" in the folder name and click Delete.
- Then click the minus ""-"" sign next to the ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE"" folder on the left-hand side of the Registry Editor window to close this folder.

- Now click the + next to the ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER"" folder on the left-hand side of the Registry Editor window to close this folder.
- Below this, click the + next to the ""Software"" folder.
- Below this, click the + next to the ""LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC"" folder.
- Below this, right-click any and all folders that have ""Galactic Battlegrou"
,LimeJet,2007-12-05T21:16Z,It's good that you help each other out. I could learn from this as well.
,cloudiance,2007-12-07T14:17Z,I hope someone can help me. My starwars doesnt have any music. It has sound effects and all but there is no music during gameplay. Please someone help me thanks..
,LimeJet,2007-12-10T02:30Z,"cloudiance, what operating system do you use? I just reinstalled this (with my original disks) on my laptop with Vista installed, and I noticed that I didn't have any music. I don't know how to fix this, but if anyone is interested, could you find a solution?
(also, the soundtrack is somewhere on the second disk in CD-audio format, so if you put a burned CD in a non-computer CD-player and select track 2, you will hear it.)"
,LimeJet,2007-12-10T02:34Z,"I just noticed something...
all the other torrents is bigger per disk than mine. hm..."
,cloudiance,2007-12-10T13:59Z,"Thanks for the reply Limejet! I am using Microsoft Windows XP Professional. Well it doesnt really hamper my enjoyment, there's no deying the awesome soundtrack by John Williams. Btw, thanks for the torrent mate!"
,LimeJet,2007-12-10T23:23Z,"well, I'll have to check sometimes ^^"
,Isendel1,2007-12-20T23:57Z,"I had corrupted files after downloading. I hope that I don't get the same error again after this second download. There should be a way to just fix the corrupted pieces and start downloading them without having to download the entire .rar again.

Is there any way to do this?"
,Isendel1,2007-12-22T12:01Z,I finally got the download right. After trying 3 times. I am really happy to have this game again. But it really bugs me that I can't listen to the music while playing. Is there any viable solution to this? Plz answer me.
,Cheh3x,2007-12-27T15:10Z,Hey limejet. thanks for the torrent but I'm getting download speeds of 0.9 to 1.1k. Someone pls seed.
,LimeJet,2008-01-10T16:43Z,"Ok, here's the deal. I've lost my old computer, which means I've also lost the torrent. It feels kinda weird to DL one of my own torrents when I have the disks, so I won't. I'll try to find it on one of my externals, but until then, don't leech!"
,minin29,2008-01-20T17:05Z,Is this a expansion?
,om1,2008-01-25T15:01Z,thanks stateofmind.... couldnt get my copy to install because of the install shield folder your solution works great

,Suxi,2008-03-12T20:37Z,Hey. I got the Torrent to work and it installed without any problem at all. But I don't know how to mount it using Daemon or Alcohol 120% (I don't know which is better). Could anyone help me with this? Thanks.

,LordAlex19,2008-03-14T00:01Z,"Thanks for the download, it works properly. But it won't allow me to build/ create scenario's.
I was wondering in the file that I downloaded, is there something I need to link with main directory which the install part.
If not may I please have the files that let you create them,cause I do not have the disc which it says it needs.
Is there a certain thing I need to do in order to get it working?"
,Suxi,2008-03-14T00:07Z,Where are the .iso files for the drive emulator found? I can't seem to find them after I extract the rar files.
,Toeknee2,2008-03-15T02:00Z,"Made an account just to say

You my friend, are a fucking genius "
,LimeJet,2008-03-15T04:59Z,"Suxi; There is no drive emulator included. Go find one yourself. 
As for LordAlex19: I can't understand what you are trying to say. Could you explain yourself in some other way?"
,Suxi,2008-03-15T14:34Z,I know that the emulator isn't included. I do have one. I just don't know how to get the files needed for it.
,LimeJet,2008-03-20T18:02Z,"Aah, Ok, Now I see your problem, suxi. There are only one .rar file in the torrent, the ones in that one  are .iso files."
,_Sanek,2008-03-24T00:51Z,"Well I found why I can't see units in my game. because these files : STemplet.dat ; graphics.drs ; graphics_x1.drs ; sounds.drs 
should be 40-80MB large or so, but after the full installation, they have the size of 0. So if some one has the same problem chek this files.
Now people could you help me to play this game by sending them to my mail(tahkuct@mail.ru) please.
Thanks."

,Longbow544,2008-05-24T17:24Z,"I remember playing this game, was real fun but mine was f'ed up so it had no sound and I couldnt play as the Royal Naboo (my fav civ). Hopefully this will work. 7% so far in 5 min.

P.S. gmfmaster, gl trying to revive this game. You might want to go advertise this torrent to the AoE community at www.igzones.com Last time I checked, they had 3k members playing on almost 24/7 (not the same ones mind you)."
,Longbow544,2008-05-24T17:33Z,"O, and LimeJet, I have a few games that I want to make into Torrents, mind showing me how?"
,LimeJet,2008-05-25T12:44Z,"Sure, you just compress them or make them into cd-images with a program of your choice, then go into your bittorrent-client and select the folder you wish to upload, go to TPB and select upload and follow the instructions there.
 If I'm not making myself clear here, go ahead and ask for more detail."
,LimeJet,2008-05-25T12:44Z,"Also, happy day of the Jedi ^^"
,Longbow544,2008-05-25T13:07Z,"What about the Bin and Cue Files?

O, and the game worked for me the very first time. Just download the 1.1 (I think) patch and the No-CD patch and everything works fine."
,maverick74ad,2008-05-27T20:20Z,Perfect torrent......Enough said. Thank you Limejet.
,sps01,2008-05-28T16:25Z,"ei guys...uhmm how do i mount the files??dont know how..i've installed the game already, but when i start single player..it still ask for another CD to insert so that i can play the single game mode..what should i do??pls help me!!"
,Mullzor,2008-05-31T19:46Z,"Hey, 

Yeah, I can install it...but it asks for the CD when I need to play it. :P

Well, if the autorun.exe file and/or I have to mount the image, then that would explain it.

So, do I have to Mount with Daemon tools or??

Works sweet besides that...seeding now. :)"
,Mullzor,2008-05-31T21:28Z,"Ok so, this is how to do it (I think, since it worked for me)
1. start Daemon Tools
2.Unpack the files (Play and Install) to a folder on the desktop if you need to.
3. Install the game from the Install folder.
4. Restart ""if"" you have to.
5. Then mount the image.  If you mount Install, it'll work, but not start the game modes, instead mount the ""PLAY"" folder.
6. Create player and have fun...

;)"

,schnurbus,2008-07-03T22:27Z,"hey!
Everything seemed to be working perfectly. A very fast dload and no probs with the installation. However, after about 15 minutes of playing I got and error message from microsoft (you know which one, '..has detected a problem and needs to close.') Anyways, I tried playin' it again some hours later and now the following is what I get all the time (unfortunately it's in german, so I hope my translation is good enough.) 
battlegrounds_x1.exe - error in ""application""(?) 
The command in '0x6cc4ca86' refers to memory in '0x00000066'. The process 'read' could not be performed in the memory. 

I also tried re-installing it, but the problem remains."

I'd suggest mounting it with something like Daemon Tools first though"
,benmrules,2008-08-18T19:57Z,"having a few problems with this...still. this wasn't the first SWGB torrent i downloaded i tried one other first but it was all in Spanish...and didn't work. anyways since it never installed properly there was no way to properly uninstall it other than deleting the files and i think i probably missed some, but anyways my problem:

ok so i've downloaded and installed it, looked to be working fine but when i first tried it normally it went straight to the game's main menu, skipping the intro. all very well but when i tried actually playing a game it gets as far as the black screen transition between the loading screen and the game, and then crashes to desktop. tried running it in compatibility mode (i'm running Vista) for XP, and ME, and 2000, and 98, and 95...basically all possible options on the compatibility front, even clicking those lil check boxes underneath. the lower comp. modes load the game with the intro (omg! i remember that) but still the same problem. whether it's a campaign, scenario edit, standard game etc. it amost gets there and then crashes to desktop. leaves me wishing i still had my discs

any hep here would be hot ^^; ;)"
,benmrules,2008-08-19T23:29Z,"actually not to worry i figured it out eventually. for anyone having the same problem as me try  right-clicking the application and clicking run as administrator. seemed to work for me, i might have been running it in compat. mode for 2000 too but don't think so"
,Ted_Ninja,2008-08-23T13:29Z,"About to DL this. If anyone has any problems with this game it probably could use a good crack/NOCD patch. You can find them on gamecopyworld.com (google ""no cd"" and it should be first) and they usualy have good patches and if they cant host them they link to sites that do. Personaly I prefere to use Power ISO or Alcohol 120% (find it here at the pirate bay with cracks included) over D-Tools."

,walnutboy13,2008-12-27T19:19Z,"@TheNiceNightMare
Do a search on your computer for SWGB_S_LIME.rar, then Google WinRAR and download it. Open the .rar file, extract to a directory (My Documents, Desktop, etc) and find SWGB_INST.iso and SWGB_PLAY.iso. Then Google ImgBurn and download that, and finally use ImgBurn to burn the .iso files to blank CDR's. Finally, install the game, and you need the Play CD in the drive to play."
,mrloller,2008-12-30T03:18Z,"Do we need to burn it to a CD? Can't we just use Daemon Tools, or a similar program, run the install file, and get a nocd crack?

Also, I was wondering how much space installing this will take up, I'm on an older computer and have some space constraints."
,MM2007,2009-01-02T11:15Z,"The torrent works perfectly.  Thanks LimeJet!

To everyone talking about a ""no cd crack"" - YOU DON'T NEED A NO CD CRACK!  Christ.  Just mount the ISO files with Daemon Tools and you're good to go.

If you don't know what Daemon Tools is or how to use it.  GOOGLE it.

@mrloller - It takes up 751MB of space when installed (not including saved games).

Thanks again LimeJet!  Great  torrent."

,Chezzits,2009-06-22T00:07Z,"Yo, if anyone can answer these series of questions i have, God Bless you.

so,#1 - what exactly is this so called ""daemon tools?"" and how exactly does this application help my installation?

#2 - after reading through the comments posted by you all, what does it mean when said ""MOUNT"" 

#3 - Right now i am using U-Torrent to download this torrent file, is that alright or does that Daemon tool download it?

#4 - so im thinking, without experience, that after this download, i use Daemon tools to somehow open up or extract the files. 

#5 - if you care and want to help me and don't want to answer these various questions, then it'll be GREAT if you can just post up some type of procedure or walkthrough in your own words."

,Llurdaen,2009-07-02T19:30Z,"@ Chezzits:

I know this is a very long post, but bear with me It should answer all your questions.

#1 - Here we go. Pretend that you went out and legitimately bought this game like I did not. You would have opened the box to find one or two CD's inside. You put the CD in the tray, and it installs the game for you. If you think of this whole torrent as the box, then you open the box and one or two CD's are inside. Unfortunately, you cannot download a physical CD, so somebody ripped all the data off of the CD in the form of an ISO file. This is just a file like a ZIP or RAR that compresses many files into one, which is then put on the CD you ""bought."" But since you can't put a file in the CD tray, Daemon Tools is software that will let you ""trick"" your computer into thinking that you have a real CD, and it is in a CD tray like it should be. Daemon Tools creates a virtual CD drive into which you can ""mount"" or put the CD image. The computer recognizes this and thinks it is a real CD, when in fact all you have is the ISO image. 

#2 - Once you insert the CD image, which is called ""mounting,"" into the virtual CD drive Daemon Tools created, the normal installation will begin as it would if you had put a real CD into the real CD tray.

#3 ? There are two different things happening here, which you may have gotten mixed up. One, you are downloading the torrent, and Two you are installing the game. For number One, you have to use a special program to download the torrent. There are a ton of them out there, U-Torrent is a good one. Then to install the game, because of the format it?s in (which is an ISO, the ?fake? CD that I talked about in #1) you need a program that will mount it for you. There are also a lot of these out there, probably the most famous one, and cirtainly a very good one is Daemon Tools. 

#4 ? Exactly. Once you finish downloading the torrent with U-Torrent, Daemon Tools will let you open the file, and put it in a virtual CD tray to install it as you would if you had the real CD in your hand. There is one problem though, which doesn?t concern Daemon Tools at all; that is that the entire torrent is compressed into a RAR file. You will need a program called WinRar to extract the ISO CD images before Daemon Tools can see them. (To get WinRar, go to http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm and download the trial version for now. If you want you can search The pirate bay for a full version, but this will work for what you need for this torrent.) 

I know that was a long post, I?m sorry, I hope it helped all those who needed it. Any questions email me at pettygam3r@gmail.com

,Reaper24,2011-05-17T16:23Z,"To fix the music problem, do this:

""There is a way to solve this
1. Donwload The demo version of Age of empires 2
2. Take the midi folder from the sound folder of the demo of age2
3. Put that folder in the sound folder of the full Age of empires 2
4. Create a shortcut of the age2_x1.exe in the age2_x1 folder
5. Click properties and add to the target ""-midimusic"" with quotes
6. Start the game with that shortcut and the game will have background music

PS If you want you can download the demo of the conquerors and take the midi files from the midi folder of the demo. Just remember to rename the midi files from the conquerors from music 1-8 to music 9-16 so it doesn't replace the other ones""

Yes, I realize this is for Age of Empires II, but I bit that can you fix this game's music problem in the exact same way, since the two games use the same engine and all. I'll try it myself later on and tell you if it really works."
,Reaper24,2011-05-17T16:44Z,"Nope, it didn't work. The demo version of this game has no music either -_-

Can't shake the impression though that this is grossly inferior to AOE2. Maybe it's just from playing it the first time now, but taking that into account, I still think AOE2, the original game with that engine, is still much better.
