These are the files needed for OpenTTD from Transport Tycoon Deluxe. Since you can't buy the original game anymore, you can only download these files.



You should put these files into /usr/share/games/openttd/data on linux (root privileges required), or into folder called 'Data' in openttd install dir on windows.

Have fun!
