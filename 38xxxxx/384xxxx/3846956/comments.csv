,FinCat,2008-02-05T23:18Z,seems this is the trial version!
,DavidRoss,2008-03-06T21:17Z,"FinCat's correct - this is only the trial version and no way to register it with the keygen that I can see (and I've tried everything I can think of).  Not worth the d/l, sorry guys."
,Magpie13,2008-04-26T01:26Z,"yeah - does anyone know HOW to put a key into the software? dont see an option myself...tried all the usual places (about, help, after trial expired)....anyone?"
,david323,2008-06-01T07:38Z,"The only way to enter the serial is during one of the first few steps of the initial installation. If you don't enter it when you first install the app, there is no other way to do so later. GENERATE key FIRST and have it ready BEFORE you install. Enter it during installation procedure!"

,finallymaybe,2008-07-04T17:42Z,"David, I dont see ANY place to put in a reg. code. Whats the gig?"
,finallymaybe,2008-07-04T17:43Z,"I installed a few times, dont see anyplace to put it in."
,bitemeborb,2008-07-06T15:43Z,No place can you enter the serial. I am starting to believe that this is not worth the download. It is just a trial version.
,dsrs,2009-04-30T16:43Z,"always check the list of files!!
the -d- in the acronis exe file means TRIAL"
,bytehog,2011-03-20T06:38Z,ESET says trojan!  Beware of keygen!
