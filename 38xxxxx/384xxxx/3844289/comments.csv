,paidfare,2008-09-19T02:24Z,"If you ask around the warez community you will find that most key generators, cracks & patches work because they use code which has values very similar to viruses and trojans. Anti virus program suppliers working hand in hand with software developers identify anything with these values as a virus or trojan to discourage piracy. There have been many occasions when legitimate software was identified temporally as infected because the program used a string of code with values close to virus & trojans."
