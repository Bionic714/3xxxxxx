Avisynth frame server is a beta version, but i did not find no trouble with it
I used first time Avisynth plugin undot(), becouse the source was little bit noisy. So this is an experimental relese. ( Digitally remastered by vaino666 hah haa). So all complaints direct to my email vaino666@hotmail.com
Plesa tell me is this release good or how can I make this better.
