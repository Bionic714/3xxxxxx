Unknown (well at least to me) group NeoX have released Ashampoo?s latest version of Magical Snap. Magical Snap, as you can probably guess, is a screen capture (or crapture ;) ) utility, but also has a few unique features that set this apart, such as the support for multiple monitors and capture things that are off-screen. I think I?ll stick with SnagIt, but nonetheless looks like a nice piece of software. NeoX have released this with a keygen for the serial protection, and the release is packed into 3 archives. (Btw, I think there NFO is terrible. and when I captured it cut off the text that goes outside the border?)

Ashampoo Magical Snap 2 is a screen capture tool with powerful and intuitive editing capabilities. It enables you to capture virtually anything on your screen ? all or part of program windows, websites, the desktop and anything else displayed on your computer?s monitor. Then you can use the editing tools to enhance the screenshot and turn it into a really attractive image.
