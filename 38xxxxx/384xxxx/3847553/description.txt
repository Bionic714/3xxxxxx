--= The What =--

The bare bone MagicISO/PowerISO application needed to convert proprietary *.uif/*.daa files to ISO.


--= The How =-- (for *.uif)

0. If you are converting *.uif bigger than 300MB run MagicISO_Install.reg to register MagicISO.
1. Start MagicISO.exe
2. Tools > Convert
3. You'll figure out the rest :)
4. Optionally run MagicISO_Uninstall.reg to remove entries added by MagicISO_Install.reg


--= The How =-- (for *.daa)

0. If you are converting *.daa bigger than 300MB run PowerISO_Install.reg to register PowerISO.
1. Start PowerISO.exe
2. Tools > Convert
3. You'll figure out the rest :)
4. Optionally run PowerISO_Uninstall.reg to remove entries added by PowerISO_Install.reg


--= The Why =--

For a simple reason really. Yet another proprietary *.uif/*.daa format makes everyone's life harder.


--= The Caution =--

I've only tested converting since this was my whole and only purpose. Other operations might fail or
maybe even damage your system. Don't use this for anything other than converting.
