,eusuntsiva,2007-10-26T14:55Z,Thank's for this to all but most of all to rogierio.

,odyssey666,2007-11-13T17:41Z,"Thank you rogiero, much appreciated.  A lot better than having to install magicISO :-)"
,n1nj4Lo,2007-11-18T21:00Z,"Yes awesome work Rogiero!!! I tip my hat off to you, I went on ahead and installed the full version of MagicISO(The same exact build and make that was in the ""MagicISO.exe"" in this torrent and ran the .reg file and it worked perfectly... For that I thank you a lot, Finally a real full and registered version of MagicISO!!! LoL, Ya jus really don't understand how many I've downloaded and ran the keygens, patches, cracks and serials and they never registered... So therefore this is great..."

,c_live_lee,2007-11-20T09:18Z,My bad! I accidentally posted that last comment on the wrong page! Woops
,loninappleton,2007-11-28T23:00Z,"I must be the punk on this one.  The reg appears to run fine.  However M-ISO still doesn't execute the convert.

M-ISO appears to be part of the torrent.  Running that exe will find the target file but not begin the convert.

The original M-ISO from d/l stalls out at 7% which I figure is the 300mb limit.

My UIF 411gb.  Could this just be lack of patience or something else?

Asking another way, how long would a 4Gb file take to convert to ISO?"
,ervin27,2007-12-22T07:25Z,thanks it works great
,mikeywolf,2007-12-29T11:42Z,"Nice work! I've been looking for an old game for a while, and I could only find it in .daa format... Anyway, thanks!"
,Dj-Syndrome,2008-01-04T03:37Z,Ok so I have about a 3 gig .daa file so how do I use this to open and install it?

,meowing,2008-02-11T05:49Z,"Be VERY careful with this, some of the same named torrents of this are trojan downloaders.

Don't say I didn't warn you."
,meowing,2008-02-11T07:15Z,"Just to add to this that THIS is the only one out there that is NOT holding ADS or Trojan crap.

Brilliant upload, rogiero!"
,Suppozo,2008-02-11T08:39Z,"I'm not going to lie to you, I got all high and spent 2 1/2 hours trying to convert this fucking .daa (forgot how I used to do it), and stumbled across this - life saver. No spyware or anything, A+ upload, appreciate it man!

As none of us have even made theese programs.. We`re just following the pack man.) And dont even want anyone to have the means to convert them to good old .iso??
