,coreydennis,2008-05-04T16:47Z,Can i get a working version of this anywhere? and do yout think the error comes up becuase my computer cannot handle the game?
,coreydennis,2008-05-05T02:03Z,kk i figured it out i just used my other computer with windows XP now im trying to register for PlayOnline but its asking me for registration code included in the software package and i dont know what to do. I have the credit info and stuff im willling to pay for the account but i dont know how to sign up XD im just confused as hell.
,gorospetros,2008-05-06T12:16Z,is asking me for registriation code what sould i put?????Help plzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,coreydennis,2008-05-07T01:21Z,Ok i gues its just back up cd's XP as in even if you want to pay for an acount you still need the PLAYONLINE package itself because the code is inside the box and there is NO other way to get it sooo for eveyone trying to download this unless you already have an account then NVM!
,pether,2008-05-08T01:05Z,"Uhm... yes.. Its a MMORPG.

And it says s in the description here on tpb."
,Shadow_FF6,2008-05-10T19:08Z,"When I try to run the game I get an immediate ""Playonline has stopped working error"" while trying to run this on Vista. Yah... vista... Anyone know how? The other guy 'figured it out' by switching OS, but I don't have the option."
,ssonnie,2008-05-11T06:07Z,go to www.playonline.com and download the playonline viewer for Vista to play the game on Vista.
,ssonnie,2008-05-11T06:10Z,go to www.playonline.com in the multimedia section on the left hand side there should be a link to the 'VISTA compatibility' link
,fallenleon,2008-06-01T16:28Z,"For all you fools that are asking for an online number code.  READ what the uploader wrote.  Come on, its not that hard."
,quezicotl,2008-06-29T09:15Z,"you painful retched bitch, shut up and get your own life, your in the damn download page for the game your talking shit about, and by the way we're not goths, just people who like to experience stories, not just read them."
,NIIIdsgfearf,2008-07-13T18:23Z,Hey I just checked out FFXI webpage there is some fixes for vista to download 
,negativeone,2008-08-01T13:47Z,"So does this work OFFLINE 100%? I have no accounts, but I don't really care about online, just want offline.."
,joshmiccar,2008-08-03T06:24Z,dumbass if it worked offline then why in the description would it say you need an active paid account?  people need to start to read the descriptions on here it'll answer half your problems
,joshmiccar,2008-08-04T18:41Z,goths go get laid....wait a minute if you don't use pirate bay to download stuff then you just made an account just to say that...which means you're the one with no life....and if you do use pirate bay then you're talking about people who are doing the same thing you're doing....therefore you insulted yourself....so just go home and keep sucking your mom's cock painful rectal itch....nice name retard lol
,joshmiccar,2008-08-04T18:51Z,btw painful rectal itch they sell just about everything on ebay you may want to check and see if you can buy a life you may be able to get one for cheap.  have a nice day :)

,Moogy,2008-09-26T01:17Z,is this chains of promathia? the first original game?
,Getus,2008-10-08T06:09Z,"Rectal itch ... u should realize that the ORIGINAL final fantasy for NES was to be the creators 'final' attempt at a game, after so many failed attempts ... he created about half a dozen games that were just terrible - then he created final fantasy which became a huge hit ... and it took off from there. why change the name of a series that works through a name that works well? it is each of the worlds final fantasies, no two games are ever in the same world (with the exception of the new upcoming xiii games)"

,elitedw,2009-09-27T01:50Z,"You can use this with ProjectXI. Its like a server simulator. So you can mess around with it. Just google ProjectXI. 

You may need a trial account from SE to register ffxi. and log in local system."
,pmpnin9,2009-12-01T15:43Z,"ok so I'm stuck at the same ""please insert disc 2 to continue installation"", I realize this question has been asked already with no reply lol and it looks like some people got this to work so please could you tell the rest of us how to get past the disc 2 point....any and all help is greatly appreciated!

STAY AWAY."
,.235.,2012-01-03T19:32Z,Database error? I'll summarize by saying OP is a fag.
