,gpdavis74,2007-11-23T05:36Z,"something's wrong with the sound on this.. Seems to work decently enough though sound seems to be a huge part of the game, so I suggest maybe this isn't going to work"
,johnbrine,2008-01-28T04:36Z,"okay, how do you get this to work. I have 1.13
tried the 1.3.1 crack, didn't work.( I have Leopard)
tried updating the iPatcher, told me ""This app won't 
work on this architecture"". Absolutely stumped. Almost considering finding the game for cheap
ps-If you have a mac, and the sound doesn't work-go into Audio Midi setup, and change to 2 channel, 44khz. That should fix it....still waiting for a working crack

,edelo,2008-12-16T02:09Z,"For people who've used Macs for like 12 years but didn't even know they had a ""Audio Midi Setup"" (like yours truly), it's in the Utilities folder, you change ""Properties For"" to built-in output, then source to whatever's closest to 44 Khz (I guess), and 2ch-16bit in the next pulldown worked for me.
Thanks johnbrine :-)"
,edelo,2008-12-16T19:23Z,"PS. I just had an issue where trying to run the game gave me a ""Invalid CD Key"" message and would I please enter it again, which, when done, resulted in same.
Pulling out the ethernet cable helped (I guess you could use Little Snitch as well).
Had to do the Audio Midi stuff fix as well again, wonder why OS X doesn't just remember that.."
