=)"
,Ugly Bob,2007-10-16T13:39Z,I'm glad you like it. :)
,FlightPirate,2007-10-16T14:58Z,ah come on guys! this is a fundraiser for the real aircraft... totally uncalled for!
,Ugly Bob,2007-10-16T15:32Z,"I'll be happy to pay for it, it's only 20 bucks... But in my country it's very difficult (ukraine), since it uses Flight1 wrapper :( No credit cards here at all..."
,ricko16,2007-10-16T18:42Z,THX always wanted to fly in the DC-2 as a pilot i hope the flights are not so bumpy as in the real Uiver.

PLEASE DON'T LET THE TPB FSX SCENE DIE.  PROPS TO ALL FSX POSTERS.

BUT, I don't use FSX and never will for a long time to come, sorry.

I am working on skAI v2.3 (taking lots of my time) and still learning for my exams."
,FlightPirate,2007-10-17T07:30Z,so stealing from charity is ok?!
,chris32,2007-10-17T08:18Z,"As I see it if it was really charity, it would be donationware and not cost 20 freakin dollars"
,frankieforcefield,2007-10-17T12:14Z,"Don't take this as a flamer, FlightPirate, but what are you saying? It's ok to steal as long as it's not from a charity? We're all theives here, we all left our morality at the login screen, so rejoice my fellow theives and I'll see you all in Hell!

Thanks for the up Ugly Bob. Long live The Pirate Bay!"

,surfer22,2008-01-06T16:37Z,Any Rip version of it's Service Pack 1?
,GoldenScimitar,2008-05-03T08:54Z,"Thanks for the great upload.  Because the installer is for FSX, copying the folders from a temporary folder into FS9 works, but when the aircraft is loaded within FS2004, some tailplane and wingtip textures are missing.  This is just a heads up for those of you willing to use the DC-2 for FS9."
,ApacheHunter,2008-05-22T15:21Z,Could anyone please seed this? I need it! Thanks in advance ;)
,ApacheHunter,2008-05-25T20:41Z,"If anybody downloads any torrent and stops seeding it when the download finishes, the torrent will die! I'm trying to download this for three days now and I only have 50%!! So please don't be selfish and seed! You are not the only one who wants the UIVER!!!"
