,YobbyGobby,2007-11-27T15:22Z,"Hey,  im having a problem with this download,  ive finished the download,  but i can only hear the audio which seems perfect but the actual video isnt showing...Please can someone help me???  Thanks"
,belakovi,2007-12-11T21:04Z,"YobbyGobby: I think you should install codecs, and then you will see the video. The two codecs i use:
http://www.xvidmovies.com/codec/
http://ac3filter.net/projects/ac3filter
the second one is not really necessary ithink its just audio codec (and you wrote that the sound is good)"
,TorrChick.,2008-03-24T20:04Z,heyy i had the same problem i was downloading a movie : bring it on in it or win it .. everything went good except the video itself. i hear'd the audio// but not the video .. so i downlOadedd a prog. now it works fine .. but the only problem is it doesn't have a sub. someone knows how to put subs on a movie?
,Focus88,2008-05-23T23:24Z,Thank you for uploading. =)
,Cameigons,2008-06-07T20:22Z,"To all of you having problems to see the video: 
It's almost certainly a codec problem, you people need to install the XviD codec."
,cheer-bec,2008-06-18T01:19Z,why is it so freaking slow? only 49 kb/s.

,smashley21_2006,2009-12-05T08:13Z,"great quality for both V & A.

I use VLC Media player for everything I download. Then you never have to download any other programs to make the movies work. VLC also gives you the option to put up subtitles, as long as you're watching it through that."
