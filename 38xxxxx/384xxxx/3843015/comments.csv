,fallout11,2008-04-26T15:21Z,"Follow-up:  Located a much better encoding of this great series, via semi-private tracker -
http://www.majin2007.com/torrents-details.php?id=11
Action segments are not nearly so grainy, dual audio (english/japanese)."
,melfice26,2008-06-10T23:10Z,"True,
but encoding avi to mpeg gives some grain, but at least my encodings are watchable (and I think in pretty good quality) on a standard DVD player.
I'm a collector of anime, so I mostly make  DVD's to complete a series. All uploads are custom, and the best quality I could get. I have only put it all together into a DVD. Hope some people can enjo and appreciate this.

,JSLau2008,2008-08-21T03:55Z,"Can someone please reseed this torrent? The availability is only 0.649, which means that the download will stop at 64.9%. Thank you."

,DelSDelT,2009-03-30T06:06Z,"Please seed, for the love of all that is Holy."
,DelSDelT,2009-04-05T20:11Z,"Seriously, please seed. All the other discs have completely downloaded, but there's not even anyone with 100% who's seeding."
,Un4goten_Syn,2009-06-05T01:42Z,"melfice26, if you see this.  Please Seed Again.  Quite a few people are stuck at 93.8%(myself one of them) We'd like to get this finished."
,Bonko777,2009-07-30T17:58Z,"yo... Just wonder what type of format these disks are... I tried to write on to DVD and of course it won't work in my DVD player are they R-, R+, RW-, RW+.. Please HELP..."
,Bonko777,2009-07-30T18:00Z,"also if possible what did you you use to write, and or how did you do it?"
,d3m0n1q_733rz,2010-03-15T01:07Z,"I keep all of my downloaded files queued in case they drop to 0.  If someone would please allow me to completely download them all, I'll keep it alive after.  I also super-seed forcing others to share as well.  "
,d3m0n1q_733rz,2010-03-19T07:44Z,Would people please enable super seeding so that we'll still have at least one full copy when you log off for the night?
,d3m0n1q_733rz,2010-03-21T08:44Z,"This rip could use some serious block filtering, deinterlacing and un-sharp filtering.  Fast scenes seem to have the worst problems meaning that it might have been better to focus compression away from the slower ones to compensate.  Just a matter of opinion for future reference."
