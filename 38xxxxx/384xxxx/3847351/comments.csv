,SublimeDragon,2008-07-05T16:12Z,"great stuff acid, don't listen to the lazy asses who can't take the time to sort these files themselves... it's bad enough that they're stealing the music in the first place... 

if you want it all sorted out, then do it... don't complain when you're fucking stealing anyhow..."
,Vlad420,2008-08-08T11:40Z,I cant understand why all you people are complaining about needing to sort the files... i use windows media player and it sorts them all and renames them for me
