PLOT:

Everybody knows that a boy's best friend is a flesh-eating zombie.
When his mom buys a six-foot domesticated member of the living dead
to be the household butler, little Timmy Robinson (K'Sun Ray)
names him Fido and forms a special bond with the creature.
And even though Fido ends up eating the neighbors,
Timmy does everything he can to keep Fido as his "pet."

GOOD DEAD ARE HARD TO FIND

Enjoy!
