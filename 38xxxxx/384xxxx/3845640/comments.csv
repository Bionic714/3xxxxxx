,Dekripify,2009-02-25T16:44Z,"lol @ Volryn

Grendel = Combination of Industrial and Aggrotech (especially after their album Harsh Generation.)"
,bonziisuncool,2009-05-28T23:46Z,i need more aggrotech and industrial cuz im a diehard rivethead now. any other suggestions guys?
,Kazombie,2009-06-01T16:01Z,"Thanks for this, loving the tunes. 

@Volyrn, you're the kinda person that has a really big stick up their ass over this kinda stuff cause you think you found it first and screw everyone else that listens to it.  Raka said they were open minded about music, just cause they thought it was something else...sheesh! 

Just because they haven't got a genre down to its ""known as"" term does not, in any way, make it acceptable for you to abuse someone like that. 

Just listen to the music and screw what everyone else thinks."
,madarab405,2009-06-23T23:56Z,Thanks for the up!
,Fr0stify,2009-07-07T23:32Z,"Messy listing, many multiples, worthless. Thanks anyway."
,brent_reddish,2010-06-20T12:55Z,"bonziisuncool Try Dawn of Ashes, Psyclon Nine, Juno Reactor, and stuff. "
,ViolentC,2011-05-31T11:47Z,"yay I found it.
I just downloaded 4.5 gig of Grendel comic books...
Epic Fail!"
,StoopidMerekat,2011-06-04T22:08Z,"Bonziisuncool. You need to listen to Psyclon Nine, Unter Null, Ruoska, God Module, Tactical Sekt. Go to Pandora, and type in the artist's name. It'll give you a lot of other artists with similar music."
,StoopidMerekat,2011-06-05T02:54Z,Amazing torrent! Fast download. In the mood for some of this right now.
,angra_mainyu,2011-06-20T06:34Z,"can anyone upload a Eisenfunk torrent please?

@ViolentC I nearly did too!!"
,Il_Greko,2012-02-21T02:54Z,Thanks man. Awesome music!
