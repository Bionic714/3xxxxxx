,BFRG6306,2009-12-04T05:08Z,"Sorry for previous comment.

,iambac,2010-02-05T22:36Z,Don't waste you're time over half of these don't work
,iambac,2010-02-05T22:40Z,"No I ust VLC on all of my music and movies but they do not work with VLC, almost half of them do work."
,philip1201,2010-02-25T16:03Z,"If you idiots read the comments properly, you'd realize they aren't broken: everything is simply on there twice, and you should only download the ones with ""AC/DC -"" in front of the name. If you do that, you'll get standard mp3s which you don't need anything for to play."
,Zefkaas,2010-03-25T07:31Z,"well check this out so long, a lovely new band that merges the old and the new in a very genuine sounding way. I'm really enjoying them lately.

,DrSoos,2010-05-02T21:12Z,"Some people should learn to use a computer b4 the post negative comments. all the files with acdc appended to the album name are in mp3 format and they work just fine. so as I said learn what the fuck you are talking about b4 you comment on things.
thnx for the UL telperin"
,jszipsp,2010-07-04T05:26Z,philip1201 has it everything is on twice just dl the folders with acdc first and your set thx to uploader but wtf were u thinking?
,demun,2010-08-16T13:53Z,"While it's true you should download those files, the important thing is, why even bother putting the other files in to begin with?"
,poormansdvd,2010-09-18T01:46Z,"why dont you fu__ing  cry babies go buy every album your trying to steel and you f__king upload the mother FUC_ing thing you inconsiderate MFERS

,feltman,2011-02-08T18:09Z,"If you upload a torrent, it should work, be functional mp3s etc, no unnecessary crap PERIOD 

if you have failed following the simple unwritten rules, you have fucked up PERIOD

Crap torrent PERIOD"
,puunjab,2011-02-19T21:10Z,"This is possibly the worst torrent ever. You don't upload junk and then put in the comments to ignore half the torrent.

Telperin seriously made the worst torrent in history. Amazing cause that's fucking hard to pull off.

Telperin is a true ass goblin."
