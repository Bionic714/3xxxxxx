Classic Western - B&W - VHS rip

In John Ford's sombre exploration mythologising of American heroes, he slowly reveals the character of Owen Thursday, who sees his new posting to the desolate Fort Apache as a chance to claim the military honour which he believes is rightfully his. Arrogant, obsessed with military form and ultimately self-destructive, Thursday attempts to destroy the Apache chief Cochise after luring him across the border from Mexico, against the advice of his subordinates.

Quality is ok for VHS.  You can see a problem with some of the contrast.  Other than that is seems ok.

I'll post the specs later in a comment.
