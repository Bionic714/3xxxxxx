,nearadyn,2008-04-07T09:09Z,"izombies, RESEARCH what Credo says for yourself. Anyone who REALLY wants to know the truth should realize that you have to hunt it down fiercely, not expect it to fall into your lap. The purpose of Credo's message is to point you in the right direction, it's up to you to get yourself there."

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.
