http://www.yourfilehost.com/media.php?cat=other&file=swedish.ltc

Där finns svenska till spelet. Gå in där, sen så högerklickar ni på DOWNLOAD
SWEDISH.LTC och sparar den i C:>Sports Interactive>FM08>Data>Languages. För er som inte
förstår, det brukar vanligtvist vara i Disk C-->Program->Sports interactive-->Football manager 08-->Data Languages. Där ska
filen vara. Öppna spelet och ändra i inställningarna till svenska. Ska funka med svenska nu.

,Bossebasse,2007-11-13T10:39Z,"Okay, so here's my problem. When I try to unpack the files so that I can mount the .bin and .cue Winrar tells me that the file is corrupted and won't finish the unpack. Well it finishes, but the .bin doesn't get unpacked.

I know that there's nothing wrong with this torrent, since it has worked in the past for me, so obviously it's Winrar that's ruining it. I've already tried to re-install Winrar but that didn't help. Is there any other program than Winrar I can use? Or is there some way to mount without unpacking the files?"
