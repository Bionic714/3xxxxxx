Whats up with this??"
,Dragunov_930,2007-11-10T13:18Z,Were is the crack? I canÂ´t find it! Please write i full explanation were it is.
,DeadlyParadise,2007-11-26T22:17Z,"The crack is on the ""CD""
open up your cd so you see all files on it. 
in there is a map called crack open it.
copy the exe file from in there to the game directory. for example
C:\...\2K Games\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Railroads!
when it says do you want to replace the original file with this one you say Yes.
easy."

or then get it from gameburnworld
or gamecopyworld"
,leogo188,2009-01-10T06:51Z,Does Anyone Know If This Torrent Works?
,teamcarramrod,2009-08-28T01:52Z,"Works fine. D/l it. you may need Ultraiso for extraction, but right click the cd then click extract here. run the setup.exe. then when that is finished copy the crack exe file from in there to the game directory. for example
C:\...\2K Games\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Railroads!       (mine was in c:downloads)
when it says do you want to replace the original file with this one you say Yes. 
It is now ready to play. works perfect for me"
,austerus,2009-09-07T15:19Z,does this include patch to ver 1.10 ?
,Warll,2009-12-15T10:33Z,"Once you are done playing the game's standard maps you can find many custom, fan made map ones here: http://www.smrsimple.com/category/maps/

There are some really good ones like Basin & Range and many include new trains and buildings."
,makapa7,2010-03-30T14:31Z,"quick get this downloaded, spend a few hours getting it.

remember when you have it,  unpack it and THEN discover that there is no crack included, as suspected.

complete waste of time, supposedly in a folder called maps or crack, neither of which exist.

just another complete waste of time and discs."
,konture,2010-05-25T15:51Z,Doesnt work with my win7 :(
,myroslavmail,2010-06-07T14:04Z,Thank you! On my WinXP everything works fine! The only bad things about this game IMAO - maps are too little
