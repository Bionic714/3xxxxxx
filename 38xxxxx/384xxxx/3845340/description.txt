====================================================

Sid Meier's Railroads! is an economic simulation game developed by Sid Meier on the Gamebryo game engine and released in October 2006. It is the sequel to Railroad Tycoon 3. 

Railroads! is fully three-dimensional and geared more toward head to head real time strategy than the previous versions. The terrain is also more compressed in this game; there are few areas where players are allowed a long, straight run of track, meaning that more "interesting" parts, such as hills, mountains, rivers, and inlets, play a much more important role in the game.

The game is heavily focused on economics Ã¢?? players have to build and sustain entire industries using the railroads they develop. Gameplay changes from previous editions of Railroad Tycoon include a system where new technology is first auctioned to the highest bidder. This gives the player a ten-year exclusive use of that technology. Similarly, whole industries are also put up for auction amongst players. Tracklaying is automated and much easier than other editions of Railroad Tycoon. When combined with the more "compressed" terrain, it allows for tactical placement of track to obstruct and frustrate opponents.
