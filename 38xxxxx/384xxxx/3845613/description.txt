TE group came up with new version of this popular software. It?s really helpful if you don?t have a standalone divx-xvid player. It converts almost any video file to DVD-VIDEO format. It?s easy to use, and also fast; for one standard movie it needs less than hour to convert it (tested on my own PC - Dual Core 4400+ AMD Athlon with 2,5GB DDR2 RAM). Of course, if you have a better configuration, converting time will be reduced.

ConvertXtoDVD is a video converter software to convert and burn your videos to DVD. With ConvertXtoDVD and a few clicks you can backup your movies to DVD playable on any home DVD player.

ConvertXtoDVD supports most popular formats such as AVI to DVD; Mpeg, Mpeg, Mpeg4, MP4, VOB, WMV, DV and stream formats to DVD. It converts your files into a compliant DVD Video set of files and burns it on a DVD media. The ConvertXtoDvd does not need an external AVI codec download. It uses its own AVI codecs.

The aspect ratio can be automatically selected or forced to a specific format. The program works for NTSC and PAL video formats and creates chapters automatically. Multiple audio tracks are supported. Version 2 uses a completely rewritten interface with subtitles support and a lot of new settings.
