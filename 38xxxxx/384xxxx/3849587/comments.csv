All the other images gave some weird errors when installingen."
[V],RadioActiveWeasel,2008-02-02T11:55Z,"runs smooth, 64bit is very nice. a great copy!"
,risingtiger,2008-04-06T21:45Z,"The download was fantastic. Very quick and responsive. Only problem is: during installation it is asking for a product ID--which I thought was not required in this specific copy.

Any ideas?"
,risingtiger,2008-04-10T03:35Z,"Just a follow up on my last comment. 

The install works beautifully! Just a note to others out there (hopefully save ya some hassel). I was using vm fusion on a mac to install windows and chose the easy install -- which caused uneasy grief! 

If you are using vm fusion on a mac to install this make sure to uncheck the easy install. Do it manually instead."
