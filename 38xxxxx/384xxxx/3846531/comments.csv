Ok, Dizaztor.  First let me correct your second statement and show you what a dick is.  This is how it should look.

""If you don't like, please provide constructive CRITICISM so maybe YOU can make this place BETTER.""

And no, people don't hate on The Pirate Bay because of ""dicks"" like me.  A lot of people hate it because it is a cesspool of child exploitation.

And as far as being ""constructive"" with my criticism, that's as constructive as I have to be.  I thought the file was a waste of space on my hardrive.  I glanced at the pictures and thought they were crap.  I'm entitled to my opinion as you are to yours, so STFU and deal with it.

Have a nice day, and a Merry Fucking Christmas."

First off, the torrent is what it is.  It's a ""whopping"" 25MB of 437 pics.  Quality at an average file size of 55K per pic should be obvious before the download.  Still, if you're a fan of these types of pics then I'd give it a shot.  It's an extremely small, well seeded download and takes up virtually nothing on my new 1TB hard drive.

BTW, The reason some people dislike this site (and why I upload elsewhere) is because of a lack of proper modding and comments like above.  Comment on the torrent.  No one really gives a crap about you or whether you're a dick or not.  Deal with it.

,b0dyrem0ver,2008-11-18T14:40Z,Alpha_Q_Up soon vanished when he realised he'd been jacking off to his sister in these pics. ;)
,mariusjr,2008-11-23T19:45Z,"you see many see through outfits.
But I can't see the oops factor there. These pictures are taken with special camera's, en highlited with special software. It's not like they walking like that on street.
Bit cheating, I think.

But there are some funny photo's there!"
,amradwan80,2008-12-22T01:22Z,thank u man

,MovieDude-1,2009-04-24T22:46Z,"Have to agree!  THIS IS WORTH IT JUST FOR THE KELLY BROOK PICS!   She should be seen everywhere!

Has anyone seen her in the movie Survival Island? Wow!  She walks around in her bikini or topless almost the whole movie.   She is gorgeous.  I recommend you get the movie on Amazon.com for $4 and not here though.  

Enjoy!"
,Mat2001uk,2009-05-13T11:24Z,"Well I just deleted the ones I don't want/already have and I now have 36 Celebrity OOPPSS! :-)

But yes, Many thanks for the Kelly Brook, Natalie Portman and *especially* the Nadine Coyle ones."
