This is all seven Moody Blues MFSL CDs in lossless formats. They come from different sources, I will admit. Some are APE, some are FLAC. Some have high-res art, some do not. Some are single files, some are broken up. But it's all here!

Days of Future Passed
In Search of the Lost Chord
On the Threshold of a Dream
To Our Children's Children's Children
A Question of Balance
Every Good Boy Deserves Favour
Seventh Sojourn

Now here's the Plus part: I've included the original mix of Days of Future Passed, taken from a Dutch half-speed vinyl from Thom Osburn. If you've downloaded this already, download it again. I've fixed a tiny error in one track and corrected the pitch across the board. I've also included a little piece that explains the differences between the two mixes.
