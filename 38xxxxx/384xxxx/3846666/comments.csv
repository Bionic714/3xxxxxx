,NFLMAN,2008-06-29T13:39Z,Thanks for this great collection of music. The Moodies with Mike Pinder were top shelf. Check out the new Among The Stars album by Pinder. It is evident after hearing it that Pinder added the substance to the early Moody Blues records.

I use Linux, normally I'd mind the APE stuff as I decoding it is a pain but now that I've taken over APE to FLAC and know how to do it, I can fix this. I can even split the single files and tag and rename them auto-magically from the command line."

What do you mean by this?

How Do You Do It?

I am a Linux user and have only recently discovered the APE format.  What converts it to FLAC on the command line?"
