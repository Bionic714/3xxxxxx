InfoStealer.Gampass in Rar

Infostealer.Gampass is a Trojan horse that lowers security settings and drops files on the compromised computer. Infostealer.Gampass is designed to open a large security loophole through which hundreds of malicious adware and spyware can be piped to your machine. In addition, Infostealer.Gampass opens a backdoor that allows the remote attacker to get the full control over the infected computer and this places any financial or banking information stored on your computer in severe jeopardy and represents a serious security risk."
