First off, thanks for putting up the torrent.  I have been looking for the 360 songs for ages.  Thanks man.  Your a godsend.  Secondly, I have been having problems with the torrent itself.  If we could talk through email, I would be so appreciative.  I am: thelightbearer@msn.com.  Thanks for your time.  "
