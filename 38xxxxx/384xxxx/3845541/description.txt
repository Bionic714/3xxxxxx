Electric Sheep is a screensaver for Windows, Mac, Linux and BSD.

From http://electricsheep.org:

Electric Sheep is a free, open source screen saver run by thousands of people all over the world. It can be installed on any ordinary PC or Mac. When these computers \"sleep\", the screen saver comes on and the computers communicate with each other by the internet to share the work of creating morphing abstract animations known as \"sheep\". The result is a collective \"android dream\", an homage to Philip K. Dick\'s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.


This is a sheep pack from my computer consisting of 11G sheeps. Download as many as you want, and just put them in the correct folder. For more information see the web page.

I\'m doing this since I\'m about to re-install my computer and need some off-site storage for this ;o). Will seed a few days though.
