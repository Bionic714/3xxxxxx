1994 Fortuna/Celestial Harmonies 17082 (CD)
Reviewed by Linda Kohanov, Muze, The Herald (Allaire, New Jersey)
Should be considered the second disc of ORIGINS. Recently unearthed: seven artifacts, 77 minutes, and several thousand years old, from now. This is at the deep core of Roach's Tribal-Ambient phase. "Immerse yourself in its throbbing rhythms, riding on the electro-acoustic textures he renders in organic manipulations... probing the netherside... more searing than soothing." (CD REVIEW)
