,tricache,2008-02-12T06:31Z,it says tested and working on 3.60 M33 so I would have assumed that it would need at least that
,Undefeated915,2008-02-27T05:43Z,"I was running 3.71 M33-4 and it said I need 3.80

It works fine on 3.90 M33-2"
,rickem35,2008-02-28T11:31Z,"I think he meant to say 3.90M33 because there is no 3.60M33, The slims came out with 3.60 stock. I'll wait for the full rip to come out but thanks for the up!!!"
