MDK is a third-person shooter game developed by Shiny Entertainment and released in 1997 by Playmates Interactive Entertainment for the PC, Macintosh, and subsequently PlayStation. It was one of the first games to run only in Pentium or superior range of processors (for the PC version) but did not have a GPU requirement. Critically, it was hailed as one of the best games of 1997, and sold accordingly. The game soundtrack, composed by Tommy Tallarico, was also released, with moderate success.

The game tells the story of its protagonist, Kurt Hectic and his attempts to rescue Earth from an alien invasion of gigantic strip mining city-vehicles named 'Minecrawlers', which are not only removing all of earth's natural resources but are also flattening any people and cities that get in their way. The game combined fast action with fully 3D rendered, state-of-the art (for the time) graphics and a warped sense of humour. It featured a never before seen "sniper mode" that allowed the player to zoom in on an enemy and target them with astonishing accuracy.
