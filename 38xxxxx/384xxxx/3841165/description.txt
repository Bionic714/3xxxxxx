Resident Evil Extinction 2007 
FRENCH TELECiNE 

The plague has traveled around the world infecting most of the world's population, turning 
everyone into the walking undead. The deadly virus also has destroyed the world as we knew 
it, rendering the planet a desert. Alice (Milla Jovovich) has been forced to roam the Earth 
alone attempting to stay off Umbrella's radar. A convoy led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) 
and former U.B.C.S. agent Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) along with L.J. (Mike Epps) and other 
survivors who have not been infected, travel from small town to small town in search of other 
survivors and supplies, staying away from any large cities - areas that may potentially be 
infested with zombies. Their goal is to find a place that has not been infected by the virus.
