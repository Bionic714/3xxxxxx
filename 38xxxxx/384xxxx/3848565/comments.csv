,misswent,2008-11-19T20:03Z,"Anyone having trouble burning this as well? I unpacked it with winrar, selected the ISO file with nero ROm and even at different speeds it ""fails""to burn the file, anyone know what I'm doing wrong?"
,AtlasPSX,2009-01-02T18:01Z,"Use a high quality DVD-R. Also don't use Nero, it sucks ass. Use MagicISO or Droppix Recorder."
,l33t_sp34k3r_T0ny,2009-01-08T17:45Z,"Someone help please! im using pcsx2 0.9.4 emulator, cant run this game cause of some minor read errors. All i can see is just intro movies, then application close, windows asking for sending report, etc.
