Vakse Viggo is a comic about the office junior Viggo, who basically spend his time at the office trying to aviod any work, take naps, make food, or make wierd inventions (which usually end up as disasters). Its not long stories, just 1 page jokes, but a pretty funny comic.
Reccomended for all ages of readers
