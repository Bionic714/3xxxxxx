,abbe123,2007-10-18T21:48Z,Hope your seeding on a fast connection
,sluttyboy,2007-10-19T00:07Z,"seeded on 10Mb/s but utorrent crashed on me while i was playing, hope someone had gotten it by then. "
,sluttyboy,2007-10-19T00:19Z,"Oh, and by the way, the demo only includes 5 sections which you can go through as easily you take a leak. You can't even finish the quest you get in the beginning (unless I've missed something) 'cause you can't get to that station.

Am I the only one sick and tired of 1,5GB+ demos that don't give you shit regarding the feeling of the game? Can't be good for the gamecos either..."
,Churchills Dog,2007-10-19T04:07Z,"Crap graphics, dull combat, boring quests. So much potential in the idea but Flagship Studios dropped the ball. If you wanna play a shooter-style RPG try Tabula Rasa. It may be cheesy but at least its more polished and fun than this turd."
