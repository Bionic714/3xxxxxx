,Sla4o,2007-12-23T03:06Z,Seed pls ...
,lodger111,2008-01-05T19:10Z,This would be an AMAZING torrent if only there was somebody seeding it... :(
,assprobe,2008-01-11T20:21Z,"i agree, all that work and no seeds :/"
,TeesterX,2008-02-05T17:05Z,There must be somebody who could seed this? Anybody? Plz!?
,Electric_Blue7331,2008-02-06T06:31Z,"It says 1 Seed and 73 Leeches, yet I still get 0KB/s down :( Please help this is one of the best collections I've come across"
,TeesterX,2008-02-06T20:15Z,"Same here Electric Blue. Says one seed, until the download screen comes up and it says no seeds. It downloads to 12%(the same as the other peers)then stops. And this really is a fantastic collection too, cruelly just out of reach."
,bitkrieg,2008-02-09T22:51Z,"Sorry for keeping you waiting people. Some lame asses hacked my machine several times over. I don't really care about that but at a certain point it was getting really weird, especially the stuff they were doing.

Anyway, I'm back and I managed to restore the wonderfull sounds of this torrent with the secret hash2music program left on my harddrive by these hackers.;)"
,bitkrieg,2008-02-09T23:06Z,"Ow and one more thing. 
It's nice to leave comments but please thank Tronik for this one.
This is result of some pretty amazing online collaboration of these folks. Most amazing electronic music compilation on the net for sure.

They probably don't like this out here so all we can do is make them feel a bit better about it...;)"
,TeesterX,2008-02-10T03:04Z,"Nice one Bitkrieg, and a special thanx to Tronik too. Certainly is the greatest music compilation on the net."
,MikeyC4,2008-02-12T13:59Z,Oh good work - been revisiting this one to see if it was gonna pop back into life! This includes probably the only Orbital mix I don't own and I must admit it's giving me a bit of a throb... Big up to Bitkrieg and Tronik!
,damien23,2008-05-15T11:39Z,"wow, this torrent is awsome!!!! hope I dont have any trouble downloading it:( I sucks when It just stop:P keep up the good work BITKRIEG!!=)"
,authortitle,2008-05-26T13:06Z,"What a fantastic torrent, downloaded overnight, I'm listening to it in order and enjoying it immensely so far (on the Delerium track at the second)

There's only about two tracks in the whole thing that I've heard (and I thought I'd heard a lot of electronic music!), so it's a fantastic history lesson. The descriptions of each track really add to it as well, you can tell Tronik have (had?) a great passion for the scene.

Really brilliant, many thanks for sharing, Bitkrieg, and of course, huge thanks to Tronik for compiling this awesome collection in the first place (and for everything else they've released over the years!)"
,richieG,2008-06-19T20:19Z,"I'm with Authortitle on this one, this is a fantastic must-have compilation. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

Thanks very much!"
