    Compiled by Sasha and Digweed

    This has got the be one of the best (if not the best) Progressive House
    compilations ever done, along with the likes of Renaissance I. We at Tronik
    are proud to give you the unmixed version of selected tracks from Sasha
    and Digweed's Classic Mix that was Limited Edition in a 4 record set :)
    These tracks (which I own most of singly), represent what really got me
    started as an Underground DJ, and are the very essence in the evolution
    of the Trance and Progressive House styles. As always, Tronik will 
    continue to pursue bringing you the best quality rips and music alike.
   
    (Note to other Rippers: It took me 4 days to clean up these tracks,
     and I thought if it is worth releasing, it is worth the effort to 
     attempt, at least, the removal of any clicks and surface noise. I only 
     hope that others after me will strive to do what they can to improve the
     quality of vinyl releases in the scene.)
