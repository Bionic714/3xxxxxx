,MikeyC4,2008-02-12T13:52Z,"Man...! Awesome post, been looking for that mix of Water From A Vine Leaf for many years, not to mention Obsession, Sound System & Liquid Cool. You've made my day - thanks."
,MisterBenn,2008-08-10T20:59Z,A superb torrent. I couldn't agree more on Northern Exposure Vol1 and Renaissance 1 being timeless releases. They are some of my favourites ever! Thanks for sharing.
,djbigjeremy,2008-09-09T11:12Z,"I totally agree!  Mainstream people have no idea what good techno is.  All of that faggy, club, perkulator bullshit makes it all look bad.  Then here in Pheonix, there's a techno radio station.  It's a start, right?  Wrong!  All the dj's are pee-pee suckin' queers who play the radio edits of shitty commercially released garbage.  The same shit they play on your cable companies electronic or dance music channel.  Whoo Fuckin
' Hoo!  Even XM radio sucks half the time.  Guess I got to move to the UK."
