The opener 'Gravity' simply has to be a homage to 'Exit' period TD. 
The sound palette and compositional style are spot on for that era. 
Indeed the whole track is just perfect. Notes are struck and left to 
fade into the distance. A slow beautiful flutey melody drifts through 
the ether. A sequence starts up. Another melodic sequence bubbles 
to the surface taking us back to those heady days when our heroes 
still had something exciting to say. This second sequence gains in 
power all the time whilst a stonking lead line hits all those musical 
pleasure receptors (ooh err missus!). We even get some recited 
foreign text as in 'Kiew Mission' (I think!). It all works so well. A 
wonderful way to start the album. The title track, at almost half an 
hour, is a real epic. Tranquil pads waft from the speakers then a 
casual Eastern sounding lead line can just be heard. Enter a tabla type 
rhythmic sequence and it's instant 'Hyperborea'! 
Another sequence falls into formation. The backing swells and things 
become increasingly syncopated. This is rapidly turning into another 
cracker, but they are not finished yet as another sequence bursts 
forth and the excitement level goes up yet another couple of notches. 
There is a definite moodiness to the lead lines; a sort of edgy 
melancholy which when contrasted with all the powerful pulsations 
makes things even more effective. We get an explosion through 
which the pulsations surge, like fighter aircraft through a ball of flame. 
Some more sampled speech gives a sinister twist. A bass beat strikes 
up and in its wake the sequences morph to give a more optimistic 
feel, enhanced by some lovely soft pads. In the seventeenth minute 
the sequences start to subside, we get some manic laughing then 
distorted echoing utterances. The mood changes once again as a 
tinkling sequence emerges from watery effects like air bubbles rising 
from a diver far below. There is a delicate beauty to it all. Backing 
drones create a contrasting melancholia. A more percussive sequence 
enhances an already excellent passage of music still further. A slow 
thoughtful lead glides above the pulsations taking us to the end of 
another excellent track with many a twist and turn along the way. 

'History' explodes onto the scene with vast reverberating fizzing stabs 
of sound. Sampled text calls out to a crowd on more than one 
occasion, relieving important events from the past. The tension builds 
and builds embellished by Jarre type electronic whooshes. The pace 
quickens as an insistent rhythm drives things forward along with a 
lovely thick bass line. A little melodic motif skips over the top. This is 
excellent body moving stuff. A sharper lead line cuts through the air. 
Ethereal pads and a more delicate sequence bring some contrast 
nearer the end but overall this is a non-compromising track full of 
power and attitude. With a track called 'Sequenced' there are certain 
expectations but it isn't until the third minute that the expected rapid 
note runs burst through. They are well worth waiting for however as 
my hands are soon beating out time on the table, being taken along 
by the mounting excitement. Things become increasingly syncopated 
until just before the half way mark where the energy level subsides a 
little only to make things seem even more ball breaking when the vast 
wall of notes reappear.

'Dive' appropriately starts with a drone that seems to go deeper and 
deeper until it is replaced by ominous dark pads. You can almost feel 
the vast weight of water above you. A tinkling loop shines through the 
blackness like a laser, bass pulses getting the heart to race. Thick 
mournful pads make a fleeting appearance then wallop, sequences 
and rhythms start to surge forward faster than I could take them in. 
An almost anthemic lead completes the picture. Wordless female 
vocal colouring momentarily adds a little softness before we surge 
forwards once more. What an awesome way to finish what is I reckon 
the best Pyramid Peak album yet. (DL)
