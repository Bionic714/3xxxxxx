,perrinbobby,2007-12-31T10:32Z,This is a killer-app. Cured 1763 errors. Is that a record?
[V],Slickinator,2007-12-31T18:29Z,not sure lol  and so you all know because xp actually holds empty reg folders for certain hardware like printers and such it will always find about 120-200 errors ok just so you don't think its not getting stuff but it does but windows xp puts the empty reg folders back for future porinters and devices added and glad it worked all

,sceejays,2008-02-04T16:02Z,im new at this wheres the patch and how do i apply to the regcure directory
[V],Slickinator,2008-02-07T01:34Z,"first of all make a note after you install the regcure first don't start the program meaning when it says run regcure after you install you uncheck that box and say no and then use the patch 

it is the zip file that is with it just extract and right click on it and copy the patch and paste the patch in  the regcure installed folder which will be located after you install in   C:\Program Files\RegCure

and once the patch is in there its a blacky xy looking thing you double click on it in that directoy and then once its open click on the patch button and it will say patched and then you close it all down and your done"
,Aloka,2008-02-10T17:30Z,"Please Slickinator can you write for ""stupid"" like me how do to all this.

,squisch,2008-02-26T20:05Z,I løøøøøøøøøøv this. Thank you. 
[V],Slickinator,2008-03-05T19:53Z,ok Aloka first thing you do is download the torrent and then you look in to the folder where the files are you just downloaded there will be 3 files the regcuresetup.exe the regcure 1xxx.zip and the cim.nfo file first off your double click on the regcuresetup.exe file and install it and when it asks you to run regcure with a check in a box uncheck it and click finish and done and then go back to your folder where you regcuresetup.exe is and find the other one regcure 1xxx.zip (you will need winzip or winrar to unzip the patch inside it) then double click on it and unzip it to where ever you want and find the file called regcure.1.x.x.xx-patch.exe and RIGHT click on the file now left click and when the little menu pops up after you RIGHT click on it click on to the copy part now next you open my computer and then go to local drive c: then to program files then look and go to regcure and go in side that folder and then you right click in there on a open space meaning right click on nothing in that folder just in a white area and when that menu pops up again click down on paste and it will copy the regcure.1.x.x.xx-patch.exe file in there now find that file in there and double click on it or i mean LEFT click on it fast twice then it will open and you will see a black looking menu thing pop up now look on the bottom right area of it and click on the Button that says PATCH click on it and you will see a little writing in the middle of the black menu saying patching is done now close everything off so your back to your desktop and now open regcure and it will work and is registered enjoy and hope this Laymens guide helped you Enjoy From Slickinator
,G-status,2008-03-06T14:36Z,Works 100%... great instrctions on the comments section also
[V],Slickinator,2008-05-06T01:37Z,well as long as you uninstall  make sure you delete the folder from the program files if its there and then reinstall and when it has the check marked to start program uncheck it and then click finish and then do the crack easy as that
,andyc4577,2008-05-14T20:48Z,thanks works fine

,onionf,2008-10-05T13:02Z,"thanks a load, bud"
,lockeiu,2008-10-06T15:30Z,Why did i find Backdoor.Win32.Rbot.byt in the Patch? Wtf please shed some light on this...
,WACThriller93,2009-01-05T02:55Z,Yea why the trojan AVG detected it as soon as i extracted?
,BitPikey,2009-02-09T15:06Z,"yup, 2 trojans in this according to AVG...1 of them it can't remove..."
[V],Slickinator,2009-02-21T18:51Z,because its a PATCH meaning because of what it does the antivirus will give it a name of what it thinks hence thinks it could be trust me the patch is not a virus but they give it a virus name because of how it patches and that was the closest thing too it trust me its not a virus most patches and keygens will have a virus false positive these days as they try and get rid of that stuff 
,DrNo1970,2009-04-16T22:07Z,"Props to my good man Slickinator ;D

I've had major probz of late,and finally saw regcure.As Slick said AVG thinx its a virus,as did counterspy(i had to shut down counterspy),but jus ignored AVG.

Installing is easy as pie,BUT ...just make sure you dont try to open/use the patch before its in the final c drive regcure folder.

A easy mistake to make lol

Otherwise u havta uninstall/re-install again,as it will keep saying unregistered version ;p

Puter runs like a top and got rid of rofefuzi.dll anddddd nugamulo.dll crap that infested my start menu!!!Plus a ton of other crap heeheh.

Highly reccommend...and cheerz n thanx again Slick..."
,DrNo1970,2009-04-21T21:54Z,"I just havta add 1 more small point for any of u using certain anti-virus products...

Some anti-virus products(the shield included)will remove the keygen/patch from your system,and i had no way of selecting that i wanted to keep it ;(

It will still run,but give an error that your system restore is turned off(which it is'nt).

Sooo..i found if you're able to just overwrite the original file(without keygen) then there is no mistakes and theres no prompts fer viruses ;)"
,-Unknown-,2009-11-01T06:49Z,"I downloaded the torrent, copied the patch into the RegCure file, patched it, yet it still isn't registered. Why is this?"
,nedswife,2010-01-06T10:01Z, Can u use this with Vista?
