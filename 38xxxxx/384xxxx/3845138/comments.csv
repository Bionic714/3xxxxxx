,Aller1208,2007-10-17T02:44Z,"Yeah, but what's your point? "
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T03:15Z,"True, except I'm not using .rar files - as I write, it contains the .mdf and .mds files. Perhaps I should have compressed it - but done is done ;-)"
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T03:31Z,"Haha, true... Should have done that :S"
,jacoblo33,2007-10-17T03:37Z,Any chance for anyone to upload the entire game or the mac files that should be on the same hybrid disc...?
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T03:39Z,Mac-files are also on the disc.
,benfran,2007-10-17T03:46Z,"Thanks alot aller1208.
Hope to finally see the real one (after seeing so many fakes lately).
Im downloading it right now, and i'd like to know if it's possible to copy it on a cd (in order to install it on a mac) or i have to use it only with daemon and yasu like rizl4 (so it would only be in windows) ?

"
,Legenden_,2007-10-17T03:48Z,where did you found this one?
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T03:53Z,"With the right tool, you should be able to burn the image to a disc and install it on a MAC - I haven't tried burning it to a CD yet, so can't tell... Can't see why it shouldn't work though."
,benfran,2007-10-17T03:55Z,"Thanks for the quick answer, i'll try to burn it tomorrow when hopefully it'll be downloaded.

The only pb right now is that nobody is seeding in yours (there are 18 seeds in rizl4's...im downloading and be seeding both).
"
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T03:57Z,"Good good, I'm seeding for as long as possible and hopefully those that do download the entire file from me will see too... You can also burn RizL4's edition to disc, it should be the same one."
,benfran,2007-10-17T04:02Z,"Ok, i'll try it tomorrow then. And let mac users know how it went.
Thanks again"
,max937,2007-10-17T04:20Z,does this work?? is the patch in it
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T04:25Z,"The patch that arrives on friday? Wouldn't count on it, mate ;-)

But it works fine, it's the same files that I'm using to play it with now...."
,dr_horse,2007-10-17T04:26Z,"It installs, can't find my way round safedisc yet though. That's prolly my ineptitude rather than anything else. Nice job Aller, thanks for the effort. I'll do some seeding tomorrow."
,max937,2007-10-17T04:27Z,thanks aller.. how do u get around safedisk?
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T04:29Z,"Safedisc? It uses SecuROM, and instructions are in the .txt file that was in the torrent."
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T04:33Z,"1) Use the following tools: 
   - Daemon Tools 4.09 (4.10 is reported to NOT work)
   - YASU (Yet Another SecuROM Utility) 1.4.7080 - get it here: http://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_utils_8.shtml#Y.A.S.U

2) First, mount the .mds file in Daemon Tools. Install the game and choose to not run the game after installation has completed.

3) Copy the YASU.exe file to the path where Daemon Tools is installed. Doubleclick the YASU.exe file to start the cloaking of Daemon Tools.

4) Find the location where you installed Football Manager 2008 to. Rightclick the .exe file, and set it to run as Administrator and set compatibility 
mode to Windows 2000 or Windows XP (Windows 98-mode returned an ""System does not meet the system requirements""-error when starting the game)

5) It should now bypass the security check when starting the game. If not, make sure you've read this file again - it worked for me using this procedure.

// Aller"
,max937,2007-10-17T04:33Z,can you burn this and make it work... or does it require deamon tools
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T04:35Z,Will most likely work when burned. Can't see why it shouldn't.
,denilson,2007-10-17T04:35Z,"First of all, tanks aller for the upload!

I have two questions:
does it come a patch with updates on friday or around friday?

if so, and you add the patch, is it compatible with a saved game (can you continue a saved game with a new patch)?"
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T04:37Z,"As far as I know, a patch is due to arrive on the official releaseday (friday).

It should be compatible with savegames, although I would create a new game after the patch has been installed."
,denilson,2007-10-17T04:39Z,"ok, but that leaves me curious on why you then would create a new game?"
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T04:42Z,"A patch changes some things in the game, and if you save a game in 8.0, apply the patch (8.0.1?) and just continue with the savegame, it might interfere with your old savegame - so a general rule is to always create a new game when applying a patch.

Football Manager is a very complex game (codewise), and it's very easy for some new code to change existing code for the worse - without the programmers being aware of it."
,setzel,2007-10-17T04:44Z,i cannot run the game i dont understand what to do in point 4 :(:(
,Aller1208,2007-10-17T04:48Z,"Find your FM.exe file - if necessary use Windows' Search-tool to find it.

Then click once on it with your right mouse button, and goto properties. There should be a tab called Compatibility (i suppose, I'm not on an English Windows). Tick off the first item (""Compatibilitymode""), and from the dropdown select either Windows 2000 or Windows XP.

This step was necessary for most users on FM 2007 - however, it might not be necessary on FM 2008, have I found out after having written the .txt file. Try without this step first. If it works for you, hey... Enjoy."
,denilson,2007-10-17T04:48Z,satisfying answer. cheers!
,setzel,2007-10-17T04:50Z,Still cannot play can somebody explain me via MSN ???

,dr_horse,2007-10-17T04:53Z,"Yea sorry I meant securom, am trying to do 2 things at once. Got it working now, just needed to update my versions of daemon tools and yasu. thanks again."

Have you tried running without compatibility mode enabled? That worked for a few of my friends....

Is that ""UAC""-thing (User Access Control) enabled or disabled on your system. Google for how to either turn it off or on."

I havent scrolled the pages, so if anyone already have come with this solution, then sorry, I dont mean to rip your solution.

Download game

Mount file with Daemon Tools
Go to: www.gamecopyworld.com - Search for Football Manager 2008 - Get the exe swap file and copy it into your FM2008 directory and overwrite your original fm.exe file.

---

Language:

You can simply use the languages from the FM2008 demo. Just copy it into the excact same directory as in the demo.

Have fun."

,J1veBunny,2008-03-27T01:07Z,keeps telling me wrong disk... followed all instructions... how do i get it to work??
,spraggy2,2008-03-27T13:34Z,if you can't get it to work type in google football manager 2008 NO CD CRACK then start downloading it once it has downloaded extract the file it will then have the same icon as football manager the game itself. open my computer and go to the hard drive u have installe football manager on now click program files and you will then find a folder named sports interative that is where football manger is saved now the drag the NO CD CRACK file into that folder and in will say overwipe click yes and once it has complete the game will run very nice
,ollak35,2008-04-06T19:39Z,"Till alla svenskar som inte kan få igång det; Jag har Windows XP och har fått igång det utan problem. Se till att du har skaffat Daemon tools 4.09, och YASU 1.4.7080. Använd bara en drive, och mounta FM2008.mds som ligger i mappen du laddat ner. Efter du mountat så kopiera YASU.exe filen som du laddade ner och lägg den i den mapp där du installerat daemon tools. Dubbelklicka på YASU.exe och tryck på ""cloak"". Stäng inte YASU efter detta utan minimera det! Om du nu dubbelklickar på fm-skivan på din ""den här datorn"" så ska det börja installera eller om du redan installerat, börja köras. Detta är precis vad jag gjort och det funkar bra för mig."
