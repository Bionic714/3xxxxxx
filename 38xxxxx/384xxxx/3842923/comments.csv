Thanks for sharing! :)"
,chakravirthi,2008-06-24T13:20Z,have been looking for this one. but speed is very low need seeders guys.
,chakravirthi,2008-07-24T10:35Z,Minthos you are absolutely right. As the download was happening i wanted to check the quality. I noticed the english subs and english soundtracks are missing. I have 568mb more to go and no proper speed. The total download time elapsed is 1week 5days and still going on. anyway won't be giving up. Just saying to let people know.
,chakravirthi,2008-08-20T04:27Z,"just finished downloading. sorry about the wrong information everything is working fine. it opens in all media players which are dvd compatible. can select english, spanish subtitles and also audio frm the dvd root menu. THANKS.cool documentary. am seeding it now"
