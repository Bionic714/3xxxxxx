Jane Austen?s classic novel chronicles the events in the
lives of the Bennet family. Take a family with five
unmarried daughters and a lack of wealth, throw in a new
wealthy neighbor or two, plus a whole regiment of soldiers
in town, and add a heaping spoonful of pride and a pinch
of prejudice. Mix it all together and you get a story full
of tears and laughter, embarrassment and pride, and, of
course, love.
