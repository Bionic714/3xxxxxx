 DO *NOT* DOWNLOAD this one !!! 

Webroot SpySweeper AntiVirus (6.1.0 build 107) detected a very nasty spyware in it.

Name : Keybugger
Severity : Critical

http://research.webroot.com/search.php?serialnumber=v6dgs〈=en&loc=CAN&category=System%20Monitor&rc=1
--------------------------------------------
Description:
Keybugger is a monitoring program that tracks all activities of computer users.

Characteristics:
Keybugger may monitor and capture your computer activity, including recording all keystrokes, e-mails, chat room dialogue, instant message dialogue, Web sites visited, usernames, passwords, and programs run.

Consequences:
This system monitor may allow an unauthorized, third party to view potentially sensitive information, such as passwords, e-mail, and chat room conversation. 
--------------------------------------------

Ouch !
Thankfully, I was made aware of it, and Good'Ole SpySweeper put it in Quarantine for me.

The person who uploaded it either puts people in confidence (so they leave their guards down) by saying ""ALWAYS RUN AN ANTI-VIRUS"", or maybe he was truly well-intentioned and was just fooled himself and didn't know about his computer being infected.

In any case, do NOT download it.
There are other clean versions of this app elsewhere, just look around.

Cheers,

,daMouse,2009-05-04T23:07Z,"Thank you for the heads-up.
I just tested with Webroot Spysweeper here and it does indeed report on the patch file(not the software). However I'm convinced that it's a false positive since this file has been scanned by me over a period of at least three years using a variety of quality antivirus software, currently a full version of the latest from Kaspersky. I also uploaded the file to Kaspersky's and some others online scanners that detected nothing in the file. It is fairly common for patch/crack files to generate false positives since the code they use is often using dirty code to modify files in order to remove or circumvent copy protection. If several scanners or a more renowned one than Webroot found something then I would be concerned. Never stop scanning. :)"

Thanks and seed!!!"
,daMouse,2010-02-21T06:44Z,"I've had a lookaround for some speedy alternative, something I do about once a year to keep updated. The regular alternatives that people think are fast still just aren't. One commercial option is Fast Picture Viewer, a modern project that even has a 64bit version. It's really fast especially at large images, and almost fast enough to replace ACDSee 3.10, almost. Unfortunately Fast Picture Viewer is a bit odd in that it doesn't have a folder/file view but instead by default reads all pictures from within the current folder and its subfolders. Can make for a confusing first encounter, but probably great for photographers needing to look through tons of images in search for a specific. It's the best out there that I could find, and in the end it's almost good enough to replace ACDSee 3.10.

That's kinda sad in the year of 2010, but there it is. ;-)"
