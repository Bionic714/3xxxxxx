,madmax999,2007-10-18T00:14Z,The seed appears to be up and running.
,madmax999,2007-10-18T04:43Z,ok - maybe not. I tried re-starting twice.  Is any one having problems getting it to start?

,madmax999,2008-03-23T18:10Z,I put it back in my seed list a couple days ago. Let me know if you are having problems with the dl.  I'll leave it up through the end of the month.  But I have a bunch of classics to post so the speed may be a little slow.
