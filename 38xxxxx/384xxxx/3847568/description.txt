   - New futuristic storyline set in a virtual reality military training program 

   - Fully customizable controls to fit every style of play 

   - More weapons, firearms and explosives to choose from 

   - Ad-hoc and infrastructure online multiplayer modes for up to eight players 
                          
   Coded Arms 2 thrusts players into a new cybernetic crisis where they must
   use their hacking abilities and an arsenal of high-powered weaponry to
   survive. As a lone security agent players will return to A.I.D.A., a virtual
   reality military training program, to prevent cyber-terrorists from taking
   control of the program and gaining access to classified military information.
   The hackers believe that AIDA shouldn't be restricted for only government use.
   The agent must use his abilities and combat skills to disinfect AIDA from the
   hacker-introduced virus so he can escape the system. Across a variety of
   enclosed and open-air levels, players will take on original enemies with an
   all-new selection of firearms and explosives that lets them counter the
   terrorist menace with more firepower than ever before. Up to eight players can
   go head-to-head in the game's new online multiplayer modes.
