,maheffe,2007-12-18T19:13Z,"IF YOU LIVE IN THE USA, do NOT download this torrent OR ANY torrent with fear and loathing in las vegas.
my ISP just threatened me (drop my internet service) for downloading this torrent.
BEWARE - - DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK if you live in the USA!!!"
,Delron40,2008-01-21T01:37Z,Obviously the last ass wasnt smart enough to use PG2. There's nothing wrong with this file.
,Mambo Bananapatch,2008-02-10T18:54Z,"Delron40 is referring to PeerGuardian 2, an excellent, perhaps indispensable, utility for filesharers.

It's no guarantee but it substantially reduces the likelihood of getting caught."
,double_b26,2008-03-06T22:25Z,"i use the ""SafePeer"" plug-in for Azureus, which also uses the peer guardian database from what i understand.  ive been using safepeer for a couple years now and have yet to get 'caught' by my isp or anyone else.  Peer Guardian or SafePeer are a MUST HAVE if you live in the States."
,Delron40,2008-10-08T01:55Z,"Thanks to those helping me seed. Leechers remember, the community depends on you. If nobody shares, the freebies go away. Remember, the only reason you can download this free movie is because others are generous enough to keep sharing it with you. If nobody shares, everybody loses, so even if its for an extra hour or two after you get it, remember, others want to see it too, and they can't without you. "
,espo195,2008-11-25T00:47Z,"ok so any seeders here, keep sharing cuz i want that file. at 65%. Got ratio at 50,000% will be seeding for a while"
