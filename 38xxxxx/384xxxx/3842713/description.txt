An Admission




This FLAC upload is not taken / ripped from my own CD collection !!!!!
I acquired this great double CD on my travels around the internet .

I cannot take credit or condemnation for the quality of this uploads but i feel this album should be shared with Duran Duran fans.

I rarely upload content that is not from my own collection but i feel in this case i must make an exception !!!!!!!
