,pbogdanovic,2007-11-22T10:28Z,This one might be for Opel but is not compatible with Lacia/Fiat/Alfa G3 system
,hansjeg,2008-01-06T14:30Z,"It is for Opel and is working fine, but unfortunately it is not a recent one. It's an early 2006 (most likely labeled 2005-Q4 by Navteq) version, only containing Poland, SK, CZ and Hungary. On later versions, Greece is included as well. Anybody got that one??"
,T4uru5,2008-01-20T19:32Z,"Anybody know how to burn this one properly?
Nero 6.6 says its a foreign image, and asks about image type, block, header and trailer size, and stuff like that, and I don't want to waste a roll of empty CD-s just to try each option...
any ideas?"
