RATT's recently released DVD containing their videos "The Video" (1985), "Detonator Videoaction" (1991) + four unreleased musicvideos and bonus commentary audio track from Stephen Pearcy and Warren DeMartini. Cool stuff!

DVD
Video: MPEG-2 Fullscreen 4:3
Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1 & 2.0

I dropped out the LPCM stereo track from the main video in favor for uncompressed and otherwise untouched material.
