Title  : Fake It
BitRate: 128kbs 44.1KHz Stereo

This is not my torrent (i got it off www.isohunt.com). But its a GOOD version, non-promo, and non-radio-edit version. only 128kbs but its the best i could find. and since TPB didn't have one (aside from the promo) i thought i'd add it here. although i had to make my own torrent (the isohunt version didn't have any TPB trackers)

and before you bitch or complain about the 128kbs, re-read the part where i said its not my torrent :-p   furthermore 128kbs is good enough and a HELL of alot smaller ;) and besides i doubt many of you, that just HAVE to have the +384 versions and stuff, are probly playing them on cheap ass speakers/headphones anyway. so not like you could hear a difference :-p
