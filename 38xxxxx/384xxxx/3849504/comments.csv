,bijeroe,2007-11-04T18:13Z,"Fake, fake, fake- 3 first songs are real- everythin' else is songs from other artists/bands."
,n3cro515,2007-11-06T01:15Z,"First 3 tracks are looped samples of the new songs, but the rest are clearly not Dillinger.. Can anyone name all the songs???"
,CaptMidnight,2007-11-07T08:19Z,"theres actually a real rip out there, i think its 192kps, its floating around those share sites, sorry can't help, im buying the album on the 13th, the tracks up on myspace show the bands talents.. this album won't be better than MISS MACHINE but it will have equal destruction!

Milk Lizard is fucking sick! =)"
