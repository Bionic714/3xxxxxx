,centime,2008-10-12T14:05Z,"Does this work with XP?

It installed fine, but when I try and run it, it says my video drivers ""may be out of date"", which they aren't.  All my drivers are current, and I tried to tweak the settings at the beginning of the game, but nothing helped.  Is this an XP problem, or am I just being an idiot and missing something obvious?

Thanks for the torrent, though.  Nice one :)"

,Darktangent10,2010-08-23T03:01Z,"What is this 'prison is hell' shit?  There's only The Suffering, and The Suffering:  Ties That Bind.  Which one is this?"
,aotp608,2010-09-14T04:31Z,"im using vista, ive done every step listed, but after i insert the video settings. the game goes to start up but crashes and a error message comes up saying ""engine has stopped running"" is there anyway to fix this?"
,Antula,2011-10-21T17:36Z,"IT WORKS!! 

This torrent made me a happy MF! thank you Silence69, btw im on windows xp and for those who thought the torrent was fishy like me, its just a custom installer that doesn't have the stupid starforce or securom thing that doen'st let you play.

anyway, if you have an xp, and you wanna play this, DO IT!"
,golvion,2011-11-09T09:28Z,"I had the same problem like @z3u5z @luis97913..
I don't know what causes it, but the games ties that bind worked 100%. "
,reviral,2012-04-17T23:09Z, I hope my beard won't be too grey by the time this is done downloading. Taking forever. And I really hope the game picks up my keyboard. 
,hippo2432,2012-05-30T23:08Z,runs great on win 7 haven't bothered to see if you can run it without compatibility mode
