,i Busk,2007-12-19T18:25Z,"Sorry, I saw the title when I DL it! Opus 61. I was looking for his romance in C-flat."
,snubbedpeer,2008-04-23T00:21Z,Beethoven only wrote one Violin Concerto and this is it.
,snubbedpeer,2009-12-08T23:32Z,It would be nice if some of the downloaders would consider seeding this torrent. During the last 4 months it has been uploaded at least 43 times by me and I seldom see any other seeders. Why are you so stingy ? Its less than 100 megabytes so its not a big deal.
,mamboze,2009-12-22T17:55Z,@snubbedpeer  OK I'm happy to help here. I'll leave the concerto on my hard drive for an extended time - don't care really for how long - I'm in Thailand so bandwidth is not an issue. I need to give something back to the bittorrent community.
