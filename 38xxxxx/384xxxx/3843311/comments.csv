Of Course, its a HACK!

Don't tell its a Trojan noobs -.-"
,RadicalMotE,2007-10-15T21:33Z,"So thats how you think about hacks these days?
HACKS SHOULDN'T CONSIST TROJANS stupid motherfockers...
use your focking brains.. why would there be a trojan inside a hack for a multiplayer game.. tick tack.. ding: correct answer: too steal your steam id.
have fun and download it, but install some firewall + antivirus + spy blast thing first hmmk? "
,ripture,2007-10-15T23:10Z,"lol @ pimp and his small epeen.

Radical is right, hacks will NOT contain viruses or trojans.  They will affect only the game files and modify them in non-volatile ways.

The only people that use hacks are people who have no skill and feel like they have to compensate somewhere.

The only people that distribute hacks are people that want to spread viruses and be all-around douches."
,dysphunktion,2007-10-16T06:09Z,"You idiots do realize that a lot of Multiplayer cheats will show up as trojans right? Granted, that it is not, in fact, a trojan, but the scan and detection engines will not make that distinction. The same applies to various keygens. Don't try to act smart, especially when you're not."
,Nauticle,2007-10-16T21:35Z,"It's Simple. Don't Download it. There is no way to tell weather or not this ""Trojan"" is just the hacking software being detected, or an actual trojan.  Go to legitimate hacking sites then, and get it without trying this iffy download."
,f1here,2007-10-20T18:08Z,Too damn funny reading all these posts over noob hacks.
