,stylishirish,2007-12-15T23:07Z,"firstly i will preface this by saying that i am a regular listener to coast to coast am with george noory - a show that alex jones frequents... i also live in the same city as alex jones and am familiar with his own radio show... i was really looking forward to some intelligent discussion or evidence regarding this 'new world order' and modern day 'illuminati' that i have heard so much about rom various conspiracy theorists.... having said that - THIS 4 PART VIDEO IS COMPLETE AND TOTAL BULLSHIT! i, myself, could make some of the same speculative statements having no real knowledge of what allegations i was making - such as riding the coatails of the jfk assasination and somehow associating this with this whole illuminati ideation. AND THEN...what actually appeared and seemed to be researched and empirical 'evidence' was another crock of shit... two examples --- 'the thirteen arrows and stripes and so on on american currency is only due to the significant tie to the importance of this number 13 in the secret society -- and the capital washington dc...district of colombia... is somehow related to the colombian control and so duly named (having to do with drug money, funding, political and social power etc)

jesus christ 

could seeing 13 so much on the dollar be in any way related to THE UNITED STATES HAVING 13 ORIGINAL COLONIES WHEN IT WAS FOUNDED

and maybe, just maybe the 'district of colombia' might have been named so because of some chap named colombus having explored the americas a few years prior? 

jesus fucking christ i am dissappointed 

this torrent should be named:

THE IMAGINATION - ALL THEORY NO LIMITS

fuck me running this is sad

if you really buy in to this shit you are ironically the automaton that 'they' so cleverly depict as being brainwashed by the media into not seeing 'these...their hidden truths'

fucking dumbshits

a waste of a download and a waste of a watch

... this is coming from someone who does not usually subscribe to the orthodox belief systems or mainstream concepts -- but there is a lot of 'reaching' here to make conclusions...if there was anything substancial to reach for to begin with"
,nearadyn,2007-12-18T01:25Z,"Wow, stylishirish, for someone who claims to be open-minded and an avid student of the conspiracy, you sure seem to want to convince everyone not to watch this. I would say that this is confusing to me except that your very comments themselves seem to contradict the idea of you really being a serious researcher who is open-minded at all. In fact, it wouldn't suprise me if you are a Freemason yourself...Oh, there I go again being ""paranoid"". I am taking pills for that, and daily injections."
,stylishirish,2007-12-18T11:36Z,"i never claimed to be a 'student of the conspiracy' so the former part of that sentence is incorrect, however you are spot on with the latter. generally speaking, i am very open-minded when it comes to 'seek and ye shall find' - but i found some of the people 'unbelievable' in their very nature and if you couple that with the far reaching assertations made by their 'research' and 'truth digging'... well it just makes for a bad example of where the real truth may be here 

so... do i believe in the premise of the video... yes, emphatically... i just think that the content of this particular video(s) was sort of given that sensationalist 'propaganda' feel that these very same conspiracy theorists brand the media and political world of today's society. 

i do thank you for the upload though of course! ...and am open to hearing what other videos may be out there....

dont know what city/country you are in - but coasttocoastam.com is the site for the radio show i mentioned, and i think you can still listen to a live feed of it (when its on the air 10p-2a pacific time in california)... on 640kfi.com... or kfi640.com...in los angeles... its a quality feed... if you have any interest in these types of topics but dont listen to that show - you really should.

but just as with this particular video... sometimes the guests on the show or the subject matter is a little....um... 'out there'... but when it really is something that captivates - you wish the show were longer than the 4 hours its on ..... every night.... 7 days a week....365 days a year... :) peace"

,chumzy,2008-06-07T09:18Z,"Ok I don't care if its all a crock of shit.  The point is that as long as your thinking of crazy shit like this your not brain washed.  Its all about the maybe.  Maybe if you just want to have facts if you only want the possible then suffer along with every one else.  Yes Lots of things they say I think is no way  possible, but half the shit we learn didn't happen like what they say.  Just look at the point of things rather than the correctness of what is making the point.  

If you can't watch something with crazy ideas then just gouge your eyes out.   "

,breon,2009-03-27T04:16Z,"I agree that secret societies do exist, but they also claim that the Freemasons are Illuminati, and how are the Freemasons a ""secret"" when everyone knows that they exist?"
,nearadyn,2009-04-16T09:28Z,"breon, 
Of course the existence of the freemasons is not a secret. The freemasons are rather, a society with secrets. Also, I feel the masons are on the lower end of the food chain of secret societies. A pool of individuals from which recruitment into the truly secret groups is done. Just my view. And I don't agree with everything on this DVD or even the way it is presented. I think they could have made it much less dramatic and gotten to the point of it much better. I posted it because I think it's worth watching to get out of it what good information there is."
