,pjuppi,2007-10-14T01:38Z,"hey, i loock happely to try this one :D, but have some question, the license in this, isn't a key from like dell or something? you can update with windows uptade and so on?
and there isn't any other trackers to this?
the picture on it is very fresh ;) loocks pretty much like vista but with black skin :D i just must test this one on my computer ;)

,BuzzMe,2007-10-14T06:56Z,Does it have Genuine Advantage?  (I prefer not.)
,R.T.2,2007-10-14T12:49Z,"Great looking torrent;

Unfortunately can't do much without seeders for a file of this size. Been stuck at 2.8% seemingly forever.

,bogdangelu,2007-10-14T17:40Z,seed please????
,okenboy,2007-10-14T18:36Z,seeda nu då!!
,zacyoda,2007-10-17T01:08Z,I downloaded this and it doesnt work. A real bitch to get it to burn. And when it tries to install the drivers it says its running a 16 bit os and askes you to cancel or ingnore then it finally crashes and says bad line of code and setup error and setup will have to cancel. Dont bother downloading until its fixed. It sounds nice but doesnt work on my laptop which is a dell gamming laptop.
,Qkn6,2007-10-17T10:17Z,It works perfect. Thanx for a great release!
,StaringBlind,2007-10-18T03:55Z,"You can get Black.XP.DVD.v4.10.Golden.Edition from your news group server much faster than here.  Its in   alt.binaries.cd.image
                    alt.binaries.dvd
                    alt.binaries.dvds

according to www.binsearch.info.  So if you know how to use your ISP's newsgroups and don't want to wait, there you go.  Enjoy.  >:0"
,Givijoarna,2007-10-18T17:13Z,"hey StaringBlind,, please help me to download that golden version,, how can i download it??"
,StaringBlind,2007-10-19T05:10Z,"Here is a good guide for using newsgroups.

http://www.slyck.com/ng.php

Here is a list of free newsgroup servers if your ISP doesn't have one or if you don't  want a premium provider.  

http://freenews.maxbaud.net/

If you need more help ask."
,Givijoarna,2007-10-19T13:08Z,"thanks for the links,,,,, but i feel like a total idiot,,,,, becuse i dont understand a thing :(,,but i understand it will not be totaly free :(,,,, so  is there other places, that i can download that Golden.Edition from???  torrents or megaupload?"
,goatslap,2007-10-20T10:55Z,Too bad nobody is seeding 4.10 golden master edition.
,iamxerc,2007-10-20T16:17Z,who says it doesn't work? where did you download it from!?
,StaringBlind,2007-10-22T02:12Z,"Givijoarna,  It is totally free. You can pay for a premium news provider if you choose but it is not necessary.  The premium providers will have longer 
retention and faster speeds but I can get 400K on my ISP's news servers. Doesn't max me out but it's not terrible.   For software try GrabIt and for a news server try freenews.netfront.net   

NOTE: Freenews listed above IS FREE!!"

,maaaaarcuuuuus,2007-12-16T17:36Z,"
hur ändrar man sin spar mapp till NTFS-drivrutin????"
,xyncro,2007-12-30T22:01Z,"Hey DJClub!!, a lot of us are stuck on 99,9%
what's keeping you from seeding the last 4mb??


@mmmaaarrrcccuuusss
Vad menar du med NTFS DRIVRUTINER????
Något sådant har jag ALDRIG hört talas om!!!
Jag misstänker att du inte kan få ner hela den här iso filen i ett stycke, eller har jag fel???

Om jag inte missminner mig helt så kan man inte få ner större filer än 4gb till sin datorn om den använder sig av filsystemet FAT32.
Alternativet är filsystemet NTFS vilket tillåter nerladdning av större filer än 4gb.
Med andra ord, det är ingen 'ntfs drivrutin' man bara laddar ner och sen installerar i sin dator och så helt plötsligt, POFF!! så kan man sen ladda ner större filer, åhh ne!! du får helt enkelt vara så vacker och göra en komplett ny/ominstallation av hela ditt Windows, där du i installationen anger att du vill installera på ett NTFS filsystem istället för det kanske mer åldriga filsystemet FAT32, när det sen är gjort är det bara att tuta och köra.
Lycka till!!"
