,madhouserevival,2007-10-16T21:30Z,"Having connectivity problems, please keep download because I'll get this worked out soon."
,madhouserevival,2007-10-17T01:49Z,"For some reason I can only upload at just under 50 KBS. So I have enabled 1 upload slot. If you max out your download speed by setting it to 0, you'll connect briefly and then disconnect. So, for now set you download speed to match my upload speed. You'll get it fast and won't disconnect so easily."
,madhouserevival,2007-10-17T02:25Z,"Ok, sorry to be a pest, but I've fully uploaded this and got speeds up to 72KB using 3 upload slots. I am now switching to superseeding mode to force peers to share. So make sure your upload speed allows you to share pieces rapidly. I'm still tweaking my connection (cox is never consistent) so I'm trying to increase the upload speed."
,madhouserevival,2007-10-17T03:42Z,"If this download is too slow you can get it directly from http://free.guba.com/download/mpeg4/1/1/2000868668/92%20-%20Baffler%20Meal.mp4

If you have really highspeed uploading capability, then please reseed it to piratebay. My connection is under 100kB, and my peers keep dropping off. I just want to share this!"
,madhouserevival,2007-10-19T05:33Z,"This episode was rejected so never got aired. They did, however, rewrite it and aired it as ""Kentucky Nightmare"", which is the episode I was looking for! You can find it on btjunkie."
