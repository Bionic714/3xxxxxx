This was the first time Aqua Teen Hunge Force appeared, debuting on Space Ghost. The voices were pretty different and the art wasn't fully developed, but it was still very funny. 

The first time I ever watched Adult Swim I saw the Space Ghost episode that had Meatwad and several other characters on it. Everyone got maimed or killed in the episode, and I cannot for the life of me find out what it was called to where to find it. If anyone knows what episode this was PLEASE post it in the comments section.
