,maul_inc,2007-10-17T02:33Z,Thx man! Looking forward to seeing this
,nyx90,2007-10-17T12:27Z,Excellent!
,duhprane,2007-10-17T16:41Z,"Awesome!, now if you would only seed this fucking torrent we could all be happy."
,meshi,2007-11-16T04:40Z,Can someone please seed.
,***Knives***,2007-12-11T01:33Z,i will never be happy
,dalpong,2007-12-16T19:50Z,I cannot share if I cannot even download it in the first place... Says 5 seeders but no activity in 5 days.
,dalpong,2007-12-24T18:38Z,"No problem downloading. Great, exactly what I wanted. I complained of no seeding before, but found that it was due to improper settings (router, firewall, etc.). So, if it's not downloading for you, check your settings -- that's the problem.  Yes, I am now seeding too."
,Pyatin,2008-01-30T08:17Z,"I already had the other movies, so all I downloaded was Mysterious Island, and I've been seeding it for ages now.  Nobody else seems to be seeding anymore.  I'll try to continue the one movie, or I may create a separate torrent just for the lone file.  If you don't see Mysterious Island seeded anymore, look for it by itself."
,ian555,2008-08-18T05:24Z,"great collection of movies. I am more than willing to seed this for as long as it takes, if others will help me to seed this to. There doesn't seem to me many peers for this torrent and I'm having a hard time downloading this.  Not enough people seeding and it's taking me forever to download this."
,plastic_mac,2008-09-28T03:58Z,alright!
,Pyatin,2008-10-24T10:15Z,"I'm still seeding Mysterious Island.  Again, I already had the others, so I didn't DL them."
,Pyatin,2009-01-29T10:34Z,"At times I was the only seeder, but there seemed to be several leechers.  more hit & runs.  Because of the hit and runs, I'm not yet going to seed this by itself.  However, THE ONLY MOVIE you'll be able to DL in this collection is Mysterious Island.  If you want the others, you will need to find them elsewhere.  A shame, really.  However, I still want to keep this classic available for others."
,kabalizo,2009-10-10T16:33Z,Thanks... his SF was pimp (for those days anyway) :))
,cpacibo,2012-02-23T08:10Z,"Somethings wrong with the downloading even though there are only 4 seeders.  Half-way through, the downloading stops and requests to be removed because of faulty files."
