,eXpanderXL,2007-12-18T13:31Z,"ok... so when i install the game, it copies the files, and when it's finished, it tries to connect to the internet to download the latest patch, and it gives a message something like this: ""please insert the original disc, instead of a copy"" and it quits setup.

so what the heck?

btw... no crack, no comments, no info on the release... hope i didn't download 6gigs for nothing.

fahdbhatti, post some info on the torrent next time, it would be useful. still, thanks for posting this and seeding. cheers!"
,d00rs,2007-12-21T12:59Z,"This is what you do:
1.Use Demon Tools 4.10, and activate 2 drives

,cdsmhk,2008-02-01T20:47Z,"Alrighty lads.
This is how you solve this issue. This img that fahdbhatti uploaded do not come with a crack nor with a guide to install and play. 
Before any installation, go to gamecopyworld.com to get the crack(1.0 if you r not going to patch; recommend to get patch and the updated crack). Now follow the exact procedure. Make sure you have graphic cards that support 3.0 shader and dual core processor to run this game.
1. Mount the img using Daemon Tool.
2. Install.
3. The warning pops up which says insert original disk not back up cd.
4. press ctrl+alt+del to open or open the windows task manager.
5. Go to process tab.
6. Close any programs which are bioshock related. Like setup.exe and such.
7. From step 6, you should be able to FORCE close the warning window and set-up itself. The contents are installed except the exe file. What this does obviously, it does not give a chance for bioshock installer to delete the installed files and retrieve your comp to previous stage(prior to installation).
8. Auto-run the img from My Computer.
9. Make sure you see that the ""Play"" button is unlocked and ""Install"" button is disabled. If not, start all over.
10. Close auto-run.
11. Extract the exe crack from gamecopyworld to ""your install directory/BioShock/Builds/Release"".
12. Update and insert new crack by following previous procedures. Or just play. But I noticed that 1.0 ver crashes too often."

To Oddi505, you don't know what you're talking about, stfu."
,Eorlas,2008-02-24T18:36Z,"1. Mount ISO (I recommend Daemon Tools)
2. Install
3. Before the installation looks like it is going to finish, have an explorer window open to the installation directory and be prepared to rename the folder to ANYTHING. It doesn't matter right now because you can go back to naming it bioshock again if you like.
4. When the installation says it's going to check for updates or w/e, RENAME the folder immediately. If you don't the installer will terminate and it will DELETE the folder with the installed items.
5. When the installer is completely done, you can call the folder BioShock again.
6. Download the 1.1 update and crack here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3921767/BioShock.Update.1.1.CRACKED-DETONATiON
7. Install the 1.1 update.
8. Copy crack.
9. Play"

,Dhorse,2011-06-19T00:29Z,"I did EXACTLY what Eorlas said and it worked.
Right after the instalation gauge is complete, but before being prompted to insert the original cd, rename the Bioshock folder to wathever name you want.
(after renaming the folder, you can close the dialog box asking for the original cd)
Then download this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3790892/Bioshock_Crack__WORKING_

and follow the instructions.

Have fun.

Thanks, Eorla."

I'm going to tell you how to make it work just to clear up some confusion since 3 different people have posted ways to fix it:

1. Mount BIOSHOCK.iso (the thing you're downloading)

2. Download this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3790892/Bioshock_Crack__WORKING

3. Now run the installer for Bioshock and when it gets to the part where the error pops up, press Ctrl + Alt + Del and end any Bioshock-related processes

4. Take everything from the crack folder you downloaded and put it into your 2K Games\BioShock\Builds\Release folder

5. Run secu.eg and when it asks if you're sure just click Yes

6. Run Bioshock.exe

it should work because it did for me."

It took multiple attempts to get this thing properly installed. I tried the one method of killing the process from the task manager with NO luck. Not saying it doesn't work, I just couldn't get it it work on my computer. 

I renamed the file and that got it installed. The key was timing the renaming part, before the bioshockpatch part starts to load. I repeatedly hit the button to time it correctly and eventually, windows xp accepted the change.   "

,cwongie,2012-02-08T15:17Z,"Awesome :) 

Btw everyone. Did everything Leetsk33t said. However one thing he forgot to mention is when you alt+ctrl+del, make sure you're in processes and you end both the bioshock auto update thing AND the setup that's going on. This will make sure the thing doesn't rollback any of the installations.
The installed directory should be within your C drive unless you changed it yourself."

Just right click on the BioShock folder and select rename. Wait for the install to say it's updating then just type in a few letters and hit enter. Close the install and download the 1.0 crack and put the files into the BioShock/Release folder. After that download the 1.1 patch and crack and you're good to go!

,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-05-03T01:32Z,"Remember to run the update (included). The cracked exe with this (i'm assuming this is what i downloaded) is for the updated version.

So... 

1. Mount/Burn to dvd

2. Install

3. When installing FILES has finished, it will attempt to update and verify legitimacy - Either force the set-up to terminate (not simply close), or when verifying, go to program files, and rename the 2k folder (or whatever you installed it). Close update if not already.

4. Place cracked files in directory (...BuildsRelease).

5. Run update - if you placed the cracked files in directory already, an error will pop-up saying you have an non-original file - ignore and continue. Finish installing.

6. Run using cracked exe - simple.

Worked perfect for me, no sound issues - win7 x64 "
