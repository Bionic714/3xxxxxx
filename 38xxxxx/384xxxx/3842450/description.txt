A man by the name of Carl Lanser appears aboard a British ship in 1942 with no idea of how he got there or who he is. Gradually, through topics brought up and replied to, feelings of dÃ©jÃ  vu, and props, it becomes seemingly obvious that he's a German submarine officer. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the crew that they are in dangerâ??he frantically tries to tell the crew and passengers that they are under attack, but to no avail, it is agony for himâ?? the boat is sunk by a German U-boat commanded by Captain Lieutenant Lanser. He appears on the German ship with his second in command who asks him if he thinks they are being judged. He replies that the British may judge them. The first mate questions him on whether God is judging them. Then it all repeats, showing that he's been condemned to sail, be sunk, and drown on the ghost of that ship forever. The episode is Carl Lanser's hell.
