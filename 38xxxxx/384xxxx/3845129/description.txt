Rippers note:

PROPER :
The AFTERMATH release is according to nfo untouched
Thats first of all not possible cause only the movie vobs
on source are over 5GB so it needs encoding, if you dont
shrink it, witch isnt allowed.

bitrate are high as you can see on our release but untouched isnt possible.

Secondly theyre menu is all fucked to hell.
If you for example push french in the first part of the menu
it freezes.

We fixed that by removing the first part of the menu cause,
Most languages uses a menu with english layout
some has theyre own language thats linked to the english menu.
for example in the french menu they have a button called
BONUS instead of Bonus material
if you try to edit that BONUS button you get redirected to
the english menu. i guess thats what made AFTERMATH:s release
fucked.
we skipped the first part of the menu since its kinda useless to have.
(You can still choose sub language under SET UP)

Ripped warnings and antipiracy shit.
Removed extras,trailers,Dummys and some audio.

ENJOY this fine proper.
