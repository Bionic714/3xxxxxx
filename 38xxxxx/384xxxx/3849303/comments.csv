,Randallsix13,2007-12-16T22:44Z," Reaperman, I took a quick look, and surprise, you don't even HAVE any torrents to your name. Don't be a douchebag. If you don't like his torrents, bugger off and look elsewhere.

  Don't demean Dopeman for not having anything with any MEANING. Oh wait... These are games. Maybe instead of looking for games to add meaning to your meaningless life, you should get off your   fat ass and get shot or something.

 Dopeman, thanks for all your work, the rest of us really are thankful:)"
,ProgMetal01,2008-01-04T19:48Z,"yo hoganstump, i've got the same problem! when i click on 'play' in the launcher screen, nothing happens!! i've installed dX9 and updated the files with ur new torrents but i cant play :( HELP MEE ;)"
,Satsumomo,2008-02-22T08:42Z,"Hmmm. Dopeman made the Portal torrent that is 300mb instead of all the others that are 2.54GB.

I guess his torrents ARE shit huh? Haha, Reaperman, you are a faggot. MotoGP is an awesome game, go play your ""Need for Speed Underground"" crap."

,xiIix,2008-08-25T20:16Z,"ReaperManT you truly are a fucking asshole. The more compressed the better. Getting up to 10GB down to 1.7GB is fucking AWESOME. Talk about saving DVD's when backing up stuff.. There are the full 4-10GB (multi) DVD images of these games everywhere for your dumbass to download if you don't like these compressed click&play versions. 

It's not their fault your computer is a piece of ghetto shit and takes forever to uncompress a measly game. My rig uncompresses Skullptura's rips in less than 5 minutes. Get a life, get a job, and build a real damn box to game on instead of ripping on skullptura and others for compressing a game beyond the performance capabilities of your rig. Or wait, is it just you being an impatient 14 year old shit stain who can't wait 5 minutes for a game? Either way, you're being a DICK HEAD.

If you can do better then I urge you to do so. Until then continue to keep your mouth-breathing opinions to yourself. Noone gives a shit about you, your slow-ass computer or your room temperature I.Q., grasping at straws as you try's and lead everyone to think you know your ass from your elbow when it comes to computers.

NEWS FLASH ASSHOLE: No one asked you to download this shit."

I agree dude.
Ok i had to learn to, but didn't ask such questions and did found all the help on the web.
When it comes to piracy and downing and playing games, go get yourself a decent pc or put one together like me who can run a decent game(this game is old i know).
For the rest of you dumbasses and lowlife 14year old fucks, go play with your matchboxes instead."
,jessez,2008-11-15T06:15Z,"game works 100% just unzip and click motogp.exe but he f-ed up and didn't include the launcher.exe so to get that just click install and pick any folder while its installing copy the folder launcher.exe that will be extracted wherever you set it to install at, now paste it where you unziped it and press cancel install. now you can change your resolution and graphics :P btw also use dopemans 1.1 update "
,jessez,2008-11-15T06:20Z,"o and ReaperManT we all hate you ,if everyone dls at 120 kbs sec if we get lucky because we get some seeders vs extracting at 100mbs its way f-ing worth it. the other torrents that are non-multi language are at 4.3gigs this is 2.57 do the dang math 5mins to extract the whole damn file so we don't waste 2-14hours dling 1.73gigs dummy!"
,jessez,2008-11-15T06:30Z,"If this game does not work, please don't post here you just don't know how to use a computer or your cpu,gpu,ram,dx, or drivers are incapable ; this game () even require virtual-drives or cracks come on retards."
