Release Notes:

The Belgian music scene gets a lot of international attention. 
When one takes into account the number of gifted bands 
and talented singer-songwriters this does not raise much surprise. 
One of the rising names in this firm tradition is the fresh and innovative formation Palomine. 
Although they had to wait some years to produce their first full length album, 
this band has built out a solid reputation.
