,circlensess,2008-08-04T09:36Z,You should put down which version this is.
,LezDawson,2008-09-29T03:23Z,"Handbrake really is the best ripper I've ever used.  It takes a long time - but don't be fooled by inferior rippers that claim to make good copies with extreme speed - that's impossible unless you have a mega fast processor.

For best copies, tick the '2-pass encoding' box.  Enter a size width that is divisible by 16 (e.g. 624 or 640) and leave the height blank (Handbrake calculates this automatically and keeps the source aspect ratio). 

Put 'cropping' on automatic.  Set audio to MP3 44.1k/112kbps.  Set file 'target size' to 696MB to be safe for CD (it usually ends up a bit bigger). 

This will make excellent copies of films that are around 01:30:00 duration.  For longer films, set the target size bigger.
