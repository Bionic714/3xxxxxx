To convert these files to MP3 files, go to into the Preferences panel of iTunes. Click on the orange ""Importing"" selection and then select an MP3 Encoder for importing. Change the settings to whatever you want. Now, click OK and go back to the main window of iTunes. Select all songs you want to convert to MP3 and click on ""Advanced"" -> ""Convert Selection to MP3"".
