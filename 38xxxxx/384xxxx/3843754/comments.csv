,amazerg,2007-10-28T14:27Z,"Hey, I've tried download this stuff but I don't get any picture, just the sound. Has that something to do with ""VP7"" and what is that?"
,KEGGERMAN,2007-11-04T21:10Z,"To see the video you need to make sure you have the VP7 Codec installed, here is the URL to download it http://www.on2.com/cms-data/downloads/on2_vp7_personal_edition.exe"
,amazerg,2007-11-08T13:11Z,"Yes, I have that downloaded and installed but still doesn't work"
,E30racing,2007-11-08T22:04Z,you have to use winamp not vlc.. i have tried..
,E30racing,2007-11-10T01:35Z,seed plz.. stuck at 23%
,Ateista8,2007-11-18T20:46Z,upload seasons 10 to 14 please
,raymondse,2007-11-27T16:05Z,"@Ateista8: You stupid, greedy dumbass. Simpsons DVDs go only up to Season 10.

To Keggerman, thanks a lot. These are great rips of the DVDs. I wonder, though, why you chose VP7 instead of something more popular like DivX or Matroska. Anyway, I hope Season 9 and 10 comes along soon."
,Closurefin,2007-12-06T16:31Z,"Why do you have to use some weird codec.
Thank god it's free.

I prefer downloading K-Lite Codec Pack Full v3.5.7
it has all the new codecs.
http://www.download.fi/video_ohjelmat/videocodecit/k-lite_codec_pack_full.cfm/v3_5_7
the site is in finnish, but i could be trusted."

,DOREGORE,2008-05-05T20:46Z,"it is no picture, only soudt"
,CaptainBeefheart314,2008-05-10T18:35Z,"To DOREGORE,
are you perhaps using Videolan's VLC MediaPlayer? Because that remarkeable piece of genius media player doesn't work for the VP7-codec KEGGERMAN uses ( see Videolan Wiki http://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_Features_Formats ).
My advice is, forget VLC for this once and just watch it on WMP11 or MediaPlayer Classic.
Still, don't let that take you off VLC on my account: it still is a great little player, VP7 is just too new, and the reverse coding isn't opened up yet.

To KEGGERMAN: Thanks, incredible quality man, you're a champ!

,Xenity,2008-06-07T22:59Z,"Linux users can convert one of these 'VP7' files to a VLC-playable AVI file with this one-liner:
mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o /dev/null && mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:bitrate=950 -o destinationvideo.avi

Change 'somesourcevideo.avi' and 'destinationvideo.avi' to the input and output files respectively.  Requires 'mencoder' to be installed.  For batch processing, see the script on this page:

,Pujan7,2009-01-23T21:21Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent !
I have already downloaded and watched 7 complete Seasons ripped by Keggerman, and currently I am downloading the 8th Season.
All you have to do is to download VP7 Personal Edition (Free) Codec here: 
http://www.on2.com/index.php?615
And enjoy the good Video and Audio quality.
Many thanks to Keggerman
I am looking forward for next seasons."
