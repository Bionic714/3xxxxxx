,SwordOfWar,2008-06-09T21:06Z,"This program does work. Yes it can be detected as a Trojan. If you had read the file description you would have already known that you dummy.

If your ISP blocks port 25 for email (almost all ISPs do this now) you will have to use the mail server that your ISP provides you for email. This program is old and doesn't support email servers that need a password so if your ISP's server requires a password then this obviously won't work."
