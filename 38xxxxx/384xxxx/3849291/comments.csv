Nada menos que la joya de la corona del maestro García Berlanga.

Aunque era ateo (según creo)  que Dios lo tenga en la gloria. Saludos camarada.

,Mercallio,2009-02-24T18:45Z,Subs are decent on: http://www.allsubs.org/search-subtitle/el+verdugo/

They work if you have some spanish knowledge and you just need a little help. They work if you're ok pretending that you're listening to a non-native english speaker translating for you in real time. They work to help you get the big picture of the dialogue.

All I'm really saying is maybe you'd be better off having another go at googleing it :-)"
