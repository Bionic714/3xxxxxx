Essinth's Furry Art Collection. October 2007.

The best of the best, from Essinth's point of view. If the picture's content is good, but drawn badly, it gets trashed. If the picture is drawn well but that's just it - only drawn well, it gets trashed, too. So, over time, the collection just gets better.

The collection is categorised, 0 means non-adult and mostly safe for work, everything above - adult. Which category picture belongs to was intuitively chosen, no strict rules.

Now this collection has an extra category set -- which starts with "a". That used to be for anime-related art, but now it's for anything that's not furry.
