Andrew Weatherall - Sci.Fi.Lo.Fi. Vol.1 (Soma)
Another trip inside the mind of Lord Sabre as he showcases the kind of tracks that inspired the recent Two Lone Swordsmen 'Wrong Meeting' albums. Surf punk, rockabilly and post-punk are the order of the day as Weatherall digs out classics from artists such as Gene Vincent, The Strangeloves and more well known acts like T-Rex and The Fall and mixes them all up into what sounds like the best lock-in you'll ever experience.
