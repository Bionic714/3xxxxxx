,805566,2008-03-18T17:02Z,"Good work. I was about to wait through the queues on eMule till I found the exact same file here.

I'll be using 98lite on this install source to reduce the memory/CPU footprint. Already done so with Me (Process Explorer showed *7* processes including itself!!!), but this should be even lighter.

Thanks for an awesome torrent."

- Can someone please also show me how to put it on, stp by step, Thankyou,"
,AmyGrrl,2008-04-03T22:55Z,I find the best way to install Win98SE is to first prep the drive.... FDISK/FORMAT it.... then boot from the disc and select the option to get to DOS with CD-ROM Drivers loaded... Then make the standard folders C:\Windows\Options\Cabs on the C Drive.... then copy everything from the Win98 folder on the Disc to the Cabs Folder... then run the 'setup.exe' from the setup folder.... this has several advantages..... First you don't have the problem with the 2nd part installation after the reboot where it asks for a disc... this happens because no DOS CD-ROM Driver is loaded.... and Second... the Install files are kept on the Hard Drive so when ever you install something like a Driver and it asks for the Windows Disc like normally... this time it won't need to ask for the Windows Disc... it will auto-get the needed windows files to install the correct Driver...
,samshirley001,2008-04-04T10:33Z,"im going to do something AMAZING with this, i am going to download ubuntu linux for ps3, download qemu for powerpc, and run this in a emulator, becasue xp runs slow on the ps3 due to the 256mb ram, but all of those processors will make it fast for win 98"

,mikeyh11,2008-06-21T14:32Z,"Hey, kenny301 or whatever...

You can't boot from a cd on virtual pc. YOu don't even need a CD!!! What you do is when it says insert system disk or whatever, click on the CD tab, which is next to floppy and next to edit. Click on that, and choose capture ISO image. Locate you iso image and there you go! Or you can choose boot from drive J: or whatever. Booting from the ISO is much easier because you can quit at anytime an continue installation whenever."
