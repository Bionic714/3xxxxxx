This is not technically ""portable"" since it does try to install some compnents in your registry and filesystem. However it is tolerably portable as it needs no more than this DL to work.
Winpooch takes care of the registry and stuff and this version seems to have no real reason to install anything at all.
It's the only version of this godawful program I use."
