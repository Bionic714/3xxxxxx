So please have patience :)"
,jeiroq,2007-10-22T01:18Z,"thank you! what's the quality? 192?

nonetheless I'll be seeding for about a week. "
,busta69873,2007-10-22T05:17Z,"Wow, thanks for the up. I'm a little disappointed by this one. I loved all the previous albums, this one is just OK. I hate the first track, it's horrible and sounds like something off of a Broadway musical. But Almost Easy is good. I'd say out of the 10 tracks, 3 are worth listening too. "
,busta69873,2007-10-22T05:33Z,Can someone post The String Tribute to Avenged Sevenfold?
,Lucian_Valarian,2007-10-22T11:07Z,You guys have like 200 KBP/s of my bandwidth for the next 72 hours...Enjoy :]
,kklimeck102,2007-10-23T06:18Z,"pretty crazy album... theyve incorporated electronic, some big band type music, and even a bit of country into it. This is definitely different then from their other stuff, but it still sounds a bit like city of evil in some ways. these guys are amazing artists, but i do agree that first song does suck"
,piratelucas,2007-10-24T11:08Z,"i know the new stuff sounds a bit strange, it's not the good old A7X, but really if you like the band and are truly a fan of them...you'd like it...i know for sure i do!

Arrr!"
,oknitro,2007-10-24T21:28Z,Thanks guys! wicked seeding! average 320kbps! I will seed for next 3 days!
,anarchyohio,2007-10-25T22:08Z,"Thanks for seeding everyone, just started download and its faster than most torrents here."
,kaltmix,2007-10-25T23:51Z,"Thanks for posting this torrent!!!

Avenged Sevenfold still rocks out loud.  Each album they release is different, but it keeps originality.  All the bull about M. Shadows losing his voice and not being able to scream is not true.  He just wanted to change a little in each album.

Also, go to Avengedsevenfold.com and check out their contest to win a signed schecter guitar and 2 backstage tickets to one of their shows!

Thanks again..."
,grefven,2007-10-26T11:12Z,"Just so you guys know, this rip is fucked. Track number all wrong and everything. First song on the album is ""Critical Acclaim"" and not ""A Little Piece Of Heaven"". Learn to tag your uploads properly damnit.

1. Critical Acclaim
2. Almost Easy
3. Scream
4. Afterlife
5. Gunslinger
6. Unbound (The Wild Ride)
7. Brompton Cocktail
8. Lost
9. Little Piece of Heaven
10. Dear God"
,krim_reaper,2007-10-26T11:41Z,"Fucked? The songs are there, so it's not fucked imo.  And they happen to work. 

And tagging, why not tag them when you finish downloading them? Takes like few minutes of your precious time. World ain't perfect.

But thanks for the feedback!"
,grefven,2007-10-26T11:51Z,"Since this is only your second upload, I guess you are excused ;). 

However, I don't like when people get the wrong ideas of a band this great; ""Little Piece of Heaven"" is wicked bad as first song as some people know will believe...

Tagging is so easy to do before uploading, and there will be no confusing amongst the masses.

Thanks for the upload anyways, cheers!"
,Trivillien,2007-10-26T20:27Z,I'm really disipointed with this album. It's worse then City of Evil. I don't really enjoy any of these songs.
,vill3,2007-10-26T21:08Z,"didnÂ´t like this album at first listening, but after one day of listening to it. DUDE it fucking rocks, almost the best album they done. Go and fucking buy it !"
,thexboy_8,2007-10-27T15:16Z,"Damn, speeds of 450kBs! Thanks! Will seed for 48 hours! It's a bit odd that City of Evil and this one are 'toned down' the same time that they went commercial. I think the record company wanted to sell more albums so they had to go mainstream... Pitty."
,TheBombio,2007-10-28T02:39Z,"It doesn't sound like them...but it sounds pretty good. I like it.

Thanks.
"
,oliviacond,2007-10-29T09:41Z,"music quality is good=)
except i have to edit the tag"
,visions86,2007-11-01T17:50Z,"Can you say mainstream sellouts?  Album's so bad in my opinion. Can't say i want to see them live again, if they are gonna sing that shit."
