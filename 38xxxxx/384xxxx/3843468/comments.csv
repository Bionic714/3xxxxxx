,mattpist,2007-10-31T07:33Z,"wow rhclayto, you're a fucking cock. you're obviously some yuppie asshole that thinks having a copy of this is 'cool'. obviously, you don't need it, and no one else here does either.

i love that you're trying to justify ignoring traindoc's request not to publish the crew change online by claiming we use the dmca... what a sack of shit. we're all far too poor to afford the lawyers needed for that.

also, because of fucktards like yourself, traindoc will no longer be publishing the crew change again, ever. so basically, you've just killed a tool that was useful to poverty-stricken people all over the united states that have no other means of travel or seeking work. thanks, you lowlife piece of shit. hope the 'cool points' were worth it. 

you've never been on, nor probably ever will be, on a train. neither will anyone that downloads this shit. the only purpose of putting this online is to hurt people and their livelihood, and basically hand over information that was helping the poor get by over to the cops so they can put a stop to it, and make everyone's lives a lot harder.

you make me fucking sick. i hope a hobo kills you."
,rhclayto,2007-11-05T02:08Z,"'mattpist':

First, I have never been presented with any good reasons why
it shouldn't be widely available on the Internet.  Some
supposed reasons have been given, but I find them altogether
lacking & ill-considered.  I've already rebutted them to the
extent they merit rebuttal on the trainmaps lists on Yahoo
groups.

Secondly, I will do my part to keep it available on the
Internet, but I am far from alone in undertaking that task. 

In any case, the CC Guide as it currently exists will be
outmoded by a new version I am participating in bringing
about on the Internet.  It will consist of an interactive
Google map & a related wiki.  All the information fom the
present CC Guide plus more will be available in a
convenient, widely available form, & will be kept more
up-to-date than the present guide could possibly be.  When
the new Internet guide is in place, I will no longer put any
effort into keeping the present guide online, although I
can't vouch for what anybody else will do with it."
,rhclayto,2007-11-05T02:12Z,"As an aside, my comments relating to the DMCA threats were not pulled out of thin air: a person by the name of Mike Butt (apropos) was making threats to scare Yahoo into suspending the trainmaps list because it hosted the CC Guide."
,rhclayto,2007-11-05T02:26Z,"Quote: 'wow rhclayto, you're a fucking cock. you're obviously some yuppie asshole that thinks having a copy of this is 'cool'.'

I just can't resist.  I'm probably the only person ever called a yuppie who's also worked in the Arizona cotton fields, as a diamond driller in an underground hardrock mine, in house construction, in an auto parts factory, in a leper colony, as a cross-country truck driver, & many other detestable blue-collar jobs.  What a fool you've made of yourself with your assumptions & frothing."
,Chancellorknuckles,2007-12-13T22:05Z,"The way I see it, the CC was never that hard to come by.  If you hop trains, or have friends who hop trains, someone is bound to have a CC.  Ask them to take you out on a trip, after you've been on a a few runs (or even one!) you get them to photocopy the CC for you.  That's how it's ALWAYS been for as long as it's been put out.  I can't speak for Doc.  But it's always seemed like a safety issue for me.  To get a crew change you have to know people who hop trains.  With this thing out on the web now, any kid can get it into their heads that hopping a train is as easy as finding the right spot.  And, if you really do ride the rails you KNOW it aint that simple.  I'm all for information distributon but not like this.  Haveing the CC up online will turn it into something akin to the Anarchist Cookbook: people fetishizing a source of useful information, but with no experiance to use it.  It's dangerous.  Also, the issue of security culture comes up.  The CC WAS a pretty secret document.  There are many people out there that have no idea people even still hop frieght.  I don't honestly think this torrent will make cops and RRs crackdown, but it can't help.  So yeah...I'm not really sure why you did this.  Your argument about anti-copyright law is bogus.  The crew change is freely reprinted.  Maybe Doc said something to you...I don't know.  But it seems like you just wanted to be the guy to ""out"" the crew change.  So next time I meet some oogle up at Pig's Eye who's got all the ""...information pertaining to trainyards & lines in the US.  Schedules, locations, places to get in & out, the local situation with police, etc..."" but never been on a train, I'll know who to thank.

ps. stay outta Denver."
,miningalupas,2008-03-31T06:16Z,"I couldn't agree more with Chancellorknuckles. Publishing this online presents a danger to any unknowing idiot roaming the internet all of a sudden getting the bright idea that hop a train would be fun and 'cool'. It's extremely dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. There is way more to it than going to a certain place and jumping on. If one dumbass gets killed hopping a train and it makes the news, it will all of sudden be infinitely harder for others to do. Traindocs whole idea with it was to keep it underground and in the hands of people who need it. In order to get a copy you have to be trusted by someone who how has it. Wonderful job fucking his plan to hell. If you gave half a damn or knew anything about hopping trains, you would take this down, or better yet have never uploaded it in the first point.
"
,mjh04hamp,2008-04-01T09:58Z,"he seems pretty gung ho on posting the guide across the internet.  we all know you can't learn to ride freight from a book, and you sure as hell can't learn it from the crew change.  without a doubt, some well-intentioned clueless little kids are going to get ahold of this and end up getting their legs ripped off forever.

now i don't like senseless violence, but it seems like it'd be for the greater good if one of us were to head for that address and make him hurt some.  there's a csx yard out in buffalo, if i remember right.  "
,mjh04hamp,2008-04-01T10:41Z,"and in case any of y'all think ray's some kind of idealist fighting for freedom of information and anarchy and all that, think again.
raymond (aka transit train, rapid t) is a con man who got ousted from the rail-rider community after robbing some kids out in OH, then trying to sell train doc's guide for profit.  he's posting this here for one reason - spite...  ray sees this as a way to get back at the entire freight community, to fuck everyone over.  
now i'm not trying to preserve some kinda elite train hopping community here...  but if you read a bunch of stuff you found on the internet and think you know how to ride the rails then you WILL end up getting fucked, whether you get robbed, raped, fall onto a wheel and lose a limb, railcops catch you, etc.  just make friends with someone who knows what they're doing, and if you're sure you can trust them then ask 'em to show you the ropes.

and anyway, most of what's written up in here is useless nowadays anyway.  rail-schedules change every day, this shit's two years old."
,Cycloptic1931,2008-04-01T23:02Z,"I think one of the biggest misteps about posting this paper, is that folks who live this lifestyle for decades will get put in jail for going to some of the places that are in this book. 

If the cops know where some of these places are because of this kid putting this document up,  the cops googling it, downloading it. Then picture an old timer (who doesnt even know such paper exists) waiting at the same place that they always did, out of the way and safe, cop walks up grabs him and puts him in jail. 

Thanks mr raymond, god you are going to rot in hell for this. 

You know more I think about it I am sure your intentions are probably to do just that, fuck over everyone out on the road, put this document into the wrong hands open it to the world and screw everyone else in the process.

"
,rhclayto,2008-04-25T04:44Z,"Well, I see the paranoiacs, sociopaths, & the logic-impaired have had a small field day here.

I heard all of this before I uploaded it--ad nauseam.  If I'd thought there was a shred of good sense or persuasiveness in any of it, I'd not have done it.  

What do we have here?  Several incitements to violence, both overt & implicit.  The airing of personal grudges against 'Rapid T' (who I am not, although I got this from his now-defunct Yahoo list).  Tiresome dredging up of a man's run-in with the authorities--about which I couldn't care less.  No doubt the security guards were penny-ante thugs, like most of them are.  Speculation about my gratifications in uploading this ('he wants to be cool': weak little argument). Somebody questioned by anti-copyright motives in uploading this.  The fact is some bozos of your ilk were threatening Yahoo vigorously on the basis of copyright violation.  

All of this is pitiable.  The only mildly surprising thing is the virulence with which you spout your toss-away arguments.

The only exception I've heard voiced to putting this online tolerably worth responding to is the idea that it will somehow help yard bulls clamp down on freighthopping.  As I mentioned earlier, this was brought up--with the repetitiveness & half-hearted sincerity apparently necessary to it--on the now dead Yahoo list.  I gave my arguments there, & found nothing in the way of a coherent response.

In short, I don't buy the line of reasoning that this brings much at all of value to a bull who is serious about busting rail riders.  A serious bull already has far more at his disposal in learning the ins & outs of his particular jurisdiction--his yard; that is, he has *direct access* to it, & given a couple weeks of reconnoitering, at most, he will know it like the back of his hand.  He could hardly waste more of his time than by scouring through the hodge-podge of information (most of it already publicly available, or should all of that be shut down too?) in this book that might be of some use to him--he could have discovered many times over far more useful information by direct observation.  On the other hand, the lazy bull, or the one who doesn't really care a great deal, won't be bothered at any rate.  Leaving, it's obvious, nobody who will find any use for this but freighthoppers who exist outside the clubby atmosphere of the 'freighthopping community'.  

Which is really the crux of all this: releasing this runs right against the grain of your elitist attitudes.  It's transparent in most of your comments.  Nearly all of your professed concern for 'kids getting their legs cut off' & the like is directly attributable to your overinflated estimates of your own abilities deriving from your initiated status in the 'community'.  The fact is there are thousands of people who are just as adept at riding freight trains--come, it's hardly a herculean feat--but who are outside your small little (unsavory paranoiac) culture.  They stand to benefit from this.

In my opinion--which hasn't even been scratched by all of the sometimes lunatic ranting you people have slathered throughout your comments--the advantages of freedom of information & its benefits to non-club members far outweigh the extremely minor concern whether this might be aiding the bulls.

For god's sake at least choose some place other than the Pirate Bay for voicing your mania for the restriction of information."
,rhclayto,2008-04-25T04:56Z,"And furthermore, this sort of document is simply interesting, & on those grounds alone it's worth sharing.  I suspect the majority of people who read this will climb aboard a train.  But if they enjoy learning a little bit about all this, more power to them."
,rhclayto,2008-04-25T04:56Z,'never' climb aboard.

We just need to set up nice booby traps in all these places and then come out with a guide for all the true hoppers called ""crew change and booby traps 2008...and local marijuana dealers"""
,getfucked666,2008-05-29T22:16Z,"i'm looking to find/meet up/or talk to kids who hop. i've met a few at shows but that was a while ago and far from here.

there are none where i live and i don't want to be a fool and get myself in shit or killed. nor am i taking a 2 year old crew change from the internet to try and half ass my way through it.

i'm broke, i want to get out of this shitty town, i have no job, i want to travel and meet rad people and the way i see it - riding trains is one of very few options i have. oh and i'm not a yuppie or a stupid 15 year old running away from my parents either. i'm just a dude who wants out.

,bingopajamas,2008-07-08T02:04Z,"geez, i am really fed up with the elite overly paranoid train riders. i think it's life saving that this crew change is on here. did you know that a group of ass hole scumfucks stole my crew change last week? i would have been stuck here forever without this, i don't know my ass from my head in this city, i can't find anyone around here who'll give me a guide or any tips, there's no train riders here. i had to come to the library and cross my fingers on finding it on the web. i dont think anyone was trying to score ""coolpoints"" by posting this, i think it's fucked up that all info isn't free for everyone. sure info can get into the wrong hands, but that must mean we have to take away guides for making bombs and growing marijuiana and many other things too. and as if bulls don't know where sides are, fuck that they know where the hell they are, especially because we've all been using the same ones for years. you just gotta be sneaky. what kind of yuppies are going to look for a fucking crew change guide? i've never met a yuppie who even knew people rode trains. i think that that ""safety"" excuse for not posting it is a load of shit too, the only people who don't know trains aren't safe are probably incapable of counting and rode the special bus in school, and those characters will not be seen in the yard. people who die and lose their limbs are obviously doing stupid shit like hopping on the fly, or hopping out drunk, which i'll admit i'll take a drink or two on the ride, but not too much. i'm sick of train hoppers that think they're accomplishing some huge thing by hopping trains, and that it's soo hard and exclusive, it's pussy shit, it's easy fuck i'm a 19 year old girl who's been hopping out on my own and with friends without the guide for the last 2 years, and i am still hangin' tough, only been pulled off once. and when i first went i had no clue what the hell was going on, but i had to get to denver to see q and not u and i learned. it's not rocket science, actually, before i hopped my first i had no idea that shit tons of people did it, and i remember laughing my ass off at all these kids in oregon because they were making such a big deal out of it saying how hard and serious it is. i guess what i am saying here is thank you for putting this up, it saved me, because i will now know where the fuck the train yard is here. and to all of you train rider kids, get it together dudes, you all are so weird, you're like those young women in high school flipping out over nothing. you never know when you might get fucked out of a crew change and need one. AND DOUBLE FUCK YOU TO THE KID WHO SAID STAY OUT OF DENVER. what are you a fucking gangster?don't be so agressive, i bet if you actually met this guy and knew it was him you wouldn't do anything."

http://www.dataplace.org/groups/group.html?id=1051

2008 has been intresting so far...Rode out to Norfolk VA for Norfolk Southern Shareholders Meeting ...shook hands with Norfolk Southern President Wick Moorman.  My questions about STB regulation hit a home run with him. The STB or surface transportation Board wants railroad to have more insurance against toxic spills on there railroad. The STB is the updated version of the ICC or Interstate Commerace Commision. I also raised concerns about how railroad police have to cover more territory with less officers despite this being a post 911 world. The reason for this was 2 reasons..1-Throw a bone since I was allready in the wolves den.2-Actauly as a train rider on freights and commuter trains the liklehood of terrorsot attacks on our vuerable RR system increses each year and there are better ways to die then having your lungs burnt out by a propane or Clorine Leak....As it happens the responce from Moorman was that NS was keeping NS police near major terminals that have a high theft rate...Eh NYC,,CHI,,,Conway,,,Unlike the CSX Meeting last year were there was a continetale breakfast...all we had was bottled water.
In other news I testified before the STB on Passenger Trains and Common Carrier Laws and my tetsmony is on the Shttp://www.stb.dot.gov/TransAndStatements.nsf/8740c718e33d774e85256dd500572ae5/8b4a6296b0c24cc885257486005f6fb9?OpenDocument Surface Transporation Website......

With deciding who I should let copy my crew change. Should it be a question of money? Should it be a question of experience, or safety or blah blah blah.  I usually opt to be pretty lax about it.  Kind of an anarchist philosophy about it. Like putting it on the internet. But I have said NO!  There are some people who really shouldn't have it. The kind of people who will inevitably be detrimental to the   subculture.  I don't consider myself a train hop'n fool, though I have used her once or twice to do what couldn't be done.  I may one day again (if it's still possible).  So I just downloaded a copy. No more worrying about mine at the beach.
