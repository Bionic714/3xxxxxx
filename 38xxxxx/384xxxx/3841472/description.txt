No. 10 AP ranked PSU Penn State Nittany Lions (Big Ten Conference) going into the season vs the winless Michigan Wolverines for their first Big 10 match. Oh and I upped the resolution of my 16:9 encoding. Sorry for the delay.

Enjoy! See my previous torrents for other PSU releases.

WE ARE ... PENN STATE!

cheers,
