,drusie,2007-10-18T21:28Z,"I just scanned it, and yes it is"
,Rockrollman,2007-10-18T21:47Z,Of course your AV says it's a trojan.. this is exactly the way trojans work... stupid.
,toja92,2007-10-18T23:13Z,"Just to incredible to exsist... example, how the fuck is you supposed to see someone elses webcam?? it's a direct-connection between 2 computers, and your NOT one of them, and you can't catch it... And the size?? 4.95 KiB is just TO SMALL to even do anything useful, except some kind of virus/trojan/spyware.
My advice: DONT DOWNLOAD!"

,mr_minty,2008-02-09T19:20Z,"Akalla ur right m8 Poisonivy is a trojan but its not something you need to worry about too much
For the record Poisonivy is a little Hackers baby its one of the best ways to hack anothers pc espec if there running MSN you can get right in and have a good little look around. grab whatever you want and not be noticed.
Its also a little thing many Police forcers use to enter undectected"
