,giggedyguy,2008-05-31T21:08Z,"Paragon Total Defrag currupted my largest partition so that it wasn't even recognizable. That's the one I keep my downloads on, of course, not to mention my documents. 
This program recovered everything! I've used dozens of programs and this one is the only one I'll ever need. For backups, nothing beats Acronis, though.

Thankyou, Jim!"
