Husker Du Live in London.

Songs:
New Day Rising
It`s not funny anymore
Everything falls apart
The girl who lives on heaven hill
I apologise
If I told you
Folklore
Terms of psychic warfare
Powerline
Books about UFO`s
Chartered Trips
Diane
Celebrated Summer
Every everything
Makes no sense at all
Pink turns to blue
Ticket to ride
Reocurring dreams
Eight miles high
Love is all around
