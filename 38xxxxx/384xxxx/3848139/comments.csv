Thanks for the fast seeding."
,ufcmike,2007-10-20T23:29Z,"That's it?...

Only 7 chapters?

This game was the shortest..

Um.. I went to chapter 7, my first time ever playing HL2:E2 and beat it in under 2 hours..?

What about having to destroy that ""thing"" and then saving that women?

Is this the full game?  This is strange..

I heard this game was suppose to be 2 hours longer then HL2:E1, but it seems as if it's soo short.. I mean, I was shocked when I saw the logo and credits..
"
,ufcmike,2007-10-21T00:19Z,"After reading reviews, HL2:EP2 IS short. (which is the only downfall)

If you're reading this, BUY THE GAME. (It's awesome)

So I've downloaded this and now I can't wait to buy the pack.

I can't wait for HL2:E3.


Thanks again Dopeman for releasing your version!"

,giannidecavele,2007-10-27T21:46Z,"For people having the elevator bug, heres a little trick that worked for me. Only tested it on the chapter 7 bug though. Right the moment before Alyx is gonna press the button, when she's only a few steps away, quicksave the game. She wont get in at this point, but when you quickload she does!"
,giannidecavele,2007-10-27T21:56Z,"Reginald_Yusah --> i did this too and its fairly simple. The sound is inside the ""episode two content.gcf"" in ep2/sound/commentary. extract these files and place them in your commentary folder of ur rip, it is already there but empty, just put the audio files in it"
,YoungRob,2007-10-28T01:39Z,"Guys,

,scottyarch,2008-05-05T01:58Z,"This is the first Dopeman release that I've found unsatisfactory. Was the game stable? Yes. Did it have all textures and models? Yes. The issue was one I haven't seen listed here.

Basically, I was playing along for a while and thought 'that's enough for now' so I shut it down. Later I came back and my saved-games were gone. I looked through the folders and noticed they weren't in the hl2 folder but a different one so I moved them. Now they show up but I can't use them. Nor can I start a new game.

OK, I wasn't that far along so whatever. I reinstall everything and still I can't start a new game! I update my DX9 drivers, reinstall a second time no luck, with or without the saved games. I click on the game it just goes back to the menu. I click to start a new one, back to the main menu.

I'm not trying a different release of HL2e2. Hopefully it will work. Maybe even with my saved games... Who knows. Needless to say I'm very disappointed. Does anyone know what my issue was and how to fix it? Just in case this other release has all the issues Dopeman's didn't."

But there seems to be a bug. It is when you are at the white forest inn, the place where you get an ambush. When I have finished killing the soldiers, there is always one of those big things on two legs left. And they always run to a place where I can't reach them. If you go into the house and continue straight forward you get a stair to your left and some windows in front of you. To the right were I can't see them they run around. Basically I can't continue. And when I do kill it, another one comes and starts to run around there. What the hell should I do? I have loaded from an earlier save but I still got the same problem.  "

I've put it on my external hard disc (recently bought), along with all other games I presume standalone (i'm not stupid).

Whats more, it works as a charm while trying to play it from the drive, but thats more a compliment to the disc rather then this.

Nonetheless, works as a charm, Alyx indeed doesn't get in the elevator near the end, but the savegame fixes that. (seperate torrent from dopeman)"

,SapphireMP,2009-06-22T08:18Z,"lol, well, EXCELLENT rip, BTW, though for me I had to tweak things just a bit. Others may have this same problem, so I'll tell you how I fixed it:

First off, I ran into the slight problem that the game started up into the wrong DirectX mode, and I got a requirement error message about that. Normally, I would simply change the argument given to hl2.exe to ""-dxlevel xx"", where xx is either 70 for HL2 and HL2E1, or 80 for HL2E2 (because as far as I know, it doesnt support 7). However, I can't get the main exe to start properly, only the provided PLAY_2.exe or whatever it was called. 

So, I simply opened that program in a hex editor and located the run command for ""hl2.exe -game ep2"" (in hex), and added ""-dxlevel 80"" after that (in hex) with the program, then saved that. And yay, it worked! Now it starts in DX 8.

Also, thnx for the SAVE file, I did encounter that error, but that fixed it beautifuly."
,SapphireMP,2009-06-22T08:20Z,"Also, bring up console with ~ key in game. Make sure to enter command ""sv_cheats 1"" first, or cheats won't work."
,SapphireMP,2009-06-22T08:24Z,"Ah, one more thing. Should Alex or the Vort ever refuse to continue, just run into them or talk to them a couple times, then move forward again, and eventually they will follow you. I ran into this a couple times, but it was easily fixed by just moving them physically around and then continuing. The only time this didn't work was the elevator sequence near the end, but that's what the SAVE file is for. :)"

,sdfasdad,2009-07-19T05:32Z,"Wanted to address some of the issues you may experience:

If they refuse to enter an elevator/use it quick save and then load it will fix the error. However this may also happen near the end of the game where you ride the platform with Alex and her dad (their facial expressions freeze in an amusing fashion). In this case you must run away from them when they begin talking... out of earshot down the hallway and return a minute later when they are done. They should continue onwards.

In the battle where they ambush you in the house you may experience a part when nothing happens. If so head outside to your car, you will see a smaller building across the street from the house. Toss some grenades in there a combine soldier hiding inside must die... or at least be injured so that he runs outside and attacks you. Once dead it will trigger the final part of the house fight and you will be able to continue"

When i first started the game i had very low fps, so i started trying diffrent video options, like i did in episode 1, there at first i had 20 - 30, but after 60 - 100, so i started reducing graphics, nothing helped, then i started to try out diffrent resolutions, and accidentaly put 1080 x 1920 and the game closed, when i try to open it again i see the first video where the guy has a red cranse in his head and it turned by 90 degrees and after that an error pops up saying ""Failed to create D3D device !"" and the game closes, so i cant change the resolution in the game i tryed to find cfg files or options.ini smth like that but there isnt such a file ! i tryed deleting the file, cleaning reestr and unarchiving it again, the error is still there, and i can't do anything about it, i tryed a lot, so can someone tell me how to get this fixed ? how to change the resolution without entering the game ? or where the temporary file with the users graphic options is hidden, because it's really strange that even after deleting and unarchiving the game still has the same graphic option's, like the are written somewhere on windows, not in the game folder "

I think this has been mentioned here before. Alyx and Eli are supposed to follow you into a lift to go down to the missile silo. But after they finish their conversation they just freeze with weird expressions.

People on this thread have said 1) save and reload, 2)quicksave and quickload, 3)play it again and run into the lift as soon as it opens, and 4)play it again and run away as far as possible as soon as they start talking, not returning until they're finished.

None of these are working for me, I've tried saving and reloading loads of times too.

Are there any other ways to fix this?"

,anichu,2011-11-19T22:52Z,"I'm not the type to complain as this shit is free... but this stuff is buggy... ran into trouble in ch.1 (was solved by reloading a save), ch.6 (was solved by positioning myslef infront of the elevator), but could not solve a glitch in ch.7 (alyx would not enter the elevator for fucks sake!!!). Sorry, my final assessment has to be buggy!!! try to find a better rip..."
,pusepatten1,2011-12-12T01:31Z,"Somehow when i enter the chapter after ""Under the radar"" and gonna enter the elevator thingy in the silo after meeting with Alex's father, they are freezing, anyone been through this?"
,Fawers,2012-01-27T01:28Z,"Downloading. If it works, I'll seed for a month."
,Fawers,2012-01-27T04:33Z,"It worked fine on my 7. Tomorrow I'm going to test it on my XP.
Anyways, I'll seed a) for a month or b) until some error occurs. In this case, I'll let you know."
,Fawers,2012-01-28T01:57Z,"It didn't work on my XP as good as it did on my 7 but, this was expected. Plus, I didn't witness problems such the white screen this time (which is good in many levels). Since I didn't start playing it for real yet (still playing EP1), I couldn't witness any major problem. Thus I recommend it."

,dundun12,2012-03-22T18:18Z,Call me stupid for asking this question but is unrarring the same thing as extracting? I always wondered about because people would always be using different words and it always had me confused.
,LUNAXD,2012-03-24T00:48Z,es muy bueno ya lo descargue gracias por el aporte 
,LUNAXD,2012-03-24T00:51Z,"hola me pueden ayudar cuando  intento subir un torrent me sale  La imagen es demasiado grande, por favor, utilice la función de cambio de tamaño al subir la imagen  que puedo hacer para poder subir mi torrent saludos!"
,Goodgooglymoogly,2012-03-29T02:30Z,"Works, but with the usual painfully slow loading times associated with all the half life 2 rips I've come across. In the chapter ""under the radar"" there is a glitch where combines and hunters trap you and they are supposed to come get you but they don't. Just turn on no clip mode, go outside until you see them start to attack, and go back to the house with Alyx. "
,jackelman,2012-04-08T03:46Z,um is there any easier way to start the game i clicked the play_ep2 thing it worked great! but do i have to wait about 5 minutes everytime for it to load that or is there an easier way?
,jackelman,2012-04-08T04:33Z,and also it doesnt save
,papin97,2012-04-16T07:56Z,"This exe file is virus detected!
If you want to play quickly and virus-free, simply find hl2.exe on internet and add

-game episodic

Example

""C:Program Files (x86)HalfLife2_Ep2hl2.exe"" -game episodic"
