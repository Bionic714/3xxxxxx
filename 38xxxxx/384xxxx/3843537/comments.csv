,noirehtagemot,2007-10-17T22:15Z,"Thank you for the uppload, but can you please not .rar it next time? It doesn't actually do anything but waste both your and my time, and for some reason the rar files are allways broken making it difficult to unpack."
,Dmiaf,2007-10-19T03:39Z,"I have never had any problem what so ever with these RAR files... (and I'm not even close to being good at computers and stuff like that)
