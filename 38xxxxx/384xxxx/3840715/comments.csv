,danl125,2007-10-21T00:46Z,"Anyone have this working on HDLoader?  I loaded it up and just get a black screen.  I tried states 1 2 and 3 (with 3 being the recommended for normal GH2).

Looks like an amazing song list, can't wait to play through it."
,theomen9,2007-10-21T05:53Z,"damn, i play electric guitar and im so used to playing One the way the tabs say and playing it on here is so much harder."
,VW-Racer,2007-10-22T17:42Z,"I've beated
""Kiss - Detroit Rock City""
""Weird Al - The Night santa went crazy""

on expert, but ""salieri strikes back"" and 
""go go power rangers"" are tooo hard for me on expert. :(

what programs have you used to making this dvd?

I wanna try adding easy, medium and hard modes on every track.

Or maybe if you wanna do it?
would be real nice of you."
,mrspock09,2007-10-22T20:01Z,"lol yea theyre hard. but sorry i'm not good at making charts just making the custom disc. the programs you use are GHex, (which i also uploaded here on TPB) you use that to change songs, CD/DVD Generator, Apache 3, and a media burning software of your choice (MediaNow, Alcohol 120%, DVD Decrypter, etc.). all of these things can be found at Scorehero.com in the custom songs forum, but you'll probably have to sign up to see it (its free so what the heck :P) and theres also a tutorial there for making and importing custom songs. the only other thing i could tell you is just print out that list i made of all the songs that have other difficulties and play them until you get used to expert."
,VW-Racer,2007-10-23T10:16Z,"Thanks, I was in that forum a short while a few days ago, I found the list with charts for songs with E/M/H/X and downloaded a bunch, and its mp3s... now, do you have a msn-adress and want to help me put together a disc for GH?

I really want some new tracks to play before GH3 comes in stores =)

If you dont wanna type your msn-adress here, then pm "" JohanL "" at scorehero, that's me.

MVH / Johan"
,VW-Racer,2007-10-23T20:53Z,"I figured it out and am soon ready with my own
disc for GH2, can't wait!
pretty much 10 bonus song left to put in and then test it.

every song is in E/M/H/X and my the most of my all time favourites!!!
besides the most of them have co-op, bass, lead, rythm e.t.c. :D

3 or 4 songs are from this one ;)

IF i put it up as a torrent, I will type the songs
came from you, but I think I'll keep it to myself."
,mrspock09,2007-10-24T03:45Z,you should post it. i have a lot of friends that cant play expert and an all difficulty hack would be awesome.
,acetabulum,2007-10-25T04:39Z,"I'm about halfway through downloading.. I'll definitely seed for a long, long time when I finish."
,mrspock09,2007-11-10T17:19Z,and dont pay any attention to the stats at the top. there are seeders and leechers to download from!!!!!
,CynicVash,2007-11-15T08:03Z,"How Do you work this thing?

dl, burnt, not working, my Ps2 says ""please insert a playstation2 format disc"".

Help?!?!"
,mrspock09,2007-11-15T22:06Z,"CynicVash, you have to have a modded ps2 to play burnt games, such as a modchip, or swap magic."
,CynicVash,2007-11-16T10:34Z,what if i use a boot disc?
,mrspock09,2007-11-18T05:20Z,"that should work too. swap magic is a form of a boot disc, or i guess you could use some other brand, as long as it works"
,mrspock09,2007-12-11T01:21Z,"hey thanks downloaders for seeding! its been a great help, and please give me feedback on anything you can think of, so i can make an even better gh2 hack, or i may even start a gh3 hack if enough people get me motivated"
,avengethebeast666,2007-12-15T19:32Z,what does seed mean>????
,mrspock09,2007-12-15T22:15Z,"seed = what you do after you finish downloading, and you help other people download so i dont have to do it all myself"
,FlowindaTorrents,2007-12-19T00:33Z,"Is there any specific burn speed this Iso needs cuz it finishes burning, I use my swap magic, then it doesnt work! help?"
,FlowindaTorrents,2007-12-19T01:01Z,oh if it helps i use Active ISO burner to burn it
,mrspock09,2007-12-19T22:20Z,"the best speed when writing any game dvd's is usually 4x, cuz the ps2 only reads that for me. 2x and 6x have never worked that i can tell"
,FlowindaTorrents,2007-12-20T02:48Z,k did it at 4x speed thanks dude!
,hotspark91,2008-01-17T04:27Z,i downloaded this torrent but i need help with burning onto a blank DVD-R...... is it possible to burn it using Nero 7 or do i need a different program
,mrspock09,2008-01-18T02:23Z,"hotspark91, i use dvd decrypter, but pretty much any burning software should do, just make sure its a 4x burn with a dvd-r"
,hotspark91,2008-01-19T17:35Z,alright thanks cant wait to start playing these songs :)
,Dark_Lord_Alucard,2008-02-06T23:03Z,I have magic ISO will that work
,mrspock09,2008-02-09T23:38Z,"it should, as long as it can burn it to a dvd-r"
,TaKeIt4fReE,2008-02-27T07:37Z,where do i find charts that are already made? and dont just score hero because i cant find them there to
[V],RadioActiveWeasel,2008-03-15T20:37Z,"works flawlessly.

if you need a good program use ImgBurn. its free and its amazing. burns everything.

"
,chainy666,2008-04-10T01:51Z,I burn all my ps2 games with DVDdecrypter. Burn at 2x on dvd+r. Burning on 4x dont run smootly because ps2 drive read max 2x. Depending on what dvd drive you have to choose between + or - dvd. Cheap versions use dvd-r. Best drive read both. This is only good way. I burned over 1000 games like this.
,Nympheti,2008-04-21T19:54Z,"Rofl, POKĂŠMON! :D"
