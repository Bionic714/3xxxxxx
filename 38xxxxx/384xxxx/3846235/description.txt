Arthur Curtis is a businessman. One day, he finds his phone no longer works, and is surprised to hear a voice yell, "Cut!" Suddenly he is faced with the fact that his office was actually a set on a soundstage. He is told that "Arthur Curtis" is merely a role he was playing, and that his real name is Jerry Raigan, a declining movie star. He tries to find Arthur Curtis's house, but cannot find any evidence of it; Raigan's agent tells him that the show with Arthur Curtis in it is being canceled because they believe he has had a nervous breakdown. Raigan/Curtis rushes back to the set, which is being dismantled, and demands not to be left in the uncaring world of Jerry Raigan. Raigan's agent shows up on the set to find Curtis/Raigan has vanished.
