but i have some questions
Does it have any subtitle??
and has extra material??"
,contradiction,2008-12-11T15:16Z,"Nope, no subtitles (but it's in English), no extras either. The only extras I have seen were on youtube. I think from Korean release (which also have Korean subtitles I think), but I prefer my European one, since Korean have some scenes of the movie cut out. "
