2nd Pack of Scorehero Chart conversions for Frets on Fire

Here's another eclectic set of songs that I was able to find the charts or midi files to on Scorehero.

My favorites out of the bunch I have noted with (parenthesis) around the Song (#) - meaning you should try these irregardless if you know the song or not. The rest are still alot of fun to play but might not be as challenging or intricate.

More than half of these Charts needed extensive editing and tweaking to get them to sync up correctly. There may still be a few glitches or off notes that I missed or didn't feel like dealing with. Feel free to tweak them further.

The Original Scorehero Charts are included in case you want to start from scratch - #OG_Charts-Guitaraoke #2.rar
