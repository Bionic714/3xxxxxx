,zombiflesheater,2007-10-26T20:56Z,Can't seem to get any sound - there is only 20 seconds worth of sound and then it dissapears - have you any ideas Robin? 
,Robin_Hood,2007-10-28T21:08Z,Try Power on at your loudspeakers ;-)
,zombiflesheater,2007-10-29T13:44Z,Dont patronise me fool - I've contatced you for help - there is no sound after the first 30 seconds on all 6 box sets
,zombiflesheater,2007-10-29T14:02Z,Apologies - The sound works fine on Windows Media - It has problems for some reason on Nero Showtime. I am seeding all 6 box sets. I also have numerous more Bud Spencer & Terence Hill movies which I will upload if anyone is interested incl. Troublemakers
,Robin_Hood,2007-10-29T20:08Z,"I know that all movies have sound.
This collection is my gift to all of you for all great movies that we can download an watch. 

If you have more Bud Spencer & Terence Hill movies why dont rip them and share them with us.  After that you can imagine all hours of work it was to ripp and rar this collection.

Share and be happpy :-)"
