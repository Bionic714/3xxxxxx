I've been stuck at 98.6 (in fact there are 5 of us all stuck at the same point) for a week...can we get another seed?  CK, are you still out there??  We need your help.  Thanks for the upload and I hope we can get this completed!!
Later, Scheu."

thank you"
,scheu2112,2008-03-28T23:33Z,"Could the original uploader please reseed?  The ""seed"" shown in the torrent is firewalled and cannot provide the final 1.4% needed by all who are attempting to complete this d/l.  Everyone is still stuck at 98.6...
Thanks, Scheu"
,scheu2112,2008-03-30T03:15Z,"Well, this one seems dead.  I went over here:
http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/29532432/Omen+Battle+Cry?tab=summary
and now have the album already d/l'ed.  I was able to go in to my client and select this album to come down first and then just turn all the others off.  Only took me about 1.5 hours to complete.  Pretty sweet after waiting like 2 months for this one to complete..."
