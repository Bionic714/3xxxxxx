,dargonhuman,2010-06-17T02:02Z,"+1 to StonieTonie.  I've been using Office 97 for years.  I tried some of the newer Office versions, and they're crap.  I couldn't figure out how to do half of the things I can do in 97, and the half I could figure out wasn't worth the effort.
I, like a lot of people these days, don't have time to re-learn everything I need to know to use these programs effectively, so it's just easier to stick with what I DO know.  If you don't like it, then yell at the programmers for changing how everything works in newer versions."
