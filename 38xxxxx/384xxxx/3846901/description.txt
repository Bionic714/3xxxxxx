WarAnthem-Demo (Broken audiofile no 2 fixed on this torrent)

Swedish Black/death metal from around 1996.
Members from Unanimated and Dark Funeral.

Drums: Unknown
Guitar: Johan (Jojje) Bohlin (From Unanimated and Zebulon).
Guitar and base: Poppe (Member in Dark Funeral for a short time).
Keyboards: Joakim (Jocke) Westman. (From Unanimated).

WarAnthem existed only for a short time. War Anthem was the project name.
One demo was made but not released.
Only a few copies was spread around to the bands friends, and finally to me.
This is a demo not recorded in professional studio, however the sound is very good for a demo. 

The sound is dark, slow and powerful. You can also hear the typical sad keyboardsound from Unanimated recording \Ancient god of evil\.

Inspirations from: Desultory, Dismember, Dissection, Disharmonic Orchestra and more...

Format: mp3
Quality: 192kb/s

Hopefully this will work this time.

(Do not download earlier published torrents as one audiofile was cut of before the song was ended.)
