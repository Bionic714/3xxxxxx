,Scudmeister,2007-10-14T16:21Z,"The nine alleged errors in the film
# Mr Gore claims that a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet would be caused by melting of either West Antarctica or Greenland ""in the near future"". The judge said: ""This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore's ""wake-up call"". He agreed that if Greenland melted it would release this amount of water - ""but only after, and over, millennia"".""The Armageddon scenario he predicts, insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future, is not in line with the scientific consensus.""

# The film claims that low-lying inhabited Pacific atolls ""are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming"" but the judge ruled there was no evidence of any evacuation having yet happened.

# The documentary speaks of global warming ""shutting down the Ocean Conveyor"" - the process by which the Gulf Stream is carried over the North Atlantic to western Europe. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the judge said that it was ""very unlikely"" that the Ocean Conveyor, also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation, would shut down in the future, though it might slow down.

# Mr Gore claims that two graphs, one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years, showed ""an exact fit"". The judge said that, although there was general scientific agreement that there was a connection, ""the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts"".

# Mr Gore says the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was directly attributable to global warming, but the judge ruled that it scientists have not established that the recession of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro is primarily attributable to human-induced climate change.

# The film contends that the drying up of Lake Chad is a prime example of a catastrophic result of global warming but the judge said there was insufficient evidence, and that ""it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors, such as population increase and over-grazing, and regional climate variability.""

# Mr Gore blames Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans on global warming, but the judge ruled there was ""insufficient evidence to show that"".

# Mr Gore cites a scientific study that shows, for the first time, that polar bears were being found after drowning from ""swimming long distances - up to 60 miles - to find the ice"" The judge said: ""The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm.""That was not to say there might not in future be drowning-related deaths of bears if the trend of regression of pack ice continued - ""but it plainly does not support Mr Gore's description"".

# Mr Gore said that coral reefs all over the world were being bleached because of global warming and other factors. Again citing the IPCC, the judge agreed that, if temperatures were to rise by 1-3 degrees centigrade, there would be increased coral bleaching and mortality, unless the coral could adapt. However, he ruled that separating the impacts of stresses due to climate change from other stresses, such as over-fishing, and pollution was difficult."

I honestly hope that someone has the forethought to note who took what stance when it mattered.. maybe Google will help.. but on that day, I hope your families starve, you children die of thirst and you burn.  You chose to be ignorant when something still could have been done.. you should be punished you fool.  Anyone who ignores the obvious issues, is a fool that deserves to perish.. you make the rest of this country look just as stupid.  The global community thinks that all Americans are as stupid as the republicans that think Al Gore is a swear word.. you people are pathetic.  Oh thanks for the war.. maybe your George Bush will push all of us into WWIII you stupid idiots.  Higher gas prices than Carter, higher spending than all former presidents combined - conservative?, more prosecuted corruption and scandals than any former administration... a leader that can't speak complete sentences and that has to be coached through any scripted interview.  Yeah you fools really did a number on our economy, soaring national debt that dwarfs any former.

,RevanDK,2007-11-04T15:12Z,"Afew facts:
Global termatures are rising. And warmest in millenias

Ice caps are melting

Oil production will peek in the near future (meaning oil will get more and more expensive after this date because we will have reached the point were we could produce the most oil and people still want the same oil amought or more as last year)

CO2 is affecting global warming yet it is abit unclear how much

Afew considerations:
Are we willing to risk continueing down the road using oil witch might leade to a series of unknow climachangs? Perhaps worsing natural climachangs?

Would it really cost anything in the long run to change to a more  relable energy source except for large oil compaines and car maufatures?

Wouldn't it be stupid to only run coal and oil plans for electricy and cars until we run out of fuel insted of starting to change parts of our production of power and transportation to things can will run also in next decade?

Means to creat alternative power is nuclear (witch has alot of waste problems and risks) and renewable engergy like solara, wind and water. Fusion eneger is still at its infancy and will be for decades yet, it is not going to save us ITER says 2050 soonest for commical plants

Worst case isn't abit rising sea levels, and more extrem weather in the long run it is Venus (the plannet) witch has an exstrem green house effect an has temperatures higher then mecry witch is the closest to the sun

I am not sure how much I belive the global warming is made by mankind and how much it natural. But why gamble with these kind of stakes? To save afew bucks? A little more luxoury? 

Think the deniers of global warming is like a blindfolded driver doing 90 mph on the freeway saying this has been going well, so I think it will continue to do so...

Weather Channel Founder: Global Warming 'Greatest Scam in History' 
Intro by Joe D'Aleo, Icecap, CCM 
I was privileged to work with John Coleman, the founder of The Weather Channel in the year before it became a reality and then for the first of the 6 years I was fortunate to be the Director of Meteorology. No one worked harder than John to make The Weather Channel a reality and to make sure the staffing, the information and technology was the very best possible at that time.  John currently works with KUSI in San Diego. He posts regularly. I am very pleased to present his latest insightful post. 
By John Coleman 
It is the greatest scam in history. I am amazed, appalled and highly offended by it. Global Warming; It is a SCAM. Some dastardly scientists with environmental and political motives manipulated long term scientific data to create an allusion of rapid global warming. Other scientists of the same environmental whacko type jumped into the circle to support and broaden the ""research"" to further enhance the totally slanted, bogus global warming claims. Their friends in government steered huge research grants their way to keep the movement going. Soon they claimed to be a consensus. 
Environmental extremists, notable politicians among them, then teamed up with movie, media and other liberal, environmentalist journalists to create this wild ""scientific"" scenario of the civilization threatening environmental consequences from Global Warming unless we adhere to their radical agenda. Now their ridiculous manipulated science has been accepted as fact and become a cornerstone issue for CNN, CBS, NBC, the Democratic Political Party, the Governor of California, school teachers and, in many cases, well informed but very gullible environmentally conscientious citizens. Only one reporter at ABC has been allowed to counter the Global Warming frenzy with one 15 minute documentary segment. 
I do not oppose environmentalism. I do not oppose the political positions of either party. However, Global Warming, i.e. Climate Change, is not about environmentalism or politics. It is not a religion. It is not something you ""believe in."" It is science; the science of meteorology. This is my field of life-long expertise. And I am telling you Global Warming is a non-event, a manufactured crisis and a total scam. I say this knowing you probably won't believe a me, a mere TV weatherman, challenging a Nobel Prize, Academy Award and Emmy Award winning former Vice President of United States. So be it. 
I have read dozens of scientific papers. I have talked with numerous scientists. I have studied. I have thought about it. I know I am correct. There is no run away climate change. The impact of humans on climate is not catastrophic. Our planet is not in peril. I am incensed by the incredible media glamour, the politically correct silliness and rude dismissal of counter arguments by the high priest of Global Warming. 
In time, a decade or two, the outrageous scam will be obvious. As the temperature rises, polar ice cap melting, coastal flooding and super storm pattern all fail to occur as predicted everyone will come to realize we have been duped. The sky is not falling. And, natural cycles and drifts in climate are as much if not more responsible for any climate changes underway. I strongly believe that the next twenty years are equally as likely to see a cooling trend as they are to see a warming trend.  See John's full blog story here. "
,oooocanada,2007-11-25T19:01Z,"1) Gore is not a scientist. What he is doing is just voicing onw opinion. You may decide to believe it or not to believe it. It's your choice, same like if you decide to go to college or not. Since many of people who voiced so far their negative opinions seem to be born procratinators, they are most probably those who don't have college or university degree. 

That's fine with me, I don't have a problem with your choice. 

2) Gore picks up certain things that may or may not prove to be 100% accurate in the future. But why some people feel personally attacked by this movie? Is it that the movie proves the point that human nature is such that people don't like hear things where they have to change (often) painfully (with self-sacrifice) the way they think and live. Individualism is very strong among people. Having to give up that meal or taking bus instead of a car is hard. Even to the expense of health. Perhaps that's why half of people in developed nations (and particularly in the US) are obese. They are caricatures of modern society. That's where the over consumption and inability to change our own lifestyles becomes most apparent.

Special note to Gore haters:

Don't download movies from internet. They might damage your computer and your political orientation.

Cheers.

The planet has survived and recovered from many tragic events such as super volcanoes, and even major meteor impacts.

 I am totally for all clean fuel and energy conservation! keep researching the technology and using it. But I do not believe we are causing whatever global problems there are on this earth.
A last note to all you America haters... without us this world would be a piece of crap dangerous place to live. Without our industrious nature and all the contributions medically, scientificly ... this planet would be a very different place and not a pleasant one.

,Glenn-G,2007-12-18T05:06Z,"After reading some replies on here and other forums, it still amazes me when people go, ""Oh, humans have NO part WHAT SO EVER in Global Warming"" or ""Global Warming? Pfft.. Doesn't exist"".
I mean, just recently there's been articles about how polarbears are vanishing because of the decrease of seals, caused by the warmer weather for a longer period. And still, people go, ""orly? Don't believe it, those Polar bears are prolly hiding somewhere"".
I mean, get serious. You don't have to be a genious to put two and two together in the matter of pollution and the earth growing weaker.
And longer dry's in India and other countries? Warmer summers? Warmer winthers? I mean, when I was younger, we had snow every winther for days. Now, it barely snows two days out of a whole year. But then again, I bet the snow's just hiding, right?
The Global Warming is real, it may not be so serious right now (Katrina was also just a little wind, no biggy), but if we don't do something, we're just gonna make matters worse. Last time I checked, humans weren't exactly healthy for the earth."
