E Na Mu Laya
Yes to the river,
E Na Mu Laya
Yes, Yes!
E Na Mu Laya
Yes to the Master
E Na Mu Laya
Yes, Yes, Yes!

I can feel it in my heart,
I\'m back where I belong.
The clouds have rolled away,
The healing has begun.

No time to lose,
No time to waste,
No time to count your tears,
No time! No time!


White Clouds

We are moving the way
Of the white clouds
Home to you.


In the Light

In the light of the morning
As the New Man arises
As we dance
And we sing
In the sun and the rain.

In the light
Of the morning
As the New Man arises
Every living thing, Osho,
Is whispering your name,
Osho.


Crazy for You

We are the people
You are the one
Now is the moment
At last.

Osho!
I\'m crazy for you
What else can I do?
I\'m crazy for you.


Heart like the Sun

The heart like the sun
Is always shining
Ever present
Everywhere
You can try but you won\'t
Stop it rising
So let your love fill the air
Come on.


Oh! Your Love

In the middle of the darkest night
I see I\'m filled with light
My heart is singing freedom.

In the middle of the brightest day
As I move along my way
My heart is singing ...

My heart is singing ...
Freedom.
Oh! Your love is all around.


Watching Your Vision

Every day I wake up
Watching your vision unfolding
Everyday I\'m amazed -
Amazed at this flower that\'s growing.
Living in love every moment,
Every step of the way.
Osho, through your grace
I\'m watching your vision unfolding.

In Wonder

In wonder
I stand in wonder
At the miracle of you.


The Narrow Road to the Deep North

Music recorded live in Buddha Hall based on Zen Haikus


\"These haikus are not 
out of the mind. 
These haikus are 
reflections in a mirror, 
in a no-mind.

The silent heart 
the summer moon
the dawn very close ...\"

Osho
1 
There ...
he goes ...
walking through the mist
onto the rainbow

2
River
one long line
through snowy fields

3 
Moor:
point my horse
where birds sing

4
Yellow rose petals
thunder - 
a waterfall

5
Immobile haze
moon, spring, sleep

6
Coming from nowhere
departing for nowhere
a flashing glance ...
entering the mystery!

7
Moonlit plum tree
wait,
spring will come

8
In the light after sunset
he climbs to the temple
at the summit

9
An old pine tree
preaches wisdom
and a wild bird
is crying out truth

10
A cloud over the lotus ...
and the silence
