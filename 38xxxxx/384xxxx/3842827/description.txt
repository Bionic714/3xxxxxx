EliteSwitch is made by me and ONLY me. It is made in Visual Basic 6.0, and is an almost replica of SwiftSwitch, except for the fact that i've added Cheating Utilities and Functions to make it more suitable for my needs. I originally started making this program because i was sic of having to see Ads in F2p Worlds and waiting for a world to be empty before i could get into it, since then it's turn into a fairly big project with over 50 regular users daily. I suggest that if you use SwiftSwitch that you try EliteSwitch and i guarentee that you will instantly be hooked to this Client and Uninstall SwiftSwitch immediately. EliteSwitch is updated regularly to fix problems that jagex make when adding new worlds and site pages etc. EliteSwitch's Auto's like the Auto Buyer and Auto Tele'r are under a total makeover .
