The same file, but about 6.5 MB, not 3.24... This file may be incomplete."
,jonerkinch,2007-10-16T01:55Z,"i have played this game file through to game completion.
it is the full game."
,James.Denholm,2008-03-27T10:22Z,"You idiot. 3.24 megs, that's not at full game! Be wary, I reckon it's a virus. Not even rar can compress something from 600 megs plus down to 3.24 megs. Be wary if you actually download this."
,inhabit_yo,2008-06-18T18:49Z,"no, YOU idiot. if you knew anything about this game you would know that it comes from a time when a 4mb game was normal and 600mb was a madman's dream. this is right and it works, full game"

,Virtual-R,2009-01-30T17:56Z,"Yes, I can confirm that James is an idiot. This game is from 1993, when CD-games was as rare as good-smelling-poo"
