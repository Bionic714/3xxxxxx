The quality is old video tape but nice to watch. Video is interlaced and blocky. Audio comes out of mostly the left side and has high frequency tape hiss.

To make it significantly more watchable, you can try deinterlacing/deblocking the video and centering and equalizing the audio to remove the upper frequency hiss. For example, with mplayer:

mplayer ""Mysteries of the Gods.avi"" -af center,equalizer=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:-12 -vf pp=fd/ac

Thanks again! :)
