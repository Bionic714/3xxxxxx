,Zinedin,2008-05-04T12:04Z,"Now that I got this one, I will be seeding it for at least next 6 months. Keep on downloading! And please do seed it, if you're not in a ""not enough space"" crisis. Happy downloading! :) And remember, seed it for at least a week or a month."
,Zinedin,2008-05-16T22:16Z,"I will not be seeding this any more. I'm sorry I've changed my mind. Why not you ask? There is no reason to do so since Season 2 DVD disc 4 is stuck at 97,2% and has stayed like that for several days. Also, Season 2 DVD disc 6 is stuck at 99,9%! Believe it or not (or try it)! So both disc 4 and 6 are just about dead now and out of circulation. So why keep seeding disc 5 then when you can't get the rest of the set? People want to watch the whole damn thing, not just parts of it. So I will stop seeding this one. Instead I suggest you get this release:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3901624/Numb3Rs_Complete_Season_2_HDTV_Eng

This one saves you a lot of disk space too. 8.2 GB compared to 6*4.37=26.22 GB. That's one third the size of this one. There's also a video (avi) file for every single episode, making it more efficient and faster way to distribute it. The only disadvantage compared to this one is that it got no subtitles. But hey, you know what they say, you get what you pay for. So you better get used to it.

And! Learn english! :) Even thou there is a Swedish subtitle with this release from Kalin1102, I never turned it on, instead I turned on the English subtitle to understand better English. English is the new interlingua of the world! I understand Swedish like my own first language (i'm not from Sweden), but Swedish is pretty much useless outside Sweden (or outside Scandinavia). But with English you can talk to the Gods! LoL! :P Look at us here at TPB just for instance, TPB is powered by some genius dudes from Sweden, but everyone is writing in English, swede or not. Well, you get the point of how nice and important it is to understand English. I try to learn as many languages as I can, with French and German being the second and third after English. Totally I speak and spell in five languages, more or less.

I hope you enjoy the show as much as I do. It's totally awesome! It's just so... geeky! I hope Season 4 won't be the last one. Take care!"
