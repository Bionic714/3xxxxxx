,q8pride77,2007-10-15T21:59Z,"it should be working..

i am currently seeding three torrents and have set the maximum upload rate for @ 1000 kbs"
,death734,2007-10-15T21:59Z,is this a mixture of DVDRips and TVRips?
,q8pride77,2007-10-16T00:15Z,"yes..

1-2 DVDrip
3 TVrip
4 DVDrip
5-6 TVrip

but the TV rips are great, the channel logo is barely noticeable and the picture quality is great even at full screen.."
,q8pride77,2007-10-22T01:34Z,"is everyone downloading this ok?  i've changed the max upload limit to ""unlimited"" and i'm only seeding to TWO out of NINE peers at really really low rates! (under 10 kbs)"

,q8pride77,2007-10-25T22:01Z,"is there something wrong with the pirate bay tracker?

,augusta66,2007-10-28T11:26Z,thx for the upload.....but not a lot happens after I passed the 9 % mark.....needs seeding....badly
,q8pride77,2007-11-01T12:28Z,"yeah im doing my best.. but its still showing that im seeding.. there are actually 13 leechers at the moment.

,fefe15,2007-11-25T09:51Z,"How Do I Download It ?
It Isn't Working Can Somebody Tell Me Please
How To Download It"
,Jinola,2007-12-09T16:49Z,"Thanks a lot for this. 90% in five days.
Just out of curiousity, how fast have you been uploading? Because I was only connected to the seeder for about less than 1/4 of the time and wasn't getting anything above 5kbps.
Thanks again though, from what i've seen the quality is really good."
,cairns1986,2007-12-12T01:07Z,"hey im having major problems with this download i got up to 75% which was fine then suddely download became slow and ive had my computer on 24/7 for a while now and ive got to 95.4%, but since i got over 90% ive been getting download speeds of 0.1-5kb/s i can get well over a 1000k/bs usually and also the torrent is going from 95.4% up to 95.5% at about 80-115 kb/s then going back down to 95.4% and back to 0.1-3kb/s  and wont go further can anyone help me i really want to finish this download thanx"
,Jinola,2007-12-12T19:40Z,"cairns1986:
This is because whilst going up to 95% you were downloading from other leechers. Now that you have gotten to the point that everyone is at, you are only downloading what we have to offer as soon as we get it, as there is only one seeder at the moment we are all getting low rates, but by tomorrow many of us will be finished and then we can seed to everyone else downloading so that they get smooth speeds from 0% up to 100%.
I've only seeded up to 0.572 so I have a lot of seeding to do to ensure that there is a flow of the fresh prince. But I think that many downloaders have already seeded up to 1.000 or more, so they have the right to just leave as soon as they're done downloading."
,cairns1986,2007-12-13T01:05Z,hey thanx for reply jinola i really appreciate it im now at 98.2% and ive uploaded to ratio off 0.979 so far im just scared it goes to 99.9% and stops ive had that before as from the beginning ive never had one seed allways been 0 but have lots leechers usually about 90 but thanx for your reply mate!
,q8pride77,2007-12-15T12:41Z,">>Jinola, I have my uploading speed set at UNLIMITED. And thanks for replying to cairns1986. I wouldn't have known what to say.

Hello peoples!! I'm happy to see that some are almost finished downloading this and are planning to seed as well.

I'm going back to my country for Christmas break so I won't be seeding until Jan 7, 2008. However, there might be a couple of hours of seeding here and there but don't count on it.

Thanks!"
,q8pride77,2008-01-07T23:52Z,"I am now back to full-time seeding.

I appreciate those of you who have seeded or are currently seeding.  :)"

,DominoKev,2009-04-16T01:54Z,"What is seeding and leeching?? i would ""SEEED"" if i knew how"
,tmu1988,2009-05-10T02:23Z,Seeding means you don't delete the file from Utorrent after you have downloaded it. So people can download it from you. That's seeding. Thank you for this torrent. Going to download it. It's the best ever!
,tmu1988,2009-05-11T11:34Z,"Nice, said data error after 19,5% of downloading.. FFS...."
,Flaminhaz,2009-05-28T21:51Z,"Some people are really stupid.. 20.52 GB means that it will be seasons 1-6, unless they weren't compressed when they were ripped, which is highly unlikely"
,alibabag420,2009-06-15T17:16Z,"Baby if u seed it for me.. i seed it for you

,jmenafra,2009-07-20T05:28Z,"how do i get this to my itunes??
can someone please help me"
,Demosthenes928,2009-10-03T12:57Z,"@jmenafra
You want to get ALL of this onto your iTunes (and your iPod I assume)? Buddy, that's gonna take a long ass time to re-encode 20 whole gigs of video. Well, if you're adamant about getting this stuff onto your iPod, I would probably suggest Videora or RipBot. Google is your friend in order to find these and figure out how to use them."
,Texworld,2009-12-25T16:07Z,seed seed
,KISSfan50,2010-02-28T21:29Z,"Damn, Ive downloaded this over 3 weeks, now it's 96%...."
,rincewind1990,2010-07-26T11:11Z,"I got a problem with the final two episodes.

i've downloaded everything else just fine but for 6-24 it says the file size 60.07 MB and that 6-25 is 0 MB so i was wondering if anyone knew how to fix this and get the last two episodes?"
,hawtsauce,2010-09-10T14:10Z,Seed People Seed Please! Seed!!!!
,Mikuhly,2010-11-22T14:40Z,Great upload but PLEASE SEED!!!!!!
,Froggy22,2011-02-13T16:54Z,Plzzzzzz Seed!!!!
,kelseyparnell,2011-03-04T03:41Z,mega slow download i gave up downloading this as it was just to painful lol and just watched it at http://www.thefreshprinceofbelair.org as it saves wasting time
,dizzyduck,2011-05-08T08:27Z,Thanks for the upload. Excellent quality. Took me less that 24 hours to download.
,negleh,2011-06-17T23:33Z,"I WAS uploading at 1.2mbps to everyone (put my upload speed on 0), but since everyone seems to limit their upload speed to below 30, I am doing the same. Then you'll see sharing is caring, no excuses. I share internet with 6 people but I at least 1:1 up and down, you guys are being stingy."
,afsjaan,2011-10-23T16:45Z,I seeded this whole thing 1:5
,goatrodeo,2012-01-21T05:54Z,i am running my seedbox on this torrent with 10:1 ratio.
,PauloFran,2012-02-02T20:51Z,"Very nice video quality.
Thank you!"
