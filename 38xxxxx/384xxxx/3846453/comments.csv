Thanks for sharing!"

,dougaldog2002,2011-06-21T21:51Z,Thank you! One of my favourite books as a teen! Will listen to and enjoy this on my daily commute. I've often wondered why this was never made into a film.
,Hirudinea,2012-03-05T12:53Z,"This is one of my favourite stories, this two-part audio-only adaptation captures the mood pretty well. There are a few short audio dropouts but the quality is fine. Even though I know the story like the back of my hand, parts of this still give me goosebumps! Thank you for the upload :-)"
