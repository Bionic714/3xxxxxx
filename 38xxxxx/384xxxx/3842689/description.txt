OK, it's time to start a new series.  The long wait is over.  Now something a little different than my past Top Gear DVDs that I've posted.  Included in this .rar is:

- The first two episodes from series 10 on DVD.  October 7, and October 14
- Full Menus with Music Background by Sarah McLachlan feat. Thievery Corporation
- Dolby Digital Intro
- Dolby Digital 2.0 Sound
- Fits on one single-sided DVD
- High Quality Front, Back and Inside DVD Covers (For CD Size Case)
- Back Cover has Synopsis courtesy of www.finalgear.com.

Enjoy...and in three weeks, look for disc 2.
