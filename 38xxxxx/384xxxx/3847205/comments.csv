,d3adly,2007-10-18T18:08Z,there isnt a free version anymore.
,Kulturgubbe,2007-10-18T18:42Z,"The thing that the uploader of this so called AVG say´s ""there isn´t a free version anymore"" Well. That´s just b-shit....
There is (I checked that 2 minutes ago)....
Grisoft has an AVG Free Advisor site there you can get it. I give the link here....

 I have tried both the free AVG and a legally licenced copy of AVG Pro and protectionvise they both protect very good, only that the free version have slightly fewer options....

There is always safer to download a free and 100% working AVG Free from the makers site instead of one of the amny AVG Pro´s that have been floating around here.
To the thins written here by Dodge34 (with who I´m agree) I can also add that many of the AVG Pro´s I have downloaded from here have been trojan hors code-modified ones :-("
,Kulturgubbe,2007-10-18T18:45Z,"Oh, and by the Way. There´s no such thing as an AVG Pro. 7.7.490 (They still are on 7.5-series)
This one make thinking peoples get the smell of virus in ther noses from miles away...."
,Rolfy,2007-10-18T19:15Z,AvG Antivirus - NEW RELEASE ??? LMFAO !!! He means New Released VIRUS !!!
,kerti,2007-11-20T18:04Z,Last time I had a free version of AVG it only worked as a trial. I was sooo pissed when that happened. Granted that was like a year ago now... So either I did something wrong or they brought it back.
