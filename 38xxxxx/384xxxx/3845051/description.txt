I made this DVD for my 3 year old daughter, the movies include,

Mermaidia
Fairytopia
Swan Lake
Nutcracker
Princess and the Pauper
Rapunzel

All on one DVD5 size disc, just burn and enjoy.  The DVD is set for auto play (will play the first movie when you put it in) sequential playback (will automatically play the next title after one is done) and Loop playback (will repeat the dvd).  If you want to access the menu just hit the "title" or "menu" button on your remote.

The quality is good watched it on my 51" projection TV, and was quite impressed with the quality considering there is 6 movies on one DVD.

The audio is stereo.

ENJOY!
