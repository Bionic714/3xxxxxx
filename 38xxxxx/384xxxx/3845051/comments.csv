[T],XeroxAlto,2008-06-11T17:50Z,Just wanted to give a thumbs up. Totally watchable. Kids dont care if it isnt in HD! Saves space and saves from switching DVD's all of the time. Thanks again!

,mymaples,2008-11-27T16:25Z,my dvd players will not play disc-one says that this is not formatted for my area (RCE !). Which area was this torrent submitted from?
,Vader--,2008-12-16T15:33Z,"Warning...If you want Quality rips of these movies this torrent is not for you.
 The avi's of the same rips are much better quality. I will give 7/10  for video and 9/10 for audio,but when you rip a cartoon they should be perfect.
Thanks anyway Newbee01"
