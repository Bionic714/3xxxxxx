WarAnthem

Swedish Black/death metal from around 1996.

WarAnthem existed only for a short time. One demo was made but not released.
Only a few copies was spread around to the bands friends, and finally to me. 

The sound is dark, slow and powerful. You can also hear the typical sad keyboardsound from Unanimated recording \\\"Ancient god of evil\\\".
