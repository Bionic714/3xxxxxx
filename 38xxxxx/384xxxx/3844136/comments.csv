,moviemessenger,2007-11-13T04:38Z,"Is it just out of sync, or is the video quality bad as well?and before I get comments saying download and find out or go and watch it at the cinema, I live in the country 30 miles from my nearest cinema, I have no transport, and due to being disabled and receiving a pension, I have a monthly download limit with my ISP, and rely on comments made so I can download descent quality movies."
,supercatski,2007-12-03T20:30Z,"honestly moviemessenger,get off your moral high horse, seen you cut and paste this sob story a few times now. i live in the country, and have a DL limit, the whole idea of these sites is to share, how many have i DLed that turn out shite. still gotta do your share, if there aint no comments, move onto the next movie like the rest of us. we are all basically stealing and breaking many laws doing this!!"

,moviemessenger,2007-12-24T05:02Z,"""supercatski"" I don't have a ""moral high horse"" and I'm sorry your offended by my ""sob story"" as you call it, I was only making an inquiry, and giving the reason why, as I like yourself have downloaded shite torrents many a time, as long as it's decent quality I'll download, I don't expect dvd quality. after all their free. A Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year to you and everyone on TPB   "
