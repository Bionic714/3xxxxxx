Certain that a nuclear war is imminent, a scientist (Fritz Weaver) and a pilot (Joe Maross) plot to steal an experimental spaceship and escape with their families to a planet eleven million miles away. They are almost stopped by a government agent (Edward Andrews), but manage to overpower him. Once up in space, they wonder what their new home will be like. From radio broadcasts, they know it is called Earth.
