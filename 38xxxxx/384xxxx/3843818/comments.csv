,BlackLaval,2009-04-10T23:33Z,"I think this book IS feminist.
I understand feminism as form of reasoned criticism on the way human societies since the early stages of history (and probably prehistory) extort opression and unequality based on sex and gender. The basis of the unequality, I think, are economical and ethical, and they affetc BOTH  SEXES.
Quiten notably, they affect in a harsher, more degrading and violent way to women. But, we men are also affected, being emotionally and sometimes legally castrated and mutilated.
And machismo is not a form violence exerted by men over women, it's exerted mainly by men (but with the active participation of most women) over women, specially, but also on men."
