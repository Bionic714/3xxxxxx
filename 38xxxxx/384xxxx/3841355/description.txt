Producer, singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist... Ken Andrews it's a kind of man that never get enought. in the early '90s with Greg Edwards formed FAILURE a '90s songwriting team practically unrivaled within the claustrophobic confines of post-grunge American Rock, later joined forces with some friends and recorded a one-off release of cover tunes under THE REPLICANTS and producing/engineering artists like Ednaswap, Skycycle, and Blinker the Star.
In the 00's release two new projects called ON and YEAR OF THE RABBIT as heavy on layered synthesizers and electronic percussion and light on the incredible guitar-based material meanwhile remained very busy producing and mixing for the likes of Creeper Lagoon, Sense Field, and Tenacious D.
Secrets of the Lost Satellite is the first solo album released in March 2007 and touring actually over US.
