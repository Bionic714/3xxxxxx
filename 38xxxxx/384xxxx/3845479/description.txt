This is the sound from the Husker Du Live At Camden Palace video. The files are mp3. I am working on a VHS-rip of the video,and will post it later if it turns out okay.
The Songs:

New Day Rising
It`s not funny anymore
Everything falls apart
The girl who lives on heaven hill
I apologize
If I told you
Folklore
Terms of psychic warfare
Powerline
Books about UFO`s
Chartered Trips
Diane
Celebrated Summer
Every Everything
Makes no sense at all
Pink turns to blue
Ticket to ride
Reocurring dreams
Eight miles high
Love is all around

Enjoy and please seed when you`re done!
