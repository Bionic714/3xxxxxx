Walter Jameson, a professor, has the gift of eternal youth, and is engaged to a young woman named Susanna Kittridge. The woman's father, Samuel Kittridge, discovers the truth after recognizing his future son-in-law in a Civil War picture. After his request to share Walter Jameson's immortality is refused (Walter does not know how to share his gift with others), he refuses permission for his daughter's wedding. In spite of this, Walter and Susanna make plans to marry. However, Walter is shot and killed in his office by an elderly woman, apparently one of his many wives and consorts through the years (portrayed by Estelle Winwood), whom he had abandoned when she grew old and frail while he remained young. Professor Kittridge enters the room in answer to the gunshot, where he sees Walter on the floor dying. Upon his death, Jameson's body turns to dust.
