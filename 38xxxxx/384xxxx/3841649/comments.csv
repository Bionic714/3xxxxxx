,No_faith,2008-03-23T13:13Z,"I have some problem playing this with VLC, some files just wount play, and some just stops after a few sec. "
[T],[D],2008-04-05T23:58Z,"If anyone would bother to read the nfo, which nobody does of course, you would see the files are meant to be played in a certain way only (due to some space saving techniques). VLC is not supported."
,Wroo,2008-07-19T01:16Z,Is there an english dub in 720p?
,greenbeanz,2008-07-27T03:10Z,"I'm quite new to this, how do i play these once downloaded? Having trouble with the file type"
,asphperlx0101,2008-11-01T01:17Z,"wow. thats HQ 1280x696 
You rock !"
,technocancer,2008-11-28T18:23Z,"I'm new to mkvs, how can I overide the font of the subtitles? I hate having different font styles with several colors on the same movie, just white arial is perfect for me"
,bakaonna,2008-12-28T01:19Z,"Please warn of possible problems in the torrent description ( since you said that the karaoke and signs are hard-sub, you could have mentioned the codec fine points ); since there is no warning it follows there is little reason to selectively download the info beforehand and check-up, and, in this case, somebody with limited technical knowledge, limited administrative access, technical problems, or insufficient time would spend 15 GiBs ( for a 1:1 ratio ) without any gain for themselves."
,Pirate_Insurgence,2009-04-22T21:58Z,"I DL'd the 1st gig and it was awesome, great quality - had both English Dub and subtitles so you when you look at it they did a great dubbing job, i think i only found 1 thing that they left out in the entire season but it was miniscule.
I was hoping for the same thing here but apparently that isnt the case - DL'ing this one because it has 20x better Video quality than AVI....
Fuck avi :(
plus i can handle reading subtitles xD"
,Anyr,2009-06-01T19:44Z,"Magnificent quality, I prefer the English dub of GitS, but the only problem with this is it's missing an episode. It is missing Episode 2, Night Cruise!"
,issorg,2009-07-20T11:44Z,"Nice Job only for PC...because this shitty filter is for windows only...F*=k yeah....bravoo...next time make it available just for one country or even for your small town only.....

AND dont bother mention that in the name of the file or description....thx a lot"
,mediaphile,2009-08-28T10:48Z,"@issorg:

This works just fine on a Mac or anything else that can handle MKV and h.264."
,Hiram_2010,2010-07-05T15:17Z,"Something worth mentioning that no one has in the 3 years this torrent has been around, is that it is missing an episode. It's a 26 episode anime, there's only 25. Episode 2 is missing.

Other than that, the quality is awesome, great upload. Pity I can't find the second episode in the same quality level."
,cambraca,2010-07-06T01:34Z,@Hiram can you post the link here if you find that 2nd episode in this same quality? thx
,Hiram_2010,2010-07-06T09:38Z,"Did a bit of hunting for the episode, turns out someone missed it or something. So no 720p version of episode 2 exists. Damn.

Here's the link to the discussion:

,Hiram_2010,2010-07-06T09:40Z,"...spoke too soon. I found a torrent with the file in it, can't vouch for it though.

It's 700 meg for the single episode, so I'd suppose the quality is actually better than these episodes."
,Hiram_2010,2010-07-06T09:42Z,"I should probably wait a bit longer before I post my comments next time. Found this site that has each episode, in better quality as a pack or individually.

,BrokenEmpires,2011-02-01T08:24Z,We want 720p in english + all the movies + FLAC soundtracks and + the score in FLAC + posters and interviews all in one torrent. and make sure the rips are not size specific rather best quality possible. lots of bitrate and slow and precise encoding. thankz.
