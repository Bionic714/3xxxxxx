Parody group P2PCRACKERS have come up with the goods in Google Earth 4.2. (Btw, love the NFO :p) Most of you know what Google Earth is so there?s no need to get in-depth about it, but basically you can look anywhere on the globe thanks to some nice little (Well, rather large) satellite photos. New in 4.2 is the ability to look into space. Anyway this comes in 3 archives, and includes a patch.

From popular destinations like Maui and Paris, to the reaches of the universe, to local restaurants and schools, Google Earth puts a wealth of Earth and space imagery and other geographic information right on your desktop. See satellite images of your childhood home, read articles from Wikipedia, or view images of distant galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope.
