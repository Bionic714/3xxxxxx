,antil0ck,2007-10-18T05:22Z,"The Reason these torrents are broken up are that there are over 60 gigs of files all together. 

By uploading them as single files, I can Seed these and start new seeds much quicker. Otherwise, It would take a few weeks to download a 60 gig file. But I am glad that you are at least downloading and hopefully contributing.
