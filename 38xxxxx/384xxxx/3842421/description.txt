Mike Ferris, a man in an Air Force jumpsuit, is all alone in a strange town. He searches all over town trying to find someone. He finally collapses, pushing the "walk button" at a stoplight. The "walk" button is actually a panic button, and Ferris is an astronaut-trainee in an isolation booth. He has been in the booth for 484 hours, and has been hallucinating the whole town.
