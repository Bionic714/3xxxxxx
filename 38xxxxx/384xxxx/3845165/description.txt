    This is another best compilation you'll ever find. It has tracks from 
    many already established well known artists and bands the like of Lamb,
    Hybrid, BT, Evolution, The Future Sound Of London, to name a few. It
    encompases many musical styles that tronik members enjoy so much that
    they are completely engrossed in music. Something about ambient drum n 
    bass music that lends itself to a female lead vocal, serious progressive 
    house music that rocks many dancefloor, tunes that are served chilled,
    a blissfully epic tune enriched with piano melodies, layers of
    traditional percussions and electronic drum samples, emotionally 
    powerful deep house tune, and a moody tune that combines experimental 
    sound collages and groovy sound of electronica. All those combined makes 
    this experience a must for electronic music fans. This is a dynamic, 
    compelling electronic soundscape that you should never miss. It is very 
    easy to slide into a trance listening to all these music. Join us in the
    uplifting dance and sense the beauty of diversity in this magic album. 

    Enjoy!

    Xcellent progressive acid breaks, this tune also happens to be the best
    mix of "Calm Down." Omg!! This tune still sounds fresh today. Not only
    that, it's guaranteed to cause serious damage on the dancefloor.

    Label: Superstition

    Year: 1997
    Ripped by: Bluefish

    Surprising to many people, this tune is not much different from the 
    Oliver Lieb Original Mix which is already hard to top. It sounds 
    much like an edit to me. But, it's not the 7" edit. This kind of full 
    credentials artist could have made it better. If you are really curious 
    what this one sounds like, now is the best time to grab it.

    Early bleep classic from Gamble and Crawford. This was the eigth release
    on the Network label. This track was inspired by Joshie Jo Armstead's

    Written and produced by Richard D. James

    This is the first track I ever heard by Richard D. James, and I was
    hooked.  Musical genius?  Twisted skitzo who lives in an abandoned
    bank?  Probably both, but damn he does some nice ambient-esque stuff.
    This track is a prime example. From the album "...I Care Because You Do"

    Year: 1995
    Ripped by: Bluefish

    One of my all-time favorite tunes, "Chris & James' Fox Force One" is the
    mother of all epic house. Released on one of the most revered labels in 
    the history of progressive house, Stress Records, this tune was one to 
    prove that Stress was a serious player and vanguard of club culture. 
    For anyone who has heard "Fox Force Five," this tune is just an 
    instrumental version of it.

    FSOL. Cascades. Not sure there is anything I need to say about this
    track. I've included the 'Shortform' mix here to leave space for all the
    other excellent tracks my colleages have put forth. Definitely is and
    will always be in my top ten.

    I don't know why such a beautiful tune as this one never got an
    official release. Fade Mix is also very cool. But, this one pull a 
    stop to all mixes. For those of you who haven't got this tune, this
    is your chance.

    Ripped by: Bluefish

    This tune is one of the earliest Manchester's wonderboys productions 
    that that never got released officially. It's a remarkably well produced 
    chilled experimental track that incorporate some interesting elements. 
    This tune also proves that Evolution is not just a master of progressive 
    house. Having been producing for more than ten years and since Sasha's 
    very first remix with them, Evolution is always ready to take dance 
    culture by storm. This tune illustrates the creativity that can be 
    cracked out of their heads.

    Not content with melting our ears with the gorgeous 'Gorecki', the Lamb
    duo prove yet again that they have the perfect formula to reduce grown
    men and women to tears. Stunning breaks coupled with an ultra moody
    heart-wrenching vocal. Stunning!

    The video for this track used to get a lot of play on AMP in the
    mid-90's.  That was back when MTV didn't completely suck, and actually
    played decent music late sunday nights.  I had to do some searching
    to find this cd back then, and would probably be hard pressed to find
    it at all today. From the album "Spatial Specific"

    Saint Etienne - Pale Movie (Secret Knowledge Trouser Assassin Mix)

    Year: 1994
    Ripped by: Urban Angel

    Even before I seriously got into progressive house/trance/epic (whatever
    you want to label it!) I've been a big fan of St Etienne. Sarah
    Cracknell's vocals are just so sublime, perfectly dancing over the retro
    rhythms put together by fellow members Stanley & Wiggs. I was introduced
    to this mix by the 2CD compilation Casino Classics and instantly started
    tracking down old releases hoping I could find more of these excellent
    remixes. A classic IMHO, always around and about when I'll looking for
    something with a beat. They even manage to slip in a sneaky vocal clip
    from Crossroads!

    A beautiful track for those blissed-out summer days. Subtle downtempo
    breaks intertwined with some clever drum-n-bass textures all topped off
    with a stunning vocal and haunting saxophone. Grab a chilled drink, kick
    back and relax ...
