,ph3xxa,2007-10-19T10:30Z,"cheers for another up of optimistic - cant wait to see it! 
hope all ppl from the other non-workin copies find their way over to this one...

have never tried to burn a DVD of such files on my MAC, hope it is no problem... or is it?"
,ph3xxa,2007-10-19T11:02Z,"oh, and does anybody know why this torrent does not show up in the search on this site?"
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-19T15:40Z,"Thanks!
I will seed this movie fully and after that if it works for everyone ill put up some more movies.
Sorry about the file format its the only one that works! for some reason.

Absinthe Films has done great movie and a great job i protecting it so you will have to work around it!
i don't think it should be a problem on mac!

I will seed for i while i think its up in like 30% right now and ill try to get it to 50% until i take a break!"
,gumsel,2007-10-21T21:30Z,Thanks..It's great..
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-22T01:07Z,"I cant seed the whole thing right now.
I have to take a break will start seeding in like 10 hours.
I just broke the 10 GB upload on this torrent."
,bernsteez,2007-10-22T09:48Z,"Hey uioplkjhbnmm, thanks for putting this up man!

Can anyone else help seed this? I'm at 98.4% but it is either craaawling or not moving at all. I'll seed it once I have it.

I don't think I have a monthly upload limit since in the last 11 days I've uploaded 95GBs and downloaded 65GB...what provider are you with?"
,bernsteez,2007-10-22T09:50Z,"A note though, to download my seeds you must have an encryption-compatible client..."
,rostad79,2007-10-22T17:49Z,thanks so much mr uioplkjhbnmm!
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-22T18:35Z,"I have used my client for like 6 months now and have almost 500 hours running time. Totally i have uploaded 65gb and downloaded 70gb.
I download with 500-600 kb/s and upload with about 80 kb/s. so 10 GBs might not sound allot to you but to me its allot.
I cant seed all the time I'm sharing my computer and therefor i have to take breaks like that.

You are welcome mr.rostad79.

does anyone want any other movies like.

Does anyone have 端bermovie? if so please post it."
,sensiskrap,2007-10-22T21:26Z,"hey uioplkjhbnmm, what do you mean by a encryption-compatible client? 
good download, but wont play or burn (mac user)
says its encrypted. what encryption-compatible client do you recommend? "
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-22T22:13Z,"How to burn this with MAC. 

1. Run toast 6.X
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3406247/Toast_Titanium_6.1_for_MAc_OS_X_Final.sit
2. Select the DATA tab
3. Under the disc options window tab, select ADVANCED
4. Select ""DVD-ROM (UDF)""
5. Select ""New Disc"" and name it with 
Optimistic
6. Add your new VIDEO_TS folder to the disc.
7. Add or create an AUDIO_TS folder, even if it is empty.
(Some players like to see this folder)
8. Burn (Use slowest speed you can stand to wait for)
DO NOT USE THE ""VIDEO"" TAB. This is for creating VideoCD, or DVD from video files such as MPG, AVI etc. It is NOT for burning DVD from ripped files!!! This is something MANY
people don't understand!!!
8.5 In version 6.0.7 I believe you CAN burn a ""DVD From
VIDEO_TS Folder"" from the Video tab.

That's it! 

I have not tried this my self because i dont have mac but this is what seems to be workin.
look here:

Does anyone have an explanation to why its this way?"
,sensiskrap,2007-10-23T00:26Z,"yeeeha, thanks uioplkjhbnmm, 
great write up. "
,ph3xxa,2007-10-23T13:29Z,"fellow mac users...
if you dont want to get toast, I used the freeware ""DVD imager"". then just burn the image e.g. with your Disk Utility... worked like a charm for me.

really great film btw! 
big thanks to uioplkjhbnmm, esp. considerung yr circumstances (upload rate, shared PC..)"
,gumsel,2007-10-23T18:26Z,"I just saw the dvd and it's AWESOME...great quality, but man..what an action..WOW. Keep 't coming. If you need some older releases, i might have it. Please PM me if i you're looking for something."
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-23T21:29Z,"Thanks ph3xxa for helping all the mac users out!

2sensiskrap: The encryption you are talking about is the reason i had to repost it 3 times until i cracked the encryption for Windows and since i dont have a mac i couldn't fix it for mac. Sorry but with the help from ph3xxa everyone can watch it.

2gumsel: Thanks yes indeed i was able to cut away 1/3 of the size with a very small quality loss. A great rip if i can say it myself!
Thanks but i think i have most of the older releases i want! thanks any way!

Once again if anyone has 端bermovie please post!
Its the only movie im missing this year and im out of money. "

,infantryclothing,2007-10-25T22:13Z,"i successfully downloaded this and i'm wondering if there is anyway to creat a single .iso file of the files? if not is there anyway to play it straight through without have to click on a new scene each time? (i used nero showtime and it didnt work, i clicked on each file but it'd never play straight through)"
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-25T22:57Z,"2infantryclothing; Just burn it(with nero, Look at
t instructions) to a DVDR disc and watch it on your computer or DVD player."

,watuse,2009-02-24T19:45Z,"well what I did with a mac was take the video_TS and burn it with burner and very slow speed and it worked for me. so I am guesssing it would work also if you burn it with toast but just adding it in the data file in toast 9, but I used burner and it worked fine just drag the VIDEO_TS folder in burner and thats it."
