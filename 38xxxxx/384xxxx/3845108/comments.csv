,nearadyn,2008-01-31T05:40Z,I will keep seeding this album until the end of time....or until I say otherwise in the comments section here. But I'm seeding so many torrents and running 4 computers so my bandwidth might be..uh...slow. I don't have any of Wolgemut's other albums right now. I bought this one from them when I met them at an SCA event in Mississippi a couple years ago. I've been looking for the other ones myself ever since.
,nearadyn,2008-02-14T06:33Z,"ok, I lost most of my stuff on my hard drive including this. I'll be remaking this torrent in a new file and uploading it in the next day or 2. Sorry for the inconvenience. "
,nearadyn,2008-02-15T00:18Z,I FIXED IT! I AM SEEDING NOW! sorry for the delay...
