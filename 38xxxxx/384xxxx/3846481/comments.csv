,crepesdrapes,2007-10-20T22:21Z,Thanks will do that.
,thebatman_1,2007-10-21T09:01Z,Another excellent upload by 66dino66. Thanks to you I didn't have to shell out ÂŁ100 for the collection. Though if you do get around to uploading any of the specials it would be much appreciated. I'm dying to see 'heroes and villians' again!! Thanks again dude.
,leadingman,2007-11-03T11:12Z,"Thanks Dino you are a legend!
Bring on Series 8!"
,Drowlord,2007-11-28T18:25Z,"Awesome torrent, dino, and great seeding, everyone!  I downloaded all 7 series in just a few hours.  Woot!  And I'll be happy to continue seeding for a while.

This might sound like I'm bitching, but I don't mean to.  I really appreciate what you've uploaded.

I looked on IMDB, and they are listing a lot more episodes of this show.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081912/episodes

Looks like there might be 23 more episodes than these 7 torrents contain, and specifically, a season 8 and season 9."
,66dino66,2007-12-01T04:20Z,"I know what it says on IMBD, but the extra episodes 
are actually specials which come on their own disk.
I'm sorry I don't own all of these, but if I can find them I will gladly put them up."
,lomivrat023,2009-09-25T15:00Z,Seed please!!!
