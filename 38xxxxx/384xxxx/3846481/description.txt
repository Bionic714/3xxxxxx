                                   Presents

The Sky's The Limit:

Rodders has split with Cassandra and is back in the flat, asleep on the couch, drunk or nursing a hangover. Del decides a romantic reconilliation at a luxury airport hotel on her return from holiday will do the trick. But who could have predicted Air Traffic Control would have such trouble? And could it be connected with Del's purchase of a dodgy satellite dish?

The Chance Of A Lunchtime:

As Delboy dreams of shifting a thousand 'National Anthem' musical doorbells, Rachel revives her theatrical passions and goes for an audition to join the world of cravat and codpieces. Not that Del is much help (when asked what he thought about Hamlet,he said he preferred Castella's). Meanwhile Rodders manages to blow his date with Cassandra and lose his job - in true plonker style.

Stage Fright:

When Del gets the chance to supply the cabaret at the Starlight Rooms, a pregnant Raquel dusts off her vocal chords in the kitchen and Trig's mate Tony Angelino, the singing dustman, is ready to duet with her. That is, until Del discovers the real owner of the club and the extent of Tony's vocal range!

Class of 62:

A school reunion in the Nag's Head signals Roy Slater's return to Civvy street after years in the nick. But why has this crooked ex-copper decided to come back to Peckham when he is universally loathed? Just as they begin to believe that he really has changed for the better, Del discovers the real passion for his return...

He Aint Heavy He's My Uncle:

While Rodders' drinking bouts leave him looking like one of the living dead, Albert's loking like a born again Teddy Boy. But the old sea dog returns from the over 60's club, bruised and battered. Has he really been mugged or is the source of the navy boxing champion's injuries much more embarrassing?

Three Men,a Woman And A Baby:

Del's about to become a father but even that can't cheer up Rodney - the - vegetarian. The Polar Cap is melting, the rain forest is dying, the sea is being poisoned, and he hasn't "had a bit in months". Not even one of Del's new ponytail wigs could enhance his image in Cassandra's eyes...
