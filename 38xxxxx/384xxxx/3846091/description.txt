Paragon Disk Wiper Professional 7.0
Paragon Disk Wiper Professional is designed for organizations and 
professionals that require reliable, fast and effective way for 
sanitizing hard disks. Data Sanitization Methods differ by wiping 
patterns and number of passes. The data should be sanitized in order 
to protect valuable business information and also because there is, in 
the most countries, a legal obligation to do so. Disk Wiper 
Professional guarantees secure and easy erasure of confidential data 
with the most comprehensive academic algorithms and customization 
options, wizard-based interface and extensive reporting. It completely 
erases all live data so as it cannot be recovered with any existing 
technology.
