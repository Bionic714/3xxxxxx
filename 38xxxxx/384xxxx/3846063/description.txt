I downloaded Internet.TV.Player.v2.6.Winall.Cracked-NoPE and of course it was bullshit, red flags appear when it's
a .sfx and it's C++ installer, little fucking cock suckers. Ah all is not lost!!  This is Internet TV & Radio Player 4.0  
The patch is from "NoPE" and they produce some good shit. For the paranoid among us (like me) you can also download 
a free 14 day trial version of Internet TV & Radio Player (the one if this torret) and patch it yourself Go to:  
http://www.epctv.com/download.htm for more info 
Requires Windows Media Player and RealPlayer's codec so,
Get this: 
KLite Codec Pack: http://www.free-codecs.com/K_Lite_Codec_Pack_download.htm
And this:
Real Alternative 1.60 at: http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_software/codecs_and_filters/real_alternative.cfm

Dammit now, let me go watch some free tv.
