Plot:

London, 2007. Tom Jackman is the only living descendent of 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He has made a deal with his dark 
side: a body share. What Mr. Hyde doesn't know is that Tom 
has a family. There is a wife and two children that he'll 
do anything to protect from his dark side. With all the 
resources of modern technology, and the best surveillance 
hardware, he's determined to keep his dark side in line. 
He's done a deal with his own devil. What neither of them 
knows is that an ancient organisation, with limitless wealth 
and power, is monitoring their every move, and a plan over 
a century in the making is coming to fruition.
