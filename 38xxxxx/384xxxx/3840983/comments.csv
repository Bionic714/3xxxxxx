,Psykiatri,2007-10-13T23:49Z,And as a reminder the installation program is in some strange language (hungarian??) but just about anyone knows how to click next a few times even in hungarian to install the game. After that delete those two files mentioned in the description and the .nfo and the game will start in english.
,Psykiatri,2007-10-14T11:27Z,"TheOneEyedDude: 
Unlike in your release this version does not contain any fishy and suspicious .exe files which light up your virus scanner and this version also has english commentary unlike reported in your version."
