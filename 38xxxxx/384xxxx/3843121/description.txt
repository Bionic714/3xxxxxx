Dear Downloader,

You found yourself a REALLY nice download with GREAT mixes. They are deep, funky, groovy, dirty, intense and always of a high standard. If not, they donâ??t make the cut or get my rate of approval. 

Monthly I will find you house music that is on stealth mode by nature. You know, the good stuff that flies under the radar. The kind of mixes that start with a small underground audience. You!

Every month I will put 4 mixes online in total. Youâ??ll always find these mixes as 1 torrent-download under the name "Mix Pack"-followed by the month of release.

ALL MIX-PACKS WILL BE MP3-PLAYER PROOF. So no shitty track transitions that fuck up the pleasure of good music and no bad audio quality. Not on my watch.

Oh, and one last thing. Never, AND I MEAN NEVER, will these mix-packs hold the same DJâ??s twice in a row. Exclusive is the idea here. Download and listen every month and you will get the point.

ENJOY!

Please keep seeding after the download has finished.
