Please be patient as I have a slow connection!

There are other dance instructional videos I\\\'ve found at www.ballroomdancingworld.com, a file sharing website specializing in sharing dance materials and ballroom dancing and apparently they\\\'ve shared a tonful of ballroom and dancing related stuff since 2004. The only problem I\\\'ve found is that they share via eDonkey, and sharing over eDonkey/eMule is a major pain in the b*tt since it takes forever to download stuff. So if you\\\'re into learning dancing, prefer using BitTorrent, and have a good connection, it wouldn\\\'t be a bad idea to simply grab files off eMule and share those over here.

Enjoy.
