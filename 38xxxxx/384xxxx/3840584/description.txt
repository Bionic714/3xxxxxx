From the same people that brought us FileSee (in both regards), we have Google Maps Images Downloader. This is a tool designed to download the tiles off of Google Maps. Although this could be done with a screen capture tool like the earlier posted Ashampoo Magical Snap, or SnagIt. LineZer0 have again come through with the goods, with a keygen for this app, and the release packed into 1 archive.

Google Maps Images Downloader is a cute tool that help you to get small tile satellite images from Google Maps. All downloaded small images are saved on the disk. You can view downloaded maps by Satellite Viewer Or you can combine them into a big BMP map. It supports proxy server. And you can easily get the longitude and latitude of each downloaded small tile image.

System Requirements:

    * Windows 95/98/2000/XP/2003.
