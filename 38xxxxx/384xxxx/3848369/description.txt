This is the image of the Combine logo with the dove, as seen in Half-Life 2. It's high-res (3511x7022), and looks awesome.

I recommend combining (no pun intended) this image with The Sect of Homokaasu's "Rasterbator" program, as found here: http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/. This will allow you to have a wall-sized poster of this using nothing more than a printer and some scissors.
