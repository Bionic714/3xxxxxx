Cardamar - Sequence Breaker EP

A variety of tracks on this promo CD by Cardamar. This one starts with a dancey track, with a melody which will be in your head forever after listening. In the middle we find some remixes and older tracks resurrected, as well as the Sandfirden Edit of To The Sunrise We Emerge (as heard on the Picture Postcard From Sandfirden mix). We finish the set of tracks with Off We Go, a Chillout reprise of the opening track.

Limited to 66 copies, which will all be given away for free to the first happy customers of Dream Lab's Cosmotherapy (CARD010). Not for sale separately :)
