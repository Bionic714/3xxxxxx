Hong Kong-styled, fantasy wirework merges with the latest Thai-branded martial arts
action in the crazed action comedy DYNAMITE WARRIOR. It stars Dan Chupong, a former
member of Tony Jaa√¢??s stunt team, who emerged as a credible action star himself following
the release of BORN TO FIGHT in 2004. It also stars Thai action king Panna Rittikrai in
an unusual role as a Thai boxing warlock with a particularly bad case of sunburn.
