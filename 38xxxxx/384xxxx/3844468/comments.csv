,Kimberly_Janna1,2007-10-29T18:24Z,"How do I install it? Please, help me!"
,cherrypie556,2007-10-31T22:11Z,"whats an flt file? Nop image to mount on this one, pile of poo me thinks!!"
,CGAssassin,2007-11-02T01:16Z,"HJSplit, use it to compress the files together."
,CGAssassin,2007-11-02T11:35Z,"Actually don't, just drag the .001 file into Winrar and it will give you the cue and bin to extract."
,teezie,2007-11-12T20:24Z,how much rubish data is there because i am at 7.3% and already have 192.86 MB rubbish data
,Midaiganes,2007-11-14T15:34Z,"There is a lot of crapp in this..I'm stuck at 99.9% with amount of rubbish over 2.68 GB - that's more than the filesize. If you have a chance, download it from different source"
,cherrypie556,2007-11-14T16:42Z,"Well i downloaded ok, took a while. But still clueless to what to do with these bloody FLT files, dunno how to convert them into a game/image file etc.  Tried the winrar way, can't even get to open the file with winrar, cant get that option. think im just gonna buy it as after all this it probs wont work anyway."
,kaisus,2007-11-17T23:08Z,i have downloaded 1.15gb.. and 655mb is wasted :S
,atom224,2007-12-06T00:38Z,"flt files are rar files.  just named after the group.  right click, select open with, and pick winrar or some other program. you'll be left with iso images you can mount or burn."
,cherrypie556,2007-12-17T15:02Z,"Has anyone actually got this to work?? Winrar is extracting jack shit, nothing there to extract. I opened winrar, added the file and nothing. It's shite!"
,olivere2,2007-12-20T14:59Z,if it is iso download iso buster !! its good 
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-12-26T20:40Z,"It work. Took quite a while to download, and took me a couple tries to get it to work. Here's what I did:
1) Open WinRAR from the start menu
2) Open the ""file"" menu on WinRAR and select ""open archive""
3) Select *.001 and extract to wherever you wish
4) Repeat steps 2-3 for disks 2-3
5) Mount, Install, copy crack from Fairlight folder on disk one and enjoy.

I don't know what was used to archive/split the file (maybe it was hjsplit, I never heard of that one) but that method worked fine for me. 
The game is a bit laggy, but that is probably my system. It works great though, nice game, nice release!"
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-12-26T20:43Z,"Oh... regarding the discarded data, I had 532 kb of discarded data, so not sure what could be causing that particular problem. I'll be seeding this fine release for a few days as well."

,muscleflex,2008-02-11T11:17Z,"downloaded fine for me. and i've managed to extract it fine. those people who complain don't know anything!

,muscleflex,2008-02-28T11:45Z,"well, my copy does not work. one of the files is corrupt so everytime i try to install it, it stops."
,Koenachtig,2008-06-22T20:10Z,"After 48 hours, stuck at 99.8%"
,Lakon44,2008-08-19T22:53Z,mine works till i mount CD 3. Then it stops responding and the screen becomes white :(
,Bombvis,2008-11-23T13:04Z,I'm downloading for 4 days now and I'm on 46%!!!! I've uploaded already 3.15 GB and downloaded 977 MB!!!
,dark-angel-alliance,2008-12-10T00:04Z,"Downloading now, will seed for a while after it's finished,"

,Renis1235,2011-08-15T23:17Z,I love this game
,slm90,2011-08-27T07:23Z,"Ok... I know basic and some not so basic things when it comes to computers but when it comes to this stuff I'm completely lost. I followed monkies directions but I don't know what I'm doing. I followed step by step and I've extracted everything I know to extract and nothing is working. I don't see how I can be doing it wrong. I followed the instructions.. But obviously I'm doing something wrong because people on here are saying it works. It says that it's extracting, but then when I look at the original file folder it looks exactly the same as before. with the flt-tv.71.001, .002.. ect. No .iso or .exe files. Nothing. Still flt. What am I doing wrong?! this is driving me crazy! I even created a new folder and extracted all the .flt files into there and all I got was two vlc files. .bin and .cue? What is that? Can someone please explain this to me?.."
