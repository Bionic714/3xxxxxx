,daimashu,2009-03-11T16:15Z,"umm hey genius, a ""crack"" (implying something that digs into a bit of code and changes it so you can use something) will of course show as a virus, it is what we people who KNOW how to DL call a ""false positive""

your average A / V program doesnt look for known viruses, there would be no point and it would be simple to work around them.  what they do is look through a directory (virus definition file) of little sections of coding thjat tells something to change data somewhere or to change a registry and such forth and so forth.
when it finds that code (which is used in cracks, keygens, and trainers almost every time) it pops up a false positive saying virus.

certain A / V programs have the ability to distinguish, like AVG when it pops a fals positive, and knows it, it asks if i wanna add it to the exceptions lsit(i never do, as that would add the virus def to the list too lol)

so for future reference, no, this doesnt have a virus, otherwise i would be infected right now.



and a last note to all real DL'ers?
