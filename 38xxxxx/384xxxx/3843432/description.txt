Arch Hammer is a man who can change his face to make it look like anyone he chooses. He first walks into a night club where he impersonates trumpeter Johnny Foster in order to steal Foster's girlfriend, a sultry singer. Hammer then pays a visit to Mr. Penell impersonating murdered gangster Virgil Sterig in order to extort money out of Penell, the man who had Sterig killed. But Penell figures out the deception and sends his men after him. Trying to escape down an alley, Hammer changes his face to one he sees on a poster of boxer Andy Marshak. But, thinking he is in the clear, he then runs into Marshak's father at a street book stall, who mistakes him for the son who broke his mother's heart, and ruined a young girl's life. Hammer pushes the old man out of the way and returns to his hotel room. A detective comes to the hotel to pick him up for questioning at the police station. When Hammer tries to escape from the policeman in a revolving door, he assumes Marshak's appearance again. But on the street he bumps into Marshak's father again, who pulls a gun on him. Hammer tries to show the old man he is not who he thinks he is, but before he can concentrate and change, the old man shoots him. As Hammer lies dying, his face shifts from one person to another until he dies wearing his own face.
