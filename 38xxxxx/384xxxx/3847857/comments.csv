,foofersgod,2007-10-23T23:39Z,"Sorry much... My daughter some how stopped my uploading program and erased the data.  I am reseeding it again.  This time as 2 different files... Season 1 complete and Season 2 E1-5...

sorry much and hopefully you can get everything this way."
,foofersgod,2007-10-23T23:57Z,"Okay forget my last comment... I am reseeding to original file... i didn't have to make a new one and I do have episode 5 and will be uploading that one soon.

I have to start all over for the uploading and can max out at 60/kbps.  Most people are at 97.5 % done and please be patient.  I will upload for a long time."
