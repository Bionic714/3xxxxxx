,rajivuncoiling,2008-06-28T10:16Z,"one of the best researched documentary even produced. i personally think that part I was not required its useless to hurt anybody's religious sentiments regardless to his/her caste color and creed. even if what they say in part I is 100%, which i doubt, what matters in religion is faith not history. rest of the movie is no doubt an eye opener for all people those who think they are rewarded for their hard work and honesty, in fact there are criminal and swindlers with trillion of dollars to swindle any single penny they can get from you. MUST WATCH AND DISTRIBUTE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL. may god bless you all, regardless to your caste, color and creed."
,ejputz,2008-07-25T19:58Z,"@rajivuncoiling - Part 1 is necessary to set the stage... It tells the story of just how willing people are to carry-on a belief, across boundaries of nationality and time; and how difficult it is to refute those beliefs, even in the face of contradictory evidence. But alas, ""truth"" ALWAYS hurts ""belief""."
,Hayze1504,2009-06-19T17:39Z,What do i have to do to get these files into a  movie file?
,supergogo,2009-08-19T00:55Z,"Hayze1504:
Open the VIDEO_TS.IFO file in powerDVD or media player classic and you can play it like a DVD, or burn the files within a video_ts folder on a DVD and play it in your DVD player."
,supergogo,2009-08-19T01:03Z,"rajivuncoiling:
If you really believe in a God, your sentence ""god bless you all"" may suggest, why don't you pray for all the children who are abused, die in war or die of hunger around the world? The problem with religion is it make people ignorant and selective in their belief. It also goes easily over to fanatism, and it is wrong to teach people and childre to accept dogmas, for instance that Jesus is supposed to be a prophet. Fortunately we now have the Internet, where there is no authorithy and you have to genuinely convince people with good insight and established facts before they turn into a ""believer."" Tricks like ""God works in mysterious ways"" and ""hersey"" have no value unless promoted by a threatening mob, for instance your religious parents."
,supergogo,2009-08-19T01:08Z,"Religion creates a black and white world with heaven and hell. They create a ""problem,"" a market demand, and they also create the solution. Worship our God, give money to our organisation. They have essentially stolen the key to the heavens. These are only arguments, but if they where presented along with a brainwashing missinary, it would me much more difficult to convert members for your religion. Your center of dogmas that have specialized in arguments from their side."
