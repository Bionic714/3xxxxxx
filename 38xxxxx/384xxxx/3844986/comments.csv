,quentin_crisp,2008-03-10T14:26Z,Works for me but you don't need to download the 16.8Mb 'FLS5MacManual.pdf' file (nearly half the whole torrent size!) as it is already included as a zipped copy (FontLab Studio 5.0 Manual.zip).

,e-quity,2010-04-28T18:58Z,Note the line mode d'emploi MAC et PC. This application requires that you have Rosetta running on your system and that will potentially slow everything down... though Apple might claim otherwise. Avoid Rosetta where you can.
,jonpavlic,2011-12-29T17:55Z,Does anyone know where can I get FontLab 5.1 for Mac OS X Lion?! Because it doesn't support rosetta....:(
