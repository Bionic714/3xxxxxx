""Third episode of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, being broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Wednesday.

Excellent show, and a must for all Douglas Adams fans out there :)""

I plan to release a new episode every week, in MP3-format, so you have to avoid BBC's shitty RealPlayer-mess. If you have any feedback, please comment, and I will take it into account :)"

Would be awesome if you could toss up ep. 1+2 as well :-)

Mind writing the torrent-links in this comment field then? 

Cheers

Note: these are not encoded by me, so I will take no credit for them. I will however encode the remaining episodes, so no worries ;)"
,romfuss,2007-10-22T12:42Z,Do you have any idea how many episodes this series will total in the end?
,bepe86,2007-10-22T21:11Z,"6 episodes in each of the series (Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, and The Salmon of Doubt), making it 18 episodes in total, so plenty of entertainment to look forward to :)"
,bepe86,2007-10-24T22:09Z,"Episode 4 is now avilable :)
