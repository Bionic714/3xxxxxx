Documentary about His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, also known as by the title (Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah Elect of God King of Kings Emperor of Ethiopia). It is an interesting documentary film with rare video and photos, written and narrated by David Holden of the BBC. Filmed almost four decades ago, the documentary itself is part of history. This film shows the rise of Selassie I to power and his struggle with fascist Italy during world war II. The documentary also explores, The betrayal of the western nations (Particularly then English prime minister Neville Chamberlain and the French foreign minister) , by sacrificing ETHIOPIA to appease fascist Italy. Very educational and interesting piece of work.
