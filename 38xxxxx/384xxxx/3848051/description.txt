Preserved for Posterity Arcade Pack #1
A PfP Release
October 18, 2007

PfP Arcade Packs will contain 10 games per pack.
This Pack (#1) Contains the following:

Asteroids (Neave Asteroids, Macromedia, Inc.)

Hexxagon (Neave Hexxagon, Macromedia, Inc.)

Pac-Man (Neave Pac-Man, Macromedia, Inc.)

Simon (Neave Simon, Macromedia, Inc.)

Snake (Neave Snake, Macromedia, Inc.)

Space Invaders (Neave Space Invaders, Macromedia, Inc.)

Tetris (Neave Tetris, Macromedia, Inc.)

Tic-Tac-Toe (Neave Tic-Tac-Toe, Macromedia, Inc.)

Elf Bowling (Elf Bowling Game, NVision Design, Inc.)

Napster Bad! (Flash Player 4.0 r7, Macromedia, Inc.)

Most of the games are self-explanatory. Those based on the arcade
games by the same name offer gameplay that is true to the arcade
machines upon which they are based. The "Napster Bad" technically
IS NOT a game, but I couldn't resist adding it because it is
funnay as hell (and I needed something to fill out Arcade Pack #1).
Snake is a clone of that infamous Nokia Cell Phone Game.

Install, enjoy and look for more PfP Arcade Packs and other
releases soon.
