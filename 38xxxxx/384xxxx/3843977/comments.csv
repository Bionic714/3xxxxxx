Would anone have any idea of how to make better quality avi s. I'm using Auto GK and doing a straight process. Any things I should lookout for etc? Any better easier programs for higher quality avi s? Thanks"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-04T07:21Z,"Though this is also probably a TV rip, quality is not so bas as in 'Four Nights of a Dreamer'. Both films hard to get in any form, so grab this chance rather than worry about quality.
Based on a Dostoevsky novella. 
Thanks a lot, *nax610*!"
