i'm looking for Cloud9's F104 Starfight version 100. please!"
,Panodilo,2007-10-19T14:42Z,"No offense, but I don't think you can handle the F-104. It has a disgustingly high approach speed and can only be landed by the goodest simmers. I recommend Feelthere's Cessna Caravan instead. It has the F-104's excellent climbing ability and uses considerably less avgas. Also, the nifty little autopilot allows for a roll in the hay with your's truly."
