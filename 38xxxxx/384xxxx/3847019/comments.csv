,themixingbowl,2010-04-28T01:19Z,"since this seems to be the only copy of this on the internet, ill suffer through the french subs. THANKS!"
,Igemo75,2011-03-09T11:28Z,"Stop moaning : you can have the film in perfect DVD quality. If you're unhappy with the subs look out for a R1 U.S. dvd release... 

What? There ain't any? So thank the French for having the guts to preserve this one ;-)"
,S3nd41,2011-03-09T15:29Z,"Maybe this version doesn't have the hardcoded subs: www dot torrenthound dot com/hash/42eea2267011cf331446a58cd6b863fc341b951d/torrent-info/Punishment-Park-1971-USA-Peter-Watkins-DVDrip-XviD-0

Gonna try it and I'll let you know if it doesn't."
