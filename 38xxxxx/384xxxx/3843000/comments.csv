,RyzOfSBTS,2007-10-16T00:23Z,Thanks for uploading this for me. I appreciate it.
,IamLemmy,2007-10-16T00:55Z,:-)
,mrspock09,2007-10-16T02:20Z,"good job on the songs. everything seemed in order. floods didnt seem off-sync for me. and i had a couple questions about the songs. first, isnt xepher by talsh? i'm not sure but thats how i've seen it all over youtube. and what happended to revolution deathsquad? its loads different from the original. but its still fun, and its slightly off-sync btw. but all in all, a very good custom set imo and the only songs i havent beat yet tonight are blitzkrieg and eruption, but i'm getting closer on eruption (85-90% so far then failing :P)
o and i got my guitar hero hack put up yesterday ^_^ "
,RyzOfSBTS,2007-10-16T03:36Z,Xepher is by Tatsh. What do you mean about Revolution Dethsquad?
,RyzOfSBTS,2007-10-16T03:36Z,"Oh, also thanks for the good comment. ^_^"
,mrspock09,2007-10-16T13:21Z,"what i meant by revolution deathsquad is that its different from voivod84's chart, and his is the only r.d. chart on scorehero.com. o and i beat Blitzkrieg yesterday. so only eruption remains >_"
,IamLemmy,2007-10-16T13:37Z,Mr. Spock! Is the game freezing on the encores?
,RyzOfSBTS,2007-10-16T19:25Z,"IamLemmy, I think that is caused by an error with the program I used. I didn't know about it until last night when I saw it on the site I downloaded it from. It will hamper you from playing through career, but there should be no problems in quick play. =( Sorry.

I downloaded a new version that's supposed to have that fixed, and I plan to eventually do another custom with it and upload my next one."
,RyzOfSBTS,2007-10-16T19:37Z,I'm not sure spock. I'm playing the copy that I burned and it loads the exact same way in the videos I've seen of the chart.
,IamLemmy,2007-10-16T20:09Z,"Ok RyzOfSBTS.

Did you use Guitar Wizard 2.0 ou 2.1 to make this custom? If yes, then the file tips.dtb was damage. And you need to substitute its from a original tips.dtb, by using GHex, in config/gen."
,mrspock09,2007-10-16T21:17Z,"i havent tried career mode. i usually only play quick play and pro-faceoff. but yea revolution deathsquad is different than the original. it may be the importing method from guitar wizard, but idk i use GHEX for all my custom stuff"
,RyzOfSBTS,2007-10-17T00:24Z,"I used the newest version that was out before he fixed the bugs lemmy. I'm guessing 2.1.

spock, i use GHex for all of my off sets and importing. I use GWiz to edit everything and change some stuff/remove things. How is the song different, like note wise, or what?"
,mrspock09,2007-10-17T02:03Z,"yea, almost all of the song is different from voivod's chart. its slightly easier, but at the same time it has the same problem the original has. it just has WAY too many notes and it ruins the song (no offense)."
,RyzOfSBTS,2007-10-17T02:35Z,"None taken, lol. I didn't make the chart. Voivod tends to like putting lots of notes in his charts. Only thing I can think of is maybe he switched out a chart or something. I get all my songs from SH, so I don't know."
,Ironman4,2008-01-04T13:39Z,"sorry i´m new here, so how i can download my torrent here?"
,Herman^,2008-02-21T12:09Z,Farför kan man inte spela på Medium ?? finns inga sånger ! WTF 
,nooben2,2008-04-08T15:42Z,SEED FFS! It's like eight hours until its complete
,mightiest,2011-03-13T06:47Z,"Hi, everyone, I am new here.
