[V],WeeKnighT,2008-08-06T11:28Z,"the aspect ratio is off, and the bitrate isnt high enough to handle the warping when you set it back to fullscreen like it should be."

,barda24,2008-12-04T18:31Z,"Get a grip! I like this movie, but this is NOT a sequal to the movie Hackers. This one is just named Takedown, and is based on the real actions of Kevin Mitnick, and Tsutomu Shimomura (whom also was one of the authers of the book Takedown)."
,kostas_x_,2009-06-14T12:19Z,"WARNING: This is definetely NOT the real story of Kevin Mitnick. 

If you want to learn more about the real story, facts and also find out more about the distorted way in which this movie depicts the real characters and events, check out this trully great documentary: FREEDOM DOWNTIME, directed by Emmanuel Goldstein a well known figure in the hacker community. 

This is an eye-opening film made by the hacker community.

Be sure to check out for a true insight on the story:

,mr2shlizz,2011-11-19T10:17Z,"Great download speed.

Recommend watching FREEDOM DOWNTIME for the true facts about what really went down and not base your opinions on main stream media.

Thanx to AntiConformity"
