Gammelpot is a small gnome-like creature who goes through all sorts of strange adventures where he meets (often) supernatural beings. He has a magic backpack from which he can always conjure items that help him out of even the most perilous situations. For others, the backpack remains empty - except when Gammelpot gives permission to take something.
