,pryll,2007-10-16T18:38Z,"actually, the url on the bravebelt torrent is differet from other stuff I´m leeching from tpb - and I am being refused to connect. And I am not banned... let´s keep on trying for a while, if it does´n work, I would appreciate if you made a new torrent and uploaded it again.. "
,Reride,2007-10-16T19:13Z,"It's on the old prq.to/announce - tracker, so maybe it doesn't work anymore.
Hang on for a while. A new one's coming up."
