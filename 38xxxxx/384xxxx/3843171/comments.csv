,hasse776,2007-10-20T06:57Z,"Hey kef71.
What Have You Done With This Upload.After 37% I Get An Error.It Say That Another Process Has Locked The File.And It's Only With This Download,I Have Dowloaded 4 Movies Without Any Problem."
[T],kef71,2007-10-20T07:32Z,"hasse776: I don't know what the problem is but I am 100% sure it's on your side. AFAIK, there's nothing wrong with the torrent. What client do you use? It seems like you have some other software locking the files so the client does not have exclusive access and gives an error. Have you tried to run a malware/virus scan?"
,donspudgun,2007-10-21T00:04Z,"Some people say that every new edition of
Microsoft Windows causes a corresponding
advance in technology, as more CPU power
and storage is required to cope with the
every-more bloated software. What few people
realize is that it is actually KEF71 who is
responsible for the huge advances in
computing: right now there are dozens of
geeks running around Intel HQ trying to figure
out how they are going to store this 250GB
(and counting!) of Star Trek quality and seed
at the same time! So thanks Kef71, you mad
GENIUS, whoever and wherever you are"
,gHighway,2007-10-26T16:35Z,"Cheer dude. Always good to see uncompressed uploads. I like the choice of whether to shrink or not. Well done again on your uploads.

Just so I know how many more hard drives to buy, what do you have planned for the future kef71 ??

Thanks."
