,Jeanyos,2007-10-13T09:05Z," 209 50mb files?  
Come on man! Can you at least split it into 1gig archives, or something? 
like: 
A-D.rar
E-H.rar 
I-L.rar
etc. 

or something like that. 
I, for one, am not going to even start a 9 gig download if I don't even know what is in the archive! "
,SkurrePurre2,2007-10-13T10:39Z,"Hmmm, the pic's dosen't work....
In the rars you got many many songs from diffrent artists and a setup for Frets On Fire. Enjoy this huge packet!"
,Jeanyos,2007-10-13T14:26Z,"Might be better if you left the songs directory un-rared, so that people could choose which ones that they want. :)"
,SkurrePurre2,2007-10-13T18:11Z,Jeanyos: To much files for uTorrent. The program can't handle it.
,Jeanyos,2007-10-13T19:52Z,"O.K. 

Then how about sorting them by artist, then archiving 10 or 15 artist folders per rar file? 

and you do know that if the ""guitar.ogg"" and the ""song.ogg"" are the same, then you don't have to include the ""song.ogg"" file! That could also trim this file down a bit if some of the 
un-necessary files could be deleted. 

 by the way, your ""imageshack"" link is dead. 
try ""FileDen"" or ""Photobucket"". Both of those sites allow hot-linking to your files."
,secondeye,2007-11-22T09:53Z,"Or you guys could download it while you sleep, or are at work, and delete what you don't want?

OH NO!  9 GIG DL!  I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF SPACE!"
