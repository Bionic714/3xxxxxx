,gorejuice,2008-06-25T13:54Z,"Total legend... some great tracks that are new to me too.

Been a Mode, Yazoo, Nitzer Ebb, Human League and others fan for 20 years plus now but theyve been compiled with such a great mix of lesser known (to me at least) tunes.

I now have 23 of these albums and a long listen in store for me!

Cheers"
