This is definetly the best Iggy Pop bootleg around, this one comes the closest to capturing the live essence of Iggy\\\'s shows. He brought Brian James on guitar, he definetly can\\\'t play and I bet Iggy and he were on drugs. Iggy can\\\'t sing and they can\\\'t play. But hell, they do it anyway! from the moment Brian Eno & Robbert Fripp\\\'s intro of No Pussyfooting get\\\'s kicked by Real Cool Time, Iggy and his band make the stage fall apart(literally). They even get in a fight with the police and security, they\\\'ve gone seriously wild..Heck, they even play Funtime!! Being followed by a long, sickening synthesizer outro. Iggy\\\'s Sinatra cover of \\\"One for My Babe\\\" is another reason to download this bootleg. It\\\'s a must-have for every selfrespecting Rock-fan!!! It\\\'s an amazing live bootleg wich only can be beaten by Metallic K.O.  Funny part is when you hear the police screaming \\\"pull over!\\\" through TV Eye. At this evening, there were no boundaries. Notice how Brian James turns his amplifier to 10 while playing the solo for the same song! Iggy is notorious for being selfestructive and ripping the stage (and himself) apart..This is one of the shows where he goes mad- he doesn\\\'t need any trips, he just does what he wants to do. ALL ABOARD FOR FUNTIMEEE!!!
