2:08:44 - Rated Version

IMDB - Runtime: 130 min"
,roflman,2007-10-17T01:09Z,"other releases out there only has 123 min. Is this really unrated or what?

amazon.com makes it even more confusing. Try searching for die hard unrated. You'll get a 2 disc version saying it's unrated. But under ""rating:"" it says PG-13.     what????"
