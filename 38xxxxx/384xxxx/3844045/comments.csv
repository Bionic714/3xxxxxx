This is FAKE !!!!  FAKE !!!   FAKE !!!
I learnt the hard way that if you flash this over your Kreon v0.81 you will rip and write dud x360 backups that will give ""dirty disc errors"".
Stick with Kreon V0.81 as this is NOT genuine but some hacks fun way to stuff your backups.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!!"

Kreon Ts05 v1.00 works... made about 40 working backups with it on a D-162C."
