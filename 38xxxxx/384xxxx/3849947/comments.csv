,vivatpb5776,2011-04-09T17:13Z,"Okay, this is going to be a different type of comment. I know there are those that would be satisfied with simply downloading the .vob files and burning them to a DVD. I am not one of those people. All of my collection is either .avi or .mp4 files. I used to burn DVDs until my collection got so large that storing DVDs became a hassle. Stating that, I use ImToo DVD Ripper Ultimate 5 to rip the movie file out of the .vob file.

The original content is flawless for a DVDRip. The screen resolution is 720*576. Converting this into an .avi file should be seamless. Thank you uploader."
