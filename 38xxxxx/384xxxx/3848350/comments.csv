,Rezagrats,2007-12-15T20:45Z,this an actual band? or are they just on the down-low ? like in underground musik ?
,Volryn666,2008-07-06T10:21Z,"dear Rez, you obviously are a dumbass mainstream child of society so lemme explain to you. It is industrial music that has not touched society's ""britneys, christina, and eminems. CNN AND Mtv"" so as a closing statement it is not and i repeat NOT mainstream. So if you choose to listen to xp8 please, dont put it on an ipod with rap and horrible tastelss music like that, and actually go buy the album like i did, and ""why"" you migth ask? becuase the gothic subculture needs to be treated with respect, instead of belittled by Orange County wannabe's and faggy kids who call themselves ""scene"" ""emo"" and gay labels such as that. and yes, i know, im a dick."
,kirill539,2009-05-23T00:51Z,I fucking second Volryn666. We do not need even MORE faggots infiltrating what is left of an amazing culture. 
,nobeone,2009-07-29T08:17Z,"WOW... Volryn666 , you give the entire subculture a BAD name... it;s because of YOU that it's misunderstood. 

I don't hate people for being Ignorant...

But I do hate people for being Stupid.

Not even you knew about XP8 at some point. You found them just like everyone else. Stop all the hate. 

I hate the mainstream stuff to. But you can't lash out at people because they want to listen to our music... That's just Retarded..."
