Based on the success of the P-47 in the air-to-ground role in USAAF service in Europe, the RAF obtained P-47D's for use with the Southeast Asia Command. Arriving in the spring of 1944, the P-47Ds began flying close air support and interdiction missions in support of Commonwealth troops. Southeast Asia Command ultimately operated 16 squadrons of the razor-backed Thunderbolt I's and bubble-topped Thunderbolt II's.
