Also commanded the U.S. Army?s Electronic Research and Development Command and the U.S. Army?s Intelligence School and Center. Former head of Imagery Interpretation for Scientific and Technical Intelligence. 32-year Army career. 

""One of my experiences in the Army was being in charge of the Army?s Imagery Interpretation for Scientific and Technical Intelligence during the Cold War.  I measured pieces of Soviet equipment from photographs. It was my job. I look at the hole in the Pentagon and I look at the size of an airplane that was supposed to have hit the Pentagon. And I said, ?The plane does not fit in that hole?. So what did hit the Pentagon? What hit it? Where is it? What's going on?""
