The Pursuit of Happyness is an Academy Award-nominated 2006 drama film produced by Overbrook Entertainment, Escape Artist, and Relativity Media, in association with and released by Columbia Pictures on December 15, 2006. Based on the true story of Chris Gardner, who secured an internship with a stock brokerage firm while homeless, the film stars Will Smith as Gardner and Smith's real-life son Jaden Smith as Gardner's son Christopher. Although the film differs from Gardner's real-life experiences in various respects, it recounts many of the challenging events faced by Gardner while pursuing the internship and caring for Christopher. The title of the movie is derived from the words of Thomas Jefferson in the United States Declaration of Independence; the misspelling of "happiness" refers to a theme in the movie where Gardner is upset that a mural decorating his son's daycare is incorrectly spelled. The film was directed by Gabriele Muccino, an Italian director making his English-language directorial debut.
