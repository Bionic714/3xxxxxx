Welcome to paradox is a science-fiction show produced and aired by the Sci-Fi
Channel in 1998, all episodes are based on short story's by famous science
fiction authors.
The show is a bit similar to the recent "Masters of science fiction", but it
doesn't suck like MoSF did.

This torrent contains all thirteen episodes of "Welcome to paradox", in the
order they appear on the DVD.
All episodes are ripped from the DVD, since this is a pretty rare torrent I went
for quality rather than size, also note that no extras/subtitles/etc are lost since
the DVD doesn't contain any what-so-ever.

If you like this DVD then please buy it, good science-fiction series (and no,
stupid "Sci-Fi" like Stargate or Enterprise is not good science fiction) isn't that
common nowadays, if you buy the DVD you will support further development of
science fiction.
Seriously, it's not that expensive, if a poor bum like me can afford it then so
can you :)

You can buy the DVD is Australia only, but most of these sites ship worldwide
and accept credit cards and/or paypal.
