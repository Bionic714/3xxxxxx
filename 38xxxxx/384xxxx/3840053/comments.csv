,FFSMNRK,2009-02-04T06:49Z,"As much as I don't mind the original mix of this (I did download this once here), I must ask you: ""Have you heard of Hi-Fi""? If so, then why haven't you used it? Reason I ask, is cause I find that the audio here is very off-putting with its LP scratches. Couldn't you have ripped it in Hi-Fi? LP scratches, in my opinion, ruin the flow of music (unless it's in rap), especially this, when there's a gong exit, and it's very distracting. I'm sorry, but while I applaud your initiative of getting the original mix here, I find the LP scratches too distracting."
