The is the elusive original mix of the album taken from a Dutch half-speed vinyl transfer. This mix is much lower in fidelity than the remix that has appeared on every CD version, but it features a number of overdubs that the remix lacks, most notably backup vocals in the bridges of "Time to Get Away" and piano on the instrumental passages of "The Sun Set". Thanks to Thom Osburn for sharing this otherwise lost mix with me.
