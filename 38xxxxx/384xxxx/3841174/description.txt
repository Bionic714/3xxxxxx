Following the massive success of United in Hardcore and Hardcore Classics, compilations that sold over 150,000 copies, Ministry of Sound reunite two hardcore legends to make one of the most exciting albums in the history of rave.

Celebrating their 17th Birthday this year, London legends Raindance are known throughout the land for their consistently amazing parties, which see 3000 nutters go wild at the awesome seOne complex on a regular basis. The atmosphere at Raindance is unbeatable, still enjoying the accolade of the UK?s very first legal all-night rave. Similarly, Helter Skelter has been rocking the UK since 1989, staging breathtaking events for up to 18,000 people and bringing the finest in drum ?n? bass, old skool and hardcore to the country?s biggest and best venues.

Both promotions are keen supporters of the best in new and classic hardcore ? and this marriage of old and upfront is what Hardcore 2007 is all about.

This anthem-packed triple CD has been selected and mixed by the two legends themselves- painstakingly presented, for a true and totally authentic glimpse of the scene in 2007.

Slipmatt was responsible for some of the biggest hardcore and rave anthems of all time (a few of which are included in the album), while Billy ?Daniel? Bunter has helped to spearhead the hardcore renaissance with his awesome Tasty events. Both have been playing at the country?s biggest raves since the birth of hardcore ? in short, there is no-one better that could have put this CD together.

Disc 1 is the old made new- 22 classic old skool anthems and modern dance smashes remixed fresh for 2007 and given the hardcore treatment. Things get fully pumped up on Discs 2 and 3, with some of the most exciting, uplifting hardcore from the crème de la crème of the scene?s producers; CLSM, Sy & Unknown, Robbie Long & Stormtrooper, Squad E, Technikore, Dougal & Gammer, Styles & Breeze, Sytronik...all the legends and all the hottest new stars join forces to bring by far one of the best Hardcore albums of all time.

66 tracks ? the full hardcore and old skool spectrum ? and a ton of exclusive cuts...what better way to start your 2007 than with a hefty dose of HARDCORE?
