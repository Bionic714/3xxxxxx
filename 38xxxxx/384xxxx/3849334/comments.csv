,LiLBoY21,2008-01-09T23:09Z,"Yeah Hey, Listen i downloaded this and ive had experience with torrents. First u gotta open the first Ftl-cnc3.... with WINRAR, and you will extract an image. This will take a while since the image is obviously large, and can be place anywhere. Then with POWER ISO, u mount that image onto the virtual CD. *for more help check out poweriso.com* THEN, open my computer and double click on the virtual drive to start installation. NOW, GO BACK to where you installed C&C 3, and open the NFO file, NOT SFV, with notepad. *i did this cuz it just ends up showing me my pc specs.. :S* ONCE you have opened it, you will see many wierd characters. somewhere u will see the CD KEY. USE THIS when asked during installation. Then complete intallation. ONCE it is done, find the folder, and goto RETAIL.EXE then 1.0 and you will see the file cnc3game. So now u have to go back to the virtual cd drive and right click and click explore. Once in, Look for the folder Fairlight, then 1.0 and you will see a cnc3game file. Obviously you will have to place this with the original one. Once you have done that go back to the main C&C3 folder (game installation one) and run the game. IT should now run normally without any ""no cd windows poping up"" Although this may seem hard it is quite easy. For more help contact me at littleboywow@hotmail.com , as i will gladly try to assist anyone with difficulties.. later :) and enjoy playing =]"
