The 1920s begin with America trying to recover from WW1 andbaseball trying to recover from the scandal of the 1919 World Series. America finds relief in the boom market and the jazz age. Baseball finds its own boom market in a player with a jazz age personality: a troubled youth from a Baltimore reformatory school who can hit the ball further than anyone.

George Herman "Babe" Ruth is one of the best pitchers in baseball. But he loves to hit even more. In 1919, he hits 29 homers for the Red Sox, more than any player has hit in a single season.
