Schoolteacher Helen Foley (Janice Rule) finds a strange and very serious little girl, named Markie (Terry Burnham), on the stairs outside her apartment. Despite her stoic appearance, she is humming the tune to a nursery rhyme. The little girl seems to know her, and tries to jog her memory about a man she saw earlier that day. The man arrives at Helen's door and Markie runs out the back way. The man is Peter Selden (Shepperd Strudwick), who worked for Helen's mother when Helen was a child, and claimed to be the first to find her mother after she was murdered. Helen witnessed the murder but has blocked it out. She mentions Markie, and Selden tells her that was her nickname as a child, and shows her an old photo of herself. She then realizes that she and Markie are one and the same. Selden leaves, and Markie reappears. She tells Helen that she is Helen herself, and that she is there to force her to remember her mother's murder. Selden returns and confesses to the murder, and says he has tracked down the only witness to his crime, and is ready to kill her. She manages to run into the hallway and push Selden down the stairs to his death. It appears that Markie was a part of Helen that did remember the murder, and was trying to remind her conscious self of it. After talking to the police and returning to her apartment, Helen hears a young girl's voice humming the same tune as Markie was.
