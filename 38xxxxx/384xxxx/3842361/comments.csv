One of the best of the this genre."
,Infidel_,2007-12-02T16:54Z,The uncensor patch doesn't seem to work for me... Any tips?
,X-PLODE,2007-12-03T02:27Z,"there are 3 games that i have played that still had some censored bits, mostly due to the unavailability of the original CG

those games are Kana and Chain and Virgin Roster, but i think the last one was more of an oversight"
,split2nd,2008-08-24T13:09Z,I managed to have the game installed and mounted it but it doesnt load the game when i click execute. I patched the .exe file but it still wont play. Can u help me?
,legal-bay,2008-09-02T15:31Z,"split2nd,I exactly have the same prob,when I click on chainus.exe,the game doesn't start and there is a "" windows problem message""!!!!"
,gr8bishie,2008-09-29T04:01Z,"Guys, the readme files are there for a reason.
Split2nd, you may have patched it with the older version of the patcher. If you read the README in the newer version, it said it wouldn't run if the image was mounted after the patch was finished. Unmount the image and it should work fine.

Legal-bay, you didn't even patch the thing. Or, if you followed instructions and put the patcher in the same directory as the game, then ran it, it may have said ""file size mismatch"" or some such. Copy the two files in the (837301000046)chain archive (the password is the number in the file name) into the game directory, overwrite them, then run the patcher.
There you go. Read the instructions before you ask questions. It'll save you a lot of time."

,Razr90,2009-01-22T14:28Z,"Everytime i start it up even when i do put in the new patcher it says it won't ""copy the files"" Any helps?"
,bad_boy888,2011-11-22T16:20Z,"The original uncensored version doesn't seem to work.

According to the files, there's an ""uncensored""patch, but that doesn't match the filesize to the first executable.

I'm guessing the zipped one is the censored version."
,kunal1062,2012-01-06T12:55Z,"said wht was told by you however when i start the patch , i find error FILESIZE MISMATCH ......help"
,Jomppane,2012-05-11T20:13Z,"Installed and patched but when i try to run it, it just goes black screen and crashes. Help plz"
