,anacondon,2009-05-07T00:37Z,"Thanks for this obscurity I haven't seen in 20+ years.  Another I've been desperately seeking, long before the gentleman's demise and now more acutely than ever, is Deluise's directorial debut ""Hot Stuff"" (1979, w/Jerry Reed, Suzanne Pleshette, tons of cameos).  Absolutely hysterical film - i think his funniest - but impossible to locate."
