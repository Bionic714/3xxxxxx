iv allways wanted to play it online>"
,joshysquashy,2007-10-15T12:15Z,what is the difference between these two torrents you have added bikerunner?
,bikerunner1764,2007-10-15T20:45Z,This is the correct torrent the other was a bad upload that doesn't work.  You should be able to use any windows or mac serial for this game so I will leave that for you to find.  Ill be seeding for the next week non-stop but I don't have the fastest connection so be patient until it spreads.
,ElBiggus,2007-10-18T13:26Z,"The 1.3.1 crack seems a bit flaky -- reaching a checkpoint seems to have a habit of just dumping you back to the main menu with no option of continuing (you can start a new game or load a save point), and I can't get off the first map: I follow the bot to the lift, get in, hit the button, the loading screen appears, gets 20% through loading, and then I'm back to the menu. :(

Any suggestions?"
,ElBiggus,2007-10-18T21:46Z,"Tried a reinstall, and it's still useless. Don't bother downloading this unless you want to do it in 30 second bursts and only play the first 5 minutes..."
,JaVaT20,2007-10-25T16:49Z,"how to install? and don't have keygen or something...

Thank you"
,mahak420,2007-10-26T05:04Z,"The no sound with Doom 3 issue can be resolved by changing the default bit rate in your Midi Setup from 2ch - 24bit to 2ch -16Bit.


To do this, open the Audio Midi Setup control panel in the Applications/Utilities folder.

Change ""Properties For"": to ""Built - in Output"" instead of ""Built-in Mic"". This will show you the Output options. The sample rate should be at 44,100hz, but the Bit rate is defaulted to 2ch - 24bit. Change that to 2ch -16Bit. Once this is changed, Doom 3 should have sound from the internal speaker without having to plug in speakers or headphones."

,aliassmalias,2007-11-08T21:41Z,"Doesn't appear to work in Leopard, 1.3.1 update asks for your password which I find a little shady since you can install it without needing any permissions.  No instructions as to the patch ordering."

With this 1 as they said above u cant apply the update to it. it sucks."
,villagejoker,2007-12-25T18:26Z,"Hello All! Merry Christmas! Got the game to work on Mac 10.5.1/ Leopard. I think the main problem was that the ipatcher file was old and you had to replace it with a new one for leopard.

Anyhow, I got it to work so here it goes. Oh and by the way I'm not a computer expert so forgive my poor computer lingo.

1) Install Doom via the .toast file
2) Install the update Doom 1.3.1 RevA thingy. The problem is that the Doom 1.3.1 RevA file in this download installer didn't work on my mac. So I downloaded another version from http://www.aspyr.com/software/news/12/117
3) The next tip (copied and pasted a lot of it) I took from the user ""Libertius"" from his post on the Civ 4 for Mac torrent comments page:

Download the latest iPatch (3.7.1) from ipatch.org

Mount iPatch dmg, copy the ipatch app to your desktop, rightclick iPatch app, choose ""Show package contents""

Locate ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" (448 K), rightclick it and choose ""Show package contents""

Locate ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (212 K)

OK hold this ipatcher window in mind. 

Now Mount the Doom 3 v1.3.1a NODVD.

Copy the Doom 3 nodvd file to desktop. Right click -> Show package contents

Go from Contents > MacOS and Voila, you have this ipatcher file (208kb)

Replace the (208k) ipatcher file with the (212k) ipatcher file. 

Run the Doom 3 1.3.1a NODVD file with the original Doom 3 app, and you'll get a No DVD crack, no problem. Let me know if I wasn't clear or something and I'll try and get back to ya'll. "

,erremma,2008-01-30T21:10Z,"FUCK this, the shit do NOT work!"
,makizmaidrug,2008-03-06T20:53Z,"The file to replace is not iPatcher but iPatch !
You should download another crack which works with Leopard and locate this file to replace the file in the Doom's crack...
I did it, I managed to launch the patch but I got an error while I was cracking the game :(
I'm trying to solve this problem.
Any suggestions ?
Thank ;)"
,makizmaidrug,2008-03-06T22:59Z,"I've found a solution ! You'll need the UB crack at first, you must replace the file iPatch by the same file from a Leopard compatible crack.
Then, you must find the file Doom 3 at this location : Doom 3/Contents/Mac OS. Read the informations and set the permissions on ""Read and write"" for each group.
Lanch the crack, locate the game and it should work :)
Tell me if it doesn't ;)

PS : I hope you understood my comment, I think my english is not very good^^"
,makizmaidrug,2008-03-06T23:01Z,"One more thing : if you can't launch the game after cracking it, simply copy it into your Applications folder and try again."

,BenDtheTruth,2008-03-20T07:00Z,"Ok, this DOES WORK for most recent version of Leopard. It took me nearly 4 hours today but I finally got it to work with NO DVD WITH SOUND. 

The most important part is put substitute iPATCH NOT **IPATCHER** for the iPatcher file found in the Doom 3 crack, like Makiz said. Simply delete the old iPatcher and drag in the new one from the Leopard compatible ipatch found at ipatch(dot)org
"
,hatym,2008-03-26T05:40Z,"Okay, I have Leopard 10.5.2, I got it to work.  The only thing is, I cannot find a single cd key that works.  Any help?  The only way I've gotten to play the game was by hitting ctrl, option then ~.  It opens the console, then I typed Map game/site3.
Sadly, you cannot change the graphics from lowest setting and you would have to do that every single time you open doom 3."
,Metaldragon33,2008-03-28T17:28Z,"Same thing here. I managed to get it install and work OK with good help of comments, but i can't find any working key, even PC ones....

HELP!!!"
,Metaldragon33,2008-03-30T00:02Z,"OK, i find the serial solution.
GCSCH....2F serial IS working, but you just need to remove all of your internet connections (wifi, ethernet,..) when you enter it, so that the soft can't check on internet. Then it skips and tells you that it looks OK.. Don't know if this is enough to play online, but it's enough to play solo at least.."

Macmini core duo  leopard 10.5.2"
,z1ross,2008-04-28T10:04Z,"Ok Here is the dirt. 
1. Replace iPatcher file within patch as described by ""villagejoker""

2. Apply the 1.3.1 patch 

Here is the Missing Key information....

3. Right click and ""Show Package Contents"" on the Doom 3.app file 

4. Now within the Doom 3.app, The first folder it shows is the ""Contents"" Folder. Right click and Get info on this folder. Then click the lock on the bottom to enable changing of the Permissions. Change all permissions to ""Read & Write"" but don't close it yet. Then Click on the Opions button (Gear looking button to the right of the  ""-"" button and Select ""Apply to Enclosed Items"". click approve and close the window.

Now close everything open and run the patch normally and select the Doom 3.app file and you should be good to go."
,alexthecomp,2008-04-30T06:24Z,"how do i get to change the resolution? 

i applied all the patches and the game runs fine. Once i try to change the game resolution it says that i need to exit the game in order for the changes to apply. After i restart the game, the resolution stay in the default mode ""640x480' and it doesn't change.

PS. Does anyone know if doom 3 supports wide screen monitors and the resolution of 1920x1200?

It's like the game doesn't change the resolution or anything like that. 

Please help. :)"
,alexthecomp,2008-04-30T07:00Z,"i solved the problem. when u run the doom3.app you have to hold down the command key and this will open the advanced setting which will allow you to chose the wide screen resolutions such as: 1920x1200 and 1440x900. 

My other is question is if do chose these wide screen resolutions, does doom 3 run them natively or is it a lower resolution that is stretched to appear as wide screen?

thanks.  "
,tookewl22,2008-05-05T22:15Z,"I got around the serial problem - putting Doom 3 in the Security->Firewall settings and blocking incoming connections.
