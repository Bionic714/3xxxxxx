Aging film star Barbara Jean Trenton secludes herself in her private screening room, where she reminisces on her past by watching her old films. In an attempt to bring her out into the real world, her agent Danny Weiss arranges a part for her in a new movie and brings a former leading man to visit her. But this only drives her further into seclusion. Then one day, Barbara Jean's maid finds the screening room empty ? and is horrified by what she sees on the screen. Danny comes over and sees on the screen the living room of the house, filled with movie stars and Barbara Jean as they appeared in the old films. She throws her scarf toward the camera and departs just before the film ends. In the living room, Danny finds Barbara Jean's scarf.
