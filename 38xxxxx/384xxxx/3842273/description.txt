Here is the AutoPatcher in Live CD form for Win2k from late in the summer of 2007.
Sadly, Microsoft has managed to get threatening attorneys to force AutoPatcher.com to remove their download links. I see the XP and Vista editions circulating on the torrents, but found nothing for Win2K. so I took it upon myself to seed it, being as I still had it. make very, very short work of getting a new Win2K install updated and ready to roll, with only 1 single reboot. enjoyz :)
