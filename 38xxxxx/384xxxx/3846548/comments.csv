This program puts winvercheck.exe in your startup.

Also the program is useless anyway. Most of the stations do not work. The rest can be found on webpages anyway, like on streamick.com and sites like it. So don't install this malware for that.

ATTENTION! MALWARE!

... ""winvercheck.exe"" which is copied to ""c:\windows\"" plus it creates a key in ""hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\runonce"" starting ""winvercheck.exe"" next boot.
