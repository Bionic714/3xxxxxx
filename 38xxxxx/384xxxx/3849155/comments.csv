,domientius,2007-12-29T07:11Z,"I have to replace my HDD shortly and a genuine retail copy of XP was out of the question. $100 for the HDD alerady pushes my budget, another $200 for XP isn't happening. And I swear most bootleg XP versions on BT sites are crap loaded with trojans. Probably 99%.

Your file history though looks to have a lot of legit stuff so I'm giving this one a try."
,domientius,2008-01-03T08:13Z,"Worked like a charm. Unlike most XP bootlegs, this one is legit folks!"
,tattman,2008-01-12T01:51Z,"Why does it still ask for a serial number on the install, I thought this was unattended, and that was not required. It won't let you past without it. Is there a serial we need to use, any one shed some light on this for me, or there somthing I could be doing wrong."
