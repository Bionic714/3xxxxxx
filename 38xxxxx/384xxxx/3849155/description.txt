I uploaded this torrent toand somehow it showed up all over the net. A few changes were made by the users because I read that people were getting errors while installing. I've put it upon myself to upload my original ISO to thepiratebay so they can experience the same quality torrent as my fellowusers did.

Heres the original Description: 

"You are looking at a Unattended Install XP Professional SP2 Corp CD image.

Theres no activation required and it passes WGA out of the box.

You won't find this CD anywhere else, as I did everything myself and don't plan to upload to any other trackers. It's an auto installing CD, meaning you don't have to enter the Product Key or answer any questions during the installation. Once installed you can go to the Microsoft update site and download all updates.

Theres no need to apply any cracks or patches

Can easily download and install IE7 WMP11
This is a screen of the WGA diagnostic tool. That is the same VLK used in the torrent. 

Enjoy this CD as I worked hard on it. Its works like a charm. Good luck and enjoy your new XP PRO_JackDilla

ToolKit with over 13,000 valid VLKS to be used with my XP PRO CORP cd
