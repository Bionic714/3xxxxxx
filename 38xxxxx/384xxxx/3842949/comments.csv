,badfatt,2007-10-23T02:09Z,Okay I've upped this for about a week now and I only have limited space on my hard drive. Unless anyone requests I leave it longer I'll stop seeding in a day or two. There are a few complete copies out there by now.
,Waltorhomington,2008-05-18T22:01Z,"There's some good clubbing beats there, BadFatt!"
,Moragauth,2008-07-23T23:56Z,"Would really appreciate it if you could also get Tekken 6's music up, it has some great beats, esp. the warzone."
,badfatt,2008-07-28T18:25Z,"I just recorded these off the PS1, PS2 and PSP home versions. As far as I know, Tekken 6 is only in the arcades at the moment, and I don't have a PS3 anyway, so there's no way I will be getting hold of any more music."
