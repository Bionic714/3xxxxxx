,foofersgod,2007-10-27T08:23Z,thanks my husband and i love this!!! i will seed for a while to help you out too!
,platt85,2007-11-12T06:52Z,"this was fantastic.  The menu sucks, and there are over 90 chapters (not organized), but i loved that you actually did this.

the scenes in halo 3 are not of the best quality but scenes from halo 1 and halo 2 are great.  i enjoyed watching this!

I am going to seed for a while longer."

I am going to seed for a while longer. ""

the chapters were set on how many cuts scenes there was (so it was organized). im suprize you didnt like the menu. the menu was made to be a game but not. i did have a scene chapter in the menu, but i didnt like how it turned out, so i cut it out of this release. anyway im glad you enjoyed watching this DVD :) and thanks for seeding :)"
,platt85,2007-11-13T08:12Z,"sorry, i should have been more specific about the menu.

you have only one option to choose! I was thinking, what is the point of this menu! but it does look cool now that you mention it!

with the chapters, I would have made less (a lot less)

the menu would have been better with the scene option, in case you feel like making an updated version?

anywho, i am seeding for another month because you are one of the few who have done a good job."
[T],deathmule,2007-11-17T14:21Z,"im working on other projects right now, but if i get sometime i might make a new verion :)"

,markxing,2007-12-09T02:37Z,"Hey deathmule,

do ya mind if i do a 700MB file of this DVD?  sorta like axxo files in xvid format?"
[T],deathmule,2007-12-09T05:23Z,"@markxing

i dont mind if you make it 700MB file xvid format. but dont alter the movie (cutting things out). when you do upload it here, please write in the info box that your file has been ripped from my ""HALO TRILOGY by deathmule"" release. thats all i ask"

Nice job!  I watched this torrent and it helped me clear some things up.  In playing the game I found myself at times more concerned with surviving than following the plot so this was helpful.  You did a nice job.  Keep up the good work!

I've just played 1 and 2 so far.  Anyone know where to find a halo 3 torrent for PC yet??"
