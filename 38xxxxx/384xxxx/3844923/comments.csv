I have played on numerous systems with no more then the unleashed release. 

You complete knobs really need to quit trying to fix something that IS NOT BROKE.

,The_get,2007-10-17T17:17Z,"There are several errors with the Unleashed release, FYI. (Compared to the Retail/Steam one - updated ofc.)
For example, when G-Man shows up (WARNING; THIS MAY BE A SPOILER FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HASN'T PLAYED THE GAME!) and sits in a certain chair, the chair is untextured. (Purple/black boxes) Several other objects in the game are also untextured. (Fire-axes, for example, which you'll find in different places.)
And at some places, people are just spawned entities with no motion. (Ie. standing in the air with their arms out, no matter what they do or what happens to them. - For example, the welding animation (seen in the repair shop you visit before dealing with the triple autogun) seems to be missing in the Unl release, as they get a no animation then.)
There are several bugs, so don't come claim anything else! :)"
