Arguably a more balanced and informative documentary about evangelicals than Jesus Camp.

Seeing Red: A Journey Through the Moral Divide
A film by Gerry Corneau & Leah Belsky


Two Jews, a Hindu,
and a born-again Christian,
disillusioned after the 2004 election
and troubled by the idea that
their nation is bitterly divided over morality,
set out to investigate the power of
evangelical Christianity in American political life.

From Megachurches in Texas, to Music in New
Hampshire to MTV protests in New , they discover that the
fanaticism characterized in the mainstream media tells only one side
of a diverse and fascinating story of religion and politics.
