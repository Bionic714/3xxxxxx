With astounding animation, inspirational messages, and endearing characters,
Pixar Animation Studios (THE INCREDIBLES, CARS) and Walt Disney Pictures have whipped
up something special with RATATOUILLE. A rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt) lives in Paris
with a dream (and the talent) to be a chef. Opting to raid the kitchens of Paris rather than
the garbage cans and sewers of the city with his family, Remy is inspired by the philosophy
of one of the city?s most legendary chefs, the late Gusteau (Brad Garrett).

Cast: Patton Oswalt, Peter O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, John Ratzenberger
