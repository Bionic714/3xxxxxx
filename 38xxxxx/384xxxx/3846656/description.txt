This torrent contains a bunch of audio recordings of BEIRUT LIVE!

Beirut played at Avalon in Los Angeles on Oct 11, with Colleen opening (and another band before that but didn't catch the guy's name).

The recording quality is good... but what sucks is that an Avalon bouncer grabbed the recorder in the middle of the Beirut set :( He made me follow him downstairs and I thought he was gonna take away the recording device. I tried to explain that my friend John Natchez plays with Beirut and I was making the recording for him (this is true!) but he said "too bad, they don't own the rights, the group that owns the Avalon owns the copyright. You don't want to deal with them...so take this recorder to your car, and when you come back I'm gonna search you."

I figured it would be silly to waste time arguing. However, it was absurd. The most absurd part is bands not being able to record their own fucking shows. A close second is the fact that he stopped me from recording with little Cowan iAudio recorder, while at the same moment if you looked down across the crowd there was a glowing see of cell phones that people were using to record video, snap photos, and record audio clips. I didn't see them taking away everyone's cell phones... 

Aaaah well, fuck em. Enjoy the music, the first two tracks are the two opening acts, then there's what i got of Beirut, then I stuck on the song 'amapola' by fosforo cause i think that people who like beirut will appreciate the vibe. 

peace
