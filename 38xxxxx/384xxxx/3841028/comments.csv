,epa55,2007-10-13T22:50Z,Pay for this! We should all appreciate Radiohead's good example to skip the record companies and let the fans pay what they think it's worth.
,SweetMercury,2007-10-14T03:27Z,I paid for it. But I figured I would contribute to TPB a bit as well.
,thibo62,2007-10-14T23:38Z,"You should buy this music!! Your price is their price on theit website!! you can buy it 1£ if you want!! For once artists have such great ideas, we should encourage them!"
,ollemule,2007-10-15T01:49Z,I agree to what´s been said above! Pay for this at Radiohead´s website. I payed 10 quid. It´s a kick in the balls on the incompetent assholes of the record companies.
,meohmy1,2007-10-15T04:15Z,the site is to bogged down right now.. downloading today paying for it later this week once the site speeds up again.
,STGstylah,2007-10-16T17:42Z,160 kbps means crap quality. Why pay for this kind of material? Nice to know how much Radiohead cares about their fans...
,slavetoit,2007-10-18T04:23Z,If its good Ill buy it :)
,plams,2007-10-20T13:18Z,"Well, I've tried to pay. Twice. But some genius new invention to improve security concerning credit card payments doesn't seem to work in either Firefox, Safari nor Opera. (It's not Radiohead's fault I believe. It's bank specific from what I gather)"
