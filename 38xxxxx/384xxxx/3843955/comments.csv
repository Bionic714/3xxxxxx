,jason.6318,2008-06-23T07:34Z,How can I get the Game Genie to work? e-mail me at jason.6318@gmail.com and let me know plz!!
,l2oXXol2,2008-08-21T18:38Z,"sorry for any confusion but this download is merely the roms themselves this was because logically to me there are new versions of all the emulators out there.  just do a google search for ""(system) nes emulator"" without the quotes and replace the (system) with what you want to play these on, xbox/ps2/psp/windows xp/windows 2000/vista/vista x64/etc"

,Lalli1987,2009-02-03T03:26Z,"I agree, Pokemon games are usually made for Gameboy( especially with color name, for example Pokemon Yellow ), but I will try it.
And Knight rider for Nes? Hope it is better then the PC game, cause that sucks. Both episodes."
