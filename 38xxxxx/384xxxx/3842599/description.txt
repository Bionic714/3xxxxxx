Meet the Cast!
DJ Lance Rock. He's our host, and in each episode he gets the show started with the magic words, "Yo Gabba Gabba!" 

Muno, the red cyclops. He's very friendly, mild-mannered, but sometimes slightly impatient. He loves to learn and is very outgoing. Sometimes he can be a bit clumsy and has been known to break things. 

Foofa, the pink flower bubble. She's giggly, outgoing, happy, bubbly, and likes things that are cute and cuddly. But sometimes she gets a little moody if things don't go her way. 

Brobee, the green little one. He's cuddly and cute, but also cautious and needs constant reassurance. He's sometimes scared to try new things. Music, singing, and dancing help give him confidence and help him to learn. 

Toodee, the blue cat-dragon. She's very smart and independent. She's also athletic and mischievous. Sometimes she gets too excited about things and can be selfish. 

Plex, the yellow robot. He's always there to provide music, teach lessons, and use his wonderful magical powers to beam guests into Yo Gabba Gabba Land. Like a parent, he typically knows how to solve problems. 

They're all ready to sing, play, and teach whenever you are. Just say the magic words! "YO GABBA GABBA!"
