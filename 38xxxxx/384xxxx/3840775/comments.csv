,aloggy,2008-08-09T11:27Z,"This is the most amazing collection of music you will ever download. All we can do is praise this man for all his hard work and patience, seeing as most of it was aboard ship. Please seed this collection. I have downloaded the entire lot, which didn't take as long as I thought. Towerelect, you deserve a medal for your work in doing this. Thanks again and I will be continually checking for anything else you decide to throw at us. Cheers again. The only thing is, on the letter 'A' you have Alanis Morissette singing What if God was one of us, it is actually Joan Osborne, not a complaint just an update."
