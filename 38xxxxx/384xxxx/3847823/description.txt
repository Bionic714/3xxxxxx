In 1880, a man named Joe Caswell is about to be hanged for murdering a civilian. But as the noose tightens around his neck, he suddenly appears in the modern lab of Professor Manion. Manion explains that he used a time machine to randomly pluck Caswell from the past. But when Manion sees CaswellÃ¢??s rope burns around his neck, he attempts to send him back. The two men get into a fight, and Caswell ends up hitting Manion over the head with a heavy lamp. Caswell then tries to escape onto a busy street, but becomes so overwhelmed by the lights and the noise that he returns to the lab. Seeking the scientistÃ¢??s aid, he realizes that his blow has killed Manion. Then a thief, Johnson, breaks into the lab. Caswell tries to wrestle JohnsonÃ¢??s gun from him, but Johnson ends up strangling Caswell. As Johnson tries to break into ManionÃ¢??s safe, he accidentally activates the time machineÃ¢??and is sent back to 1880, appearing in the noose intended for Caswell, just in time to be hanged.
