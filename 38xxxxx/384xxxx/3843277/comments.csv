this low quality copy looks crappy on tv. "
,PureJeenyus,2007-10-16T02:42Z,still gonna buy this dvd whenever i see it
,bernsteez,2007-10-16T14:04Z,"Hey dude, could you pleeease put up a DVD rip of Optimistic?

I can and will seed it for days.

Currently I'm seeding Apples And Oranges, Catch The Vapor, and We're People Too...as well as some non-snow stuff."
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-16T15:21Z,"Well could put Optimistic DVDR up but i would take days or even weeks to seed!
As some of you who downloaded this you saw that i was disconected many times and had a max around 70 kb/s. 
So its up to you guys if you want me too put it up and seed slowly or wait and see if i can get a better conection.
State your Minds People!"
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-16T15:29Z,"For you who think that the quality is crap!
Have you noticed that its in IPOD Format and Both movies are about 150 mb.

This is for you people how really wanna see the movie or have and IPOD to put them on.

I think that you guys should all buy the movie if you like it and if you dont like the quality go buy it. they are like 15-20 bucks in most stores on the internet. "
