,monkeym4n,2010-12-07T03:13Z,"Hmm, I'd definitely seed this 200%
This is one of the hardest to find classic 90s toons I have seen!"
,monkeym4n,2010-12-08T22:28Z,"Just an FYI, there's also an episode 310 (season 3, ep10 that is)
called Buster's Directorial Debut and it's not in this torrent or the
one that has all the missing ones listed here (aside from Hero Hamton)
So 144/310 are still missing. Shouldn't be too hard to find."
,lice-m,2012-05-21T21:00Z,"Hare Raising Night is episode 114 not 112, 112 is Starting From Scratch, which is also missing."
