Plot Summary:

In the year 2054 A.D. crime is virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. thanks to an elite
law enforcing squad "Precrime". They use three genetically altered humans (called "Pre-Cogs") 
with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads 
Precrime and believes the system's flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs 
predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton 
doesn't even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery's core by finding out the 
'minority report' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that "might" tell a 
different story and prove Anderton innocent.
