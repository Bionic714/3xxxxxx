,joaomiguelxs,2007-12-03T05:02Z,yup those are indeed rar archives... just rename no.1 -- a-tekken.001.rar -- and you'll see what i mean! =P

,rudeboy007,2007-12-30T17:43Z,"When I try to extract the file I keep getting a message that I need this volume:

Tekken_Dark_Resurrection_USA_PSP-ARTiSAN\a-tekken.001.r00

But I can't find this file in the archive files.  Can anyone help?"
,Alan_T,2007-12-31T07:23Z,"@rudeboy

1. open up a-tekken.001 with WinRar
2. you should see a file called a-tekken.iso
3. drag and drop a-tekken.iso anywhere you want and you should have the iso out."
,rudeboy007,2008-01-06T21:45Z,no i tryed that but again i get a message saying i need the following volume to continue extraction Tekken_Dark_Resurrection_USA_PSP-ARTiSAN\a-tekken.001.r00 i'm not sure but i think there is something missing or i'm not doing it right.....lol
,sydh,2008-02-03T11:52Z,"ok everyone, just double click the file then click open with... and choose winrar or the program you use to unrar."
,WillisCross,2008-02-17T13:28Z,"I think whenever i should be getting an ISO file it just comes up with a ""PSP GAME"" folder and a file called ""UMD Date"" does anyone know what i'm doing wrong??"
,jlbreda,2008-02-23T12:51Z,I already rename the files to .r01 and so on but still giving error to extract. Then i rename to .r001 and also error... Can anyone help how to extract this ISO without problem?

,rick4rmdcradle,2008-02-29T13:33Z,Fake Fake Fake...tried everything dosen't work...this might be his friends who are trying to tell us here that the game works...yeah sure...waste ur time and bandwidth...
,Gordon_freeman,2008-03-13T13:54Z,"this shit doesnt work, i cant rename it and it keep saying that the file got the wrong name (i cant change that) and that i dont have enough space, ive deleted 2 movies, witch is 1,5gb and it should be able to work, but it keep saying the same message over and over again"
,darkkpianist,2008-06-13T17:43Z,"IT works just find. i have windows xp and winrar 3.7 and i used that to extract it. what u have to do is as follows:

If windows does not recognize the files just right click on the file with the lowest number in it's name.  
EX: ""a-tekken.001"" then select open with and choose winrar. when it opens up you should see tekken.iso or wat ever it may say. then you extract that where you want and that's that. It should open up all the files automatically and rebuild the iso file."
,jediamstel,2008-08-18T19:05Z,Thanks for this one works fine!
,komatos05,2008-09-03T00:01Z,can this work for my pc or do i haveta play it on psp
,piratemessiah,2008-11-25T06:29Z,"this is not a fake.  but if you can't follow the instructions/comments on using winrar, here's another copy that doesn't require any extraction:

,iFer,2009-03-25T21:45Z,"For anyone that does not know what to do with the PSP_Game and UMD Data.BIN.......

http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/666862

This Forum can explain it, it's very easy. Just download UMDGEN and then just put the folder and the bin file into it and save it as an iso or cso."
,peter1north,2009-06-14T07:16Z,"The 1st instructions is what messed everyone else up. As soon as you change that file name to a .rar, you cannot change it back and then it wants to know where the other peices are. If having this probem, this is what u do. 
when the box comes up asking for a specific file, change view to all files and choose the second tekken file (don't worry about the extension it's asking for), then open. It will then extract the rest into one iso file. WORKS 100% thanks"
,sebas997,2009-07-29T20:21Z,"Another noob with ahundred stupid questions.

SO I think i got the ISO. I might even figure out what to do with it.

Just out of curiosity.... is it normal that I only had to click on one of the many many rar files and it took like half a second. Iam always suspicous when things seem to easy. Am i on the right track..?

do you guys use daemon or is that not necessary>? "
