all of the trojans showed up right away in my AGV virus protection. I just deleted them and then everything worked great...

It's kinda scary working around trojans, but when you are determined to get this stuff working like me, its worth the risk..."

,Rubbe_66,2007-11-18T19:03Z,Is it Virus On this Torrent?XD
,EvilSpiritWalker,2007-11-22T22:57Z,Ok first off to those who are claiming a virus. These Keygens were made using Hack Tools therefore the files created in the keygen using hack tools will actually be picked up by certain virus scanners. It doesnt mean that it's going to hurt you're pc. There are actual viruses out there for windows that believe it  or not are used to help windows run smoother but thats neither here nor there. Give it a try thats all you can do and stop worrying about viruses they are just as easily removed as they are infecting you're pc.

This torrent is fine, and if you're worried about getting a trojan, you shouldn't be. They only infect when they're run, so your antivirus should automatically delete it before you accidentally open it. ZWT's Keygens are always trojan free, use those if possible."

Almost every anti-virus program will detect a keygen as a virus. This torrent, in fact, is nothing but keygens- so you would certainly expect your silly anti-virus to warn you. It's very common for this to happen, so you children who keep saying ""VIRUS DONT DOWNLOAD"" need to STFU or GTFO because you're not helping anyone here.

KEYGEN AND SERIAL NUMBER APPS WILL ALWAYS SHOW UP OR BE DETECTED AS VIRUS'S OR MALWARE!!!!

THIS IS FALSE REPORTING!

It means you have a good AV program but as
PCHelp22 below states:

""All keygen are packed and encrypted with some algorithms not supported by all antivirus programs. This antivirus scaners report some malware in this files, but are only wrong alert.""

Disregard the virus detection or you will never be able to use the fine apps that you get at this site.

Your AV program does not know how to categorize Keygen apps algorithms so it errs on the safe side and tags it as a Virus or Malware.

Please take a minute and think of what a Keygen does and you should see the logic behind this.

THEN COMPLETELY IGNORE THE AV ALERT!!!! AND HAVE FUN WITH THE PROGRAM YOU JUST GOT!!!"
