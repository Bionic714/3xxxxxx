,Kolonus,2007-10-16T01:46Z,Thank you SBM for everything.  I'd call you the aXXo of comic books if I felt like any type of official authority.  But I do have a request.  I can't find any of the original 30 Days Of Night.  The movie looks good and I want to catch up on its mythos before I see it.
,sbm_from_la,2007-10-16T06:39Z,Browse my User Name...  I've uploaded all those comics you people have requested.  They all should be available still.  You can see every Comic Pack I've uploaded.
