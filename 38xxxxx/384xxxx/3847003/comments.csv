,tallviking,2007-10-18T17:59Z,"Wht seed a freware that you can get directly from www.ubuntu.com without risking any ""extras"" like here !!???"
,superj358,2007-10-18T18:26Z,this actually has 1000 SEEDERS!!!!!
,Bedömaren,2007-10-18T19:03Z,"The reason to up this is to spread the message of open source. This is not a remake of any kind... it is directly connected to the official version which currently has 3449 seeders and 4889 leechers...

Try it. You don't even have to install anything if you don't want to. Just download, burn and restart your computer and try it directly from the CD. Easy piecey!"
,Bedömaren,2007-10-18T19:06Z,"if you prefer the official link, which is exactly the same. get it here:
http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/file?info_hash=%E0.%5E%11zZ%90%80%D5R%A1%1F%A6u%DE%86%8A%05%FEq

3400 SEEDERS shout out loud. This is great stuff!"

You can always check if its correct by checking the checksum:

,JimmyTheGent,2008-02-10T05:51Z,"well maybe not yet....still can't get my usb audio device to work with ubuntu!

Here's how to unlock the advanced desktop settings.  ""After all the updates have been installed and you reboot.""

1.) Login as root in your terminal  "" sudo -s ""
       Type in your password.

2.) Type:

sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
