,tallus,2008-01-30T10:12Z,"Seeding here :).
Thanks for the upload madmax999."
,scheleman,2008-02-16T03:30Z,"LOVE THOSE OLD MOVIES
THANKS
THEY ARE PURE AND NO COMPUTERSHIT"
,madmax999,2008-02-17T07:55Z,"This one really surprised me. Of all the movies that I put here this one has the most seeders on a regular basis. Which proves people like it enough to spend bandwidth seeding. I'm impressed.  The critics hated it if I remember right, but this is a great movie with wonderful characters."
,kacey_45,2008-02-18T05:58Z,"Another great I've been watching for... thanks
I'd sooner watch some of these old classics any day then a lot of the crap they call movies these days ... Thanks again!!!"
,TANGLEFOOT,2008-03-02T12:42Z,"they didn't swear all the time or be seen screwing the ass of all and sundry,like they do now,and a lady was a lady,not all this gay pride and poofters galore"
,peternic,2008-03-06T13:31Z,thanks
,ozaawiinimkize,2008-06-01T04:01Z,John Wayne wore a toupe - just one of the many ways in which he sucked. 
,Vikingman1111,2008-10-21T18:27Z,"madmax999,

You have infinite taste! What about Viva Zapata?"
,madmax999,2008-10-24T07:19Z,oh yeah..... Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn.  Can't believe that's not here.  Dl'g now.  I'll post when done.
,slumcat,2009-02-05T16:53Z,"The quality is okay and doesn't really do this gorgeous looking film any justice. For a very slightly better rip, download this
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4005800/JOHN_WAYNE_THE_QUIET_MAN

I downloaded that first and thought it was mediocre quality and wrote as much. Then I tried this one and this was worse."

If so i will post the link in the description.  At the time i posted this it was only one here, but better quality is ALWAYS better lol."
