A great classic movie.  I love this one.

John Wayne quits the ring after killing an opponent. Returns to his native Ireland and falls in love with Maureen O'Hara (as usual).  Gets caught by the courting rules of the society at that time.  Just a great watchable movie.

Full screen, stated as ripped from DVD, quality is very good, avi format, no subs.  Very long for its day.

You will see some of the same actors that worked with John Wayne in Fort Apache that I uploaded a few days ago.
