Hi,
So .... this is the same as:

[b][i]Once and Again - Mischa Barton and Evan Rachel Wood compilation of all clips from S03 Eps 8-9, 12-14, 17-19 WS VCD.mpg[/i][/b]

 ... but I converted it to AVI, because it is smaller and easier to play on the computer, with BSplayer. The VCD-MPG is just fucked up with the "official" Windows media player (which transmits info directly to Microsoft so you shouldn't use that anyway, so ...)

Leave a message here, if you wanna know how to:
1. [b]burn it to a CD[/b], playable in your DVD player. 
So, [b]NOT[/b] a DVD, but a normal, run-of-the-mill CD-R or CD-RW. (This works even with the cheapest DVD Players! ;)
The method uses only well-known open-source freeware that is spyware-free!  ;)

This sequence contains clips from:
[i]
Seas. 3 ep 08 The Sex Show               30 November 2001
Seas. 3 ep 09 Tough Love                  7 December 2001
Seas. 3 ep 12 Gardenia                   11 January 2002
Seas. 3 ep 13 Falling in Place            4 March 2002
Seas. 3 ep 14 The Gay-Straight Alliance  11 March 2002
Seas. 3 ep 17 Experience Is the Teacher   1 April 2002
Seas. 3 ep 18 Losing You                  8 April 2002
Seas. 3 ep 19 Chance of a Lifetime       15 April 2002[/i]

IMHO, a very heartbreaking and touching compilation.

Enjoy!
