intense research into the unknown.                
Alien FM Squared: 'Illegal Aliens'                
Remember the alien device? Well, the right button  
was 'accidentally' pressed and we got another      
transmission! Our secret laboratory is making the  
recording available to the public, so that        
everybody can hear the sound of the future...      
Since it was found, the Device has been under      
intense research. Some suggest that this is        
simply a radio forgotten by the visiting          
aliens... and the implications are astounding:    
aliens, time travel and so on... The place where  
it was found left no clues to its origin and the  
finders went missing... The only thing left was    
the device itself
