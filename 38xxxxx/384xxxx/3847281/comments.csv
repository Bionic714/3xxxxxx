DVD Rip or TV Record?"
,bryan17,2008-12-10T05:36Z,"I joined only to comment on The Universe.  I've downloaded individual episodes and been very disappointed with the quality.  I haven't finished this torrent, but the episodes that are done are clipped around the edges but are of excellent quality even on a 42"" LCD.  This is a 16:9 TV capture to answer the previous question."
