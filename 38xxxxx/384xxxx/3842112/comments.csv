1. Another valid administrator account which can normally log on. 
2. A password reset disk or a repair disc, which is created in advance ( before you lost password ). 
3. Third-party software to create a bootable password reset CD/DVD or USB, like Windows Password Reset Tool - http://www.windowspasswordreset.net . 
4. Re-install. Will lose data."
