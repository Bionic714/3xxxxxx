,Agnelli,2007-10-23T09:31Z,"Since 10.4.9 I get the Messsage:
Disk image you are opening may be damaged.
The Game works, and I really dont know what it means. (I played it on my PB with 10.3.x and I never had Problems with it. I also got it on my G5 with 10.4.10. 
Anyway:
If u re not sure, read the article and repair the DMG File.
------------------------------------------------------
Issue or symptom

Mac OS X 10.4.9 improves the ability of Mac OS X to detect damaged or corrupted disk images before mounting them. Mounting a damaged or corrupted disk image can result in data loss or corruption. This alert appears when you try to open or (mount) a damaged disk image:

""The disk image you are opening may be damaged and could damage your system. Are you sure you want to open this disk image?""

Products affected

Mac OS X 10.4.9
Solution

If you have another copy of the files that are on the affected disk image

Make a new image in Disk Utility and copy the original files to the new image.
Discard the original, affected image.
As a precaution, open (mount) the new image, open Disk Utility, and repair the new image. Continue to repair until no issues are found. 

If you have no other copy of the files on the affected disk image

Try repairing the directory structure of your disk images with Disk Utility.

Make a copy of the affected image in the Finder (select it, then from the Finder's File menu choose Duplicate). A duplicate image whose name ends with ""copy"" will be created (you will need sufficent free disk space).
Open (mount) the copied disk image file in the Finder. When the alert appears, click ""Open"". 

Important: If you are unable to mount the image in the Finder, the image may be unusable. If you are able to open the image in a previous version of Mac OS X, some data may be damaged. Use the data with caution. 

Open Disk Utility (located in the Utilities folder, within the Applications folder).
Select the copied disk image's icon in the left side of the Disk Utility window, then click Repair Disk. A verification will be performed and, if necessary, repairs. 
Click Repair again. Repeat this step until no issues are found on the image. 

Note: If repairs cannot be performed because the image is read-only, convert the image to a read/write format with a new name (don't replace the existing image with a same-named image). Then perform step 4 and 5 on the converted image. After repairs are complete, you can convert the image back to a read-only format and rename it if desired.
You should now be able to use the disk image without any issues. 

Additional information

It is possible for a damaged disk image to cause directory issues to your Mac OS X volume.

,wurstfinger,2007-10-23T11:26Z,Seeding has slowed down extremely at 78.56% for me. Let's see if we still get a complete seed.

,Agnelli,2007-10-25T16:41Z,"I really don't know. All what I can tell you is:
I installed it for 2 Years on my PB G4 and Imac G5, and never had Problems with my System. The Message came with 10.4.9. So i reinstalled THIS file without repairing, and it still works."

Thank you Agnelli for uploading and thanks to all the seeders. This game is great!"
,ben_nobre,2009-02-12T17:44Z,"I can't get to run this game in Leopard: I updated to 1.4.1, went to the main folder, opened the autoexec.cfg and added the line ""set r_fullscreen ""1"""" but no changes."
,nickthenack99,2011-12-06T15:25Z,"Thnx man works like a charm! =D

only problem I had was that if you try to use a resolution that is bigger than your screen you will get the error ""Couldn't start OpenGL"" so open Main/wolfconfig.cfg and lower the resolution by looking for the line:

seta r_mode

and change the value to 3 and when you start it up it will work but will be 640x480.


I did a hack to get widescreen working properly so open Main/wolfconfig.cfg and look for the lines:

seta r_customheight
seta r_customwidth
seta r_fullscreen
seta r_mode

change it to:

seta r_customheight ""x""
seta r_customwidth ""x""
seta r_fullscreen ""1""
seta r_mode ""-1""

set the height and width to the native resolution of your monitor.

and enjoy widescreen!!! =D"
