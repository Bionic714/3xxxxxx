,amiONE,2007-10-15T20:49Z,"It's the real deal.. Watching it now. 

Den 채r 채kta. Tittar p책 den nu. "
,deltix1,2007-10-15T23:32Z,"real deal, it's no fake"
,Draconus_87,2007-10-15T23:47Z,does it have all the FX? cause the 1 ep i dled had no FX and was boring and could hear som1 yelling bang in the backround when there was supposed to be an explosion :/
,muzza168,2007-10-16T03:11Z,"i'd guess it has no FX draconis.

Every pre-release has been without FX. Worth waiting 3-4 days i reckon."
,tomdoodle,2007-10-16T08:12Z,"It's probably exactly the same as
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3834712/StarGate_Atlantis_4x04_Doppelganger_(leaked_out).avi

It's the completed episode and has been leaked by a mistake from itunes.

It's the real deal, but I wonder why some ..... just keep uploading the same file again and again (this is the third upload of this file) instead of seeding the original torrent and keep it alive and vivid ...."
,jgrass,2007-10-17T17:28Z,its all good... and with SFX 
,Cloudbane,2007-10-19T18:12Z,Gteat one tnx m8 :-)
