At the start of the episode, the protagonist Henry "Rocky" Valentine is robbing a pawnshop. He shoots a night watchman, and then a policeman, but before he can get away he is shot and killed by another police officer. He wakes up to find himself seemingly unharmed by the encounter. He is in the company of a pleasant individual named ?Pip?, who tells Rocky he is his guide and instructed to grant Rocky whatever he desires. Rocky immediately assumes he has died and gone to Heaven and Pip must be his guardian angel. Later, he becomes so thoroughly bored by always having his whims satisfied and predictably winning at anything he attempts, he finally begs Pip to send him to the ?other place? (referring to Hell). Pip then reveals that "this is the other place!" Valentine tries vainly to leave while Pip laughs uproariously.
