The setting is a small railway station in a small east european town. Two railway janitors (Marek and Darek) are oggling the female commuters. Into this scene walks Ursula Novak (Mrs Morality) - the leader of the Morality Party. She wants to ban all types of pornography and eroticisim from society. The duo imagine Ursula in the nude. She sees them and asks them they way to Ivancice. Marek, however, imagines she is asking for a good seeing to and happily obliges with the help of Darek and a passer by. Soon, all three are naked in the station with Miss Morality getting all three of her tight holes pummeled. After a heavy facial we switch to reality where Miss Navak waits for an answer. ON receiving directions she walks off but slips up on a pool off water and ends up sitting on the floor, disheveled with a bucket on her head and her pants around her ankles. This earns Marek a slap
