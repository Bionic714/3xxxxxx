,Fritz1945,2007-10-23T00:31Z,Very fast download speed at 1st about 7mb then slowed down. We need more seeders for this torrent.
,Aza76,2007-10-23T00:39Z,"as soon the next eps. is out ill start seeding it too
"
,spamjangled1,2007-10-24T08:41Z,"Nice one for the torrent, keep it up!!"
,Kowalski1977,2007-10-24T11:27Z,"I'm not one to complain normally but I joined this torrent last nite around 7pm which most ppl max finish was 80.3% completed, It's now 10.20am the following day and max completion is 87.5%, has the uploader got some seriously slow speed, it's only a 1.7GB file, I wouldn't mind but so far I can watch ep1 the whole way through even though it's 99.7% done, ep2 I had to download elsewhere because I was getting nowhere with it, ep3 I'm 99.9% complete but somehow i still can't watch it even with VLC, ep4 100% done but what's the point in watching that when i need to see the previous episode, I only need 0.1% so that I can see episode 3 then I'm finished, i got ep5 elsewhere too btw so plz uploader give us some speed plz"
,Kowalski1977,2007-10-24T11:52Z,Just to help things out the copy of ep 2 i got elsewhere is the same as the one with this torrent so i have added it to this folder which should hopefully boost a few of you ppl up
,Kowalski1977,2007-10-24T12:13Z,"genious!!! ok ppl even better... by renaming ep3 to the same as another single torrent i was able snag the remaining 0.1% which i have renamed it back to it's original status and readded to this torrent so now we should be full steam ahead, it looks like i'm 99.9% totallycomplete on this torrent but the only thing that will hold you back is my max upload which is 33.3kbps so hopefully it should be enough to help you complete this other wise if you all do what I said I did above you can jump back onto this torrent and help seed"
,Kowalski1977,2007-10-24T12:24Z,even better again i'm giving this torrent to a friend and he's gonna help seed
,Fritz1945,2007-10-24T19:39Z,thx man finally got to see what happened haha. but we need this guy to add on the episodes comin up
,siiix,2007-12-28T16:15Z,"i stayed tuned but do not have 11 episodes as of now ?! 

would be nice t have a torrent with all episodes so i do not have to download them 1 by 1"
,Gryyy,2008-03-28T12:41Z,please seed!!
