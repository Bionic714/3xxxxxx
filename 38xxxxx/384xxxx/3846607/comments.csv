,frijolito,2008-03-11T22:38Z,"oh bog the same questions in every psp torrent ... yes, you need a custom fw. no, we can't (rather, won't) help you here with that, this is a torrent site not a psp hacking site. yes, you can find help on the web. psp-hacks.com/forums is as good a place as any to start."

Just DLed this, but can't seem to get it to work. Screen goes black and powers off after initial loading screen. Have CFW 3.52, do I need to upgrade my CFW for this to work properly?"
