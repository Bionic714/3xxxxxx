Classic Western - Black and White

In a time when "The West" pretty much ends in Texas and only California is slowly being populated by the white men, there's a severe lack of women among the workers on Roy Whitman's farm in the California Valley. So he goes back east to Chicago to recruit wives for his employees. From the candidates he selects 150, who seem able to survive a months long journey across "The Great American Desert" and the Rocky Mountains.

This is not available in DVD remaster yet.  This is a VHS rip.  It is however, good quality and when I go full screen for the playback, the detail remains quite good.  Only one source on the entire eDonkey network.
