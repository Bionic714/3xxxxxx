My name isn't Don, but I did pres F6 on a broken Kaypro keyboard I've had in a cabinet. Nothing happened to the screen, but there are some holes in it where it broke a few summers ago, and now houseflies get in whenever I open the window. I just don't understand what I did wrong. Should I change my name to Don?"

Now you have to make up five outrageous chain letters and send them each to fifty addresses within two days, else all your socks will spontaneously combust on Thursday, December 20th, and by Christmas your hair color will have gradually changed to ""white with green glow-in-the-dark spots."""
