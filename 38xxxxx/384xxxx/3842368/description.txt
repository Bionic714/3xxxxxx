It?s one of the newest app in mobile DJ-ing, if we compare it to VirtualDJ or Traktor DJ. Deckadance comes from Image-Line, publisher who stands behind well known DAW application - FL Studio. Personally, i like Deckadance?s native support for most of hardware/midi controllers such as Behringer BCD2000/3000 series, Vestax VCI-100, and so on. No matter if you?re a hobby DJ or pro, give it a try. Also i must quote Image-Line: ?Of course, if you suck as a DJ, you will still suck using Deckadance, but you will suck better, faster, harder and more creatively than ever before!?  ;-)

Deckadance is a DJ mixing application that works either as a standalone program OR as a VSTi plugin inside your favourite host. Deckadance itself can also host any VST compliant softsynth or effect.

You can control Deckadance (Club Edition) using most (if not all) existing midi controllers & timecoded vinyl and CD systems.
