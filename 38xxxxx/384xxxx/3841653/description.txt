The first T-28 made its initial flight on September 24, 1949. Designed as a replacement for the T-6 trainer, the Trojan went into production in 1950. The USAF version (T-28A) was powered by an 800-hp. engine, whereas later U.S. Navy versions (T-28B and C) were powered by 1,425-hp. engines. When production ended in 1957, a total of 1,948 of the three different versions had been built.
