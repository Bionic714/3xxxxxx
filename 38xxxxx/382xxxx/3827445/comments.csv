,zxchaosmunkixz,2007-10-03T21:50Z,"I grabbed this last night, its the real deal. working perfectly on 3.71 m33-2. 

BTW, about file sizes: The original PSX version converted to PSP eboots was only about 300mb compressed, so it shouldn't be too big of a suprise that they were able to fit this game inside of 200mb. "
,radiozero,2007-10-08T07:32Z,"I DNL it and i am trying to put it on my PSP now. do i extract the .Rar's, then load the file named PSP_game and the.Bin file to the psp MSP?"
,nickstick17,2007-10-08T20:29Z,"Is this NTSC or PAL? I wish people would indicate them on ALL posted torrents because I've downloaded so many PAL versions that didn't work with my PSP. So yeah, is it NTSC or PAL? North-American or European?

Thanks"
,undeadscenekids,2007-10-10T00:06Z,do you have to have a custom firmware to play this

,tonycolussi,2007-12-12T01:28Z,"Help!  I have a hacked PSP, but some games don't work... This one included.  Is there a newer version  that I need (I have 3.03) or is there something else I can do?"
,shirizaki,2007-12-17T16:19Z,"Yes, you need at least 3.50 custom F/W."

,zayl25,2008-03-17T00:36Z,hi would someone be able to exlain to me how to make this game work on my psp 
,coolguyb,2008-03-17T16:33Z,no matter what hacked version you have there is going to be the odd game that won';t work. i've had 3 different fireware version so far and i still get the odd game that won't play. just the way it is when hacking stuff. be happy enough you can play any d/l games. 
,austinoneal88,2008-03-30T06:42Z,How do I install this one? I have 3.71 m33-2 but this is a different game.
,seeminglydead,2008-04-28T15:47Z,"to fix some games:

hold the off button for like 40 sec
after psp is off, turn on while holding the R button. now you get into the boot menu
go to settings_> then change the -no umd boot mode- to a different one (theres like 5 choices)
try a few (especially the sony one) and you will notice that some games that didnt work before now work."
,omegastar013,2008-06-10T19:09Z,there are no iso/cfo files in this download. where do i put the files? do i have to convert to iso somehow?

You have to extract all those at the same time and iso pops out."

,cLoudTwo,2009-04-02T22:26Z,"i have 3.71 m33-2 and i extract all the files, load them into my psp and it only shows corrupted data. anyone know what might the problem be? i hope i am just putting them into my psp wrong. thanks"
,NASTY_138,2009-04-19T01:33Z,"cLoudTwo, you need to download, install and enable popstation in your plugins."
,jerome_hiponia,2009-06-02T07:09Z,"FTW? another software so that i can play this game? can anyone upload cleaner copy of psp games? im having problem how to play this game. i have custom firmware - 5.00 m33 but still, i cant play it or even see it in my game list. does anyone have any good instruction for that?"
,theringmastress,2009-06-15T07:40Z,do i have to have a psp to play this or can i play it on my pc 
,killeryopattie,2009-07-21T19:15Z,"for people who doesnt know whow to load this into the psp, download the latest custom firmware for the psp or get a emulator for the computer. then once the download is done, extract the first file to a location that u desire. if the file is iso or cso, put in the iso folder if u want this inside your psp. or if its a game file thats in a folder, u put in inside your game folder of ur psp. i.e. e:psp\game for game folder. and e:iso for the iso folder"
,PabloOaks,2010-06-16T15:18Z,"Thanks for upload it, but, this is an ""untouched"" version? Cuz i wanna put the hacktics under it...

It's just you."
,XXD1XX,2012-06-26T15:42Z,"@People asking if they can play this on their PC - There's only one known PSP emulator and it's terrible and not updated/supported anymore so the frame rates are terrible and honestly it's not even worth downloading. 

Just buy a PSP, you can get them used for around $70US in GameStop or online. 

Also - For anyone that wants this game with the 1.3.1.0 insane difficulty patch already applied you can get it right here - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7188867/Final_Fantasy_Tactics___War_of_the_Lions_(1.3.1.0_patched)"
,satvik123star,2012-07-07T15:01Z,Works well on 6.60 Pro B-10 Thanks
,darthagnan86,2012-08-16T00:42Z,"For original version of Psx http://thepiratebay.se/user/darthagnan86/
