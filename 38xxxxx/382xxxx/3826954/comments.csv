,ellefi3,2009-03-15T14:03Z,"At the moment it seems that everyone is stuck at 66.7%. The complete torrent can be found here:

Just remove the old torrent from your bittorrent client (but NOT the files!!!), rename the file folder of the stuff you've already downloaded to ""Season 1"" and click on the new torrent. It will ask you something like ""files will be checked and overwritten if necessary"". You click ""Yes"" and voila your torrent is on its way to competion. :)"
