[V],room101bellboy,2008-04-27T18:33Z,"Hi,

 If you liked this movie as much as I did, I recommend that you also watch Simpan (1999), a short film that Oldboy s director, Chan-wook Park, made before The Vengeance Trilogy. I have uploaded this very rare torrent; it s located in the following link:

,ZenRhino,2008-12-08T07:34Z,"I got the latest xvid codec and it has VobSub included with it... so when I have the subtitle file in the same folder as the movie file (both files need to have the same exact title - not including file extensions of course - for this to work) it AUTOMATICALLY hardcodes the subs to the movie when I use both Win DVD Maker and DVD Movie Factory 5.3

,bobadigilatis,2009-11-24T14:15Z,"Thanks to  room101bellboy for Simpan.

Those of you complaining about not having hard coded subtitles take a minute to think about all those foreigners that want to watch this NON ENGLISH movie in another language, say Spanish. It's a little infuriating trying to watch alternative subs when there are rather annoying hard coded subs.

Cmon' you managed to figure out how to download and play a torrent, surely you can figure out how to play .srt's. Just use google."
,nymersic,2009-12-06T03:08Z,I can't stand hard-coded subs.  Thanks.
