Here's a tip from Aeorosoft on placing all these sceneries in correct order in the library.  This would be the install order but you can install them in any order you wish (except Germany 1 to 4, they should be installed in correct order) as long as they appear in the Library in the REVERSE order of what we see below.

1. Scenery Germany 1
2. Scenery Germany 2
3. German Airports 3
4. Scenery Germany 3
5. German Airports 1
6. German Airports 2
7. German Airports 4
8. VFR Berlin 2006
9. Mega Airport Frankfurt
10. Scenery Germany 4
11. Real Germany 1
12. Real Germany 2
13. Real Germany 3"
