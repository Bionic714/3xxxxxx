,DJTWO,2007-10-01T01:31Z,Dreams are animated wallpaper in either .Dream format (preferable) or .MPEG or .WMV format. They require the user to have Windows DreamScene installed (part of the Windows Vista Ultimate Extras) and Stardock DeskScapes to use .Dream files. The result is a spectacular animated desktop experience that uses relatively little CPU and resources thanks to the 3D hardware acceleration of Windows Vista.
