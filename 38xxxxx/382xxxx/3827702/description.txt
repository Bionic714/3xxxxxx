Size: 55.4 mb

My latest sampler. The reason it's called unaffected is that i've been
dissed by alot of haters lately, for no reason. Just pure jealousy.
And i wanted them to know that i am not affected by them dissin' me.
It's the same haters checking my site every now and then for new media.

This one took me about 5 hours to shoot spread within two weeks. It was fun,
but i was also depressed by the stuff i was training on. It was old and
when im used to grass, its hard to do backhandsprings on something like that.
But i hope you like the video.
