AUTHOR NOTES:

This game has been edited with all commercials removed. Please seed this torrent once you complete the download. With my DSL connection, I don't have a great upload speed, but with your help, we can make sure everyone gets the show.

I will be testing this out for a few weeks to see how many people are interested in downloading the games. If enough people are interested and enough people seed the game, I'll make this a permanent effort for the Mountain West on-line community. If not, I'll stop and leave it up to everyone else to watch the games on TV. Enjoy!
