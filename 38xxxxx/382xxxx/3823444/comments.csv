,Primo-Weed,2009-06-24T02:36Z,"To mount a CD image you need to download a program such as PowerISO or Daemon tools. These programs turn your USB slots into virtual CD drives.

Google instructions, it's easier to do that it sounds.."

,Wackycrashbandicoot922,2010-06-15T09:54Z,"Hey guys I have a problem, It works great and all but now I have an issue with the config menu. The rendering system I use is DirectX9, and it is permanatly put on OpenGL, Which will not work, I have tried changing config.cfg but no difference. Euro Truck Simulator works great because it can be switched to DirectX9. Any help is great. Thanks!"
,klavsc,2010-07-06T19:03Z,"You cant change it.
The game engine is only on openGL."

,sanketex,2011-10-27T19:15Z,"Guys help me out!
I have Windows XP SP3, Pentium D 3Ghz, 2gb ram,nVidia gt220 1gb GPU.
Here is my problem:
I've unpacked .rar file then mounted it by using demon tools, installed game succesfully. When I tried to run game, it gives error that,
""o.s. is not proving window to render graphics"",
followed by secound error that,
""C++ runtime liabrary error"".
I can play its trail version. But fails on full version.
Please tell me what to do?"
,sanketex,2011-10-28T07:21Z,"I found solution for my own problem.
Any on having same problem can use this solution.
If you having problem of OS window not support or C++ runtime error, then you can download and install, ""18 wheels of steel pedal to the metal V1.07 patch"" after installing game.
Good luck!"
