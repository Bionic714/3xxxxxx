As RAF Bomber Command took the war to the enemy under Air Marshall Arthur Harris, the four-engined Avro Lancaster reigned supreme, replacing the rugged, reliable Wellington in laying waste to German cities by night. 

This most successful of all World War II 'heavies' could carry more than it's own weight in bomb load, including the 22,000 pound Tallboy - the biggest conventional weapon ever made. And when fearless Guy Gibson led 617 Squadron to fame on the low-level Dambuster raid - one of the war's most daring operations - the Lancaster was confirmed as an aviation Legend. 

With recent colour film of 'City of Lincoln', the RAF's last airworthy Lancaster, among the wartime footage, this is the Lancaster's dramatic story.
