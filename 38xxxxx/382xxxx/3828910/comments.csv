,Cheaptrixter,2008-09-28T00:07Z,I have just started using Pirate Bay and need help...Should it take 18 hours to download a file at 700mb?  Also how do I seed? I am new at this and want to do my part in sharing.
,Cheaptrixter,2008-09-28T00:11Z,I am downloading a 700mb file from 17 hosts and its at 8% for the last three hours with a turbo-charged connection on Frostwire...is this normal?
,Cheaptrixter,2008-09-28T00:19Z,"Yes...the missing reels,skips,burn outs and flickering were all intended.  I thought it was a really neat idea too using the vintage commercials and the fake previews too!"
