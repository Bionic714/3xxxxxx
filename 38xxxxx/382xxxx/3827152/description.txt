Iboga Records Presents the new album by Ace        
Ventura "Rebirth".                                
Behind "Ace Ventura" stands Yoni Oshrat from      
Israel. Under the name "Ace Ventura", Yoni has    
found himself very successful with his formula of  
fat pumping progressive trance. A sound which has  
seen him make it quite big, these days playing    
all over the world as one of the most requested    
act / dj.                                          
Ace Ventura already had some very big tracks on    
Iboga, namely "Cardiac Arrest" & "R.I.S.E.",      
which is to be found on the compilations "Set:4    
Essentials" & "Hibernation" respectively.          
Yoni also enjoyed success some years back as a    
part of the duo "Psysex", which made it quite big  
in the full-on circles, and is also behind the    
project "Schatsi", which is concentrating on      
Electro-house music.                              
The album "Rebirth" has been very carefully        
written during a long time and at Iboga we are    
sure that it will be among the best and biggest    
of 2007.

After more than a half decade we think it is time  
to change this message. The scene changed so much  
in the past few years. Many lamers hangin' around  
sharing scene  releases on  public places such as  
FXP-Pubs, DC++ hubs,  P2P  networks  and  so  on.  
WE  DON'T  WANT  OUR  RELEASES  GETTiNG      
SPREAD  TO  SUCH  LAME  PLACES!!!          
The psytrance scene is kinda small and needs YOUR  
SUPPORT. If  you LOVE  this  music  (like we do),  
please BUY the music  (like we do)!  Artists work  
long & hard on their music.  Please be honest and  
support the  artists & labels  to make more great  
music in the future too.  Every sold  CD  counts!  
Our  releases are  meant  for promotion only - to  
give  you  a  sample  of  the  retail  product.  
NEVER FORGET - THiS iS NOT A COPY, iT'S JUST MP3!  
Furthermore we wanna say thanks to all the people  
who made this  whole thing  happen,  in the past,  
present and future.  And finally, we want to send  
greetings  to  all our  fellow  friends  within  
the    scene!  You  know    who    you  are!  
MUSiC WORTH LiSTENiNG iS MUSiC WORTH BUYiNG!!      
groov[e]mission - quality & pride since 2ooo
