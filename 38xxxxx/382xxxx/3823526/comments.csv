,jpenaavila,2007-10-15T05:52Z,"three39three:
you seed by letting your bit torrent program keep uploading while the download is finish, that way you give to the comunity more of what you got from it (if only the real world where like bit torrent [sighs].

Your torrent program will do this automaticly unless you make him stop by not sharing after your donwload is finish.

Keep seeding people! :)"

,akrchstn,2009-05-09T19:48Z,"God I hope this is tagged good, I hate re-tagging or having to change everything in winamp just because I hate having 2 different artists on torrents, like if I download the VAC discography it will be one artist called Velvet Acid Christ - #albums then one artist called Velvet Acid christ - # albums or something like that."

,CharFace,2010-01-16T01:32Z,"Thanks a million.  My music drive just took a dive and I lost most of it.  RHCP is in my top 5 and I gotta have it!  BTW, this download buried the needle of my connection at just over 1 MB/s"
,Gman2693,2010-03-17T16:14Z,Thanks so much 10/10
,Raventhorn,2010-03-19T20:27Z,"@suxx.x
If you have everything in FLAC (Free LOSSLESS Audio Codec), why bother downloading MP3 (Lossless)? :P
Just DL WinAMP or sumthing similar to play it and enjoy ;)"
,Filmaddict41,2010-04-04T02:56Z,Bitrate please...  People have been asking for a while... 
,prownager360123,2010-04-23T19:09Z,"Who cares about the bitrate. Seriously, its RHCP. No need for a high bitrate. Its awesome by itself."
,S4RS,2010-05-02T22:08Z,Could this also be updated with the Greatest hits album?
,eagertestical,2010-06-15T08:33Z,"awesome torrent, downloading now to check bitrate :P"
,celerity21,2010-06-18T19:53Z,"@ Raventhorn: FLACs' occupy about 4 times as much space on the harddisk as 320kb/s mp3s'. so, you tell me. lol"
,IamDUFF,2010-10-12T16:28Z,"Look, as a musician who can play all these songs on a beat up classical, FLAC is a waste. If you want quality get a VOX half stack, and get a frikkin band ye lazy bum."
,LOROBOY,2010-12-01T18:55Z,"Auras2065 friend thanks for the upload, but put the rates of bitrates of the songs!

This discography has a few albums with 320k, and other albums with other bitrates, including some songs with rates of 185k, however, most are with bitrates ranging from 200k to 320k.

Anyway, have not found any around here with all the albums at 320k, only in FLAC, but then let those who want to spend a lot of HD."
,Wolfy2710,2010-12-24T11:41Z,It's all 192Kbps
,koudepinda,2011-02-12T22:17Z,any one got this shit in some real quality??? size doesnt matter

,KrashLee,2011-03-02T14:15Z,"only some of the albums are 320kbps (blood sugar sex magik, californication, by the way, can't stop, and a few others) the rest are 192kbps among others that are pretty random. I'm just going to convert the 192ks (and the other ones) to 320k and i'll post the whole thing up as a torrent when i'm done. give me like a week to do this as i'm a busy person and it'll take a while."

,boondoddle,2011-11-27T01:30Z,"Thank you! I do have most of their albums, but they won't rip. I guess I messed them up in my car. thanks again :)"
