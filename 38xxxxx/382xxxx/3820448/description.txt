This is the text from the 1940 classic by Jesse Livermore. I didn't OCR the last few pages that have the silly tables he had for examples. The 'meat' of the book is all there, and this is small book.

Next I going to upload Jack Schwager's 'Market Wizards'. This was the first of his 3 books where he interviews traders. Many think that it was his best of the three.

Could somebody PLEASE sead the torrent for 'The New Market Wizards' Schager's second book? The torrent is 3 months old and I want a copy. Enjoy.
