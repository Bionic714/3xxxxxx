,pellypels,2007-09-30T17:56Z,Eh - latest version being Final Cut Studio 5.1.4 kinda makes this one quite nostalgic to say the least??
,BytorrTorrent,2007-09-30T18:29Z,"sorry pellypels, but this IS the latest version, check out the apple page and find out,       
    After install I get the software update for pro apps and now I can say I have the latest.

One mor thing,  about the problem on the SN keep asking it everytime here is the solution:

,JPyre,2007-10-01T06:52Z,"So... is it 5.1.4 or is it Final Cut 6.**? Either pellypels is living under a rock or idk, I know it took months from FCS2 announcment for it to come out but...."
,pellypels,2007-10-01T16:49Z,Waste of time anyways - No seeder!
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-01T17:43Z,"Server is down,  I will seed until few peolpe download it complete."
,pellypels,2007-10-03T12:24Z,"I might have been wrong about the version number, but the fact is BytorrTorrent that tracker is up and you're not seeding!!

So what's the point?"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-03T13:51Z,"Be Patient my friend,  Of course is a bit slow,  this torrent is only 3 days old, and its 3.3gb,  like I said before I will seed non-stop untill few people finish the download.  So far is 2.48gb up.   So don´t get nervous,  with the number of leachers in a few days this will fly (if the rest keep on seeding).   Cheers"
,pellypels,2007-10-03T18:17Z,Allright then BytorrTorrent - I'll keep my Panties on!
,scunky,2007-10-04T16:00Z,everyone stuck on 41%....booo!

,scunky,2007-10-04T16:07Z,boooooooo!!
,slobeck,2007-10-05T01:17Z,You need the content disks to install the suite. The whole thing weighs in at a little over 52GB it's several DVD DL disks. Search isohunt 
,slobeck,2007-10-05T01:18Z,"Sorry, I should have noted: don't DL this.  You NEED  all the disks. "
,scunky,2007-10-05T12:01Z,No one is seeding. this torrent is dead!!!!!
,pellypels,2007-10-05T15:20Z,"Sorry BytorrTorrent - I'm giving up on you..

BYE!!"
,masterbluestar,2007-10-08T18:53Z,Is this torrent finished and complete? Everyone is stuck at 40%!
,mikki11,2007-10-08T23:18Z,please seed someone and does it work final cut studio 2
,ocean_man,2007-10-09T10:04Z,"it stucks at 42,1%. damed. what else can we do than wait? "

,mikki11,2007-10-09T12:44Z,please seed someone
,mikki11,2007-10-09T12:49Z,seed please 
,rnumann256,2007-10-09T15:03Z,"Could somebody seed this, please. I'll seed it for a week when you're done."
,doriansend,2007-10-09T23:40Z,"Piggybacking ""slobeck""'s comment from earlier.....does anyone have any intuition on if this actually contains ALL the apps? The only FCS i've seen that has been verified to contain everything was 52gb. Are we all just hoping here, or does anyone have an insight that we're not all wasting our time to find out that it's only FCP....thx."
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-09T23:55Z,"Sorry! I got back today, went out for the weekend.   
I´m BACK ON SEEDING"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-10T00:04Z,"And Yes this are only the apps., like I said on the info above.   The hole FCS2 apps, that means:"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-10T00:05Z,"Final Cut Pro 6
 Motion 3
 Color
 Soundtrack Pro 2
 DVD Studio Pro 4
 Cinema Tools
 Compressor "
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-10T00:06Z,"The original FCS2 is really 55G. this is only 4.something, because it doesn´t include the contents of each app.  Wich are the templates, tutorials, extra effects and so on. "
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-10T00:07Z,"But the apps. works Ok,    When the installer ask you for the disks, just skip that.  The enter the Sn and you are done. "
,doriansend,2007-10-10T00:49Z,"BytorrTorrent thanx for answering my question. When you say ""no extra effects"" do you mean plugins? These are fully functional with all features, just w/o tutorials/manuals/templates? I'm assuming we can download the manuals right? Please seed, and you da man if this works!"
,srlediesel,2007-10-10T15:18Z,CAN SOMEONE SEED PLEASE? I have 44% already...
,VandelayIND,2007-10-10T20:33Z,So where can I get the manuals? 
,VandelayIND,2007-10-10T20:40Z,And why do I need to turn of virus protection software before installing?
,doriansend,2007-10-11T00:21Z,This is really lame....we've only moved 3% the whole day! I gotta leave for LA in 3 days!!
,doriansend,2007-10-11T00:23Z,"BytorrTorrent: At one point today I was getting 80kb/sec on this thing, and now have been at 0 for hours. Are you consistenly seeding, or r u turning your machine off and on throughout the day? If that's the case this could take a month."
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-11T09:43Z,"Well yes I´m seeding non-stop, actually all night and day, and I even stop other downloads in transmission to keep all bandwidth for this one, I don´t know why is so slow, any ideas?"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-11T09:47Z,The manuals are included
,srlediesel,2007-10-11T10:12Z,it shows me there is no seed. i am at 45.6% and not downloading. there are plenty of peers but zero seeds :(
,srlediesel,2007-10-11T10:19Z,"see? http://ukazto.com/?img=1063231,Picture2.jpg"
,QuickSander,2007-10-11T20:54Z,"Its looking medium/good now though. 4/5 seeds. 21,5KB/s down. Just push through everybody. We are getting there."
,srlediesel,2007-10-12T00:28Z,"4.3% a day :( 
now i am at 0 kB/s download for almost 6 hours"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-12T00:32Z,"Ok, now is seeding faster, hope it doesn´t take long."
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-12T00:33Z,"there are some problems with the piraterbay page itself, thats why sometimes it crashes, too many traffic!"
,doriansend,2007-10-12T03:36Z,Ok BytorrTorrent....i Have faith in you. If this works then you are the f***ing man! If not then i'll be sad :( I've got the faith!
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-12T11:14Z,What % do you have now?
,srlediesel,2007-10-12T12:26Z,"i have 48.6% :( still seeds=zero, peers>50"
,ocean_man,2007-10-12T13:46Z,"I have 57,7% now. "

,merltock,2007-10-13T12:50Z,"99.9%... 72GB uploaded, 21.739 ratio :("
,Ramsy,2007-10-13T13:36Z,"BytorrTorrent excuse me, but what you can give me the code of DVDTEST, please, without her, I can not do anything"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-13T14:10Z,"Read carefully all the info above, you'll find everything there.   I recomend to use latest stuffit (I used version 11 for the zip file).  Pleas don´t stop seeding!"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-13T14:12Z,anyway the code for unrar is    www.niuu.com
,doriansend,2007-10-13T16:28Z,Has anyone tried this yet? I can't install it till later tonight. Anyone had any luck? What's the word?
,djdeejay,2007-10-13T19:15Z,"hmm for some odd reason it'll install everything, with updates except for the actual final cut program, which stays greyed out on installed with ""skipped"" next to it and wont let me changed that....annoying."
,jheggar,2007-10-13T23:21Z,the unrar password isnt working.  any ideas?
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-14T12:42Z,"Yes it is working, the passphrase is the whole ad:        
www.niuu.com  "
,mikepalmer2403,2007-10-14T19:14Z,"hi guys

I have tried to install but it asks for disks and I cannot skip????"
,Spanky743,2007-10-15T09:52Z,To stop it asking for DVDs you need to remove all the 'content' when selecting which programs to install.
,PapaMoose,2007-10-15T22:28Z,why is final cut not an install option? please supply some clear installation guides...cheers
,masterbluestar,2007-10-16T18:52Z,Anybody succeed yet at installing FCP6 from this?
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-16T21:35Z,Why would you install just the FinalCut  when the cool thing about Final Cut Studio is the integration between the apps?.  
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-16T21:38Z,"But if you insist, just check the Final Cut Pro 6 box at install and uncheck the others, very simple."
,mystec,2007-10-17T08:11Z,I don't think this is worth it...very buggy and decides to NOT work!
,PapaMoose,2007-10-17T09:55Z,"i had to install fcp6 on a powerbook that was free of any previous fcp's then transfer the program to my imac. also, as there's no content, motion won't work as it needs the templates."
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-17T13:15Z,"I´ll soon post the contents on different torrents, I´ll start with motion
any succesufull install?"
,phongho3,2007-10-17T21:35Z,"can i get some help here? On a lot of the rar files i keep getting ""An error occurred attempting to expand 'DVDTEST.partXX.rar'. Format error. Error #17540""

any ideas anyone? sucks to wait a few days for this and get errors :X"
,phongho3,2007-10-17T21:50Z,just kidding. haha i didnt need to unrar the other ones :) sorry. thanks!
,himtim,2007-10-18T14:47Z,"im trying to extract it with stuffit, but when the % bar is full it just stops and it wont finish the extraction, what im i doing wrong? :/"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-18T17:19Z,"try installing the latest version of stuffit,   11 should do it"
,doriansend,2007-10-18T22:04Z,"BytorrTorrent...just wanted to say I appreciate the up on this. I got all the apps to install, and I just have to upgrade my RAM for a couple of them. Any idea when you might post the content for these? Also, there's a SN workaround on TPB that I noticed you commented on...but it's an ""invalid torrent"". Did you have any luck with this workaround? Also was there any reason for 7 rars? It seemed that they were all the same. Thanx again.

To himtim, I have stuffit 12 and it seemed that after the bar hit 100% it still took another 10 min or so to be extracted, so be patient or install stuffit 12here....

This torrent worked well for me."
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-19T14:55Z,"Thanks dorlansend, about the rar files, I don´t know, that was the original file I downloaded "
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-19T14:58Z," from Dmnoid, and the SN torrent is very strange cause It works form me, anyway I will post that and the contents next week, cheers"
,LebaneseLarry,2007-10-19T23:27Z,Torrent and app works just fine. No problems installing. Took all of about five minutes. Really appreciate your effort Mr. BytorrTorrent. Just one small issue: Since there's no content for motion it's kinda useless. Is there a way to perhaps download another version of motion (one that contains the plugins) and then install them (the content files) in this version of motion? Anybody got any ideas?
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-20T13:48Z,"Ok, motion 3 + FCS2 SN workaround

,torkrist,2007-10-21T13:32Z,"Hei, I downloaded the torrent and I am trying to install but I dont know if I have enough disk space, I have 15 gig free but it says it needs about 55 gigs. Am I right it only needs 4-5 gigs to install or do I need 55 gigs free?"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-21T13:48Z,"It seems to be a problem with the torrent, let´s try this one
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3851075"
,BytorrTorrent,2007-10-21T13:50Z,"hey torkrist, this is only 4.something so you have space enough! the complete FCS2 is 55, check out the comments on this torrent"
,torkrist,2007-10-21T14:43Z,"When I try to install the ""continue"" button is just grey because I dont have enough space. Is there a workround to it?"
,doriansend,2007-10-22T17:48Z,"Torkrist,
You have to UNCHECK all the content below each applicable app. That means that you should only have checkmarks next to the actual applications (fcp/soundtrack/motion...etc). None of the content or ""extras"" should have checkmarks next to them...that is what takes up all the disk space. The apps alone are only abt 4 gig."
,DaveyCaz,2007-10-26T06:01Z,I have only the Final Cut bo checked off yet it still asks me to insert the Audiocontent disc. I can not skip over this and it causes me to close out the installation. Anybody know a way around this.
,buddyethan,2007-10-27T23:25Z,Does anyone know if upgrading to Leopard will deactivate these programs?
,masterbluestar,2007-10-28T03:49Z,"DaveyCaz, read the posting above yours. This installed totally fine on a 10.4.10 system, including FCP 6, Soundtrack Pro, DVD Studio PRO, etc. Many many thanks to ByTorrTorrent. You Da Man!"

I need help instaling FCS2 and I would also like if someone could tell me how to seed."

,zAAki,2007-12-03T22:48Z,"To all of you who can't unpack the files!

Here is what to do:

1. Go to www.unrarx.com and download UnRarX
2. Open DVDTEST.part01.rar with UnRarX
3. It'll fail saying that the password is wrong. To fix this, go up in the right corner where it says ""Password"". Type in: ""www.niuu.com"" (Without quotes) and hit okay.
4. Now click ""Extract"" and it'll begin exctracting.
5. There should now be a .dmg file in the folder, mount it, and install! ^

Thats it, you're done!

Enjoy."

,3ss0neR,2007-12-09T03:18Z,"Works great!!! ... When you install you HAVE to uncheck all the boxes and install only the basics (otherwise it'll ask you for the discs)... once you're done, restart your machine and follow the upgrade options it might ask you to enter a new pass#  E-349-SJF-218-MYH-275-IUP-431-RAX-ABC-X8XX  ... When the initial password expires (it took me 5 weeks) use this one and all should be sweet:  E-285-ULH-206-QJE-261-MIR-170-RUS-EYP-X90X  .. Once again, FS2 runs great ... not a prob ... Thanks ByTorr !!!"

,susanpart,2008-01-08T02:49Z,"by ""check and uncheck"", i mean that the portion where the content should be shown, it only shows the programs as such (final cut pro, compressor, etc etc).  and even then, the area is greyed over, so you cannot make any changes to it.   unless there is somewhere else where this ""content"" can be set to be gotten later (or never as the case may be), i would really like to know.

i tried running it but like some other posters on this, it asks for a disc- which we do not have- and then nothing...as we are by default forced to cancel the program's installation.

,Djreversal,2008-01-18T04:27Z,"**Greyed Out Install For FCP 6!!!  Read This**

If you install Final Cut Studio 2 after having installed Logic Studio, the option to install Final Cut Pro may be dimmed so that it is not possible to install Final Cut Pro. Other applications can be installed.

This particular issue specifically occurs on systems on which Logic Studio has already been installed.

Products Affected
Final Cut Studio 2, Logic Studio
Resolution
Take the following steps to resolve this issue:

If it is still running, quit the Final Cut Studio Installer.
In Finder, navigate to /Library/Receipts/.
Locate the file named ProMediaIO.pkg and drag it to the Trash.
Run the Final Cut Studio Installer again."

Then I dragged the DVDTEST.part01.rar into unrarX's window, and it began unraring it. Keep waiting, and when you are done, a .dmg file will appear. Now if you have toast, you can burn this or mount it. If you regularly mount it, i believe your mac will know it's not a dvd and inform you of this, and you wont be able to install it, so use toast. (i'm using toast 8 titanium). Then enter this serial key E-285-ULH-206-QJE-261-MIR-170-RUS-EYP-X90X when you are installing, and you should be good to go.

As for it asking for your serial number over an over again, use spotlight to find the folder ""proapps"" in your library. Move or rename the file ""Final Cut Studio System ID"" (I renamed with BKUP in the start) just for safety's sake. When next you start, it'll ask your serial. Enter your info and then it should stick.

I used UnrarX to unrar all the files. It takes a while to unrar, but then you just open the FC2 dmg and you have to uncheck all the content. If you do it right it wont ask for the extra cd's."

'I used UnrarX to unrar all the files. It takes a while to unrar, but then you just open the FC2 dmg and you have to uncheck all the content. If you do it right it wont ask for the extra cd's'

This works fine: unzip the file using unrarx, which will unzip all the rar files (unlike stuffit).

Once this is done, load the dmg.  When asked to customize the install, uncheck only the boxes which include 'content' for the software (i.e. 'Motion Content'/'Audio Content for Soundtrack Pro'/'DVD Studio Pro Content').  The installer will then proceed up to a point where it will ask you to insert disc 1, at this point, cancel the install.

Final cut will still be installed in your applications folder and will open.  I have only just done this and am presently capturing footage to see if it works properly, but it seems ok thus far...

Hope this helps, i had a bit of a hard time trying to understand all the instructions given so i thought that people might benefit if i spelt it all out nice and clear.

I hope you will follow up on this and let us know this sans-contents version's capabilities. I'm especially interested in knowing if the ""Color"" feature works.

And thanks (along with decoydevo) for clarifying the installation process. That's going to help a lot of people out."

No files to extract

I was getting the same error and it was unpacking up till part07.rar then stopping and then I'd have to start again from the beginning! Boring
in unrarX go to preferences and check these boxes (eg tick them)
 ""par to rar""
""keep broken extracted files""
""recurse subdirectories""

I am unsure how this fixed my problem but it did, good luck BoingNZ"

If you are having the problem where FCP asks you for a serial upon every start up, you are looking in the wrong place for the ""Final Cut Studio ID"" file.

The file is under Macintosh Drive>library>application support, NOT username>library>application support :).

Simply overwrite the existing file with the one you can download from the last page of comments and it works beautifully.

Hi guys! 
I just registered only to help you resolve ZIP/RAR extraction problems. I saw that a lot of you have similar problems to mine regarding archive extraction. I used TRANSMISSION on my MAC to download the torrent. Everything seemed OK until I tried to extract the archive. There were a lot of problems. Error codes as ""unexpected end of archive"", ""CRC failed"" ""bad compression"", ""unknown compression type"", ""file missing"" etc...
 I tried all the programs ZIPEG, UNRARX, BOMA archive utility, STUFFIT 11, 12, 13....none worked.
Copied the file to a PC and tried with winZIP and winRAR and still no success. And then I suddenly got an idea. I copied the torrent file and dropped it into uTorrent (PC). As I expected uTorrent scanned the file for consistency and voila!!! less than one percent was missing in my final file. The rest downloaded in a minute and the final archive is working OK!!!!! Even if Transmission showed that the file is 100% downloaded it obviously wasn't.  
I hope this will help to those who have similar problems!"
,oacory,2009-01-16T05:06Z,"I hope you guys can help.

,rocky1946,2009-01-18T23:13Z,"Listen guys, this download has ALL the apps. When you get the DMG file unRARed you mount the DMG should see an APP inside the DMG that is titled ""Installing Your Software.app"" which if you read it will tell you that the discs the installer is asking for are the CONTENT parts of the Studio suite which ARE NOT part of this download. The CONTENT contains template, fonts, sound loops, etc. that are nice to have but ALL the apps will run without them. You can select to NOT install the CONTENT by turning down the little triangles on the installer screen and unchecking the CONTENT, not the APPS (you may have to make the window wider so you can read the full description of what is CONTENT and what is an APP - FYI the APP is always the first box below the down-turned triangle and the CONTENT is/are all the box/es below that). There is not CONTENT for COLOR or CINEMA TOOLS. When you uncheck the CONTENT boxes the main box next to the triangle will now have a dash meaning not all parts for that part of the Studio will be installed (Hint: not the CONTENT). Hope this helps some of you."

Just the audio content is three downloads of about 7+GBs each!. So, yes, go find the entire Studio, but be prepared to spend a long time downloading! Then as each disc is asked for by the installer you need to mount that particular DMG, i.e. Audio Content 1.dmg, Audio Content 2.dmg, Audio Content 3.dmg, Live Type Media 1.dmg, Live Type 2.dmg, DVD Studio Pro Content.dmg, Motion Content.dmg, Final Cut Pro Tutorials.dmg!"

,3ss0neR,2009-03-16T16:39Z,"Hey guys, I've install this program on 2 of my Mac's and I haven't had a problem yet (except for the Academic Serials).  Now i'm on my 3rd machine (G5) and for some reason I cant open the sequence I worked on with my Imac or my MacBook ... Could it be that my other two are using academic serials? It also doesn't ask me for an upgrade serial # when I try to upgrde the suite.  Any ideas?  Thanks."
,RonBottomdrips,2009-03-18T01:19Z,"Help?
The serial (E-339-UWQ-474-OMS-131-OMJ-111-RKV-1CX-X93X) for the 6.05 update does not work for me. 
 I go to the final cut update site and it tells me ""You appear to have already downloaded the Final Cut Studio update.""
could that serial have run out?"
,lui4u,2009-03-23T21:39Z,"Ahoy! It took some time, but YES! THIS WORKS!&FCP after update reads AVCHD files! THX 4 SHARING!!!

READ 4 combined INSTRUCTIONS (that's how it worked on my Intel MacBookPro):

1. download the torrent
2. download unrarx from http://www.unrarx.com/
3. drag the first RAR file (DVDtest part01.rar) into unrarx.
4. press the 'password' button and put WWW.NIUU.COM in the field.
5.Press extract.(unrarx will now extract ALL rar files on its own. be patient for the extraction to complete.
6. You now have a DMG file. Open it and follow the installation steps.
7. Make sure you have a working Serial - E-349-MVN-218-MYH-263-VKF-431-RAX-ABC-X8XX
8. When you install Final Cut, uncheck everything you can BUT Final Cut. Install. Restart.
Install the rest of the suite.
9. I didn't have this problem but if the programme ask's for the serial each time you open follow dsyfunktional instructions from page 15, which are:

Download:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3705911/Final_Cut_Studio_2_Serial_Number_License_Dialog_workaround

Replace ""Final Cut Studio System ID"" in ""/Library/Application Support/ProApps/"" with the one you just downloaded.

Restart.

(It's always a good idea to make a copy of the file you are replacing, just in case :)

10.Go to Apple>Software Update and update everything that has ""Pro"" in front of it. (ex. Pro Kit, Pro Applications, etc)
Restart.

Now Put In The Update Serial - 6.0.5 Update Serial E-339-UWQ-474-OMS-131-OMJ-111-RKV-1CX-X93X  And OFF YOU GO! 

* Be aware that this is only the programe, without the content but THIS WILL WORK ANYHOW - see rocky1946 comment from page 17: Listen guys, this download has ALL the apps. When you get the DMG file unRARed you mount the DMG should see an APP inside the DMG that is titled ""Installing Your Software.app"" which if you read it will tell you that the discs the installer is asking for are the CONTENT parts of the Studio suite which ARE NOT part of this download. The CONTENT contains template, fonts, sound loops, etc. that are nice to have but ALL the apps will run without them. You can select to NOT install the CONTENT by turning down the little triangles on the installer screen and unchecking the CONTENT, not the APPS (you may have to make the window wider so you can read the full description of what is CONTENT and what is an APP - FYI the APP is always the first box below the down-turned triangle and the CONTENT is/are all the box/es below that). There is not CONTENT for COLOR or CINEMA TOOLS. When you uncheck the CONTENT boxes the main box next to the triangle will now have a dash meaning not all parts for that part of the Studio will be installed (Hint: not the CONTENT). Hope this helps some of you. 
**if you have a macbook white, just install DVD studio pro and FCP, the rest will only work properly when you have a better graphics chip of maxed RAM.

Enjoy!!!
[I followed the instructions from BytorrTorrent, dsyfunktional, mimgolf & rocky1946 - THX GUYS!!!"

but where can i get the contents for the applications?
would the programs have less functions without the contents?

and also if my friend have the really copy from apple, can i use his content dvds to install onto the pirate bay version applications?

please help me! thank you so much! Xx Xxxx"
,3ss0neR,2009-08-16T00:35Z,"To anyone having issues with the install, make sure you have the latest of UNRARX, make sure you have the UNRARX and not the UNRAR program (mr_cytus it seems like you have the wrong extraction software), run it with password www.niuu.com, highlight all your .rar files, right click (or drag to) and open with UnRarX, it will most probably re-ask you to enter the passwoord so click ok, click on password and re-enter www.niuu.com, just copy/paste it from the torrent info page so there's no spaces or mistakes, then run the installer and follow ALL the directions from BytorrTorrent.  
If it says there's no files to extract, that means it's most probably already extracted so find your .DMG file for FCS2, double click on it and then follow ALL the directions from BytorrTorrent.
Once the install is done, restart your machine and do a software update which will install everything you need based on the password you've entered.
If you have access to the full version on DVD then stop trying to DL and extracting and everything, the full version is on the DVDs.
Please bear in mind that you are DLing cracked software so it's really not recommended to 'register your product with apple' nor is it a good plan to go on the apple website and try to upgrade your cracked software ... unless you want Steve Jobb's goons to come and knock on your door!
And, finally, I've DLed and installed this torrent on my 3 machines (iMac white, MacBook Pro and black MacBook) as well as on my black iMac at the office and I've never had a problem, using Tiger and Leopard. And, by the way, learning is fun, read ALL the post starting with the first one on page one and you'll find all these answers, serials and more without freaking out.
Enjoy, thanks BytorrTorrent."
