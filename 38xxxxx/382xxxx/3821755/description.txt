1. Mount 01 - World_of_warcraft.iso
2. If it does not auto play, go to My Computer, where you should see it in your virtual DVD drive
3. Install just as you would with the CDs.  NOTE: This is all 4 CD's in one file, so you don't have to change disks. It won't ask you to change disks, so you don't have to worry about it.
