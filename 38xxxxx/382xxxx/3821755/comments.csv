,theaceman112,2007-09-27T23:46Z,Thanks hopefully it works!
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-09-28T02:03Z,"It should work.  One thing I forgot to mention in the read me.  Don't install the 2.2.0 patch if you want to play on a free server because it won't work.  

To avoid the 2.2.0 patch from trying to auto install when you launch wow, be sure to launch using WoW.exe, NOT launcher.exe"
,Humpie,2007-09-28T18:11Z,Free servers are freakin terrible. 
,planetaids,2007-10-01T00:00Z,this was downloading fast till 2 of the seeders left now going at 0.1-10 kpbs :[
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-01T16:19Z,Sorry....My PC shut off last night while I was sleeping.  It's back up and seeding now. :)
,monbrev,2007-10-02T14:24Z,"I can't run the patches 

were did I go wrong???"
,monbrev,2007-10-02T14:26Z,"this uptdate requiers wow.exe version 2.1.0.6692 u have an older version, 2.0.0.6080
?????? "
,monbrev,2007-10-02T14:27Z,sorry i did try do copy the error message. but it did say something about that i didn't have the lastest version
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-02T16:04Z,"Did you install TBC before trying to install the patches?

If you did, and they still won't install, you could use launcher.exe to auto download the patches, or get the patches here: http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=21079"
,monbrev,2007-10-02T16:14Z,"hmm, i wonder... i dont have a key.. and then i cant create an account... or??"
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-02T17:28Z,"I believe the loader will download and install the patches, but I could be wrong about that.  If so, just go to the link I posted above and download the patches from there. 

You won't be able to play on blizzard's servers without a key, but you can play on the free servers. "
,monbrev,2007-10-02T17:38Z,"yes, the patches did download just fine.. 

anyone have a key?"
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-02T18:02Z,"Well...you can buy the CD keys online, but you might want to be careful with that.  Some of those places will sell you used keys, and you'll be screwed.

Your best bet if you want to play on the official servers, is just to buy the game.  You'll be paying the $15/mo to play the game anyway, so might as well buy the software as well...

If you want to play for free, you should really check out the free servers, they're a lot of fun.  And if you don't like them, you can always go with option one. ;)"
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-02T19:45Z,"Ok...I screwed up and missed two patches.  I'm sorry for that.

I made a new torrent with just the patches for you guys.
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3827467/World_of_Warcraft_Patches_from_2.0.0_to_2.1.3

The missing ones are 

01 - WoW-2.1.0.6692-enUS-patch.exe
04 -WoW-2.1.1.6739-to-2.1.2.6803-enUS-patch.exe

So those are the only two you need to download if you've already downloaded this torrent."
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-02T21:03Z,"You have to run from WoW.exe.  Even if you uncheck the ""Show Launcher"" option on the login screen, it's still launching the program from Launcher.exe which is what tells it to pull updates.

You need to go to your shortcut properties and change the target from ""C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Launcher.exe"" to ""C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\WoW.exe""

Then it will not auto update."
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-02T22:25Z,Status shows in uTorrent as seeding.
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-02T22:39Z,"I don't know why it isn't uploading.  The status is 'seeding' in my client, and I show 2 peers, but it's not uploading. 

Try this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3827637/World_of_Warcraft_Patches_from_2.0.0_to_2.1.3

I deleted the old torrent and made a new one...just in case there was something wrong with the first one."
,SAW_bloodlust,2007-10-02T22:56Z,"That's weird.  I'm showing two people connected now, and it's uploading at around 30KB/s"
,mochamage,2007-10-03T01:10Z,"The download of the two missing patches is taking forever... so here's links to them:

,guyguyson,2007-10-20T23:42Z,bloodmyst is the normal one that is really close to the real blizzard servers and i think netherstorm is a fun sever with something like 15 times the EXP and gold from monsters/quests... i think... and there are quite a few bugs on the severs so you might want to report those to the gms
