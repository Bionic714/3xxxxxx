,babspace,2007-10-01T17:08Z,"Have no fear, the seeder is here. While I try to be available 24-7, I unfortunately have to shut down for an hour or two during the day. Until we get more seeders the best time to download is between 9pm and 6am EDT/EST, when (barring an outage) the file is available uninterrupted."
,chayant.g,2008-01-05T12:39Z,"i just want to say that though i may not know you babspace, i'm your biggest fan for uploading this torrent! as far as i can see, it's the only such torrent of its kind and, though the video quality is seriously bad at times, i still think you've done a great job. i mean, it's these are obviously the only ones you could have got and i really respect you for making it possible for people like me to have them! thanks a ton! :)"
,chayant.g,2008-01-05T15:32Z,"oh by the way, my last comment left out my only request - that some people please seed :) thanks"
,babspace,2008-02-16T07:25Z,"My apologies for not being available for seeding for the past two months. My computer was in the shop and the techs couldn't possibly believe a female was telling them it was the power supply. :P

Thanks for the kudos chayant.g! I'm glad to see I'm able to provide something that others can enjoy."
