Try burning it at 4x speed.  Show a little patience, and it will pay off ! ! !

,denzilsbelly,2007-09-26T19:37Z,"Thank you for this. I have one question, were any nuns harmed in the making of this torrent?"
,spikeburton,2007-09-26T19:56Z,"I can assure you, kind sir, that this DVD has been thoroughly tested, and been given the Unconditional Endorsement of the Seeding The Nuns Team.

If the nuns who had taught me in grade school had LastXP, I believe they would have been much less miserable, and not smacked my knuckles with a ruler so often that it turned me into a pervert.


All kidding aside, I've been running a previous version of LastXP on my home computers for the past 6 months or so, with not a single glitch.  And all of the applications run 10 times faster than they did when I was running that ""other"" WindowsXP !

This thing RULES!"
,vannelle,2007-09-26T20:11Z,"Hello,

,gilmargdsj,2007-09-27T04:04Z,"People, can someone say why Windows XP turned into 3.8Gb (what have on this DVD) ?
Thank's"
,xroblade,2007-09-27T13:30Z,"Just wondering if there is an option to install the drivers without installing LastXP. oh by the way LastXP is by far the most powerful and user frendly windows ever, no glitches. This is a very exciting DVD. Just wish more people knew about it cause its definaty up there."
,xroblade,2007-09-27T13:32Z,By the way thanks AppzPoint for a true quality download.
,xroblade,2007-09-27T13:46Z,LastXP has windows and all the programs you need thats why its 3.8 gigs. Expression web needs to be on the dvd.
,vannelle,2007-09-27T16:40Z,"thank you wilyz.....that ment a lot to me! 

LOL"
,xroblade,2007-09-27T22:28Z,"I had to google to get to this torrent, the search isn't working"
,spikeburton,2007-09-28T01:16Z,"Yeah, xroblade.  People are discussing it in the forums.  The search isn't working for torrents uploaded on specific dates.


As far as your question about the drivers, here's the answer - direct from TeamXP:

""The drivers supplied with LastXP are integrated with the driver CAB files of the installer, so no you can't have the drivers without installing LastXP. Once LastXP (and drivers) are installed and if you ticked the 'keep drivers' box then the driver CAB is left on the computer, on call for such times a new hardware item is added.

If you are cleaver enough you can dissect the drivers and extract the driver for a specific hardware item but identifying it is difficult as they are not named with their 'proper' name. Its easier just to Google and download the required driver."""
,xroblade,2007-09-30T01:33Z,Thanks Spike for the fast upload.
,xroblade,2007-10-02T21:32Z,"Yeh the search is working good now (lastxp) and your's is the only one there, cool."
,vicplisk,2007-10-19T01:30Z,"Is there any wiki page or something similar for this? 
And is it only English?"
,vanTorX,2007-11-19T05:08Z,"why does LXP17 only have Office 2003 while this one has 2007 and also it is separate install all on its own... 

I installed LXP17 and put in DVD with LXP1623 and installed the office and it works fine, only bummer is the kangaroo stamp on it, I mean it defaults to Australian English and you can't change it in options, it looks like you changed default lang but it will come with kangaroo thing next time no matter what you do, thx but no thx, why did the whoever made it ready had to spoil it in this stupid way

vanTorX"
,xroblade,2007-11-20T06:31Z,"vanTorX, the reason i think office on v17 is 2003 is because no one got used to using the 2007 style layout. The 2003 version on v17 is upto-date and eazy to use. As for the default language :P Sorry ""Mate"" i dont know why they used ozzy."
,vanTorX,2007-11-20T07:00Z,"thx, I can't go to appzpoint, tried to log in and forgot pass or what and now it says I am banned, whatever

I was gonna install office2007 for these folks who want the latest shout even if they can't orient themselves in it LOL plus they would mind default lang choice I think and would ask about it and its kinda embarassing if I cannot change it

I also have portable Office2007 which to my uneducated understanding it works just as the real installed office, however I suspect it is not the same else why would these guys include installed versions, what's up with portable?"
,spikeburton,2007-11-21T13:41Z,"@ vanTorX:

Portable means that you can run the program directly from a USB memory stick, for instance, without actually installing it!

So, you can carry it around and use it anywhere, hence . . . portable.

If you have good copies of Office 2007, why don't you upload them here?


@ anyone who is having trouble logging in at Appzpoint:

They moved to different board software, and the member passwords were not able to be migrated.  You have to clear your cookies and go there.  Then you will see a link to reset your password.  Follow the directions, and you should be back in and catching up on the LastXP news!

,vanTorX,2007-12-02T20:42Z,"I posted about the Office on LXP17Final 

the office from that version of LXP is working as it should, apparently some change was made for this Final edition

what I meant when I asked about portable vs full install was why would anyone install office at all given you got the portable one working just fine, after all the installation takes a godly amount of time and probably writes a lot to registry and all that and likely takes more place on disk (not sure on that one) and its not portable LOL so why would anyone use installed versions of progams which is available as portable, that's what I don't understand, I suspect the portable programs can't deliver in some areas same as installed versions can, else why would everybody out there not be making only portable apps to begin with which would be great if pple didn't have to install anything on their windows

another thing I don't quite get is why are people still downloading even LXP15 never mind 16 etc, I could see that some older versions are considered good but I only read that about LXP13 which someobody said was the last lean and mean edition made still in old spirit of LXP edition

I keep these older editions available for upload but don't quite get why they still draw even new downloaders (I can see somebody on dial up starting to get v15 and it is all he can get and he is glad to get it at all never mind v17 is out by the time he gets the v15 but that has to be extreme minority I should think)"
,swamy,2008-01-09T05:58Z,"People prefer some of the older versions simply because each version has its own particular set of features and a distinct style. There is no difference between the base windows installation in v16 and v17. The subtle differences are in the styles, features, and the list of included apps. 

One example of a change that has occurred over time is the inclusion of portable apps. They do not have the full set of features that you would find in a larger installed app, but for some users it is convenient to be able to bring their work from one machine to the next. Another example is of course offering different versions of office. You may like 2007 and someone else may like 2003. It is all about choices. Of course LastXP comes with all of the builder tools needed for you to customize the list of apps to match your exact preferences and burn your own personalized DVD.  "
