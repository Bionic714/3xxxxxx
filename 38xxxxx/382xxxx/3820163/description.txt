LastXP DVD Edition v16.2.3


For those of you who haven't heard of it, LastXP is the sweetest, most stable version of Windows XP on the planet - and the DVD version is packed with apps that you totally need!

A list of the included applications is in the text file included in this upload.


LastXP is a project of ReturnOfNights, and the LastXP Team at AppzPoint.net.  

This DVD contains the original LastXP version 16, with all updates as of Sept. 25, 2007 applied, and recompiled into a new DVD/ISO by Wise Fool.

I've extracted the ISO from Wise Fool's original ".rar" files, burned a DVD with Nero 6, and tested it.  It booted right up for me.

Just pick "Burn an image", and only burn the file called:  LastXPDVD_16.2.3.iso  (not the whole folder!)

It works for Spikey - so it should work for you ! ! !
