,FUCK_OFF_WEASEL,2008-01-23T22:53Z,"If you think you can burn this torrent into a DVD and pop this game into your UNMODIFIED PS2, you are going to burn a lot of worthless coasters. You need to have a modded PS2, or use a swap-disc method like Gameshark, Independence Exploit etc. Gameshark is the easiest way to play burned games, a mod chip is the best way if you are going to store games on a hard drive, installed in a PS2. Here's my setup:
PS2 (fat) Version 9, Crystal Chips 2.0 SLE, Maxtor 320 GB hard drive, PS2 network adapter, and LaunchELF (an application)
Google all that stuff and you can learn about it.
Gameshark is the best way to go, since you don't have to deal with installing a mod chip (and potentially destroying your system). Don't bother getting a no-solder mod chip, they work 1 out of 10 times.  And for god's sake, don't go around telling everyone that you play burned games on a modded system (including Gameshark), you may end up having your system confiscated, including your computer since that is what you probably used to download the games. Keep your activities to yourself and only your closest friends."
,EvilFaerie101,2008-02-27T01:46Z,"since this isn't iso format, do i just have to take all the files and burn them as an image or iso format?"
,farmaceutico69,2008-02-29T05:13Z,ntsc or pal??
,xohshitztonysbackx,2008-05-18T06:09Z,"ntsc 
Pal is Dancing Stage Supernova 2.

Find a iso in the zip, then unzip the iso and the rest of the file should turn into ISO IMAGE."
