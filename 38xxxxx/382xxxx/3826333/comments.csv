,Ice1,2007-10-01T21:51Z,"""No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.""-Why post it then?? "
,Rengis,2007-10-01T22:01Z,"Till alla er som absolut inte fattar något:
Det går inte att få någon anslutning till trackern (TPB) så därför kan man inte varken seeda eller leecha."
[V],He0n,2007-10-01T22:09Z,"This gone be wait to tracker wakes up again  ;)

,Timmio,2007-10-04T23:12Z,"why make the realese custom made? at least make it sweden, danish, norwegian, finish subs ! 
that will be perfect for all of uss.
If not we can just download divx versions. not so good as a full dvd if you ask me. "
,raidmax,2007-10-05T20:38Z,"why does it say: downloaded 0 times????
Anyone got the whole thing, or is this a FAKE?"
,travz,2007-10-06T05:47Z,can someone please tell me how to put this torrent together. im new at this. i'v downloaded all the files already but i dont know how to put it together. someone please help!!
,alezander,2007-10-06T06:52Z,k so im sorta new with the dvdr thing.. ive bought some dvd-r and im trying to watch this as a dvd but i cant for some reason. could someone possibly tell me the steps?
,alexander_pehrsson,2007-10-06T13:54Z,"Fantastik quality and sound downlode it, you will love it!"
,skinnadoor,2007-10-06T17:02Z,Is this the WIDESCREEN version?
,alezander,2007-10-06T18:05Z,ok so ive already asked but im sorta impatient. what do i do with all the files?
,skinnadoor,2007-10-06T19:35Z,"Ok is it a compressed file???   .rar ???  or .zip ????  first thing you need to do, is extract the DVD into a folder bro.   Once it's in to the folder, you can see what you have to work with.

If you end up with the transformers movie folder after your extraction, go into the folder,  you should have 2 folders that say,  Video TS and  Audio.     When you get to this point,  your gonna want to use NERO and select Burn image to disc....    and your GOING to select,  DVD VIDEO FILES....   then a window comes up ""same way it would if you were making a music cd ""  and you drag your new folder with your extracted movie into the nero window,  then you hit next and she starts copying to the DVD.  

Extracting the movie is the biggest thing.  if you got a whole bunch of small .rar files,  just pick one, and extract it to a new folder.  Even though you just clicked on any of them, the Whole movie will extract.  

Good luck."
,skinnadoor,2007-10-06T19:37Z,"Its also a good idea to have Winrar installed.


You can get it here, it's free, and a must have, anyone will tell ya that.

[T],FatFreddy475,2007-10-06T20:06Z,"Oh, can't someone seed this, I only get about 4 seeders. Please."
,skinnadoor,2007-10-07T15:35Z,"Ok,  this is definetly a clean DVD copy, of the origional dvd....that's obvious.... looks fantastic.  I was just wondering about the 5.1,  is it full Bitrate?? or shrunken down???  Buddy said it was @320 Kb/sec rate...... how do i check for myself?

Excellent upload.... it's nice to get such a good quality rip without the bullshit.   Thanks for uploading.....   
"
,skinnadoor,2007-10-07T15:44Z,"Nevermind, the 320kbs was the soundtrack, the 5.1 audio is streaming at almost full rate...   Excellent friggin copy boys !!!!!!!!

This torrent is more then meets the eye !!!!!!  It's freeken Sweet"
,Pirate like is-cream,2007-10-07T15:58Z," plz seed!
Hei
kan dere seed`e litt mer altså ikke slette torenten når dere har ferdig lastet!"
,darknessv,2007-10-08T10:53Z,"men jaha..varför funkar det inte att bränna ut... 
massa felmeddelanden i nero :/"
,DJ_SEVEN,2007-10-08T22:00Z,"Talk abaout KINDERGARDEN!

You don't have the right to demand a fuckin thing, like subs, quality or seed!

As long as u don't pay for the material, shut the fuck up and be nice :)

Some time in the future, all this will be closed to the public, like back in the days, when there where lots of different scenes, but just for the very select few.

Mind you tounge everyone and remeber to be thankful for what you get, as there are powers in our midst that want to close us down forever!

,thesoftparade,2007-10-09T00:10Z,Thanks a lot! I'll seed it really good.

,DirtyWackFunk,2007-10-09T16:28Z,"Is it me, or can you not turn off the subtitles?  If that is the case, seems pretty lame.  Great quality though."
,frato,2007-10-11T13:44Z,"Cant Unrar the files, (You need to start extracion from a previos volume to unpack superQ-trans.img) I dont understand the message. Can someone help me?"
,Mouchi,2007-10-13T21:53Z,"Det är ju i alla fall bra att det är folk som seedar -host-

Snälla, är det verkligen så svårt att ha kvar
filmen när man har laddat ner den, om bilden och ljudet
verkligen är bra?!?!?!?
Skitsamma om Ni själva gillar filmen eller inte,
var lite bussiga och låt andra få en chans att ladda ner.
Fastnar alltid på någon jädrans procent i flera dagar och sen ger man upp istället."
,shorttimer,2007-10-14T01:38Z,"Got the file but R03 got corrupted.

Thanks."

,cleotronicavain,2007-10-16T10:57Z,"I know this isnt the first time anybody has asked for an explanation, but you dont learn unless you ask. How do I burn this .img file on a dvd? I tried burning it directly to dvd with nero but it wont play on my dvd player. Is there something I should do with the file before I can burn it into a playable dvd?"
,hoho007,2007-10-17T00:53Z,super quality!! thx :)
,rebecka_o,2007-10-17T02:15Z,"cleotronicavain -
