,tassiegeoff,2007-10-04T07:13Z,"Sorry about losing the seeding... am new here. Hopefully is seeding now.

The early albums I am looking for at moment are:
1974 Mo' Roots
1975 Music Keeps Me Together
1976 Satisfied n' Tickled Too
1976 Anthology, Volume One
1977 Evolution (The Most Recent)
1977 Brothers soundtrack

I have about 700 of his tracks so if anyone is looking for an album or his songs from compilations let me know and I will seed them if I have them.

I used to have them all on the original vinyls and the latest on Cd's until ex-wife burned them in spite. So am hoping to get them back through here now. "
