,Austypausty,2009-07-30T14:05Z,"Great game, Thanks. Only one problem though, in later levels, one of the objects you have to fins in some of the rooms comes up as unidentified and if you get a hint it says all th objects have been found. If you leave the room and come back, the name changes to an object you've already found. The only way I can get around it is to run the timer down and then do the level again. Anyone else have this problem?"
