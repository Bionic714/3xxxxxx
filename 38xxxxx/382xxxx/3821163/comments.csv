[V],Kuthumi,2007-10-02T09:21Z,Thank you. This is not a widescreen edition.
,jimmiebean,2007-10-05T15:47Z,"Please continue to seed this when you are finished.  I have been seeding for a while now and no one seems to be doing the same leaving me as the only seeder.  
If no one follows the ""rules"" of using torrents, all of them will die eventually.
Thank you"
