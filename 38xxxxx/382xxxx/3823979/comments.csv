Very nice collection of soul gems...
This is real soul/r&b, unlike that crap that Witney and her ilk are belching out...
Thanks for this one!

,Hilding6125,2007-09-30T10:57Z,"Sorry guys, I made a mistake. It's over 500 songs in this collection. Somehow the soings in WMA did not make onto the list. Well it will be a surprice for you what songs.

I totally agree with that this is the real thing. No f***ing R&B crap. :)"
