,drteeth,2007-09-29T10:40Z,This is sci-fi at it's best. FFS it's SG Atlantis with RODNEY. I'd watch it in black and white with the audio scewed with a massive delay.
,death734,2007-09-29T10:48Z,"millenuim, what does a 20mbit line have to do with anything for watching HD content. also 16mbit beats 3-6mbit down like the avg american has any day. not to mention the puny 256-512kbps upload
also this doesn't air in hd for a few days. i heard oct 1st in canada"
,millennium5,2007-09-29T11:00Z,"Ppl. don't misunderstand me here, I am very greatful to the uploader, I know the US network is inferior to ours here in scandanavia and we are thankful everythime some of you guys uploads a 720p or even 1080p version cause we really can't watch the low res stuff on our high tech tv's anymore, its like watching shit in B/W without sound."
,millennium5,2007-09-29T11:22Z,"But there are still a few nice shows in the usa and all the good work you guys do to stop terror, we love you :)"
