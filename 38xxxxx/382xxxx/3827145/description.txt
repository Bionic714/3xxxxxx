Alan Ladd stars as Choya, an outsider who snakes his way into an affluent Texas family by pretending he's the son they never knew. Surprised by how he's welcomed with open arms, he begins to question his charade, especially when he begins to develop feelings for his "sister" (Mona Freeman). The only way he knows to rectify his deceit is to find the family's real son, a mission that leads him to discover his own true self as well.
