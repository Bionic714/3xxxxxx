TASER International promotion and training video.  

Brought to you by the sick f**kers at TASER, this DVD takes you into their corporate labs as they explain the importance of their new less lethal technology.  Not on the video are the many documented cases of untimely death, police abuse, and torture.  What is on the video is a collection of powerpoints and .wmvs of people getting tased.  My favorite:  The video of the explosion caused by the mixture of pepper spray and tasing.
