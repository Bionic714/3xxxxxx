DUB SESSION 35 - WELCOME TO DUBROCK! VOL 1

Welcome to Dubrock! This first DubRock version begins with a Hendrix / Zeppelin / Truby Trio - Boozoo blend. Then we dub the remix with the Spacemonkeys, Gotan Project, and the Thievery Corporation. Next we take a trip to the moon with a remix of the Police's Walking on The Moon and an Easy All Stars reggae version of Breathe from the Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon. We get a triple set rocker from John Brown's Body, The Samples covering John Lennon's "Watching the Wheels," and Boozoo Bajou featuring Joe Dukie. Then we bring in Common and the Marley brothers Damian, Steven and Ziggy to close the show and lay down some lovers rock vibes for the ladies. Special thanks to Marie Juana from Buenos Iries for the voice-overs!
