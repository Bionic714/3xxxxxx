  Release Notes:


    An ancient spirit has detected a mysterious dark power
       awakening in the peaceful world of Dazzleon. The balance
       between good and evil is threatened and the fate of Dazzleon
       rests in the hands of one young spirit. Entrusted with a
       mission of dire importance, you play the role of this spirit
       as it takes the form of a young girl named Luna. However,
       restoring peace to Dazzleon is not such a simple task as
       thwarting evil requires you to complete various quests and
       challenges, train your own pet, and command your pet in battle
       against rogue monsters unleashed by Luna's wicked uncle, Matt.

         truth behind the mysteries of Dazzleon!

         outfits.
