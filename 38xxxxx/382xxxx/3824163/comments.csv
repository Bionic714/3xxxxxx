,cldrjones,2007-09-30T08:43Z,"Calling for seeds after a few hours? Come on dude, I've got a slow line and I'm super-seeding (let's see you uploading something first). A little patience won't kill you.

Do you even know what this movie is about? "
,Shadfly,2007-09-30T18:38Z,"This is an old movie from the 70s about the life of a seagull. Yep, that's right. 
The fame of this movie is the soundtrack, 
by Neal Diamond. I hope this info can help. "
