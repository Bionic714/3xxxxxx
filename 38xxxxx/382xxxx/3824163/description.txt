I've been looking for Jonathan Livingston Seagull for a long time, and there was nowhere where I could buy the DVD or even the VHS, not online or in the real world.
Finally I managed to track down an original VHS tape with this 1973 movie, and I decided to rip it. As this is a VHS-rip from an old tape, the quality is rather low, but hey, it's better than nothing...

Feel free to post comments, and above all, enjoy the movie!
