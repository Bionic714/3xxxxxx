NOTE: This is a very big upload, so i would apreciate for some seeding after the download. I will seed this torrent and monotorize it all days, if after my upload MB counting is = to folder size and there is no seeder there will be no more HSDK torrents from me. 

This is a fansub release. and since it was the first anime i was on since the very first, ther are some episodes from one group and others from another. Don't mind that, it's all english and both are pretty good.

Moving foreward.
"Shirahama Kenichi is awalys bullied by the classmates. One day, he sets out his mind to become strong, following an advice of a beautiful girl, Furinji Miu, he goes to a martial arts school. However, it was a tremendously hard school where the strongest martial arts masters teach their flawless techniques to Kenichi." [taken from: www.animenfo.com, added a few words from me]

I'm telling you... PLEASE SEED :)
