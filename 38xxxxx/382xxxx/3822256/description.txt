Rayman Raving Rabbids


In Raymans world, there once lived sweet little cute rabbits that were constantly victimised by more ferocious animals. One day, they disappeared from the Earths surface, secretly planning their massive invasion. Armed with enormous war machines, they have now returned to enslave Raymans world and get their final revenge!

These poor little creatures have become deceitful, uncontrollable and completely psychotic. Our hero and his friends have been kidnapped by these diabolical rodents and have become their slaves. Like a gladiator, Rayman must endure a series of trials for their amusement. But will he manage to gain enough popularity to save his world and his friends from this veritable Invasion of the Rabbids?


Did the original crash? Can't find a fix? Hate the annoying ads in the free version?
Then try this one,.. it's the free version (from FilePlanet) but without the ads. :D 
Works in XP, Vista & Windows 7!

Ripped: The ads :)
Extras: High Quality Icons (256x256 PNG Compressed), Aim & MSN kits, Screensavers, Sounds & Wallpapers


Install: Unpack (compressed with 7-Zip - www.7-zip.org - free) to any location & run RegSetup.exe
RegSetup adds the needed info to the registry and creates shortcuts on the Desktop & in the Start Menu (All Programs\Games\Rayman Raving Rabbids).

Uninstall: Run RemoveReg & delete the game directory.
RemoveReg removes all the added info from the registry & deletes the shortcuts.
