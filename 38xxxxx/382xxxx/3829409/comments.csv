Nope - you are not alone. This torrent is ported from a site where you have no rating. 

Lets hope ""alderbaran"" knows how to upload this flic so you, me and all the others who´s access are denied on this, can share planet terror.... "

,Willemannen,2007-10-11T22:45Z,"First of all; Thanx for this upload He0n !!
But I have a question; Does anyone else have problems watching the film ?
I can't jump between the chapters because then the film freezes and the time counter shows very strange values.....
I tried to re-encode the film but all progs I've tested with say that the navigation structure is wrong, one VOB-file address is out of its boundries, whatever that means.
Does anyone have any clue what to do ?"
