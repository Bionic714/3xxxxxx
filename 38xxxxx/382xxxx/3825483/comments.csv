,Flokker,2007-12-13T10:26Z,"Awesome, thanks so much. I stopped reading this ages ago, around episode 90~, so this torrent is...well, awesome. I'll keep it seeded. 

Thanks!"
,nimbus123,2008-01-14T20:05Z,Thanks for this. Really great. I watched the anime a few episodes a long time ago and recently watched the series again. It sucks that it just stopped. This is great though.
,shanlot751,2008-04-23T05:47Z,"for this, you rock. Thanks"
,TeknoXI,2008-08-02T07:26Z,"Great torrent. Thanks for the time spent organizing and naming the files. I'm sure it was really time consuming.

On that note, Berserk_v32c277p16 is an extra file. It should be c278p16 (which is the same and correct file). Just wanted to point it out. 

Thanks again."
