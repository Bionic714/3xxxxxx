,RawSnake,2007-09-30T05:07Z,"In the game info it says addon.....why dont people read the info when its there, and complain when its not there (not meaning just you rollercoaster)"
,VisionFactory,2007-10-01T22:09Z,"Buy the game if you like it!
The following procedure is useful to test the game, or to play
on a LAN with friends and keep your Original key protected!

0.) Make sure you have a Firewall up and running to block any packets that are being sent to report
    your installation and key!

1.) use Armed_Assault_KEYGEN-RAZORDOX to create a unique key!
    (or use one of the keys below - but only if you can't get the keygen!)

2.) install Armed.Assault.REAL.PROPER-ViTALiTY with a fresh RZR key!
    Do NOT use the Vitality key from their NFO! It's blacklisted and the following updates will not install!

3.) update 1.04 -> 1.05 is on the same image! install it! (check Vitality folder!)

4.) update 1.05 -> 1.08 (international update!)

5.) Backup the current arma.exe + amra_server.exe somewhere!
    (for future updates!)

---- Special Note -----

If you only want to update ARMA and not install the Queen's Gambit Addon,
you can now copy arma.exe from the FairLight DOX Release
Armed Assault 1.08 International Update *CRACKFIX* (flt-a18r.rar) into the gamedir,
and start the game!

If you want to install the Addon, DON'T do this, and continue below!

---- End Special Note ----

6.) install Armed_Assault_Queens_Gambit-FLT
    copy the cracked exe from the dvd-image to your gamedir.

    HAVE some FUN!



some ARMA keys: (only for LAN games!)

,PoopRobbins,2007-10-08T12:21Z,"I downloaded this and the other almost identical armed assault Queens Gambit and for BOTH I get a CRC error when trying to unpack the ISO - I even tried to re download the first 4 package files, figuring it must be in one of them the error occur . . .  As this did not solve the problem I can only conclude that these torrent lead to a flawed download with CRC errors, so my advice is: DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!"
,PoopRobbins,2007-10-08T14:19Z,My bad - the CRC error happens when using 7zip and NOT with winRar!
,sviskon,2007-10-26T14:50Z,"WHY DO I GET THIS ERROR?

""Error compiling vertex shader VSTerrain""

When trying to start the game."
,Tiger_Zip,2007-12-05T14:52Z,"Seed this game more when you have download it!! i will do it when i have downlaod it! do it for all other how want this game to, and may your self if you may most reinstall your computer one day and want this game again, if there is no seeders you  most buy the game its simple, so plz seed!"
,Jack4000111,2008-01-15T22:16Z,"I dont know why but the map screen is blackend-out so I really can't play queens gambit properly. 

The map screen works fine in the original Campaign.

Anybody got any ideas why the map screen is black?

I know I know you can only expect this from pirated games and you should buy the game if you like it. 

But I dont like it cause I cant play it!"
,Anthony817,2008-07-21T23:47Z,"Okay, so I can play online with this right?I have finished downloading ARMA.I am useing the Razor1911 keygen since the vitality key is backlisted.

This will work online is all I want to know.Thanks for such a great upload!"
,chowpang,2008-07-23T17:54Z,Anthony817: No it will not work as most servers are using 1.14 and there is no key for that.
,Anthony817,2008-07-23T21:16Z,"THIS IS A VERY USEFULL TOO FOR RUNNING YOUR OWN DEDICATED SERVERS!

I fount that with the game patched to 1.8, I couldnt host my own server at all or I would get an invalid CD Key message, and be unable to start my server, and I couldnt join 60% of the other 1.8 servers.

This is the ONLY way that I could possibly start a server at all!

This tool is great for bypassing the Invalid CD Key Code message and starting your own dedicated server.You may e able to start your own server with 1.41!?!? 

Please somebody that has tried this with 1.41 reply and let us know if we can run our own servers with QG!!!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool is for launching a dedicated server in armed assault. 
You can select most of the server options from the interface and run a server from any execute which is in the exe's current directory.
