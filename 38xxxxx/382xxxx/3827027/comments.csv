,YouSuckMan,2007-11-04T18:45Z,"BvvM's patch contains a virus, fyi:

FineObj.dll
Backdoor.Win32.Rbot.ets 

Zonelabs caught it, and if Zonelabs can catch anything at all, you can be sure it's legit virus.

Delete that file,the rest apparently works."

,patrick_peters,2008-01-10T16:28Z,"hello,
the patch has a virus!!!! I need the program urgent!!!! someone have a solution???"
,case286,2008-02-13T20:41Z,"i don't know about viruses or trojans but it works.

i recommend to use some firewall software like netlimiter or similar and just block every incoming and outgoing byte that claims to be finereader related. do the work and kill-uninstall-delete everything related + scan computer using antivirus and some spyware detection program (spybot usually does the trick)"
,karin1978,2008-06-21T22:28Z,"Hi there,

I desperately need help from anyone who could do me a bigggg..gggg favor.
I have downloaded an ""ABBYY FineReader 9.0 Pros"" from quite a few people here in TPB, they are working great. 
However, since I deadly need to have the Thai language supported, which all of the downloads from here couldn't avail my need. 

I do a further research on the ABBYY website itself, and found that i need to use the updated version to get Thai language supported. 
(Reference : http://www.abbyy.com/press/press_releases.asp?param=144054)
I then started to download the installation file from ABBYY website, its size is 243 MB. 
(Reference downloaded site : http://finereader.abbyy.com/?param=137544)

BUT after downloading and installing the software, I got a BIG problem about product activation. I try to play around with merging some files from the TPB version with 

the downloaded Thai support version, never success. 

Anyone could help me out of this please? Would be truly appreciated for your help and mercy.

If anyone would be able to help me, please write me kms2547(at)h0tmail(dot)com.

Best regards,

Karin"
,hand85,2008-09-20T04:54Z,"I also detected a Trojan Virus in the exe file with McAfee.  I really need this program and don't have the outrageous $400 price tag for it.  Does anyone know of a serial crack keygen or patch that will work?  This one may work, but will my computer be infected with a Trojan? I have been searching with no luck so far."
,masterely,2009-08-23T04:20Z,"Detected a trojan/virus? You shouldn't be worried about it. 

Cracked files/keygen files have always been labeled as malware by most anti-malware companies because of their nature to ""hack through"" program settings and alter it illegally.

But don't be alarmed, it's just a false-positive scan result. It's true that the patch is a trojan because it gives you ""illegal access"" to the program encryption. The patch is also considered a virus because it lets you alter the program illegal and what anti-malware companies would call ""corrupting"" the program code. 

I assure those who use the patch that it's safe.

*malware = programs/scripts that do harm or give unauthorized access to someone's computer. Examples are trojans, computer virus, worms, spyware, keyloggers, rootkits, crimeware. for more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware"
,apster101,2010-01-06T21:34Z,"This torrent no longer works (as of January 2010) because the link to the original patch provided by BvvM is no longer available (it's just a movie file at that location now).
Without the patch, this program only works in trial mode (15 days) which you can d/l for free from CNET anyway. If you want the torrent of this, you need to go to one of the other torrents available for this application."
