Mind blowing !

Many thanks for all the work that obviously went into this...

I bet an official box-set release wouldn't be as comprehensive as this. And the record companies still don't get why people download stuff. The fact that Muse remains unreleased on cd speaks volumes.

This is awesome...thank you so much."
