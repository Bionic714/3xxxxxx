Thnx for downloading this and showing your defiance to people who create origami but refuse to share it!
i propose that we all upload  this file to as many places as we possibly (torrent trackers, gnutella clients,
make videos for youtube, metacafe, and anywhere else you can think of) can to make sure that anyone can
have access to this wonderful rose. And anyway the creator just built on what the great Mr kawasaki had 
already designed.
