,oblachubs,2007-10-06T14:58Z,This one will not play for me.  I believe it's corrupt.  Part 2-4 do though.

Great film, absolutely brilliant piece of film work"
,dpippin01,2007-11-09T05:48Z,"I can only get part 5,6,7 to play the rest won't on VLC or winamp?  What codec or player are you guys using?"
,mysticganja420,2008-01-09T19:40Z,"Just go this had same prob on most my players(WMP, BS, WAMP) But there is 2 ways you can go about making it work.  The first and easy way is to just go out and download VLC Player it seems to have no probs playing the movie.  the 2nd is just reencode the video IE avi to avi with a program or what ever you want.  Hope this helps"
,Mensch1,2008-02-23T15:45Z,Don't usually write comments but this one deserves a lot of praise. I have all 7 episodes (seeding) and all work perfect. Great upload---Thanks Smoke
,smokeonit,2008-08-24T08:10Z,"thnx guys for all the shouts, sorry to hear that the usual suspects had roblems playing some of these files back:

always use VLC with divx/xvid! if your on a mac you can use the perian plugin for the quicktime player to play back divx/xvid! that way you can watch everything via the built in front row!!!

on mininova there's a complete list if you search for ""the war ken burns"" and also high def 720p as well as the SDTV rips i seeded..."
,Layor,2008-12-04T14:05Z,I downloaded all sections and only 3 and 4 will play for me. The rest are just blank. I tried to re-encode them and burn them and had no luck at all. The two are good though but I wish I knew what the problem was. I just deleted the bad ones and will wait until another posting comes around. Sorry but thanks anyway

Great audio and video quality, very high and stable download speed considering the number of seeds.

Kudos for your effort, both to smokeonit and the seeders."
