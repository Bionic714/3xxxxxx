,goodz,2007-10-17T15:25Z,yep.. it does not work... sadly. Many games lately where incomplete or with very bad cracks that made them work bad or not at all. What is happening to the scene?

Good Luck seeders and leechers! 

Big thanx to changoboy.

,re0n,2008-07-05T16:28Z,"ok got it to mount with DTools guys. heres what i did:

1. get this http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3867509/Fantasy_Wars_.mds

2. after downloading the changoboy files extract them in a folder.

3. rename the (not the fix) image file to ""pro-fwars.mdf"" mds->mdf 

4. Now put the image fix in th same folder. you should now have 2 files in that folder:
""pro-fwars.mdf""  4.38 GB
""pro-fwars.mds""  4.73 KB

5. Now mount* the ""pro-fwars.mds"" and your set :)

6. Now you can Burn/Play/Poop

* Note: if you cant see the file in the mount list make sure to select ""All Files (.*.)"" from the ""Files of Type:"" list

I've played it a bit and it works perfectly. Next time test you shit before uploading it bro, but thanks anyway."
,ObbiObbi,2008-07-16T23:22Z,"Hrm, can't seem to get this to work right in Daemon Tools. After I grab the .mds file and extract the .mdf file, I try to mount the .mds and it brings up an invalid image file error!

Terrible."
