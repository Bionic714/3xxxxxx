Fantasy Wars is a turned-based tactical strategy game for the PC with 3 campaigns featuring an in-depth storyline. Set in a fantasy world rife with war. The game is played in a hex format that strategy gamers will be used to. However, when zoomed out, the players will see their unit represented more accurately with, for example, the actual number of orcs in your orc archer unit. While zoomed out, youll also be able to see the battles take place in real-time.
