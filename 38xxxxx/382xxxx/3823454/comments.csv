,mask.of.sanity,2008-02-13T06:08Z,"Hi Ovisbdan, 
First up thanks for the upload. You've undoubtedly already answered my question but can you play SA-MP or MTA mods using this? I only just found out about them, so sorry if I sound like a n00b. I'm in Australia too - will that prevent me accessing the servers?
Cheers "
,mask.of.sanity,2008-02-13T06:10Z,Or better to hang out for the old skool version? I'm on a pretty shit connection.
,ovisebdan,2008-02-13T15:15Z,"I'm sorry, but you can't play SA-MP or MTA with Rv2
you can only play using the unmodified version of GTA SA and it doesn't matter what country you live in

P.S. GTA SA Old Skool will be a completely different game than Rv2, so I think you should try Rv2 too

SA OS will probably be ready in about a month"
,djtdon,2008-02-14T14:44Z,"why would u upload thhis?

u cant mod v2 and theres allready v1 with loads of seeds "
,Fast_Forward,2008-02-17T20:43Z,"Okey, there are obviously some bugs here. I have an issue with textures and stuff, sometimes things disappears or blinks, and sometimes I can't see textures allright. Any solution to this very graphical problem?"

But can you also do all the missions?"
,ovisebdan,2008-07-03T22:40Z,"""The most important thing is that you can, unlike in
the first version, actually finish the game by accomplishing all the missions.""

it never hurts to read the description"

,ovisebdan,2009-05-26T22:19Z,Totally.
,Hamezzz,2009-05-31T12:10Z,"This is V2, right?
A few years ago the ""hot coffee mod"" with hidden sex scenes was making Rockstar Games look bad, so they did some creative thinking and decided to release V2. This version of the game makes modding and using trainers almost impossible. I was dumb enough to buy this version of the game. It took me a long time to find something that would downgrade the game back to v1, so I could actually have some fun. 
Its up to you, if you want to download an inferior version of the game."
,ovisebdan,2009-06-15T15:22Z,"@Hamezzz
Dude.
This is a modified version of GTA San Andreas called ""GTA SA Real v2"". It has nothing to do with Rockstar's v2 patch."
,GallardoMarin,2010-05-19T14:55Z,Foarte tare !
,paraskevas1996,2010-06-20T15:52Z,"From Paris
Ovisebdan your torrent is having the best cars in the world!Unfortunately it had a big problem:when i was driving around it was took too long to load.So i delete it.But keep the good work."

U RULE PLS DONT GIVE UP ON V3 IT WOULD BE ASWOME!!"
,Husker89,2010-08-29T04:21Z,"I'm getting game crashes 5 minutes into the game. Every time I load it up and start to play the mouse stops responding during gameplay. It works in the pause menu. So after going to the pause menu to maybe jump start the games response to the mouse I get a black screen and have to get the task manager to close the program. It keeps crashing like this, I've barely done the first mission."
,Philonetic,2011-03-05T10:47Z,"First, - YOU DONT HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE MOD AUTHORS TO UPLOAD
Secondly - This is a horrible mod pack.  You shoved the best cars you could find in the game and probably NEVER played this through.  Too many high poly models make the game crash, this isn't GTA4 with it's taxi poly fix, this just crashes.
DONT USE THIS OUTDATED PACK.
Find newer mods online."
,ovisebdan,2011-04-18T00:52Z,"@Philonetic

First of all, check out the date when this torrent was uploaded. That's right, more than 3.5 years ago.
Second of all, I don't need their permission to upload this, as long as I don't take credit for their work and I don't charge money for it. Sure, I could have credited them, but I didn't. Boo-hoo.
Third, the problem is not that I used too many high-poly mods, the problem is that when I made this mod (more than 3.5 years ago, remember?) I did not know how to make the game work with all those mods. It is possible and now I know how I should have done that.

You dumb piece of shit. :)"
,Flogeras,2011-04-19T17:16Z,hello uploader :) thanks for the game but you can upload it to a direct download site???m_e_gaupload._co_m as example..pleaseee
