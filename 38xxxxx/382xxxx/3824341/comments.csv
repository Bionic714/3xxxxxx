I'm running on a legal vista, and I have the same problem. So there is no fix for vista yet? I'll try this on my XP later D: but my XP machine is a piece a crap..woo good luck to me.

Went from Daemon to Iso, let me know if you guys have any suggestion. I might buy this myself, I'll try asking the website and posting back later as if I purchased it."
,wl1000jae,2008-02-04T03:03Z,how the hell do i download this??i'm confused..
,soZexy,2008-02-04T05:00Z,"wl1000jae, torrent 101:
use a torrent program like utorrent, download the torrent file from link above where it says ""DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT"", load that file into your torrent program. The torrent file is just a text file that tells the program where to look for the actual download.
Cheers :)"
,soZexy,2008-02-04T05:02Z,"..well, not a text file actually but you get the idea :)"
