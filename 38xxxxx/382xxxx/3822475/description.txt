Release Notes:

Eagerly awaited second ECM album by French-African drummer Manu
Katch?. Recorded in New Yorkâ??s Avatar Studio in January 2007,
â??Playgroundâ?? picks up where the best-selling â??Neighbourhoodâ?? left
off: in the interim the project has coalesced into a rip-roaring
and fully-integrated band. Manuâ??s group, featuring a
Polish/Norwegian confederacy of young players, is energized by his
hard driving drums and by his compositions which invite spirited
solos... Together, the quintet - whose strong new frontline
features Mathias Eick and Trygve Seim - makes exciting, zestful
music.
