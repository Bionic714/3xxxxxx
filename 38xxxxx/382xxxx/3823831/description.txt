The 27th Lancers Alumni Drum & Bugle Corps. performed an exhibition at the 1994 DCI Finals in Boston, MA. They performed the following tunes:

Crown Imperial
The Wee MacGregor
Drum Solo
Danny Boy

This was obviously taken from a broadcast of the show (most likely from a video). The sound quality it "OK". There are a couple of minute slips during "The Wee MacGregor" and a very brief interval of static in "Drum Solo". Otherwise it is a pretty good archive of the Lancer's performance (though if someone should have the video, all the better!).
