I saw his show once in america and just had to get this.
i still piss myself laughing at this.

in swedish.
Den e helt enkelt bara så jävla grym.
Dock utan text så antingen får ni fatta engelska eller ladda ner DVD'n o hoppas på den har text.
Vilket fall som.. Detta är något av det roligaste ni kan hitta!

ALL HAIL ACHMED AND PEANUT!

,Tolle44,2007-10-21T01:57Z,"Can someone tell me the difference between this copy and the one filling 4Gb? Is it pure quality or am i missing out on something by downloading this copy?

Anyway, great guy, i downloaded his other show ""arguing with myself"", it was so funny i had to lookup if there was more.. and luckily there was!

,xxX_-NeverDie-_Xxx,2007-11-24T00:35Z,"I like dunham AND this torrent! =P
Really fast torrent this one, (300 seeders, duhu!!)"
,xxX_-NeverDie-_Xxx,2007-11-24T00:37Z,"@ galfisk: you can burn .avi's to dvd's to but you might wanna adjust the delay between audio AND video... so if you wanna wait 6 times longer, (maybe more or less), its ok..."
,xxX_-NeverDie-_Xxx,2007-11-24T00:41Z,"@ galfisk (again): its harder to burn .avi's to DVD's and i suggest you create a .iso and TEST it on a DVD+/-RW so if it goes wrong, you can always recover it! :)
(And of course, if you get it right... you can always burn it on a normal DVD+/-R)"
