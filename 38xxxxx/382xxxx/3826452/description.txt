Washington, D.C.'s historic Warner Theater is the stage for this sold-out performance by ventriloquist virtuoso Jeff Dunham and his host of hilarious characters, known collectively as the "suitcase posse." Joining regular posse members such as Peanut, Walter, Sweet Daddy Dee, Jose Jalape√±o and Bubba J are Dunham's newest character creations, Achmed the Dead Terrorist and Melvin the Superhero.
