,deviant00,2007-12-12T19:45Z,"saint_berzerker: Even if the serial is cracked, you still need the actual hardware for this to work - which is why it is provided in two versions. One for M-Audio hardware, and one for Digidesign hardware. "
,Bernhardtsen74,2007-12-19T22:05Z,Is this version for m-audio soundcards or mac?
,saint_berzerker,2008-01-01T02:57Z,"deviant:  I have a maudio card, not a digidesign.

The only thing it says to do with the Maudio setup is to install it then delete the program folder?  That's it?  I can't even launch Maudio version because in step 3 it says to delete it.  LOL...I don't know."

,yurt101,2008-05-04T20:02Z,what actual hardware do i need to use this program? im looking into teaching myself how to use this software and was wondering what all do i need
,MisplacedFate1313,2008-07-20T07:33Z,"Pro Tools requires investment in certain hardware components. There is a good list comparing the costs and requirements of various audio recording programs at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multitrack_recording_software

Pro Tools gets a lot of music press because of it's versatility, but it does require you to put a little something into it. Try FL Studio or Cakewalk SONAR for good recording software that doesn't require special hardware."
