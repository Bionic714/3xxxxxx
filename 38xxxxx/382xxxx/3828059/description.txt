Ok, this torrent includes the following:

-crack

Here's how to install:

1) Install ProTools M-Powered and make sure you have the latest driver for your M-Audio hardware.
2) Reboot
3) Delete Pro Tools folder from installed directory (default: C:Program FilesDigidesign) windows will warn you, click OK to delete
4) Install ProTools 6.7 LE (do NOT install any DIGI hardware drivers, uncheck box in installation)
5) Reboot
6) Extract files from "step 8.rar" to C:Program FilesDigidesignPro Tools
7) Open ProToolsLE.exe
8) Enter serial number then close protools
9) Extract files from "step 11.rar" to C:Program FilesDigidesignPro Tools

It takes awhile to setup, but it's working fine on my machine. The end result is that you'll be using ProTools LE, but it's compatible with M-Audio hardware.

Note: If you are having problems with the Digidesign drivers, this might help.
