The quality of this torrent is better and the resolution is higher."
,duhprane,2007-09-28T08:23Z,Another must see.... great stuff.
,i_like_freedom,2007-09-29T00:06Z,"it's a documentary about how the world works... very complex stuff.. can't be explained easily here on TPB... 

better to just download/watch and see! (you won't be disappointed... you need some patience though, the film is very long... but VERY good)"
,duhprane,2007-09-29T05:08Z,"This is the movie that will explain how it is that you are not free, and everything you think you know about politics, money, power, fame and history is a fabrication. Like Napoleon said, - History is a predetermined lie."
,Gerry_A,2007-09-29T07:36Z,"Geez, another paranoia movie. I'll just get depressed and commit suicide."
,duhprane,2007-10-06T07:27Z,"good, fuck ya anyway"
,Bloody100,2007-10-09T06:55Z,"Even if not every single word is to be believed as-is, this film describes the major problem of our planet very well. Even if this is a long movie, it is well worth watching. Seed this!"
,Bloody100,2007-10-09T20:38Z,"An audio-fixed version can be found here:

,flforce,2007-11-03T07:33Z,"People laugh and mock you if they think you are a conspiracy theorist.  One day they will be sorry they did not pay closer attention to the truth.  Truth that was right in front of them all along if they only opened their eyes.  

God help us, help ourselves."
,Nazzhorn,2008-01-28T05:51Z,THX!
,Ghis1964,2008-03-18T10:35Z,"I've downloaded the suppositly ""audio fixed"" version;please don't ask.

Don't worry about the ""people"" who says that some info in this are not true, ""they"" are link. "
,Ghis1964,2008-03-20T06:19Z,"audio is same as other version---- but I don't mind----- 
the important thing------- get this file everywhere you can up-load it-------- part my up-load were consider hateful-?-!-?-!-?-!---- you'll see after viewing this file who are the the ones who will try to block this------- pass-it on.

Peace"
,aspartaami,2008-04-30T13:41Z,"No-one's trying to block this aside from the regular p2p-haters, you paranoid king of fools. What's keeping people from watching this is the negative experiences from ""documentaries"" like Zeitgeist or other ones containing lots of misinformation and sheer intentional lying. I'm gonna have to watch this though... It's the only way to see if I'm right about this."
,jwalkn1,2008-10-25T06:43Z,total NWO propaganda. 
,xdream85,2008-10-30T20:33Z,"about 75% of the things said in this film is true, the rest is fabrication and imagination. The world is collapsing, slow and painful, and in less than 50 years most of the polar ices will be gone and tsunamis will be spread worldwide and more powerful than the ones we have seen so far."
,highlander777,2008-11-02T06:30Z,"Just finished watching the third video file. Wow. Conspiracy theories galore! Some of it obviously isn't true but enough of it is very compelling. I'd like to see a detailed review of this series of videos. I'll seed this for a while yet.

,felipon,2008-11-21T03:08Z,"Long, but very good documentary!

I will seed for long, right now iÂ´m up at 120 GB."
,Iauruth,2008-11-21T07:43Z,"The google video and youtube videos are indeed bad quality, but I watched the beginning. As soon as I started chapter 4, I decided to download this video in fear that it would be censored. (looks like it has been)
Also, don't forget to make up your own mind, even though a lot of this is neat, and very much true... You can't believe everything you hear. Come up with your own opinions."
,dxmjunky420,2008-11-22T11:05Z,"Someone should start a church for those of us that beleive this. I'm athiest and looking for some type of group to not feel so alone. The religions today just want money, i'd like to see a place you go and just talk ideas away it'd be pretty cool. I loved the 2 zietguist movies and lookin forward to this one. thanks freedom for postin (smily face inserted here)"
,Esmad3,2008-12-13T03:39Z,"The ""religion-debunk"" part is largely useless. A movie wont convince a religious person that he's wrong. Some christians are are fiercely anti-nwo and they are among the good guys in my book. Why alienate them?"
,Ov4ar,2008-12-15T10:04Z,"So much interesting information compiled in this 4 hour movie, 10x for uploading man :)"

Thx a bunch for the upload m8 !"

Ok. to all who wants a place to discuss this. go here. i just created this forum for this purpose only and i will be moderating it myself."
,thesilverpanther,2009-02-27T23:38Z,"This is unfortunately nonsense, when you cross reference ""sources"" so to speak they contradict each other (reference the source not a statement or idea in the source), it's just a patchwork of conjecture, not to say there is no truth, but what is the point it being buried in this documentaries dysfunctional fantasy? Pardon my comments but I think I am being fair, and I am at a loss with regards to  statements that someone has researched this and found it to be consistent and accurate. Disappointing considering who gave it to me and the comments, uninspiring fiction. I do believe in conspiracies and intricate political machinations and manipulation of power but this is crap, pardon the language, and just who is this unnamed mysterious award winning documentary producer who also apparently takes credit for investigating this documentary (not to say they didn't but just who is it were crediting)? Gday. Yes I posted the same comment on another version of this file as well because I'm mean that way."
,thesilverpanther,2009-02-28T17:03Z,"This is a home made movie. No credits. Badly ripped Fox intro. Notovich, Ellis & Joseph Smith Junior (who is apparently a free mason and a latter day saint, referenced as a mormon in the documentary and for some reason insinuates a connection between his death and his publication) conflicting resources. Presentation of facts where they are true misleading (caesar elevated to deity 2 years after his assassination probably to placate his supporters), Josephus accounts are unverified and referenced by Ellis vaguely at his convenience and his name is flashed without noting his significance (if any), he was a politically connected celebrity historian with many works, the ""revelation"" that Amenemhat was Abraham, I couldn't find anything on this assumedly famous Antonio Bola excavator (try different spellings), the phrase ""Egyptologists agree"" is thrown around willy nilly and through my casual research I find no correlation between what this documentary claims is publicly accepted and available truth and historical theories, obviously another conspiracy to hide the truth that everyone agrees upon and knows about yaa? And the views of Egyptologists on MANY matters hardly consistent. Can't reference unverified conflicting works vaguely and inaccurately which themselves were poorly investigated (Ellis in particular calls his works ""interpretations"" by the way and the concept of his writings strike me as vanity) and stitch things together throw your own spin on it without any formal crediting, no reference to this mysterious award winning narrater/producer/researcher who for some reason created this poor quality homemade production OMG conspiracy.

This is home made, took a lot of effort but in spite of the truths it may contain they are badly misrepresented and interwoven with fantasy. This is incidentally the best way to tell a lie no? In the quest to be open minded it seems people are being fooled quite easily, you can't reference this documentary as truthful, enlightening or legitimate. Swordfish is more educational.

9/11 was so obviously a conspiracy. Or everyone watching the airspace was retarded or on drugs and forgot there are laws requiring states to have procedures in place for any form of anomaly especially alarming is the massive flight path deviation & loss of comms for an IFR flight, how explosive the buildings turned out to be. I argued with a lecturer and he said the most plausible explanation would be the planting of bombs in the building by ""terrorists"" which he thought of as very frightening (how would they pull that off and if that was the issue than whats aviation security got to do with it?). I find it frightening that people in the industry I work in should know better but are too politically correct not to believe in official findings on 911. I have forgotten my cell on at work, you don't get reception at altitude. I wonder if posting this is in violation of my companies new NDA (bloody nonsense).

Also in 911 official explanations take the official story and fit things around it thereby re""imagining"" known physical and structural properties since obviously the scenario they were given must be true and so everything if made to fit around it in some way or another must by extension be true."
