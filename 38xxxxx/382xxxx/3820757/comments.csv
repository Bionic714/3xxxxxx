,oblachubs,2007-09-30T17:40Z,Which episode is this?  Can you seed them all?  Thanks much.
,oblachubs,2007-10-01T01:34Z,"OK waste of time.  This is the stupid Elija Wood movie with Kevin Costner, not the recent PBS special.  Why downloadman decided to upload this movie now raises suspicion since there is no obvious description below.  Deception at it's best.

Yes I actually downloaded the damn thing and played it to verify."
