I was one too, but I wiped the sleep from my eyes after viewing some of Alex Jones work.  I tried very hard to prove him wrong because I didn't want to believe.  But his info is solid.  Make use of the internet and the freedom of information act while you can.  Spread the word and awaken the sleepers."
,atom224,2007-10-10T00:27Z,"same here, I thought alex was a wack job.  Then I went and checked some of his sources.  The stuff is just too scary to be true - but it is.  But if people want to gamble away their retirement in the stock market, believe the mass entertainment (news), and be oppressed by their government, then to hell with them.  We don't need a bunch of idiots around anyways.  I just sit quietly and watch consumer debt go through the roof, our trade deficit climbing, a government that is shamefully overspending, people gobbling up goods from COMMUNIST CHINA, more of our civil liberties taken away, and a country that just doesn't feel like enforcing our laws or protecting our borders.  If it doesn't make you want to scream then there has got to be something wrong with you.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_identity
  excerpt: ""Christian Identity is a label applied to a wide variety of loosely-affiliated churches with a racialized theology"" and includes Aryan Nations and other white supremacist groups."
