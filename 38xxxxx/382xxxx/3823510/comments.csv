,maximilianx264,2008-07-15T07:55Z,"Ignore catspremiers07 feelings about the visual quality of this torrent ~ it is the best available version of the movie and IT IS noticeably more detailed than the DVD versions, which is surely the point. 

CatsP is looking at the glass half empty ~ (he has dissed another HD rip of this movie also - hmmm?) ~ but for me, this is a clean HD rip of a great movie, that will fit on a single DVD.

If you love this movie, do yourself a favor and get this torrent, it is much nicer than the standard-res versions! 

(There's a SHORT SAMPLE included, take a look at that first, and make up your own mind)."
