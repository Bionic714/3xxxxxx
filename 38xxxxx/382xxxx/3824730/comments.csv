@karlsson_patriot: If you're in such a hurry why don't you take your bike and ride your lame ass down to the music store and buy the f***ing album."

,Toomuchmusic,2008-03-04T08:25Z,"thanks for this, doesn't matter how long it takes to get, it's freeeeeeee. The nerve of some people to complain about something they are getting for free before they thank the person who is sharing. It is like saying damn man it was too hard to click the ""Download this torrent"" button, lol. This is a great share thanks for your work to get it to us and thanks to the seeders who help keep this going."
