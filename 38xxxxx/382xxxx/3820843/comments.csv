won't repeat itself - right wing violence
is of course dreadfull - but left wing violence 
is much worse - in Denmark for instance. 
Many europeans has the this strange view that 
right wing violence hurts more than that 
from the leftwing radicals, but that's bullshit.

As far as islamic violence - you just wait - the 
worst has yet to come......."

In sweden the farleft violence is straight out antidemocratic and violent while the nazis and facists consists of small groups that mainly keep to themselfs and try to make it into the government (3% votes is needed)."
,tomtomx,2007-10-06T19:09Z,Yeah right. Yesterday a gang of Swedish neonazis destroyed an art exhibition on the grounds that they thought that the exhibition was immoral and didn't like it. So much for democracy and freedom of speech.
