,JohnDoe60914,2008-03-02T15:06Z,"O.k. to answer everyone's questions. You can get deamon tools here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3932020/DAEMON_Tools_Pro_Advanced_v4.10.0218_And_Patch

To seed you simply Leave the torrent you downloaded alone, you can install it but dont move it. also in the program you used to download it do not remove the finished download.

Seeding can take a long time due to many different things but the main one is the amount of bandwidth you have available. Think of bandwidth as the amount of water you can fit through a hose.Now you need to separate the water in the hose for outgoing and incomming.ISP's generally focus on the incomming leaving you little for outgoing. As if that wasnt bad enought ISP (internet service providers) are now starting to throttle upload and download speeds. comcast (my isp) promisses 1.5mb out going. After they throttle the hell out of my torrent upload i'm usually stuck at around 40 kbps. "
