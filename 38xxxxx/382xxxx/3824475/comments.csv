By the way I agree with her."
,Bamimi,2007-10-02T07:46Z,"yawn. do you people really need things like this? what diatribe. oh wait thats right, people like this can absolutely prove the gov blew up the twin towers....that is unless you listen to real information.....""fire doesnt melt steel as far as I know...""...""uhm then how is it forged?""...""uhm...uhm...oh shut up you bush apologizer!"" its funny how every other country on the world must be filled with totally honest leaders or something cause the US is the only one getting the attention...I think 'they' need to start letting in the press and people into their business before throwing stones, but no one evidently cares about other countries enough to bother."

If that stupid cocksucker did his homework he'd note that aircraft fuel when burning is NOT hot enough to melt steel, never mind how many firefighters were silenced over their claims they heard explosions... Of course, none of this is real in his world. Stupid dumb Bush terrorist supporter."
,djshiva,2007-12-11T09:35Z,"amazing how many people are willing to discount this book as simply another conspiracy theorist's rantings.  this book is not about conspiracies; it is a look at historical facts, juxtaposed against the very real machinations of power at work today.  you would do well to actually read this work before discounting it.  you might be surprised to find it's less ""sky is falling"" and more ""those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."""
,duhprane,2008-01-12T20:34Z,"Belief in any so called 9/11 conspiracies IS NOT REQUIRED for you to get fucked out of your freedom with it constantly being used as the excuse....

This book is NOT about 9/11 conspiracies....dipshit.

The author is mainstream, the book is about the methods being used to change the republic into a police state, not a whole lot of 9/11 here, except by the fuckers who use that as an excuse to do anything they want.

In life you can only read a limited ammount of books. Choose wisely. I recommend you choose this one, it will teach you more about history and the world we live in than all your high-school.

Thanks!"

The internet won't be around much longer, at least not the internet that you and I love.

The premise here is noble, but it will still lead to all our transactions and discussions online being monitored, and then ""terrorism"" will need to watched, and we all know where that will be going: Filters on public and private forums, those who would go against the government labeled ""terrorists"" and arrested for treason etc.

The technology already exists today, and I have a feeling it's already in use.  As some people have said, we have less time than you think.

I haven't read this book yet, but I hope it can inspire at least a few people to work to make a difference."
