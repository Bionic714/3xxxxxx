And do you have other Seinen/action/dark manga? 
I've uploaded few myself now too."
,MoshMage,2007-10-01T20:47Z,"I'm strating to read manga, and destributing it too. 
So, i don't even know anymore titles than these two i've uploaded.

,shouzo,2007-10-04T16:37Z,"If you like that kind of supernatural and/or dark mangas, you should check out: 

Berserk: Middleage. Drawings is simply amazing, I could use 5 minutes just to stare at all the details at only 1 page, this is rated adult!

Blame!/NOiSE: Futuristic. Wonderful drawings of buildings, extremely good use of imagination, complicated storyline, but good.

Hellsing: Present time, secret organization, vampires:D, pretty gory but not that kind of that make you sick.

Elfen Lied: Present time, some people have said it was much too bloody and/or have hentai/nude themes for them to read it.

Zombiehunter: Only released 21 chapters, not finished and propably will not be completed, detailed drawings and was the first to get rated 18+ for buying.

I've already uploaded Death Note...

I've got some others too, but tired of writing now:P"

,descendantofthesun21,2008-08-04T16:38Z,"Well...... I started the download of this; however, it's been going for an hour without picking up any seeds =["
