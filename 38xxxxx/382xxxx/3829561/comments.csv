Thank you"
,loopyloon,2008-04-13T00:15Z,You should only need the iso file. I think the Nero image file is the same as the iso image. But there is no crack. Don't waster your time on this torrent.
,Hatecomplications,2008-07-24T07:23Z,"No wonder people are buying this, there is no crack!  How about Quicken 2008?"
,ur2neat,2008-09-02T22:45Z,"Umm, maybe because Money 2007 has no product activation? Try it out before you make any assumptions."
,spooksinmynose,2008-10-04T00:39Z,so if i download this will i be able to use it without having a crack i dont understand
,sagen69,2009-03-17T01:55Z,this is a dead torrent. there is no seed. it stops at 99.8%!

,farvamx31,2010-07-09T04:45Z,"Yeah........ so I downloaded this, and I tried opening it, doing just the .iso file, and when it goes to install, it is Quicken. Figure it out dude. This is not Microsoft Money. It is Quicken. I know because I already have this version of Quicken. Soooo....... you are posting a torrent that won\'t even finish loading, and it is not even the program you have listed!"
