,T3KN0L4DY,2008-09-24T04:22Z,i believe piece 359 is corrupted.  it has failed to download about 15 times.  i guess 99.8% is just about as complete as it can be
,T3KN0L4DY,2008-09-24T16:12Z,"so it finally finished downloading.  this is a decent collection of ALL the songs from the game.  HOWEVER - the quality is pretty disappointing.  completely mono - clipping on the low end - as if someone just held a microphone up to the tv speaker...  unfortunately, this is the only torrent that exists right now.  download this until something better comes along."
