,glisk,2007-10-01T03:17Z,"No idea why this is not showing any seeds. I am seeding it, there's 2 peers.

Also, is it just me, ir is Piratebay a little picky with searches?  I searched ""avatar"" to see if this would come up, it didn't. I tried again, then nothing came up, and it told me to use an asterisk.  I searched ""avatar*"" and found it.

Who the hell uses asterisks in searches?  Isn't it just assumed?"
