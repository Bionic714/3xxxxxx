,The Living Homer,2008-02-06T21:58Z,"Yeah, when my download speed 25kB/s - 35kB/s is slower than my upload speed 40kB/s - 50kB/s there's something wrong. If the original seeder could please seed this more it would be greatly appreciated since no one else would like to share what they got for FREE"

,seeder77,2008-04-11T03:23Z,"I normally seed for 30 days, but as one said, this is a large file, unlike the one who complaind about dialup, I, like the original seeder, have a very awesome connection (T2), and because of the size, and the fact that I believe in sharing, I'm going to go past the 30 day mark and seed this till June 1st 2008, after that you'll have to depend on others, my hard drive is not infinite afer all..lol happy d/l'ing"
,17598801,2008-04-11T03:36Z,"thanks! 
but is it gonna keep going at 10kb/s or do i have to change some options or what? i still dont get how this thing works :(
"
,seeder77,2008-04-13T02:56Z,"thanks!
but is it gonna keep going at 10kb/s or do i have to change some options or what? i still dont get how this thing works :(

You're welcome :) but we had a power outage here last night and my ISP was offline for sometime, and, I'm messing with my security a bit (got some erm, new stuff) so I'll blink in and out for the next few days.
Last but not least, even after I'm up to full throttle later this week, it might take awhile before you manage to snag those of us with high speed.
Remember, the first rule in file sharing is patience.
Even if you only hook 1 server at dialup speed you'd get it by june 1st.
As long as you're getting 10+ on a single file, I'd say you're doing OK over dialup, it depends on how many seeders there are, as opposed to how many want it, we can't feed 50,000 people at once, lol.
(yeah I know it's not that high, but you get the idea of divided bandwidth I assume?)
Cheers, be patient, it's here till you get it, I ain't going nowhere... :)

,havens1515,2008-04-19T14:43Z,"Look guys, this torrent is over 21GB... that's HUGE! It is going to take a while to DL and there is nothing I can do anymore to hep you. It took me the whole summer to get this whole thing so if you get it in 3 days, feel lucky.

EVERY time I open the torrent there is over 300 people leaching, so even if there is NO seed at all you should be able to get decent speeds if you connect to enough people.

I have been opening it every week or so to make sure that it is still being shared in its entirety and that there isn't like 98% being shared or something like that. (since that is what happened to me last summer when I was trying to get it!)

So bottom line... be patient and you WILL get this. It may take a while to DL though even if you have the world's fastest connection."
,seeder77,2008-04-21T02:54Z,"-havens1515:
I give you my personal Thank You, as I have it in its entirety now. :)
Tomorrow when I get back up (Installing a couple larger HD's, someone keeps dling these HUGE files on my machine. ;) ) I'll happily rejoin you in the seeding.
Thank you very much for taking the time to share this with us in the first place!"
,Bondidude,2008-06-09T01:34Z,"Yeah yeah yeah...  This is another whiny plead for some decent seeding here.

Awesome torrent though, my girlfriend and I were going to try to Netflix some of the later seasons, post-high school, only to find out they stopped just short of those seasons on the DVD release before Disney cut the cord."
,Bondidude,2008-06-09T14:17Z,"Thanks for the quick response on the seeds!  I woke up this morning to find my speed had drastically increased and that it had cut my time down to a few days compared to a few weeks.

Thanks again!"
,seeder77,2008-06-14T00:52Z,"I switched clients, I have found that I like Azureus better. But it has a lot of knobs on it, took me a couple of days to make it as far as importing a torrent. :)
With all the peers that showed up, I'll keep seeding till I hit ""8"" at least.
(that's a 170 Gib upload, so no bitching pls)

Direct your thx to havens1515, I wouldn't have it if it wasn't for him/her.
Cheers. :)

,coyoteno,2009-08-26T20:42Z,"Quality is decent, some episodes have audio syncing problems, it lags 1000 milliseconds in S7E11, I think it's the same in E10 as well, you can change this in VLC, just go to the advanced audio settings"

,LRD3,2010-06-16T03:32Z,i will deff seed this one until there are no more leachers 
,johne86,2010-09-22T11:50Z,"This torrent has been around for three years and only one person managed to notice the sync issue. Since season 7 is my favorite season i noticed the issue right away, here is a quick and permanent sync fix that doesn't involve you having to deal with the issue every single time you play the file.

1. Download VirtualDub
2. Open your file in VirtualDub. 
3. Go to Audio>Interleaving and experiment with the 'Audio Skew Correction' setting (1000 ms = 1 second). Make sure both Video and Audio are set to 'Direct Stream Copy' 
4. Finally go to File>Save As AVI. Play your new file and check the sync. If it's still not right just repeat the process until it's OK, though it should have worked.

Side note: how is it that seasons 1-3 are not DVDRips what a rip, i mean they were released way back in 04 and 05. and yet no matter where you look finding DVDRips of the first three season is damn near impossible."
,DxDawgg,2010-10-27T10:17Z,plz seed its downloading so sloww
,coolguycj81,2010-12-22T19:58Z,"episode 4 from season 1 is wrong data, at least on my download I got an episode of him all grown up from season 7 or something way out of order not the one with the title it says, please reseed the fix, cuz originally when I downloaded this way back it was right I was pretty sure, but I could have just forgotten. I suspect it got corrupted or mixed up somehow though. If it's wrong please download episode 4 some other torrent like season 1 & resubmit & get rid of this one that has bad data to help others who want to watch this in order."
,coolguycj81,2010-12-22T19:59Z,"Oh & I tried re-checking the data & it still insists its correct, but that episode is not right."
,coolguycj81,2010-12-22T20:21Z,"ok nm its correct episode, just wrong intro.... the intro is from at least a few years into it the better intro but it's a little off putting for the time frame of the episode since obviously he's not anywhere near the same age and it immediately makes you think dang it that have this mislabelled, but go ahead and watch the episode without worry of being in wrong order it's the right episode, just the wrong intro."
,WasteCrushinFinale90,2011-01-18T05:50Z,can somebody please seed im on 95.2 percent and cant get this will seed when done PROMISE

,Rianski,2011-10-31T06:44Z,"Horrible quality, don't bother."
,JonOyer,2012-02-10T10:05Z,"I don't know why you all are complaining about speed and seeds. I just completed this download with 58 seeders at an average download speed of 4.5 Mbps. It took about an hour. I'm not trying to sound mean or arrogant, just saying it might be your connection as opposed to the amount of seeders. Either way I will Seed this to probably a ratio of 10.0 because this is obviously the best show ever! Hopefully my seeding contribution speeds up the process for you guys!!!"
,BloodyThorns,2012-07-27T01:46Z,"These episodes are TERRIBLE!  I couldnt find this anywhere else, so I dvd ripped all 7 seasons.

Check out my uploads for a much better rip."
