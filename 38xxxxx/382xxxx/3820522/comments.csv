,MMacairan,2007-11-25T16:39Z,"C'mon guys. What happened?  I saw the seeders go from 3 to 1 and downloaders go from some larger number (like 18) down to only 4 downloaders. Let's not give up so easily. Downloads wil get faster as we move along.

And many thanks to Roguesci for sharing this. It's an awesome up.  "

I cant make it work in VLC and if i try to burn it into a DVD it says ""Unreadable File"", and i have tried in maybe 3 different ways to burn it into the DVD, 

how do i make this imagefile working ?? plz help"
,27greg,2007-12-31T12:53Z,"when I choose to download the streetfight- file, it started downloading the whole 37 GB.  Can I try with another torrent program e.g. Azureus??? Please???"
,27greg,2007-12-31T14:10Z,"download completed, now what can't open it what is an iso file?"
,0612Devil,2008-01-12T17:48Z,"You need an .iso burning program like nero / sonic mydvd / or alcohol 120 to burn the images onto dvd.  Either that, or you could use a program called Daemon Tools (free download from their website) to ""mount"" the .iso file.  This makes the computer think a dvd with this image is in the drive and plays it.  "
