But responsibility soon knocks on the door of the loft apartment Andy shares with two fellow slackers: Kevin, a nerdy 17-year-old who wears his SAT score on his shirt and his admiration for big brother Andy on his sleeve, moves in. And for good measure, so does the French family's dog. Friends, roomies, canines, countrymen: lend me your beers. They're all part of the daze of Andy's life. And all here in this Complete Series DVD Set. Party on.
