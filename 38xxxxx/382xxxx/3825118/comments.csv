,HeavyAbuser,2007-10-01T06:21Z,"This is a GREAT old game. Kind of like a fantasy RTS with some extras. You get to do research, and there are a LOT of different unit types. It looks wonderful and is a lot of fun, but plays slowly -- it's deep not shallow.

Best way to play it is with DosBoX. The resolution is just VGA (320x200) so if you use DosBox to run it you can turn on filtering and see it in apparent SVGA (640x480 or higher).

If you like to think, and like challenging strategy games, give this one a try -- it's STILL on my hard drive after more than ten years ..."

Old school.... Ah, those days... :) 
Giving this a try right now. 

I have a tweaked dosbox tha allows the user to speed up the emulation, using cpu cycles and frameskips.. 

Click me to find it :)"
,MazterL,2007-10-03T02:08Z,"Hmmm... This download doesn't contain any executeable files... 

No .exe; .com; .bat

It contains .ccd; .cue, .img and .sub

I can mount the .ccd and .cue but that doesn't work well with DosBox... 

Any help? "

,FONOHM,2007-11-07T20:25Z,"mount image and install with which file, there is no .exe "
,Scorpius-X,2007-11-24T05:33Z,Can someone seed this file please? There's one seeder for this file but he doesn't seed at all -.-
,Scorpius-X,2007-11-24T05:35Z,"It's a great game and I'm prepared to seed it for quite some time after downloading, but can people please just seed it a little bit more so the torrent doesn't die?"
