Like the rap torrent I have created, this one is a collection of Alternative hits that I grew up on. These days, Alternative is defined as the crap that My Chemical Romance comes out with. These are a representation of the classics. As before, not all of the songs have the perfect bitrate or perfect file name since I have been collection them since 1997. There will be more to come. Enjoy!
