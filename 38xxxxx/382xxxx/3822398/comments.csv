,Dstone5,2009-08-29T10:33Z,"Just as with several other people, not just for this torrent but for another EE torrent, it crashes. I don't understand it entirely."
,fleischi93,2010-01-20T22:42Z,Don't work :/
,Serefan,2010-05-05T20:26Z,"If anyone has problems with graphics or something like that, try changing the 3D acceleration mode in the settings ingame. It helped with anyone I know who had problems."
,TheKillingName,2010-05-28T18:38Z,seed plz :D
,Rushedby,2010-06-03T17:20Z,"The game works, but when i start EE up in the main menu and other menus, i only see empty squares so without the text like single player or multyplayer in it. What should I do?"
,Ayantae,2010-06-14T14:48Z,Thx for this. I'll post compatability instructions here if I get it working.
,Ayantae,2010-06-14T17:32Z,"Compatability for Vista Home Premium 32bit:
-Play in compatability mode for Windows 2000
-Disable visual themes
-Disable desktop composition
-Disable display scaling
The game should now work.
You may get a bug where all you can see of the units is their shadows or their loincloths (lol)
I fixed this by making sure Windows Firewall is not blocking parts of the programme.

This is a great torrent because it's all zipped and ready to play, but be aware of two problems:
1. It seems to be impossible to update this to a higher version, you're stuck with v1.00
2. The learning campaigns are not included. However, you can download another EE torrent and steal the file from there. Or just play that version if you can work the crack.

Thanks uploader!"
,maxxx001,2010-07-20T03:34Z,good game..got some more thanks :)
,festy1,2010-07-22T16:10Z,"How can there be 184 seeders but no intelligent comments about if the game works or quality.

Considering the size is only 334mb, surely its a fake ?"

Maybe a botnet? Most of the torrenters here are fucktards who don't even bother reading up on how cracked .exe's, ISO files, ect. works, and can't spell for shit to add to the pile of steaming shit."
,xxtop,2010-09-20T13:58Z,"it's working..
just click the ""empire earth.exe"" file after extracting."
