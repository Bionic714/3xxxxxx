,xushi,2008-07-08T12:06Z,"It looks like these are the same ones as in tvunderground.org.ru . The quality should be good. Finally, I can switch my L&Os to torrent now.. it's taken me years to download a lot of it on edonkey network."
,Genewitch,2008-11-30T00:37Z,"the ~8 gig rips of L&O are standard. most are in HD, that i've seen (780p or whatever), and play well at 1366x768 or whatever.

I'll post after i finish grabbing this (it'll be the 7th season i'll have on dvd-DL) and comment on the bitrate/artifacting."
