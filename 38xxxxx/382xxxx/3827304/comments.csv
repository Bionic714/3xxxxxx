Functions of war are necessary for political, economic, and social progress.

13:30 Report from Iron mountain (Henry Kissenger and David Rockefeller):

?The functions of war are essential to survival of social systems we know today?


 ?A viable political substitute for war must posit a generalized external menace to each society of a nature and degree sufficient to require  the organization and acceptance of political authority?


14:00  Substitutes for war and population control:



A way to control populations without destroying expensive infrastructures, as in past world wars.


The Iron mountain report suggested economic substitutes for war:


A comprehensive social welfare program, and a giant open ended space research program.

An omni-present international police force (united nations), and the global war on terrorism (including a fictitious enemy)


Social control through a modern sophisticated form of slavery.


Ecological bio-terrorism, and human genetic destruction, was also recommended in the report by the  think tank (Henry Kissenger, David Rockefeller).


?A comprehensive program of applied eugenics? Genenetic Culling and Killing.



16:04 Jim Marrs - Corporate control of the state.  Socalism and Facism to benefit corporations. ""National Socialism""  (facism is corporatism).

27:10  Cancer viruses in Vaccines kill slowly and result in costly pharmecueticals and health care (very lucrative and profitable).

GMO's (Genetically Modified Organisms) are another vehicle to make the population sick (and generate business for the medical industry).

28:25   Biological weapons (weaponized viruses) used as cover.

Chemical and biological intoxication allow for plausible deniability.

27:40 Command and control warfare (C2W).


The use of new methods of control may run contrary to American values. The media has been used to change those values; to accept new wars and methods of conducting war.


Biological weapons are key to plausible deniability.


33:00 Medical professionals part of C2W without even knowing it.

This results in a high trauma stress-based training process for medical doctors.

36:00 Control over medical education
summary - how the Pharmecutical industry took control of health care.


37:30  Historical American government medical experimentation on its own people without their knowledge or consent.


Example shown: Rockefeller Institute?s Puerto Rican Cancer experiment. Subjects were injected with cancer viruses.

38:25 Vioxx - Merck - resultant deaths

39:00 History of Fort Detrick and current role.  Fort   was a major biological research facility which created thousands of mass produced bioterrorizing cancer causing viruses and germs for the burgeoning cancer industry.

40:22 Document: List of cancer causing viruses and germs produced at   for the cancer industry.

40:36 The first Polio vaccines produced in contaminated (with the cancer causing SV-40 virus) monk"
