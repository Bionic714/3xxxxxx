And really the only problem is that you have to click fast to get by them two songs he mentioned or they freeze the game:(
other than that pretty great upload.. 
I burned mine with dvd decrypter at lowest speed, and have a ps2slim with fliptop mod, and swapmagic 3.6"
,skunkyg420,2007-10-09T15:43Z,"P.S
Slayer is hard as fuck !!
This game shows you that not everyone is as good as they might have thought.
I learned my leason, but if you play this, you will get much better!! garenteed!!
good stuff!!"
,IamLemmy,2007-10-09T20:27Z,"Is the sync fixed in this version 2.0? Is it true?

I have the version 1.0, and I am spending a lot of time to fix almost all syncs. "
,koheltaja,2007-10-14T12:26Z,"i have litlle problem only two songs work ""see you in hell"" and ""deathrider""  other songs only rolling no chords what to play? "
,skunkyg420,2007-10-17T21:36Z,"pretty sure mosts syncs are fixed...
I havent really had a problem with them...
If there are some there minor!"
,brokenhope8,2007-10-22T01:52Z,Thanks for the comments... See You In Hell and Deathrider work perfectly.  Maybe you need to use a different brand of DVD-R

,baseballdbk23,2007-12-04T18:02Z,"would you like me to fix the problem with the songs that freeze? the problem is probably do to the sample time which is set for the new replaced songs. ill do it if you want me to, just let me know"
,encryptedband,2007-12-14T21:57Z,I spent all the time to download this only to have the ISO be corrupted! Don't bother wasting your time.
,Knyte6426,2008-01-31T22:52Z,"How do you get the ""Unlock All"" code to work on this version. I've tried both NTSC and PAL versions of the code and neither work!"
,DaNtsu,2008-02-23T10:39Z,Damn i want this... Gay that ive got the cheaper ps3  and that i only survive on hard in gh........
,armswat,2008-02-26T19:57Z,just a question... do you need a chipped version of PS2 to make this work? Sad that the chip costs more than the console! :D
,Spraxx8,2008-03-13T23:14Z,"is it good synced?
^^"
,McM1337,2008-03-14T21:59Z,"Brokenhope, I think I know a fix for the songs that freeze. Use gh2ne (Guitar Hero 2 Name Editor, it can be found on ScoreHero) to change the song preview time to 0. That would probably fix it."
,pinkfloyd4,2008-03-20T18:41Z,"¡¡¡¡Dont waste your time, only work 2 songs and also if you dont select a song quick the game freeze!!!!"
,astudillo,2008-08-17T01:16Z,"seed, plz
thnx for all"
,astudillo,2008-08-24T23:52Z,"plz create a HARD mode...
y know all songs but dont play god guitar h.."
,KainAbyss,2008-09-19T10:29Z,"dude, being good in computer programming is not good enough to create a GH game, the notes you put in the songs are off beat and most of the time, unrelated to the song. its like i hear the notes but theyre not the ones im playing, i used to play some of the maiden's song on my guitar and were not even close to that. the setlist is great but you really need help from someone with a minimal musical knowledge to make the game realistic, sorry but you didnt try hard enough"
,RamoneFan63,2008-12-29T19:26Z,"I have a Q, im new at this, can anybody tell me how to  convert and burn to disc when the file has the (3 books shown as the file symbol )  I've only used the windows media file symbol for movies in the past, I use the (ConvertXtoDVD)  Thanks for your help!!!!!  "
