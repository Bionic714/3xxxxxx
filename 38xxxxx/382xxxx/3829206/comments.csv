,howmuch,2007-10-29T08:08Z,There is no keygen..... but thanks for trying. Just an emulator and the roms.
,Shaun3210,2007-11-04T13:40Z,"** Do not download **

Whilst it doesn't contain a keygen, one of the files is named something like 'keygen56' which is the emulator, carries a bad virus. Mcafee stopped it from spreading but couldn't delete. When i looked up the virus it contained, many people had serious problems with this!!"
