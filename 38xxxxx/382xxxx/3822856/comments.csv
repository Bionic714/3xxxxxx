,BBoogie,2007-11-15T18:30Z,"Please you guys that are still left, dont jump of the train until we have at least a few new seeds.
And if u get the download please continue seeding or this torrent will most likely die.
A pity since part 2 is just out here on PB. Would be nice to have both parts :-)

Best regards
