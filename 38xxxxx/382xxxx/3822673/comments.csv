,redhammer,2007-10-10T04:47Z,"yeah well, even worse it is that no subtitles on exactly YOUR movies works even tho i have realplayer, real alternative 1.51, directvobsub, or whatever crappy selfpromoting spyware u want us to install. until I get a firm answer on why ure putting up movies with non working subtitles (How many of us here speak japanese? no one? didnt think so.) (Also, who here got subtitles working? anyone? care to tell us how? nah, didnt think so.) Hence why I keep my right to have a big mouth till opposite proven."
