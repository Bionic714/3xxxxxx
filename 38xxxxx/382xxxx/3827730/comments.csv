,Naregelys,2008-09-22T00:48Z,"It wont do disk 2 for some reason, it says it cant find a file on specified path or disk. it wants me to reinsert disk or specify a new path. (streight from error message)
I do have Daemon tools"
,Naregelys,2008-09-22T00:49Z,how do i fix this?  :(
,dragonzer0,2008-09-30T10:04Z,"I haven't downloaded this game yet but the install is the same for most games. Daemon tools won't work with Vista so I found and use Power ISO which you can get for free.
Open (in this Case) your 3 discs, which will give you 3 separate windows. Make sure all the files are open in each.
1. Click your start.exe It will ask you to unpack in seperate folder. Do so. It will then start installing.
2. When asked to install disc 2, click the .exe file in disc 2 and repeat step 1. It puts the files in the same folder as 1.
3. Disc 3 same as before.
On some games you can just unpack all the discs into one folder to start with and don't have to mess with each disc step. 
If you have a missing file problem just click everything open and you should find it. Then just copy it to the folder everything else is in. If not,  find the clown that uploaded the game and click on him a few dozen times. lol"

,Society99,2008-12-30T17:22Z,"& all you people having problems, in 99% of the cases it's because you're retarded or you're having a junk ass piece of equipment. "
,6gun,2009-01-29T15:38Z,It works if you follow the rules. ItÂ´s simple! And the game is not that bad...
,Recluser,2009-02-02T12:49Z,"need about 2% to finish, and cant seem to find those particular 2% for about 4-5 days. seed pls"
,JoeBPlenty,2009-06-15T08:16Z,"Thanks for the upload Kirk

I downloaded this out of curiosity after seeing it in the store. I expected a decent Action RPG, but this is so horrible I can't even conjure up the words necessary to describe it.

This is my opinion of course, and if you like the game, then I won't say anything about that. However, I strongly recommend that you do not play this game."
