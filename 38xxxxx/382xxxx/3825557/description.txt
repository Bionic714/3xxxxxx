This is as it says, Ragnarok Online 2 Open Beta Client. The interface and some dialog is translated into english for english users. Though, you still need to have the Korean language installed onto your computer in order to get it started. Also, you will need AppLocale.

If you need help on anything with this, I suggest this website:

auraiken.awardspace(dot)com/

just replace the (dot) with an actual dot, wont lemme put the actual website.


It has links to download WinRAR, AppLocale, the RO2 client, the english translation, and a guide on how to create an account.

Please for the love of GOD seed this ok? Let everyone give it a chance lol! Plus, most of the work is done in this download so don't worry, it's patched as well. Only thing you gotta worry about is creating an account haha!




P.S.
I take absolutely no credit for the website I posted. None of it is my work at all. All credit for this site, goes to Auraiken.

Thank you,
