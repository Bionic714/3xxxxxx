===Description===
A Hole as Big as the Grand Canyon

Snapshots for Henry
Canada
Pent and Angie are party people. Tim and Joanne are a hard-working (= boring) couple with a baby. The only thing these couples share is a duplex?until life throws them all a cruel curve. Sex, drugs and rock n' roll are the backdrop to one woman's recollection of her youth, and the fateful decision that unexpectedly touches her life 25 years later. Engaging performances and a refreshingly unapologetic script populate this story of regret and rebellion. Written and directed by Teresa Hannigan. Principal cast: Zoie Palmer, Allan Hawco, Daniel Petronijevic and Molly Jane Atkinson. To learn more about the film, click on www.snapshotsforhenry.ca.

Ten Feet Tall
Australia

Directed by Aaron Wilson and based on the song of the same name by Australian singer/songwriter Pete Murray. Principal cast: Samuel Johnson, Michael Veitch and Georgia Van Cuylenburg.

Sorry, there are a couple glitches. These sort of things happen with OTA.

Don't bitch about the ads. They're there for a reason.
