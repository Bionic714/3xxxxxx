A experimental live cd that can boot in as little a 8 seconds. I have booted on a 1.5g,512r laptop in 11.5 sec and be online with Firefox. Of course it is very light wieght like Damn Small Linux or Puppy Linux. But does not have all of the features of those or the heavy wieghts like Knoppix,Kanotix or Mandriva One. Recommended for Linux freaks like myself not the newbie . Enjoy
