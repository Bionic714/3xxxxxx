San tiao ren / Away with words / Kujaku (1999)

Directed by Christopher Doyle.



Christopher Doyle's first film is not entirely what you'd expect. Visually stunning it is, but underneath the surface a very personal and heartfelt film transpires. That is, if you can get past the dizzy, frantic, drunken filmmaking that Doyle is famous for. Maybe beer will help.
