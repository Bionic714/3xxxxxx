Contrary to popular myth and politically correct dogma, the earth is getting warmer, not because of your SUV but because of a nuclear furnace deep within our Earth.

The Earth goes through these warming cycles every one hundred and fifty thousand years.

We are currently in one of those inter-glacial warm periods.  These warm periods (we call the current one Global Warming) last from ten to twenty thousand years.  We are in the eighteen thousandth year of our current warm period.  We may be overdue for an ice age.

Fear not.  There is a simple solution and it doesn√¢??t involve scrapping your SUV or, strapping solar panels onto your roof, setting up a windmill in your back yard or converting edible grains into alcohol.

Lithuania, that little country up in the Baltic where my grandparents were born, has already solved the problem without any apparent problems.
