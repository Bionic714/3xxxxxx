Two enemy drug lords from different sides of the bay area in California are at war over the huge turf. Salvador Castro, the Oakland drug lord, was just released from prison and will let nothing get in the way of the empire he built with younger brother Richard. The streets get crazy when San Francisco drug lord, Darryl, begins to take more control over the Oakland area. Will Castro ever regain full control of his drug business? If two probing detectives and a revenge-bent loner have anything to do with it, he won't.
