,speedypear,2007-10-04T08:04Z,"Thanks for downloading my file everyone. It's my first torrent! I'm just really glad people are able to download from me, I've had this symbol that says ""no incoming connections"" on my BitTorrent forever...I thought my router was preventing everyone from dl-ing my stuff.

I ripped the DVD with the english subs turned on, so you shouldn't have any trouble seeing them if you just burn the avi onto a DVD-r. Long live Pirate Bay!!!"
,speedypear,2007-10-07T07:34Z,Has anyone successfully downloaded the whole movie? I'm sorry about the slow download speeds; my idiot router is giving me grief...I have no open ports. I just don't understand why it says there are 4 seeders but 0 downloaders?
,metoden39,2007-10-15T08:47Z,plzz seed :D i really wanna se the movie :)
,metoden39,2007-10-15T13:14Z,i succefully downloaded the movie but there is no sound!!!
,speedypear,2007-10-16T00:06Z,"Really? I had no problems with the sound...I've burned the avi onto a DVD+R and it plays fine in my divx-compatible DVD player. You probably need some kind of AC3 codec, or trying using VLC player to view it - that's always worked for me. Sorry, I don't know much about codecs, but most likely you're missing one. 

Does anybody know what kind of wire I need to connect my Windows XP laptop to my television, so that I can play a movie using VLC player on the computer, while watching it on the big TV? 

I'm sick of burning DVDs only to have people destroy them. Thanks!!!"
,lostprophyt,2007-10-16T13:50Z,"Google for GOM Player. So far, it's the best I've found for playing most of what you find on TPB, and handles subtitle files pretty well from the files I've tried.

Hell, I've got it running to my TV, sound and all. Never an issue. Hope it works for you guys."
,lostprophyt,2007-10-16T13:54Z,"speedybear - It depends on your video hardware. VGA is the standard most monitors use (although DVI is quickly taking over), so most times, you'll need to have what's known as an ""S-Video"" port. Kind of looks like a ps/2 (keyboard/mouse) port, really.

I have an old ATI Rage Legacy card with S-Video out, and I'm currently entertaining my 9 month old son with season after season of Ranma on the big TV.

Know what? Just Google my username. I'm sure you'll find some way to contact me, and I'll explain the whole deal. Meantime, thanks for seeding this flick, I love Miyazaki movies. I'll keep my seed active once I have it for as long as I have uptime :D"
,yumenokoyume,2007-11-02T18:09Z,I wana know if this movie has a removable subtitles. I want to have this movie redubbed in our language.

Congratulations on your first torrent. 
Regarding your lack of incoming connections, have you enabled port forwarding on your router? Check this site:
http://portforward.com/
If you haven't done so already, you'll notice a dramatic increase in the performance of your torrent downloads. Good luck."
,blair906,2008-07-17T02:16Z,"umm is it just me, or does this movie suddenly change at the end.  its as if theres no ending, it just ends with them talking with the press.  Then the singers and actors are speaking spanish.  its like you spliced on the spanish ending."
,blair906,2008-07-17T02:17Z,"i forgot to mention everything before that was perfect.  the resolution, voice syncing, overall quality was perfect.  .srt files could be nice instead of hardcoded subs but overall good dl."
,piratefans,2008-09-11T17:24Z,"thanks again for your work, greatttt "
,Devil_Jin_KaZama,2008-10-04T11:27Z,"i hope everything it will be good with the movie(picture,sound,subs). I really like hayao miyazaki's films. Thank you!"
,Maguel,2008-10-05T12:51Z,WOOT! Touchdown ^(O.O)^
,canthisreallybetheend,2008-10-31T23:59Z,"Overall great quality and no problems, thanks! - But I was sort of confused by the somewhat abrupt (japanese/english) ending and sudden Spanish as well?"
,owlhighness,2009-01-06T10:19Z,"thanks!!! everything I need, i easily can find here!!!!! ur best! i didnt think that pirat bay will have this, Studio Ghibli, but ur best!!!!"

,Honkmeister,2009-08-09T12:33Z,"if you have problem with the sound in VLC, just change from 5.1 to stereo or one of the other settings and sound will come"
,talassa,2009-10-03T16:04Z,"Why are the ending credits and last dialogue in spanish language? - i didnÂ´t get it!
Otherwise a good file"
,ashikojim,2011-07-12T19:44Z,350kb/s great speed thanks!!! Will comment after download on quality!!
