(Also, who here got subtitles working? anyone? care to tell us how? nah, didnt think so.) Hence why I keep my right to have a big mouth till opposite proven."

Cantonese rendition of her name aside, spare us any praise of Zhang Ziyi -- those gyrations of hers are reminiscent of a macaque in heat.

And redhammer if you can't tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese, you oughta change that handle to ""redneck"". Thanks for the warning, though."
,NightHuntress,2008-05-31T08:14Z,"first of all redhammer, indeed if u can't tell the difference between chinese and japanese maybe you should cancel your right of having a big mouth. second, having the subtitles working is easy. just get a player that supports subtitles. my powerdvd player 6 did play them but i can work em with my version 8 so i use jetaudio 7. lastly, all u gotta do is to use ur search engine for some subtitle website, download the .srt file, rename it exactly as ur movie file is and put it in the same directory as ur movie. so u see, to make most of the shits go the right way you don't need a big mouth just a little brain. here's a link for a subtitle: http://www.opensubtitles.com/en/search/imdbid-190332/sublanguageid-eng"
