,thefeds,2007-10-07T12:10Z,Don't forget I hate Leechers who don't seed after. Maybe I should stop posting if no one is going to share
,maddoorsfan,2008-03-02T13:49Z,thanks for this thefeds its appreciated.
,Catee,2008-03-04T08:43Z,I'd be glad to seed this for a while if someone can seed me for a bit first to finish me off....;o)  Currently there are over a dozen of us hanging and no seeds.  Many thanks!
,Catee,2008-03-13T20:24Z,"It's weird that here only 3 leechers are showing, while in my Azureus it is showing 14!  Anyway, I have seeded this to a ratio of 1:5 and I will continue to help thefeds seed this for another week or so (through 3/20) - then it's ixnay on my end.  So if you want this torrent, now is a good time to get it!

Cheers!"
