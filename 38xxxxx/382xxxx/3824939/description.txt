Compelling drama of the discovery of the AIDS virus. From the early days in 1978 when numerous San Francisco gays began dying from unknown causes, to the identification of the HIV virus. Focuses on how scientists, doctors, politicians and the gay community reacted to this new threat. Surprisingly less depressing and sentimental than many other films about this period. Richard Gere and a great number of other well-established actors volunteered to star in this film to show their support, see the list on imdb. This is not my rip, picture quality is OK, stereo sound really good.
