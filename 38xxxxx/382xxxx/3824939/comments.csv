[V],Kuthumi,2008-05-05T21:27Z,"I first recorded this film from television on AIDS day December 1, 1997. Then I found it at 
gay-torrents dot net, and later this better version from another torrent site."

,perfecto1,2010-01-07T23:51Z,"Great movie/doc with a powerful message, that's why I ripped it.  Someone else took Perfecto, so I had to go with Perfecto1, good luck with stealing my name ass....  This was ripped long ago with ancient painful methods, so my apologies for the video/audio compromise, did my best with the methods available at the time.  Still excellent, and the message is conveyed, my original purpose after all.   ;0)"
,dee8910,2012-05-26T02:29Z,This is a great movie/documentary film. When it came out I was very young maybe around 13 or 14 years old but I understood the movie knew what was happening and even at that age I could not believe how the government was handling the situation and how other agency's were too. It's very sad to see all the people we lost famous and none famous all within the same years. Hands down a classic movie with a powerful message.
