Episode : ?Lost Souls? (Sept 26, 2007)

I wasn?t sure what to call it. On the episode they call it the season premiere, so one would think it would be season 4 episode 1.
shows it as season 3 episode 13 (in the spring they showed ?Manson Murders? as episode 13)

Scifi.com also lists it under season 3

So it is probably season 3 episode 13, but because I already have ?Manson Murders? as episode 13, I?ve called this S03E14
