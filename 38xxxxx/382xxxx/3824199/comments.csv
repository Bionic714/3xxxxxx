,robertorex,2007-09-30T11:23Z,yeah... let's all of us go and download a new program to read comics on our pc's... what? what's that? already got a working one?... since 2002? cbr what? huh...
,fluffy_wawa,2007-09-30T19:01Z,"well. it's a matter of space and bandwidth - DjVu files are much smaller than PDF or CBR (rar archives). i won't be preaching about how great DjVu is - just read wikipedia article:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu

if you want to fit all 100 issues of 100 bullets on one CD - the only solution is DjVu.

i know it's hard to change the old habits."
,fluffy_wawa,2007-09-30T19:05Z,"one more thing - for all the leachers: i re-released this torrent in proper format:

sorry for inconvenience. :)"
