Tactic Records was established in the beginning of    
2007, by Leon Gossler aka Tactic Mind.                    
Leon's years of activity, strong passion to the art          
of music, and extensive knowledge in the formation of    
Trance beats lead him to the only natural place of      
forming a label.                                        
It took 2 long years for the official formation of      
Tactic Records, years were Leon turned the world        
upside-down seeking new innovative talents which are      
distend, with the right management, to take over the      
dance floor by storm. Tactic Records presents fresh,        
pumping, innovative and intelligent sound for the        
dance floor.                                            
Leon, known for his exquisite taste in music, decided        
to embark on this journey with the desire to            
establish a fresh new platform for multi-talented      
artists.                                                  
'Massive Passive' CD includes 9 previously unreleased        
hits, produced by Tactic Records hand picked dream      
team including Toxical, Phobia, Unique and Tactic        
Mind.                                                    
This Massive compilation release features also a        
track by Insomnia, collaboration between Tactic Mind    
and Ultravoice, and a remix to Bizzare Contact Vs.        
Ultravoice track, by Tactic Mind.                        
Massive Passive is one of those rare compilation        
releases which just sits perfectly no matter where it    
is presented.                                            
Tactic Mind has laid down its mantra!                    
We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying.
MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands !!
You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout.
Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much!
Our releases are for scene internal use so
KEEP THEM OFF P2P AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES!!
So much for now ...
meet ya @ the next party ... somewhere.
MYCEL - sending lamers to /dev/null since 2003
We bow our heads to our old friends.    
Deep respect to you!              
Also we would like to greet all of the      
still alive quality scenegroups/sceners!    
Ascii done with love to my lil d3vil.
