*** This program is For Overclocking freaks ***

Today's computers are not perfect.  Even brand new systems from major
manufacturers can have hidden flaws.  If any of several key components such
as CPU, memory, cooling, etc. are not up to spec, it can lead to incorrect
calculations and/or unexplained system crashes.

Overclocking is the practice of increasing the speed of the CPU and/or
memory to make a machine faster at little cost.  Typically, overclocking
involves pushing a machine past its limits and then backing off just a
little bit.

For these reasons, both non-overclockers and overclockers need programs
that test the stability of their computers.  This is done by running
programs that put a heavy load on the computer.  Though not originally
designed for this purpose, this program is one of a few programs that
are excellent at stress testing a computer.
