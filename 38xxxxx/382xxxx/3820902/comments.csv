,antil0ck,2007-09-27T21:25Z,"No subs guys and gals. This is a VHS to DVD converted. Since this movie never was released onto DVD, I took the liberty to do this for all of you. once downloaded, Just use your fav DVD burning program to make a dvd. 

Enjoy!

However, my DVD player could not play it, it says ""No disc"" on the Panasonic DVD player display. I burnt the video_ts folder on the DVD-R disc with all the files - perhaps I did something wrong? Anyway, I let my PC do the playback instead."
,nearadyn,2007-10-09T04:23Z,Thanks so much! My VHS copy that I recorded from TV in the 80's is nearly worn out. This is an awesome movie. Let's keep seeding and keep this torrent alive!

You have to use nero to burn a DVD video. Did you just burn the files onto a DVD?
