,SeriousGus,2008-04-27T20:50Z,"I'v tried two versions of Bioshock now. after installing the game and starting it up i see the planecrash and I go into the pod and go down to Rapture from the lighthouse.

Then I get to this loading screen and the game shuts down.

Anyone know how i work around this so I can play the game?"
,kintaro.0e,2008-05-03T22:10Z,"don't dl this release, fairlight crack has been nuked, and their crackfix was nuked cause they couldn't break the securom, that's why it's so buggy. if you want a working copy get the lolcats version, securom is still there but it's emulated and working right."
