Whatsup with the gay bitcomet padding files? The padding files added about 200mb to the torrent."

,hybrid90,2008-07-28T14:23Z,"If you like Eisbrecher, you'll probably like Megaherz, which some of Eisbrecher's members used to play in. Their last album with Alexx Wesselsky on vocals (Herzwerk II) is the most similar to Eisbrecher's style. 
1997-2004: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4303291/Megaherz_collection . 
New album (Heuchler): http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4318436"
,gelbherz,2008-08-26T06:45Z,"Danke! Ich liebe Eisbrecher!
I'm newish in this type of music, but it's my favorite stuff in long time. Wish I'd discovered it earlier. Also try these great german bands:
Wumpscut, Das Ich, And One, Oomph, KMFDM. I really love wumpscut, and like some of the other band's stuff too, not all. Just some ideas..."
,dumdi,2008-12-06T22:06Z,"thx!!

it is great that german music is popular in other countries . (i am from austria )

Mfg Elrohir"
,reaktor333,2009-04-01T17:54Z,"I adore Esibrecher, will you please make some FLAC files of these albums. This music deserves best audio quality.

I got cd quality of Leider single, and must say it sounds much better than suspicious .mp3s.

There was this guy with FLACs of Antikoerper and Eisbrecher albums, bun suddenly the guy vanished, and left us with 22% of the torrents.

Please FLAC.

p.s I love deutche music, I'm from R. Macedonia"
