,The Hawk,2010-06-17T07:07Z,"Doesn't work properly on XP Pro.  It will not recognize mapped drives.  Gives ""530 Not logged in, home directory does not exist"" It will recognize a URI, but then it will not access anything in it.  

Can only be used on local drives.  Works fine then.  If you try to use it on a network share, forget it!!

Probably a limitation of Serv-U."
