,athenry,2007-09-30T06:43Z,"Oh, and do you have a copy of ""The Wire Tapes Vol. 1""  -- the cover album?
I really want to hear his version of ""Better"" by Regina Spektor."
,jmyche8986,2007-09-30T09:08Z,thanks again! hope this works now. =)
,rynosenses,2007-10-02T03:53Z,"this is the real deal, except no bonus track (who gives a hoot anyways, its dashboard)
great quality, for any volume."
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-10-02T16:50Z,"Tracks 14, 15 & 16 are bonus tracks as they were not released on the original CD"
,jsvec69,2007-10-04T02:43Z,the sound quality of this was very bad...was this an online rip?
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-10-04T14:16Z,"You need to check your system jsvec69, this is direct from CD ripped and mastered with Soundbooth @ a bit rate of 320kbps for CD quality. The bonus tracks are unreleased studio studio outtakes and have a less clean sound."
,wrxeatworld,2007-10-05T10:38Z,thanks for the hard work
,pine22,2007-10-07T10:38Z,"thanks, nice rip fin :)"
,jonmacd,2007-10-09T13:08Z,theres something wrong with this rip... and it is NOT my hardware.. my macbook pro and bose triports work flawlessly... but this torrent is not good quality
,sheepshirts,2007-10-09T19:22Z,This really is a terrible rip.  The audio is very fuzzy.  This is not a hardware issue.
,PhantomW,2007-10-14T12:54Z,I'm having bad sound too..
,AntiochOG,2007-10-16T03:51Z,I've only had a chance to listen to this on my laptop so far but the audio sounds alright to me.
,RyanD124,2007-11-10T22:16Z,use peerguardian people. people are all over this torrent
,alexj2,2007-11-22T20:15Z,yeh i seem 2 have the same problem its at high quality but still crackling as if its very slow quality any idea's?
,nutbrowne,2007-12-03T04:43Z,"I found the sound quality is excellent for all the songs, not sure why others are having problems. Thanks FiNsTerc, nice upload!"
,stoerfrequenz,2007-12-09T04:51Z,"might just be software issues. i've tried a lot of players, and some just have better sound than others. and with different songs a ""worse"" player might do better than a ""good"" one."
,riccogrosse,2008-05-08T19:00Z,Thanks...
,SkywalkerYanni,2008-11-19T03:08Z,"Great Upload and amazing Quality,

www.skywalkersindiemusicreview.blogspot.com "
,esrar_zakir,2010-02-25T14:20Z,"Wat the Fk?!! Crappy quality...seems like an online rip...fuzzy...the bonus tracks are much worse,such a waste of time...not a hardware issue...and FiNsTeRc being a trusted uploader, I didnt expect this. Skip this one guys. Those who are saying that this is great quality, dont knw shit about quality"
