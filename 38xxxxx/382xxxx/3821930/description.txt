ok, u guys, windows shutdown there mui pack on vista 64 ultimate
this means if you install it than u dont have the language packs no more
with this update from 139 mb you will be able to install the complete mui pack
back to vista 64 bit

how does it works very simple:

1) install program and run it

2) you will not see any conformation about its finished

3) wait untill your harddrive stop writing just check the HDD light

4) update vista and u will see the mui pack installed and its fully working

in total 18 languages are in this pack

have fun the JOKER.
