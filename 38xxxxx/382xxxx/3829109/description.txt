v6.0c (2006.10.27)
* Fixed a problem that could cause a hang when AASÂ¡Â¯s Lounge Lizard 3
is opened and an ACID project is autosaved.
* Default patch settings are not applied to VSTi soft synths when new
tracks are added to a project.
* Fixed a bug so MP3s with Unicode ID3 tag information no longer cause
problems with track names.
* A drawing issue has been resolved involving drum maps with note data
outside their drum map parameters.
* Fixed a problem that could cause a crash when deleting a bus from a
5.1 surround sound project.
* Fixed a variety of issues with the Piano Roll Editor caused by
dragging files from the Explorer to the ACID timeline.
* Fixed a bug so that MIDI notes selected using the in inline editing
mode will play as displayed while loops are being previewed.
* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when rendering to a new track
using M-Audio Ozone with a USB connection.
* In 5.1 surround mode, when a track is routed to a bus, the Surround
Master now receives the input monitoring signal.
* You can now pan tracks that are routed to a bus in stereo and 5.1
surround modes.
* Fixed a bug so bus levels are preserved after selecting Undo after a
bus has been deleted.
* Fixed a bug that grayed out VSTi sub-busses when the main bus was
muted.
* Fixed a bug that caused audio to stutter or drop out entirely during
playback after UAD-1 effects had been added to the project.
* Fixed a bug so that busses are renamed to their default names when a
new project with busses is opened using ACIDÂ¡Â¯s default settings.
* Various improvements have been made for using ACID as a ReWire
device.
* Fixed various VSTi window sizing issues.
* Added program change maps for the Korg Karma, Korg Triton rack
(system version 1.52), and E-mu Planet Earth.
* Resolved an issue so audio and MIDI ports remain open when focus is
lost and the Preferences pane is open.
* You can now undo a key change to a MIDI clip.
* Fixed a bug that could cause ACID to hang when adding keyframes to
5.1 surround projects.
* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when you import MIDI files with
no note data into your project.
* Fixed a bug that prevented NI Akoustik Piano, E-mu Emulator X, and
Proteus X from loading properly.
* Resolved two issues regarding undoing MIDI program changes:
  -Undoing a MIDI program change now updates MIDI drum maps with the
proper settings.
  -Undoing a MIDI program change now updates MIDI devices or soft
synths with the proper settings.
* Fixed a bug that caused audio glitches at the start of playback in a
project with two MIDI tracks routed to a DLS soft synth.
* Fixed a problem with incorrect event clips caused by removing unused
clips and then selecting Undo.
* Resolved an issue so that you have the option of choosing any audio
editor that is configured and not just the first one listed under the
Tools menu.
* Implemented key support for MIDI clips. You can set a MIDI clip's
key on the Clip Pool tab of the MIDI Track Properties window. A clip's
key affects playback and now notes are drawn in events.
  -When you create a new MIDI clip, the key is set to None.
  -When you open a MIDI file, ACID will set the clip's key based on
the MIDI file. If a clip contains key changes, only the first is used.
  -When you open a MIDI file as a project, the ACID project key is
updated to match the MIDI file.
  -When a clip's key is set, the project key and key change markers
are applied to MIDI clips. MIDI notes in events are drawn as WYSIWYH
   (what you see is what you hear).
* Implemented various optimizations for memory usage and performance.
* Improved performance for ASIO drivers that do not notify host
applications of buffer-size changes.
* Improved handling for MIDI track, clip, and event pitch-shifting.
* Clip names in the Clip Pool window are now updated when clips are
saved to new file names.
* Fixed a bug that prevented arming multiple MIDI tracks for
recording.
* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when renaming an unnamed clip
in the Clip Pool.
* Fixed a problem that could cause MIDI clips to drop notes during
looped playback.
* An issue has been resolved that prevented FXPansion BFD MIDI files
from being added to the ACID timeline.
* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when changing the channel of a
track routed to a ReWire device.
* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when closing Reason when in use
by tracks in your ACID project.
* Fixed a problem that could cause a crash when playing back with
certain audio plug-ins (including Antares Filter and Sony Pitch
Shift).
* Fixed a problem that could cause a crash or hang when using the Undo
command after MIDI step recording.
* Fixed a problem that could cause a hang when arming an audio track
for recording while recording MIDI data.
* Fixed a problem that could cause NRPN and RPN MIDI data sent to the
DLS soft synth to respond incorrectly to pitch bend or controller
data.
* Fixed a bug that could cause dropouts when routing a multichannel
VSTi's outputs to a bus other than the Master bus.
* Fixed a bug that could cause dropouts or timing irregularities when
routing a multichannel VSTi to a non-in-place plug-in (such as Time
Stretch, Pitch-Shift without preserving duration, and some Vibrato
settings).
* Fixed a problem that could cause the MIDI Step Record dialog to
remain active after canceling step recording.
