Conceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original:
Improvements? Advancements? I do not know wether I would call this an advancement or improvement over the original. In my opinion the color scheme of the original was never really taken to use properly, creating a relatively fainted colour on occasion. I believe that as far as the colour scheme goes, this edit is superior. However, I am something of a b&w fan anyhow, so I suppose that doesnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t matter much. You decide for yourself is this worse or better than the original.
