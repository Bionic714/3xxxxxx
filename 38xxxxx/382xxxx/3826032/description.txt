Release Notes 
Dance N Dust Records is proud to present the
2nd full-length album from the Australian duo
Decoy!
The members in Decoy are Ian Chaplin and
Philip Rex - two talented musicians with a
rich musical background which clearly shines
through in their live-performances, including
Ian on soprano sax and Philip on acoustic
bass. They got infected by the psytrance
scene 8 years ago, and have since then made
music under the name Decoy, with several
appearances on festivals like Earthcore,
Rainbow Serpent and Earthdance and releases
on labels like Digital Structures, Plusquam,
Green Ant, Yellow Sunshine Explosion and
Dance N Dust Records. Apart from their
project Decoy, they have also collaborated
with Son Kite's sideproject Minilogue.
The new album Push Button Pony is following
the debut album 'Not Responding To Light' -
this time with even phatter production,
deeper tribal grooves, more elements from the
progressive house scene and even more
blissful dance floor moments, but still with
Decoys unique progressive sound, fusing
traditional instruments with infectious
psychedelic trance grooves and a good amount
of funk.
Important Notice
