PUSCIFER, the side project of TOOL frontman Maynard James Keenan, is preparing to film a video for the song "Queen B". The clip is expected by late September.

"Queen B" is the first single from PUSCIFER's debut album, "V Is for Vagina", due October 30 via Puscifer Entertainment. Other songs set to appear on the album include a cover of the CIRCLE JERKS' "World Up My Ass", "Dojo" and "Cuntry Boner".

"This is absolutely just put-it-on-and-move-your-butt -and-get-completely-out-of-your-head music," Keenan recently told MTV.com about the record. "This is purely body candy. It's meant to make you feel like I feel when I hear JAMES BROWN, when I hear some old JACKSON 5 or or ARETHA [FRANKLIN]. It's just that good feeling Ã¢?? music that makes you feel good. There's no math. Nothing wrong with math, but sometimes, it can be exhausting to be that forced, that focused. I'm a big KING CRIMSON fan, but only when I have the energy to be. Sometimes I just want to hear GNARLS BARKLEY."

PUSCIFER is comprised of a revolving door of contributors, including multi-instrumentalist Danny Lohner; songstress Lisa Germano; TELEFON TEL AVIV's Joshua Eustis; Jonny Polonsky; PRIMUS' Tim Alexander; model Milla Jovovich; TOOL guitar tech Matt Mitchell; and dark ambient artist Lustmord.

Keenan intends to release PUSCIFER's debut album without the backing of a major label. But while he'll fund the album's release in the U.S., he'll still need to license the material out for international distribution.
