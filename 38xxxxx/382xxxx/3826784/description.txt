Repacked with ARM7 fix, which means it'll at least work with the DS-X now.
Should help some noobs out that can't patch maybe...

BTW, I'm not a scene kid but thanks for getting the clean dump out there. ya'll work fast. Like 30min after my initial dump iND repacked and uploaded it. but where's the credits yo? :P
