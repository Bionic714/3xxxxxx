It'll start up saying your Wi-Fi is corrupt, something else and finally show you a ""New Game"" and a game that seems to have a million hearts.  Delete it, restart, and everything should be good.  omg that took forever to figure out.

,ryuku32,2007-10-02T06:17Z,"seems that if you get the ""Saving EEPROM"" message when you boot the DS-X, then Zelda will hang at a white screen.  Restart, you won't get ""Saving EEPROM"" and it'll start successfully then. DS-X firmware is lame. I'm selling mine, and my copy of Zelda, for an R4 and SD card. ;)"
