,sopsop07,2008-04-03T20:44Z,"hi folks....to all who do not know how to make skin and effects or even samples to work, here my step by step procedure..1st is the skin..the skin, effects and samples folder is not located where the vdj you installed...or you cant locate with the default path c:/program files/ virtual dj.....dont create any folder where vdj you have installed.....nor go to my documents, locate the folder name virtual dj, open that folder,,,there are many sub folder one is the skin,sampler and plugins,,simply copy the skin from the virtual dj folder or vdj installer,,same as sampler,,but the effects open the plugin folder here you can see sound effect video effect and other....simply copy the effects folder as what you did on the skin folder...hope u get it....."
