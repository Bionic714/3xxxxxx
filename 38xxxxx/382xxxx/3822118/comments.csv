I appreciate you took the time to collect and upload this.

For people who love this, there is a second torrent, ""Manly P. Hall, Complete Lecture Series - Part 2"". Contains another 2.5 gig of his remaining lectures.
It's not here yet, but you can find it on isohunt for example."

Those interested in the real books of his check out the Philosophical Research Society: http://prs.org/index.html I highly recommend the Secret Teachings of All Ages in hardcover, you won't be disappointed!"
