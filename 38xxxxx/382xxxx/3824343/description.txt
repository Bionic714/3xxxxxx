Electronic Devices Conventional Current Version 7th Edition

by Thomas L. Floyd

This seventh edition of Electronic Devices has been carefully revised and some important new
topics have been added. Several recommendations from reviewers and current users have been
incorporated to make this edition better. A comprehensive coverage of electronic devices and
circuits, including troubleshooting and System Applications, is provided. Chapters 1 through
11 are essentially devoted to fundamental discrete devices and circuits. Chapters 12through 18
primarily cover linear integrated circuits. Chapter 19 is a new chapter that is completely devoted
to programmable analog devices. Data sheets are introduced in certain areas to provide a practial
connection with actual devices. Extensive exercises and problems using Multisim" circuit
simulation are designed to help students verify circuit theory and develop troubleshooting and
measurement skills. Referenced Multisim circuit files are on the CD packaged with this book.
