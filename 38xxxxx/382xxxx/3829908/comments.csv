,MaineEvent,2009-06-25T23:02Z,"Garbage....Includes ""rare"" songs that arent Blink 182... this retard isn't a real fan get fucked freaks_r_us"
,mc_homes,2009-08-16T07:21Z,"@maineevent - dude don't talk shit.  this torrent has a lot of needless stuff and repeats...but what it does have it gold.  This is all of their demos, all cds, all singles imports and b sides.  Everything you need pre break up.

@jigsaw89 - the torrent has a lot of duplicate songs.  listen to the different versions of a few songs and you will see wut i mean.  And those online songs are a lot of needless crap.  there are a few songs pieced together from a loop.  i dont get the point..."
