Holly Cole is my favourite contemporary jazz performer, but there's not too much of her material to be found as torrents so I thought I'd upload everything I have of her (which is just about everything.  Only a few rarities missing).

Quality is 192 > 256kbs, generally encoded with Lame.

These will be my first uploads ever, so try to take it easy if things go pear shaped mkay?

Oh btw - I AM seeding, regardless of what you may be thinking or seeing.
