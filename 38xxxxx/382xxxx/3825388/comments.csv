,Morphicon,2007-12-09T02:14Z,Btw you can buy them at www.candyrat.com - his record label.

,Wile E,2008-03-09T21:20Z,This guy is amazing. I plan to buy all of his albums as soon as I can afford it.
,eat3281,2008-05-14T00:41Z,"Better than buying the album - go to his shows if you can.  

I'm sorry, but selling albums is just simply not a great way to make money anymore.  People have gotten too used to free music.  People my age and younger simply do not buy music.  But guess what?  We go to concerts, and we go to cinemas to watch movies.  This is because the environment and experience of a live show or a cinema is much better than the 1-dimensional experience of a recorded album or a DVD."
