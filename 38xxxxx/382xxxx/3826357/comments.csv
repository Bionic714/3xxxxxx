,roeljaja,2007-10-22T15:57Z,"the keygen is in  the bottom .rar file
but I also get 'insert disc'
how do I just start the program?"
,jubbjubb,2007-11-07T16:17Z,"Aaarggh!

Installed and tried it. I can't get it to work.

I keep getting an error when trying to load my tracks from reason 3.

""File system object not found

The Operation could not be completed because the file system object was not found.""

I've googled it but it seems like no one experienced it with Reason 4. They had the same problem with Reason 2 but it was fixed shortly after in an update.

Anyone else had this error?"

,assmblg09,2007-12-13T22:45Z,"hey everyone, i have mac osx and i was having similar problems with a lot of folks. i extracted the rar file, used toast to make a disc image of the reason.iso, then i mounted it, tried to copy it to my apps, then when i ran it from my apps, it asked me for the DVD!

okay problem solved:
this may not work for everyone but it worked for me and remember i have osx.
follow these steps:
1.)extract the .rar file
2.)simply change the .iso file extension to .dmg in Get info
3.)Use toast to mount directly (from the utilities toolbar) the .dmg file you just made
4.)Move Reason folder to your apps
5.)THEN try running Reason from your apps folder and you will not be prompted for the DVD! 

for some reason these steps worked perfectly for me. i think it was because i directly changed the file extension and/or mounting the .iso or .dmg DIRECTLY as opposed to making a DISC IMAGE. Hopefully this helps!"
,Belarionknight,2008-01-04T10:09Z,how to use keygen.exe once extracted?
,bowseroffun,2008-01-20T01:21Z,PPL In order to most likely get this to work properly like HALO PC did in the crack on here U WILL NEED to get DAEMON tools or alcohol 120% and find somewhere a working CD .img .ISO .MDS and other types of CD IMAGES and mount them with DT and A120%  it will then tell REASON there IS A CD of of it in  a fake J drive  or other drive letter thats how i get my cracked halo PC/CE working without a CD and it runs fine :)
,albinoz,2008-01-25T15:30Z,"for the 4.01 ?

because this version crash a lot?"
,DjMikeyD,2008-02-20T02:37Z,"i'm running windows vista, i'm new to this whole torrent thing, but i finally figured out how to install Reason 4 after downloading this torrent...

but now i'm at a dead end

however everytime i click on the Reason 4 icon i get an ""Insert DVD"" pop up

i have no idea what to do next in order to open up and actually use the program

if some one can give me a easy to understand step by step of what i have to do i would greatly apperciate it! "
,eraeya,2008-03-11T18:10Z,"I know I'm the so maniest sucker who's got trouble getting this booted but still :p

I got the .iso and tried to mount it with Toast but that gives an error notice (49152). Burning on disc doesn't work either. Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?

,doudzzzz,2008-05-06T16:29Z,"hello evry one. im new here, hope u guys can help me. ive started dowloading the torrent, but i realize that it contains at least 40 files!! how im i supose to mount a disk image? im i supose to mount all the files in a same disk? some one help plz?"
,Jad-B,2008-05-14T01:12Z,"Right, so i have seen a number of comments on asking why they cant get things to work. I'm going to tell the way i got thing going. I'll try and dumb it down a bit for you. I will be showing you how to install it with out burning to a disk. 
All this in 10 simple steps....

(PLEASE NOTE - PC ONLY)


Here goes:
1) Download the Torrent and all files. 

2) Once downloaded all files goto where you downloaded the files; open the folder ""air-reason4"" (the first one in the list) and make sure you have a program to unzip. I used ""WinRAR"" which i got for free, just Google it.

3) Next click and open the file named ""Reason 4.iso"". I opened this file with a program called ""PowerISO"" another free software, Google again. (note: this will take some time so please bare with it)

4) Click and run the ""Install Reason.exe"" and go through the setup to install Reason onto your computer, or where ever you want.

5) Once install is complete. Go back to your unzipped file ""air-reason4"" (the first one in the list of downloaded files) which had ""Reason 4.iso"" in. Highlight the ""Reason 4.iso"" and click ""Extract to..."" (i'm using ""WinRAR""), put this file somewhere on your computer.

6) Now open up ""PowerISO Virtual Drive Manager"" and a little icon of a CD should come up next to the clock on the bottom right of your screen. Right click the icon, select ""Mount Image to Drive"" and find were you extracted ""Reason 4.iso"" and open that.

7) Now that is done, your computer is now thinking it has a CD Drive with the CD files in, but all it is doing is reading it from where you extracted it too. So open up Reason 4 (there should be an icon on your desktop) and then hit ""Agree""

8) At this point it might ask you to input the Reason disk, if so go back a few steps and start again. If not it will install the Reason file (thinking there is a cd in your computer) and you should be alright.

9) Now it will ask you for a details (name and so on) so for this just put in some stars *** or anything you want. It will also ask you for a code which goes in the last box out of the three. You will need to open the file ""air-reason4kgn"" which should be with all the downloaded file. Open that and click ""KEYGEN.EXE"". It should come up with Reason V4.0x, if not find that and hit Generate. Next copy and past that code into the third box where you put your details in, and you should be sorted.

10) You should have a working copy of Reason now. If it asks you to register just register later, its a waste of time in my opinion. Apart from that you should have setting with in Reason to sort out, but i think you would be smart enough to work them out.

THAT'S IT!!!
(if you are having any more problems, i don't see where you could be going wrong, dumb ass :P)"

,jezmears,2008-07-20T20:09Z,"Can someboby please help me ! ! ! i have tried useing ""vuze"" and ""u-torrent"" to down load these files and they are either not downlowding or it keeps going from 65 days to 1 year and 345 days to down load ? ? ? i have tried to run a NAT/Server port test and it says that my computer refused ?
Im running XP SP 2 and have a  100.0 Mbps conection. I was wondering if there is anybody who already has this program (reason 4) if they would share it with me using the msn skydrive ? i would obviously give you my skydrive address so you know im not gonna do any of that hacking . and obviously i will have to trust you so you don't do it to me. i totally understand how to get it running as i used to use reason 2.5 years ago but i went traveling and had to delete it from my laptop because all my samples took up way to much space. PLEASE ANY HELP WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED...."
