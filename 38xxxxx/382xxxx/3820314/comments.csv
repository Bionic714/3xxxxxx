,razur,2007-10-26T21:20Z,"I must apologize for the seeding problem. I downloaded a application that had something, I don""t know what, that interferred with my file system so I had to cleanup things and restart the program all over again. I am excited about this torrent and plan to upload many more. carefully of course, more shall come after I test them firist. "
