"Fuzion Frenzy" for the original xbox.


Fuzion Frenzy is a nonstop party game with an edge. It combines the continuous, frenetic action of a futuristic street sport with the action-packed fun of minigames set in a dynamic 3-D urban environment. With six arenas and more than 45 minigames, Fuzion Frenzy provides competitive fun for up to four players. Unlike turn-based games, Fuzion Frenzy provides real-time play for all players in both the main game and the minigames. Players can customize the length of the game or play individual minigames. The game includes highly interactive and constantly changing urban arena environments. These changes make for a unique game-playing experience every time.
