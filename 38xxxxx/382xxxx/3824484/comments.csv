 Keep up the good work. "
,arthurofboro,2007-10-01T10:57Z,"Another month another great compilation. Thanks a lot Shankly. I got your message an the August set regarding the artwork so will just post it at the year end. 
If anyone wants it prior to that pm me on the forum."
,marcus_ivo,2007-10-02T01:36Z,thanks again!
,bluegamba,2007-10-05T05:06Z,"Thanks Shankly.
 Due to a lack of interest there will be no more ""Bluegamba's Choices"". I am deeply grateful for your masterful mixes and will continue to rely on them for my monthly updates on music. Have you ever checked out spinner.com? They seem to have a reasonably attractive set of downloadable mp3's. 

Best regards,
Bluegamba."
,lanca,2007-10-07T08:09Z,I've just discovered your mixtapes and they are very much appreciated. Thanks!
[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-10-08T12:05Z,"Thanks for the thanks. 

Bluegamba - sorry to hear your ""choices"" will no longer be aired. Please let me have your recommendations though :)"
,mattcc42,2007-10-08T18:16Z,Yo shankly your taste in indie is spot on for the most part. There's the occasional WTF but for the most part it's good shit. Any chance you could upload the tacticians cd? I can't find it anywhere on the web.

,bluegamba,2007-10-19T10:44Z,"Recommendations? I don't know... 
but take a listen to JosĂŠ Gonzalez - ""In Our Nature"" and Seventeen Evergreen's EP - ""Lunar One"". I liked them anyway. And don't forget to download the new Radiohead. It's good."
,Sanders-,2007-10-21T13:12Z,"I dld these yesterday, and I have to say it's the best list I've ever loaded. It's the easiest way to find my own kind of music, sure I feel like I'm stealing someone elses personality by doing this, but hey, if you don't mind I'll go a head and dl all your lists. See what I find out. Might be quite interresting. I don't know how you have the time to collect all these things, you must be a popfolkalternativeindierobot. Million thanks Shankly."
