,Gremlin_59,2010-07-06T20:40Z,"Why is it not on MP3? 

can upload it as mp3 files?"
,j_benfica77,2010-07-28T16:10Z,"Hi KonaGirl 

How did You get this torrent to seed. I uploaded a Audio book from the same author on here. May be you could be interested in checking it out for yourself, due to your familiarity about the author. look for Shakti Gawain Meditations unabridged."
,namshub,2011-10-27T21:32Z,"@Gremlin_59 Without a ""thank you"" to KonaGirl for obtaining the files then uploading & seeding them? Not even a ""please"" along with your rude & poorly worded demand? You do realize that it is regular people uploading this stuff, and those uploaders are not servants to be ordered about, right? Torrents aren't an inalienable right, they are a gift of time, work, & risk from complete strangers.

It's easier to convert files to your own specifications than have multiple versions of something all in different formats being uploaded.

Here's some software that will do the job quickly & easily: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5639700/Xilisoft_Audio_Converter_6.0.3.0609____serial_-TrT

@KonaGirl Thank you very much for this!"
