Read the description.  This is a small piece of cinema history, 

You can see many of the concepts and filming techniques that were eventually used in the evil dead movies.

Thanks for the upload ctlfreak."

nocturn thanks for the backup. adn you are 100% right it shows alot of the ideas that were taken and implemented into the trilogy.

thanks for the comments and enjoy. but like i said this said a low quality rip. sam refused to release it, but has made jokes about possible lettign it out as a dvd extra one day.  this is a rip from an old 8mm copy. its dark and audio can be hard to hear at times. but bost your gamma and its watchable.  if you an evil dead fan its a must see."
