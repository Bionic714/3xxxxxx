,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-03-08T04:30Z,"HAHAHA!  Funny stuff here!  I first found these guys through NPR's All Songs Considered (which I highly recommend by the way.  You can get it as a podcast on iTunes), and love this CD.  It's rare that you get a group that's funny AND musical (Tenacious D being the other exception)"
,ihaveaclone,2009-02-09T06:27Z,"Please don't ever group FotC with Tenacious D again, that's a horrible reference. Whats wrong with you?! Although, 'all things considered' is worth a listen."
