,maureenmo1,2010-12-05T14:56Z,those of you who are stuck on 99.1 dont worry i only downloaded it yesterday and got to 99.1 same day it was very quick and i decided to check if i had the whole film and yes it played the end credits so i copied and pasted it to my multi media player. i have been after this film for so long i didnt know what it was called or who starred in it then i looked on amazon and found it but as i dont have a credit card i could not get it but now i have it and looking forward to watching it later
