,ph7ryan,2008-08-16T16:06Z,"So I am a successful Beta tester....I have a sse2 P4 processor, and I have gotten everything to work, except a few problems I have run into....

1.itunes and limewire play all of my music and movies too fast, so I am assuming that this either has something to do with my settings or hardware, or this is an issue that needs to be addressed....

2. I updated to the 10.4.11, and it screwed EVERYTHING up....I had to reformat the hard drive, because repairing the drive, and reinstalling from the disk without formatting the hard drive would result in not booting up....

For all of you people that say that you cannot get this to work....

1, download the entire thing as it is right now...don't change any names.....

2. use winrar to open all of the archives, and have everything extracted to folders, without having the DS stores over writing

3. run the Patch o matic program from the folder that says p(something)windows or win directory...you can't miss the file, it clearly states that it is for windows

4. once you have the program running, load the patch file, which is the ppt or ptt file...(cannot remember) and then load the iso file....click patch, and after a while you should get the message that the ISO is patched....

5, THEN you can burn the iso with nero or something, and then it should be able to boot in the bios as long as you have the DVD drive set to boot up before the hard drive....

6. Set up your hard drive using disk utility any way you want it as that is a whole nother tutorial... FYI, the disk has to be black, not grey in the disk utility panal, for it to show up in the installer....


If anyone could get back to me with information on how to fix my 2 issues that would be great"
,RobTheClown,2008-08-25T00:46Z,"I've been going at this for a few days now, with some good patience, but no one seems to be seeding anmore, so now I'm stuck at 92.29%! Please seed. Also, for those wondering why I'm not just getting 10.5, it's because I only have 512 MB of RAM on the machine I'm trying this out on, and I know from experience that Leopard just doesn't run that well with only 512 MB of RAM. Thanks, and, again, please seed."
