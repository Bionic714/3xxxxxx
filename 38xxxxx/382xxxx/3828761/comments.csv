,DarkSi,2008-05-17T03:46Z,"basic_blood, your girlfriend is obviously entirely too awesome for you to appreciate her anyway. People can listen to this because they like it. The same way people can listen to American rock, rap or techno.

Funny - I bet you liked Rammstein when they came out, but not this, because it's not mainstream enough for you."

,justaleaf,2009-03-09T22:22Z,"basic_blood:

That's really ironic... my girlfriend introduced me to An Cafe and I think they're amazing! In fact... it's been one of the strongest bonding elements for us! In order to appreciate it, you need to remove your English ears, accept that you won't understand it right off, and have fun with it! VK is great!
