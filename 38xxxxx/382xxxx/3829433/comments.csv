,ruinyourlife,2007-10-04T13:32Z,I hope you bitches appreciate that you got this before OiNK
,injectthecheese,2007-10-04T16:56Z,"Great song.  Different direction.  Thanks for the up, mang!"
,qberts,2007-10-04T16:58Z,why would anyone be grateful to you when you posted a fake full album? i think you are the bitch and besides i got this somewhere else way before you put this up. so now go ahead and make comments about my mom or something to try to make yourself feel better.
,ruinyourlife,2007-10-04T17:54Z,"Aww your probably just pissed cuz you downloaded my fake release. You know, mediadefender had so much trouble getting crap put on here and I have 2 fake albums going strong since July. That makes me feel pretty good without mentioning your mom."
,qberts,2007-10-04T19:20Z,i didnt download it
,kazzycorn,2007-10-04T21:27Z,man you have no life. i honestly don't see what you get out of uploading a fake torrent. profit? how?
,kamell35,2007-10-05T00:54Z,this is great thanks.. now could you post the whole album and not a fake one that would be greatly appreciated thanx
,ruinyourlife,2007-10-05T02:30Z,"It's called lulz. hah. Anyways, yea the full is fake. This is real. No lulz to be had here. Expect a full rls very soon. This was the first in a supposed upload series of the full album, but buddy was banned after one song from his review copy. So just gotta be ready for him to release the whole thing. "
,ruinyourlife,2007-10-05T07:55Z,I win NINE THOUSANDDDDD Internets?
,taylorspl,2007-10-06T00:54Z,"Sounds fine, can't wait for the album to hit. "
,ruinyourlife,2007-10-06T15:36Z,There are no seeders because this is the piratebay
,taylorspl,2007-10-07T19:21Z,Seeding.
,shabutie78,2007-10-14T13:44Z,"youre a fag. seriously.
why did you post that fake shit anyway?
and why would you bitch about not having any comments?
seriously... you act like you saved the world or something.
little fag."
,TheBigNoob,2007-10-21T09:20Z,"So, really ruinyourlife, this just makes you part of the problem. Why put up fake albums? To piss people off? Does that make you hard? Sorry that you have nothing better to do in your mothers basement celebrating your 36th birthday, but you have the decision making skills of a sixth grader. Piratebay would be much better off without you here, you're the problem here, no one else. Your wasting space on Piratebay with pointless torrents, using up their bandwidth. My girlfriend really wanted that fake album that you uploaded, and guess what, I found it elsewhere. It has been pre-released. So really, the only indication that this was a fake is the good people of piratebay that were nice enough to leave comments about how completely inadequate your existence is. And I know, you have no idea what it's like to have a girlfriend, but it's the difference between posting fake albums, and being a respected and loved person.

P.S.

Zero comments about bad seeding.
I've never messaged to seed. I guess that makes you wrong. Hmm, but, I doubt that is the first time someone ever told you that, right? Douche.

P.P.S. You just got pwned by a guy with the gamer tag of Noob. How does that make you feel?"
,ruinyourlife,2007-10-23T09:28Z,"could give a shit actually. You admitted to downloading the fake album. n00b.

Argument ended. I'm back to FTP and private trackers. Enjoy the piratebay, the slow downloads the adware, cp and whatnot."
