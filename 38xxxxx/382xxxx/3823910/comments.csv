,Monkehtron,2007-09-30T00:39Z,"cpjack, please say you are joking.

If not then no, sorry, it won't. However you can download a copy of xp from this site, and dx9 graphics cards are reasonably cheap at the moment."
,Zorcher,2007-09-30T04:08Z,"The important question is:
Does this work for online play?"
,STBW,2007-09-30T12:19Z,ahhh i want online play! xD 
,stresspill,2007-09-30T12:43Z,"Has anyone actually got this to work?
It took 6 hours to run the install, after which when you try to play the game it brings up an MS-DOS window with nothing in it for about a second, then closes. Brilliant. Someone have a solution PLEASE!"
,NivekOghre,2007-09-30T15:15Z,"If you want online play, go out and buy the game."
,spiffern,2007-09-30T17:42Z,"Hey I got windows vista so I wondered if it works on vista, becuse name says ""For XP Standalone Installer"". And im not so good in english so I just understand that half-way:P So vista=Ok or just XP=Ok?"

Halp me someone!"
,gaurdian,2007-10-01T15:39Z,"Works! @Gorgontainted, it's all in the readme, it says you need to minimize halo2, activate something, then restart ""Gravemind""."
,Gorgontainted,2007-10-01T16:36Z,"Eh... i tried to follow the instructions, but what does he mean with ""process monitor"" I use Windows Xp, is it the ctrl + alt + del thing? Wont work :xxxx"
,siMon1992,2007-10-01T20:55Z,"asså.. detta är cp segt! först tar det 15 timmar att få hem. och sen när man väl ska installera det så hänger det bara upp sig. och cpar hela datorn!!!! fått installera minst 10 gånger, men nu funkar det! :/ lite dryg torrent!"
,ozmoziz1,2007-10-01T22:10Z,"efter typ 10% igenom instal så hänger det säg för mej hela tiden, what too do?"
,pimpsahoy,2007-10-01T22:44Z,"for any of you who are wondering, this is the complete halo 2 for vista game, but when you play on xp, and ms dos windows opens which patches it for xp play...so if anyone asked about it working on vista, it does."
,Gorgontainted,2007-10-01T23:47Z,"^  

Didnt get a shit of what you were saying.
But in the Crackme word document it says this is guaranteed to work for xp etc. But i don't understand what he means with ""Process monitor"", i don't think it's the ctrl - alt - del thingie.. "
,Apl3x,2007-10-02T12:42Z,OMFG! The installation is taking forever! Is it supose to be like that? I hope the game is working...
,Gorgontainted,2007-10-02T14:31Z,"WTF IS A PROCESS MONITOR?!?!?
I  read the crackme file and tried it a billion times, but i cant get past the 12th lvl (disc 2)! I try to follow the instructions, but i really don't know what you mean with process monitor, nor what to do with it."
,Jollefjoll,2007-10-02T17:49Z,"hmm...
Took some time to install, but a patient mind is a good one. Also at the MSDOS window, it just took a few secs, then maybe a minute before it started.
Now I'm just wondering one thing, about the LIVE registration etc etc... how to do to start up the normal campaign?? :S hehe"
,afterdose,2007-10-02T18:41Z,Can anyone upload the bonus dvd that came with halo 3 legendary. Thanks mate
,stresspill,2007-10-02T22:40Z,"This is so annoying would anyone happen to know why the MSDOS window that is supposed to patch it might just come up for 2 seconds and then quit?
Why wont the game come up???"
,williestewie,2007-10-03T05:42Z,process moniter is ctrl alt delete the go to processes then thats the process moniter. noob

,pat12570986,2007-10-04T00:50Z,"Screw everybody that got this game to work, I'm having bollocks luck getting it going. I'm not a ""noob"" and I still get no further than the ""XP PLAY HALO 2.bat"" file - DOS screen comes up, DOS screen goes away. That's all. No Halo 2 for me.

Bugger"
,pat12570986,2007-10-04T00:55Z,"One other thing - when I was installing the game, the C++ installer crapped out, it said it couldn't find

C:\program files\microsoft games\halo 2\redist\vcredis1.cab

WTF?"
,hahli9,2007-10-04T10:35Z,How do you guys even get pass the product key -_-
,Unstopableforce,2007-10-05T15:47Z,"Process Monitor is the Task Manager associated with the Ctrl+Alt+Del keys. Some people call it Task Manager, Process Monitor or whatever the fuck you wanna call it. I havn't downloaded this, but I can imagine what you it it the ""Process"" tab when you hit C+A+D so that you can see the entirety of what is currently running on your computer. It's really amazing, sometimes you discover your ""Norton"" is a pile of shit and doesn't actually help you any."
,paulfranks,2007-10-07T00:06Z,ok i know what the process moniter is i did everything im supposed to ive got dx9 but when i double click the icon a ms-dos window comes up i guess is the patch then soon it disappears and then nothing can anyone help
