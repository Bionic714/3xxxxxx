,hereitcomes,2007-10-01T00:44Z,How do you burn these mkv files?
,rc71,2007-10-01T21:04Z,Come on.  Too lazy to google something.  
,hereitcomes,2007-10-01T21:42Z,I have googled and it seems a conversion is required and some have had problems with audiosync.  Maybe I'm not seeing the big picture.  If this is true then why use this file type?  Has to be an easier way than what I'm seeing.
