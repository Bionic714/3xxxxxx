,redhammer,2007-10-10T04:47Z,"yeah well, even worse it is that no subtitles on exactly YOUR movies works even tho i have realplayer, real alternative 1.51, directvobsub, or whatever crappy selfpromoting spyware u want us to install. until I get a firm answer on why ure putting up movies with non working subtitles (How many of us here speak japanese? no one? didnt think so.) (Also, who here got subtitles working? anyone? care to tell us how? nah, didnt think so.) Hence why I keep my right to have a big mouth till opposite proven."

,redhammer,2007-10-19T22:04Z,"christ this is unbelievable, no english texts on ANY of ur movies, if u want people to download, please seed on asian torrent sites (They understand Chinese subtitles, WE DONT.)   This really pisses me off

People who come here and comes with english talk and when it comes down to it all of the crap they seed is completely foreign and impossible to understand. If this wasnt illegall I`d sue ur ass off. Thats how pissed i am"
