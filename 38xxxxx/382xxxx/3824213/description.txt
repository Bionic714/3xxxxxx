This session utilizes isochronic tones & tone-based pulses. These are consistent, rhythmic stimuli that entrains and stimulates brainwaves. Isochronic tones are the most effective form of rhythmic stimulus. In essence, an Isochronic tone is an evenly spaced tone-based pulse  which simply turns on and off at a specified rate per second. Because the tones turn off so quickly, they produce extremely strong responses in the brain, which leads to most effective possible brainwave stimulation.
