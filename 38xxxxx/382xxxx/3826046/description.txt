We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying.
MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands !!
You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout.
Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much!
Our releases are for scene internal use so
KEEP THEM OFF P2P AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES!!
So much for now ...
meet ya @ the next party ... somewhere.
MYCEL - sending lamers to /dev/null since 2003
We bow our heads to our old friends.    
Deep respect to you!              
Also we would like to greet all of the      
still alive quality scenegroups/sceners!    
Ascii done with love to my lil d3vil.
