Thank you!"
,frank_791,2007-10-02T08:18Z,"Thanks man. I'm quite happy myself - things have gone smoothly. Only one or two spelling errors so far and two reposts. The quality of the media has also been decent since the fifth game or so. 

The performance of the teams and the spirit of the rugby so far have been outstanding. My favorite try so far is the single one Portugal scored against New Zealand, it was a great moment and I am very pleased that I am able to share it."
,Elanadae,2007-10-02T10:27Z,"Yes , many many thanks Frank. All of the matches have been top quality and have retained that quality even after using Nero to convert them back to a DVD playable format. As for the world cup so far, i have been the most impressed by the fantastic effort put forth by the so called weaker teams. Thanks again Frank."
