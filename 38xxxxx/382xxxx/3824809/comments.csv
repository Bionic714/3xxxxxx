,sevenarmy,2009-04-08T14:58Z,Check out Star of Bethlehem documentary! Starry night backs up the facts about the birth of Jesus Christ. If u go to 2B.C. Dec 25 from the region of Bethlehem thats 5 miles south of Iraq youll see Jupiter swirl into a halo around the feet of the constellation Leo which in Greek means King. Next to that is the planet Venus which in Greek means Virgin. Coincidence I think not. The book of Revalation also speaks of stars  and signs in the sky written by John.

Sorry bud, but please keep your religious delusions to yourself.  Believe what you want to, but leave the rest of us to our own beliefs.  If you want to preach, find a more suitable forum."

If you don't like someone's attempt at a helpful comment, then go somewhere ELSE. Why do YOU think you've got to attack what you don't care about or understand? YOU do NOT speak for all of us here. YOUR comment has even LESS to do with the subject at hand which is the software app, not your personal beliefs (or lack thereof). Stop being hypocritical and YOU go find somewhere else to gripe at people you don't agree with. ""Delusions""? Really? So, the positions of the stars and constellations from 2,000 years ago being precisely as the Bible says they were is just us being ""delusional"" because you CHOOSE not to believe in it? I think you need to re-examine the meaning of the word.

sevenarmy: Thanks for that! I had seen the video and I had checked on it with an older version. Sure enough, the stars and moon were EXACTLY as the Bible describes. Quite exciting!"
