,Loop-Skywalker,2008-06-04T12:43Z,"I'm DJing for my 25th class reunion on 6/13/08 for 200+ classmates.  (largest private high school in America.  We do reunions big time)  I wanted to play videos of 80s commercials.  This torrent is a gem of a find.  I checked out your videos on youtube and they're perfect for our 80s Retro them.  I'm downloading now, but it looks like it'll take 11 days at the current rate.  Not in time for the party!  Oh wait, it just jumped to 1 day, but 0 seeds.  Could I be a real dick and ask how I can get these AVIs from you in time without d'loading the flashes from youtube, or at least ask to seed again?  I'll donate.  You're AVIs  are good quality and yeah, nobody wants to see the retrojunk.com bug on crappy flash quality.  Whatever, great download and thanks for taking the time."

,jayshriver,2008-12-06T21:35Z,These are amazing we want to do an 80's themed party and these would be perfect!  Please seed everyone.  I will seed for two weeks when this completes.
