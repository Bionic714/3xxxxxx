,DannOrly,2007-10-06T10:56Z,"No problem guys.

Monde, what you could do is set all of the files to ""low"" and set one to ""high"" so it downloads first, watch it, and if you don't like it then hey its a free world you dont have to download it. ;)"

Or, atleast, there better be."
,DannOrly,2007-10-17T09:49Z,A few guys completed the download and I've got some seeders. I'm getting a new router in a few days that will enable me to seed at high kB/s but until then you guys gotta do your part. Thanks
,datnikka1,2007-10-19T04:21Z,"seed? ive been stuck on 15 kb/s

,DannOrly,2008-03-26T07:35Z,"Rofl, oh noez one whole day. This took me forever to download, and it was even worse for me to seed (maximum seeding of ~60 kb/s)

I hope everyone is getting this okay."

""
Is it me? Or is it that bit torrent or thepiratebay is like ""broken"" because if there is 51 seeders and on mines it says 0 seeders (47) then I think it's broken let me pause and resume."
