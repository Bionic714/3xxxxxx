DVD ripped by CAP2007

Note: Yes, this is the new DVD from Warner Bros. that features a brand-new transfer but sadly they opted out of releasing the DVD with the full scope ratio that the back of the box and Warner Home Video clearly states. But for a slightly wider than fullscreen but not as wide as scope transfer, this one is definately worth checking out.

Also, there are a few noticeable differences in this version. The Universal logo AND the Largo Entertainment logo have been replaced by a short Intermedia logo. Hence the shorter running time. Other than that, it\'s the same movie.

Also, the score album by Brian May and a special suite mixed from the album into 5.1 is also included for those who are interested.
