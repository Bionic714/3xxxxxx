The number of attendants were close to 80.000 as Genesis came on stage in Berlin, and the excitement of the audience can be felt, when listening to this CD.

The sublime version of "Ripples" and the everlasting classic "Carpet Crawlers" are performed to perfection. 
The concert in general was a hell of a show, and by far the best concert I've ever attended (and will ever attend, probably). The 80.000 attendants were absolutely crazy, and played a major role in making this concert one of the greatest moments in their 2007 Turn It On Again Tour.

-Simply a MUST for all Genesis-fans...
