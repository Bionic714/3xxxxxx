I'm most impressed by their performance of ""Ripples"" - It's truly nice to hear them finally do it justice.
Apart from that ""No son of mine"", ""Home by the sea"" and indeed ""Invisible Touch"" are played even better than the studio-version (I normally prefer band's studio albums).
But the best thing is by far the quality. I have the DVD from their ""We can't dance"" tour in 1992 and the quality from this recording is much better.
It's also great how you've made the tracks, so the introduction to each track is in the end of the track before it, so you don't necessarily have to listen to the introduction before listening to the song :-)
By far the best concert I've ever heard Genesis play. Thank you very much for uploading :-)"
,Tavasisel,2007-12-04T01:41Z,"Well, actually I didn't make the tracks that way, I just bought the CD, ripped it and uploaded it as a torrent. But you're right, the quality is much better than the DVD from their tour in 1992, and the concert was truly amazing. Of course the CD never will do justice to actually being there, but I guess that kinda goes without saying.
Anyway, thanks for your feedback; It's nice that people enjoy what I've uploaded."
,Musiclover700,2008-03-12T01:51Z,"Nice! 
I feel kinda stupid that I downloaded ""Live over Europe"", cos that wasn't nearly as good as this recording. The quality is the same, but on this recording you get to hear the introductions if you want to, so you can hear what is actually going on, as well as feeling the tension of the audience. 
I attended their show in Manchester and bought the CD from the show from themusic.com, but Berlin is so much better - next time I'll fly to Berlin :P

Also, ""Live over Europe"" is made from alot of different concert....Which I find as a bi strange concept, since you can actually hear when they switch from the one recording to the other...I find that a bit distraction....is it only me?

Anyway, thanks alot for sharing - this download is very nice!!"
[V],oneanight,2008-06-02T17:47Z,"It is such a shame that this has been uploaded as a MP3 file.And not ""FLAC"" so I won't be downloading this.Because of the quality
but I'm sure someone will upload it in a good quality and not MP3 so I will wait for that..

@ Nice!

Don't feel kinda stupid downloading ""live over Europe"" all Genesis is good but I am sure free advertising for a .com
it's pretty sad don't you think..

you can always download a flac version here..

Great quality, great music!!

Thanks alot for sharing!"
,LezDawson,2008-08-15T02:15Z,"Thanks!  But I have to echo an earlier comment about the mp3 format.  This'll probably be fine for listening out and about on my Walkman.  But a decent uncompressed CD/FLAC rip would be very welcome!

But, still big thanks, I'm gonna enjoy this, I appreciate the up. :)"
,nothingtofearmusic,2009-10-21T04:47Z,"I'd just like to add my thanx to the growing list!  I downloaded this a few days ago and I've been listening to it like a junkie tapping his veins!  It's that good!  Even Phil's vocals are better here than they are on LOE.  Will indeed buy this whenever I scrounge up the $29 necessary to acquire it...which may be a couple months, but anyway...prog on, peeps!"
