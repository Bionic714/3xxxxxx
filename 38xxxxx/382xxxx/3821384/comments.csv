,kinxxxsize,2007-09-27T22:01Z,"I always wonder how one can figure out what is good or bad in a movie he likes; obsession with details is a misery. Keep in mind what you dislike IS PROBABLY what makes you like the movie, in fact.
Besides, authors of works of art are the one supposed to express opinions; spectators have to UNDERSTAND them, and do -or not, but stop viewing fast- what they are told.
Just represent yourself as submitted (through your free will) to works of art. If you imagine movies are just ENTERTAINMENT you are a totally unconscious puppet.
I liked that movie too!"

,Acesifda,2008-03-24T23:54Z,"just wondering- what exactly constitutes an 'exploitation' film?  so far, every one I've seen has just been kinda low budget.  Perhaps that refers to a somewhat over-the-top graphic sex or violent content... ? "
