,4X-AXG,2007-09-28T21:51Z,"as far as I know, that is not the v1.20 version"
[T],supaturtle,2007-09-28T22:02Z,"it seems to be another uprising fight between 4X-AXG vs. N537JB, lol. let's get ready for rrraaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmbooooooo......btw, i wonder why being in this strange business at all, gosh, maybe getting old, muahaha"
,4X-AXG,2007-09-28T22:05Z,"haha I'm not fighting..in fact, I'm not sure which version the link JB gave is..but since people in that torrent are asking for the v1.20 patch, I'm assuming it's v1.0 or v1.1..and this is the official v1.20 installer :)"
[T],supaturtle,2007-09-28T22:14Z,"4x, join msn plz"
,N537JB,2007-09-28T22:18Z,"that is the v1.20.

As said in the info, taken from WoS, and I looked it up, and voila, v 1.20.

naaah, supaturtle.. :p you forgot his bitchboys, so that'll be  => 4x 'n his bitboys vs. N537JB :)
"
,4X-AXG,2007-09-28T22:27Z,"ahh okay..well again, I didn't know that was v1.20..but still this version is better since Addonia sucks period, and also that torrent is 644 MB and this one is 560 MB..while it's the same thing

and yes, my bitchboys, pleeeeease protect me from JB 'cause I'm really scared and intimidated..lol"
[T],supaturtle,2007-09-28T22:30Z,"@N537JB, seems you've got a real serious problem,  no further comments plz"

[T],supaturtle,2007-09-28T23:37Z,"as i said before, no comments at all, you're blame urself, let me call you buddy, not bitch, like ur always use to do, muahaha"
