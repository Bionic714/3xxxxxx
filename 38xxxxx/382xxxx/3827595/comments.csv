SEED!!!"
,Willy_Jonhson,2007-10-13T14:46Z,"You seem to have forgothen that nobody has douwnloded it yet. Be patient till Lotsoflemons commes back online. btw, Is it douwning nothing, or just not alot?"
,Shoegazer88,2007-10-13T16:28Z,"Well.. okey... I C.. Not alot.. 1 kb/s it suck. 
I did forgott to check if someone had downloaded* it yet, sorry. 
But im getting so angry when i was 1 hour from getting it down and it did just stop."
,Willy_Jonhson,2007-10-13T17:11Z,"totally understandeble. ""downloaded"" yea i knew there was someting wrong but i'm dislectic and englisch is my third language so i had no idea what. ^^

i'm totaly stuck on 74% now."
,Gonky,2007-10-13T18:02Z,"Hi, just wanted to remind the seeder to SUPER SEED please =)  This whole process is funny to watch I think, the sudden scramble when a piece is available and everyone starts downloading and uploading like crazy.."
,Shoegazer88,2007-10-13T19:49Z,"Haha okey, english is my second language. ^^  
And Willy im stuck on 74 % aswell.  =/ 
And lotsoflemon is seeding... I Think its too many ppl downloading. 
Maybe those who just start should stop for 1 day and let us over 60% download this game and then seed?"
,Gonky,2007-10-13T20:03Z,"Yes he is seeding, but super seeding is different. It's the most effective way to seed initially (the option is called 'initial seeding' in µtorrent).  And excluding people will not help, in fact, the more nodes the better! (Esp. if lots of lemon is super seeding.)"
,Shoegazer88,2007-10-13T20:08Z,"Oh I c, well.. My download speed have increased and im now downloading in 33 kb/s. Woho! =P 
Maybe I'll get it tonight then I can seed.

[T],lotsoflemon,2007-10-14T15:17Z,"The problem is to many leechers! I have uploaded 6,5 gig on this one! Plenty for a seeder more!"
,rathgar2,2007-10-14T18:39Z,Hey Lotsoflemon!  Look in uTorrent for the initial seeding.  Right click on the torrent and you'll find it in the Properties.  It is supposed to make sure there is at least 1 complete copy uploaded before duplicating uploaded pieces.  It is also called Super Seeding.  I've Uploaded 10.4 GB so far so what is going on is you have been unintentionally been sending out duplicate pieces and no one has gotten the whole thing to be a seed themselves.  Try the Initial seeding option and that may improve this torrent.
,ca.carle.ca,2007-10-14T19:40Z,"yea, rathgar2 is correct. u sent 6 gigs but u sent the same thing to more ppl rather than sending a whole copy to 1 person. just look it says on TPB that u r the only seeder. so please come online and seed because there r so much ppl with 87.1 precent... ps i have been downloading for 2 days now wich is more than enough to get 3.15 gigs"
,ca.carle.ca,2007-10-14T20:44Z,"wow a downfall in leacher, hmmm. thats very interesting... must be because ur a stupid noob and dont know how to seed"
,rathgar2,2007-10-14T21:15Z,"Hey ca.carle.ca I see lotsoflemon connected to the swarm so he is seeding as fast as he can, I've been d/l'ing this for a week now.  Hopefully he comes on soon and reads the posts and tries the intial seeding option.  Till then mon amie, patience!  And to all you leechers out there don't forget to seed when a full copy is up!"
,ca.carle.ca,2007-10-14T22:50Z,oh well hes not online for mee...
,ca.carle.ca,2007-10-14T23:39Z,so i tought that he had abandoned it... i apologyse

,TheWily,2007-10-15T09:20Z,"lotsoflemon....thanks for the thought man but we're all stalled out at 90%

There will hopefully be more seeders tonight!
90,1%"
,TheWily,2007-10-15T10:33Z,"lotsoflemon....

in azureus go to tools then options....then go down to ""queue"" and expand it...then go to ""seeding"" and check ""use super seeding""

after that it shouldn't take too long until this torrent is kickin...

,TheWily,2007-10-16T00:04Z,"stalled at 99.7%

this is terrible...

lotsoflemon...i'm pretty sure you've set to super seed but double check it and please please please seed until we we've got at least 3 other full seeders....it shouldn't take too long...

most everyone is stalled at over 95% so as soon as one other person gets a full seed then this thing is gonna explode and it won't be long until you've started a really successful torrent..

thanks for the thought but i'd be lying if i said this wasn't just a little irritating...even if beggars can't be choosers...."

i say good work. some people can't appreciate the fact that there is a life outside the little box on their desks and the fact that it can't be left running all day long. being impatient and whining isn't going to make it download any faster. thanks for a primo share. "

,Zalfrin,2007-10-17T00:20Z,"Beyond the sword cd image doesn't seem to be working. I've tried installing twice, and gotten an error both times about a file being locked, and thus unable to be updated. I'm going to try rebooting, but it's not looking good. Civ IV + Warlords installed fine, but beyond the sword isn't working for me at the moment."
,Zalfrin,2007-10-17T04:30Z,"Okay, rebooting fixed the problem I was having, 3rd CD installed fine. If I don't post again, it works. ;-)"
,TheWily,2007-10-17T04:36Z,anyone else having problems with ATI an card?
,Zalfrin,2007-10-17T06:05Z,"I'm using ATI Radeon 9800 XT with no problems.

Update on the game: Here's what I did to get it working. First install Civ4 and warlords per the instructions in the torrent. BEFORE installing beyond the sword, reboot. Then finish following the instructions in the torrent. Last thing you'll need to do is get a new no-cd patch for the original w/o expansions since warlords patched it to 1.74. You can get the file you need here: http://www.gameburnworld.com/dl/dl.php?file=Civilization4v1.7.4.0NoDVDFixedexeEng.rar"
,rathgar2,2007-10-17T06:54Z,"I can confirm that this works.  I did take me about 2 hours to mount each of the iso's and cue and had to re-burn my Civ4 Disc because the first would not work.  I also had to re-copy the crack for Civ4 in the middle b/c the warlords update seemed to make it revert.  But now all 3 run.  I've not started any games but they now work and no CD is required.  Thanx Lotsoflemon, you are indeed a gentleman and a scholar!"
,TheWily,2007-10-17T11:33Z,"i got my ATI issues fixed....i was running the omega drivers so i removed those and installed the newest ATI driver....it was a serious pain in the ass with all sorts of misc problems left and right...

i run a laptop and the built in screen doesn't work so i run off a monitor...well...when i finally got the ATI drivers to work it booted up and put me to the laptop screen....that was a serious bitch....i had to wiggle around the wires until i could just barely see the screen to get it switch back over to the external monitor....hot-keys weren't workin on it because it hadn't been set up yet....

what a pain in the ass...but thats what these damn computers are....a lesson in chaos theory...

but it all seems to work now and i'm lookin forward to gettin a game started tomorrow...

thanks lotsoflemon!

Worse, when I tried a multiplayer on a LAN i had to do an update to proceed, afterwhich time I was prompted to insert the appropriate disk :S Ouch. Any ideas?

I have just moved the cracked .exe file to the file directory and the game looks like it is about to load, but them comes up with a ""Sid Meier's Civ 4 has encountered a problem and needs to close"" screen.

,poopguy123,2008-09-23T19:53Z,"Great game and upload! works great. Thanks a bunch lotsoflemons.

For those who need it, heres a simplified set of directions for installing this.

1: use the latest version of WinRaR to unzip the initial file to any location you want.

Heres the link for it if you dont have it:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3871224/WinRar_3.71_final___keygen_(Works_100__)

2: Once you unzip it, use a mounting device like Daemon tools or Magic ISO to mount CIV.iso in the ""Images"" file. (just google one of those and download for free)

3: after you mount it, the install screen will pop up, follow through the wizard and install it. 

4: Now go to the ""Patches"" file and open the CIV patch to update it.

5: Once you patch it, go to the ""Cracks"" file to copy and paste the ""civilization4.exe"" to the game directory. (if you dont know where that is, for me it was in C:\Program files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meir's Civilization 4-just paste it in this file--it should ask you if you wanna replace it, just click yes)

DO NOT OPEN IT YET
7: Now to add the expansions. go back to where you saved the original file and go to the ""Images"" file again. Mount the""CIVWarlords.cue"" file and follow the steps to install the expansion.

8: when it finishes installing go to the ""patches"" file once again and open the CIV warlords patch.

9: once u get done patching THAT, go once again to the ""cracks"" folder to copy and paste ""Civ4Warlords.exe"" to the game directory (in the ""Sid Meier's Civilization 4"" folder, there should now be another folder named ""Warlords"". Copy it in that folder).

10: do the same thing u did for 'warlords' except this time to 'beyond the sword', with the image first, then the patch, then copy the crack to the 'beyond the sword' folder.

11: after you finish all the steps open CIV to make sure it works. If it asks for a cd like ive seen in many comments, simply go to the ""cracks"" folder and recopy and repaste the original CIV patch to the ""Sid Meier's Civilization 4"" folder.

12: NOW play the game =]

Note* u will need to unmount images when ur installing a new expansion.  

If you have any addition questions just add a comment here and ill try to reply asap.
ENJOY! and once again thnx lotsoflemons for this great file."

,poopguy123,2008-09-28T18:44Z,"@ missbex

To mount an iso image you have to download a program called Daemon Tools. Here is a link to the download:

http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

And for seeding, when you finish the download, if you keep the download there it seeds automatically. seeding helps others download faster."

,Nodfor,2008-12-25T20:14Z,I followed the instructions but the game crashed everytime i used civilopedia . Unistalled and installed again with 3.17 patch and battery crack resulted in blue screen when exiting the game . 3.13 patch for beyond the sword + vitality crack for 3.13 the only thing that worked for me
,joepingu,2009-01-02T14:18Z,"I did not use the Warlords expansion due to not getting the Warlords .ISO properly. However to get it running for Beyond the Sword simply follow these steps.

1 Download and unpack .rar (7-zip is a good free tool for this).

2 Mount ""CIV"" image on Daemon Tools Lite (also free), and install (don't try to run the game yet).

3 Apply ""Civ patch"".

4 Mount ""CIV Beyond the sword"" image and install (again, do not try to run game yet).

5 Apply ""CIV Beyond the sword patch"".

6 Open the folder with the cracks in and keep that window open. Now use a seperate window to go into you progamme files on the drive on which you installed the game. By default this should be:

C:\Program Files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 4

7 Copy the ""Civilization4"" crack from the original window you left open, (I recomend copy rather than cut in case you need to reinstall at a later date although either will do) and paste it into the progamme file folder mentioned above. It will ask if you wish to overwrite a file of the same name, say yes.

8 Also in that folder you will find a subfolder:

C:\Program Files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 4\Beyond the Sword

Open this folder and now copy and paste the ""Civ4beyondsword"" crack into it just as you did the first one.

9 The shortcuts originally made by the game on install should now work fine, however if you have problems with them just replace them by creating new ones to the crack files (now contained in the progamme files) you have just moved.

10 Enjoy the game :)

I hope that makes sence and helps anyone having problems, I shall keep seeding this for a few days yet at least, probably a lot longer.

Regards

,DisruptiveMutilation,2012-06-20T02:50Z,"I could use some help, guys.

I can't mount the .cue file with Virtual CloneDrive (Fuck Daemon and it's spyware) for some reason, but I can mount the .bin file and install Warlords from that. But when I complete it, install the patch and then copy over the crack, it simply doesn't respond when i try to star it from the shortcut or the .exe.

Does it have something to do with the fact that I ignored the blaring warning not to play the game until the whole process was complete? Is that the problem? And if it is, why?"
