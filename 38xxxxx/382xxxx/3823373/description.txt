This is a (quick) mouse fix for Counterstrike Sourse or/and 1.6, for starters to get better aim.
And some other minor fixes.

1. First of all, you need to doubleclick the Aim.exe
2. This is a bit advanced if you havn't done this before, I want you to enter your registration to make 2 other changes.
3. Find or make a shortcut for CS:S or CS 1.6.
4. Place it wherever you like.
5. Rightclick the shortcut, and choose proberties.
6. A quick restart, if you havnt done that yet! ^^
7. The only thing left is to determine the mousesensitive you play best with.
8. Feel free to comment.
