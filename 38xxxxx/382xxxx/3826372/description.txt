Nitty's only album, I noticed it wasn't uploaded anywhere (only one I could find was an unseeded 60mb rar).  I got this cheap on ebay and figured the torrent community might benefit as well.

1. ABC
2. Hey Bitty
3. Nasty Girl
4. Like Dat
5. Sorry

ps. I usually don't listen to rap/hip-hop but I liked this album.  Might wanna give it a try.
