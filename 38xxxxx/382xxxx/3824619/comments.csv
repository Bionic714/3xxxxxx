,massokiss,2008-10-17T15:29Z,This is on the legal threat page w/ some funny response from piratebay.Being a huge fan I always end up buying all Pumpkin / Corgan related material anyway. But don't have this yet. Is it still unreleased? Thanks for uploading as I would like to hear it before I blow hard earned cash on it (in the future if/when its released). Billy isn't hurting for money like me. Thanks again. :D
