,jeiroq,2007-10-01T23:05Z,"Freakin sweet man, I've been waiting a while for this one. I'll be seeding for a few days to help out. 

Any way to get Avenged Sevenfold's new one coming out? Anybody?

Thanks again. "
,skinnylo,2007-10-02T02:53Z,Am I a tard or what???????? Why can't I download this????? 
,TheLithium,2007-10-02T09:29Z,Bad quality!
,dib47,2007-10-02T12:31Z,"THANKS Hahninator , another great album, can't wait to see them live again."
,WeeGit,2007-10-02T14:36Z,"Nice one dude, I don't think I could have waited another week for this. (Still gonna buy it though)"
,korbiekwan,2007-10-02T17:44Z,"Yeah, the quality is little not great on certain tracks (clear sounding VRB tracks to low volume 128Kbps ones), but it's good enough to have a good listen to the WHOLE album until a decent rip comes along. Been waiting a while to hear this one. I like what I hear! I don't think others will be disappointed."
,tacker,2007-10-05T10:19Z,Quality is pretty bad.
,shadar,2007-10-09T18:04Z,Thanx man
,ntrain498,2007-10-13T22:15Z,Thanks a lot man. Great fucking album
,riccogrosse,2007-10-14T00:56Z,Thanks...
,dynasystem,2007-10-16T00:36Z,"actually the quality aint that bad, when you convert it and then convert back to mp3, a little trick i picked up. Needless to say i ve actually purchased the album 3 times because i love this band and each purchase has a bonus track!!
BTW i uploaded We Dont Care At All, for the rest of you guys, New Way to Live is on its way, But i strongly suggest you go out and buy teh music by Alter Bridge, they have been through so much to get this album out, if only you guys knew the half of it!!
Support the Music too , it only costs the same as a gallon or so of gas think of it that way!!"
,stephmint,2007-10-16T00:37Z,"if the quality is so bad why don't you buy it? people who complain about free stuff, seriously...!"
,TheBombio,2007-10-28T02:08Z,Thanks. Good quality. Sounds like a good album so far.
,skullcrusher,2007-11-10T09:24Z,whats the point if nobody seeds!!! so come on!! SEED!!!!!!
,billyhudson,2008-01-16T01:38Z,"Nice!
My friend reccomended this to me."
,ciperlone,2008-01-27T14:16Z,"128 kbit, 44100Hz Stereo, MPEG-1 layer 3
not bad quality, not great quality. Better if it was at 192 kbit, at least, but this will do for now :)
great band! i thought they only had one album! glad to know there is another one. seems to be good... ;)"
,andmoreagain,2008-02-23T22:17Z,hmm the quality seemed pretty damn good for me... dunno.... thanks mate! great album!
,mayfield4,2008-04-21T22:01Z,"you cunts should put your hand in your pockets and try paying for the fucking CD.
