I just want everyone to know that this beta was intended as a closed beta and, as such, was not meant for the general public. Consequently, this beta is completely unsupported at the moment (and there are some issues with it).

So, I can only advise people to use this beta at their own risk! I would especially advise not to use this version with Clonecd at the moment. In fact, there are very specific discs that this version of Anydvd won't work properly with even with Clonedvd. I really don't recommend using 6.1.7.5 at all.

And while I can't speak for anyone else, I'm not going to even bother trying to help people troubleshoot problems using 6.1.7.5. This was never intended for a public beta release.
