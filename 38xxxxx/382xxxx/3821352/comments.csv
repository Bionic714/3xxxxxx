,LONGBOW55,2008-02-15T12:58Z,"Thanx for the great torrent.
I've been a guitar player for fourty years.......yes i'm that old.
Hendrix is still one of the great performers of all time.
I remember when a friend brought over the Eperience  album.
I couldn't believe the sounds coming out of the speakers.
He changed the way we saw the guitar forever.
See you in the next world and don't be late !"

,blamotoys2,2010-03-06T06:14Z,"I discover Jimi Hendrix when i was 14...and I was a grunge kid generation then... now, he´s one of the best i do rescue to listen time to time. He´s has sth that seems to be lost today... ANXIOUS PROGRESSIVE CREATIVITY!!!! (to create for good, you know what I mean) His music is an oasis in the middle of today´s bullshit music the media sprays in people´s mind, with an embeded subliminal order to your brain of what is cool, what is not, what´s in, what´s out... like a watermark of... VeryWellPackedShitInaShinnyLittleCDBox. ...Somewhere... things will change... i hope so...And thanks for this videos!!!"
