Altered State Police

"Stoned teen-agers, nutty cops, topless chicks and car chases" (Newhouse News) perpetrate huge laughs in this outrageous comedy that's so funny it should be illegal.

Captain O'Hagen (Brian Cox) tries in vain to control the imaginations and hormones of his bumbling team of five Vermont Highway Patrolmen. But when the opportunity to solve a real crime rolls their way, the formerly inept Super Troopers pounce into action to become highway heroes.
