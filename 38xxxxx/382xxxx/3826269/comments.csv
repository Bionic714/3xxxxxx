,Gay_Eagle420,2007-10-01T19:38Z,"Hey now, did you pay the $1.50 we asked for on WoS for this?
I want you all to know that we at WoS will (if you decided to join us at the low, low PRICE of $5.99) constantly accuse you of stealing things we posted, we will spread paranoia on our forum, we will flood you with requests for more money, we will constantly threaten not to post things your donations pay for and will always respect your opinion (as long as it does not differ from our own). 
We promise to make you feel like one of the boys as long as you stroke our egos by constantly kissing our asses and thanking us and giving us credit for buying FS Addons with your donation money.
Thank you very much potential suckers.... I mean members. "
