The IRIS Pro Series T-6/A Texan II has been designed from the ground up with T-6/A Pilots, Students and fans in mind. From the word go, we knew we had something very special in mind with this product. As a result of the hard work from the IRIS in-house development team and some key external contractors, we hope to bring you the most realistic rendition of the T-6/A Texan II for Microsoft Flight Simulator.
