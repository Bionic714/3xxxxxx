,chapt_90,2007-10-04T18:21Z,what firmwire do u have uploader? does it work with NBA 2K7?
,Hurtige,2007-10-05T02:40Z,"I cant remember my firmware version. But as far as i recall NBA 2007 live worked on my xbox without using this program (im using unleash x dashboard). But so far i havnt run into a single game that this program didnt work on. 

But since its only 1,5 MB why not just try it ;) If you dont wanna waste a disc on it you can just FTP it. "
