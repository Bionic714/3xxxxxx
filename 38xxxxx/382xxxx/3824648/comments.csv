,Fjr1300r,2007-11-14T17:23Z,Thanks for the Up.  Been practicing on my FJR and even though its a heavier bike i still wouldnt mind pulling a few up every now and then.  
,ilblissli,2008-10-17T20:31Z,i downloaded this video (and so far have seeded 7:1) and i must say its great. 2 guys with a handy cam and some stunt bikes did a much better job than most of the high dollar production stunt videos that i've seen. the guys are really funny easy to understand and they explain things in simple english. great video
