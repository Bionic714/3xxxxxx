[V],martin_edguy,2007-10-10T14:48Z,ho0w do i put the game in ds
,Kaiwano,2007-10-11T17:57Z,"martin, there is no harddrive on the DS you can put games. You need a memory card, a DS slot converter and a usb converter"
,ronemp1,2007-10-13T20:06Z,"Martin, you need to get a micro SD Slot 1 DS cart. Something like M3 Simply. It comes with a micro SD usb reader/writer, just copy the DS file to it, and then put your micro SD in the M3 and insert it like any other DS cart, then it will load the game. a 2GB micro SD can hold up to about 30-50 DS games. Of course those are your backup games. =)"
,nizzyniz,2007-10-14T09:11Z,"or you can just smash your screen, take the glass (CRT only) and put it in your ds..
that should do the trick...martin ^^"
,walty82,2007-10-17T06:10Z,"I cannot get this game to work, no matter what I do. I am using Supercard SD. I havent had a problem with any other games but I just cant seem to get it working. Any ideas?"
