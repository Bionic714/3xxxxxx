This one is rare - never released until ""The naughty early years - set 3 - episode 4"" - due to the music rights (song by Marty Robbins). 
Originally from TV december 17 1975 (data from BennysPlace). 4:38 good quality divx.

I'll seed this to a shareratio of 5:1 or more with 20K or more within the next 2 weeks. "
