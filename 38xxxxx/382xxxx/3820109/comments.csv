,Dj-Slick,2008-01-21T03:39Z,i got a L6 does it works
,richhie,2008-03-01T00:03Z,this game pack is for motorola phones if you can get them to work on a sonyericson then your lucky but most motorola phones will support them
,babanner,2008-07-13T17:16Z,"I don't think these games will work on SEs. And for all those who couldn't manage to start the games on their motorola phones: i've already said that these games are for motorola 240x320 screen size models. I've tested them on MOT V3X and they all worked. They should also work on MOT V3XX,RIZR Series, Roker E2 and similar Motorola phones. If you want so much some games for your 128, 176 screen size motorola models i will add some shortly so check my profile ;)"
,Ravyn66613,2008-08-06T00:34Z,"These are jave games (.jar) which means, if I'm not mistaken, that they'll run on Sony Ericssons, Nokias, Motorolas, and maybe some others. The screen size might be a problem on some phones, though. The games should still run, but you probably won't be able to see them properly (depending on your screen size).

Hope I helped!
