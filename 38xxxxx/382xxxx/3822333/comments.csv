,N-drju,2008-03-25T12:50Z,"Hah, that's a tough one I was trying to hunt Hexen 2 for some days now. Each time I search, I get around 15 results, each with different size. :D I think that Hexen 2 has at least 100mb. I'm not sure but maybe this file is just ""Portal of Praevus""?"
,crazzyinjin91,2008-07-25T09:57Z,"or it might be the first one or JUST A VIRUS!
fuck man hexen 2 isnt that small!"
,Wormicle,2008-08-16T23:44Z,"No, Hexen 2 was released in 1997/8. This is the right size. Don't listen to dickhead scaremongers who go ""VIRUS VIRUS VIRUS"" because they tend to be full of shit."
,Wormicle,2008-08-16T23:45Z,"You do know what compression is, right? No? Noob."
