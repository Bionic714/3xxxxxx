,ac0de,2007-09-28T00:25Z,Why would you upload a demo version?
,betteroffdread89,2007-09-28T00:56Z,"Wow, what a complete waste of someone's time.

1. You need M-Audio hardware to open this and get any kind of functionality.

2. It's a demo version.  Why?

3. It must have taken you five-ten minutes to compile and post this torrent.  Don't you think you should have done something more constructive with your time.

wow."

,keyguy13,2008-05-20T19:47Z,"Look, rub-a-duck, there are plenty of other files to share that are legal. The reason people are giving you grief about demos is that it is likely much faster to just download the demo from the company's website than to share it here. It's a waste of time and bandwidth."
