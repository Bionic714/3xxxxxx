Video works using the VLC Player, but sound doesn't work.  Does anyone know how to make the sound work on a MAC, some type of VLC add on or codec  of some sort?  Thanks for any help.  Peace-"
,timberlax,2008-06-09T06:38Z,Can u install the divx codec (www.divx.com) on a mac? because that usually resolves the problem of a missing codec on a PC.
,rabamble,2008-06-10T19:34Z,"Yo Timberlax, thanks for this torrent, I like Hey Arnold alot. Also, is it possible for you to upload all of the Ahhhh Real Monsters and the Angry Beavers seasons please? I'm trying to make a collection of all the great Nicktoons. I already have every single Ren and Stimpy episode, all of Doug, and Rocko's Modern Life, and Hey Arnold (thanks to you). If you can get Real Monsters and the Angry Beavers, you would make many people very happy, including me. Thanks"

,kodan50,2011-06-05T01:54Z,"I didn't see it mentioned, but the show is legally available on Amazon in DVD-R format, and pre-orders for the first season pressed DVD boxsets are available. If you like Hey Arnold, you should purchase the boxset to help ensure the other 4 seasons are released as well! :)"
