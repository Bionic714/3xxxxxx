,bow-chicka-wah-wah,2007-10-11T16:12Z,"Whole 1st season, and the file size is 2.22 GiB... A bit too obvious?"
,KEGGERMAN,2007-10-12T05:26Z,"Not sure what you are trying to say with your comment, but this is the complete 1st season."
,fotbollsgirl_88,2007-10-24T19:24Z,What is VP7? and I can use the files in VLC without it?
,KEGGERMAN,2007-11-04T21:15Z,The current version doesn't support VP7 natively but if you download and install the codec from the link included it will play in any video player including VLC
,ColdFusion241286,2007-11-05T18:14Z,"After downloading the codec, the files worked perfectly. Thanks so much for the episodes. "
,venomzorg,2007-11-07T02:58Z,"it worked fine with the codec, the link did not work but i searched for ""on2_vp7_personal_edition.exe"" at the site (www.on2.com), no problems here."
,robogobo,2007-11-08T00:42Z,"hey, thanks for the shitty ass codec.  Mac users are left out in the cold.  you asshole."
,Bergene,2007-11-16T15:05Z,the fucking video is  up side down
,Givijoarna,2007-12-24T20:25Z,"This works just great, and it is NOT upside down, just goggle the codec and download it from freecodecs,,,, thanks KEGGERMAN, keep up the good work"
,JTP89,2008-03-17T16:45Z,"Well about Mac and VP7. I noticed on the on2 homepage that Apple is one of their key customers. I don't have an answer to why it's not compatible with Macintosh, but keeping in mind that they are one of their so called ""key customers"", i'd say they should be compatible soon. Hopefully."
,JockeP,2008-03-29T12:49Z,Why does in not work in VLC?
,SONAHT_87,2008-04-15T11:20Z,Works very well for me! Great job! thnks!
,indifference84,2008-05-01T21:51Z,What is a good program to convert VP7 files. I tried Xilisoft and ConvertXtoDvd and neither worked.
,anxcher,2008-05-02T08:54Z,what kind of player are you useing?
,Xenity,2008-06-07T23:05Z,"Linux users can convert one of these 'VP7' files to a VLC-playable AVI file with this one-liner:
mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o /dev/null && mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:bitrate=950 -o destinationvideo.avi

Change 'somesourcevideo.avi' and 'destinationvideo.avi' to the input and output files respectively.  Requires 'mencoder' to be installed.  For batch processing, see the script on this page:

,TorrentMonster,2008-10-15T22:42Z,"every time i press the link to the codec i get to the homepage, i need some one to tell me what i need to press to get to the codec file!"
,massst,2008-10-16T14:18Z,"Thanks 4 the upload KEGGERMAN.

Still when I try to make a DVD out of your .avi with ImToo I get an error which makes it impossible, I guess it's the codec :("
,Number1xer0,2009-01-21T10:19Z,can i just use vlc media player
,Pujan7,2009-01-23T21:07Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent !
I have already downloaded and watched 7 complete Seasons ripped by Keggerman, and currently I am downloading the 8th Season.
All you have to do is to download VP7 Personal Edition (Free) Codec here: 
http://www.on2.com/index.php?615
And enjoy the good Video and Audio quality.
Many thanks to Keggerman
I am looking forward for next seasons."
,Catscan,2009-02-24T02:20Z,"Great rip, but it does not work in dvd-player.. atleast not in any of mine..  =("
,MeTylerdurden,2009-04-11T18:48Z,that FUCKING CODEC SUCKS COCK   YOU SUCK  WILL NOT WORK
,MeTylerdurden,2009-04-11T20:35Z,KEGGERMAN SHOULD BE BANNED  
,Svamprally,2009-04-21T21:21Z,"Mytylerdurden, there is nothing wrong with this torrent, it's just you that's retarded"
,herjabram,2009-06-17T19:23Z,"I can't understand why so many always upload files in formats nobody has ever heard of, and for which you need to download this and that.
Why not just upload it as avi, mpeg or divx.
Nonetheless I downloaded the codec and now it works, but it would have been easier if it was playable right away, without downloading codecs."
,oppemi,2009-06-23T21:52Z,"I have downloaded all Vp7 codecs I have passed by including VP7 Personal Editor, but only program I can open it in is WinAMP, but the video is upside down..... Please Help!"
,Thrill_Seeker,2009-06-26T15:38Z,"Great work man. I've been looking for it since forever and i don't care what codec I should download anyway.
Why don't u freaks get your butt out of your chairs and convert it to any other format!!! I bet you butts are like 80 pounds each coz ur eating crackers and laying in bed waiting for people to upload shit!!!"
,DeadSpartan,2009-06-26T16:21Z,Why can't I play subs with it? Is it the codec?
[T],keka_umans,2009-06-27T12:53Z,codec cant be converted to divx it won't recognize it. a complete waste of my time thanks for nothing
,3ss0neR,2009-06-28T22:10Z,"Won't play on my iMac (Tiger) or my Macbook Pro (Leopard).
I tried the Vp7 w/ Crossover, through VLC, QT, Divx, 3ivx, Mplayer osx 1 & 2 and a Divx Converter, nothing works.
Has anyone found a way to play these on a Mac?"
,lukeborg,2009-07-14T14:47Z,thx very much... works perfectly with Vp7 codec :) cheers!
,P0LICE,2009-07-22T16:15Z,"Gonna Try it out ;)

People Seed plz"
,richrard,2009-07-25T09:57Z,"quality isnt too bad, but this rare codec did not work in vlc 8.6, so i was forced to use wmp, which im not a big fan of

getting another copy now, and if the quality is decent enough ill trash this one

i dont know why they would pick this codec, it doesnt really seem any better than divx. its just a hassle for everybody who gets it, even regular pirates, though i dont agree with MeTylerdurden that the uploader should be banned"
,MsGarbo,2009-08-02T05:34Z,thanks a lot kegger all of your uploads are greate
,FatLion,2009-08-03T12:50Z,I love you man!
,FatLion,2009-08-03T12:52Z,"every idiot that say this does not work, lies, keggerman has done realy god job
in the midtime, link for codec changed
here is a 100% working one
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/VP7.htm
dont insult this man, he made me happy:)"
,ThisIsMoad,2009-08-26T09:08Z,"thanks a lot i successfully downloaded the whole torrent, 2.21GB has 13 full episodes of The Simpsons, every episode is a 174MB AVI file.
the quality is great. and thanks KEGGERMAN.

one more thing no need to download whatever codes they ask you to, i use Real Player 11.0.6
it's a completely free version, and i had no problems with playing the episodes at all."
[T],gamerguuy,2009-09-03T15:50Z,can any body help me with the subs? i downloaded subs for it but they are not showing.if i need any codec for this then please inform me.thanx
,ThePokemonMaster,2009-10-14T17:41Z,I got a error when I tried to play with VLC media player..
,wassall,2009-12-22T09:27Z,"Why is everybody complaining its in AVI format if using Win Media Player download this: http://download.divxmovies.com/DivXInstaller.exe then all should be working, if not please tell me and I will find out what needs to be done."
,wassall,2009-12-22T09:31Z,"Also ThePokemonMaster try downloading using the link I have posted. I don't use VLC Media Player but the codec will work with most Media Players. As with 3ss0neR Im not sure if it will play on Mac try this http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/f/3/0f347443-f1ff-4830-9b20-65da2c6bf111/WindowsMediaInstaller.bin then download the divx codec on my first post, and hopefully all should be working."
,wassall,2009-12-22T09:40Z,"Dont listen to last post wrong link!!! Instead try a version of Win Media Player for MAC Leopard (10.5) and Tiger (10.4). Then download codec.

That should fix the problem!"
,wassall,2009-12-22T14:11Z,Another codec required is: http://www.on2.com/file.php?85 this should make the episodes work. This is for Win Media Player and many others including VLC and Realplayer.
,m-k_gangsta,2009-12-30T14:23Z,Please Seed
,Agent_24,2010-01-31T06:21Z,Please use a good open source codec next time!
,peestandingup,2010-05-25T12:06Z,"Someone should ban this guy. He's either a complete noob & chose the absolute worst codec possible, or he's in cahoots with the VP7 people to release these so to get more people to download their shitty ass codec.

Seriously, this works on absolutely nothing besides a Windows machine with this specific proprietary codec installed. No Macs, no Linux, hell, none of my media center players will play these & they play fucking EVERYTHING. You do know that people watch videos on more things than a Windows PC dont you??

Listen, dude. If you're legit, we appreciate the effort. But you really fucked up big time. You couldnt have picked a worse codec to rip these in. Either go back & do them over or delete this garbage."
,wanabegk,2011-01-14T20:32Z,"Hi...Linux will decode this if you have the codec the right  package...I use mplayer and w32codec

Also, the files can be converted into anything you want.

Linux users use mencoder read docs and convert to xvid or whatever....

Others there must be a way to convert, prolly VLC or something....

Thanks uploader..."
,ukkelii,2011-02-20T20:04Z,Better codec! VP7 sucks!
