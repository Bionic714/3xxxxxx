,FatFreddy2,2007-10-02T23:09Z,"@atv:
Frankreich sieht schön aus. Jetzt sogar in 1:1.
Bin in ca. 1 Woche zurück, dann schau ich mal nach."
,atv,2007-10-03T07:50Z,"Hehe, bonnes vacances!"
,Rob Mulder,2007-10-06T12:54Z,"When you try to install it it say's you need a registration key. 

Does anybody has it?"
,Rob Mulder,2007-10-07T18:14Z,Couldt someone please help me with the key?
,atv,2007-10-07T20:05Z,"We wait all for our friend Nincenez.
When there is a solution for the South, there will also be one for the north... don't worry, it's only a question of honor and time :-)

,atv,2007-10-07T20:13Z,"Perhaps u should try this 1 (found on emule):

ed2k://|file|Topo%20Deutschland%20Map%20Source%20Reg%20Garmin.rar|413527943|AA23F644EE10AF8F5EF8FD270B77F593|/

Complete CD-Content without any Activationkey.
Key is necessary to activate product online.
So this version is for Backup-purposes only.

Please share all installed IMG-Files and the PRODUCT.TDB located in the Family_535 directory,
i.e. c:\Programme\Garmin\Mapsource\FAMILY_535 (Not the files located on disk). Then it's possible
to integrate the unlocked files in Mapsource.

Editing the Registry in this way should work.

REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Garmin\MapSource\Families\FAMILY_535]
""ID""=hex:17,02

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Garmin\MapSource\Families\FAMILY_535\1]
""Bmap""=""C:\Programme\Garmin\FAMILY_535\basemap.img""
""Tdb""=""C:\Programme\Garmin\FAMILY_535\product.tdb""
""Loc""=""C:\Programme\Garmin\FAMILY_535""

Bullshit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Files are coded!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No Bullshit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The files finding at the Harddisk are not encrypted. 


Bullshit!!!! It dos´t work -  no, no, no ------ Why?????????

UPDATE 13.05.05

Ausführen Regedit die Links in der Registrierung anpassen.

,Rob Mulder,2007-10-10T21:25Z,Thanks ATV but it does not work for me. Can you share the emule version on this torrent site?

,orcofthedarkness,2007-10-13T09:13Z,"Hi, Nincsenez

,zwergen,2007-10-16T23:15Z,"I had the same problem. Sud works and North doesn't.
I tried to do the editing of the registry but Mapsource crashes, if I choose the North maps from the menu.
I notided that in the North file list, there's a file: mpc_id.dat which is not in the Sud collection.
Is this file in the way somehow?"
,Rob Mulder,2007-10-20T14:41Z,"I?ve done the job. Everything works with this version.
