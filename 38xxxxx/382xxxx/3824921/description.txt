Next out in my series of DVDRips (I'm cleaning my hard drive, converting all the 4.5GB DVDs into 700MB AVIs), is this old classic from 1981.

The Nordic subtitles come in two versions each, letterbox and wide screen. As you may guess, the letterbox version is supposed to be located over the black part at the bottom of the screen when you watch the movie on a 4:3 ratio screen. At least that's the theory, I haven't checked if it really works that way.
