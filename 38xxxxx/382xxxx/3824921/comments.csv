,ALYRIC23,2007-10-12T06:32Z,Why can't I see any video when I play this? All I have is sound. I've tried playing on Winamp as well as Windows Media player.
,Baloo2,2007-10-14T09:24Z,"ALYRIC23. That's a classic problem. You must have the proper codec installed to be able to watch the video.

I usually recommend K-Lite that has almost every codec you will ever require -- and also have Media Player Classic included; a much better media player than the bloated Windows Media Player IMHO."
,ALYRIC23,2007-10-14T16:27Z,Where can I get that? Will that enable me to burn the movie to DVD and watch it on a standard DVD player? Thanks for your help!
