,Deputy276,2008-06-27T17:32Z,"""Cracked content?????"" WHAT cracked content???? I see no file or folder that is a crack. I wish people would take a little more effort when uploading these games. First off, there are FREE programs that let you rip it as an iso. Zipping all those files does NOT reduce the size of the upload. And if you have a crack included...IDENTIFY IT!!! I ended up downloading the nocd crack. Also the tires are missing on all the bikes. BAH!!! Wasted a download and wasted a DVD. "
