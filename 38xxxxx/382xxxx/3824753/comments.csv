,Paymon,2008-04-06T03:23Z,"This is the working V1.10.1115 patch.
However, ingame is a bug, making it impossible to finish the Silver Shard qeust (first quest you get).
Updating to V1.10.1116 fixes this, but I fear the V1.10.1115 patch will not do...

Will a V1.10.1116 come out soon, please?
Thank you beforehand.
PS: EnjoyIt, you roxxorz!"
