Brag!



It's Not a "Four Letter" Word



In today's competitive business world, bragging is a necessity - not a choice!  Remaining quiet about yourself, or worse, downplaying your successes leads to being underappriciated, or even allowing others to take credit for your achievements.  When done with grace and style, bragging promotes your best asset- - YOU!



Now a top business coach teaches you to artfully communicate your talents and accomplishments without feeling or sounding like a walking billboard. You'll gain the motivation and skills that lead to gem assignments, raises, promotions, and stronger professional relationships.  And you'll enjoy tooting your own horn in a way that is sincere, feels comfortable, and doesn't turn off those you're trying to impress.



Filled with self-promotion dilemmas and solutions for both your professional and personal life,  and written for everyone from the telecommuters to those who are between jobs, Brag! shows you how to put your best foot forward - while keeping it out of your mouth!
