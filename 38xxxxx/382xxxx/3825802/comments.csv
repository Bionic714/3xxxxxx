,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-05-28T11:09Z,"for the people concerned with software compatibility:

Sign Lab (for vector graphics) does not work. This is very expensive and impossible to crack software that requires a hardware USB dongle. it will only work on 32bit, which i'm forced to run on my 32 bit laptop. 

Ableton Live does not work. locks up on installation.

AutoCAD 2008 does not work. i use this and Sign Lab for my business, and i'm screwed... thank god i have a 32bit laptop.

there are a few others but i think it's okay because most of you guys don't really need the software that i run. high dollar shit that is only used by .002% of the population. 

if you're worried because games won't work, you're fine... i havent had a problem with any game not working, because if something gets glitchy, you have ""compatibility mode"" which helps out tremendously... F.E.A.R. runs smoothly, Call Of Duty 4 runs like a dream, Far Cry is perfect.

Your a fucking idiot. Just to get that in the open. How the fuck can you get on this site and support Comcast, you fucking cunt. I'm hoping this just shows that you are a fucking dick weed pirate noob who does not make the slightest effort to understand the real issues many of the users of this site fight for. If you ever hope to become more then a spineless cock sucker then I suggest you make some effort to learn a little about copyright reform and how it effects piracy. You can start off by reading a paper I wrote about copyright reform, its fairly unbiased and presents a good overview. It also makes some really amazing points. Good read I'm told. After you check that out, start reading torrentfreak.com. I've read every article they have wrote in the last 1.5 years and its really great stuff. Highly recommended. I'll start you off with one about your beloved Comcast, fuck face.

Thanks for the effort, but this didn't work for me. After a finished install, the first time Windows tries to start normally, it reboots as if there was some kind of BSOD. I think it automatically installed some drivers that weren't compaible with my system. I can't even start in safe mode.
Inspecting the installation using another drive, I noticed it takes up 1.8GB of space - my 3 year old 32-bit version uses 1.5GB. Will try to find an older installation."

xp64 and server2003 share the same core, so it will show up as 2003 on some tests, and they both use the same service pack.

xp64 corporate does require a cd-key but doesn't require activation.

corporate is the same as professional.  It just doesn't require activation.  You pay for this privelage to the tune of approx.  $600.  

most vista 64 drivers work with xp 64.  They use the same driver model.

it is impossible to upload xp64 sp3 because there is no such service pack.  xp64's latest service pack is 2.

autocad 2008 has a service pack available for download on their site that makes it work with xp64.

more and more support for hardware is forthcoming since major manufacturers are now including vista 64 on their shipping machines so they support the now defacto 6 gb of ram."

,ShadowMastr,2009-01-06T03:06Z,"Just a note to say thanks for the torrent, it was a fast download, still after a year of being uploaded..... and I got it burned to a disk with imgburn, and did a reboot with it in the cd drive, and it started going thru setup just fine. I stopped it at that point because I only set up my system to do 2 OS's, and I have 2 vistas running at the moment, both 32 bit, one the Eternity version from Rockersteam, and an oem version with just the activator as the only 'extra'.

They both suck in my opinion. Programs crash daily, I have to reboot at least 2-3 times a day. Must be a vista problem... haven't had to reboot so much since the Win 98 days.

Since I have a quad core with 4 gigs ram, didn't want to install 32 bit xp unless I have to, so I'll give the 64 bit xp a try. Still need to run a 32 bit of something, some games and apps just won't run on 64 bit, Guitar Hero 3 being one of them..."

- Torrent is clean.
- This is the corporate version, there is no activation.
- The disc image appears to be unmodified aside from an info file with the product key in the root directory.
- The disc includes SP services pack 1. Service pack 2 can be slipstreamed into it, but only from a computer already using Windows x64 edition.
- Windows Update works fine.
- All your regular 32-bit software will work fine with no performance difference as long as it doesn't integrate with Explorer.
- You MUST have fully 64-bit drivers for all your hardware."

,did82,2009-07-07T03:36Z,"strangest thing happend..i dl, burned, installed, started to install my drivers and after the first restart the whole thing just wanished from the hard -drive. omg i thought. thought it maybe had something to do with the fact that i had xp-32 bit version on the same particion. so i formated c: through the windows setup system, and installed the 64 bit version again. all finished and everything looked ok. and started once again installing the drivers and yet again after the first restart during driver-install the same thing happend again. BUT the weirdest thing was that my pc started up os like usual, but it was the older 32 bit version that was supposedly formated from my hard-drive, and everything was exactly the way it was before i formated the hard-drive. now can anyone tell me if they have had the same problem? And if so, what's the solution to it?"

,OneHitGamer,2009-11-09T00:17Z,"did82 - Sounds wierd. but my guess is you may have had 2 partitions and you FORMATED only 1, and not the one you thought. which left the other, which had XP 32 bit OS on it. which would cause the events you described. now WHY 64 bit kept removing itself i dunno. my guess is it didnt. the files themselves are still there just not on the proper partition to be BOOTED. although i dont know why it didnt ask you when you restarted for which OS you wanted to boot into. 32 or 64..hmm...just boot up 64 disc and delete ALL partitions. then create a new one, format it, install. it will guide you thru the steps. :)"

,Talanwolf,2010-05-25T18:56Z,"I've seen some other people mention this but it hasn't been given much attention...

There are some of us that are having internet connection issues...

My issue is that the OS doesn't have a default wireless connection available for me to use my wireless card for an internet connection. When I install the drivers the wireless card is recognized but I'm still unable to use it at all.

Also, although I do have a local area connection which I decided to try after several hours of trying to get my wireless connection up and running but although it says it's connected, it won't access the internet at all. I've got two other computers at the house connected and using the internet, one wireless, one ethernet, both work fine.

I'm guessing that there is some software/drivers that are missing in this torrent or I need to adjust a setting within the OS. I've never had a 64 bit system but all my hardware is compatible. I've installed all my 64 bit drivers for all my hardware, everything works fine except the LAN/Wireless connections.

Any info would be greatly appreciated."

When Windows x64 came out initially, there was ONLY 64 bit AMD architecture. Intel is now allowed to use 64 bit arch because of the amount of time that has gone by as part of monopoly laws.

,fumosi,2011-07-17T00:11Z,"Thanxs for the OS. Works perfectly. Have logged in to clear some doubts. I downloaded this file about a year ago. And only tried it out yesterday to install on my Sony Vaio i7 (64bit processor) laptop which has a intel chipset. Since i had read somewhere that winxp pro 64bit should be burnt on CDR and not CDRW/ DVDRW, i burnt it on a CDR. The first two times i tried to install i got the dreaded BSOD screen (blue screen error). But as i had read each of the comments mentioned here, i knew that the problem was from my laptop end and not from this torrent file, as some people have been complaining. I than used Everest proggy to findout all the technical specs of my laptop (like SATA controller, graphic, sound network adaptor etc). Next i googled on the net and found the intel chipset series 5 drivers for winxp pro 64 bit. Than i extracted the contents of the iso file to the hardisk and using nlite proggy i slipstreamed the intel chipset series 5 drivers which are for my laptop into the winxp pro 64 bit. Than still using nlite proggy i rebuilt the bootable winxp pro 64 bit iso back. Than i burnt this iso onto a CDRW (a rewritable CD) and when i booted from this CDRW (voila) there was no blue screen error. The installation went smoothly and there has been no problem whatsoever after that. So as seen from my experience the problem is that all the errors that one gets is because of not having the correct drivers for the winxp pro. One has to search and download the correct drivers. The problem does not lie with this torrent file but with one's own hardware. As Sony does not provide drivers for winxp pro 64 bit for my laptop (it provides for win 7 home premium only 64bit), i had to search on the net for each of the drivers for my hardware. It took me almost 15hours at a stretch to get all the drivers working in the device manager. So to conclude i have made my laptop dual boot with win7 Home premium 64 bit & WinXP Pro SP2 64 bit( using this torrent file plus SP2 which i downloaded separately). The only thing that was giving the BSOD was the Intel 5 series chipset drivers which i integrated into the ISO. All the other drivers i manually installed later on from within WinXP pro as there was no need to integrate those drivers into the ISO. Just thought of sharing this , to help people here : that the ISO file is fine. The problem lies with eachones hardware drivers."
