cool remix but the whole song goes like  this:
Hard up Hard up
Fired up Fired Up
Doing some Push ups
Hard up Hard up
Fired up Fired Up
Doing some Push ups
Wouldn't want to be you Wouldn't want to be you
But if I got to be you But if I got to be you
Feel's Good Feel's Good
Sounds Good Sounds good
Hard up Hard up
And so on??.
