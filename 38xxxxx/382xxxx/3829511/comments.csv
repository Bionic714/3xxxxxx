,air1201,2007-10-07T18:58Z,"i beg you to help. i downloaded this and after extracting it i get a psp_game file and a boot.bin thing. how do i convert this into the normal iso file?? i tried the umdgen but i got a winrar file after generating iso, its around 800mb. i tried putting that into psp but it won't work. also do i need to upgrade my psp into 3.52 m33???"
,air1201,2007-10-08T17:54Z,"it's ok now. i downloaded another torrent which is cso file around 700 mb. so much easier, just extrating it and paste to iso folder.
i am on 3.4-oe.
