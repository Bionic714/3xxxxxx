,zzombiieaterrr,2009-01-24T22:40Z,Good quality! ~ Seeding. 
,Sen-Sen,2009-03-14T18:05Z,Thank you so much for this. Been looking for it for years. One of the most incredible nightmare sequences I've ever seen. And thanks to all the seeders as well!
,iShare4u,2009-08-01T05:04Z,"aka_pseudonym, I can't thank you enough for this. I never got to see this movie to its end, and I've been searching for it for quite some time.

Thank you!!"
,iShare4u,2009-08-06T06:04Z,Forgot to say: quality is excellent!
,Jenna_PT,2010-04-26T01:18Z,"OMG Thank you so much for uploading this movie!  This is one of my all time favourite movies!  It disappeared into the video abyss here in Canada when VHS died and I have been searching for it ever since.  For some reason this movie affected me like no other movie has, and it has haunted me for years.  

I can't thank you enough for making it available again!  Assuming everything works out with the download, I will seed for as long as I can!"
,Jenna_PT,2010-04-27T00:23Z,"Just finished watching the movie... just as haunting as I remember!  

I couldn't have asked for a better quality download either... especially considering the rarity of the film.

Don't expect BR quality or anything... that's just not realistic.

So, taking the original aspects of the film, and its rarity, into consideration, I give this upload a 9/10.  The only reason it didn't get a 10/10 is because it is separated into 2 parts; but other than that it's perfect!"

Does any one have the 1972 version that was a children's TV series?
I think that was called 'escape into night'
I remember it as being closer to the book than 'Paperhouse' and a bit more creepy."
