,Ender305,2008-02-12T14:22Z,"this has spyware in it, I'm not sure it has a virus though, because most keygens and cracks show up as viruses

scanned with trend micro internet security pro"
,Tyronian,2008-02-14T05:52Z,"1st of all, anyone who is dumb enough to rely on 1 virus scan is a fool, i used 3, 2 of which didnt find the virus, i used AVG and McAfee and Avira, AVG and McAfee failed to find it, but Avira bitch slapped it and then killed it. yeah, its a virus, no reports of anyone playing multiplayer or online for that matter on H2V xp"

,Anteludium_Noctam,2008-05-11T18:58Z,how come theres never a keygen for any halo game?
,rock2712,2008-05-17T03:07Z,wat does this even do and after u downloaded something how do u seed it
,ausloader,2008-05-18T03:33Z,"Scanned with Bitdefender and it found it as a virus, Backdoor.Agent.XYI . Plus to add to the suspicion i tried to Unrar it and there apparently is no archive. I knew that there is no crack for Halo 2 multiplayer yet, but i decided to give this one a try and I guess thats what you get. 

DOWNLOAD AT OWN EXPENSE "
,0satan0,2008-05-29T09:56Z,"its prob not a virus its prob just got fucking virus scripts,
so if you want to do this torrenting shit then get a decent AV (nod 32, KAV) one that doesnt have lots of false fucking alerts"
,Necroyupy989,2008-06-03T11:31Z,"When I tried to install this appication, after I choose my directory in y C drive, I get a error message saying ""access to an unnamed file was denied"". Somebody please help me. Add me at

Please somebody Help me, I really wanna play Halo 2 over LIVE. Thanks so much. =)"
,slasher1212,2008-06-04T14:28Z,hahaha this is not a viruse or trojen it as beacause tha anti viruse stuff says it is because it is a keygen
,ToreThePirate,2008-06-11T17:41Z,"***** NO VIRUS *****

But anti-virus programs may think so because it is a keygen"
,caveman734,2008-07-05T06:36Z,Theres no virus here and no keygen eather. This is an aplication that place a mini image of Halo pc cd (not Halo2 as it says) in the folder u wish to be able to run the halo 1.07 and play online by mounting the mds file on daemontools but... if u have a fake cd key on the game u will be kicked from the servers from time to time. Dont be naive ppl. Cheers
,03poppa,2008-07-16T20:48Z,Its NOT a keygen
,ineedcrysis,2008-11-12T11:21Z,Someone just find a keygen!
,Turbis,2009-02-03T16:15Z,"I HAVE CONFIRMED THIS IS A VIRUS READ BEFORE YOU CALL ME AN IDIOT

Okay, so I downloaded this on my secondary computer because of all of the warnings it had.
Downloaded fine.
The file I downloaded was an installation .exe that had me wondering ""Wtf? Maybe this really is a virus""
Double clicked it and it asked me where I wanted to install. I chose default ""C:\"".

During (!) the installation I get a message from avast that ""svhost"" is being replaced and it asked me if I wanted to deny or accept the change, I denied.

After the installation I thought I might aswell do a virus scan around the area of the files but the funny thing is when I started avast (when it doublechecks memory stuffs) it gives me the report 5 viruses is located in the memory thingy.

So I formatted the drive and decided to tell ya'll

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FILE IT IS A FUCKING VIRUS"
,HeriticHero,2009-07-20T04:59Z,Does this work on Vista too?
,dimi13beast,2009-12-25T01:53Z,">If it tries to replace svchost.exe,
>DONT INSTALL!

U cant kill the virus unless u wipe ur PC.

My suggestion is trust all the comments"
