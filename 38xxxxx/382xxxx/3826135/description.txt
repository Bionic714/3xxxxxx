Hello All Afterworld Fans in the US and ABROAD!

Welcome to Pack 2!
NOTE: The recaps for Locations 001-007 are included with Pack 1!
You can copy this into your Afterworld Pack 1 directory as they share
the same directory structure.

I bring you DVD Afterworld Goodness with out UTUBE Limitations.
The flvs you see on UTUBE are 320x200 (eww, unless you have a ipod video)
The flvs contained in this package are Native 480x270... which means 16:9 goodness!!

The .swf in this package are designed to make watching Afterworld a treat.
Like watching a video tape with the commercials edited out, they automatically 
play all episodes from a location, skipping the "I am Russel Shoemaker" intro
begining for all but the first episode, and jump straight to the meat of the
episode.
They bump the res to 720x405 (letterbox 720x480 = DVD native resolution!)

The .exe are "projector" versions of the .swf for those who dont have 
flash player 9 standalone installed.

Included in this package are the next 2 Locations including:

Louisville (Not yet showing on UTUBE... but included here IN ADVANCE!!!)
Nashville (Not yet showing on UTUBE... but included here IN ADVANCE!!!)

Enjoy and watch for additional "Packs" that I will release including additional episodes,
using this same directory structure.

NOTE: the .flv files are the actual videos and are REQUIRED.
They must be in the same directory structure or the .swf/.exe wont be able to find them

Thanks ALL
