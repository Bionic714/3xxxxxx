,saffado,2009-07-21T03:45Z,"Sorry guys, my question gonna sound stupid but I have problem to install & run the application. I dont know what means MOUNT IMAGE. This is all the Office 2007 prog? or just the Greek language (like a plug in appl)???? Someone can help me with some steps what to do?
 Thanks"
,ipod_frk,2009-07-22T21:02Z,"Thanks so MUCH! Downloaded in 3 hours flat, and that's supa fast 4 me xD

saffado, this is just the Greek language pack. If you'll install it, you'll be able to use it for proofing, spell checking, etc in Greek. It's NOT the entire Microsoft Office in Greek. I think you're talking about the Greek interface thing. If I'm right, you can download the interface free (and any other language besides) at the Office website. :)

Anyway, if you still want to install the language pack, follow these steps:

1. Install a prog that mounts images, if you don't already have one. ImgBurn is free, you can get it from their website: http://www.imgburn.com/

2. Insert an empty data CD.

3. Open ImgBurn.

4. Click the first option that says ""Write image file to disc""

5. At the top, where it says ""Please select a file..."" click the picture to the left that has a looking glass on top of a folder.

6. If you haven't unzipped the torrent before, do it now. Browse to & select the file ""O12MLPEL.iso""

7. Click the picture at the bottom-right ( image of CD on top of paper -> CD image ) to start burning.

8. Burning should take 5-15 mins, depending on your PC's speed. The CD will be ejected at the end of burning. Reinsert it. If you're using Vista, click the option ""Autorun"", or something to that equivalent.

9. The installation instructions are in Greek -- but I guess you'll have no problem following them. ;P

10. That's about it. If you've followed the above instructions correctly, you should have installed the Greek language pack properly.

If you have any more questions, feel free to post them! :)"
