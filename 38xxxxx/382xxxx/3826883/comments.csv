I'll pretend you didn't say that, and try not to be offended.

check my other ups.
I should have my parrot bite you."
,darklittleapartmentstudio,2007-10-03T00:34Z,"and I'm taking requests, what else do you folks want to see-?

you may be surprised, i may have it.

A lot of them, i ripped myself for my private collection, because they were not available as torrents or p2p- my upload of the original theatrical version of bladerunner, for instance.TRY TO FIND IT ANYWHERE ELSE.

this last time, it was a toss-up between Ninja Scroll, and Wicked City- I am pretty sure Wicked City has never been properly upped, but this film has much better status on imdb. And this copy is rare in spoken-english.

so what'll it be? horror- scifi,  anime , what?

let me know, and NO CHEESE.

I will upload the first reasonable request i can fulfill from my 595 gig collection. :)

only the best..."
,darklittleapartmentstudio,2007-10-03T01:20Z,"give me about half an hour , to create the torrent, and transfer it to my linux   :)

Some Love, from Dark Little Apartment Studios.
And, very good choice, by the way- Wicked City is far under-rated.

...and my parrot rarely bites...     ;)"

Thanks, nice parrot"
