,iaintnocop,2007-09-28T12:55Z,"Thanks Chris! A ""problem"" with Kaspersky sw is that the ""license"" one day suddenly becomes invalid because Kaspersky corp realizes that the key is blacklisted. Any soultion to this problem? "
,Chris_bh,2007-09-28T13:15Z,Hey iaintnocop. no i'm sorry... i'm running this with no problems... but i'll let u know if i'll figure out something :)
,iaintnocop,2007-09-28T13:42Z,"thanks, ill give it a try"
,iaintnocop,2007-09-28T14:17Z,"went like clock work, hope the good ppl at Kaspersky are understaffed until 2010"
,Chris_bh,2007-09-28T14:58Z,iaintnocop glad you liked it.... i'll let you know if i get any problems and how to solve them. :)
,deochar,2007-09-28T17:42Z,"I am going to download this too.
But I had a similar problem: the key suddenly becomes invalid after a couple of weeks. I had to uninstall it because none of the keys I had worked.
Hope this one runs fine.
Thanks for the upload Chris. You rock!"
,asromadk,2007-09-29T10:25Z,how do i use the crack ? 
,FTP1,2007-09-29T14:07Z,"There are two ways to employ the crack. Double click the crack file and follow the instructions (booting into Safe Mode method) or read the included Word doc (no need to boot into safe mode).

Great work Chris_bh - my Kaspersky updates again. Thank you!

Just one question: is self defense mode left switched off?"
,FTP1,2007-09-30T04:36Z,Can anyone confirm a problem on reboot where Kaspersky keeps on asking for the key?
,Chris_bh,2007-09-30T05:51Z,Yes FTP1 I just discovered that problem myself. It seems to me that the cracked dll file gets overriden on an update. The only solution I got right now is to crack the file again... in safe mode :( I'll let all you guys know if I find a more permanent solution. Sorry for the inconvenient...
,ostmaster,2007-09-30T11:24Z,"What dll?
There is only a ppl file, is it a dll?"
,arkimde,2007-09-30T13:35Z,my kaspersky 6.0 cant update some1 help?
,Jesso,2007-09-30T16:46Z,"Does anyone get badinfo error from this??
Cannot download!"
,sadox,2007-10-01T00:15Z,"after installing it, i have to update it. but after updating, the crack is balcklisted... so i do it again, and it says error.... plz help, or bring a new key, link. thanks"
,Chris_bh,2007-10-01T14:57Z,"ostmaster, sorry i meant the ppl file. sadox it's true that is blacklists the key after update so actually u have to crack it in safe mode everytime it updates... that's a bummer, sorry. I now tried to activte the trial version and then I'm gonna crack it before it expires and see if that works... the I only have to crack it once a month. I'll let u all know if it turns out fine."
,Chris_bh,2007-10-01T15:08Z,"Well well, I just tried to activate the trial verison and the crack it to see if u can activte the trial verison once more... failed to do so. I can still crack it everytime it updates, so I guess i'm back to square one... :( sorry..."
,welshpissead2k7,2007-10-14T17:07Z,"Worked a dream, simple to install on vista.

no trouble with the key and for the update, i installed it when i was in trial mode, before i entered the serial key, seemed to work for me. I'l let you kno if it becomes blacklisted. 
Cheers chris, nice upload"

Pleaase help"
,the-doctor,2008-07-02T07:21Z,"Dude...the crack isn't working for me, i tried everything, a notificatino of it being blacklisted keeps popping up. And... ican't update."
,jigx,2009-01-26T05:22Z,only 4 seeders??! wtf
,Tjockflesk,2009-01-29T15:18Z,"I downloaded it, but I have one question before I decide to install it.

Is Kaspersky Anti-Virus good?"
,tattooedmermaid,2009-02-16T23:16Z,"ok the first thing everyone needs to do is set the update to MANUAL!!! only update when it tells you that you have to! that will keep it from blacklisting as long as possible

Tjock - Kaspersky is the shit!  way better than McAfee and Norton!!  

i unfortunately have a different version  (7.0.1.321) and cant find a new key and my current one expires in like 13 days so i guess i will be downloading this version... 

REMEMBER PPL - SET UPDATES TO MANUAL AND ONLY UPDATE WHEN YOU HAVE TO!!  it will keep it from blacklisting longer i promise! AND KEEP ON SEEDING!!
*smooch*"
