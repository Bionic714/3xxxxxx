If not, how do I downgrade it to 1.5 again?"
,EXTER7,2007-10-07T01:02Z,"@Kvante:
You must have 3.52 M33-2 or later to install it since previous versions have a bug in the SCE updater that the 3.71 M33 installer uses."
,Kvante,2007-10-07T08:26Z,"Hi EXTER7!!

Thanks for aswering - not many people are kind to do that.

I upgraded my PSP to 3-40 OE-A and used the 3.02 OE-A to downgrade with the original 1.50 firmware from sony - without brick'ing my PSP - worked perfectly.

Now I have to upgrade the firmware to 3.71 (this torrent) - and hope that ""Ratchet & Clank - Size matters"" - will load without any problems (the 3.30 OE-A and 3.40 OE-A would not)."
,Kvante,2007-10-08T13:15Z,Great work - it work just f´great! The game Ratchet & Clank - Size Matters work without any trouble - I'M HAPPY!!!! ;o)

,dekkker,2007-10-11T21:52Z,is there a way to get this to work if you don't have a windows computer?
,MathewDematteo,2007-10-27T03:58Z,"@dekkker-
As long as you can copy the files to your PSP, it will work.  I use linux and just plug the USB cable into my laptop.  Then on the PSP menu, select Settings > USB Connection. Copy the files over and run them on your PSP.  Directions are usually included."
