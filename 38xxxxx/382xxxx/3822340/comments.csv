,agibaer,2007-09-29T16:43Z,"DARKPAWT:
Do you have episode 3x01 as well? Would be very nice if you could upload it!
Thanks!"
,darkpawt,2007-09-30T12:52Z,"Thanks.  Unfortunately, s03e01 (""Erase Chode"") has only aired once so far, and I didn't record it that night.  I'll be trying to record them every week, and will put up as many as I can.  It's only airing in Canada, but there appears to still also be a lot of interest in this show outside Canada.  Maybe SciFi will see that, and eventually pick up the third season."
