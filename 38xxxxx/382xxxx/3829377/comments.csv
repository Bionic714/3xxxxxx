this is pretty useless with one."
,Gomesh,2007-10-05T11:36Z,Please read what i wrote at the botom of comment.
,thoomz,2007-10-05T21:28Z,"Could please seed?
I would really appreciate it!"
,eisschrank,2007-10-06T07:35Z,"I see there is a zipped file included called: Adobe Design Suite Premium CS3 US [k] (Universal).app

I presume this is a viable crack for my Intel Mac, so do I still need a serial no.?
I would appreciate any installation guidance before proceeding as this is my first software torrent download.
Thanks."
,eisschrank,2007-10-06T09:58Z,"To answer my own question, and if it helps anyone else:
I only installed PhotoSop and Illustrator as they are all I need, from: Adobe Design Suite Premium CS3 Final (R).dmg
Set Little Snitch to deny connection to installed apps. to be on the safe side.
Then applied the crack to PS and Ai.
Works just fine and no serial was needed.
Now seeding again.
Big thanks to the uploader."
,Fredrokk,2007-10-06T11:35Z,So what's the difference from earlier versions of CS3? It still need the activation crack and cannot therefore be updated...
,pinogrigo,2007-10-06T16:58Z,Does anyone know if the windows keygens will work with this? Any help will be much appreciated!
,superbad1,2007-10-07T05:14Z,isn't fireworks included in this package?
,nunsoap,2007-10-07T20:41Z,"Apparently there is a version of CS3 that does not require activation, only a serial number. If you set little snitch and punch in the serial it's supposed run the program without activation. I'm hoping that this is that version. Can anyone verify this?"
,zombies8mynabrs,2007-10-08T00:54Z,it says i need a serial number for photoshop. please tell me what it is.
,Gomesh,2007-10-08T14:33Z,"1. Please extract file
Adobe Design Suite Premium CS3 US [k] (Universal).app.zip

2. It will be file Adobe Design Suite Premium CS3 US [k] (Universal).
Open it.

3. I think it will be wery easy for you to understand."
,Fredrokk,2007-10-10T17:34Z,"Well this is obviously not a corporate edition that will not need activation. You need a serial and the crack fixes the apps to bypass activation. It is exactly the same version as the earlier ones... Works most of the time, but you will not be able to update any of the apps after using the activation crack."
,Gomesh,2007-10-12T15:24Z,"I found these in iSerial Reader.

im using the new crack for leopard thats out on this site

i installed first time with the crack on this file and it didnt work. tried using the crack, got annoyed and opened photoshop and got 30day trial and the like... sohad to uninstall it and all associated files.

then sat through another install but this time using the new crack it seems to be flying true.

make sure yu open the first icon, to enter its folder. then drag the identifier icon onto the crack for it to work.

hope this clears things up for those having trouble.

,c_krusty,2008-01-02T01:35Z,"problems with photoshop activation

installed the whole suite, applied the patches and everything is working fine - except photoshop. PS says I have a 30day grace period after entering a serial from iSerial (need activation).

All progs except photoshop have grey activation/registration options in the help menu -  so I assume theres something wrong with the patch. 

Anyone got ideas? Thanks guys,"

May slow it down though??
,verblood,2008-01-02T22:56Z,"Update:  GOT IT TO WORK!!!!

My steps:  
1.  DL'd this file above. (took a while, but eventually came through)

2.  DL'd this file:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3873944/Adobe_Design_Suite_Premium_CS3_[k]_Crack_Leopard.zip

3.  Unwrapped/opened the first file, opened up all the other unwrapped/unmounted files in there.

4.  Used the setup file to install the entire suite.  (found it in one of the mounted folders for the entire suite)

5.  opened up the 2nd torrent above.

6.  went into applications, opened the photoshop folder and dragged the icon into the (k) window that the 2nd torrent opened.

7.  waited for it to unscramble/setup/crack/ the program - (took a good minute for me)

8.  double clicked on the new and improved photoshop icon and walla - it works!!!

no problemo.

will now try with the rest of the files.. thanks to everyone in the previous posts!!"
