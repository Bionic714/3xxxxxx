It has been over a year since the acclaimed debut      
release of Frozen Ghost's 'Just One Bite'.                
And now Cape Town born Barry Wynne is ready to reveal        
the second frozen installment in a new chapter, now      
released on Yabai Records, called 'Edible Technique'.    
Having since received releases on labels such as          
Yabai, MMD, Noize Conspiracy, and Afrogalactic, as      
well as just recently compiling MMD Records V/A        
compilation 'Cold Conclusion', Frozen Ghost has been      
exposing his new live set, coast to coast in              
countries such as Japan, South Africa, and Israel.          
Edible Technique features 9 'full-flavoured' dance      
floor killers including a potent remix of Hiyarant's      
'Red Coat', the popular 'Ned's Mental', and an edible        
new version of 'Frozen Toast'. Also featured is the      
crunchy 'Control Freak' by new project, Dirty Motion  
aka Frozen Ghost vs. Hiyarant.                            
'Edible Technique' showcases a new refined style to          
Frozen Ghost, whether varying from the dark and          
twisted, to the brain-bending supercharger              
psychedelics, there is something here for everyone.      
So crank up your system and dig your teeth into          
Frozen Ghost's 'Edible Technique'.                      
We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying.
MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands !!
You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout.
Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much!
Our releases are for scene internal use so
KEEP THEM OFF P2P AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES!!
So much for now ...
meet ya @ the next party ... somewhere.
MYCEL - sending lamers to /dev/null since 2003
We bow our heads to our old friends.    
Deep respect to you!              
Also we would like to greet all of the      
still alive quality scenegroups/sceners!    
Ascii done with love to my lil d3vil.
