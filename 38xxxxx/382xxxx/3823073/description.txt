BRAD

History
Brad formed officially in 1992 (though the members had been playing together for a long time before that) and in 1993 released their debut album Shame. Recorded in roughly 20 days, with many tracks taken from in-studio jam sessions, Shame is an eclectic mix of styles and a raw, vital recording. Its track "20th Century" was a minor hit in the UK.

Their follow-up album, Interiors, in 1997 was much more polished. It was accompanied by a tour of the US in that year, as well as a small tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1998. The single from Interiors, "The Day Brings", features Mike McCready from Pearl Jam on lead guitar.

A third album, Welcome to Discovery Park, was released in 2002. It mixes the rawness of Shame and the polished, produced sound of Interiors. Currently the band is working on a fourth album. In April 2005 they released an album of unreleased and incomplete Brad and Satchel tracks called Brad vs. Satchel.
