Just when you thought youâ??d never need another copy of George Harrisonâ??s wonderful â??All Things Must Passâ?? LPâ?¦.

This needledrop that Iâ??ve just completed, and am sharing here, is my first experience working with Japanese red vinyl. The LPs used here are in superb condition and Iâ??m very impressed with how quiet this vinyl is. I picked this Toshiba LP up about a year or so ago but had not spent any time comparing it to other releases.

As many of you may be aware, the Doc Ebbetts release of this title from last year is sourced from a U.S. pressing. Out of curiosity, I decided to transfer my Japanese Toshiba red wax ATMP and see if there was much of a difference between it and the U.S. pressing as heard on DESS. There is. 

Naturally, comparing two different pressings from two different audio systems is a tenuous proposition at best. There are just too many variables that can color the audio traveling from the turntable to the hard drive. What you can rely on is the fact the DESS makes it a point to avoid EQ and N/R and give us flat transfers so we hear the LP as it's intended. That has always been my goal as well. I prefer to remove only the pops & clicks and then get out of the way and let the vinyl speak for itself.

This Toshiba LP was transferred at 96kHz/32-bit float (using the same gear as in my other needledrops). Using Adobe Audition, I did what little pop/click removal was needed, in manual mode. No EQ or N/R has been incorporated here. When ready, the audio was dithered down to 16-bit wav files and then those files were converted to flac files for this torrent.

This transfer has been configured over two discs in the same fashion as the DESS release. In fact, I also borrowed Doc's artwork and have modified it to reflect the differences between the US & Toshiba versions.

Please be aware that there is a DVD-A version of this now available using 24-bit audio. You can find it at: http://www.thepiratebay.org/tor/3822969 

I encourage anyone who dlâ??s this to compare it to other versions you have. Explore it.
 
Good luckâ?¦
