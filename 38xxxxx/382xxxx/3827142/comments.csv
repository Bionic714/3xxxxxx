,i.r.pierat,2007-10-02T23:31Z,"@ kef71:

Sorry for putting this comment in the wrong place, but I never got a response to my question/comment on your Star Trek TNG Season 1 torrent (which I've seeded well past 1:1 now BTW :D .)  If you could take a moment to reply there it would be much appreciated.  And thank you very much for these awesome ST releases!"
[T],kef71,2007-10-03T08:15Z,i.r.pierat: I think the answer to your question is 'yes'. 
,talkinghead,2007-10-06T21:43Z,"Thank you kef71 for your fantastic Star Trek uploads!
Do you think you can upload just disc 6 Season 1 of Star Trek Voyager?
That disc is not from the Voyager series it's a Star Trek TOS disc. It's the TOS episodes ""Arena"" & ""The city on the edge of forever"" on disc 6. Thanks again!"
,alenkr,2007-10-06T22:24Z,"Plese seed !!! 

Don't go after download 100%"
,away1,2007-10-07T12:30Z,"@ talkinghead

the disc that was uploaded by kef71 (disc 6 voyager) is the correct one. Because there were only 16 episodes in season one they added  some unrelevant material to come to a total of 6 discs."

,alenkr,2007-10-08T16:13Z,"Almost 100 % and wait for season 4

,away1,2007-10-10T09:17Z,"I have a ratio of 2 now so I'll stop seeding this one during daytime. I'll monitor the progress and will seed every day between approximately 24.00 and 08.00, until the next seeson starts."
[T],kef71,2007-10-12T08:29Z,Thank you guys for helping to seed. Season 4 is coming the 15th of October. ;o)

,jack.tremols,2008-11-08T13:17Z,"en fait la version Francaise n'existe plus dans cette saison 3 alors qu'elle est bien presente dans les saisons 1 et 2. The fact is there's no French Version in this ""3rd Season"" o Mister kef71 (nor spoken language nor subs). They were in the 1st and the 2nd season"
,jack.tremols,2008-11-18T06:11Z,"please kef71, there is no french langage or subs in these, but the are steel listed in your comments. why ?
