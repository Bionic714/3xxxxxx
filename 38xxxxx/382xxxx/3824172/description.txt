The original adorable moppet, Shirley Temple, is an orphan who, along with her beautiful older sister, is adopted by a Park Avenue bachelor millionaire (John Boles). Staying true to her roots, though, the curly-haired cutie returns to the orphanage for some rousing song-and-dance numbers with her friends. Irving Cummings directs this family-friendly musical romance that features one of Temple's biggest hits, "Animal Crackers in My Soup."
