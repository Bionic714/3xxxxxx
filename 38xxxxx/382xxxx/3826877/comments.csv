,floatablepie,2007-10-02T21:56Z,"When I get to the region select screen all the options just make the screen freeze green, any ideas?"
,scarbot,2007-10-03T02:46Z,"floatablepie, I think the roms are NTSC and maybe your TV needs to be set to this. I select NTSC 480p and the games I have tried work."
,SPECIALWii,2007-10-03T05:28Z,hey ;-) how to play Mace - The Dark Age?? The game begining not :( in anyway region goes not :(
,scarbot,2007-10-03T08:13Z,"Good question, just tried Mace myself and I can't get it to work either."
,SPECIALWii,2007-10-03T16:41Z,hey scarbot is the compilation disc created of you? do you know with which program disc were provided? *thanks*
,SPECIALWii,2007-10-03T16:42Z,mario kart 64 is so special! in the comparison to pal the version this version runs around some faster; -) perfect:)
,Miroch78,2007-10-03T23:46Z,"Are you supposed to burn this on a CD? Nero says it wont fit on one, and if you burn it to a DVD it won't play. How do you get this to run? I have a PAL Wii with Wiikey."
,scarbot,2007-10-04T02:27Z,"Special Wii?I found this on another torrent site, I wish I new how it was made."
,SPECIALWii,2007-10-04T02:44Z,"scarbot, okay thanks for the information :) Miroch78 burn this on a DVD(i have DVD-R Verbatim, 8x speed). With nero."
,wmunn,2007-10-04T12:06Z,"On mine this disc boots, you select a game, hit start, then select y for ntsc mode, then I get a green screen and it just sits there. never loads a game. Any ideas what happened?"
,SPECIALWii,2007-10-04T15:35Z,"wmunn, click X for PAL ;)"
,wmunn,2007-10-05T23:00Z,"Will selecting PAL on my NTSC wii and NTSC television even work? 

I have tried PAL games on other systems and the screen flipped out."
,Givijoarna,2007-10-06T17:04Z,"a little question,,, is it possible to get the N64 game Perfect dark to work on the wii??? i have tryed the gc tool but i cant get it to work :( it goes to the boot screen, but when i choose region then the screen turns black :( so does someone know?

,IzC,2007-10-27T23:36Z,"My Wii doesn't even recognize this disc when I burn it the same way I burn all my other games. (ImgBurn)

I've got PAL WiiKey on my Wii."
,Cissa21,2007-11-04T13:46Z,"I have the same problem as IzC, pleas help :) "
,badachew,2007-12-12T04:01Z,"1) To make the games work on a US console, press X to select the Pal screen settings, don't ask me why but that's how it works
2) This ""includes"" the GCOS emulator which is Gamecube Operating system. IF you have a Wiikey it's already installed and you just need to run your config disk to access it as for the other chips I have no clue.

but after selecting the pal display (pressing X) it works fine on my NTSC console with a legit Wiikey 1.9g beta"

and yet you do 
. . . 
if you don't like the stupid questions don't read the comments section!
besides it's a only a stupid question when your asking it for a second time, all your doing is making people afraid to ask simple questions, How else do you expect people to learn?!?!"
,IzC,2007-12-19T13:39Z,"I've now managed to get the GCOS started and I've chosen a game (I've tried all different games) but after I choose a game I get a message saying that it can't find a memory card in slot A so therefor it can't save the game and then it asks me to continue anyway I press yes and then it says you can't save are you sure you want to continue i press ok and then some message pops up and i press ok again (there's only 1 button and that is ok). and after this I get right back to the message saying there's no memory card in slot A. 

This loops for all eternety and I can't get pass this freaking message... Any help?

I don't want to go and buy a memory card just for mario kart. then I can just as well buy the game from the nintendo site...."
,davido94,2008-01-05T00:39Z,PLEASE SEED THOSE WHOM ARE DONE
,raceryan,2008-01-15T13:27Z,"works good.  Burn ISO image to a DVD.  (I use NERO) 

The on screen directions are wrong.  For PAL select A, for NTSC select X.  The only problem is the sound quality is buggy. Otherwise works good!"
,kleinishere,2008-02-27T02:51Z,"I have an Argon installed in my system and am trying to get this to work. The disc is read fine it just loads the GCOS menu with nothing else. What is supposed to boot up and any ideas on how to fix this

please help, thanks!"
,ferret09,2008-04-16T02:55Z,"im so pissed..... the toxic waste level freezes at the end boss EVERY time.... what the hell....? does anyone else have this problem? im wondering if i need to re-download this. cuz mario kart doesnt work either... well... it does, but it is ansanely glitchy. anyone elso with these problems?"
,ferret09,2008-04-17T04:00Z,by the toxic waste level im refering to a map on starfox
,Jenli,2008-10-20T21:25Z,"Looks good, going to burn it and test, how did you do this disc? Wich program did you use? I found many n64 roms and want to do an own disc..."
,rasku,2008-11-23T20:28Z,"you can get past that message loop and play without mem card by  pushing the buttons and looping the message lika crazy after a while you get into the game. it was fast with some and took longer with others.
but i think you can get a secondhand gc memcard pretty cheap.

my problem is that the save slots for mario 64 is ereased every time you shut it off. it works in ocarina. anyway to fix it?
mario is worthless without save function.
???????
!!"
,rasku,2008-11-23T20:31Z,and mariokart is glitchy with 3p but not very with 2player mode.
,mittlivsomdan,2008-12-11T18:07Z,"Hello, this game doesn't work for me. 
Do I have to have a Gamecube memory card? And do I have to have a Gamecube control? Or can I use a Wii Classic control? "
,mittlivsomdan,2008-12-11T18:09Z,"Btw, when I put the disc in, it comes up a Gamecube screen, where it seems to be 2 options, either ""boot dvd"", or ""credits"". But from here I cant do anything, none of the buttons works on my Wii remote. "
