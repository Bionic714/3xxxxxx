,lothlann88,2007-10-17T20:37Z,"Right i think the CD key is 11111-11111-11111-11111 

OR if thats the wrong number just use all 1s.

Can someone confirm that works please?"

,lothlann88,2007-11-14T17:08Z,Just take the fable.exe from the crack folder and replace the one in the installed folder. Then it should work no probs.
