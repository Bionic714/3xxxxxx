,Da Pungvin !,2007-09-29T17:26Z,It's not the latest crack. When i run it says that i must have version 0.751
,smoketwojoints,2007-09-29T17:54Z,"Thats weird, I just tried it again, and it's working fine for me. :/ Are you sure you're using 0.892?"
,Devryl,2007-09-30T04:54Z,Thanks for this. I have no way of buying the game and this is the only way to play it.
,smoketwojoints,2007-09-30T10:02Z,"No problem, glad to see it doesn't just work for me then. :D"
,Taunts,2007-09-30T11:10Z,Really good job ^^ Keep it up! But just wondering is there some kinda way to get the mods to work with this crack? Really want to play with a plot ^^Or that pirate mod. Please reply.
,smoketwojoints,2007-09-30T13:23Z,"They don't work? As far as I know you should just be able to pick another mod in the drop down box where it says 'Native', once you've applied the crack. I haven't tried any mods with this version but they worked in earlier (cracked) versions."
,Taunts,2007-09-30T16:35Z,"Sorry, thats my fault. U just need the right version to use the mods. So still no mods for .892 ^^"

,smoketwojoints,2007-10-07T09:45Z,"Hey. You need to open it in a torrent program, I use utorrent - http://www.utorrent.com/

The crack isn't for making the game run, it's for getting rid of the message that won't let you play past level 6. Just unzip the file the readme should explain how to apply it. :)"
