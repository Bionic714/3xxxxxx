,redhammer,2007-10-10T04:47Z,"Helloooo???? are u there???? I downloaded directvobsub, i downloaded realplayer, i downloaded real alternative 1.51, exactly like in manual, but whenever i go to play, and then filter, directvobsub is simply not there!!! are u there??? helloOO??"
,redhammer,2007-10-10T04:47Z,"yeah well, even worse it is that no subtitles on exactly YOUR movies works even tho i have realplayer, real alternative 1.51, directvobsub, or whatever crappy selfpromoting spyware u want us to install. until I get a firm answer on why ure putting up movies with non working subtitles (How many of us here speak japanese? no one? didnt think so.) (Also, who here got subtitles working? anyone? care to tell us how? nah, didnt think so.) Hence why I keep my right to have a big mouth till opposite proven."

,777shanktime777,2008-05-01T16:26Z,"FAIL for .rmvb format
JamesKees: use .avi or mpeg2, this format is useless"
,tuzken,2008-07-07T03:30Z,"Man thanks for sharing, but i can't open any of the 3 RMVB files... When i right-Click them, the only options are to send ti Groove or Open with. When i click open with and select Real Player, it gives me an error..."
,joynarc,2008-08-05T13:09Z,"Grab the Combined Community Codec Pack and install it, then you'll be able to play this in Media Player Classic."
,tribal13,2008-11-05T01:19Z,"I don't know-What is WRONG with you moaners, can you not follow simple instructions? Look make sure you download the codec pack James suggests. Do you know with a little common sense you can play it on windows media player( I can and do. James & John busted a gut for you you and blew his p.c. He said that is why he no longer uploads but with a whinging load of idiots who probably upload very little anyway I wonder if that was his real reason. And download vobsub/virtual dub to add subs of your own. VERY simple -or is it."
,yulabox,2009-01-15T23:20Z,fuck you and your stupid rmvb format.
,meanpitbull,2009-02-10T17:45Z,"I also had problem with playin, opening, & renaming these files, i got them to work using these simple steps:

1. rename each individual folder
2. rename title of each movie
3. remember to rename srt to match rmvb in order for subs to work.

For me i just deleted all the extra words and just left the actual title. and all worked fine was able to right click mouse over movie and got all options, and movie played fine."
,wb0_8,2009-08-05T12:06Z,You are the best. Thanks for all the great movies and the time you took to put them up. Like some other people I also had problems with this download. I even download the the Return... twice because it did not work. Thanks to the suggestions of others. Renaming the file made it work for some reason. Thanks again
