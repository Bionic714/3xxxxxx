,godzil,2007-10-02T01:30Z,5a559 is already seeded here on tpb : http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3816089/Leopard_Client_9a559
,BuzzMe,2007-10-03T05:05Z,"But 3816089 is not the original image, but rather the image of a HD that the image was restored to.  I'd rather have a copy of the original DVD."
,pellypels,2007-10-03T12:35Z,"One serious problem with this build; There's NO playback of any WMV or WMA content in Safari or any other browser for that matter.

Flip4Mac does'nt work in any shape or version.

Only thing you'll see is Quicktime logos with questionmarks all over the place!"
,romainbessuges,2007-10-03T14:04Z,"Anyway, can someone seed the windows session of the 10.5 disc, because all the previous beta releases lack the bootcamp drivers. So it is yet impossible to play with the fast OS switching :(

In order to make this clearer, could a developper boot on win with the leopard DVD, copy the drivers package and upload it here?"
,AK[AK],2007-10-10T22:36Z,REFLECTIVE DOCK?????
,Espionage724,2007-10-26T13:33Z,"is it safe to assume that this is not ""Hackintosh"" based?"
,bra34b,2007-10-30T18:15Z,"Please, someone with Leopard 9a559 installed email me Dock.app.  Thank you in advance.

,bra34b,2007-10-30T18:19Z,You can find Dock.app in System>Library>CoreServices
,bra34b,2007-10-31T17:52Z,"Nevermind.  Someone already sent me Dock.app.

,klumsyninja,2008-01-08T16:10Z,"Hey, Can anyone verify that this is the real deal and works?

The problem with comments is that people only make them when they screw up...

I want to see comments from people who have successfully dl'd and applied it..

TY"
