This is a two dvd iso set of 12 Oz. Mouse seasons one and two, edited for continuous playback. I took a torrent containing both seasons and edited out the intro?s and outro?s (except for the ones that seemed important) hastily in iMovie and burned it in iDVD with chapters and menus and stuff. So it plays like a three+ hour movie with both discs.

There is an official 12 Oz. Mouse dvd in the works. If you like it and have the means, show your support by ordering it from adultswim.com. It will no doubt be far superior to this both in quality and editing, and it will keep shows like this on the air (dvd sales helped get Futurama and Family Guy picked up again).

Please enjoy-
