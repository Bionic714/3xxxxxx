,sunawavi,2007-10-03T22:25Z,Large swarm in Statistical Lock (therefore moves VERY slowly).  Faster connections need to drop off for a few hours at a time and then come back in to stir things up...otherwise will continue at less than 10 kbps....  Only one initial seed and too many trying all at once.  Have patience and use common sense to break the lock.  You won't get it any faster by just staying on and keeping the lock going.  (Old) DVD DECRYPTER program will encode from PAL to NTSC (for North America).

 BASTARD LEFT 300 PEOPLE AT 99.9% --2MB SHORT OF FINISHING.   DECRYPTED ANYWAY:  A UDP OUTGOING SIGNAL WAS ATTEMPTED BY THE DECRYPTER PROGRAM AND ISO CREATED DOESN'T PLAY.  THIS IS A SCAM AND A WASTE.   "
