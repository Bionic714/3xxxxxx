[T],ooStevo,2008-08-09T01:48Z,"FXG do good rips,but most of their films have this weird frame rate problem where it slightly skips when you have a sweeping/moving camera shot.I guess thats why they seem to have dissapeared from the tpb.Oh well."

,aratron_x,2011-01-04T07:02Z,"While many of you hate the movie, I think it was more entertaining than Resident Evil Resurrection.  But they needn't do that film grain crap.  There are many real grindhouse movies that have good picture quality."
