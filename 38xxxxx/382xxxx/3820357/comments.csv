,grain77,2008-11-23T14:25Z,thanks very much! .. used to be a huge orbital fan.. then i think they kinda lost it. I heard this is great tho. 
,grain77,2008-11-26T00:13Z,"ok.. i've come across this kind of trick before. The Mp3s play with a little skip in them every minute or so, so you get a good preview but if you like you'll go out and buy the album cause you could never listen to this properly.

Clever promotional trick. Thing is, if I like it, and the artist has the cop-on to release on vinyl, I will buy it, no matter how great the quality of the free mp3 is.

This kind of crap is just annoying. So annoying in fact, that I didn't get to hear the entire album before I had to turn it off because it was so irritating to have all those skips...
