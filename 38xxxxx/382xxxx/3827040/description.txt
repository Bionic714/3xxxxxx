Fuel is an American alternative rock/post-grunge band formed by friends Carl Bell, Jeff Abercrombie and Brett Scallions in 1989. Originally from Tennessee, Fuel moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they played local Pennsylvania bars and nightclubs. Their first EP Porcelin was released in 1996, and sold well locally, spawning a small radio hit with â€œShimmer.â€ The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sonyâ€™s 550 imprint, which released their second EP, Hazelton, the following year. The bandâ€™s full length debut, Sunburn, came out in 1998. Shimmer was again included, and almost became a Top 40 hit, while the other singles (â€œBittersweet,â€ â€œJesus or a Gun,â€ â€œSunburnâ€) received some airplay. After laying low for two and a half years, Fuel came back with their second album, Something Like Human, in 2000, and scored a Top 40 hit with â€œHemorrage (In My Hands)â€ (#17), as well as going platinum with the album. A third album, Natural Selection, came out in 2003, and was another big seller.
