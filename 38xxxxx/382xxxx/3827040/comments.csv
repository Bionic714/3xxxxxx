,Rated-R-Superstar,2008-05-27T20:41Z,"You sit there and call Penit a freeloader... Um, hello jackass, are you paying for any of this? Everything on here is free, and I bet you've downloaded shit loads more than Penit. So for you to sit there and call someone else a freeloader when you spend half your life sat here illegally downloadong shit for free, makes you a complete retarded CUNT... and a homo. Every person on here is a freeloader, including me and you!"

It's almost impossible to buy these CDs in Norway, but I'll buy them if I see them for sure."
