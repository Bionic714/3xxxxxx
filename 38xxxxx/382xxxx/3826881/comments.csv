,DeadlyBro,2007-10-06T16:52Z,Mattias360 you need a modded psp. downgrade ur 2.80firmware to 1.5 then upgrade to 3.40oe-a (mod). im running at 3.52m33 which i think is much better. and McGangsta-kev you need a usb cord and then go to psp
,smo01,2007-12-02T10:27Z,what is the best firmware to use and can u give me a link to 1.5
,rrpostal,2007-12-02T20:25Z,"If you're too lazy to  look up this stuff yourself, why should anyone bother doing the work for you. There are 10,000 guides to modding your PSP, why make someone else find them for you if you can't be bothered to go to google or even the search link above. Sorry, it's just a peave of mine. Sometime's I need help with stuff too, but I TRY to look on my own first."
