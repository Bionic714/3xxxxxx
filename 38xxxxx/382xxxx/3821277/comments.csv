And so far, it sounds good, altough it doesn't sound like GnR on some tracks but what can you say? Music evolves, so does man."
,kornchild2002,2008-02-13T22:29Z,"It's not a problem that Rose has evolved, the problem is that he had de-evolved into a pathetic excuse for a musician.  He is nothing more than a former shell of himself.  He sucks and his music sucks.  Too bad he couldn't find success unlike other members of GnR."
,pantera6993,2008-03-09T22:01Z,"Well, at least he still tries to stay out there and doesn't just cop out when he gets a little older. You guys are right, he isn't as good as he once was, but the easiest solution to this would be to not download this, not buy the CD, and just stick to what YOU think sounds good. I think this is pretty good considering how much time has passed."
