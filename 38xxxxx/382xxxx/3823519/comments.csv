,Sathrax,2008-12-08T17:37Z,"Hey I did what you said I'm pretty sure I followed it to the letter, except for the path part that was iffy, i couldnt find the link so I just extraced from the .zip into my Soul Reaver directory. And YES i set it to compatibility mode for windows 98, and I get the same BS error the other peopleare getting. It starts running then crashes. whats wrong with it?"
,Sathrax,2008-12-08T17:38Z,"And anazyr, I hope you know that a .img file is to be used with Daemon tools or alchohol, or something that can mount Images. Thats how you use them"
,Anazayr,2008-12-21T09:34Z,"I solved with 7zip,but thx anyway.

New problem:I had the original CD,and with the torrent,happened same thing:the characters are speaking like a bunch of retards from the kidden garden,and i turned on that thing.What to do?

I'm desperate cuz i love this franchise.I completed BO BO2 SR2 and Defiance,and u see,this is the only one i didnt finished,cuz it drives me nuts when i play and wait like 15 min for a cutscene."

,Jarreth29,2011-10-11T20:22Z,"Hey guys
I just install this soul reaver and try everything they say but nothing works, the Kain2.exe still bugs.
I checked in internet about the file that fails ""winplay.dll"" and it says that is so old (windows 95) that it won't work on fast machines.
It took me some time to figure out and ""Voila!"" I found it.
I'm using windows XP so I dont know the way to get it done in Vista or W7 but I think you'll  all find it.
1. right click on desktop to get into graphic properties
2. choose settings Tab
3. At the bottom choose Avanced
4. Choose Troubleshoot Tab
5. Change Hardware acceleration to the third point starting from None. Is the one that says: ""Disable all DirectDraw and Direct3D accelerations, as well as all cursor... bla, bla, bla.... DirectX accelerated applications""

I hope it works for all of you even the ones with vista and W7.
Enjoy"
,Jarreth29,2011-10-12T01:31Z,"Forgot to say that I install just the patch.
The crack doesn't work.
I play with the image mounted on magicIso."
,Seere,2012-02-18T19:52Z,"Just so you know this IS working, install, apply 1.2 patch, crack, profit."
