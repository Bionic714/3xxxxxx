same file dumbass"
,gorillaz3d,2007-11-15T23:23Z,"Glad you guys liked it sorry it was slow at the beginning but for a first torrent it is looking good, thanks to everyone.

For those struggling to make it a genuine updateable version,

Once you install it, open word or any other office application and check for updates.

Go to the website and let it run the genuine advantage check.

Once thats done and it tells your copy is not genuine, then copy the dll file into your system 32 folder.

Run the update from an office application again and it should pass as genuine.

Those having trouble with the launcher inserting the serial automatically just wait for it when it gets to that point where it asks for the cd key, it can take up to a minute or 2 on some pcs.

Enjoy
Thanks everyone
Peace"

This was my first torrent dl.  If you're rather new too and can't get files to open and work you want to make sure you have two types of programs to extract files.  One to get your torrent files to download and extract and another to unzip .rar, .iso, and other files.  Otherwise you won't get to the apps."
