Champions League

Stuttgart vs. F.C Barcelona 

Recorded using a TDT tuner and then compressed into Divx. A very intense match. Ronaldinho was back after 4 matches without playing with the team and did a great job. Stutgart though showed an amazing phisical strength pressed very well during the whole match. Next F.C Barcelona Match against Atletico de Madrid (7-10-07)
