,FlightPirate,2007-10-02T08:29Z,fucking assholes that dont seed!
,troppo1,2007-10-02T16:25Z,"Wouldnt it be easier to kindly point out his error, tell him how to seed and be nice to the guy, than ripping his head off.
You get faster results with a kind word and a big gun than with a kind word."

,toddw,2007-10-05T08:13Z,"Looks like 4X-AXG, has shit for brains... ripping into the guy because your to dammed impatient to wait for this, has done nothing but prevent the rest of us from getting this... here's an idea 4X-AXG, why don't pull your head out your ass- dig the shit out your ears and be a little bit more considerate... you maybe surprised of the positive results it will bring.

You dumb ass !!"
,dxbandit,2007-10-05T08:29Z,"well i take it condor has said screw it i guess, its a dam shame considering that he has prolly downloaded a shit load of stuff from everyone else here, yet he is gonna let a few bad comments ruin it for the rest of us, thats just as bad as the people that make the bad comments,

if you let internet comments get to you and cause you not to share, thats just sad and you dont need to be here in the first place,  "

,Condor707,2007-12-13T07:43Z,"dxbandit,

for your information I have been uploading. I see that you aren't sharing any files, which is interesting. Next time you decide to start bitching remember that this is a file SHARING program, not a file TAKING program. Now who was it that was saying something about being selfish???"
