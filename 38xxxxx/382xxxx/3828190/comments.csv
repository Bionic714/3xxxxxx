My computer can't recognize the shape of the files, so is there some way to change the VOB. files shape to AVI. shape? Or is there some way to play the files as they are now? And if there is some way to do that, does the same way work for the other animes you've put here? Thanks very much."
,melfice26,2007-10-04T08:53Z,"IFO, BUP and VOB are standard DVD files.
Just burn them with a program of your choice.
Select in your burning program that you want to burn a DVD movie.
You'll see 2 folders.
AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS
Just drag and drop the files into the VIDEO_TS folder, and click burn. That's all to it.
If you want to play from hard disk, install nero showtime, WinDVD, or some other playback software. Then rightclick and select source/play from folder.
Select the folder VIDEO_TS you downloaded end it will play the DVD.
