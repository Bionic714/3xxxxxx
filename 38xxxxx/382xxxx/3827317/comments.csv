,zacharythax,2008-01-24T16:00Z,"FFF,. you are my hero! That review was better than the movie itself! Because the only torrent I could find was French language (and the French would flip their wigs over this one) I went ahead and did the right thing and bought the DVD BECAUSE of having downloaded the bittorrent. It's a great DVD from the always great Something Wierd and, really, if you download an outstanding movie from them, buy it and support Mike Vraney. He really deserves it. 

I loved the lab techs, too and their expression ""the chemical caponization."" When this movie was first released in the 80's, (and I had a VHS copy of it for years) it was described I think in a Fangoria article on Jeff Hogue, as the guy turning into a giant capon(!?) 

Anyway, in my town, (Cola, SC) we have a dedicated Psychotronic film devotee cult who have guerrilla outdoor screenings on a regular basis. Where did you read the Steve Hawkes interview?"
