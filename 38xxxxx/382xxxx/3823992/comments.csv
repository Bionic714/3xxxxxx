,psychosmurf,2007-10-29T03:45Z,I use this quite extensively in my video authoring business; it's an awesome tool that was well worth the money (I own my own copy).  You'll find it quite a user friendly and powerful piece of software despite its small footprint. I Highly recommend it; more than worth your time if you do a lot of video editing.
