Another hard to find song. Best Christmas song ever!
--------------------------------
 We're gonna have a gothic christmas; that is what we'll do 
We're gonna have a gothic christmas; hope you'll have one too 
Santa's going to wear a black dress just for me and you. 
Santa's going to grunt in latin and slay a dragon or two. 

Rudolph, he will change his name 
'Cause rudolph just sounds pretty lame. 
Now we'll call him Ragnagord, the evil reindeer overlord. 
His nose it shall be red no more. 
It will be blackened to the core. 
His eyes will glow an evil glow to guide the chariot through the snow. 

We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 

We're gonna have a gothic christmas; that is what we'll do. 
We're gonna have a gothic christmas; hope you have one too. 

We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
We want to wish you a gothic christmas. 
Hope you'll have a gothic christmas too.
