1 help, I'm having 256 kbps internet broadband connection in India. My issue is,

100 MB file takes 1 hour for download
So that Single CD movies take 7-8 hours &
Double CD movies take 16-18 hours.
Also seeding takes so much time.

Here in my country, due to power/internet problems i can't able to finish the downloads expected time.

I'm using uTorrent. In this program, on Speed tab, @ grid It shows 27-29 kB/s as maximum.

Is there any solutions to reduce the time? It will b helpful 4 me.

Thanks"
