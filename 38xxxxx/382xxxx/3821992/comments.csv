,Quicksilver_Johny,2009-02-05T23:34Z,"Thanks for uploading, but the sound quality it extremely bad. Sounds as if it has been encoded to a lower bitrate and then transcoded up (i.e.: artifacts everywhere, extremely noticeable)"

,phrend,2010-07-05T11:48Z,"I don't usually comment, but the sound quality of these MP3's is pretty low. It sounds like the bass is cranked way up, and there is a lot of distortion.

I downloaded another torrent of this album and it had the same issue, so they must have both come from the same source.

:("
,Tephan,2010-07-30T16:15Z,The sound is absolutely HORRIBLE on this torrent. Not even worth the download. You simply can't listen to it.
,FangsPierce,2010-10-31T22:34Z,please seed! :]
