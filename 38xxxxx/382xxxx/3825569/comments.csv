,nocurbahead,2008-11-20T13:30Z,"This is a totally useless program.Why? After installing everything works fine,no problem.
But then, I convert AVI to Video-TS , this also works perfect, but when I burn the dvd, I come into a menu created by the program, and it doesn't work. I can not come out of the menu."
,nocurbahead,2008-11-20T15:13Z,"Before I forgot, it is the menu which appears when I play the dvd in my sony dvd-player/recorder. the dvd starts, the menu comes, and it is not possible to use the menu.
The menu is the only thing that shows up."
