This is the third track from the seminal 1980s album "Three Of A Perfect Pair" by King Crimson.

The line-up in that incarnation of the band was: 
Robert Fripp - guitar
Adrian Belew - guitar and vocals
Bill Bruford - drums
Tony Levin - bass and backing vocals

..and it just doesn't get better than that! :-)
