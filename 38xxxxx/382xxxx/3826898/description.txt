C4k3 Mix Volume One - Intro To Electronica

Preface:
     Many of these songs I would not consider to be in
the genre of "Electronica." Therefore this mix is 
considered only an introduction. There will be more
uploads of full Electro/Electronic(a)/Trance mix's
soon. For now, take it or leave it, these are all good
songs, and their purpose is only to warm up the listener's
ears to the variety of sythesized sounds which comprises
true electronic music. 

BTW you can be sure the last 4 tracks are "Electronica"
