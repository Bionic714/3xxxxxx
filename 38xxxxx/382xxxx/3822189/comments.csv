,caesar102,2008-01-13T22:08Z,i know i'm probably an idiot but it says i don't have the disk and i don't know how to use the crack
,Kykel,2008-01-14T02:33Z,"yeah.... I have a virtual clone drive thing, and It still says no disc. I can't figure out how to get it to work.... help!"
,Kykel,2008-01-14T21:46Z,Where is the crack file at?? I cant find it!
,odin4000,2008-01-21T15:40Z,"hi,
i downloaded this torrent and i can't find the mountable image...
and where is the cracked EXE file???
thanks for helping"
,yople,2008-01-29T02:42Z,"After downloading this and mounting the image, I get the Autorun screen dealy, but the buttons are all blank, like it's not finding their image files or something. I'm assuming the second button is for install (I've also tried running setup.exe directly from the ""CD"") but when I press it (or run it) a command prompt window opens and immediately closes. I'm using Daemon Tools Lite with default settings and I've tried this in Vista and XP. Should I be burning this to a CD?

Stranger still, I successfully installed this on Vista earlier (I've reinstalled the OS since)."
,yople,2008-01-30T10:37Z,Whoops! Turns out it wasn't done downloading. Now I feel like a complete goof.
,Rubiksfaq,2008-03-18T06:12Z,"Awesome Game. Period. Thanks for the upload, roller!

,Drewford,2008-03-25T19:38Z,Still cant find the crack.exe where did you hide it? 
,godsbreast,2008-03-25T20:29Z,"ok here are instructions to where the crack.exe is.

1. make sure u have the phychonauts iso mounted to daemon tools or whatever program u got to mount it.

2. click start and click on my computer.

3. right click on whatver virtual drive u have phychonauts on. (for example i have a virtual drive L and the main characters face is on it)

4. after the right click u click open not autoplay.

5. then click on the HOODLUM folder and there it is. just replace the original phychonauts exe, with that one in the HOODLUM folder."
,dark_justice1986,2008-04-02T02:43Z,I don't understand ho people can't find the mountable image.. It's the 1 main file that is there. Just mount it and install and then copy the patch over for no-cd..
,thedarkness25,2009-06-10T02:45Z,"Thanks for the upload, but there's a crash when i'm about to get pyrokinesis. Don't know if anybody else has that problem."
,MyGameName,2009-06-26T05:31Z,The reason I am DLing this is because ZI bought it for the PS2 and it doesn't work.
,LemonGrenade,2009-07-13T20:59Z,"I've downloaded it fine, mounted the image, and installed it, and found the file in the HOODLUM folder, but can't figure out where/what it is supposed to replace. I figured it was the file of about the same size it System folder, but it won't let me remove the original, and also says their isnt enough room on the disk (even though it's mounted >_>)

Any help would be appreciated =]"
,LemonGrenade,2009-07-13T21:18Z,"Nevermind, I'm dumb. Drag folder from the CD to PROGRAM FILES Psychonauts folder, shoulda figureed that out sooner >_"

,gryesduh,2011-06-10T01:06Z,"Under the folder HOODLUM where you find the exe crack there's another file entitled HOODLUM that is repeatedly found as a trojan. Is this something to worry about? Also when I try to transfer the psychonauts crack it says there isn't enough space on the disk even though it's a virtual disk..
Someone help plzzzzzzz"

What are we doing wrong ?"
,Alexnader78,2012-05-12T14:31Z,"FOR ALL THOSE WITH ""NEED FILE BLINKW32.DLL"" 

God I feel dumb. Hadn't Pirated a game in over two years, so forgot how to: You have to replace the ""Psychonauts.exe"" found in the INSTAL FOLDER (C:) with the one from the HOODLUM.
Not the destop icon ! that's why it can't find that file. 

My path was:
C:Program filesDouble Fine ProductionsPsychonautsPsychonauts.exe "
