The official DVD is 2.92 GB.

This is probably a home-made conversion into .vob files from .avi or .flv used as source..."

,rajivuncoiling,2008-06-28T10:18Z,"one of the best researched documentary even produced. i personally think that part I was not required its useless to hurt anybody's religious sentiments regardless to his/her caste color and creed. even if what they say in part I is 100%, which i doubt, what matters in religion is faith not history. rest of the movie is no doubt an eye opener for all people those who think they are rewarded for their hard work and honesty, in fact there are criminal and swindlers with trillion of dollars to swindle any single penny they can get from you. MUST WATCH AND DISTRIBUTE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL. may god bless you all, regardless to your caste, color and creed."

If you really believe in a God, your sentence ""god bless you all"" may suggest, why don't you pray for all the children who are abused, die in war or die of hunger around the world? The problem with religion is it make people ignorant and selective in their belief. It also goes easily over to fanatism"
