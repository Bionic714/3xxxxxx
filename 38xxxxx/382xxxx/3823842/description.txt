This is a 5.1 upmix of The Who Sell Out....You will have to figure a way to join the tracks together as on the cd...I tried as best I could to keep the flow continous but apparently did not do a great job on that....Hopefully someone will be able correct what I couldn't and reseed...This is a classic WHO album from 1967 and deserved the surround treatment..
