,glisk,2007-09-29T08:11Z,"Dude, chill. I'm the only seed. Torrents are like this when they begin."
,paxel500,2007-09-29T13:24Z,My advice for your internet speed is that you turn off your firewall.
,glisk,2007-09-29T15:53Z,"I've got ports forwarded properly, the firewall is not interfering with speed in any fashion."
,paxel500,2007-09-29T16:49Z,well if i turn the firewall of i get like 3-4 times better speed for seeding and downloading.
,Consider-Phlebas,2007-09-29T17:14Z,Thank you very much!
,glisk,2007-09-29T17:26Z,"Paxel: Rather than turning off your firewall, try forwarding ports. You get the same advantages without losing security.  The reason you get lower speeds when your firewall is up is because you can't connect to all peers properly. The firewall is blocking ports. For example, in uTorrent, int he options under Connection, a port, we'll say for example, port 62000, is selected for BitTorrent.  You need to go into your router/firewall settings and forward the ports.
Now if you're talking about WINDOWS firewall, I don't use that, it's silly, especially if your router has a firewall."
,glisk,2007-09-29T17:26Z,Prev note: Forward port 62000 in that example.

,MackanZoor,2007-10-01T13:04Z,"that's odd, im getting a database error with my real comment"
,MackanZoor,2007-10-01T13:06Z,i assume that stuff like this Its sad thatis gone but I plan to post these here on The Pirate Bay now and RIP is about ...
,MackanZoor,2007-10-01T13:06Z,WTF they have a word filter for de.mo.noid??
,MackanZoor,2007-10-01T13:07Z,du det var ganska lamt piratebay.... jag trodde att ni var coola
,MackanZoor,2007-10-01T13:07Z,"ok anyway, about the-place-thet-must-not-be-named (due to super gay word filters) it's not gone or dead or anything, in fact they were back up yesterday. however today they are having some problems again but im sure things will be back to normal sooner than later.

however keep posting your releases on pirate bay too- public trackers such as this is important and deserve support even if only by wanted content."
,MackanZoor,2007-10-01T13:14Z,"fan jag trodde bara ni var sämst på att hantera sql-satser, men att det var nåt så korkat som CENSUR, det trodde jag inte. provar igen: Demo.noid.

nä jag var tvungen att lägga in en punkt. nåt så jävulst. jag som trodde piratpartiet var MOT censur??? dessutom försöker ni dölja det, nåt så förbannat dålig stil... hycklare asså

ill take it in english too: i thought piratebay was just bad at handling sql but it turns out that the VERY SAME people that stands to promote piracy and free speech etc, kopimi, the ""Piratbyrån"", these guys actually have a word-filter here that makes it impossible to post the word ""demo.noid"" without that dot. they even try to cover it up by saying ""database error"" when you post.

wow dudes. super lame. why don't you go ahead and remove this comment too if you want to be such nazis. maybe ban me too huh? shut me up real good? fucking twats.

i hope the people that sees this and cares about something like free speech passes on the message."
