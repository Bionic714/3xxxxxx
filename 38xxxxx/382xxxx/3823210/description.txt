My encode of Avatar S03E02.

Includes the short that aired after the episode.

Please note that my internet speed is limited by uTorrent\'s scheduler. My speed is uncapped from 2am-10am CST only, otherwise it\'s capped at 20k/sec. (Fri night and Sat night, it\'s capped til 3am CST) - Why the capping? That\'s when the people in my household are asleep/won\'t be using their internet so much. It\'s mostly to keep my stepdad and I from lagging in WoW.

It\'s sad thatis gone, but I plan to post these here on The Pirate Bay, now.

Have fun, and seed to 1.0 or more!
