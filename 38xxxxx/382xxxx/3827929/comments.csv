[T],Neiviesis1919,2009-11-14T21:08Z,"-Thanx for the comments, remeber ""Eat 'em up, then Seed 'em up"". Doesn't look like and issue here, much apreciated.

-To 'dogsfollow' i am rocking PeerGuardian here on my side, but people can jump in in the middle between you and me, the middle being here this website/torrent download. O and i don't mind any suggestion of what i could/should do.

Peace.
