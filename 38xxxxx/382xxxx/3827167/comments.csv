,Deswaldos_from_YouTube,2008-05-09T13:41Z,"I downloaded hundreds of torrents before, but I can't make this one to work. I mount the image on my Deamon Tools and when I run it it says the disc is empty. I tried unpacking and installing, will not work. I don't know what to do now?? I've been looking for this game for ages! "
,geddsleesha,2008-05-17T16:28Z,doesnt work on vista 
,steyrkat,2008-05-26T01:18Z,"I love this game! It does have a few crashing issues, but it's a very well made game for its age. The game works fine on XP, in fact I need dxdiag turned ON for the game to work. I didn't need to change any settings for Rock Raiders to play."

,EternCat,2009-01-10T22:21Z,"An excellent torrent, thanks. I just mounted it, installed, and played. Works on my XP machine perfectly without any tweaking apart from a dialogue box telling me it's in a low resolution. I can't alt+tab out of it, but hey, that's old games for you.

Also, I love this game. Srsly."

,Aeblehjem,2010-02-07T18:16Z,"Hello to all of you old fans on Lego Rock raiders :)

As many of you may have noticed, this game will not run on windows 7 or vista saying that it cannot find the designated file: ""d3drm.dll""

I google'd it a bit and found a solution!

http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=197777&topic=26766394&page=36

the 7th. comment. a guy who fixed this issue. simply follow his instructions, and you will be running!

Hope it's helpful for any people out there.

btw, thanks for uploading"
,Aeblehjem,2010-02-07T20:16Z,"UPDATE ^

Just an important tip to mention that the guy forgot:
If it does not work when you put the d3drm.dll in C:/Windows/System32, then just put it in the C:/Windows/system folder.

Anyways, cheers, i'm out."
,bimvee,2010-03-25T10:06Z,"Thanks very much! My CD was glitching.

So I was on an ice level- oxygen was limited. I had 5 support stations, and rock raiders running around like insects. My 3.8GHz was lagging. Anyway, something glitched and none of my buildings got power, though I had over 100 energy crystals. :o lol 

Works great on Win7. I had to put it in the Windows/System folder.
Also, one of the fastest download times I've ever got.
Thanks again"
,alekshero99,2010-11-24T22:32Z,Does it Work for windows 7?
,horacio14,2011-04-04T07:50Z,very good however is quite laggy but it does work on windows 7. For windows 7 users disregard the help text given with torrent as wat it says doesn't work. if you get message saying you need d3drm.dll just open the disc with explorer go into directx6 and then again directx6 and it'll be in there :D have the fun :D
,mjzanga,2011-05-01T02:30Z,"i have windows 7 and its not working for me. it installed fine and i got d3drm.dll and put it in the system folder, and when i try and run the program it just sits at a black screen. doesnt say its not responding, it just steadily builds up ram usage and uses a near constant 50% of my cpu. i tried different compatibility modes but none worked. any tips?"
,mjzanga,2011-05-02T05:04Z,"nevermind, i got it fixed. ended up haxing into the config file to disable avi movies O.o"
,jace1800,2011-05-14T20:05Z,i would like to thank whoever put this on hear this is on of my all time fav games 
,Tjalf,2011-07-01T18:09Z,"If you have the error with the ""d3drm.dll"" file, just look it up at http://www.dll-files.com/ . There you can download .dll files if you need them, place the .dll file inside >the game folder< or in the >system directory"
,alexisalex,2011-08-04T17:27Z,"how do you disable the video? becuase it'll run but it stops before where the lego media bit should be, and i cannot run the videos out of the game(the avi) i just get a blank screen like in game"
,codsniper,2011-11-12T07:13Z,exe doesnt work
,Matstru,2011-12-22T14:16Z,"I can't get it to work. I mounted it with Deamon Tools Lite, and tried with the d3drm.dll file in both /system and /System32. I went to the EXE-folder and started the application. The game starts, I get a black screen for a second, and then it instantly shuts down. Someone know what to do?"
,kupido462,2012-01-18T16:42Z,"it still doesn't work, i have placed the d3drm.dll in C:\Windows\System32 and system. when i start it up nothing happens he's only loading for a while "
,Darthspartan,2012-04-01T07:00Z,"The predicted DLL error came up on windows 7, however after simply moving the noted driver file into the System folder, it launched easily! However, the game started up about 200 pixels off-center from the screen, with no sound. It has also completely corrupted my directx. My resolution, even after a restart, now remains 720x640, down from 1280x768. Directx will no longer run, now will any programs that require it. Thanks... 

Will post again when and IF I can repair the damage to my computer, but I will definitely not be trying to run the game again, I'm tossing it straight to the trash and going out to buy the cd again."
,IanHopkins,2012-04-21T17:21Z,"Does this require a code? I lost mine ages ago, and I'd rather download it than search for a disc that I can't use."
,IanHopkins,2012-04-21T17:25Z,"Also, couldn't using a dual boot of Windows XP/Windows7 work?"
,IanHopkins,2012-04-22T18:46Z,"The link to the driver is dead, it'll take you there, but the download is fucked, it disappeared."
