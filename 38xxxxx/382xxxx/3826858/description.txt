Great album by TaQ.  Individual songs were ripped by Naota3K, but I have included a mix of the first disc (by me) that blends it together so it can be played as a single track.  I've done a little bit of editing to the sound files, but everything's there.

Original tracks are 320CBR, mix is 10VBR (320 max).
