Heartland by Real Life is one of the best synth pop albums that was releases in the 80s. Although Real Life is best known for the smash hit "Send Me An Angel", in my opinion they are far better songs on the album, namely, Always, Catch Me I'm Falling and Openhearted. A must have album for the 80s synth pop lovers.
