,solielj,2009-02-01T09:24Z,"I'm about to have my first kid in August. I'm trying to expand my music and movie collection in preparation. I'll try to revive this torrent as best I can before August but forgive me if I leave out The Wiggles albums. The get on my nerves. lol If you absolutely must have those let me know and I'll try to get them too. I did not upload this to begin with though so we'll see if I can find all of it. Check the ""By: solielj"" link to see my progress on the albums. Once I get all of them then I'll make it into one torrent, but you can download them individually as I get them. The only reason I'm doing this is because I see so many people trying to download a dead file."
