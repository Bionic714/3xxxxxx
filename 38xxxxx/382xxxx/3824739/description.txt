=========================
In a world where monsters called Yoma prey on humans and live among them in disguise, humanity's only hope is a new breed of warrior known as Claymores. Half human, half monster, these silver-eyed slayers possess supernatural strength, but are condemned to fight their savage impulses or lose their humanity completely.

Great manga! Awesome action manga, but don't compare it to other action mangas, great storyline that keeps you wishing for some more volumes [haven't found them yet, hold ya horses :P].
Actually, i can say its one of the best Mangas i've seen. The anime makes the manga seem like God btw. Tho follows the storyline pretty good too [the anime is NOT posted].

Hope you like it. Seed it :)
