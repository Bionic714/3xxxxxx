Where did you find the last volume anyway?
Only found some chapters, and they're not in order either:S"
,MoshMage,2007-10-01T20:45Z,"I found it on mininova, tho i can't seem to find more than the 13th vol. 

It says inside that it has been downloaded from manga-sketchbook.org but that's impossible since they only have till 9th Vol.

Tho, i couldnt find any missing pages, but maybe there are and i'm just too dumb to see it xD

anyway, hope you guys apreciate it as much as i did.

*wishes for some more volumes :D*"
