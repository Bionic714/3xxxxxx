,BrittonBurton,2007-09-26T20:43Z,"It's not a virus, its just that small."
,blastfire17,2007-09-27T01:09Z,"this is my fav arcade/shotemup game of all time!! awesome game from Apogee!! i am proud to own a kixx version of it :)

i have lots and lots of retro for sale, pm me, I ship worldwide."
,BrittonBurton,2007-10-19T22:19Z,"I am no longer seeding this torrent, but its a good game so screw those dumb ass kids who want to talk shit about it. I didn't mean to quit seeding it actually. So if your seeding plz keep it going for me so this game won't be lost forever. As for a virus in any of my files? I don't think so, if anyone is seeding viruses its that anal pitbull bitch and his butt buddy zamorak-1-gay ass mofo. To the rest of you enjoy the software and pass it along all you want. Don't add useless shit to it though."
,Hyper_Trance,2007-10-26T19:01Z,How did you get this awesome game to work?
,haast,2007-10-29T01:39Z,hes right it is a really great game i used to spend hours on end playing it i reccomend if you dont have alot of memory and want a good game to play
,haast,2007-10-29T01:58Z,stuck at 35.4% can i have sum help please.....................thank you
,BrittonBurton,2007-11-09T02:52Z,I hate to re-download this game just to seed it again. Its so tiny anyone can seed it. This game was my first torrent. I chose it because it was so small and I figured it would be a rare find. Especially now a days with so many new far more complex games to choose from. I would recommend the dos box emulator to make it run better in windows. Thanks for your comments.
,BrittonBurton,2007-12-01T14:33Z,"I am seeding it again, thanks to those who kept going until I figured out how to reload the torrent into Azureus. 

Oh and to answer you question on how to make this fantastic game run, well for starters its a DOS game so it may run funky on a Windows XP or later system. It ran strangely on mine to, but you can use the DOS Box dos emulator to make the sound and graphics run great, only problem is Dos Box is kind of hard to figure out how to use. If I can do it I know you can to! Don't want to load dos box up? Well you can run it in Windows regular style but you need to right click the icon and tell it to run it in Win 95 mode and don't expect the sound to work properly. Hope that helps anyone else who may get stuck!"
,mizifih,2008-06-28T03:20Z,I recommend DOSBox to run any good oldie like this one!
,Vegedus,2008-07-13T22:27Z,"Ah, yes, Raptor. My first and last scrolling-shooter.

Last because I've yet played one that has surpassed it."
,Gamble42,2008-10-10T01:06Z,Raptor was my idol game back in the day. I searched here to download it on a wim and i can't really believe i found it! =D More Seedz Please!
,britton27,2009-06-09T03:07Z,"It's good to see that a torrent I uploaded is still working. 22 Seeds, impressive for this game! Thank you all for seeding it. I was seed 23 at the time of this comment, and I intend to stay on it. Thou this is the only torrent of my originals that I will find and seed.  

Yes it is me Britton the original uploader, and I had a time finding this game back in the day when I posted it. 

No its not a virus, why would I seed something that would destroy my own computer. Yes I did originally own this game on antique 1.44 diskette, but as with all magnetic media it become worn and useless after a time. 

Thank you all for helping keep this one alive. 

I will seed this on and off for as long as I can, in other words it will stay in utorrent list of active torrents for as long as I have an internet connection. Even though it may pause from time to time. Lets keep it going!"
,britton27,2009-06-09T03:36Z,"OK I couldn't just sit here and wait for ppl to say ""ok man this game just won't work with Vista""

Yes it can but your gonna play hell to make it work, that is until i got a hold of it. :)

Download as you normally would and you MUST have dosbox to make it work.

Google it for christ sakes!

Unpack to your C: (yes I know thats lame, but you want to play this don't you?)

Unpack to C:/raptor 

Its tiny as fuck so it don't matter!

Run dosbox and type this at the prompt

mount c c:\raptor

then rap

The game will run, on VISTA. LOL yea Vista OMG. Even with tons of shit going on its running. I'm proof, sitting here drunk as fuck. Got dosbox for the first time for a few years and with a lil reading I got it to run, don't ""dumb ass"" on me now!

Have fun!

I forgot how much fun the music was...lol oh yeah this brings back so many memories..even if I don't play it, its just fun to hear and see its primitive graphics just for a change....YAY! 

Download this you won't regret it!"
,britton27,2009-08-24T07:46Z,"Its still kicking even though I""m running Windows 7 now. I'm going to stop seeding this permanently now. 

However if for some reason you can not find this game or the seeds finally drop to 0 you can contact me through email with

,Destoroyah,2011-08-11T17:32Z,"Works great, and it's the registered/full version 1.2, all 3 episodes. You can't get a better version of the game than this. Thanks Burton"
,D0ffryn82,2012-02-04T12:50Z,"OMFG dude your are a legend! i had this game on my Osbourne 386DX (shareware version only), now nearly 15 years later (yes by my user ID i was born in 82) i have the full version, im going to never stop seeding this now that i have it, i will keep this for my kids, simple games like this are so much easier to get them to understand how to play a game! plus i can still have fun with it!"
,D0ffryn82,2012-02-04T13:33Z,now if only i could find Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure i would be complete!
