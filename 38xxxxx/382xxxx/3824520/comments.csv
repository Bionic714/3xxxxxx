But, Couldn't find the synchronized subtitles. Please help me find that."
,motupaul,2008-08-09T12:10Z,"No luck...... Havent got any subtitles in english.....
The gspot file is a subtitle file containing only Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish languages..... Missing the most wanted english language.,...."
,Baloo2,2008-08-17T17:52Z,"@motupaul:
Yes, you are correct, only Nordic subs on this DVD. Sorry about that.

@Kjelsaasbjornen:
The file with extension GSpot has basically the same info as I posted up above in the info window. The subtitles are in the RAR package. 

If you use a good media player you shouldn't have to worry about unpacking the archive, the player should be able to handle the subs unpacked."
