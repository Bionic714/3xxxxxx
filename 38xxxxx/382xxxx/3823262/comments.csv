,pspbricker,2007-10-11T14:08Z,"Well took me 4 hrs. to figure it out. I'm using 3.52 m33 firmware, (It will NOT work on official sony firmware...duh). enter recovery menu (power up while holding R trigger). goto ADVANCED then ADANCED CONFIGURATION and disable ""execute BOOT.BIN in UMD/ISO"". Also always have an original USD in the drive and set UMD mode to ""normal - UMD required"". Thanks for the up!"

I've done what pspbricker said and I have 3.90M33. Imma try 3.52."
,mole51,2008-05-03T08:38Z,TuBBiE - If you have M33 custom firmware you need to boot into recovery mode (Hold R-Trigger when booting) then go to configuration->UMD Kernel Mode-> Change to M33 -NO UMD-. This should help.
,Silversword,2008-05-10T10:05Z,"LOL!
I extracted the files but they are huge!
over 15 GB in size"
,Silversword,2008-05-10T10:26Z,"No... i mae a mistake.

But my memory stick has 512 MB memory.... :("
