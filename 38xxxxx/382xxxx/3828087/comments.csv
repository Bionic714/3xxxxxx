,antil0ck,2007-11-25T07:29Z,"To all,

I uploaded and seeded for almost 1 month. At one point, there were a number of leechers but no one wanted to seed! It's a shame and disrespectful to all of the torrent community to download torrents but not SEED!

[T],bi20,2007-12-21T13:53Z,"well, you could seed it when somebody leaves a comment asking for it, as I do know. :)"
,X81,2007-12-27T23:22Z,"Antil0ck if your seed the last last 2.5% , I'll seed for at least a week, There are at least 30 peers in waiting for the last 2.5%. "
,pirateeric,2008-01-24T07:50Z,"to: Antil0ck 
I agree to seed it for at least a week.
PLEASE seed the last last 2.5%."
