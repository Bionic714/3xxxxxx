Are We Alone In The Universe?
-----------------------------

Featuring: Zecharia Sitchin

Is Modern Science Merely Catching Up With Ancient Knowledge? In a set of 6000-year-old stone tablets the Sumerians of Mesopotamia vividly describe cataclysmic planetary events which billions of years ago gave our solar system it?s current configuration, fashioning our own planet in the process. Sumerian records also mention the existence of an additional planet in our solar system referred to as Nibiru, which is currently unknown to modern science, and is the recorded home of our human ancestors, according to these ancient records. Eminent scientists agree that calculations tend to confirm the accuracy of the ancient Sumerian creation story. In the eighties, unmanned U.S. space probes photographed pyramids and other strange features on the surface of Mars, suggesting this was once the site of an alien space base. Join Zecharia Sitchin, author of Genesis Revisited and The 12th Planet, as we embark on an exciting journey into uncharted territory; a provocative reassessment of who we are and where we stand in the Universe.
