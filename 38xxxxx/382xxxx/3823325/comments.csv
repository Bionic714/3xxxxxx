,Korana,2007-11-04T09:34Z,"Yeeaah, um i cant get this working either. Wont extract the part2 and part3 rar files, and the setup and crack aint doing anything.. Any help?"
,Softiron17,2007-12-09T20:34Z,"You only need to unzip the first rar file.  Then run the setup file to install the game.  Once it's installed, don't run the crack.  Copy it into the game directory so it replaces the original exe file.  "

,Hammet27,2009-06-18T15:27Z,"Works perfectly for anyone who is worried... Just unpack the first .rar let it do it's thing run the setup, then before playing replace BGE.exe (in the game folder) with the file of same name (BGE.exe) that is in the crack folder. simple. thanks Dobrus"
,Panda196,2009-06-25T17:06Z,"When I try to run the BGESetup.exe, Windows Explorer kind of... locks up on me. I'm running Vista and I had to manually End Process and run Explorer while typing this comment. What the hell is going on?"
,Panda196,2009-06-25T17:11Z,"""You only need to unzip the first rar file. Then run the setup file to install the game.""

""Just unpack the first .rar let it do it's thing run the setup""

Yeah, just for reference, before I get the exact same answer, I'm TRYING this and it locks up when I run BGEsetup.exe"
,Panda196,2009-06-25T17:12Z,"WHOA PANIC TIEM

I let it give me the Spinning Vista Wheel of Lockupy Doom and after about 6 minutes it worked. Holy shit.

I guess anyone who's having trouble just needs to, uh, let it run forever. "

,{bluesparks},2009-08-04T02:49Z,"please help!!!!!! i am done installing it and now every time i try running the game i get this error
""IDirect3D9_CreateDevice failed,please re-run settings application"""
,CriticalDesign,2009-08-15T00:18Z,"Works fine, but with tons of graphical errors for me. Random flashing and whatnot."
,Blacer,2009-08-18T10:27Z,"Beyond good and evil works for me except for one thing, if i take pictures i cant see them. I can only see a black box! Can somebody help me?"
,Blacer,2009-08-18T14:07Z,"Srry for my double post, I just wanted to say I fixed my picture problem! I just had to update my system!"
,vinnylima,2009-09-29T20:56Z,"working almost perfectly (there is some flashing in menus, that's all). the setup takes some time to load, don't worry. if you get an error message when trying to run the game, just run the file SettingsApplication from the game folder."
,TechnoFan21,2009-11-16T10:19Z,How do I get past the activemark crap?
,dafemads,2009-12-13T03:29Z,working 100% ive already beaten it now waiting 4 sequel to come out
,Chryzt,2010-03-23T07:08Z,"@ {bluesparks}
When the Dirext3D Error occurs, run the SettingsApplications.exe then go to the Advanced Settings Tab, and check ""Manual Compatibility Settings"". After that, press the ""Autodetect"" Button, and save. Hope I translated these settings correctly, because they are displayed in German on my System. Since then the Game works like a charm. Good luck"
,Guardian_452,2011-01-06T18:24Z,"Yeah, finally got it. All you gotta do is uncheck ""HW Vertex Processing"" in advanced settings for no more flashing textures. oh and don't run BGE.exe file, run the SettingsApplication.exe for the game to launch."
,tlccc,2011-03-19T18:44Z,"is clean and it works.  1.4 athlon, old radeon 9250, xp pro sp3. thanks. "
,pikultybalt,2011-07-02T15:19Z,"This works great!!! For it to work, I had to click on SettingsApplication.exe instead of BGE.exe, but I did copy/paste the crack BGE.exe in folder."
,3rdNight,2011-08-14T13:56Z,"i downloaded it, isntalled, played for a few minutes but than jumped out from the game and wrote i need to buy the game, this was just a trial version . i live in Europe, Slovakia . what do i have to do to play the full game for free? Thank You"
