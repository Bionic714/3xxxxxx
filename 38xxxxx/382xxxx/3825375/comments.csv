,Cyborg2112,2008-08-08T23:20Z,"3 Lock Box for your request has been posted.  THX for Hampton poster.

Please be the most, and re-post!"
,Cyborg2112,2008-08-11T18:42Z,"This IS NOT the album Standing Hampton, but rather Sammy Hagar - UNBoxed.  A small ""best of"" collection of 10 songs.  But thanks anyway, it's good quality!  If anyone has THE REAL Standing Hampton, please post!"
,Cyborg2112,2008-08-11T18:49Z,"...my bad.  It IS Standing Hampton, just has the wrong album cover attached.  Thanks and enjoy!"
,w33z3l,2008-08-14T08:52Z,^^^ I don't include any album covers in my uploads; only the songs and a playlist.
