,twesterhold,2008-03-31T19:46Z,"Hey man, thanks for the upload, but you should really rename this torrent.  People would flock to it if it was called Procoder 3 and then there would be a lot more seeders."
,boonp,2008-04-08T01:29Z,Please seed it. I have waiting over night but no one seed it. I did my turn in seeding others.
,boonp,2008-04-11T16:54Z,"Problem with Procoder 3

When I add any source file(for PPC normally wiht 320x240 resolution) which is Xvid with .avi file extension, it won't accept it, but generate error message:
""Unable to open Windows Media Source file""

Someone please suggest the solution to this problem.
