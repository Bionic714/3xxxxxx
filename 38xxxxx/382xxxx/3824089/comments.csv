Superman still dumb, take everything head on like a brick some one throw though."
,Bloodbathes,2007-09-29T22:12Z,"Oh yeah, with avi, you can watch on tv with a divx player, I have yet to see a player that let you watch mkv file yet!

Anyone know if there's one?"
,death734,2007-09-30T00:43Z,"thefolenangel, your an idiot.
get with the times, mkv pee's on avi. mkv is all around the best container (most compatible with everything). so what if your divx player cant play it. its not just the mkv it doesn't like its the x264 (which is better then xvid)

x264 is not mkv like avi is not xvid/divx
containers are just what the video/audio (which can be a variety of codecs) are in.
this could be mkv and still xvid if he wanted to but like i said x264 is better

what next are you guys gonna complain 720p x264 doesn't work on your divx player?
Just hook up your laptop/pc to your tv like all HD (720p/1080i/1080p x264/mpeg-2/h264 in .mkv or .TS) downloaders and general x264 viewers use."
