,carco,2007-09-30T20:38Z,now... this hope will be good shit!
,JamieNorway,2007-11-01T15:41Z,Can anyone make a description on what to do??
,rampondy,2007-11-13T13:09Z,"Simply download it. you will be presented with a .daa file.
write it to a cd using power-iso.
boot from cd.

ps: but i had a prob, my pc is already running with xp. when i boot from this cd, i get a ntdetect failed error. after restart without cd, everything was fine."
,rampondy,2007-11-13T13:10Z,"P.s: dont let this image autorun in ur XP pc. when i did so, i lost my startmenu instead i got a bartpe menu, ejecting the cd will turn back to normal."
,nick-napster,2008-01-21T23:21Z,"This is just crap, this is note a real windows xp, its just a demo version, no internett,no programs whitout paint...

no xp style just windows cllasic style, note iven a cp start menu!

Just one thing... How do you change backruond image?"
,mjdech,2008-02-21T12:24Z,"Works perfectly, thanks wepsa.  Requires poweriso to extract the.daa file to .iso, which is a free app for linux, and I think has a trial version for win.  The guy who says this changed his computer maybe has never used a livecd.  of course the start menu looked different, it was a different OS running off the cd and in your RAM.  Why would you change the background image, it is a utility disk?  It worked fine to check disk my external hdd that was having problems.  Very handy tool for anyone who might have NTFS formatted external drives, and needs to repair blocks but dont have an extra machine with windows already loaded."
,ghsodt,2008-02-22T01:28Z,I am going to try to use this to flash update my BIOS. I will tell you how it goes. Stupid MSI doesn't bother supporting anything but Windoze XP (not even 98 and ME) and of course not ubuntu. To those using linux there is also the possibility of using nerolinux to open the daa file. I beleive there is a functional cracked version to be found on isohunt.
,ghsodt,2008-02-22T02:09Z,"I'm an idiot, ignore what I wrote about nerolinux. I was getting nrg and daa files confused. (So many stupid proprietary formats) To use a daa you have to use ""PowerISO for Linux"""
,ghsodt,2008-02-22T04:01Z,"Hmm... Tried to use this. It seems to be a functioning LiveCD with nice graphics (though bot identical to real XP look) But it couldn't detect the network for me. It was able to notice and mount my VFAT partition and seemed to read it fine. However, it wouldn't run an exe program I had put there (the BIOS flash because the internet wasn't avaliable). So that was useless. Also it is quite a slow boot, even for a LiveCD (I guess I can only compare it to the various Knoppix and Ubuntu LiveCDs I have used) Not a great tool. Perhaps it could be used for my purposes if I was willing to put more time into figuring out Windoze and the Bartpe, but I really have better things to do. I can't beleive people put up with windows it is the most annoying thing to use when you realise there are different possibilities."
,catopett,2008-03-13T09:30Z,"I do remake this cd, and do it for DVD 
and FULL XP for you folks, is this ok?
I allso put inn software 
for you to make a contribute!

Someone, come with software you want onto this live DVD!"
,plasmaview,2008-08-28T04:33Z,"This worked perfectly for me.  I only needed it to upgrade the BIOS on my Linux laptop.  Of course Dell is so Linux-hostile that the only BIOS update utility they offer is Windows based.

I have not tested networking, sound, or anything else, but I can tell you that it works for BIOS updating.

THANKS for the upload!"
,stebethrulez,2010-03-02T22:27Z,"Burning was successful, but when I tried to boot with the CD, I had a BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH.

So... Doesn't work."
,gladiator3901,2011-08-06T07:55Z,i this having ghost
,victornpb,2012-01-18T14:07Z,"It actually works!
Useful for backup and repairs when the system doesn't boots up.

The boot process is very very slow.
But it have explorer, so you can see your hard drives and see your files, and recognized my pen drive as well, so you can also use this to repair a missing or damaged file in your main system, backup and you can run some small programs and tools inside your pen drive or hdd.

You can't install office or photoshop, and this doesn't recognize my network, so you can't use as a operational system to surf the web or do something. This is a emergency system for repairs and backups.

Hope this comment helps, since this torrent doesn't have a description, you don't need to download this blinded."
