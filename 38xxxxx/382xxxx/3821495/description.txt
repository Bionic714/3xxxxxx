Now we get into the interesting stuff: How to make a profit from distressed properties.  This chapter introduces you to the immense opportunities for profit that fall within the category of Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½distressed propertiesÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½.  You will learn how to take advantage of foreclosures and how there are actually three stages in the foreclosure process, each with its own opportunities. 

You will also learn how to buy run-down properties and Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½flipÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ them for a profit.  A technique popularized by hit shows like Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Flip that HouseÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½.  I teach you how to add up to five dollars in value for every dollar spent on renovations, many of which can be completed in less than three weeks! The value of your property will sky-rocket if you do these simple renovations that I have learned from long years of experience.  

You will also learn how to find these opportunities using the internet, government, and other public sources.  But donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t forget the crucial web resources that were included with your purchase.  This chapter only scratches the surface; you will need to take advantage of the web site created for your course.  You will find the complete list of links in the user-guide that comes with all our premium courses.  But for this chapter specifically, you should go to this web page:
