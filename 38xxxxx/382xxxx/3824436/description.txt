The game is very simple, but I give you a quick survival tips:
 - Trains first with single player mode (with bots) .... or you will be cannon meat in online playing.
 - Dont remain quiet for long time.
 - Aim accurate and fast.
 - Avoid predictable movements (Bad example: long advance in line straight).
 - Take advantage of the terrain.
 - Pay attention to the radar.
 - Learn from the guys thats kill you.


IF YOU LIKE THIS GAME, PLEASE BUY IT. IS CHEAP AND THE DEVELOPERS GUY┬┤S DESERVES IT.


See you in the battle .... good luck !
