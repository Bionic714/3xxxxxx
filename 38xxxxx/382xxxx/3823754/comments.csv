dont listen to the retards that post stupid comments, the file is virus free. 

Open and burn with PowerISO, which is also available on this site."
,sjoseph001,2008-05-26T15:47Z,I'm a newbie who can follow 'very detailed' instructions on how to use this download. How do I extract the files? I can't see any .bin or .rar files. Help welcome.
,Blookat,2008-06-06T21:04Z,whats the difference between this one and the 1.3GB one?
,Blookat,2008-06-06T21:06Z,"600MB one I mean, looked at the wrong file."
,Haraberu,2008-06-13T18:09Z,"The difference between this and the other seems to be only the size. 
This one is compressed better, but needs a special program to extract, while while the larger one is uncompressed and can be burned with almost any program."
,ltcmdrData,2008-10-21T19:55Z,"I don't know about this one. no program would recognize it as an image. maybe there is a program out there that will, but none of mine could."
,yy4u,2008-11-12T09:50Z,"Looked great in PowerISO on my working computer.  After burning it and trying to boot my computer with the OS gone bad, it failed with error:  Error loading image:  CDMENU.EZB

Too bad.. it was my last hope.  Guess I'll have to get a new hard drive...."
,brockmanfla,2009-09-29T13:57Z,"Bohlin, nice collections of  workable tools  for  most case scenarios.  thanks a lot. 

as for the illerates... pay no mind. someday they will learn.  if  they took the time to read thru the list.. most of these files are in fact virus...  kinda of like medicine.. it  takes a virus to kill a virus.

I have been trying to find a recovery cd for a toshiba a105 s4084 laptop...  toshiba  being the ass they are want 35.00 for the cd.  yada yada...  and ov course no partition on the drive.

again thanks."
,milorad1986,2009-11-12T01:15Z,"gonna try it , and seed it if it works properly ... "
,bigeorge179,2009-12-27T23:37Z,Best recovery and boot cd I've ever used. I will be seeding this until it becomes obsolete.
