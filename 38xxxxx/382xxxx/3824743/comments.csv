,WayneIsHxC,2007-10-23T02:01Z,yeah i had the same problem with the diabdat.mpq
,EmperorNero,2007-11-23T16:53Z,"You don't extract an ISO. You mount it with a program like Deamon Tools or PowerISO.

If you don't have it, Google Is Your Friend.

Thanks for the game, btw. If it works."

,Froober,2008-03-30T19:59Z,"When you have downloaded that torrent file:
Download Â´contents of the torrent with BitTorrent Utorrent etc. Finish download (don't forget to seed!!!! :D) and then when you have that .iso file run it through daemon tools , alcohol 120% etc. Install and enjoy the game. REMEMBER!!!! You need always run the image through daemon tools to play!!!  thanks for this file!!! i will download it and seed it to 100%!!!!"
