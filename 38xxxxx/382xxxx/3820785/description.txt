Jet Li (nicknamed Jonny) is sent to France to work for a crooked Frenchman. 'Jonny' is hired because he is considered the best, of the best, of the best. Unfortunately for the two-faced French crime boss, when he tries to frame Jonny for murder, it doesn't go as well as planned and only Jonny has the cassette to prove his innocence. However, the twisted Frenchy will stop at nothing to stop that tape from gettting to the police, and to kill Jonny.
