,Archeolog,2009-02-08T20:46Z,"have you tried to use the program daemon tools?
when you're finished with the first CD, just unmount it and then mount the second CD"
,pishgah,2011-01-10T02:48Z,how come it ask for serial number? i did all the steps and installed then patch and then crack! when i run and i select any type of the game it ask for serial number!
,AeotheKaear,2011-01-24T00:46Z,"Still trying to figure out how both of the CD images are larger than can be burned onto a CD (both >800MB), but it works great when mounted with Daemon Tools / Alcohol 120% / etc. Thanks!"
,abudabulover,2011-08-08T17:55Z,does it work 4 win 7 32bit?
,parker.270,2011-10-30T11:37Z,"confirmed working fine, bloody good game too"
,parker.270,2011-10-30T11:38Z,im running windows 7 64 bit btw
,slimjim10,2011-12-05T15:00Z,"Works on win 7 64bit. Just no music in the game, but there is sound from cutting stone etc."
,esparcia,2012-01-22T11:58Z,I follow the steps but it keeps telling me its missing cd2
,thommyinnl,2012-04-29T14:13Z,"Nice torrent, got everything you need to play. one downpoint though is that I don't have any background music, but that's probably due to some issue on my PC (windows 7). everything else works just fine!"
,Rezol,2012-07-27T17:36Z,The music problem is that the game was designed for DirectX6 and it will probably never be fixed. The easiest way to get music is to find the soundtrack online and just listen to it while playing.
