I didn't know this myself until recently, so maybe there are more of you out there that didn't either... :) "
,Baloo2,2007-09-29T17:37Z,Well sorry so fucking much then Nizze Hult. I was sure that DVDR meant DVDRip which this is. If not you must blame it on the tracker admins that no longer maintains the tracker software. 
[T],kirklestat,2008-01-08T06:12Z,will try this. 
,greasetrap,2008-01-15T07:34Z,Thanks for your time and energy.
,waipaissi,2008-01-23T16:31Z,"Tack s책 mycket. 

I noticed, that almost all your torrents have many seeders, and all your uploaded movies quality is good. 

So for now i download only your torrents :)"
