Soundtrack to the 1964 vampire movie "The Last Man on Earth," based on the novella "I Am Legend" by horror writer Richard Matheson.  Vincent Price stars as Robert Morgan, a scientist who attempts to survive amidst the aftermath of a plague which transforms the entire human race into vampires.  Filmed in Italy (in fact, nearly all the other actors were redubbed when it was released in America) and somewhat faithful to the book, which was an inspiration and precursor to George Romero's own "Night of the Living Dead."

Atmospheric and moody in some places, brassy and brash in other places; sometimes it goes a bit over the top when the horror movie music chorus dips in, but overall an interesting little score.

Have not seen this available online for sale; indeed it seems to surface on CD at horror conventions, often fetching a high price.  (At the Fangoria Convention in Burbank, CA in May of 2007, one vendor was selling it for over $50.00)  This version was found on a soundtrack collector's now-defunct blog.
