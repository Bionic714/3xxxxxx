what kind of moron falls for this?

dont they teach physics and chemistry any more ?"

,Madcat247,2007-09-30T12:35Z,"Is this the one where you need to use a particle accelerator to make it work?
What a joke, you might as run it on fresh air."

,protongeek,2008-03-19T22:30Z,Guys I just bought the manual for $49. I have spoke to a buddy of mine and we think this is more than feasible. There seems to be a lot of guys that have already done this and quite a bit of info on the net through news organisations that have reported on it actually being done. The actual page count in this book is page 3 to 114. I will be installing this on a 1989 ford ranger 2.9liter v6 that is in the process of finishing assembeling the engine as I write this. If all goes well I will start seeding this tonight so you guys who are interested can also download it and give it a try. Let me know what you think.

,pileoftruth,2008-05-07T06:06Z,I am sorry to report that protongeek was killed when his car exploded. The car was shoved up his....before death occurred :)
,n8h,2008-06-15T02:37Z,"Ha, you guys are funny- I installed and it works fine. I set mine up like a hybrid and helps me get a lot more km out of my truck"

Here's your physics-violating statement: ""In the big picture, your free energy is coming from the tap water in an open system, as the latent energy in the water is enough to power the engine and hence drive the alternator and whatever belt-driven accessories. And the alternator is efficient enough to run the various electrical loads (10 - 20 amps), including the
additional low current to run this vapor reaction.""
