,Gulli88,2008-02-17T21:06Z,Has anyone got it? Is Torrent alive? I am sorry f-Art but some of your other torrents are dead or going very slowly...
,tinny112,2008-04-20T05:34Z,"Have it. Just finished watching the first 3 lessons. Very awesome and interesting. Basically they teach you how to draw from you're mind instead of from a reference. Inventing people.

Very nice stuff."

,aeradon,2011-03-04T19:43Z,"These lessons are fantastic.  The instructor doesn't have much of a way with words, but he knows what he's doing and makes it very easy to learn.  The first three lessons alone will improve any and all subsequent figures you draw!

Thanks for this f-ART!  And thanks for the links alacanthrou!"
,Captain_Abortion,2011-04-06T01:20Z,"Personally, I've bought the DvD's, and they are honestly worth the price. You are basically taking a full art course in the human structure, it is an amazing set of videos, that explain everything in simple english. My recommendation, buy the videos, they are worth the price."
,themusicdork,2011-09-06T06:59Z,"@Captain_Abortion    I would buy if I had the money. Since I don't I use torrents. But out of curiosity, if you paid for the videos why are you here looking for them on TPB?

@f-Art    Thanks for this torrent."
,punky56,2011-11-25T14:10Z,"Guys this not cool robbing a poor man,if we can't afford it we shud not act like a bum and steal it.

,shew123,2012-01-30T17:53Z,"punky56 First of all ask your man not calling us thieves , it's a gratuitous insult to us . "
,Nnay3000,2012-03-28T23:31Z,"You know what is gratuitous shew123 ?

Let this man and is poor sick wife gently but surely fall down into precariousness in not paying for all the years he has worked to accomplish this course. It is not a multimillionaire company who have huge benefits and sell off price products, just a man who want to feed his family. 

So Respect him and if you want it, pay for it."
,knglerxst,2012-06-10T03:35Z,These videos are different than the one's on his site.  This must be an older version.  
,knglerxst,2012-06-10T04:19Z,"Newer HD version here:  http://www.torrentcrazy.com/torrent/6549354/the-structure-of-man-hd

It's a huge file, almost 38 GB.  "
