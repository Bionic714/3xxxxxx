Elisabeth Haich - The Wisdom of the Tarot

In the book Elisabeth Haich explains the Major Arcana cards. She shows how the cards are in fact a spiritual journey towards enlightenment. If you are into Tarot and walking your spiritual path then I highly recommend this book to you.

Love, peace and free energy!
