,amashinga,2009-06-08T06:40Z,"Wasting your time ???.  What, did you sit and watch it download ?.  ""I wasted my time"", no consideration for others who might be downloading, or concern that ScoopLV may decide not to post anything again because of some jerkoff's selfish comments."
,skloer,2010-01-31T15:45Z,"thanks ScoopLV

Awesome!"
,woodman1975,2010-07-17T03:43Z,"I tried it with Adobe 9 and it says there is some data missing.  Not sure how to get it running, have read the readme.txt and followed instructions but it still says there is a data file missing when trying to run. Anyone else having problems on the new Adobe 9?  I noticed it was designed to work with Adobe 5 which is quite old now."

What does it matter if this doesn't fit your particular tastes, needs, desires, etc. etc.  He didn't upload it just for your pleasure. 

Your immature noises are certainly ignorable however everyone tires of those grumbling children who attempt to spoil everything for everyone because they came on line with a load in their diaper and couldn't keep it to themselves.  Please, check with mommy first.
