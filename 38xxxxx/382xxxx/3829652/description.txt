It's a little-known fact that 1980s pop-rocker Rick Springfield also had a successful acting career. This made-for-TV movie highlights Springfield's acting skills as Nick Knight, a police investigator working the night shift -- and also hiding the fact that he's a vampire. While working on a grisly murder case, Nick is forced to battle both his archenemy and a deranged murderer. This movie was the basis for the 1990s TV series "Forever Knight."
