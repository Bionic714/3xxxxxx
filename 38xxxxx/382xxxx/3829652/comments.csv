many of us have been stuck @ 93% for weeks! 

Would really appreciate this, thanks in advance.

Also thanks to WolfSpirit for this rare item."

,Tom_Araya,2010-03-16T17:57Z,"Wha the fuck!! Download stopped on 69,1% !!!"
,JoeEDangerously,2010-10-25T02:18Z,"If anyone has the complete file and are willing to give it to me, I will seed it from now on. Seriously. I am at 72.2%, and I see no hope of completion. Can anyone help? Once I have it, I will keep it on my active list. I will become the host. Right now there are 17 cats trying to get this movie. It is not available anywhere for free that I can tell.

I would stay on and seed for others."
