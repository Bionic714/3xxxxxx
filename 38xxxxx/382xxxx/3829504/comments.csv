,timothy7231,2007-10-05T06:51Z,IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GET THE GAME RUNNING YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE NO UMD DRIVER IT WILL NOT WORK WITH THE M33  DRIVER SO CHANGE IT UP WITH THE SONY ONE AND YOUR GOOD TO GOOO....... EVERYONE RUNNING 3.52 -4 or lower RUN THE SONY NO UMD DRIVE . ENJOY
,timothy7231,2007-10-05T08:47Z,No problem
,DeadlyBro,2007-10-05T23:58Z,never mind this game is A GO!: P it is also really good! IT IS A MUST HAVE!!!
,voltaire64,2007-10-07T16:20Z,"Timothy, how do you go about changing the driver, do you have download it from sony?"
,Rod_The_Bod,2007-10-15T00:43Z,Does anyone know how many files there should be? Can't extract it :(
,smorchie,2007-10-22T23:31Z,"HI, WILL THIS WORK ON PSP 3.74?  I don't wanna waste my time downloading if not"
,crazycroc,2007-11-25T00:00Z,sorry smorchie but you need to have custom firmware to run these games like m33 or OE.
,elyk1212,2007-12-27T23:34Z,"smorchie, I am pretty sure you can still change to custom firmware from 3.74.  

You may need to look into the ""Pandora's Battery"" & ""Magic Memory Stick"" technique.  To make a Pandora's battery you will need to borrow someones fat PSP (or you can buy a 'pandora battery'. 

 Anyway, google away."

,Marcus101RR,2008-08-02T07:26Z,"You need to extract it, if its not an ISO, then make it into one with PowerISO."
,bigboy94,2008-08-31T13:21Z,"Hi um, great torrent but i put it on da psp and everytime i load it it says ""The Game Could not be Started.

,354,2008-12-12T22:47Z,"Hi,
Just wondering if anyone has got this to work on 4.01 M33. I have downloaded lots of games and none have worked.

Thanks"
,hamyo5,2008-12-29T07:11Z,"i have 3.71 m33 and i dont have sony no umd driver. ionly have m33 driver, sony np9660, oe isofs and normal and none work plz help i hope i did not download for nothing"
,amongtheflames,2009-12-19T22:04Z,"what is the protocol for getting these multiple file downloads playing? so far, i have been just avoiding them. email amongtheflames11@yahoo.com with the answer"
,MartinWellbourne,2010-02-19T19:15Z,"Thanks, changoboy. Classic game."
,MartinWellbourne,2010-02-20T12:11Z,"@amongtheflames.  Sorry dude, but I'm not emailing you. Just right click on one of the files and click 'Extract files.....' (assuming you have winrar, of course). select a destination and click 'ok'. winrar will automatically compile an iso out of the files in the folder. Assuming, also, that you have gen cfw you won't have any trouble playing this if you select the m33 driver on your psp."
,Lomedin,2011-04-20T05:44Z,Tried with HEN6.35 and seems to work fine. Thanks a mil =)
