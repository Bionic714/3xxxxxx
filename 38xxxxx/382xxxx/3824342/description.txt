Important: 

Please only download this proper release and not the old 'FIFA_08-FLT' because 
there seems to be problems at some points in the game, where it just freezes.
We have double checked this release and it should work fine on all capable PCs.  


Steps:

1. Download it.
2. Unrar it.
3. Write image to DVD and insert into drive or mount ISO.
4. Install the game (you will find the key from downloaded .txt file).
5. Replace original ..exe in Fifa 2008 directory with the one in DVD/mounted iso.
6. Play the game (don't take DVD out /unmount ISO).



Enjoy :)
