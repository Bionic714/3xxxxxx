Doug Kinney is in need of a little help. With a demanding job, an adoring wife and two children who have baseball matches and ballet lessions to attend, there just simply aren't enough hours in the day to enjoy any of it.
Doug's real problem is that he as too many commitments and not enough time! He is literally on the verge of a breakdown when, quite by chance, he meets the world famous geneticist, Dr Owen Leeds, who offers Doug the opportunity to regain control of his life... if he agrees to have himself cloned. Doug agrees - with hilarious consequences.
