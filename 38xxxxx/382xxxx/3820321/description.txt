L CAPONE JJ a.k.a. 357magnum, was born and grew up in the township of Gugulethu outside Capetown, South Africa. Growing up amid the crime and violence of the ghetto, JJ found a path through music, and under the influence of his father. 

He is now living and working in Berlin, spreading positive vibes through the sound systems and clubs. He MCs regularly at Kiki Blofeld, Yaam, Casiopaia and Fraystil, and he has opened shows in Berlin for Jah Mason and Ganjaman. In July 2006 he started work with Berlin-based Samy Masoud and Aldubb, aka Soundwarriors. Realising the potential of the young MC, Soundwarriors produced, recorded and mixed JJ?s first album, titled ?No Offense!? It features 17 songs, ranging across the reggae landscape from Roots-Reggae (check ?Free Sensimilla? / ?In Life? / ?True Rastaman? ) to Dancehall (check ?She say me do it well?, ?KYD-Story? / ?Something Special?) and even HipHop (check ?Roll High? / ?Gal?). 

The album features additional riddim tracks from Ganjaman, I am Music, Big Finger, 40 Fyah and JahSouljah and artists Black Kappa, Soultrain, Crystal Axe and Zoro. 

JJ is currently building his own label, called ?KYD-Records?, named after KYD native yard 12, the Gugulethu township yard where JJ grew up. Through this, he continues his original mission of supporting the ghetto youth of his neighbourhood. 
JJ, also known as Vusumzi Ngubane, has an exciting international musical career to look forward to. This artist?s star starts to shine?
