[V],Kuthumi,2007-10-09T08:05Z,What happened to the seeding?
[V],Kuthumi,2007-10-12T16:17Z,"Early viewing shows good picture quality and stereo sound. But please continue the seeding, no-one has reached more than 28.8% yet."
,digitalfairy,2007-11-04T00:03Z,"my download stopped at 62%, please seed someone. thanks!"
[V],Kuthumi,2007-11-14T07:24Z,"Evidently, the uploader has limited capacity, he/she has connected only a few hours now and then and not been able to seed us more than up to 63% after more than a month. But please hang in there, megalilo! Close your other torrents, turn your upload speed to ""unlimited"" and let the rest of us take over the seeding when someone has reached 100%."
[V],Kuthumi,2007-12-03T11:34Z,We are still waiting at 80% for the seeder to connect. I have sent an error message to PB.
,ElWoOdBr,2008-01-15T12:49Z,"SEDDS, PLEASE, SEEDS!!!"
,megalilo,2008-01-19T19:00Z,"Hi everyone. Please, pardon me for late. I'll seed tomorrow. ;)"
[V],Kuthumi,2008-01-21T07:52Z,Thank you megalilo for coming back.
