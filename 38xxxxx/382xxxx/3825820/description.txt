\\\"this cd is my most prized posession. i\\\'ve memorized every word of every song, every line of melody and harmony... every song is completely different, fantastically moody, magically brilliant... what poetry in his lyrics! what passion in his voice! i\\\'m convinced i will never own an album i prize more than this one. i\\\'d give it a sky full of stars, but since i can only give five, that\\\'s what i\\\'ll do.\\\" Amazon
