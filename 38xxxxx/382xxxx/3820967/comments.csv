,JumperPunk,2007-11-09T03:45Z,"same way you trust any other torrents.  dont.  run a malware scan when download it, try it in an isolated environment (stand-alone, a vm, etc).  im about to install this in a virtual machine my self to test out what updates i need to integrate in my disk.  ill report what i find."
,JumperPunk,2007-11-09T03:53Z,"or maybe i just lied.  i thought this was the xp update, so im not going to post w/ an update.  1st part of the post still applies."
