,The_Lord,2007-10-12T23:37Z,Great torrent panpa except that rar50 in DVD3 is corrupt. If you could make a torrent with just emd-greysa33.r50 I'm sure that we are many that would be even more apreciative. 
,pablo-x,2007-10-13T03:12Z,"Rarfix is floating around, sadly only on private trackers......It's approx. 90mb so it should fix r50 and r92..... So it's a common problem! If somebody has acces to these trackers (just google it) and upload it here, highly appreciated. BTW thanks for the series; great uploads......"
,mmmsnafu,2007-10-17T19:36Z,"Just check the box in WinRar that says ""keep broken files"". The resulting ISO-file burned perfectly and the result was watchable in my DVD-player without any (noticeable at least) difference.
So just download, burn and watch, it worked for me."
