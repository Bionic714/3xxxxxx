77 SUNSET STRIP
Season 1, Episode 2: "Lovely Lady Pity Me"
Stu Bailey's infatuation with a beautiful woman leads him into blackmail and suspicion of murder.

Note: The Stu Bailey character was originated by Roy Huggins in a story called "Death and the Skylark", published in Esquire Magazine in December 1952. Huggins later adapted this story into an episode of Warner Bros' ABC TV series Conflict entitled "Anything for Money", broadcast on 16 Apr 1957, starring Efrem Zimbalist Jr. This led to the idea of building a series around the private eye character. The feature-length "Girl on the Run", which was used for pre-screening, had Stu Bailey as the lead and Edd Byrnes as the murderer. Now in this episode the show takes shape with co-star Roger Smith as partner, Jeff Spencer, Edd Byrnes transformed by popular demand into "Kookie" the car park attendant, and Jacqueline Beer as Suzanne Favray, the firms secretary. It also now has its catchy theme song.
