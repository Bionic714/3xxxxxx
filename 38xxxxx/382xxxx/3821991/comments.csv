,Inspire_Hate,2007-09-28T08:23Z,"I don't see any sync issues. Quality may be a lil low, but that's it. 

Maybe you should watch it instead of just reading what someone else writes. BTW read the user agreement. Something about 5000 euros??? LOL"
,buffyboy,2007-09-28T08:31Z,the sound comes a little bit after when they talk if you are not blind you will notice that in the end of the episode...
,buffyboy,2007-09-28T08:38Z,"i said i'm sorry about my upload,something is wrong with it..but i have fixed it and uploaded a new one that's works perfect except the sync issues!!!   "
,Inspire_Hate,2007-09-28T08:44Z,"OH-Ok! And, we all know how good your word is.
Like I said before, I didn't see anything wrong. Works perfectly for me, but, then again, I can click a mouse with the best of 'em . Do the world a favor and stop trying to be helpful. 

I'm uploading both WORKING files mentioned here for those of you still trying to get this ep."
,buffyboy,2007-09-28T08:52Z,maybe you should try and download one of my other uploads and see if it works..i don't upload fake torrents..
,ArkhamAsylum,2007-09-28T11:37Z,"buffyboy has been spamming his link all over every smallville torrent, don't download from him, he just wants attention."
,LupinVII,2007-09-28T12:45Z,"I notice the sync issues too, it happens about the time when Chloe is watching the home video of Lana and her in New York. Also I noticed the color is a bit wierd too, like when clark is walking his shirt is skipping around."
,GOBig,2007-09-28T15:45Z,Ty so much Smallville FTW
