And for people complaining about the speed, if you happen to be using utorrent you can set the priority to high on one or two of the files so that they'll download first (theoretically,) and then you can read/work on/practice with those while the others download. "

I used to get a popup when I selected to download something that would show me the contents of the download and I could unselect some files if I didn't want them.  I wanted to download this, but based on the file list in comments I know there are a few books I don't want.  How in the world do I get that back?  I'm not even sure why it stopped showing up.  x-x"
