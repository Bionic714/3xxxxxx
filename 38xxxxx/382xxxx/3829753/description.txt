UBCD4Win is a bootable CD which contains software that allows you to repair, restore, or diagnose almost any computer problem. The goal is to be the ultimate free hardware and software diagnostic tool. All software included in UBCD4Win are freeware utilities for Windows. UBCD4Win is based on Bart's PE. Bart's PE builds a Windows "pre-install" environment CD, basically Windows booted from CD. Included are many free hardware and software diagnostic tools that allow you to fix almost any problem you will face with your computer. With network support, the ability to modify NTFS volumes, recover deleted files, create new NTFS volumes, scan hard drives for viruses, etc. this project includes almost everything you need to repair your system problems. This project has been put together to be the ultimate recovery cd and not a replacement OS (Operating System). Please visit the "List of Tools" page for a complete list of what is included in the latest version of the project.
