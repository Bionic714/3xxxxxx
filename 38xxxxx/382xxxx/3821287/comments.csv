,elfkkk,2009-10-10T07:32Z,"Hi, folks!

I'm looking for the NTSC version from this Whitesnake Anniversary Edition DVD, because discs on the PAL color system don't work well here!

Is there somebody here that had it on the NTSC version to upload in Torrent or HTML?

Thanks for your attention!

See ya!^^"
