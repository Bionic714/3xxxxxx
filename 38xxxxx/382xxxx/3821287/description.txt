Released in 2007 as 20th Anniversary Special Edition. 1987 was a huge commercial success and pinnacle in Whitesnake's musical career. This album has it all: big hair, huge sound, sexy compositions, soaring vocals and virtuoso guitar hero John Sykes. There has been many versions available of this album before, and it just feels confusing which songs appears where. Here we have all b-sides and bonus tracks that have never been relesed before in one CD... plus 4 live tracks and a DVD with four music videos and four live videos complete with menues. And all this is remastered for true Whitesnake fans. A total package!
