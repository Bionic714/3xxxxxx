From Prussia With Love:

When a German damsel turns up in the Nag's Head she's definitely in distress - and nine months pregnant at that. Rodney's all beer and sympathy bu Del's got an idea - could this be the answer to Boycie and Marlene's dreams of a child and a golden opportunity to make a few bob along the way?

The Miracle Of Peckham:

Del reckons he's discovered a miracle. The statue of the Virgin Mary at the local church has been spotted weeping. Del soon has the cream of the world's media paying to fill the event - and, of course, its nothing to do with a leaky church roof.

The Longest Night:

A robber makes a raid on a local supermarket just as Del and his family are out shopping. What's worse - Del sold him a duff watch down the market and its that that's got them into trouble in the first place.

Tea For Three:

Look out! Del's tampered with the sunbed controls and Rodney's seeing red - literally! He'll hardly wow Trigger's lovely niece, Lisa, with his good looks now - which leaves the way pretty clear for Del himself. But revenge should certainly be sweet when he volunteers Del for a spot of hang-gliding...

Video Nasty:

Rodney has gained a grant from the local council to make a community film and Del soon see's its earning potential. Mickey Pearce on the other hand sees the chance to make a far more dodgy type of movie.

Who Wants To Be A Millionaire:

Del's old pal Jumbo Mills is back with tales of his booming business in Australia. What's more he wants Del to go back down under with him as his partner in enterprise. Could Del really leave Peckham for good?

Enjoy!
