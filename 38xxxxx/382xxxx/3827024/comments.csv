,assmblg09,2007-12-13T22:44Z,"hey everyone, i have mac osx and i was having similar problems with a lot of folks. i extracted the rar file, used toast to make a disc image of the reason.iso, then i mounted it, tried to copy it to my apps, then when i ran it from my apps, it asked me for the DVD!

okay problem solved:
this may not work for everyone but it worked for me and remember i have osx.
follow these steps:
1.)extract the .rar file
2.)simply change the .iso file extension to .dmg in Get info
3.)Use toast to mount directly (from the utilities toolbar) the .dmg file you just made
4.)Move Reason folder to your apps
5.)THEN try running Reason from your apps folder and you will not be prompted for the DVD! 

for some reason these steps worked perfectly for me. i think it was because i directly changed the file extension and/or mounting the .iso or .dmg DIRECTLY as opposed to making a DISC IMAGE. Hopefully this helps!"

,GAVB,2008-05-29T09:19Z,just run teh setup its an air release ! thanks
,CourtD,2008-06-02T05:56Z,"For those of you with Macs and do not have Toast and do not want to download it just so that you can mount the file as a DVD, there IS a MUCH EASIER WAY TO DO THIS!

Reason asks for a DVD because, as Scorp16 said, the Reason folder is missing some files. But, if the image in the download is also the image for the DVD, then the files are contained within the DVD. For those of you who did go the Toast route, you'd have noticed that after you 'insert the dvd' all it does is copy two files (""Factory Sound Bank.rfl"" and ""Orkester.rfl"") into the Reason directory. And if you noticed, during a toast-less mount of Reason, there is a folder labeled ""Sound Banks"" with those very two files within it. See where I am going with this?

Now, without further ado, the steps:
1. Expand the Rar file (I used RAR Expander)
2. Double click on Reason.iso so that it mounts itself
3. Open the mount, and you should get a splash screen that gets you to copy the Reason Folder into the Application folder. (Most of you should have gotten this far on your own, only to find that when running reason, it asks for a DVD. Don't worry we'll fix this next.)
4. Open the Reason folder in your Application folder as well as the ""Sound Banks"" Folder in the mount
5. Copy the files ""Factory Sound Bank.rfl"" and ""Orkester.rfl"" into the Reason Folder
6. Run Reason and it should run the rest regularly with no asking for a DVD

Thanks to Scorp16, assmblg09, darkdrive2047 and Juggz."

I'm so trying to get a new torrent, hoping that it'll works better. I just don't understand why this stupid software is searching for 2 files it already got. The software is installed, and it ask me to insert this f***ing DVD, instead that it could work perfectly anyway...grrrr i'm becoming crazy. On pc, things were easier... ;-)
Could you please explain me again how to make this DVD ask off? Is it possible to get the location of the 2 missing files before while it's asking us to insert the dvd?

Major crazy-inducing problem here!
Ive used reason 4 for win for some time now, probably about a year or so. But today I got this message when I started it:""File not Found - The Operation could not be completed because a file could not be found."" I tried a few more times, no result.
So I uninstalled it, REinstalled it THREE times, no go. 
Any one know what might have happened?
And how I can fix it?
Im quite experienced in the black arts of computer, but this just TICKS ME OFF!

1) downloaded.
2) verified download was good.
3) used WinRAR to join the files to make ISO.
4) burned ISO image to DVD+R using Nero.
5) verified DVD burn after burning.
6) installed from DVD (auto run works).
7) after installed finished, started Reason.

""File not Found - The Operation could not be completed because a file could not be found""

So I cant go on to step 8

8) when Reason starts it will finish the install.
9) finished install and asked for serial.
10) used keygen to create a serial.
11) done!

If any of you out there can help me with this Id seriously pay you!! I need my Reason to live!

I even tried changing the name Reason4DvD file to Reason4DvD.iso, and it still doesn't work. :(
I don't get what the step ""join the files to make ISO."" 
The steps I'm taking are as follows; I download the torrent; I get the keygen & Propellerhead Reason 4.0 winrar file; then I open it up with winrar & I see: 
acrobat reader, other propellerhead products, sound banks, autorun.exe, autorun.ini, install reason.exe, readme.rtf, reason4dvd.ico

now I extract it to a folder i named ""reason"" on my desktop; now I see all the files but no .iso image. just for curiosity I checked the sound banks folder to see if there are image files that I can mount with daemon tools but they are .rfl files and It seems they are not mountable.

download the torrent file. 

once it gets 100% finishe, open it with a program called ""winrar"".

next using winrar , extract the reason 4 files to your desktop in a new folder and BAM! there it is!"

,Steng123,2009-11-05T00:58Z,"This torrent fucked me for a while but I eventually got it working.  Running Windows XP:

_Download PowerISO.  Installed, and checked every box on file types to work eg; .Iso, .Daa.  

_Extracted entirety of torrent content with WinRar to a new folder which I created (which I called REASON).  

_Mounted entiriety of my (REASON) folder with PowerISO.

_Automatically started installing, when asked for registration code, entered a serial no (someone's posted a few in the comments).

BINGO

I spent ages trying to get this working, burning DVDs etc, hitting 'Please insert DVD' all the shit, and finally!  Now to get some Refills..."
,ad80ad,2009-11-26T19:46Z,"DEFINITIVE SOLUTION TO SKIP ""INSERT DVD"" ISSUE.

The file contains a lot of .rar archives. YOU HAVE TO SELECT THEM ALL AND UNPACK. It takes a lot of time, because it rewrites several times ths ISO image. If the system ask you ""Reason 4.0.ISO already exist"", click to substitute ""all files"". DON'T STOP BEFORE ALL .RAR ARCHIVES ARE UNPACKED, EVEN IF YOU SEE ALREADY THE 2 GB ISO ICON. If you stop before that, the .iso will be incomplete and the programm will ever ask for it."
,Silvestervella,2009-11-30T15:27Z,I downloaded about 10 different torrents of reason 4.0.....i even tried the demo from the propellerhead website....why it never works on my vista?????  this is driving me insane...i want reason on vista and windows 7...can anyone help pls?????
,barsathevil,2009-12-25T10:47Z,i have a back up of reason  in my computer...cant i install it from there? plz help...noob here
,Beelziel,2009-12-25T19:25Z,"I used WINRAR to unpackage it. i sent everything to a folder on my desktop. it seems to have loaded fine, but it says i need to insert a disk."
,top_shatta,2009-12-26T23:11Z,Finnally got it working. To install after download there are a number of winRAR files right click on the first one and click extract files it will create a folder automatically called reason 4 and all files will be extracted there (takes a while). An ISO image file will be created in the folder called reason4. Using PowerISO or any other similar program create a virtual drive and mount the ISO file. Istallation will start.

,190919,2010-05-04T15:35Z,"******INSTALL REASON 4 HOW TO******

1. OPEN DISK ULITLY 
2. DRAG REASON.DMG TO DISK UTILITY
3.DRAG (ONLY REASON FILE) TO YOUR APPS!
4.OPEN REASON IN YOUR APPS FOLDER
5.INSERT DVD AND BAM! IT WORKS. (MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE OR SO)

someone on hear said open the DMG file then open reason and insert the DVD! if you do that it says ""not enough free space"" and you confused the drive! not that confusing if you figure it out.

also, look on this page! their are a ton of serial numbers on here. so, QUIT ASKING FOR THEM THEY WORK! you can even search for on google. iserals rhapidshare and download that! it gives 100's of 1,000's of numbers for just about every program I am the Mac guru!"

I downloaded all 1.94 Gigs of this torrent and All I got was about 30 or 40 unreadable unload-able ""R00, R01, R02 etc."" files.

No Rar, No Zip, No Setup No readme, just a bunch of random files about 40,000-48,000 MB in size each.

Am I the only one experiencing this? and DOes anyone know what happened or what to do. I have no idea

PLEASE!"

install reason 4;
and before running it you must:
   mount .iso image (with daemon tools for example)
   copy folder ""Sound Banks"" to the folder you choose to install reason 4

run reason 4, configure and quit to desktop;

unmount .iso image and no more aking for cd.

this is working for me. I hope that work for you too."
