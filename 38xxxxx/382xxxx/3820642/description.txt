The Cisco VPN Client for Windows is software that runs on a Microsoft
  Windows -based PC. The VPN Client on a remote PC, communicating with a
  Cisco Easy VPN server on an enterprise network or with a service provider,
  creates a secure connection over the Internet. Through this connection you
  can access a private network as if you were an on-site user. Thus you have
  a Virtual Private Network (VPN). The server verifies that incoming
  connections have up-to-date policies in place before establishing them.
  Cisco IOS, VPN 3000 Series Concentrators, and PIX central-site servers can
  all terminate VPN connections from VPN Clients. As a remote user (low speed
  or high speed), you first connect to the Internet. Then you use the VPN
  Client to securely access private enterprise networks through a Cisco VPN
  server that supports the VPN client.
