,irate976,2009-11-06T21:56Z,WTF is rar and why won't it play? I got this file and my computer can't open it.
,eclipse11,2009-11-18T12:39Z,"@irate976:
rar is most advanced audio file format in the whole history of audio file formats.
unfortunately you must have a brand new core i7 cpu to play it."

Although it IS highly amusing for the rest of us..... On a side note eclipse11: how do I encode my audio files in rawr? Lion Encoder? lol"

,nakashtii,2011-01-25T20:56Z,"I just got a new computer and have never been able to play rar files. I have a few questions at times about playing certain files. Every one here seems to promote seeding. We all should be just as eager to promote info and tips to newbies (like me) as well. No one should be knocked for asking questions. The more people who learn how to download, share and seed, the more we all benifit. Thanks."
,DavidDeath,2011-03-04T14:48Z,"Blind is one of my fave albums, love it

Rar files can't be opened on a normal PC - C'mon people - if you're cool enough to be interested in the Corrosion Of Conformity torrent here - then I'm going to let you know that a Rar file is just a group of files which have been ""packed"" to make it easy to download.

Just use a free program like Z-Zip to open these files and it will reveal the MP3s for you to listen to :)"
,DavidDeath,2011-03-04T15:03Z,"Great quality, clean torrent - Thank you very much Westy79  :)"
,nastrudamus,2011-04-28T21:21Z,"hahahaha. 

will seed as long as i can. thx dude!"
,Orion22444,2012-02-27T21:58Z,"Just a suggestion..  U don't usually know what your getting when U download a RAR file. I like RAR compression as opposed to ZIP.
They seem to usually locked, unplayable, or copyright protected - I've never actually gotten one that wasn't. I hope this one is good. But its a good practice to scan this stuff with a good virus scanner before opening the files."
,Orion22444,2012-02-27T22:00Z,And thanks for the tip David.
,TheKP69,2012-05-03T04:31Z,"""I cant play rar files"".... What is society coming to..."
