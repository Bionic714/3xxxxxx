It is the real thing, I have it installed on my macine,  but during the manip that 4X-AXG did to share with us this very nice soft, Thanks to you very very much for this, 2 parts are probably missing, as the scenery config makes entry for 5 parts, and 2 are missing.
SO3 and 4 are missing
I can leave with out those 2 missing parts, as I leaved with out that scenery till today...

Thanks so much for sharing this"
