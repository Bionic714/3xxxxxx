,AsylumInsomnia,2009-07-02T02:15Z,"A good torrent. Decent speeds and worth downloading if you like Doom. Very well seeded. I'll leave my computer on overnight to seed this, and maybe the next night. Thank you."
,Turnate,2010-03-25T19:02Z,@thebest23 Just drag the file onto the zDoom icon.
,bookworm1960,2011-02-24T08:17Z,"Thank you for this collection of great add-on wad-files for DOOM II!

DOOM was the first PC game I ever bought, and though I don't have that first disk now, I DO have ""DOOM Collectors Edition"" which has Ultimate DOOM, DOOM II, and Final DOOM all on one disk.

Looks like it's time to re-install so I can explore these wad-files!"
