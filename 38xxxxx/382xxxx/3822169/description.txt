MixMeister BPM Analyzer is a free program you can use to automatically detect the exact BPM (beats per minute) of any song. The tags in most digital music files provide no BPM information at all, and others contain estimates, which are often inaccurate. Whether you're choosing songs to mix together, building a playlist for a specific mood, or comparing different versions of a song, BPM Analyzer makes finding the correct BPM easy.

This is a simple program, but the BPM measurement engine is adapted from MixMeister Technology's award-winning line of pro DJ software, and it generates accurate BPM. MixMeister BPM Analyzer supports dragging and dropping files from Windows Explorer and various Media Players (Itunes, WMP, etc.). It also allows you to sort your music list by Title, Artist, or BPM. You can update ID3 tags in your music files with exact BPM information, print BPM reports for your entire music collection, or even export BPM counts for use in other programs like Excel or music databases.
