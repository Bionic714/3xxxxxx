Compiled and customized by Aaron Bewza (www.blackwidowfarms.net).

These ringtones are definitely LOTS of fun because they are so totally obnoxious and disruptive... annoy your family! friends!
...even your boss! Most inappropriate for social gatherings such
as weddings, funerals, dinners, dates, school plays, board meetings
and so on. I mostly just thought that since mobile phones are
annoying enough already, we might as well go the extra distance
and ensure they live up to their reputation. Who's with me? :D

I gathered and /or built all of these from far and wide, 
compressed the #$&$! out of them.They are all encoded to: 
  32 kbps, 22.1 khz
*except for "dog whistle" which is
  112 kbps, 44.1 khz (so it remains audible)
and: "air raid 1" & "air raid 2" are
   16 kbps, 16 khz . 

These are the 101 files, 2.8 mb total:

aaron yell, air raid 1-7, air wrench, alarm clock, aoogah 1-4,
boing!, bong hit, bubbles, can opener, canaries, car alarm, 
car crash, car start, cartoons, cat meow, chainsaw 1-4, 
clown horn, cows, cuckoo clock 1-2, dentist drill 1-3, 
dialing, dog 1-2, dog whistle, doorbell, dying battery, 
foghorn, glass smash, glitch 1-4, harley, hi freq 1-2, horse, 
hose, jackhammer, jake brake, modem 1-3, mosquito, 
old phone, peter griffin, phone glitch, robot chirp, 
robot drill, robot laugh, robot servos, robot tweak,

For those of you who DL'ed the original package of 50, 
those ones are in this package as well... just smaller filesizes.
Because the original package was so popular, I expanded
the collection to 101.
