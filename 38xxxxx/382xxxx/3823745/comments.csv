,powerchrd,2007-09-30T17:18Z,"Doesn't work. Gets to the intro screen and just says loading...

Burned it with Toast 8 as a Disk Copy and used Verbatium DVDR. ISO just does not work properly. Game isn't even set to release until October 2nd."
,marrtin,2007-09-30T19:31Z,"I burned iso alcohol 120, 4 x speed and works perfectly:) Thanks again Changoboy"
,powerchrd,2007-09-30T20:38Z,"So Martin, what do you suggest I am doing incorrectly?"
,powerchrd,2007-09-30T21:02Z,"I have burned it with 3 different DVD-R's and at 2x & 4x on my Mac Intel Mini 8x burner and everytime it stopped at the intro screen: loading... and that's it.

Is this working for everyone else? Any suggestions.."

,The_Uhre,2008-02-06T20:08Z,Does it work on PS3 60GB ?? 
,gusfleury,2008-02-07T02:23Z,"I downloaded it and it worked perfectly. I used Nero StartSmart v.7 to burn to a cheap DVD at 8x (11,080 KB/s) using an LG DRD-RW. At first I thought I'd have that ""loading indefinetely"" issue, cause I left it for more than I thought would be normal... then I pressed ""X"" and it loaded.

Anyway, this thing should work, folks!"
