,blamface,2007-10-02T00:34Z,"This does NOT work on Intel Macs!  You'd really only want this if you are trying to install an OS on an OLD Mac, like a Performa."
,maini4ka,2007-10-03T11:59Z,"Thank you so much, Blamface!  Have been looking for this.  Apple should make old OS abandonware."
[T],magumagu,2007-10-03T17:53Z,"They do; google for: old apple os

www dot info dot apple dot com slash support slash oldersoftwarelist dot html"
,blamface,2007-10-04T01:13Z,"The link that magumagu refers to has free UPDATES, but it does not have full copies of OS 8 or 9."

,(-Rip-),2011-04-25T23:55Z,"If I had a dollar for every comment asking if it worked on an Intel Mac, I'd be as rich as Steve Jobs...
If I had a penny for every comment asking if it worked on a PC, I'd have more money than Steve Jobs AND Bill Gates..."

,Brickstin,2012-03-07T10:10Z,this DMG image is worthless: I tried three  different burning software programs to burn this image then I decided to use Magic ISo and others to actually open up the DMG image.. the DMG's first partition Partition 1 is damaged and cannot be inflated.. This is a wasteful download and not even worth bothering with: IT took me a fucking week to download.. What a waste of my time.
