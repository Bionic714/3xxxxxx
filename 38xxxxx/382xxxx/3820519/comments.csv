,AnimeGod5012ad,2007-10-23T19:16Z,Well sexylikestotalk how about we have a conversation lets begin by answering the question of why would you upload a 5.79gb file and not care   to seed it? Like everyone else Im stuck @ 15%. I don't get why people bother to upload torrents and then don't seed them. Like wutdafuxup if anyone has this please seed it i will do the same as I always do. Peace can't wait for Deathnote.
