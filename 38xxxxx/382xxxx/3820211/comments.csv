Invalid Torrent File!"
,chatbleu,2007-09-26T21:19Z,"you might want to pay attention ---if you are really intent on offering this torrent to Pirate Bayers ...
One can only assume after a number of hours that 
this is a total fake!"

,draig_arian,2007-09-26T23:31Z,"Nice, guys. First torrent here, and what do I get!!! 

There are currently around 30 leechers happily downloading, several with more than 75 percent. The file is definitely NOT fake. I just downloaded this torrent to test, and looked at it with Torrent$py. It's fine. No idea why yours is invalid. 

BTW, I tried to comment earlier, but kept getting database errors."
,chatbleu,2007-09-27T02:45Z,"waste of time ---total con job...
don't believe the numbers....
the guys a creep"
,outofkill,2007-10-09T00:32Z,perfectly good torrent. perfectly good quality. don't believe the techno dunces. I hope uploader hasn't been discouraged from offering future niche gems.
,Bloobbusta,2007-10-10T15:16Z,"I think it was Industry hacks trying to deter us. Great Quality 10/10 and Great Upload, I wish more uploaders would bring such rare films and not Hollywood-trash out! RESPECT to draig_arian - don't be put off and I look fwd to more of your gems!"
,draig_arian,2007-10-11T01:38Z,"Thanks to the last two guys. Don't know what all the ""fake"" shit was about, but will upload more torrents in the future."
,Guthenberg,2007-11-24T18:38Z,"A very important movie! You've got to watch it.  I had no tproblems with it.
What are the unions doing about it? This film calls for soldarity!"
,eggontoastman,2008-06-19T17:33Z,"LOvEly riP
NOT FAKE
dont believe the bullshit
Nice one m8"
,BurningR,2008-07-26T18:07Z,"Thanks a lot mate. Just started d/l'ing, so can't say if it's a fake, but I doubt that the blokeheads who uploads fakes would choose to disguise it as a Ken Loach film... they woulnd't know him, me thinks."
,orfeo,2008-08-22T12:20Z,This is NOT a fake! I just looked at it in VLC and with a quick glance it looked like DVD quailty and was the same film as the title! But do go see the film! It's sort of independent with low budget so gp see it in the cinemas and pay your respects...with yur money! take a potential girlfriend with you! you are goning to have to comfort her after this for sure!
,SaribeN,2008-10-10T09:05Z,Thanks! Great movie. Works perfect with VLC and even with QuickTime Player!
,HappyEnjoy,2008-11-08T07:26Z,"Very compelling movie. Nice to be able to find something outside of the mainstream shit!
Torrent worked just fine, great audio/video quality, no problems at all. Will keep seeding this. "
