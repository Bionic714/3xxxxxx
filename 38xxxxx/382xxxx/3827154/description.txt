Release Notes 
Take it! its deep, cold and dark killer
music!
14 psytrance tracks for your personal
meditations and for the dancefloor as well
Dark but not vicious, fast but not necessary
a average dance album The album is definitely
against fashion depression peeps, even if has
a schizoid, paranoic feel trip into the
depths of dark mindstates but not in a
lethargic, stuporous tone. enjoy!
