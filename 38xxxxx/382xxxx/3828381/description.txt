A Wasting of Life

This game is a small, addictive game which I play during my CoH sessions. It doesn\'t have any awesome graphics and mind numbing sound, but it does get you hooked.
You can even create maps using just MSPaint and your imagination.

PS: Yes, the sounds are all from Counterstrike.

Installation:
Just Unzip the downloaded file and play by executing AWOL.exe
