,glisk,2007-09-29T08:13Z,"It does work just as easily.  How are you encoding?  Does yout video capture device cap directly to WMV? I suppose that makes it convenient.
My capture device is old - it captures to MPEG-2 and then I have to use avisynth and virtualdub to convert to XviD.
If you need any help on encoding, I can try to assist, though I am unfamiliar with your hardware."

is a good converter :)"
,jhinx,2007-09-29T15:31Z,"Well i have a vista media center, so its really just easiest to skip all the fancy stuff and use the windows movie maker, cuz it converts it to wmv without me first having to use avivo to convert the dvr-ms file. so one less conversion for me."

You have have to make sure you dl the one with all the available codecs and there will be no more worries. For the handful that cannot play or have issues, I use VLC as my secondary choice. "
