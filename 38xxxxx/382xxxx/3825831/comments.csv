I rearranged the order and this worked for me.  And all this work was worth it b/c I love Brazil and movies about food.  Thank you Blimmel.

Change the file name of  VTS_02_01.VOB to VTS_02_0.VOB then make it last in queue

The rest of the files should go in this order...
VIDEO_TS.BUP 
VIDEO_TS.IFO
VIDEO_TS.VOB 
VTS_01_0.BUP
VTS_01_0.IFO
VTS_01_0.VOB
VTS_01_1.VOB
VTS_01_2.VOB
VTS_01_3.VOB
VTS_01_4.VOB
VTS_02_0.BUP
VTS_02_0.IFO
VTS_02_0.VOB

If you mess-up you can use other DVD's to check the file order. Look in the VIDEO_TS folder.

I will seed this for 2 or 3 days"
