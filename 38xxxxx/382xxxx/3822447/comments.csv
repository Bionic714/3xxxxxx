why put up mps encoding and call it flac?

Flawless Lossless Audio Codec means it is not lossy.  [FLAC]

mp3 is not for audiophiles, You have millions  who don't know or care the difference.  BTW, why are you NOT seeding?  Recode these of original media  EAC>FLAC ( EAC is Exact Audio Copy) Join the big dogs "
