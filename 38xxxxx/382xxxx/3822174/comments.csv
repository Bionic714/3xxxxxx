,dreamdragon,2007-10-04T03:26Z,"Well if the dude who did put this shit up could AT LEAST check the quality before he did actually seed it! I would be most greatfull... 1,35 gib for shit-quality. 

Video quality: 4/10 

Sound quality: 7/10

Movie: 6,5/10

Though the quality are shit, the movie was atleast above my expectations. High-tech gadgets, hot babes, zombie-slaughtering and abit of horror did earn this 6,5/10. I just wish that they could had worked harder on the horror-part in this movie, its so weak to be scary. "
