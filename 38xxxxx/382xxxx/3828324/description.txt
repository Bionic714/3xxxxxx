PLOT:
What if you only had three months to live? For Anna Carter, it's a nightmare come true.
Diagnosed with a terminal illness at 28, Anna's high flying lifestyle has come crashing down.
As the director of a foundation that funds programs to help children, she has strived to
make life better for kids. But now she sees the world through different eyes.
And a colder heart. Rather than spend her final days on a beach watching sunsets,
Anna embarks on a personal quest -- to hunt down various miscreants who have hurt
children and exact vengeance for their crimes. Using her prestigious job as cover,
Anna travels the country in search of criminals who have slipped through cracks in the justice system.
Dispensing her own style of brutal retribution. But with the police closing in and death knocking at her door,
will she be able to complete her plan before time runs out? And will she be considered a hero... or a sociopath?
"Juncture" is the exciting first film in the Anna Carter trilogy, following the final journey of an ordinary woman
turned vigilante. A controversial action thriller that casts a harsh light on the darkness,
perversion and greed lurking just beneath the surface of today's society. Anna Carter is on a mission. And only death will stop her.
