Chapter 0 Why This Book Is So Cool                                     1
  This is where we discover just why this book is so cool, and
  also why this chapter is numbered ?0.?
Chapter 1 Introducing Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers                   7
  In this chapter we introduce the concepts of the binary and
  hexadecimal number systems (but in a much more interesting
  manner than most computer books).
Chapter 2 Computers and Calculators                                   23
  Here we rampage through the insides of a simple computer
  and calculator, and we also meet our virtual DIY Calculator.
Chapter 3 Subroutines and Other Stuff                                 35
  In this smorgasbord of a chapter, we first discuss logical, shift,
  and rotate instructions; then we plunge headfirst into the
  stack, subroutines, recursion, and the concept of self-
  modifying code.
Chapter 4 Integer Arithmetic                                          69
  This is where we learn the concepts of signed and unsigned
  binary arithmetic, and multibyte data representations. In the
  labs associated with this chapter we create some integer-based
  math subroutines for use in Chapter 5.
Chapter 5 Creating an Integer Calculator                             123
  This is where things really start to get interesting because we
  use the subroutines we developed in Chapter 4 to implement
  a simple four-function integer calculator.
Chapter 6 More Functions and Experiments                            135
  This may be the last chapter, but turn that frown upside down
  into a smile because this is where we discover additional
  projects you can undertake, and also how you can compete
  with other readers to create better math routines for your
  DIY Calculator.
Interactive Laboratories                                        155?412
  This is where you will find the interactive laboratories
  associated with Chapters 2 through 5 (see more details
  on page ix).
Appendix A Installing Your DIY Calculator                           413
  In this appendix, we learn how to install the virtual DIY
  Calculator presented on the CD-ROM accompanying
  this book.
Appendix B Addressing Modes                                         417
  Here we learn about the various addressing modes supported
  by the virtual microprocessor powering the DIY Calculator.
Appendix C Instruction Set Summary                                  429
  The tables in this appendix are useful for quickly determining
  which instructions are available with which addressing modes.
Appendix D Additional Resources                                     433
  There is a wealth of additional resources for individual
  readers and educators on the CD-ROM accompanying the
  book and from the DIY Calculator?s website. Also, there are
  lots of other really interesting books to read. This appendix
  explains it all.
