After about 50 restarts, every time i logged on a again windows told me i'd recovered from a serious error and isent an error report and finally it came up with a link for a microsoft download and that fixed it...cos this happened years ago and my new pc is fine i dont have the download, however i reccomend sending error reports when ever possible!!"

,^eRrOR^,2008-04-13T04:06Z,"works fine, tested on xp pro with 2 gig's of ram, nvidia 6200 256m ram graphics card, 2400 AMD Athlon T-bred, sound blaster audigy 2 sound card on an ASUS A7v8x delux motherboard with 550 gigs of hard drive space.

some files fail MD5 checks but thats down to the ip's stored in them being changed for custom mods.

apart from that it's all good, clean and virus free :)"
