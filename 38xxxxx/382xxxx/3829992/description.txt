Songs Of The Peoples Of The USSR

This is a rip from a rare EP, that my father played for me and my siblings when we were kids. Its origin is the U.S.S.R - I guess somewhere in the 1950's. We all learned to love the songs and tunes. I have searched the internet for anything like this, but in vane. So therefore it is a great pleasure to share it with you all. The quality is of course far from CD-quality, but is very close to the original EP with all the hums and noise that goes with it.
