1. What is "Extra M.A.M.E."?

Q. - What is "Extra M.A.M.E."?
A. - "Extra M.A.M.E." is a small MS Windows compatible GUI wrapper
     for M.A.M.E., the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator authored by Nicola
     Salmoria and the MAME team. M.A.M.E. let's you play thousands of
     old-school arcade games on your computer.


Q. - What makes "Extra M.A.M.E." better than other GUI wrappers for M.A.M.E.?
A. - "Extra M.A.M.E." is smaller and easier to use. It doesn't force you to 
     fuss with difficult configurations and it's compatible with all M.A.M.E 
     games.


Q. - How do I use "Extra M.A.M.E."? What additional files do I need?

        that are actually present on your system. After a fresh install, the 
        available list should be empty. You'll also need to download special
