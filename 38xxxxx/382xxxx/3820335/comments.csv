,a7Np210,2008-01-21T19:06Z,"The codec 'VP7' doesn't work/exist for Apple OS X or any Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE).

Waste of bandwidth in my opinion."
,JudasPriest2008,2008-04-29T05:00Z,"Hey Keggerman or anyone there who knows, how do i download this? As a first time user i have no idea whats going on. I hit download this torrent and it says open or save when i hit save it takes like 1 second and nothing happens frustrating. I have no idea what to do eh...."
,Xenity,2008-06-07T23:06Z,"Linux users can convert one of these 'VP7' files to a VLC-playable AVI file with this one-liner:
mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o /dev/null && mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:bitrate=950 -o destinationvideo.avi

Change 'somesourcevideo.avi' and 'destinationvideo.avi' to the input and output files respectively.  Requires 'mencoder' to be installed.  For batch processing, see the script on this page:

,scumbagmisfit,2009-01-04T01:41Z,I just spent 2 weeks downloading this and none of the files will play now it's finished! i'm using vlc never had problems like this before
,scumbagmisfit,2009-01-06T13:34Z,ust downloaded ''vp7'' codec and still they won't play DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PIECE OF SHIT
,scumbagmisfit,2009-01-06T13:42Z,"ust downloaded ''vp7'' codec and still they won't play DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PIECE OF SHIT


And the codec keggerman recommends actually slows down my computer!

FUCKING CUNT!! I hope you are sodomised by a guy twice your size for the amusement of his friends. fuck you"
,jcthomasva,2009-01-09T00:17Z,"Uses an obscure proprietary codec. I went to encode for playback on a DVD and as yet haven't had any success. I'd stay away from this torrent, despite the higher # of seeders."
,Pujan7,2009-01-23T21:13Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent !
I have already downloaded and watched 7 complete Seasons ripped by Keggerman, and currently I am downloading the 8th Season.
All you have to do is to download VP7 Personal Edition (Free) Codec here: 
http://www.on2.com/index.php?615
And enjoy the good Video and Audio quality.
Many thanks to Keggerman
I am looking forward for next seasons."
,MeTylerdurden,2009-04-11T19:36Z,SHOVE THAT CODEC UP YOUR HAIRY ASS YOU IDIOT   
,MeTylerdurden,2009-04-11T19:38Z,KEGGERMAN SHOULD BE SHITLISTED AND BOOTED AND ALL HIS DOWNLOADS SHITCANNED
,mrbman,2009-09-17T07:33Z,"You know, considering you're getting this stuff for free, I don't think you should be bitching about it ""not working"" to the seeder who uploaded it FOR YOU. I don't particularly love using VP7, but it just means I have to work around it to get it to work for me. That part is YOUR part to find out. NOT THE SEEDER'S. Just say thank you, and start coming up with a solution for YOU ONLY. 

THANKS!"
,abortionist,2010-04-28T15:31Z,"if you don't like the codec or anything, leave it and stop your ridicule complaining as nobody asks you to download this.
of course, you won't be able to watch it on a dvd player but there is a way to change it. i simply converted the episodes to the first popular format with 'format factory' and the problem was over.

anyway, thank you so much KEGGERMAN. your torrents are just great"
,jebemmajkuti,2010-05-21T11:56Z,how can you convert it with FormatFactory.I can only convert 2 to play on dvd player for the rest it says error 0x0000001
,kevrain,2010-07-20T05:59Z,"I dont know what all the garbage is about codecs. Links send you to a dead end. As I am only interested in burning downloads to disc to view on tv, all I needed to do was to burn episodes to DVD using ConvertXtoDVD4 and finished product has picture and sound, perfectly in sync, and very good quality. Thanks KEGGERMAN, but alot of shit could have been evaded if you didnt make the useless VP7 codec a necessity "
,SEMTEXBHOY,2010-10-02T11:46Z,don't download this. there probably is some way to get it working but there are other easier options out there.
,xployt,2010-10-03T02:34Z,"KEGGERMAN, I love you for all the work you put in to push out these Simpsons seasons. Top notch, no question.
That being said, VP7 is ruining my day. VLC is my player of choice and to date no viable codec exists to play these episodes. 
To those still concerned all on2.com links are dead at the time of writing this.

I suggest 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4621607/The_Simpsons_Season_5_-_ALL_EPISODES____DVDrip
as an alternative to season 5 of The Simpsons. Please note: I have not yet completed downloading this torrent so I cannot attest to the quality of the product.
Good luck pirates."
,Haunted360,2011-01-30T04:12Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. As everyone has stated, it is encrypted with a special codec. I got that codec and I had to then convert an episode (which took 3 hours) to .AVI with a MPEG codec. Now it worked, but it went from DVD quality to something like a blurred VHS tape recording. You have been warned... KEGGERMAN REMOVE THIS SHIT!"
,Shuffle_,2011-04-06T22:34Z,"Thank you friend! And don't worry with the people said. People please use goomplayer! And don't forget that Keggerman put this torrent for you for free! If you don't like the codec buy the original dvd and help the producers! Thank you from Brazil man, a place where everything is too much expensive."
