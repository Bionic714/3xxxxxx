The best awarding-winning solution, designed for AMD processor identification. This software recognizes more than 50 various models of the AMD processors and includes over 400 OPN numbers. It reports all the technical information and technical features you need on your processor, such as processor core name, core revision, nominal processor frequency, date of announce, OPN number, etc. Besides, it estimates the QuantiSpeed Rating for processors having a Model Number. Advanced recognition methods can accurately determine mobile, desktop and server parts of AMD processors. Powerful diagnostic capabilities provide the most complete information on processor's cache memory. Central Brain Identifier is aggressively aimed to compete with well-known processor diagnostic tools.
