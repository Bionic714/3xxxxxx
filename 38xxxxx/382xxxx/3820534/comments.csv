,thingnus,2008-01-29T18:38Z,"I do not have a lot of upload bandwidth, but what little I do have has been divided amongst a lot of other torrents....but still, I've been seeding for 4 complete months now.

The sad thing is that I've never seen more than 10 seeds for this torrent. I understand that this sort of software is not required by anyone, but still, not even 10 seeds???

I'm not going to stop seeding though, I'll continue seeding yet. I was just having some problems so and wanted to check back on any comments.

All I ask is that you seed at least 1:1, if not more, because this software is hard to come by. If ever there are no seeds at all for a long time, ask me for a re-seed at : samm_43 (at) hot mail "

,antonio_33,2008-12-08T12:38Z,"Hey come on! Don't lose heart man! Don't seed so much when you don't have that much bandwidth... you seem to be spending a lot of time and bw on this... I'm planning to (iA) upload it to some reliable server... and submit the link here so that people can download if this torrent dies... be happy ;)
by the way, we call that sort of a server a webseed .. so no breaking rules ;)"

,belask,2010-08-20T19:18Z,"Thanks man. let me download it, then i will post my comments about the program. I have windows 7. Let's see it works on it."
,belask,2010-08-20T20:09Z,"haan bhai chal gaya hai ""windows 7"" pe. Compatibility mode k bina hi.
main seed kar dun ga. magar ab inpage bohat out-dated cheez ho gayi hai. in is se kahin zyada khubsoorat writing ms-word pe bhi ho jati hai. vo bhi unicode mein. Inpage to unicode bhi nahi.
Mujhe sirf is liye inpage ki zaroorat pari kyun k kuch old inp files pari hui theen. un ko view karna tha. aur jitni inp files hon gi sab unicode mein convert kar lun ga to phir kabhi inpage ki zaroorat nahi paray gi."
,belask,2010-12-22T15:39Z,This software worked perfectly on Windows 7
