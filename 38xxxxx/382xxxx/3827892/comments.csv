as a fan i can't find exactly which anthology is this one. there's nothing similar listed as ""anthology"" in hooker's entry in wikipedia nor allmusic.com. this seems to be ""the gold collection"" (2CD) + something you have named anthology CD3. what's anthology CD3? where from? could you provide a link?

thanks again. great torrent. hooker is da man.
