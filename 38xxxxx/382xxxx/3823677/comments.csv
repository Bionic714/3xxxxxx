,cockfuckbutt,2008-11-22T15:12Z,"Hey guys I'll reseed it if it means that much to you.

Don't listen to that asshole who posted his 192 shit, it's low ass quality. Mine is EPIC

I'll post more with VSnare's alias Last Step"
,cockfuckbutt,2008-11-22T15:12Z,"Just reply if you want me to up a new torrent of this, I'll nuke this one if so"
,Ion Divvy,2008-12-09T23:19Z,"I am sure cockfuckbutt hasn't downloaded my torrent to back up his claim that my 192Kbps shit is 'low ass quality'. Its obvious he didn't rip any of the mp3s, its just a collection of downloads from limewire or programs alike. I ripped every single album/EP/vinyl using Exact Audio Copy V0.99 (Soundforge 9c for the vinyls) with the exception of a few unreleased tracks and remixes in the miscellaneous folder. All mp3s are ID3 Tagged correctly."
,Ion Divvy,2008-12-09T23:20Z,"How can your torrent be ""EPIC"" in comparison to mine? Same 192 bitrate or VBR but not encoded as well, some are lower in bitrate, its incomplete...

192Kbps is the most widely accepted bitrate in the p2p community providing it is encoded using LAME 3.97 and not crap like FHG etc.

My torrent is COMPLETE (to date)."
