,Ash_Katchem,2008-01-06T12:23Z,"I've just tried Nero Ultra 8 because I wanted to copy an animĂŠ DVD to my PSP but Nero will NOT support subtitles! Someone recommended Movie Factory so I'm going to give this one a go.

I'm glad I didn't buy Nero 8, it might be a good program but it's virtually useless for what I want.
If Movie Factory does the job I might do the honest thing and buy a genuine copy when the next edition comes out."
,Ash_Katchem,2008-01-11T23:37Z,"Trojan found.
Win32: Agent - PBF

Is this program safe to use? I know some cracks cause a false trojan alert."
,jeepmansro,2008-01-17T03:25Z,"well if your using AVG anti-virus, yes it ""finds"" a false virus, It always does with keygens, which this one has one of. but I use it, and its fine obviously, but i know you cant trust the word of ""someone on the internet"" but, I hope you see im not a spammer or someone evil. Hope it works out for ya!"
,screennaame,2008-01-28T17:34Z,"when a burn a dvd i lose all the sound.

anyone know what im doing wrong?"
,Infinitex2,2008-02-27T06:26Z,How do I upload video from my Camcorder?  I have a Sony handycam DCR-TRV460 and i want to get some analog tapes into digital....but also digital tapes onto my HDD.  I can't find a way for anything to recognize this camera!  I am using a firewire IEEE 1394... nothing even recognizes it!
,jeepmansro,2008-03-13T01:36Z,"TO --- screennaame --- make sure the video with sound plays on your computer, and make you have the latest codecs installed.

TO --- Infinitex2 --- I dont have a camcorder so I never used that feature but, Im sure you have to have some sort of drivers from the camcorder installed, for the computer to recognize it are you using XP? when you plug in the camcorder does the little ""Found New Hardware"" bubble come up? Try and go to their website and find software drivers for your model camcorder if you don't have the original CD 

GOOD LUCK"
,ibleus,2008-04-01T15:04Z,please seed
,electrogoodie,2008-04-04T08:55Z,"TO: Infinitex2
Try buying a cheap TV Tuner card or a USB/Firewire TV Tuner so that you can transfer your tapes to your PC by plugging your cam's A/V Out and convert them to any format if you have lost your camcorder driver CD."
,1031982,2008-04-11T10:42Z,Thanks for the upload.
,spooks916,2008-04-29T20:26Z,Cheers 4 the upload. Can someone please tell me how to get this program up and running though. Iv'e read the instructions but still no joy. How do i mount the ISO and in which folder is the ISO as i can't actually find it ?  Iv'e clicked on Auto run exe which starts the install process but half way through i get a message 'FATAL ERROR' and the installation stops and closes the program.
,incka,2008-06-13T20:29Z,"I get the same stupid fatal error message. And then when I try again I get the message that the same version is already detected as installed and I have to remove before trying again, although remove sw nor CCleaner can find any installed version. Why does this happen? Same install works on another PC..."
,incka,2008-06-13T20:44Z,"got it fixed with hotfix1 on this link:

,rob29evansville,2008-08-05T02:19Z,"Am downloading now, My nero 8 ultra stopped authoring DVDS. Hope this one works. Will hit you back with results."
,patrick9,2009-01-22T18:00Z,"beware of trojan, NOT a false positive!!"
,joecp1963,2009-08-29T09:25Z,"Patrick 9- I suggest you run as far away from your computer as you can get- NOT Kidding! And then stay there! Someone will be by to pick up you bio-hazardous PC!  Hurry! Go! Now! 

Ok... For everyone else... For all of those of you who take heed at the ravings of lunatic AVG warnings... The nature of keygens make them appear to be evil- malignant PC eaters by AV Apps. The folks writing these apps are finally wising up with their tactics and looking at the inherant exploits and generalities of malware- and designing their engines accordingly. In doing this- it makes some BENIGN code appear as malware from what it is designed to do. Ergo- the AV scanners are doing what they should- and are intended to do... Plus- Plus scaring the crap out of some users who think that the dark lord's reign upon the earth is imminent because of the dreaded red box that pops up on your screen and tells you that YOU ARE INFECTED!!! When in all actuality- most are infected... with idiocy.  I really hope this explains these warnings to the 1.37 readers who will read this...

,akhnaten,2011-06-07T21:02Z,"Installed but received ""catastrophic error"" when it tried to unpack files.  Installed hotfix and patches from here: http://www.ulead.com/tech/dmf/dmf_ftp.htm
and no go.  I have Windows 7, 64 bit with 6 gig of memory and 1 tera of hd space.  Any ideas to get this running? It got up to 98% when burning a 4.5gb dvd and then crashed with the same error."
,akhnaten,2011-06-07T21:10Z,"and yes, I right-clicked and ran it as admin as well as changed the compatibility to WindowsXP SP2"
