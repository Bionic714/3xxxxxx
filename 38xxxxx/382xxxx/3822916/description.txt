162 rap songs that I feel are great and are the essence of what rap should be. Not like it is now. I know there are plenty more that I have not included, but this was just a quick look through my hard drive. Take in mind that I have been downloading them since 1997, so not everyone one of them is perfect bit rate or perfect file names. Enjoy!
