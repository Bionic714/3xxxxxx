,satmancan,2007-09-29T09:54Z,"hi , this is a stupid question but i am stupid so i have to ask,is this a version of mac os 10 that can run on a pc? I started on pc's on a tandy trs-80 when i was a kid and been doin windows from 3.1 to vista but i have never tried mac, though i have always heard it was better, more stable, does'nt slow down and you do'nt have to reinstall as often...thanks"
,patraulea777,2007-09-29T12:29Z,"satmancan, 
this is the last version of OSX86 - that means is the hacked (Hacintosh) version for Intel/AMD platforms (usual pc's), not PPC or IntelMac's. 

The only problem is that there is nobody seeding ... how can we supposed to get it :)? 

Cheers."
,zarac,2007-09-29T16:42Z,"ok, apart from the fact that noone is seeding, i don't seem to understand whether this is complete patched iso or just a ppf for the mentioned iso.

the torrent title implies it's a prepatched iso, but the author's comment says:
""This PPF has to be applied to the original XxX_OS_x86_10.4.10_Install_Disk.iso
posted on Friday, Sep 14, 2007.""

confused"
,pbbsw,2007-09-29T17:51Z,It already patched.
,niken,2007-09-29T17:57Z,The only problem is that there is nobody seeding
,Lokedemon,2007-09-30T09:04Z,Plz seed!!!
,oinck,2007-10-03T10:06Z,"Pls seed! 45,7% isn't enough ;)"
,marianmi,2007-10-04T05:29Z,"Is this for SSE2 also, or SS3 only ?
Thanks "
,pbbsw,2007-10-04T10:57Z,"SSE2 and SSE3 can be used.



"
,marianmi,2007-10-04T15:22Z,Now it's just a matter of seeding :D
,Edis0n,2007-10-07T13:50Z,"Well, i'm downloading this for a week now, and it's stuck at 81,9%. Switched to another torrent, came down in less than an hour..."
,BugsABunny,2007-10-08T17:26Z,well Edis0n then give us a URL .. ;)
,pbbsw,2007-10-09T08:31Z,it's maintainance time.  SAT 08.00 pm - SUN 08.00 pm (GMT +7)
,BugsABunny,2007-10-09T13:45Z,".. seeding from the University of Bangkok, Thailand, steady IP 58.64.103.32 .. I like that :D !"
,peertje888,2007-10-12T22:50Z,Hmm...tried it on my Athlon64...got erros after errlogger was starded...could this be because this version is only for intel CPU's?
,peertje888,2007-10-12T23:15Z,"Make that: error reporter.

At my fancy averatec av1050 with an Intel Celeron Mobile of nothing more than 1.1GHz the iso DOES boot! Jippiej :D tnx!"
,labanane,2007-10-13T18:57Z,"so do you put this in the same iso file with the real mac osx iso file and then burn it on dvd or how it suppose to work?

g:me stupido"
,varg-larsen,2007-10-14T17:43Z,"I have high hopes for this one.. 
Q: Why is tpb claiming this torrent has 1 seeder and 1 leecher? My utorrent says 48/35.."
,mcorry1,2007-10-27T17:51Z,"I downloaded this but theres just 200 RAR files !, i cant actually make an image of it, help please "
,lilogoestombr,2007-10-27T21:00Z,"@mcorry1: You have to choose one of the .rar packets (for example the 200) and just extract the .iso and readme file to somewhere...

My problem: It doesn't work on a AMD XP 3000+ Machine with Radeon 9600XT: I guess this just works on 64bit CPUs, am I right concerning this point?

Thanks for any comment!"
,mcorry1,2007-10-28T12:34Z,"OK, but i deleted it, ill just download it again, Thanks"
,mcorry1,2007-10-28T12:37Z,"RE: lilogoestombr,I have a amd athlon 64 4200+ x2 hopefully it works on that, but i was using a laptop there with an amd xp 2200+, but it was very slow, so that maybe the problem, but i think most amd's are 64-bit. 

Good luck!"
,mcorry1,2007-10-28T21:14Z,"I tried to install this into 3 virtual machines, Parralels workstation, virtual box and microsoft virtual machine. But none of them work, help please!"
,mcorry1,2007-10-28T23:27Z,"it's ok ill just download another version.

Thanks anyway!"
,sterbik,2007-11-03T10:43Z,can this be installed on an sse1 amd processor?
,RobNyc,2007-11-03T20:35Z,GO FOR IT GUYS!!
,ecch,2008-03-30T19:43Z,"This is for AMD processors, because above talk ""useless AMD Binaries"", i'm not understand. or is intel version only.  Please answer me.
