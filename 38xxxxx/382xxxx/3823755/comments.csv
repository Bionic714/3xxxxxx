,demonfire321,2007-09-29T16:51Z,"HAHAHA, I thought the other one was a virus and almost reported it.
Very nice, thanks for this."
,michitakem,2007-09-29T22:51Z,"Ha, well I saw no easy way to delete it unfortunately, but that one's just what happened when I targeted the torrent file as the actual data file (since it looked like a zip file in windows because of the name/extension). :)

Glad you like this one, though.

BTW, this is another torrent of mine that might go well in the background with some of the games that lack music:

,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2007-09-30T08:47Z,"These are not Laptop Games, these are ZX Spectrum remakes as I see.
Well not all and not all ZX Spectrum.
But it is fun."
,theelderscrolls,2007-09-30T19:36Z,"plz people, say how to SEED!!

Cause i dont know"
,michitakem,2007-09-30T22:24Z,"theelderscrolls, to seed you just keep uploading after you're at 100% instead of stopping your torrent.  Nothing to it."
,michitakem,2007-09-30T22:29Z,"DeepSpaceFreelancer, there are indeed a lot of remakes, but many are actually arcade or Commodore64.

Also there are a few others like Blades of Avernum and Crypts of Despair that are 100% originals."
,Atarian,2007-10-01T10:51Z,WhatÂ´s a Laptop game?
,michitakem,2007-10-02T03:12Z,"""These games were chosen because they have a small footprint (won't hog disk space) and run well even on less powerful laptops (and Desktop PC's, of course) running recent versions of Windows."""
,NightOwl40,2008-05-20T22:37Z,"I downloaded this and when I unzipped the files, the anti-virus security programs on my laptop will not let me open the Lode Runner file.........it has an adware program embedded in it ""adware not-a-virus:AdWare.Win32.EShopper.i"" What the frak is it and will it compromise my system security???????"
,Grothraw,2009-04-06T23:55Z,"Great collection,any chance of a reseed? I might be uploading something similar soon,will leave a link when I'm done."
,sheister01,2009-08-15T13:26Z,please seed... this is taking a lifetime.......
