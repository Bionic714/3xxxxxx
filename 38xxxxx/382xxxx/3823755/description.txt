(Correct version)

* Due to the popularity of the last Laptop Game torrent (see my username), I've packaged another one of 20 different games (this one is better tested).

This is a pack of 20 MORE great, free and "legal" (not cracked or pirated) Games collected from around the web, including a couple of long-play Demos with a shareware aspect.  Credit, web links, instructions and documentation were added where applicable. 

Genres include: Action, RPG, Puzzle, Arcade, Text, Shooting & Adventure

These games were chosen because they have a small footprint (won't hog disk space) and run well even on less powerful laptops (and Desktop PC's, of course) running recent versions of Windows.  No additional emulators or old DosBox type stuff is required to run.  Games were run and tested in Windows XP.

Some of the games are good for a quick diversion, while others are deep and/or addictive types.

If you're looking for a nice set of games to kill time on your laptop, some of which can be run in windowed mode, then grab this torrent!

The Games this time 'round include:

Castlevania - The New Generation
Saboteur
Final Fantasy - Dark Cloud
Runesword
Montezuma's Revenge Remake
Demon Attack Remake
Cute Knight
Riseout

And more!
