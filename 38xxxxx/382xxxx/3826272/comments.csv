,Hutlernn,2011-03-16T23:30Z,"@ Prodigy88 Update your DirectX files. You will need the web based installer.

@ valca92 There isn't anything you can do to fix that issue. Considering how badly made this game is, and that there were no bugfixes made for it, this is only to be expected on today's computers."
