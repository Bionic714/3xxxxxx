                          Title: Pilot
                       


An unlikely and heroic team of Marlin Boulet, a brash, wry, in-your-face NOPD veteran, and Trevor Cobb, the redemptive tough and committed cop harboring a dark secret, is born. Battling an upsurge of violence, understaffing of police forces and a lack of crime labs and other facilities, the cops who remain in the New Orleans Police Department have courage to burn and a passion to reclaim and rebuild their city. Rounding out the crew are wisecracking Jeff "Glue Boy" Gooden, the team's comic relief; tough-as-nails Ginger "Love Tap" LeBeau, the only female on the squad; and Captain James Embry, who wrangles the eclectic personalities of his squad with equal parts humor and tenacity. Through its no-holds-barred crime stories and dramatic personal stories, this intriguing story takes viewers from the Victorian mansions of the Garden District to the rubble of the Lower 9th Ward.
