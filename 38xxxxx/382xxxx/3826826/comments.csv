,schlottj,2007-10-02T14:10Z,"hi, i uploaded this, its very much real, the quality is decent, very much watchable, i made it smaller for those that dont care much about quality, since the only ones i ever see available to dl are always large in size"
,computermech,2007-10-02T19:08Z,I downloaded and watched it. Thanks for uploading it. Unfortunately it cuts off just before the end. Also the quality is not as good as the others. I am now going to download the file again from someone else.
,hell_pl,2007-10-02T19:48Z,i give u advice for the future schlottj. When u change size of the file( which=worse quality) put this in description or comment. It will be easier for every1
