Depending on the BitTorrent Client software that you are using, you may need to configure your seeding ratio.

For example, if you are using Transmission for OSX, then under 'preferences/transfers/management' you have the option to change the seed ratio.

Or under the 'view' menu, if you go to 'show inspector' - then 'options tab' - you have to option here to ''seed forever''

If you are using Azarus, BitTorrent or something similar, then you should be able to find a similar configuration option.

Hope this info. helps"

Your own torrent file (the one you uploaded to TPB) won't work.  Download the modified file from here, double-click it and point your client to the original files you want to share."

,fluidrock78,2008-05-20T07:25Z,if you are using an older version of bitorrent just leave it in the window...newer versions give you the option....should be able to convert to a torrent file w/ your program.
