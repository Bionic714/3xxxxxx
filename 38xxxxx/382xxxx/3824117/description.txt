There once was a time in the history of rock 'n' roll when being in a band wasn't about which member was in rehab, or lost in the desert because of some bad 'shrooms. There was just the music, and that music could speak louder than any endorsements or MTV reality shows. Groups like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Kinks started a revolution of electrified, snarling rock that would inspire for decades.

Unfortunately, this music was also left up high on a shelf for decades. Until one day, a quartet from rural Denmark dusted off those riffs and brought forth a refreshing brand of pure, unadulterated bluesy rock unheard for too long.
Vocalist/guitarist Steffen Westmark, organist (yes, ORGANIST) Soren Christensen, bassist Allen Villadsen, and drummer Per Jorgenson have revived the chords of a gritty rock attitude, to show people that it was never supposed to be about the drugs and money, but about the power-jam and all-out blues wail that gave shivers. In Denmark, the "blue van" comes to take people to the loony bin - while you're there, take a shot of Blue Van rock 'n' roll.
