,Ssschhhh,2007-09-30T10:06Z,Max Headroom rocks - and I think these DAP rips are the best you're ever going to get.. Will they ever get released on DVD?
,OldMosher,2007-10-08T10:54Z,"M m m m m m Max Headroom. Holy shit !

Wonderful. I still got some episodes on . . . . wait for it . . . Betamax tape but no way to watch them. Great post thanks a lot"
,joolzg,2007-10-10T00:40Z,seed please!
,CheersMate,2008-01-07T15:55Z,Will seed at least 100%.Saw this on tv years ago - loved it!
,erpobdella,2008-01-13T19:39Z,"10,368,000 minutes into the past..
How time goes by, this is 20 years old now.
I never did see all of this back in the day, I was too busy partying. Remember when Gen-X meant 20 something? Looking more and more like 40 something now, lol.
I'm looking forward to seeing it all now, thanks babspace."
,zagrodzkyz,2008-07-03T21:29Z,This is AWESOME! The quality is way better than my old VHS tapes and NO COMMERCIALS!!! It is not quite DVD quality but it is fantastic quality files considering the source.
,babspace,2008-07-21T06:01Z,"Thanks!

I'd love to take credit for their quality but I had nothing to do with that. I snagged them from a fan via WinMX some years ago, and since they're still hard to find I figured I'd share my good fortune. Enjoy!"
,Chase357,2008-10-03T14:31Z,"""...plus the original British special..."" 
Do you mean the movie ""Max Headroom: 20 Minutes in the Future""?
This torrent and your season 2 are amazing.
Thanks, babspace! I'm also seeding this forever :)"
,babspace,2008-12-02T14:05Z,"@ Chase357 True fans know that it was the original 
British movie, but to those who only caught the US series, it's a special. :P"
,Chase357,2009-02-07T03:08Z,"Yeah, I can't believe I wrote that.
Americans get shafted out of quality when things are originally released in another country.
Thanks, I enjoy it and I'm still seeding!"
,sumdumnam,2009-08-20T13:08Z,this is much appreciated.  thanks!!
,bfg666,2010-03-09T02:21Z,"Thanx a whole bleeping lot for this ! I watched it on french TV back then (circa '86-87, I believe), and I loved it. I guess part of the interest was my love for The Art Of Noise and their groundbreaking ""ParanoĂŻmia"" video (one of their best tracks ever. Can't top Instruments of Darkness though). I remember how disappointed I was when I figured out the series had actually nothing to do with AON but still, what a great show... Never had the chance to see it again though, but the memories are still vivid. I was wondering if I'd be able to find it on the net, and voilĂ  ! YOU ROCK, BABS !!!"
,cptDefunk,2010-03-14T00:12Z,"WOW...When I typed the name in the search box I did not think I would get any results. This is awesome! Thanks. 

I remeber watching this back in the and loving every second of it. A funny little knock off of this was in Back To the Future 2 when Marty was in the 80's cafe. The Headroom was Michael Jackson and Gorbachov? I think."
,kabalizo,2010-03-25T08:55Z,Thanks.
,maksimusi007,2010-06-10T17:19Z,Thanks so much
,beinuppity,2010-06-25T19:25Z,"Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!! Long live MAX!
Will reseed to 2+"
,ViewManzanar,2010-08-11T01:17Z,"DVD is out, this is not it."
,Knoland,2010-08-19T20:28Z,"I can't play these on mac, im using VLC, I get sound, but no video! Any help?"
,pimpampet123,2010-09-18T13:00Z,Excellent upload! I bought the recently released Shout Factory DVD set but it doesn't include the original British TV movie for some reason (I guess they couldn't get the rights to it or something).
,mingeng,2011-02-12T05:18Z,a box set was recently released
,dude8888,2011-03-02T00:40Z,"A=5, V=5, M=6

thanks for the memories..."
