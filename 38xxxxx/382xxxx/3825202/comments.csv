,dubbeldekkert,2008-05-20T19:43Z,To everybody who doesn't understand this Polish or something (me neither). Just patch the game to the newest version and everything will be in english. You do have to install it through the polish installer but if you are a bit experienced in installing games you know wich buttons to click.
,raf696,2008-06-02T20:15Z,"Well I doubt that you will still need that translation after all this time but just in case... for others...
1.Unpack ETM_PLAY.7zip 
2,Burn or mount the image
3. install game
4. Unpack Matrix archive
5.Copy Matrix file (about6mb)into the directory program files/atari/enter the matrix

,zxD347Hxz,2008-11-25T21:24Z,"This game has always been buggy with freezes, i used to have this game a long time ago when I bought it and it froze at that point as well. However,this torrent is not cutting it for me. Downloading at 6.4kb is too slow, so good luck to the rest of you. if it decides to pick up in speed within the next hour, i'll keep it going to help seed, but by the looks of it, I'll be canceling it."
,zxD347Hxz,2008-11-25T21:42Z,"If you're still experiencing problems, try going here: http://www.atari.com/us/support/newfaq/enterthematrix.php and make sure you meet the system requirements. It's best to play this game with a video card installed. Normal, the error with entering full screen is due to lack of updated drivers or lack of hardware specs."
,apellsin,2008-12-14T21:15Z,it has shitty graphics but its a nice game anyway
