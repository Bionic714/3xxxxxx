,pixelgazer,2008-05-03T13:46Z,"I found this through usenet and tracked it back to here. I regonized about 30% of the songs, some of which I hadn't heard since my teen years.

I'm so impressed that I've also started to get the other volumes.

Thank you so very much."

,Griezel,2008-10-15T05:08Z,"I've just downloaded ""Mouth of an Angel"" of a band called ""Two People"", and this is pretty good. Never heard the song before or even knew the band itself.

Usually i listen to old school metal but there is something about 80z popmusic wich i just really like, shame on me ;). I think i'll just download all of it...hihi.

Thanx man!"
