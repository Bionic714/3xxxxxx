,wjraider,2007-10-02T17:20Z,Hows the quality? Are they like DVD Iso's or something?
,hammockmk,2007-10-19T06:34Z,someone seed plz?  can only get .871 thanks
,hammockmk,2007-10-19T19:10Z,"I just didn't see you I guess.  It's a huge file I was just worried I'd get stuck at 90% or something.  

Great upload, I'll seed too when I'm done.  "
,ArdenD,2007-10-21T11:21Z,"Right now the tracker goes down often... I wonder if it's an issue with tpb? In any case, I still see less than 100% available for download, with pieces missing in all episodes spanning from seasons 2-5... I'd like to start downloading complete episodes from Season 2... is there anyone out there with full copies?"
,ArdenD,2007-10-29T09:10Z,"Yes, I noticed. I will seed what I have (which are the soundtracks and Seasons 1-4)"
,hammockmk,2007-10-29T16:32Z,"I'm seeding the movies, season 1-5 and the crusade.  "
,Falante,2007-11-08T14:57Z,"I know I should've propably started to download a piece or a season at a time or something but I want them all... But the connection is soo slow - so please, keep seeding so it would speed up. At the moment I'm downloading at 3-6 k/s (7% complete).
So specially people on this (european) side of the atlantic, thanks for your efforts."
,YankeeStrudel,2007-12-04T04:41Z,(0) zero seeders..........on.........Is this torrent dead?
,Beergoggles,2007-12-29T06:13Z,All movies and seasons work great on the computer.  Movies converted with winavi work fine in dvd player but the seasons wont play in a dvd player.  Any help with that?
,Falante,2008-01-08T15:54Z,"I know there's a lot of it, but please keep seeding. At the moment I've been downloading since 25.10.07 and at the moment there are only 3 connections and none of them have the whole thing."
,hoverFrog,2008-02-02T12:27Z,I'm at about 40% and definitely want to keep this thread going.  I'll seed as much as I can for the next year or so but I don't think I'll have all the files till April 2008 at this rate.
,Jdsnut,2008-02-07T02:01Z,"I bought all the episode and movie but moving  I lost the box that they were in when i moved so.
This will not convert using convertxtodvd so someone help me i want to put these on dvd like i used to have."
,emohawk96,2008-03-04T01:01Z,"Why don't turn off deinterlacing ? The whole release qualify from rerip  !!!  Codec h.264 best choise. Audio maybe ac3  better choise, but ogg  maybe ok, too,  Less frames , for example 23.976 , maybe better bitrate and the end quality will be much better. If you still have the access to source Babylon 5 ISO DVD and time, you should rerip  and encode this again. :)
sorry for my english :)"
,MisterSlimm,2008-03-11T18:49Z,what platform are you supposed to use to view these torrents? i can't get any playback. thanks
,analjuggern4ut,2008-03-31T11:17Z,"@ nijet99:

""Although there is one little issue. I got the first PAL DVDs released here and in one episode there are some scenes with distorted aspect ratio...""

Could you tell me which episode was that? I have the Complete Universe boxset and if it has correct aspect ratio on those scenes, I could re-rip.

Could you also tell which program and settings did you use in ripping the DVDs? I managed to scratch one of my DVDs, loaded your rip as a replacement and found out that the quality of your rips is excellent but the filesize is still small."
,LoveLord,2008-04-12T21:04Z,"If some one already had this downloaded, could they post season 3?  The rest as well separately?  Im limited on dick space and have to burn them shortly after downloading them."
,LoveLord,2008-04-13T14:35Z,"I have been trying to download season 3 listed here, but the torrent never starts.  Can you suggest a Mac torrent program that can do what you suggest?"
,davout,2008-04-19T13:37Z,"@lovelord: you poor man, to be limited on dick space, what a horror!! 

;)"
,BarnyG999,2008-04-25T03:19Z,"LoveLord, I use Transmission under OS-X Leopard and I MUCH prefer it over Azureus...and it does allow you to only download parts of a torrent. You could download season-1, burn it, change the flags, download season-2, etc. Good Luck!"
,LoveLord,2008-04-28T16:25Z,"Opps i didn't notice the typo there lol, but anyone know of a good mac solution to play these .mkv files?  VLC can't seem to address it."
,Quantum,2008-07-04T11:21Z,"Great torrent, when it comes to the five seasons of babylon and the crusade stuff. But! Whats up whith the stoopid ass matroska file format on the movies? .mkv files. Been trying some stuff to get to the contents of the mkv container, but had to give up in the end. Allthough they play fine on VLC I'd like to convert them to divX so I can play them on my dvd player. Why on earth would you or anybody else for that matter use this format??

thanks very much for the upp though, as I said, the five seasons of B5 and the crusade stuff was asome.

thanks dude!"
,corsair54,2008-10-17T06:08Z,"I'm hoping someone here who knows more about bitstream than me can help me out. I don't know much about it, which has stopped me in the past from creating my own torrents. I try to make up for this by always seeding anything I acquire at least 5 times before removing it from my incoming file space, and usually leave everything up until I have to make space. This brings me to my problem.

I need to take the machine that has been my torrent server for the past year offline. I have been seeding the B5 torrent since Jan-Feb and don't want to stop (there are still only 16-18 of us and its a GREAT show). But, when I put my new server online, I don't know how to rejoin the torrent. I'm currently using Vuze (Azureus) 3.1.1.0, But the new host will likely get 4.0.

Can someone help?

BTW, thank you nijet99, for a great job! I had the series on tape, from when it originally aired, but your files are so much better and more convenient! Thanks for carrying a great show to folks who might never have seen it otherwise."
,hoku123456,2008-10-29T00:30Z,I yest wanted to say good job nijet99. This is the best quality 350 MB rips i have ever seen. I have seen season 1-5 and not had any problems with any of the files. Exept sometimes the pictures looks fuzzy for a short while. It dose look like it is the camera used and not the encoding. Since it is only seen from one angle and when that changes the picture is good again. All in all great job. 
,DeReX2,2008-10-30T23:20Z,I would love to seed when i get this but how i seed? Oo never got the idea of that ... lol
,DeReX2,2008-10-31T13:06Z,This is the first time i watch this series after the demiss of my loved television series Stargate sg-1...
,blondejon,2009-01-22T00:59Z,"did you know youve actually put ""Legend of the Ragners"".....check the torrent,. made me smile "
,pio333,2009-02-27T06:57Z,"Cheers to you brother nijet99 this is one of the best scifi series out there, not because of any effects its because of the story. J Michael Straczynski you ROCK....."
,weidox,2009-03-11T10:09Z,"Pretty sad that this one rip is only 2 channel audio and interlaced format. While it is possible to deinterlace on the fly, audio won't fix.."
,azel45,2009-04-14T03:26Z,"Thank you so much for putting this in one torrent. 


Seeding Seeding Seeding. 

Unfortunately, there are so few seeders its hard for me to download much. :( :( :("
,truthy,2009-04-29T01:20Z,"1st of all thx nijet99 for this very nice effort, gonna start downloading now - I guess for about 1-2 weeks ... but I have one important question:

could you make an estimate about the overall video bitrate (above 1000 kbit I hope) of the episode-rips and is the ogg audio bitrate at least 128 kbit (CBR) or even better VBR.

you can easily check these infos with MediaInfo http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download"
,truthy,2009-05-13T15:18Z,"okay checked it now myself: (on season 1 ... should be the same for the remaining seasons)

video: AVC/x264 VBR 1000 kbit (actual bitrate arround 950 kbit)
audio: OGG Vorbis 160 kbit CBR

whats very nice is the anamorphic resolution --> 720x576 (highest PAL) with a 16/9 DAR

so thx alot again, looks nice on my 32'' lcd - great effort!"
,truthy,2009-05-13T15:19Z,"a few suggestions if you ever want to rip anything in the future again with this pc-only (except tvix) playable container mkv (avc/ogg):

- use a variable audio bitrate (VBR) lame/ogg (saves some space) 
- use a slightly higher than calculated video bitrate to make it fit exactly to 350 mb (instead of 341, 342 etc.)
- use crop to cut off the small black spaces on the side or top & resize to change it back to your orig. resolution (720x576)

of course these suggestions are only meant to help you in the future - not to criticize anything - your rip's almost perfect!

best free software to do it in my opinion - meGUI"
,Thorongil1980,2009-07-28T03:36Z,"Hi! Is the video quality of this torrent better than this one?

,hopegone,2009-08-05T09:29Z,too bad this was posted before the ratings system :(  it would have a TON of points.  
,boogiepimp,2009-12-06T00:31Z,come on guys been downloaden this for nearly a week or so need better than 100kb/s im at 45%
,chains2222,2010-02-19T17:26Z,"Thanks for the torrent, nijet99. I just started downloading, so I don't know how good it is yet. But I like how you've used open source formats for the audio and container.

That said, have you considered stop being such a douche-bag? Every time someone gives you feedback, you take it as a personal offense, and then you respond with the same tired asshole comment. You think you are some kind of a god because you can rip a video and upload a torrent."
,WinterKnight99,2010-02-28T19:39Z,"The video quality of this torrent is poor. I watched the second season from this torrent, and for many of the episodes, whenever the camera pans, it's like the people and objects in the video can't keep up. When the camera is moving, everything is sharp and blocky. It's distracting.

I am downloading subsequent Babylon 5 seasons with another torrent."
,chris1010,2010-08-12T11:52Z,Without a doubt the most absorbing and gripping Sci-Fi Series EVER!!!...Unreached in the complexness of its plot this is a milestone in TV history.
,lokha,2010-09-01T00:01Z,"Hey nijet99,

Thank you so much for such a fantastic upload.  Absolutely brilliant sci fi show ripped absolutely perfectly.

Sharing indeed is caring

Cheers once again :)"
,mordokch,2010-11-11T04:36Z,"Wow -all that effort to rip these wonderful shows, and you use MKV ????????  It's just an awful codec that should be shot on sight lol.
Great effort and I thank you for that, but I'm gonna have to pass on the mkv as it's just a waste of space."
,SimStim,2010-11-23T11:01Z,"My favourite sci-fi series, apart from STTOS. Thank you for this amazing collection!"
,luckyman75,2010-12-02T02:11Z,download file corrupt???
[V],nijet99,2010-12-10T08:19Z,"mordoch:

FYI - mkv is not a codec"
,anom__2,2011-09-02T18:07Z,thank you for posting this!  and for the 1 really fast seeder out there! :)
