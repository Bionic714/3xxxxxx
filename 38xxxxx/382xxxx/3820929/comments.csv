Cheers"
,pixelgazer,2008-05-03T14:14Z,"Fantastic! I love this stuff. I know a measly 8 out of the 21 tracks. I also like that it contains songs from 5 Canadian bands of which 3 are from my home town of Toronto.

I had forgotten how much FM had changed since releasing their first album featuring 'Phasors On Stun'. They went from progressive rock to synthpop in a very short time it would seem.

I can't wait to listen to the other volumes.

Thanks!"
