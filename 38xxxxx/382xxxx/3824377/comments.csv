,Roadkill01,2009-01-15T00:06Z,ghostlycat - do you know where I could download EQ Emu from? I have to keep my main game up to the latest patch. And copying the files and waiting for the EQ Emu team to catch up would suck...
,dulak,2009-01-26T06:18Z,I can't believe people are seeding such an ancient compile that doesn't even work anymore...
,ashiar,2009-04-16T23:43Z,Actually dulak it does still work. It depends on what version of EQ your playing.
,Killfly,2009-07-27T09:28Z,"I'll semi-permaseed this if I ever get a copy. I'm stuck at 84%.

Permaseed: when I am online it will be seeding.

I've got a copy that only has the Warp, Maphack, and Track.  I don't know why this is so illegal on EQEmu since the game is so OLD.

By the way, if anyone knows, how are the commands entered to fly, zone, nokos etc with this? A little more NFO please.

Thanks for this - almost, ha...."
