,phanax,2008-03-28T03:51Z,Could someone please seed this? It would be awesome to have it for mac
,phanax,2008-04-04T14:47Z,"Hey people, I tried that tracker above and I got it downloaded and it works fine, it also gives you the crack. "
,phanax,2008-04-05T18:00Z,"Another comment, the above link does indeed work, however, you need to get ahold of the patch 1.0.3D

The game version it comes with is 1.0.3C, you need the D version for it to play better on intel macs. Unless you want it quitting on you every time a major lag happens in the game. The intel processors can't handle it. Not tried the patch myself yet, but I hope it works"
,phanax,2008-04-05T20:44Z,"Okay, that didn't work. 

I'm going to try and download the no_cd thing and possibly create a slightly different way of doing it.

I guess this will work, though I am not sure. If you download from the link above (I will create a torrent for it soon, if I find out how to, and how to get this working well enough.)

1. Install the .dmg file Knights of the Old Republic
2. Toast/Burn the Kotor No_Dvd.toast from the No_Cd! torrent download (I sure hope it works) onto a DVD or CD (it should be a fairly small file so copying it onto a CD should not make it impossible to play)
3. Patch the game with the 1.03D file
4. Hopefully you can now play the game with the patch for intel macs without the game screwing up, and without you needing to crack the game itself.

Keep in mind this is just my theory right now. I might compress all the files you need later with Stuffit Twelve into a .sitx file or .zip file if possible. Hope people appreciate what I'm doing here:P"
,phanax,2008-04-05T21:30Z,Unless of course someone are in posession of a 1.03D crack and could direct me towards it
,VileCore,2008-06-04T17:39Z,"Hey Phanax, looks like you're being ignored :P"
