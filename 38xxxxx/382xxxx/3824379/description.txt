Dual Core will succeed where others have failed after  
all...                                                    
...they now have twice the imagination, two times as          
much talent and twin turbo engines to boot!              
H20 Records are proud to present the explosive new      
debut album by Dual Core. It's called 'Eruption' and      
it's going to blow a hole sky high in the Trance        
music fraternity!                                      
Dual Core is comprised of two nuclear fission            
reactors who go by the name of Adi Milner and Eran          
Ben Gaon. Both artists have had successful solo          
careers, recording and performing around the world as    
Backspace (that's Adi) and Point that's Eran.            
As the saying goes'two heads are better than one' and    
so to record this album they decided to pool their    
talents and become 'as One'...a Dual Coretwice as        
potent!                                                  
What we can say with certainty is that these two        
fellows share the common aim to stimulate the senses,    
to enliven the mind, and to free up the body with        
music that is fiery, hot and explosive on the              
dance-floor.                                            
So remember while it is true to say that some            
volcanoes lie dormant or quietly smoulder for years,      
if, and when they do erupt, you better be ready to          
run for cover!                                          
We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying.
MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands !!
You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout.
Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much!
Our releases are for scene internal use so
KEEP THEM OFF P2P AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES!!
So much for now ...
meet ya @ the next party ... somewhere.
MYCEL - sending lamers to /dev/null since 2003
We bow our heads to our old friends.    
Deep respect to you!              
Also we would like to greet all of the      
still alive quality scenegroups/sceners!    
Ascii done with love to my lil d3vil.
