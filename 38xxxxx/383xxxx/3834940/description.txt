Holiday Lights 5.4 W/ serial
By RW2007

Holiday Lights decorates your computer for the holidays. It shows a string of colorful lights around the edge of your screen and plays background music if you wish. You can choose from more than 40 bulbs suitable for any season, including standard Christmas tree lights, chili peppers, stockings, holly, snowmen, happy faces, Valentine's Day hearts, Thanksgiving turkeys, and Halloween jack-o'-lanterns. You have the option to add more bulbs and music. The colorful lights can flash on your desktop while you work, act as a screensaver, or both.
