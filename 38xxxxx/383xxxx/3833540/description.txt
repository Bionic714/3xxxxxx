This is for all those who love h.264 quality!



Right now you may be asking yourself what the difference between this release and all of the other copies of Return Of The Jedi in HD is. There is one major difference. I have taken the commentary from the DVD by George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher and incorporated it into this copy. Also I added the chapter directory from the DVD. I often backup movies to DVD for archival purposes and I know many other people do as well so I have decided to split this movie into DVD friendly portions. I have incorporated a function called linking which is only available in the .MKV container into these files. So when both parts are played from the same directory they will play as one. If you select the second part to watch the movie will play from the beginning. The time code is also seamless between the two segments. The second part doesn\'t begin at 0 with a new time code. Watching these two parts should be one seamless stream to the observer. This is why I have chosen to make this movie a .MKV instead of .mp4 as I usually do. So with this copy there is no need to have your HD Star Wars movie watching experience interrupted at some arbitrary point because you need to load the second part.



As the Emperor himself oversees the construction of the new Death Star by Lord Darth Vader and the evil Galactic Empire, smuggler Han Solo is rescued from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt by his friends, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Chewbacca. Leaving Skywalker Jedi training with Yoda, Solo returns to the Rebel Fleet to prepare for to complete his battle with the Empire itself. During the ensuing fighting the newly returned Skywalker is captured by Vader. Can the Rebels, and their new found friends, the Ewoks, help restore freedom to the Galaxy?
