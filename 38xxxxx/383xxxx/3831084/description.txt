    |#|  - We shot 60 hours of footage over a 2 year period. |#|
    |#|  Narrowing that down to 1 hour film brought a new    |#|
    |#|  meaning to the word headfuck!                       |#|
    |#|  - Budget ridiculously small (lets not even go there)|#|
    |#|  - Psy's longest stay in the Catacombs was 72 hours  |#|
    |#|  in one shot.                                        |#|
    |#|  - Providential sound design by Simahlak & Scott C.  |#|
    |#|  - Additional Music was graciously provided by:      |#|
    |#|  Sixtoo, Moodswing9, Interceiving and Catacomb's own |#|
    |#|  Mucke.                                              |#|
    |#|  - Interceiving's soundscapes were so perfectly      |#|
    |#|  appropriate for the Catacombs, it's hard to believe |#|
    |#|  they were not composed specifically for the film.   |#|
    |#|  - We only got lost once, for a couple of hours, but |#|
    |#|  we did lose quite a few people down there...        |#|
    |#|  - Psy's patience was great. He took us down at      |#|
    |#|  least 15 times for about 10-12 hours at a time and  |#|
    |#|  answered shit-loads of questions for weeks without  |#|
    |#|  ever getting annoyed.                               |#|
    |#|  - Psy made only one requirement: that the movie     |#|
    |#|  respect a geographical cohesion when showing his    |#|
    |#|  journey through the Catacombs. Being in the editing |#|
    |#|  room was like being back in the labyrinth trying to |#|
    |#|  figure out were the fuck the exit was...            |#|
    |#|  - To this day, Psy is still working on his castle.  |#|
    |#|  - Psy publicly showed his paintings about the       |#|
    |#|  catacombs and shared his part of his life in an     |#|
    |#|  exhibit entitled "AUTOPSY" in fall 2004.            |#|
    |#|  - We had one camera for the whole shoot and by the  |#|
    |#|  end, it was held together with duct tape.           |#|
