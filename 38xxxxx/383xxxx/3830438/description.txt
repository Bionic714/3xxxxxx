Gangway was a Danish 80's band, sometimes classified as indiepop. Their first three albums tend towards Beatle-esque (and sometimes Smiths-esque) guitar pop, but later on, particularly on The Quiet Boy Ate The Whole Cake, their influences from synth-pop music, especially Pet Shop Boys shows through. They are also known for their strange and subtle lyrics that are often on the verge of surrealism. It's almost impossible to find their records in North America. If you're into obscure 80's stuff, don't hesitate to download it!
