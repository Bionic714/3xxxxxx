With a name like TORCH BEARER, I was expecting cheesy Power Metal like HAMMERFALL. Hell No! This is some furious shit. The band comes out swinging right from the get go. The guitars wail and assault the ears with its combination of Thrash and Death Metal. The vokills have a combination of Black Metal and Death Metal. This is uncompromising Death Metal that will take no prisoners.
 
Semi blast beats, cold atmospheric soundscapes and scathing guitar riffs makes Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Sown Are The Seeds Of DeathÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ sound like a Norwegian Black Metal band like KHOLD or OLD MAN\'S CHILD. This is evil, harsh and unrelenting. By the time we hit \"Dead ChildrenÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½, the melodies do tend to rear its head, but they don\'t last because the blasphemous beats, riffs and harsh vokills continue to reign supreme. Jesus Christ, things get out of control on Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Far Advanced Closure.Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ The guitar scaling action on here is insane. You just have to hear it. The complexity, timing and placing of everything makes this a stand out song. The songs are relatively quick, but they do plenty of damage and are more than effective.
 
Although some of the songs may bear resemblance to some of your favourite Norwegian Black Metal artists, TORCH BEARER do have originality and do stand a chance in this scene. (Online September 16, 2004)
