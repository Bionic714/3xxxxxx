,babspace,2007-10-11T05:34Z,"Relax!

My goal is to seed as much as possible during the day and all night from 9pm to 6pm EDT/EST (as needed). I hate inactive torrents as much as the next person, but I hate outrageous electric bills even more!"

i cannot seed properly and often due to technical difficulties, but i will upload this to online streaming servers of veeHD

i have seen many request for the original movie and i believe this great piece of video art must be posted for eternity! besides, this will give me a chance to see the whole set, apart from several episodes i browsed here and there in different timelines;"
,traitale,2011-11-06T22:04Z,Thank you.  I was there.  So happy to find all of Max for posterity.
