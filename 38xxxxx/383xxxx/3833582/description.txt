This is season two of Max Headroom: 20 Minutes Into the Future. These are the last 8 episodes of the series. *sniffs* Chris Young was never cuter!

To the best of my knowledge the series has never been made available on video (aside from the original British special) and none of it is currently available commercially.

Please, please, please, return the favor and seed to at least 100%.
