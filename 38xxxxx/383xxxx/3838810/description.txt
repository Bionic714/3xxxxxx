The original Portal-Unleashed torrent can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3837572/Portal-Unleashed

--THIS TORRENT CONTAINS--
1. Start.bat: A fix for those having problems with booting the game
2. SteamEmu.ini: Update for those that have not downloaded the original fix by loder.


This batch file should properly open the game for those getting errors, even after applying the fixed .ini file.

For those that have not fixed the .ini file, take the .ini in this directory and replace the one in your Portal directory (it should be located in X:[directories]portal). Then, take Start.bat and place it in the same directory.

Start the game with the new Start.bat and enjoy.

I can be reached at matt.bornemann@gmail.com or through Pirate Bay comments if you have any questions or problems.

**I take no credit for the original Portal Unleashed; this is merely a workaround.**
