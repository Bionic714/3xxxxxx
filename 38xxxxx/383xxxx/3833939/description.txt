?Mecaniqueros? (Todo es possible en Cuba)(2005) is a French production, directed by Joanne Michna and produced by ART G.E.I.E., that shows how the imagination and the talent have become essential elements between the Cubans.

In Cuba, many of the products that can be obtained are offered at crazy prices, spare parts that allow repairs do not exist, and the difficulties to survive are a daily problem. In the island, most habitual products are scarce, and so are spare parts to repair the apparatuses of daily use. The official wages are low, and many Cubans look for alternative sources of income. The mecaniqueros use all type of tricks to obtain those things that normally are not within reach of all.

Officialy, Ariel, one of the protagonists of the story, has a state job, checking the water in the houses of his district. But, like many Cubans, it's official salary is not sufficient to live on. For that reason, with his friends Caesar and Tommy, they look for everything what everybody needs and that is not in the State warehouses. There is nothing they cannot obtain: from gold to make a dental crown, a dress for a celebration of a youngster or spare parts for a television set repair.

But the mecaniqueros also help their families. According to the need, they are able to transform a home room into an hair dressing saloon or a restaurant: Ariel's cousin  is an esthetician, while her mother has been cooking succulent plates that she serves in a home restaurant - a 'paladar'. 

This documentary shows how necessity sharpens the minds of these determined young people. (English translation of an excellent syopsis at the RTVE page.)
