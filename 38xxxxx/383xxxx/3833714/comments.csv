In 2002, along with former teammates Lavinia Milo?ovici and Claudia Presecan, Corina Ungureanu appeared in two Japanese DVDs, Gold Bird and Euro Angels, which included scenes of the three gymnasts performing gymnastics routines topless. A number of photographs from the photobook and DVDs were subsequently published in the Japanese magazine Shukan Gendai. An edited version of the DVDs entitled 3 Gold Girls was released in Germany in 2004.

Romanian gymnasts Corina Ungureanu (22), Lavinia Milosovici (26) and Claudia Presecan (23) was banned from competing or coaching in their home country for five years for publishing  their nude Photobook and DVDs, which controversially featured the gymnasts wearing their official leotards.

PROFILE:
Lavinia Corina Milo?ovici (born October 21, 1976 in Lugoj) (Serbian: Lavinija Milo?evi?/???????? ?????????) is a Romanian Olympic gymnast of Serbian origin.An exceptionally successful athlete on the international competition circuit, Milo?ovici, also known as ""Milo"" in the gymnastics community, is considered to be one of Romania's top gymnasts of the 1990s and the most prolific female all-around gymnast of the decade, earning a total 19 World Championships or Olympic medals in a span of six years. She medalled in every single World Championships meet, Olympic Games and European Championships between 1991 and 1996, and is only the third female gymnast ever, after Larissa Latynina and Vera Caslavska, to win at least one World Championships or Olympic title on all four events. Milo?ovici was also the last gymnast ever to receive the perfect mark of 10.0 in an Olympic competition and the last to receive the benchmark score of 9.95 at the World Championships. 

Claudia Presecan (born December 28, 1979 in Sibiu) is a world-class Romanian artistic gymnast who competed at the senior international level between 1994 and 2000. She was a three-time team gold medalist at the World Championships with the Romanian team and was also a member of the gold medal-winning Romanian squad at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.

Corina Georgiana Ungureanu (born August 29, 1980, Ploie?ti, Romania) is a world-class Romanian artistic gymnast who competed internationally between 1993 and 1999. She was a member of two gold medal-winning World Championships teams and was the 1998 European Champion on the floor exercise.
She was forced to retire in 1999 due to a spinal cord injury. After retiring from gymnastics, she  posed nude for the January 2000 edition of Playboy Romania. These pictures were reprinted in Playboy Japan in May 2000.

This torrent is not for those crazy porn addicts like rudeboy186, neither for any ignorant fool.
