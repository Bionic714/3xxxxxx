,Delron40,2008-10-08T01:56Z,"Thanks to those helping me seed. Leechers remember, the community depends on you. If nobody shares, the freebies go away. Remember, the only reason you can download this free movie is because others are generous enough to keep sharing it with you. If nobody shares, everybody loses, so even if its for an extra hour or two after you get it, remember, others want to see it too, and they can't without you. "
,tdjj93,2009-01-21T21:30Z,"This movie was actually made in the year 2000.

the 1996 version is about: ""Follow the New York feature film audition process from ""Backstage"" listing to behind the scenes casting selection to the final casting of actresses. Brutally honest, funny and revealing, this film shows you how it really is being an unknown actress in New York City."""
