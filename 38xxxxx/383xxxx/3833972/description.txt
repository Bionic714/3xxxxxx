TrueCrypt 4.3a, incl. Addons, language packs, older versions, multi-distros, and even source codes of 4.3a and 4.2a.

Don't let TrueCrypt treat you like a criminal because you want older versions of TrueCrypt for older computers.

We have a right to older versions and they Are Open Source so here are versions 4.3a and 4.2a with source codes, TCGINA, TCTEMP, and 4.3a language packs.
