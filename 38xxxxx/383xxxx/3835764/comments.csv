I saw this on Google Video, and it is great.

However it does contain a few errors (I forget the specifics), and it also contradicts what other researchers and scholars claim. For example; I think it is Maxwell who said that Christ walking on water was merely the light of the rising sun skimming across the sea. E of the C claims that Christ walking on water is oil floating on the waters surface. Both make a lot of sense."

,pkm42,2008-07-02T05:34Z,"Wide ranging
Content = 8/10
Quality is below average - like its from a VCR tape,or was recorded on an ancient camcorder.

Because the commentary is so complete you could almost rip the audio out and provide that seperate as 35mB mp3,perhaps with a slideshow.

DVD Rip???

,doctawody,2008-10-03T17:30Z,"I'm very interested in an edited version!  I tried to show this to a friend of mine, but he turned it off right in the beginning when it started talking about that 911 conspiracy stuff.  He said, ""It was too leading in it's presentation.""  In other words:  he wasn't buying it.  It's a shame because this film is more about the long history of Freemasonry and religion.  The female narrator's father was a Freemason.  He wouldn't divulge anything to her because she was a woman, so she set out to make this documentary.

I think the 911 part would have been more effective if it were placed at the end. KOBKED-X, you might want to consider leaving the 911 stuff out, or make it as a separate file.  Just a thought.  It's just that there are so many 911 truth movies anyway.

However you edit this thing, I'm sure it will be good, because EOTC is so awesome.  When I tell people that this thing is 5 hours, they say, ""I don't have the time to watch that"" and ""We can't change anything anyway."""
,thesilverpanther,2009-02-28T16:56Z,"This is unfortunately nonsense, when you cross reference ""sources"" so to speak they contradict each other (reference the source not a statement or idea in the source), it's just a patchwork of conjecture, not to say there is no truth, but what is the point it being buried in this documentaries dysfunctional fantasy? Pardon my comments but I think I am being fair, and I am at a loss with regards to statements that someone has researched this and found it to be consistent and accurate. Disappointing considering who gave it to me and the comments, uninspiring fiction. I do believe in conspiracies and intricate political machinations and manipulation of power but this is crap, pardon the language, and just who is this unnamed mysterious award winning documentary producer who also apparently takes credit for investigating this documentary (not to say they didn't but just who is it were crediting)? Gday. Yes I posted the same comment on another version of this file as well because I'm mean that way.

This is a home made movie. No credits. Badly ripped Fox intro. Notovich, Ellis & Joseph Smith Junior (who is apparently a free mason and a latter day saint, referenced as a mormon in the documentary and for some reason insinuates a connection between his death and his publication) conflicting resources. Presentation of facts where they are true misleading (caesar elevated to deity 2 years after his assassination probably to placate his supporters), Josephus accounts are unverified and referenced by Ellis vaguely at his convenience and his name is flashed without noting his significance (if any), he was a politically connected celebrity historian with many works, the ""revelation"" that Amenemhat was Abraham, I couldn't find anything on this assumedly famous Antonio Bola excavator (try different spellings), the phrase ""Egyptologists agree"" is thrown around willy nilly and through my casual research I find no correlation between what this documentary claims is publicly accepted and available truth and historical theories, obviously another conspiracy to hide the truth that everyone agrees upon and knows about yaa? And the views of Egyptologists on MANY matters hardly consistent. Can't reference unverified conflicting works vaguely and inaccurately which themselves were poorly investigated (Ellis in particular calls his works ""interpretations"" by the way and the concept of his writings strike me as vanity) and stitch things together throw your own spin on it without any formal crediting, no reference to this mysterious award winning narrater/producer/researcher who for some reason created this poor quality homemade production OMG conspiracy.

This is home made, took a lot of effort but in spite of the truths it may contain they are badly misrepresented and interwoven with fantasy. This is incidentally the best way to tell a lie no? In the quest to be open minded it seems people are being fooled quite easily, you can't reference this documentary as truthful, enlightening or legitimate. Swordfish is more educational.

9/11 was so obviously a conspiracy. Or everyone watching the airspace was retarded or on drugs and forgot there are laws requiring states to have procedures in place for any form of anomaly especially alarming is the massive flight path deviation & loss of comms for an IFR flight, how explosive the buildings turned out to be. I argued with a lecturer and he said the most plausible explanation would be the planting of bombs in the building by ""terrorists"" which he thought of as very frightening (how would they pull that off and if that was the issue than whats aviation security got to do with it?). I find it frightening that people in the industry I work in should know better but are too politically correct not to believe in official findings on 911. I have forgotten my cell on at work, you don't get reception at altitude. I wonder if posting this is in violation of my companies new NDA (bloody nonsense).

Also in 911 official explanations take the official story and fit things around it thereby re""imaginin"
,thesilverpanther,2009-02-28T17:06Z,YES I POSTED THIS ON ALL VERSIONS I FOUND OF THIS VID I HAD TO DO THE RESEARCH TO CONVINCE MY FATHER ANYWAY SO ITS NOT FOR YOUR SAKES :P
