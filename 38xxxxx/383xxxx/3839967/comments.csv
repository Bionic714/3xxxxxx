,rublo,2008-11-01T00:41Z,I just downloaded this with limewire and I cant open the file...is it because i have a mac?

Help anyone!"
,rublo,2008-11-01T21:17Z,"Finally opened it....  Thank you sooooo much!

I had to extract the file using a program that only works for windows (winrar) ...once that was done I transfered it to my mac and it worked!"

,syprimadonna,2009-03-26T03:41Z,"I love these, thanks a lot!!! I am a bit  sad that some of the Kubota actions won't work...some of them will say that the select tool is not available...so it doesn't play right! :o("

,kcolumbusgirl,2009-06-25T17:12Z,"for those who say it doesn't work - did you extract the atn files to the photoshop actions folder? Dragging and dropping or trying to open the action with photoshop will not work. 

I'm downloading now - Thank you for this set!"
,guyjasper,2010-01-16T04:34Z,"hi, thanks for this upload, these are really great actions. do you also have Florabella Collection? i've been looking over the net for days and i couldn't  find any torrents for it :("
,wmilloway,2011-04-02T10:18Z,"Works like a charm...Just need an expander on a Mac so you can access the .rar files.... Just Google ""how to access .rar file on a mac"" and you will find plenty of FREE downloads. It only takes seconds to download an expander file. "
