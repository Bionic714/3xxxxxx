,Kome_iiv,2008-01-25T03:24Z,"This is an INSANE collection of Scientology books. Not only does it have (what seems to be) EVERY official Scientology course/levels, it also has a vast collection of L.R. Hubbard's books, AND popular anti-Scientology e-books mixed in. 

This is EXACTLY what Scientologists never wanted, people having freedom to exchange infromation on self improvment and spiritual guidance for FREE. SEED THIS PEOPLE! THE SCIENTOLOGY NOOBS NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GETTING INTO! AND with this collection of books, an open minded outsider can make a fair judgment as to just how well scientology's mind sharpening/honing skills really work.

,HarryNRubin,2008-02-12T04:44Z,"I tried to make up a password, using your user name and ""scientology,"" but they didnt work.  I could still go through the books and stuff so i think its fine. I just have to open the file but not unzip it :X"
,HarryNRubin,2008-02-15T05:24Z,WHATS THE PASSWORD AHHH!
,Rob888,2008-03-12T12:00Z,"@ ysj

There is no password needed to unzip ANY of the files.
Are you perhaps a SoC nutter that's just trying to dissuade people from downloading your materials?"
