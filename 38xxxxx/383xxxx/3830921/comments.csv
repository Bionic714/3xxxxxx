,Wideboy799,2008-02-04T18:49Z,Hello everyone. I have been looking for this for a long time indeed. Already uploaded 19.5Gb on this torrent alone. Stuck at  downloading 79% - could someone please seed this some more!?
,stukaville,2008-02-04T20:18Z,"Let me know if you require a new torrent for this, i deleted it but would make a new torrent if anyones really stuck"
,AllenIvy3,2008-02-06T13:35Z,Hi.Could you please seed the movie again or make a new one.I'd really appreciate this.Thanks.
,stukaville,2008-02-14T20:45Z,"ok, i had deleted this, but i have re created an iso, and downloaded the torrent and it appears to be checking it as I type, so hopefully it will work and help you guys that have been stuck, plz let me know if this works ok, i created the original iso with magiciso, and have recreated it with Nero this time so fingers crossed."
,stukaville,2008-02-14T20:50Z,"ok, it finsihed checking, got to 100 percent, but instead of seeding it started to download again, i will try again with magiciso, if that fails i will create a fresh torrent."
