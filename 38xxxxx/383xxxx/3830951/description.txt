Addictive strategy game that will not hog your resources. 

"Traffic Giant" 
follows on from "Industry Giant". The player manages the public
transport system running between various towns. His job is to
establish and maintain routes of transportation. Two gaming
styles offer completely different gameplay: The first is to
play the successful entrepreneur, whose main objective is to
achieve maximum profits. The other is to play the role of the
government official in charge of public transport, whose main
concern is the well-being of his citizens and, obviously,
the citizens' votes in the next election.
