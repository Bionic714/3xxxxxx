,BullRot84,2008-03-16T14:51Z,"If you got an error during install, or the install hangs re-download missing parts of the torrent by overwriting it (it will only download missing/bad parts) ... The Game Works !!"
,wolfhowler1,2008-04-06T14:52Z,This torrent dosn't work. I managed to install it but when i load up the game the grafics go all funny and I have to exit the game.
,shitshape,2008-09-04T19:44Z,"I've read that Traffic Giant was coded with a lot of dirty hacks that weren't officially documented for the versions of Windows available at the time. This, apparently, is why it doesn't work well with later versions of Windows. I don't use Windows myself, but I believe that recent versions of Windows can be set to emulate earlier versions of Windows when you launch particular applications. Try doing that and see whether you have any more luck."

,xrace50,2010-02-15T18:34Z,Does not work on Windows 7... :( Too bad

,gareth44,2010-08-12T10:43Z,"Um, guys (and ladies too), if anyone can throw in a pre-installed repack of this, I'd be greatful. I have problems with running the 1.4 gold patch. It gives some kind of an error."
