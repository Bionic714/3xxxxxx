In the 1980s, Tom Lehrer collaborated to create a theatrical show of his songs, some previously unreleased, some with up-to-date lyrics added by Mr. Lehrer. The show first opened in London's West End, and later came to America. This is the OST from the London show, sampled from good vinyl, and meticulously de-noised.
