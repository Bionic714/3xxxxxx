A Bootleg of the monumental 77Boadrum performance led by Yamantaka Eye of the Boredoms. The audio may sound funny at parts, mainly due to the fact that they had speakers traveling around the drumming spiral as well.

wikipedia:

77 Boadrum was a concert held on July 7, 2007 (7/7/07) at 7:07 pm consisting of 77 drummers. The concert was organized by Boredoms. The title of the concert was a portmanteau of "Boredoms," "Drum," and "77." It was held at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York.
