,abajanga,2007-11-19T18:41Z,After using several times I got an error. Register Code is not correct! We strongly recommend you copy/paste it. The key doesn?t work! I had this with another Magic torrent download too.

I'm having the same problem with mine, anyone know how to fix this?"
,waccu,2012-02-13T19:41Z,"its amacing to see that almost every torrent from ""lotsoflemon""isnt seeded correctly. IÂ´m beginning to think that maybe he is from Denmark and is having upload issues just like me. The most recent of his torrents are from 05-2008. the one i uploaded in 2006 is still working but I also seeded it for 16 weeks on a 4Gb net connection"
