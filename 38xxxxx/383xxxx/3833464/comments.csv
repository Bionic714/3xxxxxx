Bulgaria is one of the most recent newcomers to the Eurovision Song Contest. The country did not have any luck reaching the Final in their first two attempts in 2005 and 2006. This all changed at the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest in Helsinki, Finland, when Elitsa TODOROVA and Stoyan YANKOULOV went straight through the Semi-Final. They ended up in a distinguished 5th position in the Final with their song Water. At the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest in Belgrade, Bulgaria can sit back, relax and enjoy their automatic qualification to the Final.
