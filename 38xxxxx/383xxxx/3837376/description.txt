This PPF will patch the Uphuck v. 1.3 installation DVD to be fully compatible with the ASRock 775Dual-VSTA motherboard. When the ASRock 775Dual-VSTA motherboard package is selected in the drivers section, all necessary drivers will be loaded for 100% support of motherboard chipsets after installation. All other Uphuck installation options are still functional.

Fixes:

SATA - Installation disc recognizes SATA, patched kext installed
Network - Installs support for VIA Rhine
Audio - Skippyretard ALC 888 kext installed for full input and output support
