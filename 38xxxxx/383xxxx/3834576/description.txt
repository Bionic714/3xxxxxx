At the height of the terror of WW1, the few survivors of an English regiment, trapped behind enemy lines, take refuge in a deserted German trench, waiting to be rescued.
But when no help arrives, one by one they begin to suffer mysterious and gruesome fates. Slowly, a terror beyond all human understanding is unleashed. Is the trench possessed by something even more terrible than the war that surrounds them or does some other unknown evil wait to claim them all?
