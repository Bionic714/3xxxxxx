,xenomy,2007-10-22T08:04Z,"Yeah great loss for Nightwish-
people say shes nothing without Nightwish but Nightwish will never be the same without her- Annette is an amateur compared to Tarja's Voice,and most Nightwish fans are still trying to get acostumed to such a different voice as Annette's."
,thundergoddess,2007-11-04T21:03Z,"Poor, simple, commercial child! She is this. I really have gone mad when I read the letter to her in the nightwish site. She disguss me!"
,kamasutra,2007-11-05T11:43Z,"Tarja rocks, nightwish go hell now... "
,Docktor Metal,2008-02-03T01:06Z,"Its not Tarja thts nothig without Nightwish,

,daemon4arose,2008-02-05T21:29Z,"Hey, MJ is a pedofile, DaVinci, and many more were gay, most poets are drunkards, and by this I'm not saying that Tarja is bad, just that art and artist are two different things, and what Tarja does IS ART. That child who took her place in Nightwish can't even begin to immagine what it takes to raise herself at that level. Thanks for the torrent man."
