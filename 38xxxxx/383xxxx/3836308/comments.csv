,insomnyuk,2007-10-10T08:21Z,"Seriously, you only have to pay 1 dollar to buy this album. How big of a fucking asshole are you exactly? Even 1 dollar for ten songs is too much eh? You fail it at life. Kill yourself."
,insomnyuk,2007-10-10T08:23Z,"Honestly, you could pay for this album at 10 cents per track. You are a terrible person. Shame on you."
,gua-no,2007-10-10T08:27Z,"Give the guy a break.
I paid 10ÂŁ for this album yesterday, and I haven't recieved the download link yet.
Ofcourse I'm downloading it here...
I'm also ordering the real package for 40ÂŁ."
,hookadude,2007-10-10T08:36Z,You could buy it for 0.00 too. lay off my 1.63 never downloaded properly so i am here.
,DaiTan64,2007-10-10T08:50Z,"insomnyuk, if you don't agree with pirating why the fuck r u here? Go buy the album and if your gonna support the artist why don't you pay more than 1 lousy dollar instead of whining at ppl for downloading for free"
,insomnyuk,2007-10-10T09:34Z,"Anyone is free to comment on this website, that's why I'm here.

Oh, and I did pay for the album. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. I don't buy the lie that you didn't get your download link yet. Check your spam filters you scum."
,cookieshoes,2007-10-10T10:25Z,"insomnyuk, you're right. You could've paid 10 cents per track. But you also could've paid nothing. The band gave that option. So what difference does it make downloading it straight from the band's website or from here? None, whatsoever. In fact, by downloading from the band's website you have to pay the credit card processing fee, which the band wouldn't be seeing anyway. Why throw your money at Visa or Mastercard?

There are no ethics or morality involved in any of this. Nothing to be ashamed of. The music is being spread per the band's wishes. Otherwise they would've put DRM on the tracks and not have done any of this in the first place. "
,STGstylah,2007-10-10T14:29Z,"Cookieshoes, you are a wise man! Couldn't have said it better myself. Morality and music are a strange mix indeed"
,cookieshoes,2007-10-10T16:12Z,"No, actually Radiohead is fighting for themselves. Has nothing to do with us. Offering their music for free is not as revolutionary as everyone would like to believe. They are actually making the smart decision based on business. They know that it would've just been downloaded for free anyway. Why not make an advertising campaign out of it, and get noticed at the same time? We're not part of some grand experiment. This isn't a giant middle-finger to the recording industry.  That industry is crumbling because for too long the labels have been creating environments which are contrary to what is actually happening.  They keep rising prices, sticking with DRM, forcing more ""Hit makers"" and less quality acts on us, etc.  Radiohead has nothing to do with the bottoming out of the industry.  At some point they were as scared shitless as any other working musician. This is merely a changing time in this industry. Things will change soon enough. Believe me, this industry will still find a way to get your money, like it or not.

There are plenty of opportunities in life for which one can pretend to be sanctimonious. This isn't one of them.  Enjoy the record. That's what it's there for. "
,STGstylah,2007-10-10T17:01Z,"Ahum, Makhno? I didn't ask Radiohead to do my fighting for me. I'm pretty capable of that myself if I feel the need. Furthermore, I don't need you calling me a fuckhead. It's uncalled for. And I don't piss on Radiohead in any way, shape or form. 

Did you consider the possibility that Radiohead is only after the money by shutting the record company out? Or maybe they are control freaks, suffering from a bad case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder....

*raising the black flag*"
,b0dyrem0ver,2007-10-11T02:44Z,"ever considered they decided that a record label wasn't deserving of the lion's share of the sales or are you so intellectually challenged as to think artists get a good deal with record contracts? you have to sell millions to see anything now and not many bands do.

i'm downloading this to hear it. i've bought every album of theirs on original and when the discbox they speak of comes out, with the vinyl, bonus CD and all, i will buy that too. 

Makhno is no pirate, some lonely gimp with his dick up his mum's ass most likely. 

insomnyuk needs to get a life, someone not checking their spam filter is hardly scum, certainly not when they've paid 10 times more for it than you did, you fucking loser!

:D"
,curekid90,2007-10-11T05:47Z,"hey douchebags, did you not know radiohead was originally going to release the album for free?

the music companys stepped in and said no, so now they let you choose the price

so before you judge others for ripping the music, you probably dont know, this was thom yorke's intention

leave people the fuck alone and let them listen to music"
,rubberkeith,2007-10-11T17:48Z,Just an FYI for b0dyrem0ver: Radiohead's release has so far gone unaided by record labels. Only the rumoured 2008 CD version (not the discbox) will be released under a record label.
,jorgenb,2007-10-12T08:13Z,"You stupid cunts!
At last a band does exactly what you dumb fucks want - put out an album for free on the internet.
At least give them the hits on their own webpage.
Radiohead have been mistreated before by the filesharing community - and this is how you thank them?
Congratulations - maybe you've managed to spoil the whole new concept with artists putting out music on the web for a resonable price by themselves.
Assholes..."
,STGstylah,2007-10-12T14:56Z,"As the provided bitrate (160 kbps) is completely sub-standard, Radiohead should pay me if I was to decide to download their album (which I am not). "
,Replica42,2008-05-25T20:55Z,"This is to all you anti-piracy people out there: The music industry are already a great business, but it could be even greater if the record companies would listen to their customers instead of being assholes. When people buy an object, let's say a car, they first want to try it and see every side of it, before they decide to buy it or not. And they don't want restrictions on which roads they can drive on and which ones they are not allowed to drive on. If you think about it for a second before flaming me for this comment, you will understand how stupid it sounds with restrictions on car driving. When I buy a song, I expect to have the freedom to listen to it everywhere I want to, be it my iPod, my mp3-player of another brand, on my car stereo, my cd player, and I even expect to have the freedom to give a copy of it to a friend. I'm not paying 200NOK for a cd with 18 songs, that I cannot listen through enough to decide whether I like it or not, that I cannot burn to have a copy in my car, that I cannot copy to my PC and move to my mp3-player. I'm not even paying 80NOK for an album on iTunes that I cannot play on every media I want. 
The way most ""pirates"" do it, is that they download an album or a song from sites like this, listen to it enough to decide whether they like it or not, and then go buy it DRM-free on iTunes. There are not that many who download and keep it and never pay for it. That's just an prejudice created by some of the anti-piracy people.
When the record companies start listening to their customers and let them have it their way, I am convinced that we will see nearly no piracy.
