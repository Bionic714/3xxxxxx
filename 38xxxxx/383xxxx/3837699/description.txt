                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It√Üs bedtime, and Sam Sullivan parks his wheelchair just so. He leans gently 
forward, then falls over in a carefully choreographed drop onto his bed. 
Wrestling his body out of his clothes, he struggles to position himself. An 
hour later, comfortable at last, he speed-dials his campaign manager to review 
the day.

Sam is running for mayor.

Sam Sullivan was a local curiosity, the quadriplegic city councilor in a 
pinstripe suit, with a pipe dream of leading his shattered right wing party 
back to power. Citizen Sam goes deep inside Sullivan's mayoral campaign to tell 
the remarkable story behind his rise from obscurity.

As the campaign begins, Sullivan admits to giving addicts money to buy crack 
and heroin. His opponents call him a do-nothing politician, and a nut. The 
media write him off, while everyone tiptoes around the issue of his disability.

6 am. Sam is back on the phone, going over the day's schedule while he reverses 
the previous night's routine, into fresh clothes and then a precarious move 
from bed to chair. His partner, Lynn, adjusts his tie and leads him out the 
door to his first appointment, a radio debate.

With unprecedented access, director Joe Moulins blends the rough and tumble of 
the campaign with intimate moments from Sullivan's daily life. A brutally frank 
and funny video diary counts down the days to the election. From war room to 
bedroom, Citizen Sam is an unflinching portrait of the one-of-a-kind politician 
who has become the face of Vancouver on the international stage.
