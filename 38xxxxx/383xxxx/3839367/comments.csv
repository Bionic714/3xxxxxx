,sonofwill,2009-09-21T01:33Z,"Yeah, finally downloaded, and I guess I just assumed that since I've always been able to find subtitle tracks for even obscure movies, why would this be different?   But I don't think there ARE any subtitles out here unfortunately, at least not in English - if anyone knows a link, PLEASE post it! It looks like a good show"
,tribal13,2010-05-07T00:04Z,"Anyone can, very simply, create their own subs. from vob. (DVD)

Just d/l the free vobsub/virtual dub and on the net look for instructions (Quite simple) I've even got a little tutorial there so no excuses."
