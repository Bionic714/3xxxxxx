After u have completed downloading, i recommend u go to settings of your torrent client program & disable upload limit, & then just let it stay on ur list for as long as u can. without upload limits it seeds faster = u reach high download/upload ratio faster & can stop seeding without feeling bad.

I recommend using media player classic, or BSplayer, but just codecs (xvid) installed, almost any video program will play them. 
CAPH is only name of group wich released the current version, like LOL & XOR & such. 
& htdv means high definition tv, so quality is much better, but also file size is bigger."
,oOW3stOo,2007-10-22T23:58Z,"guys i have a question. if i want to set up a RSS feed so i can get my torrent program to download any new episodes of prison break automatically, how do i do it? or is this just not possible?

any help is appreciated. thanks people."
