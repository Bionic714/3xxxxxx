,Patton2,2007-10-07T17:25Z,A bit more info?
,maitrecarrefour,2007-10-07T18:05Z,"Well, not much to add though... Sources are my DVDs, with subtitles mostly for central/east Europe (also greek, turkish, portugese, hebrew, hungarian, etc.), with exception of part II (region 1). Ripped with CloneDVD for backup purpose. Part III might be a problem to burn properly, try with ImgBurn (the best recording app around!) at low speed, to avoid buffer underruns.

,Hellinc,2007-10-08T15:29Z,Any Danish subs?
,maitrecarrefour,2007-10-08T23:42Z,"Nope, sorry."
,GutzRage,2007-10-10T17:15Z,"maitrecarrefour, did you remove some of the subtitle when you ripped the movies?
I can see for example, chapter I has only 3 english streams and Croatian (vts_01_0.ifo), while the video_ts.ifo shows there supposed to be 11 sub streams..."
,maitrecarrefour,2007-10-11T00:10Z,"Mhm, no, i didn't. Ripped as a whole by CloneDVD, however, i've noticed that it has been donig some silly things during burning (that's why i've burned them all with ImgBurn at the end...), so maybe, also during reading... shit happens."
,GutzRage,2007-10-11T00:34Z,"As far as i know, only chapter IV has all the subs... maybe III too...
Is it possible to ask from you to re-upload Movies I, V & VI?"
,raisputin,2007-10-11T12:51Z,Is this no longer seeding? Got to 14.03% paused my DL to show the Girlfriend something and now it won't DL anymore :/
,maitrecarrefour,2007-10-11T23:52Z,"As it looks, clonedvd has failed to rip some of the subtitles (though no errors reported...)! As it seems, i'll have to re-rip :-(no clonedvd this time... )"
,GutzRage,2007-10-12T00:59Z,"Tnx, i'm looking forward too it :)
DVDFab Platinum is a great ripping program, if you are interested...
Very much appreciated."
,maitrecarrefour,2007-10-13T17:26Z,"Ok. Re-rip in progress using freeware DVDshrink (thanks for the tip on DVDFab, but I prefer to use GPL/Freeware whenever possible - small, simple, effective, free (at least after successful rip of the 1st episode - subs, audio, etc. verified). After I have compared contents of the DVDs and files ripped with CloneDVD, I can say that it didn't do it's job! I'll still seed this torrent but expect complete re-rip of all collection using DVDshrink in a day or two (initially in super-seed mode to spread chunks to as many leechers as possible). Please, after completing torrent, stay on-line if possible, for a week or so, or at least until new seeders join the swarm. Thanks again to GutzRage for noticing flaws in rips."
,GutzRage,2007-10-14T01:26Z,"If you can upload the collection with no compression, it will be perfect.
.. thanks again for your work and this great collection."
,GutzRage,2007-10-18T14:37Z,Did something happen?
,raisputin,2007-10-21T10:57Z,Something happen? Now at 0 peers and 58% done
,GutzRage,2007-10-26T02:55Z,"Well, i guess there won't be no re-upload... shame :("
,Vitoria666,2007-10-26T10:22Z,"seed on, seed on"
