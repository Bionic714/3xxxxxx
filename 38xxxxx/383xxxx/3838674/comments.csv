,poppopoppopoppo,2008-10-26T19:26Z,"Thank you for upload, perfect torrent! 100% of virus and works perfectly. One of the greatest game. Sadly only few people is playing this game, its so old. :( I hope this torrent will newer die. Promise me KiDD420 that you will seed this torrent always, i might need it someday. :) "
,KiDD420,2008-11-15T05:59Z,"I had multiple hard drive failures and lost my game and music archives. I am re-downloading my own torrent to seed. I will seed forever!
This is actually a dev copy I received from an employee from MicroProse years ago. The goto function's path finding algorithm is kinda screwed up... all good."
,inititis2,2009-04-17T00:17Z,"I have just found this game on: http://www.bestoldgames.net/eng/old-games/civilization-2.php and it was only 20mb and a free download and it's so strange because it seems to be the full game and works perfectly, I used to have the retail copy of this so I know what it should be like. anyway check it out. "
,pseudonymblah,2009-06-19T04:43Z,"@KiDD420 (or anyone else)

I downloaded the torrent, converted the .nrg to an .iso, burned the .iso onto a DVD (wouldn't fit onto a CD), but am now stumped as to what to do next. Advice, please?

Thanks for your hard work!"
,KiDD420,2009-07-10T07:08Z,"It's a copy I made with nero.....

I usually just mount it with daemon tools....."

,billars3,2010-06-08T02:08Z,"i can't pass the ""we can't find the CD"" screen... What should I do? I have installed successfully installed the game using Power ISO but now i can't play... :(
Can someone help? I tried the No CD patch but does not work... what can I do?"
,black francis,2011-03-28T17:47Z,"I have the same problem. Can't get past the ""No CD found"" screen. The funny thing is, it worked when I first downloaded and installed it. The cd thing never even came up the first two times I ran the application. But now it does.

Tried running the NO cd crack listed above, but it doesn't work in windows 7. Even tried running it in DOSBOX, but then it comes up with Crack Unsuccessful.

This might have something to do with the fact that I've already run the patch, but it still doesn't work."
,black francis,2011-03-28T18:02Z,"Ok. i got it to work finally. What I had to do is move the civ.exe file and the no cd crack into a seperate temporary folder which I created on c:\ as ""temp"". Then I ran DOSBOX and mounted C as C:\temp

Now when I ran the crack in DOSBOX it successfully cracked the exe and the game runs. But there is still the issue of not being able to save or load. Which is also kind of annoying."
,pyro12345,2011-11-29T03:16Z,"i would love to play multiplayer against anyone interested, however there appears to be no one online whenever i try to play....and i check several times throughout the day every day for over a week now, still no one online to play with"
,DarkzuL00,2012-02-19T21:46Z,"Thx a lot for this torrent! Civ 2 is the best!

I already installed it and works perfectly. Im using windows XP. I mounted the .NRG image with Daemon tools lite.
I havent tried the no-cd included on the torrent cus i just leave the image mounted.
The high council works correctly.

I'll be seeding :) Thx again for this great game."
,afonzi,2012-04-03T14:40Z,"Need Help please. I've downloaded it, mounted the image using PowerIso, but the setup just WON'T run, it gives admin authorization and it just doesnt open. I can't even patch it. HELP PLEASE. "
,cromwell564,2012-04-03T22:56Z,"I tried everthing and can't get it to work.
Keeps giving an error.
Does anyone know if it works in Windoezzz7?"
,Kelisen,2012-06-12T18:07Z,"Nero? Really? So I can't open this without installing crappy software...

While I appreciate the upload, the internet would also appreciate that you upload in standard formats such as rar, zip, 7z, or preferably iso."
,benamb,2012-06-14T06:08Z,"I just downloaded this.

I opened Power Iso, selected,""Open"" and the Civ2 file I'd just downloaded. Then highlight all, ""Mount Image to drive [whatever]"". Then go to that drive, install the game using the autorun file :)

Unfortunately I got as far as starting a new game and then it crashed.I'm about to try again..."
,anom__2,2012-06-16T23:09Z,gack!  howto reliably convert this nrg file to an .iso on Ubuntu linux?  getting ___ for file names when converting...
,_HyDrAg_,2012-06-29T14:06Z,does it need DOSbox on windows 7?
,KiDD420,2012-06-29T21:02Z,"This copy works for me 100% of the time, if you can't get it to work I can't really help you...
Also if you are just going to bitch about the file format you can just fuck right off! Nero was the only application that was able to properly image this disk in 2007!"
,ncromarty,2012-08-19T06:58Z,"1st, thanks for the upload! fed up with civ 3&4 they aren't as good and too clunky. would be up for playing the multiplayer sometime with anyone interested!"
