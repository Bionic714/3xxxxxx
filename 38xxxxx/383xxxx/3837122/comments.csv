,riotpunk77,2007-10-17T21:48Z,"says 3.11 in the filename when you open up the rar... might i suggest going back to the 1st grade, znsvq? maybe you'll learn that 3.11 is not equal to 4, and hot to properly round numbers"
,riotpunk77,2007-10-17T21:49Z,and maybe i'll learn how to spell :\
,dexter_ioio,2007-10-22T21:14Z,"not to worry it comes with automatic updates it will update for you no problem

,destiny71,2007-12-03T02:22Z,"updates from 3.11 to 3.25, then to 3.28, not to 4!

misleading upload."
,bluetybo,2008-01-03T02:40Z,To comment above just keep updating and you will eventually get to 4
,sanbeecest,2008-01-21T07:14Z,Works fine...I was able to upgrade to 4.56.  Thanks!
,yakare,2008-02-06T17:31Z,"i agree with riotpunk77 
i doesnÂ´t want to upgrade! itÂ´s says mobile phone tools deluxe 4. i downloaded because of that!"
,yeslover5,2008-02-10T01:34Z,"Yes, it Works, one thing, if you have a phone newer than the first razr, youhave to update it all the way to 4.28b then anyfone motorola phone from Sprint, Alltel, Cingular, T-Mobile, and Some Verizon Phones. Does not work with all nextel phones."
,turtle815,2008-03-09T19:49Z,"Hey it works fine just Live update the hell out of it and you will get what you need, took me like 30 min to get it all done, Awesome upload, thanks"
,snestor,2008-03-20T22:29Z,Awesome upload but this software makes my pc slow as hell. And i have an amd x2 3.2 gig procesor and i dont like it. Is there any other software or any way to read my cell phone an w385 as a remomable disk drive? I dont want to have to use this plus it doesnt let me put music/ pics etc on it. Even though i have ringtones and music on it. Please enlighten me :) I hate cell phones.

,gesangbaer,2008-06-20T07:48Z,"Here is a link to a working version of MPT, hosted here on TPB.

The download is bigger but it updates to version 5. Very nice package."
,RubbaDub9202,2008-07-05T22:40Z,"Want a FREE, LEGIT copy of MOTOROLA PHONE TOOLS?? Well read this:
1. Call Motorola's Customer Svc: 1866-289-6686
2. When the automated voice comes on, keep saying ""operator"" or ""customer service"".
3. When a person comes on, give them a fake name when they ask.(or your real name - it doesnt matter)
4. Tell them you BOUGHT the software (from, lets say, best buy). You've installed and uninstalled it numerous times... But when you go to open the program, NOTHING happens...
5. THEY WILL ASK FOR YOUR EMAIL. GIVE THEM YOUR REAL EMAIL ADDRESS! THEY WILL EMAIL YOU THE LATEST COPY OF PHONETOOLS!
I KNOW, KUZ I JUST DID THIS... I PROMISE YOU!!!
GOOD LUCK, PEOPLE!

:)"
,bruno212,2008-08-31T08:09Z,So why don't you do us a favor and just upload here the upgrade software that Motorola sent you?
