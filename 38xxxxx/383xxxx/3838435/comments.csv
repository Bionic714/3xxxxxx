,DeathByJayJay,2008-02-21T01:43Z,Thanks Mate :)
,2k3autococker,2008-04-02T20:28Z,Do you have to activate it or anything? Keygen or something?
,Supertorrent1122,2008-05-18T07:01Z,When will this work in Ubuntu 8.04?
,Wayfarer247,2008-06-16T19:19Z,It is in .sh form.  Not sure how to use this in Fedora 9.  Any ideas?
,Spre01,2008-07-19T20:44Z,"@Wayfarer247 go to konsole in the folder where .sh file is. You know with cd ..
Then type ""sh fileyouwanttorun.sh""
this file doesn't to be executable because you will use ""sh"" command. This works like a charm, thank you very much. :)
btw, people use google and you will find answer much faster."

""File doesn't have to be executable""."
