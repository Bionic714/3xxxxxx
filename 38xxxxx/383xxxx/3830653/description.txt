This ambient track by Finnish ambient producer Doc and Russian pianist Lena Selyanina is their special contribution to "Big Space Project" on the popular Finnish mp3 website mikseri.net:
 
http://www.mikseri.net/artists/?id=99196

In this project ten different artists each are to create a song about one of the planets of the Solar System, with Sun and the space beyond serving as an intro and an outro to the project. 

The starting point for this track was Lena's impressionistic piano improvisation on the Neptunus theme. The improvisation moves around in G# Minor, "the bluest of musical modes", as Lena puts it. The piano is surrounded by a mysterious and meditative ambient soundworld. The entire 17 minute song could be interpreted as a long, symbolic probe-like dive through the blue, dreamlike gas layers of Neptune to ever deeper and darker realms, all the way down to the solid rock and metal core of the planet, and from there back to the starlight.



Enjoy,
