Stardock WindowBlinds Enhanced v6.0 [No changing SID by EmBraCe]

WindowBlinds is a one-of-a-kind utility that allows Windows users to completely change the look and feel of the Windows interface by applying a new skin. There are thousands of different skins to choose from that are freely downloadable from the WindowBlinds website.

A WindowBlinds skin can make Windows look like an alternative operating system, like their favorite sports or car brand, or something completely new. Because WindowBlinds uses the latest hardware acceleration features of modern video cards, WindowBlinds won't slow down your computer and uses very little memory.

WindowBlinds is safe and easy to use. It doesn't alter any system files and users can switch between the default Windows look and feel and a custom WindowBlinds skin with the click of a button. In addition, WindowBlinds has been tested to ensure it works with Windows Vista, so you know it is compatible, reliable, and more secure.

INSTALLATION:
*************
1) Install WindowBlinds
2) Close activation window (twice)
3) Start task-manager and kill:
-> vista: WbVista.exe (and VistaSrv.exe if listed)
-> xp: WBINST~1.exe
4) Start the keyfilemaker and apply the patch to WbSrv.dll
5) Generate a keyfile and save it in the same folder

Now many are going to download and see that the keygen refers to the SID. Trust me, this will not change ur SID, infact, it puts your computer SID into windowblind WbSrv.dll File. No changing, and as far as Stardock is concerned, you have a legit copy :-)!!!!

NOTE: this is build 32 for XP and 49 for Vista
