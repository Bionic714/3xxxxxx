,vajlent,2007-10-09T08:40Z,"Ok, letÂ´s test this one out then ;)"
,~Green~Fire~,2007-10-09T15:51Z,"thanx...It work but with some little trick
After you've moved the crack into the Stardock 
folder and patch the file in there then afterwards
the activate window will appear again when you 
start the prog and you remember the pass??
yea after posting an e-mail you past that in and
click activate it will complain about an old serial
so if the activate Window won't be gone the next 
time you click the prog icon try it again as I did
and yep it finally did work a bit case sensitive
but should work....but if you already have 
version 5.5 Enhaced then no need to Install this
if your not running on Vista aw course as nothing
much new in this version...in fact they just 
moved the buttons a bit -lol- well and that the 
prog in it self look a little bit different.

thanx anyhow now I have tried it and did seed it
to one or so followers. :)"

,dscm,2007-12-31T10:58Z,"I have a problem! please help me.. when I patch WbSrv.dll, it will say "" Error Can't open file (file is running or otherwise accessed)"" I tried uninstalling and installing again and still the same error! how can i patch it? also on the activation code it needs an email address. please help!"
,gesangbaer,2008-02-15T01:01Z,"When I copy the keyfile maker into the directory then run it and try to patch the dll, I get the following error message

Already patched or another fileversion

I am running xp 64. 

Any ideas?"
,gafrin,2008-02-25T03:17Z,"I made it work with mine. Here's the steps I did. 

1.) After installing follow the instructions
(INSTALLATION:
*************
1) Install WindowBlinds
2) Close activation window (twice)
3) Start task-manager and kill:
-> vista: WbVista.exe (and VistaSrv.exe if listed)
-> xp: WBINST~1.exe
4) Start the keyfilemaker and apply the patch to WbSrv.dll)
5) Generate a keyfile and save it in the same folder)
 then reboot

2.) After rebooting BEFORE starting WindowsBlinds again I repatched the WbSrv.dll (on my other PC the WbSrv.dll can't be patched again so proceed with next step if it can't be patched again.) 
3.) Generate and save the keyfile again.

I did those steps because after your first use the
Keyfile you generated will mysteriously disappear on the next reboot. And in some cases the WbSrv.dll will become unpatched again.)

After that WindowsBlinds works perfectly again"
,D3Ka1D,2008-05-09T03:50Z,"man... I really want to try this but after MANY attempts with a LOT of other ones, I have given up.... I might try tomorrow."

,HouseAtlantic,2009-07-03T23:50Z,"Works man thx zz4spd, didn't have to do anything with the activation window. Key didn't even show up as a virus I was excited about that ;P"
,338866,2009-12-06T21:14Z,"when instructions followed, this works on XP32, and reports from any AV of a trojan are a false alarm, if reported at all.

thank you, for the one theme i desire ever to use is here."
