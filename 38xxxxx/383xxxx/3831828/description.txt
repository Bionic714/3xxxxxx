Police sirens wail and cars explode in the gang-infested, smash-and-crash mayhem of GRAND THEFT AUTO 2 from Rockstar Games. Six treacherous gangs control the city, and your role is to ally yourself with one of them and gain their respect by carrying out dangerous missions. You'll engage in heists, bombings, assassinations, and contraband deliveries and the better you do, the more points you rack up. The more points you gain, the angrier rival gangs become towards you and the more police (and eventually even the military) will try to stop you. Join up with the devious Yakuza, Rednecks, Hari Krishnas, Russians, SRS or Loonies in heavy shooting, racing, and rioting action. You can watch the mayhem unfold as you blitz across the gigantic city maps performing dastardly deeds and outwitting the cops and FBI. A throbbing Drum and Bass soundtrack keeps you pumped up while you're mowing down victims with pistols, shotguns, Molotov cocktails, grenades and more. GRAND THEFT AUTO 2 for the Dreamcast is street shooting, hard-driving gameplay for hoods of all ages.
