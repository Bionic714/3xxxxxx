Plot Summary: Taking place shortly after the events of the original Wrong Turn, a group of six contestants are thrown together for six days in a simulated post-apocalyptic wasteland due to their participation in a reality television show called The Ultimate Survivalist: The Apocalypse, hosted and produced by a retired military commander Dale Murphy (Henry Rollins), in which the winner will walk away with $100,000. Located in a remote part of West Virginia, the contestants soon discover that what they really are fighting for is their survival against a family of hideously deformed inbred cannibals who plan to ruthlessly butcher them all.
