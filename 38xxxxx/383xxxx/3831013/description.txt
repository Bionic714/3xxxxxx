Digital Energy System presents a spiritual and    
religious journey. This release is intended to    
show you the true and real purpose of this        
musical project. The CD contains 8 tracks          
previously unreleased. It is full of pure and      
faithful energy and has been a rewind back to the  
roots of Trance, Goa and Psy.

Group Notes                                          
After more than a half decade we think it is time  
to change this message. The scene changed so much  
in the past few years. Many lamers hangin' around  
sharing scene  releases on  public places such as  
FXP-Pubs, DC++ hubs,  P2P  networks  and  so  on.  
WE  DON'T  WANT  OUR  RELEASES  GETTiNG      
SPREAD  TO  SUCH  LAME  PLACES!!!          
The psytrance scene is kinda small and needs YOUR  
SUPPORT. If  you LOVE  this  music  (like we do),  
please BUY the music  (like we do)!  Artists work  
long & hard on their music.  Please be honest and  
support the  artists & labels  to make more great  
music in the future too.  Every sold  CD  counts!  
Our  releases are  meant  for promotion only - to  
give  you  a  sample  of  the  retail  product.  
NEVER FORGET - THiS iS NOT A COPY, iT'S JUST MP3!  
Furthermore we wanna say thanks to all the people  
who made this  whole thing  happen,  in the past,  
present and future.  And finally, we want to send  
greetings  to  all our  fellow  friends  within  
the    scene!  You  know    who    you  are!
