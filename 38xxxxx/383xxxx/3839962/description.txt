From Home of the Underdogs (http://www.the-underdogs.info/index.php), this torrent is the fully working version of SimFarm as it was created to properly run in the Windows OS.  It's backwards compatible so you should have no issues.

Just FYI; there are two subfolders named Disk1 and Disk2; in order for the game to properly install itself, just leave them named that way and located in the same directory together.  If you do that, the autoinstall will work perfectly.  ^_^  Enjoy!
