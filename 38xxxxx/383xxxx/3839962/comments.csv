,Elzeothis,2007-12-05T04:53Z,"Firstly, I didn't 'make' this anything; I'm merely offering a torrent of another person's file.

Secondly, I'm not sure what you're doing to 'install' the file; my advice is this: Extract the Disk1.zip to C:/disk 1 and the Disk2.zip to C:/disk 2 and try running the setup program again."
,xellb14,2009-06-18T07:54Z,"er, the file size is 1.5 Mb, guys what is that? a zipped link or something?"
