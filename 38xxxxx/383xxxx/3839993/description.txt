Ray Mears journeys back in time to find out what our Stone Age ancestors would have eaten, in this major new series for BBC Two.

Today, our bodies are the same as those of our hunter-gatherer ancestors, but our diets are very different. Microwave meals and fast-food snacks are light years away from a diet of wilted nettles and berries. In an age where obesity is a growing problem in Britain, Ray asks if there is something to be learnt by looking at the diets of our Stone Age ancestors.

Combining archaeological findings from around the world with his own extensive knowledge of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, Ray pieces together a picture of our ancestors' diet.

Professor Gordon Hillman, an expert in the use of plants through the ages, is on hand to shed light on the leaves, roots, berries and nuts that people would have eaten and to show viewers how they would have cooked them.
