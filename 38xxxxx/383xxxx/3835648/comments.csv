You need a custom firmware for your PSP

If you have one of the newer custom m33 firmwares (I think anything above 2.6), you can put isos in ROOT->ISO, and it will automatically detect them.

If you are still on an older custom firmware, you need to download a homebrew program called UMD Emulator."
