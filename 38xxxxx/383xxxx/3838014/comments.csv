,alphonse123,2007-12-02T12:36Z,"Angelina Jolie will star in Atlas Shrugged, not this movie. Both are novels written by Ayn Rand. "
,sir_scutter,2008-04-29T13:58Z,"Actually, I believe angelina jolie being in Atlas Shrugged is rumored. I couldn't see her or Brad Pitt actually WANTING to be in Atlas Shrugged.. Much the same way Dominique thinks with the public and Howard Roark's buildings."
