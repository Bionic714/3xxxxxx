is it good quality,screen size and sound quality?"
[T],bugguy,2007-10-18T03:33Z,"It is acceptable quality from my standpoint.  It isn't HD, but if you have a slower connection you can download this and watch it while you are downloading a higher quality version.  As far as screen size it is 624X352.  Sound is 64bit mp3.  Enjoy"
