,blombardo,2012-02-14T06:10Z,I loved this game - spent countless hours playing it when I should have been working... back around 2001 or so I guess it was.  I wish it worked on 64bit systems - cant even get it working in my xp compatibility mode - guess i'd have to install an emulator.  Will happily pay cash for a functional 64bit version!
