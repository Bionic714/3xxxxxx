Plot: This collaboration between Chang Cheh and swordswoman supreme Cheng Pei Pei is exceptional indeed. Cheng could hold her own with any man, freeing Chang to create the best of all possible martial arts worlds. 
 
Overview: "Godfather of the kung-fu film" Chang Cheh, is famous for introducing the revolutionary concept of "yanggang" (macho) martial arts movies. Until then, female stars (often in male swordsmen roles) ruled the screens. So collaboration between him and swordswoman supreme Cheng Pei-pei (now famous for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is exceptional indeed. Although extremely attractive when she only played heroes, Cheng could hold her own with any man, freeing Chang to create the best of all possible martial arts worlds.
