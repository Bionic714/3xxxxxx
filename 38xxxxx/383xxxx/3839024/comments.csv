,looking54,2007-10-16T04:38Z,"Film descirption:Shot on location at an early-20th-century sanatorium in Kentucky built for victims of the White Plague, this well-crafted indie hits all the right notes of Gothic, macabre terror. For a college initiation rite, five young women must spend five hours in the abandoned hospital--supposedly the most haunted place on Earth--but each floor is menaced by its own specter of the past. The only escape is through the tunnel that long ago was used to dispose of the dead bodies that accumulated in this house of horrors. 

Film Rating 7-10

My Autopsy:This film was nicely directed and shot . The sense of the history of the place was really captured on key areas of investigator interest. The sense of horror was profound to the fact of so many lives was lost to a deadly plague. A unique fiction sub-plot kept the drama going with the charaters to tie them in with the hauntings . I recomend to any who love a scary haunting  . If your a fan of moralist tale from authors like Edgar Alen Poe and Henry P.Lovecraft or who likes scaries such as Silent Hill then this is a horror you must not miss.

Peace to all those that died."
