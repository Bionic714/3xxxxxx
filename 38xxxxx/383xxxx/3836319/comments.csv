Can´t play them with Windows mediaplayer, Divx Player, Real Player-nothing happens...Do you do this easy for ordinary people or not?...Or is this some downloading fun for nerds?"
[T],splattergod,2007-10-13T15:48Z,"Why is it when someone is unfamiliar with a codec or extenstion, they don't simply google the damn thing, instead of whining on comments boards.
The format is flac, which is lossless compression.
In otherwords, better sound quality than a MP3, as there is no information/sound loss.
It can be converted with a free program, Flac Frontend...
Just google for the URL....
This torrent IS set up for ""ordinary people""...
presuming an ""ordinary person"" has an IQ above that of a carrot...
and is not too damn lazy to even look something up on the internet."
,peterbeee49,2007-10-15T00:28Z,"My point was...either you can do a thing simple i.a using a format which you often find here. Or...you can do it difficult by using something many people are not used to. This thing about google something you don´t know about, is really something...wow! Thanks for telling me.
It´s just that it´s beside the point here...(most people with an IQ above a carrot know this)"
,Em3rald,2007-12-24T19:00Z,"The FLAC format is actually a highly respected, lossless compression format that is becoming heavily used in the music industry.  In recent years, the FLAC format has been used extensively by the music sharing community because it offers an ""exact audio copy"" or EAC of the source.  Many media players nowadays automatically support the FLAC format, and/or offer a seamless integration of a method to aquire the appropriate codec.  ; To address peterbeee49 directly: Since this community is peer-driven, and since the files are offered freely by the uploader, it behooves users such as yourself to perhaps use a little more decorum when requesting further information regarding a particular torrent.  I am quite certain that if you had simply asked, ""Hey, this is a format with which I am unfamiliar; can you please elaborate on how I might open these files?"" the original uploader would have quite happily answered your question.  In addition, splattergod had a relatively valid point when suggesting the use of your favorite search engine to find details on the FLAC file format.  His/her tone could have been more polite, but since this entire forum seems devoid of ettiquette anyway, I would say take it with a grain of salt.  ; Finally, to the original uploader:  Thank you for this!  Merry Christmas!"
,peterbeee49,2008-02-11T19:20Z,"My god...another one who still don´t get it.. Easy or difficult - that was the question.
And as for your wonderful piece of advice about how you should adress people here, I suggest you write a book about that. "
,00w00ter,2008-04-17T22:37Z,"Great Upload. Especially the FLAC part.

and for those who are have problems with it 

google ""Convert FLAC to MP3"" ....  

there are tons of free decoders (even some Free Open Source ones too)"
[V],TheExecutive,2008-07-09T04:57Z,"The best method for converting FLAC to Mp3 is to use a free software program called SWITCH.  Drag all of the files into the Switch window and select 320 MB size and High Quality setting.

I'm very much into classic British rock bands that have been around for decades, but The Moody Blues are new to me!  Watching them perform a couple of their biggest hits on the WWOR TV version of The Howard Stern Show from 1990 tonight made me seek out a few torrents starting with this one!"
