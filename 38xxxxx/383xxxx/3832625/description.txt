The first and most extreme of the Ilsa series, Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS is one vicious flick. Dyanne Thorne begins her role as the busty blonde sadist with gusto, the look on her face as she tortures and murders her helpless prisoners is probably what made the Ilsa series so well known. In this one, she?s in charge of a medical experiment camp during World War Two, and her theory is that women can handle pain better than men, so she tortures them to prove it.

Unless you?re a fan of torture or WIP flicks, you should probably skip the other Ilsas if you?re just looking for some shock cinema, this is the one you?re looking for. The other are just Ilsa Lite, hoping to make a buck on the infamy of this one, and at one point actually going for an R rating in a true showing of ignorance.

Ilsa is not torture in the way most fans of Women In Prison flicks might expect. No hoses and beatings with wet towels here. Ilsa is about tearing off toenails, electric dildos, burning magnesium in the hoo-ha, castrations, people strapped down and scourged to death, boiled alive, crushed in a pressurization chamber, and if you see the uncut version, some unexplained operation on a woman?s genitalia while she screams. 

It?s a harsh flick, hard to find amusing. It is filled to the brim with nudity and violence, and the ending is both disturbing and pleasing.
