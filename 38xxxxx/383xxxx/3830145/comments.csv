,bounded,2007-12-18T00:19Z,Why dont you put the original files in a rar or make them directly available? Packing files in an .exe file is suspicious and I cant extract them under my Linux box to run them in dosbox!
,UzY3L,2008-02-15T11:22Z,"I love the uploader!
Damn...I remember playing this way back on my 486 with monochrome display while listening to Limp Bizkit's Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavoured Water on my stereo (what?I barely had enough for a PC back then and there weren't many people who owned one back then).
@ bounded : Dude,did you try WINE? I'm sure there's gotta be an app that can extract the files for you.Or ask a buddy to extract them and give you a copy.The torrent was made with the modern PC in mind.Sadly,not many people are using Linux..."
,jokipoika,2008-03-17T00:10Z,This is so fucking great torrent!! Love the games and love the uploder too! :DD
,Jon2theJon,2009-01-21T03:38Z,"My dad bought these games back in 1994, some pretty good times on our first computer."
,TheDingoTheory,2009-03-19T04:25Z,"It may *look* like a suspicious download, but it's the real deal.

I have a DOS game disc with like 500+ games and Keen 1, 4 and 6 are on it. Thanks for the rest!"
