,crepesdrapes,2007-10-17T16:05Z,Thanks Dino another one to my collection.
,lord_of_war,2007-12-19T04:43Z,this is both well played and well filmed. vibrant dream scape's and bizarre environments make this a must see.
,Draconicus,2008-02-14T07:43Z,Mmm. CD-sized. This one's a keeper. :)
,Panjea23,2008-05-02T23:05Z,"I have to say, J-Lo is  a better actress than ""pop-star"" (maybe only in this film though!). 
Do you recognise the serial killer? He's the same guy who plays the detective in Law & Order: Criminal Intent. And he's the wife-beatin farmer in MenInBlack who gets possessed by an alien at the beginning! Wicked!"
,charliebleu,2008-05-31T17:27Z,"Thanks for the DL.  Disagree with a lot of the comments, as generally I think this is a crap film; BUT.... AWESOME visual imagery.  Derived from modern artists. If you are an aesthetics geek (like me) than this is a must see. Do a wikipedia search if you like the imagery, see where it comes from.  Same guy is supposed to have a new film out this summer... cant remember the title, post if you know?"
