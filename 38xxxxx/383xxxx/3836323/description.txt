As leader of a band called Voodoo Club, vocalist Philip Boa had a long and successful career, though not in the metal world (based on limited reading, it would appear that Voodoo Club was in the pop/techno vein). 

Voodoocult was Boa\\\'s short-lived side project, a chance to explore his metal side. Normally this would be of limited interest to metal fans, were it not for the impressive array of metal all-stars that appeared on his two albums. 

How it was that an album featuring Chuck Schuldiner (Death), Mille Petrozza (Kreator), Dave Lombardo (Slayer), and Waldemar Sorychta (Grip Inc.) didn\\\'t create all kinds of media hype isn\\\'t clear, but nonetheless such an album was released. 

As 1994\\\'s Jesus Killing Machine was followed by Voodoocult in 1996 with a largely different lineup, featuring none of the aforementioned stars but including Jim Martin (ex-Faith No More). The music, at least on Jesus Killing Machine, was an aggressive, post-thrash rhythmic power metal style, certainly not reminding anyone of the member\\\'s other bands. Boa discontinued the project after two albums, returning to his other career at least for some time afterward.
