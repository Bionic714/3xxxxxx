"Love Is", by  "The New Troubadours"

The first 19 songs in this MP3 collection are the original "Love Is" album which was written and recorded at The Findhorn community by "The New Troubadours" in the early 1970's.  The recordings were never commercially published in the usual record contract sense, but were offered through The Findhorn Foundation's bookstore on audio cassette for a number of years before finally disappearing from their catalog.

The 3 additional tracks from a later compilation of Findhorn artist recordings entitled "The Magic Garden" are also included.

This MP3 collection is presented as a preservation gesture and should be considered as "shareware".

If you find this music as spiritually uplifting as I have over the past 32 years, you may wish to contact the Findhorn Foundation directly at the website below.  Findhorn is now a thriving community and instructional center in Scotland, offering a unique mix of self awareness, spiritual, and harmony workshops, as well as books, crafts and music.

Encoding Notes:
Wave files were created from the original analog recordings or Dolby stereo cassettes. 
Normalization was applied, as well a equalization to compensate for high frequency losses.
Variable bit MP3 encoding was done for maximum quality with minimum file size.

Bugs:
Some residual noise and distortion is present from the original analog recordings.
Variable bit MP3 files can sometimes report incorrect track times on early model-version players.
