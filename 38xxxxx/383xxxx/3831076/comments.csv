are you still seeding this? My mom still has the audio tapes bought in the 70s. They're very worn out now and incidently she asked my yesterday to check if ""Love Is"" and ""Homeland"" have appeared on CD. 

Thanks for uploading this."
,SAI_Archives,2008-02-03T20:11Z,Thank you for your interest.  Yes I still actively seed this usually 16 hours a day mostly although I sometimes will be down a few days every now and then when my ISP is being touchy.  If you keep your torrent client open for the download it will eventually complete :)

I started downloading your file, but it seems to be an error in the downloading. IÂ´d love to give my husband the surprise of listening to all the songs again. TheyÂ´re very inspiring!  Any ideas why this error message appears? Thanks, Patricia"
