,Borsche,2007-10-11T17:19Z,This IS NOT season 4 episode 3 you fucktard. It is season 3 episode 15. LOOK IT UP on the net before you open your retarded mouth.
,Cryx,2007-10-11T17:52Z,Well it is still the newest episode that's out there so why even argue?
,TheAngelMike,2007-10-11T21:41Z,"Don't bother talking to Snakekilla.
He/she is going to say its season six for rest of the season.
Just see EP15 he/she does same thing.
They prolly said they where SHOOTING season six, wich is about right.
But it will air in 2008!"
,TheAngelMike,2007-10-11T21:43Z,"Wait i made a boo boo here now.
Cus last time he said season blablabla.
first all i meant to say season 4 dunno why i said six tho annyway hes wrong!
second, i think hes sayin now its the wrong eppisode.
Seeing how last time no one complained about redhotpokers ep15 this prolly wil be the right one!"
