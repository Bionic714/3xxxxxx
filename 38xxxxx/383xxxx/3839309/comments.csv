,heavy65gm,2008-12-14T13:33Z,"Hi everyone, please can someone seed or re-seed this torrent, I have 87,6% downloaded"
,robdave,2011-02-26T23:49Z,"It's Feb 2011 now. I've been stuck at 88.8% downloaded for over a week, as have all other downloaders. There are no seeders currently, so not worth downloading. Cheers."
