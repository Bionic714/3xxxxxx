[T],Neiviesis1919,2009-11-14T20:59Z,"-Quality def not shit, poor maybe. I had to covert/shrink some of my albums to fit on my old iPod.

-My bad for not listing bitrate, its just i have uploaded alot and going threw it all is just too much work. Use your judgements thought, 53 MB for 20 tracks? Give you a clue of the quality. 

To my ears i think the quality is about 5/6 out of 10. Def listenable, and quality is more like a 7-8 will a little help from an EQ.

-Neway than for all the comments, positive or negitive is fine just no online bickering ive seen in some of my other uploads.

  Peace,
