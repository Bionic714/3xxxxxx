The word for graffiti in Japan is rakugaki, but its street pronunciation is rackgaki, punning on the American graffiti term for â??rackingâ?? spray cans. RackGaki showcases the creativity that lies within this new and relatively unexplored form of contemporary Japanese art. Interviews with the â??writersâ?? and the authorsâ?? own experiences in documenting the different aspects of this subculture, fill out a picture of an art form at the cutting edge and often at odds with police and civic authorities.
