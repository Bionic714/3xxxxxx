,madmax999,2007-10-13T18:52Z,"Thank you for the comments.
Velvetfog,
You have helped alot with my getting better settings in my torrent file.  Many thanks.

Fardur,
I've seen these suggestions on other user's posting.  Maybe you have some suggestions.  Most of the things I post here come from eDonkey because I don't find the files here.  So the specs are not really part of the file.  Is there a way to get the specs from just the file itsself?"
,madmax999,2007-10-13T19:05Z,"ok, lol, duhhhhhh.  Right click, chose Properties"
,madmax999,2007-10-13T22:59Z,"Great.  I'm all Windows so gspot will probably be the ticket.

I'm trying to keep 4 or 5 of my items seeding at a time.  I've been dropping the ones that get to 10 or so people seeding and adding one of my new ones.  Does it make sense to do it that way?  In the off hours 7pm - 7am I pretty much like to let the dual T1s run full out with more priority on seeding than downloading.  It seems to me that running at higher speeds is more important than running a lot of torrents at low speed or where a lot of people have a complete copy and are now seeding too.  Right?"

I have not founded this film on PirateBay, but one may found it on russian tracker Torrents.ru (search for ??????? ????)"
,madmax999,2008-03-02T15:48Z,"I've tried to find Planet of Storms. No joy. Sorry.  If I come across it, I will post it."
,madmax999,2008-03-31T04:00Z,"Found Planet of Storms. I won't know about subs or audio streams but there were three different files so I'm dl'ing all of them. I'll know in 2-3 weeks (maybe less, one has 32)"
,madmax999,2008-04-20T17:21Z,"Once again, no joy. All were in the original Russian.  If someone wants it let me know and I will post it for a while."
,martsego,2008-09-07T20:20Z,"COULD YOU PLEASE SEED THIS FILM? IT STOPPED AT 42%, THANKS."
,madmax999,2008-09-19T06:29Z,You should be ok now.  I put it online about 4 hours ago.  May take a while since a lot of people are catching up on the partials.  It is queued to seed so it will eventually hit.  Sorry for the lapse.
