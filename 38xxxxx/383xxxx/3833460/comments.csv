It's pathetic to me how people can't see the beauty and righteousness  of God and His only begotten Son. If you refuse to repent and see the error of your ways then you will surely and justly be cast into the fiery pit of Hell by God. He is correct in all things and the mere idea of questioning His will is unspeakable heresy. Heresy that you will all surely burn for."

kcsx, if you refuse the accept reason, and see the error of your ways then you will have wasted your life worshiping an imaginary friend. I thought people stopped using the word heresy a long time ago. How do you know that Muslims aren't right? Then we'll be seeing each other in hell. Now tell me, how does it feel to be told that you're going to hell? Probably a lot worse than it makes me feel since I believe in no such place."

We atheists love to be disproven because it is then apparent that we are learning more. Knowledge is growing and that is a good thing!

However, you are so quick to chastise us. You know what the difference between Evolution and Creationism is? Evolution is based off of what we see and we draw conclusions of how we came into being. Creationism is based off of a fictional book written about 2 millennia. You might say, but that book was given to us from God. Really I hate to break it to you, but it was written by man. It might have been ""divinely"" written but it was still written by man. I guess to put it into the Christian teachings, ""Man will let you down."" In your view, man has sinned and therefore you cannot trust man. However you Christians seem to do... just... that...

You seem to say that Evolution is disproven and has already been shattered, but can you really prove Creationism? Try as you might... but Noah's flood did not  extinct the dinosaurs. "

""His will is unspeakable heresy. Heresy that you will all surely burn for.""

Because creationists have no actual rational, they have to resort to threats without evidence.

=========================
D-Technic2000 
I have no idea why I am doing this as you are obviously mentally damaged, but I am going to argue your point.  

The big bang was not a FIRE.  The big bang is one theory about what happened very shortly after the start of the Universe.  It explains how all known matter and energy seems to have originated from a single point.  The theory, being scientific is based on FACT, which does not mean it must be right but only that unlike most elements of religion has some foundation in observed nature.  If you would like to learn something, then look up about red-shift and how it relates to the big bang.

As scientists or simply as a rational thinker, we do not claim to know everything.  Infact quite the opposite.  The universe is an incredible place (the only one I know of) with scales both larger and smaller than we as humans are equipped to properly appreciate.  The big bang theory may well be wrong, although I personally doubt it.  Lets just argue that the big bang happened, what was there before?  Nothing? Who knows ? it is not the point.  The belief in a god does not answer this question as it still leaves you the problem in explaining the beginning of his/her/its existence.  If you can believe that god created itself, then why not the universe?

However, look at what we have here:
 ?If you don't, you will cry blood in that awsome day, when we realize who, & how powerful GOD is.?
 another threat.  Why if gods argument was so obviously true would such server threats be necessary?  Why would a loving god punish anybody anyway?  Surely the problematic rational few could just be picked off to die and not be tortured for eternity?"

A religion is a set of beliefs and practices generally organized around supernatural and moral claims, and often codified as prayer, ritual, and religious law.

We dont believe in the supernatural, other than the amazing abilites of Chuck Norris ;)

I do however have very strong beliefs.  Most people seem to think that as an athiest I do not have beliefes.  However I have a very stong set of beliefs in the non-existance of god, the (relative) purpose of life and a strong moral code.  In that respect, you may categorise it as a *belief*"

How does it come that more than a full page of this torrent's comments are filled with so called ""anti-creationists"" trying to out whit each other? :)
Don't ya all agree with each other? Or could it be that you are so afraid of the so called ""creationists"" way of thinking, that you have to post all of these overwritten comments just so that nobody could possibly believe that anyone but you are the smartest?

Makes me wonder... If the ""theory of God"" is soooo stupid as you make it look (or at least tries to) why not let them speak? A ""scientist or simply a rational thinker"" (as pbay4everskeefmail.com put it) cant belive that nonsense anyways huh?

However I dont mean to step on anybodys toes here but, wouldnt a REAL debate be a better way to make your ""belief"" (everyone be the judges if it is one or not) heard by the people.... because you want to spread your so called ""facts"" do you not? That is indeed why these videos exsist isn't it?

So take a little plunge into the thinking well wont ya all ""Dawkins-ists"" (a joke) before you start overposting ""facts"" about a theory (yes that's what it is...not PROVEN to be true by anyone, just as the ""God-theory"") on a torrent comment-page...

Just people responding to other people's comments.  I'm sure pirate bay's servers can afford the 40k of space that a thread like this takes up. And this is a community, where the free exchange of ideas is welcome, is it not? 
'Don't ya all agree with each other?' Apparently not, as the torrent has attracted some Christians who are willing to hear the other side of the ""debate"". 'why not let them speak?' They have been allowed to speak, and people have responded to them. No censorship here as far as I can tell.
'And you sure put effort into making it sound stupid so there shouldnt be a problem, people shouldnt believe in it...its not...rational...(?)' Too true. But unfortunately some do believe in it, and the record needs to be set straight, misinformation corrected. The Earth is not 6000 years old, and evidence from many different fields points to life evolving from a common ancestor. 
'a theory...not PROVEN to be true by anyone' Evolution is well-supported, and is the basis of all biology, gives rise to myriad practical applications and has provided insight in fields such as psychology, engineering, even astrophysics. Can the same be said for Creationism or Intelligent Design?
'find another place to went your ideas about life than here...' Well, we just happened to have met here, but if you would like to go to another forum, just let me know. Here seems to be as good a place as any.

For the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many (Matthew Chapter 7)

And even though our gospel is veiled, it is veiled for those who are perishing, in whose case Satan has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they may not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. (2 Corinthians 4)

It is such opinions that increase my faith in the Bible. The Bible is right after all. Satan's main aim is to deny the Christ and for that he is prepared to do anything. The father of lies Satan just wants Christ out of your life using any method possible. Even if that includes making people think that there is no God or inciting Muslims to kill unbelievers by promising them sex bombs and rivers of wine in heaven or slowly replacing Jesus with Mary in worship and kicking Jesus out of Catholicism. Be careful of Satan & his way. He is out to get you. He does not want your money, not your wealth, not your fame....he just wants your soul. And he won't rest till he has got it.

You migtht think that denying God and living like animals with addictions to drugs, pornography, sex and violence is life. But that is precisely the script that Satan writes. You are just the actor, he is the director.
