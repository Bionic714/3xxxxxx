,neze83,2007-10-20T17:54Z,working fine Thanks
,Booga23,2007-10-23T23:27Z,"The instructions are confusing to say the least.
Anyone fancy writing an idiots guide. This is going on a 32 bit pc."
,dianthos,2007-11-13T05:55Z,"Thnx BD1965 Installation method worked perfectly though I had to redownload acad 64 torrent since winrar file was corrupted.

To reinstall acad 2008 on X32 machine after lincense has been exported delete the license file for Acad. you can then reuse the keygen again.

License file will be a .dat file in c:\program data\autodesk\software licenses

You will have to allow to show hidden files"
,The-Bluetic,2007-12-03T22:29Z,"Worked great for me. 
Thanks ""BD1965"""
,Quirky_Puppy,2007-12-06T22:22Z,Has anyone successfully installed this on vista64?
,honkeydick69,2007-12-07T13:25Z,"I can't even get this to install on Vista 64... It installs all the crap (flash, win media), but when it goes to actually install AutoCad it says:  Please insert disk: DISK

Anyone know why this is happening??????"
,BEHMER,2007-12-22T01:11Z,AutoCAD 2008 is not even done yet.  There are still major changes and fixes going in everyday.  Its not even being released till March.  How complete does this seem to you guys?
,we.are.synthetic,2007-12-27T04:11Z,"Mine also fails installation halfway through install and says ""Please Enter Disc 1"".  Its on a Vista x86 system."
,Drendir,2007-12-31T13:19Z,"Hi, concerning your question about ""insert disk"" error, all you have to do when installing AutoCAD2008 is first boot the iso or whatever with Magicdisk for example, thats what i'm using, after that you go to the virtual CDROM and copy all the files to a folder on your desktop. Then you INSTALL IT FROM YOUR HARDDISK, and it works perfectly.

You may find the same problem for Photoshop CS 3 for example, why? do not ask? how i found this? by stupid accident.

enjoy"
,jwright8604,2008-02-02T20:48Z,Where can I find the serial number or the group ID that it keeps asking for?
,SolidHelix,2008-02-08T14:55Z,"IT STILL SAYS INSERT DISK-1 EVEN WHEN INSTALLING FROM HARD DISK, VIRTUAL CD-ROM, OR EVEN WHEN IT""S BURNED OFF unless someone can explain a fix for this do NOT download this"
,Quirky_Puppy,2008-02-19T19:06Z,"Can't get this working. It installs fine but the serial numbers provided in the .txt file don't work. And yes, I AM following the instructions and doing it on a 32bit system so I can export the licence.

Anyone help with this please?"
,Quirky_Puppy,2008-02-21T21:17Z,"Ok, scratch my last comment, I was being retarded. The licencing proceedure requires you to follow the instructions precisely. The numbers provided go in the ""serial number"" bit at the top. DO NOT CLICK PROCCEED TILL YOU'VE PASTE THE REQUEST CODE INTO THE KEYGEN AND PUT THE ACTIVATION CODE IN."
,Quirky_Puppy,2008-02-21T21:18Z,"

I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN:-

THIS WORKS FINE.

,otrocarlosmas,2008-12-15T02:25Z,"This works great but hers some info you need , in order  open the file use win.rar  .The activation code in the how to install file is really the serial number  and the real activation code  comes from the crack.   NOTE VERY IMPORTANT!! YOUR INTERNET MUST BE DISABLE AT TIME OF ACTIVATION!!   OR THE SOFTWARE WILL CONTACT  THE COMPANY AND  SEE THE SERIAL IN NOT VALID!!!!  "
,eglj,2008-12-28T07:30Z,"Thank you VERY much for the download! Works GREAT! on XP 32 bit.  Post from ""otrocarlosmas"" was correct re: activation vs serial #, his added comments were solid."

,rosco_balboa,2010-03-20T20:37Z,"Great download all you have to do is follow the instructions in the install file,easy peasy"
,baldmosher,2010-06-02T22:36Z,"I eventually managed to get this working (Windows 7 x64) by copying all files from the ISO to a folder on the Desktop and renaming the folder DISK, as jashan suggested.

Keygen on x32 works a treat if you follow the instructions to the letter.  I also disconnected from the internet to register, just in case, but I don't think it's necessary if you follow the instructions.

Make a System Restore point immediately after registering x32 if you're porting to x64, if you need to restore the x32 licence (I needed to set up x64 on main PC and x32 on laptop).

Awesome, thanks guys."
