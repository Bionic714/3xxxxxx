Comments:
This is an EP plus four songs from their Hat Head 1990 cassette-only release. It's much lower-key than Shimmer, and perhaps not quite as compelling, but you will still like this if you're a fan of their other work. It's wonderful music to lose yourself in. "Country Death Song" is great fun, and the four songs included from Hat Head make me wish that were available on disc. (Neile)
It is a little more up-beat than Shimmer. The remix of "Flowers", called "Flowerbox", reminds me of music by Single Gun Theory. (sae@clas.suffolk.edu)
