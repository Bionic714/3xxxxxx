Btw, I like 666 better."

160kps is not ""Good Quality"" that is fucking awful quality to be honest.
I appreciate the upload, but c'mon, 160?"
,Axisround,2008-12-31T06:27Z,"@ STGstylah:

Still feel the same now? Well over 1 year and I haven't seeded since the first day. How are your torrents doing? Mainly stagnated music rips."

No they don't.
There was one zip file, no password needed.

""Full Album? Where are the CD2? ""
I assume by CD2 you mean the bonus disc.
This disc was released later, and therefore is not actually part of the Full Studio Album.

""Ok:
160kps is not ""Good Quality"" that is fucking awful quality to be honest.

160kbps is perfectly good quality.
If it's encoded well, 160 will sound fine.
There isn't a huge different between 160 and 320 (except file size) if it's encoded well.

If you really want great quality (and actually have the equipment to play it properly, on most people's speakers/headphones/etc you won't be able to tell the difference), then get lossless stuff.

Just my opinion on a 5 year old torrent.
DL speed was good.
Great album.
Thanks"
