Overview: Set in the early 20th century, the plot involves corrupt military men and civil war and is all shot on Shaw Bros. studio sets. One of the Venom characters gets killed halfway through the film, so the other four plan an elaborate sting operation to get revenge. They use the dead man's money and bankbook to put one over on General Han by making Lu Feng out to be some top official's son. They claim they've got weapons to sell to the general, but all they have to show are a machine gun and two pistols, which were actually lifted by the boys from an armory in an abortive robbery attempt. At some point the general's men receive the robbery report and put two and two together.
