,420dopeman,2007-10-09T15:40Z,"Most likely those blocks are due to open ports on your pc, such as plug-n-play. Some have chosen to remove those block ranges form the ziptorrent list, however, there's no need to, and no need to worry.

Klickar på udate & inget händer.
Någon som vet vad detta fel beror på?
Jag kör Win XP Pro x64

When i followed all instructions until install patch & the run it i recieve a wrong parameter error & when i click ok it takes me to the update window, but nothing happens when i click the update button.
Anyone know why?
