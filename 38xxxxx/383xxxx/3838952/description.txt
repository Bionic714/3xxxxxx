This all to obscure 1974 X-rated thriller offers by far one one Harry Reems finest performances. Originally screened in US theatres in and around the New York area (where the film was shot), under the title The Night Walker, it was soon retitled Sex Wish, in order to cash in on the nasty Charles Bronson rape film, Death Wish. 

After his girlfriend is savagely raped and murdered (with a sword no less), distraught boyfriend Harry Reems goes on a daunting quest to find the killer (Zeedy Colt) and bring him to justice... Meanwhile, a detective (future sex film star Richard Bolla in an early role) is also on the hunt, that is until another girl is killed. 

Sex Wish is not the most technically proficient film ever made, for in places the camera-work is a bit shoddy, as is some of the acting from the supporting players. Nevertheless, the movie holds ones interest from beginning to end, and that is sadly rare in the world of hardcore cinema. Although it has been (undeservedly) scrutinized for its graphic depictions of rape and murder, one must not overlook the fact that neither rape nor murder are condoned or sanctioned by any of the characters, nor are these things looked at as a normal part of sex. In fact, those looking for a pyre turn-on film need look elsewhere, for this film is just as un-erotic as a film can get. On the other hand, if one is trying to find a good combination of graphic sex, violence and story, this one is a sure bet.
