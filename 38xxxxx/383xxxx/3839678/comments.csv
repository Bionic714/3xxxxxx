,gunslinger69,2008-01-24T22:26Z,jerk. why in wav?
,slick420,2008-06-16T02:53Z,no need to call him a jerk just dl and convert to mp3 or whatever format you like
,Beno_zeno,2008-06-22T16:33Z,"because Wav and aiff are the the only two formats that aren't encoded. mp3 and all other formats sucks by te way, and mp3 is the worst and mpeg layer2 and flac are the bestof the worst"

,hiura,2009-05-16T22:30Z,600 mb to 20 musics is so much! 
,jblandrum,2009-12-05T20:26Z,"""... and flac are the best of the worst.""

I'm pretty sure just about any intelligent life form would disagree.
Lossless is loss less. While I've no complaints w/ sharing anything from WAV to MIDI to imply that wasting space, when you can do away with nearly 1/2 the space taken by using FLAC or other -lossless- forms of storage, is the way to go... well that's just silly.

Thanks for this album."

,crosswriter,2011-04-19T01:57Z,"It is in Wave format, but look up a converter on google it took me 5 min to change the format, so stop being ungrateful people! Thank you for a great torrent :) keep up the good work"
,emynor,2011-11-10T12:12Z,WAV is THE perfect format from which to burn CDs so THANKS verily butterballs2! Cannot find my CD or cassette of this and appreciate the high fidelity of WAV. It's absolutely NO problem converting to 320 kbps MP3 from WAV either! Thanks again!
