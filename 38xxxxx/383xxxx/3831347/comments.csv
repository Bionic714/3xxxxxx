,holmpet,2007-10-25T17:50Z,"Very nice torrent
Thanks a bunch ^^"
,piratailin,2007-11-06T11:44Z,"These tracks apparently came from various sources, ala limewire, as they have different bitrates. I saw 192, 256, and 320 Kb/s and I only d/l'd two of the records. Still it is nice to have them all in one place."
,lalakoala,2007-11-07T15:37Z,"Hy piratailin,
You're absolutly right but i already said so in the info as you can read on this page..
Got the files from torrents and slsk and added the missing covers.. (limewire sucks btw)
The bitrate isn't the same on every album but the sound quality is good enough for most people i think.."
