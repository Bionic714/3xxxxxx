Havent played around that much with steam but from what ive heard even if you try play singleplayer it will connect to steam update.

,xiIix,2007-10-13T08:02Z,I wouldn't download anything without a crack included anyway. I'd rather download the other releases that are simply unpack and play.

,lakers4eva,2007-10-13T11:05Z,"Does this include Lost Coast? Anyone can explain in a few words what is Lost Coast? I did play Half Life2 but never tried Lost Coast, as i understand is just one map. How do you play it? Is it somewhere in the gameplay of HL2?"
,huldu,2007-10-13T14:29Z,"Just 1 seeder and i cant connect to it lol. Doesnt seem like theres many who can connect to it either. Atm its around 28.1% or something and really, really slow. Probably the seeder on some crazy slow speed or somethng like that.."
,huldu,2007-10-13T14:30Z,"Its *very* easy to nosteam any valve release. Just use your brain for 2 seconds and check on google how to do it. I wouldnt trust .exe cracks however cause the ""cracking"" of steam is far more complicated than that."

You clusterfucked peckerface, u dont need to be a rocket scientist to look at the ""included"" file from where the torrent was orginially downloaded from, and there search for it.

if you would have done that, you would have known, that as for now, there is no crack nor key since this is the RETAIL version, and since it uses Steam, you WOULD need a valid CD-key in order to NOT crack.

Now, can you please be so kind and wear that asshat you so kindly called Murlok ?

when I enter hl2.exe nothing happens :P
HEEELP please
sorry my english, i'm brazilian"
[V],Murlok,2007-11-06T12:05Z,"1. Make a folder on your desktop and name it ""OB""
2. Extract BOTH discs into your newly-made ""OB"" folder
3. Download AlluNeed.zip from: http://filebeam.com/b5c18029d79f49492412be1b2776fb7d
4. Extract the contents of ""SIMPACK_15"" into your ""OB"" folder
5. Extract ""TOB.bat"" into your ""OB"" folder
6. Now run TOB.bat from inside your ""OB"" folder. Relax, grab a drink, this will take a while.
7. Once it's done, you should have a folder (OrangeBox) with a lot of files in: ""C:\Games\OrangeBox""
8. Now back to the ""AlluNeed.zip"" you downloaded, you'll see a folder named ""OrangeBox"" in there.
9. Extract all the .BATs, Steam.dll, and hl2.exe into ""C:\Games\OrangeBox""
10. Extract the 4 .dlls in the ""bin"" folder to ""C:\Games\OrangeBox\bin""
11. Finally, go into the ""ep2"" folder. you'll see a ""bin"" folder and ""cfg"" folder
12. Extract the files in each folder to their corresponding folders in ""C:\Games\OrangeBox\ep2""
13. Do the same for the other 4 games' folders. (named ""hl2"", ""episodic"", ""portal"", and ""tf"")
14. You're done with the AlluNeed.zip. YAY.
15. Back in your game's main folder ""C:\Games\OrangeBox"", each of the .BATs (""Episode 2.BAT"", ""Portal.BAT"", ""HL2.BAT"", ""Team Fortress.BAT"", and ""Episode 1.BAT"") is a shortcut to the game. Run a .BAT to play each game.
16. ENJOY!!
If all went well, you can also go ahead and delete the ""OB"" folder from your desktop, since you won't need it anymore. 

 only thing i will say to anyone who still cant do it follow this but extract simpack & tob to Orange Box inside ob folder and run it from there"

And btw my alluneed.zip only includes the ep2 folder    (along with the bin folder, Episode 1.bat, Episode 2.bat, HL2.bat, hl2.exe, Portal.bat, Steam.dll & Team Fortress.bat)

So when u say:

13. Do the same for the other 4 games' folders. (named ""hl2"", ""episodic"", ""portal"", and ""tf"")

Thx for the great torrent, 
Will seed for a couple of weeks cos it took me 3 weeks to get it myself ;)"
,torrentgodZ,2007-12-12T10:22Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. NOT WORKING.

Despite what the torrent uploader might like you to believe, his torrent does not work properly, and it is very unreliable when it comes to working.  so far I know of no one who has gotten his torrent to work.  

To the uploader; could you make the install any longer?  do you even know anything about making a torrent?  Apparently not.  You could of put all of those steps into one .bat file and it would have done everything.  even afterwards, doing everything correctly, it is a joke, it doesn't work. 

 I've tried every fix, but there ARE missing files, you can't even run the games properly after install, and there is still the AI DISABLED that is not able to be fixed by any means found on the internet. so obviously I can't do anything if I don't have the entire game.  If it wasn't extracted, it was no fault of my own. I followed every step on every page to the letter, and still nothing working properly, still no AI, missing scenes, etc.  Now if the files are there somewhere, you should point out where they are and how to get them.  

You may think it is cool to upload a popular anticipated torrent, free of charge to everyone who wants it, but you are not cool.  because your torrent is a lemon, it is broken, it does not work, so it might as well be episodes of barney or nothing at all.  This torrent is utterly and fully, USELESS in every way.  

The only thing your crappy torrent has accomplished is making people waste bandwidth on it, only to have 7.81GB of useless data."

,kratosmaster,2007-12-30T11:35Z,"I haven't downloaded this torrent and never will, because your solution to a problem (as incoherent as it is) is to look at Google, which is a paradox in itself, because are you referring to the website Google, which is in all technicality text and coding, or the number ""google"", which in fact is a number, or at the Google sign in front of the Google headquarters?  In any case, you suck."
,Ukarion,2008-01-05T01:06Z,"Ok for all you stupid mother fuckers that are Saying ""Dont download"" or ""Not working"" How about you fuckin read the comment that are being posted! well this game for me Worked i followed what Murlok wrote:

 Murlok at 2007-11-06 12:05 CET:
1. Make a folder on your desktop and name it ""OB""
2. Extract BOTH discs into your newly-made ""OB"" folder
3. Download AlluNeed.zip from: http://filebeam.com/b5c18029d79f49492412be1b2776fb7d
4. Extract the contents of ""SIMPACK_15"" into your ""OB"" folder
5. Extract ""TOB.bat"" into your ""OB"" folder
6. Now run TOB.bat from inside your ""OB"" folder. Relax, grab a drink, this will take a while.
7. Once it's done, you should have a folder (OrangeBox) with a lot of files in: ""C:\Games\OrangeBox""
8. Now back to the ""AlluNeed.zip"" you downloaded, you'll see a folder named ""OrangeBox"" in there.
9. Extract all the .BATs, Steam.dll, and hl2.exe into ""C:\Games\OrangeBox""
10. Extract the 4 .dlls in the ""bin"" folder to ""C:\Games\OrangeBox\bin""
11. Finally, go into the ""ep2"" folder. you'll see a ""bin"" folder and ""cfg"" folder
12. Extract the files in each folder to their corresponding folders in ""C:\Games\OrangeBox\ep2""
13. Do the same for the other 4 games' folders. (named ""hl2"", ""episodic"", ""portal"", and ""tf"")
14. You're done with the AlluNeed.zip. YAY.
15. Back in your game's main folder ""C:\Games\OrangeBox"", each of the .BATs (""Episode 2.BAT"", ""Portal.BAT"", ""HL2.BAT"", ""Team Fortress.BAT"", and ""Episode 1.BAT"") is a shortcut to the game. Run a .BAT to play each game.
16. ENJOY!!
If all went well, you can also go ahead and delete the ""OB"" folder from your desktop, since you won't need it anymore.

only thing i will say to anyone who still cant do it follow this but extract simpack & tob to Orange Box inside ob folder and run it from there

I came up with a solution. After you reach the tunnel place, go into the console (you must enable this in Options>Keyboard>Advanced) with the '~' key. Then type 'sv_cheats 1', and then 'noclip'. After this, you should be able to get through the tunnel. If it freezes while going through, just fly out of the tunnel and go to the next room. Afterwards, go into console and type 'noclip' again so you stop flying."

,JohnPlayer,2008-02-20T10:27Z,"I've done all the instructions without success. I'll summarize the problems I've found:

1. While installing (using tob.bat): ZLib returned error code -3 while trying to extract file 441.
2. HL2 crashes immediately after the intro. (The error was something like could not load engine)
3. The portal - the same problem.
4. Team fortress: error: ""Setup file gameinfo.txt does not exist in subdirectory tf....""
5. Episode 2 crashes episodically.

Probably the big problem is the extraction of file 441 in the beginning."
