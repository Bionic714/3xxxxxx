Set in a post-apocalyptic 2131 A.D.A.D., girl mercenary Deunen Knute finds herself spirited away from the badlands to the gleaming utopian city of Olympus. There she's reunited with her ex-b.f. Briareos, now half-man, half-cyborg. Deunen learns from new handler Hitomi that Olympus' serenity is founded on the use of bioroids, genetically engineered clones who hold key positions in the city's government. Hitomi herself is one. Superpowerful computer Gaia monitors all, through the mediation of seven Yoda-esque elders. When a shadowy faction opposed to the bioroids' civic control start blowing stuff up, Deunen and Briareos team up to protect the city.
