Also, idk what ""720x"" is supposed to be, but this is basically in PAL format. 720p (if that is what the upper is getting at) would have a height of 720, not a width, which is what this has.

Otherwise, decent rip, though it wouldn't surprise me if this wasn't DVD, and actually from SDTV or something.

,oggologgo,2008-09-14T22:49Z,"Complete crap quality.

Sound is horrible and movie is cropped to 4:3

Not worth downloading or watching. Get a proper version instead.

The person who made it should stop ripping movies. He sucks."
