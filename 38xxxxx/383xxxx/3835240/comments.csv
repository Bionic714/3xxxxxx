but watching the videos is a real pain. the framerate is very low.... u hardly see any flow, just static images like every 10 seconds. is this how u intended it to be? or is there a special player that will play it better? i have tried it with windows media player 11, vlc, alshow, powerdvd etc, so far only poerdvd and wmp11 works. is there  a special codec? thanks."
,google_video04,2007-11-13T23:24Z,"Hi robalapache, the flow of images is how it intended to be (made by screen shoot) and to my point of view it help to see clearly the essential. The video Codec found with GSpot v2.1 is CRAM/MSVC by Microsoft Video 1 with 2 FPS and aspect of 1020 x 732. I use Windows Media Player 9.0 and it play well. I took that video from the URL show in the description, i don't know who is the author of that video but it's a very nice videos to learn the basic of Autocad 2006."
