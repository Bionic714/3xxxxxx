,Corpus,2007-10-23T13:02Z,lol..so is a patch coming out or not?
,kaZmur,2007-10-24T13:04Z,"Greetings Again,

The save problem is causing us quite a bit of confusion here at GameMill. We
cannot seem to be able to duplicate the problem. It seems like it may be
some sort of isolated issue. In an attempt to fix this problem, could you
please help us out? We are simply looking for your computer systems
specifications. These can be found by going to the control panel and
clicking on ""System."" Thanks for your cooperation. It will help us fix this
issue.

Best, 

GameMill"
