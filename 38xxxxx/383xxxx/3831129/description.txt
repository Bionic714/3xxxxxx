Marion Zimmer Bradley - The Forest House Unabridged Audio Book

This is one of four books in Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series.

Encoding Notes:
The Original 2-channel mono cassettes were transfered to Wave files.  Either the left or right track was selected (based on quality) for the mono master.  Normalization was applied. Variable bit MP3 encoding was done for maximum quality with minimum file size.

Bugs:
Variable bit MP3 files can sometimes report incorrect track times on early model-version players.
