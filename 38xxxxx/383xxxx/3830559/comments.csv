,jerkie-toni,2007-12-04T18:37Z,Turtle. When you have downloaded the game you need Daemon tools which u can get free on internet. Then you mount the image with it and install and you're ready to play :)

,Evil Bastardo,2008-03-29T19:56Z,"Get the program BitTorrent, from www.bittorrent.com, for free and install.
Double click on the .torrent file to load it into the program, then start it to get file downloading.

Use WinRAR (get it from this site and download with above program) to unpack the archive.

Use PowerISO (get torrent from this site and download with above program) to open/mount/burn the image file.

See www.gamecopyworld.com for more info, look on right on mainpage under main for newbie hints."
