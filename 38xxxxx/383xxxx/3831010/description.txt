Release Notes 
Brain Damage - Waiting For My Angel CD
Brain Damage is Vik Shagal, born in Ukrain,
and is currently living in Kiryat Gat, Israel
(South).
From a tender age Vik was a music junky,
breathing and embracing all forms of sound.
In the early 90's he started focusing on
electronic based music and begun his romance
with the computer.
Brain Damage's music was already featured on
a handful of solid and stable labels from
around the world.
Waiting For My Angel CD includes 9 previously
unreleased tracks, including 2 collaboration
tracks, one with Spade and the other with
Feedback.
Brain Damage's unique blend of flavors and
colors is not something obvious nor common,
seemingly incorporating deep hypnotic
atmospheres, high dose of emotion, yet
resulting with a strong powerful lift for the
dance floor.
Touching the hearts of both Progressive
Trance and Full on lovers, with no doubt a
name to follow
