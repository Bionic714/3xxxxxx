Classic Joan Jett and the Blackhearts from 1988 - Em Tee Vee back when they still played music videos.  Dig the boots and the feathered mullets!  Aw man, hairstyles are so boring these days unless you\\\\\\\'re a J-rocker.  Hey, speakin\\\\\\\' of J-rockers, if I had a nickel for every internets kiddie who thinks JJ is a male J-rocker, I wouldn\\\\\\\'t have to borrow ten bucks from my old man I tellya.

Rock and roll!  Share and seed!
