,Ubehage,2007-10-10T15:46Z,"Will run on 500 MHz ?

Even XP is a piece of cracp when you try to run it on such a slow machine..."
,ratn9ne,2007-10-11T06:06Z,Tell me if anything in this doesnt work so i can fix it before like 90000 people take it
,swa2007,2007-10-11T20:37Z,"Ok spent a fair time trying to get this to work. Downloads fine. Burns to CD fine. No errors viruses etc found. Tried to install on a P3 800mhz 128mb. Got install errors. Stuck another 128mb stick in and got onto install screen ok only to be told that this install needs a minimum of 512mb to install. So the bottom line is that it probably will work on a 500mhz pc but you will need at least 512mb ram. Chances are that your low-end pc won't be able to take that much, I know mine won't run on more than 128mb. Hope this helps you all!"

,swa2007,2007-10-12T17:43Z,-- lazlob -- try wiping the hd first using copywipe or something similar. http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/copywipe.php
,Ubehage,2007-10-14T20:24Z,"Works like a charm for me :)

I got a real crappy 1.6GHz machine. And it IS really crappy!! Old and stuff..
I run XP on that machine, and inside that XP I installed a Virtual Machine with 512 ram.

This Vista will run - even tho, I wouldn't say it runs smoothly...

Thanks for the nice upload!"
