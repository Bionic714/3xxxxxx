,pro5,2008-05-18T23:29Z,The problem is fixed by patching the game to version 1.05. Both the patch and no-cd compatible with it can be googled.
,*Wizard*,2008-06-04T06:29Z,"Thanks very much elements ;)

This iso is problem free and installed perfectly.

Ran the 1.05 patch and then pasted the no-cd exe and all is great!"
