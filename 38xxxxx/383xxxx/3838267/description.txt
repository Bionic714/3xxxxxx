The Alphabet of Pop is an MP3 collection built up over 50 years, from the Dusty old 78 RPM platters that broke when you dropped them, to Compact Discs.  I have no hesitation in sharing them, for most have been purchased 4 times over as formats moved on from 78 to Micro groove, from Reel to Reel and Cassette Tapes to Mini Disc, CD and Now DVD and Blue Ray.. 

The Music industry has made there money off of this lot a zillion times over, so as far as I am concerned this lot is public Domain.

If the Song was a popular hit between 1908 and 2003 the chances are high it will be in this collection, lovingly brought to you in a series of Bit Torrent downloads, ONE for each letter of the Alphabet.   

Most are sampled at 192Kbs or faster.  Some are very, very rare indeed and based on the UK Hit Parade as published by the BBC over the years.  There may be the odd duplicate or Karaoke version sneak in, sorry about that.   

Rest Assured the MP3 TAGS are just fine, for this is a working collection used every week on a request based Discotheque show.   Enjoy this and please keep it active, for I can NOT release the next letter of the Alphabet, until I am happy this one will live on, seeded without my help.  I only have 140Kb upload speed, so can fast seed just one torrent at a time.

The Author of this lot started as a DJ back in 1967 but had a sizeable music collection even before then.  He still does a weekly request based Audio/Karaoke and Video show using the fantastic OtsAV software (http://www.otsav.com) to this very day.

Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine back in the 70's he could get his entire collection on one single 1.5 TB hard drive and turn up to a gig with little more than a sound system a few LED lights and a laptop computer!  At one time the record collection took up so much room many venue's were just too small for the music to fit!  

From the Difficult Days of the Two World Wars you can relive the jitterbug and roaring twenties, the dark days of the 30's when only the Music and Dance Halls kept you going before you move on to the Birth of Rock and Roll and the Fabulous Fifties, then enjoy the Sensational Sixties & the Offshore Pirate Radio Era, the Glam Rock and the Woodstock Aura of the Seventies, before getting almost up to date with the electronic and Techno of the Eighties and Ninety's, moving on briefly to the Noughties.... The first commercial RAP record is in here someplace, Yes RAP and Hip Hop is OVER 30 years OLD!  (Time to move on Folks? I am SO fed up of Hip Hop and Rap) Most major film sound track hit songs are in this collection as well.

The Author was also a Station Manager of a small Community Radio Project in the remote NE of Scotland and Jingles from that station are included, so if you fancy your hand as a DJ, you will have a collection in a Box so to speak by the time you download this lot.  Sadly I have to go back to Work on a 3 month tour in a weeks time and no more new letters will be posted after the 16th of Oct., so there will be a pause of 3 months before the next letter is seeded, but do not worry, you will get the rest in 2008.   All will come to those who wait!

YOU MUST SEED AT LEAST the same bit count you downloaded, that is a Ratio of ONE TO ONE.  IF YOU love music then keep it seeded, even if you can only give it 10Kb per second of your total upload speed that is better than nothing and these legends of POP and Rock will live on for others like us to ENJOY!!! 

Let the music fill you're soul, for it truly makes the World a better place.  Next part out soon.  (Just as soon as this letter is well seeded, and the torrent can live without me I will get the next part online for you all)
