The fourth song in the list :

might actually be :

,rumpole,2008-11-15T21:30Z,"look, if you use Azereus, I dunno about other clients, you can uncheck the Start Torrents Automatically box in Tools, and then just select the individual files you want. Your client will show 3.74 gb, but if you just selected say 20 songs, it'll be finished in minuteas and then just get the 20 out of the folder. Fuckin world is free, quit bitching and learn how function before you give uploaders shit"
