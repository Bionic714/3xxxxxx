Here is a complete rip of the entire Inconfactory 
(http://iconfactory.com/freeware/desktop) iPhone/iPod touch wallpaper collection 
as of today (05.Oct.07). I will update as needed (send me a PM if I miss it) 
enjoy. Alright for anyone paying attention you will see a ton of empty folders I 
couldn't figure out a way to quickly and cleanly clear those out. They are empty 
so they aren't taking up any space. And if you look all the files are named 
"wallpaper.jpg" so don't even consider moving them into the same folder. They 
sync just fine if you put them in the proper photo sync folder for iTunes. Once 
again enjoy.
