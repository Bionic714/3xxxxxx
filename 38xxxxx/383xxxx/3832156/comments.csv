,bcman1969,2007-10-09T06:31Z,"Good Quality, but missing the last 1/2 of the movie, anyone know if there is another file with part 2?"
,abbasotobus,2007-10-09T09:35Z,"It is not missing any part, due to file size being over 2 gb some standalones do not support it, no problem with pc or xbox..

Rip is from dvd9 released in usenet a few days ago.."
,abbasotobus,2007-10-09T09:38Z,"moschos, UnSeeN is an AFR group known with their high quality xvid releases at dvdr compatibility sizes (this is 2/3 dvdr sized release) in ed2k community.. They are not scene so they don't follow TDX rules to gain maximal quality in their releases.."

,oknitro,2007-10-17T05:24Z,"usually bad motion in fast scenes is fault of 1080i on a HD screen. dvd5 isnt shitty, if compressed properly its fine. "
