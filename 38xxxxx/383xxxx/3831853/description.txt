Comments:
The source is a really cheap NTSC DVD. It claims to be "Digitally Remastered", but the transfer looks really cheap with lots of
white dots and other artifects. The movie was encoded in 29.97 fps hard-dropdown, so I had to do a manual IVTC and then dropping
the duplicate frames. The DVD had a lot of light background to dark background effects, like as it wanted to look like it was really
shown in a 1932 cinema, but this annoying effect is somewhat less prone in the encoded version, not sure if it's because of the
Fluxsmooth filter or the encoder or what. I darkened the brightness slightly, so that the result would look less gray and worn out.

The movie is stored in a 1.7 GB VOB-file, and I doesn't really want to use much space for the encoded version (because the source isn't
good), hence the 350 MB encode. I used the x264 video codec, because I believe that it is relatively better than XviD at low bitrates.
x264 takes more processor power than XviD to decode, but I don't think that it will be an issue at this small size.

The movie itself is probably mostly for those of us that already likes Hitchcock's movies. The plot is at times a bit too confusing, and
you can see that the final chase is a model (but is still pretty amazing for its time). Enjoy!
