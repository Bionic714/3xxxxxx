Ben Stiller is directing a film based on the life of Goran, an Eastern European man whose wife and son died in the Balkans War. Andy and Maggie are playing extras in the film. Andy attempts to get a speaking part by befriending Goran, who gets him a spoken line in the film. However, Andy then gets in an argument with Stiller and is kicked off the set. Maggie, meanwhile, takes an interest in one of the crew but it goes wrong after Maggie (through Andy) learns that he has one leg shorter than the other
