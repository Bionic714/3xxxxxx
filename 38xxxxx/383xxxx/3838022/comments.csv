,bano32,2010-06-18T22:51Z,hi so I'm guessing that the tribes of the east is an addition to the original right? if that's so then were should i put the files that i extracted from the file? but maybe i just had to launch it with daemon tools? i will be very happy if someone answers me :)

,Cran593,2011-08-08T15:57Z,"Works fine. I was kind of skeptical as to whether this torrent would be good as there was a lack of detail in the description and not really any comments to confirm if it was good, but it was perfect, but to be honest I prefer the original Heroes V... "
,Spambolo,2011-10-20T12:30Z,"Thankyou! This is the best torrent of this game on TPB. For the record it is a clean, English, v 3.0 disc image. After mounting and installing, patch it to v 3.1 and bingo.

I would also recommend installing the Heroes V AI fan patch, which removes all the AI cheats (there are tons) and totally re-balances the game, making it the most strategically deep and satisfying version possible. Just Google ""Heroes 5 eternal essence"" for the patch's home page."
