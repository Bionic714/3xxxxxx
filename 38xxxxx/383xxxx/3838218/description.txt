Nils Malmros famous coming-of-age drama.
Nostalgia hurts so much...
PS
Could someone Danish and/or Scandinavian please use the script to make subtitles?

Non-spoilerish description:
Elin is one of the most popular girls, when something unsettling happens between her and the other girls. Niels-Ole is a popular boy, who does something to annoy his female class-mates.

Shot over a period of two years, this is one Denmarks most famous movies of the 1980s and a pop-culture phenomenon in Denmark, the rest of Scandinavia and North-Western Europe.

A similar story line can be found in the Dutch film Bluebird (2004).
