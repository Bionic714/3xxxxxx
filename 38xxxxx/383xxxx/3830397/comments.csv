I only recognized 3 songs on this volume which makes it a very good learning experience.

Roaring Boys - House Of Stone reminds me of a cross between A-Ha and Men At Work.

New Musik was a little ahead of it's time. I loved their work at the time and still do. It was only when Naked Eyes (produced and influenced by Tony Mansfield of New Musik) that the masses apprieciated the sound.

Thanks for the fun so far."

,CliffSpab,2011-03-16T22:23Z,"Thanks 80z. These Rare Hits of the 80's are awesome. I never would have re-discovered bands like Fiat Lux without these compilations...
Being Canadian, I do recognize some Canada only material here (Pukka, Blue Peter, FM etc.) It's good to share this stuff with the world... "
