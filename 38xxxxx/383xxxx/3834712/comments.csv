,foxhound,2007-10-08T23:19Z,"Yaeh, itÂ´s good. IÂ´ve checked that out.. never seen episode.. i think :)"
,runner777,2007-10-08T23:21Z,ok i'll keep sharing..
,Tjerp,2007-10-09T18:05Z,This is real :) the sound volume is pretty low though
,DrChandra,2007-10-10T15:01Z,"hehe pretty cool
and wild mut, it's a pretty good guess that your fantastic insight that it should have been episode 3 instead of 4 didn't escape whomever got it to us. I see two reasonable scenarios. 1) for some practical reason he was only able to get access to episode 4. or 2) episode 4 was actually completed before episode 3. this is not uncommon, episode 4 might even be aired before ep 3.
good stuff :) I hope the atlantis makers aren't too bummed about it and see it as a compliment"
,Akkumies,2007-10-11T14:20Z,"i think this one leaked from iTunes

,barryke,2007-10-12T02:58Z,"Yup, it was on iTunes since 30 september, but named 'Adrift' aka eppisode S04E01 accidentally.


The chips 'n dibs:
It was a Atlantis Season 4 promotion for web resellers spreaded by SciFi or MGM's PR department. Apple released part of it by accident. What-a-mistaka-to-maka!


Personal rant:
I don't complain however. An episode without mixed audio made me realize how much quality we take for granted. 
The SG crew deserve more credit, SG won't exist for long when most of its audiance copies it. Dont forget Europe, where its broadcasted with over a year delay. People feel as if they have no choice. I do.
Err.. did. Let me try iTunes next time! - if it will work in Europe that is..

Many thanks."
