,Swe.Shadz,2007-10-09T04:01Z,"Thank You VEEERRY MUCHHH themodest!!

,Fedjeviking,2007-10-09T04:45Z,"Great stuff! Thanks themodest, it was worth the wait! 

I'll keep seeding for at least a week, maybe longer."
,themodest,2007-10-09T05:42Z,"You guys honoured and couraged me.
Thanks for trusting me.

Finally we have 100+ seeds.

I could only find restricted torrents
for this set so i downloaded all dvd's
and wanted to make it available to all.
for free.

Sharing is bliss. "
,thesoftparade,2007-10-09T06:57Z,"Thank you, thank you!
Finally I have finished the download of this wonderful torrent! It took quite some time but it was well worth it. These guys really knows what they're doing, it's awesome! I wanna thank themodest for his great work on uploading and seeding this set. I really, really appreciate the effort! Thank you very much! I already have a 3.5 ratio but I'll seed this baby 24/7 for at least a couple of weeks more. thanks!"
,Fedjeviking,2007-10-10T01:51Z,Question guys...do these work on a Mac also? 
,themodest,2007-10-10T14:23Z,"It needs a browser with the latest flash player installed.

If you can handle that in a mac it'll work.

And int lessons the guy uses a mac sometimes
i guess it should work with safari."
,themodest,2007-10-10T15:04Z,"More than 400 leechers and only 20 seeds left.
This should not be the way to appreciate.

As you know how to get, why not learn to share.

I have still hope in your sharing potential :)"
,Fedjeviking,2007-10-11T00:16Z,"Hey themodest---I'm still seeding! 

I have to use a Mac at college and wanted to be sure there wasn't another format. According to the site there is only the one DVD and it gives both formats as what is needed--so it should work.

Thanks themodest! This was really a great upload. I love it!"
,jonha,2007-10-11T03:55Z,"44% already in 2 days... got 33 seeders, maybe its because they gave their pc's some rest, mine havent been off for 3 weeks , ill seed after this, maybe 500gig or more...

Like 500 ppl downloaded allready."
,themodest,2007-10-12T22:22Z,"I especially want to thank ppl who appreciate sharing and keep seeding.

At least in return for what you got, keep seeding for a while. As you are pleased, let others be pleased too.

Due to its 18gigs it needs to be seeded a little bit longer than less bigger files."
,jonha,2007-10-15T12:02Z,"At last! the long wait is over!!! ^^, 

My gratitude and thanks to the people that made this torrent availble, for all the seeder, especially to themodest for painstakingly sharing this and made this available for everyone, to all the peolple that will download this PLEASE dont forget to seed...

,N-rice,2007-12-22T08:01Z,"#  When connecting to another BitTorrent client, the requesting client will first try port 6881, then 6882, and so on. However, if the computer is on a firewalled network, the incoming request may not reach these ports. On the other hand, if these requests succeed, the accepting client will be able to download faster.

# Firewalls can block nearly all of the ports used by P2P clients. To ensure the BitTorrent ports are made available to requesting clients, a home router or firewall can be manually configured to accept them. Most home routers possess a feature called ""Port Range Forwarding"" to do this. This feature allows the administer to tell the firewall where traffic for a given port number should be directed."

,Samm547,2009-04-23T14:49Z,"to everone who is saying ""SEED"" :

There are 108 seeders seeding this torrent, the problem is not that people aren't seeding, it's that they seed at 1 kb/s or likewise to get on the seeder's list, when they actually have a share ratio of 0.00001.

TO all the people seeding like shit :

Go fuck yourself, seed like me, I dont put a limit on my seeding, an guess what? I finshed in 12 hrs because if you seed more, you establish more connections with more people who seed like you do, and it turns out like bittorrent was originally planned... fast downloads.... but you guys suck and you might as well leech."

,mickrj,2009-10-25T01:41Z,"I've seeded this to a ratio of 0.9 during the DL and will continue until... well whatever it get's to for the next couple of weeks.

This collection shows exactly the type of photoshop skills you actually WANT to learn rather than what you usually get from so-called ""Training DVD's"" i.e. ""This is what I can do as a photoshop expert, aren't you jealous"" kind of tutorial.

During the last couple of years I have used TPB to update my version of photoshop but, with my level of skill, being self-taught as I am, I may as well have just used the GIMP.

What I did when DL'ing this, was to set the priority to each DVD in order so I was able to watch a DVD as I was still downloading. By the time the full set had downloaded I had managed to follow the first DVD to the point where I had produced a piece of work which surpassed, not only my previous efforts, but had even surpassed my wildest expectations. 

I've yet to see a training set as in-depth or as relevant to a novices needs as this. 

Thank you, thank you and thrice and more thank you to themodest and all seeders who have contributed to me acquiring this, quite frankly, awesome collection.

So, if you download this, don't be selfish and share.

I mean, it even takes you through a step-by-step tutorial of CG paiting for chrissakes!!! WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK!!!!

Can you tell I like this?"

,jdawson8761,2009-12-19T01:33Z,"There is no use in cursing the idiots out there to seed.  There are three types of users here on piratebay:

1st:  The n00bs, these are the people new to torrenting and don't know crap about bandwidth usages.  They never usually cap there upload limits.  I love these guys.

2nd:  Ignorant bastards, these are the people that are not n00bs, but are worse.  They download selfeshly and try every which way to make their downloads faster, capping their upload ect.  These guys I can live without, but I shall let them live...........for now.

3rd:  White hats, this category is the one people should want to be in.  These guys/girls never cap their upload, or just a little bit but still upload modestly.  These are good people (but they are still downloading illegally, who cares though?) and should be praised by what they do."
