Clearly, this guy is uploading a bunch of uncracked/unseeded/incomplete, misleading stuff here in order to make us pay for them through his web site!"
,baleb,2007-10-17T11:23Z,"Yes, it does not start downloading.
Seems broken.
The files can't be downloaded from the sites at the top of the description. To download them from there you should pay for him.

This is shit.

Do not download!"

,p69k,2009-01-07T22:25Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD SOLID EDGE v20!!!!

With this licence, files made on SE v20 after few week (or some times months) are usless. You won't be able neither to open nor to convert these files. So in fact SE v20 is useless for longer work!"
