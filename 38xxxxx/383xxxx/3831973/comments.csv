,divingfinatic,2007-10-30T02:51Z,I'd like some feedback about this DVD in ISO form: Anyone got any comments?  Is this download working successfully for you? Any problems burning it?
,missjenniferd,2007-12-04T09:19Z,"nope, no problems, and thank you for these :P"
,bellarmine,2011-06-15T10:44Z,"Hi folks,

Guess what?  I've found torrents for Complete Mr Ed Seasons 1 and 2 on D-e-m-o-n-o-i-d.me (remove the dashes.....:^)
'Mister Ed Season 1 (1961)'
'Mister Ed Season 2 (1961-1962)'

Search for     Mister Ed


And 1 episode of Season 4:
'Mr. Ed S04E21 Mae West Meets Mr. Ed'

Search for     Mr Ed mae west


If anyone downloads these, maybe they could upload the torrent files to TPB, so everyone else can get at them.............:^)

Cheers!"
