,Kiweed,2007-12-18T13:55Z,"Why must 1 person feel the need to tell another person what they may do to the 1 thing we actually do own in this world, ourselves, if we had the opportunity to experience all of the plants' and herbs' enlightening propperties for ourselves we may have  found new light in this dark world that now is. However that experience in life, the experience that I or anyone else will be punished or locked away in a cage for having or even intending to have is more important than ever, it will bring people together in a way never seen before, harmony in the spirit of humans is at stake. Expand your horizon! Peace :)"
