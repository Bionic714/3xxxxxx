With this you'll be able to play FA Beta in singleplayer(sandbox).
Just extract the file to the FA setup folder and run extract.bat, then you'll have to create a shortuct for /bin/SupremeCommander.exe and launch the game with "/map <mapname> /faction <factionnumber> " to play.
AI is not possible in the beta, and I couldn't get LAN to work either.
