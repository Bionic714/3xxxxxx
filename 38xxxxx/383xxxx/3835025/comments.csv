,kruder111,2007-10-09T22:01Z,"Are there some readme instructions in english in this torrent? If not, could you please provide the readme in english, so we english can be able to install ""without errors"" as you state? 

Thanx "
,heinz-ketchup,2007-10-10T20:08Z,"when you want only the english version, you mustn't install ""silent_hunter_4_german_voices.exe""

1. Silent.Hunter.4.Wolves.Of.The.Pacific.EMUDVD-Unleashed-Repackage.rar with WinRAR 3.71 or higher extract. You can find the password in the internet.

2. Mount ""SilentHunter4.mds"" with DAEMON Tools Lite 4.10 or DAEMON Tools Pro v4.10.0215 or higher (www.daemon-tools.cc). Please check if all copy protection emulations are set active.

3. Now start the setup. Don't start the game directly after installation.

4. In the directory ""Patches"" you will find the german language patch ""silent_hunter_4_german_voices.exe"" for germans only. if you're don't want german language you skip this installation. continue with the patch 1.3 ""silent_hunter_4_1.3.exe"".

5. In the program directory you first should make a backup of ""sh4.exe"" for future updates. Now copy the cracked ""sh4.exe"" from the directory ""Crack"" to your install path and replace the *.exe.

6. Now you can eject the Alcohol-Image from Deamon Tools.

7. Start game and descend ;-)


* if you encounter problems starting the game without the Alcohol-Image please mount it again""SilentHunter4.mds"" again."
