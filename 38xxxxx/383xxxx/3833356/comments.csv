,nwasong,2008-05-14T07:10Z,My install for Zeus did not work ... and when I tried installing poseidon it says zeus was not found. This means I need to install zeus before i can install poseidon ... but zeus does not install. Any ideas please? I used daemon tools to install.
,drazzil,2008-05-18T18:57Z,"Sorry, can someone give me a hand? Downloaded it fine but have no clue how to burn it. Am using Nero, thanks."

,LionHeart8669545,2008-08-11T13:30Z,Somebody help me...I downloaded it and I burn it to CD and the only install when I start to play this game it doesn't work....Is because I'm using Windows Vista?
,Gaijen,2008-08-22T02:28Z,"Looks like I'm in the same boat, has anybody been able to get this to work recently?  (Say, within the year of 2008, on Windows XP/Vista?)

Either this file itself is corrupt (unlikely) or Zeus (a 2001 game) doesn't run on these new OS's.

But my issue's the same as all the others above:   Mount the image with Daemon, the Autorun starts fine, click ""Install"", *crash*.  

Tried running setup after exploring the mounted image:  *crash*.
"
,Gaijen,2008-08-22T05:11Z,"Found it.   Couple of things to do:

1.)   Make a shortcut to SETUP.EXE on your desktop.  Go to the shortcut's Properties / Compatibility, and turn it all on.   (Windows 95 compatibility, 256 colors, 640x480, disable visual themes, turn off advamced text.)

2.)   Go here:   http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/Zeus-Master-Olympus-t11365.html  and follow the link to xp_fix.exe.   Run the fix.

3.)  A change I did, but no idea if it made a difference:  My Computer / Properties / Advanced / Environment Variables /  Change ""temp"" to c:\temp.  (Found that suggestion in an earlier thread.)

I have mine installed and running, thanks for the blast from the past Olsein!"
,smiggger,2008-11-02T09:13Z,"hello, i downloaded the the torrent, and when it had finished i tried to get it to work and it doesn't recognise Poseidon.mdf OR Poseidon.mds. this goes for Zeus also. it asks which program to run it from and i don't know so can someone tell me please?"

,italybane,2008-12-03T22:41Z,Thankz i love this game and resently i stepped on my original disk and broke it in half. so i praise you for gettin this up
,fogpatch,2008-12-08T07:27Z,"for anyone who has trouble with getting the install to run on it's pc (double click setup.exe and nothing happens) here's the fix:

1. go to the system32 folder in the windows directory

2. open notepad and copy the following:
dos=high, umb
device=%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\himem.sys
files=40

3. save as: ""config.nt"" in the system32 directory (be sure to check that it's *.nt file and not a notepad file)

4. close notepad and reopen it for a new file

5. copy the following:
@echo off
    lh %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\mscdexnt.exe
    lh %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\redir
    lh %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\dosx
    SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 P330 T3

6. save as: ""autoexec.nt"" in the system32 folder

7. download command.com in the system32 folder from this website:
http://www.techadvice.com/specs/files_dl.asp?fnid=241

8. restart your computer and retry the setup.exe ==> it should launch without a problem now.

good luck"

thanks for the upload olsein, works perfect"
,Suus1990,2010-03-09T12:41Z,"first off, thank you for posting this lovely torrent! works great.

second: tutorial on how to install and play.
1. download Utorrent from: http://www.utorrent.com/
you need this program to actually download these files.
2. download and install daemon tools from: http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/home
you can get a trial version for free.
3. download WINRAR. you will need it to unpack files from ISO. can be downloaded here: http://www.rarlab.com/
4. find the directory to which Utorrent downloaded the torrent files. usually that's your ""downloads"" folder.
5. open deamon tools. click and drag the MDS and MDF files from the downloaded torrentmap, into DeamonTools.
6. right mouse click on Zeus icon and press ""mount image"". this icon will now appear in the ""virtual devices"" box below.
7. right mouse click that virtual device and press ""make disc image"". go to the Image Catalog tab and select your preferred directory. this is where the program will install the files.
8. wait until the program is done installing files. then go to the folder it created. there should be a large disclike looking icon. it's an ISO file.
9. right mouse click the iso file and press ""unpack files"". Choose the directory you wish to unpack all files to.
10. repeat step 6 to 9 for the Poseidon expansion, using Daemontools.
11. restart your computer. it helped me get through the problem that it wouldnt start my setup.
12. once restarted, go to the directory where you installed Zeus. Press autorun. Press Install. it should now install properly.
13. do the same for Poseidon expansion.
14. restart computer again. it is needed to be able to play.
15. find the initial directory where this torrent was downloaded to -> the one containing the MDS and MDF files.
16. run the Poseidon MDS file. the game will be run.
17. press start to begin :)

enjoy!"

,Tealeaf86,2010-06-30T11:08Z,"I seem to have a problem, I can install it and it runs just fine but it doesn't seem to remember any saves. I can open the directory and see the files in it but from the load menu's they don't exist."
,kiba166,2010-10-18T16:52Z,"HOW TO INSTALL WITHOUT MOUNTING TO DISK!
seeing as no one is helping people with this matter i have found out how for myself.

1. Right click Zeus.mdf > rename > delete .mdf replace with .bin
2. download MagicIso and WinRAR
3 open Magic Iso and navigate to tools > convert
4. select zeus.bin and convert to iso
5 once converted, find in your folder, and with winrar, right click, and extract to zues...
6. open folder. run setup
:D :D
repeat for poseidon"
,kiba166,2010-10-18T17:12Z,"ignore rename to bin you can just convert the mdf file on magic iso, then extract with winrar"
,kiba166,2010-10-19T17:00Z,"kiba here!
the next problem is insert disc error
download deamon-tools lite
then, once downloaded and opened, double click the hard drive picture in the bottom window and open the MDS file for the game you want to play
either one is the same Zeus + Posiedon (if installed)
happy gaming! :D"
,821509,2010-12-14T18:31Z,"If anyone else with a 64bit system couldn't install, I finally found a way.

Download Universal Extractor or any alternative to Installshield. 

Extract data1.cab to wherever you want the game. Done, now Zeus is working. 

Install Poseidon on top of it - if you had the same problem as me, the installer for Poseidon should work fine. Just tell it the directory of Zeus when it asks.

Bam, done. PHEW."
,NovakVSM,2010-12-18T11:55Z,Help me...i have Win7 64-bit...and when i start daemon tools he won't to open Zeus.iso...what to do?...

,loloss,2011-01-13T01:58Z,"i've mounted both, installed succesfully, restarted multiple times, but every time i click play for zeus or for poseidon  (in the window that says extras, uninstal etc) or i click on the autorun file, nothing happens. the loading pointed appears for a few seconds but then dissapears. IDEAS?"
,Peregrine2976,2011-03-28T21:10Z,"Fucking fail torrent. There's no No-CD patch and Poseidon asks you to insert disc 2 while installing despite the fact that there is clearly no disc 2 included in the torrent.
