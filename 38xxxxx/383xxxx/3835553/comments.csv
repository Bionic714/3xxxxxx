,stussy99,2010-03-20T22:08Z,"upsdave, Thank you very much for this. All 9 innings are done and I will seed for a long time! This is GREAT! And I can confirm that Inning 10 from 1995 - Present is in the works as per Ken Burns himself in January 2010. The rumors are over! Baseball is a must have for any fan of the game - upsdave, on behalf of those who didn't take a minute of their lives to thank you - ""Thank you for your work."""
,Zamrig242,2011-08-15T22:49Z,"Wow!  Just an enormous THANK YOU to upsdave and ALL seeders [I see you there, American, Canadian and German friends].  I live in a place with limited internet and all of your patience during my extensive download of all parts is greatly appreciated.  I have wanted this doc for a while now.

I will be seeding this for quite some time!  Cheers!"
