Ben Kingsley (SEXY BEAST) as Frank Falenczyk, a hit man whose work for the Buffalo-based Mafia has been hampered by his hopeless alcoholism. Falenczyk is sent off to San Francisco where Alcoholics Anonymous awaits, as does Dave (Bill Pullman), who helps Frank get an apartment and a job in a mortuary. The job introduces Frank to Laurel (Téa Leoni), whom he begins a relationship with while occasionally falling off the wagon and attending AA meetings. Wonderful performances from Ben Kingsley and Téa Leoni. You Kill Me is a charming, funny take on the familiar inner-lives-of-hit-men premise.

Cast: Ben Kingsley, Téa Leoni, Luke Wilson, Bill Pullman, Dennis Farina
