  ?    Created by the psychedelic trance pioneer Simon Posford and Benji     ? ?
  ?    Vaughn the mastermind behind Prometheus and The Egg. The pair team    ? ?
  ?    up once again to create their second album, a breathtaking album      ? ?
  ?    with stunning sound production, that takes listeners on an            ? ?
  ?    incredibly varied musical journey.                                    ? ?
  ?                                                                          ? ?
  ?    'The Last Days Of Gravity' is a unique melee of electronic,           ? ?
  ?    acoustic, and vocal music, running the gamut of beautiful,            ? ?
  ?    strange, catchy, psychedelic, melancholic, uplifting. Despite its     ? ?
  ?    consistently psychedelic tone, the album has a very human element     ? ?
  ?    to it, and you can sense the spirit and emotion that have gone        ? ?
  ?    into its creation.                                                    ? ?
  ?                                                                          ? ?
  ?    The harmonic variety of 'Last Days' is particularly mesmerising.      ? ?
  ?    The bindingly riveting melodic lines provide echoes of Posford's      ? ?
  ?    earlier work in Shpongle and Celtic Cross, as well as of his more     ? ?
  ?    recent collaboration with the legendary Alan Parsons. This album      ? ?
  ?    is no retro piece of work, however, with Posford and Vaughn's         ? ?
  ?    legendary innovation resulting in a complex mix of styles that        ? ?
  ?    eludes genre-casting. Despite having no obvious dance numbers,        ? ?
  ?    'The Last Days Of Gravity' provides enough levity to be the           ? ?
  ?    perfect soundtrack to the richness of daily experience.               ? ?
  ?                                                                          ? ?

  ? ?  Our Primary objective is to release stuff that there are no previous    ?

  ? ?  NCR is a private group and the CD's we rip are bought, not stolen.      ?
  ? ?  We are also independent, therefore with all respect to MP3 quality,     ?
  ? ?  we laugh at the new rules, invented by lamers from the scene, who       ?
  ? ?  think that low quality shit releases is good enough for them. Their     ?
  ? ?  new (enforced) standard is V2 (fair quality) using vbr-new (fast but    ?
  ? ?  inferior quality algoritm). We chose V0 (best quality) using vbr-old    ?
  ? ?  (LAMEs "workhorse", producing the best VBR quliaty rips). Also, when    ?
  ? ?  we can we use FhG (best encoder) 320 CBR Full Stereo Archive quality    ?
  ? ?  in our releases.                                                        ?
