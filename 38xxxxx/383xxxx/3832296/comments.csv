,pantera6993,2008-04-04T19:17Z,"@robopope69: instead of looking for a whole new torrent, you could just get a BitTorrent client that lets you choose which files you want and which ones you don't like BitTorrent, uTorrent, or to a lesser extent, BitComet.

Great torrent Kali_yo, I could never find any albums with Terry Glaze on vocals"
