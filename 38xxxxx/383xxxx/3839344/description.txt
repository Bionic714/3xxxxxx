  4.9 / 5 (based on 4 ratings). What did you think of it?  

Plot: The story of 1930s Shanghai, and one man's rise to the top of the gangster food chain. 
 
Overview: Chen Kuan-tai exuded incredible power on screen, which his directors used to great advantage in this fight-filled follow-up to the smash hit The Boxer Fom Shantung. All the lead character did was win some money gambling with a Shanghai gangleader?s playboy son, but that?s enough for the father and child to want obsessive revenge. It all culminates in an incredible climatic fight, choreographed by the legendary Liu Chia-liang and Chen Chuan, co-star of Bruce Lee?s Fist Of Fury.
