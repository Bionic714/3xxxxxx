in the greek mythology) you will feel a                  
multiemotional and powerfull sound with a perfect        
dose of psychadelism.

result of some months of work for delivering to you    
this masterpiece of music and art. It combines            
elements of nature versus futuristic technology is        
the conflict of your civilisation of today...and its

compilation... Listen the goddess cry of help before

Inclued some of the best artists of today...This new    
release will again twist your brain!                  
We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying.
MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands !!
You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout.
Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much!
