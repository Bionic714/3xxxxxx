Release Notes 
Nagual Sound Experiment, the downtempo
project of pioneering psy-breaks artist Mood
Deluxe, truly tests new musical waters with
this exploratory and amorphous collection of
tracks. "Invisible Movements" is released on
one of the UK's finest new record labels,
Liquid Records. NSE, or Cameron
Leonard-Schroff, makes music his life, and
this album encapsulates his energy
perfectly... a whopping eighty minutes and
fifteen audio compositions mean not a
nano-second of space is wasted, every note a
mote of meticulous effort, talent and
planning. On top of NSE's knack for siphoning
styles from every culture and time period of
music conceivable, Cameron has the technical
knowledge to back up his imagination... his
considerable professional studio and teaching
experience come into play to ensure nothing
but top-notch sound enjoyment on this
colossal album. Cameron AKA Nagual Sound
Experiment AKA Mood Deluxe is making quite a
world name for himself as an artist, and his
latest album "Invisible Movements" only
solidifies that reputation as a boundless
entertainer and artist like none other before
him!
