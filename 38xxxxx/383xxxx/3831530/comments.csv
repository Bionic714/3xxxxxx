,sadox,2007-12-20T01:00Z,will this work on 5g ipod?
,neocorpse,2008-01-17T23:40Z,nice. I'll give this a shot and see if it works. For those of you asking about ipod compatablility. Keep your lame ass apple products away from the vastly superior psp. If you wanna watch ipod crap GO TO THE IPOD SECTION. It's bad enough you weak ass elitist mac users are trying to take over ever form of media possible. If you have a mac....sucks to be you.
