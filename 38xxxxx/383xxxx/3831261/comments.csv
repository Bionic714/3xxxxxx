Great album but stuck at 42% :("
[V],80zforever,2008-01-02T23:49Z,"Hey, this is an old post and I guess noone is seeding. I'll try to re-seed it for you tonight."
,palyniam,2008-01-05T16:15Z,"that would be great but still nothing, can you send via email or msn?

palyniam at gmail dot com"
,palyniam,2008-01-05T17:43Z,"thanks  for trying but still stuck , never mind got the first 3 songs that I remember from the album and they are fine.... have you seen that someone wants $140 for the cd, thats around ÂŁ85 to me in the Uk, so they can get lost, had the album many years ago but was robbed and all my cd's went."
[V],80zforever,2008-01-06T01:47Z,"hey palyniam, i am re-seeding. let me know if you can't get it and I will create a new torrent.

cheers"
,palyniam,2008-01-07T20:59Z,Got it all and now seeding too....thanks very very much
,torrentado08,2008-03-21T16:11Z,"hi,

i hope u one?"
,mattsiemattsie,2008-08-14T08:16Z,"Hey there, would love to get this album (have been looking for a long time) but for some reason it's not working. Can you help?"
[V],80zforever,2008-08-19T01:06Z,"mattsiemattsie, I will try to re-seed this for you. I normally seed during the night hours Pacific Standard Time."
,mattsiemattsie,2008-08-23T16:35Z,"Hey 80zforever. Would be fantastic if you could re-seed. I just tried to download again, but without success. I'll keep my fingers crossed... :-)"
[V],80zforever,2008-08-26T23:01Z,"mattsiemattsie, I could not re-seed this as probably the songs on my new HD of another rip from the CD so the tracker can't identify it. So what I will do is to re-post this as a new torrent tonight. make sure you won't miss although I keep seeding it for a while."
,gotchaspy,2009-09-29T14:09Z,"hey 80z, hope you could reseed this one. i know its been awhile since you first posted this one; hope you could help us out who are stuck..i agree this is one album that should have been bigger at that time, but for those like us who were lucky enough to swing to their beat...we know better.  thanks in advance. =)"
