,jonblund60,2008-01-05T14:09Z,"Exellent work! Have been thinking about adding norwegian subtitles to good documentaries like, Freedom to Fascism, but don't have the time and knowhow..
Just a few comments:
>Intro about what's going on in Norway is very good but details and tekst may be moving a bit fast.
Leonard Cohens ""everybody knows"" is cool enough, but quite some younger people may skip the intro because of the choosen soundtrack.  
>Downloadspeed is good but torrent stopped at 99.7%-4.23 Gb., and the file did not move to the share-windo. I had to copy all the VIDEO_TS files and move them to another folder in order to be able to burn.
>Freedom to Fascism is compressed. Quality is viewable for sure but my standalone DVD player had some trouble and jumped over some parts a few times when watching the movie on TV.

I would have ""fixed"" the above myself if I had the knowhow and time. I'm in doubt if it's worth to burn/share copies or tell others to download it as it is now.

No offense, efford is appericiated  a lot!
