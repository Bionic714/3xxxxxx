,eovnu87435ds,2007-12-22T19:45Z,UPDATE = BAD THINGS! if you update and use the jack cracker serial the first time you go to use it you get a message saying software piracy is a bad thing! and it closes
,eovnu87435ds,2007-12-22T19:47Z,Ha ha stoopid me didn't read through the comments. I tried the new serial with whatever the current version as of 12/22/07 and it worked!
,necromanson,2007-12-30T01:36Z,"Wow.  After reading the documentation and working with this excellent program I almost feel bad for not paying for it.  ALMOST.  

I didn't download this version however, I got the new one off the website and used the serial numbers provided in these comments.  Thanks anyway though!  THIS PROGRAM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
