The opening credits of this disgusting sleazefest feature the theme from PSYCHO.    Suffice it to say this is not a movie to watch if you're offended by incest, rape, racial epithets and some nice scenes of humiliation thrown in for good measure. Here is the cast: A man wearing a ski mask who possesses a big machete + mother, brother, sister, hairy girl friend of sister -- all of whom just want to take an innocent trip into the forest . . . but Mr. Ski Mask has other ideas. Oh yes, and there's a black man tied to a tree as well. The sister runs into him while trying to escape from Mr. Ski Mask. But Mr. Ski Mask With The Big Machete catches up. Uh-oh. Somehow I doubt VCX will be re-releasing this anytime soon, esp. with the PSYCHO theme played in its entirety. A peachy movie to watch with a group of people you really hate.
