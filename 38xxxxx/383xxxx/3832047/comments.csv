,shro60606,2008-06-28T22:43Z,"This worked for me.
Running Vista 64

I downloaded  W.I.C from pirate bay
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3812543/World_in_conflict_%5BPC-DVD%5D_%5BEnglish%5D_

I installed it, and presumed it would work but I got the No DVD error. I looked in the drive (mounted with D-tools) and there was no crack.

I downloaded this, and to be honest didnt think Id be in luck, copied the files over and overwrite them and chaching it worked.

No viruses etc.

Thanks for the upload."
