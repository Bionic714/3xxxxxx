,galaxyvn,2007-10-08T15:31Z,Don't worry . I will seed 23/24 hours everyday by 2 computers
,Rolle12,2007-10-08T17:06Z,"I'm not worrying ""galaxyvn"", Only suprised it's going soo slow. But there is a lot of leechers so I'm not sure superseeding helps.
Just have to wait a day or two for it.."

,Mushashi7,2009-03-24T19:16Z,"I must say this is quite a job. Extraordinary.

I have collected almost the entire danish collection starting in 1949. Missing about 38 issues.
I am very exited to see what the difference is vs. the american issues. How they are build up etc.

About the *.ISO:
Just use Daemon Tools or Isobuster if you wish to get access to them before you burn."
