,downloading king,2007-10-10T07:17Z,just use a timestoper and stop 
,mickeboy,2007-10-10T14:07Z,This can not be installed without serial number. Besides checking for enough storage space (65 GB) and language input serial number is the first this you have to enter.
,Zipper69ab,2007-10-10T14:13Z,Yes it can be installed without a serial number - you get 30 days to enter one.
,Champion92,2007-10-10T18:17Z,"This is NOT the final OEM.

Microsoft would never use the Windows server 2003 bootscreen with this."
[T],Supafly2000,2007-10-11T02:10Z,This IS the retail OEM version since I bought it from an online dealer and ripped it to ISO. I know  it says Windows 2003 Server on the boot screen... Not sure why they left that in.

If what you say is true then you wont mind me asking for a photo of the Packaging 

Note: Packaging must be shown right next to your computer screen showing this topic

this way we all know that its real and not a fake..


I think this is how everyone should post things so this way we know if its real or fake.."
,mickeboy,2007-10-11T08:45Z,Zipper69ab -> I downloaded and tried to install. What do I type in when asked for the serial number? This is the third screen in the installation process.

I spent money on this, took the time to rip and post it and you want me to waste more time playing your childish games trying to prove to you that it is real.

FUCK YOU!

,guif,2007-10-11T10:43Z,"@Supafly2000

You shouldnt have given your serial. If people are bitchin, let them. Those who know better will find a crack and decide if it's the real deal. And they'll know that WHS is just a preconfigured version of WS2k3. just ignore em. Thanks for the great up."
,ir0nw0lf,2007-10-11T15:49Z,"Someone posted a supposed crack to alt.binaries.warez.ibm-pc.0-day, the readme shows it's AntiWPA3 v3.4.6 for XP (?).  I have not tested it yet, just seen it posted there."

,kadarzsolt,2007-10-13T23:36Z,"It is real, don't worry! Download, install and use...
BTW: AntiWPA works on it, in case you don't have a serial number.

Message to legit users: do not give away your keys because they will get blocked anyway so nobody will get to use it (you will lose too). Maybe someone will get System Builder keys out ... 
Have you noticed the COA label shown at the activation? It is a Windows XP Professional label (Volume License version). Maybe those keys will work."
,stinky1,2007-10-14T18:13Z,"Hey Supafly2000, you have a patience of a saint, having to deal with all these dumb bitches.  Thanks for uploading.
I have a question though, I understand the SW wants to format my drive prior to install.  I have a partitioned drive, will it give me a choice or just format my bootstrap partition where XP currently resides...thanks!"
,kallstrom_74,2007-10-14T20:45Z,anyone know if there will be (or is) MUI for this (swedish)
,kadarzsolt,2007-10-15T03:40Z,WHS formats all drives to put the in the storage pool. Do not leave any drive in the system that you do not want to format.
,kadarzsolt,2007-10-15T19:18Z,"None of the keys out there activate. The first one that came out actually installs the product, but then it says it is unauthorized for activation. T

The other keys are just invalid.

The best bet is to wait for a pre-activated version or a keygen.

At this point no SBS 2003 keys work, the cracks render the system useless after reboot."
,Anixter,2007-10-16T05:30Z,"Thanks for the upload Supafly2000 

Well it installs with this key : 
P2H7J-VDDX2-KKVFY-TVWKK-F43JD 

no activation allowed.

But the AntiWPA 3.4.6 worked.

Updates & IE7 installed fine.

Will see how long it will last!!

Cheers!!"
,ir0nw0lf,2007-10-16T16:49Z,"The AntiWPA worked like a champ.  System Windows Updates 100% and I've set the date ahead 1 full year and back, no issues at all.  The P2H7J is the one I used.  Now I just have to buy a few monster hard drives."
,perbotn,2007-10-16T22:52Z,Fantastic! Up and running now!Thx supafly!
,stinky1,2007-10-16T23:52Z,I appreciate your input kadarzsolt!  I love this software and would probably buy a copy if it was easier to obtain at this time.
,Anixter,2007-10-17T04:08Z,"Tip!
Don't use a live account for your server for remote access.....sends info at times to them!

Get a DNS for your server and route it that way.

free accounts at no-ip or DynDNS 

Hope this helps some of you guys out

Cheers!

BTW - server runs good Microsoft.....just fix the certificate errors while you read the posts."
,Lazze Lazer,2007-10-17T10:18Z,"Well, im trying out this baby now, and it works great together with antiwpa....

im even using the remote access with live account and its great to be able to connect to my home computer and use it from anyplace. IF i get busted i recon its time to actually buy the product. its not that expensive...? will probably fall in price efter a while.

Thank you for patiently taking the time to buy, rip and post. I have been trying to get it with links from another site and they're not working"
,docdirty,2007-10-19T14:41Z,"How does this AntiWPA work. I innstalled as normal, and entered the serial that worked (listed somewhere above) but when its finally done installing I cant activate, and it wont let me log on at all, so how do you apply the AntiWPA-crack that someone listed to work? Did I install incorrectly, should I have set the date a year ahead before installing then reset it before first boot, or should I not have wrritten a serial at all to be able to use the free 30 day trial? Can somebody put up a step by step?
(Noob) doc"
,ir0nw0lf,2007-10-19T16:04Z,"docdirty, you DO NOT activate this at all, duh...  That's what the AntiWPA is for.  I installed this with the key, when I got to the point of logging in, I ran the AntiWPA script, rebooted, that's it.  The AntiWPA info states that you might still see prompts in the system tray bugging you that you have xx days to activate.  Ignore them.  I set my date ahead one year, rebooted, no issues, set date back one year, rebooted, no issues."
,kadarzsolt,2007-10-20T08:09Z,"Great advice! Let people put their stuff on this server and then get locked out by Windows for activation issues. Better wait until some working stuff comes out. Remember 
Windows XP and Vista both got good solutions for avoiding activation problems. it's just a matter of time."
,sat_maniac,2007-10-21T18:22Z,"ir0nw0lf, How can you run script the at logon..? "
,Deathbloomzdj,2007-10-28T11:50Z,kadarzsolt is right its best to wait for a better cracking solution. However this will give us a chance to look at home server and use the same download when a crack is created.
,quesyducky,2007-11-02T18:29Z,what build?

,AutumnFO,2007-12-07T10:53Z,"@ analjuggern4ut 

As WHS seems to be a modified version of Small Small Business Server, would that be a better source for OEMBIOS files etc.

,nd4spd,2008-01-02T01:13Z,So how is this supposed to be made bootable since the files once extracted don't produce an iso?
,analjuggern4ut,2008-01-07T18:01Z,"@AutumnFO:

I have never heard of a VLK version of SBS2003.

I tried to patch WHS with files from Srv2003 Standard, Enterprise and Datacenter editions and the Standard edition was the only one to work. If you don't have Srv2003 Std VLK disc, you could use this:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3243961/All_Windows_DVD

--> create standalone ISO ""Windows 2003 Standard Corp"", slipstream it with SP2 and follow my instructions. After that installing with any Srv2003 x86 volume license key should work."

Whats the story here? did you get your computers to successfully connect? if so where did i go wrong? after all this stuff you're just sayin to hell with it and buy it for 169$ lol..

,Oneill5491,2008-02-02T23:13Z,"Well the Anti-WPA worked for me too, but is there some way you can make WHS stop showing that you have 0 days remaining and telling you that your ""network health is critical?""  I would like it to show the nice pretty green icon again. =)"

,luma-svideo,2008-02-27T00:45Z,"I'm attempting to utilize the Server 2003 Std integration method without any luck.  I've downloaded the AIO CD and created a VLK ISO (volume label NRMSVOL_EN, the default for original no-SP server 2003 standard).  I extracted the ISO, and slipstreamed SP2 (WindowsServer2003-KB914961-SP2-x86-ENU.exe /integrate:C:\NRMSVOL_EN).  I then copied the listed files to a temporary folder.  Opened the ISO in the above torrent in WinISO, and added the files from the list.  The EULA.txt was not able to be added as it already existed (I've since tried  deleting the existing EULA.txt with the same results I will describe).  The resulting saved ISO mounts and boots OK in VMWare, but the server 2003 VLK keys I have do not work.  I've tried 4 different known working good keys from real corporate volume licenses (customers of mine).  To make sure, I booted the Server Standard 2003 VLK cd in VMWare and it accepted the keys I have been trying.

Any idea what might be going wrong?  Has anybody else been able to use VLK keys using the method analjuggern4ut describes?"
