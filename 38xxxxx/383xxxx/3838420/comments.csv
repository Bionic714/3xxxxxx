I joined the swarm 20 minutes ago, but there is no seed yet."
,madmax999,2007-10-11T22:29Z,Sorry.  Its fixed now.  I see a little download activity so I think it is ok.
,madmax999,2007-10-11T22:30Z,"VelvetFog,
Thank you for adding the IMDB ID.  I keep forgetting to look it up and include it."
,madmax999,2007-10-11T22:33Z,Glenn Ford in The Sheep Man and in Desparados is coming next.  Probably another 3 days to finish the download from eDonkey.
,madmax999,2007-10-12T13:47Z,"And formated for TV.  Watched it all the way thru yesterday.  Should have rated the quality as Good and not as Excellent.  I'll have The Sheepman up later today.  Watched that yesterday too.  Wide screen, very good quality.  Most of what I get is 700MB avi so definitely not DVD quality so I just list it under Movie.  Thanks for the comments."
,HBKsweden,2007-10-13T11:39Z,Great uploads Thx madmax999 . Love these old classics.  Keep them comming. 
,cenotaphium,2008-01-04T17:46Z,"Don't know if you're alerted to new comments, being the uploader - but I really got to write my thanks somewhere..

I've been going through your ""backlist"", having recently found your torrents, and I have to say they are all amazing.

Love you! ;)"
,madmax999,2008-01-10T05:27Z,"I appreciate the comments.  I try to scan all uploads for comments at least once a month. Mostly to see if any need to be reseeded or have other comments.  Everyone wants to seed new stuff so I concentrate on the old, especially movies that I really like."
,chazzw99,2008-03-28T09:12Z,Hi madmax999. I've been looking for this for ages - and The Sheepman too! Obviously not on DVD(yet) but the oldies are the goodies! Many thanks.
