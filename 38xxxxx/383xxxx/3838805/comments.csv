,DeltaPan,2007-10-12T13:28Z,"It is the lag caused by tacker to client updating matey.

When creating torrents, at end finish direct to seed, tickbox start seeding when completed and when you upload the torrent, open torrent in seed rank and manually update.

That will speed up the process and have you seeding almost immediately."
,DeltaPan,2007-10-12T13:29Z,"Sorry, that's tracker not tacker of course.

Typo."
