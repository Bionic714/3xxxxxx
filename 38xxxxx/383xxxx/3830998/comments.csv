,arteb182,2007-10-07T21:55Z,"Well it's downloading really fast.
Is the quality good?"
,rom10,2007-10-09T17:22Z,"arteb182, The quality is excellent, you can download the sample and see for yourself :)"
,walktheplank,2007-10-14T00:20Z,"I'm new to this so it's probably obvious for the seasoned people out there, but why are there so many files? Shouldn't it be just a video file (possibly in a folder with an nfo)?"
,rom10,2007-10-14T06:07Z,"It's because this is a release. Release comes in this special format so it will be easier to transfer it across the internet and stuff.
After you download you just extract the movie from the rar files and than you have your video file :)
