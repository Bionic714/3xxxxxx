,meeses,2007-11-24T12:09Z,"Of course, going to Frialwords means you  have to spend $10 PER MONTH in order to access their files.  Hmmm .. self promotion?"
,dice7781,2007-11-27T07:02Z,"hell! you think you have to spend 10/month, your sadly mistaken.  

They have more in the vip section but there is over 400 templates in the normal section including the largest Joomla warez section on the net!"
