Your last comments were all twisted and confued.  Have a good think and see why exactly you think mass murder based on lies is OK. 

Bobdaslob, I don't even know where to begin with you. You are a raving luny that noone takes seriously. Although as all mental cases I don't expect you to recognise this yourself.

""The United States tortures prisoners in violation of international law, former President Carter said Wednesday.
""I don't think it. I know it,"" Carter told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.

""Our country for the first time in my life time has abandoned the basic principle of human rights,"" Carter said. ""We've said that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to those people in Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo, and we've said we can torture prisoners and deprive them of an accusation of a crime to which they are accused.""
Carter also said President Bush creates his own definition of human rights.""

Bear in mind, over 90% of the prisoners in Guantanamo have been proven inocent.

,PeakOil,2007-10-11T10:57Z,"Just received this little amusing piece in the mail:


When his turn came to serve in Vietnam, Cheney used the marriage deferment to get deferred four times in a row. 

Then the law was changed such that marriage alone was not sufficient for a deferment, but one had to have a child as well. 

Nine months and a week later, Mrs. Cheney gave birth to their first child. No doubt the Cheneys must have been working hard for that first child:-) Must have been terribly hard work! Poor ol' Dick must have been exhausted! Richard too! Not to mention his wife! Richard's wife, that is. 

For this, he got his fifth deferment, thereby avoiding altogether the type of duty to which the current administration's policies have consigned over 150,000 of America's finest and bravest citizens. 

For which he has earned a cute little nickname that is popular among those who are presently serving: Five-Deferment Dick. 

Yes, as all conservatives will agree, the 1960s certainly were bad for America! Draft-dodging became a national pastime! And the stinky rotten influence of that decade is still with us, as we have not just one, but two draft-dodgers in the White House! What a disgrace!"
,PeakOil,2007-10-11T13:45Z,"""If you are a true believer I recommend that you take a day off and walk in the countryside. Breath the fresh air and relax and ask yourself when the US or UK ever had a government that could organise a piss up in a brewery let alone a conspiracy.""

Plenty of times, and often it gets exposed, just like 911.
i.e. cover up about the gulf illnesses they soldioers are coming home with, JFK assassination, Gold/Silver price surpression and selling of fiat currency as real money etc.

""Anyway, even if such a complex plan were possible it wasn't needed. You would have had the same politicial effect if the planes didn't quite knock all the buildings down""

It is possible, but obviously it was doen for maximal impact on peoples sentiment.
As stated by The Project for the New American Century a Pearl Harbor style event was needed to get the support for a US military expansion overseas. It also needed something frightening to get people to willingly give up their freedoms for security. 

Furthermore there could have been reasons to remove other ""things"" like traces of financial transactions, physical gold etc. (i.e. read about the derivatives that expired useless and the gold bars that was found in the tunnel under WTC5)
This is stuff that the PPT needs to keep the fiat currency gaming going and US dollar strong. 
(Although glad to see that they are loosing the game.  If only Ron Paul could become president the nation could get back to some descent and constitutional fiscal discipline)

No problem with a few thousand dead soldiers, tens of thousands with Gulf war syndrom (from depleted uranium and chemicals), unknown number of dead blackwater mercenaries (and other private ""security contractors"") 1.2 million dead Iraqis. Now they plan to repeate the same with Iran.
Still think these people had any hesitation sacrificing a couple of thousand during 911 to get the justifications for war?  A cheap price for these men."

Ahh yes, the world is indeed full of nutjobs. It is amazing how mindlessly people accept this garbage. Use your brain. The government can't keep anything secret, not wiretapping, nor toture, not anything. How would such a grand conspiracy involving thousands of people ever be kept hidden for more than a week or two before it was leaked to the New York Times?

If you decide to watch this ""fakeumentary the please do your self a favour and check out the links below and read some of the rebuttals to it to make sure you get to hear both sides to the arguments. And to find out how much the makers of this film got right (sadly, pretty much nothing other than the date the attacks occured), how much is unsubstantied rumors and hearsay (quite a bit) and how much is outright lies (all the rest).

,Ionize,2009-06-27T14:00Z,"I find it very sad that there are people that out there that actually believe the ""official"" version of 9/11 events.  There are overwhelming FACTS that 19 Saudi or Yemeni hijackers with boxcuttersDID NOT take down World Trade Towers.
As an American I find it repugnant that the entire Muslim world is smeared, branded as terrorists,  Iraq and Afghanistan invaded for unbelievably contrived reasons and railroaded for the 1. benefit of Israel and 2. benefit of American imperialism.
We all know the Patriot Act which pisses on the US Constitution was already written by 9/11.
Some people unfortunateley are manipulated by a very very clever MEDIA"
