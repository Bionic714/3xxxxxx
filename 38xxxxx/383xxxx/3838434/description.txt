June 2007, sees the launch of the latest album by Younger Brother, created by the psychedelic trance pioneer Simon Posford (Hallucinogen, Shpongle) and Benji Vaughn the mastermind behind Prometheus and The Egg. The pair team up once again to create their second album, a breathtaking album with stunning sound production, that takes listeners on an incredibly varied musical journey.

?The Last Days Of Gravity? is a unique melee of electronic, acoustic, and vocal music, running the gamut of beautiful, strange, catchy, psychedelic, melancholic, uplifting. Despite its consistently psychedelic tone, the album has a very human element to it, and you can sense the spirit and emotion that have gone into its creation.

The harmonic variety of ?Last Days? is particularly mesmerising. The bindingly riveting melodic lines provide echoes of Posford?s earlier work in Shpongle and Celtic Cross, as well as of his more recent collaboration with the legendary Alan Parsons. This album is no retro piece of work, however, with Posford and Vaughn?s legendary innovation resulting in a complex mix of styles that eludes genre-casting. Despite having no obvious dance numbers, ?The Last Days Of Gravity? provides enough levity to be the perfect soundtrack to the richness of daily experience.

Top all that off with stunning artwork by the legendary Storm Thorgerson (whose work has graced albums by Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, and Led Zeppelin, among many others), and there you have it ? the outside matches the inside. With ?The Last Days Of Gravity?, you have yourself another trendsetting, description-defying release from Twisted Records!
