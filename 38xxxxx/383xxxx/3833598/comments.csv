,ThatGirl89,2008-11-15T09:12Z,"Thanks Jo-Psyko for this great prgram.
But i would like to ask the 28 seeders at this time this simple question.

WHY THE FUCK DO YOU SEED IF YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO SEED @ 5KB OR LOWER.
FUCKIN LOSERS.

To all the ones who take the time to upload these programs, movies, and games I appreciate you dearly. Also, the ones who take the time to seed... although it really takes no time because you can simply do it while you download."
,matty22liverpool,2009-03-15T14:41Z,Cheers for the program Jo-Psyko. All you people seeding at 5KB and less just stop its fucking pointless u twats!
,Gibrann,2009-06-17T21:08Z,Thank you! works grate! 
,AbganExplor3r,2010-03-26T18:12Z,"Trend Micro says its clean. I have no idea what the hell Avast is saying...

Great prog! Thanks very much!"
,mammacalo,2010-08-26T01:42Z,"ThatGirl89

If there are 28 seeders it means that 28 x 5kb = 140 kb and that's not so bad...

,Llamaduck,2010-10-17T03:51Z,"@usrnme:

Something along the lines of
/ALARM SOUND
WOOOP WOOOOP WOOOOP!
VIRUS DETECTED
WOOOP WOOOOP WOOOOP!
?

That's the one reason I got fucking rid of Avast and switched to AVG. Oh, and it sucks monkey balls and says everything is a virus."
,keithasdf,2011-02-14T13:33Z,"@ Jo-Psyko
i found another rar- ""dictionary"" after unrar the original file.
do i have to install the dictionary somewhere or just leave it there."
,xiIix,2011-04-05T19:51Z,"ThatGirl89, you are a fucking moron. Go learn a thing or two about how the internet and torrents work, because there are so many god damn factors involved, that you blaming peers alone for your performance woes is akin to a racing driver blaming his slow lap times on his steering wheel. It's fucking retarded. 

I remember back when p2p was devoid of all of you posers and end-user assholes who don't know shit about networking. Man, was it a blissful place to be. Now, all of us have to deal with you pissholes bitching and moaning about how slow your downloads are. I really wish all torrent sites were super private and PURE invite only, then us veterans would have a place to trade in piece."

STOP FUCKING SPAM THAT LINK TO YOUR PROGRAMS PAGE!!!!

YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO HELP ANYONE, JUST TRY TO MAKE MONEY..."
,Gres,2011-06-12T12:12Z,Does not work with multi archived files :/
,vivatpb5776,2011-09-24T08:10Z,"Very impressed. Granted the speed of this application (28 passwords per second) leaves a lot to be desired. However, a brute force approach is a marathon, not a sprint.

It took ten days but this application found the most valid password for an eight-character password protected .rar file.

Thank you uploader."
,pcmorrowt,2011-11-18T19:47Z,"@invisghost - Norton 360 did detect a virus. HOWEVER, I am not sure if it is part of this torrent. The location it told me that the virus is in is C:\users\*your computer name*\appdata\roaming\cerberus\server.exe (Assuming you have Win7) - Like I said I dont know if it is part of this torrent or NOT.
