---------------------------------
""Blackenstein"" is an unbelievably amateurish romp that cannot even be considered true blaxploitation. It's got no action, and even worse, no attitude. Instead, this simply was designed to capitalize on the trend of inserting ""black"" into the names of famous monsters, like ""Blacula"" or ""Dr. Black & Mr. Hyde"". It's the kind of movie that was intended to play on the second bill of a drive-in feature, or draw people into a sleazy theater based on the title alone.
