Listen to each song if you can before you decide to cherry pick, that is download the whole torrent, this helps others who are using your download as a seed."

,stickypinkhavoc,2008-03-29T22:02Z,I'm a newbie and cannot figure out how to open these files properly. Is there any text included in the files? Any help would be much appreciated. Thnx.
,Archer_DRAW,2008-05-03T00:05Z,"Looking at the ( extensive ! ) Song List,
it seems aat least half the files are
 [Karaoke] versions  :-(
of the song in question ?

Not quite so exciting...

Nevertheless, this is a simply mindblowing Mega project, deserving Absolute Cred and deep respect !

Now I'll just have to savve up for a new HD and start dl ;-) !

Cheers !"

,gnj1958,2008-07-09T04:19Z,There's only one song in that bunch that I want. It's probably from vinyl (yuck). So I'm not gonna waste my time downloading 6G just for one song. Also there are plenty of popular hits from between 1908 and 2003 that are not in that collection.

You are right. This entire collection is RARed.  I might have done without the compression since it is already enormous, and because of the song selection.  However, I don't think this was meant to be a complete collection of every pop hit of the century.

P.S. if you can name specific hits that aren't part of the torrent and start with the letter B that were spinning in 1920, please endeavor to  enlighten us."
