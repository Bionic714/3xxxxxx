Based on the Elmore Leonard story, 3:10 TO YUMA is a riveting remake of the 1957 classic Western. It's the story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a down-and-out rancher who lost his leg in the Civil War. With a wife and two sons, he is struggling to put food on the table, and unable to make payments on his land. When the notorious gunman Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is apprehended nearby, a few local men are needed to escort him to the town of Contention so he can be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma Prison. Evans sees an opportunity to make some fast cash, and offers to help in exchange for $200.

Cast: Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Gretchen Mol, Peter Fonda, Vinessa Shaw
