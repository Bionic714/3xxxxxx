Spintwist Records and DJ Zosma presents ''Straight forward - the 1st          
compilation in the 'Straight Forward' series.                                
In the first chapter we take a small detour from the outdoor psy-progressive  
sound, and deliver a sizzling hot mix of well known high quality Spin Twist  
sound, a more, sexy club-oriented electro sound, definitely guaranteed to have
massive dancefloor appeal and certainly to be played by many DJ's in the      
months ahead.                                                                
DJ Zosma has carefully selected massive tracks by several heavyweights in the 
progressive trance scene like the Swedish masters Vibrasphere with an        
exclusive club version of 'Erosion', Germanys Vaishiyas, Day.Din and Fabio,  
Israel's Aerospace who teams up with Interzone's label owner DJ Creator well  
known for his DJ sets, to form part of exciting new duo 'Aero Creator'.      
Among the other acts we find Sense from South Africa, Odiseo and Ecliptic    
from Mexico, Inner State from Greece, and a new track by Serbian artist Duca, 
whose music has lately gained a lot of popularity with recent releases on    
Tribal Vision, Blue Tunes, Yellow Sunshine Explosion, Candyflip and Prestige  
(Iboga).
