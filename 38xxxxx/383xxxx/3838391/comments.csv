Apparently you bought this album online?
Along with a bunch of other songs, that totaled to about 260 Euro's ????...according to that online receipt you added to the torrent!?
Plus a video of who I assume is you, Patrick? :]
Speaking french...saying I don't know what.
Anyhow, confusing...bottomline, to all reading, it's a good torrent, worth uploading!"

remove this shitty video of yourself talking about a pyramidal scam...

At least, I'll tell people not to download it. Choose your downloads inside the torrent, you don't need the video."
