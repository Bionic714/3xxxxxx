Marion Zimmer Bradley - The Mists of Avalon

This file set is the complete unabridged recording of "The Mists of Avalon" on audio, which was
originally released as 4 separate audio CD volumes.  Preserving the 3 minute breaks would have
produced too many files so each CD was transferred to a single MP3 file,   Image files of each
book's cover art and back cover notes are also included.

Notes:
Stereo variable bit MP3 encoding was done for maximum quality with minimum file size.
I have only just started listening to this book at the time of posting.  If I run into any transfer
flaws I will post a revised file set at a later date.

Bugs:
Variable bit MP3 files can sometimes report incorrect track times on early model-version players.
There is only about 1/4 second of dead air time on the intro and exit of each track.  Some players
may clip the first or last spoken word, so I have left the original intro and exit disc number ID
announcements intact to act as a buffer
