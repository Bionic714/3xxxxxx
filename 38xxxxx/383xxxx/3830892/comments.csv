,fazul420,2008-03-19T20:15Z,where is the keygen i need the serial and the licences. i have it installed but its only theeval
,sevenboarder,2008-03-30T07:49Z,"Yea, I installed it and added the license files.  But today a window came up when I was opening up Ultiboard, and said I had seven days to activate all the programs.  So I tried to do that and the original generated key did not work.  So I just generated some new license files and that seemed to restart the period without activating.  So do we have to do this every month, or is there a permanent activation technique?  Appreciate any help!  thanks..."
