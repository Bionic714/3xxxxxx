National Instruments Circuit Design Suite software improves the design process by integrating capture, simulation, and layout in a single toolchain with NI Multisim Power Pro, NI Ultiboard Power Pro, and the NI Multisim MCU Module NI Multisim easily captures schematics that are immediately ready to be simulated. With interactive simulation, NI Multisim virtual instruments quickly investigate circuit behavior, while advanced SPICE analyses provide essential insight to fundamental design characteristics. 

The NI Multisim MCU Module completes the validation of the entire system with microcontroller co-simulation within the NI Multisim environment. 

NI Ultiboard provides flexible tools optimized for automated speed or precise control to efficiently design a PCB. Integration with NI Multisim helps you easily transfer schematics to PCB while backward and forward annotation ensures management of design iterations. You can export completed designs to industry-standard formats such as Gerber to fabricate a prototype. 

Complete the design process and validate your circuit by integrating prototype 
measurements acquired in NI LabVIEW or NI SignalExpress software with NI Multisim simulation.

To activate, use the keygen, generate a serial for your product, save the license file. 

Then use the NI License Manager, go to Options -> Install license file, and import the file you just saved. Repeat for any other products (aka, you need to do it three times - once for Ultiboard, once for Multisim, once for the MCU module).
