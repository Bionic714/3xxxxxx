,smd,2009-08-20T16:01Z,Would be nice with the other seasons if you have them :)
,kospel,2010-03-04T19:59Z,"can u upload season 2,3 and do have 5,6?or more?"
,ManQu,2010-03-28T22:48Z,"Thankyou for this torrent and yes i would like seasons 2,3,4 and 5.
 But season 1 on tv was for 13 episodes and then season 2 started with the mustang and continued to the 59 Chevy low rider ep 36
 I hope this is correct as i use Tv guides to keep
me upto date and to find specials and xtras that might happen.
  So i seasoned the files you seeded into season 1 and half of season 2."
,ManQu,2010-03-28T22:53Z,"ok seems IMDB has listed season 2 to the stingray and the ""make a wish "" car as season 3
  so now im more confused......."

Thanks"
