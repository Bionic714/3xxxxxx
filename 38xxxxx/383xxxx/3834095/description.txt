Sound Support 2 combines the art of beautiful listening with the latest findings of neuroscience. The sound patterns of each tape create the proper mental state for enhanced performance in each activity. Your Sound Support 2 tape is a full 90 minutes. Side one is music. Side two adds Neourophonic 360(tm) sounds that provide increased brain stimulation and enhanced sensory experience (best with headphones). Play your Sound Support tape while engaged in activity to fully realize its benefits. Michael McCarthy has assembled the best "new music" from a variety of talented musicians for your enjoyment:
Deep Sleep by Lon Bove
