[V],velvetfog,2007-10-09T23:29Z,"I have seen it. It is very well done.

A very worthwhile film."
,PeakOil,2007-10-10T11:29Z,"The only really interesting part was that about Emoto's water crystals (subway scene), but from what I understand his methods are highly questionable and he has refused to carry out 'double blind' tests. 
So in a sceptic world he's a fake until proven otherwise.
"
,worthajob,2007-10-10T17:45Z,"Emoto graduated from Yokohama Municipal University with courses in International Relations, and in 1992 he received certification as a Doctor of Alternative Medicine from the Open International University for Alternative Medicine in India, an unaccredited institute with minimal academic requirements.

ie - he is a doctor to the same extent as doctor fox the DJ

from wikpedia (not that reliable but hey this s the inernet)"
,FuckCopyrights,2008-01-09T11:24Z,"SPOILER: This is a piece of #%&! movie.

Only retards who believe in healing crystals and stupid shit like that, enjoy this pathetic shit."
,tgrmag,2008-01-31T21:19Z,"Fact science has proven that when you think about a shape or running or walking or any thing like that your mind and body react the same way as if you were aictualy doing it. 
Fact your body has a eletrical aura thats always around it and how your body reacts is based upon what you do both phsyicaly and mentaly so all there doing is talking about ways to help you improve your life with facts that science has allready proven and most religons knew thousands of years ago.  Why do you think that if given a natural chance most people in small tribes, like the native americans, could live of a hundred years or more??

worthajob and all like him/her try its teachings for a year, you will find your self alot better if you truly follow them"
,captrob,2008-03-06T23:01Z,"I've been experimenting with this stuff for many years now, and i can truely say, IT WORKS!!!

,pumpit,2008-09-04T15:02Z,good entertainment thank you for seeding - watching it does not hurt you - dwelling on it if you think it's negative does..
,Party Hampster,2008-11-14T01:41Z,There is no Enlish in here. It is a russian Dub. If you are Russian (or maybe just in a hurry? *grin*) This is for you. If you don't understand Russian get another version. Worth watching to draw your own conclusions. God help you if you believe everything on Wiki LMAO ...I read it on WIKI....IT HAS to be true!.more LMAO...Try to make up your own mind after you know what you think are facts. *grin*
,RequiemsFall,2008-11-25T23:51Z,"It's fucking quantum theory, you retards. It's all speculation, but what isn't? This is a wonderful movie in the sense that it's a POSSIBILITY, not a fact. Open your minds, and shut your goddamn mouths."
