July For Kings coves a wide range of original material with catchy melodies and hooks. What sets this group and album apart from most other stuff released nowadays is the fantastic songwriting of Joe Hedges, the lead singer, and the great arrangements of songs by July For Kings. "Normal Life" is my favorite song on the album
