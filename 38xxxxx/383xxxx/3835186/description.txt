Melanie Live At Carnegie Hall - Recorded February 2nd and 3rd 1973

This the complete 2-album LP recording of Melanie's legendary live "birthday" 1973 concert in Carnegie hall. This LP has been out of print for over 30 years and was never re-released on CD or made available (in it's entirety) for digital download. The recording includes 19 tracks including Babe Rainbow, Brand New Key, Psychotherapy, Beautiful People.

Encoding notes:
The Analog LP audio was loaded into Wave files with Soundforge 5.0.  The original live audience song transitions were preserved with simple hard edit cuts. The Wave files were then converted to MP3 using high bandwidth variable bit rate compression.

Bugs:
As the original owner of this LP, I have kept it in near-mint condition with only minor jacket wear to show it's age. This notwithstanding you will hear an occasional "tick and "pop" that so plagued the sub-standard vinyl used to press pop records in the 1970's.  The variable bit rate MP3 encoded files may sometimes incorrectly report run times on older players.
