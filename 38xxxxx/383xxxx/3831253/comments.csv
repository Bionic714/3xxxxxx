,Robin_Hood,2009-04-13T03:05Z,"If you think sound is out of sync you can play the movie with vlc-player. Then you delay the sound with ctrl+k, Audio delay up, and ctrl+l, Audio delay down. 
Read here http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=20260&
You find vlc-player at http://www.videolan.org/"
,admir89,2009-08-12T07:38Z,please seed.. thank you
,Atalaa,2009-10-24T22:42Z,Still out of sync (cannot correct it in VLC).
,BDolf,2009-12-21T20:32Z,"Most movies' sound isn't out of sinc. Because in those days good quality sound recording was expensive, they didn't really record it. All sounds were later redone in studios, also the sound FX. Allthough they do talk English in most movies, the sound you here is not from the set. And the (italian) producers did a lousy job syncing the individual recordings. Thats my theory on it anyway hehe listen to some of the explosion and other sounds ;-)

Some unemployed no lifer Bud & Terence fan could make it better using a program like Sony Vegas or Adobe Premiere. Too bad I still have a job, but you never no. Ain't got a life already. 

GRTX from NL thanks for uploading this stuff."
