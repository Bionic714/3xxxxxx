,X-PLODE,2007-10-21T01:58Z,"whats so hard about it? o_O

you use Alcohol 120% or Deamon Tools or whatever to make a virtual drive then you mount BOTH images on the SAME virtual drive(example G:) otherwise the second cd wont install(usually :/)

then just replace the exe with the one provided..."
,AlfyMasamune,2007-10-21T03:09Z,"Game works perfect!

Glad to see you have Sensei 2, i've noticed alot of people have been looking for that one.

,AlfyMasamune,2008-03-24T10:28Z,"wanderingshadowx, the file your trying to replace, right click it and go to properties, at the bottom it should say read only, uncheck the box, it should work then."

any help? anyone else have the same problem?"
[T],Hgames,2009-03-13T12:47Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4715337/Let_s_Meow_Meow Try my release and see if it happens. You might need to disable any joysticks you may have hooked up to your computer.
,RunninJin,2011-02-09T05:33Z,"Hey X-PLODE
When I tried to play this, I switched the file with the patch it came with and it said I had to reinstall it or something, wasn't hooked up to the internet on my laptop though, and the game was on my portable hdd. Did I do it right, cause I let it install everything, do I install the Vmate launcher thing?
Also, what happened to Hgames account? That guy had everything."
,burnordie,2012-04-19T05:20Z,"I tried right-clicking and unchecking read-only, but it tells me access is denied."
