Release Notes                                                                
Ananda Shake are back with their third studio produced album, 'Inside the    
Sound'.                                                                      
Following the success of their previously released two albums, 'Emotion in    
Motion' and 'We Speak Music', both released under Utopia Records.            
It is said the third time is always a lucky time and luck or not, the music  
and sounds inside this album is something different from whatever you have    
listened before in this scene.                                                
The intensive tours they had through the world promoting their two previous  
albums inspired them to create a new type of morning full on; perhaps the    
listener will come up with a name for this new kind of music, the point is    
that there are no words to describe the vibe inside the sound.                
Ananda Shake are two young Israelis, Osher Swissa and Lior Edri, who have    
been speaking Trance music for almost a decade. For the past few years they  
have been lifting dance floors and souls all over the world for the past few  
years being sure that there is no way how to not recognize their music.      
This album is the music they speak and that comes from inside Ananda Shake's  
sound.
