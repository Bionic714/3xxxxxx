Here are the first 5 albums by Bulgarian-born singer-songwriter Geri X. Also included is "Kiss On Both Eyelids" which was recorded live at The Globe Coffee Lounge in St Petersburg, Florida. Unfortunately, this song is in MP3 format (64 kbps) but all of the albums are encoded losslessly in FLAC format (16 bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz). Enjoy. :)
