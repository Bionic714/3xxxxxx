,pappacap,2007-11-20T05:02Z,hey I have this now how do i put it on my ipod?
,_blank,2007-11-24T05:31Z,"pappcap, ipod does not do xvid. you'll need to encode to mp4. i suggest encoding from the original xvid source however as I can't be sure of the quality."
,Christofferu,2008-02-13T21:05Z,"pappacap. i suggest you convert it in the ipod converer. search on googl, then download it. You have 2 do that with almost every dowload, to get it on your ipod."
