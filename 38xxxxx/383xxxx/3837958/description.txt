Curves, contours and body horns. A film celebrating 40 years of the 
Fender Stratocaster.

This is a new digitising of the same VHS file. I would say it is abt
10% better video then the first one posted. If you already have that 
one, don't bother. Do try to get the earlier version out of circulation.

Sorry about the inferior video quality. I had this film on VHS tape for 
more than 10 years before digitising it. It is a great film though. Far 
better than the one they did at 50.

I recorded this one off Swedish Television and the subtitles are in 
Swedish. The soundtrack is the original English.

I have searched wide and far for an original DVD or VHS copy of this
film, and would have been very happy to pay properly for it. But it 
seems there is none to be had yet. In the meantime, enjoy this!

And God bless Keith Richards!

It seems the chapters menus do not work at all.

This is obviously a Divx film. VLC will play it as well, but without
any menus at all.
