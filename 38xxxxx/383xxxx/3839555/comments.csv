Start seeding."
[V],velvetfog,2007-10-12T19:56Z,"One more thing, having joined some of your previous swarms, it appears that you are creating your torrents with a 1 MB block size.

You would get much better replication results in the torrent swarm if you used a smaller block size, such as 256 KB, or at most 512 KB."
,madmax999,2007-10-12T20:19Z,"Thanks.  As you can tell I'm new to torrents.  I have been using uTorrent and letting it do the auto size.  I'll set it to the smaill size on the next ones today (Up Periscope and Father Goose).

I've had it set to seed for the last 20 mins.  It looks ok on my side.  But it is not showing any activity.  And I see it says no seeders.  I'll kill it and restart."
,madmax999,2007-10-12T20:20Z,"LOL, but I did remember to lookup the IMDB this time."
,DrKoks,2007-10-12T20:36Z,Thanks !!!
,madmax999,2007-10-12T22:07Z,"Looks like it is working now.

The Professionals (lee marvin et.al.), the desperados (Glenn Ford) and Fort Apache (John Wayne) are coming but slowly.  Probably won't finish downloading on eDonkey for another week.  In the mean-time Up Periscope, Father Goose and First Spaceship On Venus will get posted today/tomorrow."

,paladin578,2008-05-01T03:33Z,oooops ` sorry and thank you for ending a frustrating search!
,jamester1492,2008-07-31T06:17Z,been trying to find this forever thanks this movie kicks ass.
,madmax999,2008-09-19T06:40Z,"I'm glad so many people like these movies.  I've been away for a while on family business.  I'll have some more classics starting in October.  Unfortunately I have to let folks catch some partials that have been hanging for a couple months (not so lol, sorry).

So good to be home. "
,madmax999,2008-10-01T04:26Z,"I appreciate the help seeding.  About two thirds of what I have posted always have TPB crew seeding, so I try to focus on the less popular ones that fall out of seeding.  It does make it harder for me to upload new stuff now that I'm spending so much time keeping some of these going.  But still, I think that most of the people that see my list understand if something falls out of seed for a few weeks while I post new oldies.

Once again, thanks for the help."
