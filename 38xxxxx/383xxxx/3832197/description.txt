The Alphabet of Pop is an MP3 collection built up over 50 years, from Dusty old 78 RPM fragile objects, Open Reel Tape to Compact Discs.  If the Song was a popular hit between 1908 and 2003 the chances are high it will be in this collection, lovingly brought to you in a series of Bit Torrent downloads, ONE for each letter of the Alphabet.   I have NOT compressed the files so you can read each item, file name by file name.

Most are sampled at 192Kbs or faster.  Some are very, very rare and based on the UK Hit Parade as published by the BBC over the years.

Rest Assured the TAGS are just fine, for this is a working collection used every week on a request based Discotheque show.   There may be the odd Karaoke song sneak in from time to time, but I have filtered most out, and not to worry, you will have the original hit version in this collection anyway!   Enjoy this and please keep it seeded, for I can NOT release the next letter of the Alphabet, until I am happy this one will live on, happily seeded so I can move on to the next release.

The Author of this lot started as a DJ back in 1967 but had a sizeable music collection even before then.  He still does a weekly request based show to this very day.   From the Dark Days of the Two World Wars you can relive the jitterbug and roaring twenties, move on to the Birth of Rock and Roll and the Fabulous Fifties, then enjoy the Sensational Sixties, the Glam Rock and the Woodstock Era of the Seventies, before getting almost up to date with the electronic of the Eighties and Ninety's before moving on briefly to the Noughties.... ;-)

YOU MUST SEED AT LEAST the same bit count you downloaded, that is a Ratio of ONE TO ONE.  IF YOU love music then keep it seeded, even if you can only give it 10Kb per second that is better than nothing and these legends of POP and Rock will live on.

   ENJOY!!!
