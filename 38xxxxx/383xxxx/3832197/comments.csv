[T],towerelect,2007-10-06T23:04Z,"OK my main (home) PC is busted, so seeding this on the Discotheque Laptop backup machine right now, and tonight I have to go out and do a Gig.. However the Pub is Wi Fi so I will try seed as the show goes on... (Don't you just love technology).

Some interruption of the Seed will happen in the next 7 hours but I will keep seeding as soon as this laptop gets home again until at least two other seeds are in the Swarm before I move on to the letter B in the Alphabet of Pop."
[T],towerelect,2007-10-08T17:55Z,OK managed to seed it for the past 24 hours and now there is a fair chance this one will manage without my help for a bit.  Thanks to all in the Swarm who are keeping it going.   I will now hash the second letter and post the torrent in the next few hours.   Watch out Part 2 and the letter B is coming soon!

Many thanks for all your effort and allowing us to download.
