,RakaDisciple,2008-01-06T10:20Z,"I would also REALLY like something like pbsyp was talking about. I have search alot and nothing with a plot exists that ive found, but ghetto gaggers is pretty decent. There are only two available thru TPB tho..."
,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2008-01-19T14:35Z,"Definitely this movie has his weird lame feel that looks cool. It was worth seeing...
Regarding the other movies that you posted FFF this is a masterpiece. If we look at those Nazi themed Italian low budget movies this is diamond."
