IMDB review..............


Quentin Tarantino has called this flick "the best porno ever".   The film is standard fare with a sprinkling of blaxploitation attitude. As a roughie, it's not rough enough. As a rape-driven thriller, it's pathetically inept. Sure it has a hip, laughable retro "groove" and some of the ebony dialog is pricelessly bad, but there are stretched passages of folks standing around talking "jive" and action scenes that must have been shot, all up, in ten minutes.
