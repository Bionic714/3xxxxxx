Overview: This martial arts spectacular showcases 20-year-old Erh Tung-Sheng (AKA Derek Yee). Even Variety noted: "Erh's charismatic screen presence should take him to superstardom like his older brother, David Chiang". The prediction proved correct, and his performance as ace swordsman Third Master is just what any producer would want. He fights evil, saves damsels in distress (including a kindhearted prostitute played by Chow Yun-Fat's first wife, Yu An-An), and duels rival swordsmen to the, well, death.
