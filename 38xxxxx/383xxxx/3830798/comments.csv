,keikenti,2007-10-05T18:59Z,"This is spam.

Once you unrar it you are told to visit and register with Spynova for the password."
,keikenti,2007-10-05T19:58Z,"Sorry, last comment is for the wrong release."
,Doomsdaymachine,2007-10-05T20:50Z,"Ok... ..Still Don't expect that this torrent is real...
I have serious doubt's about this one...."
,balancy,2007-10-05T22:20Z,"So to download or not to download that is the question :-)

Anyone got it down already, fake or good?

cheers"

,s331o,2007-10-05T23:22Z,Isn't it a funny coincidence that the torrents you have doubts about are always in RARs and never have a sample? ;)

,swear,2007-10-06T09:35Z,"Yeah it's a fake. Somebody please DDoS Spynova or something, that site really sucks. Lame spammers."
