Every now and then we come across something a little bit different, and this time I think its true. This isn?t just another File Manager blow off, this seems to contain everything we all wish Windows Explorer had. You can either read below, or on their website, but the program contains, to name a few, a text file viewer, a video player, an image viewer and a flash player, plus much, much more! This release comes in at just over 5mb, and comes with a keygen.
