Virus in Keygen and nothing else.

Just dont use the keygen"
,Master_Yeti,2010-01-15T15:50Z,"You people are idiots.  Keygens will trigger an alert because by nature they are bypassing security in software.  This is what they are made to do.  I would be more concerned if your antivirus did not pick it up.

You seriously need to learn what a false positive is and if you don't want to use software with keygens that give a false positive then go and buy the damn thing.

Help me...please...I am surrounded by them!!!"
,antiskiZm,2010-01-21T15:59Z,"Master Yeti,

While I chuckled when I read your comment and tend to strongly agree, a virus scan on the keygen reveals a win32:spybot(trj).

Skiz"

,vene45,2010-10-09T23:18Z,"It's a virus don麓t download. I installed it in a computer and lose the internet conexi贸n and what is worst you can麓t uninstall it. 
Es un puto virus, no se puede desinstalar y se pierde la coenxi贸n a la red una vez instalado."
,simonbromilow,2011-07-02T08:55Z,"Haha, you idiots think a VIP member like webchella is going to upload shit, some people are so thick, thanks webchella the software works a charm, of course the keygen shows as win32 virus because it generates things but some people are dumb."
,Cracker_Jak,2011-08-20T16:01Z,"Run the key-gen sand-boxed, some people!!!!!"
,GTecH-AG,2012-02-04T20:33Z,"@ All Donkeys
