You cant upload a game then don't seed. There are so many people stuck on 72.4%. Just seed until someone reaches 100% then they can take over"

,James13,2007-10-19T08:38Z,"Wow, your a cock toast200.

The game is crap, the graphics are awful. No other word to describe it. It doesnt even look as good as rugby 2003 on ps2.

I would suggest looking at the graphics somewhere before downloading this."
