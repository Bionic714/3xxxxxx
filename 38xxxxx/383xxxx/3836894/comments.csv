can you give me a step-by-step instruction on how to INSTALL this game? and when i say step-by-step, i mean starting from the moment i finished downloading this.

pleeeeaaaaaaaase!!!!!! i'd even kneel on both knees!!!! please help me!!! i don't see an installer anywhere in this file!!! just:

mdf. and mds. files on both cds

again, i BEG for your wonderful guidance..."
,X-PLODE,2008-02-08T20:26Z,"well im pretty bored(waiting for a download)...so il explain :P

after download install winrar and unpack
then install alcohol 120% and make 1 or 2 ""virtual drives"" then load the .mds onto the virtual drive and install...

or you can make a virtual drive with other programs like daemontools or nero or even with windows xp(if your an expert)

then just replace the exe with the one in the smaller .rar file...thats it"

,X-PLODE,2008-02-22T14:41Z,"do NOT install virtual mate
then just put the exe in the small .rar file in your gamefolder

if you installed virtual mate then uninstall the game and re-install it WITHOUT virtual mate checked"

,audiocode,2008-05-31T11:36Z,"Hello, I'm having a problem installing this game.

After downloading it, I unzipped it and used Alcohol 120% to mount the the .MDS files. I double-clicked CD1.MDS and got the install screen. I checked only 'Game Application' (no DirectX or V-Mate) and it installed fine until 57%, where it stopped and asked me to insert the CD.

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"
,audiocode,2008-05-31T14:10Z,"Wow, I am an idiot. Problem solved. 

Solution: Unmount CD1 and mount CD2 to continue installation. Not like anyone else would be unable to figure it out. "

,LordLouis,2008-12-20T05:17Z,"I seem to be having a problem with all G-Collections games. I can install and get the cracked .exe in fine, but when I run the game it scrolls through menu very fast and makes it almost impossible to press any of the buttons (let alone the button that you want). So far I've had the problem with this & Let's Meow Meow.

Anyone else have the same problem or a fix?"

,robertoII,2009-06-04T09:04Z,"for those who are having problems with installing this game:

1. after installing the game, go to gamecopyworld.com to find the ""no-cd patch"" of this game. if you're too lazy to find it, here: http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2005&f=pahn-foh!rar

2. after downloading the file, open it with winrar and extract that file to the gamefolder of ""Figures of happiness""... and don't worry, let it overwrite it.

3. then, try your luck if it will work. worked on me. ^_^"
