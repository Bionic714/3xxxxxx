This unique title collects together four previously unreleased wartime films featuring the Supermarine Spitfire. Together, they offer a detailed, close up look at the aircraft as operated by the RAF throughout the war years. 

'The Daily Inspection Of A Spitfire' provides a technical walkround of the Spitfire MK I, while '1940's Re-Arming' shows the rapid re-fuelling and re-arming of a flight of Spitfires. 

'Spitfire' is a 1944 aircraft recognition film packed with great footage of the Mark I, V, XIV and XXI and Seafire. 

Finally, written by Air Marshal Sir Phillip Joubert in 1940, 'Fighter Pilot' is a short film celebrating the Spitfire at the height of the Battle of Britain.
