EddieMaintence Boot CD

I just had to buy this because I couldnt find it here. It is a awesome tool. Great for Tech people like myself. Load Win98 without a floppy. Has lots of great programs on it and cd drivers for most all computers for using a external cd rom drive. Great for older laptops and computers without a floppy drive. It saved me a ton of time. I have gotten alot from this site least I can do is give some back.
