Rare 80s - Feat. A Drop In The Gray - Certain Sculptures [1985]

A Drop In The Gray were an 80s new wave/rock band. Certain Sculptures was released in 1985 and is one of the best albums of this style that came out in the 80s. New wave/rock bands of that era had a certain formula; guitars and synths and melodic tunes. Certain Sculptures is a must have album and just goes to show how much good stuff came out in the 80s but left unnoticed and neglected.
