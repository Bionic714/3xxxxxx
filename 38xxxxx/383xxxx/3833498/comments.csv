,Xenity,2008-06-07T22:55Z,"Linux users can convert one of these 'VP7' files to a VLC-playable AVI file with this one-liner:
mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o /dev/null && mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:bitrate=950 -o destinationvideo.avi

Change 'somesourcevideo.avi' and 'destinationvideo.avi' to the input and output files respectively.  Requires 'mencoder' to be installed.  For batch processing, see the script on this page:

,CaptainBeefheart314,2008-07-09T11:36Z,"Hello, just a brief word of thanks to KEGGERMAN, this is in fact the nicest torrent for The Simpsons that I've come across. Have 'em all now, but I'm slightly concerned... aren't you going to continue, adding seasons beyond number 8? You should see the absolute rubbish, I've been sifting through as of season 9 (though I did find a rather nice one just now).

One tiny correction perhaps: since you're using the VP7-codec, which is really rather nice but not a true all-rounder: VLC Media Player does not support VP7 in it's current or previous versions, and according to the VLC Wiki they will not start any time soon... so please do not advise your loving fans that once installed, VP7 will run on ANY player they've installed: it will NOT... except you use the clever Linux-trick of course, but thats a luxury most users won't have  ;-)

Anyway, that being said: your rips ROCK, man, so thanks again!

BG"

,genghis69,2008-11-13T15:20Z,"Hey man, many thanks for the upload. Have downloaded and seeded 2:1 but can't get it to play on Mac. Anyone got any ideas?"
,Pujan7,2009-01-23T21:16Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent !
I have already downloaded and watched 7 complete Seasons ripped by Keggerman, and currently I am downloading the 8th Season.
All you have to do is to download VP7 Personal Edition (Free) Codec here: 
http://www.on2.com/index.php?615
And enjoy the good Video and Audio quality.
Many thanks to Keggerman
I am looking forward for next seasons."

,abbigss,2010-01-25T23:57Z,"Good Quality but the codec sucks.. It cannot be watched on any divx player...

Here is the vp7 codec:

or,

Virtualdub recognizes vp7 after installing its codec.  

You can convert any format you want.."
