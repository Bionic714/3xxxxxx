the idea to hound Homer for a pool which they relentlessly do until he caves in
and buys them one. All the kids in the neighborhood come by to use it. Bart tries
to jump from his tree house into the pool, but winds up breaking his leg. He will
have to spend the rest of the summer in a cast, so there will be no more swimming
for him. He watches as Lisa becomes incredibly popular. Bart finds himself a new
hobby by spying on the neighborhood with Lisa's telescope. While looking out the
"Rear Window" of the house, Bart thinks he's seen Flanders commit a murder. He 
gets Lisa to break into Flanders' house and look for clues. He watches as 
Flanders returns home with an axe. He goes to help her, broken leg and all. Then
