Stargate Atlantis 0404 is coming 19th of October!
asshole..."
,Devinius977,2007-10-12T15:11Z,"mattyger you stupid SOB!
First 4 episodes leaked out... That episodes were given to the some news to rate them and write something good about the show.
Only diference is that there is no fx sound in them....
That is what makes them interesting. 
Example. When doors close you can hear sound of 2 wood plates hiting each other, etc...."
,matttyger,2007-10-12T18:17Z,"Devinius, multiple things:
I shout b4 I read, so I didn't read this was a leak out, second, this does have fx sound.
But if the first 4 leaked out.. where is number 3?..."
,tomdoodle,2007-10-13T08:40Z,"Hi Jofall,

please understand that especially the highly popular stargate atlantis episodes have been spamed with fake torrents from spynova and tracking attempts recently - so it's only reasonable that people get sceptical, especially with episodes ""out of the line"".

As you can see, rippin clarrified things and I too tried to put things in the right perspective.

That of couse doesnt excuse Scanias post, if this torrent is indeed the real thing.

If you want things not to be ruined for the seeder, you can also ease up things by providing information yourself initially especially when dealing with some ""out of the line"" thing like this extra-episodes.

Before the season startet, some even posted the also leaked and unfinisched episodes - without SpecialFX and SoundFX.

If some of the uploaders there would have explained it just a little before uploading here, they would have prevented a lot of anger and disappointed flaming.

When I saw your upload I was wondering if this would be a fake, an unfinished rudimental leaked one or the real thing and considering the recent events and uploads with stargate atlantis episodes it was more than reasonable to question and challenge the upload before just grabbing anything thats just fed to us here."
