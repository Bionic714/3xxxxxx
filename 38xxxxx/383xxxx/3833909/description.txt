My Wife and I have struggled with weight loss since we had our first child 20 years ago. We've done all the fad diets over the years. Yeah, they all work but they are not easy to stick to. So its a terrible cycle that repeats. We get on a hot new diet or weight loss program and lose, then we can't stick to the program and we gain. I like this ebook because its a weight loss program so easy, we've been with it for over a year now.
