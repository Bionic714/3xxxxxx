,malouct,2007-10-11T15:54Z,"viland, its very easy to figure out you control one or more heroes an you build an army from your castle and defeat the other players. "
[T],Geedunk,2007-10-11T22:11Z,"Mhm, try to delete the file and unrar it again. Just click the exe file named Heroes3.exe, and it should work perfectly. I've got no problems with saving or playing. Never crashed."

I would still appreciate help on how to fix this if anyone else has had and fixed this problem."
,J05H_DApb,2007-11-10T08:36Z,"Never mind, I've fixed the problem. It turns out there was a copy of every single file in the MP3 folder. 

How they got there I have no clue.

Awesome.

I this is the game I think it is(maybe it is IV) Then I wanna blow you a kiss :D Play'd this with my friend a lon time ago"
,tju2an,2007-12-23T23:28Z,"Well, I saw that some1 didn't know what to do. Here's a guide:

1: Searh googl for something named winrar, you can get a free version that is really good. Install all formates, especially RAR and ZIP!

2: Now you should see that your icon that you have downloaded (This Computer\Documents\Downloads is uTorrents map, check your prog) is shown as some books with a belt around it.

3: Right click on this icon and choose ''Extract Files''. Extract them to your desktop by choosing a map that already exist there and change last word to anything else like ''Homam''.

4: After that your files has been extracted to the map, you shall find a new map that u havn't seen before on your desktop.

5: Open it

6: Now I dont know whats in this map, still downloading, but...

6.1: Find an icon with .exe name. Click on it.
6.2 Find an icon that is opened with ms-dos. CLOSE AL PROGRAMS THAT YOU ARE RUNNING BEFORE! then wait until installed.

7: Open with the created start icon that have popped up on your desktop or in your map.

8: Click on it

9: ENYOY! :D

Hope this helped. It was kinda hard to describe without the prog in front of me. Good Luck! "
[T],Geedunk,2007-12-24T00:59Z,"It IS III, not IV.
- Thanks for the guide, allthough mine would be easy enough xD"
,tju2an,2007-12-24T13:16Z,You are welcome :)
,natchflux,2007-12-27T16:42Z,"Thanks Geedunk for the post, but I have a lame lame problem with the game -

whenever I try to end my turn, the game just crashes =\ please help!"
[T],Geedunk,2007-12-27T23:40Z,I have no idea why. Try putting different settings or reinstalling. My game never crashes.
,natchflux,2007-12-28T02:28Z,I seriously hope it works now.. just finished redownloading it.
,natchflux,2007-12-28T02:46Z,"AGH IT DOESNT WORK

This is seriously annoying me...

I'll try it on another comp and see if it works"
[T],Geedunk,2007-12-28T12:06Z,"Ok, last thing to try: Try downloading the program Registry Mechanic from PCtools. Find a serial on any serial site, and put it in. Run a scan and fix the problems - try to re-run the game.

If it doesn't work, I have no idea why - it must be your computer."
,Jebsen,2007-12-29T23:45Z,"Ehm, the game is wery good ;)..... but NONE of the cheats work.... can some1 tell me why or what to do different ? :=)"

,Jebsen,2007-12-30T00:09Z,The ones i found on Cheatplanet.com....... Fks: nwcfleshwound......other 1 :nwctim............and :nwcdarthmaul
[T],Geedunk,2007-12-30T00:38Z,"Well, it's because this isn't Heroes of Might and Magic III - It's Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death.

Therefore, no cheats for HIII works, however, http://www.cheatscodesguides.com/pc-cheats/heroes-of-might-and-magic-iii-shadow-of-death/ does.

Hope it works for you (;"

[T],Geedunk,2007-12-30T22:46Z,"Well, all the peers, that I'm connected to, has 500kb/s or over, so I think it's your conc.

[T],Geedunk,2008-01-22T12:09Z,"Lots of people seem to have issues with saving data - I, however, haven't got a problem. When school is over, I'll try to figure out what the problem is. Somehow, I think it's because of the Saved Game data in C:, but I'm not completely sure.

- If anyone has got any ideas, please say so.

I'll try to work something out."
,vinidivici,2008-01-22T14:34Z,"Okay geedunk. Maybe here's something strange. I have the original CD :Restoration of Erathia. So firsr i installed it and i copied all of your files to the  files that i installed from my original CD (Rest. of Erathia). You know what...IT WORKS, now i can save my game. Anyway, thank you very much.Been a long time i looked for the expansion."
[T],Geedunk,2008-01-22T19:45Z,"Ok, I know what the issue is. Regular games normally installs a folder called ""Games_name"" with a folder called ""Saved games"" or ""Profiles"".

Open the folder called Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete -> Look for a folder called ""games"". If you can't find it, make a folder called ""games"" and one called ""saved games"" - NO CAPITAL LETTERS!

Open the folder called Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete -> Look for a folder called ""games"". If you can't find it, make a folder called ""games"" and one called ""saved games"" - NO CAPITAL LETTERS!

If you already got one, you should be able to save. Remember, that you can't load multiplayer games in scenario, and the other way around.

Please let me know by posting here, if this helped you saving.

I hope it solves the issue :) "

When i get such an error in ONE game, i can't play ANY fullscreen game.
With ""ANY"", i mean: 
Heroes 3 of M&M
Heroes 4 of M&M
Elastomania (yaaay)
World of Warcraft

,Yazzil,2009-04-06T01:05Z,"Thanks for the game Geedunk, it's been ten years, so I would give you a hug...but that would be a little hard through an internet cable lol.

Works perfectly."
,Yazzil,2009-04-06T03:39Z,"Eh, finally found a problem, I get an error message that HoMaM needs to close when I try to play a custom map, the same when I try to do a random map."
,Yazzil,2009-04-10T04:21Z,"Worked on the random map problem, the random map that I was trying to get to work became corrupted somehow, but now the random map generator (along with the maps generated) is working without any hitches.

Can't get the custom map to work, will try fiddling with it tomorrow, then just try to re-download if it doesn't work."

So, when I downloaded this torrent, there was two rar-files, HMIIIGOLD_CD1 and HMIIIGOLD_CD2. I extracted them both, and there is no Heroes.exe-file. I tried to install the game, and turned it on and it says that I don't have the Shadow of Death-CD. What I did wrong?"

Though if u can put some input on how to play online with some friends, Id really appreciate it.

When I try to play I have the windows firewall and router disabled and I have port forwarded the following ports.

TCP/UDP	47624 - 47624
TCP/UDP	6073 - 6073 
UDP	15668 - 15668
UDP	38628 - 38628
UDP	1948 - 1948
TCP/UDP	2300 - 2400

But then I host the game and my friends cant see it..

Thanks in advance"
,KinsonRavenlock,2009-07-07T18:25Z,It may not be a bad idea to try setting your desktop to 16bit color. I've heard that fixed the issue for some people. btw thanks man I spent a few yrs of my life playing this game online on msn gaming zone in a ladder tourney brings back memories ;)...
,maxjohn909,2009-07-07T22:35Z,"So everything seems to be working fine, but when I try to save it it says ""could not save 'file name'"" It also does the same thing with the Autosave. Is there somthing I should do?

How much space does it save to use this instead? (IE: how big is it once extracted?)

If I use WoG without the CD, what else am I missing apart from the movies?

,Scampie7,2010-01-13T18:07Z,"nvm, found the solution.
You just have to make a folder ""games"" in the directory ;)."

,Nemo_Russia,2010-02-21T21:53Z,"For all of those still searching for a solution for the NO MUSIC problem, and for all of those who just encountered it - here is the solution: Do not extract your game to the ""My Documents"" folder, instead do it in the root of your C disk, or any other for that matter.This should work for everybody. Now enjoy your game with the music!!! Cheers! :-)"

,maaginen,2010-11-03T14:33Z,"The Game works great for me, but I still have a small annoying problem. When I finish a campaing, there should come a ""check mark"" in the picture of the campaing.

Any ideas on how to fix this?"

,Kaz327,2011-03-29T03:09Z,"Kudos to you geedunk and all the seeders I'm downloading it now!

I'm glad to see fixes about saving, random maps, music, and cheats great job guys. 

Only issue that seems to be bugging people is the online function of the game. Hope to get a fix on this.

Btw, if you're looking for more features of HOMM3 try this fan made expansion: Wake of Gods.

,stevenash13beast,2011-04-04T23:16Z,"this game is great. Thank you for the upload. one little problem, for some reason, i cannot use adventure spells. When i click on them, the game won't let me use it. Anyone got a solution? "
,awefui391,2011-04-08T15:49Z,"Thanks for the torrent!

I have a strange bug, which is partly what stopped me playing the game a few years ago as it was happening then (from original install CD, latest patch). Every week one of the two heroes you can recruit from the tavern should be from your town type. ie if you're Castle, you should have Cleric or Knight appearing once every week.

In my case, it seems to go wrong on the second level of a campaign. On level 2 of the first Good campaign of the original RoE campaigns, it's always giving me Ranger heroes.

It's a big annoyance, and a complete game-breaker when you're on one of the Evil campaigns where you have to collect something like 1000 skeletons; the inability to have a hero (of undead town type) who can do the resurrection thing where dead opponents turn to skeletons makes it virtually impossible to complete that level.

Anyone recognise the bug and have any suggestions? "
,ebeninamialisami,2011-04-23T17:44Z,"thanx for the torrent. i have downloaded last week and played single player. but i am bored and wanted to play multiplayer online. i have tried playing it on ""gameranger"". but it asked for cd ! it wasnt asking for it when i played single player. i found an exe fix on google but it did not help neither..so is there a way to play this online? thanx"

,fagju,2012-01-11T09:20Z,"Haha, sorry sometimes I forget that not everyone is techsavy hahaha.

You need to open the windows task manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete) then select processes then HEROES3.exe then right click then Set Affinity then remove all the ticks except for CPU0

,fagju,2012-01-12T04:47Z,"can you find the file in your folder?

the savegames are in
D:\Programs\3DO\Heroes 3 Complete\games

so if you can find it there you should also be able to find it in the game.

it has pretty recent stuff."
