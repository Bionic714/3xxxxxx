,duns2068,2007-10-10T21:57Z,"you must install codec ratDVD, with ratDVD to turn it to DVD and later to burn it or can it be played with Windows Media Player, KMPlayer etc.

ratDVD takes a full featured DVD movie and puts it into a highly compressed .ratDVD container format file - while preserving all the features of the original DVD such as: 

-Full anamorphic picture, seamless branching, multiple video angles, multiple audio channels, subpictures, etc. 
-Keep movie versions (Directors Cut, Theatrical version, etc.), Alternate story endings, making of, video commentary , cut scenes, etc.. 
-Keep complete menus, navigation and features 
-Reliable high quality, valid check-summed container. 

You can also convert a .ratDVD file back to DVD format, burn it to a DVDR and watch the movie using a regular DVD player. 

ratDVD supports metatags similar to ID3 tags in MP3 files. The metatags can contain information about the movie, such as title, actors, year of release, plot outline etc. It can even include a thumbnail of the DVD cover. The information for the tags is automatically retrieved from IMDB. "
