,Meho Krljic,2007-10-12T08:06Z,"Yeah, thanks!!! Just wondering, is this the American edition or scanlation? And if it's American is it the censored first edition?"
,shouzo,2007-10-12T10:35Z,"This is the scanlation, translated into English/American, so nothing is tainted or have any depictions in it(or so I have seen).
And thanks for the praise folks:P"
,Meho Krljic,2007-10-12T22:50Z,"Cheers man, good stuff, I'm seeding it as we speak. "
,Minerva.TheGift,2007-11-14T18:44Z,"Thanks for the Torrent! After unpacking (can't remember if it was .zip or .rar) I now have 3 folders, one for each volume.  The scans of each page are aprox. 800x1600, and about 2 or so per volume are in color (the cover page or something, I presume)  I read through most of the first volume so far...a very strange but interesting story.  Anyways, everything seems to be in order with the torrent so I just wanted to let everyone else know that this is legit :D

,shouzo,2007-11-15T19:03Z,"You're welcome Minerva.TheGift.
All my uploads will be in .zip or .rar, cause then people download the whole pack. I try to sort them out by volumes(if I know which chapters should be in each volume), or else it goes into regular chapters. When I'm gonna upload I'm going trough a quality-check to see if it's not double up of some chapters or pages(but it might be some anyway).
I upload anything of manga(mostly finished) and unknown manga for most people(some known btw) to get people to read more manga. People sees manga as a child thing, like superheroes-comics from Marvel or things like that. But I wanna show people that manga has much more widely groups. Do you see any kids or guys who live with their mom reading Goth? Death Note? X-day? no?
You might see someone(or know anyone), but these comics are a much more widely phenomenon that, literally, everyone reads:P"
,iamnobody555666,2007-11-18T03:06Z,is this the ragnarok manga that inspired the MMORPG ragnarok online?
,shouzo,2007-11-18T12:45Z,"I highly doubt it, I haven't played Ragnarok online, but I'm pretty sure this is a standalone project:P"
,BStun,2008-05-27T09:48Z,"Thanks for the upload! Why is it no one ever seeds? I've been waiting for a few weeks, but no one ever seeds once they finish....Oh well I finally started my dl it should be done in about 9hrs....I promise to help seed once done but I really hope this is worth the wait."
,shouzo,2008-06-28T00:59Z,"Good to see that I recieve some grateful comments:) I hoped this was worth the wait, and sorry for the few seeders...
If I had uploaded some Marvel, then I would have plentyful of seeders, but since this is 'just' manga that few people will read. Cause it's 'foreign' and doesn't involve superheroes in pantyhose and has an archenemy that looks even more ridicoulous...
Well enough of that. 

My uploads aren't maybe one of the famous ones like Naruto, One Piece, Bleach and so on. But these are too quality mangas, differences between gore, voilence, sex, blood to sweet, love and humor. 

You'll propably find something of your interest in here, just look at the description and download.

And remember, if you like it, buy the books/merch to support the creators, please. I did anyway;)"
