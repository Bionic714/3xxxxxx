,bw41101,2008-02-15T16:51Z,"It's all very well saying that the serial number exists within the torrent, but if you can't get to the point (within the program) where you can use it then it's not a lot of use is it? In view of this, would somebody who has unlocked the program kindly inform the rest of us just how to actually apply the serial No? Cheers."

,djdrj,2010-06-10T23:07Z,"here are a couple of institution id's i found through google. not sure how they work or if after entering it wether or not someone has to approve you rom the institution. i think each id will have different options because of different teachers,institutions, ect. not sure about any of this but here are 2 that i found, i have not tried either though. first is:
S3402253
can be found here:http://csc.colstate.edu/mcqueent/SeatedClassGeneral/SAMseatedClasses.htm

second is:
S3313573
can be found here:homepage.smc.edu/geddes_james/cis1/SAM2003FAQ.doc 
i'm sure there are more if you just search google they arent hard to find. Good Luck to everyone..."
