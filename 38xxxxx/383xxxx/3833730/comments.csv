""George Lucas""

-- Thanks to this restoration, it will now be impossible to find (in any decent quality) the far, far superior bold & brassy (as befitting a war-western) score that theater and TV audiences have heard for forty years.

The new score is adequate for incidental background music -- but not the title credits."

,Loachdriver,2008-05-03T23:39Z,"Yes this turd has hard coded subs; also is MP3, NOT AC3.  Don't waste your bandwidth."
