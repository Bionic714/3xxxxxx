It actually reminds me a bit of the swedish defeat againt Belarus in the hockey world cup some time ago, when the swedish captain (Sundin) cried like a baby in front of the world. 
The Belarus captain were also in tears, but the grin on his face told a different story and he was totally incoherent, raving on about how they now had to rebook the plane tickets.

Sadly for New Zealand, this isn't the first time they've caved under pressure."

No once again New Zealand has failed to win the cup but this game was stolen from them."
