,Nostro333,2008-02-13T19:17Z,is this the old cartoon movie ?
,Divine_Bob,2008-02-18T23:19Z,"Wouldn't play on Windows media player or DivX, won't be seeding"
,fuzznutz84,2008-03-14T06:38Z,"to everyone who keeps saying... this won't play on la de frekin da player. Have you guys ever thought about downloading some codecs? I know it might kill some of you to dish out a couple bucks, but you just might have to pay for a program to watch these things on. It's crazy isn't it. lol. Also it would be nice if you put as much effort into actually looking for a program as you do whimpering and bitching."
,Hoop66,2008-04-04T19:52Z,"heh.

you tell em fuzznuts. Whining pansies."
,Chottie06,2008-04-24T00:16Z,"Great download! It plays wonderfully on VLC player. It is the full version of Disney's Lion King with a new song ""The Morning Report"" added to it."
[T],ooStevo,2008-04-26T10:55Z,"yeah,this is the special edition.perfect quality as well.thanks kali yo."
,ender2188,2008-05-15T01:24Z,Get GOM player you fucking noobs.
,putneyboer,2008-05-18T09:53Z,aaargh..the morning report! where can i find the original?
,quickness321,2008-06-03T23:27Z,"Hey it plays the video just fine, but the audio is missing? why is that? please tell me what audio codec to look for if that is the problem? thanks!"
,sumore,2008-06-15T10:33Z,I used to have the same problem. You have to download CCCP Codec Pack. You can download it at http://www.cccp-project.net/
,DarthKalEl,2008-06-28T21:57Z,"you just need to download VLC and it will have all the codecs you require. I have never had a program that it couldn't play. WMP sucks, it hardly plays anything. and avs isn't that great either especially when you have to pay for it. VLC is FREE. I use core aac and k-lite codec packs and never have a problem."
,haXK_KiNdeR,2008-07-07T19:21Z,"nice,, thx : ) "
,xwxcrazyloki,2008-07-08T10:38Z,"Search up ""xp codec pack"" and ""xvid codec"" and then download both of them."
,orsoncart67,2008-08-02T19:40Z,"IS IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO LISTEN???
VLC IS FREE!!! that means F.R.E.E NO CASH, MONEY BEER TOKENS- I'TS FREE 


sorry for the rant but..........wtf?????"
,stardustanna,2008-08-21T21:52Z,please seed.... thank you :)
,SLIMZ33,2008-09-21T13:22Z,"to any one having problems playing vid files on vista, i strongly recomend downloadin ""VISTA CODECS"" by shark oo7.
I to use to have problems playin certain video files until i found this codec, and since then its been plain sailing, as he has compiled all of the best codecs into one,which means this is the only codec(vid/movie file player) you need on your operating system, now all files play through windows media player every time. look for shark 007 vista codecs download, and just make sure its a secure site, as you can get it from a few diff sources. so far it has played anything iv thrown at it,hope this helps!  
ONLY FOR W/VISTA"
,SilentDis,2008-10-10T07:57Z,"I have a better suggestion.  Switch to Linux.  Less overhead, does virtually everything Windows can do, better (including 90% of games thanks to Wine).  Codec support is a lot easier (usually just grab a gstreamer package or 2 for deb and yum based systems)."
,BubblyBoom,2008-11-19T21:10Z,"the sound is off, comes earlier than the picture..."
,ThePoliticsOfStarving,2009-01-13T10:53Z,"""oh, download this codec!"" ""Hey guys, get this great codec pack!""

Bullshit! I have never ever downloaded codecs and I have NEVER had a problem watching ANY video. Just download VLC player and stop crying about it."
,Nishant345,2009-01-16T07:53Z,"Ppl here scare me.. Sum say the audio is out of sync.. WTF.??

Can't everyone be clear.??"
,True-Haven,2009-01-17T02:53Z,"@ Nishant345 and everyone else confused

VLC player will play this and EVERY other video that you download.. Its it in AVI format so Windows Media player will not play it.

VLC IS THE WAY TO GO TO WATCH IT PERFECTLY.. Got it noobs?"
,giever,2009-01-31T19:35Z,"Jesus Christ. Do you even know what codecs are? Most people here aren't suggesting dudes pay money to play this. They -are- suggesting a setup that will play essentially everything, and not suck, like VLC does. VLC's playback is horrible, if you've ever tried to seek in it, you'd know it just has artifacts all over the place.

Stop calling people noobs, man."
,CARTOONCANCER,2009-03-11T09:48Z,"I seriously can't believe how fucking retarded people are in general! hahaha   How in the hell are you people even able to download movies and pretty much everything your pathetic little minds can fathom using torrents... Then, actually type on here that you don't know how to play back the fucking movies you downloaded??? Ahahahahahahaha   Go hang yourself if your to fucking dumb and or lazy to teach yourself the simplistics of the devices your trying to exicute... Die, Die!!!  You simple fucks! Listen to some TOOL and change your ignorant brains stupid!"
,tristan_mitch,2009-03-11T16:13Z,is this the original movie or the one that added couple more scene's ??
,joe_83,2009-04-19T16:51Z,"For those of you who seem to need to use windows media player just download Any Video Converter. Follow the instructions and convert the movie to whatever format you like. Jeez, that was hard!"
,Thorbears,2009-05-21T21:15Z,Great quality
,karleen,2009-12-09T23:12Z,"I actually had trouble with the audio on this one  as well. It plays fine on the computer (WMP, CMP, etc), but when I burn it (tried it twice), the audio appears to be out of sync. Strange.

Burned lots of movies before and have never had this issue. I'll try a different file and see if the same problem occurs."
,karleen,2009-12-09T23:14Z,"I do have to say that the quality was great however. No subtitles cluttering the screen. Great vid/audio quality (from what I could tell - read previous comment).

This IS the Special Edition, which means the Morning Report is added, and a few of the scenes are modified digitally (waterfall in Can You Feel The Love Tonight and crocodiles in  Just Can't Wait To Be King)."
,ecko67,2009-12-21T14:27Z,"cheers for this, ps cartooncancer shut the fuck up ya silly wee pr1ck"
