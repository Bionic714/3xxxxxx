,jorgenb,2007-10-12T08:12Z,"You stupid cunts!
At last a band does exactly what you dumb fucks want - put out an album for free on the internet.
At least give them the hits on their own webpage.
Radiohead have been mistreated before by the filesharing community - and this is how you thank them?
Congratulations - maybe you've managed to spoil the whole new concept with artists putting out music on the web for a resonable price by themselves.
Assholes..."

I did not feel like giving my credit card information over the internet to an unknown party.  Would you be so kind as to post yours here, that way we can all use it and give the band some 'hits'.  Dont worry we're all trustworthy.  Otherwize just go back to the Disney© website where you must have accidentally navigated from. "
,plinxie,2007-10-12T13:40Z,"ditto jorgenb.
Poor argumentations funkymonkeypie."

Dude, they're giving it away for free.  Who cares what distribution channel is used.  I've been to three concerts and have 2 t-shirts, thats where the band really make their money anyway.  
Your post is short and makes no point other than you agree and disagree.  My script is at least not vulgar, unlike jorgenb's languageumentation."
,milbs,2007-10-14T20:38Z,i agree with funkymonkeypie. i never buy albums anymore since the artists dont make their money there i go to the shows and buy the shirts.
,basile,2007-10-24T15:34Z,"Guys, someone said that there are 10 songs, I've got 15!!!"
,sabbbs,2007-11-06T22:02Z,"does it really matter where you get it from? they've got the option on their site of buying a deluxe hard copy.. so if you like it, go buy it there. the place where you get the free copy is irrelevant, is it not?"
,krakeric,2008-02-15T22:45Z,"Tried to download this album from the official site only to find it's no longer available. Found this torrent (thank you, milbs), loaded the tracks into my iTunes, listened to the whole thing, loved it, bought the album from amazon for £5.00 which includes the artwork. 
How in this day and age are we supposed to exchange music, were it not for torrents? What a great way of discovering new artists and material. If I like, I buy the album. If I don't, I delete from hard drive. 
There is no such thing as piracy if no money changes hands bypassing artists and publishers. Piracy becomes theft if the bootlegger earns money from distribution of music, films, etc. Which is not the case here. Simple as that. It's high time the copyright laws are changed.
My humble opinion at least. Many thanks for reading."
