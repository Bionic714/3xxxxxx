,Amol_Gh,2010-06-30T07:26Z,"Denzel Washington is GOD. Cry Freedom, Glory, Crimson Tide, Devil in a Blue Dress, Fallen, The Hurricane,  prove it. Only grudge that he should have had made better choices in the last gone decade (He has only Training Day, American Gangster and The Book Of Eli to show from the 2000s). I hope in the next decade we get back the Denzel of 1990s. Sending Love from India to Denzel and to whoever who loves Denzel."
