,streetxlr,2007-10-10T12:51Z,"I'm stuck too at 99,9% - but still downloading at 0,3kB/s. WTF?"

,Ola435345345,2007-10-19T21:36Z,Whats the problem of getting stuck anyway when thgere Is 15 gb of video? It´s not that they stick together... You can still play the 99% you got ;)

,MackanZoor,2007-11-11T03:11Z,"bajen_27: Just keep the torrent active after you have downloaded it 100%.

Do not remove it from your torrent client, do not stop the torrent in your torrent client, and do not move the downloaded files on your hard drive (if you do you will have to change the download target for the torrent)."
,runkill.com,2007-11-12T06:26Z,A lot of times if your torrent gets stuck at 99.9 it's because dmz is turned on in your router's settings instead of having apecific ports forwarded. http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/205647
,Delerium777,2007-11-21T05:56Z,"SHIT .mpg  all the vids are LOW quality cant u see???, these times the vidz are .avi or .mkv and hi quality if u wanna low quality just stream the vids at Youtube..."
,axts01,2007-11-21T17:03Z,"Yeah these are really bad quality, embarrising i'd say."
,Fire_Woman,2007-11-22T07:52Z,"Everyone please be patient. I just got on this thing myself and have the software to clean these up, I think. So please sit back and relax. I will offer my ""ULTIMATE OF MEGA VIDEO PACK"" as soon as I get all the videos I can. This WILL be a mix bag of different genere's and everyone will have an opprotunity to grab ONLY WHAT YOU WANT then seed those to capacity, then delete the torrent, if you so wish to. It will be FREAK huge. So please be a little bit patient with me. Ok? I will do my best to clean all this up for you all. :)


BTW, thank you to the original uploader and for all the seeders here. Please people that are downloading this, stick on and help out. 

And to everyone, even those outside the USA, have a Happy Thanksgiving. :)"

,falkies,2007-12-01T01:59Z,"if you get stuck at 99% or anything else for that matter, stop the torrent, then click resume.  It will check files and start over at 99% or whatever it was at, makes it finish, sometimes they just get stuck"

ps. i use utorrent, can that be part of the problem?"
,umpes,2008-05-02T13:34Z,seed please!!! 
,Jamieboy45,2008-05-05T18:44Z,"Hi, I'm James2k7 (i lost my login so made nu account)
To all those people complaining about download speed.
Firsstly.. how many of you complainers actually seed when you get the file?
last time i looked there was 90 seeders and 1300+ Peers, And this files being downloaded from my dedicated server around 7900 times! (Yes 7900 Times!! Thats just from me.. god knows how many times from the other seeders.) im seeding on a 100mb line.. (being doing doing so for the last 2 mnths) but if none of you will upload anything, NO ONE CAN DOWNLOAD anything.. 
And the people avin a go at the quality and ect..
get a life.. to 90+% of people this is an amazing, high quality, music video torrent. Do you expect almost 350 DVD RIPPED DVD Quality Music videos in the same torrent? Id like to see one yet, to which ALL users get Good speed, and where theres actually more than 10 seeders.
Be Thankful for what your given for FREE!
This has its own DEDICATED box seeding it.. which costs a bomb! At the end of this month i dont think im going to keep on paying to give things to ungreatful Bittorrent Users."
,Take4Free,2008-05-06T16:27Z,Great collection. Cheers
,daddyqwaii,2008-05-12T00:57Z,What a great collection.  
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-05-15T04:41Z,"Jamieboy, i appreciate all you have done, i am one of the 10% that actually seed. i too have a great internet connection, and i have a linux machine that sits in the corner and does nothing but seed over 350 gigs of shit from here. this torrent is currently in the download process, but rest assured it will be added to my ""seed forever"" list. Keep up the great work."
,LithGeezy,2008-05-15T13:17Z,"I agree with you Jamie, but just to defend the whiny bitches a little bit... It IS frustrating sometimes wen people upload absolute SHIT on here and label it otherwise, or don't put anything about the quality of some videos at all (nobody likes looking at fuzz).. HOWEVER... I'm not a whiny bitch, hah, and I extremely appreciate this torrent/will be seeding if I can ever get 15 GB finished... lol, Thanks dude!! This is pretty full!"
,LithGeezy,2008-05-15T13:55Z,the seed/leech ratio on here is ridiculous... SEED FAGGOTS
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-05-17T19:12Z,"Calling me/us ""faggots"" and telling us to seed... like we'd really do what you say just because you call us names. Well, i got news for you, chump... if it werent for people like James and myself, you wouldn't be getting what little download speed you have. i can just say ""FUCK YOU FAGGOT"" and just shut it off, and i'm sure everyone else would do the same, just to piss you off.  Fuck you buddy. if we want to seed, we'll seed. i have almost a 2 to 1 upload ratio right now and it's not even completely done yet. you want this torrent so badly, then just stick it out just like everyone else. faggot."
