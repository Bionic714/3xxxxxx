,piratloller,2007-10-12T01:02Z,Robert Solomon was just about the best ever. His contributions to the research on emotions are almost impossible to overstate. Emotions was one of his favorite philosophy topics (with Existentialism). TTC couldn't have picked a better person. Thanks for bringing it to us.
,piratloller,2007-10-12T01:10Z,"His Existentialism lectures, BTW:

And his lectures on Nietzsche, with his wife Kathleen Higgens:

Both are part of this large torrent:

,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:18Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
