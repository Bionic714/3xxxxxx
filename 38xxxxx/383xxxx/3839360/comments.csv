It is too tall for its' width (or too skinny for its' height - take your pick) I was unable to change the aspect ratio using the normal media players and it would not play in VLC until I converted it to AVI format. Then I used VLC to change the aspect ration to 221:100 and it looked normal. Otherwise vid and sound were fine - funny movie, thanks!"
