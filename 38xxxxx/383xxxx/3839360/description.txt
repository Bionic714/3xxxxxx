Rush Hour 1 (Jackie Chan, 1998) EN

HKFlix Says:  4 stars
An all-too-familiar buddy cop flick, but the chemistry between Chan and Tucker is superb. The fight scenes and comedy are top-notch. 

Avg. Rating:  
  3.9 / 5 (based on 4 ratings). What did you think of it?  
Plot: Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker star as cops with nothing in common who are brought together by the FBI to solve a kidnapping case. Tucker is hilarious, and the stunts are wonderfully inventive. 
 
Overview: Chan plays Lee, a Hong Kong detective who comes to Los Angeles when a Chinese diplomat's 11-year old daughter is kidnapped by Lee's old nemesis. The FBI guys don't want this foreigner mucking up their case, so they saddle Lee with LAPD officer James Carter (Chris Tucker), a loose cannon reluctant to be partnered up. Naturally, the uninventive plotting takes a backseat to the culture-clash hijinks. Lee shows Carter some high-flying moves in exchange for some instruction in simple ebonics. 
 
Cast: Jackie Chan  ||  Chris Tucker  ||  Tom Wilkinson  ||  Chris Penn  ||  Elizabeth Pena
