Prepare to stare into faces of gruesome fear with a trilogy of cruel terror, shedding light on a mysterious cult with its grisly genesis in the mystical depths of the Indian continent. 

Devoted members are encouraged to explore their quest for spiritual enlightenment in ever more bizarre ways - beyond karma and into a world of extreme sadistic horror ruled by the three most feared Hindu goddesses. And Shakti, Devi and Kali don't think twice about exacting a terrible price for such chilling mortal curiosity, as three unsuspecting disciples learn to their blood-freezing cost.
