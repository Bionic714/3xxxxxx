,2xtreme,2007-11-11T13:42Z,how do we pass the 60 days activation!?
,andy_sim,2008-01-22T23:45Z,"Hi there,
I am sorry to sound thick, but what is ""reset 5 ""to get round the activation?

Hope someone can help."
,einstein9999,2008-04-23T19:35Z,"Used Magic ISO and burned no problem. Have installed the first disk with key provided and works. Have not downloaded ""reset 5"" but a quick google search says its a hack to keep the activation date pushed back. I am going to find my old XP activation crack, as I believe it works for Server 2003 as well. I guess both are options. Thks for the upload."

,raybo58,2009-02-01T20:19Z,"Careful. Reset 5 has a virus in it that doesn't show up on your scanners until after you install it.

However, for MS SBS 2003,  after I used it I went to the system32 folder, deleted reset5.exe and reset5.dat. It would then crash directly after logon. 

So I went back and deleted Winlogon.exe, which I presume had been replaced, and renamed WinLogon2070 to WinLogon.exe and now everything works just like I hoped it would."

Careful. Reset 5 has a virus in it that doesn't show up on your scanners until after you install it."" is a fucking idiot. first off reset5 is designed to reset your activation status of course all anti virus apps detect it as a virus much as they detect any other crack / patch / keygen etc. I personally know they guy that wrote reset5 a guy that goes by the nick wet_paper_bag / wpb / ibi from WiNBETA. the reason his windows started acting up was because he deleted the reset5 service and such. I agree reset5 IS a bad idea it dont pass wga etc but its not a virus. get a corp copy/key and be happy /RANT"
