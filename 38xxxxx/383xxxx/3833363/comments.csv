,DevilDiablo,2007-10-10T14:24Z,"Its so big because there are 4 different volumes in the collection. If you install bitlord you can just select the ones you want. Really i should have said what was in it at the beginning 
1. Muddy Puddles
2. Flying a kite
3. New shoes
4. My birtday party

If anybody has any of the others upload them, do it for the kids : )"

Though it should be noted that there is a 2.34GB duplication in the ""My Birthday"" folder. It contains BOTH the rar files to make the ISO & the joined [burnable] ISO. The rar files are not needed."
