'intelligent design' is just plain lies

yes some (probably many) scientists are vain,
stupid or arrogant but that doesnt negate the evidence

,Dummies,2009-03-25T20:27Z,Things are complex because they've been evolving for 3.5 billion years. For fast reproducing microorganisms that's trillions of generations.
,maan1234,2009-07-20T11:50Z,"There's one controversy the intelligent designers don't teach, and that's why an all knowing, all powerful being has to tweak his designs constantly. Intelligent design look a lot like trial and error, some things work, some things have to be changed even more and 99% goes extinct. Where's the heavenly man with the plan, as portrait in the bible,  in that one? It looks like he's making it up as he goes.

A nice docu btw, it's a great tale showing science's weakpoint, scientist think the truth doesn't need PR."
