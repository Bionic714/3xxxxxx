U suck..."
,melfice26,2007-10-13T20:23Z,"it doesn't work!!!
Followed link and installed nero.
After installation it seems none of the serials work.
Nero keeps giving a pop-up showing patent activation.
Then it says you've got a pirated version and can get a 10% discount if u buy it.
Sorry, but this also doesn't work... Like all the other fakes...
I appreciate the effort though..."
,liiiv,2007-10-16T03:59Z,"Whatta?

Everything worked perfect for me, and for everyone else!

So I don't know what you've been doing....

patent activation popup does not give any problems. if you are annoyed...

[x] Go to ""C:\Program Files>Common Files>Nero>Shared>NL3""
[x] Delete the file ""NeroPatentActivation.exe"" "

[M],SteRipper,2008-02-18T00:02Z,"OK. I have used the Keygen made by embrace. I have made more than 75 keys, and not a single one of them worked. Are there any other different keygens than can solve this problem ? It looks like all the serials have been used up."
