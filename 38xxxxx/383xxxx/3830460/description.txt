The Sheffield, England-based Danse Society originated in Barnsley, United Kingdom, a band that included bassist Bubble, drummer Paul Gilmartin, keyboardist Paul "Bee" Hampshire, guitarist Dave Patrick, and vocalist Steve Rawlings. After an appearance on the local scene's Bouquet of Steel compilation in 1980, Y? annexed with two members of Lips-X (guitarist Paul Nash and keyboardist Lyndon Scarfe) and changed their name to Danse Crazy. Following a recording session and a few gigs -- including one at Leeds' Futurama festival with the likes of Public Image Limited, Joy Division, and Cabaret Voltaire -- Hampshire and Patrick left. By early 1981, the remaining members became the Danse Society. The group made their recorded debut on IKF in July 1981 with the Clock single. Just prior to recording a Peel Session, they added bassist Tim Wright to the lineup. Their manager started the Pax label, which released the band's next single. A Pax EP and another Peel Session predated a defection to their own Society imprint for 1982's Seduction EP. Another single closed the year out, and by this point the Danse Society was earning the interest of several major labels. Arista won out, signing the band in early 1983. A couple singles were released before the full-length Heaven Is Waiting.
