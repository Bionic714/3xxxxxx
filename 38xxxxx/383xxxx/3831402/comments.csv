,splicitysplat,2007-10-09T02:25Z,what quality is it at
,splicitysplat,2007-10-09T02:25Z,never mind
,jeromedevine,2007-10-12T00:28Z,Is this album password protected as always huh?
,jeromedevine,2007-10-12T01:14Z,"Ok so I downloaded and I can confirm that it is not, repeat NOT password protected. Good quality with artwork too. Cheers."
,F1 silverstone,2007-10-17T21:51Z,THX

,stonesour025,2007-10-27T08:42Z,I'm guessing it's at about 203kbps VBR
,DrunkOnShadows,2007-10-29T21:53Z,"Now, I don't wanna sound like an idiot, but whattha hell is VBR...? :P I've seen it written in some of the other music torrents, but I can't seem to figure out what it is... "
,trippo,2007-10-30T10:06Z,"-> DrunkOnShadows

VBR is variable bitrate which means that the bitrate will be distrubuted where it's needed more when compressing to mp3. Usually means better sound, might be standalone player that don't support it."
,DrunkOnShadows,2007-10-31T20:54Z,Thanks trippo... :) One learn as long as one live...
,redcore,2007-11-01T04:47Z,Great collection...I've always liked Clapton but never really wanted to buy/download all his albums to get the 20 or so songs that I liked (especially with Cream and solo) so this is perfect. Recommended.
,DeLaGoya,2007-11-05T16:36Z,Thanks for a great upload!
,FidelCastroRuz,2008-01-12T00:31Z,"Great collection but VBR sucks. When is the VBR better sound myth gonna go away?

Long live the Revolution!"
,wilson1375,2008-03-28T18:12Z,Thnx for the up. Would be nice to not have rar'd it tho... So we can see what songs are there and pick and choose if we want. But you've upped alot! Keep up the good work :)
,rastanot,2008-07-15T02:56Z,"VBR allows a higher bitrate (and therefore more storage space) to be allocated to the more complex segments of media files while less space is allocated to less complex segments. The average of these rates can be calculated to produce an average bitrate for the file.

It's better than 128 dude! But, it's not as good as lossless, and therefor not as large a file.
Good pirating to you All.
Arrrrrrrrrgh.

,tideomega,2011-04-17T21:54Z,Is the higher the bit rate the better the sound ? I have Any DVD Converter Pro and I can convert 128 to 192 to 224 to 284. What is the best set ?
,Grim88,2011-09-06T17:51Z,"@tideomega You can't do that, so don't even try.

You can convert and lower bitrates, that's fine, but if you get a crappy quality mp3 of 32kbps, you can't convert it up to 128kbps and expect it to sound good. Once the quality is ruined it cannot be restored.

And to answer your question, yes, the higher the bitrate, the better the sound within its respective compression type (i.e. CBR, VBR, ABR). Each have their advantages and disadvantages, but it basically works by removing the sound ranges usually inaudible to human hearing. Hence, if you lower too much, it removes ranges of sound that ARE audible. Basically 128kbps is a decent audio rate for most people is fine, but you can have it a bit higher if you are finicky and can notice the difference. 320kbps for example is overkill for most people and uses up a lot of space."
