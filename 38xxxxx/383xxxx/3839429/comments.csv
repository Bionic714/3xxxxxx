,galenmereth,2007-10-12T17:40Z,"Forgot to mention:
This file was released on itavisen.no earlier today, whereas on Fileshack you can currently only preload the demo, having to wait for Epic's beta key. The file has now been removed from the original page, so I can only assume that it was released a bit too early ;)

Bear with me, as my DSL capacity for upload is only at a measly 180kb/s max. Please seed when you're done!"
,paranoima,2007-10-12T17:46Z,Thats for putting this up.  I've been trying to download from other sites that got the non-Fileplanet version.  I'll seed all weekend as soon as I get my laptop back home.
,Rongelol,2007-10-12T18:51Z,Is this the real deal? Can anyone confirm?
,slybunda,2007-10-12T19:26Z,"confirmed its real, note when entering email address, its seto to usa keyboard so the @ symbol brings up the game console."
,sarassin,2007-10-12T19:33Z,"I'll be seeding this non-stop too, as soon as I finish downloading.

Btw, Dedicated Unreal Tournament 3 demo Facebook group :

Promising group in need of early adopters! ;P"
,RawSnake,2007-10-12T19:37Z,"The game works fine. But i cant seem to join any servers it just says ""connecting"" when i try to join. Dont have a router in the way either, and i have allowed it in the windows firewall. Do i have to open specific ports anyway?"

,Fozzibab,2007-10-13T09:22Z,"Alright well I don't know if anyone else is getting this but apparently the install file is corrupted. I get a ""corrupted data error"" in the file Data1.cab when installing. Is anyone else getting this?"
,galenmereth,2007-10-13T12:35Z,"Fozzibab: Since at least RawSnake and slybunda here have managed to install and run it apart from me, something must have happened during the transfer... Try forcing a re-check of the file in your torrent software; in very rare occasions a torrent is checked as complete even if a bit of data remains to be transferred."
,sarassin,2007-10-13T15:31Z,"It works perfectly.

Except that I can't seem to connect to multiplayer. It stays stuck on the ""connecting..."" screen.

Are you guys able to play this demo on multiplayer?"
,v4rdy,2007-10-13T16:42Z,there are a few connection problems with this beta. i didnt download it from here but the way to fix the online is to connect to server that are Dedicated
,elcapitano111,2007-10-13T22:09Z,How do i register?...it brings up the console when i press the @ button...which button is now @?
,elcapitano111,2007-10-13T22:46Z,I am pressing the @ button when i try to enter my email address.....please help
,galenmereth,2007-10-13T22:58Z,"On keyboard problems: Some people seem to get US keyboard input in the beta demo. I did not, however.
Check here for the US keyboard layout: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#US

On multiplayer connection:
No doubt due to the fact that the client server is also in beta ;)
I've played a few matches and never got this, but I'm sure connecting to dedicated servers or trying different ones should solve it. If not, check your firewall settings and make sure the UT3 exe file is allowed."
,elcapitano111,2007-10-13T23:01Z,"Thanks for the help, but i have already been there and tried that....the number 2 should be the @ sign but it isnt, i want to play online, can anyone else help....i see some have already had this problem and overcome it...HELP"

,andreiclawhammer,2007-10-14T13:37Z,"This is fucking unbelivable ,I download the UT3 demo from fileplanet - file corrupt

I download it from here - file corrupt(somehting about audio)

I download Crysis 3 MP beta from fileplanet - file corrupt

I download the Crysis MP 3 beta from here - guess what , what a big fucking surprise ,- file corrupt ,WTF is hapening here? 

I did force - recheck a million times and it still stops at 99.9 ,99.7 . So I give download it goes to 100% but ,when I give force re-check ,again it drops back to 99.9 , or 99.7 , then if I give download and goes to 100% again, the second time ,but again when I give force-recheck it drops to 99.9 , or 99.7% and then the process repeats itself .

I badly need some advice , any help is apreciated."
,Jasjeet,2007-10-14T15:44Z,"good seeding speed guys, anybody else confirm this is working. Also guy with the @ key problem did you figure it out yet?"

off the hook

etc."
,reneviper999,2007-10-15T01:34Z,Confirmed... this is real...
,galenmereth,2007-10-15T14:34Z,"Regarding corrupt files:

If you happen to receive corrupt files, I would recommend checking if your hard drive is heavily fragmented. Yes, it sounds stupid, but I had this problem with an external drive before and defragmenting it with a proper defrag utility solved it.

Regarding the keyboard problem:

Try playing offline ( you don't need an email address then ), set display mode to window, copy an @ symbol from a text application or whatever, then go back to the program and create a new account using that. I imagine that should work, but I have no time to verify right now..."
,Masterplanner12345,2007-10-15T20:01Z,Sn채lla seeda!!!
,Jasjeet,2007-10-22T14:30Z,"yeah to get the @ key i first put it in notepad then copied it from there and pasted it into the game using ctrl+c then ctrl+v and it worked!

my pc cant run this game very well the menu even lags at a res of 1024*768 lol"
,regneva404,2007-10-22T20:17Z,Why is this getting stuck at 99.7%?
,regneva404,2007-10-22T20:24Z,Stuck at 99.7% since past 2 hours. Anybody else facing the problem? Does this work?
