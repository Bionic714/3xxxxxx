Are you using a WIDESCREEN.

I had the same thing come up. First I was using my laptop that has a widwscreen. So I moved it to my desk top. It seemed to want to run. However, after I pressed the 'START'.bat in my extraction folder, all I got was a black screen popping up for a split second and then nothing.....

ANY HELP??????? ANYONE!!!!!! "
,NoMadValues,2008-05-27T04:31Z,"All in all, I would have to say this game does not work... Sorry"
,yagami187,2008-05-27T20:52Z,in order for u to play the games you need to extract the file but you need an imulator to play so just go to coolroms.com 
,ipfree549,2009-01-14T22:17Z,"Extracting files has been around since as long as I can remember, windows 95. I don't know how peeps on here don't know it. But extracting is when you move files from the folder (Example: \'DONKEY KONG COUNTRY.ZIP) to another location."
,field33,2009-05-21T11:44Z,"fix for all widescreen problems:
1. Buy a Nintendo DS & flashcard
2. Download SNEmulDS
3. Put the SNES rom in a folder called SNES
4. Load up SNEmulDS
5. Play on!"
,field33,2009-05-21T11:45Z,"nooo sorry for my reaction...
it was a .dat file which couldnt be run with snemulds"

,kinang26,2009-11-27T16:32Z,"doesn't work, what a waste"
,_wolfie_,2011-08-15T08:43Z,"not to be a bitch but, if it doesn't work for widescreen it should come with a warning. Most people use widescreen these days. I know I have for the last 5-6 years and it wasn't a new concept when I got it."
,Bacakedgamer420,2012-02-09T11:08Z,Game works great!!! Thnx uploader. Just a question if any 1 knows... Is there a way to get this to work with a game pad?
