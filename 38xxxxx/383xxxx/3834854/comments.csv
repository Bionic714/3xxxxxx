,double_b26,2007-12-24T03:44Z,"its not americans as a people, its the government that gives us a bad reputation.  right now bush and congress have 10% or less approval rate, but they keep doing whatever they like regardless of what the people think.... it sucks.  so i can understand why people think of us that way, but its not so much the people here, but the assholes that are supposed to represent us, but just do as they please that gives the rest of the world a bad impression.
