,AlocParc,2007-10-14T08:03Z,When I attempt to open the rar file it keeps telling me I don't have enough disk space

,natell,2007-10-14T17:23Z,"Help, I've never done this before I have downloaded the file which has taken me 4 days and now dont know what to do with it"
,natell,2007-10-14T18:54Z,"please help, I've got the CS3 application, i've got power iso, but dont know what to do next, please can someone give me step by step instructions on how to install it, sorry to be a pain"
,atalanta8,2007-10-15T04:26Z,It won't let me activate it.  What should I do? Thanks.
,AlocParc,2007-10-15T05:31Z,I have about 60GB of free disk space and it keeps telling me there is not enough free space. How did you guys extract and install it? (even tho it sounds like there is trouble activating it)
,I_AM_McLovinu2,2007-10-15T06:29Z,"There is no trouble activating it. all you have to do is run the keygen. on the bottom half of the keygen copy and paste the activation code into the only slot on the bottom half that you can. then it will generate the activation code. 

winrar opens .RAR files.

In poweriso just double click the file and it should open up and show you all the files. if not use magic iso and do the same. then burn the cds. 

again, you must burn them unless the mounting works for you as it hasnt for me. ive installed this on about 12 computers all different brands. so if its not working for you then its you."
,I_AM_McLovinu2,2007-10-15T06:50Z,"let me clarify this. you copy and paste the code adobe gives you under activation into the keygen program then it gives you the activation code which you put in. the serial keys are different from the activation, they just allow you to install the software. activation lets you run it. "
,I_AM_McLovinu2,2007-10-15T13:57Z,anyone want to leave feedback that they actually got it working? I would assume the other 50 or so of you did since you haven't posted.
,natell,2007-10-15T17:26Z,"i'm going mad, still problems, I've made 2 iso discs of the program using magic iso, which seem OK, but when I run the install it asks me to insert the CS3 disc which is already in as that is what I am running installation from, please help, i'm a real novice at this, but trying my best, I have spent half the day trying to solve it myself"
,natell,2007-10-15T21:04Z,"thanks for all your help, i have finally got it working, i had to uninstall some shared componants then it installed perfectly and crack worked, thanks again, will seed often as i can"
,713tex,2007-10-15T22:27Z,Do you have to burn this to a disk or can I just use DAEMON Tools?
,713tex,2007-10-15T23:44Z,I got going now. Mounting the image worked for me . I used DAEMON Tools and turned on all emulation options. Thanx McLovin
,I_AM_McLovinu2,2007-10-16T00:14Z,"natell, just press ok when it says that. hopefully you didnt just burn the .iso's hopefully you extracted them then burned them otherwise it may not work properly."
,nelleke1,2007-10-16T01:25Z,"Mc. 
your torent works fine
but people don't read the instructions.
Nice upload  8-)

"
,slvrcvc1532,2007-10-16T05:58Z,thanks for the help. i finally got everything working with the help of a friend. program works great and she even showed me how to use it.  
,maepic,2007-10-16T20:42Z,"I think this will be excellent once I figure it all out.  It seems to me that it is assumed that no one would be a novice.  I am a complete novice, so step-by-step instructions for what to do once it's all downloaded would be helpful.  I also am not entirely certain that simply not closing Azureus means that I am in fact seeding this back, which is my intention.  In any case, wanted to thank you and say that this is much appreciated! "
,Werty2,2007-10-16T22:06Z,"Thanks for what seems to be a great torrrent Mc!

I'm a bit confused about the activation code.

I've burned the two cds and installed CS3, but I never had to give it a serial it just started and installed anyway. 

When am I supposed to get that code from Adobe?

When I try to open a program, for example DreamWeaver, I get this message: 

Licensing for this product has stopped working.
You cannot use this product at this time. You must repair the problem by uninstalling and the reinstalling this product or contacting your IT administrator or Adobe custumer support for help.

So now I guess I have to uninstall it and do it allover but I can find where the uninstall file is. Any idea?

Anyway thanks again, it seems great!"
,larre81,2007-10-17T16:05Z,"I'm sorry to bother, but i still can't get it to work.
I have tried to use daemon tools but i don't think I really know how it works. And I never get to pick ""activate by phone"". I am completely lost. Please help. Take it from the beginning, I would really appriciate it."
,tegu,2007-10-18T16:50Z,downloading fast!  thank you seeders!
,I_AM_McLovinu2,2007-10-19T20:21Z," If you don't see activate by phone while doing the initial install you must goto one of the programs and under help it says activate or something similiar. click it then enter the apropriate information and use the keygen/activation code generator. 

there are step by step instructions. 

The activation and the serial are 2 totally different things."
,Werty2,2007-10-20T22:25Z,"La-di-da!

Thank you for a great upload! 
All I had to do was uninstall and re install it. Again, great upload.."
,Homunkurusu,2007-10-22T02:41Z,"Dear Community;  
forgive my ineptitude, but I have a few questions.  Firstly, there is supposed to be full step by step instructions as to prevent this from turning into a help forum.  However, I can't find the instructions in the final extraction.  There are three main folders, ""DISK1"", ""DISK2"", and ""CS3 CRACKS AND SERIALS"".  In none of there folders is there a step by step instruction guide.  Is the guide somewhere else.  Also,  in folders ""DISK1"" and ""DISK2"", there are numerous .rar files.  Which one(s) should I extract, and to where?  A friend told me only the fist .rar was necessary, and after extracting it to a folder, I found the .iso file in said folder.  I then burned that .iso to a DVD, as 2 GB of data wont fit on a CD.  The burn completed without trouble, but when I went to put the disk in for an install, an error occurs.  The installer prompt begins, and I prompt it to install the software, then, while initializing installation, an error occurs, specifically ""internal error 2739""  The display also mentions I contact Adobe Customer support...    :p     I apologize for the wall of text and utter lack of knowledge.  Last time, I did something completely different."
,boneill,2007-10-23T02:12Z,"I downloaded it, and it worked great. 

For the novices: Download it all, Extract the file from the first archive in DISK 1 and write it to the same directory (easier to find that way). 

Install PowerISO (use the free trial version when it asks) and reboot. The file you extracted is now not set as a PowerISO file. Double click on it, and it will open in PowerISO with all the files listed in the archive. Drop a blank DVD into your burner, and burn the disk...it will burn, open and shut the DVD drive, and tell you it's done. The disk is now ready to go, open and close you DVD drive again and it will auto start...install it all (if you want), follow the prompts !

When you open the first program in the suite after installation is done (takes a half hour, be patient), it will ask for Serial stuff. Put in one of the serials in the Serials file in the crack folder...press the button...when it asks for confirmation authorization say Yes...it will fail with the internet attempt, but the Phone option will be there on the very bottom. Click on it....take the last code shown and put it into the KeyGen...take the result from that and paste it back into the response section of the authorization !

Thank you for authorizing !

That's it !

Thanx man...great torrent indeed !"
