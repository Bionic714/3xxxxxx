CzW group (pretty unknown to me), released newest version of Reaper - v2. Personally, i don?t see a point of cracking this one, cause it?s cheap (50 bucks), and the best part is, even it?s shareware, it doesn?t expire at all (only nag screen is there). Anyway, cracked version is here, so if you want to try make some music, give it a shot.
