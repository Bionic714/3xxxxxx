,fjevader,2007-10-12T18:22Z,Do you ever check back to see if anyone is downloading your programs or did you ever seed this one at all?
,freshwaterman,2007-10-14T02:15Z,"I've looked everywhere for a port forwarding program and this is, yet again, another usless PFConfig download. Unless this has a keygen or a crack it won't work. My guess this is just some dude who bought the thing and posted his own serial # which very quickly gets blacklisted by PORTFORWARD.com. 

Try posting something that works."
,fjevader,2007-10-15T00:34Z,He has done this on all of his torrents. To bad PFConfig is a great program if you can find a working key. By what I've heard the key only works for a short time even if you buy it. Still jokeri1971 is a jerk.
,jokeri1971,2007-10-20T16:12Z,"hey fjevader what a big mouth you have my key is not blacklisted and it still works and what did i do with my torrents, my torrents ar clean and all works just fine. and i am not so dude so fuck off"
,fjevader,2007-10-20T22:26Z,Then why am I stuck at 99.5% ? I never said your serial was blacklisted or your torrents were bad. Just said for some reason they are not being downloaded. Maybe you didn't seed long enough. Try to download this torrent your self and see what happens. Not really trying to be an ass. The key only works one time even if you do buy it. Happened to someone I know thats all.
,jokeri1971,2007-10-21T06:31Z,"do u have icq than i send it over icq to you,and i seed everyday so maybe thats not the problem"
,jokeri1971,2007-10-21T06:46Z,"i try it right now and it stuck on 99,5% i dont now whats wrong with this torren but i now i seed everyday , if someone does not can download this than send me a pm over icq and i will upload it there for you

,fjevader,2007-10-21T19:01Z,I seed every day also. Not sure what the problem is with this torrent. I even tried to download again and it stuck at 95.5 all over again. I don't have a icq so how about just give us the serial or reup the torrent again? This is a good prog would love to have it. sorry about the jerk deal.
,jokeri1971,2007-10-21T20:25Z,serial is uploaded under pfconfig serial
,bojanvoj,2007-10-23T01:56Z,"TIFFEN DFX Photoshop ....Please seed...stopped at 43.9%. something is wrong. Please post is again....

,KayeBeast,2007-10-26T14:09Z,"i was having trouble forwarding my ports, utorrnet kept telling me 'error port not forwarded' and all my download speeds were slow like under 5.0kb/s tried this pfconfig but couldnt find serial or crack. i downloaded hirens instead, theres a program in hirens called currports http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/cports.html . it shows you a list of all your local ports, i found the one for utorrent (4095 for me), changed utorrent port to 4095 and now my downloads are maxing at about 200kb/s.   yes i am a happy man now. hope this helps anyone"
,hobod250,2007-11-17T21:49Z,can u seed for like 1 min plz 
,hobod250,2007-11-17T21:55Z,.5% seed for me plz T_T
,cuccio,2007-12-12T13:09Z,"sorry KayeBeast,can u exlpain me how do you configure your router with the program u've just said?i don't know how to do,and i've the same problem that you had,my speed it's too slow!
please,help me"
,halvljus,2007-12-26T14:37Z,"Right ... I have ripped my hair off due to something called ""port forward"". I do NOT have a ""router"", whatever that may be. I have tried Wuze (Azureus?) BitTorrent and uTorrent, and none of them works! Wuze doesn´t do anything, BitTorrent and uTorrent are both extremely slow and works randomly. I have now tried nirsoft, but I am not able to actualy change any settings with it!? Is there any way at all to make this torrent-thing works? Yes, I´m quite new to this! "
,fonejacker13,2008-01-21T03:28Z,"as KayeBeast said.. download currports from the nrsoft site, and open your torrent program.. search for an established port and set that in UTorrent or whatever program you use.

Mine had stopped working all together, but now ive sorted it and am able to upload at 85-90kb/s. I was only getting about 60kb/s before, so this has improved slightly.. should still be more th since im on a 20mb cable connection :/"
,fonejacker13,2008-01-21T03:29Z,"btw.. dont waste your time with this program.. google it, and then go to the software creators site, follow the simple instructions on port forwarding in your router.. its easy ;)"
,Muktukk,2008-05-09T18:13Z,seed stuck at 99.5
,husskii,2008-12-04T08:31Z,hey jokeri1971 i have tried all ur uploads that have to do with pcconfig and all serials are blacklisted. i guess its not ur fault its been a yr since it was uploaded. But still wat a waist!
