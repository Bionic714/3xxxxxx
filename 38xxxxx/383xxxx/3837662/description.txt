PortForward.com is proud to offer help setting up port forwarding on your router or firewall. Many Internet users are not aware of how to configure their router or firewall in order to use applications like Peer-to-Peer file sharing (PtoP), Internet Games, Web serving, FTP serving, WebCams, IRC DDC, and Instant Messaging such as AIM, ICQ, Yahoo and MS Messenger

PFConfig  
  Automatically forward your ports with PFConfig. If you are trying to run an application that requires ports to be forwarded, you can skip the work and just use PFConfig. With PFConfig, you don't have to learn how to setup your router. It's so easy to use, you just pick the program from a list and say 'Update Router'.

PortTrigger 

 
  When you run out of Port Forwarding space on your router, you can use the port triggering section to accomplish the same task. Simply run our PortTrigger application on the computer that you want to have ports forwarded to, and like magic your application starts working. No more logging in to your router every time you switch applications just because your router doesn't have enough port forwarding capacity.
