Release Notes                                                                
Raja Ram is renowned and loved world over for his sets, energy, charisma and 
showmanship.He is truly one of a kind. A pioneer and true spirit of the scene 
whose enthusiasm, passion and drive to push forward and make it better is    
amazing. He is an inspiration.                                                
The album consists of 3 cd's of what Raja Ram sees as the key tracks of his  
career in music which spans 40 years!. His favourite moments.                
CD1 is Quintessence and what a great collection it is. Really groovy stuff.  
Some amazing jazz flute by Raja Ram and great guitar solos and tunes. A really
great collection of tracks from a legendary band in the London Psychedelic    
movement of late 60's early 70's.                                            
CD2 is The Infinity Project. Raja Ram and Graham wood were one of the first  
acts to make Goa Trance or Psy Trance as it is now known. There first track  
was in 1989 and they had the first Tip party to celebrate it. Both the track  
and the flyer of the party are included in package. This is the definitive    
collection of T.I.P as selected by Raja Ram but mixed together.              
CD3 the final cd is also mixed and is mainly Shpongle, Raja Ram's very        
successful partnership with Simon Posford who have really pushed the          
boundaries of what Psychedelic music can be. Then we have of course some key  
tracks from the other highly successful collaboration (Riktam, Bansi and      
Chicago) which is1200 Micrograms. One of the key global acts this decade for  
high power, peak time Psy music. A real headliner for all the big Psy parties 
around the world.                                                            
And we have Cyberbabas first track which was the first time Raja Ram got      
together with Benji Vaughan and what an exciting collaboration of talent they 
possess. In fact the next chapter is a new act by these 2 called The Zap! And 
it is perhaps Tip Worlds most exciting album to date. Psychedelic but        
generally pretty genre defying stuff. Elements from everywhere but not        
constrained by any rules and routines, speeds, sounds or effects. Watch out!  
Raja Ram has only just begun!
