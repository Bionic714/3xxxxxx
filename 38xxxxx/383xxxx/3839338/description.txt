Overview: The chase may be long, but the action is fast and furious is this tale of a dart master-for-hire and the innkeeper's daughter who loves him. He's under deadly threat from a police officer after he assassinates a Government Minister, while she's the target of murderous local bandits. The consummately versatile director, soon to be declared a master of the "esoteric weapon" kung-fu film, develops his style with this sharp thriller that really gets to the point.
