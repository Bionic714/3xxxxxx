Notes from ripper: I was looking for a paper clip (for reasons unkown) and i was searching throug my bros droors when i came up on this show. Its still in its original cassete tape case (yea, cassete tape). So me and my other brother have this crappy 4 track so i just jimmy rigged it onto my comp and straight up ripped the show into .wav format and then to Flac. So here ya go!
