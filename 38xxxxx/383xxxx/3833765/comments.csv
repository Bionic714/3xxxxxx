THANKS...."
,Jhouston,2007-10-08T23:00Z,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,skunkworks2000,2007-10-26T15:43Z,Thanks DuffPaddy. A real treasure to be had here. Quality is superb and through your efforts Peels memory is helped to live on. A file now set in stone on my PC and as such I will Seed whenever online and not remove it and will do the same with others when I've got them. Hopefully many will benefit!

,Boagster,2007-11-17T12:58Z,You're a good guy! thanx.
,elwoodbloos,2007-12-10T23:04Z,WOW
,trumpydumpy,2008-04-06T19:28Z,"I don't know what skunkworks was thinking, but the quality of sound is horrible, not even AM quality.  There is a hum in the background that is unbearable and the sound is very muddy, not really comfortable to listen to.  Don't waste your time downloading this unless you really really want to get it for a certain live performance or obscure track."
,unholm,2008-04-10T15:19Z,"Thanx for these great shows!!!
ONE QUESTION PLEASE :
Every single show is 2 hours, and is not divided to single tracks.
HOW CAN I burn a CDR from this Shows ??
OR : is there any possibility to divide one Show into 2 parts of 1 hour each, so it would fit on a CD ???
Please be so kind to inform me, either here or on my email :
hhstender@arcor.de
HAVE A NICE TIME EVERYBODY, best wishes,
Hans-Helmut from Germany.
Ihr kĂśnnt natĂźrlich auch in Deutsch schreiben. :)"

,mxyzptik,2010-12-18T17:02Z,"I remember listening to one of these shows on a sunny Sunday afternoon in Highgate, London when I was sixteen, as if it was today. It was as magical then as it is now .... now I'm far away in Australia. Wondrous.  Thank you."
