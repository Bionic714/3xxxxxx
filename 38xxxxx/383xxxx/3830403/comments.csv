,Syrothos,2007-10-23T00:12Z,SEED!
,Syrothos,2007-10-23T06:42Z,"at the part where the plane hits the water, the graphics are completely messed up?"
,Cookieeftw,2007-11-05T16:29Z,"I also have some problem with the graphics, when yer' beneath the water it looks like square-snow flakes etc...
What fixes it, Dotocm1?
I can't find anything on the site, you download it, or something...?
Please don't laugh at me, I know nothing about computers except that if you doubleclick on an icon, a game magically take form on the screen! O.O"
,Cookieeftw,2007-11-06T17:03Z,"Nvm, got it working... :D
Kinda... From what it used to be, the graphics are a lot better. But they still suck... Q.Q
Any suggestions, except getting a new... Dunno what it's called in english :P"
,Sefus,2007-11-07T05:52Z,"Hmm. I don't know. Try reinstalling?
It works fine for me.
I only wish the controls weren't so sensitive, even at the lowest setting :(

Seeding."
,Sefus,2007-11-07T05:53Z,ask around at www.suprbay.org
,Cookieeftw,2007-11-09T17:05Z,"Sefus- Hm... Install? I just run it... Perhaps that's the prob, I need to install it fully?
...Or...
Poop."
,Cookieeftw,2007-11-09T17:21Z,"Ehm, how to install? Is it that Setup thingy in _Info/Program Files/InstallShield Installation Information/(Thingythingblabla)/Setup ?"
,Cookieeftw,2007-11-09T17:29Z,"An additional question from me.. :P

How do I reduce loading time? It's instructions for it on this site ( http://www.paolofranchini.com/shshock/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=5 ) but I dunno' where all the files are located etc, if there even are any.

Meh..."
,Cookieeftw,2007-11-10T20:44Z,...Which one is the latest?
,ZeroHunter,2007-11-11T05:27Z,Im Seeding :P
,Cookieeftw,2007-11-11T17:00Z,"Maybe I should count up all my probs at once? :

1.The level(s) load dang slow, and the at site mentioned before with all the download-thingies I don't get the instructions. I can't find those files etc...
2. Which one of the ""thingies"" should I use to make the game at least playable? Cus' I've tried some of them, and the graphics are still crappy, though I put the settings on what they recommend me to.
How the graphics look: Sometimes the water turn all white in the beginning, like when that plane rubble start burning. The partikels, I guess they are called that? Anyway, if I'm wrong on that one, the... Well, almost everything isn't really ""smooth""... Err... Don't know how to explain... Well, where it should be shadows it is all black, and small pixel-like thingys... Gosh, I wish i were better at english :P
3. Ehm... Lemme' see...
4. Ahem...

Anyway, pleeease help me, and give me a detailed explanation if you may have a solution. And easy enough for me to understand... T__T My brain is smaller than a snails...
And please try to give me support and things until It's fixed, you've run out of ideas and when I perhaps give up...

Darn my dreadful language..."
,ibarracinco,2007-11-11T18:07Z,hey im new to torrent and im using bittorent so i dont really know how  to install game so what do i do?
,black-black,2007-11-12T19:08Z,seed like hell every one
,Sefus,2007-11-13T06:11Z,"What you do is read the instructions... aka
1. Use google. 
2. Get the program winrar.
3. Double Click the .rar files that came in the DL to extract them somewhere/anywhere on your computer.
4. Go to C:/Where ever you just extracted those files to/Bioshock/Builds/Release/Bioshock.exe to install the game.
5. Play the game.

To all the people having problems, I don't know what to tell you. It works fine for me. I even downloaded it to make sure. I have heard of people having problems though. Search around www.suprbay.org or start a thread. These guys can help you. Unfortunately, I have no clue since mine works just fine."
,Sefus,2007-11-13T06:13Z,"also if you missed DOCTOCM1's post check this out.

,Johan_Diesel87,2007-11-13T21:01Z,"Hello! My Bioshock works perfect ""exept for one thing"" my sound dosenÂ´t work. it works fine untill the plane crashes, and after that it just goes away?! Need help.."
,Cookieeftw,2007-11-14T16:30Z,"Sefus- I have been checking the downloads on that site before, and indeed it seemed pretty good. I tried a few of them, and the graphics at least got better. There is nothing wrong with the water and fire in the beginning... But while beneath the surface all the objects you see leave ""shadow"" behind them when they move, and they all seem a bit green-blueish.
And when you see the sky, you notice that it doesn't look too good, the clouds aren't ""smooth in the edges"" and stuff.
Then when you walk onto the lighthouse... All shadows are completely black, and you see weird black spots at the edges of the black areas, pixel-like thingys, like the sky outside. Then some things are messed up, lights are... I don't know how to describe it...

Uh... I think I'll shut up now, see you... "

For a few months (durring which time I dl'd this game) I was very new at all this bit torrent stuff. I didn't know about the etiquette or that anyone would even see it. Much less download it. I don't visit my torrents often. I forget they are here. I'm sorry for pissing off anyone and I don't make a habit of that sort of thing. Just FYI. 

If I did piss anyone off, I'd be happy to remove the torrent but I see it still has seeds so... let me know. I'm a fair dude."
