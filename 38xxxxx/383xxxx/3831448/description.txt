Avatar Season 3 Episode 3 - "The Painted Lady"

My encode has some fishbone effect (I didn't know that was possible with sattelite tv) - It's only really apparent during dark scenes. Otherwise it is my usual medium quality. (Old vid card and all)

Includes chibi short that aired afterwards. It's the one that was on the Nick website a long time ago where everyone wants to ask Katara to the dance.

Enjoy! Please seed to 1.0 or better!
