  GAME NOTES:
  ~~~~~~~~~~    

  In the mid-21st century, massive overpopulation and consumption caused irreversible 
  resource shortages over most of the planet. All supplies of fossil fuels were 
  completely decimated by 2031. The agro-mosaic virus outbreak of 2042 triggered the 
  global food riots of 2043 by causing the extinction of all agricultural plant species. 
  Five billion humans, almost half of the earths population, died of starvation.

  With most cities falling into ruin in a perpetual night of low fuel and no power, street 
  gangs grew into terror patrols, controlling neighborhoods and sometimes entire cities. 
  These terror patrols grew larger and larger, falling under the control of ever more 
  powerful dictators.

  All government officials became targets for assassination, the global system of 
  government was getting weaker by the day. As the governments began to fall and chaos 
  began to be a way of life, all governments united and focused on the continuing search 
  for a new energy source.

  Finally, in 2079, government scientists discovered a new energy source, created from anti 
  matter chemical reactions between the grinding forces of the planets tectonic plates, a 
  new energy source was mined, called ORE. ORE, though not energy producing itself, was able 
  to catalyze nearly any chemical reaction and also amplify any electrical power fed into it. 
  Because of the density of the ORE found, when energy passed through the ORE atoms were sped 
  up to a speed never seen before, increasing energy passed through the ORE as well as creating 
  distortion in time and the known field.

  After the ORE became common knowledge, the fighting factions used all means to gain 
  access to the ORE's power. Using the ORE's power to bend time and fold space the MOB 
  left earth in search of more ORE, in the process creating a war between worlds as well 
  as on its own. Deep in the bowels of UMC research and development, secret experiments 
  have led to the creation of the advanced massively parallel bio-computational neural network, 
  with the ability to emulate higher-level thought processes and simulate the nonlinear 
  processing of computations and complex algorithms. This advanced bio-computational neural 
  network has created a perfect artificial environment, this new system avoids failures from 
  the past and jerkiness caused by computational spasming in older non bio based artificial 
  environments.

  One of the first practical uses of this new technology was the development of an advanced 
  combat training emulator. This emulator is a virtual reality where the UMC weeds out the 
  mentally weak and trains the best of the best to be even better. It is so realistic several 
  level 5 marines who first tested it died of cardiac arrest.

  The "Meat Machine" termed by the first wave of Marines tested on the neural network, takes 
  the Marine where they have never been, shows them enemies they have never faced, and trains 
  them with existing UMC weaponry, plus weaponry that are yet to be made in the real world.

  When asked for a CD-KEY, enter 5a67-8eaf-8863-e05e

  Remember that you probably will not be able to play Online with this, You'll need to buy the 
  game for that.

  Check out the cool intro included (both on the cd and in a .zip) !!!
  
  Enjoy, and watch out for more from your friends at the Blade!
