,wesker18,2011-04-12T08:45Z,"Whilst I hate Kanye, I do like this song, if only for the fact Daft Punk were in it and therefore approve. What I do hate is the fact that he boldfacedly ripped of the Anime Film Classic 'Akira' when he made the video. So, a big FUCK YOU to Kanye.


Oh, and he also interrupted Taylor Swifts award speech. Dick."

If you don't trust Wikipedia then tough balls. Look it up somewhere else. Her is the section where it talks about the Music Video.
