Great fun everyone should enjoy

Puppetry of thePenis was conceived by Simon Morley in 1996 as the title of a highbrow art calendar, showcasing twelve of his favorite penis installations (known as "Dick Tricks" to the uninformed layperson). Years before, Simon?s youngest brother had shown him his installation, ?The Hamburger?. Natural sibling rivalry resulted in the evolution of a grand repertoire of genital gesticulations.

It was on New Year?s Eve in 1997, with a garage full of calendars to sell and burgeoning requests for live demonstrations, when Simon finally decided to unleash his talent on the world.
