,VicVega,2007-10-31T23:33Z,"I would say that the TV show Smallville is the ultimate Superman collection. It's the most interesting telling of the Superman story, since you get to learn his history piece by piece over a long period of time, during his most interesting years.

It's also the most recent one, so it has the most modern special effects (apart from Superman Returns maybe). It has an excellent cast, especially Rosenbaum, Kreuk and Glover.

And most importantly: Ins Smallville, the Superman mythology isn't compressed into a 2 hour movie - it actually expands thanks to an elaborate 7-year development of the characters, countless subplots and backstories involving numerous aspects of all that is Superman: We get to see more about what Kryptonite is all about, we are puzzled by Jor-El and wonder what his intentions really are for his son, other Kryptonians pay us an occasional visit, we learn how he became the man he is, the sacrifices he had to make, where he got his values and morality from, and so many other insights. 

Lots of things from the comic books pop up now and then, such as Aquaman and Green Arrow (eventually even Supergirl). And we are blessed with guest appearances by friends from the old movies and shows, such as Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Dean Cain, and soon also Helen Slater.

It has drama, action, romance, comedy. Love, pain, sorrow and grief. Big budget, beautiful actors. The more you watch it, the more you want. I can't wait till the next episode."
