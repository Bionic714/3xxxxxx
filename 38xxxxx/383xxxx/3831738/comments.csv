,OrpheusDude,2008-08-23T12:23Z,"Thanks for the full movie (the other reliable source for it lops off the opening and closing credits), but when I ran it through DVD Flick and then burnt a DVD through ImgBurn, the audio was badly out of synch.  Has aonyone else had this problem?  I am going to try the entire process again, but any suggestions would be welcomed."
