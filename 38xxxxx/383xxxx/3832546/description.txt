This is the real deal folks, the iPhone 1.1.1 OS with no encryption, ripped from my iPhone using the same methods as Erica Sadun used here:

This is not useful for the random noob, but is very useful for iPhone hackers, since it will help make features currently only available on 1.1.1 available for hacked 1.0.2 iPhones.

This upload will probably result in a iTunes Wifi Store for 1.0.2, among with a couple of other useful things.


ENJOY!
