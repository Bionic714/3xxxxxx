,redarmy101,2008-04-04T15:36Z,can you get trainers for other games?
,foozballguy,2008-04-27T22:56Z,"For some reason this won't work for me. My game is updated to 1.3 and I've thoroughly read the instructions. Yet it doesn't work. It doesn't do anything all. Is there supposed to be some kind of indication that the effect is activated like some sound? If there is, then that's not coming up either. Please help :("
