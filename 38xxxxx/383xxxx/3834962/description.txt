*Notes
------

* Contruct Buildings - The graphic will still tell you the normal amount of turns
	it takes to consruct a building but it will be set to 1 when placed in
	the que.

* Maximum Recruits - When you enter the Recruitment Tab, you will see them

* Unlimited Movement - You need to be on the World Map and select Units that are not
	currently in a city.

* Maximum Character Skills - You also need to be on the World Map and select Units
	that are not currently in a city.  Be careful with this option!  It affects
	enemy characters as well!  Best method is to turn this on, carefully select
	your unit, then turn it off to avoid affecting other characters.
	

Now go out there and conquer the world!
