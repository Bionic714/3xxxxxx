""My first torrent"" - well, why make it available in the first place if you're NOT GOING TO SEED all parts, last time online was 10.10!?! ""Works 100%"" - we'll never know, as it never got 100% out!
""The movie is shit, that makes it so good :)"" - that's right, but this torrent is shit, because it's not out 100%... Thanks for nothing!"
