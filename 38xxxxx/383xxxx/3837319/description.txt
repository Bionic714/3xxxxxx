Fresh off his critically-acclaimed album "The Format", AZ returns once again to bless his fans with a unique offering entitled "The Memphis Sessions", a two disc set where each disc stands on its own. Disc One combines AZ's effortless flow with some of the most funky and soulful tracks you'll come across. The second disc is comprised of all new, never released AZ cuts that sound as good on the streets as they do in the club. The result is pure start to finish listening pleasure for the audience as AZ's most popular acapellas are blended with beats reminiscent of 1970's Memphis. The success of Guru's "Jazzmatazz" albums proves that combining Hip Hop with other genres of music is a cutting-edge theme that's bound to be more common in the future. AZ was first heard on Nas' classic "Illmatic" masterpiece back in 1994 when he laid down an incredible verse to the song "Life's A Bitch." Since then, he has released such gems as "Do or Die", "Pieces of A Man", "9 Lives", "Aziatic", "A.W.O.L", and most recently, "The Format." So sit back, relax, and let one of Hip Hop's most underrated emcees take you on a journey from the old to the new, from Memphis to NYC.
