,OGma59,2008-11-26T21:07Z,"are you fools for real?  Hatin on tupac for what?  First of all, he's dead, so what's the point of dissin how he lived?
 Secondly, he came from poverty like u've probably never imagined and became a millionaire - wft have ur dumb asses ever done?
Lastly, if you don't like his music, his lyrics or what he stood for, why are you lookin up his torrents.
by the way, just so you kno, i am white"

[T],Neiviesis1919,2009-11-14T20:50Z,"^ Guys i want comments but not stupid online fights. That goes more to the people responding to FuCtUpPuNk than him, He just asked a question. 
-TO 'FuCtUpPuNk' you gotta understand how hard it is to grow up in poverty, its not a joke like the suburbs (where i live).  Growing up in the 'Hood' is really life or death everyday.
-Tupac was definatly a smart guy.  He probly would have gone to college and got a 'real job' and contributed more to society, but he happened to make money rapping, good money, and why we he change. His rap has done good things for society and bad. Bad b/c it somewhat fules the gang wars taKING about me(us) vs you(them). And good b/c it shows that even a bad enviorment doesn't always mean stupid people, and also his fame and raps brought more light into the work that needs to be done to help lower income areas.
-Neway thanx for the comments every1 just try to keep them civil/construcrive, and remeber 'Eat 'em up, then Seed 'em up""

  Peace,
neIVIesis"

,thebigmbg,2011-05-14T08:59Z,Thanks You MILLIONS Times
,Mr.Buddha,2012-03-19T20:16Z,"@FuCtUpPuNk
I don't believe you know of what you are speaking... Tupac was not a gangster rapper he was just a poet, and was put down when he began speaking his mind. He knew that this world was not meant for the less fortunate and he knew we needed changes. "
