,frost1,2007-10-12T22:09Z,"I agree, but the copies distributed in the U.S. and the financing for the films were from 
Warner Bros. just like it says on the dvd or the film when you see it in theaters.  I didn't type anything below.  It's called copy past.  If you still have doubts please look it up yourself.  This info came from Yahoo Movies!"
