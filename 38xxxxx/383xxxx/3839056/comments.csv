Clearly, this guy is uploading a bunch of uncracked/unseeded/incomplete, misleading stuff here in order to make us pay for them through his web site!"

,Prempt,2009-01-26T17:55Z,"Despite following the directions, the license file is not working. I have NX 3/4 working but I can't get this one to. Yes, I've DL and followed the instructions listed and it doesn't work either."
,geotech,2009-01-28T03:30Z,"I would like to know if anyone has got this working successfully. 
Digger1960 provided a help doc....but The help document is incorrect and incomplete. It seems to blend NX4 and NX5 and will not work when you follow the step.
Would someone please post if they are successful with this program ?"

,jwebbzor,2010-02-11T04:24Z,"I've tried all the steps in the help document in various order... Plain and simple it doesnt work.
If anybody has gotten the NX 5.0 to install, please give explicit instructions."
,yeto,2010-10-02T14:43Z,"Hey everyone. Good upload but there is one mistake in the word file that I think corrupting the crakcing step. 
I think the problem in the setup -or crack I must say- is this: 
At the first step of the word file of crack, it says:

Run setup and select custom install and pick all options. When prompted for a license server name. Type in 27000@host with host being your computer name.

That's good. But when it wants us to edit the nx5.lic file's first line at the second step, it says;

SERVER pc ID=20070424 28000

That ""28000"" in the notepad must be ""27000"" as we wrote in our hosting option at first step.

I reinstalled it in this steps and it worked.

By the way, don't forget to copy the .dll files in the crack folder as lmnhand said. There are 3 .dll files and you can find the .dll files that you must change in the Program Files section at your hard disk as shown names in the crack folder."
