[V],velvetfog,2007-10-09T03:25Z,It is best to wait for a posting of the AVI version.
,fuckthesyst3m,2007-10-09T07:47Z,"When you say ""The real deal here"" do you mean that this is a DVD rip, or at least a TS that is better than the others currently on here?"
,fuckthesyst3m,2007-10-09T09:16Z,"So... This video is excellent quality, but it is the 1957 movie, not the 2007 remake that I was looking for."
,fuckthesyst3m,2007-10-10T05:40Z,^ That trailer is for the 2007 version. This is a black and white movie from 1957!
,LeoCrow,2008-02-24T03:53Z,"lol. 
The 1950 one ain't so bad... but you can get it in store for like five bucks. 
Thanks for posting anyway.."
