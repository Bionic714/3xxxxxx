  I recently installed a new OS and after I tried installing a few Acrobat 8 failures I packaged my own working Acrobat 8.1 installer/updater package.

  This will work for computers with previous versions of Acrobat or without, starting fresh. :D

AcroPro80_efg.exe..........................(English, Francais, Deutsch)
Adobe Acrobat 8 pro keygen UPGRADE.exe ....(Dr. Thril/ZWT)
CS2 keygen.exe.............................(by cvs/ssg)
Readme.txt

I included instructions (readme) for goobers and newbs...just because I'm nice â?º
Inside those instructions contains a serial for those who DIDN'T have Acrobat already installed (you will also need the CS2 Premium keygen included)

the acrobat pro was downloaded from the Adobe site, feel free to do so yourself and save time.


enjoy, â?²9-4hc
