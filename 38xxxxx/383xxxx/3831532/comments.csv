,YeArr,2007-10-06T07:33Z,let me know if there are any problems
,YeArr,2007-10-06T08:54Z,"Im curious, this is my first torrent upload so Ive ben monitering it to make sure i worked but I noticed I have 7 peers downloading in my bittorrent but 0 torrent downloads. just seems odd....."
,shannon50,2007-10-07T02:57Z,Please seed!
,YeArr,2007-10-10T09:46Z,"My upload bandwidth for this file seems slow but I am online 24-7 until at least two people have successfully downloaded it.

As I mentioned in the description I downloaded the installer from the adobe site so to save time get it from there and just get my keygens and readme.txt file for instructions if your not using the upgrade method."
,YeArr,2007-10-10T09:57Z,I cant post the adobe file address so Ill make another torrent for  just the keygens and direct links to the trials.
,YeArr,2007-10-10T09:58Z,"English, French and German

,YeArr,2007-10-10T10:04Z,"actually it's
http://trials[dot]adobe[dot]com/pub/esd/trial/Acro8trials/AcroPro80_efg.exe

but Im having trouble posting here on my own torrent. I thought it was a linking issue."
,susido,2008-05-11T08:23Z,How can this work when the CS2 keygen answer code generates 5 groups of 4 digits and the phone activation wizard requires SIX groups of 4 digits???
,YeArr,2008-08-06T12:46Z,"to susido,
both worked fine for me or else I wouldnt have uploaded it..if your having issues try another activator, after checking your version.
Ill look into it though"
