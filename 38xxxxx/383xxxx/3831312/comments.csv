Is there a tutorial or something?"
,holycrap6,2007-12-17T05:37Z,hey! thanx for the post. But i need seeds please. The download percent wont move at all. 
,holycrap6,2007-12-17T05:42Z,"i've put it in Azureus and it's downloading; hopefully it gets till the end and works well. Thats the good thing about having 2 torrent programs; transmission and azureus; if one doesnt work, u try the other."
,holycrap6,2007-12-17T05:44Z,i changed and used Azureus and it's downloading there; hopefully it works out all fine.
