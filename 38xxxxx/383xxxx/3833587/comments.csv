Seriously, who wants to distribute information in secret property formats?

Of course, there's software to read it available under a GPL license. All based on reverse engineering, because books should only be readable under a Windows operating system.

Why not pdf instead? Pdf is much more widely adopted and an open standard. (The ""p"" in pdf stands for portable.) Which means it is much more likely to be readable within the next 20 to 50 years than chm is."
