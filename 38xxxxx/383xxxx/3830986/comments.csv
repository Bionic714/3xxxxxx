,JohnnyZoltar,2007-12-07T09:53Z,"How the fuck do I get it to play in English. I mean I am German, and I cant fucking read German. WTF!"
,tostare,2008-01-04T15:38Z,"JonnyZoltar, there are other languages in the world, stop being an asshole.  If you googled for a few seconds you'd find this on the official site for the game - 

Hint for english users

To switch the in-game text to english, simply open the file carcassonne.cfg (usually located in C:\Programme\Koch Media\Carcassonne) and change the LANGUAGE parameter from 2 to 1. There you go: English interface."
,juice32,2008-03-21T12:49Z,How the fuck do I get it to play
,Nosliw99,2008-04-12T09:07Z,I need a keygen
,WingOfAFly,2008-12-15T01:15Z,You don't need a keygen.  There's a JPEG image included in the torrent with all the codes on.
,mrnee,2009-04-23T08:22Z,"WingOfAFly, TY"
,stagman21,2009-12-27T09:03Z,"works a treat - just follow the instructions in the comments above and you'll be sweet.  

just a tip for the young player - open the .cfg file with notepad and make the language change there.  Piece of piss.

Thank you chrisamy65."
,jazz111,2010-03-24T01:04Z,Ya It did not work for me to change the Language in the .cfg file? Is there anyone else who can help. I guess you can play in german but English would be nice. Any help please.
,archmagus,2010-06-13T22:33Z,"The language fix does work. If you're on Vista you might suffer from UAC, so copy the .cfg file to another location, edit it, save it, then copy it back to the original location."
,hizman,2011-07-29T23:04Z,Thank you very much! This is my favourite board game.
