The second episode of "Talent Suomi", the Finnish version of the "Talent" -franchise.

Audio is in Finnish and sadly I'm too lazy to make subtitles.


Recorded with a DVR to a .HAV then converted to an .MPG and from that to a .AVI and then compressed with XviD for video and MP3 for audio.

So here's the second episode, enjoy!

Third one will be out next week.
