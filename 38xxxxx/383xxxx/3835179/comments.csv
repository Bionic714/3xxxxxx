Here was that last thread: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3810711/Hemligheter.Kring.11.September.SWEDiSH.PDTV.XviD-BU#

And you bobdaslob, you should watch at least one of the documentaries before you open your mouth. You are doing your cia friends (employers?) a disfavor by raving like luny."

,mac.the.ripper,2007-10-09T20:20Z,"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaap. 
You´re still an ignorant stupid muhammedfuck,
Peakoil. Read my comment in the link - one more time. The stupid imbecile is you. Discussion closed. "
,PeakOil,2007-10-09T20:56Z,"mac...
You need to do your research. 
In May2001 Whitehouse gave $43 million dollars to the Taliban gov. 
And you just keep sounding dummer every time...."
,mac.the.ripper,2007-10-09T21:25Z,"Research, huh? In may 2001 lots of western governments supported the Taliban regime. 
US invaded Afgahnistan because of the Taliban support to al Quida after 9/11 - 2001.

My comment to u in the link was about CIA supporting the mujaheddin during Soviet occupation.  

You say you´re an ex scandinavian Hitlefuck who has educated yourself to a Muhammedfuck.... 

Well done....PeakOil. You´ve still got a hell of a lot to learn. Over and out."

,PeakOil,2007-10-10T00:08Z,"Mac, Read The Grand ChessGame by Brzezinski.
Afghanistan was needed for control of central asia and pipelines.

Yes, you are righ, I have learnt a fair bit. It is amazing what you discover if you just keep an open mind and put a little effort in.  And so muck more to learn.
Sadly I can hear on your tone that you are still completely out in the dark.

By the way, heard that the Iraqi death toll is up to about 1.2 million now and even Greenspan came out saying it was about oil. 
Any thoughts on that.  
Still think the was was about WMDs? Al Qaeda connections? Democracy???
Or do you just like massmurder because you dislike muhammeds and ahmeds?"
,Kemisten,2007-10-10T00:11Z,"US invaded Afghanistan becouse they needed space for the oil pipelines from the countries between The Caspian Sea and Lake Aral. By taking control of that area they prevented China and Russia to take control of the oil in that region. Another reason is to press Iran into i corner. (We must have in mind that USA is always supporting Israel.)
There is also a third reason for USA to attack Afghanistan that is only speculations and might just be conspiracys and that is to take control of the drug industri. Many big companies in the world have connections to the money laundry from drugs.  "
,mac.the.ripper,2007-10-10T00:11Z,"Jepp. With the support of UN. The truth is as simple as that, artylandia. Like the WTC 9/11. The truth is not so very hard to see for most people, accept for morons, neonazis and...muslims. 9/11 was an act of war against western culture and values, planned and executed by muslim jihadists - with no support from Bush nor CIA.
People need to wake up - not get high on shit like this torrent."
,mac.the.ripper,2007-10-10T01:48Z,"PeakOil. 

The politcal chessgame between the powers Russia, China, Europe and USA is of course a question of influences and control. This is politics and it happens all the time - in Irak, Sudan and Myanmar... 

When the idea raises that the war in Afganistan is  about US wanting to be the megasupplier of narcotics to the world, its bullshit from the low level brain of a sick moron.

The deathtoll in Irak is high. The simple truth is that most irakies are killed by muslims from Irak, Iran, Pakistan, Europe and... Allah akbar.

The war in Irak did not start with Bush´s invasion. The Irak conflict started with Saddams invasion in Kuwait and his threat against Saudi territory. Bin Laden will throw all kafers out of 
the holy arab nation and use the oil as a hostage to the western sivilisation.

Greespans comments must be seen in the context that friendly influences in the region are essencial to US and the free trade of oil. Greenspans words are not the great exposure of secrets you prefer to belive. 

European and Russian intelligence and the CIA belived in WMD. Saddam himselves helped to marketing the idea that he had WMD. He gassed thousands and he had the laboratorys, uncontrolled fascillities and the money needed. 

Saddams support to Jihadists in Palestine is a fact. Saddams was a tyrant - his regime a tyranny. Irak and Afganistan are trying to build their versions of democracy. The free world should support their struggle. In Iran people are raising against their tyrant, their tyranny and the mighty Ayatollahs.

The islamists want to deny muslims and finally every people in the world what we belive is freedom and democracy. Their islam is pure fascism. 

You´re right - i don´t like that kind of belivers in muhammed or white trash neonazi muhammedfuckers. 

Nuf said."
,PeakOil,2007-10-10T06:45Z,"What nuf said????
You just spilled out a bucket of horse manoure and think that is the final word?????

First of all, do you agree that US lied about the premises for for invasion??
Yellow cake purchases in Nigeria, Al Qaeda/911 connections, WMD's???

Do you agree that US is the only nation in the world that has used wmd's? 
First nuclear bombs in Japan and then depleted uranium in ME?

If they are indeed spreading democracy, how come they didn't care jack about Rwanda, North Korea, Burma???

You however seem to agree that there is a political game for control is it then far fatched to think Iraq and possibly in the near future Iran is not about control of region (which is same as oil cause all they have is oil and cat sand)?

By the way, regarding narcotics, the opium crops did increase dramatically since the invasion.  If you follow Mike Ruppert (ex LA drug police) you will also learn that he testifies that CIA is the biggest drug dealer in the world and he's got evidence to back up.

So you say muslims kill muslims. Thats right. 
But 1.2 million!!! That is the result of the war based on lies.  As long as You support that invasion You also wear some moral responsibility for it.

Europe and other nations joined because 
1) they were told lies by US
2) they were either with US or against
Australia has recently come out agreeing that they joined in as a token of alliance. Just like they followed US into Vietnam and why they are today spending billions on building battle ships for offensive war.

The Kuwait invasion was already over and done during Bush Snr's time. There was no need for Jr to go in.
Althought the reasons for Iraq invasion can be debated, it is likely Kuwait was pumping oil from oil wells belonging to Iraq.  This however did not bother It was the possibility of Saddam continuing down to SA/Ghawar that was the issue.

Now I don't know how you got Bush old partners the Bin Ladens involved in this as he had nothing to do with the matter.

So you think Greenspans comments creates more friendship?????  That US is stealing ME oil somehow creates stability??

So Saddam supported palestinaians who had their land stolen and have since been treated as third grade citizens.  Any surprise?  
ALL Muslim nations are aginst Israel.  

And where did you get this idea Afghanistan and Iraq were trying to build democracies?????
Common man now your thinking is just twisted. 
The issue is still that US has NOT cared about ANY democracy it wants oil and it will kill for it and use what ever justification it can think of.

Fascism comes in many shades.  Although I don't think the islamists are spreading this. Dictarorship yes, but not fascism.
Fascism, as Mussolini stated, can also be called corporatism. It is the marriage between private interests and state and is generally combined with strong nationalistic tendencies. 
Example, international bankers taking control of a nations money supply and creating scenarions for war where they can pillage the attacked nations resources, whilst being supported by a fanatical population thinking they are doing the right thing.  Sound more like USA.  (See Aaron Russo's America Freedom to Fascism and you'll get a good idea why there are wars.)

,PeakOil,2007-10-10T09:01Z,"Kissinger admits OIL drives US to Iraq and Iran

""Alan Greenspan had acknowledged what is blindingly obvious to those who live in the reality-based world: the Iraq War was largely about oil.


Meanwhile, Henry Kissinger says in an op-ed in Sunday's Washington Post that control over oil is the key issue that should determine whether the U.S. undertakes military action against Iran.""

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-weissman/greenspan-kissinger-oil_b_64659.html


The world is running tight on supply of conventional oil. 
Unconventional oil such as oil sands, tar, deep water etc is expensive and unlikely to fill the gap from falling produciton of conventional supplies.
NatGas is likely to peak produciton in a few years. 
Coal is plentyful but to a large degree of poor quality. 
Uranium will be in short supply in a couple of decades if planned nuclear plants go ahead.

As Cheney said, the American way of living is NOT negotiable. 
No way is the oil going to be used by the people in whose countries it happens to be and if necessary it will lead to a clash with the Chinese.

Oil has always been a magnet for war. 
US Gov will not hesitate to sacrifice human lives in order to control the most important resource on this planet.
Most people would not support this and therefore need to be lied to.

You´re still a Hitlerfuck in the shape of a fuckin white trash Muhammedfuck. Your truths are well known rightwing political crap and bullshit.

You say: ""- US is the only nation who has used WMD""? Lol....Hitler tried to get a nuke - japan tried to get one - US was the first and used it to stop a bloody war started by nazis and japanese imperialists.

,PeakOil,2007-10-10T14:00Z,"TRIED to get a nuke. 
Well many more than Hitler and Hirohito have tried and even GOT nukes. 
Israel for instance got them secretly and without signing the non-proliferation act.
So where are you going with that one?"
,PeakOil,2007-10-10T14:08Z,"You do know Prescot Bush, Bush Jr's grand father supported the National Socialists in Germany and worked with the people who finaced Hitler.  Same people who amongst other financed the Soviet communist revolution. 

Prescot's continued until his company's assets were seized in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act.

Guess who are the only two presidents who tried to stop the international bankers?????
Lincoln and JFK.

By supporting Iraq invasion you are indirectly supporting the dictatorship of the New World Order.

USA was created to be the worlds greatest democracy and that's how we all want it.
The price of freedom is however eternal vigilance.
Secondly, the American people are not the cause of this mess, it is mainly some powerful people who don't consider themselves American who have taken control and are pulling the strings.
