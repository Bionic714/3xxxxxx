Hello.


This is a part of the three-discs-set "R.E.M. Live", the audio one.

A third disc, containing a DVD with the full beautifully shot show, 
can only be found when you spend your money well and purchase this.

This first part presented in this torrent, only contains the 2 CD's 
(audio) to the show, and therefore don't deliver the full thing full swing.

If you like this, or even if you (rightfully) suspect you might like
the beautiful DVD, please purchase this set which goes on sale monday the 
15th of october at a CHEAP price.

Such cheap price releases should be especially encouraged,
to orient the dying music industry towards a less painful and overall better 
death.


This is R.E.M. and this is what they do Live.
