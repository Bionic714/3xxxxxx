A superb copy of the Simpsons Movie. Taken from the cinema production DVD. 


This movie is best played in a decent movie player such as Cyberlink DVD - where you can adjust panscan etc. Dont be fooled at the start of the movie by the bits cut off each side of the movie - its Bart messing about ;-)

If this movie does not play on your PC/Device you will need to install additional codecs. If this is the case google "FFDSHOW" and download it. This codec pack has most of the codecs used by all the various decoders so should see you OK for any future downloads.

Hope you all enjoy the movie & please seed for others.
