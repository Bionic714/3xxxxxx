13 is a new and very secret competition offering a grand prize of 100 million Baht.
The contestants are chosen from those most afflicted with problems involving work, money, family and love.
If they can complete 13 tasks, they will receive riches beyond their wildest dreams.
But there is a catch...the challenges will test them in every aspect of their lives from love to religion and even moral values.
They may seem undemanding when they start but as they progress they become increasingly more intense until finally,
they reach a stage where they are no longer sure if they are human anymore.
As with every game there are rules and these rules must be obeyed at all times.
If they fail even one of the tasks, they will be dismissed from the game.
The rules prohibit them from giving up from telling anyone else that they are playing and from investigating the origin of the game.
A man named Phuchit is delighted to be offered the chance to compete,
little realizing that it will cost him his friends, his family, his sanity and perhaps his life...What wouldnt you do for money?
