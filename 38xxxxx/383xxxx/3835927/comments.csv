,t3nguman,2008-01-24T08:28Z,This is just bloody stupid. WTF is wrong with normal codecs like divx/xvid/etc? Waste of my bloody time and bandwidth. Learn how to fucking encode keggy.
,Siovhan,2008-01-26T05:14Z,"no shit keggerman wtf is vp7 even w/the codec u recommend, no programs will convert it so i cant burn 'em.. ur a tard"
,ukmanthailand,2008-02-02T14:27Z,Why so rude? There's nothing worng with this torrent. Install the codec and play with Windows Media Player. It doesn't work with VLC. Quality is fine. Thanks for the upload K

,dodsy2008,2008-04-03T02:05Z,Nice upload K'man. ConvertingTOdisc takes me ages though since i have to do it twice with 2 different programs. Thanks very much though...!!! 
,rretarded,2008-04-24T16:42Z,"Stop being ass holes and just download the codec: http://www.free-codecs.com/VP7_download.htm
and watch it in Windows media player. Good quality btw."

,old_Grandma,2008-05-26T12:59Z,"This sucks, wont download this shit since it wont play on the dvd, who wants to sit infront of the comp and watch simpsons? Fat geeks."
,Xenity,2008-06-07T23:02Z,"Linux users can convert one of these 'VP7' files to a VLC-playable AVI file with this one-liner:
mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o /dev/null && mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:bitrate=950 -o destinationvideo.avi

Change 'somesourcevideo.avi' and 'destinationvideo.avi' to the input and output files respectively.  Requires 'mencoder' to be installed.  For batch processing, see the script on this page:

,L33t92,2008-06-26T12:45Z,KunZooR learn to read u fukin retard and go dl that codec
,jeffyjimbob,2008-07-14T12:47Z,Anyone complaining needs to take computer classes. Its called a codec they take 5 secs to download. Get the gom player it is free and way better than windows mp. 
,mick_leeds2003,2008-07-28T20:08Z,"I can't believe the attitude of some of the people on here.  The codec takes a minute to download and install, stop bitching and do it!

Of course if you want to convert the files to DVD to watch on a regular TV you could either:

1) rip them yourself, or
2) buy the DVD!

Oh, and the namecalling just makes you look silly.  Perhaps when you grow up you will realise this."
,bullwise,2008-08-27T18:17Z,"This codec is proprietary and probably won't ever be available on mac.

Thanks for the share, but it's so much of a pain to convert to mac friendly format (ie any standard format) that it isn't worth it."
,Catscan,2008-09-25T03:08Z,Great quality etc etc.. BUT! does not play on any of my DVD-players.. poor choise on the codec..
,2BRO2B,2008-10-28T05:05Z,"Too bad about the proprietary CODEC used here.  I would have liked to see these shows, too.  

Try a standard---i.e. MPEG, MP2, MP4 CODEC next time.  We can all use these.  Interoperability is the reason standards such as these were created!"
,Pujan7,2009-01-23T21:18Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent !
I have already downloaded and watched 7 complete Seasons ripped by Keggerman, and currently I am downloading the 8th Season.
All you have to do is to download VP7 Personal Edition (Free) Codec here: 
http://www.on2.com/index.php?615
And enjoy the good Video and Audio quality.
Many thanks to Keggerman
I am looking forward for next seasons."
,Anon476,2009-04-30T22:07Z,"Shame about the codec, would've been a good torrent otherwise. It's a bitch to set up on either OS X or Linux.

Don't see why people can't just use more standard codecs when ripping things, much easier both for the ripper and downloaders"
,funkiejj,2009-05-07T18:33Z,it is http://www.on2.com/file.php?85 to download
,SirOsisOfLiver,2009-06-15T17:29Z,A:10 V:10 once you have d/l vp7 plays great on nero and divx. thank you for the u/l. 
,peejay3,2009-08-17T14:55Z,"tks tks, will seed and seed..."
,FancyBot,2010-03-21T19:58Z,Don't bother downloading if you're running OS X.  The VP7 codec isn't open source and will probably never be available on anything but windows.  Why people share proprietary formats is a mystery.  Mp4 is fine.
,TheLizardKingMike,2011-01-28T05:13Z,"Sure, it would have been nice if KEGGERMAN had used Divx or Xvid, but if it's too much trouble to download and install a codec, you really shouldn't be complaining. 

The quality is very nice. Thank you."
,uran235,2011-03-18T19:16Z,typical german; can't make a good dvd rip torrent  - shame on you
,Shuffle_,2011-04-07T22:35Z,Thank you! Great torrent!
,jesscarra,2011-07-12T20:55Z,"Why the hell would you do something so stupid as to use a proprietary codec, when there are much better and more used codecs out there?  You know something everyone uses?"
,finisher489,2011-09-17T13:37Z,Guys stop critiscing KEGGERMAN on codecs and stuff!!! The codec just takes a few mins to download and a few seconds if u have a fast PC like me and if you're too stupid to deal with torrents go watch on those stupid blurry internet sites that those desperate maniacs like u watch on!!!!! KEGGERMAN is uploading loads of the amazing seasons from b4 and they all rox and they're all amazing quality!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll give feedback on the quality and resolution of this video
