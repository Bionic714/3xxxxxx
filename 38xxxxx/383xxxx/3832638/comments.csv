,krismekle,2007-10-07T06:55Z,"Thank you so much for bringing us this vickyk73, it's a godsend because they are delaying our broadcast here in Australia until 1AM because of the Rugby World Cup. I look forward to the actual race as well!"

,vickyk73,2007-10-07T12:28Z,I hv already uploaded 5 gigs so far. PPl have to understand they have to keep their upload speeds to full so other people can also finish downloading faster.

,midkhan,2007-10-08T09:54Z,Thank you Vicky.  Now where is the race ;).
,pbiltNY08,2007-10-08T17:09Z,Thank you Vicky -- you're a lifesaver. Any chance you will seed the race soon? I didn't tape the first hour (stupid new dvr).

,pbiltNY08,2007-10-09T00:16Z,"Awww -- I was really hoping to see the speedTV coverage. Please don't make me watch the ITV coverage (they don't seem to realize there are guys on the track not named Lewis Hamilton). 

Will anyone out there seed Speed? "
,SDL69,2007-10-09T08:46Z,"pbiltNY08, can you blame ITV?  Hamilton is kinda good.  And, at least vicky gave us a link to the race.  Maybe later someone will up the SPEED broadcast.

Thanks vicky"
