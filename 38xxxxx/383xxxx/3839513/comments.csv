,michael63000,2008-12-29T00:57Z,"Downloader BEWARE!:

This does not work at all. When you go ahead and fire the updated game up it never load. Don't download unless this problem is resolved. WARNING! "
,michael63000,2008-12-29T02:55Z,The Startup screen comes up for 1 second then I hear a beep (sound) and it goes blank. 
,mondolfo,2009-03-26T21:52Z,bad crack
,VelanoH,2010-02-05T08:26Z,"Just a suggestion.  Before you overwrite the original, rename the original so that you can restore it if something goes wrong."
,kaliver,2011-09-03T15:26Z,"Thanks, works perfectly.

Installed the RELOADED version, then downloaded patch 1, 2 and 3 from a file host. Installed those. Backed up the medieval2 exe, then copied this crack into the game directory. The game fired up without a problem."

,juniorrude123,2012-02-24T17:06Z,"Hi guys, does anyone else have a this bug?

At random intervals during the turn-based map, it randomly ""quick loads"" - this is especially annoying much later in the game when you've spent 10 minutes managing your entire kingdom only for it to go back to the start of the round.

A similar thing happend during battles where it will freeze breifly then, 1. bring up the ""console"" so I can't see what I'm doing and 2. speed the game up to full speed so I lose control of my strategy and finally 3. the sound disappears.

Any idea if there's a Keyboard shortcut error or just a general bug? Anyone else get this problem?

Otherwise this is an AMAZING game 10/10 "
