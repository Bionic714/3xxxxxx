I have some more classics coming that are not currently here at the Bay.  Some spaghetti westerns and US westerns.  Fastest Gun in The West (Glenn Ford) is coming next."

,madmax999,2008-02-17T08:05Z,As long as I can I will make sure the ones I post as available. I may stop my seeding on some items while I put up new ones but I'll make sure that they are active several times a year.  And absolutely I will put them up if I see a request.
