Classic spoof on the western genre.  It is the follow-up (not sequel) to Support Your Local Gunfighter.  James Garner plays a cowboy wandering through town on his way to Austalia.

Harry Morgan, Bruce Dern, Walter Brennan, Joan Hackett and other great character actors and the soon to be stars.

The movie is great fun.

Rated old style PG.  You can let the kids watch.  They don't even finish the words "Horse ****".

English only, no subs. Avi format.  GREAT quality.
