,DonKe33,2008-02-28T09:09Z,"Codec VP7  Not For Mac Computers... 
Great Upload Thank you keggerman.. but why Why WHy why why... do people continue to use these little unsupported non-mainstream codecs?

I mean VP7 might be nice and all but its not all that great. "
,Flatskjerm,2008-04-15T01:35Z,You really suck at uploading.
,crook16 ,2008-04-17T07:45Z,damn you put in alot of work into this so imma try them   thanks in advance
,Xenity,2008-06-07T23:01Z,"Linux users can convert one of these 'VP7' files to a VLC-playable AVI file with this one-liner:
mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o /dev/null && mencoder somesourcevideo.avi -oac copy -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:bitrate=950 -o destinationvideo.avi

Change 'somesourcevideo.avi' and 'destinationvideo.avi' to the input and output files respectively.  Requires 'mencoder' to be installed.  For batch processing, see the script on this page:

,Warfish,2008-09-02T22:50Z,"Complete waste of time  for Mac users. The   format 
used (this VP7 piece of crap) does not work on Mac,  
has no codec available and I can't find any way of making the file work on my mac short of some level of code re-writing only known by sad 400 pound virgins in their mum's basement.
Don't bother with it. Why go to all this effort  just to use such a rare  file type? Waste of time."
,Cadwalader,2008-09-14T10:15Z,"Hi, I'm a Mac. Hi I'm a PC. So PC, what are you going to do tonight? I think I'm going to watch the Simpsons Season3... how about you, Mac? Well, PC, that codec doesn't exist on my platform, so I think I'll be going to bed early tonight.  Apple - Think Different!"
,transpar3nt,2008-10-08T02:44Z,"Okay, for windows users go to the address below, it's a direct link to the VP7 codec installer that's simple to use and directly makes these videos usable in Windows Media Player.  I scanned it with Kaspersky and Spybot, it's clean.

,Siovhan,2008-11-02T19:43Z,keggerman's an idiot with a vp7 up his ass. u can view vp7 on computer but not convert/burn
,Autumn13,2008-11-10T22:58Z,"I use Winamp, and have downloaded the codec from the link, and the video is still upside down. I uninstalled it and made sure I had the most current one, and still the video is upside down. It does work fine in DivX, but Winamp is what I mainly use. 

Any help?"
,Jixie,2008-12-14T11:56Z,does this work as mp4?
,Pujan7,2009-01-23T21:04Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent !
I have already downloaded and watched 7 complete Seasons ripped by Keggerman, and currently I?m downloading the 8th Season.
All you have to do is to download VP7 Personal Edition (Free) Codec here: 
http://www.on2.com/index.php?615
And enjoy the good Video and Audio quality.
Many thanks to Keggerman
I?m looking forward for next seasons?"
,understated,2009-02-13T01:49Z,"Hey what's this fuss about? I've downloaded several seasons of simpsons from keggerman and he has delivered every time, top notch! Can't believe there should be something wrong with this one either, so im saying in advance, stop bitching and show some gratitude.

And tnx for the nice torrents ;O"
,daml112,2009-03-30T17:38Z,this dudes a loser vp7 is SHIT quality. And unsupported. And the fucking video is stretched. And cropped widescreen. Give me the other half of my video back cunt.
,MsGarbo,2009-08-02T05:47Z,"Why does anyone want to use MAC ?????
Thanks for this it works just fine as the others."
,npsingh,2009-08-23T18:06Z,"A solution for VP7 codec on a Mac. I have used this and know that this works.

Just download the MPlayerOSX 1.0rc2 (thats the version i used) from here :
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayerOSX_1.0rc2.dmg

and the essential codecs for mac package from here : 

http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/essential-macosx-x86-20060611.zip

Install both of them and then play vp7 encoded video with MPlayer OSX. Works Flawlessly!

(thanks to scott for the fix ;).. )"
,npsingh,2009-08-23T18:16Z,I also checked on the latest version of MPlayer OSX that wass some version 8b4. Did NOT work on that. Only Version 1.0rc2 :)
,npsingh,2009-08-23T18:35Z,"@ MsGarbo

People want to use the Mac, coz frankly, Windows SUCKS.
