,olitek23,2008-01-10T19:03Z,can anyone pleeeease help me out with recycle .. it keep asking me about a cd ?? 
,crimes6,2008-01-17T22:04Z,"yeah i cant figure the cd thing out for recycle either.
everything i have downloaded has had an iso image to mount. maybe this one does.
maybe i just havent found it yet.
if anyone can help or just post an iso image of recycle it would be greatly appreciated."
,crimes6,2008-01-18T00:39Z,"okay.
this is the answer to everyone that is having trouble with the recycle cd.

after you install recycle (make sure to put the recycle icon on your desktop as it makes it alot easier to find.) 

 go into the 
same folder where you extracted all the files to.
find the icon that says patch and keygen its orange with a key on it.

open it.

click the patch button. when the browser pops up find your recycle icon highlight it and click open.

start up recycle.

it will ask you name and some other shit.

where it says license at the bottom use the same patch and keygen ap that you just used but this time only click get serial number.

copy and paste it into license in recycle.

the program should open up and be godlike.

,rincewinded,2008-01-20T19:43Z,"Looks Like ReWire might be a trojan.  Empty install path.  It installs something, but it's not ReWire."
,IamLiving,2008-01-26T18:31Z,"the only program in this toolpack that works is recycle. but thats all I wanted it for. and recycle works just fine.

refill, reload and rewire.......????? no bueno."

,juicebox666,2008-06-18T18:18Z,"When I try to open Recycle on Vista 64 after installing with the crack I get an error ""Recycle cannot run after an unexpected error"". Any ideas how to fix?"
,BigBishop2121,2008-06-23T21:44Z,"Vista uses Disabling UAC will give U the right permissions to patch Recycle.exe.

Heres how you do it: 
1.) Run ""msconfig""
2.) click on the ""Tools"" tab
3.) Select ""Disable UAC""
4.) Click the Launch button
5.) Reboot your computer

JuiceBox666 this link that EternalRuler posted should fix your problem running a 64bit OS.

,Kompleteidiots,2009-03-17T16:56Z,"nothing wrong with this one........HOW DO YOU INSTALL REFILL PACKER.....

you install...

Then it gets a little vague..little help"
,mistafisha911,2009-04-20T12:29Z,hmm... i don't see the keygen for reload
,WId0W,2009-05-30T20:33Z,"This is quite annoying, I've never had any issues with installing cracked apps, until now. The only thing i want from this is Recycle so have only d-loaded the first two files.

I open the folder right click the install.exe, run as admin ( as I'm on vista). The install pops up, installs fine so i have the installed data in my program files directory. This is where i hit a brick wall. NOTHING happens when i click to open recycle.

I've also tried uninstalling it, reinstalling and using the patch to remove the CD check function, even by directing it to the actual .exe in the program files recycle sub-directory rather than the desktop shortcut, then i hit the same brick wall. Nothing happens, at all... Nothing pops up nothing boots, nothing nothing nothing...., its as though the exe is empty....

The same issue happens with various different downloads of Recycle from different sources.

It's seriously stumped me.

Any ideas?"
,Thabz,2009-05-31T06:05Z,Yo! what's up with the reload keygen? Put it in! It isn't there.

,cantech,2011-09-09T02:08Z,this is my third time downloading this very same bookmarked torrent because of upgrades and lack of file planning ahead to have a copy later.. there is nothing wrong with this torrent. it has worked fine for me for almost 4 years. the only thing I see wrong here is a certain Ignoranus that likes to spout off with verbal diarrhea whenever it hits
