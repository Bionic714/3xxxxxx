                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wuhan is a city in central China about the size of London, and it is here 
that director Weijun Chen has conducted an experiment in democracy. A grade 
3 class at Evergreen Primary School has their first encounter with democracy 
by holding an election to select a Class Monitor. Eight-year olds compete 
against each other for the coveted position, abetted and egged on by teachers 
and doting parents.

Elections in China take place only within the Communist Party, but recently 
millions of Chinese voted in their version of Pop Idol. The purpose of Weijun 
Chen√Üs experiment is to determine how, if democracy came to China, it would be 
received. Is democracy a universal value that fits human nature? Do elections 
inevitably lead to manipulation? Please Vote for Me is a portrait of a society 
and a town through a school, its children and its families.
