Overview: The "Scenario Directed By" credit is rare, but Lung Yi-Sheng warranted it for two memorable Shaw movies starring the lovely and lethal Kara Hui Ying-Hung. This is the first--a beautiful fight fantasy of lute demons, magical arrows, bottomless abysses, and arduous quest, hermaphrodites, a villain named "Red-Haired Evil", and a mischievous knight named "Old Naughty". It's little wonder Lung also directed, since another director might inadvertently deflate this delicate, but delightful, confection.
