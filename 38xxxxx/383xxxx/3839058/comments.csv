,agibaer,2007-11-09T20:00Z,thanks!
,Scorpwanna,2007-11-10T04:50Z,Just the slight problem of it playing a few seconds to fast. The movie originally is an hour and 36 min but it appears that the frame rate was crunched when someone ripped this and made the movie an hour and 31 min which causes it to sound like everyone is younger than they are. I hate when people rip wrong :(.

,MadkillXL,2008-10-13T18:04Z,"Well, this actually works pretty well for me, all those with problems I think you just need to get latest codecs.
Basically, it not Huff's fault you're having problems.

You guys with problems(and anyone else who gets problems) just need to download DivX which will install a shit load of codecs onto your computer for 'ALL' media programs which handle audio/video etc.

This DvDRip is 100% A-Okay. Thanks Huff. ^^"
