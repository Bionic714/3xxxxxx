,Autobogg,2010-01-17T06:35Z,"No...You're thinking of the second season of WOTW series. Duncan MacLeod doesn't join the resistance against the Newcomers until Willy (the kind gentle Visitor) admits he looks like Freddy Kruger and the Visitor's plans for humans are made known to Earth and Detective Sikes. Detective George Fransisco and The Beastmaster fight each other on top of the Eiffel Tower and Alf gets the biggest Quickening ever on the show! Then, Ray Walston comes out of the Martian ship and says to Bill Bixby in the Mor-Tax language, ""Tu Doh, Nakeetay!"" (Translation) ""There Can Be Only Prataynama."" "
