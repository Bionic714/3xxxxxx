Review from Synthpop.net:
Mesh can quite easily be called one of the major and best bands on the
electronic pop scene in Europe today and it's only a matter of time before they claim that title in the States as well. With that being said, the boys from Bristol are back after a two year hiatus and as a result of that time away, we are offered thier strongest album to date.

Granted, they didn't run off and reinvent themselves (why would they need to?), "Who Watches Over Me" picks up right where "The Point at Which it Falls Apart" left us without missing a beat. While their programming does seem to have taken a bit more of an aggressive approach, much in the vein of "You Didn't Want Me", "Who Watches Over Me", which is due to be released on April 8th on the Home Records label in Germany, is full of all the things we have come to expect and love of Mesh.

I sat here staring at the sceen trying to figure out which song or songs to focus on but each and every one seems to shine on its own merrit. Every song a masterpiece with great lyrics that focus on Marks trademark of love lost and the hardships that plague all our relationships. The music arrangements are clever, with layers of sounds and effects which set the atmosphere to pull you deeper into the music and their mindset.

This is definately going to be one of the big hits of 2002 or I'm hanging up my headphones and turning off the turntable.

Enjoy!
