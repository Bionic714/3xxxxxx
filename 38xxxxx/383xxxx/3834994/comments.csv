FILE ""Snatcher.iso"" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2048
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 02.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 02 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 03.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 03 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 04.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 04 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 05.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 05 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 06.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 06 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 07.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 07 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 08.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 08 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 09.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 09 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 10.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 10 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 11.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 11 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 12.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 12 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 13.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 13 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 14.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 14 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 15.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 15 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 16.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 16 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 17.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 17 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 18.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 18 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 19.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 19 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 20.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 20 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 21.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 21 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""Snatcher 22.mp3"" MP3
  TRACK 22 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

then save the file as ""Snatcher.cue"" in the same directory as all the other files, then open this file in your CD burning software instead of the iso file in order to burn both the data and the audio tracks.

Hope this helps!"

,Rusty_Rake,2010-08-20T13:25Z,Please seed...i beg you dude:D
,mutekiazy,2011-08-19T17:14Z,"The .CUE was helpful, but don't you need to convert the MP.3's to .WAV's before you can burn them to a Sega CD compatible disk?"
