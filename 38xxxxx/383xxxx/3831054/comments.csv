I'm not sure if they existed during the 80's but their music is quite good but nobody seems to post it anywhere. Hope you had their albums and post it here. Thanks. I've downloaded a lot of your posts here. Great job. I'm into rare 80's too."

 Unfortunately I'm too late here, no seeders, both major thanks anyway for this and loads of other great uploads, 80z!!  

I hope I'll be able to find this album at a later time."
,Lanfear,2008-10-14T17:26Z,"Just a heads up: this excellent album is now being re-seeded over here:
