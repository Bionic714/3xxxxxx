Rare 80s - Feat. Music For Pleasure - Into The Rain [1982]

I am going to start uploading ultra rare 80s albums that are normally out of print or too expensive to buy online. I start with Music For Pleasure - Into The Rain which was released in 1982. Music For Pleasure was an obscure 80s new wave band. I am sure it will be both a surprise and a pleasure to the new wave lovers. there's any rare 80s album you want to be uploaded as priority you're welcome to put a comment here, otherwise I will go with one or two albums a day chosen on no particular order from my archive!
