Ianuaria, born in 1981 in Austria, is a dj since 1996  
and is producing his own music since 2002.                
He started his musical career at the age of 6. As a          
drummer he visited the music school for eleven years    
and played in various kinds of ensembles.                
In the 90's he started off as a DJ. He bought his          
first psytrance record and directly fell in love with    
this kind of music. He became familiar with the scene  
and several years ago, he and some friends started        
organizing parties for their own association              
'Klangbewusstsein'.                                          
Producing his own music has always been a dream for      
Ianuaria. After deejaying for many years, he started      
producing psychedelic trance in 2002. After spinning          
around Ianuaria is in great demand and one of the        
most successful producers in Austria.                  
The type of music he produces can be best described      
as groovy, with apositive mystic vibe and trippy,            
catchy elements.                                        
A must have for every DJ.                                
Enjoy!                                                  
We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying.
MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands !!
You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout.
Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much!
Our releases are for scene internal use so
KEEP THEM OFF P2P AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES!!
So much for now ...
meet ya @ the next party ... somewhere.
MYCEL - sending lamers to /dev/null since 2003
We bow our heads to our old friends.    
Deep respect to you!              
Also we would like to greet all of the      
still alive quality scenegroups/sceners!
