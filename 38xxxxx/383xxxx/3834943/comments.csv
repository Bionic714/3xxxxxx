?Of course it?s about oil, we can?t really deny that,? Abizaid said of the Iraq campaign early on in the talk. 

?We?ve treated the Arab world as a collection of big gas stations,? the retired general said.

No problem with a few thousand dead soldiers, tens of thousands with Gulf war syndrom (from depleted uranium and chemicals), unknown number of dead blackwater mercenaries (and other private ""security contractors"") 1.2 million dead Iraqis. Now they plan to repeate the same with Iran.
Still think these people had any hesitation sacrificing a couple of thousand during 911 to get the justifications for war?  A cheap price for these men."
