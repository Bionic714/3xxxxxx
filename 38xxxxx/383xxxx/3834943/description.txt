                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week, we look at the turning of the political tide in the U.S., as 
Washington assesses its Iraq strategy and girds itself for the future. We have 
reports from CBC correspondent, Nahlah Ayed inside Iraq. And feature interviews 
with Washington Post columnist, David Ignatius and with Phil Donahue, once a 
famous American talk show host, now the director of a moving documentary about 
the Iraq war.

As we have followed the course of the Iraq war, we have seen a clear trajectory 
from early bravado, to confusion over the unanticipated chaos and now to a 
sense of failure, as the death count of American soldiers and Iraqi civilians 
mounts.

The majority of Americans now believe that the war was a mistake and the 
administration of George W. Bush is confronting the difficult challenge of what 
to do next. The dilemma: how to declare some kind of victory and get out of 
Iraq without further destabilizing the country and the region?

Brian has always respected the shrewd analysis of David Ignatius. He is a 
renowned diplomatic correspondent for the Washington Post who has covered the 
wars and upheavals of the Middle East for many years. Ignatius, by the way, is 
also a writer of fabulous espionage novels. He has followed the dramatic arc 
of the Iraq war closely and joins Brian this week to discuss Washington's 
awful dilemma.

The CBC is now one of the only major television networks with reporters inside 
Iraq, so dangerous a place has it become. The CBC's Nahlah Ayed and Margaret 
Evans and their crews are there this week sending back daily reports on the 
situation on the ground. It's a mixed and contradictory picture. We show two 
reports by Nahlah Ayed. In the first one, she examines the desperation of many 
people in the capital as they struggle without basic services and constant 
danger. In the second report, she travels with US soldiers who show her some 
evidence of their success in establishing security.

A majority of Americans now disapprove of the way President George Bush is 
handling Iraq. It wasn't always like that. When he launched the war, Bush had 
strong public and political support. Phil Donahue, the famous talk show host, 
was among the minority who passionately denounced the war from the very 
beginning, losing his TV show for his efforts. About a year ago, he met an 
American soldier who was shot only a week after arriving in Iraq, leaving him 
paralyzed from the chest down. Donahue decided to track both the man's life 
and the memorable vote in the Congress and Senate that gave Bush full 
authority to invade Iraq. The film is called "Body of War." Brian's 
conversation with Donahue is lively and compelling.
