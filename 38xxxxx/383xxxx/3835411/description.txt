                                   Presents


Yuppy Love:

80's fever is spreading fast! Del's on the up and up - into the exciting world of red braces and yuppy shirts. Meanwhile Rodney's pulled a classy new girlfriend called Cassandra. But what will she think of Nelson Mandella house?

Danger UXD:

Just faking a signature on a delivery note means that Del can take possession of 50 dolls for absolutely nothing. The only problem is that "Lusty Linda" and "erotic Etelle" are not exactly what he had in mind.

Chain Gang:

The opportunity to buy 250 18ct gold chains from a retired jeweller, Arnie, is something Del can't resist. Everything is fine until Arnie is taken seriously ill just as the deal is about to be sealed and Del is left feeling all that glitters...

The Unlucky Winner Is:

Rodney has won a holiday for 3 in the mediterranean, courtesy of Del and the Megafakes drawing competition. The only snag is he's got to pretend to be 14 years old all week.

Sickness and Wealth:

Excruciating stomach cramps and a constant diet of health salts might drive some people to visit a doctor, but not Del. Oh no, he's only suffering from that scourge of all serious yuppies, PMA. (Positive Mental Attitude!)

Little Problem:

With his diploma in computor science, new job in Cassandra's father's firm and impending marriage, Rodney's certainly on the up. But meanwhile, Del's got himself into a bit of bother over some hooky mobile phones with the less than understanding Dricoll brothers!

Enjoy!

Please Seed!
