Appart from being hypocritical and cherished by an establishment willing to get cleared from this kind of accusation, they also never mention the natture of a society entirely feeding on such practice, and financing them of course.

If I eat, something suffers. I assume it and blame no one about it.

Thank you for the great FF ULs."
