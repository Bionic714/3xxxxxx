Rare 80s - Feat. Mi-Sex - Computer Games [1980]

Even in the often strange and incestuous history of New Zealand rock, few bands enjoyed a more bizarre career than Misex; led by onetime cabaret singer Steve Gilpin, the group emerged from art-rock beginnings to later reinvent themselves in the style of the new wave. The band moved to Australia in the late 70s, a move proved highly successful, and in 1979 they issued their debut LP, Computer Games. The single, "Computer Games," topped the Australian charts, and the group made a triumphant return to New Zealand. A second album, 1980's Space Race, was also a hit, but when a planned American tour fell through, Misex's momentum took a serious blow; even at home, audiences were dwindling, and 1981's Shanghaied made little impact. Hodgkinson soon exited, to be replaced by ex-Coup D'Etat drummer Paul Dunningham; a few minor hits followed, including "Castaway" and "Blue Day," but after 1984's Where Do They Go? failed to crack the charts, Misex disbanded. Steve Gilpin died in 1991.
