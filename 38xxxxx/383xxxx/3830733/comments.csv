,krackaboi,2007-10-13T20:26Z,I thought it would have been a good movie too if people would have seeded it.  I give up.
,RubberTow,2007-10-20T19:00Z,"It's seeded well, and I'm still seeding. You need to look on another torrent site  other than this one. a tip: some sites suck. for instance MinioNova has hardly any of my rips because they banned me in the very beginning for putting up allegedly fake torrents, but I screwed a couple up when I was a newbie. Others, like Summo, bush, fenopy, just plain suck. But this movie is seeded and you can download it if you go to the right torrent site and download their torrent for it. Plus you can download the DVD and rip it like I did - RUBrTOE"

,RubberTow,2007-12-02T21:42Z,"There were two Burt Reynolds movies in which he played this character, White Lightning and Gator. I am seeding both right now. To all those of you whining about seeding and giving up: you are idiots and have no frigging clue as to how bandwidth works and how these programs work and how you got other movies a lot faster. You got other movies a lot faster because it was well seeded and you downloaded it simultaneously from several people. I am the only person, the only seed for this file. You cannot get it fast from one person. Here is and example of my uploads right now: I've got over 200 people in line for 8 files. once my uploads get going, and I only have a grand total of about 60 kbps for uploading (that's all my internet provider gives me, apparently because I have it wide open an my torrents prioritized above the rest) . sometimes I have an average of 4 people simultaneously downloading each of the 8 files, which I cannot control. there are no settings in my torrent program for that. There are only settings for the over all amount of connections, not per torrent. That means that at least 32 downloaders are competing for the 60 kbps bandwidth on my computer. That isn't counting the extra competition from people getting files from me while I am downloading the file myself. I can't shut them off either. I have them throttled to 1 kbps each, but when there is 10 to 15 of them, the each take 1 kbps per file away from my bandwidth.  The bottom line is that all you whiny fucks that have no earthly clue as to how this stuff works know now and I'm sick of hearing your stupid whiny asses complain. If you want my newest files, it's going to take at least a couple weeks until it get's seeded well and you can get it from others. If people download it and delete it, it never get's seeded. That is happening with Gator right now, I've been seeding it a long time and nodody is helping me."

,70351,2012-03-27T13:52Z,"Great movie and I've been looking for it for some time now. I recall renting it (VHS tape) from my local Hollywood Video store around 2006 but didn't want a copy of a stinkin tape.

I am seeding this and ""White Lightning"" for those who love these movies :)"
