,lazabar,2009-11-18T18:24Z,"about the problem with loading the parks: all i did was re-installing the game and DONT press ""never register"" you DO need to register the game (just type in any random name and E-mail). then it should work just fine. thanks a mill for the game:D"
,203Demon203,2009-12-02T04:46Z,"@Lusen_1337

I wouldn't be bitching about slow seeds, I'm getting up to 1mb/sec , and I don't think you should be complaining when you haven't uploaded anything to the site. I bet you're one of those people who downloads something but doesn't seed it back to everyone else."
,zulch_,2009-12-13T06:55Z,"Okey, I need a guide for dummies here cause I know NOTHING about this (ISO? Mounted? Deamontools?). Can anyone please explain exactly what I need to do moore than download the file? Please use baby-language.. Thank you so much."
