,vajlent,2007-10-08T16:15Z,"Have had this ""new sid"" generator running for 3 hours now and nothing happens???
what a f* is wrong with it???"
,Gbriel,2007-10-08T19:19Z,This is build 32.
,zz4spd,2007-10-08T21:42Z,"this is where i got newsid.exe:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Utilities/NewSid.mspx"
,zz4spd,2007-10-08T21:44Z,"dude, i think you downloaded from somewhere else coz this is definately 6.0.0 Build 49, and workin great."
,vajlent,2007-10-08T22:11Z,"Yeah, but it doesn´t support Vista?!"
,zz4spd,2007-10-08T22:24Z,"well its on my Vista Lite right now, it supports xp 32bit and Vista 32, 64bits. If you're on Vista now, you have to disable the UAC and anti-virus/spyware. then try again."
,vajlent,2007-10-08T22:31Z,"Ok, i´ll try it out but then i´ll also get a trojan in gift ;)"
,zz4spd,2007-10-08T23:30Z,just disable the protection during the newsid process
,vajlent,2007-10-09T06:37Z,"Haha, what a joke!!!
I left the computer on over night and nothing have happend!

It raises to 100% CPU usage,
Nothing happens, the computer not even working!

How long should it take?

What´s wrong?!

(I´ve done this before but on XP and it was no problem...)"
,zz4spd,2007-10-09T07:37Z,"NOTE: this is build 32 for XP and 49 for Vista 

Gbriel, we both stand corrected. They are the same but different builds once installed on different Windows. Just found that out."
,zz4spd,2007-10-09T07:38Z,"vajlent,

I would Google it, because I'm a stupid noob in this department."
,zz4spd,2007-10-09T07:52Z,"vajlent, I just uploaded a torrent which might help out. It is new release by EMBRACE where you don't change the SID on your PC, have a look my friend."
,Gbriel,2007-10-09T08:15Z,"Yup.... after proper uninstall and cleaning the registry (second time even more precise) the third install still shows build 32, but whatta heck... I can live with that :)
Lately I've tested diffferent Windows packages (Vista's and XP's) and done NewSid several times without any problems. Always done that on fresh installed Windows. Looks like it crawls through every file so if someone has hell of a lot small files it probably takes a lot time. I have two 160 Gb HD's...newsid runs for about ten minutes or so. Now the weird part.... after testing.... heck... I quess I'm buying the shit. Just to support the good work! ...what's wrong with me...."
,vajlent,2007-10-09T08:39Z,I´ll test the other one mate!
,713tex,2007-10-18T20:41Z,"@zz4spd
Can you make a torrent for Stardock's Icon Package or for Object Desktop, which includes everyone of their little programs?That would be very cool : )"
,fille87,2007-12-11T20:51Z,"There is a package with all (or most) of the stardock applications. Go to this link: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3882766/Stardock_Products_2007_(AIO)_WindowBlinds__IconX__and_others

Then you get the applications, serials/cracks to unlock (but windowblinds are only v. 5.5 or 5.0, and it didn't work on my comp)..."
,dscm,2007-12-31T05:08Z,file87 that's a badlink! it says 404 Not Found.
,StonedChipmunk,2008-02-02T15:18Z,"fille87's link is down.

I've been running NewSID for... about 14 hours so far. Then again, I have a 150gb drive with approximately 180,000 files on it, and my registry is huge.

Plus, during normal security descriptor scans on the occasional disk checks during boot, it takes a good 3 or 4 hours because I totally bombed this computer. May have to wipe and reload it soon...

Anyways, if anyone has any idea why this may not be done for the next week or so let me know. I'm afraid to stop it at the risk of screwing up my computer."
,StonedChipmunk,2008-02-04T01:36Z,"Okay, yeah, this has taken nearly 40 hours (I miscounted last time). Any suggestions on what to do? I don't see much hard disk activity."
,herc01111,2008-03-14T18:30Z,"i have tried over 6 different versions but have never been able to get to activate. tried this one once and was perfect. changed SID in 25 min. 
this is such a cool app.

thanks for the upload zz4spd"
,Melfett,2008-04-18T14:58Z,"I tried this, but it screwed up my comp :/

When I turned my comp on this morning I had 2 accounts, none of them were the admin account.
I dont understand wtf is wrong?!? I just have guest acces to my comp now :S

please, if someone knows any solution."
,no-jotsu,2008-06-07T16:17Z,"Hey, for those who got their computer ""stolen"", you just need to restart it in safe mode and make another admin account, then from that account you just erase the others. By doing this your coputer will be as new, but on your desktop ull have a file called the name of the users you just erased; with the folder will be all the shit you had installed on your computer. Hope this helps, I got my computer stolen too...

If this doesn't work then go and get a new computer..."
,tiki_pet,2008-07-08T18:02Z,"Like Melfett, I'm also having the same problem (2 guest accounts and no admin). Does anyone know a solution for this? 

@Melfett, did you ever resolve this problem?"
,honeymw009,2008-08-19T03:12Z,"This works Great......................the best ever Patch for windowsblinds....................
Thanks........................I ll seed this for a long time..................................."
,xenomorph1138,2009-04-28T19:02Z,"I've been wanting to check this out (WB) but with all the problems people are havin, (newsid running indefinatley, screwin up admin accounts) I think I'll pass on this one. But thx for sharin zz4spd."
,gsx-vi,2009-08-02T21:51Z,"hey so i have a HUGE problem with this, i downloaded and started NewSID.exe it has been on all night but in the morning it was done, BUT newsid deleted many files in my C:\ directory, in certain cases i lost entire programs, and THEN i discovered the WORST

NewSID made my account a guest account, and created a new admin account with a nick and a password i don't know, and cannot execute anymore programs as an administrator.my documents folder is locked, and PC doesn't let me restore original SID from my account, please i before i delete everything someone could help, maybe who made torrent knows the datas of this account
THANK YOU :D"
