,mictrmbl,2007-10-12T19:27Z,"Pelle_Kelle, this is not a virus. If you had half a brain, you'd know how to play the video."
,tk88,2007-10-20T05:34Z,"Movie Reviews: Set in a ""boarding school"" dorm room supposedly, the movie is about average but gets interrupted by camera flashes, and people moving around. Movie length is 14.45 minutes. The sound is ok but the mic picks up too much I think. Otherwise good action and good bodies. Overall its a good idea with a lot of potential which unfortunately is not explored fully. Bottom line is that the boys are young but without much cum. 

Video: 9 out of 10
Sound: 8 out of 10

Verdict: Worth the download and NO it is not a virus."
,SgtPsycho,2008-03-07T23:10Z,"Not bad.  Personally I thought it was a little boring -  seemed a tad scripted and lacked in variety.

Still, worth a butchers.  Thanks mictrmbl!"

This is the first, not the third as I mentioned in a previous comment... and has no seeds. But I'll try to download it all the same; afterall it has 4 other leechers, and I may get a little held from you...

Thanks again!
