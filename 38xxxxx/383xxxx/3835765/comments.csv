,tallviking,2007-10-10T06:01Z,No one seeding anymore ???
,larsno,2007-10-15T18:50Z,Tanks...working just fine...:-)
,x-trim,2007-10-15T20:10Z,"You need a dual layer and it works from when the RTI system became DVD instead of CD system.
Unpack with winrar and burn with Nero or something."
,TheroM,2007-10-16T21:06Z,"Thanks!, works perfect in XC90 -05"
,imbuda,2007-10-17T13:44Z,Does not work for me. Used nero to burn a Verbatim DL DVD. Tried a second time. System cannot read the disk...MY2002 S60...:(
,Nicolai123,2007-10-18T10:14Z,"I certainly hope it works. Will help with seeding these files if so.

Made image by Alcohol 120% program. If positive result I will tell you later this day."
,Nicolai123,2007-10-18T13:35Z,"Unfortunately no luck for me. DVD made with Verbatim DL - program Alcohol 120%. Gone through to 100% writing no errors.

MY2004 V70 - DVD cannot be read. Contact volvo if problem continues.

Im sorry to say this.  "
,Nicolai123,2007-10-20T11:37Z,"Maybe those that verify this copy working could tell us what their setup is. What program, which disc, and likewise what dvd drive in the pc.

I have read on a pcforum that they had consistent problems with backup of navi discs in 2005 and onwards.  "
,Nicolai123,2007-10-21T00:47Z,"Please. Very good information about how to make this disc work in a volvo V70 2004. 

I would be so greatful to you."
,Nicolai123,2007-10-22T09:38Z,DVD -R or DVD +R to use.
,Pelle83,2007-10-23T14:37Z,"X-trim, thnx 4 a gr8 UL!"
,Nicolai123,2007-10-23T15:24Z,"Please Pelle. Tell me how it works, in what car, with what setup which dvd. I have tried all. DVD -r DL  and DVD +R DL, with alcohol 120%, Nero, DVD DEcrypter with booktyp DVDROM; nothing works in my 2004 V70. I am stuck. "
,Nicolai123,2007-10-23T19:45Z,"I now think its the reader in my v70 that is the problem. Volvo mechanic told me that it needed an update. My system couldn't even detect a original rti disc from early 2006. 

Many of you others should contact volvo and try to get this dvd update."
,Kaupanger,2007-10-26T18:22Z,"Hello. Works great on my XC90 2006.
Opened the iso and burned it with Nero 7.10.1.0 on Verbatim 2,4x DVD+R DL on 2,4 speed.
DVD drive is: HL-DS-ST DVD-RW_GSA-H11N ATA Device, according to my pc.
It took some time for the system in the car to update but it worked great after that."
,imbuda,2007-10-26T19:01Z,Anyone know if this software is supposed to work on a MY2002 S60? It doesn't on mine....:(
,Nicolai123,2007-10-28T13:22Z,"Now I can tell you all that doesn'nt make this function that your rti reader in the backroom probably has to be changed. Volvo makes a swap at a price of 4-500 euro depending on where you are from.

I have no other thing to do in my volvo v70 my 2004, first registratet in 7.03. Unless we tried to update the reader in my car with newest software it cannot read newer dvd's than 2003 or 2004. Excellent job done by volvo. They really know what they are dealing with!

So to you with a non functional S60 from 2002, try to seek a new rti reader and it probably will work for you too with this download."
,miha007,2007-11-04T22:28Z,"The only problem is, that image for disc no.2 is damaged! Image no.1 & no.3 are ok.

Please, someone to upload new image for disc no. 2 !!!"
,Nicolai123,2007-11-05T23:28Z,"It is not correct that the image for disc 2 is damaged, it must be your download that is. I have seen and heard two of my discs being useful in two different cars. made from this image.

Thanks to x-trim for the upload."
,piraterr,2007-11-07T10:23Z,"My first burn failed with MagicISO 5.4(0251) full version.

I burned this with:
Lite-On DVDRW LH-201AH (replaced my original PC DVDR and can do DL disks of course. This is essential!)
Win XP Home Edition SP2
ImgBurn 2.3.2.0 with all default options set (or at least I don't remember changing any)
Verbatim 2.4x DVD+R DL with 1x write set (but it seemed to burn at auto)

Note I did not try to change the type of DVD-DL write type that is mentioned in some other forums.

I didn't try it with Nero, sorry, but ImgBurn is freeware. 

When inserted into the XC90 MY06 drive, it thinks about it for a while then brings up a 'Updating Software' message and a 10 part progress box. Shortly after it completes the 9th box, the system starts up. Subsequent use has the usual quick start.

So far I have not seen any major functional changes, but obviously hopefully the maps are newer.

Good Luck."
,bigdog1867,2007-11-08T00:30Z,"I downloaded the torrent on Sunday and burned the ISO to a Pengo DVD+R Dual Layer Disc and it failed due to my haste. I read miha007 comments and thought I might have had the same problem. I tried re-burning the torrent on another Pengo disc and all is good. I am driving a MY04 Volvo S60R - torrent is perfect! x-trim, you're awesome and thank you for the update..."
,pilkastaren,2007-11-14T06:23Z,Tack så hemskt mycket ligger även kamrorna med i denna?

,hu_pp,2007-11-28T16:50Z,Thanks working perfect in my volvo V70 - D5 .2005 mod .burned it with Nero and Intenso double layer disk (dvd+r) 
,imbuda,2007-11-28T17:07Z,Still will not work in my 2002 S60. Tried 5 Verbatim DVD+R DL disks with Nero and Imgburn. The contents LOOK exactly the same as 0648. Do I have to download DVD 1 also? Does this contain the software update?? HELP!!
,retepnosslin,2007-11-30T15:50Z,"""imbuda"" - No, the upgrade software is on all 3 disc's just insert the disc with the region u wants and the upgrade will begin automaticly!"

,wristel,2007-12-05T20:50Z,funkar inte på min v70R -03.... har även provat nån från 2006... men de står bara att den inte kan läsa skivan...
,Nicolai123,2007-12-12T13:09Z,"After having installed a new dvd reader in my volvo v70 MY 2004 all is ok with this disc. Even the people at volvo didn't believe their eyes when seing a copy disc functional.

Good job done X-trim. We hope for future updates.

,IceMan-80,2007-12-29T20:36Z,"Is this really 2007!? I have a S60 -04 and had the RTI 2003 before this one..
I have noticed a number of times that roads are not on the map on this one, but was there on the ""older"" map. And this is central Stockholm where there are alot of new roads.."
,jman1,2008-01-03T16:57Z,I agree whith Ice-Man about the map. Was driving Gävle to Stockholm in Sweden and the new extended road E4 was not included on the map and its older than 6 months
,sziszi,2008-02-14T19:50Z,"Vad är det för språk ( language) ??
Tack"
,fullclaret,2008-04-11T10:52Z,"I've tried all three d/l's here without success for my xc90 2003.  What I've now found is my dvd player has a different version to other 2003 models and will not play this rti.  Maybe the same problem Nicolai123 had?  My dealership have given me the right product number so 2003 disc=30657541 needs 30732908(2007), or 31260747 (2008).  Most I've seen are: 30732909 and will not work with this player type."
