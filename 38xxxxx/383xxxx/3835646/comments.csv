[V],velvetfog,2007-10-09T19:01Z,"When are you going to start seeding this?
I have been connected to the tracker for the past 15 minutes, and there is nothing there yet.

Always start seeding a new torrent BEFORE you post it."
[V],velvetfog,2007-10-09T20:48Z,"It is seeding now, but very slowly.
Availability sits at 0.181
Time to complete is shown as 20 days."
[V],velvetfog,2007-10-09T20:57Z,"Using such a large major block size (1 MB) when you create a .TORRENT file, is not such a good idea. It makes the replication within the swarm very inefficient. You'll get much better results if you use a smaller block size of 256 KB or 512 KB."
[T],upsdave,2007-10-09T21:21Z,"an How do I make a smaller block, I am new to this uploading. Thanks for your input."
[T],upsdave,2007-10-09T21:30Z,"velvetfog, I did some checking, and I had auto detect, so on my next upload I will change it. Again thanks for the help"
