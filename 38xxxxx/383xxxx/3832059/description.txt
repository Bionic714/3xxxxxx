This is rip from UNCUT "Arthur et les Minimoys" DVD (probably R2 French or British release, I'm not sure), containing both French and English tracks. BTW, fuck Harvey Weinstein up his ass for mutilating just another fine european movie.

Main movie:
Video: 720x384 x264 ~1500 kbps
Audio: both AAC 5.1 ~230 kbps
Subtitles: external English and French

Bonus:
Video: H264 ~800 kbps
Audio: AAC 2.0 ~100 kbps
Subtitles: N/A

It's a pity I couldn't find English subs for "Making of" and "Interview with Arthur" bonus videos, which are both in French. If anybody could provide me with English or Russian subs for this featurettes, I'll be very grateful.

P.S. Enjoy Mylene Farmer as Selenia in French version.
