,nickll9009,2007-10-07T04:24Z,When this gets downloaded please tell me if it works via a comment i will test it tommorrow so if anyone downloads it before hand
,nickll9009,2007-10-08T17:02Z,"Sorry but for sum reason it doesnt work
i think it might either be   a corrupted iso file

or my computer doesnt allow to boot from an iPod

please sum1 try this with a different iso file u can still use winimage just follow my directions for the different iso file "
