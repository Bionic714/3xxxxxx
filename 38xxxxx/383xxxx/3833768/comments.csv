,yammymyyammy,2007-10-10T16:31Z,To inform all of the quality....the entire movie is not shot with the entire picture viewable. The intro starts on an angle and then is straightened out...however the subs are in french for those of you don't speak it..and the subs are for arabic translations...there are some issues that needed to be brought up...so there they are...free movies equals....your standard cam probs...
