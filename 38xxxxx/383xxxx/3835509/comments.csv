,honestkyle,2008-06-03T18:07Z,This torrent works perfectly.  Follow Donleavy's steps and the information in the .nfo file and it's good to go.
,vixen-of-alcatraz,2008-08-21T14:33Z,"What a pain in the rear! Can't even extract this!!
Why do people winrar stuff multiple times? It becomes a right old mess! I'd rather have it an extra 10mb in size & avoid the crazy amounts of compression."
,vixen-of-alcatraz,2008-08-21T14:34Z,"Thanks to Donleavy.
The instructions help alot!! :-)"
,jimmay,2009-02-23T16:04Z,"Hey Antje14, thanks for sharing this, I really appreciate it!  :D"
,jimmay,2009-02-25T11:06Z,"It installed and worked perfectly. Only thing was that there was no vst files so I could only use it stand-alone (not as a vst)

but I corrected that (like fety said) by just going on izotope's website and getting the update.


man iZotope makes some serious software"
,gringopig,2009-06-17T20:55Z,"Thanks but have you SEEN the number of extremely dodgy trackers associated with this folks!

JEBUS.

Delete all trackers but for Demonoid and PB...

(if you know what's good for you.)"
,verses420,2009-11-29T02:37Z,"gee this should be re-packed one more time, you know"
