Release Notes 
Tantrumm Records presents the debut
psychedelic trance album of Stefanos
Gkogkakos known as Stranger 'Aggressive
Manners'. After releasing a lot of tracks at
some of the most respected labels the time
was right to present a full length 'Stranger'
album. This album is written under the
inspiration of travelling around the world in
places like India, Russia, Germany,
F.Y.R.O.M, Hungary and parties in heavenly
Greek landscapes like Mount Olympus (yes this
is the one that the 12 ancient gods used to
live on), mountains of Drama (waterfalls from
paradise just on earth) also amazing beaches
where forest meets the sea plus personal
experiences, problems and little things that
happened during this period in everyday life.
Freedom is the meaning behind 'Aggressive
Manners' and should be retained in any way!
Musically this recording contains an intro
plus 10 previously unreleased tracks,
carefully chosen, filled with huge, phat and
rolling basslines, clean kicks, electric
leads, psychedelic and twisted samples,
analog style modulation fx, haunted and
emotional atmospheres plus rhythms that will
make u dance from your heart.
The bpm range is 148-156 of strong
mind-bending psychedelic music that moves
from serious to funny, sad to happy and mad
to groovy.
