Hey, do you have the set list for the Saturday show that Nickelback opened up for BJ at Giants Stadium (7/29/06, I believe). They played a beautiful ballad and I don't know the name of it. No, it wasn't ""Far Away.""
Thanks!"
,matav,2008-05-27T19:13Z,"This torrent is good but kinda sux!
All tracks maybe 320kbps & of good quality but the sound has been normalized.
I have to increase the volume to listen to these tracks! kinda sad.
thanx! but nywys, i think i'll find another source and redownload
.
PS: I am currently seeding it & if i had good upload speed i would have uploaded my own torrents."
