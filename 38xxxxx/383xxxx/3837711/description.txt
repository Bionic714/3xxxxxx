Shaun Micallef's new series, Newstopia, was pitched to SBS as a news satire. Beyond that and with the first episode still taking shape, Micallef finds it easier to say what it isn't about than what it is.

"I don't want to do what's been done by others," he says, "and pranks and stunts aren't what I do. But at the same time, I don't want to use the news as a punchline to an already existing joke. In a way, Newstopia is more about humour than it is about comedy, and by that I mean comedy is the machine and humour is the content. This will be less about joke devices and more reliant on something that is real and true."

Micallef concedes the success of The Chaser's War on Everything has opened the usually narrow minds of programmers to comedy and has them looking for their own spin on the concept. Newstopia invites immediate comparison with the US satire The Daily Show, hosted by Jon Stewart, and The Chaser. "I wouldn't be embarrassed by someone saying it's like Jon Stewart's show, and it's more like Jon Stewart's show than it is The Chaser," Micallef says.
