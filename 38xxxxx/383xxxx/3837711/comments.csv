good to see more encodes being 50/60fps instead of just cutting the frame rate in half to 25/30 like so many do"
,national,2007-11-06T08:02Z,"This won't play properly on my PC. I notice the processor operating at up to 94% when this is playing. There is no problem playing the 234MB episodes or the 100hrs of other videos I have downloaded. The only other time this happened was on a HD version of the TopGear Polar special. My PC is an AMD 1.6GHz with 64MB video card. 
This is just info that may help some people - not a criticism of derrida's good work."
