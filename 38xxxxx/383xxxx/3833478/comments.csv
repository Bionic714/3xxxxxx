Also - LOL at 12 year old n00bs who can't get it to work so say its fake! Hahaha. "
,gubbins,2008-01-28T05:41Z,"You can forget playing this on anything less than 2.5ghz p4 or equivalent and a 6600GT 128mb.

Even then it would need turning to low quality settings and stutter like a bitch outdoors. 

Recommended spec for smooth 30 fps outside is Ati HD3870 512mb or NV equivalent and a 3ghz processor. 

Dual core is pointless since the game doesn't employ threading on the PC build. Despite what you read and despite you setting all the little options in the .ini to 1. The binaries were compliled sans threads. So your quad core, super pumped 5k processor is redundant. 

Just a heads up if your multi core rig hasn't got at least 2.5ghz puff."

,marashtua,2008-01-29T16:12Z,"Hi. Ive just started using torrents and i just got this 1 downloaded. So the question is.. What must i unrar to be able to mount it with daemon.. The daemon thing is not hard, but what must i unrar? What file? Help would be much appreciated. =) I know you all guys get in your nerves with noobs, as me, but i really would like some help! Thanks!"
,Enyap,2008-01-29T17:30Z,unrar all of them from 1 to 88. Just select them all at once right click and unrar.
,marashtua,2008-01-29T17:49Z,okay but what do i mount with daemon now then?
,Silentnc,2008-01-30T10:14Z,please seed this file everyone that has it!!! 3kbs or under is ridiculous
,Enyap,2008-01-30T23:02Z,"okay but what do i mount with daemon now then?
----------------------------------------------------------
the thing you just unrared - iso file"
,Iseed4ever,2008-01-31T23:32Z,Do you need a key to install this game? 
,Naruto-replican,2008-02-01T09:12Z,"Now, for one last time, i think i actually think im gona be a nice guy and tell ALL THE BIGASS NOOOOOOBS here how to instal and play a downloaded game.

1. If the game is splitted into many rared files, like this one, you just have to unpack them with a program called ""winrar"". If you dont have it, you can just google it, you will find a mirror very fast.
When you have unpacked all the files (this can take a while!) they most often creats a big file, which is the game itself. 

2. So, now you have the game. Now will I come to the part many people dont understand, but which is very simpel.
First of all, you need a program called ""daemon tools"". Just google it.
This program tells the computer that it is a cd in the cd dvice, when it actually isn't. 
So, the next part is to trick the computer the oblivion disc (or the disc for another game) actually is in the cd devise. When you have downloaded and installed daemontools, you will see its symbol an the activity field, in the computers right downer corner. Rightclick that symbol>emulotion>all options on
Then: rightclick>virtual cd/dvd rom>device ?: [?] No media>mount image.
Now find the game file which was created when you unpacked all the .rar files. Doubble click the file. The instalation window will pop up!

3.Now, all you have to do is to install the game. If you need a cd-key, and its not included in the downloaded torrent, you have to find one on the internet. I think there are several keycode paccages on this site. But look out, this ones often contains viruses, so allways scan them with an anti-virus program (""avg"" is the best free one you can get, just google it if you dont already have an anti-virus program) before you opens the file they are in. 
So, if the keycode worked, you will have the game installed now! :D:D:D:D:D:D (lol)

4. Now to the crack part! 
You have to crack the game, else the computer will understand you dont actually have the cd, and you cant start the game.
How to crack the game: 
Often the crack is included in the torrent you downloaded (the crack always have the games logo as icon) . If its not included, this is a very good page to find cracks on: http://www.gamecopyworld.com/
(just click on one of the mirrors, depending in whick part of the world you are, u.s.a or europe.)
Find the crack in the downloaded file. Now you have to put it into the gamefile. Do like this: C:>programs>and find the game file here. Go into it. 
The games own ""crack"" often lies in the first window in the file. It use to have exactly the same name as your downloaded crack, and its always have the games logo as icon. 
Now, copy your crack, and put it in the games file. A sign should pop up. It should say that ""this file already exists"" or something like that. Press yes. Now you have changed the games ""crack"" to your own.

5. So, if you have done everything right now, you should be ready:)  Try launch the game. If it doesent work, you have done something wrong, or u r a big n00b!

6. Have a nice time playing:D  
Plz exuse my english, im from sweden, and my english isnt perfect:P"
,thenoob88888,2008-02-01T17:03Z,"I'm very sorry all but I am a super noob and I need some help, my question is under winrar is extracting the files the sames as unraring them.  Can someone plz reply to the comment."

Reply: william.. u can't get around it.. u need to either buy 1 more HD and make it NTFS, or format ur HD with NTFS."
,moon-fish,2008-03-23T12:29Z,"william9366

no need to format if you have the free space. 
1. Scan disk and defrag your drive
2. Start>Run>cmd then type
3. C:\> CONVERT  C:  /fs:ntfs

your drive is converted to NTFS. but you cant go back to FAT32 without a format of third party software.

,kraxz,2008-04-19T00:24Z,"@whonderwhy
First you need to open the rld-tes4.rar with WinRar, it will extract a .iso file. This one you can either use to burn on a DVD (not sure how since I never do) or use Deamon Tools to mount and make your computer think its a DVD. To do this open Deamon Tools, right click its little icon down by the clock and chose Virtual CD/DVD -> The device -> Mount image.. Then just install and run the game :)
You can find both WinRar and Deamon Tools here on TPB.

You guys getting errors I have no idea whats wrong.. Works good for me, try reinstall? Or your computer isnt good enough for it? Sometimes it crashes when I exit the game, but that doesnt matter much heh..

And yeah the NUDE patch makes the females NUDE ;D Figures...

Lots of other nice mods for this game.. I found some good lists and other info here:

then install the shit and now WOW u have winrar excellent! then second u need a kind of program that mounts the game to the pc also i recommend Alcohol 120% ( not gay daemon tools .. ) > http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4056783/ALCOHOL_120_1.9.7.Build_6221(NEW-UPDATED_Build)
so excellent again! u now have a program that mounts fucking games n shit .. now you finish by downloading the damn game and when its done u extract it by opening it and top of the window wich will pop up it will be a icon wich looks like a map and has the name '' Extract '' also press that and then u chose in what map u want those files ..then u let it extract .. takes time dont be such dickhead just wait ( lol xD ) then when its done u will have to open alcohol 120% and then in there press options and somehow um try to find there were u can make kind of CD-RW fuckever u call them .. it will kind of like detect the game just as when u stop a cd in thru that thing whatever its called in comp and it will read the game (sry i cant now explain this shit but my alcohol trial period has expired out of the fucking old version so try to figure out how to do that ) and now search for that FILE ur gonna mount ( um imostly think its a ISO file or something .. havnt yet downloaded the game but whatever .. ) then after uve mounted it open the installer of the game and install the game and then now u can play FOR SURE and i mother fucking hell hope that this lil shited off guide helps you outta lol -.-...

,gunshy20,2008-04-22T05:57Z,"hey just want to ask if this game needs a crack to run or just mount to daemon and play?

looking forward to download this game."
,centime,2008-04-23T06:02Z,"gunshy20, just mount to daemon and play.  There isn't a crack.

For anyone who get the error message ""Oblivion has encountered an error and needs to close..."" make sure you meet the minimum requirements to play Oblivion on your pc, especially your video card.

sp3tan, nice of you to do an instructional, but the syntax is just a bit confusing :)"
,centime,2008-04-23T06:29Z,"JUST A BIT OF ADVICE:   If you have a problem - don't understand what to do with the files, how to install, get an error message when starting the game - read through the comments.  This stuff has been gone over many times.

There is a very nicely worded instructional on page 3 of these comments.  Take your time.

If you do everything right and still get an error and crash when you start the game, your system - especially your video card - isn't mighty enough to run it.  Upgrade to play the game.

I realize people are new, but read the comments (and ignore the assholes who scoff at you because you are new to all this; they were new once too).  You will probably find the answer to your question.

And to you ""experienced"" downloaders - BE NICE!  Like I said, you were new once, too.  The files as they come in this download can look pretty confusing to someone who has never seen them.  If you don't have anything helpful to add, you don't really need to post a comment just to be a dick, do you?

By the way, M3st3rD4t, thanks for the torrent.  It works fine.  People just need to be a bit more patient and READ THE ADVICE ALREADY GIVEN."
,centime,2008-04-23T23:41Z,"One more comment, then I will go away :)

The file you need to mount in daemon is the .mdf file in disc1 and in disc2.  Follow the generously written instructions by Naruto-replican on page 3 and you should have no problem.

Most often it IS an .iso file that you mount, but for this Oblivion download, it is the .mdf file.

Sorry, sp3tan; it was good of you, too, to put up instructions, but they are a bit confusing to follow when you read them as though you were a n00b (which we ALL were at one point :)"

Why? Because so long as you have it mounted you can play it. No fucking point in having a cracked file when you can just keep it MOUNTED."
,centime,2008-04-26T03:48Z,"CONFUSED?  LOOK ON PAGE 3 OF THESE COMMENTS FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON INSTALLING THIS DOWNLOAD BY NARUTO-REPLICAN.  He was very good to put them up for all new people.

Revial, people who may have a problem running the game from the mounted file because of secuROM, etc. can benefit from using the cracked exe instead.  So both modalities have a purpose.

Oh, and you N00BS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS...  I know you are new, but READ THESE COMMENTS before asking a question that has already been addressed, and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON PAGE 3.

People get frustrated with n00bs not so much because you are new, but because you ask questions that have been asked and answered thousands of times before, and which could be answered by READING THE COMMENTS or doing a little investigating/trying other things before posting your question.  Take your time.

Checked official forums and it's because of a no-cd crack... I was wondering if there was a way to counter this with this particular torrent. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
,SyzygyWolf,2008-04-26T18:25Z,"Oh, and I should mention, I didn't download one on my own, simply downloaded the torrent and installed it, nothing else."
,Naruto_fan,2008-04-26T21:09Z,"All right, since im tired of all these that cant read a installing tutorial or simply dont understand how to control a mouse and keyboard, I will write an as detailed tutorial possible, this will work for other games to:

When downloaded a game torrent, the torrent are usually in .rar files, but are not called .rar but .r01 .r02 etc. If you dont already have the Winrar program go to http://rarlab.com/download.htm 
and select a mirror, if you use Windows as OS, you should pick the 1 highest up called ""WinRAR 3.71"", when you read this tutorial, the version may be higher, but I hope you get the idea.

Start up winrar, usually when you have downloaded winrar for free it will come a sign in the winrar window that says ""Please purchase Winrar license"", just press Close or the x in the upper right corner and find the directory with all the winrar files.

Now you should see many files named with .r and then numbers, like r.01, r02 etc. just doubleclick one of them and press extract files.
Winrar will automaticly find all the rar files needed for extraction, but sometimes it could say things like "".r03 is corrupted"" or something like that, just go to where u downloaded your torrent and when you open the torrent in your torrent program you can see all the files that are in it and witch ones you want to download.

Uncheck all except the file that is corrupted or gets an error and download that file then put that file into where all the other .r files are and try to extract again, do this until every file gets extracted without problem.
Now from the extracted files you should have an so called IMAGE file, often it is .IMG or .ISO but there are many versions, if the files are .ISO I suggest that you use the MagicISO program.

Can be downloaded here: http://www.shareup.com/MagicISO-download-4176.html

Or just google it, if its another IMAGE file like .IMG I suggest you use Daemon tools, just google it.
Try to find the button that allows you to select the IMAGE file that you want to extract.
It takes alot of time I guess (depending on your computers speed). If you are worried that your computer can't play the game, just search on google for ""gamenamehere requirements"" and you should find all requirements and see if your computer have them or better.
When the IMAGE file is extracted find the directory of the extracted files, now often there are maps and files, often 1 map called CRACK and leave that for later, try to find the .exe setup file, often named the game name or the game name in shortened version, like WORLD OF WARCRAFT.exe or WOW.exe.

Install using the setup.
It should be installed on your C: disks program files or programs, find the game and try to start it. If the program says you need a disk, just go back to the setup directory and copy the file inside the CRACK map and put it in the map that the game is in. 
Now find the directory with the file with exact the same name as the crack and paste the crack into that directory, you shall now get a warning that says that you crack will overwrite your original path, just click ok and the crack will overwrite it. Start the crack and now it should work.

You can also for an easier way brun the IMAGE file with Nero, IMGburn or another burning program.

If there are any things with your game thats not in this tutorial I suggest a website called http://www.google.com and search for it.

You didn't catch that maybe? well I will help you noobs that are so lazy that can't even open a new internet and go to the site, it's called
WWW."

Nothing of the sort is found within this torrent.  It should install without any problem.  You probably got it from another game and it is now within your registry.  Here are some common file names for that shit:
CMS16.DLL 
CMS_95.DLL 
CMS_NT.DLL
Do a search within your computer or check out My Computer/C:/Windows/System 32 to view .dll's in your registry.  I've never encountered that crap before so good luck - no clue what will happen if you delete them.  Just tryin' to help.

""CRC error: The file C:/Program Files/Bethesda Softworks/Oblivion/Data/Oblivion.esm doesn't math the file in the setup's .cab file. The medium from which you are running the setup may be corrupted;contact your software vendor.""

Would anyone know what I did wrong to receive this message? "
,chimpakawanzelu,2008-05-08T04:05Z,"elfboi9-

Hmmm...  Not sure what that might be, but you could recheck the torrent.  For example: in Azureus right-click on the Oblivion torrent in the Seeding column and click Force Re-Check.  A small peice of the torrent may have been dropped and thus it doesn't match what should be there.  It happens sometimes.  Good luck and cheers!!"
,chimpakawanzelu,2008-05-08T04:08Z,Oh yeah...  If the torrent is fine then I would delete/uninstall Oblivion and then Extract it again with WinRar and install it again.  A small peice could have been dropped during extraction.  That happens sometimes too.  Cheers!

This torrent is named: The.Elder.Scrolls.IV.Oblivion-RELOADED once it starts dl-ing to your computer.  Thus, you should have a folder in your computer somewhere with this title.  For example, all of my torrents end up in a folder called Azureus Downloads, but only you know where you save your torrents.  In this Elder.Scrolls folder there will be:
-a ""Nude Patch"" folder
-an ""Original Exe"" folder
-a ""reloaded"" system information file
-and about 30 winrar files (entitled: rld-tes4) with about 58 winrar R30 files (entitled: rld-tes4.r30 up to rld-tes4.r88)

As mentioned in my installation tips (pg10), open The.Elder.Scrolls...  folder (you should see all of the above mentioned folders and winrar files), then right click on the first rld-tes4 file to begin the extraction process.  Follow my instructions to the T and it should install properly.  It sounds like you are at #6 in my tips.  Good luck!
Cheers!!"

If you accidentally delete the ISO file you can always find a NO-CD patch/crack and run Oblivion that way. Of course if you want to wait the good while it takes to re-download thats up to you."
,TheDarkLight,2008-05-26T17:27Z,"@wickeditsme 

Large amount of seeding doesn't equal fast speed. The speed is effected by both your connection speed as well as the file(s)'s source. eg. If you have a broadband connection and the source has a dial-up connection. You will recieve the file at the dial-up speed. torrents are not exluded from this."

,Puny Human,2008-05-28T08:14Z,"nishanth4554 there's probably not a lot you can do without making a major change.  If you are seeing that error it means that your hard disk is formatted in the old FAT 32 (32 bit file allocation table). A file over 4 GB in size cannot under any circumstances be written to that format.

So what you need to do is either convert your current HD to NTFS (NT file system) and if you do that be aware that you can never go back to FAT32.  Or you can get a new hard drive and format it to ntfs when you install it. 

 I assume you are already running at  XP and not win98."

I am sure it works. the problem is i do not know how to do it. i downloaded it then i unRARed all those rld-tes4 things. it sent it to a file with more RAR files. i extracted all those then burned all the files to a disk using Roxio. then i installed it with no problems but when i start it up it says there was an error and it needs to close
I NEED SOMEONES HELP
if you have any tips send them to cocoman_47@yahoo.com"

,OblivionGamer49,2008-06-16T01:31Z,haven't finished downloading still but I have question and I am new to this. After you put your image file into daemon tools and it shows up on the cd-rom  thing do you have to take it out of daemon tools to put in a disk in your drive or do you just leave it alone. If nobody answers I don't care I will just figure it out on my own just don't want to mess anything up.Thanks.
,OblivionGamer49,2008-06-16T03:22Z,My Share Ratio is 2.897 and I have not even finished downloading yet it is going to be done at about 2 in the morning if people continue to seed.

,OblivionGamer49,2008-06-17T00:54Z,Anyone that can answer. can you delete the Oblivion-RELOADED Folder after you install the game and do you have to mount the image to the virtual drive every time you start your computer
,OblivionGamer49,2008-06-17T04:53Z,You guys know alot I have a ques. If I dl Shivering Isles what steps would I go through to have it in this Oblivion Torrent.  I have not downloaded it yet so I don't really care if anyone answers.

,aj2292,2008-06-17T19:50Z,"To OblivionGamer49: All you have to do when you download Shivering Isles is mount it or burn it, whichever you prefer, and install it.  You have to have Oblivion already installed on your computer for it to work, but its that simple.  This seems like a good download for Shivering Isles http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3649002/The.Elder.Scrolls.IV.Oblivion.The.Shivering.Isles.PROPER-RELOADE

As for this file, I've yet to finish it because I've been downloading at an average of 8kb/s and uploading at 14kb/s xD.  So yea I'm waiting patiently for this to finish.  Then I might try my luck with the Shivering Isles expansion.  Hopefully that won't take days like this one to download haha"

Are you supposed to extract ALL the ""rld.tes4"" files to one folder before you start mounting/installing?"
,Kapteinhansssa,2008-06-20T03:14Z,"Ok here's when it stops for me.

- I've DLd the torrent
- I've extracted the first ""rld.tes4"" file to a folder on my desktop.
- Inside that folder I then get a new rar file that I extract to the very same folder.
- Then I end up with 9 .rar files called ""data1-8"" + a file called ""engine32"".

- Here's the problem. I an NOT able to extract htese files further because I get the ""... unknown format or damaged"" message.

I have no idea what to do since I can't find the .iso file (suppose it's somewhere inside the ""data1.8"" folders.

,Beonaam,2008-06-23T22:35Z,"@Kapteinhansssa
After you extract the first rar, you're not supposed to extract the next one you get. While that type of file is compatible with WinRar, it's actually an ISO file. Use a mounting program such as Daemon (google it) to mount the ISO and install the game from there."

Since the game requires you to have the cd you don't necessarily have to have the cd to play the damn game!! Go to google and look up ""gamecopyworld.com"" or ""gameburnworld.com"" and look for the ""NO-CD/NO-DVD"" Patch/Crack to play the game without the fucking game!!

If you're sitting around questioning, ""How do I unrar..?"" ""How do I mount?"" ""What is it that I mount?"" ""How do I shot web?"" The best thing to do is usually READ! Believe it or not! Read comments posted prior to that of your own. 
If you read these things alot of people actually take some time to explain it, read it slow, and sink it in. If there aren't any comments that are posted then look for a similar torrent, preferably one with a substantial amount of seeders... >.> Hopefully you would've headed there first but who knows... On a final note, people here often try their best, and a language barrier can be met.. so give people time to either respond or come to reaction with said actions...

if your using Utorrent then right click said torrent and fore re-check.

That sounds Driver related, check for new drivers.
Also you might want to scale back all the graphics options in autoplay menu.

or google Can You RUN It, to see if you meet minimum requirements.

3. extract all the files into a new one
(this may take up to 10 mins)

4 once the extraction is complete (or during) look up magic disc on google.

5. right click the magic disc icon on the bottom right bar go to the ""Virtual CD/DVD-ROM"" mount the file from the folder you just extracted.

6. you should be installing it now.

7. once the download is complete enjoy. :)

i kept getting the oblivion has encountered an error and has stopped running with the little black box in the top left corner if your having this problem as well 
when you installed oblivion and it said detecting your video card 
if it came up with a message saying something like video card unrecognized video settings set to medium then forget about it you need a new video card to run this game dont bother downloading cracks or anything else to try and get it to work unless by some miracle you have found a way to download a new video card (Physically impossible by the way =])
there i have solved the mystery now go and buy a better video card if you want to play this game 

if you are looking for cheap prices on vid cards i suggest you look at frys electronics if it is available to you fuck best buy and there overpriced everything, you can also look for a store that sells used computer parts in your area most of them check the parts the sell before they sell them 
do some research and find out the best price using the magic of the world wide web
if you still have problems after you do all that
READ THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS on page 3 there is a really nice guy who helps fix most problems not related to video card

STOP USING VISTA!!!!!!

I'll never use Vista or its successors until DX9 is obsolete. Until then, I'm happy with my XP Pro :)
If you need any other argument, just look at the system requirements for ANYTHING under XP compared to Vista. Most cases, Vista requires half again what XP needs, if not twice or more.
Also, never buy PC's from a manufacturer, you're always better off building your own. You get exactly what you want, with no bloat/crapware pre-installed, and you get to install your own OS instead of having to have Vista because 90% of manufacturers are under contract to MS for Vista only.

This will startle the computer into loading the rar as an iso and you can install as normal. YOu'll have to do this for EACH RAR FILE!

Hey there, Seeding is letting your file sit in your BitClient after downloading is completed for a while...

And yes, go to this site-
http://www.elderscrolls.filefront.com/
In there are most of the GREAT mods for Oblivion and Morrowind, and they all have detailed install instructios, and you can get a good no/CD patch...

Good Luck...!"

I would like a bit more seeders tho.

Im not complaining but im averaging about 30kb/s, if everyone was seeding at least 1kb to me, that would get me up to about 80kb/s.

That would then get this done in about a day!

Anyway THANKS!"

To everyone who is starting the game only to have it crash back to your desktop: The problem is more than most likely that your computer does not meet the minimum system requirements for Oblivion.

2. i winrar'ed 1-89? from the download
3. (i didnt mount any cd image because i couldnt find one) i clicked on the launch button and installed it
4. i tried to run it, but its asking for a cd.
i have experience with cd images and with daemon tools. but am i missing something?

i already deleted the original torrent data so i may have to redownload it if i messed something up.

any help would be appreciated"

1. download the torrent
2. UNzip rld-test.rar (it will unzip to an iso. file so you can mount it to Daemon tools)
3. Then mount the iso. file you just UNzip then install.
4. move the patchs over to the oblivion files

,Zryo,2009-06-11T06:55Z,"@ magnie: Beware this is long winded as this is often a huge problem for anyone trying to play oblivion pirated or legitimate so it's likely not a problem with this particular torrent file. I will try and be as thorough as possible so maybe this will also help anyone else having the problem where oblivion crashes after limited and/or extended game play.

First read this and be sure your machine meets Oblivion's system requirements. http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:System_Requirements

If you are sure you meet the minimum system requirements then you should try steps 1 and 2 next. This is assuming you have successfully installed the game and are experiencing instability and reduced fps during gameplay.

Step 1: Patch the game up to Version 1.2.0416. 
http://www.elderscrolls.com/downloads/updates_patches.htm

On the page for patch downloads it should be the sixth from the top ""OBLIVION PATCH v1.2.0416."" Just scroll past the shivering isles patches unless you have the official shivering isles expansion installed, in that case you should install the most recent shivering isles patch ""SHIVERING ISLES PATCH v1.2.0416"" from the list of several different languages. 

Once the installation is complete and you have patched your copy up to version 1.2.0416, follow any dialogue and close any open windows then move to step 2.

Step 2: Update your audio drivers because this can cause a sudden crash to the desktop. If you already know how to update your audio driver then skip to step 3. 
Before you install the NEW audio driver update do a full uninstall of your current audio driver in the control panel. If you are running windows xp (sorry I don't know vista yet) you can locate your audio driver manufacturer by going to: control panel -> system -> hardware -> device manager -> sound, video, and game controllers

In my case it's ""C-Media AC97 Audio Device."" You will see some codec and other devices but it shouldn't take you long to locate the audio driver's manufacturer. From there a google search should take you to the manufacturer's home page where you can access your audio driver's updates.

Step 3: If you are 100% sure you have the most up to date drivers for your video card skip to step 4. Before you install the NEW video driver update do a full uninstall of your current video driver in the control panel. Again you can locate your video driver's manufacturer by going to: control panel -> system -> hardware -> device manager -> and now DISPLAY ADAPTERS

In my case it's Radeon X1650 Series (lol I know it's old but it works). So now just follow the same steps as you did to update your audio drivers by locating your manufacturer's website.

Step 4: Let's recap to be sure you have successfully completed the above task.
a. You have now updated to Oblivion Version 1.2.0416 or SHIVERING ISLES PATCH v1.2.0416 if you have that expansion installed.
b. You removed your current audio driver then you updated your audio drivers.
c. You removed your current video driver then You updated your video drivers.

Now launch your game and see if you notice any difference. If you are no longer experiencing crashes then you are done! If not then skip to step 5.

Step 5: If you still experience the crashes try to disable the audio.

Step 6: If you still experience the crashes after attempting a play with audio disable try to set the graphics down to bare minimum.

Step 7: If the game is still crashing you can now try some possible unofficial mods that can also increase system performance. 
You should register an account at tesnexus.com if you wish to try out any of the mods below I am linking to and be prepared to really read before you install unofficial mods from any place into any game. Be sure to read the readme Files associated with each mod paying special attention to: Installation Instructions, Release Notes, Known Conflicts/bugs, and the Requirements section of the readme. You may also want to back up your stock game files by copying the folder ""Data"" in your installation directory and placing somewhere secure on your hard driv"
,Zryo,2009-06-12T06:04Z,"Tichothewolf: It's a lot more fun when you mod it to the max. You can pretty much make the game play how ever you want it to. You can design your own cities, people, weapons, even quest lines. If you are running a nice system then the game actually has some pretty descent graphics."

,D4ng3rD,2009-06-14T18:38Z,"Installing this game is simple, these are the steps i used
Step 1. use WinRAR to extract the first file under the reloaded NFO file. it will take some time and will extract all the files, 1-88
Step 2.Mount with DaemonTools. After you are done extracting(recommended that you make a folder for it), go to where you extracted it and mount it.
Step 3.Install the game
Step 4. Have Fun."

,EnigmaticSoldier,2009-06-28T20:11Z,"Download was speedy and great. Left the house, when I came back it was done. I'm seeding currently. Anyways.

I found all the rar'd files, figured out how to get at the ISO, and when I extracted it, DAEMON Tools Lite said there was an ""error in the command line,"" so I couldn't mount it. I tried mounting it with UltraISO instead, which let me extract it, and so I did. It all extracted nicely into one big folder, and it ran setup and installed, but now it's asking for a CD.

Shame on you guys for not giving a fuck about your community, and going out of your way to slow down people's download rates.

Thank fucking god for me having a 10mb/s dl speed here at my university (im pulling 80 kb/s at least), but you guys should thank me that even though you guys are intentionally fucking everyone over, I'll still provide you guys with 200 kb/s upload.

,ab0m8,2009-06-29T20:06Z,"@ LightRebellion

You should just use daemon tools.  Burning to a dvd will just waste a precious dvd and take up one of your drives while playing.  With an ISO mounter you can have a free drive while playing, and you can still use the included skins (one of your concerns).  Just email me at my alternate email if you need help > query10101@live.com

I'd be more than glad to help, that's what I do."
,spitinsk8er,2009-07-06T04:20Z,"To all those who are looking for the ISO file, you won't find it.
Extract the last rld-tes4 in your
\The.Elder.Scrolls.IV.Oblivion-RELOADED folder to the same folder.

You should know have a folder named rld-tes4.

Go into that folder and the one file should be a winrar achive. That is what you mount after you install using the .exe. Hope that helps."

,AlexH25,2009-07-23T13:58Z,"reine.here, you should need to unrar it. The files usually have the extensions .001, .002, .003 or .r01, .r02, .r03 etc rather than .rar (some of the files may not neccessarily have an extension for some reason.)

Anyway, you just need to right click on the first file (rld-tes4) and click 'extract to rld-tes4\' and after prompting you to extract them all, it should just extract them all to a folder named 'rld-tes4'"

,Reimonenq,2009-07-24T23:13Z,"I HAVE A PROBLEM --- Assuming the following is the correct procedure to execute the successful installation of the game, I'll point out why it doesn't work for me.

Step 1. use WinRAR to extract the first file under the reloaded NFO file. it will take some time and will extract all the files, 1-88
Step 2.Mount with DaemonTools. After you are done extracting(recommended that you make a folder for it), go to where you extracted it and mount it.
Step 3.Install the game
Step 4. Have Fun. 

During step 1, when I extracted the first file under the NFO file, it didn't extract all files 1-88... Why is this? And how can I do it manually to get this game up and running? I've been waiting in almost unbearable anticipation to play this game ever since I started downloading it yesterday, and now I've run into this problem. Any help is greatly appreciated."

To mount in Daemon Tools, double click daemon tools, and then right click the daemon tools green icon in the task bar.
Then click virtual CD/DVD-ROM. Hover over it and click the drive you want to mount to, and then direct to where the disk is. Then you're done."

im not really new to downloading games, I've just never downloaded one in multiple rar's before. I usually go for the straight up ISO.

I only have one question that I didn't see anyone ask and im not sure why.


When im unrar'ing the stuff, so I just extract one of the rars or all of them because if I try to do all of them it takes like 7 hours and each file tries to replace the last because it's only one file, the same file in all the rar's. do I hit yes to all or do i only extract one.

please to be assisting."
,Mqas,2009-12-09T22:39Z,"ericplayzbass
OK i hope you have got control of everything by now.
Just extract this file (rld-tes4.r00) and everything will be done. NO need to extract all of them.
and by the way when you have multiple rar files
you have to extract just one which can be any file first or last it does not matter but i always go for the first one.Any problem post it."

1) rename file extension to .rar
2) unpack into a folder
3) launch game using oblivion.exe

I bought this game several years ago and played it through, and I've played this rip for about 6-9 hours now, there are still a few glitches that I found which I came across on my original version as well, for instance, back in the prison on an assassination mission, there are a few black out spots, and I just crashed now.  This is a good rip, all the add-ons are included and work great.  If i come across any problems that I did not encounter when I first played it I will submit another comment."

,Myfeblaus,2010-02-05T21:44Z,"OK... so first I tried the RELOADED Oblivion GOTY.  Installed fine, pressed play on the launcher, the bethesda/2k credits were fine, but after the text copyright info it goes to the title screen for 1 second, no sound, and crashes.  (I only tried it after installing both Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles with it).
I uninstalled that, and apparently it left SecuROM on my computer because suddenly Mass Effect didn't work (other games like Dragon Age did).
I did the best I could to get rid of the SecuROM... I'm gonna try to be more thorough.  But I d/l'd this, and the same thing happened!  fine install, game crashes after opening credits.  I know Shivering Isles is affected by SecuROM, but not Oblivion.
So now I don't know what's going on.  Other games still work well, seems like I have good drivers.
Running Windows 7 64-bit, ATI HD 4670
Hope someone can help."

There is a fix for this but I'm not sure if this wil work. Go to Command Prompt and type in this ""C:\> CONVERT  C:  /fs:ntfs

Although when i look in the distance the the distant grass texture seems to be loading fine.

I tried removing all of the mods I downloaded but the problem still exists. 

I'm not sure why its happening, I'm a bit of a noob.

Any help is very appreciated. "

,sentientphil,2010-06-10T10:04Z,"theres 887 comments! so this wont mean much! but, this ""Reloaded"" version I dl'ed over a year ago and it worked perfectly... vista x64 hp.... I loved the game so much i have just bought it with all the expansions etc.... money well spent! this is a great FPRPG, this and fallout 3 have my complete backing! we need more games like this!!!! Actual, true adventure! puts you in the seat unlike other rpg's... I never liked all that D&D's type of game... dragon age, diablo2, halo2 etc, i played for 30 minutes and give up... I seem to have taken a shining to ""sandbox"" worlds... doing what you like when you like is fantastic! and the graphics and scenery just blows your mind in this and fallout3..... i tried mass effect2, and loved it, but couldnt be bothered to play it again... it seemed to ""unexplorable"" not a true ""adventure"" in my eyes.... many thanks to reloaded... and ul'er too..."
,air721,2010-06-14T21:04Z,Ok first of all remove the PORN some ppl have dads and moms who walk into your room when your playing video games you dipshits so i think first of all you should include that there is a nude patch and secondly GROW UP YOU GAY HOMO's some of you guys are gonna be virgins forever because you spend your time jacking off to animated pictures on a video game so dont keep the fucking nude patch!

Like when I use my alphabet keys they come out as symbols and numbers, i.e. i push the W key over and over and 123456789 comes up.

,Carsf,2012-03-11T06:33Z,"ALRIGHT, here is what you have to do:
-Download the torrent (easy)
-When downloaded you will have a shitload of .rar files. They are all basically the same thing (dunno why)
-Mount the file you unzipped on a Daemon or burn it on a CD (try DAEMON Tools Lite if you need a daemon. it mounts discs so you dont have to burn them)
-After mounting/burning, run the CD. It will start an install
-Install
-Use the .exe file to launch the game
-???
-Profit"

,chrismanlol0,2012-05-08T01:56Z,"The download on here is amazing. Good torrent so far, I will report if game works.
________________________________________Guide for the helpless:
1. Download bittorrent / utorrent and install it
2. Press get this torrent on the torrent you want
3. Wait for it to finish downloading
4. Download Daemon Tools from thepiratebay
5. Mount the biggest file that is compatible with bittorrent 
5. Install the game
6. Either in the download place ((where bittorrent/uttorrent downloaded the ISO or whatever file it may be, there is a crack)) or inside the ISO you mounted there will be a folder in it with all kinds of files, like the exe to start the game, copy that into the installed game
7. Play the game

((Sometimes the game may need a serial code, there will be a generator in those places if needed))

AND if there is no cracks / generator and you need one, go to gamecopyworld.com and search the game. Get the 1.0 version crack / generator of the game."
