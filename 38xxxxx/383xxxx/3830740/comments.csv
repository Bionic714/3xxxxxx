Thx!"
,Richmen6,2007-10-07T14:07Z,This is CLEAN. No hacks what so ever. I'm seeding with BitLord and Utorrent right now. Thanks:)
,Cade78,2007-10-21T16:59Z,I had no problems with a username or password because there isn't any. Great torrent!
,gawinski,2007-10-24T16:40Z,It is with a password so void this one.

Erm, yes there is, this torrent is password protected, I tried hitting okay but it doesn't do anything."
,tried.n.tested,2007-10-29T19:41Z,"I stand corrected, just hit 'Cancel' not 'Okay' when the password box comes up."
,CrownMeKing,2007-10-31T05:53Z,"To put it plain and simple, this doesn't fucking work.
The program doesn't even open"
,CrownMeKing,2007-10-31T18:56Z,"I just tried it on the x64 to no avail.
After I install the demo back over it, then it works. I've had this problem with every one I d/l'ed"
,Zermelo,2007-11-19T07:16Z,"If FRAPS won't open it's because you previously installed the demo version and certain registry entries need to be cleaned out.  Just follow the instructions on this link:

and it will fix the problem."
,Spollero,2007-12-09T10:21Z,"Everyone is seeding fraps slowly, but luckily it isn't a big file."
,Nuggs,2007-12-15T14:29Z,"Thanks mang, been getting my fraps from you for quite a while.  :D"
,Geezguy,2008-01-09T21:29Z,"Yes, it worked! I'm glad I didn't install the trial version before this cracked one! Thanks!"
