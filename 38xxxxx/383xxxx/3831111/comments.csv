,John_Gotti,2007-10-06T10:47Z,"My GF wanted to watch this program. But missed it on tv. So we headed to tv4:s page to watch it. Didn't work with my OS so fired up a windows session in VM-ware. Shit, their shitty pages didn't work perfect in Windows either. Guess i have to force a upgrade on my media player.
Sum: First of, Thanks TV4 for supporting piracy by having a shitty page, only supporting the latest in bloatware OS:es.
THE Really big thanks to TVFi, sotis & all of you who's seeding you asses of :-)"
