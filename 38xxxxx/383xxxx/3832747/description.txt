GREAT comedy!!!!! I loved Tommy Boy with Chris Farley and David Spade in, and this is fantastic too! Great storyline too! Basically Al Donally is running for Governer and he wants to keep his accident-prone brother Mike (Farley) out of the way! So Al's new top adviser Steve Dodds (Spade) tries to keep Mike under wraps until after the election! Needless to say everything goes pear-shaped and you don't have to be a genius to work out the ending. But this is funny, light-hearted stuff and I laughed out loud loads of times throughout the movie! Great story, Great stars, Great film!
