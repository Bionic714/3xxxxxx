,w3sleym,2007-11-05T00:14Z,"it works great.

just open powersuite.exe and the txt file and copy the serial to it and it will work"
,MilleniumMark,2007-11-05T20:11Z,it does work with Vista.  there is an upgrade on their site for the Suite.
,Slavster,2007-11-16T00:43Z,"This program is so great, it's un-freaking believable!"
,ailsa1208,2007-11-17T01:10Z,"I'm running vista os and have downloaded the latest powersuite vista version on official site. But everytime I start spyeraser scanner, it keeps pop up the window saying ""microsoft c++ runtime error"", after clicking ""ok"" the windows explorer will tell me ""this program has stopped working and will now be terminated"". RegistryBooster and SpeedUpMyPC worked fine.

I googled on internet, it seemed like everyone's having the same problem on RegistryBooster, no one has the problem with SpyEraser. I downloaded ""runtifix.exe"" like someone on internet suggested, and uninstalled powersuite, then clean up temp files on my disk, reboot, execute runtifix, reinstall powersuite, and run. But it doesn't work! It's really annoying!!"

,DrunkManCrying,2007-12-22T13:46Z,"I got a problem, 

When I try to launch ""speed up my pc"" my computer reboots itself. Anyone have any clue as to why this is?

,TheoRatzX,2007-12-23T05:05Z,"Everything works great, except for the ""Speed up my PC"" thing. When I try to use it it reboots my computer, just like DrunkManCrying.

Hopefully somebody says how to fix this or what is causing it."

Step 1) Install
Step2) Works Perfect
Step 3) Your happy
Step 4) Slows down your comp 3 days later
Step 5) Your programs work slowly
Step 6) You go crazy to find out whats the problem and u keep scanning more and more using powersuite
Step 7) You finally Re-install Windows!
End of Steps. Enjoy!"
,msipanda,2008-11-29T02:20Z,"ive used uniblue a bunch.... and yeah, it does end up screwing you.  Here is what you do....

download
seed it for others

use it
uninstall
reinstall when needed again!

otherwise, if u leave it installed, ull slowdown like crazy, i think its some sort of scam for u to buy their shit, sounds like a horrible scam, but its common shit."

Best program you'll ever use for your computer.


IT DOES NOT SLOW ANYTHING DOWN


The ONLY reason if at all it would slow your computer down is conflict of programs, you people probably have other anti-Virus and spyware programs which conflict and THAT is what causes you to be slow...


Goes to show how people who have no clue about computers, internet or how they work, should not use them...
You are downloading and using things you don't understand, OBVIOUSLY you are going to have issues, then make the computer, program and everything else look bad, when you are the bad one..."

,gurumarkb,2009-04-05T20:41Z,"Installs and runs ok.  Can't get the SpyEraser to update it's database.  It downloads the database.zip file ok, then says it will restart SpyEraser, and then it does nothing.  I can still do scans but the database is from August 2008 and is outdated.  Anybody have a fix for this problem?"
,gurumarkb,2009-04-05T20:48Z,So far I haven't had any conflicts. I only run NOD32 v3.0.642.9.0 and the TeaTimer of Spybot S&D 1.6.2 memory resident on an Intel E7200 clocked at 3.4 Ghz and 2 GB of ram so PowerSuite isn't affecting XP SP2 performance.  Don't run Spyware Doctor 6.0 memory resident as that is most definitely a resource hog and performance drain.
,sam.theo,2009-12-10T16:05Z,"anikethd is right..download at your own risk!!!

I think its bull..because it crashes if you want to start PC Optemizer..ill give it a 0.2 out fo 10..dont do it."
