Release Notes.
==========================================================================

John Digweed returns with the eagerly anticipated third volume in his 
acclaimed Transitions series... On Renaissance of course.

John says: "Musically speaking, I?ve been shifting through the gears 
over the series, he says and we?re now approaching top speed. This mix 
still represents an immediate snapshot of my favourite tunes and producers, 
but it?s also about that specific energy you get at 3 or 4 am at the best 
clubs or festivals around the world"

To capture and realise this John worked a whopping 20 tracks into the 
album. 

"Running the tracklist up so high was a conscious decision, he 
elaborates, it allowed me to generate that energy and atmosphere, which 
I further reinforced by creating exclusive edits.

Every track on T3 has been given the magic touch by continuous layering 
nd in the overall running time the passages where there isn?t a mix running 
are actually shorter than those where they are. It?s an intense ride which 
in true Digweed fashion builds over its 78-minute excursion. The mix kicks 
off with Sasha?s elusively titled ?Coma ?. Moving on highlights include the 
innovative use of Lawrence?s ?Along The Wire?, broken down and part-used 
throughout its neighbours ?Sweet N Candy? and ?Einzelkind?. 

The Dusty Kid / Aldo Kadiz mash-up, ?Begun The End Has? from Harthouse 
regular Joel Mull, the incredible Josh Wink remix of ?Someone Else? and 
Gui Boratto?s emotive interpretation of Adam Freeland?s latest, 
?Silverlake Pills? are similarly outstanding.
