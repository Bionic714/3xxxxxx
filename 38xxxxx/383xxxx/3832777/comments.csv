,Dr.Beans,2008-01-31T21:10Z,Delicious 7z can of Ratchet and Clank I had ever had.
,xbattler,2008-03-02T10:41Z,do you need to put this directly on the mem stick or do you need to extract it first? Does this game works on the psp-2000 too? :P
,direct4mhell,2008-03-03T07:45Z,xbattler: you need to install custom firmware on your psp slim to run this iso. Google if you want to know how. You will need a Pandora battery though. After tht you just need to create a directory called ISO in the root of PSP and just put this iso there. Pretty straightforward if you ask me :)
,xbattler,2008-03-07T13:35Z,yeah thnx ;) im letting someone install custom firmware :)
,original_jtb,2008-03-12T04:29Z,Thanks!  I have been looking for this since it came out and finally someone put it up!  Now seed damn you seed!!!!!!1!
,redimus,2008-03-25T20:19Z,"When I put this game in the ISO folder, my PSP doesn't find it at all. I have 3.90 m33-2 and I have many games working."
,redimus,2008-03-26T07:53Z,I figured it out change the name to something shorter like clank.iso I did this by converting it to .cso and changing the name.
,atreju1978,2008-04-03T01:25Z,"""the game could not be started"" on my psp slim - downgraded today"
,light24bulbs,2008-10-07T00:57Z,"yeah the game could not be started because you need to disable the UMD drive.  Side note- FUCK FLASH ADDS.  Now when starting up the psp in m33 custom firmware hold down the right trigger(clear button at the top of the psp, i always thought it was cool how they are clear.)  Now go into some settings or options or something.  Whatever.  Eventually you will find something about a umd drive.  Enable that function(which disables the drive) and the game will load.  also redimus says it needs a short name.  try that too.  "
,cLaMsTaLl,2008-12-24T06:35Z,"Any idea if the Multiplayer ""Infrastructure"" mode works?
