Ratchet and Clank for the PSP handheld system.  It's an iso in a can of 7z.

For those of you that don't know what 7z is, it's a compression format called 7-zip.  Decompress this file using 7-zip (obtained at 7-zip.org for free) and pop the iso over to your PSP or hard drive so you can either play it or make it even smaller with UMDgen (which you can use to save it as a compressed iso file compatible with your PSP firmware).  I'm trying to keep my seeds up!  But I'm the only one seeding at the moment.
