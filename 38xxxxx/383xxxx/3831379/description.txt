Subject: EMS Tape

Speaking as an EMT at FDNY EMS Station 19 in The
Bronx, My fellow EMTS/PARAMEDICS ,and fellow
Firefighters,Civillian Volunteers,Port Authority
Employees did a good job inspite of the confusion
of that day. Unfortunately I was two years to
late, I got sworn in 7/7/04 as an EMT. It's a
gut wrenching feeling for me to listen to The
EMS TAPES, BECAUSE I WAS NOT THEIR TO HELP! 
I worked in Manhatten before and two of the Units
I worked on are involved, 04-Henry, and 07-Charlie
were sent in. At The EMS ACADEMY IN QUEENS AT
Fort Totten, I had the pleasure of having 
instructors that were there that day, and they 
said IT WAS A TOTAL CLUSTER F----. The Musuem in
the basement at the academy has artifacts from the
93 Bombing and 9/11. Also I like to add we lost
two medics, and recently two EMTS from the 
asbestos they inhaled. The starting salary for
Emt when I came aboard was 27,900, and we recently
got an 8% raise. If you want more details visit
The unoffical FDNY EMS PAGE- EMS Still the best
inspit of FDNY Incompetence. Sanatation gets more 
then EMS. Now don't get me wrong they should be 
paid a good wage, but they should pay EMS the same
rate of pay,because we have to take a college 
level course to perform our jobs. Bottom line is 
The City of New York does not consider our job
hazzardous, so we don't get paid a livable wage.

Subject: A day for heroes

These tapes prove forever the FDNY title of "The Bravest". From the calm voices of fire fighters and chiefs, many of whom died that day, to the desperate calls from trapped firemen and civilians, this is a historical snapshot of the worst day in my living history.
Forget all the BS conspiracy theories, these tapes show again and again that firemen and EMS run in while veryone else runs away. 
May God Bless Them All.

Subject: True life heros in action!

I have to respectfuly disagree with k1mgy, about the reason for fighting the release of these tapes. Having listened to them in their entirety, I see nothing at all to be ashamed of. In fact, I see everything to be proud of. I don't pretend to know thier reasons, but I can say that the FDNY had everything to be proud of that day.

These people performed heroically from the minute they arrived on the scene. Despite all sorts of chaos and confusion brought about by conditions that only a very few could ever imagine, they never flinched in the performance of their duties. 

To say that it was an efort to hide anything is... well... unspeakable.

God rest the souls of Ney York's Bravest!

Subject: "Freedom Tower" Is an Abomination

Excellent work was obviously done gathering this material. I'll revise this review once I've heard all recordings. The sounds of Battalion 7 Chief Orio Palmer and his huffing and puffing assistant, Lieutenant Stephen Belsen, who was trying to reach the older but far better-conditioned man (yes, I've learnt the names of many of these heroes, as I'm sure you have as well), are awe-inspiring. They had no idea the South Tower was about to fall, and they inside, high up, along with it.
They had no idea that Thermate charges had been working on the steel structure for at least an hour, cutting through steel that a fleet of Boeings could not.

I will not soap box on your work here, my friend.

But I will not leave for now, without stating that the demon who stood over the sacred graves at Ground Zero, bleating into his bullhorn, was, and is, no man.

Subject: Confusion, disorganization, disaster

These tapes - all of them - but particularly those of the Manhattan dispatch and the Port Authority Repeater - demonstrate what happens when an efficient, well trained fire department is faced with a rapidly-unfolding disaster of a scale never before faced. Their job, one paid for by many wasted lives, was to save as many of the innocent as possible. Many of these crews rushed into one, then the other building, struggling to reach trapped occupants. Most people run from a burning structure. Firefighters often rush in. But they know the limits of what they do and, with proper communications and procedures, generally do not go beyond a reasonable limit where their own lives are put in unnecessary risk.

Except in this case.

Communications were a shambles. Crews continued on. Procedures were non-existent. A situation like this had never been faced. Crews continued on. The scene had all the markings of disaster with people hurling themselves from smashed windows 70 and more floors above the ground. Crews continued on.

Elevators in one building would not go beyond the 40th floor and so firefighters and their commanders struggled on foot, with heavy equipment, up the narrow stairways, some climbing 30 or more floors to find "many" of the dead and injured. In the end, just prior to one collapse, firefighters were using axes to free themselves from a jammed elevator, "chopping our way out". A division chief, leading his crews, struggled his way to the 74th floor, to find fire, dangerous openings in the stairwell walls leading to deadly drops, and more bodies.

The New York Fire Department bitterly fought to prevent the release of these recordings. Having listened carefully to them all, more than once, I understand why. They stand as an indictment against the Department's lack of communications skill and facilities; lack of coordination with other agencies; lack of training for this level of situation; lack of cooperation and coordination even among their own command structures.

Individual heroics were not enough to overcome these. Many died, in my view, unnecessarily because of them.

I do not know if, by listening to these recordings, others will be left with the same impressions. Perhaps the evaluations are best left to the professionals, yet a sinking, disturbed sense that things could have turned out much differently remain. The deficiencies that these recordings evidence may leave you, too, with the same emptyness. A loss that no man with a bullhorn standing upon a sacred grave will ever fill.

Subject: The truth hurts.. but must be free.

People try to hide away pain and suffering, to forget what has happened. By doing so we damn ourselves to repeat 9/11. You cannot hide knowledge of the wolf from the shepherd. Listen and learn, so you will know what the wolf brings.
