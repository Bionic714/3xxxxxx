This is my collection of stuff(see torrentname) that i\'ve been collecting over the years and that i always wanted to release so i could help others with most of their problems. unfortunately i\'ve had some HD crashes and been offline for 2 years, and i never got around to organizing all the files(partly cos im in the middle of moving).

Anywayz, try browsing around :p im sure you people with soundproblems will get your fixes

There are 2 Depackers(i think) for CG/BGM extracting from .GGD and the most popular formats and another one for WILL games with their .ARC files a friend of mine made but never completed...-_-\' (damn you Karo-sama *shakes fist*)

Also 2 G-collection CG Patches for Chain & Kana, use the number sequence for the password
