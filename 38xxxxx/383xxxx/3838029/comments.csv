Please seed. :("
,rockstar11998,2008-04-04T17:30Z,"bodthedog - You made some very pertinent arguments.  I don't agree with his explanations about Ramadan either.  They can twist the Hadeeth and Koran around and go back and forth to suit their need at the time.
I am confused about your statement about God not making mistakes.  My confusion lies in the fact that you seemed to say all religions are bad and brain-washers in other posts.  Are you for God or not?  If you are, you must have a way to worship Him - therefore a religion or belief system with guidelines at the very least.  If I'm mistaken please tell me.  Best wishes to you and please don't give up on the truth."
,rockstar11998,2008-04-07T21:58Z,"bodthedog - First of all I want to commend you on your Golden rule mentality.  I am sure you could try to and I quote 'YOU TELL ME HOW GREAT YOUR RELIGION IS AND ILL TELL YOU HOW GREAT ITS NOT' but as God as my witness you would be confounded.  I have answers to all queries about this life, our pre-earth life, and the life hereafter.  I will gladly teach you these principles, ordinances and doctrines if you would like. 
I don't want to put you down for you saying you have your very own belief system but God has already prophesied there would be people like you.  The scriptures say: verse 14 And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people;
  15 For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;
  16 They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his OWN GOD, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.
Verse 16 about your own God is the one to focus on the rest are just lead up scriptures."
,rockstar11998,2008-05-09T18:34Z,"eljafoufi - first off you're not going to get anywhere with bodthedog - aka Korihor, Laman, Lemuel.  He is full of himself and just wants all religion done away with so he won't feel guilty about his sins and pride.  This is what we call projecting in terms of psychology.  He blames his own problems and the problems of the world on religion rather on what he does and the fact that Satan tempts others to do evil.
I know Islam is also led by Satan so you trying to support it no matter how good your intentions are is futile.  Everyone knows the true Islam wants to take over the world.  They are just doing it more tactfully these days.  They are migrating people across the world and teaching anti-Christian and anti-Jewish things in their Mosques.  If you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest you watch ""Undercover Mosque""."
,PakistaniDragon,2010-01-28T09:43Z,"Aslamu-Alaikum,

I hope everyone is well.  I've been downloading this for weeks now and still i've only managed to reach 66.6%.  Everyone else is also stuck on 66.6%.  The highest i've seen somone with a downloaded copy is 94.6%.  Anyway, i've decided to give up.

A good effort.

Thank You

From what I have learned thus far, this movie is the best representation of the truth about Islam. With all that is going on in the world today and many people's misconceptions about Islam this is a must see for all.

Not only is it an educational masterpiece... The Message has a brilliant musical score, beautiful cinematography, a wonderful script, and terrific acting. If your video stores do not carry it, order it from Amazon.com and learn the truth about the origins of the worlds fastest growing religion and what it stands for. "
,barton101,2012-08-09T15:33Z,"Next time, please include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
