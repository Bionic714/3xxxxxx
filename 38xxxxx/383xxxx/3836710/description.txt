Release Notes 
The new single of 'Twina' shows us a taste of
the new elegant and intelligent style of
'Twina'.
In the last years, Assaf Twina worked as a
soundman at the leading sport channel of
Israel - Chanel-5, at the same time, he built
up his professional studio and finished the
sound studies.
The album expresses Assaf's experience in
musical production and sound knowledge.
The unusual guitar lines combined with
interesting vocal (by Assaf!) breaks the
normal 'full on' wave and creates Twina's
unique style and the most important -
different style.
In the 'Zip Code' single you will find 'Zip
Code' and 'see the light-remix '(original
made with vocal over), two dance floor hits
which reflect the forthcoming album spirit.
You can also find 'Q project-bosaversion', a
different open minded version to 'Q-project'
which is going to be release on the album.
'Twina' is on the way to strike we are ready
for it... The question is... Are you
ready..?!?!
