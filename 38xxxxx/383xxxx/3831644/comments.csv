,beli123,2007-10-06T12:39Z,Is this the Japanese version or has it been translated into English?
,midsunset,2007-10-11T21:16Z,Im getting this tm.exe error anyway to fix it?
,midsunset,2007-10-11T21:17Z,"@beli123 this is the japanese version there is no fully translated english version yet, but there are partly translated english patches"
,CCRLH85,2008-03-16T17:19Z,"In my opinion the game is actually better than the anime, also go to mirrormoon.com they have translation patches for the Fate and Unlimited Blade Works paths of this game."
,Anti-Noob,2008-04-05T22:18Z,"im getting some problems installing, I run the installer from mirrormoon.com and everything runs fine until I get to the third cd, however once I click ok with the 3rd cd mounted I get an install unsuccessful message.

I noticed the 3rd cd is in img format whilst 1 and 2 are bin format.

im currently using poweriso to mount my images... does anybody know a way to fix this, and has anyone installed successfully?"
,Vaistokas,2008-04-13T20:16Z,"I get same problems as Anti-Noob when installing 3rd cd. But I managed to solve problems by downloading another version of 3rd cd here: http://www.mini_nova.org/tor/284444 .

That version of 3rd cd worked great with 1st and 2nd cds of this torrent. And I think it's best to mount that .ccd file (not directly img) of the 3rd cd."

What the hell are you smoking?

The anime adaptation was decent, certainly better than the (non-existent lolo) Tsukihime anime adaptation, but it doesn't even begin to do the original game justice.

Shirou is at his shittiest in Fate-Route, which is what the anime (mostly) follows. Unlimited Blade Works is a good step above Fate-Route in terms of changes in the protagonist and the overall mood of the plot, while Heaven's Feel is on an entirely fucking different level. Even if it's just Fate-Route of the game we're comparing the anime with: many plot details are left out in the anime, along with thousands of lines of narration and inner-dialogue from Shirou.

The anime is worth the watch, but you owe it to yourself to play this game (particularly if you enjoyed the anime adaptation.) There's an English translation available for the Fate and Unlimited Blade Works routes of the game, and even a voice patch using resources from the PS2 version (voices 99.8% of all dialogue.)"
,zetsubo,2008-05-31T14:52Z,"I'm not very experienced with this kind of thing but, whenever I try to use the installer from mirrormoon.com, it says I cant find the disc at the specified location (its saved in a folder)... how do I actually do this, cause Im pretty sure im doing it wrong. Should I burn it on a disc or something?"
,sistagirl63,2008-06-25T07:57Z,"hmmm...all three disks worked perfect for me. 
mount the .cdd file for the 3rd disk.

seconded. repeatedly.

to zetsubo: i'm guessing you're telling the installer where the ccd files are. you have to load those image files using something like daemon or alcohol 120% before installer recognizes them."
,punisher100,2008-08-04T04:20Z,"If someone could help me it would be very awesome...
Here's my problem. When I try to install the game by mounting the 3 cds, everything works out pretty well. I mount the first two .bin files and the .ccd file with magic disc. But as soon as i mount the 3rd one, it says impossible to copy the files from the cd. So i first tought that it might be an error from the cd file. So I downloaded another version of the 3rd cd. Same result..."
,ssaya,2008-08-05T05:05Z,"I had no problem installing this torrent, no problem with the 3rd cd image that some people did. I used DAEMON Tools Pro to mount all 3 images, which I downloaded from PB as well. "
,punisher100,2008-08-06T18:24Z,"Ok it's all fixed. My main problem is that magic disc seems to have some problems to mount .ccd files. To get it correctly I used Daemon Tools.

So I repeat guys, do not use magic disc for the 3rd cd."
,dvnge,2008-08-20T12:27Z,why is my download going so slowly?
,MageHeart,2008-10-27T23:23Z,"I've just finished the Fate route. It's the route that anime is adapted from. The anime shows things that you don't see in the Fate route, such as Archer's UBW or the thing between Caster and Sakura.

This may be an H-game, but just ignore that. It's a brilliant game, it's actually the first I've played, after watching the anime, and it's amazing.

If you liked the anime, you'll love this.
If you loved the anime, there aren't words to describe how you'll feel about this. Same with me.

Just download it.

This is the Japanese version, but an English patch is available for the Fate and Unlimited Blade Works routes at http://mirrormoon.org/projects/fate_stay_night

I'll say one more thing.

,MageHeart,2008-11-13T19:18Z,"The full English translation patch has been released by Mirrormoon, as of 3rd November 2008.

Can be found at Mirrormoon's site.

Mirrormoon in no way encourages piracy of this VN. They are completely against it, I am taking the responsibility for telling you about their patch. Please go and buy this brilliant visual novel, instead of pirating it. If need be, pirate it now, but please pay for it once you can afford it. Order it from some sort of website, or something.

I am in no way related to Mirrormoon, except for enjoying their brilliant work on translating this."

,karg42,2009-01-14T02:35Z,"At the risk of sounding like a moron, how exactly do you mount a CCD file?  A few people have said that they've done it, but I seem to be having trouble getting PowerISO to agree with me.  Any advice would be appreciated."
,Wixyz,2009-01-21T00:07Z,"Karg42, download Daemon Tools, it works perfectly with that. "
,carmine_01,2009-01-28T06:00Z,"Hey for everyone having trouble installing this:

No CD/DVD required.

1.  use DAMEON TOOLs, guaranteed to work.  You can install the LATEST free version by googling it.

2.  Once Dameon tools is installed, OPEN the shortcut, and the icon should appear on your tool bar, it looks like a Blue Thuderbolt encircled by Grayness(near your clock).  

3.  Right Click Thunder Bolt icon (DameonTools)

4.  You should, hopefully see the following options: Dameon Tools Panel, Virtual CD/DVD..., Preferences, etc etc.

5. CLICK ""Virtual CD/DVD-Rom"", and from there a sub-menu box will slide out with two options:  ""Device 0..."" and ""Set number of Drives...""

6.  First click ""set Number of Drives..."" and from there another menu-box will appear with numbers ranging from 4-1.  CLICK ""3""

7.  Now a message will pop saying ""Updating Virtual Drives..."" 

8. Once the message goes away, right click Thunder Bolt icon again, and click Virutal CD/DVD-ROm again

9.  You should now see 4 options! : ""Device 0: ..."", ""Device 1: ..."", ""Device 2: ....,"" and of course ""Set number of Drives.

10.  CLICk ""Device 0: ..."" and click the ""Mount Image"" option.

From there, add the file ""Fate Disc 1"".  

11.  Once you click ""add"", you should see the ""AutoPlay"" box from there you can begin installing Fate/Stay Night.  

12.  During the installtion, you will be asked to insert the second CD.  Now for this step all you to do is Mount the image for ""Fate Stay disc 2"" onto ""Device 1"", and for the final disc...

13.  Be sure to ""Mount Image"" for Disc 3 by using the ""FateDisc3.ccd"" and NOT  FateDisc 3.  For some reason mounting FateDisc 3 didn't work.  

If this didn't work or you are confused please reply back and I will try my best to explain or maybe some other commenter will better explain how to do this."
,SolidKobra,2009-01-30T06:37Z,"Using carmine_01's i found a problem..

When it asks for the second disk, like the directions instruct me, i but the file on the drive and everything works normally. Until around the middle of the copying, it says that the installation failed and i have to resent the installation. I tried it again and the problem is still there.
This happens when I try to use the mirror moon's English installer.

So does anyone know what to do?"

,CEDR777,2009-04-23T16:55Z,"in my opinion 

1.)power ISO is limited to img and iso files. it doesnt support the clone cd files.

2.)use daemon tools as an alternate mounter, it supports ccd file extensions.

3.)magic ISO is an affiliate software for PowerISO, so it mighn not work for ccd's.  "

4. Mount it in device:0 replacing Cd1
5. It will ask 4 Cd 3
5. Mound Cd3.ccd not the image replacing CD2
6. After Installation Download the Full English Patch in http://mirrormoon.org/projects/fate_stay_night

I used PowerISO to mount the first two discs (I assume it doesn't really matter) and Daemon Tools Lite to mount the third.

1. Mount the first disc (BIN file)
2. Begin installation
3. After installation prompts you, mount and install the second disc (BIN file)
4. After the next prompt, mount and install THE CUE FILE FOR THE SECOND DISC. NOT ANY OF THE FILES RELATED TO THE THIRD DISC.
5. After that finishes installing, mount and install the third disc (IMG file).

That worked for me. "
