,Reggeaton,2007-10-16T16:37Z,can i see this film on a regular dvd player?
,Timmmm,2008-01-16T20:09Z,"You'll need a DVD player that can play x264 (AKA MPEG4 AVC) video (possible) and AC3 audio (likely I think). Few (if any) DVD players can play matroska files so you'll have to convert it to avi. That should (in theory!) be quite easy and not take long.

Also you probably don't know this (not many people do) and it will be useful knowledge: The extension of a video file (.avi, .mkv (for matroksa), .ogm, etc) is descriptive of the 'container' format. This just ... well basically it groups the video and audio into one file and synchronises them. For a given container (say avi) a huge number of audio and video codecs (what actually compresses the data) can be used.

Hope that helps. What I want to know is: nearly 8 GB for an x264 720p film?!?! Methinks you set the bitrate needlessly high! Others seem to encode it to half the size."
,HiJon89,2008-02-09T22:29Z,Well the movie is almost 3 hours long.
