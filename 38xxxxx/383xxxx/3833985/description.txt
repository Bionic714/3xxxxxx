This upload is for Jubo, hope you enjoy it =)


This is my [probably] complete discography of capsule, on the contemode label. They're Japanese in origin, from the Shibuya-kei music era. With sound ranging from electropop to jazz, it's a very cool sound for those getting into Shibuya-kei, totally unknown in the States, relatively unknown elsewhere.

Variable bitrates, lowest is probably 128 (a few tracks at the most).

Enjoy!


edit on 8/16/08:

this torrent is incomplete if you probably didn't recognize it already, it's missing Haikara Girl (capsule's first album), and most likely one or two of their newest releases (the names of which elude me now). Still a good torrent to pick up if you're new to capsule, I'm amazed people are still seeding this.
