,caxarlis,2008-01-14T15:52Z,is this the full software guys?
,caxarlis,2008-01-15T11:48Z,"Ok, I downloaded the software, cracked RF but could not license RFnodes. And now when i run RF I cannot save my scenes :( 

Any advice?"
,caxarlis,2008-01-15T13:39Z,"I licensed RFnodes, but still can't save my projecs. As soon as I create one, it says: 'Can't save workspace. Check user permissions or disk space.'

the problem is that I have more than 28 gigs of free space in my hard drive. How can I change the user permissions?

Thanks for the upload and help "
,Firestorm037,2008-02-06T02:11Z,"Very nice! Full version works perfect! The only thing, when you want to liscense realflownode...The command is

(Replace the path to where you installed it)
cd C:\Program Files\Next Limit\RealFlow4
realflownode -license"

,sachin0487,2008-03-17T15:19Z,how to download this one... i cudnt get the file yet... pls help 
,CGartist,2008-03-23T21:16Z,Hey thanks for the torrent but im having problems to license it i followed the instructions and selected the licence from file but it says invalid License can anyone help me plzzz
,toogoodgeek,2008-10-10T12:16Z,"Thanks for this torrent, Bravo hcker2000. I got it installed perfectly without any hassle. To those who are having problem. I think you miss out to copy the .mll and .mel files to their proper folders. And you should have basic understanding of dos commands to run the realflownode.exe with the -license parameters. "
,DeezPleez,2008-11-03T14:26Z,"To completely download this torrent:
1.) Download Torrent from link. 
2.) Unzip all files and folders (recommend using the ""wizard"" if not familiar with extracting manually). 
3.) Install RF. When finished it will promt for license..ignore, press ""continue"". 
4.)Close RF and Unzip ""Crack.zip"" this time use ""Extract to"" button and extract to RF directory. (directory is usually located in C:Drive/program files/Nextlimit folder( if you're using Windows 98/XP)
5.)Start up RF via Shortcut (if you created one). this time pressing ""get license"". ""From File"". Locate ""License4.dat"" icon and select open. RF Licensed!! :-)... NOT FINISHED YET!!
6.)Go to ""Start"" menu on desktop and select ""Run..."" Type in ""command"" in space provided..this will open your DOS CMD center.
7.)type in: realflownode.exe -license  
8.)If you typed that exact line WITH THE SPACE between "".exe"" and ""-license"" you will be rewarded with a congrats ""Realflownodes Licensed""..if not, you probably weren't paying attention!
9.)You'll have to repeat step 5.) in order to totally complete the setup..
THANX TO HCKER2000 4 the DL"
,IXIMAGES,2008-12-15T08:43Z,"Please help.

Any suggestions?"
,Germanskyline,2009-03-16T22:50Z,"Hello, it works perfect! Just one question, how do i install the plugin for 3ds max 9?"
,blipmedia,2009-04-15T23:32Z,works great . can't import into max. Looking for a solution. so far the threads I read are conversations discussing a wide spread problem with Realflow and Max. :(
,sentientphil,2010-05-14T06:50Z,"got it to work fine.... thanks....

not really what i was after though! i thought i could export......

Does anyone know a GOOD Max 2010 plugin? 

Glu+Pwrap are fantastic the very few times it doesnt crash, and always when i have set the scene up and click ""GO""... its quick too (on my pc anyway)..... but im sensing realflow is good enough to keep out of the hands of us ""student"" lot so its about time the plugin secret is shared :)

please let me know if anyone is willing to let me into the RF circle of trust! email me at my spam address ""fil20022002uk@yahoo.com""..... my thanks and unconditional debt will be duly given!"
,pirateman247,2011-03-31T12:29Z,SEED PLZ !!!!!!!!!!
,welhim,2012-06-03T04:04Z,it didn't support 3ds max 2010 version..
