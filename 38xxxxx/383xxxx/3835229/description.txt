[This is really only for VideoRedo]


OK, solved reinstalling/updating so it always works as I've tested it plenty. This also works with newer versions where you don't have the key (see below) but that's a different thing to what I'm doing here. If your VideoRedo works fine I wouldn't bother with this but it's handy to keep the notes.



Tested on 2.5.4.507 and back to 2.5.3.500 and then back to 2.5.4.507 with Trial-Reset v3.0 RC9. I used CCleaner http://www.ccleaner.com first and again after you uninstall.

1) Uninstall any VideoReDo version installed on your computer

2) Run Trial-Reset, scan for Armadillo

NOTE: If you download a new version of Trial-Reset make sure you scan it. AVG anti-virus allows you to right click and scan files for free 


First time you use Trial-Reset it may reset your Microsoft Word by asking you to accept the licence once again. Doesn't change settings or anything else.

Backup your registry and don't fuck around with this if you don't. 

XP tested only.
