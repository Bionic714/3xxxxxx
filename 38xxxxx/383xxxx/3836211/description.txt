          Three bank robbers terrorize Tampa and police devise a plan to 
          catch them. But who will survive when this perfect plan goes 
          awry? Next, a desperate parent takes his child's school board 
          hostage. Now their fate rests in the hands of a police 
          sharpshooter. Finally, a policeman's little girl fears for her 
          fathers safety. Can her words of caution save his life?
          Through skillful police work and intense surveillance, the 
          police are able to catch their killer in the process of 
          disposing incriminating evidence.
