Deadpool! - Live in Holly Springs County
The quality isn't that great, but then again, neither was the band. This is a live recording, which explains the quality, of a short lived band that featured friends of mine. Never recorded anything aside from this, which pissed me off cuz we were gonna do a split 7"...

Palatka - Incomplete Discography
Not technically a power-violence band, they preferred the term "emo-violence" because it sounded stupider. As far as I'm concerned, one of the most under-rated bands ever. From Florida, most of this s**t was on No Idea Records, with numerous other tracks on splits, comps, etc.

Soul Swallower - Self-Titled 2005 and Demo
I don't really know anything about this band aside from the fact that I have these two releases...

Spazz - Crush! Kill! Destroy! and Sweatin' to the Oldies 3: Skatin', Satan, and Katon
I don't feel that Spazz needs any introduction...if you know Power Violence, you should know this band already...


V/A - Possessed To Skate 1999
A most excellent skate/power violence comp put out by Pessimiser Records featuring Charles Bronson, Spazz, Palatka, Assholeparade, Pretentious Assholes, Unanswered and Despise You


Voorhees - Crystal Lakes Legacy 2001
UK PV with a band name to be jealous of





Enjoy & don't get blood on the carpet
