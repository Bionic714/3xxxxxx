The first episode of "Talent Suomi", the Finnish version of the "Talent" -franchise.

Audio is in Finnish and sadly I'm too lazy to make subtitles.


Recorded with a DVR to a .HAV then converted to an .MPG and from that to a .AVI and then compressed with XviD for video and MP3 for audio.

I'll be seeding for a while (with my magnificent 512kbps up) and then I'm going to upload episode 02.


Hope you enjoy!
