,joi93,2007-11-19T17:09Z,i got the same thing at school.... e-mail?
,thehunteddr,2008-02-16T15:23Z,"you can always try and find the SAM file in the :\Windows\repair and crack it that way, once you get that you can always try and find the RConsole password. If your school uses older systems then winxp find the file in the :\WINNT\repair once you have the file download LC5 from here and start cracking. If you dont have right tell the teacher you want to work on a project at home but you cant save the file to a floppy. Once they login for you(make sure your word doc is up tho) try and transfer the file."

,SirLexington,2008-08-03T21:31Z,"I can confirm that this is indeed Novell NetWare 5.1 (not 6.5 as mentioned in the description). 

Still, a big thank you goes out to the uploader as I have been looking for this one for a while :) 

Burned ISO to CD and it installs and runs fine. The licenses for installation and encryption are located in the LICENSE folder on the CD"
