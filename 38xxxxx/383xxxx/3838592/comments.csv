,NeptoN,2007-10-12T01:03Z,ThnX  NP ;D
,gtr2,2007-10-12T05:33Z,"fuckin hilarious. What a crock of shit this is.
This is good for those who dont know how to create a shortcut and modify properties.

The rest of the included files are steam files from 2006. WTF! NOT NEEDED.
Unleashed release works perfect. UNTOUCHED.

You fuckin knob. Take this shit down, you're an idiot and this fix is BULLSHIT. 

FUCKING KNOB!!"
,asdfx,2007-10-12T08:54Z,"gtr2:

With Portal I had to download a fix, although that was an ""official"" fix from  Unleashed. This was despite the majority of the pirates having no problem just adding the parameters. I added the parameters but still got an error.

I don't know if this applies to Episode Two, but you should chill the fuck down, because you don't know shit."
,NeptoN,2007-10-12T11:54Z,"If u haw a trouble geting portal to work, U can Copy all the files in to the same folder as hl2.exe in the Portal folder and edit (sart.bat) from saying [hl2.exe -steam -game ep2] to say [hl2.exe -steam -game portal] 

hope this helps someone.

Enjoy ;D

And the steam Dll files R ther to help hl2.exe to finde the Steam loader.

,Destabilizator,2007-10-12T13:45Z,"If I try to start the game, even with this fix, it pops and error ""MountAppFilesystem() failed:""

,NeptoN,2007-10-12T14:42Z,"Hmm. Wen i Copyed the Dll filse in the same folder as hl2.exe the (error ""MountAppFilesystem() failed:"") stoped poping upp, and the game starts.

You have to unrar the game from the normal file, don't start at the rar00 file otherwise it won't unzip everything and you get a winrar error

Start the unrare from unl-ep2 if u downloaded it in 2 parts from MIRC it's in the 2nd part, put all the parts together and start to unrar the file from the unl-ep2.rar not unl-ep2.00

and it will work fine if u add the -steam -whatever"
,UtCollector,2007-10-13T01:28Z,"Tot run the game just make a start.bat file in the folder that hl2.exe is in. place the folowing tekst in the start.bat:

start /wait hl2.exe /-steam -game ep2"
,Destabilizator,2007-10-13T13:38Z,"2Quad-Damage: I've unpacked everything without any errors, sadly deleted the .rar parts cuz of disk space :/"
,dudew8,2007-10-15T17:09Z,did NOT WORK for me-.-
,psychosmurf,2007-10-19T02:28Z,@gtr2:  You're a twat . . . didn't you notice all the glitches in the game?  The guys just standing there with their arms held out doing nothing as if they're in a trance?  How about the car in the body shop that's welding itself?  The unleashed game works but there are still some flubs that need fixing.  Stop acting like you are TPB.
,Agent_24,2007-10-30T22:56Z,"Yes, has anyone released a bugfix for the missing textures and the npcs that just stand there doing nothing?"
,micke22,2007-12-28T16:04Z,"thank you, works very well"
,Atlantix01,2007-12-29T21:05Z,"It works for me... I had load hangs/freezes on OrangeBox-Detonaiton and after applying the undead patch for steam, I can now run games (tested on ep1 currently) without freezes through steam."
,Mank-Flank,2008-04-12T17:43Z,this is some shit
,nathan252l,2010-12-31T04:17Z,"i still get the error mountappfilesystem() failed:
