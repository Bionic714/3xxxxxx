,Born_After_David,2007-12-14T20:55Z,"For those who don't know 7z ""7 (seven z) Zip file format"" its just another way to format your files other kinds really. You'll need all zip or you can the one base for it called 7z it is easy to find just type it in google or some search engine. if this does not suit your needs I have been using alzip just spelt like this it works with all formated types so that's that :) I would just liek to say even though this download is for the psp I""m going to try and play it on my psx emu... he he might work you never know I did it with others.
