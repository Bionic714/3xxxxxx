Warren G, Nate Dogg, and Snoop Dogg bring their old 213 crew back together in time for summer picnics and park jams. Though Warren G appears throughout, it's mostly a Dogg's day as Snoop and Nate give the album its gangsta-lean feel. The vibe is strictly laid back--the group pens odes to liquor, women, and weed, including a remake of Rick James's "Mary Jane" (released just before the singer's passing). For the most part however, 213 has their minds on sex more than smoking out, with playful cuts like "Groupie Luv" balancing the profane shock of "My Dirty Ho." Musically, they lay down classic G-Funk with that signature squeegee sound--just the right groove for street cruising and backyard partying, especially the sweet soul of "Another Summer" and the catchy funk of "Lil Girl." The Hard Way isn't quite as strong as you'd expect from such a marquee trio, but if you're looking for a collection of pleasant made-for-summer tunes, 213 is the area code to dial. --Oliver Wang
