The first milestone was achieved in July 2003, when version 1.0 of LEGO Digital Designer was released. In February 2004, an online 3D Gallery went live, 
allowing designers to share their ideas via the Internet. By 2005, thousands of LEGO Factory enthusiasts were designing, 
sharing and ordering their own custom models ?C and the one-millionth copy of LEGO Digital Designer was downloaded on 25 September that year. 
Now at version 1.6, LEGO Digital Designer is quite simply the best virtual building system out there ?C with its Click-Stick method of 3D modeling 
winning praise from children, parents, teachers and design enthusiasts everywhere. And, as the virtual design platform behind a growing number of LEGO 
products, LEGO Digital Designer is here to stay. A host of improvements and new features are already in development, including an improved user interface, 
new connectivity, more life-like building, Technic compatibility and improved train building and animation. So stay tuned with LEGO Digital Designer,
