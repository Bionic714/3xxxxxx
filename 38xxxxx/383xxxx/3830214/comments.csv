,xLogicx,2007-10-05T20:23Z,SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is one of the beste movies from the 80s!! :D
,SpringareG7,2007-10-05T22:33Z,Why does it almost always work so slowly at TPB? Almost no one is seeding. This is so lame.

Settle down Francis, it's coming.  Not everyone has a T1 to their computer.  Give it time."
,SpringareG7,2007-10-09T22:21Z,"Great. Have been downloading since it got here and I am at 40,8 %. Marvelous.

,Butwheaty,2007-10-09T23:32Z,"@SpringareG7

What have you ever contributed?  You sound like someone who doesn't seed anything once your download is complete."
,alros89,2007-10-13T22:06Z,Please seed we are all stuck at 60% after 1 week!!!

Thank you, thank you very much.

This is exactly why TPB is getting worse and worse.

I have been uploading/downloading for days now, and still standing at 59,9 % and NOTHING is happening. 

Well, the only thing that really happend was your crappy comment. Bad uploads like this is too often been seen at TPB.

People here doesn't take there responsabilty after downloading. As soon as they are through they disappeared. I tried to do my part, but comments like yours just make one wanna go away.

Good bye, Red Dawn. Good bye, The Pirate Bay. "
,Butwheaty,2007-10-14T00:50Z,"FYI, I have uploaded 10 GB of this ... so, to call me names just doesn't make sense.  People are dl'ing, then leaving (for some reason, I don't know) ... leaving everyone all whiny and pissy.

Jesus H ... have some patience.  It's freaking over 4 GB; I will not stop seeding until I see that lots of other users are seeding."
[T],Knaster,2007-11-27T12:38Z,this one is a pure classic
,Francklin,2007-12-30T07:31Z,"Thanks, this is an awesome movie, I'm downloading it now. Is this ripped from the new collectors edition DVD or is it the old non-animorphic widescreen one? Just wondering."
