Arnold Layne had a strange hobby - collecting clothes
Moonshine, washing line
They suit him fine 

On the wall hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See thru' baby blue 

He dug it - oh Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see
Arnold Layne 

Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors clang, chain gang 

He hates it - Oh Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see
Arnold Layne
Don't do it again
