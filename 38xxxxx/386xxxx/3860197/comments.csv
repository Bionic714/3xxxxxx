This is NOT the official DVD, right?

This .ISO is a home-made thing, converted from a .wmv or .mov file..."
,torrentaddicts,2007-10-27T18:36Z,Hey is this the real DVD or is this just some converted crap?
,george_harry-son,2007-10-27T20:18Z,"I finally downloaded this file. Took a while. It is definitely not the official ISO file. But whomever made this one did a nice job on the menu. There are no extras, but the video quality looks like the highest on my tv screen. Its great until we get a hold of the official ISO."
,jhUyYds,2007-10-28T12:32Z,"As said before, this is not an official DVD rip. It's probably made from a google video. The motion is somewhat jerky, and the log of my DVD player keeps showing errors. If you want quality, I suggest you look on."
,nitehawk_,2007-10-28T17:26Z,A really capturing DVD from Alex Jones again. I love his work but I dislike what is happening to the world. I hope that the official DVD will come out here soon. I might even buy it from Alex :)

,Osaka,2007-11-01T10:43Z,"I told you guys already;

""This .ISO is a home-made thing, converted from a .wmv or .mov file...""

I could tell that without downloading it.

By.... reading the description!

But even without it it would be pretty obvious it's not the real DVD."

Actually Alex gives permission for his movies to be
 pirated at the right time. How cool is that?!?!?! 
This is NOT approved and I think pretty frigging 
rude!

Go here for the high quality (beautiful) and approved 
version:
