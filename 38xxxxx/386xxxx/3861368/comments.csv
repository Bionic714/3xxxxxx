,bobmavric,2007-10-30T18:24Z,come on guys. help file and instruction is in file. it clearly says what to do.
,bishopazrael,2007-10-30T18:26Z,"Is this set up to work straight away or do i need to patch things and compile things?

Will this go straight onto a SATA drive?"
,ivwshane,2007-10-31T04:12Z,"""come on guys. help file and instruction is in file. it clearly says what to do.""

Unfortunately according to the instructions it must be ran from with in leopard. I can't get my system to boot into leopard in the first place because I have an sse2 machine and it gets to the apple screen (gray with an apple logo) and then my machine reboots.

Whether or not its all related, I have no idea."
,tytanyum,2007-10-31T14:52Z,can i just use that file with APPLE.MAC.OSX.LEOPARD.V10.5.ISO-OSX and make a fresh install (without other os version) ?
[T],FatFreddy475,2007-10-31T16:13Z,"This is what the instruction file says:

    Mac OS X            	   2   u      ยง                                     ATTR ร   ยง   ?                     ?     com.apple.TextEncoding   MACINTOSH;0

Go figure O.o"

in your own.. know, once you've done that go and
try to stick your hand (till elbow) up your moms ASS...  BUT BEWARE! YOUR MOM SHOULD SLEEP ALREADY.. now when she wakes up getting hot, she turns in to a fairy and u have 3 wishes."
,MPG187,2008-02-05T05:19Z,Do you use the official install DVD or a modified one with this? Can someone give a link to the DVD to use?
,humanzombie,2008-03-09T14:50Z,"i know little about the mac hack discs but i do know a fair amount on installation of them, insert the disc and try to boot off it. it will ask you to press any key to do so... do it. it will then boot to the installation.. see how it goes.. your machine may not run the installation in which case you would want to restart and boot from the cd, this time hit F8 to enter some code.. then you will want to try these..

-v then press enter

of not, try

-x and press enter..

if that doesnt work try them together and add vanilla at the end.. like this

-v -x vanilla    and then press enter

that last baby got mine going. note if you have an intel chipset and graphics onboard.. intel..you probaby wont need to do any of the codes.. just run the installation... hope i have saved you time looking at endless forums!! oh but drivers you on your own im afraid :(

hugs and kisses, ;)
