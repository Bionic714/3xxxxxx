Funny cool movie just bare with the intro.



I've harcoded the subtitles to the video stream because its easier to watch that way if you don't speak both english and russian.



f.y.i. vcd isn't a common format to use anymore because svcd and xvid has taken over with superior quality. For all the new pirates out there you will require and mpeg1 codec to play these, klcodec and gordian knot codec packs still include mpeg1. Otherwise, you should be able to open it with a dvd program like power dvd. The other option is to use a burn program like nero or ashampoo movie shrink and burn 2 to create a proper disk that will play in most dvd players. Good luck and enjoy.
