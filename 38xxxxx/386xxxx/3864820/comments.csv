,kpatrick17,2008-05-28T06:19Z,"I haven't opened the file yet, but if the file fits the name it's one of the books for Dungeons and Dragons."
,laparapa,2008-06-20T15:07Z,"I'm pretty sure it's the 3.5 version of the Monster Manual from D&D. If it is, it's a list of the monsters. It'll be in a .pdf file, so it'll need something like Adobe to open."
,m0nk3yb01,2009-03-24T03:16Z,"This is, in fact, a .PDF file of the Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual, the version 3.5 core rulebook. It is a full scan of every page, including the front and back covers, everything is lined up correctly. Unfortunately, the scanning was done on a moderately weak resolution, so the images are readable, but grainy. Otherwise, a good book."
