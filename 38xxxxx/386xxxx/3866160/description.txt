This is an excellent game for the Nintendo 64 that was never released in Europe or the States, only Japan. It is a fast-paced, on-rails shooter that is great fun to play. 

Spoken language is (bad, broken and disjointed) English, and text is in Japanese. However the plot is a load of bull so I suggest you ignore it completely and just concentrate on shooting stuff. :D

This ROM has been tested by me to work with:

Project 64 (http://www.pj64-emu.com/)
1964
Surreal 64 (Xbox Nintendo 64 emulator)

Works best on Xbox as it is easier to play with a controller, but mouse and keyboard works fine too. :D

Have fun!
