What the fuck? Dimebag was a well respected guitar legend among metalheads, and a good part of the reason that Pantera became as popular as they did. He was fucking amazing, and pushed the frontiers of hard rock/metal. If you don't like him, that's fine. I don't care. However, it is extremely shitty to come to a page where a lot of Pantera/Dimebag fans are bound to come and say that he ""had it coming."" That's about as bad as telling John Lennon's wife that he deserved what he got. Fuck you, ok? You're no better than the over-conservative christians that go to porn torrents and post shit like ""This is wrong, you're going to hell."" I don't care what your idea of Dimebag is, but you have no reason and no right to come here and tell a bunch of Pantera fans that Dime ""Had it coming."" Fuck you.

Maybe someone should run up and shoot you while you're on a stage somewhere, and then we can all get online, download a torrent of some bullshit you did, and say that you had it coming, huh?"
,CheapJon,2008-01-19T20:11Z,Seed fuckers!!! :D :D
,Yattering,2008-01-22T14:08Z,Very nice! Thanks for the uploader
,kingadrock,2008-01-23T20:35Z,"""That's about as bad as telling John Lennon's wife that he deserved what he got.""

However, I would tell Yoko that SHE deserved what he got."
,robopope69,2008-02-03T02:00Z,"Could someone please make a torrent of first 4 pantera albums and the bootlegs etc.? 
i have bought the last 5 but cannot get others in store."
,Diablojoe420,2008-02-10T19:12Z,"Couldn't have said it better myself, Crimson. Take that shit elsewhere. Not only do you insult the legend, you insult everyone who downloads this torrent."
,kcsx,2008-02-23T05:57Z,"Gunman: KNOCK KNOCK

Dimebag: Who's there?

Gunman: Gunfire.

Dimebag: Gunfire Wh-

BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!

*RELOAD*

BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!"
,kcsx,2008-02-23T06:00Z,"Oh, and by the way this is wrong and you're going to Hell."
,BurnTheMasons,2008-04-06T04:43Z,"First of all dime was shot on stage doing what he loved. Second torrenting is't wrong when iTunes refuses to let you read data from your own computer, and music is overpriced. Third, take your impotent god elsewhere, starchild."
,kcsx,2008-06-01T00:06Z,"""dime died on stage doing what he loved...""

oh please, somebody cue the sappy violin music.

anyone who was offended by my remark is a butthurt fucktard. you pantera fanboys are so freaking EASY to troll. that's why i do it. it's funny to me when you crybaby pussies get together and do your little idol worship circle jerk, ranting and raving the whole time about poor old DEADbag darrell like he was your best friend in the world. it's hilarious because he didn't even know you dipshits existed and i'm sure half the lot of you would collapse on his grave sobbing like the whiny twats you are. i liked pantera too but that doesn't mean i'm gonna hop on a high horse and claim i'm above making jokes about it. so crimson_713 you can get fucked and go strait to hell and BurnTheMasons can join you right after he learns to understand the intricacies of the ""knock-knock"" joke.

,kow626,2009-04-26T10:35Z,thanks. only dl'd vulgar display but it was a hi quality rip.
,Beldin3a,2009-07-28T06:52Z,"awesome, got their third Album, with Terrence Lee as vocalist, but on a never played LP, which will lose half its value if I ever listen to it... but the three albums with Lee on vocals are out there ( on Vinyl, at least), very hard to track down though, even on E-bay or through specialised rarity shops. nice to get so much here, big thanks"
,ThePriestman,2009-09-18T05:20Z,"Okay Dimebag was epic, fuckin' epic. So I feel wrong for having laughed at Kcsx's knock-knock joke. But it was funny..."
,rk8395,2009-12-19T12:17Z,"Yup even I like Dimebag,but that joke is funny"
,booveeter,2010-05-15T00:42Z,THX!
