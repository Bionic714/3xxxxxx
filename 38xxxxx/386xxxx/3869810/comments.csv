,joni84,2007-11-05T09:18Z,"sjoswick
1. You need a wii with a chip installed. Wiikey, ect.
2. Download the game, and seed it.
3. Unpack the .rar files with winrar.
4. Burn the iso file with imgburn,cloncd ect. on a dvd-r.
5. Have fun!!"
,ozke,2007-11-05T19:14Z,But burn it at 2 - 6x speed to be safe its working

,martiniam,2007-11-10T17:01Z,Do you need to buy a WiiKey and put it inside your Wii? And do you have to download games on the internett on your Wii?
,ozke,2007-11-10T21:46Z,"martiniam:

,WeirdGuy,2007-11-23T18:07Z,What is a wiikey/''chip''?
,maddoggeli,2007-12-06T11:12Z,"The crappiest game ever. I almost died trying to play it. I LOVE Simpsons, but this game suck gigant starmole penis"
,Exceed_download_limit,2007-12-17T01:48Z,"DVD decrypter and Magic ISO don't like the ISO file? It extracted OK from the archive, though. Any ideas appreciated..."
,weejockmcpoopeeplop,2008-01-15T22:27Z,"A wiikey or a D2Ckey or even a argon chip are mod chips that you have to take your wii to bits then solder the chip in, if your wii was brought in the last 3 months then you cant fit a wiikey you have to go with one of the other chips coz nintendo have changed to pcb so wiikeys cant be fitted.
But I would strongly say to you dont try to install it yourself...pay for a pro to fit it, It's very easy to kill your wii...like I did!! 
good luck"
,weejockmcpoopeeplop,2008-01-15T22:44Z,"Exceed_download_limit 

You need to check the file and see how many KB large it is.

It should be,
4.37 GB (4,699,979,776 bytes).
Any smaller than this means that person who did the rawdump iso.file copy of the game disk did not get all the game disc and you might get problems playing or load the game?
Hope this helps"
,Hulkenboy,2008-02-08T22:48Z,Burn whit nero at 4x speed Verbatim cd.It works pretty fine for me.I have the new D2ckey!!
,Emetofili,2008-04-08T12:46Z,You really don't have to burn Wii games at 2x.. I burn them at 8x and they work great on my D2Pro chipped Pal Wii :-)
,scorpio80,2009-01-23T19:30Z,"Please, seed....."
,zarathustra2k1,2009-03-04T17:32Z,"Now you can soft-mod. Google ""twilight hack"".

I burn at full speed (16x) with Verbatim discs - never made a coaster. Tried some Memorex - they SUCKED HARD.

Thanx for the up. =]"
