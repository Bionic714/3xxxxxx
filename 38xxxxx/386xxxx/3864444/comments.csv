,Sytro,2007-11-08T00:39Z,"Hi,

Thanks for the download. I can't get it to work at all. Any advice.

Thanks in advance for the help."
,Sytro,2007-11-08T00:54Z,"I guess I should add that I did burn the ISO to a DVD. When the disk boots up it opens what appears to be a DOS window with the following title/path (E:\setup\rsrc\autorun.exe) and I can't type anything in the window itself. 

Advice would be appreciated."

,Suppozo,2008-01-01T10:19Z,"I finally figured out what the problem is as far as the ""Insert original cd/dvd problem"" goes, when you get this message, you need a no-cd crack. (with the cd, oddly enough?)"
,polacogaleto,2008-02-15T03:46Z,"I don't know why, but in my computer, quake 4 appears with problems in textures and shadows!!!! I download many versions cracked by deviance and all they have the same problem!!!!"

,redfury91,2012-04-17T22:09Z,i never could understand why people put out bits and pieces of games and just leave it up to everyone else to figure out how to slap it togehter. why doesnt everyone just put precracked games in here so everyone is happy and there will be no problems or complaints from anyone?
