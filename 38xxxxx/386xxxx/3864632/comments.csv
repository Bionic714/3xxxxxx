,Medion55,2007-10-31T23:24Z,"Its Alive!!!!



It works....."
,eturco,2007-11-01T08:05Z,"OKEY..Thank you Fairlight..This works perfectly..No problem at all!

SO I want to explain for eveybody what I did so they can do the same thing and play!!!...

READ-------------------------------------------

1- After downloading, go find where your files are downloaded. They will not have .RAR symbols and they wont look like openable!!..NO PROBLEM!

2. Go to WINRAR...Then find the downloaded files and then click the first file in the downloaded fifa list..ONLY THE FIRST FILE that says 1 at the end...And extract it!..Just extract it...

3. WINRAR will extract all of them automatically to the same folder.

4- So after extracting it, click the new folder that is extracted. It will have a .iso(image file) waiting for you....Just mount that with a mounting tool..(I strongly suggest you to install Virtual Clone Drive Mounting tool..That is the easiest..You just install the program and it automatically sees all the image, ,iso files...So in this case if you have that mounting tool installed then you can just click the .iso file and it will start the AUTORUN.exe and you will have to enter your serial..Serial works....It will install the game..

5- Now click your mounted drive(to view files) then you will see a folder named FAIRLIGHT!..This will have the crack exe you need...

6. copy&paste it to your installed fifia manager 08 files.


READY TO PLAY!"
,dsedean,2007-11-01T08:56Z,great for me the iso is currupt wat a load of good that was so sum1 is trying to stop us from playing it

You have to replace the exe with the exe in your FIFA folder (C:\program files\ea sports\fifa 08\)... If it's still not working try: http://gbw.naxphost3.com/files/FIFAManager08v1.0NoDVDFixedexeEng.rar"
