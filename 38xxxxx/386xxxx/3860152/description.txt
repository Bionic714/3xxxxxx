Not the best divx conversion ever - definately not great quality rip.
Give me a break thou, it's not the best adaptation of Vonnegut either, nor is it the best movie you've ever seen. 
But tt's still worth seeing whether for Willis or Vonnegut (Vonnegut for me).

Keep it alive. I'll give a good start.
