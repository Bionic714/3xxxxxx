Info/Comments:

I finally got tired of not being able to find a decent and complete version of this album online, so I caved in and bought a vinyl copy from eBay (it cost a pretty penny, as it was (a) still sealed and (b) a red, transparent vinyl).  This is a recording of the very first playthrough of the vinyl.  It was 'ripped' using a new Teac P-595 turntable with an Audio Technica cartridge and a relatively new stylus.  There is some slight distortion in places, but other vinyl rips of this album I've come across online have similar flaws, so I think it may have been a pressing error.  

The recording was processed with a VERY small amount of noise reduction, mainly in the track gaps.  As well, a few of the more noticable ticks where manually removed.  Apart from that, it's true to the original vinyl.  

Enjoy this rare album!
