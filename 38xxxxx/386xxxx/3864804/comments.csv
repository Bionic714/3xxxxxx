,pvfced,2008-11-22T22:35Z,"Not many people give you good comments but this is a brilliant upload. The code works brilliantly. The code is WBBS-UCHF-UBBLG 

You will need this when you open Virtual DJ for the first time. It will ask you to enter the serial number.

You can find the code in the file ""Serial"".

Thanks for providing a great upload. pvfced."
