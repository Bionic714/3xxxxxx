There is a 2 min. gap somewhere due to a power failure, if I remember right,
it was somewhere during Lust Stings, but I\'m not sure.

If you try to convert this ASF file to a better quality, do not waste the time
unless you want to re-sync the audio. It becomes terribly out of sync due to
the crappy WM3 format it was broadcasted in. If someone manages to accomplish 
this please e-mail me.
