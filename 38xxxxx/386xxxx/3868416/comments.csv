,semontrax,2012-02-16T10:33Z,"Though I'm also stuck at 98.8, I can still play the film (it probably skips a bit though). I've been unable to find any other English copies that actually properly download at all (torrent or otherwise) so a reseed would be very welcome."
,semontrax,2012-02-16T14:09Z,"This works fine even at 98.8% complete. I just finished watching it and the film skips 5-6 times throughout, but it doesn't actually skip over anything that makes any difference to the story or the scene, and the longest skip is only about 1 second or so long. "
