,voltage526,2008-06-08T08:40Z,"For everyone who experiences sped up gameplay in windowed mode :This game is virtually impossible to play in windowed mode on any system with a CPU faster than 350 MHz, because the game does not have proper speed-limiting routines in this mode. However, the timings used by the game are based on the monitor's refresh rate. Switching the game to fullscreen mode lets the game play properly, no matter what your system speed is. In windowed mode, the game can be played at the correct speed whenever the screen refresh rate is at 60Hz."
,Ghostknight1,2008-06-27T01:59Z,SEED pls i wana play it as soon possible !!! ty for those who is seeding  
,Sudoku123,2008-07-03T03:06Z,"I know this probably sounds ridiculous, but I really can't figure how to ""mount"" this and run.  I've got Daemon Tools and I've unzipped the games but I can't find which file to mount.  Any tutorials out there or advice?

Aside from my trouble with it, the download speed was incredible and I can't wait to get this working (whenever I move past the ""insert disk"" window)"
,89ana007,2009-01-24T16:04Z,can someone please seed this ? :) 
,theforeigner117,2009-05-05T19:11Z,if you're game is running SUPER FAST run it in full screen
,ThatOneGuyThere,2011-02-20T23:31Z,"For those who cannot mount;
1.Mount the .rar file
2.When a folder opens click ""Launch.exe""
3.When that loads click ""Continue"" and then ""Install""
4.Follow the screen and enjoy playing."
,ThatOneGuyThere,2011-02-20T23:39Z,"When I run the game,it automatically goes to windowed mode,then I go to options and try to full screen it,when it begins to go,it crashes saying something like ""SetDisplayMode 320,240,8
HRESULT:=80004001"" any clue as a way to fix this?"
,BrainEater12,2011-06-20T10:10Z,"This is bull, the game wont slow down in fullscreen mode and i can't get any music."
,JuCstin,2012-01-04T20:19Z,"uh... the game runs at 1000 fps and I can't get it to play at 60 fps, and therefore is so fast that I cannot play it, any help?"
,Futurella,2012-03-22T10:21Z,"LOOK HERE IF YOU HAVE SPEED PROBLEMS WITH GAME!

If the game is going too fast, use this patch: http://info.sonicretro.org/File:S3kpatch.7z"
,theclaw1,2012-06-18T09:25Z,"""SetDisplayMode 320,240,8
HRESULT:=80004001"" happens when full screen fails to set mode to 320x240 with 8bit color. Nvidia users can restore that as a custom resolution. I don't know about other graphics cards."
