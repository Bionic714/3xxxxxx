PS: You're welcome."
,Rivenshield,2007-10-30T03:52Z,"Feh. I forgot to list the albums. In order, they are:

-Elizabethan Consort Music
-Ladyes Delight (Entertainment Music of Elizabethan England)
-Robin Hood (Elizabethan Ballad Settings)
-The Art Of The Bawdy Song
-Tudor Organ Music
-Watkins Ale: Music Of The English Renaissance

I ought to be industrious and go look up the artists, but I am feeling lazy. So I shan't. You can find them on Amazon.com easily enough.  :)"

,Rivenshield,2008-11-22T07:33Z,"Hey! Marcosmo! If you ever come back and read this... I've been a history geek since I was a kid. Read every book on every culture I can get my hands on. Then the Internet came along and Amazon.com allowed me to listen to the music that went with the cultures I was reading about. That's all. Go there and search for 'Ancient Greek', 'Ancient Roman,' 'Medieval,' etc. Be patient and look for bargains in the used section, and feel free to order $5-$7 CD's on a whim, and every other one will be good. And every fifth one you you fall in love with.

And then someday, the sense of whimsy will strike you to share all your hard-found bounty with everyone else....   ;)"
,kolokythis,2008-12-21T19:23Z,I love the way you think and feel Rivenshield.
,Thalinor,2009-02-11T04:18Z,"Note to people who are thinking about DL thir or any other torrents by ths guy; he does not include complete albums.  Every album is missing half the tracks.  I have no idea why he is being such an ass.  By his own words these are out of print and impossible to find music, its not like you are going to be saving some record co money.  This guy is just some small cock asshole on a power trip trying to feel special by holding half albums over peoples heads.

The worst part is you dont tell people in the ""about this torrent"" you are missing half the files.  If this was by accident (or its all you have) I would understand but its just you being a cock sucker."
