Welcome to another high quality musical torrent from Rivenshield! (/bows). I couldn't get back from watching Elizabeth: The Golden Age and not scratch the musical itch, and I presumed there must be many who felt the same. So here you are. All are high-quality Windows Lossless rips, complete with cover art.

HOWEVER....

I am only including every *other* track (and a few personal favorites in between, for lo! I am generous). So if you want to hear more, go directly to Amazon.com and support the artists by buying the CD!
