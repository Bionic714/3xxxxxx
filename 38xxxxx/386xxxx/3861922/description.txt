REVIEW / DESCRIPTION
--------------------
 Patrick Oâ??Hearnâ??s musical path has lead him through his many inspired eras â?? 
 bassist for Frank Zappa, The Bay Area jazz scene of the mid 70s, the ensemble 
 Group 87, and the new-wave band, Missing Persons. But, his latest inspiration 
 was a chance encounter with a vintage 1937 electric Hawaiian guitar that shaped 
 his new solo album, Glaciation.

 Oâ??Hearn, who had been working in his Nashville home studio toward the 
 completion of an all-together different album, scrapped the yearâ??s worth of 
 work to meld the distinct character of his newest instrument to a host of other 
 partners. Working from instinct, he caught a wave -- and brought aboard an 18th 
 century acoustic bass, an Analogue Modular Synthesizer, fretless bass, piano, 
 electric guitars and assorted vintage studio gear (EQs, Filters and Signal 
 Processors) -- to record Glaciation in chronological sequence.

 "Just why a Hawaiian guitar would act as catalyst to conjure up striking 
 images of the arctic did not occur to me at first. It wasn't until well into 
 making the record that I stopped to consider the irony: it made sense".

 Glaciation continues Oâ??Hearnâ??s path of evoking the sensations of different 
 atmospheres through beautifully textured sounds. His last two albums Beautiful 
 World and Slow Time painted different surroundings than Glaciationâ??s arctic 
 beauty. The first illustrates the extraordinary beauty of the natural world, 
 while the second revels in thoughtfully conjuring the passage of time. Slow 
 Time also marked a departure for O'Hearn, in that he ventured into the 
 experimental realm characterized by musical movements of the 20th century.
