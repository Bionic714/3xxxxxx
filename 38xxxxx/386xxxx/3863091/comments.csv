,kkkhiran,2008-12-03T21:00Z,don't know if its the real deal or what but its got 638 pages...just for the kind info of anybody wishing to download this book....
,nasapunk88,2009-07-27T08:49Z,"Sofar this is the best one ive found. Imo its easier to read, Doubled Spaced, more formatted with page numbers and titles on each page. Most others were single spaced and just very basic (those are good if u want a short small pdf with only 400pages vs this 1 with 600+)"
,nasapunk88,2009-07-27T08:50Z,also compared it to the official book word for word randomly and it was exact on words/paragraphs/format

,izzabellezi,2010-12-03T18:27Z,"Loving the format of this, really neat & looks awesome! This is totally real, the whole scar thing is not true, the last word is 'well'!
The layout just looks really nice & it's properly numbered!"
