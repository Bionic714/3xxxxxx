,arcticblue2,2007-10-29T16:02Z,Alot of people are having trouble with InDesign.  I'm working on a brand new patch for it and I'll upload it as soon as it's done.
,Apple_freak,2007-10-29T16:11Z,"THX arcticblue2. 

That will be greatly appreciated. Hero! :-)

,arcticblue2,2007-10-29T19:41Z,"I did some research in to the problem with InDesign.  Unfortunately, even legit copies are having trouble running on Leopard.  The whole time the Leopard beta was out, Adobe's developers sat on their fat asses and never bothered to check compatibility.  Adobe claims ID works with Leopard, but judging by the amount of posts on several Mac forums, this is not the case.

I will keep looking for a solution, but at the moment, there doesn't seem to be much I can do until Adobe releases a patch.  Sorry if this is a big problem for anyone.  Just be glad you didn't pay for CS3 :P"
,bradfantin,2007-10-29T20:28Z,THANK YOU! i thought it would take like weeks untill there was a leopard crack for Cs3. NICE
,Apple_freak,2007-10-29T21:38Z,I also visited a lot of Mac-sites and can confirm it hasn't anything to do with legal/illegal. But I think it's something with the 1.0 version of it. I tried to apply the offical patch from Adobe (50mb) and it doesnt install.

,BumRussh,2007-10-30T11:44Z,There is one way to get the current cracked version of Adobe CS3 Design Suite Premium working under Leopard.  But I got-a warn ya...its a pain in the ass. so here it is.  Go back and reinstall Tiger.  Then Install CS3 under Tiger and use the crack then upgrade to leopard.  It worked for me I hope it works for you.  Or else we can wait for our genius hackers to update the crack.
,arcticblue2,2007-10-30T13:43Z,"BumRussh,
Um, I don't know if you noticed, but these cracks are updated for Leopard.  There is no need to copy from a Tiger install.  The only part of the suite that has an issue is InDesign and that is a problem at Adobe's end.  Many people with legit copies are having trouble running InDesign on Leopard too."

Get ahold of a copy of CS3 Master Collection as it was released later and contains final versions of everything. The CS3 Design Premium cracks work on the Master Collection versions I tried, they just don't cover all the apps (naturally).

,uppersole,2008-01-15T11:47Z,"Hey All,
Lot of comments from both sides of the fence figured I'd post my two bits with my experience. 

First off for reference my computer is a G4 Powerbook and is running Leopard 

I've currently managed to get this crack to work with Photoshop, Illustrator & Acrobat (Thanks Arcticblue) However with the rest of the software i.e. InDesign, Flash & Dreamweaver, no luck. 

When I run the patch on the problem apps all of which ask for permissions, I find that shortly after granting permissions the following error comes up.

Applications/Adobe InDesign CS3/Adobe InDesignCS3.app/Contents/MacOS/PublicLib.dylib

I'm assuming this means I have the wrong version for the crack? When other people speak of having issues using this crack is this what they are seeing or is my issue unique. 

Any information would be really appreciated!"

,vslink,2008-03-05T23:43Z,"I can only speak for Ps, as I have no interest in the other Design Suite components at this time.

The trial download from the Adobe site is for version 10.0 and the dmg file is dated 23 March 2007. After installation ArcticBlue's patch works perfectly--be sure to patch the Adobe Photoshop CS3.app file which is INSIDE the folder of the same name. The default install path is /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS3/Adobe Photoshop CS3.app. If you aren't sure which is which enable your Mac in System preferences to always display file extensions. I suspect that some people are trying to patch the folder and not the executable file inside the folder.

There is an update to 10.0.1. Do not install it, as the patch does not work on it. Perhaps arcticblue will one day revise his patch to accomodate the update, but at this the existing file only works on present build downloadable from Adobe.

The good news is that the Camera Raw 4.3 update can be downloaded and it works just fine.

This patch is a very helpful contribution to the community and I am very grateful for arcticblue's efforts. I cringe when I read people whining that it won't work for them and blame the file rather than something they did. This stuff is offered to us free, and I think some gratitude, patience, and willingness to learn is in order."

2. so a while ago i downloaded the trial and i used it for 30 days and let it run out because i was to lazy to find a good patch. i used the key from serial box which SUPPOSEDLY was a non-activation key (the key worked but it still makes me activate before i can use the program)
NO MATTER HOW MUCH i delete photoshop CS3 and search the spotlight for all remnants of the program to delete. whenever i install photoshop, i'm stuck at the ""your trial is finished, please activate""

i have tried that over and over again.
what happens is:
it patches successfully, but then i open photoshop (and it appears to work fine) then i try actually DOING something with it and then i get a error and photoshop closes. this didn't happen when i had the trial for 30 days. and i think the problem has something to do with trying to crack the program AFTER the 30 days trial when i should have probably done it BEFORE the trial expired when the program was fully functioning.
that is why i want to reset the trial so i can have another chance to do so :(
any suggestions?"

You are really Genius, this Crack Application worked like a Magic Charm. I have been trying since for long time with other Key gen's but dint work.

Advice:
People who are struggling to activate/crack after trial period. My advice please uninstall/Delete the application and download the trial version/ re-install again. 
Then use this Crack Application with out opening the CS3 softwares, just Drag & Drop the individual CS3 software into Crack application.

It will automatically cracks the software.

Thanks =]"
,khelmos,2008-08-31T17:31Z,"after trial period, photoshop told me to activate again. Pach doesn't work for me. Maybe it can be cause of Spanish languaje. I don't know. Congratulations who could get it work, and good luck for the rest in the same circunstances like me. "
,murcuri,2008-08-31T21:37Z,"Guys, this DOES work (and swimmingly, too!)

Unzip the file (it doesn't matter where). Open the unzipped contents. A window will appear telling you to drag the application file into that window. Go to Applications > Adobe Photosohp CS3 (or whatever you're trying to crack) and drag the program's file (in this case, ""Adobe Photoshop CS3"") into the crack file's window where it says do drag and drop it. The program file will not be moved, it will be patched. This will take a little while but eventually the crack window will say ""_____ has been successfully patched"" and you will no longer have the trial version restriction.

IT WORKS!"

,victor277,2008-09-09T04:53Z,"Dude I really appreciate it, it does work people!!! Here look once you download the crack make sure to unzip it, then a little CS# Design SUITE Banner comes out. Near the bottom you will see words labeled ""DROP ZONE"".

Step 2, After you download let's say photoshop, install it completely until it finishes. Then go to your applications folder, from there open the photoshop folder and drag the photoshop icon inside to the DROP ZONE from step 1. Wait at most 20 seconds, you will see a green comment say ""SUCCESSFULLY PATCHED"" and then ... you're set open the application and no 30 day trial window pops up!!

P.S. Make sure to remove any previous versions of things like photoshop before installing this, to do so don't just remove the folder to the trash, go to photoshop help and ""uninstall"" it'll tell you what to do to completely remove it off your computer... enjoy!!"

,david7979,2008-11-14T00:44Z,"Thanks! this crack works with Leopard and CS3!
At first, I kept getting error when apply the patch on my newly updated Leopard, just like some others (After drop the file into dropzone, it asked for password first then error popup). Here is the steps that worked for me and I hope works for you too:

1. After Photoshop CS3 installed, copy the Adobe Photoshop CS3 file (not folder) in the Application folder to Desktop
2. Open the patch and drop the Adobe Photoshop CS3 file into the dropzone (it will not ask for password anymore)
3. When done, just replace the Adobe Photoshop CS3 file in the Application folder with the one on desktop (patched)

PS this same method works with the crack for Photoshop CS4 too!!

,AlienW,2008-12-29T17:18Z,"Hi, I downloaded this patch, and opened it up, see the drop zone and thought I was home-free. Unfortunately, when I tried to drop my PS CS3 file there, it says ""you cannot apply patch to this file"", has anyone seen this before? help?

btw, anyone knows where i can find AE CS3 with crack?"
,astuanax,2009-01-05T17:57Z,I am at 99% and it seems no resources are available... can someone seed please. Thx. 
,mnkyninja,2009-01-12T20:07Z,"If your download stops at 99%, like mine did, this is how I was still able to successfully use the crack. 
(I am using LimeWire but all downloaders should contain similar folders.)

I went into the LimeWire folder then into Incomplete folder (if you're using a different downloader you might have a Download folder or Incomplete Downloads, etc.)
I located the zip file that contains the crack

NOTE:It would not unzip using the Archive Utility BUT it did unzip when I used The Unarchiver 
if you don't have The Unarchiver you can get it here http://bestmacsoftware.org/

Hopefully this works for you too!"

the version of photoshop which you have will not work with this crack. you need a different version of photoshop.

,madekn,2009-04-02T02:31Z,"Hey I've downloaded this crack and trying to patch it with CS3 I torrented from here:

Extracted that application have it on my desktop with the unzipped crack.  When I drag the CS3 icon into the drop zone, nothing happens.  No error message, but no message saying it's patched either.

Any ideas?

,adobephotoshop,2009-07-29T10:34Z,"the box that pops up when you start the program shows more icons then just photoshosp, have anyone tried them, and in case you have, does it work for them? and what program is the red filmroll (?) next to flash and acrobat?"

I have been trying for days to get some version of Photoshop to work on my computer and I just don't understand the cracks that have you type stuff into the terminal, click this, click that, do a backflip, or whatever. This is simple and quick. Thanks so much."
