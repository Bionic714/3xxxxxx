Schelmish (mischievous) was formed in 1999.  The success of the first concerts proved that the Schelms were on their way, and so a band was born, which shows its flare not only at medieval markets, banquets, and in the live role-play scene, but increasingly at their own concerts.  Not only famous in their  native Germany, the Schelms are already well known throughout Europe and are fast gaining a high reputation in the UK with many thousands of established fans. 

Their stage shows for both the rock and medieval programmes prove that they are ingenious showman and their performance includes the crowd; as much as it does entertain them.  Not all songs are taken from the traditional medieval song pool.  Schelmish have developed many original compositions to be performed with the vigorous use of bagpipe and drums; as their latter CD's prove!
