This is my first time uploading a Torrent, so please comment so I know if everything worked out ok.  I noticed there was a request for an uncompressed AVI file on one of the other torrents.  So I decided instead of leeching off others all the time, I would upload the same file I uncompressed from another torrent then seed It as well.  I've renamed the file-

"Dexter - 2x05 - The Dark Defender.avi"

-According to its TV listing.   At: 

"http://www.tv.com/dexter/show/62683/episode_listings.html?season=2&tag=nav_bar;2"

I will seed it for the next five days, so again please comment.  If everything works out well.  I will seed it longer, and make more torrents.
