,scary_mary_666,2007-10-30T18:59Z,Great! Fast! No Problems. Thank you!
,hot_soup,2007-11-10T23:39Z,"Thank you sooo much for uploading it in .avi instead of rar file!! 
I hate rar files, they take up double the space to seed and watch.  I usually have to delete the rar after extracting and don't seed at all.  And no, I can't ""just get a bigger hard drive,"" I'm not made of money."
,wickedsickmand,2007-11-13T22:48Z,"fucking A! hot_soup, that's a 100% ace comment.  MORE AVI'S PLEASE, RARS ARE DIFFICULT TO SEED AND JUST A PILE OF SHITE!!"
,tribechic,2007-12-16T21:09Z,"thanx for making this so easy! (i dont have time to deal with rars)
my only request is can you upload the entire season2 of dexter?.....the only torrents i can find of the first half of this season are in rar :(

You would really be my hero if you could upload season2 as a whole (all twelve episodes in one torrent).Again, much thanks for your effort!
~Sorry for all the requests~

I'll leave a comment on the quality after checking it out.  :)"
,LezDawson,2008-10-05T11:25Z,"Actually, forget it.  This is going so slowly it'll be literally ten years before I get it.  I'm downloading from an alternative torrent.  Waste of time this one.  The lone seeder should let this one die now, it has outlived its usefulness."
