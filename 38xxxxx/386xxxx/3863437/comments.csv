,anun111,2007-11-06T15:24Z,"I've never found a way to play these releases with the files straight from the disc.

PowerDVD, Media Player Classic, mplayer, none worked for me.

Anyone have a suggestion?"
,Damodred,2007-11-10T07:53Z,"anun111: Its fairly easy, however not obvious. Start PowerDVD as usual, then chose to ""open move file on hard disk drive"". Target the directory that contains both the HDDVD_TS and the eventual ADV_OBJ dir. PowerDVD will then play it normally."
,Neuromods,2008-01-29T14:33Z,"I got this working great using the Power DVD versions people say to use on here. However, DO NOT just drag and drop the files into Power DVD.. This will not work. Instead click on Open Files from HDD, select the folder the files are in and OK then it plays fine."
