,loched,2007-11-23T04:51Z,IS this the 3 disc version as noted in the listing or the 2 disc version ?? Perhaps I'm missing something but I see 38 files equaling 2 discs. Help is appreciated. Thanks--T.
,cloudmckane,2008-02-01T17:41Z,PLEEEAAASE!!! use a correct description when you upload! If this was a torrent-site with dignity this torrent would've been nuked...

Thanks!"
,plchiasson,2008-05-29T02:46Z,"This is gorgeous music.
Thanks.
But the file doesn't contain all of what the description outlines! There's no disc 3."
