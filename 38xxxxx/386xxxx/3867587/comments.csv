,99ramone99,2007-11-03T10:13Z,I watched the interview with a SONY BMG representative claiming Lamont's behaviour (and of course the Piratebay) is a threat to all world music. Just thinking of that interview makes me liking this music.

,TehZorroness,2007-11-20T05:01Z,"Downloading now.  I'm guessing this won't exactly be my cup of tea as far as music goes, since I listen to mostly classic rock and metal, but you have my complete respect.  Music is supposed to be about sharing your feelings with others, not charging for them.  When anyone sells their music as intellectual property, I question the true motivation of the point it trys to get across."
,TehZorroness,2007-11-20T08:30Z,"Hey, it's not too bad.  :)"
