Hi Everyone.

I thought Id help out, I've made this tutorial along with my own experience. It's my first xbox360 tutorial, so give me a break if anything is wrong. IF you find mistakes, make sure you let me know so I can fix them. Software is also included. My tutorial has screen shots and some humor. So I hope you like it and again, let me know if you find any errors so I can perfect it for other people that come along.

This tutorial basically explains step-by-step on how to backup your original xbox360 discs/games to your hard drive then burn them back onto a DVD DL. NOTE: YOU MUST OWN THE ORIGINAL GAME AND IN ORDER TO TEST/PLAY THE BACKUPS, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR XBOX360 MODIFIED.

Also included in this tutorial is a "how to connect your xbox360 to your wireless network without the Microsoft network adapter" I brought this dumb tutorial from eBay for $2 AUD, so I ripped it and made my own. F**CK YOU EBAY SELLER
