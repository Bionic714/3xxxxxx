[T],wormman,2007-10-31T22:48Z,Thank's i will help you with 500kb/s
[T],kef71,2007-11-01T08:36Z,"benny_hill: Yes, I'm seeding the right disc's for sure. Thanks for trying to help. I haven't got a clue why the other disc won't match since I also used dvd decrypter 3.5.4.0 for ripping. Maybe a different pressing or something? Wierd..."
[T],kef71,2007-11-01T19:47Z,"benny_hill: Thanks for this time, see you at the next round. Cheers!"
[T],kef71,2007-11-02T13:26Z,"benny_hill: I think I figured out why you couldn't fit your copies to help seeding. You where using the default settings in DVDDecrypter when you where ripping the images, right? Well... DVDDecrypter does not remove PUO & VOB PUB by default while AnyDVD does. PUO = Prohibited User Operations.

I changed the settings in DVDDecrypter to do this for this season and I think that's why you could only help to seed about 20%...  

Everyone: Now, guys it's up to you how you want your images. I prefer to remove these silly restrictions but it also means people who already has the images won't be able to help seeding that much and it will take me a longer time to upload.

I will start seeding TNG season 2 in a few hours and for this season I will remove the PUO's. For the remaining seasons of STV & TNG, please let me know what you prefer...

[T],wormman,2007-11-03T12:02Z,"I can help you with season 3, and  I will remove the IFO & VOB PUO's if you do it."
[T],kef71,2007-11-03T16:03Z,wormman: Hey thanks! I will remove them all.
[T],wormman,2007-11-03T17:43Z,"Are you using default settings on everything else besides remove (all puo's) in ""file mode"", ""ifo mode"" and ""iso read mode"". I just want to be sure that I don't get the same problem as benny_hill."
[T],kef71,2007-11-03T20:05Z,"benny_hill: Do you remember the first season of STV? I was using AnyDVD and you where using decrypter and still you managed to seed like 50% or something?

I'm not sure but I do think this is the reason. When I switched to DVDDecrypter with default settings you where able to seed 100%. Right?

worman: I will use default settings except ""IFO mode""; ""Remove PUOs"" & ""Remove VOB PUOs"". Since I am ripping in ISO mode the ""file mode"" settings shouldn't matter."
[T],kef71,2007-11-03T20:07Z,benny_hill: Just because the covers match it doesn't mean the pressing are the same. It's likely but not impossible.
[T],kef71,2007-11-03T20:14Z,benny_hill: If you have the time we could do a test to figure this out... :)
,hasse776,2007-11-12T09:46Z,"Hey kef71.
