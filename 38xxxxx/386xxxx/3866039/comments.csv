,rickstar,2007-10-31T01:24Z,why does the rar files say arthouse and not the name of the movie?
,rickstar,2007-10-31T01:24Z,sorry i see why now its a arthouse release but would be nice to see the movie name there
,TheFirstMan,2007-11-01T19:37Z,"rickstar: As I often have to explain newbies, it's a releasegroup-release (ALLiANCE, FICO, PROMiSE, FiNALE, etc.) which put up their movie-releases mainly on FTP's, IRC and newsgroups. This is, highly likely, also where this release comes from. That's why it's zipped in 50 part, and has an ""obscure"" filename. It's standard for releasegroups: releasegroupname-movietitle or just the initials.avi = arthouse-ytl.avi

So in that sense the filename has the movie-title. There's nothing strange or obscure about this, it's standard for ""professional"" releasegroups. And it's much cooler to get files from releasegroups, because you know what you get (no fakes), great rip-qualities, and often subtitles included, and further more often really good upload-speeds!"
