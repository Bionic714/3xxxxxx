Notes:
Extreme times ask for extreme measures.
Our measure of extreme is not extremity in speed,
but extremity in art expression.
ARTHOUSE is defined:
An art film (also called an ?art cinema, ?art movie, or in the US, an "independent film" or ?art house film)
is a typically serious, noncommercial, independently made film that is aimed at a niche audience, rather than a mass audience.
Thats what we are,thats what we gonna do.
The movies we re gonna release are not STV,but FESTIVAL movies,
movies that rock the world and push the cinema art to the future.
We dont care how well they gonna getthats for merchants.
ART is NOT MONEY.
OPEN your EYES!
OPEN your EARS!
OPEN your HEARTS!
Trust us...
And leech these movies even its the last credits you have...
