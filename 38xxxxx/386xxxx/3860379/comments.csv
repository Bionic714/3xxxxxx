,Lov2xLR8,2008-11-25T02:25Z,"LaVey dont write about worshipping satan. to quote from the book: ""..the Satanist simply accepts the definition which suits him best. Man has always created his gods, rather than his gods creating him. To the Satanist ""God""...is seen as the balancing force in nature, and not as being concerned with suffering.""

The passage from which this is taken, when viewed as a whole, suggests that ""God"" is a human concept, a means of explaining that which men have been unable to explain either through ignorance or through philosophical inability to grasp the nature of reality. This passage also opens up the common Satanic maxim, ""I am my own god"", a statement of self-aggrandizement, viewed as a positive trait by Satanists.

This meaning ""Satanism"" is closer to ateism/humanism than actually hailing Satan. 
lol :D "
