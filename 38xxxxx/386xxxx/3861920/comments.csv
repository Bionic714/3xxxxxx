,Demien,2007-11-09T17:18Z,"Thanks!!!
This torrent works fine
and it's checked with
AVG antivirus and antispy.
There was now virus or spyware was
found.
The Keygen works and the torrent doesn't
take long time to download.

,leviticuz,2007-11-12T23:05Z,"LMAO, I lost this so I gotta download my own torrent :))"
,leviticuz,2007-11-12T23:06Z,"at 150kb + a sec, thanx guys for seeding this gem!"
,cybercitizen,2007-12-06T11:41Z,Thanks for this torrent leviticuz!
,inoneear,2007-12-09T14:46Z,thanks leviticuz!
,leviticuz,2008-01-04T07:20Z,Thanx for downloading and seeding ;)
,jrbobdobbs,2008-01-12T07:12Z,AVG says the keygen is a trojan ... PSW.Generic5.AFKF
,leviticuz,2008-01-30T10:57Z,"Unfortunately this has been downloading over 500 times and you are the only one to comment about a trojan in the keygen?

I quick google lookup on the trojan name didn't even give results FROM AVG.

(http://www.google.com/search?q=PSW.Generic5.AFKF)

So in turn I call bullshit on your claim, and if you are afraid of a false positive from AVG (which blows anyway) you are more than welcome to  download a different torrent of Fireworks. No sweat off my nuts."
,leviticuz,2008-02-24T15:45Z,"Adobe will auto update fireworks, if that happens and you have zonealarm go into program control and restrict all internet access from both Adobe Updater and FNPLicensing.exe

Just a heads up."
,bleedingcunt,2008-03-19T23:38Z,"False positives are very possible, but how well do you trust a stranger uploading bootlegged software?

You shouldn't, so if ANY virus scanner picks up a possible trojan horse or the like then it probably does contain something suspicious.  My guess is that leviticuz probably inserted a modded trojan horse into the keygen binary.   

Generic's are flagged when it finds a similar signature to known malware code, but the signature isnt an exact match, so it uses generic. This particular trojan horse is on google in forums where people are trying to get help to clean the virii and th's off their comp. 

So beware of this keygen, regardless of what this leviticuz asshole and his boys might say."
,leviticuz,2008-03-25T12:48Z,"Yeah dude, I can't program to save my life but I inserted a modded trojan into the keygen binary.

I swear to god most of the people on the internet is a bunch of fucking dumbshits.

ITS A FUCKING KEYGEN, IT WILL BE FLAGGED YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKERS"
,leviticuz,2008-03-25T12:49Z,"Ohh and lol@""his boys""..."
,brandonroy,2008-05-04T08:43Z,Can't extract it.. A password would be appreciated
,leviticuz,2008-05-10T12:38Z,I do NOT password protect my .rar's. So uh yeah how can I give you something I do not possess?
,struct,2008-06-26T18:42Z,"Thanks dude!

I need this overpriced shit for my multimedia class.

Even with my student discount the suite would cost me over $300!  Duh, I'm a student, I can't afford that!  Thanks to everyone for seeding!"
,marleymon,2008-08-06T14:01Z,"This torrent works great - thanks leviticuz!
But can someone explain with more detail where to go to do this?
Adobe will auto update fireworks, if that happens and you have zonealarm go into program control and restrict all internet access from both Adobe Updater and FNPLicensing.exe"
,leviticuz,2008-09-03T03:44Z,"What I meant by that is to go into your firewall and create a application rule to deny FNPLicensing.exe access to the internet.

FNPLicensing.exe is in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Macrovison Shared\Flexnet Publisher\FNPLicensing.exe"
,darkonelh,2009-01-05T03:49Z,"anyone have some serials for this fireworks cs3?? plz :D

"
,ShadowwwLFS,2009-03-09T18:03Z,"Thanks, all I had to do after install is blocking all adobe-related in COMODO Firewall."
,ShadowwwLFS,2009-03-09T18:06Z,and Avira found nothing in it. I think that bleedingcunt is Adobe employee lol.
,-Alekz-,2009-08-16T10:59Z,"I know that MAYBE some of you are new to this ""internet"" thingy, but still some of you are such idiotic noobish dumbfucks, that you don't even know that a lot of antivirus programs will detect keygens or cracks as viruses and that goes especially for you ""bleedingcunt""...

There are three options for you:

1. Are you a fucking retard,
2. You are a goddamn employee at adobe,
3. Or... you are both!"
,thedertyone,2009-12-24T20:01Z,"Okay guys, I've been downloading for years and without any virus protection, you'll be good with this torrent!! Don't listen to idiots.  There's nothing wrong with this!  I just downloaded (at over 750kbs **SEED**) and installed.  Not detections and no problems! A note though, while installing disconnect the internet, restart as it asks, then open the program to show the registration window. Use the CLEAN keygen and select NEVER REGISTER just to be safe!!!  THEN reconnect the internet and have fun!  Trust this comment..THIS IS SAFE!"
,Koni_mike,2010-03-16T01:35Z,"it works fine, had problem at first until i noticed it wasnt for mac and i should of read it first lol, used it on my windows laptop works a treat"
,Thrashinator,2011-08-03T02:01Z,AVG won't even let me open the keygen program... should I uninstall AVG?
