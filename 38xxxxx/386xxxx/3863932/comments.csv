,bozodestructo1,2008-01-25T22:05Z,"Hey, uh, not that I'm not grateful, but this patch doesn't work for me. Is there a new version of the patch available?"
,jbean14,2008-02-26T21:18Z,I cant find anything that works with this version 10.0.1x20071012 
,Noupette,2008-03-06T19:19Z,This works brilliantly well. Thank you so much! People - just download the trial version from Abobe. Install it. Open the crack and drop Fireworks icon into the drop zone. A yellow bar appears showing that things are a-happenin'. After a very short wait you get a confirmation that the app has been patched. Heaven. I've been trying to do this for about a month with different patches etc. This one does the job. Don't worry about other versionsof Fireworks. Just get along to Adobe NOW and you'll get fixed up. 
,mwaness,2008-03-11T22:47Z,Cheers. Works like a charm.
,sharkydude,2008-03-15T00:06Z,"Well, I must be a moron. Could someone help me? I installed Fireworks CS3 version 9.0.0.1188 on my brand new MacBook running Leopard. Then I ran this crack, dragged my ""Adobe Fireworks CS3"" icon from my Applications folder onto the ""Drop Zone"", and I get an error message that says, ""You can't apply the patch on this file."" As I said, I must be a moron, but can someone help me out? Thanks!"

,brunosleft,2008-04-27T13:35Z,works like a charm thanks so much. @baha you can only use the fireworks patch for the firework application dude. You cant crack photoshop with this.

,oasis456,2008-06-18T22:43Z,What is the serial number?
,taixuong,2008-10-14T15:41Z,"Hey folks.  Pay close attention to your Adobe updater.  It has a patch updater that will render this patch useless.  I installed via the patch yesterday and it worked fine then noticed a ""patch updater"" when Adobe updater was updating some other programs.  Tried to open Fireworks after the updater was finished and received the ""You can't apply the patch on this file."" message.  I uninstalled Fireworks and reinstalled and repatched and it now works fine."
,ainos_uonairdna,2009-07-24T17:23Z,it works perfect. thank you.
