Title:		The Adventures of Mark Twain

Director:	Will Vinton

Genre:		Animation/Adventure

Plot Summary:

Based on elements from the stories of Mark Twain, this feature-length Claymation
fantasy follows the adventures of Tom Sawyer, Becky Thatcher, and Huck Finn as
they stowaway aboard the interplanetary balloon of Mark Twain. Twain, disgusted
with the Human Race, is intent upon finding Halley's Comet and crashing into it,
achieving his "destiny." It's up to Tom, Becky, and Huck to convince him that his
judgement is wrong, and that he still has much to offer humanity that might make
a difference. Their efforts aren't just charitable; if they fail, they will
share Twain's fate. Along the way, they use a magical time portal to get a
detailed overview of the Twain philosophy, observing the "historical" events
that inspired his works.
