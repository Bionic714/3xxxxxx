,joyster,2007-10-30T18:36Z,Anyone tested if it works with xbox 360-guitar in USB-port?
,pye088j,2007-10-31T20:46Z,Thanks for this one! And bsilver87 itÂ´s not a stupid question the 360 guitar uses USB connection to connect to the console and so does the Wii. Im going to download and if it works iÂ´ll let you know
,dylansaliba,2007-10-31T20:59Z,"Hey Guys,
Thanks for checkin out my stuff!!
I'm sorry about the low bandwidth...stupid f--n Comc@st HSI...I'm MAXED at 40 kB/s.  Traffic shaping BS.
I'll keep trying here."
,josundlo,2007-10-31T22:02Z,The most frequently asked question: does it work on PAL? Wiikey?
,quiet_core,2007-11-01T19:04Z,"the wii does not use a usb to plug in the controller. you plug the wiimote into the guitar and use the guitar wirelessly 

so no, there is no way you can use the xbox guitar on the wii.  the same way you can't use a xbox guitar on the ps3.  each platform has their own controllers for a reason."
,krpork,2007-11-01T20:42Z,the wii manual doesn't say anything about how to strum with the wiimote. can someone tell me how you do this? i hope it's not just common sense and i'm a dumbass.
,Master_Shake_90,2007-11-01T21:16Z,"theres no struming once u press the button thats it
anyways u can buy guitars for $60 at toysrus on the 8th"
,josundlo,2007-11-02T10:47Z,Has anyone tried this on PAL with Wiikey? Working?
,Master_Shake_90,2007-11-02T12:05Z,"quoted from somewhere else ""Burned with RegionFrii and BrickBlocker. Works perfectly on PAL Wii with Wiikey 1.9b"""
,josundlo,2007-11-02T12:13Z,"Sweet! :) ...just hopes it speeds up a little soon, stuck at 58% with 1 kb/s download speed."
,isolas,2007-11-02T12:40Z,Can i Download the game from here and buy a guitar for it in the store and make it work that way?
,dylansaliba,2007-11-02T14:05Z,"TOO MANY LEECHERS!!! UPLOAD MORE PLEASE!!!
I'm trying to seed to you guys...but I'm having a hard time here...I've almost uploaded this thing two times over now....and I still don't have anyone completed...WTF

,white_mj,2007-11-02T18:51Z,Is this compatible with the WII wireless guitar? i hope so!
,josundlo,2007-11-03T13:48Z,"Quoting Cartman, when he awaits the release of Nintendo Wii: ""Coooome oooon"" ...94.1% now, speed speed speed up!"

,storemod,2007-11-04T15:27Z,"Hey dylansaliba
I'm interested in another USA wii game, maybe you could help me find it? mail me at crash68@usa.com

thanks in advance"
,engan21,2007-11-05T16:57Z,Works great with Wiikey and PAL after using regionfrii. The game needed to make a system update. And that got me double wheater and newschannels. Anybody know how to get rid of thoose extra channels?
,dylansaliba,2007-11-08T15:01Z,"There is a FIX for the duplicate channels.  I think its on PSXscene...but you can just google ""duplicate wii channels fix""
:)
Its a pretty common problem with PAL consoles."
,kipcasper,2007-11-15T17:04Z,"Hey.
Coud anyone tell me step by step how you get this to work and my Wii?

I am a noob and have no clue at all."
,No0n3,2007-12-03T17:28Z,"You need a modchip. Use google to find out how to obtain one and install one. Then, just burn a disc of this download, and you are ready to play! :D"
,Kemjo,2008-03-31T22:12Z,"Got this problem with Imgburn trying to burn this game.

""21:52:16 Potential 'WaitImmediateIO' Deferred Error - (0/3) - Program Memory Area Is Full""

Does anyone know what the eff I'm doing wrong?"
,Kemjo,2008-03-31T22:13Z,And btw thanks alot for the upload
,dylansaliba,2009-02-23T07:09Z,"Sure thing.
PIRATE BAY RULES!!!!!!"
,Al4000,2012-03-15T01:06Z,You can Softmod your WII and Use USB loader to load the games off of your USB Stick instead of having several CDs
,Jinx_Dojo,2012-08-11T21:21Z,"Thank you for the upload.

I can confirm this works on a soft-modded Wii. It appears to be NTSC. It will work with a Wii-mote. It will not, however, work with a Gamecube controller, so I was not able to use my PS2->GC controller adapter to enable playing with a PS2 guitar.

WinRAR reports the file inside with a size of ""4699979776"", and a CRC32 of ""798A4719""."
