,JMul51,2008-01-24T21:07Z,Will not play on 60GB iPod for some reason :/.  Will play in iTunes though.  Thanks for the torrent!
,the_magician,2008-01-25T17:24Z,"The 60GB iPod video plays H.264 video up to 768 Kbps, 320 x 240, 30 frames per sec., Baseline Profile up to Level 1.3 with AAC-LC up to 160 Kbps, 48 Khz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4 and .mov file formats.
That would be why it doesn't play -- on the newer iPod video (30/80), the iPod classic, the iPod touch, and the iPhone it should play flawlessly. Sorry about that!
(On the other hand, on the iPod's small screen the video quality of this rip would be mostly extraneous -- so an encode at lower bitrate and resolution would both work and look just fine.)"
