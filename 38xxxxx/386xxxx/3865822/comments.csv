,stealnwhine,2008-02-09T13:30Z,"Yeah.  3:03:25 in a 700mb file should = shit.  But this looks surprisingly good (on a computer screen anyway), and is in sync.  416x240.  Man, this movie is far too good to compress, but if you want to be cheap, get this.

Seeing Tom Hanks outdoors pissing in pain?  Priceless
