When I released my debut album ?Traces of the past? in 1998, I did so reluctantly. even though I was proud of actually releasing an 
album all (or mostly) of my own, I still felt that some of the tracks were not as elaborate as I wanted them to be. due to the lack 
of a decent harddisk recording system, I had to live with the occasionally lengthy bits which I would have liked to shorten considerably, 
but, being unable to do that back then, I had to leave the tracks the way they were. also, I felt that some of the recordings would 
benefit enormously from some slight (ho-hum) denoising. To make it short: some people billed this album ?a classic?, something I 
don┬┤t really agree with. a debut album above average maybe, but a classic...? too many flaws and quirks to really call it ?a classic? 
but, uh well, there you go. 

When asked for a possible reissue of the album, I thought ?why not iron out all those flaws and release the album the way I 
always wanted it to be??. Thus I sat down, made many of the tracks leaner and condensed the sometimes aimless noodlings into 
tolerable length. in order to improve on the sometimes rather poor sound (again ho-hum), I remixed most of the tracks to restore 
their audio quality, using contemporary effects devices like tape echoes, spring reverbs or stereo chorus units. also, I had some 
tracks lying around in my archives which didn┬┤t make it onto the first version of ?traces? solely for space reasons. I decided 
to include them in order to make a ?director┬┤s cut? version of ?Traces of the past?. I hope you enjoy listening to these new old 
tracks as much as I enjoyed compiling and editing them. and I wouldn┬┤t mind you calling it ?a classic? now.
