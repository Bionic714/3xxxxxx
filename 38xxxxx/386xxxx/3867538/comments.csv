It has also come to my attention that many games now require a feature known as Pixel Shaders. ""Pixel Shaders"" is a technique of defining special effects on a per-pixel basis, introduced with DirectX 8 and improved in every version.

The graphics cards that support Pixel Shaders are:

- NVIDIA GeForce3 (Pixel Shader version 1.1)
- NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti (Pixel Shader version 1.3) [GeForce4 MX does not have Pixel Shaders]
- NVIDIA GeForce FX (Pixel Shader version 2.0+)
- NVIDIA GeForce 6xxx and GeForce 7xxx (Pixel Shader 3.0)
- NVIDIA GeForce 8xxx (Pixel Shader 4.0)

- ATI Radeon 8500/9000/9200/9250 (Pixel Shader 1.4)
- ATI Radeon 9500/9600/9700/9800 (Pixel Shader 2.0)
- ATI Radeon X300/X600 series (Pixel Shader 2.0)
- ATI Radeon X700/X800 (Pixel Shader 2.0+)
- ATI Radeon X1300/X1600/X1800/X1900 (Pixel Shader 3.0)
- ATI Radeon X2000 series - X2300/2600/2800 (Pixel Shader 4.0)

- Intel GMA 900/950 (Pixel Shader 2.0)
- S3 DeltaChrome, GammaChrome, Chrome series (Pixel Shader 2.0)

I hope this helps people a bit. smile.gif

*These graphics chips are seemingly not complete in the way they handle T&L, and hence have problems with some, but not all games.

i found the above, i have the x600 and does support T&L, im now trying the skullptra DL.
i C&P'd it so others can check"

To extract you need to open winrar and Just drag&drop the .001 file into the window, And extract the ISO from there, That is if you haven't already associated those extensions to be used with WinRAR, but if you have you most probably know how to do and dont need to read this =)"

You don't rename them. Just right click the flt-tshf file and open with WinRar and extract the iso. Mount it and install :-)

Just some advice, it helps to look around the comments to see if you can find the answer yourself....I didn't know how to do this either, but I looked on page 6 at coolsmith's comment, and I figured it out ;-)"

When I try to start the game, I get that momentary window, then it shuts off, and nothing happens. I've tried with the 1.1 patch, and without, also have reinstalled several times. I still can't get it working. My computer meets all the requirements so I'm not too sure what's wrong here. First time I've really been stumped! Can someone please lend me a hand here?

,TwistedInc,2007-11-14T04:45Z,"@Psyanid
See, it helps, don't it :-P

I didn't have any problems what so ever trying to install this game. This may be because I have a newer computer and a pretty good graphics card.

Here is what I did:
1.) Opened flt-tshf with WinRar and extracted the .iso file to my desktop. 

2.) Opened up Deamon tools and mounted the .iso.

3.) When to My Computer and double-clicked the mounted file and clicked install

4.) Put in the serial that was in the txt file.

5.) Downloaded the recommended update for my nVidia GeForce 8600 GTS.

6.) After instillation, I just closed the launch panel that came up. 

7.) Right clicked the mounted file and explored it. 

8.) Copied the crack from the FairLight file and pasted it into the bin folder of the game (overwrote the preexisting one)

9.) Launched the game and enjoyed it!

It's not that bad of a game too :P"
,xKoldx,2007-11-14T05:49Z,"@TwistedInc

I did the exact same thing. I even just finished redoing it just now. The same thing happened. I even tried it with Daemon Tools instead of PowerISO haha! Guess I'll keep trying, not sure what I'm gonna do though."
,epeters2,2007-11-14T06:27Z,"@ xKoldx

if you have an Nvidia card, you need the 169.04 BETA drivers to play. i had a very similar problem, but after 1.01 update and driver update, it worked fine.    

Having finished this game, it's fun, but it wasn't much of a challenge. never ran out of ammo, linear story, easy final boss. a little disappointing, but still worth a run through."
,xKoldx,2007-11-14T07:18Z,"@epeters2

I did just that, I even just finished reinstalling the drive to see if I did something wrong and went through each step. Not too sure where to go from here though. Just keep having the same problem."

,MarkoAlmelo,2007-11-14T17:12Z,"Hmm help,

I installed the game full and copy the crack to the dir directory. Then i start the game a window will show up, and disappear inmiditly.

What can i do?"
,xKoldx,2007-11-14T19:14Z,"@ MarkoAlmelo

Hi have the exact same problem and I've actually stopped trying since I've tried everything! Haha! First of all, if you haven't, read through the comments here first, your video card may either not be compatible or may just need the new drivers so be sure to update it, that fixed it for many. 

I looked on mininova at this same torrent in the comments section and someone actually got it to work and was having the same problem. He said that all he did, was install the 1.2 patch which he got from gamershell http://www.gamershell.com/download_21837.shtml
There's the link. He then just copied and pasted the original crack from this torrent over to the bin folder in the game dir. I hope this helps some people. Sadly, it didn't help me. >."

,hobblesp,2007-11-15T07:12Z,"Why are you guys even bothering with this? The COD4 rip is only 2.5 gig, and the game is about 4-5 hundred times better. This thing is a clunky portfest. Story sucks, boss battles are so lame you can pretty much die from them, and the time abilities, far from being engaging tools, are more like an easy button... an easy button that gives you hand cramps in the middle of a gun fight. Seroiusly, i wanted to do what i saw in the cool cgi teasers, but you CAN'T. you just CAN'T. It's LAME. I don't want to kill another 30 guys in slowmo. I want time controlled, map wide puzzles where you have to get the flow of time right to solve it. And i DON'T mean *spoiler* slowing down time so you can run through a wobbly pipe. That is lame. Buy a gravity gun. Its more fun.  Anyway.... yeah. "
