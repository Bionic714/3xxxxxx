,Some_body,2007-11-15T22:04Z,seed please
[T],Zyphrus,2007-11-24T20:43Z,"Seriously, thanks a lot, I love those guys (Jay and Silent Bob)."
,bigeasy_uk,2007-12-02T14:35Z,"This a great version of the film, i'll be seeding it for as long as I can, uploaded 22gb so far."
,nOmArch,2007-12-24T22:43Z,"nice to see my edits reaching a wider audience, i originally put this out on demonoid but since thats gone now thanks to the upper for getting this out there!
"
,nOmArch,2007-12-25T01:01Z,btw its 39 scenes not 40 ;)
,CheezuzKraist,2007-12-26T10:51Z,Is this as gay as the other Jay and SB -movies? I know that this isn't funny - it can't be...
,nOmArch,2008-01-02T18:19Z,"if you liked this FANEDIT then why not pop along to www.fanedit.org and see all the other lovely gems we have there.  

ethan420 it would of been nice if you could have credited me in the torrent info since i spent a lot of time on this and you really should of made clear that this is a fanedit and not something that is in anyway affiliated to the studios."
,ethan420,2008-01-28T07:18Z,nOmArch: fuck you
,jduke,2008-02-13T11:13Z,yeah fuck you wingger
,nOmArch,2008-02-24T18:50Z,"ethan420: wow you're a really polite well adjusted person aren't you.  

jduke: asking to be credited for YOUR OWN WORK is not whinging.

i edited this extended cut together myself and built and authored the dvd and then reencoded it to avi so people could have the choice of downloading 4.4Gb or 700mb.

simply asking for my name to be included on the torrent is hardly whinging now is it?
"
,ethan420,2008-02-25T11:01Z,"you deserve the ""fuck you"" for spamming with pointless comments. everyone knows you made it now. good job. you should be glad i didnt cut off the first few seconds of the movie. that is your credit. stop your whining."
,DawgLB,2008-03-14T23:47Z,"much thanks for this nomarch, the avi version on faneditdotorg has no sound, lookin foward to watching and thank you as well for upping this bastard"
,EliofJerusalem23,2008-05-16T23:44Z,STFU PPL.....................IS THIS GOOD QUALITY OR ITS A FAG AUDIO
,sambandscentralen,2008-05-27T22:15Z,"Thanks nOmArch.

And good upload, apart from it not saying it is a Fan Edit."
,reggeaman88,2008-08-16T17:53Z,"please seed its unfair. i need jay and silent bob.
torrents werent made for people to be greedy. its a share thing. come on peeps"
,VicVega,2008-09-05T11:04Z,"Wow, this ethan420 guy really is an ass."
,2V3N0M0,2008-10-22T09:58Z,is this part  or the unrated version?
,2V3N0M0,2008-10-22T09:58Z,part 2*
,xplicit___0ne,2009-10-25T09:17Z,"ok....this is a FAN MADE edit version...meaning someone added most of the deleted scenes into the actual movie...its cool but youre ok if you own the dvd already...stats below


quality=8
length=2:08:03
video=612x336
audio=130kbs"
,Toke420,2011-02-01T07:51Z,"shut the f*ck up n0mArch you attention seeking 12-year old girl... nobody gives a flying f*ck that you uploaded this, just tell us the A/V or GTFO"
,n0march,2011-07-14T22:50Z,Oh dear your stupidity is only outweighed by your inability read the English language.  If you look just a couple of posts up you'll see the specs and btw I didn't upload it here I created the extended edition originally.  
,cruse2382,2011-09-29T10:09Z,"you bunch of ungrateful dicks if it wasn't for nOmArch  you wouldn't be seeing this at all is it too much for him to ask for a little gratitude.

and as for ethan420 if your going to post someone else's work would it kill you to just put a simple credit in the info  and maybe not be such a nob when they come on and explain its there work and  that its a fan edit (you know a important bit you missed off)"
,monstermorgz,2012-05-20T16:36Z,I'll be seeding this like a mofo. Thanks for this little bundle of awesomeness! :D
