Crime Slunk Scene is the 18th full length album by Buckethead. The 4th (and so far latest) tour only CD. It was originally only sold on his 2006 tour, but was later made available on Travis Dickerson's record label TDRSmusic, until it eventually went out of print.

The demand for the album was still very high, and eventually Travis Dickerson decided to attempt a re-pressing of the disc. However, as future projects took up a lot of time, fans were asked to pre-order the re-pressing of Crime Slunk Scene, with no set date for when the album would be released. When the pre-orders got to a certain amount, the re-pressing of the album was OK'd.

Dickerson has also stated that there could be future reissues of other Buckethead discs using this same process.
