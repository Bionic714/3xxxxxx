Jiddu Krishnamurti is one of the most significant and profound thinker of the twentieth century. The world is full of 'spiritual' nonsense, and Krishnamurti speaks to us in a most intelligent, relevant and deeper way. This series of 6 talks, titled "Exploring the Essence of Love", was recorded in Ojai, California in 1982. Each talk is a little over an hour.  If you are already familiar with Krishnamurti's work you won't be surprised by the quality of the content. 

These are the same talks as the videos floating around @ 3.9GB. However people with a low internet bandwith may be having a tough time with the large download so here's the audio-only version at less than 1/10th the size. The quality is 96-128 Kbps, which is perfectly adequate for these talks.
