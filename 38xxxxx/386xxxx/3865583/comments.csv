,c72k72,2007-10-30T19:33Z,What version does it support? Version 2 or 3?
,downloadman911,2007-12-30T20:20Z,does this work with version 3 for mac?
,morrison0880,2008-10-23T16:19Z,"This torrent is fantastic!  No installation, no extracting and matching up files.  Just download and mount to virtual drive or burn using PowerISO or Alcohol.  Awesome!  Let's get the seeds up on this guys!!!  If you download, make sure you are seeding this."
,morrison0880,2008-10-25T21:34Z,"For anyone wondering, this IS the torrent I recommended on the Mininova torrent site."
,morrison0880,2008-10-25T22:09Z,"For those who have asked, here are the instructions.  Very simple.
You will see that the file is in ISO format. You don't have to install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E], [F], [G], etc. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new [E] drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go."
,eaglenest608,2008-11-01T01:59Z,This torrent is perfect.  Just as stated in the comments.  Definitely seeding this as it is well worth it!  Thanks to morrison0880 for taking the time to make it so easy for us to use!!!
,morrison0880,2008-11-01T03:42Z,"Thank you for the comment eaglenest608.  I am glad that people are finally downloading this, instead of struggling through the other torrents out there."
,Phirus08,2008-11-01T21:40Z,Cant open sounds -.-
,santol,2008-11-04T01:59Z,"Hey its great thanks for the torrent. Just one prob I have is that there is no text or word association for the Japanese part at least. Is there any why to know what words I'm learning, lol??? I downloaded poweriso free version from cnet and just wondering. Any help would be great. Thanks again...."
,cheeto24,2008-11-04T02:17Z,"Ok, I've been looking at this software for quite some time, and I've already started downloading.  My question is regarding some of these comments on here... people asking about version 2 or version 3, and what it supports.  Do I need to install anything else before this, or is this a stand alone?  and don't worry, i don't need any specific instructions... working with iso's is easy enuf for me... big ups to AKLowther for this."
,morrison0880,2008-11-04T17:04Z,"Hey santol.  When you choose a language to learn, everything will be in that language.  You learn from associating the words you hear with the pictures shown, no by learning direct translations word for word.  That is how RS works.
cheeto24 - there are two versions of RS, 2 and 3.  This is version 2.  No, you do not have to download ANY other software, as this is completely self-contained.  A lot of other torrents are just language files, so you need the RS applications installed, and depending on the version you have, 2 or 3, you need to make sure that the language packs and the application software are compatible.  Don't worry about any of the first couple comments.  This torrent requires no installation, and no further software downloads.  You simply download the program and run it.  It's that simple."
,jbergh,2008-11-05T00:24Z,"Just Curious, Downloading and as its an ISO which Languages and Levels?
I cant wait to check this out Thanks!"
,spb329,2008-11-05T16:40Z,I just downloaded and burned the torrent onto a CD. I'm really computer illiterate so I was hoping someone could help me! I already have Rosetta Stone v3 on my computer and it doesn't recognize the CD when I try to add a language. Am I doing something wrong? Or does this only work with V2? Thanks!!
,morrison0880,2008-11-05T18:11Z,"spb329 - Read the posts above.  This is NOT a simple language file.  It is all-inclusive, meaning that when you mount or burn the program and run it, it opens up RS with every language from v2.  YOU DO NOT INSTALL ANYTHING!!!  Just autorun the program and it will bring up the RS program with every language."

,morrison0880,2008-11-15T18:56Z,"AJslayer / kornivore...don't know what your problems are.  The torrent is spotless, so it must have something to do with your computer.  Keep trying to figure it out.  I'm sure you'll get it eventually."
,Mallezz,2008-11-16T23:38Z,How can I get this in Serbian? Would really apreciate some help :) thanks!
,dublinersss,2008-11-18T11:35Z,"well.. i still couldn't figure out about my problem. why do i get this error message saying the program is not licensed on my system? i tried vista, but still doesn't work.. it seems like nobody else but me has this problem. i'm really clueless. please guys, i need help.. any idea?"
,morrison0880,2008-11-19T02:37Z,"Mallezz - do some f'n research dude.  Rosetta Stone doesn't offer Serbian dipsh*t.

dublinersss - I have no idea why you are having a problem.  Are you trying to install RS onto your computer?  Understand that this torrent is one self-contained program.  You DO NOT install anything!!!  When you autorun the program, it doesn't start the RS software, but runs the program that contains the RS.  RS is embedded into this program, along with all the help pdf files and the bonus Talk Now software.  I don't know if Vista affects it differently, but I don't see why it would.  Once again, here is how you can run it.
When you download the torrent it appears as an iso image file.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO EXTRACT ANYTHING FROM THIS!!!  You have two options.  First, get PowerIso.  This program allows you to mount the RS iso image to a virtual drive, meaning that it will appear that there is another rom drive on your computer, and the mounted RS iso image is an actual dvd inside this drive.  You can find directions on how to do this in my previous posts, but it is ridiculously simple.  Then, simply go into My Computer and look for the virtual drive with the RS iso image mounted ((G:), (H:), etc.).  Right-click on the drive and select autorun or autoplay.  Don't double-click it or Explore it.  This will run the program that contains RS.  The screen that appears should be orange and yellow with the initials Jtb in the upper left-hand corner.  Choose Rosetta Stone and off you go.
You can also use PowerIso to burn an actual disc of the program.  Click on the Add icon and choose the RS iso image.  Then just click burn.  Be aware that you will need a dvd writable disc due to the size of the file.  Then insert the burned disc, go into My Computer, and autorun / autoplay the disc.  
Hope this helps.  If it doesn't, I guess you're out of luck."
,22milan,2008-11-19T17:55Z,Thank you AKLowther and morrison0880 for the torrent and info.  It took a little over 2 days to download but it's definitely worth it.  I've skimmed through a couple of the languages and they work great.  PowerISO was an easy and quick download so again thanks for the advice.  I'm a big-time nube to this whole torrent thing but I want to keep the file available for others as long as I can.  Right now the status reads 'seeding' so I hope I am doing what is expected from the community.  Laters...

Also, there is an info file that you can see when you open it up in PowerIso.  You and the rest of the retards who just post stupid shit and don't look into torrents drive me fuckin crazy.
This torrent is spotless and works perfectly, if you follow morrison's instructions, which are sooooo simple.  Don't pay attention to fucktards like Momlolo and Mallezz...they have absolutely no clue.  Do what morrison says and you will have every rosetta language in one simple program.
Big ups to morrison for this.  Download and SEED people!!!"

,LOKI_LOKI,2008-12-04T16:19Z,"morrison0880,
You really should learn to be more polite.  Yes there are people who make stupid mistakes and don't read the posts but that's no excuse for the attitude you are giving them.  Remember that on here, English isn't everyone's first language.  Have some patience and be more kind.  You might just find that it pays off in the end."
,bit_bomber,2008-12-05T04:57Z,"LOKI.  How can you lecture morrison0880 on his manners.  His instructions were perfect and if you read the posts from thread 1, he helped pretty much everyone with their problems.  I don't blame him for getting peeved at some of the idiotic posts on here.  I for one get annoyed when I see people post that there are viruses when there aren't, or when they ask stupid questions without even looking into the torrent, or when they can't follow complete and simple directions even a two year old could follow.  
Oh, and I never knew that people who can't follow directions can't speak English.  Stupid comment.
This torrent is the sh*t.  Pretty much one of the best torrents I've ever come across.  Cheers to morrison.  Great job man."
,morrison0880,2008-12-06T06:00Z,"You may be right Loki.  I think I was a bit frustrated with people posting ignorant posts, or NullBreak saying that there is a virus.  A few of us have put a lot into bringing this torrent back to life and keeping it going, so yeah, I may have been a bit touchy.  
Hopefully everyone is getting this up and running.  It is EXTREMELY simple, which is why the torrent is so good.  If anyone is having problems, post exactly what happens here and I will see if I can find a solution.  But before you post, go back and read the posts from page one and two.  If you follow the instructions I put in there, it should work.
Again, thanks to everyone who has dl'd and is seeding.  Let's keep it growing."
,Kadagan,2008-12-08T00:57Z,"Seeds please! Having a bit of a Chinese emergency.

Thanx"
,nandy_temp,2008-12-09T02:25Z,"morrison0880,
I don't see a reason why you have to apologize. You are very helpful and provide all the information needed and yet we have a few people asking the same stupid questions over and over, not because English is not their first language (is not mine) but because they are lazy lards that don't want to take the time an read all the information in the torrent... Ty for all your work and kudos also to aklowther. Im downloading at up to 380kbs. Thanks! seed, seed, seed."
,ePants,2008-12-10T06:29Z,"Indeed - no apology was necessary, morrison0880.

Burning an iso is not an uncommon task when it comes to procuring media and/or software like this. 

And by posting a comment, they are proving to have an internet connection and a working keyboard, which means they should freaking google their questions before wasting other people's time.  Ignorance on the internet is simply an indicator of laziness. "
,hodad0051,2008-12-10T06:37Z,"Awesome torrent.

Thanks."
,ces_rues,2008-12-10T09:52Z,"Hey guys! Does anyone have any info on how to use this on a mac. I used to have poweriso on my pc, so I was hoping there was some equivalent. I have toast, but I don't know how to use it. 

So far, all I've been able to do is mount the file, but when I click on it I just get a bunch of .pdf, .mp3 and .exe files. 

Thanks in advance!"
,j_rat,2008-12-11T06:10Z,..wish we could get something like this for mac
,morrison0880,2008-12-11T06:15Z,"ces_rues - I'm not too sure how this would work with a mac, since I'm not too familiar with apple (except for my iPod).  By what you are saying, that when you mount the iso and you only get a bunch of files, I would try to ""autorun"" or ""autoplay"" the mounted drive, not open it.  With a PC, if you open the drive you get a similar bunch of files, which is why you need to right-click and choose autoplay.  Not too sure if a mac works the same way, but give it a try.  

Thanks for all the support guys.  And keep up on the seeding so we can get epants all set, so he doesn't have to blow his savings on travel.  "
,Luciuswuff,2008-12-11T13:29Z,"Hey, I'm on a mac as well, and I don't really know how to make this work. I don't have it yet, but I am trying to download it. I did manage to download the rosetta application before, and a latin ISO. (I want to learn latin, that's why I'm downloading this) I don't know if I burned it right, using my mac, maybe I didn't put the ISO on the disc correctly, but my rosetta application wouldn't recognize it. I'll look it up and see, but macbook burners tend to not read CD-Rs well for some reason. I may have to do this on a PC somehow... Anyway, I don't mean to be a burden and bother people, I'm going to google and look around for tips."
,Kashew201,2008-12-11T18:25Z,Please Seed this file 
,morrison0880,2008-12-12T04:14Z,"Luciuswuff...again, read the previous posts.  This is NOT a simple language pack file.  You do not use this with a RS application file!  It is all inclusive software, meaning that when you burn or mount the ISO, it runs a program that includes the Rosetta Stone.  The application, languages, help files, etc, are all included in this torrent.  Do yourself a favor; delete the RS application file that you have, and simply autorun this torrent when it is complete.  You will be pleasantly surprised."
,Focus88,2008-12-17T22:29Z,"Thanks for this one! I love language and are hoping to learn several. With this, I will problely not even have to go to the liberary. =) And about the english: I have not english as first language but I often understand what is going on. I use the almost bulletproof method of learning by trying. With PB, it is a chep and good method. Remember that some people is not that good with computers and software. They simple is not interested in it and are cursing laud when the computer does not as the user belive it will."

,MuseLvr2293,2008-12-31T00:21Z,"Here's how to do this....

First download Power ISO from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4546084/PowerISO_4.3___Serial

Next open PowerISO and install using the given usernames and serials....

Then in power ISO click burn.
You need to select the downloaded torrent file wherever you have it saved.

You need at least 4GiB of free space on the writable DVD for this to work.

Burn the file to the disc, and wait. When it gets done, take out the disc from your computer. Then put it back in your computer. After that it will just open up a menu. At this menu just click Rosetta Stone."
,morrison0880,2008-12-31T04:41Z,"Hey all,
Good to see so many people getting great results with this torrent.  Again, if anyone has any basic questions, please refer to my posts on the first few pages of this thread.
c7_h8_n4_o2...I have not been able to save any progress when it comes to test scores either.  Since you do not install anything onto your computer, you have a stand-alone program that does not record any data onto your hard drive.  If it is important to you to track your progress, I suggest using a spreadsheet that you create and recording the information down after each session.
bpmmpb...I don't think you will be able to add languages to this torrent, especially if it is v3, as this is v2.  If it is v2, you may be able to insert it into the program directory by Exploring the RS file and copying it into the French language pack.  It's worth a try, so long as you.back up the original RS.  Don't want to f it up and then end up re-downloading it.  =("

,sasquatch989,2009-01-03T17:36Z,"I'm having an issue...
This came as a RaR so I had to extract it, even tho the instructions early on said to extract.

Second, I autorun and i get the JtB menu, but when I run RS, it gives me an error and tells me that blankback.dcr is not a directory.  wtf?

I tried to mount with Daemon, but I cannot find an image file anywhere in the torrent.

I'll try to burn to DVD but my patience wears thin...."
,morrison0880,2009-01-03T19:17Z,sasquatch989...this does not come as a rar.  It is an iso image.  You do not extract anything.  You simply download and mount using an iso program like PowerIso.

,genjo,2009-01-05T21:38Z,Does anyone have the Irish language ones?  It's not in ANY of the torrents I can find.  I would really appreciate it.
,morrison0880,2009-01-06T04:07Z,"Yeah, bipolar, that is the only issue with this, since it does not get installed.  But the torrent does rock, doesn't it?
sasquatch989...I really don't know what to tell you.  Do you have an ISO program installed?  I would suggest PowerIso, but it's really up to you.  Do this.  Download PowerIso and install it.  Then download this torrent.  The file should look like a gold cd in your files folder.  The all you have to do is mount the program using PowerIso, or burn it to a DVD using PowerIso.  For full instructions on how to do this, or anything else with this torrent, please refer to the first page of this thread.
genjo...for the Irish language pack, simply record yourself after a night of drinking whiskey and getting into bar brawls.  Then repeat what you heard every time you want to speak to the Irish in their native tongue.  Also, try again to be drunk when you attempt any conversation. =)"
,babblu,2009-01-06T05:37Z,"Thanks for the upload morrison. been trying to dl for awhile now and almost complete. i have a working version 3 with 11 languages and in order to get it to work, i had to commit a cardinal sin by updating it to the newest version.  it works great but i can't figure out how to crack the language packs so that i don't have to actually call it in and risk everything. i will be using your version as well for some of the langs and if you can find anything on my other problem, it would be much appreciated. i can't find anything on the bay that will work for me. i have had to uninstall and reinstall several times which as you know can be very time consuming.  thanks again morrison."

,kadelman,2009-01-06T18:14Z,"hey morrison, thanks so much for creating this. i'm having trouble, i am on a mac. on another thread i heard people talking about how nobody's sure if there's a compatibility problem, but that the website of the rosetta stone doesn't  imply there are two separate versions. i tried simply double clicking the iso file, which is the mac way of mounting, and i get the list of files other people have talked about - like i extracted or something, but i didn't. i don't think i should need poweriso because macs mount images by double clicking; i also tried disk utility to mount. i'm trying to burn to dvd now and will update with progress but if you know any info about how macs should deal with this please let me know (OS 10.3.9 unfortunately). thanks again."
,kadelman,2009-01-06T19:26Z,"ok i tried burning the image file and it just burned as a dvdrom with the same data visible when i try to mount the iso - rosetta stone app is an .exe file which i can't open. i tried to download poweriso also, perhaps the version on the website is only 10.4+ bc i couldn't get it to open. if anyone can provide specific mac help beyond mounting it (which did not work) please let me know. thank you."

!. install power iso
2. after Download right-click the iso file on your torrent screen
3. go to (show containing folder
4. right-click again and go to power iso icon ( on the right-click drop down box) and select mount to hard drive

,92fox,2009-01-23T02:47Z,morrison0880 when i downloaded this torrent i get a .rar .   do i extract then burn or i just burn? do i convert to dvd or burn to dvd as a data?
,morrison0880,2009-01-23T04:18Z,"92fox...you should not be getting a rar file.  It is an iso image.  If you haven't done so yet, get PowerIso.  Not having that installed on your computer may be causing the file to appear as if it is a rar.  Once installed, you should see the RS file as an Iso image (it will look like a mini DVD).  Then, simply follow my instructions on pages 1 and 2 of this thread and you will be good to go."
,johhnyappleseed,2009-01-23T15:44Z,"92fox---to piggyback off of Morrison's comment-->Winrar may be the default program for reading .iso files on your machine...check your file extension; right-click the file in explorer, select ""open with..."" select PowerIso and make sure to click in the""always use this program"" checkbox.  Apply settings and you should be good to go!"
,XBUNCEX,2009-01-24T20:14Z,"This is an awesome torrent!!! Works perfectly. Like so many have posted, I too have had the problem of not being able to ""autoplay"" the program. My DVD burner is currently broken so I couldn't burn it to disc either. 

Here's what I did: 
1. Installed PowerISO (you can find this easily and get a keygen for it also)

2. Mount the ISO file. If you get a bunch of folders simply scroll down through them and eventually you should see two icons that say ""autoplay"". One of them is just an icon and the other will execute the program. I only had to click the icon the first time and after that Power ISO automatically opened the program everytime I mounted the file after that. 

Hope this helps somebody. 

Thank you so much to morrison0880, AKLowther, & everybody else in the forums for helping me to get this VERY useful program!"

,phloof,2009-01-25T07:26Z,"morrison,
I am very new to torrent downloading so I don't quite understand what is going on. Your direction's weren't vague, they just aren't as insanely specific as I need them. I've never used any mounting or torrent programs before, so when you say to burn it or mount it I have no idea what I'm doing.
-Does it matter where I save this downloaded file to?
-Do I need to go through any steps before I open this file in Power ISO? If so, what?
-When I try to put the file in the program using ""open"", it says that the file type is unsupported. When I put it in the program using ""add"", it says that the file type is a Vuze Download.
-When I try to use the ""mount"" option, my E drive isn't available. Only my H drive is there, which I don't want to use because it's just about full. I tried my H drive just to see if it could work and it asks me which file I want to open.

As you can see, I'm clueless. If you could answer some of my questions or provide a step-by-step to getting this from a downloadable torrent to a useable program, it would really be appreciated."

Also, will a V2 software work on the V3s running around nowadays (backwards compatability)?"
,phloof,2009-01-25T20:15Z,"You can ignore my last comment. I finally got it to work, I didn't realize that I had to go through the actual downloading process since you said that I can just put the file right into powerISO, but I guess that's pretty much a given. It downloaded flawlessly on Vuze once I figured out how to work that, and then I got it into powerISO and I burned it to a DVD.

It works perfectly, I didn't have any problems at all once I figured out what I had to do, and if I can make it work then anyone can.

Thanks for the awesome download!"
,morrison0880,2009-01-25T22:33Z,"Peanut-Lover...I've never seen the link that you posted, but it looks like someone is using this software to make a buck.

It's an entirely different thing to try to make a profit off selling it.  Pretty ballsy if you ask me."

,S-P-Q-R,2009-01-31T19:28Z,"For all of those talking about this being a RAR and not an ISO, some RAR programs recognize ISO files and may change the ISO icon to the RAR program's icon so you THINK it's a RAR file but it's still an ISO file.

For the people that want to add languages, you might want to search for the old all-in-one Rosetta Stone torrent which shows you how to create a custom Rosetta Stone disc.  Basically you'll need to open the ISO file and add the folders for the specific language you are adding, and you'll also need to make sure that the image files for that particular language are on the disc.

But like I said, the old all-in-one torrent explains it in detail."

Here again to help newcomers out are the instructions for this file.  Very simple.

You will see that the file is in ISO format. You DO NOT install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E], [F], [G], etc. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new [E] drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go. "

,arata75,2009-03-08T19:46Z,"Hey, I'm at about 94% getting 275 kb/s, which is pretty decent for a torrent.

Anyway, I've been reading the comments since this seems a little too good to be true, but a thousand roman soldiers can't be wrong I guess. Although I do suspect that morrison has a few multiple accounts he's using to defend himself, every else seem legit. I've even seen comments posted by verified pirates with skulls by their names, so it's looks all good.

Anyway, there have been a few common issues that I've been seeing among the commenters.

1. Many Mac user reported having problems. While there ARE Mac/Windows hybrid versions of this software out there, I don't think that this is one of them. You might want to try a program called Parallels for Mac, which you can probably find on this site. It lets you run Microsoft Windows programs as if they were native within Mac OS X. I don't know much about that since I don't have a Mac, but it's something you might want to look into.

2. Many people are reporting that they are getting a RAR file. It is *not* a RAR file. The reason it has a RAR symbol beside the file is most likely because WinRAR is the default program for opening ISOs on your computer. This probably happened during setup, where it asks you if which file types to associate with WinRAR, so therefor WinRAR will try to open the file. Installing PowerISO should fix this by setting PowerISO as your default ISO program.

3. People have been saying that Rosetta Stone will not recognize this as a language disc. From what I can see in the comments, this is *not* a language disc. It is a self contained all inclusive ISO with languages and application all in one place. Therefor, it will not save your settings on the hard drive or anywhere else. A small price to pay for $600 software.

~~~

Now my own questions. How the heck did you fit 27 freaking languages on one ISO file?! That's why I found this hard to believe. I'm at about 95% now, so I guess I'll see . . . but it just seems pretty unbelievable. Hopefully it works.

*Crossing my fingers*"
,arata75,2009-03-08T19:49Z,"Oh and by the way, it's about $600 for EACH LANGUAGE, so this is a major way to save money.

$600 per each 27 language pack = $16,200.

So yeah . . . stop complaining."
,arata75,2009-03-08T23:05Z,"Wow thanks, it actually works. Cool, man."
,morrison0880,2009-03-09T01:09Z,"arata75...I'm glad this worked for you, but I have to wonder why you felt the need to comment on my support for this torrent?  Back in October a friend of mine asked me about the Rosetta Stone program I had on my computer.  I had downloaded this file back in '07, and I showed him this torrent, which at the time had only three seeds, myself and two others.  Since then we have been working to increase the number of seeders in order to share this amazing file with others.  I have been seeding this non-stop for over six months, and I am very happy with the number of people who have been helped by it.  
That being said, this is my only account, and I'm not sure what you mean when you say that I'm ""defending myself.""  What exactly am I supposed to be defending?  "

If anyone can help me with this error, I'd appreciate it."
,morrison0880,2009-03-10T02:38Z,"yellowk...Are you clicking on the tabs in File Manager?  If so, you do not need to click on a tab.

Can you please instruct me as to what I must do inorder for the software to work  I appreciate you guys posting this because I wanted Rosetta Stone for the longest time but like you said in one of the threads below it costs like $600 bucks and it was just not feasible.

I've used it a lot and it's great. 
But.... I've resently redownloaded it on a Korean installation of XP, and am getting the ""Program not liscenced to run on this system"" error that a few people are reporting (after mounting via Alcohol & letting the autorun do its thing) . I've previously run it on English installations and had no problem, so maybe the error is coming from people running it on East Asian versions of Windows. Any thoughts appreciated "

Error 1117 is caused by missing information in Windows Vista's host file. This error is an issue with Windows Defender and is in no way related your Rosetta Stone software. To correct this error you will need to close your Rosetta Stone application and any open web-browsers before following the directions below.
Repairing Windows Vista's Host File

1. Click on the Start Menu
2. Open All Programs
3. Open Accessories
4. Right-click Notepad
5. Click Run as administrator
` 6. Click File on Notepad's menu-bar
7. Click Open
8. Double-click Computer
9. Double-click C: (sometimes named Local Disk or OS C:)
10. Double-click the Windows folder
11. Double-click System32 folder
12. Double-click drivers folder

,hlbincb,2009-04-21T22:27Z,"Okay, I have mounted it, however on Vista, there is no Run option.  It simply starts the Installer to actually install the application.

I have read through the comments and everything is great other than not being able to run the program with out actually installing it onto my computer (and then there are no languages).  

When I right click the Drive its mounted to, the only option with run is: Install or run program, to which it simply runs the Installer Wizard.  Same thing when I burned it, it Autoplays the installer.  I believe this is because there is a setup.exe file on the drive, but I don't know.  Maybe it is a setting in my Autoplay I need to change? (I checked, but there is nothing to change from saying Install or Run Program)?

,mrbaggies,2009-06-01T01:50Z,"OK guys, Now I'm probably the greatest technophobe you can ever imagine. Before running into this torrent while searching in Google for a way to get Rosetta Stone on the cheap, I had no clue what seeding was, or mounting or ISO Power or .iso file or Alcohol 120%. And I'm still largely clueless about these things.

But hey, I've just downloaded this torrent in less than 3 hours, followed the instructions on how to make it work that have been explained over and over again up and down this thread. And now fellows, I've got it working, it runs like a dream, and I'm learning French. 

First of all I downloaded Limewire because a friend said it can handle torrent downloads easily. During the setup process for Limewire, it gives the option to let Limewire handle your torrent downloads. I ticked that option and what that means is that whenever I download a torrent, Limewire handles the download and I can monitor its progress through Limewire.

So, when I clicked on the download link for this torrent, Limewire picked it up and less than 3 hours, I had it downloaded. I didn't have to worry about seeding and I still have no clue how that works or how it has stopped people on here from downloading the torrent.

Next, I downloaded the Alcohol 120% software and it gives a fully functional non-restrictive use of the software for a 15-day trial period. During setup of the software it gave me the option to create a virtual drive, which I did.

The next and last step is to Mount the downloaded Rosseta Stone file on the Virtual Drive created through Alcohol 120%. I Googled for instructions on how to do this and found the following:

Alcohol 120% is a program used to make ""virtual drives"" on your PC. It is a way to trick your PC into thinking you have extra DVD-ROM drives.

Basically, ""mounting"" an image into a drive is a way to trick your PC into thinking that you are putting a DVD into your DVD-ROM....

You create a virtual drive by opening Alcohol 120%, and selecting virtual drives, or emulation drives, or something to that affect. Then you pick the number of drives you want to virtually create, and hit ok.

Once this is done, you can click on My Computer, and then right click on the drive you just created. Then select ""Mount Image,"" and browse to where the file you want to mount is located. click it and you are done.

When I finished doing the above, Vista gave me the option to autorun the file I'd just mounted. I clicked on the option and Voila, I was set and ready to go. Everything worked fine.

To start the Rosseta Stone software again, all I did was go to My computer, find the Virtual drive that I mounted the RS on, right clicked the drive, selected autorun, and I was up and running again.

It was dead simple, so I hope this helps all those that a still struggling with this."

If you are running Vista, check out Jos3ph779's post on the previous page.  I can't vouch for it since I am running XP, but others seem to have had success with his instructions.  Good luck."

This file is an iso image of a program that holds RS self-contained with every language. There is NO installing onto your computer.  You need to burn it onto dvd as an iso image, then simply right-click and autorun.  Don't open it up.  
Here are my instructions from the first page of this thread.  If anyone else has questions, including how to work on Vista, please go through the thread, as pretty much every question is answered there.  And if you don't know anything about iso images or virtual drive management, just do a bit of research, you'll figure it out quickly.


For those who have asked, here are the instructions. Very simple.
You will see that the file is in ISO format. You don't have to install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E], [F], [G], etc. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new [E] drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go. "

Read the comments and the descriptions again.  This is NOT a simple language pack.  This is The Rosetta Stone with 27 languages, all rolled into one program.  You don't need to start the RS application, and then add language files.  All you have to is burn to a dvd or mount to a virtual drive, and autorun.  A program will open up with the RS in it.  When you open the RS, you will see the main screen and all 27 languages to the left for you to chose from.  That's it.  Download and enjoy."
,grngrn22,2009-08-02T04:46Z,"If I extract the files using WinRAR, will I be able to set everything up as if I burned it onto a DVD or mounted it on my HD?"
,grngrn22,2009-08-02T06:57Z,"This is all you have to do to get this working once its downloaded:

1. Download Power ISO from its site (Google it people)
2. Install Power ISO and do all of the crap it tells you.
3. Select the Mount option from the toolbar, and select your .ISO file.

Thats is it. Your program should now work, just go to My Computer, or your OS's equivalent and open the file. I should show up as if you have another CD Drive with a CD or DVD in it. You will then get the JTB menu, select RS and you should get your list of languages to choose from. 

And please seed people."

I have 2 restart my system to finish installing power iso, so I haven't used it yet, but this 3.62 GB thing downloaded in an hour, give or take a few minutes, so that was at least worth telling. If so many ppl r seeding, and 9 pages are full of comments, only a few ppl (most likely spammers) talking of viruses. But so many ppl couldn't be wrong about this working!!! This has to work, and if it doesn't, I won't seed, b/c it will be off my computer. But I will seed, b/c I don't think this will be a virus, and from what I read on all 9 pages, u don't need 2 install it, so no risk of a virus.

I clicked student records, and it asked me to type my name, I did so, and It made a profile.

,tfr777,2009-09-07T23:41Z,"@ morrison0880 and others:

This Ultimate V2 iso file works really good and painless and such file is the best way for beginners to get it to work immediately or test.
BUT, ATTENTION!: this version may contain media data in 2x times lower quality comparing to other torrents like http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3496724/The_Rosetta_Stone_Language_System_-_27_Languages__41_Levels._FIX
May contain means I did not check the other languages except danish but I suppose everything is the same.
Example:
32kbps 8kHz 8352bytes for DA010137.mp3 from this torrent or: 
80kbps 22kHz 18610bytes for DA010137.swa(renamed mp3 file) from compressed torrent


So, if you really need it for the language learning not for play around, I recommend to download the needed language separate from mentioned torrent and replace the existing directories with better quality mp3/swa files (application can handle both types of files). You will need only ISO file editor (UltraISO or other) to do that."
,morrison0880,2009-09-08T02:53Z,"tfr77...thanks for the comments, but I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.  It sounds like you're saying that this file is just for ""playing around"" but the other is what you would use if you're serious about learning another language?  This file has compressed the files so they are able to fit onto one disc.  Unless you are displaying it on a 50' plasma listening to the audio in Dolby 5.1, I really don't see your reasoning.  The torrent you are referring to is the first that I came across when looking for the Rosetta Stone, and after f'ing around with it forever, I found this.  Trust me, it is exactly the same as the others out there, and it's all set.  No messing around, adding pic files to audio to language packs.  So if that's something you enjoy, by all means go ahead.
BTW...thank you everyone for seeding this torrent.  I know not everyone who downloads it will, but it is great to see so many people staying on to help others enjoy this resource."

But it wont play, i put the CD in and it just opens 4 file folders.  What else should i do?  I want to make a playable CD...what am i missing?  Should I be converting the ISO file to something else before i burn?  How do i get it on a CD that just plays once i insert it?"
,morrison0880,2010-01-13T04:54Z,"nobruusa, this file is an iso image.  All you have to do is go into the ""Burn: menu, and then browse for the Rosetta Stone image (hint, it will look like a gold disc, and will be where you downloaded it to =)  Then burn at the lowest speed.  That is all you need to do.  Good luck."
,nobruusa,2010-01-14T04:31Z,"morrison, thanks for the reply.  I did burn it to 4 CD to be more exact since i thought i was doing something wrong.  Once i insert the CD i burned back in my PC, windows ask me if i want to opne the file folder and all i get is 4 folders ( the same folders i extracted from the download).  i have the Rosetta installed in my PC but it has no languages in it.  There's must be something i'm not doing right...sorry for being such a noob.  "
,nobruusa,2010-01-14T05:10Z,"reply to my previous comment and to morrison, i'm sorry...i tried the download one more time and it worked like a charm.  All i had to do was burn it to a DVD and it worked...i believe i was picking the wrong ISO file before and thats why it wasn't working.  This one worked 100%, sorry for the scare....no problems at all."
,morrison0880,2010-01-15T07:37Z,"nobruusa...fantastic.  I'm glad you figured it out.  You are going to really enjoy it.  One request to you, and anyone else who downloads.  Please seed.  10x would be great, but 5x or even 3x helps out a ton.  Peace."
,rstyleuk,2010-01-21T03:50Z,"I just installed win 7 and lost the image file and the rar file , has anyone got the image so i dont have to download the whole thing again"
,Pieface12,2010-01-26T11:08Z,"If I have already installed the program on my mac, will these language files work for it?"
,polecat29,2010-01-26T14:08Z,Probably doing something stupid.... dl and used power iso to create the dvd. But I cannot get the DVD to autoplay. 
,morrison0880,2010-01-29T04:06Z,"lullo1609...as far as I know this works on Windows only.  I haven't seen this work on Macs.  Might as well try and see, but my friend's Mac doesn't recognize it. "
,santiago_b,2010-02-01T04:55Z,"Great torrent. I burnt it to disc w/ ImgBurn, and it works perfectly. I'm very happy w/ this one! thanks."
,toddo1965,2010-02-07T18:20Z,"Morrison,  any thoughts on my problem with the Macromedia Projector issue?  I could really use some suggestions.  Thanks."
,junaz87,2010-02-09T01:06Z,"brilliant torrent, downloaded it in about 6 hours. iso onto disk in no time, works as expected. will seed :P share the love guys"
,morrison0880,2010-02-09T01:30Z,toddo1965...there may be a number of issues that are causing this issue.  Try downloading the latest versions of Adobe and Macromedia flash players.
,ViciousOne,2010-02-16T07:28Z,"100% working.  I used ImageBurn and have no problems in XP, Vista 64, and Win7 64.

Any way to update this to add level 3?  Might mean that the torrent be broken into to versions to include the extra levels.

My only request would be an updated version with v3.  The current torrents for v3 work but a single DVD that is self contained would be blissful."
,retard_fish,2010-03-19T05:16Z,"What exactly do I mount?
I can't find any files in the iso format.
What is the name of the file i have to burn?"

,honunet,2010-05-09T11:07Z,"Dude.. I dont know how to thank you. hypothetically lets say I downloaded this.  I would then say to you wow it only took two hrs do download and was really as easy as you said to use.  If i did do that and decided to mount it and burn to a disk for later use, i would then tell you wow that was easy as well.!  hypothetically.  Good thing I am a law abiding citizen and would never dream of it.  Thanks again"

They also have a Virus that causes your IE to redirect!!!! Trust me!!"
,BAW146,2011-06-22T01:55Z,so if i downloaded this and wanted to learn russian it would give me the entire russian learning program. because i thought there were like 5 levels not 2...
,djmopa,2011-07-15T07:13Z,"@ BAW146, this is the older version. There are 3 series to the Russian. This is the first 2.

Once you are fluent in the first 2, get the 3rd one."

Maybe ive over looked the answer but id like someone to repost or reply  pleasee!"
,ruelolli,2011-08-07T11:48Z,"Downloading now. Thanks for all the great information on ""how-to"" for us newbs. If this works out for me, I'm more than happy to seed for a while to help out (especially since it's taking me over 13 hours to get this program). 

I only have one question: What is/and how do I change the seed ratio? I remember seeing morrison post something to the effect of 10x, 5x, and 3x seeding? Wasn't aware that there was different types of seeding. Normally, I simply let it segue from downloading into seeding and just leave it up. Is that at a certain seed speed? 

Want to help out as much as possible. "
,ruelolli,2011-08-08T03:14Z,"Finally finished downloading this and, after following the simple instructions morrison left on here, I am now learning how to converse with flies! lol

Thanks again for uploading this. And for explaining in very very simple terms how to mount this to a ghostdrive and how to run the program. If you read the instructions all the way through, put your horse before your cart, and show a little patience, this is a ridiculously easy download to use.

Also, to those who claim this torrent has viruses - it does not. Ran it through several virus detectors and it came out squeaky clean.

Thanks again for the upload. Will be seeding for as long as I can manage it. :)"
