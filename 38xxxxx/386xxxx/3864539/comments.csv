,pygmyshrew,2007-11-02T20:35Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FILM!!! IT TOTALLY SUX BALLS!!!
If you like movies with bad special effects and even worse sound effects, people running around shooting their weapons from the hip, gunbattles that last for FUCKING EVER without anyone getting hit, and a bad story, THEN download this film. Although i recommend you dont."
