                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Canadian Marc Emery, Canada's most prominent marijuana legalization activist, 
is at the top of the U.S, Drug Enforcement Agency's 'Most Wanted List' and now 
faces extradition to the U.S. and possible life imprisonment.  His crime - 
selling marijuana seeds over the Internet.  An occupation he has never denied.  
In fact for more than a decade he has dutifully filed his income tax returns 
in Canada stating his occupation as "marijuana seed seller".  He paid his 
taxes and was left alone by the Canadian authorities.  However Canada's RCMP 
suddenly and willingly co-operated when the DEA got him in their sights.

Widely known as "The Prince of Pot," Emery is the joint smoking publisher of 
Cannabis Culture Magazine, founder of the BC Marijuana Party and a lifelong 
rabble-rouser.  And now, according to the DEA, one of the most wanted men in 
the drug world, up there with the heads of Columbian cocaine cartels, and the 
top drug trafficker in North America.

His story is the prism through which director, Nick Wilson, examines the touchy 
issue of sovereignty, the long reach of U.S. drug laws, and Canadian pot 
culture, while spending the summer embedded at the Emery defense headquarters.

Emery believes marijuana is a wonderful, healing drug and that current laws are 
unconstitutional, inhumane, and detrimental to society, far outweighing the 
damage done to people by the drug itself.  No Canadian has ever gone to jail 
for selling seeds, and in 35 years only two people have been charged - the last 
got a $200 fine.  Yet Emery faces 30 years to life in prison under U.S. drug 
laws if he is extradited to face trail there.

THE PRINCE OF POT follows Emery through the summer and fall as he plots his 
defense, attends court hearings and tries to clear the names of his two friends 
who now face the same fate as him.
