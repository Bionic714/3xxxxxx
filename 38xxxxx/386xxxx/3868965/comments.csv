,Botch,2007-11-01T21:38Z,"""We need to regenerate a male-flavoured spirituality""
 - Now, THAT seems feminized if anything ;D"
,Bad_Boy_Rune,2007-11-02T04:33Z,"It's true!  The male female roles have traded places --fueled by American prime time TV, endless commercials, and a flood of dumb Hollywood movies. 

Turn on any show and women act like men while guys are portrayed as either dorky/ funny or stupid. That is, the few straight guys that are left since its so popular to have gay guys on every show.  If women were portrayed in the same way men are, the feminists would storm the studios.

,sweet_hannah888,2007-11-17T01:54Z,"I'm looking for Ebooks entitled ""What women know that man dont""."
,EliteBubba,2007-12-03T17:19Z,Doesn't even say which moron wrote this crap.....some wife beating pseudo-scientist I guess...
,xanatose,2008-03-12T21:34Z,Well he does have many points. Women are getting a lot of priviledges and none of the responsibilities. And I do not see any movement to change this. 
,adventurejunky,2008-05-20T18:54Z,"What men know that women dont... are you  kidding me with this?
Id like to know what goes on with a women vagina and feelings but thats not gona fucking happen is it?"
,Lesman,2008-08-07T15:38Z,"This is absolutely ridiculous.

Firstly, don't write a book in English if it isn't your first language. It seems pretty clear to me that it is not, and if I'm wrong, then God help us.

Second, you're an idiot. I mean, even if you had a high school diploma, you would know at least SOMETHING about providing evidence for your claims when attempting to make a point. You were too cool for school, right?

Lastly, get over it. Do you live under a rock? Women are STILL paid an average of 25% less than men for performing the same jobs in this country, which is slowly changing. I hate to break it to you, but this country is only getting more progressive, and with your incredibly archaic views, I suggest that you either grow the fuck up, or emigrate to an area of the world whose views align more with yours.

Good luck with that, dumbass."
,kidknapp,2009-01-23T16:00Z,"My opinion would be 
1. Nobody made Lesman visit this torrent or download it.
2. Lesman you just insulted someone's opinion with an opinion, who is the real dumbass?
3. I t takes all types. 

I don't agree with ascribing traits and social roles to people based on race, creed, gender, or sexual preference. It is an ignorant mode of thinking that will never cover base on the whole of the 6+ billion people on this rock. All men and women are different - some are similar, some are not. Some women have it easy because their inherited social status makes it so, others are still growing up the family slave and rape toy of their patriarch - which IS sad and horrible. Yes, Men suffer responsibility - but so do single mothers. The issue here being that with such a mass of individuals you cannot apply any given opinion to everyone as a whole. Too many different people are too different. Too many different nations rule too differently. It would be more sane to allow the author his opinion, and visit it objectively as a work of someone else's opinion. If you disagree (with an opinion), it takes more intelligence to do it respectfully than idiotically. That said, Lesman, you're a moron......"
,MiraFirefly,2009-01-27T04:50Z,"Sexist POS. Try being a woman sometime and better yet, try reading some HISTORY. That's right, read a book. It'll do ya good."
,kidknapp,2009-02-08T19:52Z,"Again, a perfect example of someone who cannot argue intelligently. 'Try being a woman' is a case point of a generic cop-out. I cannot try being a woman because that is a trait ascribed by chromosomes set in place prior to birth. Not that I wrote or endorse this book, but to be fair, drivel for drivel is still drivel. Surely Mira would write a kudos review to a book called - 'Men are dumb, ingrateful whore dogs and the goth chicks who love them.' But none of that matters. Everyone is entitled to their opinion - that is the core of freedom. My issue is this: Generalizations and stereotypes are archaic in today's society. No traits applied to the individual can be applied to the whole. There will always be exceptions. Was Harriet Tubman oppressed? Yes, all black women of the time(1600-1865) were oppressed in regards to either be a slave to their owners, or subjugated to their role as female and dependent on their male counterparts. Both of which are direct results of the general perception of society in that era. Women have always been oppressed in religious values of all kinds. Countless places in history mark the female as the servant of the house, essentially. Now the case is simply that in America women have gained more rights and freedoms, but the oppression women endure today comes in the form of double standard expectations and mental abuse. Their are still other forms of abuse that occur to women, but abuse happens to men and boys as well. Verstehen is the key here. My point stands that there are too many different people and circumstances to make vague generalizations about the state of society on the whole.....But that doesn't mean you should act like a moron- male or female:> "
