,Exactoman,2011-08-14T08:50Z,"There are apparently two tracks missing from this album: One that I've been looking for for a while, ""Come Back When You Can"", and ""The Takers""."
,Exactoman,2011-08-14T09:05Z,"Oh, there's a couple versions of the album. This one has a couple songs the other one doesn't have and vice-versa. Kinda cool? "
