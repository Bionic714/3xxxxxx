For those of you who like to "discover" bands before they become popular, keep an eye on Barcelona. Soon you will be the indie insider who "listened to these guys before they were even a band." Give a listen to their album and you will discover a band that has yet to be "discovered." 

Barcelona plays piano/guitar driven rock that is truly beautiful. Their alternative rock sound { "It's About Time" and "Stars" are stand-out tracks} incorporates intricate rythyms and massive guitars that set them apart from a market saturated by twenty-and-thirty-something alternative rock bands. In addition to this, they mix in just the right number of slow, string-accompanied, falsetto-driven songs to carry the album to the next level. Tracks like "First Floor People," "Get Up, Get Up, Get Up," and "Please Don't Go" showcase Brian's outstanding voice and will make you second-guess that this is their debut album. You are left with the feeling that these guys know how to make good music, period. They incorporate musical elements from many bands yet don't sound lie any in particular. From beginning to end, this album will take you on a journey that you won't want to end. I wish I had another chance to listen to it for the very first time. 

I know that there are countless CD's realeased every day, but it would be well worth your time to check this one out. This CD is just too good for you to ignore.
