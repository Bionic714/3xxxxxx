,raider56,2007-10-28T15:35Z,This is the same old nuked release from HLS that has been upploaded several times before. Why don't people use the search engine? It is still nuked u know!
,styletech,2007-10-28T15:51Z,"raider56.. Sorry dude u are so wrong, have just seen it 2 times now, and it is not nuked.. Please check out the facts, before u open your mouth next time!!"
,raider56,2007-10-28T15:56Z,Oh but it is and I am always checking facts on the contrary from you! http://www.rlslog.net/the-simpsons-movie-dvdrip-xvid-hls/
,raider56,2007-10-28T15:58Z,Besides that loder has over 300 seeders on this crappy release http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3840535/The.Simpsons.Movie.DVDRiP.XViD-HLS
,styletech,2007-10-28T16:26Z,"hmm, I give up, u have the facts, and i was wrong, didn`t notice frame missing.. But still the quality is good, and dont think you miss anything importent.
Soz raider56. I am so tired of people who writes comments and whines about everything. "
,raider56,2007-10-28T16:42Z,"This commentaty part of TPB is here for a reason. Users are supposed to use it to inform others of nuked movies, viruses, trojans, passworded files and so on. That is exactly what I'm doing. If you don't like ""whiners"" don't upload nuked movies. And this is not a DVDRip even if the quality is fair. Watermarks at the bottom of the pic indicates that it is a screener or a workprint, cropped at the bottom to remove the watermark. It is the ""DVDRip"" in the fileneme I react to. HLS has been criticised a lot lately for that label."
,styletech,2007-10-28T17:20Z,"i wasn`t saying u where whining, but i`m pointing to other torrent upload`s and the comments that are posted there. not from u but others, and yeah u have right, note that this is my first upload. so i will take your words with me and remember them next time i upload something :) thanks raider56. Wise words u writing.."
