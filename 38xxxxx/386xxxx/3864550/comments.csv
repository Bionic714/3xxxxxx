,hoodcore,2007-10-30T02:19Z,How can this album be 320 at such a small size. Willing to bet it's a transcode.
,wierdo10,2007-10-30T09:59Z,password shit
,planktonfist,2007-10-30T21:09Z,"inside of rar is another rar and a .ink file.  .ink file tries to look like a .nfo file to get downloader to open it.  Upon opening, a window pops up saying that this download was recorded by the RIAA and restarts your computer.
The second rar is also password protected."

Milk Lizard is fucking sick! =) "

BTW. Has anyone heard of Stolen Babies?  Gil Sharone (new drummer for Dillinger) is their drummer.  BAD ASS.  And a little wierd. Avant-garde at its best."
,Rocco.Ruthless,2007-11-09T06:57Z,I found it.  I'll upload it to PB so you can get it here.
