,Giteen,2008-07-21T17:06Z,"Thx for the stuff, I do have a couple questions though.

1.130MB is nearly DOUBLE the size of the original CLS installer.  Is this ONLY sp1 or are there liveries, etc. included?

2. I am assuming I replace all existing CLS files with the ones downloaded...right?

3.  Where does the ""CLS"" folder go?

Thanks a lot, I do apperciate it."
