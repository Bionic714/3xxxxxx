Commercial Level Simulations - Airbus A330 & A340 - SP1 (FSX)

1. Livery manager more clear about FS selection
2. FS9/FSX A340-300: ENG 3/4 IGN switches: texture missing/blank
3. FS9 A340-300: Pedestal: Camera buttons missing
4. FS9 smoke effects (All models: Smoke effects look rather strange, more like a wake or a vortex than like a heat effect. For me, they could be removed or be optional. They might look nice from a postion directly behind the tail inflight, but on the ground or from another perspective, it looks a bit strange. )
5. FS9 All models: Overhead panel: It should be a "Galley" button in the ELEC section, not a "GALLY" one
6. VC fps improvement. 
7. FSX The AFS in the VC 330s does not display any data, the ALT knob is not displaying (Only black outline).
In the 340s VC same problem with the ALT knob and the icons don't work
8. VC enabled by default
9. FSX satcom
10. FSX wings black marks.
11. FSX VC texture missing
12. A340-600 on status page, http://www.commerciallevel.com/forum/index...?showtopic=5041
13. reprogram the Engine display to remove the EPR readings and show N1. None of the A340's (all 200/300 series) that where powered by the CFM56 engines ever went by EPR.
14. Logo light A330 double check (different reports wether working or not)
15. cockpit window diagonal line.
