,Denekamp,2007-11-02T20:09Z,Ive got a question! Ive got Vista with FSX and for every aerosoft add-on I need to put the crack file in the TEMP folder.. But I cant find that TEMP folder. I know XP does have a TEMP folder but I cant find it in Vista. Can somebody help me? thankss
,vEcToR_2007,2007-11-02T20:21Z,"That would be in ""X:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Temp\""

Clean first, install after. Search for ""ascrypt.dll"" and replace the crckd one....

Hope this helps."
,vEcToR_2007,2007-11-02T20:23Z,"For Vista that is. Dunno in XP, should be in 'documents and settings/username/' etc I guess."
,vEcToR_2007,2007-11-02T22:34Z,"Thanks all. I have been working at it for days now and it works. Pirate FSX and Accell, just great!"
,Agge666,2007-11-04T13:27Z,Gents! Be prepared that FSX Acc can mess around with some of your add-ons. It´s a known issue; visit Avsim forum and read about It...
,Havhelt,2007-11-05T15:18Z,"Should i choose ""activate now"" or ""activate later""?
I have registerd version of FSX."
,litleben,2007-11-05T18:12Z,is it all language ? and thanks for the torrent
,kramnesyob,2007-11-07T03:11Z,"Works great!! Thanks to all that helped make it!

For all those that don't understand how to do it:
1) DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT
2) USE DAEMON TOOLS AND MOUNT TO A DRIVE
3) OPEN DRIVE YOU MOUNTED IT TO
4) CLICK ON SETUP.EXE FILE (NOT THE SETUP.EXE.ORIGINAL FILE!!). ONCE THE INSTALLER RUNS AND COMPLETES, WITHOUT STARTING FSX YET, COPY ALL 3 DLL FILES (API.DLL, FSUI.DLL & MAIN.DLL) 
FROM THE ""CRACK"" FOLDER INTO YOUR MAIN FSX FOLDER AND OVERWRITE THE EXISTING FILES! THAT'S IT. START FSX AS NORMAL AND HAVE FUN!

Later...time to fly for a few hours...

can someone help me?? i just need the single 95mb file.

wud save me from downloading the whole 2.78gb iso again."
,Angerfist_DJ,2007-11-16T22:39Z,"I'm sorry, but i got some problems with the addon, and i believe it has something to do with pirate protection or something.

While playing, my textures changes to low, the aircraft texture changes also to low, all words in the menu bar are unreadable, they change into black stripes and stuff. Right click with the mouse shows a little menu, well guess what...same thing...

Maybe it is a protection or something for illigal versions of the addon, but in FSX without the addon, it works fine."
,Derice,2007-11-21T21:35Z,"I've downloaded this ISO.
First installed a clean FSX + SP1 (with cracks) then I installed this ISO and I receive the message that my graphics card doesn't meet the requirements.

I've got a 8800GTS with the latest drivers, also I've played FSX + SP1 before on my system, just not with the accell. pack.

,slasherblazer,2007-12-08T05:20Z,Does this work on original copy of FSX deluxe?
,viscount007,2007-12-08T14:39Z,"Here we have a good example where it is better to buy than use a Pirate copy - heck it is only £15.00 in the shops.  (not sure what that is in US - but at current exchange rate would be about $30, maybe less because of the drop in price of FSX over last year!).  In other words - why bother with a program that can ""maybe"" crash all you expensive add-ons!"

You can find seeding options in your torrent download manager. You will need to set your maximum upload rate as you like, or keep it unlimited (in most manager's 0 meens unlimited), and after you finish download (maybe you have already done it) keep the torrent in the seeding tab(wich is automatic), that's means do not delete the torrent from your download manager when done downloading. Way to go pal ;) , and 10x again."

Yea... u dont download sp2 for FSX. i actually bought fsx and downloaded sp1 and it works flawlessly. When i updated to sp2 it kept telling me  fatal error has occurred. sp2 is just for online use anyways. No reason to get sp2 unless you want to. 

1.Go to control panel, 
2.then click on programs and features. 
3.You'll see a list of your installed programs. 4.Uninstall SP2.

 this won't uninstall FSX. i promise you. Just the SP2. If that doesnt work.  then reboot time. "

,9824gbi,2011-04-28T08:01Z,"Ok So I just downloaded this and it does indeed work!.

1. Mount as a virtual drive or burn iso to dvd.
2. run setup.exe not setup.exe.original
3. Let it install.
4. Do not run FSX until you copy over the craked .dll's
5. I renamed the original .dll's by adding a ""1"" to them incase I need the originals again.
6. After you copy over the new cracked .dll's run fsx and the expansion pack will be installed.

I am running a legitimate version of FSX Deluxe I bought from the store. It's a fresh install none of the service packs are installed. I have been able to use the new planes and new missions without any registration needed. Enjoy everyone and don't forget to seed the hell out of this!!!! I was hitting 1.2/mps Great job guys!"
