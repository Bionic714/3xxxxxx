,Miss_Monstrous,2008-10-23T00:00Z,"It looks very nice, but it doesn't have a recipe feature.  I cook a lot, and I don't want to have to log in every component ingredient of a casserole separately each time I have a serving.  Also I didn't see clearly where it tracked sugar intake, which is important to me for health reasons.  Overall I'll have to stick with Performance Diet Pro.  That's a bit of a shame since it looks like this one has the superior excercise tracker..."
,Jonesing,2008-11-14T10:15Z,"@Miss_Monstrous: To make a custom recipe go to food log then the custom tab on the right, make a new custom, enter the ingredients then the recipe can be found by searching food names like normal.

To track sodium or any other nutrient go to the reports page, then the Diet Advanced tab, you can get ridiculously detailed stats there."
