Kaurismakiesque Japanese slow food comedy.  Bonus - Markku Peltola - in more than a cameo.
A slow moving comedy about some Japanese women trying to discover themselves - in Finland.

A must for Kaurismaki fans.  KaurismÃ¤ki...

Absolutely no action!  No sushi!

The film is mostly in Japanese, with some Finnish dialog.  English subtitles throughout.  No Finnish subtitles.

NTSC iso.
