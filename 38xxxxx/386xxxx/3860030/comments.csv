,redcore,2007-11-01T04:44Z,"I wasn't sure about this because I didn't know if it was going to have real songs (regardless of what the tracklist claims) or if they were just crappy songs that were being released - but this is a pretty good album. If you like Michael, especially his last album (Invincible) you'll probably like this quite a bit as well. Very good album, recommended."
,Bonomaul,2007-11-09T17:15Z,"Listen to what splattergod is saying. NOT a new album! 
Some good music though.."
