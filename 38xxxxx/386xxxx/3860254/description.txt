My Commodore 64 collection. About 1.94GB of (uncompressed) tape, cartridge, disk, and basic program images (mostly games) for use with your favorite emulator or for actual C64 use. Contains most of the Arnold FTP archives as well as most of Commodoregames.com before it had to be taken down due to silly copyright issues. The roms are split into what type of image it is (cartridge, disk, etc.) and further split into alphabetical order, for the most part. No attempt to categorize them further was made.

Most of this stuff is probably available elsewhere, but this is the result of a few years of pre-bittorrent combing of various FTP and IRC sites, as well as trading with others via physical media. 

This is not the Gamebase release repackaged, although a lot of stuff is probably duplicated in some way. If your client supports it, download the listing.txt file beforehand to see the contents of the directories.

Files:

basic.rom: The C64 BIOS.
c64roms.zip: The main roms directories.
ccs64 v3.4.zip: CCS64, one of the better, IMHO, emulators.
listing.txt: A dos DIR dump of all the ROM directories.
notes.txt: You are here.
torrent....: You know what this is.
