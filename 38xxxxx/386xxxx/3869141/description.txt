This is working !!
Thanx to fulcrum_21 he explained how to do it.
So i decided to put the files u need in this torrent.

Download FSX Acceleration iso here on pirate bay, mount it with Daemon tools.
Then go to the mounted drive and copy all files folders etc to a map on your hard drive.

Then copy the setup file in this torrent to your hard drive folder and overwrite the old one.

Then run setup.exe from there.

After installation finished copy the files from FSX_acceleration_crack-ENIGMA
To root directory of your FSX folder.

Run FSX and have fun
