,EddieFnG,2011-07-24T01:48Z,"Open Winrar, open file ending on .001, click on extract, do so. Open whatever mounting software you have, mount the .bin file, then once it's installed, go into the Fairlight folder on the virtual CD drive, and copy Boxsport Manager.exe to the install directory."
,dee_ess,2011-09-02T14:24Z,"The torrent works just fine, except people don't want to listen. If you look in the comments they tell you to replace Boxing Manager.exe in the C:\Program files\Boxing Manager application folder. You do that and run it and it works just great! Thanks for upload."
