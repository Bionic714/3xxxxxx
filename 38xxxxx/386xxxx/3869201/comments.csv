I used this crap. Started an adult site... good for a week...until I got traffic, when traffic started they suspended me... I feel like if i am paying you to serve my files I should be allowed to have any file as long as its legal... and porn is legal... but they will suspend your account... dont download this crap"

A window will come up with the generated HTML code. copy and paste it in NotePad. Save it, not as a .txt file but a .html file. Then the file you created can be uploaded to any website using ther file uploader. Just remember to link directly to that file."
