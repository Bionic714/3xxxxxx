,mrspock09,2008-02-12T04:04Z,"just to let you guys know, normal swap magic won't play these games. you have to have the import version of swap magic or a mod chip that plays imported/regional games."

This is where your wrong...swap magic is used to play imported games and back-ups...so if u have an ntsc system, thats the version swap magic you need to buy...srry to be mean, but ur wrong..."

,Guitar313,2011-05-19T00:45Z,"I'm running PCSX2 0.9.8, and this game runs spectacular. The FMVS I've seen so far are flawless. The only thing is this game is very Processor heavy to emulate, with my AMD x4 620 I get mild slowdown in certain battles, the worst so far ( I'm only lvl 32ish and at 2nd visit to Olympus ) is the battle with Seifer at the beginning. In fact, Twilight Town lags for me in general. Great game though, I recommend to any KH fans."
,Guitar313,2011-05-19T00:46Z,P.S. I only Download the first disc ( KH 2 FM+ ) so I can't say anything about KH RE- CoM which is disc 2.

Pleas if anybody can help me."
