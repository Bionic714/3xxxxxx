,ailsa1208,2007-11-28T17:40Z,"Is this for real? Have anyone tried this out yet? There are many ""satellite tv on pc"" websites selling software or service but most of them are scams, giving you some dead link or some channels that have always been free for anyone to watch. Other than that, the software they made you to install may contains spyware.

Any ideas about this one?"
