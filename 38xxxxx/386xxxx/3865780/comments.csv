,chrisblackcat,2009-08-01T13:53Z,"Awesome! I was hoping to find something like this. This blows away the cd release version. Great Job and thanks for torrent'n/seeding this. The Goldfrap and Sasha mix(track 4) is just like in the club, why the released ""untrue"" version has such lame versions and lack of extra songs from the film is ridiculous. Thanks for this TRUE version. BTW, any reccomendations for any more John Murphy and/or King Britt/Tom Motzar? Thanks again!! "
