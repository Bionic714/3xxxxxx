Are HAMs so stupid so they don't know how file SHARING works? My idea was to share the whole serie DXpedition videos worldwide. Since HAMs don't seed I will share the rest of the serie only to my friends instead. Thank you!

HAM SPIRIT IS DEAD!"

Like a bright star on that mostly dark sky, the MSFS flightsimers, as a group, are among the best to stay and seed their stuff after completed download."
,mallrat_ld90,2008-08-13T19:21Z,"From all the torrents I have seed'ed 0:30 is not uncommon.  I have to say also that I expected people downloading ham documentaries would be better than the average leach.  I guess I shouldn't be that surprised though, most hams are older to old, and of them, half of them are crotchety as all hell.  Not getting these files out though assures that these videos will not be around for a next generation of hams.

I have been seeding your other Sandwich Islands and Georgia documentaries since I downloaded them.  I believe I am the only one who is.  If I ever get these other ones, I will seed them as well.

Please seed the series, at least long enough for one other decent person to pick up the seed.  Don't let bastards stop decent people from access."
,mallrat_ld90,2009-11-05T15:41Z,"Ok, have been seeding this for over a year now, and it looks like no one has picked up the seed, so I am going to let it fade out."
