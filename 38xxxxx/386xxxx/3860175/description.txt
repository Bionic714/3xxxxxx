Compressed losslessly with TTA (http://www.true-audio.com/, yes, mplayer can play it).

Source: Found it floating around the net in Monkey\\\'s Audio format, which is, although lossless, proprietary. Also, it was in one big chunk of a file, so I split it and recoded it. Gained in size (which is bad), gained in comfort (which is good).
