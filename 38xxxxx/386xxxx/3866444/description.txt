World of Padman

   Dual winner of moddb.com \"Creativity Award\" and \"Visual Delight\" award.  As well as many other quality awards.  
This game is great.  It is like Quake 3, if they it were a cracked out cartoon with a bunch of blue smurf-ish dudes and if
papa smurf wore a some crazy shades, became a super hero/villian and had a \"well endowed\" girl friend. This game is all out fun, and a classic first person shooter, good time.  You play in many huge maps that give you the feel as though you are a small smurf-ish fellow.  Many cool guns and moves, and
the community is growing to thousands of players.  

Since I am a Linux user, I included the Linux installer and the Windows installer (for everyone else) so everyone can get in on the action.
   (you can pick to download either one or both with your torrent client)

  This game is some serious online fun, so I hope to see you there!
