WOP has really nice maps but boring gameplay (badly reskinned Q3A)."

Why is it too bad?   I included both for convenience.  You'll notice that the windows installer in a Win32 binary, hardly usable on a Linux system without emulation, and (obviously) it isnt' always perfect.  And, the Linux binary is a bash script installer....  Hardly usable on the average Windows system.

Anyhow, you are right that once the data is unpacked... (installed), you have access to OS specific binaries.  But, it is a chicken egg problem really, since if you download the installer, and cannot use it, you will not have access to these files that can be invoked on your OS.


Had they released a small set of OS dependent scripts with a separate data archive to simply index into, that would have been the way to go... 

but they didn't.  And I am not about to go and engineer an installer for a game I did not write.

So, yeah.... um you can chose which ever installer you want to download.

Anyhow, I think the game is quite creative.  It is made by a very small team of developers.  I guess you are comparing it against industry giants... just like the last guy that bashed my Super Mario War upload.  Also a great team of devers.

Hey, when you come out with a better game let me know... trust me, it isn't easy.  I am in the consideration of modeling simulation and rasterization optimizations for my engineering masters thesis.  As I said, not as easy as it looks (depending on the level of abstraction you are working at)"
