This is Citay, a project out of San Francisco. At  
first Citay was a studio project between myself    
(Ezra Feinberg) and Tim Green from The Fucking    
Champs, with some help from others. Now there is  
a live band including members of Tussle, Crime In  
Choir, The Dry Spells, By Land And Sea, 3 Leafs,  
Galactic Bunz, Horn of Dagoth and Sweet Potatoes.  
Citay has toured and/or shared bills with          
Vetiver, Six Organs Of Admittance, Howlin' Rain,  
The Fucking Champs, Danava, Earthless, Black      
Fiction, Daevid Allen (from The Soft Machine and  
GONG), Papercuts, and many others... The first    
Citay record is out now on Important Records      
(importantrecords.com). The record is also out on  
vinyl on Frenetic Records (freneticrecords.com).  
The second Citay record will be called "Little    
Kingdom." It has been conceived and will be        
delivered in the autumn of 2007 on Dead Oceans    
records (deadoceans.com).
