,Leonkramer,2007-10-31T17:03Z,Thanks Dopeman! Hopefully a version of the game that works

,The Mangler,2007-10-31T17:44Z,"chalky 111 , try ISOHUNT.."
,davve__,2007-10-31T18:53Z,It would be nice if some one would seed....!? 
,Chabotoman702,2007-10-31T18:58Z,"Agreed. Not getting any seeders only peers!

Hope this one works. 
Since the other one just freezes my computer when i load the image."
,Eorlas,2007-10-31T19:17Z,Hey would someone please seed this? I'm getting all leechers and no seeds. I'll seed this as long as I can actually get it : /
,The Mangler,2007-10-31T19:42Z,"now i'm downing with +/- 100 kb/s but with a big red progress bar with blue thin stripes in it ..
maybe there was no problem if i had a black/white-screen ! haha "
,budskee420,2007-10-31T19:56Z,"alright i have jumped on the badwagon as well even though i have a good feeling this isnt a real release simply because there is no seeder on the very day it has been released. i will take the risk and download it, and give you guys a full review as soon as i have it as to its authenticity, so check back here later tonight or sometime tomorrow(if this speed im sownloading at keeps up). but from my experience with every download without a seeder, its just a fake. although i really really dont think this is because i completely trust DOPEMAN and am willing to put my baby (pc) on the line to prove it. so check back later for my review, which i am going to go out on a limb and say its real, but as of now am not 100%. P.S. if it turns out to be real thanks you dopeman u tha man and ill pack myself a fatty bowl upon the execution of this game in your honor my friend :) Budskee out!"
,budskee420,2007-10-31T19:59Z,"and everyone coming to download this, since there is no seeder i ask that you all wait until i or someone else has finished downloading this, and posts a review. otherwise we may all be sitting here downloading this for up to a week only to find out it may not be genuine. i will seed when i am finished all night while i sleep for maybe a month or so. but i ask everyone coming and reading this to just wait, until someone like me can get it and tell you how it is. thanks :)"
,nemasion,2007-10-31T20:20Z,seed plz
,Eorlas,2007-10-31T20:37Z,^^Nothing by dopeman is fake. I just wish there were seeders.
,budskee420,2007-10-31T20:45Z,"i am uploading while i download at 60-78 kb/s im doing everyhting in my power to help keep the download speed up, but the more people that come to download this, the longer its going to be. if people dont pay attention to my comment and just all start downloading this and not uploading/sharing it, it is going to take us a week or more before we can get it. im up to 3.8% so far. but whoever is seeding this cant ahndle this many downloaders by themself, and at the saem time allow us to download at any sort of consistent good speed. please wait people until we can get some more seeders. like i said ill seed it when im done, but am uploading while i download to help sort of distribute the kb/s around better. dont be selfish guys."
,Eorlas,2007-10-31T20:50Z,"^^budskee there are no seeders just leechers. Right now there are a lot of people choking their upload speed and just downloading.

Dopeman please come back and seed this! I will seed when I am done,"
,budskee420,2007-10-31T20:56Z,"yea i have a cable platunium package, and when i am done can disconnect myself from my router, and plug myself directly into the modem. once i do that, ill be able to seed out up to 500 kb/s. ill have to do this everynight because i gotta share my internet with other people in my home. but at night,  once i have finished downloading this, you guys should see some really nice jumps in your download speeds :) i was actually going to go buy this game today and was going to go get it as soon as my dad got home ( my cars in the shop) and i will still purchase this game, simply because i have the money at the moment to. but im going to post pone purchasing it to get it this way, and share it with others who may not have the money to get a brand new 50 dollar game at this time :) im all for supporting the creators of this game, but am also aware that not everyone can make the sacrifice of even 50 bucks. so like i said, once i get it, i will seed my ass off every night."
,ufcmike,2007-10-31T21:34Z,"Awesome, I've never heard of this game until now.

One questions: Is this game made to burn?

Oh I wish I had an Oscar Meyer Seeder"
,Eorlas,2007-11-01T02:00Z,Good luck finding a seeder Killawife
,budskee420,2007-11-01T02:44Z,"30%% alright!! im pleasantly surprised to see it got up 30% in a meer 61/2 hours. that may sound like alot, but im happy with the progress as long as it continues. the only thing thats really bothering me is im using bitlord, and im seeing a total of 690 downloaders, almost 700 people are downloading this and.... 53 of those 690 are uploading it while they download it, me being one of those 53. i actually went out and bought this game :) but im still uploading it and downloading it for all you 53 UNSELFISH people out there. to the rest of you 640 something people....... your pretty fucking selfish considering your getting a FREE game."
,Rif,2007-11-01T02:47Z,"The protection has been unmodified so if the original release didn't work for you (RAID incompatability, etc.) this one won't either.

budskee420, you said you were an ""experienced downloader"" but didn't trust the 1.1 patch mentioned in the other thread since ""the release just came out"".  Are you for real?  Do you know the original release came out about a week ago?  Are you a collector/archiver?  No?  Then stop your BS.  What BS?  ""...since there is no seeder i ask that you all wait until i or someone else has finished downloading this, and posts a review""  Cut the crap.  People will jump on a leech - and there is no guarantee you will stay and seed once finished.  And it's not ""air"", it's ""ERR"".  I suspect the 420 in your name has a little something to do with your logic.  What bad logic?  "" i will still purchase this game, simply because i have the money at the moment to. but im going to post pone purchasing it to get it this way, and share it with others...""  Get real.  If you were going to buy the game you can still do it.. get this... *while* downloading this release.

Or, just join a private tracker to avoid slow downloads.  Props to TL!"
,budskee420,2007-11-01T02:57Z,"umm no this game was released TODAY that is why i have been unable to purchase it as of today.... and yea i was skeptical and actually apologized on that comment aobut saying it was a fake and simply explained i personally wont be taking the chance of downloading a patch for a game that was just released TODAY. there was absolutely no reason for your dick comment and was just totally uncalled for. yes i am holding the purchased copy of the game in my hands right now and just decided to keep uploading because i am one of those rare"" nice"" people who like to do nice things for other people. i know that may piss you off, but you getting pissed at me because of my post on that patch is pretty ass hole-ish."
,budskee420,2007-11-01T03:01Z,"and i wont comment on your correction of my use of spelling/ grammar because thats school yard kid shit. and your right, there is no guarentee im going to seed when im done, but you seem to think me as a liar for saying that so i will ask you this..... what would i actually accomplish by saying that? how does it benifit me in any way to say lets not over saturate the download especially since there is no seeder right now?"
,Rif,2007-11-01T03:01Z,"Dude, you really need to do research before you post.

The clone for this was released a week ago.  Look it up.  TWO patches have been released already."
,Rif,2007-11-01T03:03Z,"Well, if less people downloaded, you'd get the same fractionated part *quicker*.

Since when do ""schoolyard"" kids use AIR for ERR? :P"
,budskee420,2007-11-01T03:07Z,sigh........ your right. i was referring to the actual retail version was not released until today..... but your right. and the school yard comment i made was int he context of it seemed unnecessary to attack my use of grammar or spelling. but i will swallow my pride and concede to you.
,budskee420,2007-11-01T03:08Z,so i am....... sorry. k? can we fuck and make up now?
,Rif,2007-11-01T03:12Z,"Maybe.  I pitch, you catch.

BTW, what the hell is an ""experienced downloader""?

Also, this release is based off of the clone - done a week ago.  Why would a store release mean anything?"
,Scervo,2007-11-01T03:15Z,Where the **** are all seeders???? 
,Scervo,2007-11-01T03:17Z,I had nice speed before now its so low ^_^ damn only at 25% now ... 
,budskee420,2007-11-01T03:18Z,"well lets see ive downloaded shivering isles, umm ARMA, DIRT racing, GTA: San andreas, hl2 episode 1, medal of honor airborne, command and conquer tiberium wars.......uhhh god so many more. i just meant ive downloaded a hellova lot of games is all. the only one ive ever had a problem with though is that painkiller FLT release. i have no idea what to do with the files."
,budskee420,2007-11-01T03:20Z,"BTW if you guys arent watching south park, you should be :)"
,Rif,2007-11-01T03:24Z,Associate the .001 to WinRAR.
,Rif,2007-11-01T03:25Z,@budskee420 - the above is for you.  Accidentally tabbed to the command button for submit by accident.
,budskee420,2007-11-01T03:27Z,omg im so glad i apologized to you :) i cant believe i didnt think of that. thanks man :)
,Rif,2007-11-01T03:49Z,"Nah, I should apologize.  I'm pissed that there isn't a crack for the Solidshield protection yet.  I loathe clones. :(  I was just being an ass."
,budskee420,2007-11-01T04:33Z,"awww i feel kinda gay right now :) anyway i just got painkiller installed(thanks to you Rif), but wont be able to play it with my bitlord blasting away. and it would seem that i have met my match as an ""experienced down loader"" and thats all ill metnion about painkiller seeing as this is for the witcher.  and whats this your talking about solid shield protection? is it like bioshock when it firts came out where it had all these little prgrams you had to get and run in order to get it installed? if so, maybe you sohuld give a lil tutorial on installing this seeing as your knowledge surpasses my own on this. because that bioshock crap gave me a headache for hours."
,Rif,2007-11-01T05:36Z,"It's Tages' new wrapper.  It's nasty.  It's nowhere as close to invasive as Starforce but games that have it (the newer versions) have taken awhile to crack.  DT Pro Adv with its vIDE is currently the only way to play (though some Vista users have gotten lucky).  You can snatch DT Pro Adv from here I thought or I can send you it.

No offense but seriously look into getting another BT client.  BitLord branched off of amidrelease of BitComet.  It tends to ""demand"" priority in BT applications and gets banned by other clients (and trackers!).  uTorrent and Azureus are pretty good (all versions of uTorrent and pre-Vuze for Azureus).  With these you can usually game while DL'ing.

Just a suggestion.  Not meaning to poke and prod. ^^"
,budskee420,2007-11-01T06:13Z,"huh, ok thanks. yea i always was very annoyed by my bitlord taking so many resources up and making my internet run soo slow when i may for example be downloading ONE thing at like 12 kb/s. that is kind of annoying. i mean i could understand it taking forever for me to load a page if i was downloading many things or something at like 200+ kb/s but most the time im not. its alot better for some odd reason tho w hen i seed/ upload which really doesnt make sense. so ill try azureus or u torrent for my next download.

Not bad for an AGP set up huh guys? well, im tired and am going off to take a nap, ill upload it at my max while i nap, and continue uploading tonight while i sleep. ill do this for maybe a few weeks to a month. hope you guys like the game, im loving it except for one thing. the combat is a lil iffy to get a  hang of but you forget about it pretty much as soon as your immersed into this awesome game world. so have fun guys and enjoy!"

(not that it matters much but an Asus A8v Deluxe motherboard) Using an Nvidia geforce 7800 GS OC,(AGP card, so i have an AGP set up- which is a soon to be outdated pc platform) and 2 gigs of RAM. i have been able to MAX my settings for this game with a 1400x1050 res. on my LCD monitor and shadows on medium and anistropic at 10x in stead of 16x........ thats it. i am like i said very pleasantly surprised by that concidering i have a 4-5 yer old pc now. and is it like oblivion?..... Well yes i guess int he fact that it is an imaginary game that takes place in an imaginary land........thats pretty much the only similarity. while your downloading this BRILLIANT release dy dopeman ( you da man and i broke in my withcer game earlier today if u know what i mean :P) but to get a good glimpse og the game just type in "" the witcher ign in google and check out the videos they got for it on ign. i find you will find yourself being unable to wait that much longer :) god i type alot. but i digress, dopeman i would totally have sex with you if it werent for that whole, you know, me being a man thing. cheers!"

,budskee420,2007-11-02T01:28Z,"hey your a smart guy, but i looked up your AXP 32bit 2800 which im guessing seeing as there were no completely 100% accurate reviews on that cpu i would have to say, MAYBE. I know im sorry for such a iffy answer. it looks as though our cpu's are KIND of similar and i really am kind of ignorant when it comes to ATI cards, seeing as i have had Nvidia ever since i started pc gaming. but seeing as it is a 256 MB card it would seem that the core clock and memory bus are higher than my card. so i think your pretty safe with that CARD, the processor i mean its a lil faster t han mine, so I mean this is just my opinion but making sure she has at least 2 gig RAM i THINK you should pretty good. But anyone else who has something to add to this, you know, feel free. i hope i kinda helped you, in a sort of small insignificant way."

Just read something about that error.

Seems, DT_PRO has conflicts with Intel RAID controllers, (not allowing loading or pc freezing when loading of images from a RAID setup.)

There are workarounds and fixes for this. Follow this thread.

,mcgoofenstein,2007-11-07T02:59Z,"ok, the reason why you people with decent pc's are experiencing a slow game is because you are running the thing through your virtual drive, which is always slow compared to a game that is cracked.  I dl'd this over like 4 days, and then realized that it didn't have a crack.  I just deleted it then, because I didn't feel like running it from the DT pro virtual drive, which is guaranteed low performance.

Regardless, day 1, The Witcher worked perfectly for me. The game is simply orgasmic, even with the delays and slow loading caused by a virtual drive.

Day 2, I booted up my computer, re-mounted the image in the IDE drive, and launched the game, just to get an error: Please insert original DVD.

The only thing I'm noticing that is at all different from yesterday is that my IDE drive said ""7:0 - IDE"" yesterday, and today it says ""4:0 - IDE"". I have no idea what that means.

Ok..so u just drag it to the DT pro directory and try to open it...and i get the error: Windows Cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.

I even try running DTPro.exe in the directory and i get error: The application or DLL C:Program Files\DAEMON Tools Pro\DTProHlp.dll is not a valid windows image. Please check this against your installation diskette.

Any help would be appriciated...thanks"
,playby,2007-11-10T11:31Z,"TO ALL OF THOSE WHO DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT AND MESSED UP FOLLOW THESE STEPS!

1. UNINSTALL DAEMON TOOL(THE ONE U FROM the witcher DIR)

2. DOWNLOAD THE LATEST DAEMONTOOLS FORM THIS LINK:- http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3821111/Daemon.Tools.Pro.Advanced.v4.10.0218-L33VaNcL33F

3. AFTER U FINISH DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING IT,

Start DT PRO and 'ADD a virtual IDE Drive', Go to -->Tools-->Add IDE Virtual Drive

IT MUST BE IDE DRIVE, NOT another ScSI Drive as DT sets up by default.

4. AFTER creating a virtual 'IDE' DRIVE, -mount 'NS-TW_SS-poseden.mds' to the **IDE DRIVE** you just created.
 Make sure the following emulations are ON and GREEN. 
-switches are on bottom of DT PRO proggie window-

 -Safedisc
 -SecuROM
 -LaserLok
 -RMPS

5. Install or (UPDATE) the latest DX9 from within the DirectX! folder by running DXSETUP.exe

 Install the Vc Runtimes by double-clicking 'vcredist_x86.exe' 

 VISTA 32bit users double-click 'Windows6.0-KB940105-x86.msu' to install an important Microsoft Update.

6. AFTER DOING ALL THESE STEPS successfully! 

cOPY THE F0LdER the witcher (WHICH U UNRAR) 
IN YOUR PROGRAM FILES (C:\Program Files)

7. Open the game folder.

 Double-Click regsetup.exe

 Start the game with launcher.exe

8. * AND THATS IT * 
*UR GOOD TO GO* REMEMBER TO DO THESE STEPS CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP!"

,enlighten86,2007-11-10T20:51Z,Fellow pirate friends! I DID IT! I downloaded dopemans release and couldn't install daemon advanced pro! When everything seemed lost i noticed the game said d3dx9_35 was missing and there is only up the d3dx9_34 in dll-files.com. So i downloaded that and simply changed the _34 to _35. Then i mounted the .mds file on my daemon 4.10 (not adv pro) with ALL EMULATION OPTIONS OFF! and simply clicked the launch.exe in the folder. AND IT WORKED! I recommend all vista users to follow my lead and DON'T INSTALL DAEMON ADV. PRO! The game looks gr8! Definately woth the w8!!!
,enlighten86,2007-11-10T20:58Z,"FOR VISTA USERS!

1. download
2. update dx, c++ and vista update
3. DO NOT install daemon adv. pro. instead download daemon 4.10!
4. mount the NS-TW_SS-poseden.mds file in daemon and change the device parameter to: DVD region 2!
5. Next click the launcher.exe and it should work!
6. If you are missing d3dx9_35... download d3dx_34 from www.dll-files.com and change it to _35! :P"

,PhantomRoRo,2007-11-30T12:08Z,use the crack at gamecopyworld.com it is the russian fixed exe but also works for this no lagging it works for me on a 2.3gh nvidia 6600

I have done all, i gave up on the mount thing since we have the fixed exe, i did all steps, moved ""the witcher"" folder or whatever over into c:program files.   and have also installed the windows update thing for virtual memory that was talked of..  i have read every note that has been put in about this torrent.  I can get the game to start up, it will let me choose difficulty and such and when i actually go to launch the game, it goes to a screen and says loading...   in the bottom left, and that is where it stops..  i can start it regularly with launcher or witcher.exe..doesnt matter, both work, but after picking difficulty level and such, when it should be loading the game so i can actually plays it, it just hangs on that screen,   all of my drivers are up to date,   i am downloading the .rar file again right now and am going to re-extract it, but beyond that, I got so close, but yet, it wont go...  it didnt work with daemon either, i got further along once i started using the fixed exe."

,Prosercunus,2007-12-01T01:21Z,"I gave up on this torrent, I got the same loading problems as everyone else.

Anyway I just bought the damn game via digital download (legitimate copy) and I will let everyone know if I get past the loading part in creating a new game (or loading a saved one).

move the crack into the system folder which is locted in your witcher folder.

Try it, worked for me

,fallout11,2007-12-06T00:44Z,"Okay gang, it took me a while and a lot of tinkering, but I got this to work for me.
1) Download this torrent.
2) Unrar the torrent. This rip is 1.1A.
3) Forget about Daemon Tools Pro.
4) Update your DirectX 9.0c to the most current version, using either Dopeman's supplied files or elsewhere. Very important.
5) Move the entire ""The Witcher"" directory to C:/Program Files/
6) Run regsetup.exe (lets windows know where the program bits are)
7) Get the Russian 1.1A cracked executable from Gamecopyworld.com or similar, and replace the witcher.exe file (in the witcher system directory) with it. Also copy the player.ini file into the system directory, if you so desire.
8) Run witcher.exe and follow any instructions you get.
Worked for me.

For those having the ""how do you feel"" problem, you need the 1.1A crack. I had the same issue, turns out I had the 1.0 crack instead, causing problems.

I can watch the totally kick ass video in the beginning, then i get to chose whether i want east medium hard, mouse or keyboard, and then it starts loading and goes to my desktop like nothing ever happened... is this because i dont have enough ram (which ill be getting soon) or because i need to patch which im doing now... any help before i resolve this myself???

,Sheriff2Murder,2007-12-11T17:01Z,"Ok, done some research, seems like the freeze at conversations is because the exe is for 1.0

But the only 1.1a exe out there... Does NOT work with vista it seems, any tips?
Oh.... and for those who suggested the editing the player.ini file.... there IS no player.ini file!"
,Sheriff2Murder,2007-12-11T17:36Z,"Finaly!
I found a weird but working solution.
There were originally no player.ini file.
So i added the one that came along with the  exe from GCW, the 1.1/1.1a.
I ran the game once, so it registered the new file.
Then i deleted the file again, and now it works fine!
This should fix it!"
,Sheriff2Murder,2007-12-11T17:37Z,Oh and you have to add the while in the system folder in the game dir before deleting it.
,Sheriff2Murder,2007-12-11T17:44Z,"Ok, nevermind that.
Seems like it at some rare, random occasions that it allows you to load, and it just allowed me that single time, didnt really fix it.

Btw i noticed that when it wont load, it shows a kind of wolf insignia instead of the art picture of the start place.(the gates etc)"
,Sheriff2Murder,2007-12-11T18:49Z,"Ok, last solution.

Just try and let it load over and over again, when it finally loads, play until where the mages appear, after that, it always loads."

I noticed when I reinstalled my OS's that Vista gave an almost identical error to XP (""This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem"") but it went away in Vista once all the drivers and latest updates were installed. If it is a driver or update problem, I can't for the life of me figure out which one. I've noticed two or three other people who had this error but i don't think they ever got a reply."
,Avenger1989,2007-12-13T03:17Z,"Right... Due an unexplainable series of events, the game is now working... I don't know whether to be frustrated or overjoyed though because the solution was something I had tried countless times before reformatting. I don't know how well the games running or if it crashes, but I'm soon to find out.

All I did was use the mini-image that was in the ""HERE_FIRST!"" directory with DT Pro, none of the switches toggled on (SafeDisc, SecuROM, LaserLok, RMPS or Hide CD-R)... 

But reading other people's comments I'm not sure if this is a lasting solution...

Avenger1989"
,Avenger1989,2007-12-13T10:05Z,"@iSteal4Fun: Yeah, I used the supplied DT Pro. Instead of choosing an image manually, do a scan with DT Pro (Second button from the left on the main window tool bar) and target that folder, it'll then give you the single file in the Image Catalog (It uses the .mds image). Mounting that one on an IDE Virtual Drive with all the toggles down the bottom turned off worked for me.

It seems that getting this working is completely different for each computer.

Madness.

Avenger1989"
,Avenger1989,2007-12-13T10:09Z,"Also: I had the problem that after some loading screens the game wouldn't do what I told it, it didn't crash or anything, Geralt just wouldn't move. I found that saving, returning to the main menu and loading again fixed this. It only seemed to happen in the part before the First Act. I'm not sure if it made any difference, but I turned autosave back on at the start of Act One and didn't have any more problems (Except the slightly longer load screens :P )

I download the file, when pressing ""download this torrent"" in like 3 secs, its 16.6 Kb only. Isnt it supposed to be 3.23 GiB??? 

Would anyone know why it does that, is it normal? Because, before downloading daemon tools, etc., I need to first download correctly this file."
,Avenger1989,2007-12-15T05:03Z,"Green_Ghost: If your running Vista you need to mount the .mds image file that is in the ""Here_First!"" folder with Daemon Tools Pro, which is also in that folder, alternatively you could download DT Lite from their website as several people have had problems with the supplied one. That should solve the disc error.

kalossimitar: Welcome to the wonderful world of torrents :P you will need to get a torrent downloading program like bitlord of utorrent which are free software. Then you open up the torrent file (16.5KB) with that and it will start downloading from people all over the world.

Any suggestions?   "
,Avenger1989,2007-12-16T04:24Z,"Green_Ghost: Ok. Have you tried a crack? Using DT to mount an image was the method Dopeman supplied before there was a crack produced, but there is one or two floating around now. www.gameburnworld.com or www.gamecopyworld.com. You'll need the v1.1 crack and it is in Russian (which doesn't matter), when you put the crack in the game folder/system (You'll want to keep a copy of the original .exe) you can then unmount the image from DT and try running it with the crack. 
Make sure to try witcher.exe, if that doesn't work run launcher.exe. I hope it works for you :)

no problems with the rip whatsoever. 

excellent job, Dopeman.

one of the better RPG's I've seen in a long time.

also, the new patch that just now came out for the game (1.2) that fixes the damn slow load/save times works just fine with this rip as well.

you can get the new patch here:

I found that saving, returning to the main menu and loading again fixed this. It only seemed to happen in the part before the First Act. I'm not sure if it made any difference, but I turned autosave back on at the start of Act One and didn't have any more problems (Except the slightly longer load screens :P )""

yes, i forgot to add...

do NOT use the player.ini file included to disable autosave.

it will break the game in exactly the way described above.

I don't know why the devs didn't include a functional toggle for turning autosaves on and off, but they didn't, and it's not even in the latest patch.

I somehow deleted the game, but it is SO GOOD that I'm willing to download it again!!
So, whoever is wondering whether to download or not - YES! By all means!! This is something Gothic 3 has never become, this game is huge and underrated, well not without its weaknesses, but they are rather minor to pay attention (ie bugs). The only thing I didn't like about this game is the time it takes to load scenes, even with my pretty heavy machine.

,nickademus24,2007-12-25T11:52Z,"ANYONE WHO ISK HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING THIS TO WORK ON VISTA READ HERE - 

1st unrar to same directory as download -

2nd Move ""The Witcher"" folder to c:program files

3rd Install updated directX in the folder you first created by extracting and then run regsetup which will be in the witcher folder(which you moved to program files)

4th Download Patch 1.2 from the game site, or where it downloads fastest.

5th Make sure you have DT pro installed and right click the Dt pro exe file and go to compatibility tab and click at the bottom ""run this program as an administrater""

6th Mount the image which came with this torrent(follow the instructions in the read me file)

7th Launch the game from the ""Witcher"".exe file in 'c:program files/The witcher/System'

Now it wil work.

If you still get the ""how do you feel"" errror (where it freezes) then do this - 

As soon as you have defeated the enemies you will see yellow writing appear saying something like ""quest updated"" as soon as you see this hit ""f5"" (autosave) after it has saved you will appear back in chat with the NPCs except this time you will be already pass the ""how do you feel"" text.

Thanks for the tip on moving the folder, I couldn't get it running before I did that :)

However, I still get the ""how do you feel"" lock-up bug. I tried quick saving like you said, but it doesn't do anything. When I press escape and try to save manually, the option is greyed out.

How did you do it?"
,EstimatedProphet,2007-12-25T20:59Z,"Ok actually I managed to do it by rapidly hitting F5 towards the end of the battle until it saved, I guess it must 'unlock' the save ability at some point.

But when it goes back to the game it hasn't skipped past the ""how do you feel"" bug which still occurs. I tried quitting and loading the save but the same thing happens."
,nickademus24,2007-12-26T12:24Z,"I did what I said, pressed f5 when the yellow text popped up. And yes you cant save at the beginning of the fight you do have to wait.

I see no menu text nor dialog. I unrared the game, got 1.1a russian crack from GCW. I looked in to HERE_FIRST but since the crack was out there I thought ""meh"". 

So the game started all fine, cutscenes playing, but as the video played I noticed a small ""EMPTY"" phrase coming out every now and then. Is there supposed to be a dialog there? 

I watched the whole video and when I got to the menu, I saw no text. Graphics were there but no text to be seen. I moved the mouse around and got this grey highlighted image. A bit torn image. Gamegraphics I assume.

I managed to get in game and it worked just fine, but thats where I stopped. Thought why play this if I cant see dialog or menutext. Something must be wrong here then.

The question is, is there any solution to this problem? I've browsed through these comments and only couple of guys had this ""no text"" problem. I've installed the C++ and directx9 that came with this. Even updated drivers. I get nothing.

Anyone, please? :)"

,padag,2007-12-30T02:32Z,"This is how I finally got the game working after 2 weeks of installing, unistalling, reistalling, registry cleaning, defragging, much tearing of hair and so on.

1. Unrar to the same directory as the download. (or as I did Unrar  to C:/Program Files/The Witcher- but don't have two directories called ""The Witcher""- otherwise the patch or regsetup may refer to the wrong files).

2. Copy ""The Witcher"" folder to C:/Program Files.

3.  Install the latest Direct X or UPDATE the latest DX9 by running ""DXSETUP.exe""from  the DirectX folder . No problems here!

4. Install the VisualC Runtime by double-clicking ""vcredist_x86.exe."" Couldn't install with the provided file so I downloaded it and ran it and it seems fine.

5. Open the game folder (ie C:/Program Files/The Witcher).

    Double-Click ""regsetup.exe"". (It runs only briefly and nothing much is seen - just a small flashing screen for a second or two).

    Download and update the game with patch 1.12

    Follow steps below for Daemon Tools Pro-then

6. Start the game with ""witcher.exe"" which is in  C:/Program Files/The Witcher/Systems folder. Make yourself a short-cut on the desktop, but don't forget to mount ""NS-TW_SS-poseden.mds"" each time you want to play.



@@@@@@@@@@@@Daemon Tools Pro@@@@@@@@@@@@

I had big problems with this install, but when I finally got it working its great!

 Uninstall ANY PREVIOUS VERSION of Daemon Tools and restart your PC.

 Double-Click 'DTPro4100218Advanced.exe' to install DT-PRO -latest version.

 Open 'Patch' folder & copy 'daemon.tools.pro.patch.exe' to your Daemon Tools Pro install directory and double-click to run the patch and crack DT PRo.

 Uninstallation note:
  * If you want to uninstall the application, delete the cracked cryptapi.dll
    and rename the original cryptapi_.dll to cryptapi.dll


 NOW. Start DT PRO - wait a few moments for it to install drivers!
and 'ADD a virtual IDE Drive, NOT another SCSI Drive which DT sets up by default.

 AFTER creating a virtual 'IDE' DRIVE, -mount NS-TW_SS-poseden.mds' in the IDE DRIVE you just created- then go back to step 6.

Note. Following the above steps seems to work perfectly with Windows XP, with full sound, and no bugs or glitches.- 

HOWEVER I could not get the game working with
-the earlier patches  -
-any of the cracked Witcher exe files available to date. The Russian 1.2 exe started Ok, but in Russian, then froze, presumably because the language files are missing.
-launcher.exe
-using any other directory for the game than ""C:/Program Files/The Witcher"".
-despite following the above instructions I could not get ""Daemon Tools Pro"" to install properly UNTIL I deleted three old links to previous installations of Daemon Tools in my C:\ directory, even though the program had been uninstalled and the directories had been deleted and the registry cleaned. I was able to mount the mds file in the latest Daemon Tools (Not the ""Pro"" version) but kept having errors).

Thanks to DOPEMAN for the files and NIKODAEMUS and to all those whose weary footsteps I followed in trying to get this going."

,trek1,2008-01-24T21:03Z,download the crack.so you dont have to install dpro.
,Litecode,2008-01-26T13:54Z,"Installation Instructions:

Ok, I will share this to you guys since this one worked for me. I'm using Windows XP Pro SP2. System is at least AMD Athlon 3300+, 512 ATI X1300, and 1Gig RAM.

You need to download 2 files. This one, the link provided by Dopeman and a NO-CD Crack v1.2 [Russian] from CGW.

Ok here goes...

1. Download first file from Dopeman. Unrar to wherever location you want, it doesn't matter where. It is important not to open any .exe file after you unrar. Or you will get bugged. It might take some time to unrar so proceed to step 2.

2. Download second file from CGW. File: The Witcher NO-CD Crack v1.2 [Russian]. The file name should be ""witcher.exe"" at least 2-3mb.

Assuming that you have finished to unrar the first file...

3. Go to the DirectX folder, open ""DXSETUP.exe"".

4. Open ""vcredist_x86.exe"".

5. Open ""regsetup.exe"". 

6. Locate the ""witcher.exe"" file within the folders and replace it with the NO-CD Crack.

7. Done. You don't have to reboot. You can now open ""witcher.exe"" or you can create a shortcut for it.

Big thanks to Dopeman for providing the game. Good luck guys and happy gaming. ;]"

 OPEN THE HERE_FIRST! FOLDER

 Uninstall ANY PREVIOUS VERSION Daemon Tools and restart your PC.

 Double-Click 'DTPro4100218Advanced.exe' to install DT-PRO -latest version., in DT_PRO folder.

 Open 'Patch' folder & copy 'daemon.tools.pro.patch.exe' to your Daemon Tools Pro install directory
 and double-click to run the patch and crack DT PRo.

 Uninstallation note:
  * If you want to uninstall the application, delete the cracked cryptapi.dll
    and rename the original cryptapi_.dll to cryptapi.dll




 NOW. Start DT PRO and 'ADD a virtual IDE Drive', Go to -->Tools-->Add IDE Virtual Drive
 IT MUST BE IDE DRIVE, NOT another ScSI Drive as DT sets up by default.

 AFTER creating a virtual 'IDE' DRIVE, -mount 'NS-TW_SS-poseden.mds' to the IDE DRIVE you just created.
 Make sure the following emulations are ON and GREEN. -switches are on bottom of DT PRO proggie window-

 -Safedisc
 -SecuROM
 -LaserLok
 -RMPS



 Install or (UPDATE) the latest DX9 from within the DirectX! folder by running DXSETUP.exe

 Install the Vc Runtimes by double-clicking 'vcredist_x86.exe' 

 VISTA 32bit users double-click 'Windows6.0-KB940105-x86.msu' to install an important Microsoft Update.


 Open the game folder.

 Double-Click regsetup.exe

 Start the game with launcher.exe



 When a crack is produced, simply copy the crack to the game directory, no more DT_PRO needed.

I installed this game yesterday and played for 3 hours. Works great, all you have to do is to follow the instuctions in the READ.ME!!.txt file

If you like medieval, magics, swords, potions and slaying monsters, then what are you waiting for? DOWNLOAD THIS NOW!

i admit thats its a strange way to set this game up but come on ppl.  once you mount the mdf file on a virtual IDE with DP-adv open up the witcher file that you extracted and doulbe click on the launcher.exe(do not make a shortcut). sometimes it takes a min for the start up screen to appear, then click play the fuckin game. if you decide to use the crack, that you must download separately, double click the witcher.exe and not the launcher.exe
for me i had to start it up twice the first time i installed it because i had no text to read. that was the first and only bug."

,Kelthazar,2008-06-19T01:16Z,"OK  I see ppl are having some problems, let me see if i can help u guys out...

For the, ""please insert DVD"" roblem, its because you are not mouting it properly on Daemon Tools, if u have it mounted properly, it would work fine. are u mounting it on the SLI drive or the IDE drive! this is important make sure it is on the IDE drive. and make sure u are mounting the right image. It should be, ""NS-TW-SS.mds""

For the Vizzima town loading problem, i cannt say for sure what it is, i have passeed Vizzima and i am on chapter 4 right now. My suggestion is you load from a prior point, and just redo where u are. (like reload form an autosave location)

For the, ""witcher has stopped working"", try this; 1.right click run as administrator. 2. if that doesnt work, try going into the installed directory, and make sure u have d3dx9_35.dll there. If u dnt just download it off google, that should fix that problem. this is the most common problem in ALL THE stopped working issue.

I hope this helps guys, good luck!"

,Rumour,2008-08-01T00:36Z,"GOOD NEWS PEOPLE!!

THERE IS NO NEED TO INSTALL DAEMONS TOOLS TO PLAY THE WITCHER TO GET AROUND THE TAGES PROTECTION SYSTEM.

The story goes like this I've played about a quarter of the way through The Witcher on an older computer using Daemon Tools Advanced and decided it was time to get a more powerful games system. 

The problem was my new computer (probably the OEM installed drivers) refuses to play with the latest DTA. My system hangs when it is installed (the STPD problem) and I can't even get to the desktop unless I uninstall DTA in safemode.

Woe me ...woe me I will never get to finish the Witcher. Damn, and it was good too. I tried everything to try and get DTA to work but to no avail (and I know my situation is not unique- just google Daemon tools+system hangs, among other problems). Soon the Witcher was becoming a distant memory...a happy memory.

That was until I updated my copy of UltraISO to ""UltraISO Premium Edition version 9.3.0.2600"". I know for a fact that my older 9.1 version could not play it in its one virtual drive (I think it was more designed for playing DVD.iso's than getting around games protections).

I was able to install The Witcher to my hard drive (load the .iso into the virtual drive and press the magnifying glass symbol by the side to autoplay The Witcher.iso). I then updated it to v1.2 patch and replaced the witcher.exe with a no-cd crack.  

I have no idea why it was able to work as UltraISO is not a dedicated games .iso emulator like DTA. BUT IT WORKS...DAMN IT...IT WORKS.

No more DTA for me. In contrast UltraISO is non-invasive on your system and I've had no incompatibility problems or issues with it at all.

NOTE: I'm not sure if Witcher.mdf format works with this program so play it safe and use a rip that is a Witcher.iso. I downloaded this copy of UltraISO with a serial no. You can get it anywhere on the web: most torrents. 

I won't divulge the exact site simply because there are some silly fuckers out there who think it's a great idea to start forum threads with good sites names posted all over it. Over exposing good non-torrent sites and getting them shut down in the process. 

Hail me for I am the new King...long live the KING...long live the King!.

BTW I got my version of The Witcher from 

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4236683/The_Witcher_iso__1.2_patch_censorship_patch(optional)_no-cd_crac

 -Go into the ""Witcher"" folder and run ""regsetup.exe"" It only takes a second.

After you have mounted ""NS-TW_SS-poseden"" with DEAMON Tools, go back into Program Files/The Witcher and double click on the launcher.exe and it should load the game. Make a shortcut of it to your desktop for quicker access.

And each time you run the game you have to make sure that the file ""NS-TW_SS-poseden"" is mounted in DAEMON Tools or it will ask for the disk."

- Extract the .rar: it leaves you with 2 folders. One called ""Witcher"" which contains of all the game data. And one called ""HERE_FIRST!"" which contains the image we need to mount and various other stuff like DirectX and DAEMON Tools pro AND the TROJAN patch for this DTPro.

- Run ""regsetup.exe"" from the ""Witcher""-folder. It only takes a second.

1- UNRAR THE FOLDER 'WITCHER'

1.1 IMPORTANT - Put the Witcher folder into Program Files. If you have the issue botchedup and I had, the launcher WILL NOT WORK if it is outside of Program Files. Someone mentioned this a few pages back, but it's still important!

2- UNRAR THE NS-TW_SS-poseden (IN HERE FIRST FOLDER) FILES TO WITCHER FOLDER
3-EXECUTE regsetup
4- DOWNLOAD DAEMON TOOL FROM http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads AND DOWLOAD TAGE DRIVES FROM http://www.tagesprotection.com/5.5/TagesSetup.exe and install them
5- mount the NS-TW_SS-poseden image in daemon tools
6- EXECUTE THE LAUCHER AND PLAY THE GAME !

-- Vista users may find a problem with 1.1 because of Vista's User Access Controls that prevent you from moving/changing/doing anything in Program Files. Here is one work-around that I used that didn't require restarting:

http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-quickie-vista-permissions

I still couldn't drag the folder into Program Files, but I could create a new folder and cut/paste the files that way. Now the game works 100%... or at least so far!
