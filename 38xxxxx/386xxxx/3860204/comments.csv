[V],velvetfog,2007-10-28T21:44Z,Please seed.  Everyone is stuck at 99.1%
,professorfuntime,2007-10-29T04:05Z,I'm glad I'm not the only one. My share ratio is 1.6% It says there's 90 peers what gives. I give what I take don't be greedy
[V],velvetfog,2007-10-29T19:42Z,"Everyone is still stuck at 99.1%.
This is the second day without a seeder."
,E___-._.-___3,2007-11-05T09:39Z,33 hopeful peers still at 99.1%.
,professorfuntime,2007-11-11T22:32Z,"too bad, this is one dead torrent. 99.1% that's ridiculous. I'd leave it alone if it was 55% or something like that but 99% fuck that sucks balls! "
,frecko25,2008-01-19T22:36Z,Could someone seed this? It stopped at 99.1%. Please? Pretty pretty please?
,momo2momo2,2008-02-12T13:46Z,looks like nobody cares about seeding this one... what a pitty for such an old great sci-fi movie.
