Sorry track 5 is only the demo, 30 seconds long but the rest of the album is great !!!"
,Wobble67,2007-11-01T00:10Z,"No passwords required, no spam, no virus. Just great music.
Please leave me your comments and if anyone has got a full copy of sweet talk (track 5) please seed.

Thanks"
,antz1986,2007-11-03T12:17Z,Why the 2 .wav files? great seed otherwise! :)
,Wobble67,2007-11-03T20:09Z,Sorry ..forgot to check all files were MP3 format before seeding.... got excited!!
,cam531,2007-11-07T00:42Z,"No, it's not a great seed. A demo isn't good enough. And don't add your own songs and call them a part of the album."
,Maximillian24,2007-11-07T18:43Z,This is much better than all the fakes out there. I would like LTBOTS non demo but oh well. All the other torrents out there are fakes.....
,BeeWeezy,2007-11-09T08:09Z,"Who cares if he added a few other B-Sides that he had, that only makes it a better B-Sides album. All of them are there! Thanks for putting this up man!"
,SuperSatan3,2007-11-09T21:50Z,"What album was ""tranquilize"" a part of? 
Is there a third album I don't know about?
I recognize some of these songs from Sam's Town and Hot Fuss."
