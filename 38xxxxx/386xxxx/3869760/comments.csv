,crackheadfred,2007-11-19T23:04Z,"Your basic downloading games and cracking them manual volume one

By Crackheadfred

When you download a game off pb or another torrent sites you normaly have one of two things (after you unzip it).

Iso files:
With an iso file mount it with deamon tools, and then run the installer on the 'disk'. This creates a  fake drive on your comp, so you dont even need a cd drive in the first place to install

Installer:
simply.... run it.

Now you have to crack it, if your lucky enough that the game came with a crack just do what the NFO file says, sometimes you just drop it in the game folder other times you run it and patch the game.

If you dident get a crack, sometimes the game is precracked and will run right off the bat or maybe it doesnt even need one at all. else wise go to gameburnworld.com and get yourself a crack. :)

hope that helps. "
,crackheadfred,2007-11-19T23:07Z,also please seed after your done downloading :)
