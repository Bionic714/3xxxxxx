,solidsnake2085,2007-10-31T21:35Z,"I'm getting about 600k so I have about 10 minutes to DL, and I just started the download haha"
,81hotrod,2007-10-31T23:57Z,I don't see it in the list but do you have the Tom Morello battle song?
,shredder85,2007-11-03T16:14Z,Thanks for uploading this! now to hunt down some of the funky music i never heard of until i played GH 3. (eric johnson and muse)
,zambaito,2007-11-11T08:22Z,is this the real versions of the songs or the cheap horrible covers by nobodies used in the game?
,rambo6699,2007-11-14T06:23Z,The music sounds like it was recorded from the game with a mic. Its horrible.
,Yoshipupdude,2007-11-14T13:22Z,"which songs specifically do u think sound bad quality, cuz i didnt record any of these songs personally. but if u notice any that are bad quality i will can get a better quality version of any of these and post a fixed torrent..."
,d1mm1,2007-11-16T20:58Z,"At least ""Dope - Nothing For Me Here"" is recorded with a mic during playing (bad quality, missed notes can be heard and in the end is sound of throwing guitar). I think there were also another song with the same problem but can't say for sure which one it was.

Anyway a great release, thanks!"
,Yoshipupdude,2007-11-19T01:26Z,"hey guys check out my torrent for all the rock band songs as well

,Jake_Watkins,2007-11-20T02:59Z,"AFI - Hey Miss Murder skips... a lot :p

That might be my computer. It doesn't seem to be running at 100% right now. Anyone having this problem?"
,___moonboy___,2007-11-30T22:22Z,There's only ONE little problem with this torrent... It's the biggest fake in the world... Yeah it is the songs but the kid have recorded when he plays it on guitar hero 3 AND HE SUCKS on it... You cant nearly hear whitch song you play... Fucking stupid ass wipp...
,puma0945,2007-12-08T05:51Z,song 72 is a french band
,Moonk11,2007-12-09T22:09Z,"Just like rambo6699  said..
Sounds like it's recorded with a mic.."
,Heiqal,2007-12-22T06:44Z,Would be better if all the song's volume is balanced.. 1 song's sound is slow and the other is damn loud
,LuckyMisterEpic,2007-12-28T13:15Z,"Somebody Have the real Dope - Nothing for me here :)??

On this file it's recorded xD Well after all... I just wanted Backyard Babies and Dope but the dope file here sucks XD~~ Well if u have it tell me plz :)"

,plein,2008-01-02T15:26Z,the seeding stopped for like a week when i had like 21%.. never started again.. i chose another..
,chauney,2008-01-24T10:11Z,"Very varying quality; Endless Sporadic - Impulse sounds like cardboard.. Dope - Nothing for me Here is a recording of someone playing Guitar Hero, and extremely poorly at that.

Not recommended for anyone who wants quality sound."
,music__lover,2008-03-28T20:58Z,"is it  enyone that have hero the theme song or what the name is
