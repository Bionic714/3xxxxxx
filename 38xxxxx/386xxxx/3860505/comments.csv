,l2uso,2007-10-28T06:18Z,"Yes, myself...
As I said in a post ( I think in Leopard post) there is not ATI Control Center (or at least I don't know if it exist on XP but with BC 1.4b & Vista it was). 
I didn't notice any new feature though. 
So far, so good :-D"
,shurley,2007-10-28T11:23Z,thanks! worked like a charm.
,Fredrokk,2007-10-28T17:03Z,"Yeps, got a blue screen at first when trying to install via the network from another computer, but when done properly it works!"
,rustyrivers,2007-10-29T18:51Z,"Hi l2uso,

Thanks for the upload.

I tried to install it on three different wndows xp verions because my macbook core2duo with leopard, wont give sound in windows.
for the rest everything works fine. Only no sound.
Maybe someone can guide me in the right direction. The audio drivers wont install."
,PeterHolbrook,2007-10-29T23:37Z,"If you've already downloaded the Leopard torrent, this one is completely useless. The Boot Camp installer and drivers are visible for Windows when you insert the double-layered DVD used to burn the Leopard DMG. Simply burn it using Disk Utility and you are done. No need for this torrent whatsoever. Use APPLE.MAC.OSX.LEOPARD.V10.5.ISO"
,l2uso,2007-10-30T03:52Z,"@PeterHolbrook@
That is the exact reason why I uploaded this: there are many people out there that have not DL burner at all, or they simple don't want to burn the ISO image, or simple don't know how to achieve that. It is possible you simply want to install windows and don't want Leopard, weird but all tastes are welcome...

@rustyrivers@
Really odd my friend. The only sugestion is to uninstall, restart and reinstall. Sound card is a MBP standard so this should work ""out the box"" or may I have to say ""before drivers install"" :-D
Are your sure your MBP's is ok or are you one of those unlucky guys with sound card issues in Mac OS X? Maybe a hardware fault? Try my sugestion and good luck dude... "
,s2dna,2007-11-01T14:19Z,Thx and your english is great.
,ultrapiratebuffer,2007-11-03T02:43Z,"good job. i did five leopard installs all using an external firewire-drive that might not work under windows without a driver!

so thank you mate :D"
,B-Zula,2007-11-03T18:49Z,Burned a SL DVD  and when it came to install vista drivers Vista didn't recognized the DVD so this is just what I needed. Thanks alot...
,frankcent,2007-11-07T20:35Z,"Are you still seeding? I cant find peers for some reason. Is it possible to upload this to rapid share?

I really need it because I deleted the original image file after I restored leopard on an external HD."

,teleport,2007-11-18T07:29Z,"I have APPLE.MAC.OSX.LEOPARD.V10.5.ISO  but cannot find those drivers with Pacifist, where are they ?"
,evillawngnome,2007-11-18T23:03Z,this torrent is ABSOLUTELY necessary. Why the fuck would i want to download all of leopard JUST so i can get the drivers to install XP? I must be one of the only people in the universe who wants to run XP  / vista exclusively on my macbook. This torrent is a godsend.
,mrJazz,2007-11-21T00:46Z,"Thanks ALOT! I installed Leopard from an external hard drive, and thus I couldn't locate the windows portion of the disc, using MacDrive. Couldn't have done this without you ;)"
,PeterHolbrook,2007-11-22T16:42Z,"Of course some of you can't find the drivers using Pacifist or MacDrive on the Leopard DL-DVD. The drivers are only visible FROM WINDOWS, not Leopard! Besides, if you have MacDrive installed on Windows and have set it to see the Mac structure of CDs/DVDs, you'll never see the Boot Camp drivers, as they are in the ISO part of the Leopard DVD, not the HFS part!"
,Diderik93,2007-11-23T15:50Z,"I downloaded it, and then... ""Put in the windows installing disc. You need a CD with original..."" WTF!!! It doesnt work witout the CD!! Could someone help me PLEASE!!

,digital2007,2007-12-21T04:11Z,"Sorry to for this question,
How i can install this bootcamp 2.0? Do in need to extract them before i install them?

It says that this is zip format, but seems like my Winzip doesn't recognize them.
Any help much appreciated "
,UncleUnko,2007-12-21T16:40Z,"I bought Leopard and I still want to DL this.  My MacPro DVD Drive does NOT mount or find any of the BootCamp files at all.  If I want Boot Camp I guess I will have to do it manually...  Which SUCKS!  But these files are necessary so again... Thanks for the upload!

i have succesfully installed leopard on

IT HAPPENED TO ME. IT IS NOT A JOKE. THIS WILL CRIPPLE YOUR BOOT FILES:
""invalid partition table""
WITH LUCK YOU CAN INSTALL VISTA BUT NO XP
if you have already installed... leopard is stuck on 60hz refresh rate with no ati drivers and it is IMPOSSIBLE OT RUN WINDOWS APPS ON IT. You will get error.

YOU RISK PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER WITH ANY LEOPARD INSTALLATION.
I am not a n00b and i will not touch os x again after what happened. I AM STILL UNABLE TO INSTALL XP and writing from vista

""invalid partition table"" at boot. BEWARE AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i had a perfect case install and still...

,BlindJestr,2008-01-15T03:46Z,"kgulaalex... did you read the Readme by any chance?

""The software on this disc is for use only with Boot Camp on an Intel-based Mac computer. To learn more about Boot Camp, refer to Mac Help.""

Sempron is an AMD processor man.

"
,kalemika,2008-01-15T20:10Z,"@kgulaalex:

Mac OS X has used HFS+ since it was created. There's no significant filesystem differences between 10.4 and 10.5.

The system you're describing is not an apple. OS X is not meant to run on a non-apple machine. It is entirely reasonable to expect that the differences in hardware (even on a BIOS level) could have caused your problem.

Don't complain when you use software in an untested and unsupported manner and break things."
,CaPolarBear,2008-01-20T20:43Z,"kgulaalex: You may not be a ""n00b"", but you are definitely an idiot.

You DIDN'T read what the installation is for. You also have no clue how to solve a problem that is actually pretty easily solved. Since you have Vista, you have net access so you can figure out how to fix the problem by surfing around and finding it. 

Your system is not physically damaged. Take it to someone who knows what they are doing and they will fix it for you. I hope they charge you lots of $$$."
,stoke34,2008-01-24T02:26Z,"wow. thank you SO much. i have a macbook and ive been trying over and over to get the drivers to run on windows. this is a godsend - keep up the great work.

kgulaalex, Go home and reboot yourself."
,peoplegeek,2008-03-08T10:37Z,I will seed this by FIOS all night. You leechs do the same.
,peoplegeek,2008-03-08T10:59Z,30 minutes later. It works 100% on my 2.2 10.5.2 MacBook with XP Pro SP2.  
,Simagu,2008-03-10T21:06Z,"This worked great, thanks a lot! It allowed me to run the latest version of bootcamp with Tiger, no need for leopard (I'm not ready to upgrade yet). Here's how to do it if you're wondering:

- Download boot camp beta 1.4 (still available here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3869786/BootCamp_1.4_beta)

- Change the date on your computer to early 2007 (change it back after all has installed)

- Run bootcamp assistant, follow instructions and install windows

- Run the bootcamp 2.0 Disk provided here and enjoy!"
,louzer,2008-03-24T17:19Z,"simagu

thanks for the info.

I was scared it wouldn't work on my macbook with tiger. I have bootcamp 1.4 but no leopard.
I'm downloading it. Hope it works."
,louzer,2008-03-24T17:22Z,"simagu

I've installed bootcamp 1.4 a couple of days ago. I'm also using tiger. But can I instal bootcamp 2.0 on my xp part? without deleting that part and reinstal windows?"
,kameyagi,2008-04-04T06:59Z,THAT IS ALL I NEED!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!
,karltech,2008-04-28T01:22Z,I'm assuming the 64bit drivers are only for the Mac Pro and not the Macbook (pro and non-pro). 
,karltech,2008-04-28T01:24Z,"kgulaalex, only an idiot would try to install drivers for hardware they don't own. 

Quite simple, its like having an ATI graphic card, downloading an Nvidia driver pack, then bitching that the nvidia driver's didn't make it work. "
,Freedom_142,2008-05-02T01:16Z,"i have tiger also, hope this works im downloading it now!"
,Yukimo,2008-05-15T13:11Z,Install and it freeze and fudge up my PC using Windows Vista 32 Bits!  Do not install this if you are using a Real PC!  Some of the Drivers in here are made for Mac only.  I only want the Apple Keyboard Driver since I'm using Apple Keyboard on my PC.  
,ptsapralis,2008-05-29T12:37Z,"l2uso, thanks very much for this (really)!... I just bought a MacBook Pro & I have been searching around the Internet for the last couple of days for these drivers and you seem to be the only who has given a clear solution. Thanks again!..."

Does anyone know of any good torrents for xp?"

This is for those of you who have ALREADY installed Windows on the Mac through BootCamp. These drivers allow the use of things such as the iSite and AirPort on the Mac. This will not install windows or BootCamp, just the drivers."

,TheSnaps,2010-02-01T19:46Z,"It's weird the drivers seem to be only partially working for me.  Boot camp manager installs and the internet works, but the graphics drivers, audio drivers and apple keyboard drives don't seem to be working, even though I didn't get any install errors while running the application.  I've got Leopard 10.5.8 and Vista Home Premium 32bit. Any clue as to what I'm doing wrong?"
,iTab,2010-06-22T20:46Z,"Can anyone help me here?
I just installed a fresh copy of windows XP on my Macbook (version 10.5.8). I installed using bootcamp on my windows side and everything went fine and windows works fine but as you know, I have no drivers and I can't use ethernet and all that fun stuff and it does not recognize sound, isight, yadda yadda. So, I downloaded this, but it won't work because it says I need a newer version of windows installer. And it asks me if I would like to update, but then it says that the required resource, 'UPDATE' is missing. -_- Anyone out there know what I need to do?"
,iTab,2010-06-22T22:03Z,"I have resolved my own problem. It took me about 10 hours to figure out how simple my problem really was. For reference to others: If you have windows xp (sp1), this will not work for you. You must have at least windows xp with sp2 installed when you create your windows side. If you only have windows xp (sp1) disk, then what you need to do is treamline sp2 into it. I found this site to be very useful: http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/windowsxp_sp2_slipstream.asp#nero
This guy makes it so easy. Just follow the instructions and it's all over and it should work fine."
,iTab,2010-06-23T19:21Z,"And now.. for more updates on this...
I now have a similar problem as TheSnaps. What I did worked and I was able to finally install the drivers using this torrent. But, just like TheSnaps, with my version being 10.5.8 as well but using windows xp (sp2), some of my things are not working. It found my iSight and I can now use my F1 keys and stuff to change that stuff, and sound, and maybe some other things, but it is not working for my ethernet or my video card. It now recognizes my USB ports better than it used to (don't ask. lol). But that is about it, really. I am guessing that this version 10.5.8 has done something with these things or something. I have no idea. Something to make them incompatible with windows. I really don't know. Does anyone know?"
,iTab,2010-06-24T06:20Z,"Ah finally. Peace and Joy. Everything works!!! Not everything on this torrent was quite compatible with what I needed but with lots of internet searching and other things, I was able to just find drivers that related to my hardware. I only needed to download 2 other drivers and they were both from nvidia. I downloaded nForce for my ethernet and some other things, and then I checked to see what video card I had on my mac side and then found a driver for it for xp. something verde or something like that. You may want to look into this TheSnaps if you are still having trouble. You said graphics and audio.. sounds like a potential nvidia to me. Thanks for the other drivers in this torrent and for the drivers that didn't work but pointed me in the right direction!"
,Lelouch_vi_Britannia,2011-03-21T17:30Z,"Worked great, all the drivers (the ones I use at least) are recognised and works.
However, I cannot seem to upgrade to 2.1 (meaning I cannot install SP3), which I have downloaded from the Apple site.

I keep getting this error message whenever I try to run the .msp file.
The upgrade patch cannot be installed by the windows installer service because the program to be upgraded maybe missing or the upgrade patch may update a different version of the program. verify that the program to be upgraded exist on your computer and that you have the correct upgrade patch.

Is it possible to repair the drivers with this?
Or is there something missing?

Thanks,
