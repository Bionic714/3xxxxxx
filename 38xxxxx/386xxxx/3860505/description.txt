This is the BootCamp 2.0 Windows drivers. Now, in Leopard, BootCamp moved the Windows drivers from the BootCamp application to a ISO part in Leopard install DVD. I just extracted 'em from the "Apple Mac OSX Leopard V10.5.ISO-OSX" seeded in here days before.

Zip format so you can install it directly in Windows or you can burn it on a CD for later use. Autorun present. Click Setup.exe to install if you have Autoplay cd on insertion turned off in Windows.

Sorry my english...
Sorry any troubles so this is my first torrent here...

Enjoy
