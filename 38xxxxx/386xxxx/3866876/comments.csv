,Garler,2009-01-26T01:55Z,what quality is this? I hate it when the uploader doesn't specify.
,Garler,2009-01-26T01:56Z,"Hopes and Fears CD is twice, I mean, wtf"
,pran1702,2010-02-14T19:31Z,thnxx
,kukuhri,2011-08-06T19:53Z,"Why should the uploader need to specify the quality of the recording if you can see it for yourself? Click on the number to the right of the ""Files:"" heading, observe the file extension and the size. Then look up the song to see the length. Easy math buddy."
,random07name,2011-11-18T05:01Z,"This torrent seems heavily poisoned or there is simply a large number of seeders with poor connections and corrupted data. Would not suggest, already wasted 8.8 Gb on the last 20 % , I say fuck that."
,pcfan5,2012-07-27T18:10Z,"the torrent is perfectly fine, and dowloads very fast."
