,LSOK,2008-01-23T04:38Z,LOGIN  and then look at the bottom of the screen it should say upload torrent. click on it and follow the instructions. It's pretty strait forward. If you have any q hit me up. 
,mehmetti,2008-01-23T19:38Z,Why advertise this as a 720p as it obviously isn't 720p? At least you list the video resolution as 1280 x 544

,wetlegs6,2008-04-26T16:21Z,"Mehmetti, the film is in letterbox format, therefore a V-RES of 544 IS 720p."
