,Zirak_90,2007-11-21T22:55Z,How in the world can this be a DVD screener? The other DVDSCR release was much better. This one is blurred.
,Pereubu,2007-11-23T05:42Z,"The sound is not the best but bearable . Vid quality OK.  However, for a Riddley Scott film its not that good - strangely slow and boring in places.  Thx to Ltt_Fr1  tho for the upload. "
,sean-nirvana,2007-11-25T11:43Z,"hey, just wonderin what media player you used, cause i used divx player and there's no sound at all"

,abisurd,2007-11-25T20:39Z,"@yeyo90***
It takes me 10 hours to download 700 MB of data at full 256 kbps, the best I can afford at rent of USD 25 plus 12% tax in India. This is why I like movies compressed to 700 MB."

,intoxicatedemon,2007-11-29T02:50Z,"So, be honest, should I wait for aXXo or anyone with a better copy? To answer the other questions, I use convertXtodvd for everything and have never had an issue with any converting or burning. Every other program I've used sucked. I will be looking for a good copy of this movie soon, so hit me up if anyone hears of anything. One more thing, does anyone know if Demonoid is coming back anytime soon?"

,djamu,2007-12-12T19:08Z,"to sqrpshr2 & all other noobs:

ANY movie is originally with 48000 kHz ( not Hz )
reason is very simple
as you know ( or should ) theater movies play at 24fps ( meaning 24 images / sec )
using 4800kHz audio means every video frame has 2000 audio samples ( 48000 / 24 )
I'm pretty sure you can do some math and try that with 44100.
I really dislike goons pretending to know something."

Also, how do I take something from a DvD and put it onto my computer so I can host it?
Any help is appreciated, thanks!"
