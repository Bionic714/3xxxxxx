,12inchsub,2009-09-03T05:05Z,"tobby83,  if you like 30 Seconds to Mars you may also like My Chemical Romance, The Used, Senses Fail, Hawthorn Hights(i think), maybe Linkin Park, Trapt, um... Taking Back Sunday, I cant think of any others right now.  Also a great way to find new music is go to pandora.com and create a ""station"" by typing in a group you like and it will play music similar to it."
