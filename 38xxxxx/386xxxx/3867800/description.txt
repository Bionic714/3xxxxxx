Flight Deck 5 for FS9 & FSX

1. Unpack with Winrar or whatever
2. Run FS9 or FSX installer
3. Use serial in included text file

THIS IS AWESOME! Remember how cheesy the FD4 planes were? The same planes are back but better. PLUS in FSX the carrier is the USS Gerald R. Ford, and it MOVES! That really fucks with you big time, trying to land on a moving carrier. Throw in some bad weather and/or nighttime and watch the pucker factor ratchet up.

I don't know if the carrier moves in FS9 or not, but still this is cool. The missions are great. 10/10.

Thank you,
