The speed on this is amazing... thanks to all of the seeders!"

Good program though. Thanks for the torrent.

I wish Mac had as many good code editors available as Windows - Crimson Editor, Notepad++, etc... Can you imagine those charging $50? And they don't lose out to TextMate in terms of features or usability. Anyway."
