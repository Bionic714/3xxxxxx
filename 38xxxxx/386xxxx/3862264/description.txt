Thanks to all the beta testers,everyone involved for without their effort this would not have been possible. Schrtom for Dosflash. Caster420 for firmtool. Keep up the good work everyone.

Note: The version is 1.1 due to internal changes, there was no public 1.0.
Dosflash: The only way to read and flash a Benq drive is with DosFlash(info) 1.3. There is a support thread here to help with users experiencing problems. It is recommended to try the dos16 version first. It ONLY supports VIA and NFORCE sata chipsets. When using a VIA card, please be sure to disable both your IDE and/or SATA chipsets as they usually interfere with dosflash.
