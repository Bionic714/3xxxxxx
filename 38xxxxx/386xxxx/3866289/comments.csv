As it is right now, a number of people only have 54.1% of all the files.

Remember, the files in your torrent don't magically distribute themselves across the net. When you create a torrent, make the commitment to keep your torrent software running and seeding (uploading) for as long as you can."

,Gamma Mike,2007-11-03T01:45Z,"No problem Banker, your torrent has already been fully seeded. I'll keep seeding for awhile myself...

I recommend uTorrent (it's not called [micro]Torrent for nothing!). I find that it uses very little system resources, yet it packs all the features you need.

And BTW, thanks for the episodes!"
,Italian_Banker,2007-11-03T03:34Z,"i'll probably change torrent programs before i buy RAM for this POS, but thanks for the advice. 
mike, does uTorrent allow you to creats torrents too. azureus makes it very easy. "
,SKpinkie,2007-11-13T03:54Z,YES! thank you!!! Finally a season one torrent that has seeders =.='
,Italian_Banker,2007-12-14T08:38Z,IT'S ACTUALLY SEASON 4.

,darylbe,2008-01-04T19:53Z,i recommend utorrent as well. i like it much more than azureus.
