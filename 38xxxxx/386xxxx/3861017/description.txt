This is a manuscript program where it works with MIDI synthesizers (Yes if you have Yamaha Keyboard and a good processor) and regular notation to make the music you really want. It's kind of like Garage Band on Macintosh but better. I'm still working on getting Sibelius 5 but most of the US centric torrent sites won't let Canadian users like me share the love (torrents).

Keygen, Tutorials, Setup file included :)
