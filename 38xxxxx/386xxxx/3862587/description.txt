D.L. Hughley delivers the laughs in his forth HBO specialty subtitled UNAPOLOGETIC, which was filmed in Washington DC. After the disastrous BOB SAGET: THAT AIN'T RIGHT, this comic confection was a breath of fresh air, offering an amusing look at topics that weren't terribly original, but Hughley's outlook and much more selective use of adult language works to much greater effect here than Saget. One of Hughley's favorite topics is male/female relationship and he gets off some on-target shots on this well-worn subject, and as always, shows his flare for spontaneity by goofing on members of the audience in the theater. The subject matter may not be strikingly original, but Hughley's twisted view and on-target delivery almost always works.
