You need an R4 or ds simply. Just google on those and you'll find what you need."
,kneel23,2007-12-09T06:00Z,"The Flash Focus rom does not work for me on DS-Xtreme card? It loads fine and plays the quick play and download games fine, but the regular game when you try to click to start it from the opening menu, it gives an error that ""the data could not be accessed, power off, remove the game card and reinsert it.""   However i have tried many different rom releases and checked them and re-downloaded them and they all behave the same. Anyone know why?"

1533 - Flipper Critter (USA) = 0917 - Flipper Critters (E)?

Your right about the others though, not sure how I missed them, they will be included in the next rom pack I release!"
