,Hazzaney,2007-10-27T00:14Z,"As pointless as the other torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3860147/Crysis_SP_DEMO

When I try to install, it requires a bloody serial.
I guess this is the pre-order demo as well.

So if you don't got a working serial for the pre-order demo. Don't waste your bandwidth on this download."

,Evil__Homer,2007-10-27T12:08Z,"I used the link provided by PLAYZONE to download and got a happy 400kb/sec avg speed.  1hr 15min to download.

Installs fine but I'm having problems playing it.  I checked my PC spec on systemrequirementslab.com and weas told I flew past the minimum requirements but failed the recommended.  I d'loaded anyway as it should still play but the graphics are messed up big time.  In the plane in the 1st scene I can only see the characters' eyes, nothing else. When freefalling I can see nothing even with night vision on.

My PC spec is:

E6750 running at 2 x 3.2Ghz
Nvidia 7600GT running at 725/800
Windows XP SP2
Creative Audigy 2ZS Sound Card
Newest Drivers installed

This is either down to a fault in the demo or my graphics card, but it should run fine on all low settings.  Damn, was really looking forward to this."
,GaGaG,2007-10-27T12:45Z,"Try the lastest nvidia beta drivers Evil__Homer, ""recommended driver for crysis single player demo"" http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_169.01.html"
,Evil__Homer,2007-10-27T18:04Z,"GaGaG - Cheers for the advice - Didn't solve my problem on it's own but certainly helped. I found I had to put all graphics settings up to High before I could get any sort of picture.  After the settings had re-loaded, I could then drop it back to medium where necessary to get a decent frame rate.

RAINSTICK - I reckon it's just a very temperamental demo - seems to work fine on some real low setups, but won't work on higher ones.  Seen lots of forums out there with ppl listing problems.

As for the game - I wasn't overly impressed - Just seems to be a tarted up version of Far Cry.  Infact, I think I might re-install that and play through it again!"
,wanda_5,2007-10-27T20:45Z,Link works. I have played that demo ~5 times today and I want more.
,wanda_5,2007-10-27T20:46Z,..five times through. From start to the end.
,OriginalFire,2007-10-27T22:27Z,"Is anyone else getting slow speeds? Like 0-2Kb...
:'(
Please seed.
Keep crysis alive :D

Thanks!"
