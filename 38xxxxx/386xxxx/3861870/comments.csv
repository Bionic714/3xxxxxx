,arainc,2007-10-29T08:14Z,"The quality was so-so.  It did blur out several times throughout the movie.  Sometimes it went dark for a minute or 2.  You get the gist of the storyline, but for such a movie where details are important to try to guess the plot.  

I was disappointed that whoever shot it didn't do it early in the day or at least turn off auto-focus.  And pay attention to the camera, not the movie.  You should watch the movie first, then bring the camera the second time and just concentrate on the filming.

So to summarize, it is a cam.  Do not expect perfection.  But this cam isn't worth it unless you are just DYING to see the movie.  It seems like many people have uploaded the SAME video several times, which is completely pointless.  The sound, 7/10 video 3.5/10.  

WAIT FOR A BETTER RELEASE, because you'll end up having to download a better one anyway if you are following the plot for replay value."
