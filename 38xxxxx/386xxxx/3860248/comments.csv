I don't know about the others, but I've never downloaded this much wrong file pieces so far!"
,ZodiacKillerSFPD,2007-11-25T02:44Z,I don't know much about this but somebody is probably seeding a fake copy of the game and every time you download from them you get the hashfail.  I think there's a list you can download that contains the IPs of those people so you can block them.

im on vista too and have had the same problem with crysis but there was a torrent that fixed it
i think that vista has a extra protection and security system stronger that xp even when you use daemon tools it doesnt work sometimes...
so i guess the solution is to ask for someone who has the fix and cross our fingures"
