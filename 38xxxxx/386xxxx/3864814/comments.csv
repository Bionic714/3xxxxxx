use http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3743137/dBpowerAMP_Music_Converter_Reference_v12.2_-_MP3_M4A_IPOD_WMA to convert to higher Bitrate if you desire. It preserves Album Art and ID3 tags while converting.

Thanks i'ma try this out!"
,hrtattx,2007-10-30T22:21Z,"good quality, the actual cd. all tracks. awesome!"
,kingjerm,2007-10-31T02:13Z,can't take the explicit off of the song title in itunes. has that happened to anyone else?
,kingjerm,2007-10-31T02:15Z,n/m. I was uploading and it wouldn't let me change the options! what a newbie mistake!
,blarkfasf,2007-11-01T02:12Z,"Uh, Mr. da_pimp123, you should be aware that one gains nothing by upconverting the bitrate of a compressed file. CD audio is ~1300-1400kbps, and when you create an mp3, you eliminate the bits that the mp3 algorithm deems unnecessary. You can't put these bits back - with only 256kbps of raw data to work with, you can't magically create 320kbps. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure you're not making your music sound worse instead of better."
,blarkfasf,2007-11-01T04:44Z,this calls for a blind listening test one day when i'm bored
,faelpsanfeel,2007-11-08T18:15Z,"if you honestly think that it's even physically possible to get better sound by converting a low bitrate to a high bitrate, then you're a fucking idiot and you need to be shot in the fucking face if you even think about uploading such a torrent.

Seriously, what the fuck people.  What the FUCK."
,faelpsanfeel,2007-11-08T18:42Z,"Incidentally-- and I don't have time to verify this for sure-- but I'd bet money that this particular upload is a transcode.  It sure does sound like one, and it sure does look like one in my spectrometer.

In fact, it's pretty fucking obvious that everyone is transcoding the same shitty itunes version.  Here's a hint people:  USE YOUR FUCKING EARS TO FIGURE OUT IF IT SOUNDS LIKE SHIT BEFORE YOU UPLOAD SOMETHING THX"
,faelpsanfeel,2007-11-09T02:06Z,Scratch that; this IS a transcode.  I know so for a fact.
,blarkfasf,2007-11-13T06:00Z,Right on sir!
,Paco Thaa Taco,2007-12-03T04:35Z,Damn this sucks...life without Oink...and the end of good quality music
