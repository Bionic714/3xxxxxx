i will correct this for the next disc.
my upload speed is 100kb/s however i get limited during peek times. am in UK."
[T],wormman,2007-11-01T15:08Z,Nice work carlitoB1. Now  it's time to delete the old one.
,duffyman72,2007-11-01T15:49Z,"Yeah, but make sure you shared it enough.

Carltio, what software did you use to remove the RCE?"
,carlitoB1,2007-11-01T15:56Z,"duffyman72, i explained on the original vol1 disc1 torrent, and yes, i will seed this for ages. i will put vol1 disc2 on here once this torrent is healthy enough for me to seed disc2 properly.
this is 100% working, tried on my ps3, xbox360 and my english locked dvd player."

thanks to john1974 and people who seed.
also i got the title wrong there's no 'the' in the title"
,carlitoB1,2007-11-02T12:13Z,"any1 know why it says seeders 0 and leechers 0 when i am seeding, and my utorrent says there's 121 leechers mostly at 55% so far.. ?"
,duffyman72,2007-11-03T17:23Z,I think its inaccurate the seeding thing. I've been seeding for two days now at a rate of 30kb
,duffyman72,2007-11-03T17:29Z,"Carlito, did you get Vol1 disc 2 working the same way? I just got the original working just after I downloaded this one. Now I'll seed both but keep the DVDS9 one. Let me know if it was the same method to make vol1disc 2 work. Cheers"
,carlitoB1,2007-11-03T20:18Z,"yes it was same method duffyman, bad way of doing thiings i know. i have now uploaded disc 2 as

TOM.&.JERRY.SPOTLIGHT.COLLECTION.REPLACEMENT.DVD5.V1.D2

ive taken the 'THE'  out of the title as it shouldnt be there.

I will now be using nearly all my upload bandwidth with the disc 2 upload untill there's other seeders."
,super_pipo,2008-03-07T07:20Z,Thnx for this carlitoB1.  I'll seed till 2:1 once I have the file.
