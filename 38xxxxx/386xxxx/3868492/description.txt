Background: When Warner Brothers relased \"Tom & Jerry - the Spotlight Collection, volume 1\" and later \"Tom & Jerry - the Spotlight Collection, volume 2\" on DVD, they promised that the cartoons would be uncensored and unedited. They lied, because all four discs in these two sets had cartoons that were censored, edited or both. WB decided to shut the fans up by issuing replacement disks to those that complained. This replacement program was (as usual) only available in USA so people from the rest of the world who bought the region 1 dvd\'s were screwed. Luckily, a dedicated fan decided to rip the contents of the replacement discs and put it on Bittorrent so everyone could get the bits they paid for.
