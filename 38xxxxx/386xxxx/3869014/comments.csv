Essentially these tools enable you with the ability to explore, zoom, and otherwise utilize fractals to make awesome images and sounds.

Fractal music (Fmusic) was tested to work and be incredibly addicting.

Fractal Forge was also tested and works great, and even has support for multiprocessor processing.

Fractal Harmonies was tested to work, and renders with a downward sweeping line, as opposed to the scattered block rendering, which is highly convenient at times.

Apophysis was tested and works quick.

ChaosPro works great, and despite its old school feel, offers a lot of options.

Fractal Explorer works except for the 3d aspect.  there is another newer version 2.02 which was already uploaded separately by this same user.  Either way goto http://www.eclectasy.com/Fractal-Explorer/download.htm for the library download or even the whole program.  (The library enable the 3d rendering)  This link replaces the link enclosed in this torrent, as the website is no longer available.


WinFrac was incompatible with win7, but should work on earlier architecture.

Program located at Fractal_Programsbzl041gbANG_16 and program located at Fractal_Programsdy-syst did not work with my 64bit system, but should work on a 32bit.  Unfortunately I am not sure what applications they are nor whether they have an x64 compatible version.  

Huge thanks for this upload!!!"
