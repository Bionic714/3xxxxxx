,instantcast,2009-08-10T01:23Z,"I've downloaded it and see that it's a poor quality amateur record. The camera is way too far from the stage, and the sound quality is that similar to a mobile phone ringtone.

I do believe that *some* people would be interested in this amateur record, nonetheless; but it's only fair to distinctly specify that it's ""amateur"" in the torrent's title or comments, so that people know what they're getting into before they start the download. The current title ""Metallica-Moscow 2007-DVD"" gives the misleading impression that it's a professional record, and unfortunately, a wasted time spent on downloading it for me."
