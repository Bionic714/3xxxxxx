not the best..bt"
,musikastor,2008-09-28T23:30Z,"No real English subs for this film. What a shame. I so much wanted to watch it. 
All the English subs suggested here are way too badly translated by either a poor translation software or someone with limited knowledge of English.
Thanks, zab3j, for sharing anyway."
,lanz637,2009-02-15T12:58Z,"This is a great movie.  Unapologetic and raw.
I used the subtitles earthlin supplied at ""
http://www.allsubs.org/subs-download/wilde-leben-das-english-subtitles/646116/"" 
Then used movie maker to join the two parts, CD1 & CD2 into one movie, then renamed the file to match the new name of the joined movie with the srt extention.
This works.  The translation isn't always great but its close enough."
