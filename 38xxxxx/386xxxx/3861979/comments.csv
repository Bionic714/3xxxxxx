,pab3925,2007-11-26T21:56Z,Does this work???
,warewolff,2007-12-08T17:37Z,Can't get this to work. After I instal this it only gives me an option to instal it again. No play option. 
,Deiz,2007-12-08T19:29Z,"Lucky you - You got it to install. I'm able to get 19% of the way through the installation, and then it hangs indefinitely. On an MP3, of all things."
,shadowlord44,2007-12-30T15:33Z,"DON'T USE the desktop launcher icon! It really doesn't work. Look for the other program files:
c:\Program Files\Stardock\TotalGaming\GalCiv2\DarkAvatar\GC2DarkAvatar.exe
c:\Program Files\Stardock\TotalGaming\GalCiv2\GalCiv2.exe
Create another shortcut or whatever, but these are the real game launcher executables. Boo."
,xlauvawke,2008-02-05T05:10Z,so is it safe to download and any confirmation if it works?
,Wolf Of Norway,2008-03-02T03:30Z,Yeah it works if you use the .exe's mentioned before. Don't use the desktop ones.
,Viikumi,2008-03-05T07:32Z,"Yes, the desktop shortcut doesn't work unless if you use those paths, but after that the game works perfectly."
,Magitasto,2008-03-23T00:01Z,"Holy damn, 436 kb/s to 450 kb/s, this is a kickass download."
,Magitasto,2008-03-23T00:03Z,"Ugh, the rest of mmy comment didn't get up for some reason, thanks for uploading this mate, and thanks for the .exe shadowlord."
,Red_Riding_Hoot,2008-04-25T18:03Z,"Perfect Torrent!
It is Dread lords if you start from
c:\Program Files\Stardock\TotalGaming\GalCiv2\GalCiv2.exe
and Dark Avatar if you start from
c:\Program Files\Stardock\TotalGaming\GalCiv2\DarkAvatar\GC2DarkAvatar.exe

No Need to down anything else, not the missing rars or other addons.
Nice Complete Package. Well I should get Dark Avatar now myself. ( DonÂ´t tell my Girlfriend hehe )"
,Sluggo40,2008-05-10T02:03Z,New to this.  Any help on installing?
,bbbenni,2008-05-12T22:12Z,"My mouse pointer keeps dissapearing when i play this, i have scanned it for viruses and it checks ok, can anybody explain why this happens for me please?"
,Manryn,2008-05-31T09:15Z,How do I even install this? I can find no .exe or .iso.
,Manryn,2008-05-31T09:32Z,And daemon tools doesn't even detect the extracted BIN file when i try to mount that.
,DanBlaze,2008-06-01T16:43Z,"marnyn: You have to keep the .bin and .cue in the same directory, and mount the .cue with daemon tools.

bbbenni: Ive had that happen. you have to move around w/o a mouse, and navigate to the settings, and enable 'hardware cursor'"
,oharaandrewlp,2008-06-05T16:41Z,"o.k. so no matter whether I use the launcher or indicated executables, I get a black patch covering the top-left portion of my screen and nothing else.

I've waited, but the game does not run."
,wiganath,2008-06-23T20:58Z,"Works perfectly, thanks.

Mount, Install, Run from Directory. Simple."
,born2befly,2008-06-28T21:48Z,Can this be mounted with Nero?  All that shows up is the image file.
,DonPatch,2008-08-01T23:57Z,THANK YOU SO MUCH TRAVELO2008!!!!!!!! YOU ROCk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
,dazedx8n,2008-08-04T06:43Z,"Waste of time. 100% does not work.
CD1 has an error on running."
,MANVO,2008-08-09T19:23Z,"Got this to work no problem. Just wondering though, has anyone got a way to update this to add the expansions?"
,seijison8,2008-09-01T06:14Z,"how do i get this to wk after i download the torrent? im a noob, sorry."

I AM HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM!!!
ANY SOLUTIONS?"
,ginger_ninjas4321,2008-09-10T03:08Z,Does this contain all the expansions? Thanks.
,worbat,2008-09-10T18:14Z,"So some one step by step guide me here, I just cannot figure this one out. How do I install it do I unpack all the rars or. what."
,tommyfats,2008-09-12T09:43Z,"for those who don't know what to do.

in each file cd1/cd2 there are a bunch of packed rars, highlight and extract the first one ( or any for that matter) and they will sequentially unpack as they are part of a single file. they unpack into a .bin and .cue file, just mount the cue to a virtual drive and install. :)"
,Icrine,2008-09-13T12:22Z,"If u use the autorun on vista it won't work, u nid to launch the setup.exe manually on the disc."
,HaRiKoINDIE,2008-09-14T06:03Z,"Thx, great seed 650 kb/s all through 35min it took. Will seed this a couple of days..."
,ginger_ninjas4321,2008-09-14T23:34Z,"Does anybody know where to find a serial/keygen for this, or even the 1.80c.096 update so I can run 'Twilight of the Arnor' properly? Thanks."
,bluedragonx,2008-10-06T10:40Z,"Help! It runs, I can navigate menus but when click on options menu or after a long loading it drops me out to desktop. I'd use patch? which?"
,osa1011,2008-10-16T07:09Z,"For those of you getting the black patch screen covering the top-left portion, I was getting the same error. I simply changed my revolution to a lower level, like 1024-768, and then launched the program. "
