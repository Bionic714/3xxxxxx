[T],supaturtle,2007-10-31T21:02Z,new features of v3: http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=guitarrig3new
[T],supaturtle,2007-10-31T22:31Z,"thx, for all your nice comments, dunno why i released this, arrggghhh"
,misterwookie,2007-11-01T02:34Z,thanks man! much appreciated
,Bengan6505,2007-11-02T07:09Z,Yeaaaahh Thanx u are the man
,fuckingfecalface,2007-11-02T20:12Z,"so...do you need the rig kontrol pedal shit for this to work?

cuz it doesn't want to for me
it loads fine, just my guitar doesn't play through this."
,avgjoe,2007-11-03T21:21Z,"awesome program - thanks for the upload.

Also... you guys need to know the following:

You will need:
A GUITAR
Some means to plug said guitar into your comptuer.
This can be done with USB/Firewire/or a Min-Din into your Line-In on your sound card.

USB/Firewire will mean you need a third party piece of hardware - like POD XT (google it)

Mini-Din is my 8 dollar rat-shack solution used with ASIO 4 ALL driver. It isn't anywhere near as clean and you will run into latency issues - but it was 8 bucks and it works. Its a 1/4""-Mini-Din converter so I can plug my guitar cable into the Line-IN on my computer - then with ASIO 4ALL (or if you have a high end sound card you should have this ASIO driver already) then futz with the driver settings  - and *poof* I have guitar playing through my headphones."
[T],supaturtle,2007-11-03T21:32Z,"yeah ur right, you need a preamp for the input signal and a good soundcard with nearly no latency, that's all ;)"
,djinkognito,2007-11-05T03:09Z,how do you crack this?
[T],supaturtle,2007-11-14T21:22Z,"me no cracked this, all credits to AMPLiFY, very good job. full registered version"
,UncleUnko,2007-11-21T09:16Z,"I use GuitarRig and Amplitube with this:
http://www.roland.com/products/en/UA-1000/index.html
and have 5 guitars, 2 studio mics, and a laptop (synth), all connected to both my MacProp 8core and my PeeCee.  Great box!  And as they just stopped making it the prices are dirt cheap till stock runs out anyway.  It used to be $1000 but I see it now for like $300 and $400 - highly recommended!

BTW, Amplitube is the same kind of software as GuitarRig but has a much richer sound. "
,jpiceman,2007-11-23T14:23Z,Thanks i love you man!!!!!!!!!!!
,DJ Playboy,2007-11-24T17:13Z,Can anyone Upload Uberschall trance id PLZ!!
,BLuNTeD,2007-11-25T17:34Z,"i have to disagree with u UncleUnko, ive used both amplitube and GR2 and i much prefer Guitar rig over  amplitube,,, the only good thing about amplitube is that it doesnt use as much system resources than GR2 ,,, ive tried out the demo of GR3, and it seemed to be a lot better than guitar rig 2,,, "
,BLuNTeD,2007-11-25T17:46Z,"btw,,, i forgot to say thanx for the upload,,, cant wait to try out the full version of this, as the demo version only lets u play for 30 minutes and then it closes down, and it never had all of the amp models/FX etc etc neither...

thanx man ;)"
,NuDub,2007-11-29T13:32Z,Thx it does works fine
,ooaar,2007-12-08T01:40Z,"this software looks awesome.
does anyone know if i can run my guitar through a preamp then into the line in on my sound card and use it like that
thanx"
,el_thompson,2007-12-11T15:14Z,"Great stuff, cheers. However, Digidesign's Eleven pisses all over all the other amp software out there. No built in pedals or fx, just amazing sounding amps. Had the 14 day demo and desperately tryin to find a crack. Unless anyone knows how to fuck with the license time limits on an iLok? "
,brat_pit,2007-12-12T12:46Z,"Hi all, do you thing i need also preamp for my e-mu 1820 soundcard and fender stratocaster? thx"
,ooaar,2007-12-12T19:10Z,"download ASIO4ALL like avgjoe said
it works for me
you'll need to preamp your guitar through your line in
there's some really serious latency issues (40ms!!)
but it gives you an idea of what this program sounds like.. and it is SWEET!!
just need to save up for an audio interface now"
,visibility,2007-12-16T08:57Z,Thanks for the app but I would suggest people don't download this. I have installed it 3 times and it works for a few minutes and the identifies itself as an unauthorised copy and closes. I have tried installing with and without the service centre and after completely cleaning the registry in between installations. I'm guessing it sends information to the NI website via the Internet.
,WhoseUrMammy,2007-12-16T14:41Z,"No serial, no keygen, program is full version but times out after 15 minutes....still looks great...."
,kkkao,2007-12-17T02:07Z,"NEEDS A CRACK FOR THIS, DOESN'T WORK FOR VERY LONG TIME"
,nuboo,2007-12-17T14:04Z,"Yeah, cant somebody find a link to a crack here, with only 10 mins each time its gets a bit frusturating."
[T],supaturtle,2007-12-27T20:49Z,"Yep, noticed that too, after the proggie worked for a couple of months , it seems that NI had found a way to search for illegal/cracked copies. Congrats NI, let?s open the next round ;)"
,randyrhoads,2007-12-28T13:15Z,hey can i play with this through my zoom g2.1u plugged into the usb ?? 
[T],supaturtle,2007-12-28T15:30Z,"the only way at the time to prevent the shutdown of GR is to set your system clock temp back: i.e. Nov. 5th.2007. works fine here. seems we have to wait for someone, who is able to crack the time limit. the proggie definitely doesn't make a home call. Seems  it's only a time limitation."
,DJ-Xter,2008-01-14T17:42Z,"A fix for the evaluation/time problem has been released from eld00d_cz: google ""/files/83082068/gr301.zip.html"" to find it. should be on rapidshare.
Been playing for Â˝ hour without any message! =D"

[T],supaturtle,2008-01-17T16:57Z,"yup, this really works like charm. many thanks to eld00d_cz, who've done this crack"

,replica1,2008-01-17T21:20Z,How do I get it to work?? I've pasted the guitarrig.dll in the guitarrig map.. Something else I need to do??
[T],supaturtle,2008-01-17T21:49Z,many thanks to DJ-Xter for finding this final solution

,NYCRocker,2008-01-26T00:05Z, Where is the guitarrig map?
,jormauotinen,2008-02-29T10:54Z,Does this work in Vista?
,BratAssociation,2008-05-16T01:52Z,"It works perfectly. Just follow instructions, download the crack from the other torrents listed, patch it up, and it sounds great. It works with FL studio 8."
,whysoserious_2008,2008-05-21T01:09Z,how can i use this? like could i use a line 6 riff tracker through the usb??
,crpnjoe,2008-06-22T00:44Z,"HELP!  When I try to install, I get an error claiming that the guitarrig.dll can't be found and/or installed.  Anyone know what's up with that?

THANKS>"
,crpnjoe,2008-06-22T01:59Z,Never mind...figured it out.  Thanks.
,TKDNissen,2008-07-01T20:13Z,cool men! awesome crack fix!
,steveo3242391,2008-07-09T21:29Z,"DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU FIRST START IT, AND IT WORKS, THEN I CLOSE IT, I START IT UP AGAIN, AND THEN THE AUDIO IS ALL CHOPPY.  SAME SETTINGS, EVENTHING IS FINE ON THE SETTINGS.  THIS ALSO HAPPENS WITH THE OTHER GUITAR RIG I DOWNLOADED."
,fuckvirus,2008-09-10T00:24Z,Is this the software edition?
,maliluha,2008-11-02T22:51Z,Thank you a lot man!!!! Works Great after using gr301.zip! Very nice software!
,Bysj,2009-03-18T00:11Z,"Thanks a lot for this torrent, works wonders. 

I have on question though: Why is it when I record with the FX>Crystalline setup, the recording is without the main sound effect? In other words: When I listen to the recorded wav file, why doesn't it sound anything like what I played? "
,Bysj,2009-03-18T00:48Z,"Nevermind, you have to use Tapedeck 2 to get all the effects. Nice :D"
,xebz,2009-05-03T15:19Z,"If yall liked this progg, try AmliTube. It will fuck you up!"
