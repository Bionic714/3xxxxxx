,Jasmo74,2008-04-15T03:52Z,"can anyone explain step by step because there is nothing in temp folder 
or if you have serial
I would appreciate
thanks"
,trevcart,2008-04-19T13:25Z,all you have to do is in the search box type - your user name\appdata\local\temp.  then you can open it up and sort it by date modified then just look for the folder and there you go.  hope this helps!
,trevcart,2008-04-19T14:34Z,"sorry you have to put users first. it should look like this

users\trevor\appdata\local\temp

this should work!"
,dotcomvictom,2008-06-01T23:37Z,"Thanks 4X-AXG, U R THE MAN!!! I just discovered your treasure chest of FS. I will gladly seed your stuff until I drop 

unless you advise otherwise, but first I need a little seeding help from your loyal followers.

Thanks soo much for the great upload :)> 

BTW, can anyone suggest where I can purchase some used HW (peddles, etc..) to play these little gems more efficently?"
