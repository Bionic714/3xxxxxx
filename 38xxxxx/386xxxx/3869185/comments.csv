,Kon-Foozed,2007-11-27T18:46Z,"Thanks for this, I'll seed what I've got (The first two albums but not Even If It Kills Me) for as long as possible :)"
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-01-17T04:22Z,"Commit this to memory is the clean version!!!!

Which is funny, because when you listen to L.G. Fuad, it says ""Let's Get up and die"".

but yeah, if you don't want the clean version try another torrent."
,pandasquirrel,2010-06-19T17:59Z,Awesome. Thanks a lot for the torrent. I'll try and seed for a bit.
,Benjiimon,2012-06-05T05:27Z,"The fact it was a clean album should have been labled. really annoying. Other two are good quality though. so if only two albums are worth the download to you, do it."
