Have hoped for years to see this Warhol movie, looked for stores to buy it in..looked all over, had lost the hope, and so, just browsing around here a little, and :-) here it is as full Dvd.. Thanks, and many of them :-)"
,Kulturgubbe,2007-11-02T17:42Z,"Once again, thanks :-) Going to be fun to watch when I got it..... I have a little question and a wish too :-). Since this one seems to be the Italian release that contains 2-disc (1 with the movie and 1 disc with interesting extras). It would be really nice of you (if you have the second ""extras disc"") if you have the possibility to also upload that one after finishing this (and a couple of peoples got this one and seeding it)...
Once again, many thanks for this litte treasure.... :-)"
[T],oddeven,2007-11-03T02:39Z,"If people truly seed this, I will try to put up the second disk.  Since I just started putting up stuff, I've been rather disappointed with the seed rate.  I finished one with about 60 seeders and shortly thereafter they just disappeared, leaving the same number of leechers for more than 10 hours. This is happening, more or less, with all the files I put up. 
Temmelig skuffet!
BTW I have Warhol's ""Vinyl"", a take on ""Clockwork Orange."" though a somewhat unprofessional copy."
,Kulturgubbe,2007-11-03T07:41Z,"to oddeven:
Thanks for the respons :-) I promise to seed when you put out the second disc of this.... Thanks in advance :-)
BTW: Seems you got some interesting movies :o)
Once again, thanks in advance, and Im gonna stay seeding :o)"

,schonberg,2007-11-18T11:43Z,"How do you burn the movie, in to one DVD disc?"
[T],oddeven,2007-11-18T12:03Z,"schonberg - Try downloading the free program DVDShrink, or 1click DVD copy , or even Nero (in the backup menu) should do it, since the regional encoding is already removed on this particular disc image.  I use DVDShrink for creating isos and for compressing DVDs, the other programs for other purposes, and for the rare occasion when DVDShrink can't figure something out. Of course, you could also buy a DVD9 and burn the whole thing on one disc (I've never done that! 'cause the discs are kinda dear)"
,schonberg,2007-11-18T14:02Z,"Thanks for the tip! I got a mac, and found a program called: DVD2oneX2 that i think, is similar to DVDShrink."
,murmelwurmel,2008-01-16T15:13Z,"I recommend DVDFab Platinum, it allows you to split a DVD-9 into two DVD-5s, that's pretty handy, especially with long movies you won't lose anything to compression."
,fivetwothree,2008-02-15T15:02Z,please reseed would really love to have this film! thank you.
,sereneskunk,2008-06-02T01:19Z,Anyone have the cover for this????????
,-roAch-,2008-07-23T16:15Z,"@oddeven:

could you please reseed GOD'S COUNTRY??
that would just make my day!
i have been desperate for that movie for a while,
it's hard to come by: can't even find it on the eMule network...

I would really appreciate your effort!

THX

,skunk-goddess,2012-03-19T06:21Z,I can see it was way way back when that you were going to make the effort - but please do put up the 2nd disc to Chelsea Girls (I'm assuming this is the Italian version double DVD that has no audio *frown* in the Marie Menken episode that you've uploaded).  It would be MUCH appreciated.  
,mouffette,2012-03-24T01:01Z,"Yes please!  I'd love to see the 2nd disc which includes

Disc 2 includes:
- the film Scenes From the Life of Andy Warhol by Jonas Mekas (36 min)
- a videothing by Enrico Ghezzi
- interview with Achille Bonito Oliva (Italian critic)
- interview with Mario Zonta
- Paul Morrissey meets Jonas Mekas (15 min)
all with English subtitle

Also if anyone has the proper cover for this treasure...  

I'd be more than glad to seed the file.  http://pixhost.me/avaxhome/fb/be/001dbefb.jpeg"
