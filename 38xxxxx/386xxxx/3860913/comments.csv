,xiIix,2008-06-17T06:03Z,"I had this on my DX2 66mhz as well. Remember running Janes ATF in DOS with the Janes ATF Toolkit? You could make your own weapons and planes. I used to make my own missiles, they would jink like drunk whores through the sky and have a blast radius of 4 miles. Fuckin hilarious. I totally wanna play that shit again."
