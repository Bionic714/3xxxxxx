Yesterday i saw that there were 2 seeders on all 3 dvd's   I have very high upload speeds   on completion i will either reup individually or make a big package and seed for a long time        IF they ever finish!!!!"

,FC5452,2008-01-15T05:40Z,"Has anyone gotten an error after install OCX also now when you go to boot fs9 you get a bglman.dll error. remove it and FS will boot.

SO my take on this is you have to move all the files to the FS add on scenery folder, then manually activate all the files correct?"
