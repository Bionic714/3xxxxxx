,darkheart84,2007-12-12T21:58Z,"Well, next time make sure you know where it's from and write the comment on their torrent... Thank to the uploader and I will continue to seed this as long as possible. "
,slutburgersforbreakfast,2008-01-08T02:03Z,Thanks. Much appreciated!
,JottePD,2008-02-10T18:17Z,"VisualBoyAdvance is the best EMU of all times (of couse when we're talking about GBA-roms)

For everyone who needs an EMU for SNES roms, I recomend Zsnes EMU :)
And for NES I recomend Nesticle (Enjoy)"
,Ravlor,2008-02-10T23:05Z,"You  should not download the emulator from torrents, use their website instead. Just google it."

,ll_TheAnswer_ll,2008-08-10T11:53Z,"""Thanks for putting them all in a single RAR file, so people can't pick just the games they want. I hate being free to choose for myself what to download, and hate the fact that the entire point of the torrent format is that it makes this possible.

Jackass.""

This."

As the FIRST line says: This is all Final fantasy games to GBA.

Read GBA.

Not anything else.
