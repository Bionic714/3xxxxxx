90's dance music mixed CD.

This CD was mixed by me, as I love the 90's music but didn't find a good mix with all the songs I like.

This CD contains 60 songs in 69 minutes, in a non-stop mix with about 1 minute of the main part of each song.

It is really great to sing along, if you know the songs (as a lot of people in their 30's should).
