,Almarenan,2007-10-29T19:42Z,"Yeah.

He post some very interesting stuff all right but does he seeds them ?"
,DrKoks,2007-10-29T19:51Z,"Thanks again madmax999 ,,, just keep it going ,,,"
,madmax999,2007-10-29T20:46Z,"I truly appreciate the feedback.  I have Duel in the Sun (2 files)finally ready.  Not one of my favorites but someone asked for it.  Also The Professionals, Alvarez Kelly, Harvey (the old Jimmy Stewart movie) are ready and I will have them posted this week.  Oh, and Cheyenne Autumn with Richard Widmark.

If anyone has a line on The Earthling with William Holden, please let me know.  Can't seem to find it."
,madmax999,2007-10-29T20:48Z,"LOL, yes I still have a problem getting the seeding set right.  Usually takes about 20 min.  What a marooooon. (Yes I have Bugs Bunny coming too.)"
,madmax999,2007-10-30T01:26Z,"Any advice on seeding will be appreciated. Truly, truly. 

I've been trying to keep 6-8 uploads going at a time.  I've been giving priority to the new items, but I've started re-seeding 2-3 of the old ones again. When it gets to no LE or 4-6 other seeders, I'm moving on to other files from my collection, from oldest to newest (posting).  Is this a good way to do it, or is there something better?"
,madmax999,2011-02-28T21:33Z,The Earthling! Got it on DVD now.  Will probably be a while before i can rip it.  Then it will be here.
