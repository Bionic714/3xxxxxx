Classic western with James Garner, Jason Robards and other great actors.

I like the way James Garner plays Wyatt Earp.  This is one of my favorite versions of Gunfight at the OK Corral.

Wide screen, color, english only, no subs, avi format.  Excellent quality.

Marshal Wyatt Earp kills a couple of men of the Clanton-gang in a fight. In revenge Clanton's thugs kill the marshal's brother. Thus, Wyatt Earp starts to chase the killers together with his friend Doc Holliday.
