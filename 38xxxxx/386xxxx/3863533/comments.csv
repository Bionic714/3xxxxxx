,DimwittedBum,2007-10-29T07:29Z,Forgot to add - This is the V1.1 trainer.  May not work with the unpatched version.  Tested out for a few minutes and seemed to be flawless. 
,OlderBudweiser,2007-10-29T16:29Z,"Forget this one,it doens't work with the latest patch...there's already a new patch out patch 1.1a and there's already a newer trainer out at cheathappens,but i don't want to pay 15$ just for one trainer :)"
,OlderBudweiser,2007-10-29T16:37Z,"Besides,this traiiner crashes the game when you try to trade with a merchant."
,Sarkterris,2007-10-29T20:49Z,"It annoys me that a real crack hasnt been made yet TT
"
,DimwittedBum,2007-10-30T05:07Z,"Crashing when trading with merchant was a prepatched problem.  I have had zero problems so far running with patch V1.1  So far for me there is no reason to patch again.  

There's another torrent here (and available as a direct download from a number of sites online) that patches to 1.1 only.

All in all - it works for me - just trying to save ya'll the $15.


PS.  Sarkterris - Wouldn't complain bout not having the crack just yet in the US - Game doesn't hit the shelves til tomorrow.  Some crackers actually like to use the real game to work with."

,OlderBudweiser,2007-10-30T07:51Z,so when we're gonna get the 1.1a trainer here?:D...My game  was automatically updated to the 1.1a patch...;Strange.... 
,sabman40,2007-11-01T03:47Z,Is there a chance that someone can add the 1.1a version of this trainer on pirate bay?
,AUniqueName,2007-11-01T05:41Z,"http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=5566

posted a request for 1.1a but it looks like anyone that has it has not seen it.
