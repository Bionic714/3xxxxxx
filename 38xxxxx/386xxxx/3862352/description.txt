Blurb:

'Speaking For Trees' is not your traditional music DVD. Take all thoughts of watching bands sweat through the ordeal of playing live, with cliched 'backstage' glimpses out of your mind - together Mark Borthwick and Cat Power have brought fragility and beauty to the medium.
Filmed all in one scene, the DVD shows Cat Power playing a wonderfully lush forest in Mexico, with crickets, tractors and birds as her only audience.
As she plays though songs from the last album and some cover versions, the viewer is transplanted to this tranquil, natural scene.
Loopy and unusual? Maybe. An open, vulnerable and an amazing piece of art? Most definitely.
Created, packaged and directed by experimental filmmaker and visual artist Mark Borthwick.
