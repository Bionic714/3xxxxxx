,_D3T0X_,2011-04-05T00:28Z,"To those who don't know how to install/run

Extract the last zipped part and it will extract all of them to one file. Run the file. It will install to your crysis game folder. If it doesn't find it, point it to the folder.

Once it has been installed, go to the Bin32 folder and run ""Editor"". Don't drag the icon to your desktop, just make a shortcut."
