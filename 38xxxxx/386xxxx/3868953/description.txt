Info/Comments:
When I originally heard that Universal was going to be re-releasing 'Nightflight To Venus' with bonus tracks earlier this year, I was actually excited.  I was expecting to hear the rare alternate versions available only on the original German pressings, rather than the edited versions that were found on the fourth pressing and the unremastered CD.  Sadly, I was to be dissapointed.  The 'bonus tracks' were of 'Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord' and 'Dancing In The Streets', two songs which I personally don't care for that much.  To make things worse, everything else on the remastered album was the same as the previous CD release, just overcompressed, which happens to too many albums these days.

I took it upon myself to collect the rarer versions of the 'Nightflight To Venus' songs.  In my search, many unexpected versions came out of the woodwork, all of which are compiled on to these two CD's worth of material.  The only version that I have not included is the 2nd Pressing version of 'Voodoonight', which was ommited due to the fact that I couldn't find it.  (However, the '2nd Verse Edit' on disc 1 includes the section from the 2nd pressing.)

Please note: I have only heard the 3rd and 4th (CD) pressings of this album beforehand, thus I can make no guarentees that the sources listed are accurate.  I have used the titles and information that accompanied the songs when I originally obtained them.  As well, the tracks listed as 'edits' were presumably edited by the person who provided them to me.  

Enjoy!
