,jeffmr,2007-11-02T04:36Z,No problem; glad you enjoyed this collection.
,sergmarin,2007-12-22T06:44Z,"I saw several songs in this collection which I remixed and cleared from vinyl noise by myself: Voodoonight (4.47), Nightflight TO Venus (1-st Pr.) etc. Where you get it?"
,jeffmr,2008-03-19T04:23Z,"sergmarin: Most of the rarer songs on this were emailed to me by a fellow fan... actually, I think YOU might have emailed them to me.  Your name looks very familiar.  Sorry for not giving credit!
Some others were found on various p2p programs."
