,Rycochet,2007-10-30T17:46Z,Remember there is a bug in it - make sure that Frostcrag is loaded *after* it as otherwise you will not be able to get into the magic shop without breaking in.

,Gimmik,2008-03-17T22:39Z,Thanks man. There now charging for this file... I bought it once and the installer decided to freak out on me because I have the no CD crack installed. Use the original Oblivion.exe for this to install correctly.

,Roland19303,2008-05-13T08:34Z,@Pennyvsaren I'm having no problems with bitcomet 1.0. its probably a personal vendetta of the tracker or person at the other end's client against your client. 
,Pennväsaren,2008-05-14T19:58Z,Changed client works fine now thanks for the tip man

,AeronPrometheus,2009-05-02T11:13Z,"@dongidoing

You don't get a note, just a map marker outside of Bruma. Walking up to the castle starts the mission surrounding it."
