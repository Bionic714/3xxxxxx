,JERRY_CURLJUICE,2008-01-12T15:02Z,what's up with the Spanish subtitles? Is there a way to get rid of them?
,Generacy,2008-01-14T01:51Z,"Yeah, I was really excited about downloading this, but the subtitles are really distracting.  There's no separate subtitle file so it looks like they're in the video.  If there's no way of turning them off, I'm not going to waste my time/bw to dl the rest."
