,johnny_ponny,2007-11-06T14:56Z,"On me it says ""Insert CD"" :S"
,Feanoir,2007-11-08T09:54Z,"I got the same problem with the insert cd, found a solution.
In the help file it explained that it has to be installed from the same drive as the 'old' one. I guess you already had some CS3 equipment (like me). I installed from a directory on my desktop, So I'll recommend you to copy the following files in a folder from the ISO:

Payloads   [DIR]
Resources [DIR]
Goodies    [DIR]
Redist       [DIR]
Setup.exe
Winbootstrapper1.cab
Winbootstrapper.msi

And start the setup.exe from the folder ofcourse.
If you installed from another cd/dvd-drive I say go to Manage of My Computer and swap the drive letters temporarly (from your daemon/alc120/etc... with the real drive). If you don't know how I recommend to let it do by someone who knows what I'm talking about =D

Last but not least... restart the pc and after that  copy the exe's located in the crack folder (on the ISO) over the orginal exe's installed on your harddrive.

If it doesn't work yet I don't know it either, because it worked for me so I didn't have to go further =D


Grtz Feanoir 

p.s. Let me know if it worked for you ;)"
,johnny_ponny,2007-11-12T16:38Z,"Doesn't work. 
Copied in to a folder in the Deskop.
Started setup.exe.
It says ""Insert CD""
I insert .iso file.
Still says it.
Tries other drives.
Still says it."
,ConanObrien,2007-11-21T12:57Z,"alright... I GOT IT!

since a bunch of idiots like myself are probably going to follow a link and look for an answer to the same question I have.... here's what I did to fix it.

I already had tried to install flash. but for whatever reason, it was installing under my Magic ISO drive :F, when I don't have that drive. Or it may have been my Virtual Clone Drive :F. Either way... Then ONLY THE FIRST FILE would install, and it kept looking under my F drive for the rest of the files, when they were on my E Drive. Anyways. I burnt the correct CD, with the Flash on it, with no subfolders. Just by drag and drop off my hard drive. .....Then I went into the control panel (vista) and changed my drive letter from E: (real drive) to F: (former virtual drive). Then deleted all previous flash installs.

Restarted.

Then did install again. from fresh. BINGO!

...should help. I hope I explained it correctly. feel free to email me if you have the save problem that I did (please insert adobe......). gwarslave10@gmail.com "

Yeah, it worked!! I really needed this damn program, so I'm glad.
Just created a folder in C:\Program Files\Adobe called Flash (but it doesn't matter what the name is), and copied the stuff named above there, and clicked setup in the Flash folder and it started. However, it took approx 40 mins to do the install (even with Pentium D CPU 3,20 ghz, and 1 GB Ram). But it works, so respect for df0ur and Feanoir."
,fedemart,2007-12-03T02:45Z,"Being clueless about the installing procedure I opened the winrar file part 01 and doubled clicked on the file inside and it opened Easy CD creator to burn a cd. 

I find myself with flash downloaded into my computer but donÂ´t know how to install it.

Maybe someone could help me out with the steps towards a successful installing experience.

I would really appreciate it."
