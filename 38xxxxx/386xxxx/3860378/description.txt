This is a short collection of instrumental tunes, made by a musically inclined teenager (me) in his spare time. Enjoy such semi-hits as We Love the Sunbeam and Oh Snowze, Part Two on this lovely mini-album!

It has been officially released for free by me, so don't feel guilty about downloading and rocking out!

Files are copied from the official SSS release file, and therefore are fully tagged. The album art is also included.
