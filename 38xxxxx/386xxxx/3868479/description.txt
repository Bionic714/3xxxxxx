Synopsis
Quincy Adams Wagstaff (Groucho) is the new president of Huxley College, but he sports a carefree attitude towards education and is convinced by his son (Zeppo) to recruit two lowlife football players in order to win the big game against the school rivals. Unfortunately, Wagstaff hires two goofups named Baravelli (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) by mistake. Can the wacky Marx Brothers pull out all the stops and win the game for Huxley, or will Wagstaff go down to ignominious defeat?
