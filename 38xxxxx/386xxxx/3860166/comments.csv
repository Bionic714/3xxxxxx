,IC_ISH,2007-10-27T02:51Z,hoe bedoel je?
,spunky1a,2007-10-27T12:43Z,"worst quality, no thx."
,IC_ISH,2007-10-28T04:39Z,"quality is about sourcefiles, these are just my own custom made dvdr's from my own collection,
i upload them for the dutch people who cant make their own DVDR.
reason i use divx is faster download times for my sources,when i'm gonna put my original dvd collection online ill use the DVD source for better quality for sure. 
quality of these releases are what everyone would get when putting divx to dvd. if you want top quality buy the originals ;)
besides...divx is alright at my 32inch screen, so  for the avarage dutch downloader who finds it difficult to get dutch subbed movies these will be good enough imho!

you dont have to like them, i dont care"
