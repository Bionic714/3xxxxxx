,NewportNews,2007-11-16T22:05Z,This torrent should support itself quite well from now on. I had a 5.00 share on it so I will retire from seeding now.

,guy_wild,2008-07-05T19:54Z,"It's a very nice torrent. 

Shame only that Gordons ever present swearing is *bleeped* out. Yup - not a 'fuck' in these torrents. Fucking USA censor.

Plus s03e07 is totally corrupt."
