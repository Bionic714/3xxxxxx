Wow, somehow I managed to get back in time. I am living in October 2007... :p"
[T],stevekasian,2007-10-27T04:32Z,"Pop Art! Where the hell have you been?? Did you go back to the future? I was hangin out in Feb '08 a while back, and I heard you had been lost in cyberspace in the Christmas Cyber Wars of 2007. Evidentally the news of your demise was greatly exaggerated, and untimely. Good to see you're still with us :)

SK"
,Mota77,2007-10-28T03:18Z,"ah dopeman, you never fail us! and for all those idiots bashing you, i says to them ""FUCK OFF!""... excuse me,  i naturally don't react like this, but it pisses me off when morons don't know what they're talking about... keep up the fantastic work, i'm always seeding!"
,halocog,2007-11-04T23:05Z,"we should all love dopeman- hes gave us all
a shitload of good games!

thanx!"
,Monkehtron,2007-11-15T22:03Z,"@ReaperManT: You aren't dopeman, your writing style is different. Plus from the sounds of it your ability to talk coherently is somewhat impaired.

For one thing ""and crack it"" is probably the most retarded phrase ever. Do you really think it's that easy? And UT3? It isn't even out yet you idiot.

If you want to bring us some decent games do so, and we'll listen to your infantile ramblings all you want.

Otherwise shut the fuck up and die.
