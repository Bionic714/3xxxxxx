,The 139,2007-11-04T16:44Z,To make it full screen just go to comaptibility and set it too 640x480 screen resolution.

,martix,2008-03-13T19:28Z,"A good tip is to visit: http://www.openttd.org/

They are trying to make new stuff in Transport tycoon :) but ull need this version first i think."
,cic_tare,2008-05-01T11:16Z,"hi! jib3, why TTDX PATCH2.exe isn't working? :-/
I have vista.
When i double click on TTDX PATCH2.exe and click ""unzip""(to C:\Windows\system), says :
""Can't creat output file: C:\Windows\system\DPLAY.DLL""

thanks for posible answer."
,Madassasin,2008-06-25T21:06Z,"Except that this is TTDPatch, and those aren't hidden settings, they're the patch settings.

www.ttdpatch.net -> get the beta or alpha version the stable is many years old."
,Sashco,2008-11-15T19:54Z,"aaah...works now :)

if you have Vista and dont know how to get this game to work, here is how:

Go to Windows/System32 and search for a file dplayx.dll

after you have located it, copy and paste it into your TTD directory.

Now change the name from dplayx.dll to dplay.dll and you are ready to rumble!

Enjoy! "
,uaelyag,2009-01-03T04:28Z,"Hi everybody, I think I must be pretty dumb. I cannot figure out how to load this file. I have tried the copy/paste/rename of dplay.dll etc but still everytime I double click the application files it says it cannot create output file. Any hints?"

,sminroff2681,2009-01-17T20:21Z,"Vista And windows 7 user you need to google the dplay.ddl file, after you have located it, copy and paste it into your TTD directory."

,maisiemoo,2009-01-19T13:15Z,"@sminroff

,fahdbhatti,2009-03-10T02:00Z,Finally after loads of efforts i've found a solution how to play this game in fullscreen simply go to the compatibility mode and choose there to run in win95 compatibility
,field33,2009-03-15T16:47Z,IÂ´m running under Ubuntu and I wanted a real game... So OpenTTD is the outcome ;-)
,T.DB,2009-06-06T21:34Z,Run the second patch as administrator to extract it...
,K-Bomb,2009-06-21T17:39Z,that goes pretty fast with 59 seeders :D

,mulldozer,2009-12-19T13:59Z,"To get TTD running for Vista/Win 7:
 - Run installer normally. Do not change the installation path for your own sake. 
 - Unzip patch1 normally. 
 - Unzip patch2 to ""c:\windows\system"" using Administrator rights -> right click on archive and choose 'Run as administrator'. 
 - Copy c:\windows\system\dplay.dll to c:\mps\ttdwin95 folder
 - Install the latest OpenTTD patch. Use this application to run OpenTTD. 

Have fun!"

,foliolio,2010-07-05T15:19Z,"saketsand:

Had the same problem, couldn't solve it. As I still insisted on playing this game, I did the following:

1) Download the latest OpenTTD from http://www.openttd.org/en/download-stable and unrar to desired directory.

2) Copy the following files from the TTD game directory into your OpenTTD/data -directory:

sample.cat
trg1r.grf 
trgcr.grf 
trghr.grf 
trgir.grf 
trgtr.grf 

also copy the folder gm from TTD-directory into OpenTTD directory.

3) Launch the game by doubleclicking the openttd executable.

4) Have fun. "

Just follow the instructions given on the notepad inside the downloaded file."
,Hero713,2012-04-18T08:34Z,"Thanks a lot.
Works great, i changed the directory of the game and did all what the notepad said, except for copying shortcut.
The executable files on Start Menu won't work. Instead of that i created a shortcut leads to ttdpatchw.exe on the game folder.
Great game. Thanks again"
