Synopsis
The film: Dracula 2000s clever and revealing update begins with team of techno-savvy thieves who break into a high-security vault, hoping to steal priceless artworks. To their utter disbelief, the vault instead hides a well-protected crypt, a crypt that has not been opened in 100 years, a crypt that will unleash Draculas ancient terror upon the modern world and all who come into contact with him. Dracula, freed at last from a century in confinement, finds himself in a 21st century of chaos and temptation, of Virgin record stores and subterranean nightclubs, where he fits right in. His first destination is the United States the ultimate location for his charismatic seductions of beautiful young women and his unceasing quest for power but there is another reason he has come here. Somewhere in New Orleans is a young woman Dracula must find... the only person on earth with whom he truly shares his dark legacy.
