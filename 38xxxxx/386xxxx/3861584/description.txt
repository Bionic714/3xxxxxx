You will be hard-pressed to find a band that brings to mind artists such as The Beatles, Radiohead, King Crimson and Sepultura as you listen to their record. 

The transitions, the textures, the almost exhausting task of following the notes in each song makes you wonder what kind of band can bring to life such a recording. Raleigh, N.C.-based Between the Buried and Me (BTBAM) are such a band and they present their latest exploration, Colors (Victory Records).  

Produced once again by Jamie King (The Human Abstract, Beloved, Through the Eyes of the Dead) BTBAM bring even more complexity and mood from its last release Alaska.

Between the Buried and Me are challenging listeners to venture into its more complex and textured music. Do not let the mathematical tags scare you. This is a definitely an album that isn?t so out there that you can?t enjoy it. This album is definitely recommended.
