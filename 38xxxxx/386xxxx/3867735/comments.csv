American.Gangster.DVD.SCREENER.XViD-PUKKA.3856439.TPB.torrent"
,rvd4always,2007-11-09T11:00Z,"yearasta,  if they ask you to use a password to open the movie, just throw the movie away.

They just want to have you email so they can spam you. 

Real pukka movies dont ask for a password.
If the ask for a password then its fake!"
,rvd4always,2007-11-09T11:04Z,"At 071108 i wrote that it was a good screener but it turns out to be a fake torrent!
I made a mistake to write ""good screener"" at the wrong torrent! There were so many torrents of american gangster that i wrote it at the wrong torrent, sorry for that!"
