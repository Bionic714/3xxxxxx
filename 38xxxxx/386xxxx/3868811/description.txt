This is something what could be useful for recovering damaged (or scratched) disks, CDs, and so on.

AnyReader is great for copying files from scratched CD/DVDs or defective floppy/hard disks. Normally when your computer is unable to copy files from a damaged disk it will abort and delete the part of the file it has copied. AnyReader will continue copying the file right to the end; any data that hasn?t been recovered after several retries is replaced with blanks. This will allow you to effectively read every byte of information that can be read at all.

Here are some situations where AnyReader can help:

    *

      Your CD/DVD drive can?t read your bad, scratched or trashed disks;
    * The standard copying method fails because of an error, such as ?(Bad CRC) A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum error occurred?, ?Cannot read from the source file or disk?, an unknown error or a bad disk;
    * You have 2 bad copies of a file that you would like to put right;
    * You can?t download a file across wireless LAN because of a bad connection;
    * And many more of those?
