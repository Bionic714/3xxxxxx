great torrent"
,JD74,2007-10-30T04:05Z,"It's too bad that PASSWORD'd Torrents can't be NUKED by an Admin.

Password protecting a file, with SPAM-shit instructions on how to get the password is a bunch of crap and completely defeats the purpose of file sharing.........

People that upload such torrents should be KICKED/BANNED......simple as that."

If I want to go to your website, I will go to your fucking website! Don't make it some stupid ass requirement just to get a song or a movie. I love having a normal torrent like this one!"
