Genre: Funk / Soul

A great funky mix from two great DJs! One of my all-time favorite mix albums.


"Tight and well chosen jazz, funk and rare groove mix by legendary NY club APT. DJs who made the place a hot club with frequent guests Spinna, Muro and Kenny Dope, one of the original diggin / mixtape DJs in the game !"

SEED and Enjoy! [Cubilas]
