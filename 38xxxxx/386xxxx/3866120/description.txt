Original score for Terry Gilliam's 1985 Oscar-nominated film, "Brazil," conducted by Michael Kamen and played by the National Philharmonic Orchestra of London. Some clips from the film are included on the CD, but by far my favorite are all the different incarnations of the film's theme. Which, by the way, what DOES "Brazil" actually have to do with, you know, Brazil? I may never know.
