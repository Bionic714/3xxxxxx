And to answer your question, Brazil is a place where the main character of the movie has never been, and will never be, but he dreams about being there all the time, because from listening to the the song ""Brazil"" he imagines it to be a happy and romantic place - totally opposite to the world he lives in.

Basically, his happy dreams (flying etc.) shows us the way he imagines Brazil to be."
,hogscape,2008-11-27T08:05Z,I had heard that the movies original title was intended to be '1984-and-a-half' but the Orwell trust considered that a breach of its IP. Gilliam couldn't come up with a better title than that of the score. I prefer MeatTycoons version though...
,skeldoy,2009-01-12T18:41Z,".. And Getulio Vargas, who was the dictator of Brazil from 1930 to 1954 (when he killed himself) really liked the song - he probably thought it was a fitting description of the nationalist dictatorship which was Brazil at the time.. So I think the song is spot on. I hum it whenever I think ppl at my work place get too bureaucratic. ;)"
