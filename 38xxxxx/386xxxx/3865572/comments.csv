,labrat72,2007-11-12T00:17Z,"Video Quality=5/10
Audio Quality=5.5/10

Video appears to be compressed too much. A little better than VCD.  Audio, although DD 5.1, is overpowering.

Just my opinion -- not a complaint.  I appreciate the upload.  I've downloaded several of Ltt_Fr1's previous flix and have been very impressed."
