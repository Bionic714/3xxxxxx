FS Global 2008 is a completely new product for flight sim fans. The scenery is more realistic than ever - it uses new worldwide Mesh Terrain data to create incredible mountain peaks and deep, scenic valley plunges. This scenery is based on the \\\'Shuttle Radar Topography Mission\\\' (SRTM) -- information collected by the Space Shuttle \\\"Endeavour.\\\" The latest version of this data (released at the end of 2006) is combined with various sources to build one of the most detailed mesh sceneries for Flight Simulator available yet!
