Thanks a lot for all the addons. I'll try and seed them for a long time until my computer crashes. "
,kalaki,2007-11-01T01:24Z,Compatible with FSX?
,stiffeg,2007-11-01T13:05Z,"No only with fs2004 :)

It is a fsx version on TPB but the people says it is not working or a missing file."
,kalaki,2007-11-01T23:24Z,"thanks, that could have been a painful download ;)"
,ricko16,2007-11-02T09:02Z,Keep seeding I really want it thx
,allen_x,2007-11-02T18:47Z,"really hard to download here but worth it, thanks."
,spesseh,2007-11-04T01:09Z,Please continue seeding after you have downloaded. Thanks for sharing!
,samayot,2007-11-05T20:29Z,"Seed, I am stuck at 39.5% for two days. I am very very very unhappy and I will be angry ..."
,spesseh,2007-11-06T10:18Z,Who cares? Everyone have to wait as there is only one seeder which is extremely slow.
,gijoao,2007-11-06T17:35Z,"Sorry for the slow speed but once more people seed then it will be faster.
"
,Magerna,2007-11-07T00:04Z,"I have no problem with low speed, as long you don't give up the seeding until it has made the round :) . You are the hero for sure!

I have eagerly waited for this one since I heard of it.

Flying without FSG is somehow impossible to me (looks just so bad....), and 2005 does the trick, but has quite some annoying bugs in it (especially with airport elevations).

Thanks man :)"
,stiffeg,2007-11-09T15:49Z,"seed!seed!

I'm on about 60 % on the 3 dvd's"
,tom2krass,2007-11-09T15:50Z,Hey folks. everybody should give more upload speed. i am going out with 400 kb/s for the 3 DVD´s. If you don´t give more speed it will last over a year. And if your file is ready you should seed for the others. That is the most important thing   
,YuriyS,2007-11-11T09:35Z,"Thank You very much from Russia! But why it is so slow? I am get stack with first DVD on 63%.
Dear Seed! Check out please, are the ""Super seed"" or ""Initial Seeding"" options in your torrent-client are ON...
And so. One more thank you!"
,YuriyS,2007-11-11T09:41Z,"And one more idea. Maybe it will better if you will seed just one DVD (I think first DVD should be the first) decpite of seeding all 3 DVDs?
I will seed, but firstly I have to download one of the DVD..."
,mr.arne,2007-11-11T14:16Z,"Thanks for sharing, but please, we need more seeders!"
,OnTime_76,2007-11-11T16:32Z,"I am slowly getting them at about 10/kbs, I dont understand why people will not stay on after completion. Yesterday i saw that there were 2 seeders on all 3 dvd's   I have very high upload speeds   on completion i will either reup individually or make a big package and seed for a long time        IF they ever finish!!!!"
,YuriyS,2007-11-11T18:21Z,"2 OnTime_76

Please, do not make big package, if you get it! Just reseed, if there is some free space on your hdd
And thank you for your post!"
,OnTime_76,2007-11-12T00:58Z,"Yeah      after i thought about it, making a big package would not be the smartest thing i have ever done. But none the less i will make the reup on completion as i will be flying out to Tegucigalpa for 9 days and will just leave the torrents running.    Hope its done soon!!    im at 66.4%, 77.1%, and 73.2% as of 5:58PM CST"
,Joker4us,2007-11-14T09:13Z," Guys ..i have 75,8%..82,9% and 85,6% i will seed as long as you want when i get it. SO guys PLZ stay and SEED when you got the DVD's.  And Gijoao...You are the guy

Thanks for this"
,gijoao,2007-11-14T15:27Z,I don't upload one at a time because then my other programs i download will take up the rest of the bandwidth for upload. So its better to keep all three running and the band width goes for global 2008. Btw its fantastic addon. Love it.
,YuriyS,2007-11-14T20:32Z,"I think it will be better, if uploader will seed for a few number of leechers (5-10). Then the overall speed will be higher. IMHO."
,allen_x,2007-11-14T21:02Z,"I'm happy with mine, not a long way to go anymore."
,tom2krass,2007-11-16T15:30Z,Hey what the fuck is going on. Go on seeding i am about 97percent. when I´m finished i will go on seeding it. so come on give me speed. 
,gijoao,2007-11-16T17:25Z,"Seeding one at a time. Will seed dvd 2 and 3 only when i begin to see other seeders. No free ride.

make aure its shared as quick as possible"
,tom2krass,2007-11-17T12:56Z,"everyone should activate ""InitialSeeding"". this will speed up everyone´s download. the more you load up the more you can download. "
,OnTime_76,2007-11-17T21:18Z,If someone wants me to re-up these with good speeds let me know...   they are ready whenever
,alexanderkaegi,2007-11-18T12:57Z,After installing DVD1 it says that i have to put in the DVD2!!! What the fuck!? how can I continue the installation?
,gijoao,2007-11-18T15:46Z,"There are 3 dvd's. That's why it says put on dvd2. All three have to be installed.

How many of you have finished at least one dvd?"
,OnTime_76,2007-11-18T15:51Z,I have them all installed
,alexanderkaegi,2007-11-18T21:59Z,"But gijoao, I haven´t any dvds!!?? Thats why I downloaded this!
How can i get the installation go on?"
,OnTime_76,2007-11-18T23:12Z,"Are you kidding me?   Must be your first download, try doing some research on ISO files.
on the other hand, to show that im not a complete dick, try using power iso, daemon tools, magic iso, or alcohol 120%  All can be found here at TPB.  Use your nogin."
,alexanderkaegi,2007-11-19T22:35Z,"What does mean ""try using""???
What have I exactly to do?"
,Pochoclo,2007-11-25T05:39Z,REQ: Active Camera 2.1 for FS9.1
,gijoao,2007-11-26T17:30Z,"Anyone need the FSX version?
Should i upload that one?"
,limewireX2,2007-11-30T19:59Z,Great game but i problem .. everytime i try to install it a windows pops up flight simulator X is missing aborting and the installation closes down =( what should i do?? .. plz help
,RingoChris,2007-12-06T00:51Z,"I have downloaded all three dvd's, but it seems you need an earlier version to upgrade to this one...either fs 2002 or fs 2004. Is this correct?
Thanks"
,rolus,2008-08-30T12:41Z,I am ATM seeding all 3 DVD's at 3.2MB/s
,codgecodge,2008-09-24T02:53Z,"Ok that answers my qusetion in the DVD2 thread-I need all 3 discs. I am using Bitlord and don't seem to be able to control how many I seed. I am D/Ling on a 20 GBdrive so have little room. My new 500gb Extrenal HDD arrived this morning. I will reinstall Bitlord on it and then put this torrent back on it for seeding the rest of everyone here-so don't cut me off if you see me drop out (temporarily) when I have 100%.
Thank you for these DVDs very much gijao."
,me1900,2008-10-30T05:17Z,HEY PEOPLE THINK!!!! VERY FEW SEEDERS ON THESE 3 DVD's!!! THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO UPLOAD AT LEAST 40 kbps!!!!!! IF THERE WAS MORE THEN 200 THEN I CAN SEE LOW LIMIT UPLOAD!!!! 10 kbps IS NOT ENUFF LOOKS LIKE PPL ARE SEEDING AT 2kbps PER SEEDER THINK!!!! THINK!!!! THINK!!!! 
,jchin206,2009-07-27T18:46Z,SEEEED! PLZ! STUCK AT 96.9%
,redx123,2009-11-04T00:59Z,"just d/l the fsg2008, now u/l it, but the thing wont install from daemon as a mount,keeps saying disc2, no link to it, what to do with the 3 zipped files? any help would be greatfull, keep seeding it, even though its not installing as yet ;)"
