,cpacilio,2007-11-02T17:54Z,Question - why do we have to already own th star wars prequel trilogy? Do we need the original discs in order to watch the fan edit?
,Raistlin (DK),2007-11-02T18:37Z,"its for copyright reasons, this way the uploader got his back free :)"
,brny44,2007-11-06T15:56Z,seed pleasse
,jasonbir,2007-11-16T03:15Z,"Personally, this seems pointless, I think that George Lucas did an amazing job. Leave well enough alone. "
,mjj1,2007-11-23T11:36Z,"Can some please seed this? i'm at 84.7% done
Thanks :)"
,Paschendalist,2008-01-17T19:41Z,"This has got to be the most worthless, useless hunk a junk I've ever read about! Why, why, oh why would anyone want to see a cut version of Star Wars? And Episode II, 52 minutes long, what's up with that. I'm not even going to bother.
Jackass."
,michaelingeorgia,2008-01-20T18:42Z,"This is a terrific fanedit. No, it's not for everyone. For me, however, given the content of the three ""prequel"" films, I'm much happier seeing the story told in a single longer and more epic-feeling tale. 
While I was never one of those who was rabid about Jar-Jar, I never thought he added much to the story. And, there were some things in the prequel that just mad me wince... things like midichloreans, ""the chosen one"", a virgin birth, and all that stuff. It just seemed a bit too cliche' and derivative for my tastes.  

That said, I was sorry to see the opening battle sequence from Episode III gone. It was the single greatest space battle in the prequel trilogy, although it went downhill during the whole rescue business on board. 

All in all, it's an interesting and welcome vision. I also recently saw the fanedit of Superman-Last Son of Kypton. While I loved that version even better than either of the first two actual films (then again, it was sort of conceived and written that way to begin with), this Star Wars edit is better executed. Highly recommended for those who do worship every frame of Lucas' prequel trilogy."
,xdaoyu,2008-02-03T10:01Z,"I don't know if this should be recommended for those who ""worshipped every frame of Lucas's prequel trilogy"", those (rather frighteningly young or dumb) fans seem the type to be most infuriated by something like this. I f'ing LOVE the concept, designs, mythos, and universe of star wars, but Lucas's ego ruined 4 of the films. I like seeing people tinker with it, although I am kind of frightened by the thought of shoving new lines for yoda in, I mean, who the hell does the voice? I'll give it a shot, though, it's gotta be damn hard for anyone to come up with worse dialogue than what made it into the theatrical releases...
I'm sure it really sticks in george's ass that people are doing this. Careful, he might do a 'special edition' of the prequel to make the dialogue even more godawful as revenge..."
,spystyle,2008-02-25T21:09Z,"THANK YOU :)

Fan editors rock!"
,theseany,2008-04-25T10:03Z,"Wow! I haven't even seen this yet and it sounds like the prequels were finally brought up to the standards set by New Hope and Empire. Exactly what I want: a more direct, darker depiction of the whole story. Cut the crap and you've got a winner! I can't wait to watch this.

I though, ""Hmm, it might be nice to see an edit like this of the original trilogy"", but that would basically consist of Episodes 4 & 5 being unedited and Episode 6 being cut to about 30 minutes, and with no additions."
,Luther7718,2008-06-09T01:15Z,":( If this ever finishes downloading, I'll be sure to seed it. Just reading the .nfo, though, I have to say, it looks fantastic."
,JCPRuckus,2008-11-06T00:05Z,Seeders needed.
,skribb,2009-04-28T13:30Z,Could use a seed or two :)
,mal808,2011-07-20T22:03Z,Any chance of anyone out there seeding for a day or two so that I can finish this one off? I'll happily seed it for a long time after I get this one.
,mal808,2011-08-03T06:22Z,"Several people are stuck at 96.4%, just need someone to seed for a few hours and we can keep this one going..."
,daboblin,2012-03-27T03:31Z,"Please seed guys, we have 10 leechers at 98% who want to seed."
