-=Plot=-
Bourne is once again brought out of hiding, this time inadvertently by 
London-based reporter Simon Ross who is trying to unveil Operation 
BlackBriar--an upgrade to Project Treadstone--in a series of newspaper 
columns. Bourne (Damon) sets up a meeting with Ross (Considine) and 
realizes instantly they're being scanned. Information from the reporter 
stirs a new set of memories, and Bourne must finally, ultimately, 
uncover his dark past whilst dodging The Company's best efforts in 
trying to eradicate him.
