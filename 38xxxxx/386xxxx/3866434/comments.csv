,thepiratebayrocks,2007-12-21T05:24Z,no ipods only play mp4's of 320x240 resolution
,tekestar,2008-02-28T05:38Z,"not true, I rip all my stuff at 640 resolution and a 1400 bit rate. Makes the files really big but the quality is awesome and my iPod plays them just fine. It take 5 or 6 seconds to load but it plays fine. I rip them like so so I can play them though my 50"" inch and not lose a lot of quality."
