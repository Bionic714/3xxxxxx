,cruxware,2007-11-03T04:09Z,How useful is this without you seeding :-((
,Kerr0r,2007-11-03T23:49Z,He probably is... TPB is having trouble with their tracker.
,ElBiggus,2007-11-04T19:09Z,"I've been seeding it for 2 days now -- the tracker's being a pain since I started; according to Azureus there are currently 7 leechers, but TPB is showing 0, so something's not quite right.)"
[T],Mac-Sparrow,2007-11-11T23:24Z,How long will this trial work?
,ElBiggus,2007-11-21T15:46Z,"At work we spoke to Apple about it (we use it extensively, but for various reasons need to keep Tiger on at least some of our machines) and were told that 1.4 will work indefinitely -- no support and no updates, but unlike previous versions it has no built-in timebomb."
,Tyr_Arcana,2007-12-28T05:58Z,"Installed and ran fine on 10.4.11 today, thanks muchly for keeping this alive for those of us not on leopard yet (or those with faulty leopard disks, grr!)"
,tinybruk,2008-01-07T11:49Z,"I got this today, running OS X 10.4.11

When I install it says BootCamp Assistant Beta Has expired.

Any way to get it working?"
,yuriprimes,2008-01-26T09:59Z,A mac update disables the bootcamp beta. You need leopard to run bootcamp now. This torrent = useless
,bright_plastik,2008-02-10T00:55Z,"ok...let's see me newby got it...some of us got to make it work on 10.4.11, but just if the update has been made BEFORE installing boot camp...am I right? or is it a time bomb, finally? I'm not connected though my mac (offline update till 10.4.9) so in no way they'll know what the heck I'm doing with MY F***ING OWN computer. Do I go chilled then? Thanks for your (eventual) tips, fellas!"
,gabriel84,2008-02-19T17:07Z,thank you yuriprimes I was going mad here.
,gyubok,2008-03-10T00:12Z,"to install this version, which is expired, you must set your dates back to like... 2005. install it, and then change the dates back. :) works perfectly"
,thesauce25,2008-08-03T20:10Z,"Wait, i need help here. So I'm trying to download bootcamp and Windows XP to install on my macbook running tiger. Do I download bootcamp, install that on tiger, then download XP, install that through bootcamp, then download the latest drivers and install them in windows?"
,tlatl,2008-08-29T17:27Z,Thanks for making this available.  I'm currently DLing form 6 of 6 peers.  I'll then seed it whenever I'm online.
,blackjesus69,2008-11-10T16:09Z,Confirmed IT WORKS!  Just set the date back to 2005 and BAM!  THANK YOU I ALMOST ERASED THIS TORRENT...
,benny-goodman,2009-02-16T21:10Z,"you saved my life dude, thank you so much!!"
,mzona,2009-12-18T02:42Z,life saver. thx.
,mzona,2009-12-18T04:45Z,"wtf can' t mount the dmg file 
checksum error. 
I have Mac os X 10.4 (not 10.4.11)"
,H04rd3r,2010-10-04T04:47Z,"i usually dont ask for seeders, becasue im patient and dont mind sitting on a 5kbs down for a week, but will at least 1 person seed this so it will move. please?"
,neversaynikon,2011-11-04T19:01Z,"This time bomb'd when leopard came out so try setting the clock back before leopards release.  Also, if someone would seed it... just sayin"
