Bonka 2007
After several days delay here it is. A 3 piece DVD'r Unpack with winaceand burn or mount.

For those who are unfamiliar with the bonka race. 
Bonka happens almost every year at a  hidden race track in the middle of Sweden. Its a "folkrace" but without rules. Kind of demolition derby like in the old god days.
