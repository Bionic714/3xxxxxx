,jessez,2008-11-15T06:10Z,Game works perfect don't install just click motogp.exe and it will run; but he f-ed up and didn't include the launcher.exe so to get this just click install and pick any location while its installing copy the launcher.exe and paste it in your directory then cancel the install and now you can change your game settings and everything works right :P
