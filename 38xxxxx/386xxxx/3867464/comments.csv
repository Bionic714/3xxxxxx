,binstar,2007-11-01T01:08Z,"It's actually real. I didn't notice it was rar'ed until it had finished so i said screw it and tried the instructions and it extracted and it's the right file and i didn't have to sue a real email address.

but since i don't support that annoying ass shit and think people need to get a real job... 

the password is ""congratulations!""

shawteee, thanks for posting this, no thanks for being the worst kind of leach there is.

learn a fucking trade."

As peerguardian blocked that xbox site probably as an IP logging site from Time Warner Telecom(207.250.205.29) I couldn't get it. See more of this IP collecting crap each day, wonder where it will end up?!"

Actually no, special thanks to binstar for taking the risk of retrieving the password."
