Blood on the Asphalt is a tribute album to the music of Super Street 
Fighter 2 Turbo, its contents comprised of new arrangements of old, 
familiar songs from the original game soundtrack, created by various 
artists, unified along the lines of genre and tone. The arrangements 
contained herein have been designed to be evocative of dark, 
pseudo-romanticized urban imagery: abandoned playgrounds and crowded 
street markets; back-alley block parties and hole-in-the-wall bar dives, 
scenes that are, I hope, befitting of a tribute to one of the most 
iconic games in arcade history. So sit back and download.
