.:Review\ Another great RUDOS release. Highly recommended.

.:Details\ Excellent crack, the full game is here, the game is playable, like the retail version, and there is a valid working no cd crack app which works just fine when installed correctly.

Couldnt ask for a better rip/torrent. Of course the CD crack will appear to antivirus programs as a virus but it is not, all cd cracks programs appear this way, its normal and not harmful. I personally tested, and played the game for over a year no issues.

Score ---> 10/10


Note: If you are into the simcity 4 game, you can find additional downloads for the game made by users such as new street lights, new buildings, new options, and game mods at two fan sites....
