,j.w.swany,2008-11-02T07:29Z,does this work on pc? has anyone tried?
,X-shot,2009-03-25T19:12Z,"I'm eating now, but I will try it a few minutes later (and I'm seeding now with full 1,5 Mbit)."
,X-shot,2009-03-25T19:28Z,"Don't lie. This torrent IS one file.

And this file works (I tried out with emulator.).

If somebody wants to use this with a PS2 console, than I recommend to write it to DVD with low writing speed /the preferable is 2X/. And I think that the old PS2 can't read some of the newest DVD -recordables. Try out some ."
,Juhemi,2009-05-29T21:50Z,Could someone be so kind and put some more speed onto this torrent plx? Love the game.
,VooK,2010-06-29T05:35Z,"pretty old torrent but it would be great if someone could seed, download speeds are around 5 kbps atm."
,Falkarion,2010-08-20T03:12Z,Seed! Please
