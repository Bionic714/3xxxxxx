,drsilverworm,2007-11-05T02:03Z,Why are there only 2 seeders? This is SHANKLYS. This is a phenomenon! People ought to be scrambling for this stuff!

        Another month and another great collection. Will be on the artwork soon. 
Check these out for next month Glasvegas - fanyastic band who will be huge and Suzanne Elizabeth Marron who doesnt have an album out yet but soon as she does world domination will follow. Check out the track Ghost.
Both have Myspace sites"

[T],Shanklys Love Child,2007-11-07T11:56Z,"I'm seeding all the time - lets have a few others eh? Not sure why there are 18 seeds for August's compilation and only 3 for this one?????

Arthur - thanks for the tips - will check them out!"
,bluegamba,2007-11-08T06:11Z,"I have been and still am seeding these ""Love Children"" since May. The change in number of seeders came about two months ago. I therefore suspect there is something wrong with TPB. Suggestions anyone?"
