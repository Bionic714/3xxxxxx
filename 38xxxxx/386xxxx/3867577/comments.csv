,mawsonlakes,2007-11-01T06:50Z,whats the quality like? how about a sample or some screens?
,Computer_God,2007-11-01T09:37Z,Computer God only creates 100% DVDRip quality torrents
,mawsonlakes,2007-11-02T01:32Z,"i could take ur word for it but i have been mislead before 

so, how u allow us to judge the quality for ourselves before we download it. the qaulity can still be dodgy even if its a rip"
,Computer_God,2007-11-03T18:54Z,"To be perfectly honest I just dont want to spend the time it takes to make a sample from the file.
But I will say this; when I decided to start making film torrents, I also decided that I would only make torrents of DVD quality files.
I know how frustrating it can be when you want a film and spend ages downloading a few copies of it and they are all poor quality, hence the reason for my quality rule.
Download one of my torrents, if your not happy with it then make sure you don't download any more because every one I create will be the same standard.
