I downloaded the pach from the command and conquer official site (so there is no need to download this torrent :-o ) And it is the same file.
I now cannot play the game without the original cd...
DO NOT INSTAL THE PACH UNLESS YOU HAVE A CRACK FOR IT!!!!
AND IF YOU DO, PLEASE, UPLOAD IT "

At least I have a reason to rerelease this file now."
