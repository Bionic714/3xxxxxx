Guitar.Hero.III.USA.FIX.READ.NFO.XBOX360-iND

This PPF patch is for Sniperkil's usenet release as well as Guitar_Hero_III_USA_XBOX360-GUITAR
which is a repack of Sniperkil's release. The CRC of the iso file in both releases is 7F129CAD.

This patch fixes 16 sectors of bad data in the game partition at offset 0x17B3C8000.
There are no files in this area, however the bad data could serve as a marker for XBL backup detection.
This patch also changes data in the DMI and SS to match a known good rip of GH3.

2. Select ISO File GH3-SK.iso or GH3-GUITAR.iso
