"Truth is a pathless land. Man cannot come to it through any organisation, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, nor through any philosophic knowledge or psychological technique. He has to find it through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contents of his own mind, through observation and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection..."

Jiddu Krishnamurti 1895-1986

Krishnamurti is one of the most significant and profound thinker of the twentieth century. The world is full of 'spiritual' nonsense, and Krishnamurti speaks to us in a most intelligent, relevant and deeper way. This series of 6 talks, titled "Exploring the Essence of Love", was recorded in Ojai, California in 1982.
