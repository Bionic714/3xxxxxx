                            mIRC 6.3 Patch AND Keygen

mIRC 6.3 has been released! (August 16th 2007)

This version of mIRC offers full Vista compatability with support for limited user accounts, U3 support, support for tips (those small text balloons that pop up near the Windows tray) to notify you of various events such as incoming messages or users in your notify list coming on or leaving IRC, support for positioning the Treebar at top/bottom of the mIRC window, and a feature that allows you to switch between Normal and Compact modes. Compact mode makes mIRC behave like a messenger with the treebar filling the main window, all windows opening on the desktop, and so on.

For experienced users and scripting enthousiasts this new version has heaps of fixes, changes and other little thingies to play with. We encourage you to explore the whatsnew.txt on the Web to learn about the complete list of changes and their impact. Some changes are obvious, some need getting used to - please take your time to play with them and see how they work?

Enjoy!!
