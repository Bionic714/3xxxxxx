At the time the population equaled Half the population of New York. We fought off over 2 million russians! So If Hollywood want another 300 movie, read some of the Finnish winter war."

,unnie,2008-07-12T14:01Z,My Grandfather is portrayed in TALI-IHANTALA 1944. A VERY good movie. I recommend you all to buy it - not download. Support makings of important historical accurate Finnish-made movies.
,storhemulen,2008-11-26T11:12Z,Fennia: With a little help from the nazis of course. You finns always seem to forget that...
,whosthis,2008-11-26T12:39Z,"storhemulen: Finland had to get help from somewhere, Sweden didn't allow the Allied to transport troops through to Finland. Sweden later allowed Nazi Germany the use of their railroads between 1940 and 1943. At the same time 80% of Swedens trade was done with Nazi Germany. And Swedes call themselves ""neutral"". Of course this is often forgotten about in Sweden...

This is a great movie, of a great achievement, let it be at that."
