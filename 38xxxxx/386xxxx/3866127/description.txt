STAR TREK - THE NEXT GENERATION - SEASON 1 - DISC 5 OF 7

Plot Synopsis:In the first "Star Trek" story set in the 24th Century, Captain Jean-Luc Picard is the commander of the new Federation flagship, the fifth U.S.S. Enterprise. En route to the distant Farpoint Station, the Enterprise is captured by a capricious, omnipotent being who calls himself Q. In a court of his own devising, Q judges that, based on its past, humanity is unfit to exist. Picard argues that the human race has outgrown its infancy, and should be judged on its current actions. Q relents, and agrees to monitor the Enterprise's new crew as it investigates a mysterious force at Farpoint Station.
