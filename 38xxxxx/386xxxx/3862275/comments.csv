,c2cfan,2008-06-11T04:28Z,Flac is a compressed music format. it can be converted using programs such as Xilisoft Audio Converter. Cheers!!
,jerseyjim,2008-06-17T12:21Z,Nice Upload!
,GN85,2008-06-18T08:10Z,"Wow, nice torrent. Full FLAC discography.

For those of you who don't know what FLAC is, it's a format like MP3s, but its compression is lossless, meaning the sound quality is not reduced."
,myjasny,2008-09-17T01:03Z,"Excellent torrent! Thanks OldMan33 and other seeders.

Stuck at 63% though. Will keep seeding if I can finish the download.

Cheers"
,sx-y-z,2008-10-04T00:31Z,do you have to covert flac to for instance mp3 or wma to play it or is it possible to play it with a media player?

,theirkenone,2008-11-30T03:44Z,"Thank you for the great upload, FLAC is awesome.
BTW, for anyone else Songbird is a great media player that can play FLAC files natively."
,Jehav,2008-12-25T09:16Z,flac can be played without converting with Foobar2000. its a very good player by itself anyway and worth getting
,Hendrix467,2009-01-16T04:30Z,Dude thank you SO much! One of my fav bands. I have all their cds but theyve been completely wrecked over the years... you know how it goes... this just made my friggin day!
,hounter90,2009-01-28T18:40Z,"GREAT UPLOAD!!! for all y'all out there that want their flac files on a portable media player, use Rockbox. It supports FLAC and many other formats. (and has alot of cool games like Doom)"

,DilS.DilS,2009-07-10T05:29Z,thanks!
,RobotUtronMaster,2009-08-16T11:19Z,"VLC is the media player you want, it plays everything! you don't have to convert anything! videolan.org/vlc careful though, once you start listening to flac you get addicted, you can tell when you're listening to an mp3, cause it'll suck. Thanks for the UP btw."
,RobotUtronMaster,2009-08-16T11:20Z,"oh yeah, will seed indefinately, at least to a 5.0 ratio, but probably more like 15 or so."
,MOVNGFWD,2010-03-26T00:20Z,"THANK YOU!  What a FANTASTIC upload!  Cheers, OldMan!  :)"
,CCFC_Archer,2010-09-11T16:12Z,"Awesome upload.

However, when comparing to the rest, does anyone else notice a dip in volume when playing Blood Sugar Sex Magik?

Or is this deliberate?

I ask the 2nd question because when I've downloaded the album separately it appears the same. The volume is much reduced."
,Berend.botje,2011-03-11T19:51Z,"@ sura_lingon : 

Format Lossless Audio Codec

Provides better Audio quality than .MP3 files

Its a shame its so unknown becouss music is so much more wonderfull to listnen to in better quality! 
"
,everlastcro,2011-07-04T22:36Z,very nice
,eleusis,2011-10-29T07:46Z,"best RHCP discography I've found to date.  if you want high quality but don't want it in FLAC, download this file and this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3621886/dB_powerAmp_12_Complete_Pack and then use dB to convert to MP3 at whatever bitrate you choose."
,pezed,2012-07-02T07:51Z,"Nice, Old Man. Thank You."
,pezed,2012-07-02T07:58Z,It's amazing how many people don't know what FLac is including the ones who think they know what it is. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC
