,SRC1022,2007-10-29T20:09Z,"Thanks for the upload, this one is kind of hard to find."
,madmax999,2007-10-29T20:41Z,"If there is anything else you have been looking for, let me know, I'll try to find it.  I mostly do the ones that are 80's and earlier (as you noticed) and are not already posted here. I only post on TPB."
,SRC1022,2007-10-30T08:13Z,"It's appreciated, I'll be seeding for a while.


Here's an obscure request, would you happen to have the uncut version of 1900 with Robert DeNiro?"
,madmax999,2007-10-31T22:51Z,"""The Legend of 1900"" I assume.  Original Italian or English?"
,SRC1022,2007-11-14T08:18Z,"Actually, I found out it's already on here.  Thanks though."
,wul,2007-12-09T22:57Z,"I'm looking for Don't Look Now. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069995/

Can't find it anywhere :/"
,Ghost60,2007-12-24T13:07Z,"Great upload, been looking for this one for a while :)"
,Ghost60,2007-12-24T13:09Z,"btw, do you by any chance have ""Caravans"" from 1978? Tnx in advance."
,madmax999,2007-12-26T19:21Z,"I have Don't Look Now in the process of downloading from eDonkey.  Maybe end of this week or beginning of next.

Sorry, couldn't find Caravans.  I have it on a sticky note and will check from time to time."

,CarlosDwarf,2008-04-17T19:42Z,Got it! Thanks!
,madmax999,2008-04-20T17:17Z,"You are welcome.  Sometimes it takes me a couple weeks to notice a torrent has less than 4 active seeders, take it off of stop and put it back on active."
,stumblingblo,2008-04-24T20:41Z,"Wow. great movie. Only those who have studied navigation will catch the joke of ""Boxing the compass"" that Matthau uses about what he and the woman do in bed."
,bongotarzana,2008-06-13T22:38Z,"Hi,thanks for this one,might you have The Outfit(1973,Robert Duvall)please?"
,madmax999,2008-10-24T07:14Z,I found The Outfit on edonkey.  I just started the download today so it will probably be a while to finish.  It is listed as VHS rip so I'll check the quality before posting.
,VikingGodThor,2008-11-25T13:42Z,"Hi there madmax999

It seems like you have loads of movies available, or know where to find them,  I have been looking for 3 westerns for a long time, cant seem to neither buy nor download them, but maybe you can help? 

Guns of Honor
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109960/

Trigger Fast
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111492/

Tex and the Lord of the Deep
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090150/

The last one need to be with either english or any scandinavian language subtitles on, as the movie is italian

I do know these are not that good movies, but I have read all the books in the two series, and would love to see the movies.

Viking"
[T],JayRay,2009-01-06T10:19Z,THANKS! A really great movie. One of my all time favorites. And Walter Matthau at his best. Your rip is excellent quality.

,zygarch,2012-05-12T08:58Z,"Oh hi-- that time again  ; )
Thank you for this one! Can you seed please?
Also, this one may stump you... I'm in my fourth year of looking for it: No Down Payment (1957) Herb Ritts, dir; Joann Woodward, Barbara Rush, Tony Randall. It's like the original ""Mad Men"". I even bot a script to UseNet because it was listed, only to find files DEAD. If you ever find it...  U="
,zygarch,2012-05-12T09:01Z,"Sorry, I misspoke. I meant to say ""Martin Ritt, dir""."
,metanick,2012-05-18T06:15Z,Thanks. Excellent movie.
