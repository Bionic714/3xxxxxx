It is great watching Walter Matthau as a bad guy/crook.  He pulls it off quite nicely. I suppose this is Crime or Drama.  The movie is more about Varrick vs the Mafia than Varrick vs the cops.  It does make it easier to be on his side.  I have been looking for this for a few years.  Finally got it.
