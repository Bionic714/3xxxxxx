,vimse1973,2007-10-30T22:54Z,Many are reading this and it gives us a happy life. Ok that you think it is the worst book ever writen but i dont feel the same. Do you know psychopaths since you can tell that all of them are? Well it takes one to know one!

I wonder what happened in you life that makes you so angry? Folks like you are usually faithless people who didn't have their way with God and got disgruntled and bitter with any life that's better than yours. Get over it, God is not a genie who grants wishes, but wants to change sinful hearts like yours into one like Jesus' in preparation for His kingdom."
,Breadfan866,2007-11-22T22:37Z,"right... I believe god is a fake story to make people have faith in their life how miserable it may be. Also to keep people on the right track and do nice things. Though, without this fictional book I have respect for humanity and have grace for my fellow man."
,warez_R_us,2008-01-09T21:04Z,"Hehe Breadfan you have a point of course, that's the purpose of religions isn't it? The question is how people still can believe in this stuff. Granted, I've still only a couple of hundred pages in Old Testament, but so far I have to say that it's a pretty weird story. And i honestly laugh out loud sometimes when I read. Sorry christians, but believe the worlds second most red book, Lord of the Rings, more then nr 1;) Still intresting though

Ok folks i'm off to see if i can find the Koran here too!

,Femacamper,2008-07-23T05:47Z,The King James Bible is copyright-free.
,KingKongFetus,2008-08-15T09:26Z,"wow... you all who believe the bible is the worst book ever written have READ IT? Good for you! That would be the first step towards NOT being a hypocrite! Anyways, the King James is a tough read and not so accurate... anybody find a NAS version?"
,anyoneatall,2008-10-18T19:51Z,"To quote Jillette Penn:

We need more atheists - and nothing will get you there quicker, than reading the bible."
,Arctic_0ne,2009-02-05T22:28Z,"I think that you people should stop all of the fighting and just let people lead their own lives. I am an atheist, but I would like to study both testaments and the satanic bible for study reasons."
,Creativinity,2009-06-03T05:56Z,"You're so weird, posting the Bible and Metal covers. Cool. I'm a hardcore Christian but I also love metal (most specifically symphonic metal) and some people think I'm crazy because of this (but God made all music, even metal). I'm glad to see there are other crazy people like me.

Thanks for this."
