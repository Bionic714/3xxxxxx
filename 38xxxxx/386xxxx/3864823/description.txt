*This King James' Bible is the SECOND Project Gutenberg Version*
This 10th edition should be labeled biblea10.txt or biblea10.zip
****This edition is being officially released on Easter 1992****
Our FIRST version is still in the archives at the moment and may
appear shortly in the directory of Project Gutenberg 1980s work.

****
This version of the King James Bible was created by taking several
public domain copies and painstakingly comparing them to find all
the differences, and selecting the most common version. Each of the
differences was also compared to printed versions for verification.

This work is hereby put into the public domain.
