,Tranceforlife,2007-12-07T18:21Z,"Yeah. It's a 1.37 gig 24 second long intro, that's basically just the Universal logo and a couple seconds of the movie; a good waste of 6 hours of downloading and drive space, if you're into that."

,boothroyd917,2008-03-24T23:26Z,"Yeah, the movie really works.  Don't really know wat Tranceforlife is talkin bout.  Also, it takes a while to download (cuz even though ppl r seedin, no1 has a speed above 10 kb/s), but its worth it."
,cousinbow,2008-05-24T12:45Z,"It works, and looks fine to me. Seed!"
,Gastromix,2008-06-09T09:38Z,"Tranceforlife is a moron who cant even use google to find an answer,  mabey it´s he´s codecs that are to old or it´s he´s comp that are to outdated or the grapich drivers that are outdated, this is the thing most ppl tend to forget and when it doesnt work right away they start whining."
,laoza110,2008-06-21T01:20Z,"Tranceforlife hates Amsterdam and so that he slanders the Amsterdam-born van Helsing. The movie works smoothly, only Tranceforlife's eyes does not work properly."
,ace_acme,2008-07-05T06:35Z,"The sound is not working. I've downloaded the lastest versions of DivX and Real Player. The DivX player says "" This is a Dolby AC3 audio 8192. You need to install directshow decoder to hear the sound track"". I googled for wht it has asked for, but I ouldn't locate the right software to download. Please suggest"
