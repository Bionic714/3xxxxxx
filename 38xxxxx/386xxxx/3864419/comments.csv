,Dim0S,2008-06-25T09:39Z,Thank You!
,00onefour,2009-01-17T13:14Z,Oh why would you use that kind of format?  Why not something more common.  Won't play on my mp4 untill i convert it but thanks for the tracks
,fireonice,2009-01-27T08:51Z,"For those who thinks these are single tracks, they aren't. They're mixed."
,faheyd,2009-03-04T08:54Z,"Thank you so much for using FLAC.

Some of the people out there just don't understand lossless codecs, or they don't have an audio system that loves full range sound."
,djmopa,2009-03-14T04:39Z,"FLAC, which stands for ""Free Lossless Audio Codec"" FLAC are typically reduced in size 40 to 50 percent, so the quality of the audio is closer to an ACTUAL CD... People, quit bitching about FLAC... you would be happier, if you knew the technology behind it... 128K, 160k, 192k, 320k... has nothing on FLAC... a FLAC can be damn near 900-1000k... so imagine the quality of a 320, but only 3 times better?

If you use NERO... there is a FLAC coded dll file you can install into your plugin directory folder so you can BURN FLAC audio to CDR...

FLAC FUCKING ROCKS!!!!"
,BlastedToTheSky,2009-05-05T04:03Z,"yeah i used to wonder why people would put up torrents that are flac.

now i understand because the quality is soooo much better. I just got some HD headphones and the difference is amazing."
,archineer,2012-04-09T18:01Z,"FLAC (or lossless in general) is not 'closer to CD quality' it IS CD quality. CD is 1411kbps, mp3 320 at best. See the difference? FLAC (and ALAC for that matter) act a zip files compressing the music losslessly to about 2 thirds the size of the CD original - when uncompressed you gat a bit for bit identical copy of the CD."
