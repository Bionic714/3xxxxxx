Thanks for this ul too!"
,sneeblewhopp,2008-01-06T01:13Z,"I would love to see his complete ""Dark Tower"" series all bundled into one torrent in audio book form! They never made a movie, yet in my opinion...it's his masterpiece. I thought it ended on book like 7 or so...called ""The Dark Tower"", but now I hear he's making what is to be the last....called ""The Long Road Home""...book 8 I believe. They'll release the new book in March of 08."
