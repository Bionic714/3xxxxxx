,Fallenswarm,2008-10-10T01:58Z,"hey, i have a request... -_^ In our Technological Community. Those who post Torrents are representatives of our community. viewed by the masses as the pinnacle of our society. If those who represent us earn  a bad name, we all do... -_^ 

Even the smallest thing as spelling Discography wrong shows the masses that we are a uneducated community -_^ we are a proud people, This is not a option for us. "
