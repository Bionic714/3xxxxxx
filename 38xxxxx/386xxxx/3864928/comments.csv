I realy want this movie !"
,jowf,2007-11-02T01:21Z,you are wrong. it sucks
,Heybaperiba,2007-11-05T00:39Z,"jowf, are you serious??!!

This movie redefines the whole snowboard movie genre in my opinion, and I've been watching snowboard movies since Critical Conditions...
I think this movie is brilliant, progressive and like nothing I've seen before.

,sensiskrap,2007-11-06T22:09Z,"This movie SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
redefines snowboarding?!?!?!!? 
yeah, maybe if you only like to hang out in the city slide rails and dress retarded. 
How many slo mo shots of snow and crap can one movie have? 
Check out a real movie where they actually snowslide down mts. ie lines, vapors,optomistic.

Heybaperiba: see you in the parking lot by the hand rail, i'll recognize you by your tight jeans and ""cool"" sunglasses. 

jowf: rock on!! see you on mt, SNOWBOARDING.   "
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-11-07T21:19Z,"I agree with sensiskrap this movie has enough slow motion shots to give you brain cancer after just wachting it one time.

What MDP did wrong and what some people call progression is that they instead of focusing on getting the best tricks they use the best arty shoots and best angels not concentrating on the rider but everything around + way to much street rails and same shoots + some people have long boring parts with the same shoots some riders didnt have a part like Jakob W how has filmed with MDP all year but didnt get a part very uncool from MDP side to just drop a hard working rider like that and film with Shaun white and Kevin P one night and give them a almost 3 min part.

But i also know that there are many people out there like Heybaperiba how like arty shoots and to see the trick in slow motion but to me it was the years biggest disappointment. I payed 35 dollas for the movie and watched it 3 times. Of all the movies i have seen this year its one was by far the worst. 

Its does not matter for how long you have watched snowboard videos everyone has different tasted and it changes allot from year to year and you never get good at wachtin snowboard videos. You use them to get inspiration and to get stoked for riding and Picture This does not do that for me."

,steffosilvestri,2007-11-09T16:16Z,"I just read these comments and..... I don't understand how people can think that this movie SUCKS:: Probably they have NO IDEA AT ALL what Snowbording is !!!!!!!!!!, and surely they have never suceeded in doing ANY of the tricks pictured in this movie!
Luckily I'm from Livigno (ITALY) and we've got one of the biggest Snow Parks in Europe, and I know pretty well how difficult these tricks are..
Normal people (with no snowboard or ski freestyle experience) thinks that the bigger the jump is - the cooler the trick is... Somtimes a ""simple"" clean 180 is much more stylish than 900 just grabbed for half a second.... (BUT PROBABLY YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME 25 METERS JUMP TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS)
I'm a freestyle skier now.. and I've been snowbording for 8 years as well, and if I talk about something, it's because I know what I'm talking about....
If you don't believe me - check on youtube! LOOSERS.........."
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-11-11T20:26Z,"First If you would know anything about torrents, Download you would know to not say where you are from on TPB so you know nothing. 

Second i can do i couple of the tricks in this movie and i have hit more than a couple of 25 meter jumps. But this has no value to determine the quality of this movie. I payed 35 dollars for this movie and even this was worth it because of Jeremy Jones part the rest of the movie was just the same jump or hand rail with many arty shoots and then a slow motion shoot and even though the tricks are many times amazing if you fail in all other views the movie is bad watch Follow me around and this and you might see the difference. Because even though its short it gets boring to watch and its to much of a shop-video not staying true to the riders but just wanting to sell as many copies as possible.

and because you have been snowboarding for 8 years does not mean you can decide what a good movie is and last you have not right calling people not agreeing with you losers so try understanding that people think differently and that you are not the center of the world."
,sensiskrap,2007-11-14T01:12Z,"uioplkjhbnmm: you rule dude. hosting all sorts of good vids, and raggin on dumbass skiers. ha i love it. 

steffosilvestri: you also rock, but more like rockin cock in your mouth in the alleyway. you know how i know this video sucks...because im the best snowboarder! its true, i can do every trick, and invented half of them myself. 
25 meters, ha. where i live (2845 w 28th st. VANCOUVER BC, if you want to stop by ;)  we have even bigger jumps, and you know the  bigger the jump the more helicopters i can get in. i think its time to switch back to skiing. "
,Benni,2007-11-14T11:24Z,"I think what heybaperiba is kinda right if you consider the way the entire movie is done camera-technological.. Not one shot is while the shooter is standing still.. A lot of cable-cams, dolly shots, etc...

If Heybaperiba is who i think he is, he's probably produced more ski and snowboard-movies then you guys ever will.."
,ruda555,2007-11-17T02:11Z,Yeah!! I think this movie is great. It really shows the feeling of snowboard. I Love it
,MrG_01,2007-11-17T16:51Z,"Any chance on getting the HD version of this video?

,lager86,2007-11-28T23:09Z,Some really awesome shit on this one!
,Ich1raku,2008-06-02T21:26Z,"snowboarding is what you make of it, different styles like mountain vs. rails jowf and sensikrap don't understand this and are ingnorant for it. I prefer mountain but at some point IT GETS THE FUCK OLD!!!! so yeah this movie does redefine snowboarding dipshit who the fuk cares what they wear neway they could be wearing a fuking clownsuit for all i care its what they do that counts plus the effects in this movie were off the chain most snowboarding movies like optomistic have shit filming though the snowboarding was legit"
,honda450rboi,2008-12-05T05:18Z,"great movie but its not for everyone....
im seeding this"
,atomlow,2009-01-30T00:17Z,"Snowboarding and skateboarding are great, but it's ridiculous how many haters there are in the community. If you are that insecure about yourselves maybe you should do something else with your free time. You bore me. yawn."
,DenTinPaleuoMia,2010-02-22T00:13Z,"guys i'm really a beginner in snowboarding and i don't know anything either from snowboarding or snowboard movies. however i like snowboarding very much and i want to take it up more seriously. i decided to download this movie despite the controversial critics it was given, but i would consider it very helpful if you could post some links with the movies you like most with your comments, so as i could shape my own opinion about the whole thing. thanks anyway!!"
,the.subz,2010-11-16T22:37Z,"seeding right now, hope it's good, cause obviously opinions are separated.
For me however, snowboardfilms are about getting stoked and wanting to get on your board, and the boarding itself, regardless the place and how huge the jump is. If this movie does so, it's a good movie to me.
And if you love snowboarding so much, then you shouldn't be this dissrespectfull to the people who worked hard on this video. they're boarders just like you. You can dislike it, but you shouldn't say it/they suck because of the place and clothing. That just proves you're a douche..

and to DenTinPaleuoMia: i really liked 'that's it that's all' and all absinthe films are really good :) and the movies made by the major brands are usually pretty good, like nitro and burton."

It doesn't redifne any genre, and it doesn't suck balls.

No one is dressed retarded, they're wearing normal ski pants and jackets, I just saw one guy with a striped sweater for 2 seconds...

I didn't notice any excessive slowmotion, in fact, I would stop and reply a few times just to see how the fuck they pulled off a trick. Because as a snowboarder, I intend to get some reference experience from these videos.

There's only like 15 minutes of city stuff in the whole video, there's a nice balance with regular mountain parks (huge ass kickers with gaps and shit) Huge mountain footage complete with one guy starting an avalache.

They film from helicopters and fucking remote controlled cameras on zip lines.

The stunts are baddass, artsy is not the main focus, it's just very well recorded and edited to make it a pleasant watch.

This film has everything and definitely the best snowboarding movie I've ever seen.
