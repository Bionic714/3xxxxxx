Cause every single one of the ""PAL"" copys out here aint working on PAL, just comes up same error ""please insert this disc into a xbox360"" and every other game i tryed has worked flawless on my 360, except this?
So i wonder if those of you who have gotten this down, is it workin, is it PAL?"
,Kenzo78,2007-11-05T17:09Z,"I dont know if this will work. I just know that every other torrents out there dont work for me. I got the same message as u did TheMythical on all other versions I tried. Even if it was patched and it said PAL in the description.

Lets hope this one is the real deal."

Is this one working properly on a flashed 360? No other release does >."
