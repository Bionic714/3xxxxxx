,jakenold,2007-11-01T05:17Z,"It is real, I just seeded it here - that's why I am the only seed. The other one posted here as RAR-files is also real (it has been aired you know), but I thought more people would like a single AVI."
,jasonbir,2007-11-01T05:24Z,"Alright, I'm still d/ling, but I will post later. I wish it aired in Canada tonight as well!"
,W00DR0W,2007-11-01T05:30Z,"I appreciate the singles, half the time those split files don't work for me.

Too bad no one's seeding. I guess I'll wait for 3666 to upload."

Strange, I usually have more luck downloading multi-parts than single avi files.

@jakenold
Thanks for upload... if it's real... no offense jake, but it's hard to get too enthusiastic with all the tards who post fake torrents. Here's hoping you're the real deal."
,jakenold,2007-11-01T05:36Z,Check my other torrents for proof 8)
,wilbursith669,2007-11-01T07:37Z,This is the real deal. Thanx For the upload jakenold. Great stuff.
,jasonbir,2007-11-01T16:35Z,"Thanks, sorry for doubting you, it was 100% real and HILARIOUS"
