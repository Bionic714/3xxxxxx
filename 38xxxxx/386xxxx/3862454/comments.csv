,tetreaultn54,2007-10-30T06:24Z,"really good quality, not a cam"
,davey2face,2007-11-04T00:12Z,"Easily the best movie I've seen all year, which makes me feel guilty for getting the torrent. First, the acting in this is excellent as Denzel easily steals the show. Russell Crowe is good, too but his parts simply slows the movies and you''ll realize its more of Lucas life that you want to see! Great movie!

Video=9 Audio=9. It can get no better than that!"
,Elt-,2007-11-04T20:14Z,"holy cow! if the quality in the movie is the same as the sample, this is the best torrent ever before a dvd rip!
