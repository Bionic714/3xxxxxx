,padfest,2007-11-02T17:35Z,Thanks!!!!!!!!!!! 
,BritneysOrifice,2007-11-02T18:39Z,Hmmm... does this little diddy need to be cracked? Or does it already work fine?
,belltaco,2007-11-02T18:56Z,With old Enable Button crack from Maximus it work fine (till now).Thanks for upload!
,BritneysOrifice,2007-11-02T19:08Z,"BellTaco: really? That would be great if it does. Did you test it? Do all the MFDs show up? I've heard that the EnableButton crack will work, but the MFDs are all blank. Can you verify?"
,belltaco,2007-11-02T21:14Z,"So,maybe is not so simple,some work ,some not,all MFDs (PFD,ND,EICAS)are o.k.,but i have no digits in radios,ATC display,pushback panel,clocks.Maybe this need still something else,except Enable button. "
,CaptainKirkard,2007-11-02T23:43Z,"bt,

Have you tried a reboot ? Some have this issue with a legit install also, fonts need to re-register or something..."
,belltaco,2007-11-03T08:18Z,"Good idea,after reboot is everything fine,my bad."
,MrAnthonyWong,2007-11-06T02:21Z,is this the latest patch? the one that was released in additon with 744x?
,e_pimp,2007-11-06T14:38Z,Can someone please upload and seed the new PMDG 747-400X (Updated full version) + crack?
,e_pimp,2007-11-08T11:57Z,"Okay guys. I installed this FS9 update and all seemed well, but after a about half a minute into flight my PC froze completely. This issue persisted every time I flew again, even in other non pmdg aircraft. Uninstalled this update and all is fine again. I post this just in case it happens to you and you can't figure out where the fault lies. Belive me its not funny trying to discover a fault like this. However, this issue might not happen to everyone, so let us know if yours works."
