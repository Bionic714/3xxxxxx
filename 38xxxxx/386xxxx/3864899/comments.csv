,niomalia,2007-10-30T11:56Z,Would you please start seeding this? I really want to play it^^
,dysperdis,2007-11-01T08:15Z,"There was an issue with this- for some weird reason, when I saved my game, it changed the copy I was seeding from as well as the copy that's installed in my programs. I'm going to make a new torrent, but I'm going to zip the files first to keep this from happening again. Sorry about this- I'll link to it when I get it up."

,posterboy_mr,2010-12-03T23:12Z,"I installed the software and it runs ok, but the subtitles / story is incomprehensible characters.

Is this because of a language setting_ Can I set the subtitles to English? How?

Many thanks!!! "
