,Ieshna,2007-10-31T17:09Z,US Version.  Anyone have the Canadian version of Quicken 2008?
,tortus,2007-11-15T17:12Z,Is there a fix for the nags?
,Newb787,2008-01-15T02:01Z,I have the Canadian Version....I'm trying to find where I got it from. But the torrents details are here: Quicken_2008_-_Home_and_Business_-_Canadian_Version.3953220.TPB.torrent
,ABCworld,2008-01-21T06:58Z,What kind of file is this? .ISO?
,chimpakawanzelu,2008-04-17T07:05Z,"It's a .rar file, which means you un-compress it with a program called WinRar.  It is similar to WinZip - a program that compresses / uncompresses files.  Smart uploaders, such as Ogre_MHDW, rar files to make them smaller to share over the internet.  It's free for 40 days at www.rarlab.com (select language near bottom of page).  Or you can find it on TPB with a crack (tee-hee-hee).  Cheers!"
,chimpakawanzelu,2008-04-17T08:00Z,"Thank you for the great upload, Ogre_MHDW!!!

Installed perfectly on Vista Home Prem. 32bit.

Cheers!!"

Thanks for the download, I wonder if Quicken is pushing more from a service angle by providing this free software, then sell services?"
