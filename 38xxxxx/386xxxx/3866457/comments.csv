,PotattoBobby,2007-12-12T22:34Z,"Could anyone seed this, please.
I've been stuck for more than a month on 21.8%.

@DjAlCubilas, could you please jump in and help us so that people could finish this very rare torrent ?"
,EastCoastBoy,2007-12-22T20:09Z,Kinda sucks when something you've just notice is here is now dead.  :-(
,PotattoBobby,2007-12-25T05:11Z,"Yeah, and it sucks even more when you keep unfinished torrent in download list for ages, hoping that at least one seeder will show up eventualy... but he never does. :(

Is there anybody out there ? :)"
,Gagat1,2008-01-24T02:18Z,"Since the original uploader didn't bother to finish this film, I'll do my best to do HIS job.

I found this movie on the eMule network, and hopefully everything will work out fine here, since it's the same file afterall...

Just bare with me, I don't have the best upload speed, but I'll do my best."
,DjAlCubilas,2008-08-07T09:34Z,"Sorry, lost my HD with the originals (and the upload links) about a week after I posted. Thanks for the help everyone!"
