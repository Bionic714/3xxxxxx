,OnTime_76,2007-11-11T16:32Z,"I am slowly getting them at about 10/kbs, I dont understand why people will not stay on after completion. Yesterday i saw that there were 2 seeders on all 3 dvd's   I have very high upload speeds   on completion i will either reup individually or make a big package and seed for a long time        IF they ever finish!!!!"
,OnTime_76,2007-11-17T21:18Z,If someone wants me to re-up these with good speeds let me know...   they are ready whenever
,Doggedoggedogge,2007-12-21T15:18Z,"Yeah please reupload this with good seed, it would be really nice of you."

,rolus,2008-08-30T12:41Z,I am ATM seeding all 3 DVD's at 3.2MB/s
,codgecodge,2008-09-24T02:43Z,"I've just got to 100% with this. Still waitg on 1 and 3. It is an ISO and when I burn it to disc it then poens up as 3 bin files. I can't get past this.
Any advice on how to get it working?
I've tried mounting it without burning and same result. Maybe I need to wait for all 3 discs but wouldn't have thought so.
If anyone can help I and others here are gonna love you!-not like that."
,me1900,2008-10-30T05:17Z,HEY PEOPLE THINK!!!! VERY FEW SEEDERS ON THESE 3 DVD's!!! THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO UPLOAD AT LEAST 40 kbps!!!!!! IF THERE WAS MORE THEN 200 THEN I CAN SEE LOW LIMIT UPLOAD!!!! 10 kbps IS NOT ENUFF LOOKS LIKE PPL ARE SEEDING AT 2kbps PER SEEDER THINK!!!! THINK!!!! THINK!!!!
