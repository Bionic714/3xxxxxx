,pjelew84,2007-10-29T21:21Z,i hope this one will work! Thnx anyway for your time! Cheers
,robotphood,2007-10-30T08:05Z,"moneymike423, this one or the previous one? 

As far as I know the previous torrent can't be fixed. Thanks for the re-up."
,uioplkjhbnmm,2007-10-30T17:49Z,"You can fix the last torrent you just have to make the video sync there is something wrong with the whole time line files in the .iso and if you just go in and fix that i would work. allot alot of work. 

The computer is going away or my friend how owns the computer is going away and this means no seeding until he comes back(sometime next week). Sorry about this but thats life if you cant wait download the free movie first chair last call from Special Blend for free here:
http://www.special-blend.com/firstchairlastcall/
and if you still cant wait go buy the movie from Think Thank in your local shop or somewhere on the Internet!
Thanks!"

,theforeigner117,2008-08-06T07:46Z,"I'm having a problem with this...and other DVDR torrents that I have downloaded. I am streaming it to my PS3 and watching it on my tv, but it plays each chapter independently, and only the first chapter has audio....I think i can fix the problem if I combine all the files together but I don't know how. Any advice?

Great torrent by the way, this is one of my favorites"
,Crudson,2008-08-15T06:05Z,"K dude I have a serious request, and it's on behalf of like 10 of my friends as well haha. If you have bought Stack Footy can you PLEASE rip it and upload it. I've been waiting for that shit all year haha. If you could it'd be a HUGE favour. Thanks a lot.
Cody"
,Crudson,2008-08-15T06:12Z,"Oh and can it be like a dvdrip with a video file, so that it's faster to download and we can be seeding in a shorter time. Thanks again bro."
