[Snowboard 2008] Thanks, Brain! - Think Thank

This is the exact same thing as last time just some small changes to save time!
Since the last Torrent had a corrupt file this one has been put up as a repost.
I have posted it in Audio_TS and Video_TS format to make sure nothing goes wrong this time. If you dont know how to burn from this format Read this:
For Windows:
Use Nero to burn and watch on your DVD player first!
Burn a Video-DVD and move the VIDEO_TS files to VIDEO_TS in nero!
And press burn!
For Mac:
1. Run toast 6.X 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3406247/Toast_Titanium_6.1_for_MAc_OS_X_Final.sit
2. Select the DATA tab
3. Under the disc options window tab, select ADVANCED
4. Select "DVD-ROM (UDF)"
5. Select "New Disc" and name it with
Optimistic
6. Add your new VIDEO_TS folder to the disc.
7. Add or create an AUDIO_TS folder, even if it is empty.
(Some players like to see this folder)
8. Burn (Use slowest speed you can stand to wait for)
DO NOT USE THE "VIDEO" TAB. This is for creating VideoCD, or DVD from video files such as MPG, AVI etc. It is NOT for burning DVD from ripped files!!! This is something MANY
people don't understand!!!
8.5 In version 6.0.7 I believe you CAN burn a "DVD From
VIDEO_TS Folder" from the Video tab.

That's it! 
Or ph3xxa recommended the freeware "DVD imager".

If you dont like the format or have something against me for posting the movie in this Format then please go buy the movie and you can have it any way you want.
For any other questions please ask in post and ill try to answer you.
