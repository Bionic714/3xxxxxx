Review from Release Magazine:
Classic in structure and mood, but highly modern in sound and production, "Noob" abandons the lingering experimental itch of recent albums. De/Vision have made a pop album high in intensity and tempo, full of glances to the past while maintaining a high profile contemporary framework.
Giving more room for straight forward synthpop means having to produce stronger songs. A challenge song writer Steffen Keth answers by writing some of De/Vision's best songs to date. The Depeche tribute "What You Deserve", "Life is Suffering", a synthetic paradox for the dance floor, the single "Flavour of the Week" and the epic "Far Side of the Moon" are all fantastic pop worthy of worldwide recognition. A few bores, like the drearily uninspired "Nine Lives" and "Death of Me", can not take away from a great electropop disc.
"Noob" is accomplished, catchy and full of the pop bliss associated with the earlier days of the band. Enjoy it while it lasts.

Enjoy!
