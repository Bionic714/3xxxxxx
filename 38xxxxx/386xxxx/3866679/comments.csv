,kiasta,2007-11-24T15:53Z,Do you have to install the previous versions of the MSDN Library to install this?  Or is that not required?
,kiasta,2007-11-25T14:10Z,"Lol nvm that was a really dumb question, I was half asleep when i asked that...btw can i get some more seeders plz?  Thanks."
,chikodef,2007-12-04T00:40Z,"I recommend to keep original docs. Some experts say a bit of useful articles are missing in new docs. Anyway this collection of docs is a must have for a .NET 1.x developer.
Original docs is October 2003 release. You can find it in torrent ""Visual Studio .NET 2003 Enterprise - Full Discset"". Some original Visual Studio .NET 2003 CDs contains older docs. These docs must be updated with the MS patch. To find it please look for ""October 2003 Visual Studio .NET Documentation Update"" on the MS web site."
,12114,2009-01-03T18:58Z,hey chikodef is this for visual studio 2003 .NET?or just visual studio 2003? or for both?
,smartsoft,2009-03-08T07:50Z,"Don't know about deletions, but some docs have added. For example, Media Center at Platform SDK.

Looking on the files, it seems the docs are rebuilt and they structure changed. File-by-file size difference from Oct2003 is about 1 MB. :)"
