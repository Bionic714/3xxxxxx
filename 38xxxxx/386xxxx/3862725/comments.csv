,Projectil3,2008-04-02T11:24Z,"Oh, My, Gosh.

Thank you for the Wonderful collection of Breaking Benjamin Albums!!

And BTW, a Very good Choice on Encoder & Quality.

I use Q9 350 Kbps @ VBR (OGG Vorb), SSE2 Optimized (Lancer)

so we're not that much different! =]

thanks for the premium torrent man, I'll definitely see this piece of cake!"

Please grace me with the presence of your upload because that's how bad I want this! =P"
