 most of the episodes are WITHOUT music videos and in very nice quality. about 20% of the episodes ALSO have a lower quality version which includes music videos.

,seanrquinn,2008-10-16T05:28Z,"these are in avi format, as are most videos on this site due to compression ratios. If you want dvd formats, look in the dvd-rip section."

,chipset77,2008-12-16T00:12Z,"I dont think anyone can improve the collection.
You are the man.."
,chuchunesme,2009-06-10T18:58Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!! This is one of the the most complete collections I've ever seen!! I have old VHS tapes in storage with a lot of episodes recorded the day they first aired. A lot of these have stuff in them that was cut out later, like them sniffing stove gas at Stuarts house. If I find any that aren't in your collection or ones that you included that are cut I'll try to convert and upload those."
