,burftoo,2007-11-02T04:38Z,Disappointment. Download doesn't do shit. There's not even a program here.

,KillingFrost,2007-12-04T01:52Z,"Iknow for a fact that this program does do mkv with subtitles because I have done it many times , and I also have hundreds of dvd's with this program , and it is simple to use, but if you get the serial just make sure it is current the last one i got was only valid in 1964 so be carefull other wise this programs is great"
,DavidGGG,2007-12-27T17:21Z,"Thanks for this! Worked perfectly on the AVIs I tried and it's super-easy to use! The crack does the job and is virus/spyware free. 

Regarding RAR files: they require winrar or winzip (which you can get on PB) or 7zip (which is free), I thought it was a requirement to know that much before trying to download from PB... ;-)"
