At Brookdale Institute,
where the wealthy go for rehab,
something lurks behinde the walls. Years ago they conducted experiments on lab rats.
The Scientists have moved on ...
but the rats remain and have mutated and multiplied.
Now the genetically altered beasts are out for blood and have a taste of human flesh.
Witg the clinic`s patients locked inside it`s only matter of time before the rats find 
their way in for their next meal.
