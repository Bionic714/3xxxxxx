The entire released soundtracks to the 90's TV show "Forever Knight" with Geraint Wyn Davies and Nigel Bennett.  Two CD's, each with over twenty tracks!  

And if you don't care about the score, that's fine, because those songs you liked in the background of the scenes in the Raven nightclub are on here too!

It took me a while to find these, and I'm glad to have them, so I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.
