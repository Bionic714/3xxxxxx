,spacekitty13,2008-08-16T19:33Z,"I have been looking everywhere for this!!  It was done by a great 80's Los Angeles ""art rock"" band called Fibonacci that I used to see in the clubs back then. They have a lot of other recordings but this one is impossible to find.
Please seed!!
Thanks!
P.S. The movie is not bad, either..."
