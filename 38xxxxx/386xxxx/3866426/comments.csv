,fragglet,2009-04-08T04:12Z,"Yeah, way to go, just put all the episodes in an ISO file so that it's impossible to download individual episodes without downloading all the season one episodes I already have.  

Twat."
,badprenup,2009-05-08T07:55Z,"yeah cause these episodes are so absolutely fucking massive that the fact that you can't pick and choose makes it terrible. (sarcasm)

either your internet sucks so hard that 7 min clips inconvenience your dl times so bad or ur just a whiny bitch of a troll fragglet. your name implies its a bit of both.

great torrent"
,badprenup,2009-05-08T07:59Z,"altho i do say the fact that it is 4.35 gigs is a bit surprising as a decent rip of a 30min south park episode is only 178 mb and theres only 6 30 min eps (not sure bout pilot and calcium, never seen those."
,badprenup,2009-05-08T08:05Z,"sorry for trip comment but if you go here you can get the other episodes individually, altho some seem to be split into multiple parts, nothing windows movie maker can't fix

,steinhole,2010-03-19T03:32Z,"I don't mean to bust anyone's balls and I'm certainly not complaining, but for the record, I believe there are only 15 episodes contained in this .iso file. Either way, thanks a bunch oddeven for putting this together. I'm gonna check out the link from the above comment."
,steinhole,2010-03-19T04:14Z,"Ok, I figured it out. Episode 3.6 ""Sleep"" doesn't exist. This must be a joke by the uploader, oddeven. Nice.

However, there are two unseen episodes, according to Wikipedia. They are ""Blood"" and ""Further Maths"". I couldn't find them anywhere."
,Eyegore,2010-07-06T22:42Z,"Why the hell would you put these in one giant ISO file instead of using individual files for each episode?  Are you fucking retarded?  Now I have to spend the next hour fixing this shit.  From me and all the other people who got burned by this bullshit, fuck you!"
[T],oddeven,2011-05-09T13:11Z,"Um, Eyegore, after looking at your expansive list of uploads, I'll just say, it was posted as DVDR, number of files, 1.  Just how were you burned by anything other than your own stupidity?"
,Antula,2011-05-31T00:28Z,"calm down now children, and just be grateful you get to watch this :D"
,zekeisaszekedoes,2011-08-11T18:58Z,"Quality not so good I'm afraid.  Super blocky, especially with any kind of motion.  I downloaded it to get season 2, but stood next to the VOBs from the season 1 DVD I own it's unwatchable."
,Emperor420,2011-10-23T01:02Z,"Seed PREASE! 50kb/s jumping from 17 to 22 hours completion. man i had downloaded this iso then i accidentally deleted it without backing it up. did this before with 16gb's of frank sinatra, that was a trip to re-download. but yea, i love this show. the first season is alright but the second season is hilarious. so if some people can seed for the next few days or so, so i dont have to wait for-fucking-ever and a day again haha. thanks much!!"
,Emperor420,2011-10-23T20:36Z,"man i dont know if anyone started seeding cuz i asked but, this shit got done overnight. thanks guys for seeding if ya did. take it easy and smoke all day every day"
,Emperor420,2011-10-24T18:34Z,"ha well it turns out i was just high. i searched my ext hdd as ""look around you"" with spaces. but the file nam is ""lookaroundyou"" without spaces. haha so yea i already had it."
