,Un4goten_Syn,2009-06-08T10:20Z,"I'm seeding the Hell out of Disk's 1 through 4, but like my earlier post, need a seeder with 100% to be able to finish the 5th disk."
,Un4goten_Syn,2009-06-10T00:34Z,"a note to all Torrentors, please seed for as long as you can.  If you don't, either a slow download with a standstill will occur, or a dead torrent.  Do you want that to happen?  Then please seed, because Sharing is Caring"

,d3m0n1q_733rz,2010-03-15T01:04Z,"Would everyone please seed this or at least keep it queued in case seeds seriously begin to drop like it has now?  After all, if you ever lose the data, you'll have to download it all over again.  And who's fault will it be when you can't get another seed of it?"
