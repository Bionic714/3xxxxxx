I wouldn't care if I knew Spanish.
If it is I'll update with a new comment after I try the file. 

Eventually I'll just buy the game when I get a damn job! -_-"

Btw is this the REAL SH2DC!? I mean I've only seen a release of it for the ps2. If this is real does it have anything different and if so then what? If there is one for the pc I'd rather buy it if anyone knows where I can find it."

,ramthor,2008-02-07T08:36Z,If it's an .img file or something then you need to mount it to a virtual drive like daemons tools. Then you can install the program and play the game.

 OK so I downloaded this for like a week, and when It finishes, it's just a bunch of weird files and some Cd image RARs. when I try to unpack the RAR files, it gets to the very end of the loading bar and stops, with the estimated time about 762354887236 hours. no joke. a really big huge fucking number. 

now I don't know If I'm just being stupid or something, but can someone help me out?"

1. Install the Game - Full with Videos
2. extract all files to the install dir
3. overwrite the sh2pc.exe when asked
4. execute the nocd crack

1. check.
2. extract what files? the ones on cd2 and cd3? it says no sufficient files or something to that matter. so i can't extract those if this is what i'm supposed to do.
3. i have done this.
4. what crack? the file extracted from the crack WAS the sh2pc.exe file. 

so i have installed it with videos, swapped the sh2pc.exe file. but when i start the game up, my screen goes black. and it doesnt respond. so any help would be greatly appreciated."

,Grifmik,2008-07-21T05:00Z,"Right what i think people are failing to help people with, is that what your supposed to do with the crack (hoping your smart enough to atleast figure out how to install the game) is once you finish the setup, and it would appear that silent hill 2 is installed fine, unrar silent hill 2 CD 1, and find the crack named ""sh2pc.exe"" copy it, and then take it to My computer, program files, konami, silent hill 2,  and then throw it in there.

You will then be told there is already a file named this, and you click the option which will mean overwrite the exsisting file. I think thats where most people are getting stuck at."

Every torrent has the same lazy people asking the same stupid questions. 

Look ... I can understand being new to certain things. I can even understand how learning new technologies can be intimidating. What I cannot understand for the fucking life of me is how you stupid fucking monkeys have yet to have heard of ""GOOGLE"". 
Don't you get that you can find out just about anything that you could possibly ever want to know by typing in your question into the google search engine? People have even invented a new verb for it, it's called ""googling"" something.
Why in gods name would you come back here and ask the same fucking question that 5 or 6 other morons have already asked without being answered? Did you even bother to read the other posts?
HOW ABOUT YOU GO AND RESEARCH HOW TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF, RATHER THAN ASK THE ANONYMOUS PEOPLE OF THE INTERNET TO HOLD YOUR HAND WHILE YOU LEARN TO INSTALL A FUCKING GAME? WHY CAN'T YOU JUST READ THE FUCKING DIRECTIONS? WHY ARE YOU SO STUPID??????AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Restart your comptuer (dont install direct x 8 when it prompts, just install the newest version from microsoft page (which is 10) later.

Got to programfiles/konami/silenthill2 and replace the sh2pc.exe file with the same file in the NOCD folder.

you do not need the other file in the NOCD (it has a worm) so just leave it.

We've all had our early troubles with this stuff, so try to be somewhat courteous to others who are just trying to play for free, too.

,kolokythis,2010-05-09T15:15Z,"Step by step guide for all these who have trouble. The game works perfectly if you make the correct steps:

1. Once the download is complete you will have four folders, three SHDC_1-3 with the images and one SHDC_NoCD with the crack.

2. Go to the first folder. You will find many RAR files and one ZIP. Unrar one file.

3. Inside the decompressed folder there are three new arhives: an IMAGE1 zip file, an IMAGE1.ccd and an IMAGE1.sub. For installing the game you will use the zip file.

4. Do the same at the SHCD_2 and SCHD_3   folders.

5. Open Daemon Tools (I have the free edition and I'm doing perfectly my job), right click the shortcut in your trace bar>virtual CD>mount image and browse to the first decompressed SHCD folder. Select All files (otherwise the program recognizes only the ccd file) and mount the IMAGE1.zip file.

6. Start to installing. When asked choose the movies on the hard disk.

7. Once finished the first disk unmount it and mount the second, then the third.

8. At the end the program asks to mount again the first disk. Do it but DON'T install DirectX 8.0. Click finish. Don't launch the game.

9. Go to the SHCD_NoCD folder and unzip the crack. Copy and paste the content in game's directory. When asked, overwrite the sh2pc.exe

10. You must run the Silent Hill 2 eng [nocd] patch, otherwise every time you start the game will ask for cd.

11.It is better to run the game directly from the exe in the folder, not from the shortcut. If you have problems with the sound go control panel>sounds and multimedia>audio>playback>advanced>move the hardware acceleration bar to the left.
Vista users run the game as administrators.

Now, to all these big-mouth morons who are calling idiots the people who asking for help: tell me, have you born with the knowledge? Is it more difficult to write the damn answer instead of insults? 
These guys are the most annoying thing in TPB and all the trackers!"

,schmirher,2010-05-22T20:23Z,Seed Please!!!!!!!
,street_pirate,2010-06-07T01:18Z,"This game works fine and here is how you install it for any noobs not sure what to do:

1. The folders for SHDC_CD1, 2, and 3 will be full of .RAR files. Extract them to their respective folders (i.e. extract the .rar files in SHDC_CD1 to the folder called SHDC_CD1 and so on)

2. You should now have a .IMG and a .SUB file of each of the three CD's in each one of the folders. 

3. Save your disks! No need to burn these to disk or anything like that.  Download MagicISO Virtual CD/DVD Manager. It's free and works great. Or use anything else you want, i don't really care. 

4. Create 1 virtual drive and mount the .ISO from the CD1 folder. A silent hill 2 menu will pop up and click install game. 

5. Partway through the installation it will ask you to insert CD2. Before you click anything, unmount CD1 and mount CD2. Then click OK. Do the same for when it asks you to insert CD3. Towards the end on the installation it will ask you to insert CD1 once again. After this the game is installed. Do not place a shortcut on the Desktop as it will be garbage after the next step.

6. Go to the folder SHDC_NoCD. Extract the files in there to the same folder. Now go find the folder that the game actually installed into (for me is was Program Files(x86)\Konami\Silent Hill 2.
Now from the SHDC_NoCD folder copy and paste the 2 files you extracted called 'Silent Hill 2 eng [ nocd ].exe' and 'sh2pc.exe'.

7. Double click  'Silent Hill 2 eng [ nocd ].exe' first and apply the patch. You're all done! Use 'sh2pc.exe' to play your game. Make a shortcut on your desktop now if you want."

THis PC is fairly new so I'm sure it can run this game at ease."
,ShinusukeAkki,2010-08-02T15:27Z,"I have succesfully installed the games, overwrit the file and executed the other file. But when I open it (i am opening the sh2pc.exe file) it says:
The program can't start because binkw32.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.
Please tell me I don't have to bloody install it again, where the hell is this file? Sorry, but if anyone couls help I would be unbelievibly grateful. "

,dal2511,2011-05-15T11:30Z,"People, have you tried running the patch as administrator? This solved the problem for me:
When I put the crack in the original exe folder, and tried to patch it, it said it couldn't find it. Then I closed the patch and ran it as administrator, clicked ""Apply patch"" and it worked."
