,Vidar01,2008-06-12T17:38Z,"Novub: You need a program such as Winrar, you can download a trial version free or just find a torrent of it. you need to open any part of the .001, .002, .003 etc files with winrar and then click extract to and navigate to where you want the watchable file."

,oPiN37,2008-08-08T13:49Z,"Vidar01, thank you! I´ve skipped downloading soooo many torrents, just because I didn´t know how to use it... but, if a serie is like this, do you have to download everything to see just one episode?"
,oPiN37,2008-08-08T23:55Z,"okey, problem!! yes, that worked - thank you Vidar01 - it worked... =) the problem is that I can´t find the episodes 3-4... anyone knows where to find them?"
