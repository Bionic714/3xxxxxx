Video: res 704x296. bitrate 601kbs. 25 fps. Encoded with h.264/AVC

Don't dis the quality till you've seen it, you wont be disappointed

Encoded in AVC (h.264) meaning better quality/smaller file size. So you may not be able to play it straight on older DivX players... 
I have quite a slow upspeed also so it may take a day or 2 for the first seeders...

Use VLC to play
Looks like a good flick, I haven't actually seen it yet, just thought I'd rip it to watch one day when time arises
