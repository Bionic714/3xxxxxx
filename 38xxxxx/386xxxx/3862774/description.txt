CD 1
You go to my head
They can?t take that away from me
The way you look tonight
It had to be you
That old feeling
These foolish things
The very thought of you
Moonglow
I?ll be seeing you
Every time we say goodbye
The nearness of you
For all we know
We?ll be together again
That?s all

CD 2
Time after time
I?m in the mood for love
Don?t get around much anymore
Bewitched, bothered & bewildered (Duet with Cher)
?Till there was you
Until the real thing comes along
Where or when
Smile
My heartstood still
Someone to watch over me
As time goes by (with Queen Latifah)
I only have eyes for you
Crazy she calls me
Our love is here to stay
Roving Gambler

Manhattan (duet with Bette Midler)
?S wonderful
Isn?t romantic
I can?t get started
But not for me
A kiss to build a dream on
Baby, it?s cold outside
Night and day
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
