,Claranger,2007-11-09T04:23Z,"Yes it works, and it is a good game.
But it doesn't seem ti be Dungeon Siege 2. It is Dungeon Siege - Legends of Aranna. it is exactly the same as Legends of Aranna even though it claims to be DS2.  "
,draken-ex,2007-12-01T15:54Z,"hey Claranger what a LIAR!! it IS DS2, legends of aranna is only 1.67 GB, I've downloaded it and it works, pls don't try to confuse ppl with your lies "
,Piruz,2007-12-06T16:43Z,"WHERE IS THE CD KEY???
Or product key or whatever it is?
How can you draken-ex install this game and test it, if you dont have CD KEY?? 
Its not in download folder, its not in .bin files.
Where is it?? Or does this have it at all? It asks for it.

THANK YOU!"

,jobor18,2008-06-05T04:41Z,"could someone plz explain to me how to install this game. i have all the files, and i can extract them, but i havnt got a clue what to do with them. thanks in advance"
,scibot1989,2008-06-07T01:49Z,"seed, seed, seed, pls"
,emonquente,2008-06-09T01:57Z,"Okay, installation is very simple

You get the four cd folders, each with like 40 rar files right? --- so download Altap Salamander, (winrar should work also) and move the two files from -any- of those 40 files, it will compile the rar collection, you can then delete the 40 summad rar files to save space. 

Repeat on other three disks

Now get Virtual CloneDrive (because it's easy as hell, and compatable with Vista, whereas everything else seems a bit buggy to me) -- it automatically makes .bin associate with it! So you can just click on any of the .bin(s) and it'll auto-mount (and in my case auto-run), just install with the cd key provided in thiese comments 

Kesarion posted this:

"" JF282-YTKJM-H76H8-XQP96-8PTBQ ""

Now when it asks to insert the next disc just go to its bin and click it (if you have auto-run enabled in vista it'll just continue installing after a bit, otherwise you ahve to click 'ok')

That's it! Click play now if you like, whatever, just be sure to mount CD1 again first (again, just double-click the bin!)

now if you're using DaemonTools, you'll need to actually go to the tool in your taskbar, right click>Virtual CD/DVD Rom>> (pick one)>> Mount Image>>rld-ds2a.cue (or 2b,2c,2d as corrospond with the disk you're on).

Don't use multiple drives to instal regardless your tool choice if you're on Vista, it seems to be a little buggy (for me at least), and it's not that hard to just use one slot per game.

BTW, the game will ALWAYS check the cd/dvd drive you installed with for the cd if it needs one to play (this is why we install with only one drive per game), sometimes it will only check there first, sometimes that's the ONLy place it will check. So maybe write it down, or set up only 1 drive with the tool.

HAVE FUN!"
,scibot1989,2008-06-10T18:45Z,"thx for the help emonquente... I think i too am able to install the game now... but I don't think u can extract the two files out of every rar archive, only one actually has both the one file with .rar at the end which looks like all the others... but thanks for the description :P"
,scibot1989,2008-06-10T23:44Z,"btw, I don't know if this is dungeon siege II or not, I once played a newer version of dungeon siege then this one."

,ardendole,2008-08-20T08:02Z,"downloaded this, followed emonquente's instructions (very nice, thanks!) and it looks like it installed properly, but I can't get it to run.

I'd played the game once, a while back, so I deleted my old DS2 data, but it looks like no matter whether I use the nocd crack or not, I can get to the main menu, but can't click on any option.

Any ideas?"
