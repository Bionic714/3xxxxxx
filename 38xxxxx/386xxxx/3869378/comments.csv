,BlackMaryFlint,2007-12-23T17:35Z,"I would suggest you find a new ISP. Comcast is noctorious for blocking torrents and threatening customers who download them with legal action.

If I were you, I would leave them and let them know why. They don't know why you are torrenting. For all they know you are a CEO trying to get valuable information to a client or employee, that is too large for email or fax! Torrents are not just for pirates. Comcast makes me sick!"
