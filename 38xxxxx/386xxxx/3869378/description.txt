This is the Biggest Loser workout complete DVD including menus and extra features!

I wanted to make it an XVID so it would be smaller but this is an interactive DVD with multiple audio tracks and if you could not navigate thru the DVD menu to choose which of the multiple workouts you want then it would be very inconvenient for somebody following the exercises.

And because many Noobs dont understand what ISO is that is why I have left it as a normal DVD.  

This is compressed down to 4.3GB so it will fit on a standard DVD-R disc that you can burn it to and watch on your stand-alone DVD player.  

Enjoy! and best of luck to you on your fitness goals!!
