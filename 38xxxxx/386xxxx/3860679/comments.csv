,4dalove,2008-04-19T22:20Z,"Not sure if this an .iso or what but for those getting the ""Waiting for disk..."" window after you install -

Just install the .ISO you burned (or mount the .iso on the virtual drive - ImageDrive, PowerISO, Alcohol, etc...)

If the window doesn't close and continue, make sure the disc has the following label ""Reason 4"" - no quotes.

it will give you an option to choose what type of files you want powerISO to read, tick all boxes after that i could use extract, but then it asks for the DVD, so I then mounted it and found that it work perfect and had no problems.I found that powerISO is the best for ISO dl that  need to be mounted...yes I am seeding for you dl'ers

Go to google. Type in 'using iso image files'
Type in ""virtual dvd-rom drives""
Type in ""installing applications from iso image files""

,mkmacabre,2008-07-26T15:14Z,"@ stevekasian + masterbruker93.

Agreed. However, while i am no ""expert"" it's not like i have not done this before. My problem here is that i do not appear to have the .iso file to mount! 

Usually, after extracting the rar, the .iso file can be seen in the folder along with the other contents, right?

,mkmacabre,2008-07-26T15:33Z,"If it helps:

When extracting the files, winrar quits after it extracts the orkestra.rfl but winrar states that there are still 36 seconds untill install is complete and the total progress bar has not reached 100% when it automatically quits.

,MarinkoAzure,2008-09-01T19:51Z,"Alright, I don't know why I didn't get this the first time around. I know how to solve some problems you are having.

To do so, let me plagiarize most of what djblunt said. My comments will be in [brackets].

1. Download the torrent-duh [duh, again :) ]

2. While it's downloading, download a copy of Daemon Tools, Alcohol 120 or some other image mounting device that handles iso (if you don't have one.) [I used Daemon Tools Lite, available for free from their website.]

3. Download a winrar or 7zip. (7 zip is like winrar but BETTER. AND you can DOWNLOAD IT LEGIT FOR FREE!) [Most computers have an unlimited trail version of similar software that seems to get the job done. If you are unable to extract the files, follow this step.]

4. Once you have the entire torrent (I'll seed it for a while) run winrar/7zip and open the torrent inside of it. [A bit confused here myself, I'm going to make this long and simple. Open the torrent and initiate the file transfer via a bittorrent client. Most importantly, what i noticed when using uTorrent was that the .torrent contained two files, the keygen.exe and the reason 4.iso. After the file transfer is complete, if you open the folder, you can find only the .exe and the .rar.

5. Once the torrent is open/extracted, or whatever, run Daemon Tools. Click on the icon at the bottom in the toolbar. Click a drive to use. A window will pop open. If the torrent isn't in the address window ""Browse"" for the torrent. [If your having trouble finding the .iso image, mount the .rar file instead.  That seems to be the missing .iso file disguised as a .rar]

6. Once you have the torrent inside of the address window of Daemon Tools, click enter and it will be placed inside the main area of Daemon Tools. Click on the torrent to mount it and click open.

[I think that should fix the problem of the missing .iso file. It is defined as a .rar file. I may or may not check back if some of you are still having problems.]

7. If it does not automatically start running, go to ""My Computer"" and click on the drive that Reason is on (you should see an image of the Reason disk on the vitual drive.) Click on the icon and should start installing. Follow the directions. It took me all of 15 minutes to install after I had the torrent. good luck "

1: Download torrent, one is an ISO, the other is a keygen, get it? two files? the one that says Keygen EXE isn't the iso, dipshits

2: quit being a cheap fucker and get a blank DVD-r (wow 30 cents). you are obviously too retarded to use a mounting tool, so BURN THE FUCKING ISO TO DISK (use Nero or alcohol, or whatever if you can't burn an ISO to DVD your computer is dirty and needs to be cleaned, just put in in the dishwasher on pots and pans setting, you dumb fucking idiot) 

3: put DVD you just made in DVD tray, it should start auto install, if not explore, and double click setup.exe, or autorun.exe. Install the program, when it asks for a serial, use keygen.EXE. then like any other program, when it asks for the disk, use the one you just burned you whiny fuckstick dildos.

Here are instructions for opening it with Nero:

2. Open Nero StartSmart program
3. Choose ""Burn Image to Disc"" under the Copy and Backup section
4. Burn the .iso image to a DVD disc in your DVD drive
5. Once it's finished burning, insert the DVD back into the DVD drive and it will automatically run the setup program. Wah-lah, you now have Reason 4.

,Slingerlander,2009-03-18T00:01Z,"Huops!! Thank you man.  Used this program in Uni and had a laugh with it.   been searching for it for a while.    

Just 1 question...   when i try to register i get an error message telling me its the wrong serial.    I'm using the same code from the key-gen that i used for install.    can u confirm that its version 4.0x i should select  or, is it the  4.0 beta?     I have tried alternate key-gen generations but just get the same message I'm afraid.    

Hope to hear from someone soon!

,Slidehylsa,2009-03-27T12:42Z,"Hi guys! First thing first; thanks to all Houps and all the seeders : )

And now the problem: when I mount the .iso in deamon tools and choose ""run autostart.exe"" a window pops up and says: ""Please log on as Administrator"", and requires username and password. I've tried to solve the problem and I've red all the comments but I just can't find a solution. Please, can someone give a answer where I find that username/password. 

Thanks again"

,harry31290,2010-05-03T22:36Z,"Okay, I had some difficulties as well, but I managed to solve them. So here's what I think most of you got problems with.  And this is how you proceed with your installation:

1. Download torrent. If you don't know how to do this properly, go to FAQ and start reading.

2. When downloaded, open the folder and there should be two files; a KeyGen file and the Reason Studio file. Note, this file is in fact the ISO file that many of you had trouble looking for! If you check the file extension it should say .iso. 

3. Now what you should do here is either try mounting it with Daemon Tools. Or you could simply unzip it with WinRar and it will open up into a folder. However, here is when the problem occurs. 

4. Get a blank DVD-ROM, insert it into the disc drive and burn the original ISO file into that disc as a Data DVD. There are plenty of software that let you do this. Try right-click onto the Reason 4.iso file and select burn into disc. Note: you burn the original ISO file not after you have unzipped it.

5. Regardless of your unziping method, afterward you will end up with a folder which contains all the set up files.

6. The installation itself should be fairly quick and simple. Took me about 2 minutes max. follow the instructions and you will have Reason 4 installed.

7. However this is where the problem starts. If you click onto the Reason 4 desktop icon, it will ask you to insert the DVD after accepting terms and conditions, if you did not burn you DVD earlier, it will not let you go any further.

8. So just burn the DVD with the original ISO file that you downloaded and you should be getting it working just fine.

9. I didn't seem to have any other problems so hope this helps."
,harry31290,2010-05-03T22:41Z,"Edit to my earlier comment:

10. If you got past step 9, it will take about 5-10 minutes to install the program completely this time. You will also be asked to put in a serial number at this point so that's where the keyGen comes in. Just select your software and generate accordingly.

11. I guess that's it. Good luck. And don't try to register, they might flag your software, so just to be safe, don't do it."
,jibslumsshredgnar,2010-05-08T19:28Z,"i have done everything on the list including burning the iso to a dvdrom and when the screen comes up saying ""insert reason 4 dvd""    i insert the cd, and it never gets past that screen.    If anyone can help me out hear i will be stoked to the max. "

,Fujirich,2010-10-06T20:11Z,"There is NO .iso image to mount to a virtual drive. All the people here saying it's the easiest thing in the world to do muct be using something else. There is NO...NO .iso file in this download.

There are 3 application files (Autorun, Install Reason and Keygen), 1 setup information file, 1 configuration settings file, 1 rich text document file and an icon file.

There is NO .iso file!!!

So...how to install this when the setup asks for the Reason 4 DVD?"
,Seygantte,2010-10-08T23:21Z,"I have no idea what you are talking about Fujirich. It clearly states at the top of this page, Files: 2, so where this 3 executables stuff has come from I don't know. Although I myself have not downloaded this, I did load it into my utorrent and bam, I see 2 files:

KEYGEN.exe
Propellerhead Reason 4.iso

So yeah... obviously mount the iso with the virtual drive software of your choice and follow any instructions presented."

Im having this same problem. No-one is able to help? DL'ed file, burned the ISO onto a disk, then mounted the .iso file, ran the setup, installed ok, then asked me to insert disk. It doesn't work... Ok so any help would obviously be appreciated, I don't see why some torrents are so easy and others are made such hard work..."
,peggysue27,2011-03-02T10:52Z,"Works well for me. Got XP. Why does some of you have a problem? Just mount the Iso. The torrent only contains a keygen and an isofile. Nothing more.

Thanx!"
