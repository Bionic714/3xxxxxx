This is a subtle remix of the song \"Cindy\" by Tammany Hall NYC.  

This mix is off the version of the song that was a free download from Amazon.com a year ago.

The song has not been substantially altered in this remix but augmented with background  strings and woodwinds about halfway through.  The intro has also be changed.

Tammany Hall NYC is a band somewhat akin to The Shins.  \"Cindy\" has been used in one or two movies and an episode of Scrubs.

I remixed the song simply because I like it and felt it lacked some filler.
