Dopatzu... This is a well known problem. I think I've found a solution to it though. 

Turn your speaker ON. If they are OFF, you will not hear any sound...

I turned my speakers on, and sound came out of them. I was very shocked.
It seems that they also need to have power (electricity) for the sound to work."
