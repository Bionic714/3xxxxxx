,gibson4ever,2010-05-25T14:53Z,"i don't get it, this doesn't work for me, after i extract the files, do i just drag the whole folder to the ISO folder, or do i get the files individually and drag everything to the ISO, please reply!"
,digiwebguy,2010-08-17T11:50Z,"@gibson4ever:
this torrent works perfectly!
to play it first you need to extract the iso image file  and copy it to the iso file in the root of your psp. but in order for it to work on your psp, you need to have custom firmware on your psp. "
