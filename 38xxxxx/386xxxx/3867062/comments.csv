,greylion,2007-11-12T18:37Z,"This is a bad rip; aspect ratio is 4:3, the original aspect is 1.85:1, which means 27.3 % (total) of the movie is missing from both sides of every frame.
This is immediately obvious in the 20th century fox intro, and later on as people are halfway out of the picture/frame.
A waste of time to download."
,sal10851,2007-12-08T10:11Z,"Ive reviewed the copy of this rip and I fail to see any flaws. The aspect ratio of the Dvd is 4:3 and I kept the same attribute with the rip. You will find that when the rip differs from its original file, there is lack of quality due to its compressabilty. Its better to keep the same aspect ratio to avoid these problems. If I recieve anymore negative feedback I will gladly make another copy.

On a personal opinion I give it 9/10 Video and 8/10 Audio. Thanks for downloading!!"
,bwmcmaste,2008-01-29T10:23Z,"I don't know what greylion is going on about, but this torrent is just fine. No viruses and the aspect ratio is perfect.

Good movie, and good condition."
,brian_kevlar,2008-02-04T19:25Z,worx fine. One of the funniest movies evr ;)
,k-a,2008-03-02T22:49Z,"Excellent movie, really good quality too!! Thanks for the UL!"
,zettabyte,2008-04-13T21:18Z,greylion - I've had that happen before on other movies from using incorrect settings when burning them. I was able to fix it by changing some settings on my dvd player.
,seeinsideout,2008-05-15T15:30Z,gee thanks i look forward to watching this
,sumdumnam,2008-06-24T14:55Z,"it is very definitely a fullscreen picture; even the reported resolution (624x464) is about 1.33:1 (aka 4:3).  (try it with your calculator and see.)

oddly enough, another version of this (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4238512/Office_Space) claims to be widescreen (and is, by resolution), but compared to this, that widescreen is the one that's cropped.  (you can tell -- the width of the shots is the same, and the widescreen version doesn't show as much on  the top or bottom of the picture.)

so where's the real widescreen version?

btw, to the ripper, it does seem to be a good quality rip.  i don't think anyone's accusing you of changing the video in any way; more likely you ripped from a fullscreen DVD (knowingly or not).  

nice work, and thanks for sharing."
,Licurgo,2008-07-11T15:53Z,"i love this ratio becuz fit perfectly on my plasma tv and my laptop,the quality is very good and there is no lost picture of the sides,becuz the movie was converted to fit on a tv,thanks"
,danuker,2008-08-04T22:07Z,I don't care about the aspect ratio. Thanks.
,nokurwajegomac,2009-01-31T13:24Z,"Good quality rip.
Geylion just probably tried to watch it on his TV and it screwed something."
,Goldernie,2009-04-03T09:06Z,"I would liek to know why does it say ""mp3"" on the title?"
,Noppersz,2009-04-23T19:05Z,"should've read the comments first... i dont feel like downloading another version, though. ugh..."
,sir.g,2009-04-26T00:30Z,Great film.
,sir.g,2009-04-26T00:37Z,"By the way, it's a perfect rip. So, don't be a bunch of whiny pussy's."
,ph00x,2009-06-04T19:07Z,"For the physical size of the video, the quality is excellent. I'm watching it on my 24"" high def and it looks *perfectly watchable*. Thanks!

Keep in mind, guys, if you burn this to a DVD and try to watch it on a 42""+ TV, of course it'll look bad: the video is only 600 pixels wide..."
,Romis2,2009-07-02T13:13Z,"The aspect ratio was not a problem. I tried it on my 42'' Samsung Plasma TV. And I had no problems, no cropping at any point.

The film was pretty good, short, but good. Great download speed as well. Seeding to a 3.0 ratio."
