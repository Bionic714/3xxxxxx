Ah, the dulcet tones of the Butthole Surfers, such an eloquent reminder of hazy days long gone by - Of Endless summers filled with Pink Panthers, Black Microdots, Sulphate, Evo & Merrydown. By George, those were the days..."

,oldman2007,2007-11-21T15:15Z,"Thanks for this great Compilation. I listen in the 80th in Berlin every week to Johns Music. I made some tapes this time, but the quality after 20 years is crasy. So I looked now for digital copies - but this - this is a lot of. One question. You write at some of the festive fiftys shows: Radioversion. Means this that you compiled the other shows from records. I love to get some background-infos about making the records.
Thanks again   "

Gorgeous stuff this is. I am looking forward to compilations DA - Z. Living in Germany means suffering from very bad radio program (all target group oriented for the 14-25yo). Blessed be John Peel!  "

,unholm,2008-04-13T20:30Z,"Hey Mr PIRATE MIKE !!!
Everything's said already- I find no more words to express my THANKS for this work you've done to hold up the Memory of one of the MOST IMPORTANT MEN in the whole Music-Business of the last 40 years, Mr. JOHN PEEL, whom we sadly miss.
I'd like to get a glimpse of the shows, he's now performing with all the great musicians with him in heavenly dimensions...
Best wishes from Germany, so long
Hans-Helmut"
