And thanks again. This indeed is the real thing.
However you were able to upload it before the release date, nice work. :)"
,ghog,2007-10-28T21:32Z,Thank you sir!  Who needs oink anyway.  Let's see if this is purchase-worthy.
,ghost1988,2007-10-29T01:18Z,Definitely worth the money. 
,420_Maynard_TooL_420,2007-10-29T09:02Z,Nice...days before the release.  Thanks guy I needed this shit.  Maynard is the shit!
,420_Maynard_TooL_420,2007-10-29T09:06Z,Cool the download speed is stayin at 150 kbps.  I thought I was gonna have to wait since it has such a high bitrate but its downloading so fast.  Thanks again!
,k19jackyl,2007-10-31T12:37Z,Doesn't seem to be ripped from a retail copy. Sounds like it was recorded from the MySpace page. Constant hiss in the background from the lousy recording device. Waste of 320kbps
