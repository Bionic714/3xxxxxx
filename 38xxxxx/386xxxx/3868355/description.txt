"You found my weakness... I prefer to shoot a moving  
target" - Del Tarrant                                    
Star One is the second remix project to reach                
maturation on Faxi Island Records, after Second In      
Command in early 2007.                                  
We present you with ten delicious remixes of Faxi's        
original minimaltech/psy tune Star One. On this one      
We have got some returning names on Faxi Island -      
LSDan, Fright Rate and Elmooht - and a bunch of new      
names to our label.                                      
We believe this album is truley a journey, with each    
remix taking you to a different destination into each    
of the artist's minds. From DJ Hoax's pumping UK          
techno vibes, through the bouncy trippy take by              
Skyhighatrist, and the deep and dark version by          
Noized - each remix is a new world of sound and        
color.                                                    
The project for the original tune was posted online,          
and artists could download the project and work there    
own remix.                                              
We hope you enjoy this album!                              
Note:                                                  
We really love this album and recommend it to        
everyone who really loves Psytrance & good          
music. Every dime is a good investment!

We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying.
MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands !!
You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout.
