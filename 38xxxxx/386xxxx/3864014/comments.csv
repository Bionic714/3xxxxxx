,JoshM22,2008-01-18T01:44Z,I am having trouble playing this in Windows Media Player. Do i need to download a codec?
,gabaoo,2008-01-20T11:53Z,"I run it in Windows media player 11 with no problems. Try to reinstall WMP or try to find another version.
Also you can always run it in another player, like radlight, blue crystal, bsplayer, etc...
If you need codecs download them here
