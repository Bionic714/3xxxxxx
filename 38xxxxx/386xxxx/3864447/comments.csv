,Sharkeyking,2007-11-12T16:38Z,Does it work?
,Sharkeyking,2007-11-13T12:50Z,It works! But what is the controller?
,Turtle9,2007-11-14T02:51Z,"You have to set up the controls VIA the Emulator that comes with it. Look for it in the folder directory that you installed SH into.
How do the graphics look for you? They look like crap for me...guess I shouldn't expect much since it's not a port. :/"
,Turtle9,2007-11-18T09:36Z,Wow this is actually a PAL version and NOT the US version. So if you want to find cheats for this it is VERY hard to find and most sites are in different languages that have cheats.
,JottePD,2007-12-17T12:22Z,Thank god! It's really working? 
,looking54,2007-12-30T09:00Z,"Thanks , great game , found the katana in the levin st house with this version , had a little trouble figuring how to turn on the special effects but found that if use the FVP Emulated option is the best choice , auto detect frame rate on mine graphics card makes the game run very fast and the sound a bit choppy , used the limit frame rate at 80fps and turned the sound buffer size to 245 , seems to work well now with only a slight increase in speed when fighting the lizard . textures are a bit lously but that because they are 16bit , loved the ufo ending very funny . thanks for keeping this game alive , a true gem ."
