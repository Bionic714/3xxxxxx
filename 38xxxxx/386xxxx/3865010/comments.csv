,keithp123,2008-03-30T01:00Z,how do i open a rar file?
,_]osh42O,2008-04-09T06:01Z,"Dude.  Please explain the thought process of packing this all into a RAR file.  It helps nothing.  It does not decrease the file size very much at all.  Not worth the time to compress, and not worth the time to extract.  All it does is FORCE ME TO DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE FUCKING TORRENT.  I want one song.  Now I have to download and seed the whole thing.  THINK!"
