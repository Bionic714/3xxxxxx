After Elizabeth, Will, and Captain Barbossa rescue Captain
Jack Sparrow from the the land of the dead, they must face
their foes, Davy Jones and Lord Cutler Beckett. Beckett,
now with control of Jones' heart, forms a dark alliance with
him in order to rule the seas and wipe out the last of the
Pirates. Now, Jack, Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma,
and crew must call the Pirate Lords from the four corners
of the globe, including the infamous Sao Feng, to gathering.
The Pirate Lords want to release the goddess Calypso, Davy
Jones's damned lover, from the trap they sent her to out of
fear, in which the Pirate Lords must combine the 9 pieces that
bound her by ritual to undo it and release her in hopes that
she will help them fight. With this, all pirates will stand
together and will make their final stand for freedom against
Beckett, Jones, Norrington, the Flying Dutchman, and the
entire East India Trading Company.

Since there seamed to be something wrong with every single release
so far, I decided to make my own rip from the DVD9 source.
Enjoy it :)
