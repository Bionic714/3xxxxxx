,spikethedog,2007-11-05T21:05Z,fake
,TokiWartooth,2007-11-10T07:30Z,"you people all claiming this ""not to be an r5 and clearly a tc"" should perhaps first be more clear on what an r5 actually is.
it's essentially a studio sanctioned TC made for release in region 5 (imagine that!) which is of course russia.  they are released early (generally while the film is still in theaters) to help discourage piracy in the region, beating the bootleggers to the punch if you will.  therefore, the r5 is a non digitally retouched, direct copy from the reel of film, generally synced with english line audio, giving the feel of a dvd, without image processing.  think of this now when choosing to download an r5 release and then bitching about the not quite dvd quality."
