,titestef,2007-11-22T01:20Z,"DOWNLOADED ! 
No Menu.
Anamorphic Widescreen (1.77:1).
French : Original Mono (Dolby Digital 1.0)
Custom yellow english subs (a little bit late)

The quality : perfectly clear original mono, good picture quality, but the dvd has been compressed from the original. There are some artefacts and pixellization in a few scenes, but not very annoying, because it's in black and white."
