you did NOT test it on N95, like cheap Japanese watch you lie.

for the record this WILL work on 6630, 6680, N70, N71 - i have personally unlocked over 200 phones with it."

"
,Nitroito,2008-12-31T04:24Z,"AMAZING!!!

how people write without knowing what is writing!!

FIRST: if any nokia phone connects to a PC using a DKU-2, DKU-5, etc... i mean that the connector is likewise the DKU-5, it all supports the DKU-5 cable...

the reason why is used the DKU-5 cable is the pin position that leads to access the memory addresses to CRACK it, simple!

about other brands, FORGET, never will happen

LAST: not sure, but regardless the model it will UNLOCK all that runs Synbian OS S60 3rd Editions, locked by BB5 ""mode"" and OF COURSE a plug interface that applies to DKU-5 USB Cable!


;) heim!"
