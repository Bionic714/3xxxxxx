The movie shows a supposed process of designing, production and testing of a condoms in Japan. Filmed much like an advertisement, if features frequent interviews with a plant owner and detailed depictions of a penis cast moldings, oral and vaginal intercourses and overall fright when condoms get ruptured sometimes :). The story is set in hospital-like environment, where everybody wears protective masks, gloves, and gowns and behaves like unprejudiced and austere scientists rather than persons being fucked. Enjoy!
