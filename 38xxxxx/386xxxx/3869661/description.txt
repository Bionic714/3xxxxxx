DosFlash and DosFlash32 V1.3 Beta
-----------------------------------
- BenQ optimization in unlocking the flash chip, it should now be possible to read/write/erase
  the flash without any soldering or wire tricks, the drive is polled for the correct mtk
  unlocking status after power on, this only works for VIA cards and NForce boards atm
- DosFlash32 has one additional parameter, if you start it with the parameter "EnableDrives"
  all the DVD-ROMs are enabled in device manager after flashing, this could give BSOD on some
  systems, therefor you need to create a DosFlash32 link and add that parameter manual to use it
- DosFlash16 has one additional parameter "Send ATAPI Device Reset" in manual mode, this could
  give better chances for soft flashing on some VIA - motherboard combinations
- better support of Intel chipsets, drives can now be flashed if the controller is not set to
  native mode in the BIOS
- the following controller list includes vendor and device IDs that are hardcoded to identify
  the controller type (IDE or SATA), this is needed if the BIOS uses IDE ports like 0x01F0 or
  0x0170 as SATA and not as IDE channels, this list is NOT related to soft flashing
- the following chipset support is added
  - VIA cards
    - all VIA cards with a 6420 chipset
  - IDE Controllers
    - NVIDIA nForce 2 IDE Controller
