nForce is going downhill. Such sites need to be updated several times per day, not once or twice per week at the whim of some lazy schmuck."

,budskee420,2007-10-31T19:32Z,"how do i open these files? i am very experienced at troubleshooting my own problems with downloads, but i am at a complete loss as to what i need to open these files, that dont appear to be even real files. i use daemon tools, and like i said and experienced and am in no way a noob, and cannot figure out what needs to be done in order to get this game installed. UNTIL SOMEONE CAN ANSWER ME BACK WITH THE SOLUTION, I WANT TO PUT THIS DOWNLOAD ON NOTICE!!!! it   MAY be a fake, because i know what i am doing and cannot figure out these flt-pkod files. daemon cant do anything with them, and daemon has so far been able to open and execute every game ive ever downloaded which would be about in the high 20's to low 30's. so i am familiar with torrent game downloads, and hope that my problem is it requires some sort of special program im unaware of as of now. AND BTW, ive searched all over trying to find this Securom7 to no avail."
,Afarensis,2007-10-31T21:21Z,"It works fine, but its a really crappy game. Not at all as good as the original Painkiller. "
,SirDEA,2007-11-01T09:51Z,Jaaa!!!!! Painkiller!!! 
,carnal_82,2007-11-01T15:24Z,hey..i dont see the first rar-file
,egvas,2007-11-01T23:48Z,"For all peoples, it is REAL game, and it is NOT FAKE, because someone is so stupid and don't know how to extract the file it doesn't means it is fake, you need to have installed winrar, then right click on any file, then go open with and chose winrar, then just drag and drop file anywhere you want and it will automatically extract iso file!!!

,Azazel_NYDM,2007-11-02T05:07Z,Hell ya! i will be super seeding this baby! and budskee if you think that deamon tools is king shit of crap mountain and you are familiar with torrent downloading you say? but you could not figure out to open and extract with WINRAR? then your not only a NoOb but one sorry ass liar to boot!

,whosniffedme,2007-12-12T03:00Z,"I have this thing properly installed, now how do i crack it? please go into detail."
,AleksanderLarsson,2007-12-12T15:43Z,"When I run it in deamon tools it says "" You need to install Windows XP Service Pack 2 before installing Painkiller Overdose "" . What the fuck ? You can't have to do that ?! Or ? Plz , help ! "

,smreka,2008-02-12T19:31Z,"Never mind..... I downloaded a crack from 
www.cracks.am

,smreka,2008-02-12T19:41Z,"''whosniffedme'' this is how you do:
1.Open up this 
C:\Program Files\DreamCatcher\Painkiller Overdose\Bin

2.Copy the crack(i downloaded it from cracks.am) to the folder.

3.Click on the overdose.exe icon.

4.Now you can create a shortcut to it, just right click on the overdose.exe icon and choose create shortcut.

5.Enjoy the game."
,raybo58,2008-04-15T13:59Z,"DO NOT download this. Yeah, it works, but there's a very nasty virus embeded in the installer and in the main game. I had to re-install Windows twice before I discovered the source was this game. Damn you Fairlight."
,Nitr0xx,2008-04-24T03:22Z,Where is the freakin' crack?
