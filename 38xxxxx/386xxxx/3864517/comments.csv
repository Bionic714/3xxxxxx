,FadeToBlack,2007-10-30T07:42Z,"Thanks!
Now maybe you can enjoy this game:)"
,FadeToBlack,2007-10-30T18:09Z,"It seems like it doesn't work 100% 
I saved the game and when i started the game later it didn't load from where i saved. It starts from a couple of weeks/months earlier thn i saved the last time.
How does it work for you??"
,kaZmur,2007-10-30T18:24Z,"Actually, I experienced the same problem. I solved it by saving the game with a different name everytime and not overwriting it. "
,FadeToBlack,2007-10-30T18:41Z,"kaZmur: ok, im gonna do that than and see if it works. thanks for the tips!"
,enterthenamehere,2007-10-31T00:04Z,"Even the saving with diferent name doesn't work for me, the savegame just doesn't get created.. And it looks like that when this problem occurs, I can't anymore save the game.."
,enterthenamehere,2007-10-31T00:11Z,"What version do you have, when you look at the main menu( right down )? Mine says that I have version 1.1"
,enterthenamehere,2007-10-31T00:36Z,"I'he done some research, and I found that I can't save game, when I buy any item from the promotion section at the shop.
I have only 10,000$ so I can try only items that I can buy( can anybody try the more expensive items? ) but bass guitar, mic, drum, and misc that I bought doesn't do any problem when saving game.. only the promotion items..
So don't use promotion items, and have a luck when saving.."
,kaZmur,2007-10-31T02:26Z,"You're right abot the part that the patch doesn't fix the problem. Your theory about promotions is interesting. I hope it works 'cause the guys at game mill obviously have some problems fixing the problem. I also encountered another problem today... all of a sudden my finances say I have ""$nan"" and all of my gigs have capacity 0. Anyone seen that before?"
,kaZmur,2007-11-01T16:15Z,"@enterthenamehere: 
Still working without promotions?"
,Andreij,2007-11-02T23:25Z,"Is the savefunction fixed? 
@kaZmur: I have also had the ""$nan"" problem, but that was before the patch.

Kudos for writing emails to GameMill so we could get this patch!"
,kaZmur,2007-11-03T09:41Z,"It seems enterthenamehere is right... just avoid buying promotions from the store and it will save fine. I saved my game once for every 500 fans and I played for about 10 hours without any problems. So, yes, the patch works if you don't buy any promos."
,NemkeDude,2007-12-16T19:30Z,"As i read on the net, save works even without patch, if you don't buy promo's.
For what is patch then - i don't know, maybe some other bugs fixed.
Anyway, thanks for the upload...

Seed on..."
