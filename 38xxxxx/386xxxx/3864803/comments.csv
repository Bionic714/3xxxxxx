,BlakIdPea87,2007-10-30T07:43Z,does this have the final patch?  if not do you have it and can you put it up for download?
,DjAlCubilas,2007-10-30T19:27Z,"Could not find the patch installer. I have the patched GCSWE folder from my original installation; I can host that but I don't think it will do any good... Found a few contacts that still have original copies of GCS3.08, waiting for a reply from them on a patch installer... In the meantime, SEED IF YOU CAN! I will keep this updated with my findings. Thanks to all the GCS fans out there!"
