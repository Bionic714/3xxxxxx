	During his eight long journeys through India?s huge subcontinent
	MIND OVER MATTER?s mastermind Klaus Hoffmann-Hoock was able to
	collect a lot of deep impressions and he brought with him unusual
	sounds from different parts of the country that inspired him to
	interweave them in profound songs of mystic quietness: music
	reflecting the various Indian landscapes, their different people
	and religions, from the Himalaya mountains? mighty rivers, to the
	holy sites and saints at the river Ganges, through Rajasthan?s
	hot desert cities, over seemingly never-ending dusty roads to the
	ocean.
	For sure an authentic Indian meditation of a different kind.
