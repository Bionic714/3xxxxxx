This is Rush's "Snakes & Arrows" album in 5.1 6 Channel Surround Sound audio.

Use the appropriate software to decompress the files back to their original WAV form once the download has finished. I would advise against converting these files to a format other than back to their original WAV format, otherwise you will lose the 6 channels, and be reduced down to 2, unless you have special software that even I am unaware of.
