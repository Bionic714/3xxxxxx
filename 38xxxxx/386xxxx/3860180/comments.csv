This is the stuff of dreams.

I'll find out for sure in a week when the download is finished."
,Teqno Haxor,2007-11-07T15:48Z,"By the way, Foobar2000 should play these as is in 6 channel sound.

WavPack is another lossless format that works with multichannel, and if you need lossy, Vorbis supports multichannel as well, for your information."
,Teqno Haxor,2007-11-07T18:21Z,"Wait, you transcoded from AC3?  AC3 is already a lossy codec.  Transcoding to lossless is just wasting space."
,UltimoGuitarist,2008-04-09T05:21Z,It was in AC3 to begin with.
,Rollinassinfire,2008-04-18T15:06Z,"AC3 is lossy, but FLAC from AC3 is better then mp3 from CD :)"
