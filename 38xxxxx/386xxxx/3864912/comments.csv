This is after trying to mount an image and install from that ... and after burning image to DVD and trying to install from a DVD drive on the target computor ... always getting stuck with ""insert Adobe InDesign CS3""

,phaze424,2008-09-17T21:44Z,"HOW TO FIX THE SPLASH SCREEN

Apparently, some activist dumbass thinks we shouldn't test on animals. Fuck him. Here's how to fix the splash. This assumes you've already installed InDesign correctly.

1) Open Resource Hacker. If you don't have it, Google it. It's free and a great app.

2) Open InDesign.exe in Resource Hacker (usually in C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe InDesign CS3)

3) Navigate to 578 -> 294 -> 1033. Notice the string ""PNG"" in this data. This is the current splash screen.

4) Go to http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?9zo18owmnw2 and download it. This is the real splash screen.

4) Click Action -> Replace Other Resource...

5) Open the new splash screen you downloaded as the replacement. Enter 578 for Type, 294 for Name, and 1033 for Language. Click Replace.

6) Make sure ALL instances of InDesign are closed, and save the file. Resource Hacker will make a bakcup copy in the ""InDesign CS3"" folder called ""InDesign_original.exe""

7) Close Resource Hacker. You now have a fully functional InDesign CS3 WITHOUT the shitty splash screen."

I am supposed to copy the public.dll file and overwirte the old one. So I open Power ISO, copy the .dll file, go to my hardrive and paste it into the Indesign folder I created, thus replacing the old one. 

So why does it still not work? It still brings me to the pass key screen.

,from_portugal,2012-05-19T01:21Z,"read this carefully, i even created i god damn account just to leave you here with the RIGHT instructions, i was wandering for an answer just like some of you, so here it is the solution on how to solve the fucking cd missing issue:

get the adobe installer cleaner here - http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cscleanertool.html

download it, extract it, open it, follow the instructions (if you're not sure what to do, pray to god, jk, you basically have to remove the indesign shit you already tried to install)

now, after removing the adobe indesign crap, extract this .iso, copy the folder to C:folder (example: C:Adobe InDesign CS3)

if you've done it right, removed and then copied to the destination i mentioned, you should be able to install with no more fucking annoying irritating problems,

well the point is, you have to remove what you already tried to install, i assume you already tried to install a bunch of times right? so, basically, shit got piled up, and the solution is to clean up the indesign installation database and then re-install."
