Sign up for the Closed Beta 

The World of Kung Fu Closed Beta begins on November 1st, 2007.

 
http://www.WorldOfKungFu.com/

We will be inviting new testers every week until the closed beta ends and the open beta begins. If you are selected to participate, you will be contacted via email with further instructions and a link to download the game client.

The Member Login is currently disabled until after the start of the Closed Beta, so if you sign up, it does not grant you access to an account. Accounts will be activated ONLY for those players chosen to participate.

The Forum will also be activated for the Beta, and it will remain a closed testing forum until the Open Beta is released.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing you in the World of Kung Fu!
