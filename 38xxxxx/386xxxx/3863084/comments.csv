,marcuzi,2008-03-24T19:43Z,"Anyone have info on the quality of this vid? Am DL it now but could use some feedback, thanks"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-27T19:01Z,"A note about the quality:
Video 7/10
Audio is OK
When you inflate the compressed sub file, it bows out into 126 MB, from which you can take your pick. The video file is only about 675 MB.
I downloaded this, it is good, but I guess if you only want a few of the subtitles you'd download an SRT anyway. (Available at opensubtitles, youll have to resync it a bit).
22 subtitles! Wow! It must be a record of sorts.
Thanks for the share."
