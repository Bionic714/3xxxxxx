,Al6e55x321,2007-11-07T01:30Z,"Paramount, who owns the copyright to this film, had their lawyers send a threatening letter to my internet service provider to try and make them give them my identity... probably not to send me flowers either. Word to the wise.

By the way, when you guys rip off your own writers, and try to put people in jail for having a torrent open-- how much sympathy do you actually expect to elicit from the public?

Everybody-- boycott Paramount. Their movies suck anyway."
