,andythecurefan,2007-11-07T11:29Z,Should Star of Bethlehem be 2:08? The radio edit was 4:19 and the Main version over 8 min.
,andythecurefan,2007-11-07T11:33Z,"Star Of Bethlehem is a song by American alternative rock band Angels & Airwaves. The track was the longest song created by Angels & Airwaves, at over 8 minutes long. There is a 4 minute version, however, that appeared on the Kevin & Bean's Super Christmas C.D. It also appears on a recent commercial advertising Utah travel and skiing.

The song will be on the band's new album I-Empire, however, it has been cut into two songs; Star of Bethlehem(now instrumental), and True Love(kicking in at the 2:09 mark)."

,biller88,2007-11-27T06:33Z,I'm glad they put out another album...I was worried it would be like Boxcar Racer.
