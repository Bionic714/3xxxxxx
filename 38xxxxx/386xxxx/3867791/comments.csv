,pnutster,2007-11-08T05:24Z,"Hi,

An often heard question. How do I use this without a (Dual Layered) DVD burner? Or even without burning it at all. Many words are needed to describe this and is not the mosts convenient. Try the video-tutorial that was created here: http://homepage.mac.com/pnut/tutorials/installing_leopard_without_dvd.html

Good luck!"
,DsprtMeasurz,2007-11-08T17:32Z,"I am at 33%  I will let you guys know how it goes as I already waisted 2 DL Disks on another leopard dwnld.  Fingers crossed this will work!

,alterdeb,2007-11-09T18:48Z,"thanks pnutster for that video tutorial.
if we had more seeders it would rock; i'm d/l @ 5K/s max."
,aznpantha,2007-11-11T23:33Z,"this worked on an ibook 14"" 1.33gHz.  I burned the image with Disk Utility using a Dual Layer DVD +R disk and it worked fine.  SEED MOTHAFUKAS! that's what i'm doing.  FUCK the rich!"
,DsprtMeasurz,2007-11-12T00:14Z,"ok quick question?? I got the download.  Do I not need to make the DL disk bootable? or will just pressing the [C] key work.  I dont feel like waisting yet another DL Disk.  Thanks in advance to all who seed.  I will continue to seed once installed.  

-DsprtMeasurz"
,aznpantha,2007-11-13T11:16Z,"just make sure to burn the image with Disk Utility.  Then it should be bootable automatically.

When ur Mac starts up just hold the ""C"" key and it should boot from the CD.  Ya better seed mofo!"
,Jadocs,2007-11-19T18:18Z,"Common people...seed this please....I'm trying to download right now.

common people help me out here.  I'm almost at 1%.  I think Apple will have come out with 10.6 by the time this gets done."
,sexynedis,2007-12-07T20:29Z,"Merci anger98.
c'est un vrai torrent qui marche trĂ¨s bien. TestĂŠ avec update 10.5.1."
,richto,2007-12-25T20:03Z,"grrrrr Macs suck so much. 

downloaded this to find its some bullshit non standard .dmg file that nothing can burn.

Where is the scene release ISO?

Eventually found that UltraISO will convert it to an ISO image. 

Now I try and boot a Macbook with no OS on from it, and it shows the apple sign for a while, and then just comes up with a 'no entry' type sign and sits there for ever!

How do I then get this junk to do something? 

I just want to upgrade this Macbook to Vista and wiped it before finding out that Apples BIOS is so non standard you cant install Windows directly and need to set it up via 'BootCamp' first"
,Hoosier66,2008-02-15T20:37Z,"@ richto. If you see a .dmg as a non standard file, that means you are probably on a windows computer and yes, .dmg dont work on windows computers. This is a mac file, so you wont be able to open it easily, without converting the file. 

Now for my problem. 

I dowloaded this file and installed it fine. I had some little issues but after trying a couple of times it worked.

And so far it works fine execpt for some small issues.

1. After i have put my macbook pro in sleep mode for a while, and open it up again to use it. the mouse is kind of laggy. If i scroll across the dock, the icons enlarge kind of laggy also. A restart fixes the problem, but i dont want to do that everytime or else i wouldnt put it in sleep mode. Does any one know how to fix this>

2. Today, for the first time, but it happened twice today, if i put it in sleep mode, and open it up again. the screen remains black and only after 3 mins. the screen comes back and i can use the computer. It has never happened to me that it takes 3 mins for a mac to come out of sleep mode. I read somewhere on a forum that someone else had this problem also. How can i fix this?

Thanks for the help guys!"
,gabo68,2008-07-08T15:14Z,"Thanks anger98, I have  proven it of the 2 forms, having burned it in dvd and recovering the image in a partition of the hard disk, in both cases works perfect, thanks again."
,infamous78903,2008-07-08T18:43Z,"PPPLLLLLZZZ SEED!!!
