I know the general manager of the Western Maryland, and I had the good luck of getting a ride in the cab of #734, stoked the fire, and sat in the engineers seat, and blow that great sounding whistle. If you get the chance, get out to Cumberland Maryland, and take a ride on it. you can have lunch in Frostburg, while the engine turns around. Enjoy! More to come
