[color=Red]SYPNOSIS:[/color]Peter Parker finally achieved a balance between his devotion to Mary Jane and their duties as a superhero. But a storm threat on the horizon. The career of Mary Jane is in crisis, in the newspaper there is a new photographer who threatened to take the post, now superpoderoso Harry Osborn claims revenge for the death of his father, and a new villain appears in the city: Flint Marko, offenders who has mutated into a being composed of sand, and appears to be the true murderer of Ben Parker. As if that were not enough, a strange body in a fallen meteorite is permeating in its suit, giving it more power but also dangerously changing their behavior. Now Peter must not only fight against the enemies of peace, but against himself.
