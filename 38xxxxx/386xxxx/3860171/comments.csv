,Rif,2007-10-27T09:21Z,Is this the US version?  I think the only ones I have been able to find (second version only) are UK-based. :(

,staffs_flyer,2007-12-15T13:48Z,What is the volume label of the original disk? This keeps asking for original disk to be inserted.
,Sanicle,2007-12-19T02:23Z,"Okay, this is what worked for me

1. Install the game, and remember where you install it to. Choose ""full install"" (non full install may work too, I have not tested it)
2. Download the fixed exe from this page. http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?f=WWTBAM_2nd_Edition!zip
3. Go to where you installed the game and replace game.exe with the one included in the zip file. You can safely ignore FILE_ID.DIZ and Crack.nfo
4. On my system I had to reboot at this point. Trying to launch the game without doing so resulted in a crash to desktop with a scary looking 3D error message.
5. Once rebooted try running the game again, it should run fine. Please note the disc still needs to be inserted, or the image mounted. Even with full install, certain media is streamed from it. All the fixed exe does is remove the authenticity check. Trying to run without the disc results in an immediate crash to desktop with no error message.

I hope this has helped anyone who wants to play this game :)"
,Sanicle,2007-12-19T02:31Z,"sorry, it appears a direct link to the page will not work, so here's a slightly less direct way of getting to the fixed exe.

1. go to http://www.gamecopyworld.com/
2. type ""millionaire"" in the text field and hit the search button.
3. Click the (at time of posting) second link - ""GameCopyWorld - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire / Wer wird Millionaer / Qui Veut Gagner des Millions - No-CD No-DVD Trainers & Game Fixes""
4. Click the first link marked as english on the page. This will jump down to the file. Click the little floppy disc icon
5. Use any of the mirrors, all of them should be the same.

PS - yes, I know a lot of the links you have to follow will open in new windows. but at least it's better than a plague of pop ups."

,NKD4488,2008-08-06T12:01Z,"Everything is all right till the Game has been Installed + Cracked. But when I entered into the questions, the screen kept slashing, flickering and the question hid, I could not see it. What should I do  now? Thanks!"
,sunnydee4219,2008-11-28T22:11Z,"Hi, 

Thanks for the torrent, am afraid though am a real newb and need some further advice... would appreciate any advice you could offer!

I followed the instructions right up to ""reboot"", then when windows loaded up again, I used a microsoft program called ""Virtual CD Rom"", to mount the program on to a virtual drive (named z: ) When I tried to run the game, it said insert disk and continue. 

I then tried going to the desktop shortcut (of the game) ""properties"" and where the target was set to c: I changed it to same path on the virtual (z:) drive. This produced an error message of ""please insert the correct CD Rom, press Ok and continue"".

Am completely baffled, do you have any ideas?

Many Thanks,

Dee"
