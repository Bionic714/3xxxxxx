CD1 is not working. You can open CD ( but you will not be able to add language Level1 (CD1) It could be a problem with file SK-ESP-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.7.1.0.r29 in Language folder. I couldn't open it.

Plus all CDs needs to be activated.(activation is not removed yet. You are able to use only 2 lessons out of CD and then it forces you to activate the program. 

Anyone can bit that?CD1 is not working. You can open CD ( but you will not be able to add language Level1 (CD1) It could be a problem with file SK-ESP-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.7.1.0.r29 in Language folder. I couldn't open it.

Install the app by burning or mounting the ISO, then follow the crack instructions.

Once that's all done, unmount/remove the install CD, mount/put in the burned spanish CD and start up the rosetta stone application. "
,onare1,2008-04-18T17:34Z,"is there a way for mac users to crack it or use activation codes or is there another work around? the crack already available uses a .dll file work around, and .dlls only exist on PCs.
Thanks"
,LindB377,2008-04-21T11:20Z,"@ onare1

As of right now, I do not think there is any crack for activation for Mac users, but people are asking esarhaddon if he knows of any. Check out his page.
