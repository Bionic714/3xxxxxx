Tomas Milian stars as a half-breed bandit double-crossed and left for dead who rises from the grave to seek his revenge in a bizarre town called "The Unhappy Place" where he's plunged into an odyssey of gruesome torture, graphic violence and sexual depravity. This is the landmark movie that fans and critics still consider to be the strangest-and most controversial- 'Spaghetti Western' ever made. This is Django Kill!
