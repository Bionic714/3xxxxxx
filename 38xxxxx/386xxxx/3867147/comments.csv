I cloned my hard drive prior to running the installer, then simply cloned my old XP partition to the new (C:) partition created by the installer."
,Slayer1040,2008-02-10T06:10Z,WilBuR3724 your a god. just started downloading this. been looking everywhere for this. iv got a dell but gay dell wont let you download it from them and since my warenty is up they wont send me new instal disks... gay fagots. thanks for the great upload... even if it doesnt work after you get points just for pretty much being the only one to upload the media direct cd iso.
