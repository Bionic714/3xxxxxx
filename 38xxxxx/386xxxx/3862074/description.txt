Michael Palin explores the countries that were for much of his life hidden behind the Iron Curtain but now are part of the new Europe. From Lake Orhid in Macedonia, Palin treks up to the Rila Mountains in Bulgaria where he joins the summer solstice celebrations of the mystical White Brotherhood sect. Crossing into Turkey he admires the great mosques of master architect Sinan in Edirne, the first capital of the Ottoman Empire, before witnessing an oil wrestling competition.
