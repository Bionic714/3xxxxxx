The Backstreet Boys are an American pop group. The group has received several Grammy Award nominations, charted 12 U.S Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, 16 UK Top 10 hits, and sold over 100 million albums worldwide, making them the highest selling pop group of all-time. Since returning to the music scene in 2005, their sound changed drastically, incorporating only live instruments (some of which they play themselves) and a rock edge. The current four-member group consists of Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, and A.J. McLean. The original member Kevin Richardson left the group on June 23, 2006.
