Monkey Business (Dir. Norman Z. McLeod, 1931): The madcap Marx Brothers stowaway on a luxury cruise ship in this fast-paced, laugh-filled farce. While they manage to elude capture by the ship's captain and crew by staging impromptu puppet shows and hiding in herring barrels, getting off the boat is another matter. Before long they're all impersonating Maurice Chevalier in order to disembark and begin their new careers as mob bodyguards. Horse Feathers (Dir. Norman Z. McLeod, 1932): Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff (Groucho Marx) is the new President of Huxley College. In order to stay in charge he must somehow get the college football team to win their annual Thanksgiving game against arch-rivals Darwin - a bit of a tall order, since Huxley haven't won a match since 1888! Needless to say, playing it by the rules is the last thing on Wagstaff's mind... Duck Soup (Dir. Leo McCarey, 1933): A pointed political satire, Duck Soup is the Marx Brothers' funniest and most insane film! Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, the hilarious dictator of mythical Freedonia. Harpo and Chico are commisioned as spies by Groucho's political rival, the calculating Trentino. The film contains many of the brothers' famous sequences: the lemonade stand, the Paul Revere parody, the "We're Going To War" number (a beautiful spoof of 30's musicals), the hilarious mirror scene and a final battle episode that has been copied by everyone including Woody Allen!
