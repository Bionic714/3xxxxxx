It's a bloody patch. A Bloody 40 meg patch, and it's in tens of rar archives. WHY?! IS THIS STILL 1991 OR WHAT?!"
,111bob111,2007-11-02T15:24Z,Blackwing Dragon has spoken
,bzsoltee,2007-11-03T15:01Z,"Have everyone GF 7600GT? I have the latest driver, but not working...."
,111bob111,2007-11-03T16:59Z,screw it. this fix didn't help me much either. The game won't start. Where is reloaded when you need them
,dpdpdpdpdp600,2007-11-03T23:17Z,Can someone help me out?  Is this supposed to be opened with Winrar?  It says it's an Unknown Application so I dunno if I'm missing something..  And the instructions on this site (no readme) are a bit vague.  Is Timeshift itself (im still dl'ing it..) packed in these Unknown applications???????????????  thanks.
,dionisus,2007-11-04T21:57Z,"@dpdpdpdpdp600 :
jsut RIGHT click flt-tscf.001 and choose Open with WINRAR ..sigh..

Even better.. Assosiate WINRAR with all RAR archives.(RAR,001. etc)"
,dpdpdpdpdp600,2007-11-05T01:23Z,"Thanks, usually winrar recognizes these things but I guess this time it didn't."
,besike,2007-11-05T04:05Z,"

the ting about million of rar is there for 2 reason. First for people with slow connection and second for people with fat32. 

****

Since when did FAT32 not accept files above 40Mb?? and chopping it in to pieces at that size, ppl still on dialup?"
,blastfire17,2007-11-07T00:47Z,freezes at loading screen!!
,blastfire17,2007-11-08T12:38Z,what a waste...will only stick to reloaded. piece of crap.

,smli,2007-11-15T17:31Z,hey when i try to enter the game it just loads for 10 sek or so and then does nothing.. can anyone help me please ? :)
,ShadoWFurY120,2007-11-25T22:16Z,"Most of the ""TimeShift"" ISO's dosent work.
Well it works, but i get the problem where it loads the Shaders, then it get stuck, but the game is running, but i can only see the loading screen, it happens sometimes, but sometimes too many times...
Only way i guess is buying the game..."
