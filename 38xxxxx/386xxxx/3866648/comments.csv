,mjstriker5,2008-04-29T00:00Z,Dragon's lair works great. Cliff hager does some weird stuff after you die but plays fine. I an't get space ace to work. After the point where you are running through the halls with the lights beaming down on you the game starts repeating scenes. you have no control and you eventually lose all your lives. Any help would be great
