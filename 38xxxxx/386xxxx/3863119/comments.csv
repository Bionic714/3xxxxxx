thanks"

,Husky42,2007-12-27T11:12Z,"BE AWARE:

What 4X-AXG does is like Fairlight stealing something from Razor or Deviance.

This would not happen within groups, it is about competition. All 4X-AXG has managed to do was alienate himself as a non team player and thief.

This would not have been accepted years ago. A child to the game 4X-AXG will continue to steal. But be aware, he has never released a file that was not released elsewhere first.

He has never purchased and sold, or donated to help a cause. He is the lowest of the lowest when it comes to file sharers and in no way deserves any form of respect. He does not even know how to give appropriate credit.

4X-AXG you are nothing more then a pathetic fucking thief."

,jim1105,2008-08-22T16:05Z,"Thank you soooooo much it works its so simple.  for anyone who is curious here is step by step instructions.

1.  open the folder with the installer and start it(installer)
2.  stop after you select your language and click ok.
3.  follow these steps to use the crack, click my computer, Local disk c,  documents and settings, seslect your account and double click on it, now look for local settings and double click on it, open the folder called temp, and scroll all the way down there sould be two folders with funky name like a series of numbers an letters they should be side by side at the bottom. open the second one it sould have one folder inside of it open that one and you sould see the moduel you need to replace so replace it and continue the instilation no serial needed have fun i hope i helped"
