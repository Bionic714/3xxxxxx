This is the album that introduced Baaba Maal's singular mix of traditional African rhythms and Western arrangements to the world. His third recording, Lam Toro bounds ahead of his previous two albums (which explored his folk roots), transforming Senegalese music with funky grooves and electrified melodies. ~ Rosalind Cummings-Yeates, All Music Guide
