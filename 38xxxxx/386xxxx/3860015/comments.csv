,BlueFox88,2007-12-07T08:03Z,"With toast, and the .dmg file, how do you get the game to work without a NOCD crack?"
,MrFingers,2007-12-17T21:09Z,"Thanks for this upload, a classic for sure.

This is very buggy however on my computer, leopard/macbook.  It mucks up the dock too after I close it, but restarting the computer seems to fix it."
,badgerblitz,2008-01-05T21:07Z,"BlueFox88, sorry I haven't checked this torrent for a while now, but what I do (I don't even use toast, just the disk utility) I right-click the .DMG file, and scroll down the menu until I reach ""Mount It"". Select ""Mount It"" and a CD image should appear on your desktop (the one you need to play!). Open the CD image, and either copy the game to your Applications folder, or play it straight from the ""CD"". Either way, you should be able to play with the .DMG mounted without a NOCD crack, because the computer thinks the CD is in. Hope this helps, I'm not very technical, but it's fairly simple. Good luck to you!"

,ashleyliz,2009-01-06T07:23Z,i'm running osx 10.5.2 on an intel mac and have graphics problems as well...
,EdwardLow,2009-02-28T15:02Z,"Thanks!

The game works great on my Mac mini Intel GMA 950 running Leopard 10.5.6, although the Dock is corrupted after playing. To fix this, just type 'killall Dock' in Terminal afterwards.

To play without the diskimage you can find a NoCD in this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4055968/_No_CDs

(There is a tiny diskimage in that torrent, which you can mount instead of the original game diskimage, so it's not a true NoCD patch)"
,retry4z,2010-08-08T11:43Z,"playing it on 10.5.8 
needs a graphics fix. All I see is an ""x-ray vision"" of the game."
