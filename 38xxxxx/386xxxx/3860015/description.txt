Risk II for OS X, version 1.0.2. I run it on a PPC G5 OS X 10.4.10, runs great, but I don't know if it will run on Intel. Sorry I don't have a NOCD crack; I kept the .DMG file so I can mount the disk image (with disk utility, toast,) when I want to play. If you find a crack, make a torrent for it.

Anyway, used to love this game, was glad to find it for OS X and not classic, I'm sure some of you will enjoy as well. Cheers!
