INUI 4 is the fourth volume in Makoto's series of occasional
solo releases for VHF. While widely and rightly known for
ear-splitting Deep Purple style guitar demolition with Acid
Mothers Temple, Gong, etc, Kawabata's INUI works are highly
personal and introspective, with lots of room given to cosmic
atmosphere and acoustic instruments. INUI 4 is a single 68
minute track, a slow building and evolving multi-layered swath
of acoustic & electric guitars, electronics, and hurdy gurdy.
The final 20 minutes of the track features prominent
glissando guitar, ala Daevid Allen, a very fine sound to be
lost in. Like the other INUI volumes, this includes great pix
and design by Makoto and Kawabata Sachiko.
