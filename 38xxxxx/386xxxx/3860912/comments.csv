Here is the requested info:

7zX is a file archiver with high compression ratio. Compression ratio results are very dependent upon the data used for the tests.

Usually 7zX compresses to 7z format 30-70% better than to zip format, and 2-10% better than most of other zip compatible programs.

7zX currently supports tar, zip, gzip, bzip2, UNIX compress, 7z, s7z and various kinds of segmented archives.
