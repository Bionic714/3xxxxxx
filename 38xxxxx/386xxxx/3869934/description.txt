Info/Comments:
Before getting a request for this album, I had never heard of the artist, let alone the album.  However, a few quick Google searches turned up all I needed to find it.  This is not my rip, I just obtained it from a non-torrent source and uploaded it by request.  The ID3 tags indicate that the ripping/encoding credit goes to JUICE, and I must say, it seems to me that he did an excellent job with this vinyl.  

Despite not having heard this before, I must say, I am enjoying this album.  I hope you enjoy it as well.
