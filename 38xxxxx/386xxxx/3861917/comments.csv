,Denis227,2007-11-03T19:47Z,"This upload is pure shit ... When I install it, it says sum file is missing I mean msi crap"
,vampyre404,2007-11-10T19:30Z,"1. Mount image with daemontool
2. Creat a folder on your HDD and rename it to ""ZT2EXD1"" and then copy the entire cd content to this folder.
3. After end of copy go to the folder and rename the file named ""Zoo_Tycoon_2_-_Extinct_Animals"" to ""Zoo Tycoon 2 - Extinct Animals""
4. Then install the game from Autorun.exe.Do not install the game from Setup.exe otherwise it will show an error message.
5. Burn the Content of the folder as data CD [As CD label name ""ZT2EXD1""]
6. Play and Enjoy ;) """
,fiercepoptart,2007-11-17T21:16Z,When i try to install i get an error that says Failed to get setupENU.dll language code.  I already ran the fix hoping this would help.  Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks.
,Chione,2007-11-22T22:16Z,"There is no file named ""Zoo_Tycoon_2_-_Extinct_Animals"""
,Chione,2007-11-22T23:36Z,"God I feel stupid -.-;;

TO anyone else that's 'slow' like me, here's what you do:

1. Mount .cue with daemontools
2. Go to 'My Computer' and right click on the expansion pack.
3. Select 'Open'
4. Copy everything in there and put it in a new file in your C:Drive
5. Rename the msi file named ""Zoo_Tycoon_2_-_Extinct_Animals"" to ""Zoo Tycoon 2 - Extinct Animals""
6. Install from the 'Auto Run' file.
7. Enjoy =p"
,elle856,2008-01-03T16:50Z,"followed all the instructions.. but when i try to install through autorun, it just goes straight to this message 'zoo tycoon 2 is not installed. please install zoo tycoon 2, and then install the game.'"
,OmegaRed1190,2008-01-29T18:54Z,"just change the   PackageName  field in the 'Setup' config settings file from 
""Zoo Tycoon 2 - Extinct Animals.msi"" 
to
""Zoo_Tycoon_2_-_Extinct_Animals.msi"""
,bigrouge,2008-02-23T22:25Z,"It is easier to DL this fix and apply it to the bin file:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3848516/Zoo.Tycoon.2.Extinct.Animals.Fix-RELOADED

1. DL the fix
2. Unzip the fix files to desktop.
3. launch ""ppf-o-matic3.exe""
4. for the iso file field, locate ""rld-z2ea.bin""
5. for the patch field, locate ""rld-zeaf.ppf"" that you dl'd with the fix
6. Click on apply
7. mount the rld-z2ea.bin with Daemon tools.

thats it your done."

1. Open the autorun configuration file in notepad
2. Change 'icon=zt2ex.ico' to 'icon=autorun.exe'

And save it and run autorun.exe. and done! This worked for me"
,Assault591,2011-07-21T02:04Z,"Got it to install here is what I did

Mounted it like normal then created a folder on the desktop and copied all the files that were mounted into the folder then you need to rename
'Zoo_Tycoon_2_-_Extinct_Animals.msi'
to
'Zoo Tycoon 2 - Extinct Animals.msi'

Works like a fucking charm thank you will seed"

,Juggalett420,2012-08-11T10:34Z,"ok FINALLY figured out how to get this freakin thing to work! its actually a very good torrent just a few things u gotta do first so here is how i did it and it worked!

STEP 1: us winrar to unrar the torrent. if you dont know how google how to unrar file.

STEP 2: after torrent is unrared, mount (i used daemon tools. when auto run pops up DO NOT AUTORUN!

STEP 3:while in daemon tools double click on the mounted image, it should open it file location, copy ALL files. (after double clicking image you should see files such as crack,setup,autorun etc.)

STEP 4:go to your desktop right click select NEW and paste everything into the NEW folder.

STEP 5: go into the new folder you created and open the setup file that looks like a piece of paper with a gear on it (do not open the regular setup) it should open up in notepad.

STEP 6:on the setup notepad go down to where it says PackageName=Zoo Tycoon_2_-_Extinct_Animals.msi and change to PackageName=Zoo_Tycoon_2_-_Extinct_Animals.msi and save.

STEP 7: open the new folder you created on the desktop and right click on the autorun then select open. Follow the installation process. 

STEP 8:after install is done go into new folder copy the crack, go to my computer>program files>microsoft games>zoo tycoon2 once there paste the crack. copy and replace when asked.
Once youve pasted the crack close out of program files and open the new folder on desktop right click on autorun and select open. (make sure zt2 extinct animals i still mounted) and it should let you play it

sorry if this is a little out drawn but i made it simple for people who dont know how to do all this shit! HOPE IT HELPS!"
,Juggalett420,2012-08-11T10:53Z,ok y bad but to be able to play the game after you do all the steps i provided go to mycomputer>program files>microsoft games>zoo tycoon 2 then scroll down till you see a image that has the name ZT and you should be able to double click it or right click and open it. it may say your color scheme has changed and the visuals arnt compatible just ignore and continue. and youll b play zt2 extinct animals hope thats better :)
,Lkitten,2012-08-14T02:17Z,"whenever i click autorun nothing happens, did exactly what jugalett said too"
,Lamalas1,2012-08-16T19:10Z,every time i go to install i get an error message. i have followed all the steps and even renamed the things that needed to be renamed.  the error message says: 1628: Failed to Complete Installation.  how the hell can i fix this? thanks in advance
