,Guilmon0714,2008-01-27T04:39Z,"I need help, I'm having a strange problem and I don't really know how to fix it. The audio in all the vids sound like higher pitched than normal. Like it's definitely noticable and I'm not watching them like this. It sounds dumb. Did anybody else have this problem? Is there any way I can repair it? :/"
,Dragondice,2008-06-22T11:19Z,"Judging by ppl saying its good quality and sound i download this one sience i cant wait anymore.. Been waiting for 10 episodes to air and then waited for them on good quality. Hope these are.. since im planning seeing them all on my tv and not on the computer =)
