,Gustav24,2007-11-01T11:12Z,"I have a request for the album ""Sunny side up"" by Wilbert Longmire from 1979. Thank you again for your three Claudja Barry albums!!"

Is that the album you're looking for?"
,Gustav24,2007-11-01T22:04Z,Yes that's right! Is it possible for you to get it? I would be forever grateful :)
,jeffmr,2007-11-01T23:02Z,"In the process of getting it now.  I'll upload it when I have it, assuming my other torrents are well seeded.  For some reason, they're all showing 0 seeders/leechers here, despite what my client (and isoHunt) is showing. "
,Gustav24,2007-11-01T23:08Z,"That can't be right.. There must be several seeders, i downloaded it in a couple of minutes, and it said 0 seeders/leechers.... Thanks for getting Wilbert Longmire, looking forward to it and your upcoming torrents, I assume that you are a discolover like me :)"
,Olympia,2007-11-03T20:28Z,"If someone could assist in seeding the wonderful Claudja Barry albums, please HELP!"
,jeffmr,2007-11-03T22:21Z,"Despite what the stats on this page say, I *AM* seeding this and my other torrents.  "
