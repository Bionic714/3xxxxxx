,jethawk,2008-02-06T15:36Z,It says it's for mac and it says it's for windows and mac... Which is it? Win & Mac or only Mac?
,Newb787,2008-02-23T01:57Z,MAC only.  1.31 is the newest version. No linky for it. :(

,Mingie,2008-05-27T13:04Z,RAR file again not supported by mac?
,Mingie,2008-05-27T13:06Z,CANNOT OPEN RAR FILE USING 10.5.2 :(
,CrankyBird,2008-06-09T02:33Z,"Hi,

So how is this different and/or better than iTunes or Toast?

Thanks"
,SpokeyDokey,2008-07-03T03:23Z,"For anyone having trouble opening the RAR file, download TheUnarchiver and set it as the default app for everything.

Crankybird - iTunes is a media player, and Toast is for creating CDs/DVDs. Switch converts audio files to a different format (for example, you could convert a bunch of M4A files to MP3 so you can embed the album artwork in their ID3 tags)."
,s___amson,2008-07-15T12:15Z,Crack doesnt work for me on 10.5.4 (yes i have installed it properly)
,jackstrong,2008-08-31T08:34Z,"The file in the CRANK folder is a document whereas the file in the MacOS is an exec.  I can replace it as noted, but because it is not an exec file, nothing happens.  Any ideas?"
,elwer3,2009-01-24T09:45Z,"This sucks you are right everyone for who the crack dont works. The original file in the MacOS 
folder is a PowerPC executable file. There is no chance to run it on new macs. Find some other programs. if someone finds something let me know  down in the comments

,Redpain,2009-01-28T15:29Z,"For Macusers : 
Open the dmg file, copy the package to the desk top. Control+Click on it and choose ""show package contents""
A new window appears with a folder called ""contents"", open this folder.
Now one of your choices is a folder called ""Resources"", open this folder.
Now you see Switch Plus 1.13.sizes file
Rename the crackfile ""switch"" to Switch Plus 1.13.sizes. Drag the file from the resources folder  to replace it.

It worked for me. cheers"

You say not to ask hor to use the crack and if we can't figure it out then buy it................THAT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF SHARING THE FUCKING FILE AS A TORRENT!!!! THIS DOESN'T WORK!! I need to convert WMA to FLAC or m4a, I don't like mp3. Fuck you!"
