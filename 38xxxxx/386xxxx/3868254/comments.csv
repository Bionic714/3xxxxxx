,animeadict06,2007-11-16T18:17Z,The problem I have is when I first start the game I get the message File[bgm_01.ogg] could not be opened. I click ok and the menu comes up.

It did it to me too at first. But I kept clicking the messages for a while and then I tried using the arrow keys to select instead of the mouse and it stopped complaining. 

Just keep trying and it'll start working. ...or at least it should. ^_^v"

I stopped the game, deleted a bunch of stuff I didn't use on that computer anymore [including divX] and downloaded the newest version of directX from microsoft. I then restarted my computer and it worked fine all the way through.  I'm not sure what fixed the problem but I would guess it was the directX, although I have had issues before with codecs affecting how certain programs run. >.> By that was ffdshow.  Anyways.

,Meowzer00,2008-03-21T16:37Z,"This is how you fix the game. Go into the Setup.txt and remove the DISCNO=1 and DISCNO=2.

,lovebells,2008-04-23T09:45Z,".: FOR MISSING OGG VOICE FILES :.

This problem is very simple. The VOICE.arc file IS included in the torrent's folder, but the installer DOESN'T put it in Zettai's C:\Program Files folder.

SOLUTION: COPY your VOICE.arc from the folder Zettai downloaded in, and PASTE it in your C:\Program Files\langmaor\Absolute Obedience folder (drive letter may vary).

This should fix it! Enjoy! :)"

,harlequingirl47,2010-05-12T00:23Z,"So, my brother gave me instructions to download this and I did and all the other stuff he told me that would help SO I did, after it was finished downloading, he told me to follow the following instructions: 

1.) Right click and open containing folder
2.)Find the Setup TEXT document
3.) Delete that
4.) Take the file I'm giving you in this email and download it
5.) Put that file in the folder with the other files, where you just deleted the one that was wrong
6.) Go to setup, the actual application setup, and setup the game

You should be able to do it just fine.  Also, after you install it, go to program files, langmaor, and open the absolute obedience folder.  Check to make sure that Voice.arc, Se.arc, and BGM.arc are all in there.  If they're not, go back to the folder with the setup stuff, and copy and paste them from there.  It SHOULD work.  If not, I'll figure out how to fix it.

AND THAT'S IT! He sent me the fixed file and junk but I am not very computer wise so when I open containing folder after it finished downloading I had like 9 things in it and none of them were labeled SETUP.txt that were a notepad thingy so I was very confused.

The names of all the files and stuff are:
dht.dat.old - and bellow it says OLD file and it is 4kb
resume.dat.old - and below it says OLD file and is 3kb 
rss.dat.old - and below it says OLD file and is 1kb
dht - and below it says text document and is 4kb
resume - and below it says text document and is 3kb
rss - and below it says text document and is 1kb
utorrent.lng - and below it says LNG file and is 677kb 
absolute obedience (pcgame) - and below it says winRAR archive and is 48kb 
Absolute Obedience - Zettai Fukuju Meirei (english yaoi game) and below it says TORRENT file and is 47.4kb
settings.dat.old and below it says OLD file and is 4kb

,LaciBug,2011-05-21T06:12Z,I did what kyuuketsukiyume said to do but still nothing :( It keeps saying to insert a disc!
,kyuuketsukiyume,2011-05-27T15:27Z,"It's been a long time since I stumbled across this torrent...
@LaciBug

If you haven't fixed your problem yet and happen to come back here and read this comment perhaps your problem could be any of these things:

- May require a program called Daemon Tools to play if it says you need the disk
although i doubt it because i never needed it, unless the files changed since i downloaded it years ago ( its generally games like Togainu no Chi that need programs like this)

otherwise you may be able to change the setup file if its still included in the download like what was basically mentioned in harlequingirl147's comment which says whether or not it will look for a disk,amongst other problems that may be involved, but becareful changing these files as doing something wrong will only cause more problems, its best to save a copy of the original before changing anything.

and although not really related to the problem and doubtly a solution to it but as other people have mentioned make sure the following files are in your game folder:
Voice.arc
Se.arc
BGM.arc

Not having these files will also cause the game to not work.

I will download the file again when i have time to see if there are any further problems."
,kyuuketsukiyume,2011-05-27T15:36Z,"@ Posterboy_mr
If you haven't already solved your problem and happen to comeback to this torrent...

Your problem seems to be that you haven't set your unicode to japanese which allows games like this to work properly, although this is in english and this solution is generally for games which are in japanese so i may be wrong here i'm not too sure if it'll solve this but perhaps try it and see. If you don't know how to, it goes as follows:

Control Panel--> Clock, Language and Region --> Region and Language --> Administrative --> the click on Change system locale
and change it to japanese (Japan)
depending on your OS (operating sytem) this may be slightly different for you though

It seems many people are having issues with this torrent though due to the amount of problems it has, hopefully it's been fixed though"
