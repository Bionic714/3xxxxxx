Joint Stereo shares certain bits between high frequency left and right channels. This improves compression efficiency at a slight loss of stereo separation.

Stereo includes two independent channels. The total bit rate remains constant, but the split between the channels can vary. The Encoder uses this flexibility to improve quality by allocating more bits to the channel with the more dynamic signal. Use the Stereo setting for best quality stereo audio at higher bit rates.

Dual Stereo includes two completely independent channels (left/right)"
