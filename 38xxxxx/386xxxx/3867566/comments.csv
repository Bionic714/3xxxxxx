,macpirate2008,2008-05-17T04:26Z,What the fuck is up with you goddam windows geeks?  It's like your going out of your way to find the most obscure way to compress files.  Can one of you fucked up nerds explain IN ENGLISH how to decompress this file in Vista on a Mac for a lousy no-good idiot stupid-ass Mac user like me?  I've burned up a dozen DVD-R's trying to burn this goddam thing to a disk.  What the fuck it up?
,0crysis,2008-07-27T22:07Z,"This works fine to you noobs out there

1.) Open with WinRAR
- Vista. Press at file it will say ""CHOOSE FROM LIST"" Browse find winRAR at program files.

2.) I always choose the file sying (1) At end
so exctract it to deskop...

3.) Open with deamon, Download here from piratebay from HANSROAR, I downloaded from him just search,

4. When you open file with deamon open first FILES and exctract the Crack and serials to descop.

5 Run the instalation. 

You know the rest ;)"
