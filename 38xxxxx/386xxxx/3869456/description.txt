AnyDVD HD comes with same functionality as AnyDVD, but with additional features for full
HD-DVD (High Definition DVD) and Blu-Ray support, including decryption of
HD-DVD & Blu-Ray movie discs.
Allows you to watch movies over a digital display connection, without HDCP compliant
graphics card and HDCP compliant display. No need to buy an expensive monitor. Sweet!
Playback your discs on your PC with PowerDVD Ultra, which otherwise do
not run (titles released by Studio Canal, The Weinstein Company, Kinowelt,
Optimum Releasing).
AnyDVD HD is the "must have" utility for the serious home theater enthusiast using
a media center / home theater PC.
Another amazing feature of AnyDVD HD is "magic file replacement". Remaster any
commercial movie disc using simple XML scripts. These scripts will "magically" replace
the files on the physical disc. You can customize discs as you like without even
making a copy to harddisk!
