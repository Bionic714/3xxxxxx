I bought the series on DVD many years ago, but I'm doing the road warrior thing and I wanted to watch this episode in particular -- it was the first I ever saw -- and were it not for your efforts I would be bereft.

And yes, it has aged gracefully; and yes, it it still is the best way to be introduced to science. It had an incalculable effect on me.

Thanks again. :D"
