I mourn the loss of oink.cd by uploading everything I got from there that is not on TPB yet :)    Please do the same if you were a member.

From wikipedia:

What We Did on Our Holidays is the title of the second album release by the band Fairport Convention. This album included the vocals of Sandy Denny unlike their previous (and first) album, Fairport Convention. This album contains some very memorably early Fairport tunes. Sandy Denny\'s vocals are moving, especially their take on \"She Moves Through the Fair\". When Richard Thompson was asked to sign this CD in the early 90\'s at a show in Detroit, MI, he responded \"Oh, I forgot about this album, and I had no idea it was released on CD. Mind if I take a look at it?\"
