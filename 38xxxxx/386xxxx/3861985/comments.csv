,boagdon,2007-12-18T18:00Z,"IT DOESN'T WORK!
If I try to run the original VT3.exe - it tells me to insert the right CD. If I replace it with the VT3.exe crack, it gives me an error and doesn't start. The only thing that works is the VT3 configuration. Any idea how to make it work anyone?
Thanks"
,GoVaHraM,2008-02-16T22:33Z,"Here is it, the new virtua tennis 3. the game is really nice and is also made to ps3

you can also watch VIRTUA tennis 3 on youtube and see if you like the game :)

you need a good computer to be honest :) but FOLLOW my instructions and it might work if it say something about Pixel Shader then its because you computer is old and suxs but it CAN and i said CAN work :) 

STEP 1: mount the game ( use Daemon-tools, POWERISO etc....)

step 2: install the game

step 3: goto ""My computer"", right click on the V3 icon press open and find the crack :) but the crack in c/program files/sega..... (COPY/PASTE)

play the darn game! 



NOTE: if it doesnt work try this,

4. Download patch + crack from gamecopyworld.com
5. You UnZip the patch into your game direction (C:/Program Files/Sega/Virtua Tennis 3)
6. You unpack the crack into your game direction (you will be asked to replace the allready excisting VT3.exe, you click ""YES""
7. If you start the game now (by clicking the VT3.exe) there will be an error, saying that some .dll file is missing
8. You look for the missing file on dll-files.com (mine was d3dx9_32.dll)
9. You download this file (the file is a .rar file)
10. You unpack the file into your game direction
11. Start the VT3.exe now and enjoy playing

OR TRY THIS if you computer is cocky or sucks it will MAYBE WORK


download 3d analyzer(GRAPHIC CARD EMULATOR) from google :)

and do this 

open 3d analyzer
PRESS SELECT FIND THE GAME File(exe)
open 3d analyze,and tick only the following(remember to put the patch and the latest crack)
force sw tnl
force high precision pixel shaders
emulate hwtnl caps
emulate max sim textures.

OR Try checking only 'skip pixel shader 2.0' and 'emulate pixel shader caps'; the other options are unnecessary i guess.
If this doesn't work you need a new graphic card "

,Lm17,2008-06-08T21:34Z,"Help Anyone?: I've done everything, unrared, patched, added crack from the site, but when I click to start, the hourglass comes up for a second, it seems to be loading, then everything stops and it goes back to normal. No errors, just doesn't load. Help?"
,al-smith,2008-07-05T22:43Z,"Same error than lm17, it flashes and then it goes back to normal (with gcw fixed exe #2). Help us please !"
,seaotters,2008-07-07T17:44Z,"I'm having the same error, the hourglass appears for a second then vanishes again. There is no VT3 process running anywhere, it just stops working instantly. Everything is patched correctly.

Did anyone manage to get another torrent of this working instead of this one?"
,benne...,2008-07-13T15:11Z,"om ni vill så kan ni lada er den saknade filen på 
dll-files.com sök på d3dx9_32.dll ladda ner den filen. unrar filen som laddades ner och kopiera in d3dx9_32.dll filen i spel mappen.
hoppas de funkar

you can download the missing file from dll-files.com search for d3dx9_32.dll and download, unrar and past the d3dx9_32.dll file in your game folder.
I hope it works"
,distill,2008-07-20T19:55Z,"Works pretty good for me. I got the ""slow motion"" problem a few times, what helped was a simple reboot. The ""slow motion"" problem exists already on the initial logo fades so it was quick to tell.

But I have this horrendous high pitch buzz/noise problem. Anyone else have that? Any workarounds? So there is a constant and irritating ""eeeee"" sound and music/sfx volume settings have no effect on it. When I quit the game the noise is gone."
