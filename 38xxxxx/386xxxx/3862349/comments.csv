,newmy51,2008-09-29T02:24Z,one year aniversary.  no fix for the music problem...
,Kasperjl,2008-09-29T14:25Z,"Please help me with the ""insert cd""."
,Dreamspel,2008-10-27T00:29Z,"That game, can read as rayman-cd any music cd, and uses the sound data  from that into the game. That can help in both your problems. Just burn a music cd with the rayman sound tracks. You will not have the ""incert cd"" thing and you'll have music too."
