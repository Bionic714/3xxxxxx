The old Rayman game released from Ubisoft in 1995. As this is an old DOS-based game it does not work on XP. Now it does.

The setup file in this ISO has been replaced with a patch. This patch is based on the open-source project DOSbox. (http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/)

Installation:
  o Mount or burn the file RAYMAN.ISO
  o Press "Install" in the autorun menu, and follow the steps.
  o Once done installing, you can start the game from the start menu.

If youre experiencing any problems while playing, try and have a look at the README.HTM on the cd (or just press "Readme" in the autorun).

This is tested and should work fine on Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista
