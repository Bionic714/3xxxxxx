,Matri,2007-10-29T06:14Z,"espritnine, this is homeworld 1. your link goes to a patch for homeworld 2"
,coejack,2007-10-29T07:30Z,wow this has become a relly rare game now a days thanks for the upload
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-10-29T11:20Z,"You're welcome.  I tend to specialize in rare stuff, I guess hehehehe

Don't forget to play it online! hehehehe"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-11-25T13:00Z,Mr_E.Nigma: Make sure that the (virtual) CD-ROM is in the (virtual) drive when playing the game.
,3Dk,2007-12-01T05:21Z,"Ummm forgive me but I just DLd this and im getting a msg when i try to install that it wont open the ""yes"" folder?? Also where do i get the ""virtual"" disk"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-12-05T02:45Z,"The .ISO file in this torrent is the virtual CD-ROM.

If you're getting an error, try doing a hash check via your bittorrent client to make sure that the d/led files aren't corrupt."
,thojoh370,2007-12-13T22:36Z,"Eh, Homeworld is not connecting to WON when I want it to. Have they stopped supporting HW1?"
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2007-12-15T22:15Z,"I don't think so (at least I hope that's not the case).  Won seems to do down for a few days every once in while and then comes back up again, and then repeats the ""cycle"".  I dunno why this happens.

Whatever the case may be, there are other M-P options.  Look into it at Relic's Homeworld Forums for the info.

,Dynamitrios,2008-01-16T13:34Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this. 
This game is one of the most innovative RTS and has to be distributed to all strategy game lovers out there.

You rock mr. WinstonSmith6079"
,UnholyJudgment,2008-02-14T05:53Z,"When I try to install it says ""homeworld\YES\\index.html could not be found

what can I do?"
,PhoenixG,2008-02-21T20:45Z,"i have the same problem, when installing it says ""error: can not open the ""YES"" folder"" or something like that anyways.

If anyone can help i'd appreciate it. I have installed games previously using daemon tools and never come across this problem?!"
,CombatMuffin,2008-02-22T06:30Z,"Avast AV found a trojan in the .iso file.
Win32:Nimosw-B.

No wonder he wants you to play it online."
[T],WinstonSmith6079,2008-02-23T04:57Z,"Bullshit, Muffy.  There's no virus here.  Why are you the first to report this, eh?  I think Muffy's a little jealous.

Don't compete with me--I'm here to share files, not to be ""1337"" or some retarded kiddie shit.

No one else reported this previous to Muffy.  There's no virus here.  And I want people to play online because the Homeworld community needs players.

It's still seeding, Muffy.  What do you think of that?  :)"
,echerz2,2008-02-25T19:36Z,"This works just fine. Just installed. It NEEDS the included patch to be installed and you MUST mount the iso or burn the image onto a CD otherwise it will NOT work.

Excellent download. Seeding."
,kaneli2000,2008-03-20T08:17Z,"SEED!!!! I had this game when i was about 6-8 years old and i lost it. I want it back, but with 10 kb/s its a litttttttttttttttttle slow..."
,kaneli2000,2008-03-20T08:19Z,EDIT to my last: its 1.5 kb/s...
,djdeth,2008-04-03T00:52Z,"I downloaded and burnt the iso only to a cd with PowerISO at 10x. Then got a serial number from one of the many online sources. It installs and works perfectly! I chose not to use the key generator, that way there is no possibility of a conflict with other software (like punkbuster). It recognizes the disc in the drive like it should. I visited the online community, and yes they are trying to get new players interested and involved. Thank you WinstonSmith6079 for a great upload. Once I get good at the game you may hear from me. Cheers!"

,Tempest42,2008-08-21T17:12Z,"ESET Smart Security Scan Results:
No malicious programs detected

This upload has 0 viruses/trojans and is completely safe to use.

I did come across a problem trying to use the autorun installation and it failed with a file corrupted error. This can be fixed by using the HWSetup.exe found on the ISO.

Great upload WinstonSmith6079, and people are still downloading a year after the upload!"

,ethos3para,2008-09-28T15:08Z,winston ive done this with bout 5 different torrents n all have failed cna u give me the correct way to do it with urs plz any help would be great
,hwaddict,2008-11-24T16:23Z,"No Trojans and no virus!

For installation is needed (just google):
1. a key or a key generator (included)
2. the latest patch (included but also available at http://ftp.sierra.com/sierra/homeworld)
3. a NoCD version of the ?exe? (not needed in this specific case)
4. a virtual CD driver software like ?DAEMON Tools?
5. a trainer and a strategy guide could help

See the HW Cataclysm example at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4269466/Homeworld_collection , and do the same for HW1 and HW2.

See also the other comments with help.

Play and have fun!"
