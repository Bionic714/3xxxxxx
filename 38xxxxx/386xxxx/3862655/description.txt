OpenOffice.org 2.3.0 (great free alternative for Microsoft\'s office) 

OpenOffice.org 2 is the leading open-source office software suite for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics, databases and more. It is available in many languages and works on all common computers.

It can be downloaded and used completely free of charge for any purpose. 



*Writer (alternative for microsofts \"Word\") 

For all your documents 
WRITER has everything you would expect from a modern, fully equipped word processor or desktop publisher. 



*Impress (alternative for microsofts \"Powerpoint\")
 
More power to your presentations 
IMPRESS is a truly outstanding tool for creating effective multimedia presentations. Your presentations will stand out with 2D and 3D clip art, special effects, animation, and high-impact drawing tools. 


*Math 

Create equations and formulae for your documents 
MATH is OpenOffice.org\'s component for mathematical equations. It is most commonly used as an equation editor for text documents, but it can also be used with other types of documents or stand-alone. When used inside WRITER, the equation is treated as an object inside the text document. Similarly, one can also insert these into other OpenOffice.org programs like CALC and IMPRESS. 


*Draw 

The powerful graphics package 
DRAW - from a quick sketch to a complex plan, DRAW gives you the tools to communicate with graphics and diagrams.

New to Version 2, BASE enables you to manipulate database data seamlessly within OpenOffice.org. Create and modify tables, forms, queries, and reports, either using your own database or BASEÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s own built-in HSQL database engine. BASE offers a choice of using Wizards, Design Views, or SQL Views for beginners, intermediate, and advanced users.

Yes i KNOW this is a free download @ www.Openoffice.org 

But show you support this free OpenOffice version by downloading and seeding it. 
Would love to see the seeds on this get higer then the overpriced M$ Office. 

Just added the piratebay\'s tracker to the orignal OpenOffice trackers, so there will be more seeders then show up on thePiratebay.

I did this to make people aware there are good alternatives for the well known MS version of office and thepiratebay will be one of the places to find out about new software.

ThX in advance 
Peace all
