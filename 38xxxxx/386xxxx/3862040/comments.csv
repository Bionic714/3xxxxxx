,Dj_Drizu,2007-12-22T23:12Z,no working keygen
,eovnu87435ds,2008-01-17T00:49Z,"@Dj_Drizu
It does work, keygen and all! I am using it on a palm Zire 72 and it works. Just be sure to load all files mentioned in the !readme.txt. once you do that, load both files in the keygen folder. On your palm, open up the program that's not the remote(tm_noviiremote) and put in any name. even tho it says worng it dosent matter just click register, and it will say registered under your name. thats all there is to it!"
,eovnu87435ds,2008-01-17T00:58Z,"Well, as with my last comment, it works, but there is no pre-loaded code bases. I am about to try and see if i can get the codes from novii.com by DLing the demo and only installing the codebase"
,Eiht,2008-01-18T03:14Z,No need.  If you go to Novii's site they have a pack of 500 codes that you can dl.
,superhero7,2009-07-25T18:43Z,I am so stoked for this download. Does anybody know if you can program your garage door opener into also?  That would be simply sublime.  Also I need you guys to seed this thing ASAP.  It would be hugely appreciated and I will seed forever once I have it.  Thx again
,RBG3,2010-07-30T05:01Z,"superhero7: Are you kidding?  No. (It's a safe bet: Your garage remote uses radio signals.  Your TV remote uses IR signals.)

Worked great for me.  Accidentally imported the wrong resolution files; deleted and reinstalled without a hitch.    You can load everything at the same time; keygen registration worked for me."
