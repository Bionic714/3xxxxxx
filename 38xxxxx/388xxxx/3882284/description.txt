North America > United States > Pennsylvania > Pittsburgh > Carrick. Even if you ain't from Pittsburgh, you'll still like this music. Sounds like Hip-Hop/Rap. This is real shit from the heart (shit you can vibe with).These are just two of their albums, they made three. This torrent contains their 2000 and 2002 albums. The 1998 album is what's missing. This group does not have a name, nor does their first and second albums. However, because their third album is titled "Tha Living Ambitious", that is what I call them. The reason why I know you'll like this is that if you have a problem, they rap about it, from death in family to being broke to fake friends to gettin high to about anything. The people MOST likely to love this shit is if you from a family that ain't much money and you trying to come up in the world, this is like motivation. ENJOY!
