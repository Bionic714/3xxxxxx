This new set stars the most amazing new grappler to appear in years, 2003 Abu Dhabi World Champion, Marcelo Garcia. What you will learn on these tapes is that Marcelo Garcia?s techniques are not based on size, strength or superior conditioning. His moves are so unique that most of his opponents are unsure of that to do when fighting him. What Marcelo teaches is the exact strategies and techniques he used to win the 2003 Submission Grappling World Championships.

In Marcelo Garcia?s first submission grappling series, his taking the back DVD became an instant favorite and is considered to be the very best back video ever made. On this Sport Jiu-Jitsu DVD, Garcia continues his "taking the back" legacy and shows some of the most creative methods ever seen on video.
