,Subzeroman2k2,2007-11-13T08:10Z,"Dumb question.
Audio AC3 2.0. This means TWO channel of audio, and no need a 5.1 or 7.1 system, right?

Sorry for being annoyed! "
,Subzeroman2k2,2007-11-13T08:34Z,"An off topic, sorry, but you guys ""do"" the last episode (S07E07) of  Smallville, right? Well, if yes, please make the next episode in a little bit higher quality. No offense, but the CTU's previous ones, however, look more vivid although yours is fine. The riding scene at the beginning (of E7) with Travis song would be perfect if the image quality is better. I know I ask too much and sound like an ass and you may ignore me but I have to write this because I and my friends love this show much.
Thank you very much for your job. I'm here, in a third world, would die in silliness and ignorance without you guys. Please keep the light! :D"

,jhUyYds,2007-11-13T11:11Z,"The audio is ac3 2.0? Most x264 rips of prison break are with 5.1, so what's up with the low quality.

BTW, you don't need a 5.1 system to play a 5.1 source. If properly configured, the player will convert it to 2.0 nicely."

,jhUyYds,2007-11-13T12:06Z,"Ah, I see, the description is just wrong. Sound is 5.1, and video is not xvid, but h264 (like the filename says)."
