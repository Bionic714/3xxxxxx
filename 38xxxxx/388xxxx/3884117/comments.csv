,scrapetorrent,2007-12-27T01:27Z,Is this the full game? -- Why are other rips over 2 or even 3 GB?
[V],Subzero!,2008-01-11T21:16Z,"full game... just without a few movies, and musics... really not worth to mention!.... and why the other rips are bigger, well, guess they cant crunch the bytes that much as ToeD does.... dunno..."
,ouz29,2008-01-22T17:28Z,shivagold great master!

,Echidnax,2008-07-11T04:02Z,"Couple things:
Download took around 12 hours to complete; lucky I wasn't planning to use the computer during that time, or I would've stopped the download.
And this is probably a completely idiotic question, but how does one un-rar something?  And what is the difference between this and .zip?
Um, actually, it may just be easier to give me complete directions about how to download this properly.
Thanks, from a newb who really wants to play Tomb Raider for free!"
,travmam,2008-09-06T10:00Z,"Can you please delete the hidden files thumbs.db in future releases? We don't need that shit form ms.

People must check ""Do not cache thumbnails"" in Explorer->Folder Options->Tools->View!  
Viva irfanview!.

Also the save from this release does not compatible with the original version and vice versa. Beware!"

,atlantisisdead,2008-10-20T06:12Z,"!st of all, there is a big difference between .rar and .zip - .rar is opened by WinRar, and .zip is opened by Windows Compressed Folder program and/or Winzip. One cannot open the other. And, to top it all off, even though we are told to ""unrar"" the files and play,.. they in fact, are not .rar files. They are .7z files which belong to a totally different compression program altogether. Even though it may be a good one, I had to download yet ONE more fucking compression program and I installed it in a folder called ""Yet One More Fucking Compression Program"" Google 7-zip and you will find lots of places to download yet one more fucking compression program. I love having billions of compression programs which aren't compatible with each other's  compressed files, don't you? Anyway, after installing this unwanted additional program, knowing I will have to keep it and all the other myriad of compression programs collected over time out of necessity because they don't allow the compressed files to be opened by any other programs, I then followed the additional instructions to run the .bat file. I wasn't real happy about this, because it seems old old old games with .bat files don't often run very well on my windows xp. But, it works fine. So far so good, just go find one more compression program to install and it's done. Oh, and that LaraNude thing is just a plant which doesn't work. Hmm.. wonder why. Anyway, the game works."

,torrentjunkie2,2009-01-20T13:18Z,"Heads up.
I know you say that some detect viruses but I detected this one with AVG when unzipping

Trojan horse generic 11.AJFO
I's in the Lara nude 7Z file. So I didn't care.
