,romanxxii,2007-11-13T12:22Z,"Heon, thanks for the upload, but it would really help if you unpacked the file after finishing your .RAR download wherever you got it from, since .AVIs really don't need further compression.

Just a suggestion of course."
[V],He0n,2007-11-13T12:48Z,are lasy take 10 secs to rar dude ;)
,MrJesus,2007-11-13T16:15Z,"I like to save my files as avi's (much neater), but also seed. Rar's are overly complicated, even though easy enough to handle.

This is like saying ""use the stairs, it's good for you"" when you complain that someone has peed in the elevator. "
