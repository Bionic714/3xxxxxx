This is Cubedesktop v.1.1.2 and it's a cool program that allows you to view your desktop in 3D inside a cube. Designed for Vista but sometimes works on XP as well. The crack works. However, the only thing you might see is that it will tell you that you have 60 minutes left of trial. Don't worry, it will still work and run forever and fully activated. It's just a silly message, that's all.
