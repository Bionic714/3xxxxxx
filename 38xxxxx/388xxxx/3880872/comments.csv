,jlc07,2007-11-10T03:20Z,"Question guys: I'm trying to seed this at as high a rate possible, but it seems to be maxing out around 50 kB/s. Anything I can do to improve this, I know I can download anywhere from 100-400kB/s, so I would think I can do better than that.

I don't have any other torrents active, so I'm not sure what else to do. Sorry, kind of new at this."
,jlc07,2007-11-10T18:17Z,"sorry about the disconnect last night. my connection went bad, so it wasnt' seeding. I'm seeding again though, but it still won't seed very fast, any help is appreciated."
,jlc07,2007-11-11T23:27Z,please help seed after you've downloaded this. thanks.
,ektelon36,2007-11-12T04:54Z,Fantastic torrent.  Great job.  I will seed for as long as possible.  Thanks for the great effort.
,dullment,2007-12-01T07:41Z,"Thanks a lot! I just leech ""All my life"" everything else I have on CD. Billy rules, too bad he stopped making rock-music!"
,bumpy7,2007-12-30T02:23Z,"Thank you so much for linking my past memories!  This is soo much more than a good post.  I don't have words.

I guess thanks."
,jeepmansro,2008-02-08T00:14Z,great collection thanks!
,MrMalkovich,2008-03-25T01:04Z,God do i love Discography's! Thanks for the collection jlc07!
,dirty_cousin,2008-03-28T19:59Z,Thanks dude.  Keep on rocking in the free world!
,Canamjay,2008-04-23T19:53Z,This load is a bunch of crap.. seldom can one play even one song to completion.. All My Life is NOT there.. I've had to go thru this mess and delete MOST of the (many repeated) songs which play only a small intro.. then skip.. just AWFUL... 
,jlc07,2008-04-26T04:15Z,"A collection that includes a number of Greatest Hits compilations is going to have songs doubled. 

There's nothing wrong with the files...if you're not happy with it, tough shit. You're not paying for it so you have no control over what happens. Quit your bitching."
,lordofwar1234,2008-04-26T20:49Z,"Yeah, really....People expect perfection in file sharing. I mean I agree to upload something really well put together but if I don't like it, tough shit because it only cost me a few cents in internet broadband and electricity. jlc07, thank you. I can't wait to check this out and of course seed. I'm 23 and I rather this music be part of my memories than the bullshit that's out right now. Thank you for the torrent, very much."
,lordofwar1234,2008-04-26T20:58Z,"Dang it, I checked it out and this is in m4a...I can't play this on my mp3 player because I don't buy iPod and converting this to mp3 would be ridiculous.  Thanks you anyhow but I might as well not download it. "
,woodstock63,2008-05-29T14:32Z,Just use Xilisoft Audio Converter and comvert them to mp3's all at once. That's what I did and had no issues.
,jamlat,2008-09-27T00:19Z,"oh nooooo!
I couldn't find anything wrong with the torrent.  But good news, I can help with the bitching!!!  Just put extra vaseline on your pussy when you go to the beach and then the sand won't irritate you so much,  m'kay.  Sand in the pussy always makes leechers complain."
,bbull80,2010-09-25T04:14Z,awesome torrent man! it appears to be without blemishes.
