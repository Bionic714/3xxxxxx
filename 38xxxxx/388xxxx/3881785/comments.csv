,fabribek,2007-12-17T07:56Z,"What bit rate is this in?

I found a torrent no loss codec FLAC under the name of centerpointe. It's just short a file.

Season's Greetings!"
,fabribek,2007-12-17T08:00Z,I forgot to mention that it is really important to have  loss-less for these subtle sound imbedded tracks to have a positive effect on your brain / consciousness.
,brynjarh,2008-03-15T17:18Z,"fabribek, from where did you get the idea that it's really important to have loss-less?"
,calimos,2008-03-27T11:28Z,"The claim that loss-less recording of files such as these is rooted in a myth perpetuated by their manufacturers (going back as far as pre-CD audio cassette days) that the recordings contain unique frequencies that cannot be duplicated by conventional recording equipment. Such claims were, of course, an effort to discourage folks from making copies. Of course the claims were nonsense. Recording files such as these in loss-less is a waste of time and bandwidth for both uploaders and downloaders alike."
,idiocyinbubbles,2008-04-17T21:02Z,"is this the same thing as ""level 1, 2"" etc?

and... no loss-less? o.O"
,Talalexander,2008-04-27T10:51Z,Are the bineural beats retained in this mp3 version? I heard they could be lost in the compression. 
,franzrebs3,2008-05-07T16:09Z,Talalexander's right. the binaural beats are the most important.
,franzrebs3,2008-05-08T12:37Z,"I just checked, and the bit rate is 128kbps. Oh well, I'll just try it out anyway."
,BoooZee,2008-05-22T13:20Z,"calismos clearly you dont know what your talking about cos if you record from tape to tape you do lose audio quality, this is why the digital medium is better because you can make exact copies without any loss in audio quality."
,BoooZee,2008-05-22T13:31Z,furthermore if you compress your sound files you are losing sound quality giving you a shishy sound to your hats and other high frequencies. they record at at least 44.1 for a good reason.
,blumppin12,2008-06-05T17:05Z,hey everyone.I think you must use another torrent website if you want this file because it is really important that the original version of awakening prologue and all the levels of centerpointe should not be compressed.If you use this file it will not have any effect on you.
,bajselulle,2008-08-28T22:06Z,"Can someone tell me if these version is the correct one. Have someone benefitted from these CD´s?

,sammakute,2008-09-25T19:17Z,"samma
the awakening prolouge is in mp3.it does not matter.iam also listening to it in mp3.only in high levels like level 3,4,and purification and flowers levels it does matter because of low frequency level which r removed during compression.Listen to it in mp3,you will get the results. "
,ePants,2008-10-08T23:59Z,"Good grief, people.  Educate yourselves before spreading around your ill-informed suppositions. 


Binaural beats do NOT inherently require loss-less compression; they only require that their carrier tone frequency range not be filtered in the process of being compressed.  

Most mid-to-low quality mp3's do filter out anything below 10Hz, but for most binaural recordings, that's just fine.  Most of the carrier tones (the contrasting pitches which create the binaural tones) are well above that range.   

Besides, the 10Hz floor on mp3 compression is irrelevant considering that virtually all non-professional headphones perform poorly with anything under 20Hz - which is fine, because the human ear's range only begins at around 20Hz.  Since the carrier tones must be audible (i.e: above 20Hz) in order for binaural tones to be effectively generated, mp3 compression complaints are completely unfounded.

Now, for you audiophiles out there, yes bitrate does come into play.  The sine wave carrier tones must be heard smoothly enough to create consistent and steady binaural tones.   128 kbps is mathematically sufficient to create binaural tones and be effective.  320 kbps would be much better (and is my personal preference), but 128 kbps will do the job just fine.  

If you're one of those who have tried high bitrate mp3's and are claiming that they don't work, I'd guess that it's a case of reverse placebo effect induced by your lossless-elitism and auditory snobbery.  



AN101233, thanks for the torrent."
,ePants,2008-10-10T00:30Z,"Ok, I've got a problem with the ID3 tags...

Track 1/6 is 1:01:20
The Awakening Prologue

Track 2/6 is 30:03
The Dive

Track 3/6 is 29:58
The Immersion

Track 4/6 is 30:04  
...and is named ""floating _320kbps_""   O_o

Track 6/6 is 32:42
Oasis-Theta

....and the final track has no ID3 tags filled in other than the track name ""Audio Training-Sync Meditation Cente"" and play time of 30:18.  I can only assume it should be track 5.  

But which track is Quietude?  And what is the other unnamed track since there are only 5 tracks listed in the instructions?"
,nglmp,2008-12-07T01:20Z,"Thanks!

And thank you ePants for the explanation! :)"
,blumppin12,2009-01-27T04:03Z,"Hi,
 Can  anyone upload holosync support letters here? I have been searching this in the net for so long and I couldn't find it. If anyone have any sort of links to support letters, please post them or upload them. I asking this because I don't know how to use these sound tracks. Support letters provide suggestions on how to use these soundtracks."
,nonamedood,2009-04-17T02:14Z,LOL. You don't need to be an audiophile or any kind of elitist to hate MP3. :)
,AAmazone,2009-04-23T11:05Z,"Seriously guys!

I wanna get this prologue going!

Please tell me now. IS this the proper version?

I mean the full version with the right binural beats and all that I will require to get the right effect.
I´ve just used the WRONG level for 6 days.
I started out with the awakening level before this level.
So I´ve allready done 30x60mins on the wrong level.

I hope this doesn't mess up my brain!

So once again is THIS what i should start with AND is it ok that I play it in VLC?

Best Regards 

//R"

OMFG ... It sounds like your brain is ALREADY MESSED UP !!!!"
,Gremlin_59,2010-02-13T19:47Z,What about that floating thing? whats that for
,jtrehern,2010-03-05T05:18Z,ePants is correct and thank you for your post.  I bought all of these and lost them in Katrina.  So yes these are the ones you need to get going.  These files work just fine in .mp3 format.  The only thing that is important is the bitrate and the bitrate of this torrent is fine.  
,nvsblgns,2011-04-26T22:52Z,"ok, rather than dispute the effects or non-effects based on quality
using binaural on your corpus callosum will have SOME effect
so let's discuss this effect
alpha is for relaxation and theta is for problem solving
I have noticed these effects from using those two alone at the lower bit rate of 128
I had originally bought the system and it saved my life..my copies were destroyed so I downloaded them from here and am glad I did"
,jaketthomas,2011-07-29T21:48Z,"Guys, I have purchased the Holosync Program. I only came on here to re-download it, because I had it on CD's, and my CD's got all messed up in my car when it was 100+ degrees out one day.  I downloaded this torrent, and it doesn't work.  You're all wasting your time.  You need FLAC files to feel the effects.  Take it from someone who has used the actual program.  These files at 128 are WORTHLESS!"
,jaketthomas,2011-07-29T21:50Z,"To further elaborate, I felt ZERO of the effects this program is supposed to bring with these files.  You're just wasting your time.  If you did download this and you DID feel effects, imagine what you could get from the actual CD's themselves.  "
,disagreeable,2012-06-25T09:59Z,"the floating track is to be used when you dont want to use the meditation cd's. 
This track can be put on repeat and played at low volume for the whole night."
