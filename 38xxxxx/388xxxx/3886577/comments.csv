,bikes,2008-02-17T22:38Z,"Well it's certainly not the Directors cut because the runtime is too short. The directors cut is 194 minutes.

,Buckiller,2008-03-28T13:55Z,"the theatrical release is 145 min... this should be the director's cut, its about 185 min here.

Seed Please!! Im dying to see this to see if its any good. "
,thepiratep,2008-04-29T16:47Z,is the director's cut or not ?
,Frank-dj,2008-05-03T15:11Z,"This IS the Directors Cut of Kingdom of Heaven!

He is shorter than mentioned on IMDB because the NTSC version (and cinema version) is 24 frames/second and the PAL version is 25 frames/second. This is with every movie, so that's why the axxo-rip is 4% shorter than mentioned on IMDB"
,aquateen69,2008-05-12T08:55Z,"Everyone should know tha axxo's torrents are the best on the net! Mad props to the man, keep the good shit coming!!"
,o_patriot_o,2008-06-24T21:24Z,"For those who wonder if this movie is directors cut or not. It is!! And it is grate!!

You don?t need to reconfirm what is already written in description because torrent belongs to aXXo and there is VIP barner along his name. 

aXXoÂ´s torrents NEVER CONSIST OF: BAD QUALITY VIDEOS, VIRUS TORRENTS, FALSEHOOD INFORMATION ETC...If it is a REAL aXXo than u may download it without fear and doubts.

Sincerely

,SpikeDemon,2009-07-15T05:27Z,why are there no torrents of this movie where the files are put together?
,rohan11,2009-09-08T22:53Z,"Axxo u are god,great quality 11/10"
,Stelios7xXx,2009-10-09T20:15Z,do someone knows where to find greek subtitles for this movie?
,voltsin,2010-01-20T13:08Z,"Note that there is a >2 min ""intermission"" that consists of black screen & music.  This occurs right at the end of the 1st cd & continues at the start of the 2nd cd.  

This is obviously straight from the source & is not aXXo's fault in any way, but I'm just mentioning it as it some people, I'm sure, will appreciate knowing this prior to dl'ing."

,jdarl,2011-01-04T06:28Z,"To aXXo, The Pirate God!"
,surfbug,2011-02-21T00:49Z,"These two files can be easily joined with any video joiner, like for instance Boilsoft video joiner. The files use the exact same encoding and the split is in the middle of a dark screen, not in the middle of a scene."
