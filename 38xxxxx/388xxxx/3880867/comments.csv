http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3791384/2313_Full_Albums____See_Description__-heartbraden"
,heartbraden,2007-11-18T04:11Z,"Awesome, man!  Thank you!"
,neuroner,2007-11-22T17:06Z,"Total speed is as of right now listed to be 0.1 MB
per second. Thats not the best.

I will have completed this in about 24 hours, 
then I will stop seeding heartbraden's big
torrent and give you guys 900 kb/s upload
on thisone for a few days.

This way, there will be alot of complete sources."
,neuroner,2007-11-22T17:07Z,"That should be 900 kiloBytes per second
Sorry about the typo"
,neuroner,2007-11-23T00:19Z,"Speed worsened :\

I will return to the torrent Monday and start
seeding it then."
,neuroner,2007-11-26T10:08Z,"Well, Monday's here, and Ive still got 24 hours
of downing to do. It seems a second postphone-
ment is in place here.

kbax, have you considered submitting this
on a couple more torrentsites? "
,kbax,2007-11-27T13:20Z,"I perfer TPB, maybe once it's done and got a couple seeds I will."
,zite83,2008-01-05T23:27Z,Sorry had a huge problem with my NAS server.. all is up and working again..   74%  will keep seeding once it is finished so we have at least 2 seeds
,zite83,2008-01-13T22:17Z,100%! starting to seed... mornings and nights are the times I keep my upload to 8KBs  during the afternoon when me and my room mate are at work.. 100% of my bandwidth is given.. have fun!  
,AfroBacon,2008-02-13T04:53Z,"good idea, soon as i finish heartbradens and yours (if possible) ill attempt to make my own

how were you able to make sure of no overlap?"
,kbax,2008-02-21T13:12Z,I looked at his spreadsheet with his music list and compared it to my music library... took a while but thats how i did it.
,kbax,2008-02-21T13:14Z,"Also my main computer died so i have not been seeding this torrent the last week or so, i've since than recovered it and should be up and running again soon!"
