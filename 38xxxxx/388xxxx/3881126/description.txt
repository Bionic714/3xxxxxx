Yosemite is a treasure trove of deep valleys, granite mountains, rivers, lakes, waterfalls, meadows and more. Hewn out by the massive power of ancient glaciers, the region is a labyrinth of natural wonders perched on top of the Californian high sierras. The scenery extends far beyond the famed valley and includes the mysterious Mono Lake and part of the California desert. Enjoy flights of unparalleled realism and beauty through the use of high resolution imagery and blur-free technology.
