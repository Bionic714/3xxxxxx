,Inkaren,2007-11-11T21:48Z,There's been a mistake in the file information. There's no subtitles.
,spinsis,2007-11-11T22:23Z,"Seed please, finally a proper release."
,Inkaren,2007-11-12T07:29Z,"I seed at much as I can, but also i need sleep :) My room becomes a sauna if I sleep with the CPU on."
,spinsis,2007-11-12T18:07Z,"Thanks, great stuff. Let's hope that someone finishes real quick and seeds it forward.."
,Inkaren,2007-11-12T18:21Z,"It will probably take a while before someone finishes it. The only time there's a 100% chance that I seed is when I'm at school. In the evening both my and my family uses the internet, and seeding slows down the internet pretty much."
,Z3R0OneOneSe7en,2007-11-14T21:01Z,is SEason 5 a DVD Rip? i been trying to find a SEason 5 DVD Rip
,Inkaren,2007-11-15T16:58Z,Every file is *.avi
,kingkongkimmo,2007-11-18T14:07Z,"Seed Plz im stuck at 31,3% "
,Inkaren,2007-11-18T19:16Z,"I haven't been able to seed this weekend.. It's always someone who uses the internet.
I will seed from 08:00 - ~15:00 (GMT+01:00) tomorrow"
,spinsis,2007-11-19T14:38Z,"I'm at 33%, it's moving slowly forward and my ratio is +3, so hopefully others are moving forward as well :)"
,onlyhopp,2007-11-27T07:22Z,seed seed seed please!!!!!
,spinsis,2007-11-28T23:07Z,"Seed! I'm stuck at 70%, I'll seed when it's done for sure."
,Laben285,2007-11-29T01:18Z,this sucks.i've been stuck at 71.6% for like 4 days.but i'm watching all the other episodes while im waiting :)
,spinsis,2007-12-01T10:11Z,Why does it say it's two seeders? I haven't seen a seed for days!
,ImaginaryGum,2007-12-01T13:26Z,"Inkaren: If your not, please use initial seeding :)"
,Inkaren,2007-12-02T12:43Z,ImaginaryGum: What is initial seeding?
,ImaginaryGum,2007-12-02T18:23Z,Inkaren: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-seeding
,GreenTempo,2007-12-02T23:50Z,Inkaren would pleeeease seed this? I looked at the peer list and it seems everyone is stuck at 78.45% Am I right everyone? It's very annoying that so far i can only watch the first two-three seasons all of which I've mostly seen.
,ImaginaryGum,2007-12-03T12:35Z,"I assume Inkaren is seeding as much as possible so be patient. Btw. Thanks Inkaren, its the perfect Family Guy torrent :)"
,Abstrakt_85,2007-12-03T15:11Z,Stuck at 78.9%.. Seed?
,spinsis,2007-12-03T16:03Z,Super-Seeding sounds good! I'm stuck at 78% too.
,spinsis,2007-12-05T15:20Z,Has anyone completed this torrent and is currently seeding?
,GreenTempo,2007-12-07T09:24Z,nobody has finishd downloading it because inkaren who uploaded it refuses to seed his own file so that others can have it.
,dominatoray,2007-12-07T15:47Z,come on it's not that hard leave it on for one night or something
,Inkaren,2007-12-09T14:23Z,GreenTempo - Excuse me for not having the worlds best situation at home =/
,spinsis,2007-12-10T12:16Z,Running: 6d 5h. avg. dl. speed: 26.3 kb/s. Someone considering downloading this might want to give it a second thought :)
,GreenTempo,2007-12-12T06:57Z,"Well assuming anyone but inkaren ever gets the full file(which isn't looking good, been a month already) it should go pretty fast since I'm sure alot of us downloading now will actually seed it unlike inkaren."
,frongo,2007-12-12T15:57Z,seed!!
,dominatoray,2007-12-12T17:42Z,im looking forward to this weekend when inkaren seeds and i move up to like 93%.
,Inkaren,2007-12-13T15:44Z,Chill mates. Most of them are at ~95%
,JadeHunterStarrz,2007-12-13T19:47Z,"I am at 83%. If, and when I get a full file I will seed this for around a month. 

If perhaps, Inkaren and our mystery seeder could tell us when they are are seeding or will be in the future we could hop on and get a few of us to finish this file."
,Inkaren,2007-12-13T21:53Z,"I have written that I seed when I'm at school, often somewhere between 08:00 and 16:00. Tryin' to get this when I'm asleep is not thinkable, because my room gets like 120 degrees if my CPU's on."
,JadeHunterStarrz,2007-12-14T06:46Z,"That's fine. I try to leave this computer on 24/7 that way I can finish the file and seed it for a while to help some other people out. At least we have 2 seeders now. As for you being at school, depending on your location some of the leechers may be unable to have their program running at that time. "
,spinsis,2007-12-14T09:06Z,"There are like 25 people stuck at 97.2%, then this torrent will spread pretty fast...."
,Inkaren,2007-12-14T09:48Z,Finally some1 who realizes that
,GreenTempo,2007-12-14T19:14Z,"well now that i've nearly gotten the whole file and there's no risk of you removing I'd like to say this to you Inkaren. Go suck a cock, what the hell is wrong with you? took you over a full god damn month to seed this thing. If you cant seed something dont put it on here you fag. You have a nice day now okay? Don't forget to go fuck your mother."
,zegzeg,2007-12-15T06:48Z,"GreenTempo: Grow up, jerk.
Inkaren: Thanks for doing the best you can..."
,JadeHunterStarrz,2007-12-15T07:51Z,"Green - That was pretty uncalled for. It took them a month BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LIFE. They have been more than generous in explaining to ALL of us why they don't seed as much as we would like, but ya know, that's okay, patience is something that we all get taught... and if we don't lean the first time we get to have the same lesson repeatedly until we get it. Looks like your gonna be stuck with that for a while.
Inkaren - Than ks for being patient with those of us who ask about seeding and such."
,Inkaren,2007-12-15T10:57Z,"GreenTempo - Who forces you to download this? I seed when I feel like seeding. And if you don't like it you don't have to download this. It would be much better if there were less people like you and more people like JadeHunterStarrz who really understands that I will get killed by my parents if I have my computer on 24/7.

Since almost everyone is around 99% I will give it a few hours today, so at least one gets the full file."
,spawn10462,2007-12-15T14:21Z,"Damn, that GreenTempo is a jerk. If he couldn't wait why didn't he get off his lazy idiot ass and buy the last two seasons, since those were the ones he hadn't seen?

Anyway, thanks to Inkaren for creating/seeding this. I just recently started watching Family Guy, and appreciate the sharing."
,spinsis,2007-12-15T15:45Z,Could you just seed it for halv an hour Saturday or Sunday? Most are stuck at 99.9% :)
,tieyourownshoo2,2007-12-15T20:17Z,"Im stuck at 99.9%... ive been working on it for about a month now... can someone please seed, once it finishes ill seed for a few days"
,Inkaren,2007-12-15T22:39Z,"As I said, I seed when I feel like seeding."
,iDuckie,2007-12-16T05:17Z,"Could someone, doesn't have to be the original person, but ANYONE who has finished this PLEASE seed? I'm only showing 1 peer and no seeds, and it's been at 92% for about a week now. Thanks. "
,Inkaren,2007-12-16T11:23Z,"I hope that the speed will increase now, since a few have reached 100%"
,zegzeg,2007-12-16T14:42Z,"Inkaren: Yeah, I think with 117 seeders now things will go a lot faster.  :-)  Thanks."
,MeatPopsicle,2008-01-06T06:14Z,Thanks alot for this! A perfect compilation :)
,Inkaren,2008-01-30T16:38Z,chemicalneo - I've done that since a few months ago ;)
,bcoop,2008-03-15T02:34Z,"GreenTempo,

Shut the fuck up. If you don't like the torrent then gtfo."
,the_wobbie,2008-05-22T03:34Z,could some people please seed im only getting 50 kbps max so if people could seed that would be awsome. thanks.
,seeddrone,2008-07-17T13:05Z,"People,would you be so kind and seed please? 5kb/sec the last 10 hours,I'm dismayed :("
,grynker,2008-11-05T22:34Z,seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed plz need this 
,grynker,2008-11-05T22:35Z,"5kb/s :(
