This Is a total conversion mod for the game startrek legacy developed by a non profit fan based team and is free to distribute


This has been, and will continue to be, a wild ride.
 
On to the nitty gritty. You can select which directory to install the mod into, although It has been set to the default Legacy directory. This installer puts all the files in the proper places inside your Legacy Game. It is recommended that you have a brand new install of Legacy for this mod. That install should include Official Patches 1.1 and 1.2 for Multiplayer. If you wish to see the correct chunking of nacelles and such things when they are blown off your ship, you can only do this in single player in an unpatched game. Note that this mod DOES work well in an unpatched version of Legacy.

Note the Many new game modes in the Ultimate Universe, many originally authored by TJoz. Battlefest Mode by MaxLoef, and Exploration Mode by Chris Jones.

   The Ultimate Universe is fully Multiplayer compatible. We have found that using a program called Hamachi <http://www.hamachi.cc/> helps when connecting for Multiplayer - use the LAN setting. 

A utility is included to allow for the six races in the Ultimate Universe to be selectable in Multiplayer. All players that join the game will need to have the same 4 races selected so they don't get the "different version" error when trying to join. 

It doesn't matter what order you pick the races in as long as you choose the same 4 races as everyone else.  It sorts them and once they are changed it updates the boxes to the races that are currently selected although possibly shown in different boxes than you selected.  There is no need to use the Default button between race changes just choose your new selections.

This same utility allows for switching the default race in the mode maps - default is Federation. You can also disable the on screen displays for movie making or scenic screenshots. Muldrf authored this utility.

Upgrade system, here! Upgrade/Refit your ships in the ship select area. Max Loef and Phoenix, with credits to Tjoz for the initial upgrade system and upgrade system odf template..

New Interface from Mindwipe..

Some ships, as you'll see, are still stock. Our Goal is to replace all the stock ships with newer better looking ones. 

There are 6 playable races in Single Player and Multiplayer Modes. Cardassian and Vulcan are selectable in addition to the original four (see above for multiplayer notes). The menus are different and less laggy, as you might notice, good for low end PC's.

 More features of this mod..

1.   Originally the game had a max player limit of 4 player we have extended that 6 and 8 player maps, through Trickester's original Community Mod.
2.   Larger, more dramatic Explosions (by Miri's Hot/Max Loef/Mindwipe) - New Explosion Audio as well.
3.   We have approximately 70+ new maps added.
4.   Historical Missions added - Wrath of Khan (scripted to end properly), The Die Is Cast, Enterprise Incident, First Contact, Paradise Lost, etc...
5.   Special Modes with approximately 130+ ships in battles - Single Player - also some Original missions, One On One, System Conquest, Survival, and Armada mode. There are lite versions of many of these. 
6.   AI Ships More aggressive. Smaller ships, when in numbers, may fly in formation.
7.   Lots of new ships ranging from ENT, TOS, TMP, and TNG era's with a few future ships.
8.   New Repair interface / Faster repair rates
9.   Enemy Ships repair themselves in game..
10.  Overhaul of stock interface, now a friendlier interface.
11. Some elements of the 'Tactical Enhancement Mod' included
12. You can tractor any ship.. note that their engines are disabled when you do that - permantly - still - the tractor beams may have some use down the line..

See the included readme folder for more features..

Known Bugs:

1. The special mode missions in Single Player do not end properly, yet. You need to escape out of the game manually. Note that the scripting tools released by Bethesda in August 2007 will help to solve this problem. We think you'll find it only a minor inconvenience at this time. 
2. The Occasional Dancing Torpedo - on very few ships.

14. Lots of New Enterprise Era ships implemented by Max Loef!!!
15. Cungi's Excelsior Escort Class included - with permission.
16. Cardassian Phaser and Torpedo audio is unique!
17. ALL NEW EXCELSIOR MODELS - from scratch - By MOONRAKER!!

Torpedos have been sped up for more realism. 
Heavy Cruiser Odf has been properly linked to the Prometheus.
Repair file has been linked to the Lakota file.

The Ultimate Universe Borg Pack - Brand New Borg Cube

With this new Cube you will enjoy the maps

1. Wolf359
2. First Contact (specially balanced - Defiant version included)
3. Unimatrix One and Two
4. One on One Vs. the Cube (This is Tough)
5. The Borg Attack (Get Armoured Voyager)
6. Special Mode Borg Maps - Survival, Armada

A slew of new maps will be included. The Cube will take on..

1. Klingons. Recall in 'Best of Both Worlds' that Admiral Hansen said the Klingons were sending ships. They did.
2. Romulans. The Praetor would not be proud of this, lol..
3. Vulcans - This one's fun - Vulcans in formation.
4. The Dominion - you may know that the Dominion share a border with the Borg. It is conceivable that they have clashed.
5. Cardassians.
6. Temporal Cold War - 2 maps - If Archer had not been able to stop the freighter in 'Regeneration'  - A cube makes its way to Sector 001 in the Ent Timeline... and progresses ahead to TOS era.

The Breen take on the Borg in a Survival Map or 2 .. Looks much cooler with this new Cube.

What if in the Enterprise episode 'Regeneration', Archer had not been able to stop that 'Alien' freighter? You could theorize that the 'Temporal Cold War' got involved here and the Borg managed to get a Cube to Earth in the Ent timeline. Some of the Starfleet ships, the ones who did not engage the Borg, survived and evolved into TOS era - where another Cube battle took place...

Any and all use of this model and texture must be approved by the creators.  Use without formal approval from all party's involved in its creation, it will be deemed as a fraudulent claim of rights to having built the model and or created the texture.  In such cases you will be asked to immediately cease using the model and or texture.
