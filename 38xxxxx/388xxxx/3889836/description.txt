                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the 1970's, a prominent Vancouver high school initiated Quest, a one 
semester outdoor education program.  But for teacher Tom Ellison, Quest was 
more than just an outdoor program.  It was an opportunity to conduct his own 
private brand of sex education with a continuing supply of female students.

For many Quest students, massages, skinny-dipping, and sexually charged comments 
from teachers were simply the expected.  Many students were ferociously devoted 
to the charismatic teacher, so Tom  had his pick of girls to experience their 
first "love" with him. For other teachers in the school and for parents, the 
rumours about Quest and its three male leaders were better left alone.

School of Secrets is a story of self-redemption for those women, who after 
years of tormented silence, decided to come forward. This riveting documentary 
traces the outcome of the complaints filed to the Vancouver Sex Crimes Unit and 
the investigation that brought Ellison to trial in the fall of 2006. It also 
delves into the cautionary implications for the parents, the school and the 
community that turned a deaf ear to the rumours.

School of Secrets is produced and directed by Melanie Wood and produced by 
Eunice Lee, of Bossy Boots Productions & Stranger Productions (Vancouver). The 
film was commissioned by CBC Newsworld and is a world television premiere.
