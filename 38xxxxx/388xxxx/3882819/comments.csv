,lareth2209,2008-08-15T16:13Z,"Indeed, I'm grateful, no idea how I would've got all this awesome and fantastic music any other way."
,Thalinor,2009-02-11T04:09Z,"Note to people who are thinking about DL thir or any other torrents by ths guy; he does not include complete albums.  Every album is missing half the tracks.  I have no idea why he is being such an ass.  By his own words these are out of print and impossible to find music, its not like you are going to be saving some record co money.  This guy is just some small cock asshole on a power trip trying to feel special by holding half albums over peoples heads.

The worst part is you dont tell people in the ""about this torrent"" you are missing half the files.  If this was by accident (or its all you have) I would understand but its just you being a cock sucker."
,Rivenshield,2009-02-19T08:04Z,"No Thalinor, you utter horse's ass, NO. When I put up torrents of out of print music you get the whole thing. Sorry it's beyond a narcisstic teenage crybaby like you to accept a free gift graciously."

,chokkk,2009-11-01T19:02Z,Many thanks for this splendid torrent!
,ap0cryphite,2010-11-24T17:49Z,"Rivenshield, thank you so much for sharing all this music! I don't even know where I would have found it otherwise :)"
,harrydick,2012-01-29T16:30Z,"Thalinor is correct.  Half the songs are missing from this torrent.  You could have labeled this as a sampler or something, but you make yourself out to be a liar."
