Here are some old CD's of medieval music for your listening pleasure -- some of which have been out of print for more than a decade. Track information and cover art may not be available for all of them.

To prevent the problems with tag corruption that plagued my last attempt to share this fine old music with you, I have wrapped each torrent into a single .rar file. I will be seeding five of them, so be sure to amaze your friends and collect them all.  :D

This torrent includes:

Camino de Santiago (Ensemble Fur Fruhe Musik Augsburg)
Et in terra pax (Ensemble Fur Fruhe Musik Augsburg)
Hildegard von Bingen und ihre Zeit (Ensemble Fur Fruhe Musik Augsburg)
Let The Dance Begin (Instampitta)
Songs of Chivalry (Martin Best Medieval Ensemble)

All are high quality rips at 320 kB or better! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!
