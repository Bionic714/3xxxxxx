BluePrint√¢??s KMSP scenery depicts the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International airport as it exists today.  MSP has two terminals, the older Lindbergh terminal with its seven concourses, and the newer Humphrey terminal.  The two terminals have been modeled with the highest level of detail allowed by the Flight Simulator.  Special attention was paid to the accuracy of the airport layout, including runways, taxiways and ramps as well as the configuration and location of all airline gates.  The FAA control tower, fire stations, general aviation, aircraft maintenance, cargo and military facilities have been depicted.  The highest degree of detail was also applied to all major buildings in those areas. As a bonus, a model of the Mall of America (the US largest) is included to increase realism during approach to runway 35.
