,allen6867,2007-11-14T18:55Z,the audio won't play for me...anyone know why?  I'm a mac user and I am using Quicktime to run it...tried DivX player...  any suggestions?  This is the first file of MANY downloaded that the audio doesn't work.
,stevetyphoon,2007-11-15T16:15Z,"allen.....I've had this problem a couple of times recently. I have an upto date version of DivX player etc. I saw somewhere else on-site the solution....Download the VLC player, its a freebie from here:  www.videolan.org/vlc/    Must be using some unusual codec or something. As you know, anyhting by AXXO is only going to be top quality so enjoy the movie now!! Cheers"

,luffarungen,2007-11-25T23:17Z,why is the picture so red'ish all the time? really irritating to see this in most of axxo's releases. I know you hafta destroy some of the crisp original video quality to make the film into just one cd of 700 mb's...but making the picture quality suck isn't the way.
