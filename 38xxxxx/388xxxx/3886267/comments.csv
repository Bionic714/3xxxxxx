,5ltr355,2008-03-22T09:16Z,"Good quality, thanks!"
,WonderSlug,2008-03-25T08:54Z,"Thank you for this upload!

I was hoping for the FLAC version until her CD gets released next month here in the USA.

However, 320Kbps MP3 are almost as good and will work until I can get my hands on her CD release  :D"
,omega1147,2008-04-05T18:45Z,very nice work thanks
,darklemming,2008-05-05T17:59Z,"I prefer lossless. FLAC works, I just convert it to .WAVs and then in iTunes I encode them into AAC-Lossless.

Thanks anyway dude, nice torrent.
