This is weird. I had some kind of network crash which I think was caused by Mcafee firewall. I uninstalled that but it happened again, so I removed all the Mcafee stuff from the registry, cleaned the pc with CCleaner etc then re-booted. Then this torrent and my "Freeware 3" torrent had files missing, so have re-uploaded both.
