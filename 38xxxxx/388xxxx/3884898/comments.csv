,sweets1970,2007-11-12T18:51Z,I remember seeing another Bigfoot flick as a kid that featured a campsite scene in which the big guy rampages in at night and some hick hauls ass out of the john with toilet paper at his ankles.  Anyone remember this one?  I am allowed to write run on sentences on this site.

,CHOP857,2007-12-15T01:33Z,"This movie was pretty cool and I plan on watching it again. You would think it was made in the late 60,s or early 70,s from how old it looked. I thought there were some funny scenes especially when a guy is taking a piss in the bushes and the bigfoot pulls his dick off and blood suirts out everywhere . "
