,Joe_purdy,2007-11-13T04:21Z,i am seeding. if u start downloading something of mine and i am not seeding its because my girlfriend is doing her homework and needs the bandwith so just wait and i will open utorrent.:)
,Joe_purdy,2007-11-13T04:24Z,it sucks when ppl just download and dont seed. i am still seeding the last 3 i put up. my ratio is at 23 and there are no seeders but me.

,XxGLITCHxX,2008-04-14T01:22Z,"gotta love buckethead. arent you the one who uploaded a whole bunch of his albums @ once in .rar?

im trying to figure out where to get that again, but thanks for this album! will seed!"
,BLuNTeD,2008-04-21T21:44Z,"Thanks for the upload, I will seed on for a good while once I finish the upload, though, I just started making torrents for Demonoid, and for some reason, even though I have 8mb ADSL, my upload speeds get no higher than 15kbps, even though I have it set to 270kbps...
