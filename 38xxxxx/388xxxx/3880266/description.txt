              As a child I loved the book "Spacecraft 2000 to 2100AD",       
                      and years later I found it on amazon.com,              
              eventually purchasing the other three books in the series.     
                                                                             
            Because my torrent of the first book "Spacecraft" was so         
         well recieved even after only one day (and great space battles      
         too), also from the stories of people finally being able to         
         find this book from their childhood like me (and by popular         
         demand as well), I have decided to scan and torrent the other books.
                                                                             
            "God created Arrakis to train the faithful."                     
          - from "The Wisdom of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
