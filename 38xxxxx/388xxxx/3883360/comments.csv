I thoght DivX-files only could contain one audiotrack.  If that is so, this one has only German!  :-b
(And it's a rather poor dubbing too!  :-(  )"
[T],paulyearwig,2008-02-17T10:16Z,tried this with several media players including vlc player. there is definately only 1 audio track and its german.
,thedunce,2008-02-17T14:45Z,Complete Bullshit. It only has one audio and its German. No English or Sweden.

The movie is only 720x304 :(

This is what mplayer reports:

VIDEO:  [DX50]  720x304  24bpp  25.000 fps  1300.8 kbps (158.8 kbyte/s)
AUDIO: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, s16le, 128.0 kbit/9.07% (ratio: 16000->176400)
Selected audio codec: [mp3] afm: mp3lib (mp3lib MPEG layer-2, layer-3)

So with this description I call it a fake!"
