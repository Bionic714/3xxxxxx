"Twitch of the Def Nerve" is an album and companion film from Some Bizzare recording artists Monkey Farm Frakenstein.  This torrent includes their album, the famous "MFF vs The Evil Dead" (video and audio-only), and the super-rare promo film, "Twitch of the Def Nerve: The Movie."  The LP and movie are mostly made of samples from grindhouse horror and exploitation movies, so if you like that sort of thing, this is for you!
