Mr. Hovind is a particularly lamentable member of the group: Not only does he not have the education (much less the credentials) to criticize Darwinian evolution in any informed way but, in addition, he's a felon serving time for tax evasion and other offenses. An excellent poster boy of the forces of darkness of creationism."

Nobody asked your opinion of creation, and attack people's credentials all you want. What are you? Some sort of biologist? Geologist? Cosmologist? STOOOO FUCKING FUUUUUUH

STUUHHHHHHFOOOOOO

Oh yeah, I forgot the Atheist model is represented by ""only perfect humans"".

And what ID is doing is ""filling in the blanks"" to as of yet undiscovered fields of science. Those blanks are being filled though, through rational thinking and the method of science.

The bible is only a book, written by people, 1700 years ago. ItÂ´s only a fairytale, a bedtime story, a means of control of society. 
ItÂ´s time to let it go and free the minds of people and make them thing freely and rational."
,Jonny645,2009-08-31T04:34Z,"""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""
