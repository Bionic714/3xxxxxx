,btw123,2007-11-25T11:11Z,"Has anyone of you got problems playing this game? I got a chipped ps2, when I load this game it goes through the normal initial setup of chosing the game you wanna play etc, but then when you're ready to play, it shows a little monster coming from the underground and stops there. If I press various keys other monsters come up but basically it stops (or goes round in circles) there.
Any help please ?"

You need to set the CDVD read to ""Smooth Read"", with that enabled your PCSX2 will be able to load discs a normal PS2 can't."
