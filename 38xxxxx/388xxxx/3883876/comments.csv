,TiticacaAndina,2008-01-27T05:10Z,Please SEED! Please!  I have been looking for this movie for ages.  Now I found it but it does not download... :-((
,misans1,2008-01-30T12:34Z,No one have seeded this since i started to download it (12/1) so its probably dead.
,RandiJ,2008-03-25T01:39Z,"Can someone please seed? Have been stuck on 87,8 % a few days. "

,ArtOP,2008-04-26T08:17Z,"I share zombie_candy's message!!!!
PLEASE SOMEBODY SEED THE LAST 3% OF THE FILM!!!! 

YUNIE ???? "
,elle666,2008-07-02T19:37Z,"IÂ´ve tried to download this for a week now; still on 97%.
You can buy the dvd on www.ioffer.com for only 6$....."
,candykisslips,2008-08-07T05:46Z,Seed Please ? I'm stuck at 97 % and really want a copy of this film. D= Will Seed. I always seed what I download for at least two weeks. 
,TiticacaAndina,2008-08-23T01:32Z,"I was so pleased with the downloading - and all of a sudden I am stuck on 97.0% too...  How can this be?  I am not experienced in uploading in here, but I don't get it why we can not have the entire movie downloaded.  The person sharing this movie must have uploaded 100% - or??  Very disappointing...  This movie is difficult to get hold of any other way.  It was only made for TV.  Gee - I do hope some way we will all get the missing part, eventually..."
,TiticacaAndina,2008-08-23T02:07Z,"I ran a search on Google, and this movie can be found for download here too:

http://www.downloadnova.com/search.php?a=index&q=stolenwomen

However - you must be a member.  And that is not for free...
"
,TrezDK,2008-09-05T12:06Z,"You dont upload the movie to a server, people who seed have the movie on their computer and it becomes availble when they are online.

But I must say it sucks that the original seeder seems to be offline 99.9% of the time."
,aslaug,2008-12-08T22:17Z,please seeeeeeeeeeeed this have tryd find it  for so long thanks
,ophelias26,2009-01-25T15:30Z,"please seed, i will seed when i am done, ty"
,TiticacaAndina,2009-02-03T08:02Z,"I just found this movie on YouTube! It was uploaded on November 28, 2008. Broadcasted on Lifetime - someone recorded it and uploaded as 17 clips to YouTube. The movie has no text, only English text when they speak Lakota.

I have all the clips downloaded, but I don't know how to upload it here.  Sorry.  Maybe someone more experienced can get this done?

Just wanted to inform all of you, as I know many of us have been waiting a long time to get this movie."
,zmorac,2009-02-09T20:56Z,"I have been stuck in 97% in three days now. Well I decided to put it on dvd anyway and...I was successful( I can watch full movie with few mistakes but it is watchable.Does anyone know how can I seed if I can` t download the entire movie? 
Sorry for my bad english!"
,Yunie,2009-07-11T16:33Z,"I seeded this for 4 months and NO ONE helped me seed, not a  single bloody person out of over 200!!! so I took it down, simple as. I didn't have the bandwidth or connection to seed it on my own, simple as so stop moaning please.
You can buy the DVD now for $19.99"
,TiticacaAndina,2009-08-06T16:14Z,"After many, many hours of searching I have managed to find this movie elsewhere!

I have the movie (avi) in my computer at 100%, and I would be happy to share for a while since so many people have waited for a full version for such a long time.

What might be a problem is that I am not at all used to/experienced in uploading torrent things. I can only promise to give it a good try. :-)"
,TiticacaAndina,2009-08-06T17:37Z,"
My version of this movie can be found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5044845

I hope it will work correctly!

The avi-file was scanned with NOD32, and nothing bad was found.

,WildNitro,2009-09-12T00:17Z,"New torrent up of this which is Yunie's upload, with her permission I'm torrenting it.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5085297/Stolen_Women_Captured_Hearts_TV_1997
This version is much better than the avi currently being seeded by TiticacaAndina."
