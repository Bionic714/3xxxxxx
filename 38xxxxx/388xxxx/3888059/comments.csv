,MeKongVC,2007-11-28T06:35Z,"hydro4life I'm not sure exactly what your DVDFab and DVD Shirnk problem is. If you are trying each separately or not. But if DVDFab is able to complete copying files but can't burn them, use DVD Shirnk to burn the completed DVDFab files. Hope this Helps."

,Eirik312,2008-03-07T13:35Z,"Some people said he'd been arrested Oo
finally I read what truly happend. Fuck TPB for pissing aXXo off!"
,Eirik312,2008-03-07T13:39Z,"For the non Norwegian people here who's wondering  what the link from ""tellerusken"" contains:

When aXXo uploaded The Simpsons Movie, some movie company wrote som crap to aXXo under ""comments"", and when aXXo required those comments removed by TPB, they didn't do anything, and aXXo took that really bad, and is now only using other ""pirate"" sites to upload. So it's still easy to find aXXo films. Cause other people upload the movies in his name, and gives him the credits of course, and us the movies. "
