,sistromo,2007-11-12T02:56Z,"It would have been more interesting for Mr. Hovind to tell about his experiences in jail, as the liar and criminal that he is."
,zardoz7026,2007-11-12T20:00Z,"Fundamentalists of any cult, especially Christian cults, are dangerous.  They all belong in jail."
,JCis,2008-05-11T20:35Z,"oh give me a break guys. hovind being jail for bulk tax issues (as in idiotic charges by the government) has absolutely nothing to do with the credibility his sermons and the info he says. No wonder why people are so ignorant, they kill the messenger (figuratively) and completely ignore message.
Evolution was shattered and proven wrong years ago. Try opening up your eyes and you?ll see science heavily favors creation.
Or if you don?t like hovind then there are plenty of other popular speakers on these topics

Also zardoz7026, cult is usually a denomination like jehovah?s witness or mormon who for example twist and change doctrine just enough to make it damnable. Biblical Christianity is obviously not a cult"
,Jonny645,2009-08-31T04:33Z,"""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""
