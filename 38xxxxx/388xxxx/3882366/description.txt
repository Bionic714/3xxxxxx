"Posada Carriles: Terrorism Made in USA", a Telesur and PanaFilms co-production, is a brand-new feature-length documentary from renowned Venezuelan filmmaker Angel Palacios that documents the terrorist path of Posada Carriles and his longstanding relation with the CIA, dating back to the 1960's. The result of two years of meticulous research of an investigative team that examined declassified documents and criminal files, and interviewed witnesses and survivors from several Latin American countries, this is a must-see film.
