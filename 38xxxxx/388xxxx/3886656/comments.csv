,doriansend,2007-11-12T21:48Z,"Hey BytorrTorrent, this may be a stupid question...but does it matter if I do the SN workaround FIRST, and then get the updates? I don't have internet on my mac, and am doing everything remotely from a PC....so I just wanted to make sure that If i do the workaround then get the updates, it won't cause any problems. Thanx for all your help!"
,doriansend,2007-11-12T22:00Z,Works perfectly!! Thanx so much!!

,BytorrTorrent,2007-11-13T18:39Z,"I can't really assure what's the best way dorlansend,  In my case I did it after software update, basically cause I founded this wonderfulll torrent after. Anyway, software update won't take longer than 5 minutes so if you can change the ID after upgrading, you can't go wrong! . cheers"

,fran5116,2007-11-16T21:46Z,"all this worked for me except for Compressor (which isn't working right anyway).  Apple won't let me download anymore the Pro Apps 2007-02 which will allow a 3.02 Compressor update.  this sucks, and apple thinks that I've already done this so their not allowing it."
,fran5116,2007-11-16T21:50Z,anybody know how to fool the computer into downloading Compressor 3.02 ?  I have 3.0 and it won't update.

I went under ""software update"" and it doesn't show anything for FCS, and i went to apple's site, and it wants me to register my serial before downloading...can someone help me out? Thank you!"

HELP!!!!"
,dreamspy,2007-12-02T02:17Z,"I cant seem to get the serial to work.  The installer always says that the serial is not working. I'we tried the serials people are suggesting here, and also all the serial in serialbox (the desember version).

This is actually a long story, but here it goes:
I installed FCS some time ago with the included serial, everything went fine.
About a week ago I installed Shake 4.1, which required me to update Pro Application Support. After that compressor stopped working.
I deleted FCS and tried to reinstall it, but I always get ""wrong serial"" in the installer.  Anyone know how to work around this? Or if I can find a serial somewhere that works?"
,zewkini,2008-01-05T05:12Z,"aconk - you saved me again with the latest studio updates.

,chemwz,2008-12-24T18:21Z,"I just downloaded FCS 2, but now I tried to do the software update.  I'm a bit new to this whole thing, and I tried to update via software update, but it did not show the update there. Then I tried to update via applies website but none of the serials worked.  Any ideas?"
