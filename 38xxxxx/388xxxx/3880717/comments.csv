[T],wormman,2007-11-10T14:53Z,"Perfect kef71, the only bad thing is that the superseeding don't work when there are two seeders, but that's ok.  I will help you seed as much I can if you upload the rest."
[T],kef71,2007-11-10T16:44Z,"Yeah, super-seeding won't work very well but it doesn't matter as you say. Question, what do you mean by if I upload the rest? Are you talking about this or the other season(s)?"
[T],wormman,2007-11-10T18:14Z,I mean the other seasons of TNG & Voyager .  I don't have them my self but I will help seeding them the best I can.
