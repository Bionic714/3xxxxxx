,cobrakaimma,2008-01-22T11:17Z,I really appreciate this torrent because it's got a piece of something I have been looking for forever. Anyway you could put up the 05-21-2005 show from atlanta or if not maybe send it to me directly. My email is cobrakaimma at yahoo.com Been looking for this forever so any help you could give even if it's just a source would be amazing.
,cbeach54,2008-01-23T02:25Z,awesome collection! makes me wish I could have been at some of these shows. anyone know if there is anything else from either of the brussels shows? 
,spitpaul,2008-02-09T18:24Z,"this is a great compilation BUT i had real trouble burning this because when you loaded the tracks on nero they came up to large meaning you could not even burn 1 track,so i had a thought and tried different things and finaly found that if you put the tracks into FLAC FRONTEND change them to WAV files then turn the WAV files using FLAC FRONTEND again and changed them back to FLAC files again then loaded them into nero again they came up alright. So dude i dont know what you did or if you've tried to burn this yourself,did you intend it for DVD only????. The tracks flow nicely into each other once burnt so credit to you for spending time and effort putting this together just could have done with some burning tips,but other than sorting this ive learnt how to use FLAC FRONTEND.

Any easy ways of converting to mp3 etc?"
,jungleboogie,2008-04-23T07:11Z,"Because FLAC is best. 

Thanks for this Mr. Poster. Your efforts are much appreciated."
,RM_Vee,2008-08-09T02:15Z,Can't get .flac to play on VLC...it just says program won't work. I wonder why...any thoughts?
,riggorick51984,2008-10-05T15:12Z,"Thanks a lot for this torrent. I can't remember what was said at the 3/9/06 show (labelled Trent Speaks). I was there, and can't remember.  Definitely looking forward to this whole collection.

cbeach54 - if you check this, the brussels whole show is here http://www.ninlive.com/03-19-2007.htm
