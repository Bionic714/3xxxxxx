,Pug_Fugly,2008-08-17T09:29Z,"In a lot of ways this is bullshit. If you want to know the full story, search for the Disclosure Project, 2001 National Press Conference and watch ""Out of the Blue"", SciFi channel documentary.

The assertion, taking the form of extreme environmentalist/doomsdayist propaganda, is that the the US Military, in joint ventures with various ""aerospace contracting arrangements"", has already developed anti-gravity and zero-point propulsion systems, as well as massively over-unity electric power generation cells (stop me if i'm going too fast). Further, he asserts that this technology has existed for at least fifty(50) years, and has been withheld deliberately from the American public as well as the world by a ""quasi-government"" agency or agencies within the American military-industrial infrastructure.

Pretty crazy shit, and without a shred of physical evidence other than hearsay/testimonial evidence (over 120 hours apparently) from government insiders and former top-secret government officials. Seems strange that this whole story hasn't even gotten any real news coverage... omg conspiracy!

EDIT: James Fox is the man who put together Out of the Blue. Seems like a cool, down-to-earth guy, just talking about some of the stories he was told in the process of interviewing. Also, look up Philip J. Corso if you're still interested. I'm kinda burned out from all this shit."

Bad Quality movies with a lot of spam.

It wont let your hunger for knowledge be satisfyed, instead search for the ""Disclosure Project, 2001 National Press Conference""
