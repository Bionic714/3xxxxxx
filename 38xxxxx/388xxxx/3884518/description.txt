Please support the Osmond Family by buying their Cd\\\'s, Dvd\\\'s & Memorabilia. This is my first Torrent ever. If everything goes well and it gets seeded fine. I can work on uploading one of my other Osmond Discographies (Donny Osmond-17cd, Marie Osmond-12cd, Osmond Bros-29cd, etc. I have all these in mp3 format, along with many from Jay, Jimmy, Merrill etc). So I can keep them coming as long as they get seeded on the network). Again..I can\\\'t stress enough..please support the Osmonds by purchasing all their stuff, it\\\'s the only way we can hope to have them continue to make so much for us available.

For now, It\\\'s going to be 7 Albums of D&M.
