,osmondmania,2007-11-11T23:31Z,"Anyone have any suggestions? This is my first Torrent and I'd like to share these earlier Donny and Marie Albums, I personally ripped myself as I hadn't seen previousily available when I've looked for them before...

I can upload/download torrents fine. Is there anything I have to do different if I am the intial one seeding? "
,osmondmania,2007-11-11T23:34Z,Oh..and if it makes any difference. I'm using Utorrent to seed...
,osmondmania,2007-11-11T23:39Z,"Ok..Looks like it's working fine..It just took a few minutes to connect with some of you. It's uploading fine to a few of you now.. 

Cool! Enjoy them.. I've been a fan since I watched their show as a kid in the late '70s"
,workjobb,2007-11-12T22:33Z,"Thank you very much for these hard to find albums.  If you have more, keep them coming please!"
,osmondlover,2007-11-12T22:35Z,"Hello Osmondmania, Thank you for the music!!! I've searched for them everywhere and boy was I happy when I saw your upload!! THANKS. Ibuy a whole lot of their dvd and CD's ! They make me feel so good."
,osmondmania,2007-11-13T01:29Z,"Your welcome and sure I can upload some more.

But I do have to say..Where are all the seeders? It's already been downloaded ALOT of times already in just a couple days. Did some of you just download and run away or what? How can I get more out there, if this one doesn't get more people helping me share it?

To those sticking around helping me get this out to everyone. THANKS. It's for you people I plan on sharing alot more.

I'll type up a list of all I have in mp3 format later on tonight and post it here for those that are curious to see what's coming.

I figured since they most likely won't re-issue these older 70's albums on cds, I'd do what I could. I'm obviousily a big Osmond fan..that's why I have so many of their older LP's to do this with. 

So..I hope again..that you all listen to these oldies but goodies..and remember..this is to ""promote"" the osmonds..to get them more out in the public.. so enjoy listening to these and continue to buy the new stuff, please!"
,osmondmania,2007-11-13T02:22Z,"Here's the list of all the complete Albums I have in MP3 Format in my computer. As you can see, I don't have all the older ones, I'm missing some but hopefully, I plan on sharing what I do have in various parts.

,Fire_Woman,2007-11-15T11:54Z,"Ok Ok Ok, lets all settle down here. LMAO
Alrighty now, I am in heavennnnnn. And all I can say is ""BRING EM ALL ON"". I have all of these items on vinyl and no way to convert them to .mp3. So, this is wicked cool. All except for the rare to finds. But, that is all good. I AM IN OSMOND HEAVEN. After them reconnecting with me via YOU TUBE, MYSPACE, OPRAH, and DANCING WITH THE STARS. OMG. I think it is my birthday again. *giggles*. I am a Jimmy freak myself but, love all of them equally. PLEASE send more. You are doing a great job here already. I give you two thumbs up with 5 stars and all sorts of bells and whistles. Got my vote. At any rate, this little treat is worth seeding FOREVER. ok? Does that help? This is almost done on my end anyway. THANK YOU A MILLION. :)

BTW, seen that movie ""Goin' Coconuts"" when it was out WAYYYYYY back then? omg. Too cool. I love that album. :)
"
,osmondmania,2007-11-15T15:23Z,"Thanks Fire Woman...

Yeah..I've been steadily checking it out and I see usually between 10-20 seeders. That's great!

That means I feel confident I can work on uploading the next part this weekend if everything goes well..and leave all of you to help keep this one alive...

I wasn't so much trying to over-react or sound too demanding about that..believe me..lol..

It's just that I really..really..dislike a torrent going ""dead""... It's happened to alot of us I'm sure. You look up something real cool, go to download it, and just there isn't anyone there to help you out and give it to you..

So..anyways..THANKS for doing your part to support keeping it ""alive"" and look up Osmond this weekend. I hope you will be happy with the next ""part"" of my Osmond discography. I have so many...I have to upload this in a few parts...I plan on making..a torrent for each individual member of the family...Including Jimmy (I see you're a fan :D ) "
,osmondmania,2007-11-15T15:31Z,"P.S.  I started with Donny and Marie, because they are my favorites...like you with Jimmy.

I like 'all"" the Osmonds music, of course. But there is just something that when Donny and Marie sing together..that is really cool and yeah..I've been catching all the Osmonds stuff on Oprah, Dancing with the Stars etc. Even have to admit to watching those tabloid shows like Insider and ET that I usually don't watch..just to see Donny's coverage of 'lil sis on that Dancing show."
,Fire_Woman,2007-11-15T18:42Z,"Picture this. Having a Vinyl collection and have no way of listening to those vinyls. I would give you hugs and kisses right now if I could. Subtle subliminal messages of what to upload next ""THINK JIMMY"". *snorts* I am listening to ""New Season"" and singing with it. I still remember the words. lmao
I don't know how you managed to pull this off but, I am grateful to you. I am STILL an Osmond fan. The only show of the Donny and Marie Show that I missed was the one that I was dragged kicking and screaming to go see the Osmonds in concert. Damn, that rocked. The memories. If you all are interested. I am searching for the Oprah that they were on. And searching for the Larry King show. All I know is that I WANT THEIR SMILE.... grrrr. People when I was a teen (when I was not bleaching my hair) would say that me and my sister look like we were Osmond related. *SNORTS*. I wished. She was like a much needed possitive big sister. I could feel like doggy  dog and if I have them playing or whatnot, I feel so much better. Also, I am sick as a dog right now and THANK YOU for all this. And yea, I will be keeping an eye out for ALL your Osmond treats. BTW, anyone interested, my son (16) is a fan and been that way all his life. LMAO OOOOO If you have any Osmond 2 Generation. That would just put this collection to full circle. 
LMAO, I am now hearing the vinyl quality with ""Which Way You Goin' Billy"". SWEET. I love it. I am glad I have someone now to talk OSMOND with. "
,osmondmania,2007-11-15T20:24Z,"Yeah. New Season is actually my favorite overall LP of theirs, though my single favorite song to listen to is ""True Love"" off their ""I""m leaving it all up to you"" LP. 

Not to worry for those Larry King, Oprah 50th Reunion things. I have those capped directly to my computer in dvd quality. Someday I'll get those uploaded if no one else does it first (hint.hint.to other osmond fans.lol)

Yeah, how I got these, I admit. They are alot of work to do, but it's worth it. Because I put all these to mp3 so I could make my own compilation cds to listen to. You know..a couple from here..couple from there..etc etc. then fix up a real nice cd of MY personal favorites.

I had to get a kinda expensive high quality record player with audio outputs, cable that up to my computer, clean the LP's with special stuff, play and record them in waves (stopping and starting every single song), clean up the hisses and pops with a special program once the files are in the computer) as much as I could (you get these no matter how clean the LP, I think), convert them to mp3 (both to take up less space on the computer, and make them easier to share), making sure to keep track and type out correctly all the song names, what LP they came from etc etc..

Well..not trying to discourage you..LOL..just be prepared..to spend HOURS..if you really want to get a good job, taking vinyl and putting them into computer files to listen/share and depending on how many LP's you got to do...

Actually, I'm hoping these leads some other fans to help out and encode what they got...I""m missing a couple here and there.. :D

But..yeah..your welcome. I am sorry to hear you aren't feeling well but AM happy to hear these brought a smile to face listening to them... I figured most likely alot of us do have alot of their LP's..but what I did see, was no one was really sharing much in the way of Osmonds things in torrents...and thus..why I wanted to share some of my collection...

As long as people keep buying the new stuff, I personally don't see any problem sharing the older LP's here, if anything..it might help to generate more interest in them..

p.s. Thanks for the hugs and kisses comment. I'm a guy..so that's cool with me! and of course you have a new friend to talk Osmonds with. I""ve been a fan since the 70's. :D"
,Fire_Woman,2007-11-15T21:45Z,"Where are you located? I am in the US. Been a HUGE fan from birth. That would be in the late 60s. Erm, shy of 40 to be exact. *giggles*. At any rate. You are a guy and an Osmond fan. ACES, CUDOS, TWO THUMBS UP, and erm. YAYYYYYY *giggles* So, like if I were to scream JIMMY in your ear this would not bother you right? o.O

*SNORTS*"
,osmondmania,2007-11-15T23:41Z,"Well. I guess this area is for comments, so that's cool carrying on a chat. LOL...

We actually have alot in common. I was born in the '60s as well. Been a fan along time (though I can't say a fan since birth :D ). Living in the USA, too. Born on the east coast (maine) and moved myself to the west coast some years ago (california).

Let's see, how would I react if you yelled ""JIMMY"" in my ear? Well, I""d probably just smile and go with the flow..you know..Who knows exactly?, Maybe I'd turn around and yell ""MARIE"" in your ear at the same time. After all, she's looking pretty Hot in those Dancing with the Stars shows, if I do say so myself. I don't think I am underestimating just how good she really looks, these days. :D and from what I hear, she's single again.  

So, yeah..for sure..wouldn't bother me a bit if you did that. I am an Osmond fan. 

As a matter of fact, if you want to know, after I read you were a Jimmy fan, I listened to his three full mp3 LPs I have (Little Jimmy, Killer Joe and Hugo the Hippo with Marie) to make sure they would sound good for you when you got them. I do have some other Live Jimmy stuff I didn't list that might be interesting for you to check out...."
,Fire_Woman,2007-11-16T09:31Z,"o.O
Ok, I put in my order of one Jimmy Osmond and may want to put the other brothers in there as well. Their individual albums. Then lets work on ""The Osmond"" "

I'm assuming that's me and Firewoman because I know she's doing her best to help me seed these:

C'mon guys/gals.. can't you do better than that? I'm getting a little discouraged about posting more. :("
,tvane58,2007-11-18T03:39Z,"Don't get discouraged. I'm using utorrent and it shows more info than piratebay. I'm showing 17 seeders at this time and I would dearly love to get the Osmond Brother's Albums. I was lucky to see them in 1973 at the New York State Fair.
I have a very generous internet provider, and I will keep my upload going forever to be able to finally hear those great albums again!! They are very hard to find. Thank You so much for your effort. I Know how much work it is to seed rare albums. I have also offered some hard to find gems in my collection over the years, and you deserve a great big hug & kiss for your time and effort. Love, tvane58."
,osmondmania,2007-11-18T16:31Z,"Thanks tvane58 for taking the time to write. Yeah, you're right, in ""Utorrent"" d&m are showing 16-17 seeders and jimmy 5 seeders. I'm going to post the next part of my Osmond collection in a few hours as soon as I finish typing out the track listing to give this another try. Thanks so much for the hugs & kisses, between you and firewoman, I definitely feel the appreciation. having an online hug every once in a while is great and shows me alot, thanks especially to the Osmonds for making these classics that are cool to listen to still every once in a while when the mood strikes us! and lastly for now, THANKS for your help getting these out to other fans. WOW. you saw them back in '73 that must have been great. I have only seen them live in Branson one time while driving back to ME to visit family I have there. Must have been quite a concert!"
