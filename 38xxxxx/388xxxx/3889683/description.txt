I've had some problems uploading for a while and had to repair XP. IE6 got corrupted and I can't re-install it, so here is something I found which I thought I must share: Multiple IE Setup. It installs Internet Explorer versions 6, 5.5, 5.01, 4.01  and even version 3!!! They all work on my computer, althought IE3 is weird, never seen that before LOL
