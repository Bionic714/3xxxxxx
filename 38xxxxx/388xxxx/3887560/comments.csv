,mgmleo,2007-11-14T00:01Z,Is this the 4:3 panned and scanned version that's been going round or is it the original aspect ratio?
,FiddleGoose,2007-11-14T09:11Z,"I ripped this myself, everything is original."
,FiddleGoose,2007-11-14T09:15Z,The DVD wasn't widescreen in the first place so it doesn't really matter.
,eldorado303,2009-04-16T14:51Z,"hey dude this is the original,

and its freakin awesome, fiddle, 

if you can rip a bigger size, 1.4 g's

that'd be awesome, dance scenes with better

quality and stuff.

 i saw bye bye birdie last 

night and its a blast. dude, the part where the 

turtle runs... Ah Ah!!!

well, take care."
,eldorado303,2009-04-16T14:51Z,"and the movie even has hints of psychedelic 

era... its really freaky"

,ConcernedCitizen23,2010-07-18T17:32Z,"FiddleGoose no offense man, but you messed up the video stream. you shoud have used Forced Film to convert 29.97->23.976 instead of deinterlacing. so video stutters. learn to use dgindex/megui and make a proper rip."
,enonumus,2012-02-21T11:14Z,"mgmleo's question was perfectly legitimate.  There IS a widescreen copy of this movie, I HAVE IT.  The DVD they released may have been full screen, since that was still the target resolution for most DVDs until the the turn of the millennium, but it's been broadcast on TV in its original widescreen format.  It was probably recorded from TCM, but I haven't noticed any logos burned into it.  And no, my copy is not simply a cropped version of the full screen movie, it's obvious when you watch it, and the full Columbia logo is there at the beginning.  "
