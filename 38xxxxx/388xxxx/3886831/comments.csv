,drjones_,2010-06-01T07:45Z,When I try to download this torrent I get a red downloading icon rather that a blue downloading icon. I've searched this site & have not been able to find out what the red icon means... Can someone help me figure this out please? aXXo torrents are excellent but the red icon seems rather ominous... off-putting at best.
