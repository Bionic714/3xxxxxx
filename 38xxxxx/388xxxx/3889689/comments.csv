,Rubba_Duck,2008-08-20T16:26Z,"Very nice torrent. 
Contains the full game already unpacked (no silly CD image and messing around with an installer)
AND patched in English. (th07e.exe)

What more could you ask for?"
,dagger2,2008-09-24T21:19Z,Something to make it easier ;)
,Drebin_777,2008-10-04T00:13Z,Could any one seed if its not to much trouble?
,Drebin_777,2008-10-04T03:45Z,"I will seed this for a week just encase anyone wants it,its a really good game"
,TheBeast2000,2009-04-15T00:42Z,Ill seed this for as long as i can but i get lag on some of my games when i seed but since im finaly getting the full game of this i dont think that will be a problem
,savageb,2011-05-20T18:25Z,The sound doesn't work on this one either! You can't play Touhou without music!
