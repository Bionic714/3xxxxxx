NO VIRUS 100% SURE!

NOD32"
,bentrader,2007-11-30T07:02Z,"wonderful, this is the one with COMPLETE steps of fix, cracking the client side AND import the registry file to have client connect to EVAL servers, versus a few other torrents that only cracks the client side.

In case the fix.bat did not import the registry file properly, (experienced it), just double click the TrialToRetail.reg registry file, and accept it into computer, restart,  that shall be it.  (go to advanced update setup, shall see drop-down menu  with all eval servers.) 

This is the real fix for V3. well done job. Thanks OnlyShare!

,bentrader,2007-11-30T09:59Z,"Some folks had problem making it work. Clarify again, this is a great working fix. Only glitch is the Fix.bat in some case failed to import the registry entry in TrialtoRetail.reg file, as my XP and Vista case.    Here is the deal:
1. install, param later;
2. run fix.bat; it will restart;
3. once up, locate the extracted or still in zip file TrialtoRetail.reg, double click, accept to import into registry; (now, if go to advanced update setup, shall see update server drop-down menu with all EVAL servers, with successful TrialtoRetail.reg import; otherwise, empty) It will connect to EVAL servers, and user/pass won't get baqnned on server.
4. do first time database update, will prompt for user/pass, pick any one in Serial.txt under iSerial folder. will be able to update, and since on. 
That's it; show appreciation to uploader."
,christpuncherx,2007-12-03T10:29Z,"well i dont want to be one that that screams virus when im not possitive since there is  32 seeders and no bad comments. 

but i just installed this program when when it got to to the actual file install part of the installation my systems started to freeze up with every program i tryed to click on. so i restarted and when i put in my admin passord to enter windows it would freeze again. had to reformat/reinstall win xp. havnt installed any other suspicious  programs so its a fair bet that this one did it to me"
,bentrader,2007-12-03T11:07Z,"any current AV shall be remvoed first. And, after step 3, don't forget to run the NOD32 FIX.exe under Fix2 folder."
,Jobbin,2007-12-06T17:20Z,This doesnt seem to work anymore. None of the serials work for me anymore. 
,Amazon62,2008-05-25T11:30Z,"Listen everybody! Al those fixes and passwords for NOD32 V3 work. BUT, after a few weeks they will expire anyway.... Yes, it's keep saying 'will expire in 2050' or something, but that's just a text the fix put in. If you want a good NOD32, just download a earlier version.

So pictures don't prove shit!"
