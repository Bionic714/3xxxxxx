The files are alternating between partial, jittery or simply nothing at all"
,dizstruxion,2007-11-24T14:40Z,"this torrent is fine and so are the files i ripped them myself..if someone else has snagged them from me then somehow corrupted them that sucks and im sorry,but the files i am hosting are in perfect working order so i guess i'll seed again eh."
,dizstruxion,2007-11-24T15:11Z,"ok tracks 3,4 & 5 were nothing im sorry and don't know how this happened...i'll rip it again later on and make sure its all good next time..ive checked my other torrents and they are cool."
