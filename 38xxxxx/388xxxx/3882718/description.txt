Great movie with Ray Liotta, Jolene Blalock (she is a babe, hot Topol from Star Treck), LL Cool J, Wayne Beach. A district attorney (Ray Liotta) is involved in a 24-hour showdown with a gang leader (LL Cool J) and is, at the same time, being manipulated by an attractive assistant district attorney (Jolene Blalock) and a cryptic stranger.
