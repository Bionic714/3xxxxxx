Jamie King ROCKS!!!

They use ""leaked"" & ""stolen"" like this was some pre-release hacked and ripped off some executives computer."
,Josh4721,2007-11-17T02:31Z,video 4/10 audio 9/10.  I'm 15 minutes in and its very poorly cammed. My advice listen don't watch. But thanks for the up.
,CsmcDem,2007-11-17T22:40Z,"""NOVEMBER 2007. THIS TIME IT'S HISTORICAL.""

,RiTarDid,2007-11-29T16:08Z,"Cant' think of a better way to steal this film than a cam....d/loading it just to say "" i stole 'steal this film'"" lol...."
,meowing,2007-12-01T00:24Z,"OK, it's december now. Either change the damn announcement on your website (which still says it will be there in november), or release it already!"
,pike2k,2007-12-01T22:33Z,"I agree with meowing, it's late, and no announcements to indicate why.

very frustrating

League of Noble Peers, please communicate what's going on!"
,segaGman,2007-12-13T13:09Z,"   Was the Original that this was CAMed delated and this is the release......? the original release? Is that what they meen buy stating ""THIS TIME IT'S HISTORICAL.""?   
   Most of the better cams i have seen never move up and down for as long(about 40 sec) as i seen in this so is this a part of the movie CAMed as a statement as the guy said ""once downed it will alway be there down,down,down no up.
   Torrent for thought."
