,pianomanJM,2008-05-12T05:27Z,can you download only 1 season from this set? or do you have to download all of it?
,lexum,2008-05-28T18:38Z,"I'm downloading now, your seeding is ok, but if you guys seed much, I will keep seeding. And I seed good! 2mb up;o)"
,lexum,2008-05-29T00:09Z,"Okay, it doesn't seem like anyone's seeding much, so I have reduced the uploading speed until someone starts seeding MUCh more! Sorry.. So if you sede much, I seed much! It's simple :D"

,JZMKLZ,2008-06-19T17:25Z,"I was glad, and surprised, to find this torrent. I have all sorts of errors trying to burn the episodes to DVD however. Seems like a bad idea to seed any except the 3 episodes that are uncorrupted from S1. Go ahead and flame noob at me I know I must be doing something wrong but I'll seed it since y'all are beggin'"

I finally got it downloaded and have watched all of season 1 with no problem, but seasons 2-7 won't play...I keep getting an error message with WMP...is there any other player that I can download that will play them or anything else that I can do? My kids were really getting into this and were so disappointed that the other seasons won't play :("

Try to play it with VLC Media Player"
,KGN-004,2011-09-07T04:20Z,"Bad, bad quality. Nowadays you can find DVD rips of all the episodes which look better and have smaller file sizes."
,Sr.Oromis,2011-09-09T23:07Z,westlock just so u know season #1 ep #2 there is no sound other then that its a great upload!
,LokReaver,2012-01-06T07:41Z,"Quality is utterly terrible.  Resolution ranges from tiny to mediocre (with the video quality ranging along with it), audio repeatedly desyncs.  I was happy to find a torrent of this show with a decent number of seeders, but I'm disappointed to see it's such a bad one. "
,jakejerk,2012-02-28T02:25Z,Ppl please seed!
