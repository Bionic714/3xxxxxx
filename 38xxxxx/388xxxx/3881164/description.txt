This is an edited version of the uncut "Semantic Blockage" file from Skunk Records that has been floating around for a while. The file is edited mostly in terms of the arrangement rather than the content. I split things into individual tracks, gave the album a two part structure with an "intermission," and reordered things to give the tracks a sense of flow. Now it plays more like a spoken word album instead of a random bunch of recordings. I also trimmed a few bits and added some seconds of silence here and there. Raleigh purists may disagree, but I think this is much more
enjoyable to listen to from beginning to end than "Semantic Blockage".

Enjoy!
