1) Insert the CD into your CD Drive.
Note: If a page shows up stating that you need Acrobat 4.0 or better, and you have it already installed, then ignore the message and close that window.

2) Double-click on the ""My Computer"" icon.

3) Right-click on the CD Drive Icon that is running the STAR Class CD and select the ""Open"" option.

4) Double-click on the ""Program"" folder.

5) Double-click on ""welcome.htm"" or ""opening.htm"" and the STAR Classic program will run shortly"
