| PCLinuxOS, often abbreviated as PCLOS, |:
| is a desktop Linux distribution. It is |:
| a free operating system for personal   |:
| computers aimed at ease of use.        |:
|                                        |:
| PCLinuxOS is distributed as a LiveCD,  |:
| which can also be installed to a local |:
| hard disk drive. When used as a LiveCD,|:
| it can work with a USB flash drive,    |:
| where the user\\\'s configuration and     |:
| personal data are saved. Once locally  |:
| installed on a PC\\\'s hard drive, the    |:
| user of PCLinuxOS can add, remove or   |:
| update packages by utilising the       |:
| Advanced Packaging Tool (or APT), a    |:
| package management system (originally  |:
| from the Debian distribution),         |:
| together with Synaptic Package         |:
| Manager, a GUI frontend to APT.        |:
