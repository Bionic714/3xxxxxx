,theaceoffire,2007-12-16T04:23Z,"*aXXo-torrents is not aXXo, but he is uploading aXXo movies as far as I can tell.

God speed aXXo, hope you feel like coming back some day."
,Devils_Reject,2007-12-25T04:00Z,I downloaded the aXXo original many moons ago. This movie was great. I must have watched it 15 to 20 times and all my friends liked it too. Basically they tell Mark Whalberg he is planning an assassination on the President so they can prevent it. Then they frame him for the assassination. Then Mark tracks down the ppl behind the assassination while being hunted by the FBI.
,mydyingbrides,2007-12-30T12:35Z,"Terrible quality, has alot green/distorted lines through the left side of the screen when using VLC player.

Great quality when using the Windows media player, strangely enough. 

So if you encounter this issue, try another media player."

Just thought i'd pass that along since it's a first for me.  I'm just glad they went through Comcast instead of giving me some ridiculous thousand-dollar fine."

,Fenix_OP,2008-04-07T18:19Z,"@ berre451

you need the codecs required to play the movie.
Such as when you dl a movie with ""AC3"" in the title. It is telling you that you need to get the AC3 filter.
Here, you need to get Xvid. It's easy to find.

jolly good"
