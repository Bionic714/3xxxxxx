After breaking up with her boyfriend Mitch, Kim can?t think of anything she?d rather do than get together with her friends for wild night of partying in an abandoned building. Unfortunately for her, Mitch hasn?t taken the split-up well, and appears to be prepared to do just about anything to make their love whole again. Gripped by murderous fury, he?s out to find Kim and put an end to the fun. Matters take a twisted turn, though, when the mayhem in the material world shatters the slumber of specters who share Mitch?s bloodthirst.
