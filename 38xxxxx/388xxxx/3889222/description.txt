 What Have You Done With My Body God? -- The ZTT Sessions 1983 to 1985 (4CD set)

An amazing companion to the best-known work of Art Of Noise -- a 4CD package that features 41 previously unreleased tracks, remixes, and demos from the archives of ZTT Records -- plus an additional 15 tracks that have already appeared before! The set captures the group at their best -- a time when they were still working with Trevor Horn, and managing to come up with creatively funky and sonically mindblowing numbers that fused hip hop production, electronics, and some of the chunkier pop work that Horn had been doing with bigger groups at the time. The book-like package features 36 pages of notes on the work, with track by track commentary from all original group members -- and the 56 tracks include "Once Upon A Lime", "War (demo 2)", "Confession", "Who's Afraid Of Scale", "Moments In Love (12" b side idea)", "Tears Out Of A Stone", "Samba #2", "Fairlight In The Being", "The Chain Of Chance", "Close (To Being Compiled)", "Focus Of Satisfaction", "It Stopped", "The Uncertainty Of Syrup", "The Long Hello", "The Vacuum Divine", "Goodbye Art Of Noise", "The Army Now", "That Was Close", "Love Beat", and "A Time To Hear (Who's Listening)".
