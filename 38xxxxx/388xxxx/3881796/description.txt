This is Latvian feature film, our version about Emil i LÃ¶nneberga, called "Emil's Pranks". It was made back in 1985, when Latvia was still part of the USSR, however, it is shot in Western Latvia, using only Latvian cast. 
This is a TV rip, and I should stress - it does not have the best of quality, not for this day and age. The film has never been remastered, nor will it ever be released commercially. More info in enclosed txt file. If you're worried about the quality, I included small sample (WITHOUT subtitles). That should also give some idea about the film's flow itself.

The film is in original - LATVIAN language (NOT English), and I have included ENGLISH subtitles. I have translated the text myself - since I've been working as translator for more than a decade, I believe the translation to be at least adequate.
