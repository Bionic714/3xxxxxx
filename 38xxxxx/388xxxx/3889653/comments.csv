Dude seriously appreciate your work but it would have been far better if this was not an rar but individual files.

Thanks Though."

,mrpresident2002,2011-01-24T05:33Z,"Just a note on sound and video consistency, many episodes have audio video timing errors prolly caused by bad encoding software or a sloooow computer, but not so off that it really has an effect on viewing. You can see and hear the encoding software trying to resync audio and frames throughout the rip. It's never quite back on time but keeps it from more than 1-2 seconds off and resyncs again. The video quality is very watchable 6/10, but in a couple episodes is barley ""smartphone"" quality. Overall audio quality is good and consistent. These are various rips put together as a compilation in 4x3 and 16x9 with double black bars sometimes. Def worth the download and even the worst of em are def watchable. Still a great up! Thanks! I'm sure I'm not the only one who would enjoy these is 5.1 and x264 or maybe dvd rips."
