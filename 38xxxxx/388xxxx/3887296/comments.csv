This reminds me of the no-script, no budget porn  movies I used to see back in the mid seventies, when I was an 18 year old virgin.  It was after ""Deep Throat"" had been made, but before it had completely changed the industry.  

Funny how things like cars, buildings, and phone booths  from the 60s and 70s only look authentically retro in super low budget porn and exploitation movies. 

This has a scene where a woman pour lighter fluid on a guy's stomach, sets him on fire for just a second, then puts it out.  Weird!  Also, while I didn't watch every single frame, I don't think there are any cum shots!  "
