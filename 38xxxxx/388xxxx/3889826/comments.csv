,ilive4harleys,2007-11-16T00:52Z,"Good music is good music. Does liking rap make me black or a criminal (I am kidding..don't freak out)? Does liking heavy metal make me young or a criminal (see I am an equal opportunity joker). Does liking Bach make me wealthy or Beethoven make me Shroeder? Good music is good music. However, your comment DOES make you a moron.  Thank you for the upload Sunn72."
,davenator,2007-11-18T05:00Z,"I`m downloading this for my mother....she likes this ""embarrassment to Canadians"", Celine Dion. I`ll tell you something....you couldn`t pay me to listen to this gay ass shit. You got it, scottie....this stuff is straight outta the horses ass! "
,davenator,2007-11-18T05:02Z,"ilive4harleys......you`re a gay guy, aren`t you?"

,wheelinarcher,2007-11-21T16:58Z,"I am 6'-4"" 295. I got three kids and a wife. am I gay because I enjoy talent? I suppose you prefer Vanilla Ice, if your even old enough to know who that is."
,WoWzorg,2007-11-24T04:16Z,"Well, Its like this... if you dont like celine... why bother leaving a comment here.. right?
I happen te love most of her music... and i'm glad MY friends accept me for that, while there listening hardcore of metal (i like metal to heavy metal even....) so anyway :D just leave a comment if its a positive one... or a warning on a virus or something... but not just to make yourself feel better by making others feel worse... Thanks Sunn72 for awsome upload!"
,GongStar,2007-11-30T11:07Z,"I doesn't matter if these kids go on here typing 'gay' cuz we all know they're just a bunch of youngster pussies who'd never dare to say anything like that in public. I've listened to balads openly and I went to see a Josh Groban concert and I have never heard anyone say anything yet and I doubt I ever will. These people only have the courage to say stupid things on the net. In real life they don't have the guts plus they unless their parents deserve to be screwed with a 10"" dildo they'd know it's wrong to go around cussing people on the streets. In other words, pussies. LOL"

,emzi82,2007-12-06T23:00Z,"I'm downloading this for myself and am not ashamed to believe Celine is a fantastic singer! Celine first gained international recognition in the 1980s and ended the decade as one of the most-successful artists in pop music. She has achieved worldwide success with several English and French albums, so for those of you who do not appriciate such an inspirational and dedicated singer who has gained so much before the age of forty I'm sure there is a Mcfly download on here somewhere."
,traasdahl,2007-12-16T02:46Z,"no matter what you say, Celine Dion has the rawest voice on earth. And thats from a guy who listens to rock/metal!"
,famouse,2008-01-07T23:28Z,"Im tired of this gay shit... your not gay ust because you listen celine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Im a girl but that doesnt matter. I love pop,rock, punk and heavy metal but i aslo like to lsiten celine. 

The asshole that writes this things about that everything about celine is gay must have a really messed up brain. its often the ppl that writes this kind of comments that are gays. if it were gay to sing or listen soft music then everysingle guy and girl would be gay and lesbians.

GET A GRIP OF LIFE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
