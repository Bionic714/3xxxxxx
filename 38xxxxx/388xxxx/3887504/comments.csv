,i_never_existed,2007-11-22T14:53Z,"So is this a PC game, or a mac OSX game... because the link seems to only mention pc."
,mxlx3,2007-11-24T06:47Z,"THis is a mac/pc CD. For some reason, the mac community never picked up on this - and it was never promoted as such. But it is actually a really good turn-based strategy game and a lot of fun. I've been playing it for about a year now. A lost treasure for mac gamers . . . ."
