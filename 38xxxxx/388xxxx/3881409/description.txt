Seizoen 1, Disc 1 van MTV's The Trip

Two teams have 21 days to travel across Western-Europe. One team starts in Gibraltar and has to end in the most northern point of Europe, Noordkapp. The other team goes the same way vice versa. The teams have to find out how to get there theirselves. They film everything and may not use any money, although they have 250 euros back-up. They may not travel more than 200 kilometers per day, to keep some excitement and sensation in the show
