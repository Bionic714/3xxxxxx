UPLOADER'S COMMENTS
This is my first upload at Pirate's Bay. Typically I upload tolarge kung fu community. But sinceis down for God knows how long, I am uploading here. Hopefully I can still cater to some kung fu fans. This is my FIRST EVER dvdrip converting to DVD Ultra format, which includes menus, ect. You have to create your own menus and I tried my best to make them halfway decent. I also included the trailers from the special features which only take up a few mins. I hope everyone enjoys this movie from the director of King Boxer aka Five Fingers of Death, I thought it was good. Any comments or constructive criticism is welcome!
