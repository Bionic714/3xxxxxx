,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-25T10:01Z,"priscnadia! I've missed you and your weekly uploads! I miss demonoid too! Oh well hopefully we can find a new home of the Fu. I hate how we can't send each other messages and such on this site. I'm just trying to take up the slack that is left from demonoid going down. Finally have started buying and building a collection of shaw classics. Trying to lil by lil upload them to the community. Nice to hear from you again, hopefully you see this since it's been soo long since you responded. I just decided to look at comments for my torrents and I saw you had sent one last month. SORRY :)"
,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-29T19:16Z,"As of December 29, 2007 I am no longer supporting this torrent. There are still seeders as of now and I hope some continue to stay with this torrent , but I must remove older uploads from my computer to make room for newer ones. Sorry and I hope you enjoyed this movie. I will upload it again someday in the future."
