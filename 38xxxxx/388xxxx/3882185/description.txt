No Talking, Just Head is an album by The Heads, a band composed of Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth, and Chris Frantz of Talking Heads, joined by a variety of guest singers. Its name may be seen as a joke relating to the common expression "giving head" as a synonym for performing fellatio, as well as a more obvious reference to the fact that Talking Heads' former mouthpiece,  )-: David Byrne, is not present. :-(       " Article by : Wikipedia " *********************************************************************************
