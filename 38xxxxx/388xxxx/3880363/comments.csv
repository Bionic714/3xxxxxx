,foolonthehill,2007-11-12T18:21Z,"Some discs are for Windows and others, the hip disc certainly, is Mac...

System requirements for running Interactive Hip

The minimum computer specification required for running Interactive Hip  is as follows:

A Power Macintosh 6100 computer or above, that supports a 800 x 600 screen display and thousands or millions of colors, 20Mb RAM (32+ Mb recommended), a double-speed or faster CD-ROM drive, and System 7.1 or later. QuicktimeÂŞ with MPEG installed.

Interactive Hip is not designed for 256 colour displays, and runs only on Power Macs."

The emulations really only have to be turned on once you're ready to run the program but easier to do it all at once.  I installed with no problem and tried to run and got the Insert Correct CD error.  Turned the emulations on and good to go.

,paul.nightday,2009-02-27T20:57Z,"All 9 cds are working for me on WinXP.
As other users already said,the steps were:
- convert the uif files to iso (I did it with poweriso)
- mount them with daemon tools
- install
- in some cases there were problems, which were solved with
the modification of the .ini files DataPath= ... line. I think
this is the appsetup.txt error others mentioned. You should
write here the letter of the virtual drive of the iso (maybe
it should be identical to the one you installed from). And once
I had to give the path of a file explicitly after launching the
program.

The launching is a bit tricky, after I mount the proper disk,
the softwear starts automatically.

I use the daemon tools with two virtual drives and sometimes I had
to mount the image on both of them to make it work.

So it is tricky but usable under WinXP.

,holler1,2009-07-19T18:05Z,"OK, for any windows user that are having problems with the conversion process, I may have the solution to which I will explain in a dummy proof fashion. 

1. You must use download and install ""Daemon Tools 3.47"". That's right 3.47 and here is the link: http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/236/
For some reason later versions of this tool do not have the ""Emulation"" option, which may be the missing link in the conversion process. After installing this tool, right-click on the icon within the task, go to ""EMULATIONS"" and select  ""All Options On"".

2. Download ""Magic ISO"" and install it. You must download a full torrent of this tool with registration!

3. Open Magic ISO, click on the ""TOOLS"" tab, and select ""CONVERT"". Now in the ""Choose Source File"" box, navigate to one of the ""UIF"" files and selct it. Now keep the standard IFO box the way it is. Next step is all done within the output box. ""Choose Output File"" box, click on the diskette icon and create a folder on the desktop, open the folder and in the ""File Name"" box give it the same name as the folder and save it. Next, just click ""Convert""

4. When the Conversion is complete, Click on the Tools tab and select ""Burn CD/DVD with ISO"". When that pop opens, within the ""CD/DVD Image File"" box - Select the ISO you have just converted and burn it to a disc!

5. After the burning process is done, you CD/DVD drive will open. Close Magic ISO completed and load the disc. When it opens just install it like any other software. When the installation is complete, select run program and bingo bango. 

DO NOT, DON'T, NEVER DELETE THE INSTALLATION FILES THAT THE DISC CREATED ON YOUR HARD DRIVE. WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM, JUST EJECT THE DISC AND SAVE IT FOR WHEN YOU NEED TO USE IT. REPEAT THE PROCESS FOR ALL ""UIF"" FILES.

For vista users SORRY, I don't know!"

PLEASE :'((((((((("
,wazzuup,2009-12-30T20:42Z,"Hi everyone I really needed this cds to work on Vista so I got a Way using virtual pc 2007 with  WIndows XP virtual Machine. Inside Windows XP I put Daemon tools lite (with all emulations enabled) and transferred the .iso files of the 9 CDs to the virtual machine. I can run them there.

HOW TO PUT THIS 9 CD's WORKING ON WINDOWS VISTA: 


You'll need:

*Virtual PC 2007 (it's free and from microsoft - you cand download it at microsoft's site)
*Windows XP installation CD (you can grab a torrent of this)
*All 9 Cd's of this torrent in .iso file.
*Daemon tools lite (I used this one but others may work).

1 - create a Windows XP virtual Machine using virtual pc 2007 in you windows vista pc. Be sure to put some RAM into it and have some disk space.

2 - When running Windows XP, click on the ""action"" tab of virtual pc 's window  and click install or update virtual machine additions - this will make the virtual machine much smoother.

3 - Drag and drop the iso files from Vista to the Windows Xp machine.

4 - Install Daemon Tools lite, go to preferences and be sure to put all emulations (may be on the advenced tab, it is SecuROM LaserROm etc.. ) active, otherwise some cds won't work.

5 - Load the .iso image files into daemon tools and install. Try to run the cd..

I had to unninstal the VMachine Additions to get them to work, I was getting a error ""please unload debugger"" - after some research I found it was because of the ""virtual"" environment so I unnistalled Vmachine additions and run the CDs then it worked perfectly. I installed Vmachine additions and now the CD's worked, more smoothly. 

I know my english is not perfect but I think you may understand, otherwise post your questions. 

*** To install the virtual machine you can check this site: 
http://lifehacker.com/238071/geek-to-live--run-windows-xp-inside-vista-with-virtual-pc

is is pretty easy and won't harm the computer.

I hope its helpful. If you can get it to work please comment here so other people put it working too.

Also, a thank you would be appreciated ;)
Happy new year! "
,pouchie,2010-01-02T07:01Z,"Thnx for the info wazzuup. 

But when I try to start one of the programs with daemon tools in Virtual PC 2007 using winxp pro 2002 sp2, it says ""A debugger has been detected: unload the debugger and try again"""
,pouchie,2010-01-02T07:02Z,any ideas?
,wazzuup,2010-01-17T00:10Z,"Hi pouchie I had the same problem at first. I think I bypass it trough:
1: unninstall vmachine additions then try to run the CD's.
2: restart pc and virtualpc2007
3: install vmadditions and try again to see if it works.

- if you can't do it try changing vmachine additions configurations, .. I don't have the laptop with me now so I can't precise the exact information...
But I can guarantee all CDs work fine on vista, altough I had that very same error about the debugger, at first.

I hope it helps you!"

,maverick_jones,2010-05-14T02:22Z,Will this work on Windows 7 x64? 
,surveyguy84,2010-05-16T10:26Z,"Tested on windows 7 64 bit. .daa blows, so I converted the cds to .iso easily. When I mount them, they install correctly, but give ""Access violation at address 00000000. Read of address 00000000."" Also ""Runtime error 216 at 00002FA4"". I cannot see any way to modify anything about the discs to make them work on my system."
,thedon89,2010-06-08T04:08Z,"if you are still having problems:

just to be clear,

- you will not be able to run 6 out of 8 of these files on vista or windows 7 (2 of them have a different program install process that is compatible w/windows 7).
- you cannot run them as .uif files, you must convert them to ISO (through magiciso, something registered as trial versions will limit you to 300 megabyte conversion) 

-You must use download and install ""Daemon Tools 3.47"". http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/236/
(For some reason later versions of this tool do not have the ""Emulation"" option, which may be the missing link in the conversion process. After installing this tool, right-click on the icon within the task, go to ""EMULATIONS"" and select ""All Options On"".)

- you will also need a more current version of daemon tools lite.

so if you are running windows xp and have converted all the uif files to iso files through magiciso, the next step is to mount them.  For example, through daemon tools 3.47 i will mount the interactive hip cd and then i will also mount that same interactive hip cd with the more recent version of daemon tools simultaneously and the install process will start automatically.  

when i would only mount one file through at a time with only one daemon tools program i would get all these install errors.

also when running a program for leisure use, mount it with both daemon tools.

i have had success through this process on windows xp running through parallels on a macbook.  I have also tried this process on windows 7 but daemon tools 3.47 will not install so only two of the interactive files will work via windows 7 (for some reason they have a different 'program setup' writing that is compatible with windows 7).

the only interactive program I cannot get to work is the 'head & neck'.  for some odd reason it causes my computer to crash. maybe system requirements.   I am still looking into this and will try burning it on a dvd rom when i get a hold of one.  

if anyone has suggestions on how to run the 'interactive head & neck' file, that would be most helpful as that is the program i wanted most!

,suicuat,2010-06-15T21:27Z,"All 9 cd works fine on Windows Xp. 

There were comments suggesting to use daemon tools 3.47, but I can't install that version. So I found another way:

Do these steps:

1. Convert every cd image from .uif to .iso using MagicIso.

2. Download Daemon tools Pro.
    Turn it on and go Tools -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Check RMPS and SafeDisc options.

3. Now You should be able to mount all 9 cds, maybe except hip cd.

If You get problems with Hip cd, do this:

Mount Hip cd, Right click and open cd. Inside cd open setup folder find hip.exe file and run it. 
If you get appsetup.txt not found then simply choose/locate setup folder in hip cd, because setup folder has appsetup.txt inside.

That's it. All 9 cds work! Good luck.

1.  Convert the UIF files to ISO files with MagicISO as instructed.

2.  Install and run Daemon Tools (free lite version is fine for this purpose).

3.  Go to the properties sheet of the executable file for each installed CD, e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Primal Pictures\Interactive Head and Neck\headneck.exe, click on the Compatibility tab and select Windows XP (Service Pack 2) compatibility mode.
