Everyone needs to get this film!!"
,VisionFactory,2007-11-12T19:54Z,thanks! but there are 0 seeds currently. wake up dude :)
,rune2001,2007-11-12T22:50Z,"Thanks for the Download!

I would have paid to watch this online, but as they are only accepting viewers from the US, I was ""forced"" to pirate it.

Well, if the movie is as good as I hope it is, I will buy the DVD to show my support to the movement."
,Osaka,2007-11-12T22:53Z,"@ VisionFactory

There is a seeder now. 

He's probably on super-seeding mode... that's why it's going slow.

I wouldn't worry. Just have patience."
,_TheKatman_,2007-11-12T23:46Z,"Hi guys!

I've been seeding this all day.

Alas Azureus doesn't appear to distribute too well :(
Tried regular & super-seed. So I should be avoiding super altogether eh?

@rune2001
Search for anonymous proxy servers & select one in the US, paying via PayPal.

We're getting there guys, currently seeing 0.663 distributed copies."
,Barderis,2007-11-13T02:16Z,"hey guys, i just saw this in a full theater premiere in minneapolis. much better than Loose Change 2. They cut out a lot of the dumb stuff and added better interviews and graphics. The music is not as fun as before tho. The producer was there and explained why they made some choices. There are extras on the DVD, support em, etc... They also want to help share all extra footage they got to people."
,Osaka,2007-11-13T04:05Z,"@ _TheKatman_

You should use uTorrent.

There's nothing wrong with super-seeding (or initial-seeding), but it often makes the seeder seem invisible to all the leechers...

So people go and whine that there are no seeds..."
,Osaka,2007-11-13T06:07Z,100%...!!!!!! Yeah!
,dabbish,2007-11-13T06:17Z,"just downloaded it. the whole movie seems to work fine. VLC player plays it too. 
thanks _TheKatman_ for uploading this!

please continue seeding this. sharing is caring :)
let the truth be known! long live all pirates!

now i'm gonna go and watch this :)

"
,privatepublic,2007-11-13T06:17Z,"the torrent has exploded!

as of 11:15 Central time, my last count of seeds is at 40. 15 minutes ago it was at 1 on and off.

"
,i_like_freedom,2007-11-13T07:11Z,"This is the movie of the year!

ThePirateBay should have Loose Change Final Cut as a theme for the site during all of November and December.

Like they do with some movies... maybe change the TPB logo to something LCFC related...

That would be so cool !!"
,_TheKatman_,2007-11-13T17:25Z,"Nice to see others seeding this.  But where'd all those extra seeders go?! :(

Please continue seeding past the 1:1 ratio if at all possible.  i.e. Forced Seeding.  Even just a few hours here and there helps the community a lot.  You know it makes sense, plus it'll make you feel better! ;)"
,Barderis,2007-11-13T18:16Z,"this version is slightly different than the official screening I saw, but only with a couple little things I noticed. For one, in this version, someone doesn't shout jesus fucking shit"" or soemthing like that, i think at the beginning of the central Towers segment. Otherwise, great!"
,double_b26,2007-11-13T20:42Z,"im getting fantastic d/l speeds with this torrent.  my crappy 1mb connection usually clocks about only 30kb/s or so (i think they are capping my speed for using too much bandwidth).  ive been getting a steady 80kb/s, give or take a bit with this torrent!!  also, azureus is showing 50 seeds now.  keep up the good work pirates!!"
[V],Kitlope,2007-11-13T22:17Z,I got the video to work using Cole2 Media Codec pack using WMP 11. (yeah yeah I know WMP sucks). However the audio isn't working... any suggestions? Thanks
,_TheKatman_,2007-11-13T22:33Z,@Kitlope: VLC player
,Osaka,2007-11-13T23:16Z,"@ Kitlope

Don't use WMP - and avoid codec packs...

I use Media Player Classic (MPC).

With MPC, you can get get better picture quality than VLC, if you know what settings to use.

Also, you can use lots of special filters and ffdshow if you want to..."
[V],Kitlope,2007-11-13T23:43Z,thanks for the suggestions :)
,smartypants,2007-11-14T07:44Z,"Fucking good movie! Download, share, spread! "
,friend55,2007-12-13T06:29Z,"Why didn't the movie cover any of this??????  It's 911 ""Truth"", right?  Well, maybe not all of the truth......

,_TheKatman_,2008-01-02T00:01Z,"Hey Guys!

Hope everyone had an excellent Christmas.
I wish you all a safe, rewarding and very Happy New Year!! :)

I still don't understand how tracker & multi-trackers work.  Would really appreciate some feedback from the BT gurus out there please...

Just a day or two ago I added a few more trackers (as individual groups) within Azurues, (inc. conspiracyresearch.org).  I've now just checked Azurues and it's sky rocketed, reporting 5218 Seeds & 2329 Leechers!!! WTF!?!

Googling the hash it looks like we have the following tracker to thank:
tracker.conspiracyresearch.org:80/announce

MyBittorrent.com reports the following Seed / Leech count just for this tracker:

http://www.mybittorrent.com/info/1098045/
Seeders:  5216
Leechers: 2324

So does that mean those without the conspiracyresearch.org tracker are not seeing the majority of the peers? :(

If this is the case is there anything anyone can do to improve matters?  e.g. Should we start adding TPB & conspiracyresearch.org to the same tracker URL..?

Thanks Guys!"
,mazzer123,2008-01-23T22:47Z,see also 911 revisited (911_revisited_v2.avi)
,mazzer123,2008-04-22T16:44Z,"good film but also see for more scientific analysis (less mood music): improbable collapse, e.g.: 
[isoHunt]_Improbable_Collapse_(2006)_-_Sept_11_Documentary.3588922.TPB"
,naggi69,2008-05-22T11:27Z,"Ok.

I have not seen this ""final cut"" edition. But i understand it has the same point as the earlier versions.

First of, DONT BE FUCKING MONKEY MORONS!

Everything they say in this so-called ""documentary"" is bull shit, and manipulation.

The idiots who did this, read old unclassified goverment press releases and gathered their bull shit and read it on tape with a scary music in the background.

I must admit that in the beginning i was foolish enough to believe this SHIT, but you could use your brain and get further facts. Cause theese idiots didnt even have any proof of anything they said, but you all buy it with no doubt.

Start with this:
http://www.loosechangeguide.com/LooseChangeGuide.html

It pretty much fucks ""Loose crap"" up.


AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT GIVE THESE DISRESPECTING IDIOTS MONEY FOR THIS PROPAGANDA SHIT!

They know themself that the docu is bullshit, but now they want money, cause idiots like you believe in it!

Do not feed this lie. 
hell, i bet someone might even call me a goverment agent trying to hide the ""facts""

You must be doubtfull about theese kind of things. 

Just remember it was made by some collage kids."
