,robsamui,2007-11-29T16:10Z,THE LAST AXXO TORRENT that I picked up was passworded and sent me on a chase that took my e-mail and drove me crazy for 20 minutes. In the end - still no password after a 3-da6y download. Go figure.

,moonlitnchangin,2008-07-18T10:40Z,"even though i'm in no way racially biased I have to second the former notion.  Pathetically, I actually took the time out of my life to read through all of that and came to the conclusion that ogreme81 is one ignorant sonofabitch (with a stupid sn) for not knowing how or by whom his content is being brought to him when axxo's one of the biggest names on tpb.  awesome gratitude in a vying war. 

-robsamui, hold tight to your credit card numbers is all i can say."
