GERMAN AUDIO ONLY!! :-b

No subtitles either... "
,donpedro,2007-11-27T13:53Z,"Why does it say English, Swedish and German in the language? Sure there aren't multiple audio streams?"
,BandarenIBaren,2007-12-10T13:34Z,"I wasn't able to change either audio or turn on subtitles anyway...
If somebody knows how to do it, please tell!
I've allready downloaded another seed with Swedish subtitles hardcoded, which is what I want anyway..."
,4558845,2007-12-20T00:28Z,"BandarenIBaren is right, it seems. Though it pretends to have all sorts of subtitles, the audio is in German only and I couldn't get subtitles to work in VLC or Media Player Classic.
Great video quality though."
