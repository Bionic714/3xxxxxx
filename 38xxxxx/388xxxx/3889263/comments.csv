,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-25T10:18Z,"Starting to feel like a family reunion up in here! I'm glad so many former demonoid'ers are still searching out for their Fu Fix. Even with the major changes I'm sure Priscinadia has a few tricks up her sleeve still. I know what you mean about the pictures and all. It feels so bland making the torrent description with just text. Why can't demonoid come back to us!! Rest assured I'll be here for a while trying to upload my steadily growing collection. As soon as my last two orders arrive with decembers shaw brothers releases I'll be able to upload those new ones such as Kid from Kwangtung, The Deadly Knives, and Bloody Parrot among others."
