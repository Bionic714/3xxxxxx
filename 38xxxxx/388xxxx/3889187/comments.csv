I don't think this ever made it to true DVD..."

,hmeichhe2,2011-11-11T19:48Z,"Thank you for the upload of this one. The video and audio is as good as can be expected from a classic this old. If you use the default size, it is real clear. I increased it by about 3 times and it was still good. 
It is refreshing to see natural women that have good bodies too. "
