Tracy Lords last film, "I Love You Tracy" (1987), was also her only one in which she was legal according to US age of consent laws (18 to appear in an adult film) and thus is the only one legally distributed in the States.  I Believe Lords has bought up the rights to this film for distribution.  It's a very worthy view. :)
