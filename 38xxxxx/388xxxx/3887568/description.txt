Waylon Jennings, his health failing, played his last major concert
at Nashville's historic Ryman Auditorium in January of 2000.
Backed by the all-star Waymore Blues Band, whom he called "the
band I always wanted," his afflictions evaporated on the Ryman stage.
Joined by wife Jessi Colter and guests John Anderson, Travis Tritt
and Montgomery Gentry, he delivered a moving, exhilarating performance
revisiting some of his greatest songs. While the concert was filmed
and recorded, only a truncated single CD appeared at the time. 
Now, for the first time, the complete show is available on DVD.
It's Waylon's triumphant last hurrah, done-as always-on his terms.
