The "Forbidden Knowledge" TV show has now debuted on Ann Arbor Michigan's CTN cable public access TV channel 17.  It's sure to become the most dangerous show on TV!  Even the Ann Arbor Police took an interest in the show on the very first live episode since they showed up waiting for the host to leave the studio as an intimidation tactic!  Too much talk about secret societies in control of things I presume.
