I will post this here when it seamed to be the lastest UL!
Listening to yor/my new :) copy of Oceans for the first time in 15 years....  tears are not far away I can tell  :)

And here´s a little story for you in bad english!

I have listend to YES for many years in muy youth, but not werry wide, if you know what I mean! 
A few albums played many times!

Well...  I decided to see them live when they came to Cirkus in Stockholm!
At first I was verry dissapointed! They started with a couple of songs I´ve never heard in my life!
The show went on, and when it was over, I was convinced that this was the best show I´ve seen
in my whole life! 
I wouldn´t be suprised if it´s not the best show I ever will see. (I missed Zappa :) )
Even though I´ve never ever heard one song they played that night.

Amazing!

,gnj1958,2008-07-10T20:03Z,Thanks for UL this. This album was the very first CD I bought way back in 1985. I've been anxious to see or hear what the new remaster sounds like.
,anssetfair,2008-12-02T05:20Z,"@gnj1958 - glad to help out!  Yes has been a strong favorite of mine ever since Going for the One fell in my lap some years ago.  oh, and hearing Jon Anderson sing w/ Tangerine Dream on the Legend soundtrack.  once you hear the voice, there's no turning back.  enjoy! ~j"
