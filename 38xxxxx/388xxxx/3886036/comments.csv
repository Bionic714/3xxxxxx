,LovetheBay,2008-02-25T20:17Z,"Finally got it. Had to use 7-Zip to join files. Now I'm stuck with a 6gig image with no file type. I manually renamed to the usual (bin cue iso) but I can't mount it. I'm running Vista Home and that MAY have something to do with my issue. Any help would be great.
Thanks for upload Butch - now I just want to use it"
,LovetheBay,2008-02-27T02:25Z,Game Works - I removed one file and restarted the torrent. I could then use WINRAR to extract the iso and used Daemon lite to mount and install it. The Keygen didn't work for me but there is a general EA keygen available out there which works. I'm running a decent CPU and Graphics card and have to experiment with the settings to get it to look decent AND playable at the same time. Neat game so far. (Yes I am still Seeding)
