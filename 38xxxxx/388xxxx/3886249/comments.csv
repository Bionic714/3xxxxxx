,Max-Mayhem,2011-03-24T01:58Z,"There is no 2nd movie. There is, however, a movie by the name of The Covenant 2 in Italy, hence the ""not in italian"".. but the english title is called ""Canes"" and has absolutely NOTHING to do with this film whatsoever. So, trying to find it is pretty pointless. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480516/"

,frumpypanda,2012-03-16T23:29Z,"the covenant 2 is more likely chronicle(2012). in honesty, theyre the same movie. teens get supernatural powers of the force. teens party hard and live care free. something goes terribly wrong. massive power battle. rock music. kirsten stewart. sex scene. more rock music. montage. finale.

woohoo!"
