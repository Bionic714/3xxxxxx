This is my collection for the indie noise electronic rock band "epo-555." It's relatively up to date as of now, and, because I really enjoy the band, I've decided you would likely do so, too. I'm uploading this as an act of courtesy.

I have some info, thouhg. For the album Radioaktiv - Mafia Fallout, only Pizza Tintin and Sugarspiced Suicide are direct copies. The other two songs, Grisslappan - Radioactive and Stripped, are taken from this page:

If you didn't notice, the previews button is set to have only 30 second relays of tune. Because of this, I was forced to record each 30 seconds at a time and edit them all together. There might be a little skipping.
Also, Grouse in the Machinery is from their official website, http://www.epo-555.dk/ . The song itself is the last edit, on 03/05/07, so it might be updated in the future.
Anyway, enjoy!
