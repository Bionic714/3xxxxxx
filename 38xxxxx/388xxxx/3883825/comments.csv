This one has been going for almost 3 weeks and the swarm has managed to get to 52% completion... just enough to check the file and see that it has 2ch AC3 sound, even though the DVD has 6.1 Surround... another 3 weeks and maybe we'll have enought to know if the video quality is good or not =("
,egban,2007-12-03T23:50Z,Thanks for letting me know...i'll increase the seeding ratio to 2X the amount.
,egban,2007-12-04T04:14Z,I have slow uploads when I'm in the office cuz our ISP is crap.  My uploads increase 10-fold when I do it from home so please forgive me if my uploads seem slow 8 hours of the day.  My local time is +8.0 GMT.
,egban,2007-12-05T16:36Z,"BTW, if you don't like my upload speed, search someplace else cuz I am not a supreme being capable of increasing my ISP speed.  Maybe if you pay me, i'd consider upgrading my subscription"
