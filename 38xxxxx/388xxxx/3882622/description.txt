Now that those thugs from the scallop industry masquerading as Triple-M / Austereo management have taken out Get This it is only fitting that one last promise is fulfilled.

Yes that's right people..... Illegal download is now available.... Illegally.  More fun than a Steven Seagal movie marathon and more bizzare stares than random outcries of "This is dizzy stuff" while listening to Get This podcasts on a crowded train.

Sure you could download it legally from Triple-M's website, but you'd be a fraud and deserve one... "right... up the bracket", for this is the only way to be a true Get This patriot :)

Enjoy....
