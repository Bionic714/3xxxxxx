,mnboardin,2009-02-08T21:13Z,"""Quite frankly, until the US begins to enforce copyright laws, or until more people grow a conscience, there won't be any more DVDs produced.

For those who aren't aware, production quality video cameras cost $3,000 to $5,000 each, and I always had at least two running. Hydraulic actuated tripods for each camera to give smooth pans added another $1500 for each one. Color temperature balanced lights and umbrella stands are over $900 each, and I purchased 10 of them for filming that video.  UHF wireless microphones with multiple channels set me back another $3,000 and the wired microphone for the voice overs was another grand.  The commercial Adobe software to upload, edit and produce video, and make the original studio masters set me back $10,000 and then as Roadkill said, I took off from my regular job for over a year, to work full time on that project.  I paid $10,000 to buy royalties on the music alone.  Nothing I used was downloaded from the internet, it was all purchased with our life savings, including the banner fees I pay to the shroomery every single month to be a sponsor here, even though I don't even sell the video-it's available through other shroomery sponsors or amazon. 

In addition, I paid to have glass masters made, and every DVD set is stamped from the original glass, ensuring consistent quality.  Nothing is burned.

All those mushrooms, mycelium, petri dishes, grain jars, and test tube slants didn't grow themselves, and I had to set up the studio equipment to film all the segments, just as the mycelium was at the right stage in growth.

Add to all that, Mrs Rabbit has cancer, and was going through chemotherapy just as I/we were filming, so she was sick all the time, and the medical bills were piling up, and still are-except now I have to drive her 150 miles just to get to the doctor.  I spent the money we had for doctor bills on producing a professional quality DVD, hoping to save her life with the income it would produce.  Now that I get it done, at least half the members here have downloaded the video from torrent sites illegally, stealing medicine directly from a sick lady who would cut off her own arm to help a total stranger.  It just isn't right, and we're heartbroken over it.

If things change and people stop stealing from us, I might make another video that covers things that wouldn't fit on the fist one, along with the latest projects I've been working on in absolute secrecy. Until then, I've suspended work on anything but a mycology and mushroom cultivation textbook I'm writing for use in public and private schools.  When you guys see my video on torrent sites, please try to convince whoever is offering it to take it down.  They're not spreading knowledge, they're keeping it bottled up.

[T],Ythan,2009-05-28T02:12Z,"I've known RR since about 2003. He spends hours online each week helping newbies who have questions about mushroom hunting and cultivation. I'm sure that thousands have benefited from his expert knowledge and personal attention over the years. So if you want this video, I really encourage you to go to Amazon and pay his asking price. He's a good guy who worked hard to produce a high-quality product, just hoping to make an honest buck in a small niche market. Please give him your support."

Buy this video, support RR. 

Don't be a fucking dick. You can find all the info you need to grow elsewhere. If you want this video, buy it.

,bluecar5556,2011-05-23T03:57Z,"I'm sorry to hear about Mrs. Rabbit's misfortune with the battle with cancer. Let's get something straight, shall we?  ""Chemical"" and ""therapy"" do not belong in the same sentence.  Chemo-therapy is POISON and is being outright forced on some people with cancer, it kills ALL cells that replicate quickly, hence the hair loss.  Do not call it ""medicine"" because it is extremely poisonous and the same goes with all other pharmaceuticals.  They are all inert non-living molecules that are not essential vitamins, minerals, or molecules our immune systems thrive on but rather kick it while it's down."
,bluecar5556,2011-05-23T04:00Z,"You want to know something that actually works provided by nature herself rather than a multi-billion dollar pharma industry that is only interested in your money and not your health?  Endocannabiniods that exist in Cannabis exist naturally in the human body. They are part of your nervous and immune systems. Whether or not you smoke pot you have these chemicals already present in your body. Some have them more then others, some have them less. They act as tumor regulators, mood regulators, anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory and so on. To anyone who doesn't want to get high, you don't have to. Hemp oil from the male plant doesn't do that because they yield extremely small amount's of the psychedelic, THC.  To cure cancer all you have to do is extract the essential oils and concentrate them using ethyl alcohol, then medicate at an extremely high dose."
,bluecar5556,2011-05-23T04:17Z,"Please do not start flaming us members here at thepiratebay because you did not educate yourself and unfortunately jumped on the pharma-train on a path to self destruction.  â€œQuite frankly, until the US begins to enforce copyright laws, or until more people grow a conscience, there won't be any more DVDs produced.â€  You must not believe in freedom but rather the tyrannical debt-based monetary system.  Are you are saying you have no problem with people being put in jail for years over NON-PHYSICAL DATA that cannot be seen with the naked eye, over a bunch of random lands and grooves that can only be seen with a microscope, stamped in a piece of polycarbonate that only computers can understand?  I have news for you Mr. Rabbit.  95% of the world's currency is merely ink and paper printed out of thin air, most notably at the federal reserve bank here in the U.S., via the Israeli Zionist Jews.  People are enslaved with artificial inflation because of the fradulent Federal Reserve bank charges lending banks, â€œex. Bank Of Americaâ€ interest for every dollar that must be paid back but is non-existant in circulation to begin with hence, money=debt, make sense?  ""Give me control of a nations money supply, and I care not who makes its laws"" Amschel Rothchild.â€  If you are going to produce content with the sole intention of making money, hopefully it won't have the same outcome similar to musicians with the same mind set."
,offlabeluse2,2011-11-29T09:02Z,"RR doesn't help newbs, he eviscerates 'em. And people line up to tell him how big his cock is, and praise him for his, I quote, 'endless wisdom'. Everyone on The Shroomery just accepts this as normal. 

That some withered old egotist (who never did much in the way of discovering NEW procedures, instead just cobbling other people's work together under his copyrighted banner) should be slathered with praise every time he says, boo.' And have his every word taken as sacrament. 

Just try going on The Shroomery and even questioning these videos. See what happens. You'll have little sycophantic piranha chewing up your ass in no time! And will find you every post inspected thoroughly for reasons to boot you.

It's like some Hell's Angels took over the mushroom growing business online. Seriously.

The guy has a serious ego problem. Like there's one way to grow mushrooms? Pffft.

 I once even saw him insult some poor bootlicker for not complimenting him the right way!

 Fawning sycophant#230: ""Oh, RR, your endless wisdom has made my life worth living, you are the light eternal and everlasting, unquestionable and glorious, you're the only one who knows about mycology in the whole world, please, fuck my wife in the ass, please impart more endless wisdom about your hobby, pleeeasee...""

RR (actual quote): "" First off, this stopped being a hobby for me a long time ago!""

Plus, he even said himself that he paid thousands for the music on these DVDs. The music! Have you heard the music on these DVDs?  What a mong! Thousand for some cheesey ass country bullshit when the Shroomery is filled with musicians that would've been eager to share?  Etc. It was a poor business model from the start. So much for his 'endless wisdom'!

So basically, he took the money from his wife's cancer treatment and bought some (very expensive) magic beans. (idiot) Didn't understand that torrent existed. Paid many more times what he should've for the product. Doesn't regret a thing. Blames everything on 'pirates'. 

Plus, dude's a serious asshole, thinks his shit doesn't stink and that everyone should acknowledge him as beter than Stamets and THE Chief Poo Bah of Mycology.

(How many times does he have to toot his horn about his being a Real Professional Mycologist...now that he has a Real Professional Mushroom Farm?""

Can't be doing too badly if you now ow a Real professional Mushroom Farm, eh Marc?

You get what you give, buddy. Quit being an asshole, call your goon off of attacking anyone who questions your old ass videos...maybe people would feel some pity.

Until then: 21 seeders strong!
And the 3rd edition is available as well.
See you on the Shroomery roadkill, RR, and the rest of you paid in supplies astro turfing mushroom mafia fucknutz!

,offlabeluse2,2011-11-29T09:07Z,"Basically, dude's a dick and gets what he deserves.

The Shroomery is his little fiefdom ... but he doesn't cotrol the internet. (even though he rabidly supports SOPA) ...so, I'm enjoying watching him squirm and make up sob stories, when he's not busy humiliating newbs and puffing up his ego from all his conformist sycophantic supporters on the Shroomery.

I'm an amateur mushroom grower myself and there's no information in the video that you can't get from a free google search. All these comments about him and his followers begging people to buy his $49 dvd and the comment about him spending 30 grand of his wife's cancer treatment money on this video just makes him sound like more of a douchebag. 

I mean what kind of a person does that? This guy obviously don't have his priorities straight."
,RealDealMycoMan,2012-03-03T03:35Z,"first off im not downloading this piece of trash. 
RR is nothing but a want-a-be. whats his 3 biggest accomplishment ( besides putting common knowledge on a dvd)?, 1 growing shrooms on a bible 2) growing shrooms on a bra and 3 ) resurrect the redspore aka redboy, BUT his version he f*cked all to hell and you get mutants out the ying yang.. funny tho, the original PF redspore ( which RR used as a starting point),  works just fine... If RR was as good as he believes he is why couldnt he resurect the strain without crossing it? obviously someone had no problems, and ended up with a much better strain.

I am soo sick of hearing ""RR said"" at the shroomery. there is a LOT of seasoned cultivators there who could out grow RR with their hands tied behind their backs.  

his ego needs a major trim, and he needs to give the TRUE mycologists (Peele, Stammets,Workman and even John Allen) their due.. 

lol funny though, sometimes the shroomery lags because of the younger member base, but mycotopia figured him  out a long time ago lol and i have been around the community a long time, and can recall how RR used to dis the shroomery and their members, but most members are too new to know the REAL story..

Now don't get me wrong, I am not a heartless bastard, and i do feel for his wifes sickness, but personally I dont think raping the noobs, as he is doing with this dvd, is any better then pirating his dvd, wether the sale of it is for his wifes medicine or not .. ( lol my wifes dieing of cancer, let's take her med money and make a dvd ) 

charging $40 for common knowledge, is like the keeper charging $75 for a spore syringe. both are preying on the noobs and the uninformed.

TO THOSE WHO ARE NEW TO THE HOBBY, BEFORE YOU BUY THIS DVD, ADD 4 BUCKS TO IT, AND BUY STAMMETS MUSHROOM CULTIVATOR, 

you'll get 1000X more knowledge,  but you wont get 5 minutes of watching RR put rye grain in a colander.lol.. your choice."
,Lyca77,2012-05-28T01:29Z,"I heard about this video on the Shroomery in a post where RR was complaining how people were pirating it, if it weren't for that post I wouldn't have known about the DVD and that it's available on a torrent. Will be seeding, thanks!"
