Greetings sumo lovers. Here is day one from Fukuoka. Commentary is in japanese, so you can brush up your japanese. If you don't undestand japanese - tough luck :) No, seriously, I forgot to change audio to english, tommorow will be better.
Anyways, it would seem that Kaio is (still) alive, we'll see if can kick some sumo ass on the home turf.
Enjoy, and don't forget: seeding = good karma, not seeding = YOU SUCK!
