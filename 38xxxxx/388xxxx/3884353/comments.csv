,freak627,2007-11-11T23:10Z,"Yes everyone please seed. I seeded for 2 weeks after basho. Also, is there anyway you can make these a bit smaller?"
,don44y,2007-11-12T01:04Z,Thank You zlo666. We all here have been praying you would do your fabulous job again this basho.  You are a god send.  The videos are great - better even than ESPN used to do. I will seed til DLing stops.  Cheers
,jalopiimae,2007-11-12T17:44Z,Size is ok because quality is ok. My vote would be that lets do not compromise too much about quality in order to get size smaller. Off course uploader decides ;-)

,joem35,2007-11-13T20:14Z,Just curious. Did you get day 2? I know that last basho you had a glitch. Appreciate the work you do. Just fiending!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2007-11-14T04:00Z,Day 2 matches only here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3889418/Kyushu_Basho_2007_-_Day_2_-_Sumo_LITE_-_Matches_ONLY.mpg
,joem35,2007-11-14T04:58Z,"Appreciate it, but i'd rather get the whole thing if possible. If zlo666 didn't get it, i'll certainly give yours a go. Matches are better than nothing. :)
If you have the whole thing, please post it. Folks would be very appreciative."
