,Pontefix,2007-11-13T01:20Z,"This doesn't look like a aXXo torrent. The size isn't aXXo. The file info isn't aXXo. And the distributor doesn't looks like aXXo: aXXo-torrents, never seen it before.

So I will see when I have it on my HD, folks, so thanx for the torrent, who ever you are, and what ever it is in this torrent."
,thephil,2007-11-13T04:45Z,"its not aXXo, since aXXo nolonger uploading to this site you got more scumbags using his names, and thats why he left becuase theres no MODs keeping these aholes away"

(... Even you, Brutus ?)
Last words of Ceaser as he was betrayed and stabbed in the back by his best friends hundreds of times...

TPB and aXXo are big boys... let them work it out.

Want and the 'aXXo format and only trust getting it from him, then MiniNova, TorrentBox, and others...

Love TPB ??? Then give the other Release Groups and individuals a shot... they deserve it too... 

This will wok out better without fakes making it worse."
