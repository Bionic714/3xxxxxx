,jam543,2007-11-16T07:51Z,imovie keeps quitting unexpectedly i think one of the other programs also.
,sir_scutter,2007-11-21T06:07Z,"works as far as i used it. iphoto is no problem, garageband works for the little i used it. i can't use imovie though because i have G4. new imovie only works on intel macs. i didn't install iweb because i don't have .mac and itunes isn't a problem because that's free download... also didn't try idvd but i will soon once i copy my old imovie back from other mac."

,Rexscar,2007-12-11T04:21Z,"upgrade it? - didn't know they'd done ilife '09 yet??
:)"
,IcECrEaMSkAtETeAm21,2007-12-16T01:43Z,i heard that apple puts some kind of tracking thing on ilife or something thats why im kinda hesitant of downloading it. plus i already got a letter in the mail about downloading software offline. has anybody else heard about this?
,Fire Crow,2007-12-17T08:51Z,Does anyone seed?! Thank you!
,djjdw,2007-12-27T01:24Z,what do I use to open the file to use?
,VestWithSleeves,2007-12-27T08:53Z,This is one of the slowest-downloading torrents I've ever encountered.  Maybe more seeds would help? :)
,chunkyblamm,2007-12-29T20:56Z,"After installation imovie would not open, but after installing the updates everything works perfect.  Thanx!"
,brocksamsonkiller,2008-01-04T19:23Z,"Install and update 
then run disk utility  repair disk permissions 

Restart mac

good as gold 
 (i MOVIE will not work on mac g4) for those who have questions
"
,Thomaz,2008-01-09T01:27Z,"Does this include Swedish? If not, is there another iLife-torrent on TPB that does?

And how about when it comes to updates, will it just accept & update?"
,umhurricanes34,2008-01-16T02:59Z,Seed please?
,lilzac26,2008-01-28T17:45Z,I'm downloading right now but I have a question... how do I seed?

,seanest,2008-02-10T03:52Z,"Doesn't work for me - 

Error -4096 when trying to mount

Any ideas?

Sean"
,seanest,2008-02-10T04:24Z,"Ok. G5 2.0ghz dual Powermac (PPC)

with no hacks. Error -4096 when I try to mount, having booted from Leopard.

Same error when I try to mount having booted from Tiger.

Even more weird, if the downloaded image is corrupted, how come it's seeding from my machine?

,ralfswan,2008-03-09T09:19Z,"If anyones having a slow download with this, open up Adium and mine sped up by 80kb/s ;)"
