Here are some old CD's of medieval music for your listening pleasure -- some of which have been out of print for more than a decade. Track information and cover art may not be available for all of them.

To prevent the problems with tag corruption that plagued my last attempt to share this fine old music with you, I have wrapped each torrent into a single .rar file. I will be seeding five of them, so be sure to amaze your friends and collect them all.  :D

This torrent includes:

Chants de l'-lise de Rome (Ensemble Organum)
Marcel Peres (Ensemble Organum)
Gregorian Chants, Christmas Chants (various)
Russian Medieval Chant- The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (The Russian Patriarchate Choir)

All are high quality rips at 320 kB or better! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!
