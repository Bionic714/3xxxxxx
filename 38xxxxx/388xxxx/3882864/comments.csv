,Rivenshield,2007-11-12T04:35Z,"Thanks for the kind feedback (/bows). The Music/Chants of the Middle Ages torrents -- that is to say, the new unspoilt ones -- are laboriously being seeded one at a time, the smaller ones first.

My older torrents went away with my old hard drive... but I may recompile them. (The Elizabethan torrent shows up in Mininova as having 8 seeders currently. Try there). I also have a great number of old medieval CD's that are still in storage, and new torrents will be forthcoming ere the end of the year. Keep an eye out."
,Ducatimike,2007-11-20T07:00Z,Fantastic collection! This is going on the ipod as I speak. I am seeding now and will gladly keep on. Thanks again!
