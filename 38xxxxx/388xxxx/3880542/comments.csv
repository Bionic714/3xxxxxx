You should decrypt the files yourself and upload a no-DRM version of the books. That, or include your keys.txt file in this torrent. :p Cheers, mate. And thank you for the books - the ones I can open anyhow. ;)"
,nathanrdotcom,2008-02-05T03:49Z,I would love it if someone would make a torrent of just the Q&A book because I can't open it. Thanks in advance.

,KleinRot,2008-06-24T20:37Z,Thank-you soooo much! I am missing books two and three from the Titan series and have been trying to order them for MONTHS!!!
,ncient,2008-09-03T13:14Z,"too many files to check immediately but it appears,
NO password required, Thanks theImortal1974 !

that said there was a comment that some files could not be opened.
trust theImortal1974 will address this.

feel that it important for genuine upLoaders to be aware of Others with scams.

when 1 upLoads zipped-file[s] if would be nice to state that is is NOT password-protected.

there are those who know you will download for a week and have no access to a password after that.

please be extra careful with downloading exe-files.
some may appear as an anti-virus but they end up as spam and would totally corrupt your System as it could be difficult to remove without a re-format.

sam.
TPB is fast becoming ny favourite !
