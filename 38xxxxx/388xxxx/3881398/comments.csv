I don't have a copy of Nero, so I converted it an iso with NRGtoISO, and with nrg2iso on Linux, but I couldn't mount either iso because they were corrupted or unsupported. I tried mounting it with fuseiso which is supposed to support nrg images, but that didn't work either."
[T],hoch88,2009-05-10T22:27Z,"It is in perfect order. The NERO concept called .nrg or .iso is brilliant because finally there's a true ""blueprint"" available of the original record. NO LOSS! Just ""mount"" the ""image"" in DAEMON Tools, and play It in MediaPlayer or what evers player on your computer as if you put a physical record in the slot. There is NO DIFFERENCE. There is no further mystique to it. "
