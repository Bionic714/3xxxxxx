,Hunter_Killer_117,2008-02-18T05:26Z,"This is how you install,
Download and install Magic ISO, or Daemon Tools,
Then mount, or open the .mdf file with daemon or Magic,
Burn the file,
Run the setup that you just burned,
Once installed run the Patch,
Then, open the NoCD crack .ZIP file and replace the .exe in the installation folder with the one in the .ZIP file,
After that you should be able to play the game.:)"
,Hunter_Killer_117,2008-02-18T05:32Z,"Forgot to mention, great upload! I recommend getting the Stargate Pack 3 at http://bridgecommander.filefront.com/file/Stargate_Pack;82134"
,Apollo101,2008-07-06T16:47Z,"I have the thing working but every tome I try to mod the game, I get the black screen of death and the insignia cursor.

I know there is a way to mod the game because I've done it before with another copy (i lost that one with the rest of my data when my comp got wiped). Please help.

thanks"
,Apollo101,2008-07-06T16:48Z,also another good mod is the Kobayashi Maru 1.0 pack....look it up on www.bcfiles.com
,Tyrram999,2008-09-21T09:17Z,thx m8 awesome cant wait to play it I never got the chance
,videnthecoldone,2008-10-02T23:05Z,"Heh, kinda forgot about this one. I'm glad you are all enjoying it. 

As for the mods, i have never had a problem modding a cracked version (though i do own the original) Some mods are buggy, or incompatible with other mods and may cause the black screen you described. "
,nat13_3,2009-09-20T16:33Z,So far I've seeded this 20 times what I've gotten. Awesome game! Works fine. Make sure to get the KM mod for it.
