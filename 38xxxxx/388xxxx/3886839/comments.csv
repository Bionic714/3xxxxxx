,bosco25,2009-02-19T07:58Z,I wish I could share your praise...no sound for me unfortunately.  Any suggestions?  I recently downloaded the K-Lite Codec Pack 4.6.2 but that didn't fix the video for this torrent.  Is there a specific codec I should get?
,CrownVic96,2009-02-25T06:37Z,"@bosco25


Try VLC media player for video and get the AC3 audio codec.

Hope that helps"

Also, as in the notes, it says DivX so get that as well, if you don't already."
