Not a bad collection but I am looking for the others  that I remember watching on VHS cassette years ago,  these are:-

Too few flicks have been made on this subject. I've found only ""Bong of the Dead"" (Zombies used as fertilizer for weed) and ""Secret of ganja boxing"" (Ganja kung fu is hilarious).
I'll love to see Cheech & Chong again!
Thank You, man. I wish You could have a toke on this excellent bong of Nepali (cough cough).
Thank You, Thank You Thank You!"
