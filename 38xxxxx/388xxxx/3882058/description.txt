PLOT OUTLINE/PLOT SUMMARY:
This is a twisted story about sex, drugs, and college. Three disturbed students at Camden college get involved in a love triangle. Sean Bateman (brother of American Psycho's Patrick Bateman) is a womanizing drug dealer who falls in love with virginal Lauren (not to be confused with her slutty roommate Lara,) because he inspects that she is his secret admirer, who is leaving notes in his box. Although Lauren does like Sean, she is still infatuated with Victor (her shallow ex boyfriend) who is in Europe for a semester. Lauren used to date Paul before he came out of the closet, and now Paul has his eyes on Sean when he mistakes him for bisexual. Things get more complicated since all the side characters (including the mentioned Lara and Victor) are deeply disturbed as well. Everybody is only looking out for themselves, which insures that nothing good can come from this. One knows this because the end of the story is the first scene, and the rest of the movie serves to show how Lauren, Paul, and Sean wind up miserable at "The End of the World Party."
