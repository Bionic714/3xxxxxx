WTF are you talking about?? The CD version has 12 tracks.. and the LP has 9 tracks.. 2 of them are different.. so.. the original version with 14 tracks?? only if you have the cd version and the lp version.. and listen to both of them.... show me that original version please.. because i can't find it... ;) ... the LP version has ""Shimmer"" and ""Hide And Seek In Geisha's Garden"" and the others are also present in the cd version.. nice up :)"
,nunoduke,2008-12-21T13:00Z,"if this is a mix with cd and lp songs.. you show included also the ""Lost High"" track .. :)"
