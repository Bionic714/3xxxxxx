,kaka_22,2007-11-13T12:44Z,Is online on this game???
,kav2k,2007-11-13T15:18Z,"Hehe. On Windows XP (and thus DX9) this game gives about 5 FPS with a hardware config: C2D 6600 @ 2.7 GHz/core, 2 Gb RAM, 640Mb GeForce 8800 GTS.
*might* be better with DX10, though."
,kav2k,2007-11-13T16:52Z,"..okay, it's not at all bad at maximum settings IF you turn off antialiasing."
,younlaot,2007-11-13T17:49Z,"Don't forget to do the dx9 tricks in the CVAR config files to get DX10 eye candy in DX9 XP.  For more info, here are instructions:

Go to your game folder, go to Crysis/Game/Config/CVarGroups

For EACH config file, open it in notepad and take the first section BEFORE the [1], which in the sys_spec_full.cfg file would be these settings:

sys_spec_ObjectDetail=4
sys_spec_Shading=4
sys_spec_VolumetricEffects=4
sys_spec_Shadows=4
sys_spec_Texture=4
sys_spec_Physics=4
sys_spec_PostProcessing=4
sys_spec_Particles=4
sys_spec_Sound=4
sys_spec_Water=4
sys_spec_GameEffects=4

and overwrite the [3] section with those values.  Do that inside EACH of the cfg files in that folder.  Then set all your settings to High in game and BLAMBOO!  You have DX10 Very High settings while under XP.  Yay!  Turn off anti-aliasing and go to about 1024x768 and you have 20-30fps with dx10-like eye candy.  :)  Enjoy."
,djnforce9,2007-11-13T21:07Z,"Alright. That was just plain weird. I wonder why these files look like they were compressed with 7zip when they are winrar files (i.e. file extensions should be r01, r02, r03, etc)"
,Darcwolf,2007-11-14T02:07Z,"Unless you have an 8800GTX don't even attempt this game, on the demo I could only get it to play on medium settings at 1680 x 1050 with 2x AA with a Q6600 OC'd to 3.6GHz with an 8800GTX and 4 gigs of OCZ 1066. This game is a beast!"
,ITSME_2029,2007-11-14T08:45Z,HEY I HAVE A 8800GTS 640 MB WITH 2GIG RAM .........AND IT WORKS FINE.........MAY NOT BE ALL SETTINGS IN HIGH BUT MARGINALLY IN HIGH

,Arash.au,2007-11-14T12:49Z,"I'm playing the Demo with a dual core 4400, 2 gigs of Ram and a 8600GT. Runs pretty smooth.

I think it just needs a lot of processing power."

,chafalcar,2007-11-17T00:56Z,"ammend that: if it's running slow, increase the upload limit.  the protocol traffic on this large of a swarm is pretty heavy."

,Shadowtheweak,2007-11-17T20:55Z,"If anyone is confused about the rzr-crys files, just unzip any one of them with Winrar, double click setup.  When it asks for the cd key, go into the Crysis Folder, then the Razor folder and there will be a keygen."
,stilbuzzing,2007-11-17T22:38Z,"kazar, hellmaker and magazine unrar the files with latest winrar starting with 000 or 001 (you only need to unrar 1 of the files and it automatically unrars them all in turn) that will give you your ISO file, mount that with daemon tools, THEN YA AWAY and wishing ya pc could run it properly!!! yep it's quite a sytem resources heavy game....... NOW ALL YOU PEERS INCREASE YA UPLOAD LIMIT FROM THE PROBABLE 10 OR 15 kbps YOU TIGHT ASSES ARE ALLOCATING AND EVERYONE WILL GET BETTER THAN 10 TO 20 kbps. If anyones getting more than that ya lucky i've been dowloading a week now, and have uploaded 5 times more than i've downloaded, so come on guys i'm still only at 80.09%"

,SinBin_Squeakz,2007-11-18T16:37Z,"Ive got Norman Anti-virus program and it puts the Keygen in quarantine as soon as i try to use it because its an unauthorized generator. Is there any way to configure Norman so that it will allow access to the keygen?

Cheers beforehand"
,rvictor1234,2007-11-18T16:59Z,"usually there is a way to trust just that file.  look up settings or something like it, there should be some permissions you can set. oh......and by the way!  SEED!!!!!!!!!"
,rpgman1,2007-11-18T19:25Z,"I'm uploading between 50-60kB/s here for this torrent, but my download is only around 38kB/s and gets over 100kB/s at night time here in the U.S..
Anyone confirmed that this is the authentic Crysis and the crack and keygen working?"
,SinBin_Squeakz,2007-11-18T20:32Z,"I fixed the problem i had with Norman blocking the Keygen and now everything works fine.

This is what i did to get the game working:

1. Extracted a random rzr-crys files with WinRar. (They dont look like files that can be extracted but just use winrar archive and then extract it)

2. Mounted the image with Deamon tools. (the file looks like a winrar icon by default)

3. Started the install and when i was prompted to  enter a CD-key i used the Key generator in the Razor1911 folder to get a random CD-key. (My Anti-virus program blocked the KG at first but i just told it to allow that .exe and i was good to go)

4. Installed the game and copied the crack from Razor1911 folder and overwrote the file in the game directory.

5. Clicked Play :D

Im sure most of you know how this works but in case there are any beginners out there who cant figure this out maybe this will help you :)"

,rpgman1,2007-11-23T09:00Z,My guess is that those files were corrupted during the download process. It always happens to me whenever I download large torrents that have numerous files. My guess is to delete those files that were corrupted and download them again. I did and it worked out fine later.
