,younlaot,2007-11-13T17:51Z,"Don't forget to do the dx9 tricks in the CVAR config files to get DX10 eye candy in DX9 XP. For more info, here are instructions:

Go to your game folder, go to Crysis/Game/Config/CVarGroups

For EACH config file, open it in notepad and take the first section BEFORE the [1], which in the sys_spec_full.cfg file would be these settings:

sys_spec_ObjectDetail=4
sys_spec_Shading=4
sys_spec_VolumetricEffects=4
sys_spec_Shadows=4
sys_spec_Texture=4
sys_spec_Physics=4
sys_spec_PostProcessing=4
sys_spec_Particles=4
sys_spec_Sound=4
sys_spec_Water=4
sys_spec_GameEffects=4

and overwrite the [3] section with those values. Do that inside EACH of the cfg files in that folder. Then set all your settings to High in game and BLAMBOO! You have DX10 Very High settings while under XP. Yay! Turn off anti-aliasing and go to about 1024x768 and you have 20-30fps with dx10-like eye candy. :) Enjoy."

,HawkwindUK,2007-11-13T20:22Z,"For anyone that can't install this, here's some help
----------------------------------------------------
There are many ways to do this and here is one ...

Right click on file: rzr-crys.001

From the small menu, select ""Open With ...""

Tell it to use the program called Winrar (if you aint got it, get it!).

When Winrar loads up, select ""Extract To"" at the top and

then click on ""OK"" and it will create a 6GB+ file called rzr-crys.iso
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You COULD just burn the ISO now (duel layer disc) if you want but I mounted it ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Load up DAEMON Tools which you can get it here ...

http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5)

... and make sure you choose the right one for your machine!

Tell it where the ISO is (rzr-crys.iso) and double click on it and Dameon tools

will create a virtual drive with all the files you need on it.

To see the virtual drive, double click ""My Computer"" and see the new one with the name ""Crysis"".

Right click on the virtual drive and select OPEN (it may auto play?) and double click on ""setup.exe"".

IMPORTANT!: On the disc or mounted disk, the keygen and crack are in the folder ""Razor 1911""
rzr-crys.exe is the keygen (key generator)
Crysis.exe is the crack (this needs to overwrite the original in the game folder (see below))

When the installation asks for the key/serial, you need to double click on rzr-crys.exe and
it will auto enter the key/serial for you. If you have any bother use this ...
IRMD-CXS5-T5J8-32K5-1911

Now install the game and I didn't tick any of the boxes before clicking on FINISH.

Allow it to install the other things

DON'T run it yet!.

Copy the file (the crack) from the disc or mounted disc \Razor1911\Crysis.exe to ...

c:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Crytek\Crysis\Bin32  "
,HawkwindUK,2007-11-13T20:27Z,"... and overwrite the old file.

Play the game and get killed! hah hah hah

Hope it helps anyone that doesn't know how.

your hard drive isn't formatted in the NTFS filing system that windows uses. My guess is that you've formatted using the FAT filing system. the upside of this is that it is cross-platform compatible, but the downside is that it cannot handle any files above 4GB in size. 
in order to use this file you're going to have to reformat your hard drive in the NTFS filing system, you should be able to do so with any windows installation CD. I suggest you back-up any files you wish to keep onto CDs or Floppys or an external HDD before reformatting."

I downloaded this, and seeded for several days.

Now when i opened the folder they were all unrecognized, so following the suggestions of somone on these comments I made ALL the files .rar, that part worked great. 

now here comes my kicker! When i tried extracting the files it would stop and say ""missing crysis.001"" so i tried browsing for it, knowning it wanted the next rar file to extract but the damn rar wouldnt show!

so i deleted it from my computer, and am now re downloading.

How can i make it easy so that they all just show up as rar files and i can extract, crack, and play.

-When it finished downloading, I extracted it to a folder i had created on my desktop. 
-After, I had just clicked on the autorun and it started to install.
-Then, I had updated to patch 1.2 that I also had downloaded.
-Finally, I applied the crack and it worked!

,EvilSwordfish,2008-05-07T15:16Z,"For anyone that can't install this, here's some help
----------------------------------------------------
There are many ways to do this and here is one ...

Right click on file: rzr-crys.001

From the small menu, select ""Open With ...""

Tell it to use the program called Winrar (if you aint got it, get it!).

When Winrar loads up, select ""Extract To"" at the top and

then click on ""OK"" and it will create a 6GB+ file called rzr-crys.iso
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You COULD just burn the ISO now (duel layer disc) if you want but I mounted it ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Load up DAEMON Tools which you can get it here ...

http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5)

... and make sure you choose the right one for your machine!

Tell it where the ISO is (rzr-crys.iso) and double click on it and Dameon tools

will create a virtual drive with all the files you need on it.

To see the virtual drive, double click ""My Computer"" and see the new one with the name ""Crysis"".

Right click on the virtual drive and select OPEN (it may auto play?) and double click on ""setup.exe"".

IMPORTANT!: On the disc or mounted disk, the keygen and crack are in the folder ""Razor 1911""
rzr-crys.exe is the keygen (key generator)
Crysis.exe is the crack (this needs to overwrite the original in the game folder (see below))

When the installation asks for the key/serial, you need to double click on rzr-crys.exe and
it will auto enter the key/serial for you. If you have any bother use this ...
IRMD-CXS5-T5J8-32K5-1911

Now install the game and I didn't tick any of the boxes before clicking on FINISH.

Allow it to install the other things

DON'T run it yet!.

Copy the file (the crack) from the disc or mounted disc \Razor1911\Crysis.exe to ...

Your a noob. Dont ever return to the world of torrenting.

@ On topic

FOR THOSE WHO CANT FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO AFTER DOWNLOADING, FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. After downloading, open the first .001 file with WINRAR.

2. Extract that .001 file to anywhere, the rest of the .00X's will follow along.

3. After you have the completed .iso, mount the .iso like normal and install.

4. The keygen doesnt work, you have to find another crysis serial key.

5. After your done installing, goto the crysis directory and replace the crysis.exe with the cracked one you find in the .iso file.

6. Then your done! Cracked serials work on MP too!

Note: If your getting black screens and crashing, THEN UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS. The only other reasons is that your using a 64bit OS or you have a shitty computers. Hey kids, your daddy's laptop with shitty intel onboard graphics wont even open the .exe"

,deviltrainer,2010-12-10T17:24Z,"@all who r facing problem with the RaR files

some of u r confused wat type of it is(it's not RaR files). Ya, i gotta solution for u guys just use the software called ""hjsplit"" just google it ull surly get it n its a free ware n very small program of less than 500KB. 

STEP TO USE IT

1. Just use double-click that software.

2. Select 'join'.

3. A window will open in which select 'input file'

4. Now browse it to first split file that is 'rzr-crys'(001) file.

5. Use 'output' to where u want output file. (default output path is where your split exits)

6. Now click 'start'

njoy game budies.

hav fun

thanx to razor and seeders."
,deviltrainer,2010-12-12T15:22Z,"@ all actually it doesn't worked for this type of file. SORRY to guys.

actually 100% working procedure 

1. Right click 'rzr-crys'(001) file.

2. Goto properties.

3. change openwith to winRarR.

4. Click apply and then OK.

5. Now double click 'rzr-crys'(001) file.

6. A winRar window will open in which you'll find 'rzr-crys.iso' file.

7. Right click 'rzr-crys.iso' file, then click on 'extract without confirmation'.

8. After process completed you'll find an image file in the same directory. 

Good luck buddies

Thanks a lot to RAZOR and seeders."

,NickManch,2010-12-25T06:42Z,"Hi guys. First of all a very happy Christmas and happy new year to one and all.

Ok I've downloaded this game (still seeding) and installed it day before yesterday. Went without hitch I'm pleased to say. The inbuilt key generator worked just fine and the first one I tried worked perfectly. I copied over the crysis.exe from the 1911 folder to the game one - which was a bit confusing as I had both a 32 bit AND a 64 bit game folder and the instructions didn't say which to copy it to so I copied it to BOTH. :)

Now the problems start for me - I double click on the Crysis icon on my desktop and nothing happens .. not a thing. No choppy gameplay, no options screen, no error messages to say your system can't handle this game - nothing/nada/zilch! :(

I am running Win7 Ultimate 64 bit on an AMD Athalon 7750 dual core processor. 1.5 Gb RAM and NVidia GeForce 9600 GT graphics card with 512 Mb onboard RAM/memory.

Can anyone offer a reason how I may be able to get this game to work? I'm hardly a computer OR torrent newbie, although I'm no expert either. Any help/advice much appreciated. Cheers. Nick."
,NickManch,2010-12-26T03:01Z,"Well I've now managed to get the game working, thanks to this Win7 64 bit crack - 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5488414/Crysis_Crack_64bit_%28Works_In_Win7_64bit%29

I just downloaded it (about 2 or 3 minutes) and copied the crysis.exe file over to the 64 bit folder and voila, now have a working game. :)

On my system it's still a bit choppy in places with lots of disk access from time to time but that's probably more a case of 'only' running 2.7 MHz and 'only' 1.5 gig of RAM. I'm guessing more RAM and speed will eliminate that. I've taken settings down to medium and that seems to be a lot better but as I say, at least now I have a working game. For others in a similar situation, this solution will almost certainly work for you. :)

Nick who is now a happy chappy. :)"

Everything has worked through the torrent download with uTorrent, the extracting with 7zip, mounting, installing, the key generator, etc. I have Crysis installed on my hard drive, but cannot get it to start with any of the cracks mentioned here. Spent a long time reading all the comments here too.

The best I got was a crack where the game started fine, new game loaded fine, but when it displays 'press any key to continue' i do and it goes black. Shortly after it goes back to my desktop.

Hey, I Figured out what my problem was. First off, I already had the 1.21 version installed (actually shows as 1.1.1.xxxx on the bottom right of the menu screen).

It must've been settings related because it worked if I used all HIGH settings and no higher than 4x AA (using 2x for performance). Very weird, but I hope this helps someone. 

The issue I was having was that it would load all the way until the ""Press any button to continue"" screen. Then whenever I hit anything it when black and then returned to my desktop."

2. Will find 2 folders: Bin32 and Bin64
3. Copy both folders to the original folder of Crysis (Example: C:\Program Files\Crytek\Crysis)
4. Run the Bin32 Crysis.exe

This torrent is a bit tricky for those of us with this OS, so here's what worked for me if you're having issues. Obviously download the torrent then......

1. Unrar (you'll have to select your extracting program manually since it's not instantly recognized)
2. Mount the .iso
3. Install (use any one of the keys that 'ohithere' posted on page 20)
4. Once installed, head over to  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3884875/Crysis_Vista_x64_Fix-Razor1911 and download the file
5. Unrar
6. Copy both folders, Bin32 and Bin64, to your installation directory and overwrite
7. Inside the Bin64 folder, modify the settings to the Crysis.exe (NOT Crysis64.exe) so that it'll run in compatibility mode with Windows Vista SP2 and also 'Run as administrator'
8. Run the game from the installation directory

The keygen is not a Trojan as most semi-experienced users know. Anti-virus makes this simple mistake because of how keygens operate. Besides, Razor1911 has been a trusted uploader for years, haven't any complaints yet. A tip of my hat good sir (or ma'am)."
,fireydeath81,2012-05-10T01:36Z,"I use Vista and I followed a different method to play. This also fixed the ""Failed to load the game DLL"" and ""Insert the correct Crysis CD"" errors, both of which I got and which other people have gotten. Here is what I did:

1. The torrent will give you a bunch of files, use WinRAR and extract the first file (the .001 file).
2. Find and double click on setup and install the game. When prompted to, use one of the keygen codes that ohithere posted on page 20.
3. Copy everything that you unRAR-ed into the installation folder (Program Files/Electronic Arts/Crysis). Select ""Move and Replace.""
4. Click on the Crysis application that you brought over from the torrent (so the cracked version) and play.

If there was a step I missed or you're still experiencing an error just post a comment and I'll try to solve it."

,easyskankin,2012-06-24T01:10Z,fast download! the graphics on this game are insane!! my little ATI Radeon 5670 is sweating like crazy! I can just barely pump out high graphics at 30FPS. even at medium graphics it's bogging down a bit. I would LOVE to be able to play this at very high. I NEED TO UPGRADE!!
,easyskankin,2012-06-27T04:09Z,"UPDATE*

I was able to download the official 1.2 patch and install that with no problems at all. just make sure you do a clean install and immediately install the patch. don't copy the crack before you install the patch or else it won't work. 

1. install game.

2. install 1.2 patch

3. now you can copy the crack to the bin32 folder and your good to go!"

I tried remounting the iso, no luck. Any ideas why this isn't working? I have very little experience with these things, so if you could dumb it down for me, that would be great :)"

,squash34,2012-08-20T11:54Z,How is someone with Windows 7 64-bit supposed to get this working? All the torrents for razor's x64 fix are broken with 0 seeders.
,roadki11,2012-08-20T17:05Z,whenever I try starting the game it says wrong disc inserted. can someone help me please
,squash34,2012-08-20T23:19Z,"@roadki11

You need to copy the crack over. But if you're using 64-bit Windows like me, it won't do you any good.

I've tried running it in compatibility mode for VistaSP2, but that does no good. Because all the torrents people are linking to for a x64 fix are dead. 0 seeders."
,suey22,2012-08-20T23:40Z,Can i download this and then the 64bit crack file from chuckmamuck and have it work that way?
,squash34,2012-08-21T02:16Z,The crack files no longer have any seeders.
