,mrbb,2007-11-12T11:59Z,While i appreciate this as my little boy will love it....how many more people are going to upload axxo's torrents? The place is going to be flooded with multiple copies of the same file.....
,zlayzer,2007-11-12T19:09Z,"it says 3831 seeders so i hope all of them seed :-) imagine 1kb/s from all of them that would be 3,8mb /s =) i'm currently downloading at 10kb/s.....

Please you who are downloading seed and to those who are done downloading : SEED!!!! =D"
,zlayzer,2007-11-12T19:10Z,Ehm just got 70kb/s So forget what i said but keep seeding ;) i'll seed it for 1 day at 10-20kb/s

,PawnSacrifice,2007-11-17T09:13Z,"aXXo is a God. Does anyone know if the little film at the beginning of the movie is included? I've been reliably informed its extremely funny. It's titled ""Lifted"" I believe. Someone please reply? Thanks!"

,tfilez17,2007-11-27T11:33Z,"The quality of the encoding is really poor. Even when viewing at original size I can see lots of pixelation. Looks like this was originally encoded at a lower resolution than 664 x 274 and then scaled up.

Dunno if I could be doing something wrong?"

,Happy_Baker,2007-12-12T07:04Z,"==========

Our Ripper, who art on mininova,
aXXo be thy name.
Thy torrents come.
Seeding will be done,
Here as it was on suprnova.
Give us this day our latest rips.
And forgive us our leeching,
As we forgive those that leech from us.
And lead us not on to private trackers;
But deliver us from the MPAA:
For thine is the ripping, the seeding, and the glory,
For ever and ever.

Amen?

 i can,t download games videos plz report !"
,Euph0ria,2007-12-22T15:27Z,"*Very* Poor quality.  I'm extremely disappointed with this release.  Almost identical to release by ""Klaxxon"" (another poser who fit ""axxo"" into his nickname for hits).   The vertical resolution is halved, and you can see some severe aliasing.  I've grabbed 3 different versions and only one was high quality.  Look for ""Ratatouille PROPER DVDRip XViD-MDP"" for a quality release instead."
,michaelrwatson,2007-12-22T23:48Z,"I dunno if this is really aXXo or not, but it's an excellent rip. I tend to think it *is* axxo because the audio is CBR (constant bitrate), whereas most groups nowadays, being stupid, use an improper VBR (variable bitrate). "
,michaelrwatson,2007-12-22T23:49Z,"p.s. incase you didn't connect the dots there, CBR suggests axxo because all axxo rips (that i've seen) have been CBR."
,michaelrwatson,2007-12-23T00:03Z,"hmmm.... now that i'm watching it, i see there's something odd about the vertical resolution, as if it's been resampled or upsampled or something.... There are jaggies on angled straight lines. Well, at least the ausio's in sync........."
,Rickslick,2007-12-24T23:39Z,Thanx =)
,the_crazy_swede,2007-12-30T00:08Z,"aXXo the spanish little girl stopped upploading her torrents to piratebay and minova becasue she felt like she was treated ""badly"" by the sites. so she stopped upploading them to this site and minova. now aXXo-torrents is uploading aXXo torrents that he/she gets off sites that he downloads from."
,The_Swedish_Soldier,2008-01-02T15:35Z,"excellent movie!

i give it 7/10 the sound is very good!

the video quality isnt really aXXo quality but definetively a movie worth downloading!

,emachines,2008-01-21T21:59Z,i know AXXO is not posting anymore but would be great if AXXO would log onto these fakes and write a comment. A true master has been bullied by wankers who use the AXXO name to get their crap downloaded and therefore AXXO should let the AXXO fans and followers know AXXO is out their watching over those who care in the QUALITY AND CONTENT OF A DOWNLOAD that this is shit. Their is much crap out their. HAIL AXXO TRUE MASTER
