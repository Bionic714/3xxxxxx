,AlixMoralix,2007-11-17T22:54Z,Awesome electro: tight and minimal. None of that cheesy electro-pop stuff.  Songs are not mixed; perfect for DJ-ing. Thank you!
,psydonia,2007-12-20T17:26Z,This one is the best fukkin electro tunes iÂ´we heard this year . Enjoy ppl !!!
,Kjelsaasbjornen,2008-04-18T22:31Z,"Good seeding folks! Thank you very much for putting this out here, more great minimal should be available easier.

Any advice of more music with deep bass, rough and tight!?!"
