To All:

  
  This is my first movie upload.  Please leave comments as to the quality.  I think the quality is ok, but the source is the actual movie dvd from 2001.  I think the quality of today\\\'s dvd is much better.  I will try ripping a recent movie like Transformers that has high quality/technical components and converting it to AVI using my converter (DVDFAB Platinum 3 on High quality export).  Right now, I am just looking for ways to get my quality of AVI files to the same level as the renowned movie idol AXXO.  If anyone knows what software he uses to produce his hight quality AVI files, please let me know.  I have a huge library of dvd\\\'s (600+) to rip from and share. Any requests will be considered a compliment.


                               Sincerely,

                                            Montannasdad

ps.  I chose this movie, because it was not alreay on TPB
