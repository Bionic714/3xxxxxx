,bibblytub,2008-03-23T03:36Z,"Don't waste your time downloading this torrent.
The entire tutorial is just a copy/paste of the tutorial from the How To Draw Manga website, that's existed for many, many years (I used to use it over 5 years ago).
http://www.cablenet.ne.jp/~japanime/tutorial/fbodymain.html
Which can be found by going to www.howtodrawmanga.com and clicking ""Lessons"" at the top, then ""Female Figure Drawing"".
The uploader could've atleast given credit where it was due."

,artie85,2009-04-27T15:24Z,"DO NOT download this if you are advanced illustrator. This anatomy sucks even for highschool. 

If you wish to learn to draw anatomy and actually be good at it - then this is not the stuff you would want to practice with. "
,ninja_n_pirate,2009-09-21T13:18Z,"hmm a quick download... Ty..

as for the quality of the book. It's alright. It seems like a book someone made for a highschool class or something.

Thx abyways arunthealmighty!"
