I was hoping we could possibly get a seed on this please, I'm stuck at like 89.3%. 
I'd actually buy this one but I can't find it on shelves.
nice upload btw. It's really nice to be able to find classics when you need em. If it weren't for ppl like you, we'd be stuck with the trendiest latest crap and the classics would die off."
