Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam Vs. Zeta Gundam (Playstation 2)

Seven years after the end of the devastating One Year War.... 
The victorious Earth Federation has become corrupt and oppressive, 
and the elite Titans police force has taken on dictatorial powers. 
As the A.E.U.G. rebel group struggles to defeat the Titans, the heroes 
and villains of the original Mobile Suit Gundam series find themselves 
on the same side of this new conflict. The focus, however, is on a new 
hero named Kamille Bidan, the pilot of the transforming Zeta Gundam.
