,far_isle,2008-03-02T17:42Z,Love this old nostalgia stuff - and if it has planes - then even better.  Anyone have any other episodes?  Might make a nice collection to add to my aviation series of meda.  Thnx Flixer for the upload!
,far_isle,2008-03-02T17:44Z,"meda?  Duh - medIa!

Also, ton of us stuck at 38.8% on Just Planes - Air Greenland.  Shows lots of excellent views of that far off land - anyone know where to get the rest of the file?  I have been asking around, in the hopes that someone might be able to find it.  Thanks again."

Little did she know that it was just Penny that kept our interest - it was a good tv show and better than Lash LaRue. 
Thank you and of course I'll seed."
