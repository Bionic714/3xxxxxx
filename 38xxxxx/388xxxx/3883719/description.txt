Includes both the GNS530 and GNS430 units, which have been completely re-designed using the latest XML programming techniques making them fully functional in FSX and maintaining backwards compatibility with FS2004 while keeping the gauges extremely Frame Rate Friendly!

Additional features have been implemented as well, making the product more functional and realistic when compared to their real world counterparts. While still considered a "Gaming Product" these units will look, feel and respond much more accurately then previous versions. In addition, there is almost unlimited configuration possibilities, meaning that you can install your units in any manner you like, such as the standard 530/430 stack, twin 430s or almost any combination in-between. You can also Mix-And-Match any gauges in the Series X product line, giving you even more possible configurations.

 Service Release 2 - NOW WITH TCAS Added to the GNS530.
