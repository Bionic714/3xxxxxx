Here are some old CD's of medieval music for your listening pleasure -- some of which have been out of print for more than a decade. Track information and cover art may not be available for all of them.

To prevent the problems with tag corruption that plagued my last attempt to share this fine old music with you, I have wrapped each torrent into a single .rar file. I will be seeding five of them, so be sure to amaze your friends and collect them all.  :D

This torrent includes:

Early Music at Wik (Joculatores Upsalienses)
The Four Seasons (Joculatores Upsalienses)
Woods, Women & Wine (Joculatores Upsalienses)
English Songs of the Middle Ages (Sequentia Ensemble)
The Ancient Miracles (Ensemble Fur Fruhe Musik Augsburg)

All are high quality rips at 320 kB or better! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!
