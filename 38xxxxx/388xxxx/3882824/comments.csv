,jimolina,2008-03-27T02:43Z,"I just lost ALL my music, including Gbs of ancient wonders due to disk failure...
I couldn't quite tell you how grateful I am...

musica et vinum, laetare cor hominum"
,Rivenshield,2008-04-04T08:23Z,"I feel your pain, Jim. Went through the same thing myself late last year.... and couldn't help thinking if something horrible should happen to this huge box of out-of-print CD's, this would be the only place they'd survive...

You're more than welcome. Keep seeding.  ;)"
,Lautrec77,2008-06-29T15:15Z,"Wow! So pleased to find this, A psychotic ex gf of mine played frisbee with all my Joculatores CD's after I broke up with her.

I have missed them so much but the ridiculous pricing on importing them put me off replacing them. Hope someone is seeding, I know I'll keep doing it for a good while if this downloads.

Thank you for uploading this mate, a treasure indeed!"
,Thalinor,2009-02-11T04:10Z,"Note to people who are thinking about DL thir or any other torrents by ths guy; he does not include complete albums.  Every album is missing half the tracks.  I have no idea why he is being such an ass.  By his own words these are out of print and impossible to find music, its not like you are going to be saving some record co money.  This guy is just some small cock asshole on a power trip trying to feel special by holding half albums over peoples heads.

The worst part is you dont tell people in the ""about this torrent"" you are missing half the files.  If this was by accident (or its all you have) I would understand but its just you being a cock sucker."
,Rivenshield,2009-02-19T08:07Z,"No Thalinor, you utter horse's ass, NO. When I put up torrents of out of print music you get the whole thing. Sorry it's beyond a narcisstic teenage crybaby like you to accept a free gift graciously. "
,harrydick,2012-01-29T16:35Z,"Thalinor is correct.  Half the songs are missing from this torrent.  You could have labeled this as a sampler or something, but you make yourself out to be a liar."
