,gr8bishie,2008-03-17T23:14Z,"sigh... dl'd this mainly for Radical Dreamers. Cuz the Chrono Series is like an orgasm for a gamer fanboy like me. Mike Tyson punchout is a pretty cool bonus, tho."

,twynfeyr,2008-04-23T03:48Z,"Hey oneWorld... you ever check the other side of the Tibet/china story?

Take a few seconds out of your day and question what you see on TV and read in the newspapers.  Always remember it's the media's job to sensationalize everything.  cause let's face it.  the war in the middle east is definately last year's news.

Secondly, they've been trying to free tibet for like 30 years or some shit, but i'm sure your signs on a piece of wood with the words ""Free Tibet"" will work this time.  Yup, people are dieing for their beliefs in the world, but your support at a politcal rally will do some good i'm sure.  Make sure you scream really really loud and someone in the chinese embassy might hear you... they still won't give two shits, but good luck with that all the same.

OOOoooo, I've got a better idea, how about all you bleeding heart right wingers do a mass suicide, like one of those weird Alabama cults; you could all cut off your testicles first and wave them around in a display of defiance and solidarity right before you all die and are buried in a huge unmarked grave on which I will piss.

You and the rest of the spammers of the world can fuck off!

Long live PirateBay!!!!!!

@kaare125 - i totally agree that TPB is a place for downloading, and there are better places to post political thoughts... but calm down man... some people just rant wherever they can... best thing to do is be the bigger person and completely ignore it... move on to the next torrent... and keep pirating alive

@SaorEire - for you buddy... maybe we should nuke where you're from... and then we can nuke the 'holy' lands... maybe tibet too... seriously though... us american citizens don't all follow that f**k up Bush.  I'm totally against him and all his policies... totally against the 'war'... and totally against bashing on people from other places... i have to put up with this same stuff online playing Call of Duty 4, and it's just plain getting old.  I hate to write such a long comment, but this needs to be heard.  If us americans are such jerks, then why is it that folks from other countries are always the first ones to act like a jerk towards me?  I have no problem with any country or their peoples.  So, please, think before you speak (or write) and realize that there are good and bad people wherever you go... don't lump us together.  We're not all fat, lazy, hate-mongers here in the US... and for those that don't believe it... I'm 24, 5'8'', and I weigh 135 lbs.  So, like I said, and this goes for americans too, just take a lil time to think before you make harsh generalazations and rant about it on a site for downloading torrents.

I have scanned the files using the latest McAfee dat files on my Mac OS X system. I was also able to unpack all the exe files by opening them as if they were zip files, and I scanned the contents separately. I also looked up the virus descriptions and manually searched for some of the identifying strings with out success. This does not mean I am saying there is no virus, just that I have been unable to find it so far. Has anyone else scanned the download? If so, with what antivirus scanner and what database version?"

Note that even though I am running on a Macintosh, my virus scanner should have detected any PC viruses in these files. I have now scanned the files using two different virus scanners (virex and ClamXav) and have been unable to detect the virus that is supposedly in GamesDOS.exe...

I would like to see some posts from other users with their scanning results, and the software they used to scan. (Especially the fellow claiming to have detected the virus). Other wise I'll just have to keep trying different virus scanners and spamming, er, I mean posting the results (or lack there of) here until I either find the bloody virus or at least one other user (any other user) responds with their results...

If you are getting ""filesystem size limit"" errors, you are probably running Win 95/98 that use the FAT32 file system, and cannot store any single file over 4Gb. Solution - upgrade to an operating system above Win2000 that uses the NTSC file system."
