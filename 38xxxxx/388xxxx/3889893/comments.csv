I'm from the U.K. and would happily kill Americans or British even in a 'game' if an arab made it lol but unfortunately there isn't one.  Agree not all arabs are terrorists but not all wetserners are infadel scum lmao agree a person fighting for arab religion game would prob not make to market because the people in charge of such things and the majority do not have the forsight and are loose religious/racial bigots however try to see past obvious stereotyping mate it is a 'GAME' ;)  As for your mention of killing religion arab religion has hardcore groups that is reason west goes there they don't send hardcore bible belt fighters from U.S. in some sort of 'crusade' and just happens that the misguided arabs that cause the fuss think they are doing because they think the U.S. are, it maybe appears game programers think they do too :( !"

,18Zulukiller,2007-11-24T14:44Z,"Anyone wanting to play this online its a peace of piss dont bother with that hamichi shit in the other torrents . Just follow the instructions to install the game and then run the multiplayer link,then click join game.

On the multiplayer screen click on souce untill it shows favourites. Then click on new favourite ,then press ALT + TAB key togethor on your keyboard and open up your web browser and go here.

http://www.game-monitor.com/search.php?search=cracked&type=server&game=cod4

Thats a list of every cracked cod4 server if you want you can even change the search peramitters so you find servers in your country so you have a low ping. Anyway once you've got your list of servers click on the name of one you fancy and write down the i.p. . Then press ALT + TAB to go back to the game, when in the game you should have the box for a new favourite type in the i.p. you got of games monitor and click add. It should then appear in the list of favourites just double click onit and if theres room you should be able to join the server. 

You only have to do this once btw once its in your favourites its in there forever so then you just double click to play online. 

P.S. This is manily to help out the noobs,as its much easier to do this than to manually scroll through the list in the server browser looking for cracked or no cd key in the server name. 

Hope this helps you all out with the online bit anyway peace ..V    "
,GULGA,2007-11-24T19:46Z,All CoD4 server---> X-fire
,ljoslin,2007-11-24T22:51Z,"I'm seeding, but no one is downloading?!   I have 800+k/s output so the file is out there, come and get it!"
,18Zulukiller,2007-11-25T12:32Z,"Gulga mate i get were your coming from but the filter in xfire isnt that great. As in if i type cracked into the server name bit in the xfire filter only servers with cracked at the begging of there name shows up. However if you use game monitor and put cracked into the filter any server with cracked anywhere in there name will appear (i.e. i get 5 servers in xfire but 121 cracked servers on games monitor). Plus theres also the added fact that games monitor refreshes in like a second but xfire takes ages for the servers list to fill. Aww well i suppose its down to a matter of taste.

P.S. Thank you very much for such a classy torrent fella your star man and it is seriously appreciated ;-).     "
,Krusaderz,2007-11-26T05:19Z,"The instructions are vague to say the least for you newbies so listen up! 
1) Extract the files from the iso. with a program such as isobuster.
2) Open the file with the razor logo. (one of the four files you downloaded from this site. Use the keygen to generate a # and write that # down you'll need it later.
3) Go to where you extracted the files to with isobuster (usually my documents) find the setup file double click on it and install the game.
4) After you are done installing close the game. then hit start; my computer; program files; activision; call of duty four. now you should see a bunch of files and folders like main docs etc. keep this window open and go to where the 4 files are you downloaded from this site. grab and drag the one that says iw3sp into the other window you have open and drop it.
5) It should say this file already exists do you want to replace it? click yes.
6)Now right click on that file and go to send to desktop; create shortcut. now there is a shortcut that says shortcut to iw3sp on your desktop, erase all other cod4 shortcuts that were put on there during the game installation.
7) Double click on shortcut to iw3sp and the game should begin loading and your ready to play.  and just use this shortcut to access the game from now on.

Remember if you enjoy this game go out and buy it to support the people who designed it ;)
Hope this helped anyone who was having trouble and enjoy its an awesome game."

,salem582,2011-08-04T20:26Z,"Hope this helps everyone. It's basically a list of your problems and solutions. 

1. Key Code in use

Sorry but you can't play on public servers. Either buy the game or do this: Under the Esc key on your keyboard, to the left of your '1' key, is a button. While you are on the multiplayer menu, press this key and a green bar with a cursor will pop up. Easy thing is, type this: 'connect [server ip]'. In order to get a private server's ip, is go onto a couple of websites but I use, http://www.private-servers.info/CallOfDuty4DE.html

2. Please insert CD/DVD

This is very simple. All you have to do is go onto some trusted websites and download the iw3sp.exe file. Keep replacing the file until the damn thing runs. 

3. The program cant start becase mss32.dll is missing.

Similar to the previous error. Just google and  download the fucking file. 

4. Different version (Should be 1.7 at the moment)

Here's a site that might help. You will need the 1.6 patch before the 1.7. 

1.6- http://www.gamershell.com/download_27186.shtml (282 MB)

1.7- http://www.gamershell.com/download_28304.shtml (37 MB)

,nick9498,2011-09-05T19:45Z,Alright guys. This is one of the best torrents on here. Its no that complicated. Also the trojan that everyone is getting is the key gen Antiviruses read it as a trojan.
,AdIVe,2011-09-09T12:19Z,"If people are getting the error to insert the correct CD when they attempt to play the singleplayer game. This will probably be down to the fact that you have updated to one of the most recent patches  so you can play online and the patch would have changed the singleplayer.exe. 

If this is the case simply re paste the singleplayer.exe file from this torrent back into the main folder folder.  

And voila your single player should work fine and your multiplayer remains patched with 1.7 to play on the current servers.

Hope this helps guys.

Great torrent  "

,Alipa,2011-09-12T19:59Z,"Can someone help i cant play multiplayer.
When i start iw3sp it says=
Run in Safe Mode?
It appears that call of duty 4:modern warfare did not quit properly the last time it ran.
Do you want to run the gam in safe mode?

This is recommended for most people.
It will change your system settings but not your controls.

YES     NO      CANCEL

,SirSangi,2011-09-28T06:06Z,"So because the description didn't say this is razor1911, I end up having a fucktarded razor splashscreen on a second game now.

Anyone know how to remove this shit or replace it with something more tolerable?

There are plenty of providers here who eren't egotistic assholes who like to shove their dick in your face every time you start a game, so don't start with the ""ungreatful fuck buy the game then"" shit."
