,InZaniXoN,2007-11-23T14:35Z,"Thx !!! Really nice !!! I miss aXXo :'(

@ bernard90
Download VLAN Media Player (aka VLC Media Player) and install it... When finishing that, you'll have to give the .sub-file the same name as the movie... Example: The.Bourne.Ultimatum[2007]DvDrip[Eng]-aXXo.avi
Then u rename the subtitle file to:
The.Bourne.Ultimatum[2007]DvDrip[Eng]-aXXo.sub

After that just start VLC Media Player and enjoy the movie !! It should work now (;"

I've had success with many AVIs playing on my dvd player. Some reason the last couple of movies I have downloaded have not worked on my dvd player and I cant seem to figure out why. It gets to the menu screen but when I click on the movie from the menu it just freezes. Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated."

,double_b26,2007-12-24T15:13Z,"nidalapfun - you might try cleaning your dvd burner.  you can run one of those laser lens cleanser discs through it a few times (the ones with the little brushes on the playing side).  also, make sure you are using a decent quality dvd.  if you have switched brands recently, go back to the ones that were reliable.

Get DVD Flick, which is free, or ConvertxToDVD and convert the AVI to a DVD that will play in your standalone player. Nero Vision can do that too. There are a billion guides available. Check Afterdawn(dot)com."
,TheInfiniteChange,2008-05-03T12:54Z,"DoobieX, its very simple to put some subtitles on it yourself. Go to www.ondertitel.com, look for the film, there's probably an aXXosubtitlefile there or else just try some subtitles and see if it fits in the film (time).. Just put the film and the subtitle file in the same map and give it the same name et voilà. That's it (but don't forget when you change the name to put .avi and .srt after it or else you'll get some message that it can damage the film blablablah)"

Awsome ... just a shame they didnt use the same director as the first movie, which was the best by a mile ! 

To convert this to play on a DVD player, use Nero vison, its part of Nero 7 premium, just download it off a torrent and use nero vision to convert it. Its very easy ! but will take about 4 hours to do. ( does on mine anyhoo )"
