,ibmercurial,2012-06-26T03:31Z,Silly movie. I saw it in the late 90's. wife and I watched again last night. The download took quite a while but the quality both audio and video was good enough to watch through computer hdmi hookup. If you liked this movie the quality is worth the wait. thanks for uploading
