 stuck at 1.1 %"
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-13T11:33Z,"Believe me, it is being seeded. This is a very large torrent and I'm the only one right now who has the whole thing, be patient and it'll make its rounds.

Cue it up, leave it on, come back in a few days."
,Nikadi,2007-11-13T19:42Z,Which files are for which EP? I have all EP's and just want the SP's?
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-13T21:44Z,"Nikadi, this torrent is intended for those who don't have anything and want everything. The reason the archive is segmented into RARs is because 1) it chopped about 2 Gigs off the total archive size and 2) I don't want people picking off a single part of it and not seeding the entire thing.

MetalRose, read before you post.

JHawx, ...what?"
,steff_ice,2007-11-13T22:26Z,Great torrent! Multilang? [swedish?]
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-14T00:28Z,"steff_ice, everything except for Nightlife, which is only three languages for some reason. If you install past Nightlife then the newer language packs will overwrite the old ones giving you a Swedish option again."
,theangeldescent,2007-11-14T02:34Z,"i wouldn't spend my time waiting for this one. use the one from bassgoonist. i've used his before and it's always worked great.  you can get separate ep's as well.

,Sunknui,2007-11-14T02:41Z,"Need to Bypass the key check? This will do it!

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3890097/EA_Games_Keybypass_(EA_games_only).3890097.TPB.torrent"
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-14T03:37Z,"theangeldecent, this torrent is based off his previous collection torrent, it's just much more complete even compared to the new one. I created this archive because everytime I see one of these get uploaded the same questions get asked over and over again because the instructions are vague and confusing. Plus if you bothered to read, I checked every single ISO and crack to make sure it works. This is the one you want if you don't want to have to to go find a fix for some of the files like I did the one you're linking to.

Sunknui, a keygen has been included in this torrent for all included games, and it has been tested. Works perfectly, as I said above I designed this archive so that once you have it you won't need to download anything else."
,theangeldescent,2007-11-14T03:58Z,"i've read what you have. i'm not one to post anything without reading. no offense to anyone, but i think the instructions are pretty self explanatory, unless you have completely no idea what you're doing. and i haven't had to find any fixes whatsoever for any of the files. 

i'm not talking down on what you're doing, i was just letting people know that if they only want certain ep's or sp's with a decent number of seeds, that was the place to go."
,ManiKatti,2007-11-15T01:23Z,"AeronPrometheus, I couldn't help but mock at how you treat others. People these days have high demands for something, and they won't waste days or maybe weeks to download it all. I wouldn't act all-knowing either, as you did not buy or own ANY of these things included in your pack. If you want, I can clearly shout out each and every detail on where you got each and any thing from.

For example, you got everything from bassgoonist. That's all I need to say. And yes guys, if you don't want to download the whole back, get bassgoonist's. The only thing you probably changed was the instructions, which ANYBODY with ANY sufficient knowledge about mounting or burning could have EASILY done.

Don't pretend your all-knowing. Cause, you aren't.

If anyone wants JUST the keygen, search TPB for ""EA Games Keygen""
And for Daemon Tools, google for Daemon Tools.

And for now, the only place to get the additional Sims 2 content is bassgoonist's. But that is unfortunately, a slow torrent. If you JUST want the Sims 2 DVD, then I remember it being in a torrent somewhere in TPB. It completes overnight EASILY."
,ManiKatti,2007-11-15T01:26Z,"Oh, and the keygen DOES NOT support Teen Style Stuff yet. That's cause Team FFF hasn't released the next keygen yet. It will probably be released around November 20 or so. I bet his keygen for Teen Style Stuff is A RELOADED KEYGEN LOCATED IN THE CRACK FOLDER ON THE DISK... Or wait, maybe he doesn't even have one. Ooh. I ain't downloading this sh*t to find out.

Reason why Nightlife isn't Multi-Lang? Its cause its the Chinese version. Nobody seems to have released a Multi-Lang version of Nightlife yet.

Oh and AeronPrometheus, don't try to reply to me. It just means you admit your all wrong and your just trying to prove yourself right even though you arent."
,ManiKatti,2007-11-15T01:37Z,"Wait, the additional content isn't from bassgoonist. I remember it being from somewhere else though. Oh, and if any of you are planning on updating the expansions, the cracks won't work after that. The only updated crack is Bon Voyage.

Oh and AeronPrometheus, if you want a more complete expansion, you should try this.

Install Sims 2, update, install University, update, install Nightlife, update, install OfB, update, etc. And when you get to Bon Voyage, update, crack. That way, you'll have all the updates in place.

And yes, I have contacted EA Games, they say you NEED all the updates for the other expansions and not just Bon Voyage. The problems will still exist anyway if you don't. Expansions don't fix older expansions problems apparently.

You don't need cracks for stuff packs. They always reverse and tell you to simply use the latest EXPANSION you installed. Its stupid, I know.

And if your reading, the reason he doesn't have a crack for University and Nightlife is because, he has the same Mini Image as everyone else. Mini Image = a smaller sized file which is the same as the normal iso or whatever file, but only the files that the game checks are on it. It saves a lot of space.

Oh, and if you want to satisfy MANY people, and not feel all excluded and shamed because I just said this, you should try and seperate everything. I know you feel you need to put it all together, but getting popular DOES NOT work that way. Always start with basic let-people-choose kinds of torrents.

Your probably wondering, why the fu*k don't you host something. That's cause, I got caught by the MPAA once. I don't want anything to do with them.

You could start with releasing the additional stuff as a completely separate torrent. Many people would probably like that."
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-15T05:40Z,"theangeldecent, I know, I'm doing this because I want to help. And since this is my first torrent (not only of this data but ever) I expect that I'll have a list of things that change the next time around. I appreciate you being helpful, I'm sure the other readers do to. :P"
,Mops3n,2007-11-15T22:02Z,seed ppl download speed is less than 1kb/s!!
,ManiKatti,2007-11-16T00:38Z,"AeronPrometheus, if its possible, could you maybe host the Addition Stuff DVD as a seperate torrent? Mmk thanks."
,emax3,2007-11-16T12:08Z,connection error conection refused after 521mb downloaded. This has happened 3 times already
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-18T10:45Z,"emax3, let it sit, it will periodically stop downloading because you've gotten as much of it as everyone else. I'm sending data to about 50 different people round-robin style so as they get new data from me, you'll get new data from them."
,Mops3n,2007-11-18T16:48Z,why cant any1 seed?! just leave it over the night... the download speed is less than 1kb/s
,RytLad,2007-11-18T17:15Z,"Im very new how do i download this ? 
with what program should i use im frm the uk"
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-19T21:50Z,"RytLad, I recommend uTorrent. http://www.utorrent.com/

Just download the file linked here, open it in uTorrent and let it do the work."
,Hassonn,2007-11-20T19:48Z,"HEY pleazz seed

i promise i will seed when it is finnish

Thank you"
,RobertoNor,2007-11-21T18:34Z,"AeronPrometheus.
Thank you very much for this super torrent:)
Unfortunately, ppl virtually living for critisism and negative complaining have found their way here too....
For each one of these morons there are 10 grateful ones like me!
Keep up the good work:)

Question: Do you ""superseed"" / ""initial seed""?"
,ManiKatti,2007-11-22T00:56Z,"@RobotoNor: I don't usually criticize. Its just that Aeron was pretending he's so smart and shit I had to prove him wrong.

This torrent is still low seeding, so if you want to play ASAP, get the one from bassgoonist. It's slightly quicker. You only need this if you want the bonus stuff. The newest version of Team FFF's keygen 159 is available at the RESURRECTiON forums."
,theangeldescent,2007-11-22T02:14Z,that and the fact that you can get each part individually from bassgoonist if you already have some of the stuff...
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-22T06:41Z,"RobertNor, Thanks, I really appreciate your kind words. Nice to know there are grateful people out there. One kind person outweighs a thousand deadbeats. ^_^

Yes, it's being super-seeded, and I'm watching it pick up speed so as time goes on it'll just get faster and faster.

So huge, this torrent... So small, my bandwidth :P"
,RobertoNor,2007-11-22T12:27Z,"Actually, this game isn't for me...
But for a neighbor, she's 12 yrs, her mother is a single parent with two children.
As one can imagine, being alone with the responsibility for two teenagers isn't too easy or cheap. 
Living in Norway is quite expensive, I'm often over at her place and help them out with small stuff like fixing computer problems and different ""male"" jobs around the house.
-AeronPrometheus, you can be sure the kids there will be thrilled with joy with this installled on their computer as SIMS is her wish for Christmas!
And her happiness is because of your upload:)"
,frankieblackman,2007-11-23T00:19Z,"So explain to me why the fuck I waould want to seed out 5:1? I've u/l'd an entire full copy of the game and am sitting at 20% Hey assholes, quit setting you uploads to 1 or 2 fucking k per second and maybe if all 8 of you gave 60 k per second like I tried to do, we'd have all finished by now. You leechers are a stain on good torrent users everywhere"
,frankieblackman,2007-11-23T00:20Z,and I cancelled the download so all you assholes that were sucking up my bandwidth can get fucked

,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-29T08:44Z,"Notcow, You won't need to burn any of this to CD or DVD... If that's what you want to do, I cannot guarantee any of the images will copy correctly. This is meant to install from your hard drive, as you discovered, the instructions will lead the way.

MasterDJ, Pictures? You mean the disc images? Yes.

hoho007, Thank you kind Sir."

i have 2 mb ineternet speed is that to slow ?"
,MasterDJ,2007-11-30T15:25Z,AeronPrometheus Im talking about the Pictures/objects in the actual game...when I play it there are lots of missing objects...you can buy a certain object but you cant place it nor see it...I downloaded the game from bassgoonist...same happened to other guys who downloaded that torrent...they can play it but there's missing objects...that's why Im askin if you dont have that kind of problem in this torrent of yours....thanks you very much man!
,AeronPrometheus,2007-11-30T20:51Z,"dunderochbrak, A while, turn it on and let it sit.

MasterDJ, I honestly have only had that happen after I start screwing with the game code and cause the whole game to crash. Uninstall everything and reinstall, cause I never had that kind of problem with Bass' files."
,AndyMoo,2007-12-01T02:18Z,"i downloaded up to pets last year i think it was and then seperately downloaded the addons up to the latest (bon Voage). installed them all tonight then installed the crack for bon voyage, and it ran but then i noticed there was weird squares on the terrains with what looked like writting on? missing images? also when i went to make a new sim and clicked on the add sim button thing it crashed and said had to shut it off! anyone know anything about this? i updated my graphics drivers just incase but it still did the same

ive uninstalled bon voyage and installed a crack for seasons now so gunna see if i can play that untill this collection of sims has downloaded


you say it works fine with no problems?"
,AeronPrometheus,2007-12-01T13:38Z,"AndyMoo, I've repeatedly installed this collection on multiple computers, you won't have that issue here. Plus you'll get to pick whichever packs you do or do not want to use."

I lost all my Sims 2 games when I moved and I really didn't want to shell out the money to buy new ones. I downloaded a couple different torrents and they didn't work, don't know if it was because of vista or the torrent itself. I'm hoping this one works, thanks again!"

I have downloaded a single game and Installed it and it worked but the files were in MDF and MDS format and I had to run it with sd4hide and it worked. But this one is new for me but i would like to get it working. There is no Sims 2 Open for Business CD ISO in the folder, and no Stuff pack CD ISOs in the folder. Since the Stuff packs don't work, I stopped at The Sims 2 Bon Voyage. I don't know how and where to Replace the Sims2EP6.exe with cracked Sims2EP6.exe. With in the Downloaded package OR from the downloaded package to the Installed package that is located in the program files and how to do it. Thank you again."

newslang67, You're welcome and thank you. ^_^

jgag123, You're welcome. If files are missing delete the extracted data and re-unarchive it. I actually did an installation on another computer from the RAR'd files and, again, everything works perfectly. It is a lot of data after all."

I would try to get it running without that if it's possible.
I installed bon voyage and teen style stuff.

But this is not clear to me: 
If you wish to stop here and you have installed The Sims 2 Bon Voyage, replace Sims2EP6.exe in the installation directory with the cracked version of Sims2EP6.exe included in The Sims 2 Bon Voyage folder. 

Replace the Sims2EP6.exe in the folder that is in program files (I cant find it), with the crack exe that is in what folder? I can't find the crack files  either for any of the versions.

If the files are corrupt, you'll need to re-unarchive everything from the beginning, and make sure you have the latest version of WinRAR (http://www.rarlabs.com/). Some computers have trouble handling the sheer amount of data being unarchived so it fails to checksum everything and corrupted files get through. You'll just have to keep trying until it works."

,Mariuk,2007-12-12T19:00Z,"Hi!

I have some problems with this game. 
I install it and that works perfekt, but when i play the game, the body's become invisible and i get blue triangels and black area where the sim is. And i can only see the head, not the hole person. That's when i have to turn it of, and when i turn it on again, it's ok for about 5 min, but then the problem come again.. 

sombody that know what i can do with this? "
,AeronPrometheus,2007-12-12T21:49Z,"For people with video display issues you need to consider that there's another problem with your system. Consider that 90% of computers connected to the internet are infected with something.

Update your virus scanners and do an entire system sweep, run a spyware scan, update your graphic card drivers (My Computer will tell you what graphics card you have (Right click, Properties, Devices)), download CCleaner (http://www.ccleaner.com/) and run both the clean and registry tabs telling it to fix everything it finds. That's all the help I can offer without physically standing over your computer. If the installation is still corrupt, delete everything, run CCleaner, restart the computer, and un-archive the RARs again. If you do that repeatedly and still have problems put the RARs back where they were downloaded to and run the torrent again (This will perform a MD5 check of all the files and if there's a flaw you'll see it start to download small packets of data again).

You also need to consider you system can't handle The Sims 2, a game that requires a pretty up to date system to play nicely.

,DarkMaster77,2007-12-17T16:52Z,"hi! im having a problem here. the thing is that for some reason i cant seem to run the ea installer. i dont think this is a problem with the game but with my system, because i had this problem with two different releases of battle for middle earth (which has ea installer). first i thought that it might be something to do with admin rights. i have xp installed with admin rights in my account n everythingh so there shouldnt be any problems like many ppl have in vista with uac, right? tried executing in compatibility mode but nothing happened. it just doesnt do anything. i followed the steps you included AeronPrometheus, even tried mounting with poweriso, extracting.. 

ive searched everywhere for this issue but the only ppl that had something like this was because they had vista with uac. also there is a similar option in xp that says ""run as"" which says run as admin but i dont have a password, it doesnt accept a blank one, even tried creating one, but it refuses it.

could someone help me out with this..?"

,AeronPrometheus,2007-12-22T07:08Z,"NOTICE: The initial seed of this pack will be taken down permanently on December 25th. From then on it's up to the downloaders to seed and when it dies, it dies.

I'm working on a 1.5 version of this pack that will clean up some errors I made and make the installation instructions clearer for people (cause it wasn't enough for some of you it seems). Then the newer seed will be made available here just as the first, look for it after the new year starts. If anyone has suggestions or would like to ask that certain addons be included in the mix tell me so here, and tell me soon.

I won't delete the torrent page but the initial seed will no longer transmit data on December 25th. After a short time an updated seed will take its place.

This will be my final post. I didn't get a whole lot of real feedback but I do have good material for the FAQ and noticed some errors on my part in the general instructions that, apparently, confused a lot of you. I also have fresh downloads and pieces parts that I want to include in the whole.

Almost 200 comments, wow. I must have done something right. It also appears that there are still several high speed seeds keeping the torrent alive, that is a tremendous show of support.

Thank you to every who thanked me, had nice things to say, helped other commenters out, and dedicated bandwidth to seeding this monster. You'll see a new torrent pop up shortly.

,tspencer,2008-03-10T20:24Z,"@ Devious

The error that the file name is too long is due to the location of the torrent on your machine. The path to the torrent, in combonation with the already long names in the torrent itself are whats messing you up. Make a folder on C and make it short like C:/temp then move the RAR there and extract to there, just having that short start will keep the TOTAL file path under 256 chars or whatever its problem was. I had the same problem a long time ago, its because your path goes into C.documents.dev.azures.. bla blaa, just move it to a C:\temp to cut out all that extra path making the file too long. I am about to download this for the misses, and saw your comment, I hope this reply helps. I also saw some comments that .iso's were missing all together? I seen others say the torrent is fine, are the missing iso's noobs fault or is the torrent infact missing iso's?  Thanks. tspencer."
,tspencer,2008-03-10T20:27Z,"Also I will confirm that when it says it needs to update the Sims 2 after a expansion pack install, just UNMOUNT the one thats there, and MOUNT the one it needs. Then it will do what it needs to just fine. Its a total pain, but what needs to be done to get past all that. Just thought I would second that is the correct method.

PS Dev, let me know if that change of the path works for you, or if you even saw my response.

I once had a problem with all of those DAMNED .r some number files, and i got no answer om my desperate call for help so i had to work it out on my own and it took me 2 days now im helping others.


First you need ""WINrar"" to open those damned files.

somewhere in the hell of files there should be a file named ""thesims2completecollection.rar""
the important is the .rar file.
When you have found that open it with ""WINrar""
select your destination folder and then unpack it.
now there shoul in your destination folder be a lot of folder each with different addons.
open the sims 2 folder and mount the .iso file with daemon or poweriso or something.

There you go do that with all the folders and you are ready to go. if any other problems write to me at msn/email  to  jeppe_carlsen@yahoo.dk
and i will try to help

you might need to put the .exe files in all the filders into your installation folder too"

this is the problem - you arent going to like it, i had the same problem its down to seasons, (not the download)
all the other eps ran fine until i got to seasons, the reason it is saying you need to have direct x 9 installed is because it means the GRAPHICS CARD ITSELF MUST SUPORT DIRECT X 9 OR HIGHER, unfortunately if you cannot upgrade your graphics card ( i also had radeon ) you will need a new pc/laptop or just have to live without seasons :( - i opted for a new laptop :) it works fine now!

As far as this not working... well I mounted with Alcohol 120% and had no problems with installation. As far as loading/graphics issues I had to set all my settings a bit lower on my card's preferences because it's an older graphics card but that's about it. it's an nVidia... so maybe it's ATI people that are having a problem?

After downloading this torrent I received an email from my internet provider, and i'm not to familiar with all the Torrent terms, but it appears they have a tracker in the torrent or a checksum or hash or something. The bottom line is that they understood that I tried to ""illegally"" download this game, and they were threatening to remove the internet from my house unless the aforementioned files were removed in 3 days. 

The email was legit, I asked a family friend who works for the internet provider, so i just thought I'd warn everyone in the U.S. Not sure if COX Internet is available everywhere, but they're jumping on this shit."

,waterdawl,2008-04-25T01:45Z,"Hi there...
Everything from this torrent was running smoothly until I got to The Sims 2 Open for Business, Family Fun Stuff, and Glamour Life stuff. For some reason, when I try to mount any of those 3 iso files that I previously mentioned, I get an error saying ""The Sims 2 Open for Business.iso(or Family Fun Stuff, etc.) The above file name is invalid."" When I try to mount any of the other expansion pack iso files, it works just fine. But I really want those three that aren't working!
I didn't change anything and I was following the instructions very closely. Any help is appreciated.
Not sure if I'm the only one who's having this problem.... I haven't sorted through all 430 replies. I'll post again if I get this resolved."
,waterdawl,2008-04-25T02:34Z,"Okay, so I moved the folder with all of the installation files in it to a different folder (it was in MyDocuments before and I moved it to just C:\. I think some of the filenames and names of folders are too long for some computers to handle), and now it works. XD Sorry about that."
,Nessa87,2008-04-25T20:49Z,"HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP!

Okay so I am almost done installing everything that I want(for now). I stopped at Teen Style stuff. I DIDN'T install Bon Voyage. So the instructions say to replace Sims2EP5.exe in the installation directory with the CRACKED version of Sims2EP5.exe included in The Sims 2 Seasons folder. I was trying and trying. And honestly I don't know what the hell to do. I found the cracked folder with the cracke version, and I found the regular version( i guess ). So HOW THE HELL DO I REPLACE IT???
Please help me. Everything else is done. This is all I need help with."
,Nessa87,2008-04-25T21:14Z,"I just don't know how to replace the one in installation directory with the cracked one. I still need help. OMG I'm so irritated. How come everyone else can figure this shit out, but me?! "

,roonilwaslib,2008-04-27T01:23Z,"Nessa, the original one is in the TSBin folder of whicever the last one you installed is ""(Fashion Stuff"" I would guess). 

Delete the old Sims2SP5 file. Copy the new one and paste it in the folder where you deleted the old one.

That should do it. I've got it installed on two computers now and that's what I did."
,roonilwaslib,2008-04-27T01:26Z,"Aeron, thanks for uploading! All files installed, patched, and working. Well worth the wait. You rock.

If anyone else has the same problem I did with extracting all the files (some wouldn't extract properly), try closing your torrent app and extracting to a different folder. Worked fine after that. All files are present and accounted for. If some of yours are missing try a little problem solving, it's not the torrent's fault."

,clubberlang1,2008-04-27T20:33Z,Hi i downloaded this torrent and installed the 1st game only. The sims 2. So i can play through them one at a time. The only problem is the build mode i can build anything with this torrent so does anyone know a way around this as its a pretty big part of the game. I have searched around the internet and i found a different no cd crack to use but when i overwrite the old one and try to start the game i get an error saying something about emulation software detected.

For anyone who gets an error after the video clip before playing, it's probably because you havn't replaced the original .exe with the cracked .exe. The original .exe is found in TSBIN of the respective  expansion pack folder. Don't just copy into the expansion pack folder.
Hope this helps."

I was reluctant to download because of all of the retarded comments but gave it a shot anyway.

THIS DOWNLOAD WORKS. IF YOU CANNOT MAKE IT WORK, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG.

Aeron included a set of very clear instructions. Just follow them step by step and there are no problems here, captain.

Yes the file is big. Patience is a virtue, good things come to those who wait, etc. etc. ""Why it take so long???"" Because the file is big, genius. Just leave it running in the background and you'll have it soon enough.

Cheers Aeron. =]

,alexDELICIOUS,2008-05-17T20:11Z,"StormGam how about you actually look?

Click the file you unzipped. It is called ""THE SIMS 2 COMPLETE COLLECTION patched and cracked plus BONUS CONTENT!"" (shockingly). Then scroll through the files until you see one that is titled ""installation instructions"". Like magic, it will open in your web browser. ;]

Skateforlife the instructions clearly say not to put the cracked .exe in until you have decided you're finished putting in all the expansions you want.

Uninstall it and try again, only do it in the right order this time (University before Nightlife), and don't replace the .exe files until you're done installing shit."

,Dan-Ihjel,2008-05-23T12:44Z,"Hi and thanks for this great torrent. Before i report this bug i just wanna say that i also have the freetime expansion and kitchen & bath stuff pack.

When i try to enter some of the community lots in the Downtown district (FM, Sugar Cube, etc.) it loads forever so you have to close the game by force. After this happened i tried to search google for the cause of this and i came across something about custom content could cause this.

I deleted everything in my downloads folder ( C:\Documents and Settings\[USERNAME]\My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads) and reinstalled all the pre-order content and all the official content, all this while i was testing to see if my sim could drive to one of the lots. When i came to the unofficial content the game started to freeze again, so through trial and error i found the file causing this; 

Paradise Wallshelf.package (located in EXTRA 4. Unofficial Content\Paradise Sims\Objects)

Anyway i don't know if it have anything to do with the extra expansions but if anyone come across the same problem, they should try deleting that file.

Thanks again for this torrent :)"

You probably got a message saying you can't create a file with a title lager than 260 letters.
Just unzip it somewhere else so that there while be a shorter file name. Than all the files will unzip.

We followed the instructions as provided in the torrent, but after installing the sims 2 and running the patch an error occurs when the patch is at the point of the effects.package. The patch can then only be closed down.. I tried going on installing the Sims 2 Uni after that, but when the program tries to update the sims 2 at the end of the installation, another error occurs (I assume because patching sims 2 did not go well) and it deinstalls the sims 2 uni.
Anyone else had this problem? and does anyone know a solution?"
,Sirreal420,2008-05-26T22:02Z,"Heres some advice, instead of dragging and dropping cracks, copy and paste them (seemed to work for me). also if you get freezeing when trying to start your game, go to my documents-->ea games-->the sims 2 and move that folder to the desktop then start the game again, it will recreate the folder, and you will have to do all your custom content over again.

seriously it says 356 days
is there anyway to make it download faster?"
,alexDELICIOUS,2008-05-31T03:36Z,"Madalina - make sure you mount the iso files with whatever it is you're using (probs Daemon tools amirite?) and make sure all options are checked and if there is a disc 1 and disc 2 they're both mounted. =] It should auto run by itself after that and will give you options for where to install etc. Don't worry, I'm not laughing at you.

Amiera - yes this download works fine with vista. 

Skymech - maybe your computer just doesn't have the RAM to cope with the game, but you could make sure you have the latest updates for your graphics card and try it again. Good luck with that.

Holly - you could get faster internet or move closer to the telephone exchange. :O"

Anyway, my question is, can I use the discs I have with the ISOs or should I just use what you have provided and of course follow the instructions? I did the same thing for TES: Morrowind, I bought the GOTY edition off ebay and one of the discs didn't work so I downloaded it and they worked fine together."

Finally, I hope downloading this encourages people to go out and buy the game to support the people who have been writing code and debugging game play for literally years now on just this one game and to feed them and their families. EA may be a corporate giant but it's still powered by humans.

,Kiragatash,2008-07-18T17:24Z,"tnx Lerk_oner, but I already knew what you told me; just the extracting didn't work, but now it is miraculously finished. So I installed the game with all the expansions but here is a new prob now,

When I run the game everything loads fine until I try to make a family, making a house, or want to play with a family. I don't know if its my pc 'cause its a new one since a month ago. It may be the amount of data he has to load, but I got a XP with 1GB Ram, so I realy don't know."
,EAKendalP,2008-07-19T02:41Z,"OK I have a problem atm witch I think I cud know what it is but I still want a clearens if I can. Now I have downloaded this torrent to 100% and unrared it and everything, mounted and instaling every game that is in an patches in them and everything.

Now the problem is that now that I wana play them everytime a start them or anyone is seas that I need to put in the right CD. Now I have cracked every game (That is the thing and puting my eyes on) After every game that I instaled I cracked it by exploring the Mounted ""CD"" and copied the icon and plased i in the program_Game. Now That is the thing I think is my problem but I still want to know if it is not. 

That is my problem I'd like to know if you anyone cud help me with, and another questing. Do I realy need all those game shourtcuts or can I just go inte the last one ""Bon voyage"" every time I wana play the #games"" or do I need to go into Nightlife wen I wana play it and so on?"

I follow the instructions, I got the original Sims 2 to install and work fine.  Then I install the expansion packs, and after installation, I get a message about how the program is going to check for updates or something, then there's an error, and the installation reverses.  No expansion.

It says its been tested and works properly but I'm guessing it wasn't tested on Vista.  But anyways...all Vista users don't use this one.  Sorry for being so harsh and I do appreciate the upload.

I've got everything working, but once i get into the game i can't use any cheats. pressing shift+ctrl+c does nothing, as well as it keeps freezing when i do certain things (like create a person wearing a certain outfit). anybody have any idea what i can do?"
,gemineye674,2008-12-11T21:57Z,"Now I know what you mean by stupid questions.  But let your mind take a whack at this...how do you know when your asking a stupid question?  Easy...when you find the answer!  They're no stupid questions, only stupid people!  LOL!  I figured it all out...everything works great and thanks for the download!  Awesome!!!"

,Felch_christ,2009-03-12T21:15Z,"Alright, man. I have done everything i could to keep from asking any questions, prideful as i can be.
However.
Though ive been using torrents regularly for quite a while, ive never dled a game of any kind, so this is my first.
I didnt even know i had to have winrar. Now ive got everything ready, dled and functional, and im on Step 4 of your detailed instructions, and im stuck again. Im guessing theres another program i have to have in order to instal the Sims .exe, right? Whatever i need to open the exe, i sondt have. So if ANY of you could kindly fill me in, it would be appreciated."

please help "
,Kyaira,2010-07-25T04:31Z,"Thanks so much for this. I've been looking at a lot of Sims torrents and this is the only decent one I've found. Will be sure to read instructions, of course. :P
Only 12 hrs to download. :)"
,Kyaira,2010-07-26T07:44Z,"The game works fine for the most part, however when I install the expansion packs it tries to update and then terminates the update. What I did was copy and paste the files before clicking ok to terminate so I still had them. Then I went online and found a working crack to start it from.
Previous to installing The Pets expansion, build mode did not work, but now everythings working fine. (Just a bit of a pain to get the expansions installed.)"
