,tarantuladk,2008-01-06T00:29Z,"It works fine.

Just rename alle files to .r01 and so on. Then they will apear as RAR files and just extract the first of them and it will extract all the others. Then you will get an ISO you can burn into a CD or just mount it with Deamon tools."
,paulhzz,2008-03-08T19:45Z,I'm getting a BIN file what do I do with THAT
,Saadi,2008-03-30T09:42Z,does this game works fine or not ???
,L7G,2008-04-17T21:22Z,"This works fine. If you say that this do not works, youre just a noob.
Use izarc to unrar the files, and a program lik Daemon Tools os PowerIso to mount and install the game.  Read the nfo for more info.

Good luck with playing the game"
,9911553402,2008-12-05T07:02Z,"well when i try to install it it says ""Windows cannot Find Medal of Honor Allied Assault Breakthrough_code.exe make sure you typed the name correctly, and try again. To search for a file go to the Start Menu and click the Search button."" then it says ""The registration number was incorrect. Installation cannot continue""....but never got a chance to put in the cd key lol."
,5iF3R,2009-03-10T09:37Z,Try burning the bin file with Fireburner or rename the extension to .iso and burn or mount with alcohol or deamontools.
