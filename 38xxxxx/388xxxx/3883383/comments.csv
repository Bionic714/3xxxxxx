,poxaaa,2008-03-19T15:41Z,The installation notes are really confusing. Sounds like written by non-english speaker. Can anyone write them out to make sense?
,germannessie765,2008-04-16T23:51Z,"hey, torrent works fine and all, but i really can't understand the instructions. i got it installed, but after that i'm lost! someone please email me who's gotten it to work.

thanks"
,illegalfun,2008-05-13T21:50Z,"Instructions are indeed confusing.  I got the apps installed, but upon running them got a ""No Asio Drivers Found"" Error."
,greenclown,2008-06-06T04:08Z,"its in french and the translation in english was done with one of those online web translators.. really bad. its imposible to understand. 

i think i figured it out though, this i did a few minutes ago so im not 100% sure but its working for me.

first install key rig. its going to come up with some errors about files not been found, ignore all.. after the instalation is complete go to the Key Rig crack forder. copy the dll file and paste it on the installed m-audio folder inside your program files replacing the existing one. 

go back to the downloaded folder (M-Audio Drum and Bass and Key Rig) copy the ""Key Rig Data"" folder the paste it on the installed m-audio folder inside your program files replacing the existing one. 

this seemed to work and Key Rig opens without any errors. i have not tryed it on the drum and bass yet, but im guessing the same procedure works."
,dongledik,2008-06-07T02:06Z,"Thanx to greenclown... Here it is again with a few extras

Install using the M-Audio Drum and Bass Rig Setup.exe

Select destination location for the program files [VST folder]
Select destination for Drum and Bass Rig data directory [vst folder]

Select Ignore for all errors

On Completion....

Copy contents of the folder 'Drum and Bass Rig data' [The one you just downloaded] 
into the 'Drum & Bass Rig Data' folder in your VST directory [the one created by the install].... 

Thats what all the errors were about?

Locate the folder 'DrumRig Crack' inside the folder 'Crack'..... 

Double click the file 'DrumRig' to register the application to your registry

You will recieve a 'registration successfull' message 

copy the 'M-Audio Drum and Bass Rig.dll' from the 'DrumRig Crack' folder, use it to overwrite the 'M-Audio Drum and Bass Rig.dll' in the installed M-Audio Folder

Locate the file 'Set Drum and Bass Rig Data Location' [in the M-Audio folder in your vst plugins folder] 
Double click to set location...

Thats it your done........Same instructions apply to the keyrig setup

Note..
Always use copy and paste not drag and drop' so that you keep a copy of the originals in case of failure..

Hope we Got it now dudes............Worked with Ableton & Cubase SX3....Standalone didnt seem to work tho?"
