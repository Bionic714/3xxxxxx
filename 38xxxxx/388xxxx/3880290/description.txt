Using revolutionary cameras, the directors of this French film have made an amazing chronicle of the insect world. There are at least a dozen fascinating, memorable images, and the carnage is held to a minimum. Some favorites include a caterpillar traffic jam, a frog\'s bout with a rain storm, and a bird that turns into Godzilla for a bunch of ants. Then there\'s the snail mating scene that must be seen to be believed.

No need to know French, there is minimal narration.
