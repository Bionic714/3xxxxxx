,DaGoN_16,2007-11-22T08:06Z,"What do you mean ""this is not aXXo!"" ? It is, he just changed his name. I bet if you download all of his current torrents you will find out they are top quality and maybe THEN you will be convinced that this is aXXo. And if this is not axxo like you say, where is the real one then?"
,blackrabbit5,2007-11-22T17:31Z,yer this isnt axxo because he quit pirates bay but this is the guy whos working with pirates bay to upload all his torrents from other sites
