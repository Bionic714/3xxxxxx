If you want a really good Aussie film please download BAD BOY BUBBY the best one i've seen and one of my faves. thanx"
,conjunctionjunction,2008-04-07T06:52Z,Thanks for this!  I loved this movie back when it came out; any chance of dvd quality?  It's impossible to find and was never released in North America...
,NephilimNexus,2009-03-01T20:24Z,"Thanks!  It's very hard to find this classic movie anymore, which is a shame because it's is simple awesome on so many levels.  It's a must see for anyone finding themselves in any kind of music/party scene."
,NephilimNexus,2009-04-17T19:44Z,"So far I've got a 8.0+ upload ratio on this, yet only two other seeders?  People should not be so greedy.  This movie is based on a true story and a true classic that shows the ugly reality behind the ""glamour"" of the party-kid lifestyle.  Despite it's greatness, I'd still only recommend this film for people with an IQ over 100, as the sheer depth of layers and story at work here is lost on the average illiterate plebe."
,Bostero007,2009-09-17T15:44Z,Aye! is it me or is there no sound to this film? Have I done something wrong? I was really looking forward to watching this Cult Classic. Any tips about or help regarding the sound would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. 
,Bostero007,2009-09-19T20:38Z,"Never mind the comment about there being no sound. Everything is in order. Thanks for the film. It was great to watch after all these years! ""You bloody hippies!"" Great quality. "
