Synopsis taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs_in_Space

Dogs in Space is a stylish and chaotic film about a group of alternative music fans sharing a house in the inner Melbourne suburb of Richmond. The film\'s plot traces the day-to-day existence of the chief characters and is virtually an endless sequence of intense party scenes involving heavy substance-abuse.
