Think of the greatest terror imaginable. Is it a monstrous alien? A lethal epidemic? Or, as in this harrowing masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, is it fear of murder by someone who should love and protect you - a member of your own family?

From a script he co-adapted from the Stephen King novel, Kubrick melds vivid performances, menacing settings, dreamlike tracking shots and shock after shock into a milestone of the macabre. In a signature role, Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, who's come to the elegant, isolated Overlook Hotel as a off-season caretaker with his wife and son. Torrance as never been there before - or as he? The answer lies in the ghostly timewarp of madness and murder....

Starring:

Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers.
