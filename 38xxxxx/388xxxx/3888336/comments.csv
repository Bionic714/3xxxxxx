Bye....."
,DjViral,2007-11-23T01:24Z,"i've got the protection error aswell. what to do>?

what setup did u download from their site? all they have to download is the windows version trial."
,blackvelvetus,2007-11-23T09:28Z,i am a pro user and have access to mac versions...so a trial may be limited to pc...i do not understans why there is a protection error...unless you may have put in a bad unlock code...try that code listed..but i would disconnect from the internet first...may be that..causing the error messages...
,knunchucksammy,2007-11-27T09:27Z,"I am having the same problem.  I tried to upgrade from the old version which has been working okay, for quite some time.  I say okay because it has desperately needed an update!  I am really hoping that the new version takes care of some of the glitches that not even the PC version has.

Needless to say I can't get this copy to work. 

I downloaded it, installed it.  It detected my old versions settings and was attempting to import them.  It starts to boot and then throws that error code.

It didn't actually give me the chance to enter a code, it just threw the error.  I thought it might be detecting my old versions code so I deleted everything and reinstalled, and it didn't work.  Help.  I need this to work so I don't have to spend money on it :)

,philippemerc,2007-12-11T08:27Z,"Hi everyone, no problem with this torrent, download it, install it on my mac with leopard, and write in the serial WBBSUCHFUBBLG, good luck."
,gaznev2000,2007-12-18T19:36Z,"Hi Guys, your problem with the ?protection error? when launching is because you had a previous version of VDJ installed you machine still has some hidden VDJ files on it. I had the same error but formatted my HDD and reinstalled the program and it worked fine.

(I?m on a Macbook pro running tiger)

Hope this helps 
P.s. Thanks for the upload blackvelvetus"

please some one upload "
,entrakor,2008-09-08T20:35Z,"For MAC user: no need to format all your computer or delete with appzaper t-your 5 version of virtualDJ.
Just delete the com.atomixproductions.virtualdj.plist file from the /Library/Preferences and then launch again the application. You will then get the registration window, and then enter this key: WBBSUCHFUBBLG. 

Works FINE

enjoy
