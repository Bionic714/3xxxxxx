,sumsums,2008-01-08T01:02Z,"no subtitles exist for this film, at least i havent found any. never got released outside germany or austria, and fan-subtiteling hadnt been invented back then. "
,dogma00,2008-01-09T12:22Z,"Weeeeellll, fan subtitling scene _does_ exist _now_, though.

So, anyone German-speaking out there keen to write English subtitles for this? Even a rough and approximate subtitle track would help..."
