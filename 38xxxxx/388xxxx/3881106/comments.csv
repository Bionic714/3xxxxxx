,airmex,2007-12-12T17:36Z,"Sorry, guys... but I thought, that you'll found. You must unpack crack.exe (winrar sfx) to get this)"
,sajidmd,2007-12-23T04:42Z,"Hi,

License type=seat.
Is this a 14 days license ?

Thanks,"
,airmex,2007-12-24T08:08Z,"seat=14 days. BUT you shoul unpack crack.exe (winrar sfx) and use licence generator to get UNLIMITED licence.

It's completely cracked, just follow the instructions above.

1. Unpack
2. Unpack crack.exe (winrar sfx)
3. run setup
4. Select license type = seat.
5. Type maintenance number 0123-2820602186
6. Copy ""l-mqt82.exe"" to the ""bin"" directory where you have placed QTP9


and don't be afraid of creck.exe :)"
,airmex,2007-12-24T08:09Z,"shit, so many mistakes.... I wouldn't drink too much vodka on Sundays :)))"
,sajidmd,2007-12-25T07:45Z,"Thanks for your quick response...
I have un-packed crack. did the setup. Entered the maintenance number you have given. It didn't ask me for any license type.. So I am hoping I am good to go!!

Thank you !!"
,airmex,2007-12-27T19:39Z,"anyway, if your licence expires, just copy ""l-mqt82.exe"" to the ""bin"" directory where you have placed QTP9 and run - it will fix the problem. cheers."

,full-auto,2008-04-05T22:43Z,"There is no ""crack.exe"" file and no where in the torrent is there a file named ""l-mqt82.exe"".  The Maintenance number is valid, but there doesn't appear to be anything to generate a key and no key is included."
,full-auto,2008-04-05T23:00Z,"Ok, I was stoned (not literally).  I did find the crack.exe file.  The key does appear to work.  Sorry for the inaccurate post above."

,sudhanshurvce,2008-10-25T14:51Z,"Hi melvy83 - here is sol for ur prob = 
On Windows Vista, Quick Test Professional seat licenses may not work correctly if you are not logged on as an administrator. (Note that concurrent licenses work as usual.)
Workaround: On Windows Vista, install Quick Test Professional and any Quick Test add-ins as an administrator. To do this, right-click setup.exe from the root folder of the Quick Test Professional installation CD and choose Run as administrator."
,airmex,2008-12-19T18:52Z,"HEY! we have released 9.5 + .NET plugin. But...The shitty tracker can't get my torrent file (The torrent file seems to be broken.
