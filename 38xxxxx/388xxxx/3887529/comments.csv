,alau07,2012-03-15T14:57Z,"Thanks for the download man! :D no problems at all. But, im just wondering, how do I change this to Windowed mode?
I tried going to:
Contents -> c_drive -> Program Files -> Hitman Contracts -> Hitman Contracts.ini

I opened the file with TEXTEDIT and wrote a new phrase on the last line:
""Window 1""
Obviously, without the quotes. But when I enter ingame once again, the game goes of jiggly fizzy and the graphics turn puzzled and bad and it doesn't go to windowed mode, stays in full screen. If you can help on that, I would very much appreciate your assistance.

- Thank you for the seed btw, you're a real man. This is one of the most working and fastest download I ever had in the past year lol, even though some other games were less than 800MB, I think this download was quite fast.

Used client: Transmission

- Cheers
