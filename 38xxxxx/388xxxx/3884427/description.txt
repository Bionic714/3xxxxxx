This is a 2 CD set for repair and diag of 123 chassis Mercedes Benz.
The version of adobe that these cd use is old so you have to do the following:
1) Insert the CD into your CD Drive.
Note: If a page shows up stating that you need Acrobat 4.0 or better, and you have it already installed, then ignore the message and close that window.

2) Double-click on the "My Computer" icon.

3) Right-click on the CD Drive Icon that is running the STAR Class CD and select the "Open" option.

4) Double-click on the "Program" folder.

5) Double-click on "welcome.htm" or "opening.htm" and the STAR Classic program will run shortly

Enjoy
