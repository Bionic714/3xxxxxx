,kiddanplay,2007-11-12T21:58Z,these files come in 16 diffrent files how or what program do i need to compress them so that they play ive been shying away from these kinda files because once i download them i dont know how to get them to all play ....can someone explain please so i dont pass up on good downloads from loader and all these others?
,Necro-File,2007-11-12T23:51Z,"WinRAR. The real files are just compressed and split into smaller pieces. They were like that for usenet distrobution where the maximum filesize you can upload is much smaller, however it actually SLOWS torrenting, as opposed to zipping up multiple files into a single file."
,alienoverlord,2007-11-13T02:18Z,get winrar begin to exteact file 00 and the program will continue automatically to extract all the files in order and put them into a single playable file
