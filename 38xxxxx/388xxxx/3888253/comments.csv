,enkiridu,2007-12-13T03:30Z,"correction steelynx. taking a 350MB avi file and breaking it up into 25x15MB files is pointless and worthless to do. I don't want to have twice as much data sitting on my harddrives. Bittorrent takes care of breaking up my files and allowing me to suspend and resume. As for reinventing the wheel, the age of dialup is over. Let's move on."
