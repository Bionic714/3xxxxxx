Some years after World War II, Lise Cohen (Daniela Poggi using the pseudonym ?Daniela Levy?) visits the ruins of the Nazi camp where she was once held prisoner. Encountering an older man who seems to be her lover, we learn that he is actually Commandant Conrad von Starker (Adriano Micantoni under the ridiculous moniker ?Marc Loud?), a sadistic ex Nazi who is free after being convicted of war crimes. In flashback we learn that Starker ran the camp more like a brothel, where defenseless Jewish women were brought in to satisfy the lust of German soldiers, and the ladies were also tortured, raped and humiliated in the worst ways possible. The beautiful blonde Lise in particular becomes Starker?s object of obsession: she is apparently not afraid to die and makes herself immune to all the pain and suffering put upon her, making Starker all the more infatuated to the point where they form an unlikely kinky sexual relationship.
