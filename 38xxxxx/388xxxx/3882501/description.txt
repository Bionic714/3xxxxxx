
Damage Case - The Anthology is a unique career overview from the one of the legends of rock - Grammy Award winner, one time Hendrix roadie, gravity defying rock icon and of course MotÃ¶rhead frontman, Ian Fraser Kilminster, or the mighty LEMMY to his legions of fans. Kicking off in the 60s with The Rockin' Vickers and Sam Gopal and culminating in his collaboration with Dave Grohl on the Probot project in 2004, this 2CD anthology of course includes the inevitable "Silver Machine" marking Lemmy's time with Hawkwind and a pick of MotÃ¶rhead tracks - "Damage Case", "Iron Horse", and more. Also included are Lemmy's less well known collaborations with other artists including The Ramones ("R.A.M.O.N.E.S"), The Damned ("Ballroom Blitz"), Wendy O'Williams of the Plasmatics ("Stand By Your Man") and of course Girlschool and the UK top 5 hit ("Please Don't Touch").

Although he'll forever be the "face" of one of metal's all-time great bands, MotÃ¶rhead, Lemmy Kilmister also managed to lay down an assortment of non-MotÃ¶rhead tracks over the years -- as evidenced by 2006's Damage Case: Lemmy Anthology. A handful of MotÃ¶rhead tracks are indeed included, but Damage Case is not your typical zillionth MotÃ¶rhead/Lemmy collection, as it traces all of the singer/bassist's standout tracks from his very first band, the Rockin' Vickers (a.k.a. "The Rockin' Vicars" or "The Wild Ones"), all the way to his participation in Dave Grohl's much publicized Probot project. As proven throughout the 31-track collection, Lemmy has always kept things rough and gritty -- and should be commended (especially when seemingly all the veteran rock acts were softening up their sound and reaching for the hair spray come the mid- to late '80s). Included is the Lemmy-sung (but not written) Hawkwind classic "Silver Machine", as well as raucous duets with both Girlschool ("Please Don't Touch") and the late/great Wendy O. Williams ("Stand by Your Man"). Wrapping up the album is a barrage of covers that have been rescued from "tribute album hell", including a pair of Metallica tunes ("Enter Sandman" and "Whiplash"), Queen ("Tie Your Mother Down"), Johnny Cash ("Big River"), and Iron Maiden ("The Trooper"), among others. Also included are Lemmy's aforementioned Probot track ("Shake Your Blood") and MotÃ¶rhead's tribute to the Ramones, "R.A.M.O.N.E.S.", the latter track being one that Lemmy should be given credit for penning -- he was one of the few rockers to voice his admiration of the N.Y.C. band while it was still a functioning unit. If you're looking to dig deeper than the average MotÃ¶rhead compilation, Damage Case: Lemmy Anthology is certain to get your head a-banging. (~ Greg Prato, AMG)
