SPL - Sha Po Lang (2005) - Rmvb

HKFlix Says:  4.5 stars

It's wonderful to see quality returning to Hong Kong films. SPL offers a clear example of genuine effort and talent in the writing, acting, and action. It's definitely a crime-drama first, and a martial arts film last, but the quality is undeniable. 

Avg. Rating:  4.5 / 5 (based on 31 ratings). What did you think of it?  

Plot: Officer Ma (Donnie Yen) is a principled cop whose martial arts skills and reputation for violence introduce tension to his precinct. But the death of a cop who was planted undercover in crime boss Po's (Sammo Hung) gang only further disrupts the balance. 
 
Overview: In this good-cop-versus-bad-gangster action thriller, Detective Chan (Simon Yam) relentlessly pursues crime boss Po (Sammo Hung), but eventually gives up in frustration and looks toward retirement. His replacement, Ma (Donnie Yen, "Iron Monkey", "Blade II" and "Hero"), is a principled, committed cop who is skilled in martial arts and has a reputation for violence. The newcomer introduces tension into the established ranks of the battle-scarred precinct. The death of a cop who was planted undercover in Po's gang further disrupts the balance of truth and justice.
