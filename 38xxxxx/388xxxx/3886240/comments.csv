,prankstare,2009-08-29T20:59Z,Hey somebody has subtitles for it?
,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:10Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
,GODdoesntEXIST,2010-09-04T20:37Z,"I have VERY fast upload - over 5 MBYTES (not bits) per second.

If I see that I am being properly seeded so I can DL this fast, then I will seed with my super fast connection for days and days - and all of you will get to have this file in a few hours as opposed to days or weeks.

But if I see people dropping off or limiting their upload - then as soon as I am done, I will end the torrent - and during my DL I will limit my upload to only 1 KB/s which is nothing.

so its your choice."
