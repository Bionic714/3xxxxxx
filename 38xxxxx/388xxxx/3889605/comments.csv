,listigt,2007-11-22T20:30Z,"This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.  Worth watching as a ""how to not make a movie""-thingy. It's a comic I get it, it's most likely to be a very ridicoulus movie. But this is like watching a train wreck, who ever wrote the script should go kill him/her self."

,chunkyblamm,2008-02-15T22:34Z,"I couldn't get the audio to work even after downloading multiple codecs for quicktime, however, I downloaded VLC like someone suggested and it works.  Thanks Man."
,sjwilliams,2008-05-28T12:50Z,"I had the same result as chunkyblamm. No audio in Quicktime; no codecs have any effect; but it works fine in VLC.  Now -- is there any way to make the .avi work in iTunes on Mac, or to export it so audio works in iTunes on Mac (i.e., Quicktime)?  If anyone has a solution, it would be appreciated. "
,sjwilliams,2008-05-28T12:51Z,"... and thanks for the great downloads, axxo."
,keramida,2008-06-18T01:36Z,"Not really much of a plot, but a good movie :)

Thanks!"
,Natedawg420,2008-07-24T09:10Z,"Great, great movie! Its everything that expected from a comic book movie. It plays perfectly with the MPCStar player. Good video quality, crystal clear sound, and the dwnld took no time. But Im having trouble burning it to dvd. I used to be able to do it with the WINDOWS DVD BURNER no sweat. But now, whenever I try to burn ANY movie a message pops up saying the file is INVALID -or- CORRUPTED. Whats the deal? Is this the same for everyone? Do I have to change the settings on my computer? Or are the files literrally invalid or corrupted? Any answers and or solutions would be greatly appreciated. Oh yeah, PIRATE BAY RULES WOOOOO!!!!! "
,bittorrentor,2008-07-26T14:31Z,I've found that Win AVI converter works great for quick time conversions... and of course... VLC rocks!
,Maxy_Dawg,2008-08-02T21:13Z,This torrent's trackers are having problems getting connections through active refusal by the target machine. Can any people who already downloaded help me out?
