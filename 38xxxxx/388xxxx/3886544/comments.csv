,tieranosaur,2009-08-01T18:03Z,"Movie is great itself, and this upload is almost perfect.

There's part of a scene at 53:58 where the dinosaur is talking, and in the movie his words are subtitled because he doesn't speak clearly, on purpose... in this upload, there are no subtitles.  Can they be added?"

,loruiecross,2010-03-24T08:47Z,hi. guys. is this movie working? sound? quality?. pls guys help. i want 2 watch this movie!!
,GenEmperor,2010-04-23T10:06Z,I haven't finished downloading this but I see some people have audio/video issues. My suggestion would be to download and install GOM player. Make sure you install it with all the possible audio and video formats for it to be able to play them. It is free just search GOM player with Google or any internet search engine.
,harvengure,2010-06-21T03:42Z,"Having watched this download all the way through I can confirm that it is legitimate,  though the visual quality is a bit off...like that of a DVD from a much earlier time.  Still easily watchable however.

Sound is good. +1"
