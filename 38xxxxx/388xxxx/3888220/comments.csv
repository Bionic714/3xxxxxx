,Tripleteck,2007-11-13T16:57Z,"Hi, i got a little problem.... since a couple of week i got problem to burn my stealth games. I got dirty disc error on all my burned dl... can somebody help me ? Someone told me that it was because my layer break is not set to the right offset but i manage to adjust it to 1913760 on imgburn. I also check my games in xbox backup creator to see if all the ss dmi and pfi are stealth packed with those games.. they all passed the stealth check but still they dont work. For this game xdvdmulleter said that it's not pad so it will never boot ... please help me before i go out of Verbatim dl's lol If somebody can help me add me to your msn ... tripleteck_26 in hotmail ... thx fellow modders !
