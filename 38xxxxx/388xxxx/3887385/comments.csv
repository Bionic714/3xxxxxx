ThePirateBay should have Loose Change Final Cut as a theme for the site.

Like they do with some movies... maybe change the TPB logo to something LCFC related...!

Loose Change could be the sites theme for the rest of the year...

That would be so cool !!"

,janesmack,2007-12-04T17:34Z,"Listen, it's been confirmed already that Bin-Laden was trained by the US Govt. He has conveniently been there any time the US needs a crisis situation to scare thier people into running to them for security. Throughout history it has been proven, that those who give up thier liberty for security, only recieve tyranny. Remember that the US govt. trained and funded Al-Qaida. People, just look at the evidence and RESEARCH it for yourselves. You also might want to look at The Bilderberg Group...They are the ones who decide world affairs, not the Govts. Hitler did the same type of thing when he took power. 1st thing he did was burn his own Reichstag to the ground and blame it on terrorism to get his people to do the same thing that the sheep in america are all now doing. Jesus Christ! I can't believe that ANYONE would actually think that a One-World Govt. is a good thing. Think a little about what you're saying, Then ask a Canadian or Mexican what they think about losing thier Sovreignty. If we accept a one world govt, we might as well all torch the Constitution. Lastly, Google ""NAFTA Super Highway"" and read a bit. it's all tied in together.
911 WAS AN INSIDE JOB"

,mazzer123,2008-01-26T09:02Z,"see also 911 revisited (911_revisited_v2.avi). also, loose change 2nd edition is a quite different from final cut so worth watching even if you seen final cut. "
,xvegetarianx,2008-10-14T13:40Z,"This Is NOT Hight Quality!!!

This video is extremely poor quality!

The beginning credits were cut off the film, so this might have corrupted the video quality! Every time a person talks on this film, their face goes out and you can tell this is not good quality!

There is a better quality version of this on thepiratebay, keep looking :)"
