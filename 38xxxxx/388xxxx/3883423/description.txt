vBulletin 3.6.8 Patch Level 1

This release is a patch to the 3.6.8 to fix a security issue reported to us this morning. Only 3.6.8 is affected by this issue. The only changes in this release are for this security issue.

The changed files are:

    * includes/class_bbcode.php
    * includes/version_vbulletin.php


There are no template changes.

What is a Patch Level? How does it differ from a full release?

A patch level release contains fixes for only the most critical issues in the previous release. In this case, this means the only changes are to address a security issue.

It is designed to be installed directly over top of your 3.6.8 installation, with no other action. You do not need to run any upgrade scripts.
