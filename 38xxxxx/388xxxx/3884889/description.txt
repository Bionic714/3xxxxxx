This is a board feed, but everything [everything being two mics; one for vocals, one for guitar] was miced, so it sounds like a good mic recording.
The mics and other equipment used is unknown to me. Pattern Is Movement opened (not included in this set).
The sound was adjusted during the first song a bit.
Somebody bumped into a mic stand at the start of track 16... so that's what the distortion is.
