Jimmy Page, Death Wish II- Original Soundtrack vinyl transfer, 16-bit flac
Swan Song 8511

Quite some time ago, a good friend sent me his Death Wish II LP and asked 
if I would copy it to CD-R for him. He's a huge Page fan and explained that this 
LP had never been officially released on CD. His LP was in very nice condition so 
I agreed to help him out.

After completing the transfer and returning my friend's LP I pretty much just forgot
about it, leaving the audio and artwork sitting in the far corner of my hard drive.


While this LP is not something I would typically have in rotation on my playlist, 
I'm thinking that there may be some other Led Zeppelin-Jimmy Page fans who might 
enjoy having access to it.

This LP was transferred, using my usual mid-fi setup at 44.1kHz/16-bit 
(so there will not be a 24-bit version available).The vinyl pops and clicks have 
been removed manually using Adobe Audition.

I have taken the finished wav files and converted them to flac for this torrent.
The artwork from the LP is also included.

The track listing is as follows:

Track 1: Who's To Blame
Track 2: The Chase
Track 3: City Sirens
Track 4: Jam Sandwich
Track 5: Carole's Theme
Track 6: The Release
Track 7: Hotel Rats And Photostats
Track 8: Shadow In The City
Track 9: Jill's Theme
Track 10: Prelude
Track 11: Big Band, Sax, And Violence
Track 12: Hypnotizing Ways (Oh Mamma)

So to those Led Zep-Jimmy Page fans who gotta have it all- this one's for you.

Enjoy.
