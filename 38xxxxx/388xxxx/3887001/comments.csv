,NezzoX,2007-11-17T18:21Z,This is not a axxo release.. his name is just axxo. Not axxo-torrents
,NezzoX,2007-11-17T18:23Z,"But hey, I can be wrong about this. Sorry for the comment in that case."
,scooterboobie,2007-11-21T21:34Z,"Hi guys.

Is this the second part of the movie? I downloaded the axxo death proof file, but it turned out to be the first movie planet terror - which in my mind wasnt that good. IÂ´m hoping that this it the terantino one!! - anyone?"
,ssm04ca,2007-12-27T16:16Z,"Movie is not Axxo... maybe 6/10 quality, plot sucks, ending sucks, and qaulity sucks... I have know idea how this movie has this many seeds. It looks like somthing made in the 70's..."
,DogNo7,2007-12-30T03:26Z,"ssm04ca, you are a complete and total wanker.

Of course it looks like something made in the 70's.  Many horror films were made in the 70's, and this film is intentionally tapping into that type of ""feel"".

If you can't see the humour and appreciate an excellent film, go back to watching Spongebob Squarepants or the Brady Bunch, you stupid git!

What a wanker.

-DogNo7"
,SwuQ2G2i8,2008-01-04T19:32Z,"Verified
I think I like the 'grindhouse' genre"
,ssm04ca,2008-01-04T23:53Z,"Forgive me dogno7 im not up to date with the computer lingo... wtf is a ""wanker""? I understand that it is a horror film and it happoned in the 70's, But shit this movie sucked...  Halloween was first made in 1978, and remade in 07 and was actually pretty good...  So between everyone else's comments, and this movie falling to the bottom of the top 100, I think we all agree if Sucks."
,Art_Vendelay,2008-01-06T00:38Z,"this movie fucking sucks, its a waste of time to watch.  if u havnt seen planet terror yet i suggest waching that instead, its much better.  this movie is very boring & also lame"
,b0a,2008-01-13T15:18Z,hahah wanker means masturbatory or whatever its called:p
,Karnak,2008-01-17T15:35Z,"If it's aXXo is here:
http://axxo-release.blogspot.com/

By the way this is not axxo user, but axxo film. aXXo isn't back yet"
,adamkinniburgh,2008-01-19T03:16Z,"I'm sadenned by the fucking stupidity of some of the comments made against this torrent. For a start, the movie was shot to look like a 70's B-movie. It's quality doesnt suck, its supposed to look like its playing from a reel. Its a very well made homage to classic underground horror. And who the fuck mentions Halloween when talking about decent horror movies. What a bunch of dickheads.

Since when did trackers become an outlet for over opinionated, under educated morons. FUCK OFF BACK TO MYSPACE."
,stuart0305,2008-01-30T00:25Z,adamkinniburgh hits the nail on its head!!
,RainbowDissent,2008-02-05T15:05Z,This is an aXXo release. He cleared all his torrents from the site when he left; aXXo-torrents is doing a superb job re-upping many of them. 
,yrah,2008-03-24T20:55Z,"F-me, what a movie! My fave genre. 
Only disappointed that Fergie didn't have a longer death scene."
,iain88,2008-04-11T03:08Z,"DogNo7 and Adamkinsburgh have pretty much said the same as I would have. Don't listen to the above  negative comments. Ones not seen the whole thing and the other guy is a completely hopeless moron who should never be listened to, ever. This is a good film. And planet Terror is superb. A gogo dancing Rose McGowan with a machine gun for a leg.............Superb!!!!"
,Sotha_syl,2008-04-30T01:07Z,"The quality is not low - This is intentionally edited to look as thought it was made decades ago, playing off of a damaged reel.

I HIGHLY reccomend downloading the Planet Terror release by aXXo and the fake trailers that go along with the Grindhouse release, and watch them all in order. First watch planet terror, then the fake previews, then this. It's truly an experience that is difficult to duplicate, and that's how it was in theatres. And it was fuckin great.
If you don't understand the plot, I feel sorry for you. To truly appreciate the dialogue in this film you kind of have to be big on Tarantino films and catch all the references and jokes he makes. 

SPOILER --

What I loved about the plot as a whole is that they introduce a set of several girls in the beginning, take about a half hour to develop all of them as standalone characters with their own personalities, and make you believe they are the main characters, and then kill all of them off in about 2 minutes.

Then they introduce another set of girls and foreshadow that similar events will occur, a multiple murder using a vehicle to kill women in a manner that is sexually appealing to him, and instead they fight back and (I think) kill him in the end.

best film ever made.

ssm04ca you're a wanker. 

Don't you love looking at all the bastards making idiotic comments about an awesome upload, and checking to see that they have not uploaded a thing, and if they have it isn't worth a damn or it's a dead torrent.

I can only imagine the terribly numbers on their share ratio..."
,latin110,2008-05-08T19:19Z,"thanks to the seeders and aXXo- getting good speeds
nice to be get what i give for a change"
,NickPapa,2008-05-15T16:45Z,"Awesome movie.  Tarentino is the complete artist.  If you're looking for a ""Chuck and Larry"" or a ""28 weeks later"" type movie, then perhaps Tarentino isn't for you.  As one guy already said, this movie (as well as the other half of Grindhouse) was made to mimic the 70's B movie look and feel where double horror features were full of hot chicks, big tits, fast cars, drugs, bad dialogue, tons of cliches and plot lines that ended in mid-air.  Watch it for what it is or go download The Simpsons movie.  It's probably more on your level anyway.  ;)  Great upload and great D/L speed.  Thanks."
,jonny-boy-123,2008-05-23T11:48Z,"downloaded this ages ago and never saw it so i thought ill download it again! and its the biggest peice of crap ever ! tarantino is a master i love all his films pulp ficition , jacki brown, kill bill ect ect but this hass gotta be  one of the  worst films i have ever saw!! the plot is retarded! kirk russel is a stuntman chases some stupid chicks and then gets battered at the end!!! i expected way better for a taratino flick!! i suggest u watch PLANET TERROR cus its 50 times more entertaining than this!! anybody who says this is up to tarantino standars wants there head sorting!!"
,jonny-boy-123,2008-05-23T11:51Z,nickpapa! i fully understand how this has been made and am a massive fan of tarantino! but this is shocking in my eyes! how can people compare this to other tarantino classics?? i would seriously give this 1/10 ! and thats from a big tarantino fan who loves his style of film making!!
,iamchuging,2008-06-22T05:32Z,"hi im new at this i downloadded i wanted to preview it and when i did it didnt work all that happend was the screen was black and you can here the voices from the movie

,weevils,2008-09-30T07:36Z,johnny boy think before you post and try not to be a fuckin idiot and give away parts of the movie for those who haven't seen it. 
,harigata,2008-11-14T11:15Z,"Hehe, guys, why don't you go to the forums and open a thread about aXXo - who, why, what, when, and what the fuck.... I mean, every fucking torrent a fucking kindergarten debate group sprouts with all those moronic speculations flying about.

And BTW - a wanker is one who wanks (English, plain old English slang)."
,csteel,2008-11-27T20:42Z,Thanx for the download but whats up with the sound. I get video but no sound. Does anyone know something that i don't. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
,manzilla88,2009-01-14T19:06Z,Great quality as always! Thanx for the upload. I'll continue to seed with my little 50kb a sec. Atleast my net is for free. :-)

,brandsy,2010-02-02T15:10Z,"What is everyone on here thinking this is good movie, its the biggest pile of pish ive ever seen. Should have known though Tarantino got lucky with two films and the rest hes done is shit. People please do not waste your time on this torrent, as for the quality very good as always from axxo"
,tigerace123,2010-04-24T07:31Z,"@ brandsy

This is a grindhouse movie, you have no idea what that is do you?

This movie kicks ass, Kurt Russell is as usual fucking awesome in his role."
