,solarisman,2007-12-04T09:51Z,Michael and ConAir ae both available on mininova.com  Can't find the others.
,Mezmerizer,2007-12-04T22:52Z,This upload isn't too good. The quality is rather poor for a 1 gig file. The crop of the film is also wrong (the tops of heads disappear). I advice you to find an other copy
