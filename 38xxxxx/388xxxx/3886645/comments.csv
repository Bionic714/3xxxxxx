,manni2,2010-12-30T01:22Z,"Excellent job on whoever created the torrent. However, I'm forced to criticized the contents itself. I'm through the 1st video and it is out dated, and you get the errie sense that they are really promoting wininternals (as if your paying more for a NLP advertisement rather than an instructive vid).

I have to give credit that it is informative, but I'm sickened at what david solomon is trying to get for this video these days. $400! If I had paid for this, I would of asked for my money back.

Got 5 other videos to check out. Hope they pan to be more impressive."
,manni2,2011-01-01T23:43Z,"Definitely premature in my comments. Part of my initial disappointment was the first video was only 45 minutes long, and it went at a slow pace. The other videos almost reached 2 hours sometimes and were filled with tech goodies. In the end, worth it."
,nark0z,2011-06-05T09:37Z,Needs more seeding...
,mud5150,2012-06-09T02:08Z,It took a day or so to pull this down so I will seed indefinitely. I have a 100mb connection. Enjoy
