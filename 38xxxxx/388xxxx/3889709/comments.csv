,WarpWar,2008-02-17T22:04Z,"for some reason ""the first dogfighters"" is corrupted, thats the one I wanted"
,redhammer,2008-08-11T03:00Z,"If you happen to encounter a corrupt file, just watch it with newest VLC Media Player (Google it.) 
Works fine here."
,Sempernewbus,2009-03-28T16:15Z,"First, I'm not 100% sure, because I didn't save the original torrent. But when I unpacked the .rar file it was season 1, not 2. And I am sure I never had a torrent labeled season 1."
,rostau,2010-04-18T19:34Z,"Season 2 files are in here not Season 1.  ""The First Dogfighters"" may be corrupt, but it plays back without problem using the free KM player which will play almost any file. Audio sync is off on some of these eps, but KMplayer has resync controls."
