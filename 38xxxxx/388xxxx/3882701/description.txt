Opeth are a heavy metal band from Sweden formed in 1990 that is fronted by songwriter Mikael Ã…kerfeldt.

Rooted in Scandinavian death metal, Opeth later delved deep into experimentation, having since incorporated influences from jazz, progressive rock, blues, and folk, crossing genre borders to create a unique blend of musical styles ? most successfully with their ground-breaking Blackwater Park (2001), and their latest release Ghost Reveries (2005).

Since signing their first record-deal in 1994, the band has released eight albums, a DVD, and a box-set, but merely three singles. A notable exception in their catalog is Damnation (2003), a pure progressive rock record.
