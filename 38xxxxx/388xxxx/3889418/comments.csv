,jalopiimae,2007-11-13T20:41Z,I forgot to say thanxs! For some reason my normal search in PBT did not work and I missed second day therefore I thought that only short version is available. I go for full versions but you do good job for those who prefer only summary :)
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2007-11-13T21:42Z,No problem. I love SUMO just don't have much time  to keep up. I hope others like this digest version as well.
,zlo666,2007-11-13T21:54Z,Much obliged
