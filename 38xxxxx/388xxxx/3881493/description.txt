My Team is proudly to announce that Fifa08 PC-DVD is ready to download.

PS! Many thanks to fairlight who really created the first torrent! 


What\\\'s new in this torrent?

I was able to fix some of the critical bugs:

1) Fixed .exe client which wanted DVD in your rom. (No-dvd crack)
2) Fixed crashes in client

==========================================

INFO:

1) Download the files and mount image with PowerISO or Daemon Tools
2) Install the game with the serial: X8MM-RWM9-FIFA-KFLT-FIFA
3) extract files from the .rar file and play the game!
