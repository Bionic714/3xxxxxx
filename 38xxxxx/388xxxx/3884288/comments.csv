how do these guys think up this surreal crazy stuff !!??"
,devolve,2007-11-11T22:39Z,"Oh please. Can I ask just one question, why is religion so stupid? Even I was raised a catholic, but have this funny little thing called skepticism. It's very unrealistic to think that the earth is only 6000 years old in a 13 billion year old universe. Go ahead, refute the laws of physics and tell me light travels faster that it does, or that the stars have just been painted on the sky.

The only way i'd believe this tripe is if it was the Flying Spagetti Monster.....He's got the balls to pull something like this off."

If you paid attention there is some interesting science here.  Don't let your religious Bias' make you stupid ""Devolve"".  

The point is that there is science that supports other views than what is the accepted.   Open your mind, ask questions.  Don't shut down just because someone has a different opinion!
