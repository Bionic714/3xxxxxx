,digdug,2007-11-18T01:27Z,You actually don't need to be uploading the entire DVD's contents... there is a 1.2 GB installer file on the DVD that has everything that we need.
,digdug,2007-11-18T01:48Z,"Umm... Though it says there is 1, there actually is no seeder. Everyone is stuck at 2.1%"
,cabesota,2007-11-18T10:14Z,"Yeah...can we have some seeders on this one please? Or can the original uploader seed until 100% so we can continue?

Thanks if you can help"
,cabesota,2007-11-20T20:08Z,"This is crap. There are NO seeders on this one.

Delete!"
,mxlx3,2007-11-24T06:54Z,I am seeding every evening. Be patient!
,cabesota,2007-12-07T07:55Z,"Please come back and seed....or at least just say ""I am not seeding this one anymore"" and we can get it nuked."
,typeseven,2007-12-30T19:34Z,why are there no seeds for this game? come on people...
,Andre_D,2008-02-01T14:15Z,dig dug ur wrong. on demonoid someone did the same thing that u said. u could start the game but it wouldnt load. so dont come in here and think u know everything. u dont know a shit.
,typeseven,2008-02-03T21:54Z,why does it let me leech up 2.1% / 94mbs and then tell me there's nothing more? has it actually been seeded by mxlx3 at all?
,grematrcriplr,2008-02-23T19:57Z,SOMEBODY PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,prassun.saha,2008-03-02T07:00Z,"Hey, I've been trying to download this for quite some time now, and every time it stops after 2.1%(94 MB). Could we not have some more seeders? or maybe a smaller file to download? mxlx3!!!! DO something!!!"
,Andre_D,2008-03-02T11:26Z,OMG DONT UPLOAD TORRENTS IF U CANT FUCKING SEED

,-MaN-,2008-06-19T16:37Z,"Hey mxlx3,
I don´t know where you live, so i can´t know when
it´s evening in your country.
Can you tell me your country and when you go to seed at evening?"
,VileCore,2008-06-20T08:16Z,"Damnola. I've been looking for this game for MONTHS.
I finally find a copy and no-one is seeding. 
WHAT is the fucking POINT?"
