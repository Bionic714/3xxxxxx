,jorjecon,2008-01-29T20:58Z,"To fool the update version, and to prevent a message saying something about ""no previous version instaled""   
Add a registry key as follows:   
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Garmin\MapSource\Families\BlueChart Pacific v7]  

After install, do not run mapsource, delete above key, and run mapsource   
Or:  

A second option is to abort the installation and open the language appropriate msi-file

I never try this-be careful in the registry editor."
,jorjecon,2008-01-29T21:12Z,"For download from a torrent site you have to have a special software as Bitcomet the last version is 0.98
http://www.bitcomet.com/
After installed you punch the ''download this torrent' and ask for save to the disk-put it to the desktop it is only a small file.Double click on it it will open the Bitcomet dowload Manager and save the downloaded file to c:\Downloads"

,Thalinor,2010-05-01T18:09Z,"@tallviking 

He is from south africa what do you expect?  THEY are all like that... ya you know what I am talking about marktman1.  Just look in a mirror.  Trying to make money off people for stolen software is WORSE then the jerks who are asking too much for it in the first place.  Its too bad AIDS didn't finish off you people.

If you plan on paying for unlock codes buy them from garmin, if not there are plenty of free keygens out there, use one of those.  Don't pay this pile of shit a dime."
