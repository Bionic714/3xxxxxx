This one fourth delivery has the last dvd of this one the second television series of the Fraggle rocks. It is a question 5.1 as a DVD9 with audio dolby in English and in Spanish, with subtitle in Spanish. I have used the anydvd to extract the content. I include the cover of the dvd. And it will be a miracle if the torrent rises to 45kb/s. This one DVD9 contains the last six chapters (from 19 to 24), whose titles(degrees) are:
- The explosive soup - Each one in his(her,your) cave - I Doubt and the great career(race) - A Curri is a Curri - The calm day of Bass-drum - The invasion of the cosquilleros
