This is a complete version of Temple of Elemental Evil packaged into a .zip. The zip file contains the image files for the Install Disc and Play Disc as well as ToEE_any_Patch2 and ToEE_any_patch3. 

I also bundled a version of daemon tools with it  which is necessary for mounting the image files for play from your hard drive. I play this game only from my hard drive I do not know if these images can be burned to disc successfully because I have never tried to do so.

You will also find a .txt file which gives the best detailed directions for installing and using the game that I could write on short notice. 

I mainly seed my torrents during the night (US Time).
