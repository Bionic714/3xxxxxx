,sporg,2007-11-27T22:48Z,Any downloaders have comments? I need feedback on possible improvements.
,sporg,2007-12-01T05:15Z,Since I have uploaded 8 gigs worth of this game and havent had any complaints Im going to assume  its working for most people.
,sporg,2007-12-18T14:53Z,I am no longer seeding this as of 12/18 due to bandwidth issues with my isp. It will be up to other pirates to maintain it after this point.
,White_King,2008-09-24T00:26Z,Which image types are used?  ISO or one of many other annoying types that I can't be bothered installing yet more software in order to use?
