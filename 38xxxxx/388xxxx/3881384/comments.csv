,aimal,2008-03-08T21:42Z,"why is their no commentry, ?
monty only says the team  name and the players name . 
any idea why this is?"
,Styloco,2008-05-14T22:12Z,"Allright u guys, this is what i've been waiting for, for several years... and now it's finally there thanks to Florentin91.

To show my hapiness, i'm gonna support all you guys (and girls ofc.) who has got problems with this beautifull game.

For urgent problems you can always email me @ styloco@gmail.com (you can also add me on msn).

Now the most common problems:
Windows xp: compatibility error,
solutions:
- run via dos
- run via compatibility method (right click file, properties, compatibility tab and run in other windows mode, you should try all + the check boxes like vga 256 and disable textures, try them too)
- install dosbox, but that's a bit difficult

other problems:
compatibility or interference from other software like antivirus...
solution: if you have compatibility issues with antiviruses, let the antivirus know that the game is no virus (options mostly)

or if you really have some antivirus problems then you should take avast home (free: www.avast.com). i've tested many antiviruses and avast is one of the greatest and fastest.

other great viruses:
nod32 but it's with payment and crack does NOT work most of the times i've tested

kaspersky, also fine but COULD SLOW down your pc VERY MUCH!!, again it's with payment and it's kinda difficult to crack.

avg free (7.5 and 8), if you have a 1.5 ghz or lower cpu you should take 7.5, else 8 is ok. but keep in mind that this is not the best option compared to avg...

you can also try the avg pro edition (trial, but you can get a new trial period afterwards with several programs... one of them is hide ip platinum)

ok enough with the antivirus shit.

if you com is to slow and ur running windows vista, then downgrade to xp..
then in xp you can tweak also to make it even faster..

2 most important save options:
1) start, run, msconfig, tabblad start up and disable most of the things, most of the things are not that important when it comes down to speed
2) start, run, services.msc, try the advanced mode where you can see what services do.. try to disable as much as you can but do it save.. check the dependencies and if you are not sure put the service to manual (rightclick, properties)

other (dangerous) tweaks are registery tweaks.
i won't tell them cause you might screw up, however you can always google for tweaks (our site: www.tweakwindows.nl for the dutch under us)  

start, run, regedit

microsoft bootvis does work but isn't that helpfull i've found out after testin several times.

well that's about it, any questions email me and have fun playing this wonderfull game!

,Florentin91,2008-05-21T19:18Z,and 45 euro's ? wtf dude with 45 euro's i can get about 3-4 great games from 2005-2006...
,Simone-de-Beauvoir,2008-06-20T17:09Z,"I get a error when i open the game. It says: SHOWDCT: No DCT chunks found! FILE win\file.c LINE 223 

And the it quit the game :/ Any1 know how to solve this?"
,Florentin91,2008-06-26T14:41Z,"seems to be a problem with the .exe , some loss data or something :("
,sileX84,2008-06-29T11:35Z,"Florentin are u romanian? Ok if u are good for u. But i downloaded this game and i get a message that i don't have sufficient memory. But sometimes i manage to enter the game, but sometimes i don't. Maybe i need the crack. Do you have it?"
,Florentin91,2008-06-29T20:18Z,"well in 1998 the games had not protection like securom or something else so at that time only a few games needed cracks.. and fifa 98 isnt one og that game.

P.S. I upload the game here http://angernet.org/?id=games.search.results because seems to have some problems with my upload or utorrent."

,sileX84,2008-07-02T14:59Z,"lol. i found out how to play Fifa98 if u have a problem with insufficient memory (it's a message that i receive everytime i want to enter the game). For example i enter in another game (i have Fifa 2006) than i let him in the bar, and than i enter in the game. If it's still not working, try to enter in site with videos from the internet. Does someone have the crack for this game? Thank u"
,Dynamp,2008-07-06T18:30Z,"florentine, la tine merge cumva jocul? Eu l-am instalat si am umblat si la propietatile fisierului .exe, schimbandu-i compatibilitatea, dar pe degeaba. Pana la urma care e problema? "
,Florentin91,2008-07-07T12:21Z,problema e de la faptul ca ai mai mult de 512 rami + memorie virtuala ( windows xp)

,Styloco,2008-09-25T00:52Z,"well florentin91 i guess you are not a naab....

what i mean is this: http://img243.imageshack.us/img243/2184/fifawc98vl3.jpg

there are two games (just like every other EA release @ word cups, like 2002 normal EA game and 2002 WC EA game, 2006 EA game and 2006 WC EA game...)

The french games owns in my opinion and i'm trying to search for it for a long time (not that i'm dying to find it but w/e)

I found on a site that the original game was 45 euro's must have been price inflation cause of the rareness of the game...

Anywas what you are uploading is not the WORLD CUP version but the ROAD TO WORLD CUP RTWC version... unlike the name of the torrent -_-"
,Florentin91,2008-09-28T15:07Z,hmm so u mean this game http://www.soccergaming.com/wc98/ ?
