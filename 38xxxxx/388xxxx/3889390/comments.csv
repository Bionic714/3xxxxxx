,1Fate,2007-11-14T21:36Z,Thanks alot. I couldn't believe that such a greate game like CoD4 doesn't have an option to turn the music off. I never play ANY games with the music on. Oronar...if you think hearing a grenade hit the ground 30 feet away or hearing every word the enemy and friendly soldiers say near you for example instead of hearing an electric guitar isn't atmosphere then you're just dumb. I want to play and HEAR the game not listen to music.
,Do!nK,2007-11-15T18:06Z,nice one! can you make a no intro mod aswell?
,mzfckar,2007-11-15T18:32Z,"wtf ? just turn the music volume to the minimum, idiots. "
,Do!nK,2007-11-15T18:51Z,"mzfckar
there's a difference between mainvolume and musicvolume.
but you would'nt understand that would you chump?"
,liquid_man,2007-11-16T14:41Z,"mzfckar, if you'd play the game you would know there is no option to turn the music off or control its volume."
,marcusjk,2007-12-25T21:07Z,Please seed this game is obnoxious with the music
