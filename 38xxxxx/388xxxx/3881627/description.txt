 Developed by Telltale Games and initially distributed via download through both the Telltale and GameTap Sites; Sam & Max Season One is the sum total of the first 6 episodes of the latest adventures of this crazy crime solving duo. Its release is good news for anyone who couldn\'t tackle the downloads for whatever reason. It\'s also good news for those of us who want to add yet another box to the shelf to build our game collection.

So if you\'re a Sam & Max fan and haven\'t played the recent episodes, then this is your big chance. In fact you don\'t need to be a fan, or even a game player, because Sam (the smart dog in a suit) & Max (the frenetic white rabbity thing) are sure to win you over right from the very start. This game is such a giggle it would make a great introduction to adventure games. It\'s simple point and click, suitable for everyone, so if you own a computer why not join in and have a laugh.
