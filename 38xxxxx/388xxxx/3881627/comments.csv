,Quixo,2009-09-20T11:21Z,"Yey, all of them work. No crack needed and the gameplay is so simple and fun and... thank you oh so much, uploader"
,keldarion,2010-04-21T20:17Z,"i did the beta for all these and season two.  being a hardcore gamer who can be discriminating, i rather enjoyed the adventures of dopey dog and the psychotic bunny.  ty for having this out for us to play it again."
,mcmidas,2010-09-06T19:46Z,"i could use some help here. i've downloaded this torrent without any problems. opened the bin folder. ran the install/ set-up wizard without any trouble. 
but when i go to open any of the episodes, nothing happens. i assume the problem is my own and not the torrent file. 
i'm new to windows, using xp on my mac through something called Parallels 5. any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
,Archonin,2011-01-03T16:58Z,"Awesome upload.
I know how to crack'n fix and all that stuff, but I love when an UL just makes it Install and Play.
Thanks a million for making this one, I got the Wii-version, but want the PC for better graphics and these games are worth playing again.
All Hail Max, the President of US!"
,aaggar,2011-10-06T18:47Z,"When I try and run any of the episodes, I immediately get an error that says ""Sammax10(whichever episode).exe has stopped working"". Any ideas?"
,aaggar,2011-10-06T18:48Z,"Also, I'm on Windows 7"
