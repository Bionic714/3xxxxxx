Description
This album is a really rare one. I haven't (until now) found it in full anywhere on the internet. 
This is definitely a "hard to find" one - the only solo album with Finis Henderson. Many of the world's finest musicians participate on the record and it containS songs that are typical for the 80's.

I've had the LP since the 80's and have been looking for a CDrip for years. 
A late night in November 2007 I found it after many fruitless searches..


Relax, listen and enjoy...and make sure that you to seed it to others!
