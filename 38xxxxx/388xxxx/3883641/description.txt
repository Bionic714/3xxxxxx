24 Conspiracy S01 WITHOUT the spoilerish 'Next' bits

24 Conspiracy Season one. I took out the previews labeled 'Next' because they were spoilerish and ridiculous for one minute episodes. ESPECIALLY when stitched together!!! You wonder which big fat corporate moron came up with that bright idea. If they were gonna put it on the season 4 DVD, they should've had the decency to take them out. Now I took the credits out as well. Their bad. (No, not 'They're', although they ARE worsening ...;))
