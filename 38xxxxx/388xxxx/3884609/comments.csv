,Kinthesky,2007-11-12T04:03Z,Why did aXXo take down their uploads from TPB in the first place? Inquiring minds want to know.
,themhjr,2007-11-13T13:10Z,"Not really, just type aXXo in Pirat4e search up in the left hand section and you will get most of his torrents"
,ELThoro,2007-11-13T17:18Z,"axxo has bailed from TPB. This is official news from the norwegian tabloids (!!!) Some comment on TPB upset him and he decided to withdraw all his releases. All axxo releases on the TPB now are re-releases from other people. Axxo said in the same interview that he will continue his work on another torrent site, failed to mention which one though:("
,BigSniff,2007-11-13T18:01Z,"Is this a fucking aXXo forum or what? Pull your tongues out of his/her ass and let people know what the movie is like and if it's worth the downloading.

Just thought about that comment for a second. I guess it goes without saying the quality of the rip is good but is the movie it self any good?  "
,jayrodathome,2007-11-13T23:55Z,I have a hard time axxo left the tpb becuase of bad comments? if you believe that then your stupid. Axxo has the most sought after movie torrents on the net. 
,jessay,2007-11-14T12:14Z,It is name recognition and bash it all you want on the internet your name is all you have.  You can find axxo torrents on supermundo (something like that) and mininova (although I hate their layout).  As for the movie itself it is a decent british humor movie with nothing extreme.  Overall its not that great but it is free and everyone likes free.  Quality is superb and the movie itself I would give a 6/10 characters were rather weak for being designed to be stand out ones.  The midget was not even that great and who doesn't love to laugh at a homoerotic midget.  
,vaiming3,2007-11-14T20:42Z,this cant be axxo... no way...

,Mahs,2007-11-15T21:26Z,"Ahahaha, this is fucking funny ""I heard SHE's (axxo) busted!"" It's 5people using the aXXo account.. and THEY'RE not busted, aXxo moved to mininova..."
,jasonbir,2007-11-16T03:47Z,"OMFG Hilarious movie, great quality, even though it's not really by aXXo, you couldn't tell. I love british comedy :D"
,trojnohy,2007-11-17T09:48Z,Very funny english comedy. I laughed out loud all the time.
,ruzlis,2007-11-17T12:03Z,Loving it !

,mike{,2007-11-18T19:11Z,"Critic ""this is for 100% a fake a police tracker

If it was an MPAA associated torrent the material would not be there ( you would either stop at 90% or so or it will shot nothing but a monochrome screen )

This is most likely not associated with the MPAA since its been up since 11/11 and it has not been reported yet."

It is small, free and it will play anything. It has support for subtitles and slowmotion. It's the best in my opinion.

Nephropathia, Thanks for the subtitles link and thanks to the guys who uploaded this film, it is real.

If you are worried about the MPAA then just install Peer guardian and block the whole IP address range of your own country... :)  "
,prpl_lvr,2007-11-21T22:48Z,i saw the trailer for this movie it was funny i hope the overall movie is

,emla2bu7a5,2007-11-24T03:34Z,why does axxo never release subtitles with his movies
,peebee55,2007-11-26T14:28Z,"This is probably NOT an AXXO release. Reasons:
1. Look att the ""By"" , It says AXXo-Torrents. AxxO NEVER adress his uploads like this.
2. All aXXo releases contains 3 files. This one has two...And the description lacks aXXos usual information regarding the film plot.

Do not download this movie since we should pay respect to aXXo for his great work. People who tries to ""run piggyback"" on his name should be ashame."

,AlanO,2008-01-03T03:34Z,i also got a picture and no sound!
,AlanO,2008-01-03T03:34Z,no sound!!! :'(
,FthrJACK,2008-01-03T22:39Z,"Ok those of you who are getting no sound need to download the AC3 sound filter. You can get the installer for that here: http://ac3filter.net/project/1/releases

current version is 1.46 and yes, its free, its not big too so is a small download and will fix your issues.

Axxo uses AC3 for almost all of his releases, also you may have noticed other films that say AC3 in the file name, this is why.

Also i recommend VLC player, as it can play most movies without the need for additional codecs as it has its own codecs built in, also you can create custom aspect ratios which is handy if a film is over letterboxed or something, you can get that here: http://www.videolan.org

And again yes its free.


Thanks for the up =]"

Death at a Funeral
Opened August 17th, 2007
Directed by Frank Oz
Chaos ensues when a man tries to expose a dark secret regarding a recently deceased patriarch of a dysfunctional British family.
Why it's Great: The funniest farce and best British humor you'll see in a movie in years. Death at a Funeral takes us back to Frank Oz' comedic roots with a great film that builds momentum as time goes on and turns a typically morbid event into the most hilarious mishap ever. Fans of ""Firefly"" star Alan Tudyk won't be able to stop laughing once he's on the drugs - and it never lets up, it only gets better and better as the story goes on.
