Overview: One of the most renowned Chinese kung fu forms, the Hung Gar Tiger And Crane pattern, demonstrated by Master Chiu Chi Ling, a direct descendant of the style's originator, is a complicated array of fighting techniques employing the physical movements and behavioral aspects of both the tiger and crane in combat. Over one hundred power-generative movements, used to attack and defend in almost any self-defense situation, are analyzed specifically for home study. 
This Southern Chinese Shaolin style is traditionally taught as a process of imitation for the development of power and breath control through various stylized and exaggerated postures which, in the final analysis, are honed into a sophisticated and deadly martial art.
