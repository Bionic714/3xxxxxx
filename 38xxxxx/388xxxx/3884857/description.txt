This is just a quick bugfix release. The problems were in the Virtual C installation but now that has been fixed.

Release Notes from v5.0:

Welcome to the last version of Softmod Installer Deluxe. 

This is basically a combination of SID 3.1 and 4.5 in what it does, however the PBL (Phoenix BIOS Loader) Softmod method has been removed and only uses NKPatcher 11.

You can only install the EvolutionX and UnleashX Dashboard from this (due to the size of the 8mb Memory Card limit), however after you Softmod your Xbox you can proceed to use Auto-Installer Deluxe to install another Dashboard (Xbox Media Center for example) and the rest of the Applications and/or Emulators you want.

Enjoy this release.
