There are some Twats about (artem109)"
,kry1_rygar,2007-11-10T18:06Z,"Don't listen to artem109, he's just a dumbfuck.
.CSO files can include viruses. But if someone puts virus in 1GB files they're pretty stupid.

Very nice torrent. But could you add the games in the description? :P"

,Aza76,2007-12-01T20:55Z,Respect goes out to Aho_Baka_Saru for the awesome work 
,icewall32,2008-01-12T14:37Z,the games did not work with my psp. i tried valkyrie profile lenneth and the game does not load. what do you think is the problem? my firmware version is 3.71 m33-3. anyone know whats going on why the game does not load?
,Aho_Baka_Saru,2008-01-14T23:00Z,"I am not so sure about the new firmwares.
It works fine on my PSP 3.40 OE-A.
I only realy trusted Dark Alex for coustome firmware.
From what I can remember you are using a firmware developed in rusia.
Any way, do you have options like use no UMD ?
This option can somtimes prevent iso's from loading.
Good luck."
,Drowlord,2008-01-18T21:26Z,"Dark Alex was involved in the M33 firmwares, but if I remember the message correctly, he has passed the torch.  I think that the newer M33 firmwares no longer provide a 1.50 core, and something was said about sony changing nids, and some homebrew no longer working."
,jacon6,2008-02-03T01:00Z,Good torrent! Thank you ABS! 
,Syraxius,2008-02-16T08:38Z,"@Drowlord

with the timemachine homebrew release it's possible now"
,rayaraay,2008-03-03T02:53Z,"artem109 at 2007-11-10 17:58 CET: 
contains virus and spyware DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!


dont no but you can scan it ,,, "
,ogredeschnique,2008-03-03T18:11Z,"If a CSO is a compressed ISO, why is Dungeon Siege Bigger than the uncompressed ISO I ripped off the UMD? 

Dark_aleX is the leader (along with like 3 others) of the M33 crew of developers.

The slim-lite PSP doesn't have support for the 1.50 kernal due to different hardware. If your slim Psp has ever had 3.X firmware then it can no longer run Full 1.50. Yes, the Time Machine allows you to run a hybrid of 1.50 & 3.40, but it is not a full propper 1.50.

I have 3.90M33-2 and I can run CSOs. The problem is when it isn't compressed correctly. I downloaded a CSO of ViceCity Stories and it would act like it was going to play, then crash. 

There is a tool that you can use to determine if the CSO you have is pure and proper. 

But I don't remember what it was. Go to Maxconsole dot com. It is a great website and I'm pretty sure you can find the tool there if you search around enough. Or at least someone who can point you in the right direction. Cheers!"
,ogredeschnique,2008-03-03T18:14Z,"I meant to add that all Slim-lite PSP come with 3.x on them. But the theory is that if they had never had any firmware on them YET then they could run true 1.50. 

Where is the EDIT FUNCTION!!??!!??"
,calisleo,2008-03-05T09:01Z,"Excellent Torrent Aho.

Is all the games in english language"
,teklanika,2008-04-29T04:00Z,"Um, one of the games (Blade Dancer) is in Spanish and i can't read the menu's and what not, is there anyway to change this, and are all the games in Spanish?"
,cxwxb777,2008-05-29T23:49Z,ogredeschnique what are you on about you can just use the Pandora Battery trick and downgrade your psp slim. So you can put 3.90 M33 on it

,geamandura,2008-10-07T00:16Z,"I've played Disgaea and it's so-so, it has a huuge intro kiddie-style.

Now I'm playing Jeanne D'Arc which is unbelievably good! Gonna buy this game, I like buying games that I really like :P

The Dungeon Siege was the only one that I didn't even download, I played it on PC a while ago. While the first half of the game was really good, then it suddenly became total shite, like a very very cheap game, was kind of a shock.

And the Final Fantasy Tactics was a total disappointment.

Great torrent anyway!"
