,looneyk,2007-11-13T04:28Z,Cheers big ears!!
,mr_danny_ross,2007-11-13T04:43Z,"If this is real (as it appears to be, judging by comments. But they could be fake too... oh dear) then He0n is a top banana.

Thank you.

Incidentally, I know things are sometimes zipped or rar'd because it's easier to upload small chunks to usenet type BBS, but why when torrenting?

It's annoying enough that AVI doesn't really support previewing. Putting in an archive makes it totally impossible, and thereby most suspect.

AND, if it is real we end up with BOTH archive (which we must keep to seed) AND video eating up disk space.

All for the poxy saving when compressing an already well compressed video!"

Rar rox because no matter how you download if it decompress it means your file is not corrupted.

I hope this is not fake :)"
