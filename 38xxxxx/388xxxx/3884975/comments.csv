,carolinawolf,2007-11-12T19:31Z,"enjoy  , I will keep seeding all day and tonight.

i have to cut my upload speed back to 50 KB/s during the day because i use VOIP telephone. but i can push 130 KB/s at night.

wish my ISP would loosen up a bit i download at 10 mb/s but only can upload at 130 KB/s or 1040 kb/s guess that's not to bad."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-13T02:29Z,"thought i would come back and warn people I'm just before cutting of my seeding. 

there are 2 other seeds showing at this time.

i have been to the forum trying to find out why nothing is showing up in stats. with no luck. guess this will be my last download at the bay this has been up 24 hrs and shows nothing.

,jimandjack,2008-05-27T08:46Z,"I saw this movie when i was 12 or so, heared some about it in school so i asked my mom (b.o. came late and it wasn't a weekend) and after bugging her for some minutes she said ""OK""...

However, i watched this movie through a small hole in a blanket - after the movie finished i wasn't able to leave the room to go to bed lol

This is not Nightmare on Elm Street, no gore no splatter but this flick scared the shit out of me.

One movie came near to Burnt Offerings and that was ""The Ring"" many years later.

This Flick Is worth a try!  ;-)


Sorry for my English."

I remember seeing this at the theater in '76. I was 12 and it was scary as hell! The film is adapted from the novel by Robert Marasco, GREAT book! This movie is from a period when filmmaking didn't depend on over-the-top graphic splatter effects and monster budgets (although there is a fairly violent stunt at the end of the film) and relies on a well-written spooky story, fantastic acting from all the actors and totally effective direction and cinematography (this thing is beautifully shot). If you've seen this film: how can you ever forget Anthony James as that creepy chauffuer! And one of the more subdued performances from the great Bette Davis, who was 68 when she made this. I got to meet Karen Black a couple of years ago and I told her how bad this film scared me as a kid. She grinned and said,""Good. That's what it was supposed to do"". Yeah, I'd say this is one of my favorite films and definitely a classic spook-house film with a twisty end. Speaking of houses, the one used in Burnt Offerings is the same house used (exterior only) in Don Coscarelli's 'Phantasm' (another great film from that era and genre).

Thanks to Carolinawolf for the upload! Nice choice!"
