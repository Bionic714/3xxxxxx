,Reptile JANUS 333,2007-11-27T19:43Z,is a RAR file  u need WinRAR
,fireblade80,2007-12-04T23:43Z,"I have the latest version of WinRAR, it unpacks without error, but the ISO file is damaged (or intentionally left as random binary data - FAKE) and cannot be loaded neither by Nero 8, nor by PowerISO 3.8. I have downloaded the torrent twice and hash-checked it after completion."
,halofubar,2007-12-21T06:57Z,"This torrent perfectly worked for me; dunno what anyone else who had issues was trying exactly. Extracted the r?? files with good 'ol WinRAR, mounted the ISO with ye olde freely-available DAEMON Tools Lite, and was off like a shot. 

The only issues I've had are with the game itself; sometimes it seems to get stuck ""Waiting For Drill"" while, obviously, attempting the drills. At other times it will crash for who knows what reason.

I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't already have at least Chessmaster 10th Edition (Grandmaster Edition, or ""Chessmaster 11"", is practically the same as CM10)."
,jackdullboy44,2008-08-14T18:37Z,"HI 
It is reporting a currupt file 2 times, as I am trying to extract it. First around 81% and 1 more before it finishes.
Should I put it back up, maybe I can get the files from another source?  Any suggestions would be great."
,jackdullboy44,2008-08-14T18:38Z,BTW I am using winrar and daemon tools lite.
