,Nintai,2008-03-17T08:52Z,"887 peers and 21 seeds? Man I have been watching this on spike but it is going tooooo slow so I decided to DL. At this rate I think it will take me over a month to DL. Back to watching spike lol. 

I need Seven of Nine and Tuvok... going into withdrawals."

CAN ANY SEEDERS CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE STILL SEEDING. PLEZ

,rabid.gerbil,2008-11-12T02:36Z,"I can verify these uploads are good uality. There is obviously a trade off between quality and size, but its acceptable.

Now, I have limited my uploads to 5kbps until someone other than me decides to seed.

Seed this torrent, the speed it's at is pathetic."
,lestat420,2009-01-22T11:38Z,"FUCK PEOPLE.... WHOEVER DOWNLOADS THIS SEED FILE... FUCKING SEED!!!!! IVE BEEN STUCK AT 99.9% FOR 3 AND A HALF FUCKING WEEKS NOW, THIS IS FUCKING REDICULOUS..."
,c4sp3r,2009-01-23T06:26Z,great torrent i must admit but in all honesty i would buy the box sets for £12.99 each from play.com because the time it takes to download each series your bound to get caught for copyright i got caught for downloading a game there not watchin u individually there monitoring the torrents i dont no if theres a way to find out but honestly instead of getting a 565 pound or a 1000 dollar fine and spending weeks maybe months to download this i would highly reccomend you buy them from where i said much better video quality 2 and there yours forever nobody can take them away from you 
,240BRAVO,2009-01-27T20:52Z,"hello my fellow pirates. adding to the last comment posted, I know everyone here is leary about buying movies or tv series. but if your willing to spend about 30 bucks you can go to watchdirect dot com, sign up for 30 dollars to get a year membership and the site will give you access to high speed download sites for whatever you want to get. I downloaded the entire voyager series in three days. right now I`m working on tng and its at 93 percent after 2 days. ds9 is at 87 percent, and babylon 5 is at 88 percent, after 2 days. alot of seeders on the sites that direct uses. so if you are willing to spend a few dollars this way is a better alternative to waiting days even weeks for this download. "
,technosailor,2009-05-08T21:59Z,"I'm seeding this until is 150% of it, please so the same.

Hello, I wanna say thank you so much for this, I love space exploration and this is a quality series about it and is also a inspiration for our time and our own space exploration effort.

I'm from a 3rd world country and the reason I'm pirating this, if I'd be living in USA, Canada, EU or any other rich Country I'd be buying this to support this wonderful series, so I suggest you BUY THE DVDs if you have the money."
,watbol,2009-09-25T09:31Z,"I'm gonna seed 'till I watch it all!!!
Be forwarned, that season 6 is .MP4

,herindoors,2009-11-28T19:40Z,"Please seed.  If you've ever DL'd before you know how heartbreaking it is to get to a certain percentage after days (or weeks) of DL'ing and then be stuck.  If you don't you soon will.

Please seed if you can, even if it's just a few kbps.  If we all did that then it would be collectively quicker!"

,segin,2009-12-31T10:28Z,"As for the sixth season being mp4...

For video, AVI is just a container, a box. The video inside of it could be MPEG4 (XviD, DivX, h.263 and h.264 are all MPEG4 variants), or QuickTime, or Windows Media Video, or old Intel Indeo, or Microsoft Video 1, or whatever.

The audio could be various formats, as well, such as MPEG-2 AAC, mp3, WMA, Ogg Vorbis, etc.

AVI (Audio Video Interleave) is a container. A box. As is MP4. An MP4 file could contain pretty much anything an AVI is.

To say that MP4 sucks on quality is *exactly* the same as saying that if you take a pitcher of Kool-Aid that tastes just fine and pour the solution into another pitcher (for the sake of argument, a perfectly clean glass pitcher), that it is going to magically taste like horrid shit because you are now using a different picture. Yes, saying MP4 is crap over AVI is exactly the same as that.

Finally, none of you have social lives, so ""my portable device does not support mp4 containers"" is a bullshit argument, you're always in your collective basements at the PC, you don't need portable devices, and if by some mistake that you have social lives, when you are out and about, you most likely have better things to be doing than watching Star Trek on a little video player (one such better thing is trying to get laid)

So, idiots that keep bitching about Season 6: Shut the fuck up, learn about video containers, and better yet, go back to school and learn what a ""container"" is.

Dumb fucking morons."

you seem bothered... having problems with your social life?"

,wildmanfisher,2010-03-30T16:25Z,"I have barely a hope that it will make a differenct to say what nearly everyone here is saying, but...please, seed this thing. It's taking me three days now to get one season in. Every now and again the dl-rate hits warp speed (excuse the pun), so who-ever is responsible: you're on my christmascardlist...but keep it up!"
,Albylion,2010-05-25T06:13Z,"Do not attempt to download Star Trek Voyager from watchdirect.com or watchdirect.tv.  It's a scam that just gives you a download link to uTorrent and then links to various old torrent sites.  You're better off sticking with TPB, even if you're moving at less than 1KB/sec.  Just make sure you've got a good firewall."
,chazzee23,2010-08-21T03:24Z,"thanx once again! have downloaded this 4 times now, through loss of hard drive. This is one of the most valuable torrents on the internet for me anyway. Thank U!"
,Airoch420,2010-08-21T22:16Z,"@chazzee23

If you got this to 100% plz seed :( I just found out about this site and this is going to take forever. My average is 12 KB/S! Im at 43 hours and 6.5% done. Need a few good people to seed so we can flood this thing out."

,BRZ1980,2010-10-26T03:43Z,"Downloading now, with a 30+ Mbps connection and I am still only managing on average a 100 kBps download speed! This thing needs more seeders and I will be doing my part indefinitely to help others out... The Trek community is supposed to be more communal than this!"
,Mythicos,2010-12-01T22:53Z,"At the time of this posting, 72 people are seeding this.
Thats 72 computers turned on somewhere running up electric bills for your benefit.
Thats 72 people loosing out on a segment of their bandwith for your benefit.

Thats 72 people you should be thanking, regardless of how slow your DL speed is, you ungrateful shits.

...Now how about using these comments for something constructive, like video and audio quality?"

audio on Season 6 is dreadfully low though. "
,Rogerish,2011-02-20T07:37Z,"S-3/E-11, doesn't work, its avi format but won't play on ANY of my media programs (I have all the filters and codecs you can imagine) still won't play. I imagine there are going to be others but I'm not going to go through the whole series to find them this instant. It's a good torrent, S-6 has crappy audio and a few episodes don't work but all in all its a good download. thanks"

,surfbug,2011-06-04T20:00Z,"If anyone has a problem registering any seeders at all, add ""http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce"" to the tracker list and some should appear."
,CrystalT,2011-06-12T13:05Z,"Please seed! Only 13 eps left and been getting only 1kb/s for the past 4 days. Stupid CBS blocked all online versions due to their idiotic deal with netflix. So they're totally unfindable online anymore. :(

*begs on hands and knees for seeders!* :D"
,MACCA350,2011-06-23T02:31Z,"Almost all these episodes are encoded with an audio sampling rate of 32kHz. This is an issue for many playback devices such as the Beyonwiz PVR as they cannot play audio with a 32kHz sampling rate. 

To make these work with the Beyonwiz I had to process them with VirtualDub. 

In VirtualDub you'll need to open video file or set up a batch with these settings:
1 Set the Video to ""Direct Stream Copy"" so it's not processed
2 Set the Audio to ""Full Processing Mode""
3 Set the Audio-Conversion to 48000Hz, leave the rest as ""No Change""
4 Set the Audio-Compression to ""MPEG Layer-3"", select ""Show All Formats"" and choose ""96 kBit/s, 48.000Hz, Stereo""(or similar 48kHz or 44.1kHz should work) then click Ok
5 Select File-Save As AVI or start your batch Save As AVI

Real pain in the arse and wish the encoder had done this properly. There were 13 episodes(1x03-1x05 and 3x18-4x01 that were encoded at 48kHz all the rest were at 32kHz

So either DL something else or fix them if you have an issue.

Cheers"
