Excellent--in the stripped down, rock and atmospheric sense. This is Dave King at his best, and Eddie Clark brings sharp and emotional axework to the table as well.
The title track stands out with a strong chorus, a forte which is later repeated in "Hold On To the Night".
The backbeat and solid chord drive fuel top rocker "After Midnight," and the hallowed vocals make both the verses and chorus among the elite in the band's reportoire.
The slow-to-heavy shifts in "If You Could See" give great mood, while the yearning verses in "Don't Stop the Fight" stand tall. "Get Tough", as well, is especially driving.
Possibly my all-time favorite Fastway cut is "Stand Up," which, while a bit slower paced, is pure atmospheric power. Vocal-driven, bottom-heavy, and powerfully rhythmic.
This soundtrack has become a bit tough to find, but if you see it, grab it.
