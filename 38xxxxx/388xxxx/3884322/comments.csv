,plaztic,2007-11-16T18:16Z,"@hamlund87: Du é jävla flane! aXXo gjorde oss (som inte är l33t nog) en tjänst genom att släppa kvalité och inte kvantitet som de flesta relgrupper (med något undantag). Ser ju inte direkt att du bidragit med något så jag tycker inte du skall överhuvudtaget yppa något om uppladdning, men god jul :)"
,yo_hansi,2007-11-16T23:00Z,"Thank you, aXXo is the man, dont understand why he could just quit on us like that :("
,falkies,2007-11-16T23:17Z,axxo is on mininova and http://axxo-release.blogspot.com/
,listigt,2007-11-17T20:00Z,"""So you love aXXo, but going against his wishes, you a re-uploading his torrents to TPB after he deleted them? He left TPB for a reason, and you are lamers for re-uploading his work.""

Yes he left. So fuck him. The pirate bay is way bigger than some little cry baby. And not uploading what ever you want goes against the whole purpose of being a pirate."

,Christley,2007-11-22T11:46Z,we are piratebay VIPs
,Andre4s138,2007-11-23T18:24Z,"aXXo is NOT the man. It is NOT hard to do what he does. There is far more greater uploaders then him, so i dont understand why we should be sad?

Sure aXXo releses are good, but he get's way to much credd for his work. (but i doubt all releses are his own)"
,djtdon,2007-11-25T22:41Z,"He left because he felt TPB didn't care for there VIP members, because they didn't do anything about organised attacks from the MPAA or some shit lol dont really care theres other places to find his torrents but i also heard he left mininova so its just that darkside site left seen as demonoid got shut down"
,krakilsk...,2007-11-28T04:47Z,"I registered that tpb was down a few hours today, shutdown-attack?

What does MPAA stand for?

BIG PROPPzzz 2 aXXo 4 all he,s given us !
...but time moves on  ^^"
,djtdon,2007-11-28T18:32Z,"@krakilsk... 

i dont even know lol"
,Devils_Reject,2007-12-02T05:06Z,MPAA= motion picture artist association. or is it motion picture association of america? Basically its a group that fights piracy. They slip into torrent sites and upload fakes and viruses or place false comments along with several other things. They do anything they can to stop you from downloading movies. 
,mhackett71,2007-12-13T03:27Z,"I have downloaded a lot of stuff from ebooks software, movies, etc...

AND AXXO WAS ALWAYS THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCE HERE... 

It may be easy to do, but it isnt his JOB, he did it for us, and quite often, yes, he isnt a god, but wasting hours downloading junk, or find AXXO;s torrent, i would always gladly wait for his cut.... 

Sorry i couldnt find him here.. maybe its a phase, or someone else step up to the plate, and be our MOVIE GOD :-P 

Peace out Ya'll"
,maradnus,2007-12-18T04:06Z,"I feel the same way, He didi all for us, I think thats brilliant for some one to give so much and at a good standard, They wernt all ways the best but bloody damm good.

Ok, Yes he did get a load of atention, But so dose any one who dose anything out of the ordary!! "
,cozmo_d,2008-01-02T03:09Z,"Where did you people learn how to spell?

I thought our Government was collecting massive quantity's of money from the lottery's to teach you  
how to read & write? O woops I forgot they are stealing it all, thats why you monkeys cant spell
or write. Sad day   "
,BatistaSL,2008-01-06T05:11Z,God Knows how I miss axxo. 
,Ima_User,2008-01-07T02:16Z,"DEAD LINK, TORRENT NO LONGER USEFUL"
,shanialowe,2008-01-17T18:02Z,"@cozmo_d
You stupid pathetic excuse for an asshole. You talk about spellings, reading and writing when your own wretched grammar makes you write 'quantity's' where it should've been 'quantities' and 'lottery's' in place of lotteries. This site's not for development of the language but people like you somehow feel the need to deeply embarrass yourself. Sad day indeed, if not for you then at least for those two morons who made you possible.
P.S. It's spelt 'whoops', dickhead."
,Lucky13s,2008-02-04T02:08Z,"Ok. We all agree, axxo was a very very reliable source of movies on TPB, but hes gone now... Deal with it. There are many other uploaders out there that can offer the same as axxo. 

And cozmo_d... the majority of users on TPB do not live in North America, so their spelling may be incorrect. Who gives a shit, it's still readable. Stop trying to seem like your important because you have proper English spelling and grammer on an international website. English is one of the hardest languages to learn. The English language has words that are spelt the same but sound different, or have a completely different meaning. This makes learning english extreamly confusing to some. cozmo_d your a dick, piss off."
,kesogay,2008-02-10T21:53Z,Andre4s138.......! Axx0 is the #1 uploader ffs!

You're a pseudo-intellectual tit.  Without the intellect.

I notice you haven't uploaded a single torrent.

,lykknis,2008-06-27T04:19Z,Volta... Shut the fuck UP!!!!!!!!!!!! aXXo was one the best up loaders TPB will probably ever have. So get it over it. Just because your not like him doesn't mean you have to take the shit out of him!
,atavis,2008-07-01T07:19Z,"uhhh... lykknis, did you bother reading Volta's comment?

He basically just said ""hey, nice job axxo""

and then you told him to shut the fuck up and agreed with him at the same time."

,razzell2,2009-04-02T14:07Z,"seems as tho axxo has disappeared again. 
he hasnt posted any releases on his current release site, for about 3 weeks or so.
maybe he is in Cabo, or maybe he is in hollywood taking care of his new career...something called ""hollywood is burning"", the story of axxo. 
its a vuze download i think. check it out."
