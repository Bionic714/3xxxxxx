,ZigZagon,2007-11-11T14:04Z,Don't DL! Its the same crappy image and sound quality as the others already released so far.
,Zjohn,2007-11-11T20:20Z,If the quality really is that bad then we should all just let Ltt_Fr1's torrents die and ignore him. I will however give this one a try. :)
,scientificz,2007-11-12T13:42Z,Yo uploader get the fucking quality right before you say its a screener this is the same R5 Telecine release you pussy Scientific
,Dorre76,2007-11-12T18:28Z,"TC Quality, if your a demanding / fussy viewer wait for a proper quality screener!"
,Dorre76,2007-11-12T18:30Z,"BTW the uploader himself states its a TS-quality


quote from the file info with this release
""> SOURCE.....[ DVDSCR ??? Quality TS """

,xniper111,2007-11-12T22:09Z,"Is this worth downloading or not ? Can anybody post som screens or something? 

Thanks "
,jamie2000,2007-11-13T14:07Z,Nothing wrong with this. Respect to uploader.
,Dorre76,2007-11-13T18:54Z,"DVD Quality can only be DVD Quality, this clearly is TeleCine, its not awful but its not either full DVDQuality, sorry to say, its watchable but that still dont make it DVDQuality, the screen is a bit blue and its a bit dark and the sound is a little choppy, the picture is also a bit grainy just like any other TC."
,Dorre76,2007-11-13T18:57Z,"its really a simple case if you scroll up and read the uploaders first message, its says:

"" Ltt_Fr1 at 2007-11-09 19:08 CET:
Quatity TS !!""


i just dont get what all the fuss is about, the guy that uploaded it in the first place says its TS... he should know you would think, not?"

,shured,2007-11-17T12:48Z,"Nice, tnx. "
,airrazor81,2007-11-17T21:50Z,"I don't understand, someone's offering something for nothing and is consistently cr**ped on.  Just rate it how you see fit ?/10 it's not that hard.  Vulgarities and insults will just cause these people to stop uploading.  Thanks for this film, it looks really good. I will enjoy watching it tonight. "
,checkeredshirt,2007-11-18T02:19Z,"This torrent sucks because:

1) it's a camera recorded video
2) its broken up into 2 avi's"
,gomzi,2007-11-19T17:11Z,"So dont donwload, simple, atleast dont b!tch the uploader please"
,artgrrl,2007-11-20T10:33Z,"Nothing wrong with this torrent, downloaded it in two hours (!) and it's a good quality, except for the sound, but who cares? It's a nice preview before buying the original dvd!"
,scotskitten,2007-11-20T20:28Z,Thanx for the DL mate. 7/10
,fishf00d,2007-11-21T14:11Z,"Horrible quality people!
Just letting you know so you don't waste your time downloading it"
,larslane,2007-11-21T23:21Z,The Problem Is people are saying that movies are dvdscreeners and thier not . They need to get thier shit right before thye put it one here.
,wolvy23,2007-11-22T15:21Z,"I think the reason alot of people bitch is because of DVDSCR in the title, which this file is definatly not.  I get really annoyed too when people put TC in a file tittle, when the film is obviously a Cam thats TS (Telesynced).. learn the difference please between Telecine, (TC) and Telesynced (TS).  Its like night and day.  And dont put SCR anywhere in the filename unless its a screener. Or DVD for that matter."
,kotkot27,2007-11-23T13:16Z,"very bad picture it's not dvdscr
don't download"
,Khiem123,2007-11-23T22:31Z,OK!!!!...people be honest!!!!is this movie watchable...good grafic or is is crap??...
,mariootje,2007-11-24T20:21Z,thanx for the dl.... Keep up the good work!! And for the rest STOP bitching if you're not satisfied just wait and buy the f*cking dvd.......................
,g0nadz,2007-11-26T15:22Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE!!! Quality is ok: my video/audio rating 3 stars out of 5.... DO NOT DOWNLOAD BECAUSE THE ENDING IS INCOMPLETE. You do not get to find out how the movie really ends. Sure the hero always wins but you don't get to find out exactly how. God damn it to who ever seeded this first!!!
,star.super,2007-11-26T16:48Z,"R5 LINE copy released by mVs is the best copy around:

,HackerBuB!,2007-11-27T17:03Z,Not great quality but thats what you get when you donÂ´t wanna pay and just canÂ´t wait ;D  The movie is amazing but the book is of course better. The writer had one wird but brilliant mind =P
,Rocksteaddy,2007-11-28T09:58Z,"why write ""DVDSCR"" in the title when its actually TS? I mean, what fag screens a TS DVD?"
,ThePresentTime,2007-11-29T14:48Z,Zzz... Do some People have Lifes... Dont Think Soo...
,emgee,2007-11-30T21:19Z,"checkeredshirt:
Stupid is what you are.
1) The description clearly states it's in TS quality, so no fault there.
2) The two avi's you're complaining about are these: A) The movie. B) A short sample for preview.

Keep off the commenting system from here on, stupid!"
