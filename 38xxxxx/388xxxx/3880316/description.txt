Flight Enhancer is a scenery utility which enhances the visual quality of Flight Simulator. It does this by enhancing the quality of the sky, (day, dawn, dusk, night), the water, the clouds, the sun, runway/airport lights, and the environmental reflection by replacing the default Flight Simulator textures with the new realistic custom textures. It gives the user the choice to choose from thousands of textures options through an easy yet powerful interface. With Flight Enhancer you will now have stunning blended skies, realistic clouds, realistic water with clouds reflections, stunning sun and corona textures, real world airport lights, and ultra realistic environmental reflection.
