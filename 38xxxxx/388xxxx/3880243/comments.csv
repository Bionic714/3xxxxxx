I agree with dumilum, if you like Hertzfeldt's movies, do your best to support him directly by picking up a DVD or t-shirt or something:  http://www.bitterfilms.com 

I can also vouch for the coolness of this DVD. There's over a hundred ""pages"" of sketches and deleted stuff, an easter egg that plays a different version of the movie, and a neat little booklet of writing.

Love that guy!"
