	This is an AVI  rip of the new Don Hertzfeldt film, newly released on DVD by Bitter Films.  If you want the full disc complete with sketches, production notes, deleted scenes, etc., see the DVD-R version that I uploaded here.   If you like this, please consider buying it on DVD direct from Bitter Films - it's really cheap, and pure genius.  Hertzfeldt's other films can be found on the KG tracker, here and here.

This is one of Hertzfeldt's best animated shorts, continuing the psychedelic, experimental style of Rejected and The Meaning of Life.  This one is not quite as lengthy or as epic as the latter, but it is still amazing and mindblowing, and it's only the first part of a two-part series!  Don Hertzfeldt has absolutely no peers in animation - he hand draws everything, uses old-fashioned stop-motion animating techniques, and all special effects are in camera.  No computers used at all!  This gives the films a beautifully handcrafted feel, and permeates everything with an atmosphere familiar from classic silent and experimental films.

This film was the winner of the Jury Prize in Short Filmmaking at Sundance in 2007.
