,DeSert1337,2008-02-12T15:00Z,"PLZ! HELP!... When i try to extracting the mdf and mds file it says 
""!Write error: only NTFS file system supports files larger than 4 GB!"" ... ive also tryed with the IZARC but thats still doesnt work.. Plz help me with this one :/ NOTICE; I got lot of space left at my hd :/.."
,olivo,2008-02-17T23:49Z,"Your supposed to extract the files to get an ISO(image) file, which you either burn or mount with alcohol120% or deamon tools( which is included in the torrent)"
,olivo,2008-02-18T21:53Z,"Srry but my message before this was theoretical, anyway the mdf file you get is a different sort of image file than ISO but it works the same way. All you need to do is mount it with daemon tools( which is included in the torrent) and install the game( cd key needed). Although the daemon tools included in the torrent should work, it was not the one i used. Heres the link to the version i used

Heres a cd key you can use:

75GU-Y6UV-7YSM-EHRF-0DZV-LAN0

P.S Ty for uploading this game i will seed for some time being"

,MyUserName0027,2008-05-06T22:00Z,"""Conflict with Emulation Software detected.""
Installed, mounted, etc. How come it doesn't seem to work? There was no crack file, so I assume that all I need was to mount. What's there left to do?"
,MyUserName0027,2008-05-06T22:30Z,"Got Daemon to finally mount, then when I tried to play it, the screen was black, but had audio. Now what to do? >."
