I prefer keygens though."
,Habeebit,2007-12-04T07:01Z,"how about thanks. if you want a keygen, go find a keygen. don't click here and say how much better a keygen would've been."
,Sempai_x,2007-12-16T20:19Z,"How about a keygen? 

>.>

Great up.
Thanks a lot."
,Oblivion_4,2008-01-24T19:47Z,Um can't you find this free by googling mac flash dreamweaver and fireworks
,Oblivion_4,2008-01-24T19:48Z,oops macromedia not mac like steve jobs horrid creations lol
,BrandGSX,2008-02-04T15:00Z,"actualy I like the SN included so

Thanks!

Beats having to worry about a virus in the keygen. If you want a keygen then its not hard to find one. Takes 2 seconds here or on google."
,bluesskyflyer,2008-03-03T20:35Z,"serial does work ok with Fireworks, (didn't try dreamweaver as i have a version of that installed already).  Anybody know please how to enter serial in the flash programme. I installed it but the only options it offers for registration are online or by mail?  Can't see anywhere to insert a serial? That said, it doesn't come up with anything saying it's a trial version?"
,rickyisking,2008-03-13T22:47Z,"i agree wit Habeebit mabey the uploader wud like a bit of appreciation instead of bein told wat would be better at the end of the day ur not paying for this are you so u shouldnt complain if u want keygens go hear

,torrentmuncher92,2008-06-19T21:48Z,"thanks a lot, great torrent, very fast d/l speed "

Mac is one million times better than the crappy shit system Windows, so stfu?
Anyway, thanks.

And yea, keygens do suck."
,FW13,2008-08-05T21:36Z,Excellent!  Thanks :)
,downloader12345,2008-08-11T13:07Z,"Thanks for download,

also

""Mac is one million times better than the crappy shit system Windows, so stfu?""

When Mac have produced a desktop operating system which forms the arms and hands of virtually all modern computing (we can call Unix and its cousins the backbone), and have produced a hugely adopted well-rounded development environment, and a killer office app, come and talk

That is, when they stop releasing half-baked  selling-points-over-innovation garbage like the iPod, iPhone and Macbook air

rawrrr"
,Nitzrokk,2008-08-11T20:39Z,"Thanks for the download, it works great! I keyed one program after installation, and after I installed the next two they'd automatically been keyed as well. They however, cannot be registered on the official website because the serial has obviously been compromised... but who gives a shit? =D

Scanned with Avast! and no viruses/malware were found.

Fuck your Macs, and moreover fuck your iPods one thousand times over in the ass with a broomstick. Most of all, fuck your trends you goddamn sheep who loves the television.

... still a great torrent. =D"
,reventime93,2008-08-16T19:30Z,"why dosent the  serial work it sayz

,seercirra,2008-09-04T16:44Z,"if somebody were to download this and use it to create websites/put them online. and/or sell those websites, could that person be found out?
if that person were to use this to create flash apps that were sold, could he be found out?

cheers."
,gobit,2008-10-31T22:15Z,Three wonderful programs together! Thank you very much!
,Sam_Uk,2008-11-11T18:28Z,"If I was to create a website on the newer Macromedia; would I be able to open it on an older version in college?
Someone please respond asap.
Or email me: curlymansam@hotmail.co.uk"
,wcat552,2008-11-26T20:22Z,"How the hell can a Crack, Patch or Keygen be better than a Serial. Serials (In a .txt) have 0.00% chance of being a Virus/Spyware etc.

Where a Crack, Patch or Keygen may have a 70% chance of being a Virus. :/"
,btbam006,2008-12-01T05:09Z,"Great download, thanks. NO VIRUS! Scanned all with AVG up to date. All programs work perfect with the sn"
,rakesh47,2009-01-02T11:07Z,Is there a procedure to make this trial version as full version. please help me and can any1 give insrtuctions.
,parrotperson,2009-01-04T13:24Z,"Very nice little download, no viruses as yet and as far as I know a fairly new version, my 1st time using a serial, did it in fireworks, but in flash I don't know what to do and if it did it automaticly or not, hope it works, ty passionettez, will seed for a few weeks, very happy, this should help me a lot."
,tinyfirefly,2009-03-27T03:14Z,"So i downloaded it and installed it. and the serial went through at the time of installation, but after i started using flash, adobe's site popped up asking me to update my profile and that my serial was invalid. should i be concerned?"
,necrojesta,2009-04-20T16:23Z,"Thanks loads, dreamweaver was not needed but thank you for the great programs and the serial."

,Flaxe17,2010-02-16T11:41Z,"Wow - Thanks so much to Passionettez!

Scanned, its virus free, serial (my favourite), and yeah just everything works.

BIG UP :D"
,Yoshistr,2010-03-04T20:35Z,"!! VIRUS WARNING VIRUS !!

The flash installer will install a file called:
C:\WINDOWS\ajunocesofihutaf.dll

which is a malware that probably has an integrated keylogger and personal information stealer.

The following registry key will be added to automatically start the virus:

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\

name=ajunocesofihutaf
value=rundll32.exe ""C:\WINDOWS\ajunocesofihutaf.dll"",Startup


Removal Instructions:
Run msconfig by Start-Run type msconfig and hit Enter, go to the start up tab and uncheck the virus ajunocesofihutaf, click Ok then when it asks to restart select No.

Now download MoveOnBoot and install it, go to C:\WINDOWS\ find the file ajunocesofihutaf.dll and right click it, from the MoveOnBoot Menu select DeleteOnBoot, restart your computer and the virus should be removed.

Make sure you do another msconfig remove after rebooting as the file no longer exists and you will receive an error message unless you remove the start up registry key.


Note to uploader:
Stop spreading viruses and malware on torrents.

If you want this torrent just use the contained key do not any of the executable files especially the Flash one!

Serial:

WPD800-58436-27232-80204 "
,lolcats00,2010-05-24T18:03Z,"wow, this is a great torrent! no problems at all except for an invalid serial, which i expected but should be able to get around. thanks passionettez!"
,magwhich,2011-03-13T04:43Z,"i got fireworks up and running but when i install flash it gets to the install bar and stops, anyone have similar problems?"
,chuckdm,2012-04-17T21:47Z,"@Sam_Uk That depends on the site.  Yes, it will download and open, but if there are special comments or something in the code (Dreamweaver can annotate files using comments that aren't saved in the code itself) then those may or may not show up.  So yes, it will work, but you may be missing a very, very few extras.

To everyone else: Do not download any newer version of Dreamweaver or Fireworks than this.  CS, CS2, and CS3 (and whatever the fuck else they're up to now) add NOTHING except several extra gigs of BLOAT.  Every useful feature ever added to a Macromedia/Adobe product is present in version 8.  Upgrading to any newer version is pointless - more DRM, potentially dangerous cracks (instead of a simple corp serial), gigs upon gigs of useless bloat, niche features that NOBODY uses, and load times that will probably complete just after your funeral.  Why on earth you'd run anything newer is beyond me - just get this and enjoy."
,chuckdm,2012-04-17T21:57Z,"While I'm at it...

@Yoshistr nope, no such file.  Installed, been running for 3 months, never got that file.  I check my startup entries once a week on ""security day"" (run a full virus and malware scan, etc.) and I have yet to see that file or any other.  Also, your instructions are wrong.  Get precess explorer, kill the rundll process, then just remove from startup.  No need for MoveOnBoot etc.  But again, not in this torrent - guess something else must've infected ya.

@Oblivion and downloader12345 You're both wrong.  Macs are bad.  Windows is worse.  Linux pwns you all.  Macs are like Linux with Training wheels - a practical way for unskilled idiots to do something better than walking.  Windows is like walking with one foot stuck in a bear trap - only better than being stuck in one place your whole life by a tiny little bit.  Linux, however, is like a souped-up tricked-out Harley - faster, more agile, and several orders of magnitude more badass, but prone to very fatal user error if the user doesn't know exactly what the fuck they're doing.

In any case, WINE FTW!"
,Sergeant_Mark_IV,2012-05-10T03:51Z,I'm on Windows 7 and Fireworks is working 100%. Didn't tested other programs yet. I will keep seeding it.
