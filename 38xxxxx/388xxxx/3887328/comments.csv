,TheQualityman,2007-11-13T17:36Z,"Hey guys, I dont know if it´s the same with u guys but all my files with 720p have poor sound quality. By that i mean the volume tag is not very high. Is there anything to be done? Thanks in advance."
,Iffa,2007-11-14T00:14Z,I actually can't get this to work and it's a persistent problem that i'm having with these 1 gig plus movies. The lower quality ones play perfectly but VLC won't even start this one and i've got the latest CCCP codec.  Any ideas?
,Iffa,2007-11-14T00:22Z,"welp

downloaded latest version of VLC and it works swimmingly"
,DadudEdje,2007-11-20T00:36Z,"Great stuff.
