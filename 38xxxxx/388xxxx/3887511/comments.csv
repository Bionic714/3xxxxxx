,barfraser,2007-12-03T09:33Z,"I keep getting asked for a CD? Anyone able to help me, please?"
,swisstim82,2007-12-04T04:54Z,I get the same message asking for the CD or ESC?! How do you get passed this?
,wizzoh,2008-01-16T07:55Z,"to get past the CD request, you should use Toast to mount the .dmg (in toast, hit cmd+shift+m and select the disk image [.dmg] file) That should clear that up, if you don't have toast, you should be able to find it here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3934590/ROXIO_TOAST_TITANIUM_8_MAC_OSX___SN.zip

good luck."
