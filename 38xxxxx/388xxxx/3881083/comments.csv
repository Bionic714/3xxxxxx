,Shmorky,2012-03-26T00:52Z,"I am at 99%. The video plays fine in Windows Media Player, but the sound track is a 1 or 2 seconds off. Video is below average quality, maybe 4/10, looks like a home VHS transfer, but good luck finding a better copy! This smart film has never been released on VHS or  DVD to my knowledge."
,Shmorky,2012-03-26T00:57Z,"Also, for me, the video plays for the entire 2 hr and 57 minutes, I don't know why the previous commenter had a problem. Try a different player?"
,x1212,2012-06-03T10:15Z,Please seed. This has been at 99% for a while.
