,dark_light,2007-12-02T17:18Z,"read by Gene Engene, a well known audiobook reader. The mp3 are heavily compressed, bitrate is low 48 and you can realy hear that telephone sound quality and that's a pitty. Otherwise sounds like something I wanna get. "

Please seed this. I very much want it. Yes its at 48db but still fun to listen to while at the gym with noise canceling head phones. 
I actually have the original 22 paperbacks. Started reading them in boot camp no less as they were first coming out. Funny that the collection is worth allot now. I've read the series 3 times now. Fun.  So anyways i saw you out there with 100% and now i need you to come back and seed.. TIA"
,Corbell,2007-12-27T17:19Z,"I'm at 90.5%... I need someone with 100% to top me off. I've seeded 8.5 gigs so fare and will more but please come back and send the rest. 

For the rest of you out there if you look some of the whole books can be got. Just some are not done yet."
,gjutar_tobbe,2008-05-14T21:37Z,"please seed i`m at 97,8%"
,ThisMellowMan,2008-08-24T18:01Z,"This series is pretty torn up, lots of pieces missing. I started going through the series with WINAMP and playing each segment. Many of them won't play at all. Try the first 8 segments of Casca 03 - Casca The War Lord for instance. When I first discovered this I deleted the whole series and downloaded it again thinking I'd done something wrong. But I got the same results.

Am I wrong? Can somebody verify this, because I really like the series. A different seed is on IsoHunt, so I'm trying that. 

I sure hope I'm wrong, and if I'm right maybe temere can fix and reseed. Thanks for temere for the series though."
,jjgarcia,2008-09-08T19:42Z,"im stuck at 99%, ratio is 3.67. want to complete it... please reseed.."
,jegg,2009-10-19T20:30Z,"Thanks a lot temere!

Does anyone have the rest of the series? According to my information there should be a few more, but I am not sure if they are recorded in audio.

Casca 23: The Liberator
Casca 24: The Defiant
Casca 25: Halls of Montezuma
Casca 25.5: The Outcast (illegal story)
Casca 26: Johnny Reb
Casca 27: The Confederate
Casca 28: The Avenger
Casca 29: Immortal Dragon
Casca 30: Napoleon's Soldier 

Anyone have some more info on Casca publications and recordings in English or Swedish?"
,jegg,2009-10-19T23:01Z,"Oops, I forgot the new

Casca 31: The Conqueror

By the way, only the 22 first books are actually written by Barry Sadler himself. When he died somebody got hand on the rights to Casca and let some different spoke writers continue. But, they migh be good anyway.

No 23, 24 and (the bootleg, direct to tape) 25.5 were written by Paul Dengelegi, no 29 by Michael B. Goodwin, and the rest by Tony Roberts.

Anyone who have read/listen to them? Any good?"
,joakal,2011-03-13T21:55Z,"do you have these books in an actual ebook format
? i cant seem to find the complete collection anywhere! i even resorted to going to the library lol."
