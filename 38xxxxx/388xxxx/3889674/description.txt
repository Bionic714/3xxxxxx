This file should work on all portable players able to play open Divx (MPEG-4) in 320 x 240 resolution.
It has been tested on a PocketPC (PPC) running TCPMP (free download available)
Should work on most divx devices with low resolution display.

Why: Because downloading/ripping, encode and transfer a movie takes forever, 
especially when you just need to grab a movie for your portable device and run.
Using low resolution keeps movies small, and gives your portable less processing and thus more battery life.
Download might be faster too :-). Dont even think of watching this on a TV or PC (unless you are desperate)
