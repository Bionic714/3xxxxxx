www.digital-mysteries.com

The guys behind the year 2002 idea
called ""Beebylon"" showed it to Dreamworks
in order to get some backup finishing the project and this was Dreamworks way of showing appreciation I suppose..

,skitzosfury,2007-11-21T18:30Z,"@rouusa1, im guessing your trying to burn the .avi file to dvd. if you are the file needs to be converted befor it will work in any dvd player. if you have the lateset version of nero then use nero vision to transcode the video. As for useing clonedvd to burn an .avi file, its not gonna happen. if your verion of nero is outdated or for what ever reason it dont work,  look for Cucusoft AVI to VCD DVD MPEG Creator Pro that will convert it for you for sure."

,Mommywolf,2008-10-22T23:21Z,"Yah, the SWEDES happen to think a lot of things have been stolen from them. It happens to be a re-ocurring theme amongst that lot. If you know any Swedes donÂ´t mention cinnamon rolls or youÂ´ll get an ear full! As for the Movie, I am sure there would be a huge law suit where it really stolen from the Swedes. I am still trying to find a valid torrent for this movie so please seed if you have it, Swede or not. Thanks"
