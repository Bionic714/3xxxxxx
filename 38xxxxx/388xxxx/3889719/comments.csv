,BroderickG,2007-11-16T05:30Z,Awesome upload. Thanks man
,predator00,2007-11-22T09:36Z,"I had the same problem SpecialED3.  Tracks 8 and 11.  If you import it to Itunes, those 2 tracks dont copy over correctly and they don't register that they are by Dane Cook"
,SHaDOW_PHaNTOM,2007-11-25T21:12Z,"I'm having a problem deciding whether this is your rip or not eraser.  Why are all the songs different bitrates?  Also, tracks 8 and 11 don't import right, because all the info is missing.  All the others have Artist, Genre, Album, Track #, etc. filled in, but 8 and 11 don't.  So to get them to import correctly in iTunes just go in and add the info.  But still not understanding why there is about four different bitrate levels present if it's your rip.  Seems more likely that you downloaded them all from limewire and then uploaded them, or something."
,eraser851,2007-12-04T01:15Z,"I honestly don't know what could be wrong with those two tracks. 
I ripped them directly from the CD. I didn't download them individually. 

No idea what the problem would be. "
,white95sl2,2008-01-25T19:51Z,"Wow this cd sucks... I guess I missed the ""live"" part... some SERIOUS echo. Hard to listen to."
,eraser851,2008-02-04T01:35Z,"Wtf did you think it was? 
A Dane Cook Studio recording?
"
,ChristianJnsen,2008-02-25T13:27Z,"Does that even exist ? Comedy , recorded in a studio ? :S I agree Eraser , wtf did you think it was ! ?"
,blag117,2009-01-05T04:51Z,"dude, been looking for this shit forever, awesome upload"
