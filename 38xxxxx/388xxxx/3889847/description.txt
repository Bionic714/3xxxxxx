Episode 019: Panoramas!

Joseph, also known as BlueMojo, has made a screenrecording about the panorama software Hugin. And of course I had to try it too!

I installed Hugin on Ubuntu 7.10 - I?ll post some quirks I had to circumvert later. Then I went out on to my street and shot a series while I turned 360┬░. I followed Josep?s advice and set exposure, white balance and focus to manual.

Here are some links for you to explore:

    * The files from Joseph and me for download are linked in the next post. There is a feed problem.
    * The Hugin project homepage.
    * Wikipedia entry about panoramas with some excellent examples. Including the chinese drawing from the show.
    * A blog entry about shooting panoramas on a site about linux and photography. The blog is worth to explore and there is more to come.
    * A list of all the Lottofeen in the German TV. ;-)

And here is your challenge: Make a panorama with Hugin (or another Open Source Software) and put it into the meetthegimp.org photogroup at 23. On (or after) Friday Dec. 14 I?ll ask a guest to draw one of the entries in a pure scientifically randomized way. ;-) The winner will get a code for a year of ?plus? membership at 23 (value 20?). And in the last show before Christmas I?ll show all the images in a special last 2007 episode.
