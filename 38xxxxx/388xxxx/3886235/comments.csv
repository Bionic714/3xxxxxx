TPB said it would never censure.

Seems they have no problems censuring my comments about the matter... 

Thanks to all who went out of their way to agree or disagree... ( funny, only the disagreeing comments were left, even though I took a neutral stance. )

So I geuss it's ok at TPB to censure when 
it suits their ego... hypocrites !

THE REAL AXXO IS AT MININOVA AND TORRENTBOX... 
( the next #1 & #2 torrent spots... )

*aXXo doesn't create sites, but he sure does 'make' them.... truth hurts, doesn't it ?

I do like the fact that TPB does nt delete comments (except for a certain case) - thats freedom. But it was sure nice to have aXXo here. TPB should have him back.

Every few months it seems the FBI manages to come up with yet more people to charge in connection with Operation D-Elite - the joint ICE and FBI raids against the US-based BitTorrent tracker, EliteTorrents, in 2005.


Everyone charged so far has been accused of being involved in the uploading of Star Wars Episode III which, at the time, was a pre-release movie, carrying criminal implications for the uploaders under the Family Entertainment Copyright Act.


According to an announcement by Assistant Attorney General Alice S. Fisher of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Patrick L. Meehan for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a seventh defendant has pleaded guilty.

ADSO AXXO
An Duc Do, aged 25, of Orlando, Florida, has pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Legrome D. Davis of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on a two-count felony. He?s charged with conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and criminal copyright infringement.


Do is the latest in a line of people pleading guilty in this operation against EliteTorrents. Previous guilty pleas and convictions include those of Scott McCausland, Grant Stanley, Sam Kuonen and Scott D. Harvanek.


In this copyright case tried in the criminal (rather than civil) legal domain, potential punishments are harsh. Do is facing up to 10 years in prison coupled with a fine of $500,000.


He will be sentenced on February 27th, 2008.

Being that some guy claims that AXXO was taken out by the FEDS... I wouldn't put it past them to be posting all these torrents up by themselves, so they can go after the little guys too...especially after that big win for the music industry....the one were the lady has to pay an astranomical amount of money back to them for seeding songs. No....AXXO is dead to me....you are only fronting & using his name for yourown purposes...whatever they may be & I'm not willing to find-out what they are when the FEDS are lurking in the not too distant background. You may think I'm a Anti-P2P for saying this, but I will say it anyways...I'm to the point were I think it's well worth waiting for the damn movie to be released on DVD & paying the dollar it'll cost me to rent it for the night if I rent it at a RED-BOX machine.

When I finished watching it I spent a good 20 min. (atleast) trying to think of the last time I saw such a stupid and ridiculous movie. Im sure Ive seen one AS dumb, but certainly not more dumb. Dont waste a DVDR disc on this movie before you actually watch it (like I did). If it hadnt been for my roommate watching it with me, I would have turned it off after the first 20 minutes. I still feel sick from it. Movies just arent supposed to be this bad until the 2nd or 3rd (or even 4th) sequel. I guess you would have to be a really big fan.

The opening scene is great pure carnage worth watching for sure.  And another thing timmy if you see this i would like to know what movie u have seen that u thought was good?  I want to see the movie that makes your incredibly high standards cause it seems like everything sucks to u so something that you think is average is probably awsome.  Peace all

you only single them out because they are easy to discriminate against.

let me guess, you also complain about how many asians there are in the tourist business.  and how their good math is all a guise to calculate out how to build the mother bomb to destroy earth.

why dont you complain about how many Caucasians there are in the world, certainly could do with less of them.  make it so minorities are less minority and more majority. "

,richto,2009-06-21T16:04Z,"a) Jews are not a race, they are a religeon. As an example there are black Ethiopian Jews. So whatever discriminating against them might be, it isnt racist.

b) People tend to use the term 'Jews' when they mean 'Israeli Jews'. 

The Israelis certainly are guilty of running a terrorist state (as defined in at least 2 Amnesty International annual reports), with numerous well documented cases of human rights abuses, war crimes and genocide - especially against children, as well as the ongoing illegal occupation of the West Bank. 

Nice to see a US president finally taking action on that. The USA has sponsored terrorist states for years (e.g. $1 billion+ of funding and training for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, and tens of billions to Israel)  so about time 9/11 made you realise what comes around goes around.

c) This isnt the place for it, but if you have to state it then at least get your terminology right."

every worthy torrent downloader knows that this aint the real aXXo since aXXo's torrents always are anonymous, and btw aXXo dosent upload on TPB, and im not sure if he uploads anywhere else :P

While most people that download a torrent do not receive notices, a select few of us do. To those of us that have received 2, just be extremely weary that a 3rd will result in disconnection or whatever they said.

So if you are flagged I do not recommend downloading this torrent."
