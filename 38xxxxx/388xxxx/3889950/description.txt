ENGLISH LANG FIX FOR GEARS OF WAR RELOADED


1) i assume you have the razor\\\'s or reloaded startup.exe crack (both works ,maybe the THERMOPYLAE also)

2) open file lang.txt located in ..\\\\Binaries and paste the code 0409 only / then save it.

3) delete the PCTOC.txt and PCTOC_ESN.txt located in \\\\WarGame

4) download this rar: http://www.zshare.net/download/4784627a045547/
unrar it and paste the PCTOC.txt in the path before you deleted the old PCTOC (\\\\WarGame)
there are another 3 files (Startup_int.upk +..+..) inside this rar , paste them in path ..\\\\WarGame\\\\CookedPC

5) download this rar http://www.zshare.net/download/4776363745b8e0/
unrar and paste the folder in ... WarGame\\\\Localization (replace the old crap INT folder)

6) download 2 rars here: (66mb+66mb)
part1: http://www.zshare.net/download/4778033f3af5c6/
part2: http://www.zshare.net/download/4778019e335c69/
unrar ,there is 1 folder inside : INT
paste this folder in ... \\\\WarGame\\\\CookedPC\\\\Sounds (replace the 22mb INT folder with this 195mb one)

(by this step you can play the game with eng menus/subtitles in game and SOME english voices. If you take the step 7 you will have all the voices also in game..)

7) FINALLY download these files from:
