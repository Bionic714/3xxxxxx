Thanks for the new eps! :))"

,jflob2,2007-11-16T08:05Z,"Fantastic! This is just part 1 of 2 for season 10, right? (there are 22 episodes in season 10).

Humours, you're moto21, from Demonoid (RIP) right?  Thanks so much for this. I'm still connected to a few people who were trying to finish your Demonoid torrents--hoping I can help get them completed. (If you re-post them here, I'll help seed.)

You Rock!!!

,goldminer,2007-11-16T15:32Z,"Yes, Thank You for sharing! And, please repost other SEASons. Seeds have died...You are the GREATEST!"
,moirainesedai,2007-11-24T20:45Z,"Hey there. I enjoyed the torrents on Demonoid, but couldn't manage to become a member as I only discovered them a couple of weeks before they dissolved.

I'm seeding this torrent, and will continue until at least 4:1.

I'd like to see more seasons if you have them. Thanks

(nothing says ""thank you"" like seeding)"
,zillionnn,2007-11-26T20:08Z,What about the second half of season 10?
,missjenniferd,2007-11-28T10:05Z,"moto, are you still seeding this one? it shows 0 seeders and 0 leechers in my client? but here it says 1 seeder. not sure why i can't connect to 
you, if it is you that is seeding.
i just found these last 2, so if you get this 
message, please seed this one again if you can."
,missjenniferd,2007-11-28T21:21Z,thanks for the seeds!!! :P
,moirainesedai,2007-11-29T04:37Z,"I have been seeding 24-hours for the past several days, since my last comment. I'll continue for a while, but I hope desperately for other seasons."
,Saavik24,2008-12-06T09:48Z,Does anyone have the full series? I'd love to give this to a friend of mine for his birthday as a full seires.
