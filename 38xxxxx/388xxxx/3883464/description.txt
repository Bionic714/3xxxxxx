Boris Karloff's THRILLER
Season 1 Episode 37 

"The Grim Reaper"  

Legend has it that a lurid painting of the Grim Reaper is cursed, bringing a violent demise to all who have ever possessed it.

This is a particularly entertaining episode not only because of writer Robert Bloch's usual dark and droll sense of humor, but also because of the over-the-top performances from Natalie Schafer (best known as Mrs. Howell on Gilligan's Island) and William Shatner (Star Trek's Captain Kirk)
