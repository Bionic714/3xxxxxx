,egban,2007-12-03T23:51Z,Thanks for letting me know...i'll seed twice the ratio amount.
,egban,2007-12-04T04:15Z,I have slow uploads when I'm in the office cuz our ISP is crap.  My uploads increase 10-fold when I do it from home so please forgive me if my uploads seem slow 8 hours of the day.  My local time is +8.0 GMT.
