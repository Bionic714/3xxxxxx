Synopsis

Called dramatic, accurate and harrowing by the San Francisco Chronicle and nominated for the Oscar® for Best Foreign Film, DOWNFALL takes you into Hitler?s bunker during the brutal and harrowing last days of the Third Reich. Seen through the eyes of Hitler?s infamous secretary Traudl Junge, optimism crumbles into grim realization and terror as it becomes clear that Germany?s defeat is inevitable. As the Russian army circles the city, the dimly lit halls of the underground refuge become an execution chamber for the Fuhrer and his closest advisors..
