,smartypants,2007-11-12T00:42Z,maybe it's ripped from streaming. I'm waiting for the DVDRip anyway. 
,pops87pl,2007-11-12T00:44Z,1h13m
,isthisit,2007-11-12T00:48Z,"The IP of the only seeder at this point is coming from New York, New York. The video is probably from the pay per view from loose change website. The original was probably a low res FLV . Will have to wait and see."
,Scudmeister,2007-11-12T03:22Z,probably just a teaser.
,RoggleToggle,2007-11-12T04:25Z,"its legit, the quality isnt the greatest but oh well, thanks"
,Baz70,2007-11-12T06:08Z,Anyone downloaded it yet? I downloaded a version (FLV) wich was about 662Mb...problem is that it ends abruptly...so I havent gotten to see the end of it...probably someone who didnt bother to check if it was complete (file is corrupt) before uploading it :( and I dont wanna spendt time downloading another screwed up version.
,Baz70,2007-11-12T06:24Z,And mine goes to 1:15.40...then it cuts...it is pretty clear it should be longer...lol..Avery is cut off (movie ends) just as he is continuing the with the build up of evidence...so if THIS one is only 1:13 long....I think you can figure the rest for yourself ;) 
,pelgrim108,2007-11-12T06:53Z,"I've only seen the first 75 minutes of the film (same problem as baz70), but the film is great!!
The boys did a superjob.
Also they treated the Saudi patsies as patsies for a change."
,pelgrim108,2007-11-12T06:58Z,"Can somebody make a English torrent out of this torrent? (Just trow out the dutch subtitles and make English descriptions instead of the Dutch ones.)
