Santana [originally the Santana Blues Band] is a flexible number of musicians accompanying Carlos Santana since the late 1960s. Just like Santana himself, the band is known one which helped to make Latin rock famous in the rest of the world. The band was formed in 1970 in San Francisco. The first members were Tom Frazier [guitar], Mike Carabello [percussion], Rod Harper [drums], Gus Rodriguez [bass] and Gregg Rolie [keyboard, vocal]. In the following years [and decades] the members of the group changed frequently for a number of reasons, and from 1971 to 1972 there was a brief separation between the group and Santana. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Mike Carrabello, Gregg Rolie and Michael Shrieve being honoured.
