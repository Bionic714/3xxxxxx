,pokersucs,2008-03-02T17:54Z,"How to manually extend the evaluation period 
When the initial 60-day evaluation period nears its end, you can run the Slmgr.vbs script to reset the evaluation period. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Click Start, and then click Command Prompt. 
2. Type slmgr.vbs -dli, and then press ENTER to check the current status of your evaluation period. 
3. To reset the evaluation period, type slmgr.vbs ?rearm, and then press ENTER. 
4. Restart the computer.
This resets the evaluation period to 60 days."
,pokersucs,2008-03-05T07:28Z,"You can also do this to reset to 60 days. 

Go to your system 32 folder and find your ""slmgr"" script file.  Send a shortcut to desktop or wherever.  Right click on slmgr shortcut>properties and in the target window add -rearm so it should look like this.
"" C:\Windows\System32\slmgr.vbs -rearm "" click ok and your set.  Just double click on your slmgr shortcut and you reset your computer to 60 days then restart your computer.  "
,pokersucs,2008-03-06T05:34Z,"How to automate the extension of the evaluation period
You may want to set up a process that automatically resets the evaluation period every 60 days. One way to automate this process is by using the Task Scheduler. You can configure the Task Scheduler to run the Slmgr.vbs script and to restart the server at a particular time. To do this, follow these steps: 1.	Click Start, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Task Scheduler.
2.	Copy the following sample task to the server, and then save it as an .xml file. For example, you can save the file as Extend.xml.
