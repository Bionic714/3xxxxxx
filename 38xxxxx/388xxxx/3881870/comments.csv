,Gorgoda,2007-11-10T20:42Z,"""evil uploader"" muahaha...
That must be me? 
uMpapa, sorry, but I'm old enought to remember what was happening with keygens 8 or 10 years ago. When every single antivirus software detected them as virus.

Okay, If you, people, too afraid to use my keygen - feel free to search web for another one.

Cheers."
,Gorgoda,2007-11-10T20:55Z,"P.S. Anyway, if don't trust, or don't want to run the possibly infected keygen, please run it in VM as uMpapa recommended. But don't blame me for seeding, because the keygen isn't mine, I just found it and attached so you get all-in-one.

Cheers."
,Gorgoda,2007-11-10T20:59Z,">...as it is still ill advice to run a strange keygen on >a computer.

Agree. My advice was not correct.
But that's some kind of a price for using warez.
Russian rulette ;) 

Cheers."
,krypz,2007-11-11T05:25Z,"thx for the up and for seeding

as for the other---either we know the risks or they're noobs........."
,Kidnice,2007-11-11T20:09Z,Hey Gorgoda thanks I got it in the first try haha thanks Very easy 
,skv70_7,2007-11-22T05:06Z,Only does this once or twice....can someone help me out. Can't register...keeps saying 'invaild serial number' on the screen with the installation code. Help? :)
,WorldWthoutMoney,2007-11-23T22:50Z,"there is NO ""registration by phone"" option 100% infected and useless keygen. see for urself do not be stupid think..."
,Gorgoda,2007-11-24T14:39Z,"Guys, if you're too dumb to use a simple keygen - that's not my problem, really... :)"
,Gorgoda,2007-11-24T14:40Z,"> skv70_7

I dunno, worked perfectly."
,KabelKrull,2007-11-29T10:16Z,"NOD 32 doesn't report any virus. Install and and run program. Click Purchase Product, Then By Phone and use the Keygen. That worked for me. Thanx a lot to Gorgoda"
,draagun,2007-12-01T14:54Z,"This torrent works great - some keygens send off false positives as a virus - this is one of those keygens.  also, make sure you poke around plenty and you will figure out how to use the keygen - coming here and saying it doesn't work just cause you don't know how to use it doesn't help anyone.  Thank you Gorgoda for uploading this great program!  The keygen is a little confusing but does work once you figure it out. They use different terminology for the serial number than the program uses."
,PyroPeanut,2007-12-06T21:11Z,"Worked Awesome!  For those who couldn't figure out the keygen, here are some simple instructions :P
Start the program, when asked if you want to continue evaluation, purchase or register.. chose purchase.. then chose register by phone.  Once you are on this page open the keygen and hit the ""Key Code"" button.  Then cut and paste your installation code from the purchase page into the key gen and hit the Generate Button.  Once you do that.. the purchase page is asking for the Serial Number and the Activation Code.  The serial number is the first line of the keygen .. the activation code is the last one.  stick those in and you are done.  Hope that helps those who couldn't figure it out :P"
,Gorgoda,2007-12-07T22:33Z,"PyroPeanut, thanks man!
I was too exhausted to write it myself )) "
,skv70_7,2007-12-08T05:35Z,"Well thanks to those will helpful/ useful comments. I have used a few keygens, but have all worked differently. So excuse me for hoping for a little extra help."
,madwantnone,2007-12-09T17:22Z,"Okay, so call me an idiot but what do you open this with? I've tried reading guides and such but none seem to help. It says it's a Limewire file, so I try using it there but still nothing happens. Please help?"
,madwantnone,2007-12-09T17:56Z,"Nevermind, I got it. Silly Avast. ;)"
,TriangleMan,2007-12-22T22:43Z,"awesome, i've been wanting this for a while. neone no what version it is?"
,secretfangirl,2008-01-04T05:14Z,"madwantnone, how did you make it work? i'm guessing mine not working has to do with avast antivirus. should i disable it?"
,secretfangirl,2008-01-04T05:55Z,"nvm, i got it =)
thanks =)"
,carlusdarienus,2008-01-17T10:27Z,"I just want to thank Gorgoda for Sharing Corel Painter and I just want to tell the cunts that post rude comments about you, you are all ignorants read this!!!
Sometimes Anti Virus detects something that is what they think is a Virus for example Nero burning software some anti virus detects Nero has a Virus even the original software but when you go into their website it says you just need to update your anti virus program my point is anti virus sometimes detects something that is not really harmful into your computer.  "
,23creative,2008-01-19T12:53Z,"worked fine for me no virus or anything
i followed PyroPeanut's guide on this page (well done my son) and works perfectly.. great torrent!"
,FuckThatShit,2008-01-24T21:21Z,"Okay nice you to share this, BUT my F-secure (version 7) founded a virus called Win32.Trojan.Agent  [more of it here: http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/win32_trojan_agent.shtml]. The threat level was 10/10 so maximum.

,FuckThatShit,2008-01-25T11:54Z,Anyway I dared to run the keygen too and it didn't seem to affect my computer (at least so far). So it might be the usual antivirus-warnings 'cos antiviruses use to warning about keygen or cracks many times but be ware and don't trust everything.. so thanks for this :)
,FuckThatShit,2008-01-25T11:59Z,"BUT why does it keep saying ""Invalid serial number"". I made the keycode, copied the installion code and pressed Generate but it won't accept my Activation code.."
,FuckThatShit,2008-01-25T12:02Z,"Aaah my bad, too tired maybe :S yeah it works like perfectly. Thanks again."
,Cirbirus,2008-01-25T20:17Z,"It should be noted that WebSweeper also found a trojan in the keygen and this is a TRIAL version of the software!  NOT RETAIL!

I would suggest you avoid this like and just download it yourself from Corel then find a non-trojan keygen.  Just because it's not doing anything right now doesn't mean it won't do somehting on February 14th.  Anyone that runs something that gets a warning like that is a fool."
,FuckThatShit,2008-01-26T12:20Z,"Just because it's not doing anything right now doesn't mean it won't do somehting on February 14th. Anyone that runs something that gets a warning like that is a fool. // 

That's true. Though I myself checked this with F-secure. It said infected, then I checked with Online Malware scan and Virustotal scan and both said trojans inside.. well anyway then I downloaded the Sandbox prog, which is ultra handy tool for checking is there any fuc*ers inside. Is said nothing to worry about so I continued and ran the keygen. Anyway it's hard to tell for sure is there anything real shit inside or is it the real deal. Scene releases are of course different, 'cos there's checksums and stuff inside and packed with rar's so it can be checked it's the correct size etc.."
,Insane3,2008-02-07T02:11Z,"corel painter x?
or just a keygen?"
,segunitb1,2008-03-04T18:21Z,Worked great for me.  Many thanks
,Lolitium,2008-03-10T03:28Z,"Yeah keygen turned up with a ""trojan"" but not only did the keygen come up with a virus but so did Painter X's .exe. 

I scanned with Norton 2K7 before unzipping and Norton found 5 trojans, Norton blocked all 5."

,shlonsky,2008-04-01T21:59Z,"hello :)
gr8 to have a corel x + keygen on tpb!

but it's too bad the whole package is zipped, not allowing one to download only the keygen.

i have downloaded the trial from cor*l, since then i'm busting my ass trying to find a clean keygen, but not to avail... and am not hot on downloading 100MB once again only for a couple of KBs... quid?

,edleen,2008-04-19T19:20Z,"Is it just me or does that Keygen not work at all.

1. I start up the program after installation
2. Select activation

4. Next window I copy the installation code
5. Then copy and paste the activation code

But nothing ever happens, all I get is an error.. Why is this?"

,blackstorm1,2008-04-22T21:05Z,"@PyroPeanut: thank you very much, mate! your instructions on using  the keygen worked like a charm! 

Everyone this is the RIGHT procedure:

""...For those who couldn't figure out the keygen, here are some simple instructions :P
Start the program, when asked if you want to continue evaluation, purchase or register.. chose purchase.. then chose register by phone. Once you are on this page open the keygen and hit the ""Key Code"" button. Then cut and paste your installation code from the purchase page into the key gen and hit the Generate Button.

Oh and there is no virus. Look it up... Keygens are recognized as trojans (not trojan horses genious). Why? Because anti-viruses and anti-spyware programs just look for something that's bad. According to companies and the government, keygens are bad lol. Dur... Just like McAfee is spyware in my book."
