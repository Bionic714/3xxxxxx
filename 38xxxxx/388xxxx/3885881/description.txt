 Egypt and Ethiopia. Episode 3. 
 After trying to sleep through a sandstorm, the team have lost their 
 enthusiasm. Riding with zero visibility, it s unsafe for them to 
 continue- but it's even more dangerous for them to camp on the roadside. 
 Finally arriving safely in Egypt, the team are reunited with the 
 Americans. Catching the Aswan ferry, they cross the border into Sudan 
 and into sweltering heat. Eventually making it to the UNICEF project in 
 Ethiopia, Charley and Ewan are starting to love Africa- before Ewan has 
 a fall.
