Since you apparently feel the need to be a smart ass, note that i have written nfo, as in an abbreviation of information, in opposition to an nfo-file. To my knowledge can information be represented in any form, where a plain text file with the extension .txt compared to .nfo will make the 85% of all users who would be trying to open the file in MS System Information tool able to actually read it.

I don't feel the need to be evul 3l33t h4xX0r; i just want my fuckin' info to be read.

And as you claim to know this shit better than me, how can 7-bit ASCII text not ""be a nfo"" just because the extension on the filename is different? Or is there some magick juu-juu in that particular extension?

Don't open your mouth unless you have something to say worth listening too ...

1) Get a flashcard. I buy mine from shop 01media. (Google for ""shop 01media"".)
2) Transfer roms.
3) Enjoy.

Well said. NDS gamepaks are intended for a wider audience than regular warez releases and a bit of leeway should be permissible. The internet tends to work by flexible rules, but eats laws for breakfast.
Thanks for this release on behalf of myself, my kid and half the parents in my street."
