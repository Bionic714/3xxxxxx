,professorfuntime,2007-11-11T22:47Z,"I'll save you the trouble of DL this. the truth about hiphop is that it's shit, plan and simple. Not music, not lifestyle, just shit. Packaged and marketed to suburban white kids so they can feel they're gangster. I'm surprised that it hasn't fizzled out yet, sorta like disco."

,robinhood1984,2007-12-01T23:37Z,Very interesting despite the fact that the good reverend has gotten a few facts about some of these songs wrong and his lack of understanding hip-hop culture.

,gateway2heaven,2010-05-07T20:48Z,"I did not see part 4 here.  But I will upload part 5 soon!  Believe it or not, there is a part V that's been released, but you have to check out the website. :)"
,gateway2heaven,2011-04-18T17:02Z,"pegel05:  I noticed that Part 2 (Exodus into Egypt) did not seem to be the complete video.  I also noticed that there was no Part 4 (Curse of our Culture) anywhere in this torrent.  Do us a favor.  Please make sure you have everything in Part 2, make sure you also have Part 4.

For everyone else:  I already have Part 5 (V) and Part 6 (Detained for Entry), both available in MP4 high quality.  :)  God bless."
