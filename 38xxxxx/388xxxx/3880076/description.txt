Overview: Towards the end of the Tang dynasty, the Emperor's rule is waning and corruption is rife, and many groups are formed in society to challenge the authorities. Out of all the groups, the most powerful is The House Of Flying Daggers. The government decides to send Feng Tian County's top captains Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) to capture the new leader within 10 days. 
Leo suspects that Mei (Zhang Ziyi), the beautiful new dancer at the Peony Pavilion, is the daughter of the old leader, and Leo decides to send Jin disguised as a warrior called Wind to rescue Mei, and to ensnare her trust so she'll lead them to the secret headquarters of The House Of Flying Daggers.
