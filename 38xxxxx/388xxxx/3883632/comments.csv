,jefi99,2007-11-13T00:35Z,"she is really nice, but according to www.model149.com it seems that it's a ""one only"" :-("
,twatley,2007-11-15T00:18Z,she's gorgeous!
,dafnousaki,2007-11-15T12:43Z,is she good?
,xhizors,2007-11-16T02:27Z,eh. didn't even bother really watching it.
,upx,2007-11-16T06:01Z,"Thanks for the upload. 
Even though she's cute, she's not as great as the comments here. Also, the handheld POV camera work is jerky and not framed well and the low bitrate encode means lots of tiling during the ""action"" scenes.
FYI: 25m15s, 320x240"
,Kinthesky,2007-11-21T02:36Z,What does POV actually stand for?
,TreyPowder,2007-11-21T08:51Z,Point Of View
,x000x,2007-11-21T19:33Z,i always thought its the Planet Of Violence ;o)
,divakumar,2007-11-24T08:15Z,Not too bad !
,badlands,2007-11-25T14:12Z,"Well, a skinny girl gets fucked by a Russian photographer who really wants to be American: at least it seems so juding from all his humming and use of American vocabulary in his consistent ""Yeah"", which - together with his humming - pretty much covers this one from start to finish. To add to his international flavour he also play some gangsta rap in the background, something that was popoular in 1992. Some nice footage, but man: is it really so difficult to find none-asshole-guys to do pornflicks these days? Grunting, stupidtalking/looking amateurs seem to (try and) rule the pornuniverse, without any class, feeling or sense of direction (which includes both the actor and the director). It doesn't matter how nice the girl/woman is when you have Stupidity itself fucking her."
,Ninja_McAwesome,2007-11-30T23:55Z,maybe you should turn the sound down and stop trying to rub one out to the noises that the guy makes
,hagman2,2007-12-02T02:50Z,I totally agree with you badlands! I cant see why there are so much wack porn!? (And so little good)
,hagman2,2007-12-02T03:28Z,"...Nope. I dont agree. Not this one. This is a very realistic one. The rap music is cellphone ringing in the background and the song is from last year, not -92... And he doesn't take her in the ass ;-)"
,MasterBate,2008-03-18T17:29Z,"To each his own, but to clear things up;

1) Badlands were refering to the popularity of the rap-style, not the year it was made!

2) Anal is popular in Russia

3) The amount of crappy home-made porn is only a phenomenon in the free porn-world. The pay-sites and DVD's has a lot better quality, but you'll have to pay for it.

When everybody want it for free, no-one buys the DVD's or pay the admission for the sites, wich results in an overflow of home-made porn on sites, such as this.
When it comes to regular movies, a lot more people buy a copy of each movie and that's why there's more high-quality movies, than there is high-quality porn!

Hope I've covered it all ^^"
