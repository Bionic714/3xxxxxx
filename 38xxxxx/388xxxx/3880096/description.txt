Overview: The rebels of the Red Flower Society fight back in this spectacular conclusion to BOOK AND SWORD! 
After forming an uneasy alliance with the Ching Emperor, Red Flower Chief Chan (Vincent Zhao from THE BLADE and ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA 4 and 5) is sent into exile when the Empress Dowager wants him dead. He befriends a group of Nomads who join forces with him in a daring attempt to strike back at the Capital.
