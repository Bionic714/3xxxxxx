,tavisjohn,2007-11-11T06:01Z,".MKV is a container file.  You can just renam it to AVI and play it in nearly any media player.

And read the WIKI link about H264, it is an MP4 codec."
,ghjsfffgfdgfg,2007-11-13T23:50Z,Why call it S6E07 when it is S5E20 on all other torrents?
,mr.elbart,2007-11-14T23:31Z,"It's call S06E07 because that is what it is. Actually it would be more correct just to call it episode 89. That is the original discovery channel numbering. If you feel that you cant live without the season info, visit the official mythbuster wiki which have an episode guide, ordered by season! http://mythbusters-wiki.discovery.com/"
