All the ""BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS"" & ""DOWNLOAD YOUR aXXo FILES FROM aXXo ACCOUNTS"" philosophy ...... it's all crap - axxo DOESN'T care.  Leaving TPB opens the gate for evil intent from you-know-who ..........

,Dontdothisathome,2007-11-26T09:54Z,"till: andreee69

Först måste du ladda ner undertexten. titta gärna på www.undertexter.se där finns väldigt mycket. 
När du har laddat ner undertexten, så är det bara att lägga den i samma mapp som filmen är i. Ändra sedan så att namnet på undertexten är likadan som namnet på filmen. Det spelar ingen roll vad de heter, bara det är likadant."

,seiriol1,2011-02-11T16:00Z,"@emandem it depends what your using to download it with. if its miro, its quite hard to, as you have to keep it open for a while. you should use maybe bittorrent or transmission and then it will upload or 'seed' for as long and as much as you want. decent people should seed for at least double the time they downloaded it, that way more people can download. although this movie is truly terrible."
