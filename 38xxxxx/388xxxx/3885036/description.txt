 Dwarf Fortress is a single-player fantasy game. You can control a dwarven outpost or an adventurer in a randomly generated, persistent world.

Although Dwarf Fortress is still in a work in progress, many features have already been implemented.

    * The world is randomly generated with distinct civilizations, dozens of towns, hundreds of caves and regions with various wildlife.
    * The world persists as long as you like, over many games, recording history and tracking changes.
    * Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in the mountain.
          o Craft treasures and furniture from many materials and improve these objects with precious metals, jewels and more.
          o Defend yourself against attacks from hostile civilizations, the wilderness and the depths.
          o Support the nobility as they make demands of your populace.
          o Keep your dwarves happy and read their thoughts as they work and relax.
          o Z coordinate allows you to dig out fortresses with multiple levels. Build towers or conquer the depths.
          o Build floodgates to divert water for farming or to drown your adversaries.
          o Much much more...
    * Play an adventurer and explore, quest for glory or seek vengeance.
          o Meet adversaries from previous games.
          o Recruit people in towns to come with you on your journey.

          o Accept quests from the town and civilization leaders.
          o Retire and meet your old characters. Bring them along on an adventure with a new character or reactivate them and play directly.
          o Z coordinate allows you to move seamlessly between dungeon levels and scale pyramids fighting adversaries above and below.
    * The combat model uses skills, body parts, wrestling, charging and dodging between squares, bleeding, pain, nausea, and much more.
