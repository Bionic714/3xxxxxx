                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revolution and its sizzling Economic Revolution. But you haven't heard about 
its other great social upheaval - the Chinese Sexual Revolution - and like 
everything in that country it's happening at warp speed.

It's China's version of the 60s revolution - on steroids.

CHINA'S SEXUAL REVOLUTION is the world's first glimpse - often using secret 
cameras - into this forbidden new China. It's a surprising portrait of the 
Chinese today: the new free love generation that's left their parents in shock; 
the booming sex industry that's creating an HIV crisis; the new generation of 
career women and feminists that suddenly wants it all - while millions of men 
feel left out.

This long untold story goes back to the days of Chairman Mao, who made 
sexuality a great taboo. He ordered everyone to wear unisexual Mao suits, and 
forbid women from wearing sexy clothing, getting stylish haircuts, or even 
wearing make-up. Men and women were expected to be comrades - not lovers - 
though Mao himself enjoyed an emperor's sex life, seeking virgins to retain his 
"youthö.

China's sexual libido was bottled up for 50 years, but now itÆs bursting loose, 
with dramatic effects on marriage, personal freedom and the government itself.
