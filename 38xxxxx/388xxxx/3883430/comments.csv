,masterofdarkness22,2008-02-28T16:00Z,"I downloaded this torrent and put it onto disk, there are No viruses, my computer can handle most anything, its the way I built her. Anyways using a Antivirus program and spyware program is a must when downloading Anything from a torrent site. I do have one problem though. after I install the games I want and try to play then it loads the game and then simply minamizes the game to the taskbar. I try to open it in full screen but it keep crashing. After awhile I would say like 5 mins of me pressing the down on the taskbar Iam able to play it in full screen with no problems. Does anyone know why this is? I have the latest drivers. Please help as it is very frustrating! "
