Jens Wennberg - Welcome to 1984 (2007 Joyless Jack Records)

I bought this EP at cdbaby.com and it had an Kopimi logo on it, so i just had to upload a torrent :). Actually the copyright text was kind of funny it said:

If you got a friend that can't afford to buy the cd, please feel free to copy and share. If you don't know how, download an live iso from kubuntu.org and use K3b to rip the CD.
 
The torrent includes Ogg, mp3, flac and wav versions of the EP and it also lyrics.

Song list:
1. Jimmys Headache
2. Plastic Copies Of You
3. Wlecome to 1984
4. I'm a Monster
5. Tux
6. I Don't Want To Play
