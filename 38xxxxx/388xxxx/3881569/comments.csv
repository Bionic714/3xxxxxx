Kevin R. Ryan was terminated Tuesday from his job at Environmental Health Laboratories Inc., a subsidiary of Underwriters Laboratories Inc., the consumer-product safety testing giant.

Underwriters Laboratories Inc., according to Ryan, ""was the company that certified the steel components used in the construction of the WTC buildings.""

Ryan wrote that last year, while ""requesting information,"" UL's chief executive officer and fire protection business manager disagreed about key issues surrounding the collapse, ""except for one thing -- that the samples we certified met all requirements.""
