Overview of 'Fire Your Wife':


Over 50% of marriages bitterly end in divorce. The majority of divorces are initiated by women who unfailngly get favorable divorce outcomes because they prepare their defence. Fire Your Wife will help you shift the odds in your favour, and restore some equilibrium to the highly inequitable wargame of marriage dissolution.

Fire Your Wife is the book that lists specific things you can do (and things you should not do) when preparing for divorce.

    * It covers the nuts and bolts of actions you can take in months and years  
      before your divorce, as well as right before and during divorce.
    * Things to do and not to do to get a custody of your children and not lose
      your house.
    * Things to do and not to do to keep as much money as possible during and after
      divorce.
    * Things to do to minimize your future payments to your ex-wife.
    * Everything about hiding money and assets before divorce.
    * How to document your wife's illegal and unethical behavior before filing for 
      divorce.
    * How to document other things your wife does that will help you during 
      divorce.
    * Unethical and illegal things your wife and her lawyer may do during divorce, 
      including using children as hostages against you and falsely accusing you of 
      sexual or physical abuse. And what you can do to protect yourself and 
      possibly fight back.
    * Tricks your wife and her lawyer will be using during divorce to unfairly get 
      as much money from you as possible.
    * I read most of the recent divorce books for women. Fire Your Wife includes an
      overview of important advice women get. The more you know, the better you can
      plan and prepare for divorce.

Pre-divorce advice your wife is getting (exact quotes from divorce books for women)

    * Wait till he falls asleep. Rifle through his pockets.
    * Does he fall asleep after sex? Have fun -- then rifle through his pockets!
    * Go to Las Vegas or Atlantic City and tell him you lost it all -- except you 
      did not.
    * If your husband pays your credit card bills but won't share his cash, charge!
      Then return for cash refund or resell that expensive stuff to friends.
    * If you cook, serve him hamburger, not steak. Pocket the difference.
    * If a bill is for $220, round it up to a nearest hundred and enter $300.
    * "Pay" the same phone or utility bill three times each month.
    * Always carry something to remind you of your husband...like his credit card.
    * Secrets are not necessarily bad. Putting money away can be a wonderful thing 
      for a relationship.
    * The first one who gets to the bank is the one to empty the joint accounts.
    * Learn to aggravate your husband whenever possible.
    * Criticize him daily... Accuse him of having affairs (falsely)... Lend his 
      money to your relatives... Run up his credit cards... Nag, Nag, Nag...
    * Control your husband by being alternately loving and indifferent to keep him 
      in a state of continual concern.
    * His money is going to be your money anyway when he drops dead. 

Divorce advice your wife will be getting

    * Use the children as hostages against your husband.
    * Falsely accuse him of sexual or physical abuse. Just lie in court.
    * Lie and get restraining order barring him from his house.
    * Lie and get restraining order hijacking all his bank accounts.
    * Run up all his credit cards to the limit.
    * Your husband is a scumbag and he deserves all that anyway.
