,auseed4me,2008-03-09T22:05Z,Can anyone get this to work on Vista?I have Jbuilder 2005 through my school but I have it on my xp notebook.. I am trying to get this to work on my vista notebook
,user417,2008-09-12T09:53Z,"my classmate had troubles installing his on vista too, after several hours with the support tech he finally got it working, but when he compiled it stretched to 50x longer than usual, real shame."
,ashesbonex,2008-11-21T22:39Z,"Please install proper vista shared files,SDK kit from microsoft, it's too shame to Microsoft trying to stopped the development of Jbuilder, Try install first some JDK and SDK update from java(sun) first, most important thing try also get some component from Ms J#. This will work I've tried it with all Jbuilbers X,2005 and 2007.

So please Experiment!!!!!!"
