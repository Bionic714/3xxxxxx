@qazwsxijn:  It's a left over from the days of 56ks and usenet/irc?  I agree, I'd prefer to have an avi file over a rar...but this is free.  And He0n released it blindingly fast--so we really don't have a right to complain.

Anyways, I just finished download it...now time to watch it!  I'll seed to 125%-200%."

,qazwsxijn,2007-11-13T05:46Z,"Yes, but the original file was an avi. Why not just upload that instead of spending time compressing it (with minimal results, since the avi is already compressed video), and then forcing everyone to unrar it when it finished (which takes a hell of a lot longer than downloading a few extra megabytes)?

As for 56k'ers, first of all they shouldn't even be touching files so large, and second of all, thats old technology. Should not have to accommodate them."

,Panipal2005,2007-11-13T06:31Z,"

I think he's trying to say it took him an ungodly amount of time to RAR an avi file that he already had, to which the obvious question would be, WHY DO THAT THEN INSTEAD OF UPLOADING THE ORIGINAL AVI FILE YOU HAD.

One more piece of evidence why people who upload rar files when they could even more easily upload avi files are complete and utter dicks.

Hey Heon, maybe you've noticed the comment about how rar files are the preferred solution of people who only have dial-up.  Maybes that should make you think, 'get with the times or GTFO',"

,DeltaPan,2007-11-13T14:44Z,"Indeed himod!

@qazwsxijn and others asking about Rar'ing.
Another reason is to do with the math in packet and piece transfer in the swarm, the whole file is broken down into smaller chunks prior to being hashed.

This creates more packets to be distributed and actually speeds up the swarm on cascade.

If none of you don't like Rar'd releases then i suggest you bloody well wait until somebody uploads an unrar'd version, as it is you have been severely rude about this uploader and i for one think you are ungrateful oiks who have little understanding about how Bit Torrent file transfer works and do not appreciate the scene and what they do for you.

Which is get these shows out to you first which are great quality and doesn't leave you guessing if some noob has capped and screwed things up etc!

Accept that this is the way the uploader has done this and just stfu, download the show and enjoy it.

There is no darn password! **Rolls eyes!**

Right click on a rar file and select ""Extract to"", when dialogue comes up you can select your Desktop or elsewhere.

Or you can select ""Extract here"" from the right click menu but cut and paste out to somewhere else as sometimes this can make client read extra data and fail the hashcheck for the torrent."
,Drowlord,2007-11-13T18:16Z,"DeltaPan, rar torrents are retarded.  This has nothing to do with torrent protocols, packet sizes, or transmission efficiency, and I've never seen anyone try to argue those points.  It's a simple matter of practicality.

For a torrent like this, which is a couple-day-old episode of an uber-popular TV show and a smallish file, the problems with RAR aren't quite as obvious.  We have thousands of people in the swarm.

It's a lot more obvious when you're dealing with less popular torrents.  People don't seed RAR files for very long, because it requires them to store the information twice -- once in the RAR file, and once in a usable format.

There's nothing worse than downloading an 18 GB torrent that stores ""the entire series"" of some obscure TV show and has 1 seeder.  In all likelihood, I won't get the entire torrent, and because it's RAR, I'm virtually guaranteed not to get a single episode.  Worse yet, I'm at a moral conundrum if I successfully download it.  I now have to decide whether I am willing to expend 18 GB of disk space to save the series (answer: yes) and ANOTHER 18 GB of disk space to help seed it for other people (answer:  uh... crap!).

At 2.5 TB of media, I have hundreds of torrents that are usable as-is and stay in my queue for months, sometimes seeding to ratios of 40 or 50. I try to respect the uploaders and always go to 100%, but RAR torrents don't get more than that from me.  I hate doubling my disk usage because some weenie had a retarded moment.  Casual observation suggests that a tiny percentage of downloaders are willing to contribute to a RAR torrent at all, resulting in soon-dead torrents... with any partial downloads rendered utterly useless.

I have the same gripe about ISOs, NRGs, DAAs, BINs, and other disk image files.  The reality is that unusable file formats repel seeders.  I'm sure that there are lots of people with faster internet connections than mine, but with a 15Mbs down / 5Mbs up fiber optic connection and 24/7 seeding, it's at least a small loss to the torrent community when I am not willing to seed a torrent that I consider valuable."

,DeltaPan,2007-11-13T19:00Z,"@Drowlord

Just because you've not seen anybody else mention it doesn't mean this isn't correct.

Before you presume to tell me i am wrong, try researching about BT FTP and the way mathematics comes into packet distribution within the swarms.

You'd find i am correct!

This is why all scene releases conform to either 15 or 50Mb etc, because it involves the packet mathematics in Bit Torrent protocol hashing. 

You are just whinging about disk space and don't really know what you are talking about."

Rar Files do help with torrent distribution because of packet swarming even tho its a chaw unpacking them it helps the superseeder distribute quicker."
,Lars_Praetorian,2007-11-14T20:00Z,Smitty - download WinRar and then open/extract all your .rar files with it.
,Drowlord,2007-11-14T22:23Z,"@DeltaPan
Either you're unable to read or just being pig headed.  Nobody has ever argued that RAR sucks for reasons of network efficiency.  You're arguing against a point that you must have hallucinated -- nobody ever made a counter-claim.  I am inclined to assume that you're right about your bandwidth utilization claims.

(Although I suspect that you're talking about an inefficiency that's in the single- digit percentages, and trying to make it sound significant... which I'm sure it's not.)

Let me summarize the conversation thus far:

RomanXXII: I prefer AVI files, but I'll download this.

Deltapan: Billions of RAR files are far more efficient for network packets under the BT protocol.  You obviously know nothing about protocols.

Drowlord: Protocol efficiency has nothing to do with why RAR sucks.  RAR files are inconvenient and people don't seed RAR torrents for long.  RAR sucks primarily because it doubles the storage requirement to seed a file.

Deltapan: Disk space has nothing to do with network efficiency, and you obviously don't know anything about mathematics or packets or protocols, because you're disagreeing with me.

Drowlord:  I agree that disk space is unrelated to packet efficiency.  I also agree that packet efficiency has NOTHING TO DO with the issue of RAR files sucking."

,unicynic,2007-12-24T22:11Z,"I am a little bit confused about all these comments. So what it's RARed? Did you pay He0n for it that you complain? Who cares what format you prefer? Does He0n gets brownie points the more people download that now it's a popularity thing what format he puts? Come on, whatever he fancies, it's his torrent!
As for those who think that it should be AVI instead of RAR, please do the community a service: unRAR it yourself and upload it. That would be more constructive than complaining.
As for me, I'd take it any format it comes in - RAR, AVI, MOV, MPG, ISO, whatever - and in any codec even. There's always Google or Yahoo to find a solution.
One question to those stupid noobs who dares asks the stupid questions: if you've never heard about RAR, VLC, or how to use Google to find out about those, how did you manage to learn about torrents? Learnt to run before you crawl?"
