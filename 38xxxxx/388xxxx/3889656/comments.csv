However, I soon would come to realize how true art this album is. It really feels like Emmy put her heart into it and you can definitely tell it comes from deep into her mind. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it. It really makes you feel happy and positive. My favorite song would have to be The Great Divide. It's an amazing song. Buy the album!"
