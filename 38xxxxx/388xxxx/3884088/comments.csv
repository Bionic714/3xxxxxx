,landardini,2008-03-08T03:07Z,"hey guys this really works, is not a virus, it has 2 cracks, I used 2nd one, it works perfect, just move the patcher to the same folder where you have mirc.exe, open the patcher, click on patch now, and then just open the keygen, get a keygen, and then enter that on mirc, seriously works guys, thnks a lot soarkaios for this!!!"
