(see folks? thats dedication!)"
,Stokeman,2007-11-11T05:15Z,"I don't know what the heck the deal is, but I have uploaded over 2 gigs of this torrent and it still shows no seeders and no leechers. The details show I have 5 total connections. I tried downloading some torrents from here, but they would not start. I really don't know what the deal is. I don't know if I am going to like this too much.

Well, anyway, Stokeman Out!"
,egggge,2007-11-11T08:01Z,Thank you Stokeman!!! Your uploads have been long appreciated. I actually visited this site (for the first time) with the hope that I'd find your weekly upload. I hope this works... Thanks again!
,Stokeman,2007-11-11T15:18Z,"Please write a comment and let me know if any of you are getting this torrent! Thanks, later!"
,tay94,2007-11-11T17:55Z,Stokeman the torrent is working fine for me. Thanks for the upload!
,uzforce,2007-11-12T01:45Z,"Hey Stokeman...

I am so happy I found you.  Thank you so much! I thought I was going to have to go through c2c withdrawal there for a while.

I've been able to download the torrent just fine and according to uTorrent there are quite a few seeders. I think the statistics on this page are either lagging behind or are just messed up for some reason.

Thanks again for your dedication in bringing us this fine show... "
,Zeerover,2007-11-12T03:34Z,"Boy, that was a close one. Don't know what I'd do without your ups. Thanks again Stokeman!  "
,studio11,2007-11-12T05:01Z,"Hey Thanks Stokers!

I thought the honeymoon was over when the demon was taken down. You must be one of the most sought after people online at the moment.. I should know found you via a google search... lol. I hope that makes you feel special! :D

Regards,
studio11"
,egggge,2007-11-12T05:21Z,The torrent worked fine for me. I have already seeded 3x what I downloaded and will continue to seed. Thanks again! Your uploads are highly appreciated.
,Stokeman,2007-11-12T23:30Z,"Thank you all for seeding and sharing these torrents! I, as well as many others, greatly appreciate it! I just can't believe how many different torrent sites have these torrents. Great job all!  Later!"
,studio11,2007-11-13T03:16Z,"Yeah Mate, 

Your Torrents feed down to ALL the other sites after a week or so. You ARE the Art Bell of the torrent world my friend! ... if you are indeed the same Stokeman from Demoniod! LoL.. now there's a conspiracy in the making..."
,vertigo2040,2007-11-14T00:20Z,Hey Stokeman...Thank You Very Much :)
,runcdfirst,2007-11-14T15:21Z,"thx a lot stokeman, your uploads are highly appreciated"
,bbabe,2007-11-17T03:27Z,"I don't think the seeder/leecher counts on this page are accurate - just ignore those.  There are plenty more people seeding than what is being displayed

Again, thank you for finding a new home for these shows - much appreciated!"
,jimcp,2007-12-02T10:57Z,"My days were no longer the same. Found you, at last. Stokeman you are some friend!, Thank you very, very much! And you know why! "
