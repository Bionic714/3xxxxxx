,TheWalkingDead,2009-06-18T21:34Z,"I just created a way bigger Linkin Park discography torrent. It's on 2,8 GB!!!! Not kidding... the only thing I think is missing on that one is Splitting The DNA (because most of them are Grey Daze and HT EP that are included in the torrent already) as well as Live at SoHo (iTunes Exclusive) EP. The last one is bought on iTunes and is protected. Don't think it'll work on other computers.
