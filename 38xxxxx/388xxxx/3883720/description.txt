 Introducing The All-New GPX-SX Bendix Line, which includes five great Bendix King GPS units -- two being brand new while three others have been completely re-designed, -- all using the latest XML programming techniques making them fully functional in FSX and maintaining backwards compatibility with FS2004 while keeping the gauges extremely Frame Rate Friendly!

Additional features have been implemented as well, making the product more functional and realistic when compared to their real world counterparts. While still considered a "Gaming Product" these units will look, feel and respond well within the sim. In addition, there is almost unlimited configuration possibilities, meaning that you can install your units in any manner you like. Choose either a Full Bendix Stack or simply Mix-And-Match any gauges in the Series X product line, giving you even more possible configurations to add to your FS2004/FSX aircrafts.

 Service Release 2 - NOW WITH TCAS Added to the KMD550.

A Bonus Pack is also included, offering even more gauges such as replacement Bendix VOR Heads to add extra value to this package!
