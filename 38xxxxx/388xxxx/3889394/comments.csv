,rambis34,2007-12-02T07:32Z,Can you use this on Vista?
,Jesper145,2008-01-08T04:40Z,"Why can`t anyone just upload the hole Game, insted of all the extra thing`s you have to download first. 
Should we just go to Google and seach for Final Fantasy VII XP and then it will come or ?"

,mastadfosho,2008-01-20T18:37Z,"You will prolly never see this but jesper... your a fuckin noob.  A leach of a noob at that, i hope a group of trackers come up to you and slap you in the face until you cry.  People who put these up should expect some level of knowledge out of you, i mean, its not that hard you idiot.  You download a patch... then your done.  Its not like undie or whatever hoster it is gets paid to do this... so stfu."
,kri123,2008-03-13T18:11Z,"mastadfosho, i bet you're a pale acne-geek sitting day in and day out in front of your computer. people like that usually have attitudes like you... you may correct me if im wrong.. anyway, son of a bitch, show some respect! i feel sorry for you, really..... "
,shyster002420,2008-04-16T05:30Z,"Yes I agree...

mastadfosho, you are a fucking tool. You and your type act as if everyone who doesn't know quite as much as you are fucking idiots.

Try this on for size: We are all here to help each other. That's the point of this site; we are here to offer help and files to each other. If you feel you have to insult others, then get the fuck off of this site, mastadfosho."
,Junk188,2008-04-18T19:17Z,"A little help please.....when i load the game i can't get passed the 'new game/continue' screen, cursor won't move???"
,ace8707,2008-04-19T06:09Z,"I downloaded and installed it, but now when I get to the start up screen where it asks if I want to continue or start a new game I cant move the cursor. Any ideas? I'd really appreciate the help"
,The_Masked_Assasin,2008-05-15T08:10Z,"2 on the numpad moved the cursor for me.
What I'm wondering is how you actually select something. I keep pressing enter and it doesn't work.

I'm on Vista, by the way. Do I need patches?"
