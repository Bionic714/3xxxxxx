stuck at 99.4 % though..
not perfect, but good quality."
,Turbomaniac_7,2008-01-13T06:19Z,This was specifically trans coded for the iPod 320x240 screen so..... On my own iPod Classic 80 GB they plays perfectly.
,Hazzardmatt,2008-01-22T01:36Z,Don't download!!! Quality is good for ipod but the transcoding process resulted in a slight speed increase that is barely noticeable but still rather annoying. I wasn't sure but then I compared with a dvd and it is definitely out of sync. Hence the voices pitch and rythm is faster than normal. Might want to try this one again turbomaniac_7. Great idea though
,puneit,2008-02-25T14:37Z,Thanks for this one!!!

I like the way you havn't ""rar'ed"" the file, because my download limit is 20GB or something, so I can just choose the episodes I want, when I want, and eventually have the full collection :). 

Thanks Again. :D :D :D "
