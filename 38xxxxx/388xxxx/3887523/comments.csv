Uploader needs to upload a new version.

Nero is not good at removing protections and will either not burn part of the needed data or burn a poor image of it.  Use Alcohol 120% or CDClone in making a ""perfect image"" instead."
,Cacachoo,2007-12-02T21:20Z,My bad.  Works fine.  Burn images with something other than Nero.  I used Alcohol 120% and it worked perfect.

Then, I used nero (latest version) and burn each image to a new NRG files:
Alphabet; Sounds; Pronunciation
Greetings; introductions; jobs
Shopping & asking questions; colors
Telephone numbers; Age; Time.hours
are OK (Audio-CDs)
But the others don't work (data CDs)"

Anyone has managed to open the data CDs; ie: Jquicktrans?"
