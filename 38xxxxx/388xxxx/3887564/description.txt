The MOST WANTED tiny (only  800kb) uninstall application from PC Magazine. 
>>>>Take it, its yours!!!! 

This issue's utility, UnClean 2, replaces the uninstall portion of the ARP (Add/Remove Programs) with an improved version that provides full and clear access to all available information, and does so for any of the six current Windows platforms. You can also delete an uninstall entry if you discover that it's no longer valid. And of course, you can remove, change, or repair programs in the same way that you can with ARP.
