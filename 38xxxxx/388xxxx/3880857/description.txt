I bought this 2 CD set just to get the Hybrid remix of Kiss for the Dying.  That song is excellent and the rest of the CD is darn good as well. If you like nu breaks, house, or electro you will probably enjoy this.  

Ripped with EAC and encoded with FLAC for your lossless audio listening pleasure.  


Amazon's take:

Globally renowned superstar DJ, Dave Seaman, teams up with his own illustrious Audio Therapy label to deliver a mix full of exclusive new material.

This Is Audiotherapy features tracks from Infusion, Hybrid, Kosmas Epsilon, Phil K & Habersham and Dave√¢??s Group Therapy project. CD2 is unmixed and features full length versions of some of the highlights on CD1 together with exclusive mixes from Tonedepth & Stel, Oliver Moldan and Steve Porter.

Dave has remixed tracks by artists like Garbage, Placebo and Alanis Morisette. His mixing projects have appeared on multiple volumes in the Global Underground, Renaissance, and Mixmag Live! series. This 2xCD set will undoubtedly establish Audio Therapy as one of the most reputable labels in dance music and electronica.
