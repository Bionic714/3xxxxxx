,2true,2007-11-19T14:51Z,"this is not the real axxo axxo does not upload on here anymore found this on google news, Since the Piratebay staff doesn?t care for their VIP uploaders, then aXXo decided not to use TPB and he deleted his own torrents.

aXXo was constantly exposed to assaults and harassments from possible members of MPAA. Their strategy was to harass aXXo by posting absurd and accusing comments on aXXo?s torrents.

The latest assault incident was especially noticed on aXXo?s last torrent ?The Simpsons?.
Hunter1980 and aXXo were involved in direct argue with possible members from MPAA.

Unfortunately, this strategy was a success. The strategy was based on rumors and the intention was to spread rumors and all this have had a negative side effects on naive people ( downloaders ).

Since PirateBay did not take any action towards ?Organized attacks?, aXXo decided to delete his torrent on TPB. aXXo is continuing posting his torrents on mininova or other torrent sites since they care for their VIP uploaders.

,ravi000,2007-11-27T17:23Z,So what exactly is up with axxo? i have not seen any of his other new release apart from 'the bourne ultimatum' on some sites. 
,TiNVeL,2007-11-29T01:59Z,Axxo = pussy
,listigt,2007-12-09T02:22Z,"tpb have been and will be around for much longer than axxo, why would they treat any uploader different from others? Maybe they should just hand out siteadmin accounts to everyone with over 100 uploads. Hey great idea!...fucking idiots.. axxo wanted to dictate what was written about him, that's laame"
,Happy_Baker,2007-12-12T06:51Z,"=======================

,darkheart84,2007-12-15T02:36Z,As long as I can still get my movies who cares? I thought this was a place to comment on the film's quality and stuff? Thanks for the upload! 
,nightshiftc,2007-12-31T00:58Z,With the exception of the two or three people that actually commented on the film quality. The rest of you are a bunch of lames. Just let people know if it is good or not. And aXXO is probably already uploading with a new name so don't be so sure he is gone. AND he is not the only one that provides good stuff so STFU!
,TSH332,2008-01-01T18:13Z,Very good qaulity upload of an excellent film.
,muscarina,2008-01-05T17:35Z,"hi AXXo , you are the best! Thanks for the great work you do..."

,girodice,2008-04-08T02:23Z,This torrent is okay but the movie is horrible. A Mighty Fart would be more appropriate title.

,dannychris,2010-04-26T06:24Z,"A Mighty Heart is a detailed account of the search for kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter[5] Daniel Pearl in 2002.

Pearl was kidnapped in Karachi by supporters of Omar Sheikh, who claimed responsibility (and was later captured and convicted but is appealing the ruling) for kidnapping and beheading Pearl in 2002. The movie also covers efforts by Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) to track the kidnappers and bring them to justice.
