I have got one problem though, that I am unable to open or download any keygens whatsoever, even if my NOD32 is off... therefore, i am unable to install your adobe audition 3, which is a shame...
Could you please be so kind as to send me the serial number to my email address, dieterlives@hotmail.com , and please not a keygen because I cannot access that.
Many thanks!"
,keeb_daddy,2008-03-09T03:11Z,all keygens show a trojan... all keygens are recognized as trojans by virus software... so don't be alarmed that this download has a trojan... every software program I've ever downloaded that includes a keygen has shown a trojan on scan...

,Makiki77,2008-04-18T00:03Z,"Had big problems with the keygen...and AVG. So it was me vs. AVG ;p

Anywho, as some of you have seen, AVG will lock the keygen preventing you from even running it...or copying it...moving it...etc...

So what todo?

After a most frustrating time getting this great keygen (yes it works) to work after AVG locked it...I found the following:

Thanks to the gentleman who posted it...forgot which forum I found it on:

About AVG locked files, I don't know if this is what you are specifically looking for, but even if not you may find it interesting. I wrote this to explain how I get around files that AVG Locks. Note Unlocker and other programs like it will not unlock AVG locked files as they can't find any file handles.

Regain access to files locked by AVG Anti-Virus

Files designated as threats by AVG become locked preventing them from being copied, moved or launched (executed). AVG will let you delete the file. It will also ignore it if it is in a zipped file, but will pounce on it as soon as you unzip it. Files designated as a threat usually also exhibit ?Ghostly? behavior like fading in and out when selected.

AVG is infamous for ?False Positives? locking up files that that do not contain viruses or trojans. It looks for similarities and behaviors that are found in threats. Many non-threat utility programs use similar code to perform useful tasks and get caught up in AVG?s net.

Once AVG designates a file as a threat, selecting the ?Ignore? button won?t get access to your file back. Shutting down AVG won?t get access to your file back. Although I haven?t tried it I have heard that uninstalling AVG won?t get access to your file back. If that is true, the uninstaller must be leaving Registry entries and files behind, but I don?t know because I like AVG, and don?t plan to uninstall it to find out.

However if AVG locks a file you need access to, there are things you can do. 
First, if you know ahead of time you will be working with a file that will be designated as a threat when unzipped, shut down AVG before you unzip it. Do what you need to with it then zip it back up again.
Usually you find out your file is designated as a threat after it is already locked and too late. If this happens, then you will have to manually unload all AVG running files and processes.

This is how:

You will need a program from Sysinternals (Recently bought out by Microsoft) called; Autoruns for Windows v9.13. It is available here: 

Release Date: February 26, 2008
File Size: 490 KB
Operating System: Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/XP-X64/2003/Vista足 
License: Free
Web Site: technet.microsoft.com/en...ls/bb963902.aspx

Autoruns shows you what programs are configured to run during system bootup or login, and shows you the entries in the order Windows processes them. You will need to download this program first as Autoruns is what will allow you to unload the Executables and Processes that AVG leaves running even after you shut it down from the Control Center in your system tray.

Note: Autoruns doesn?t need to be installed. After unzipping, you can run it simply by double clicking on autoruns.exe, but it is a good program and would be more useful to you in the future if you copy a folder to C:\Program Files and create and place shortcuts in your start menu and maybe your Desktop.

Now do the following:

1. Right click the AVG (flag looking) icon in the system tray and launch the Control Center.

2. In the menu bar at the top, under Program, select Exit. This will shut down AVG.

3. Launch Autoruns. To make it easier to find the AVG stuff, in the menu bar at the top, under options click ?Hide Microsoft Entries?.

4. The ?Everything? tab should be selected, so look for every entry that involves AVG. This includes registry entries, executable files and process files. Each time you find one uncheck its box. I don?t know which entries actually do the locking, but unchecking them all gets it done. For the version I have currently on my computer these are the entries I uncheck.

Under: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft"

As a follow up, this all worked great...I have a fully activated copy of Audition 3 now..."
[T],vance43211,2008-04-24T15:59Z,"Hello....

Don't guys know what control, alt, delete is for? I have nod32, I hit control, alt, delete. I end the nod32kui.exe and nod32krn.exe process and I can run the keygens that nod32 usually try to delete. I make all keygen software into iso files so they can't be deleted

anti-virus maker are deleting keygen now to try to stop piracy. I had keygens that I had for years that are now viruses"
,noble713,2008-06-17T03:25Z,"Just so u all know... adobe has contacted various virus scanners to tag almost all keygens as Viruses... i Turned off norton 08(tricky, have to use msconfig) and there was certainly NO VIRUS IN THE KEYGEN.....WORKS GREAT!"
,rcguy,2008-07-03T05:15Z,"I tried several other versions using patches - no luck. My system would crash each time I ran Audition. With this version I had no problems with system crashes. The keygen would not run on any PC I had, so I booted in safemode on a second computer and the keygen worked fine in Safe Mode. The registration allows you to change the serial number so you can run the keygen even if you've already installed Audition with a different serial."
,JarAreRed,2008-07-20T19:49Z,"ok I downloaded it and the keygen works as well but i get this error when installing:

""Error 1311.Source file not found:C\Documents and Settings\Jared\Local Settings\Temp\wz64\Data1.cab. Verify that the file exist and that you can access it.""

Please help i don't know how to go about this"
,Scousewil,2008-07-21T11:20Z,"Makiki77 - Fantastic - Well done. This problem will no doubt crop up in the future with other programs so this is invaluable information. 

The Keygen is in fact a keygen and not a virus. Makiki's method is easy and works - 5 minutes max depending on how fast your computer reboots. 

Thanks to fil76 for uploading too of course."
,flamingbarney,2008-08-10T17:42Z,wheres the activation number and how do i activate it all i get is an error when i try
,g_maniac,2008-08-19T14:13Z,"OK, seeing as at least one other person is as confused as I was, and that the instructions are not in English, I'll help.
When you get to the part where it asks for activation, click on the ""Other activation options,"" then select by phone.  That'll get you the activation code, which you can then type or copy-paste into the keygen to get the last code."
,Vertx,2008-09-01T14:54Z,"works, followed instructions very simple.

thank you"
,fu11offa1th,2008-11-02T00:53Z,scanned with Norton 360 and has no viruses..now to test if it works.:)
,praisejah,2008-11-16T16:12Z,"To be fair, I havn't downloaded this torrent but I have the usual trial ver where you replace the  exe. with the patch ver. Did that in XP and had no problems while running AVG. Just reading about this whole AVG thing now. Tried to install on my VISTA machine, couldn't move the patch or AVG wouldn't let me move the patch. All I get is the trial ver. That's just f'd up! Thanks for all the info and on key gens not being trojans, etc. Think I read that before but you never know. Some sh*theads out there. Thanks."
,SlimxGrim,2009-05-05T09:19Z,"ahhh...LMFAO LMFAO!!!

i laugh at AVG people...i dont have it..i got it illegally before...it sucks.it basically detected my whole computer as trojans and virus..itz all illegal stuff on my laptop..no doubt AVG is working with government to clean up/out illegal files.

i have AntiVir PE  Classic...u people should use that.

i'll get back at you people with the way this download goes of Adobe Audition 3   ;)

,SlimxGrim,2009-05-05T20:15Z,what is the serial number?

Thanks.  Seeded all last night.  Will continue to seed."

Looks very nicely detailed. In Polish!!
I can't read Polish, nor can I get an accurate translation to English.

Please...
And Thank You."

Can someone confirm or deny this?"
