,atom224,2008-05-02T06:26Z,"boy, china sure has ""bought"" ie stolen a lot of US technology.  Look all of the govs have their problems. And for not buying US made goods, that's easy :)  As long as our population keeps increasing (china and india listen up) we'll be fighting like a room full of children and only two toys.  You can swap out any country names you like but greed and overpoplulation will still prevail."

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.
