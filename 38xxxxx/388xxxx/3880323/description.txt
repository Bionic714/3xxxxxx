Hawaii - message in the waves
Documentary from BBC Natural History Unit 
50 minutes

This is a much bigger file than other available versions but should make burning to disc easier for all those of you who wish to have community screenings to help your fight against plastic bags.

File is a disc image so just burn to DVD when downloaded and it should play on any old DVD player.

Please seed when you're done

Thanks
