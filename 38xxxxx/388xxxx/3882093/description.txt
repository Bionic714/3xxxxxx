
IRIS Flight Simulation Software is proud to present the British Aerospace Experimental Aircraft Program (E.A.P.). Stephen Vernava who brought us the fantastic F-14 Tomcat and David Brice have taken the superb technology demonstrator aircraft for the Eurofighter Typhoon, the E.A.P. and have created three distinct and quite different multi-role aircraft, the Tempest F.2 & T.1, the F/A-39 Vortex and the Cyclone ES.2A.

The Tempest T.1 and F.2 are the twin seat and single seat operational variants designed from the E.A.P. airframe which have been designed primarily for RAF and RAAF use. The F/A-39 Vortex is the USAF and US Navy export version of the E.A.P combat airframe and as such, features US Navy style nose-gear, tail-hook and folding wings for carrier operations. The Cyclone ES.2A is the Electronic Warfare and SEAD variant of the E.A.P. featuring a heavy duty electronic warfare suite on the center spine of the aircraft along with a suite of ALARM missiles and other ordnance designed for its role. And IRIS couldn?t forget the original E.A.P. aircraft displayed at the Farnborough Airshow back in 1986!
