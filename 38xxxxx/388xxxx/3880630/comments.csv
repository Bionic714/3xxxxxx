,unidogma,2009-07-19T20:32Z,"I have been using windows media player 11 now for ages with all my Divx, Xvid, VOB files, when renamed to Mpg, and many more, never had any issues with software liscenses etc, works a treat, better than these media centers. Simply, start media player, click on Library, Media sharing (if its not there, then download the latest media player 11) click share to, then highlight your ps3, and allow access, then add your movie folders (add to library), scan for media servers on your ps3 and away ya go!!!"
