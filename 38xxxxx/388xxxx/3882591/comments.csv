[T],moviebobo,2007-11-11T00:17Z,MPAA and RIAA scum what you gonna do now. aXXo torrents will be on TPB. Home of the fearless Pirates.
,marvedyret,2007-11-11T00:43Z,hunter 1980: werent you the one who was going to leave tpb (posting dosins of comments)along with axxo? 
,arioth,2007-11-11T03:55Z,"Read alot of stuff about aXXo leaving TPB, heard aXXo was a girl and so on....

But anyway, i think it is great having him/her back, because aXXo is the only one i use since i am a nuub in downloading :)

Thnx for sharing, and i think i speak for all of the people searching on this site. "
,marvedyret,2007-11-11T07:11Z,hunter 1980: why dont you leave the pirate bay as you promised? youre split personality is getting a little annoying!!
,dragonballz,2007-11-11T10:32Z,"hmm, title says ""Rescue.Dawn[2007]"" and nfo file(displayed here) says ""Rescue.Dawn[2006]""... contradictory, isnt it?!..."
,HenryHenryHenry,2007-11-11T11:26Z,"to dragonballz-

the movie was supposed to be released in 2006, it was seen in film festivals last year. didn't get a real release until this year. I think it had something to do with a dispute between Herzog and the producers."
,KISMO3,2007-11-11T13:29Z,Why has the real aXXo left the PB?
,Latiino,2007-11-11T20:33Z,bcoz he couldnt remove the comments on his torrents
,zarkic,2007-11-12T02:21Z,"So, is it a good quality or what?
It doesn't matter is it, or isn't an aXXo release!
Just, good or bad quality!
Download only if it's aXXo post!"
,zarkic,2007-11-12T02:21Z,"Typo, aXXo's post"

,damn_the_man,2007-11-12T09:05Z,"hunter1980 you been takin your pills you scab? Proudly sharing is axxo's punch line. So if someone else shares an axxo file, they first need permission.

Fuck off idiot.

,SD-Chargers,2007-11-28T08:51Z,Actually the movie has gotten good reviews on imdb and is recommended for war fans.
,12oclock,2007-12-06T05:46Z,"I can't believe some u fuckwads are calling this movie ""shit."" O ya guess the ones doing so are Euro Scumbags. Christian Bale doesn't make movies that are shit, it's fucking physics u assholes."

To load subtitles you have to change the video renderer type and reopen the file:

- ShockWave: n/a

You're only making yourself look more ignorant, which isn't much of a stretch."

,MagnusSK83,2008-03-26T18:35Z,"I just love the comments for this upload. I wonder how many of the US-bashing ignorants know that Werner Herzog is actually german?
And how many people can actually explain WHY they thought it was a bad movie? My guess is they were expecting Rambo and got something tasteful instead."
,SquidlyDiddly,2008-04-12T14:12Z,"forget most of the comments 
the quality is very good  both audio and visual, and contra to most people,  I found this a very entertaining  film.

,cjsulli07,2009-08-01T06:16Z,"Everyone is raging over this movie and how bad they think it is when its actually a good movie, lol.
Look on Rotten tomatoes its an 87% with 137 good reviews and only 16 bad ones. You guys must all be hannah montana fans if you think this movie is full of bad acting..."
,Akiva,2009-08-03T06:42Z,Christian Bale in a bad movie?  Thats a bunch of bull.  I agree if you dislike this movie you must be euro trash.  America #1 if you don't like it come over here and do something.  You know we don't mind fucking your shit up.

,st0gey,2012-02-07T19:33Z,"A/8
V/8

Movie: Standard U.S. pro war propaganda, awash with dismal stereotypes, trite dialogue and tedious plot. The central character, a man who indiscriminately drops bombs on men, women and children while particiapting in an illegal war in Laos and Vietnam, fails to inspire sympathy even when surrounded by ridiculous, stereotypical vietnamese 'savages'. Absolute garbage. Avoid."
