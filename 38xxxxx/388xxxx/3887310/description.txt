The story of a three-mannequin American family who has moved to Japan, welcome to the bizarre world of OH! Mikey. First shown on late-night Japanese television called "Vermillion Pleasure Night", this show has spawned a complete DVD collection of its own. Fashionably hip and gut-splitting funny, the Fuccon Family and their circle of friends and acquaintances won't fail to entertain. Once you see The Fuccon Family, you'll love them.

Incredibly, this bizarre Japanese TV show is available on DVD with English subtitles; a great treat for those in love with Japan yet don't necessarily speak Japanese.
