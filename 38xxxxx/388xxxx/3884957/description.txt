THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.
Season 1 Episode 21

"The Four Steps Affair"
Thrush agents plan to assassinate the child leader of a Himalayan nation.

(Story patched together from leftover sequences filmed for the movie versions of the Vulcan and Double affairs. You can tell by Robert Vaughn's changing hair. In this version, Thrush wants to assassinate the boy leader of a Himalayan nation. Agent Dancer was called Lancer in To Trap a Spy. Australian UNCLE agent Kitt Kittridge survives this episode, but died in The Spy With My Face. An oddity in end titles: some credits are shown over scenes of Thrushmen moving about at mansion. Other first-season end titles were shown over still frames of the episode. Luciana Paluzzi, as a sultry Thrush villainess (her scenes here are in movie version of Eps. 1), would appear shortly in the James Bond movie "Thunderball.")
