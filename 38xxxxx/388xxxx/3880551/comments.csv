,korvbuss,2007-11-15T13:27Z,Does anybody know if H2o is still outhere?
,Gugutudis,2007-11-15T18:53Z,"Some other Cubase torrents i've download sais ""Works for mac and windows"" still, just full of .exe files.. Does this .ISO contain osx files or just windows files?... CAN YOU RUN THIS ON MAC?

FUNGERAR DENNA VERISONEN PÅ MAC?"
,Nequiter,2007-11-18T11:25Z,"Seed, please.. stock at 94,8%?!???!"

,thiz-rox,2007-11-26T20:31Z,Can anyone tell me how to open the program?? there is some problem with the key?please answer.
,alfonz,2007-12-03T18:26Z,"Yes, there is a problem. if you dont have a dongle you dont have a key. And you dont have a key because this is no dongle crack"
,goodnightcaterpillar,2007-12-05T22:46Z,"Does anybody know if this version will work if I buy the Steinberg Key dongle? I wouldn't mind paying $30 to get this software running. Will that work?

In responce to Gugutudis, yes. It has a working installer for the Mac. Beyond that, I don't know its fuctionality for I have no hardware key."
,bobalichous,2007-12-12T09:57Z,Just so you know if you buy the dongle key it won't work!!!!  i did that a couple of months ago and you only get an empty usb storage unit.  the software to  open the program is NOT there!!!! don't waste your money or time just wait for a crack (if it ever comes)
,king_david,2007-12-13T07:11Z,"so big question here ...if there is no crack(obviously no dongle) and we can t use it...why is it here ?what can we do with it ?why should we download it ?...

,NorwegianDelight,2008-04-01T01:06Z,"EVERYONE listen up.. now. If your using MAC.. why on EARTH would you go for Cubase!! Its great indeed, but Logic is by far better for the Mac.. So, search Logic.. not Cubase, in that case! =) 

Anyone stil having issues cracking this =) 
Cheers"
,SkippyTheBushLicker,2008-04-21T02:06Z,yes....any got a crack????
,new_improved,2008-05-09T11:53Z,"hi!

I downloaded this program but it doesn't run on my mac. when I want to start it it always demands that I plug in a ""kopierschutzstecker"", a security plug or something.... can somebody help me to get such a thing or knows a different way to handle this?"
,dartb,2008-05-27T21:59Z,"Nowegian: I agree that if you have a Mac, Logic is the way to go but Cubase is a lot more user friendly than Logic is (changing tempo and time mid song is so much easier in Cubase imo) and as a result people decide to use it.  Although Logic 8 is utterly amazing.

And are h20 even around now?  We need somebody to emulate the dongle :("
,robobands,2008-10-29T04:07Z,"i'm confused. so does the syncrosoft license actually work for the mac installer? i've downloaded, got the error, installed to license and still got the error."
,Meadows_zeta,2008-12-26T22:14Z,"@NorwegianDelight,
Cubase is the best DAW in existence, FL Studio is the best value (I plan to buy it) and Reason is the worst of all.

Check this assessment: http://www.digitalmusicdoctor.com/shootout/shootout_summary.htm
Reason isn't even on it because it's an expensive, hard to use, user-unfriendly crap."
,fgoya,2009-03-30T14:58Z,"This Cubase Doesn't Install in Mac!!! 

Have a messege error here ""NO PROTECTION DEVICE CONNECTED""

I know that Cubase is not indicat to run in Mac. But I want to install here.

Please help!"
,MitsY,2009-10-10T23:31Z,"This worked fine for me for MAC and PC.  I went out and bought cubase essential 5 but i still couldnt open my uni work up because it was done in cubase 4.5.2, but my dongle that i got for 5 essential make this work a treat.  If you get cubase essential 5 for students it only cost £62 from dolphin in the uk.  The update to version 4.5.2 is found on there cubase website.  

Thanks to you for this upload, you have been a massive help as i can finish an old project without booking into the studio now. :)

Ciao "
,MitsY,2009-10-10T23:32Z,"oh, and i does work on mac but on pc you need to make a dvd for some reason.  If you have any probs it is always burning it to DVD anyway and running from that."
