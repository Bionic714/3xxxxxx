Pantyhose Hero (Sammo Hung, 1990) - Rmvb

Avg. Rating:  4.3 / 5 (based on 3 ratings). What did you think of it?  

Plot: After two homosexuals are murdered, police officers Sammo Hung and Alan Tam must go undercover as homosexuals to catch the killer. Ignorant, blatantly homophobic "humor" abounds--not for the easily offended.
