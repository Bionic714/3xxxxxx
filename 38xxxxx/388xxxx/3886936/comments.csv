,kingof1981,2007-12-16T15:31Z,"for all they believe that the name axxo is written for quality and secureness... that's no true... for some called ""axxo"" you need to register you via your email-adress... why do we need that... only to get more info about home downloading this torrent.  so i advare you to do this... don't register you at any place... be carefull... with greetings ko81 keep seeding keep smiling..."
,sindre34,2007-12-16T16:54Z,"If you will add subs to the movie, you have to download a srt-file. You can do that on www.divxstation.com or other sites.
Then you have to put the srt-file in a program like ``subtitle workshop`` or other programs.
When you have worked the file, you put the file in the movie."
,Colleku,2007-12-25T19:59Z,"Hey 
I'm looking for the dutch subs... anybody knows?
Thnx"
,monkiesatemybaby,2008-01-03T00:51Z,google damn nfo viewer...best nfo viewer i've found
,monkiesatemybaby,2008-01-03T01:02Z,"mixed message here, but be careful seeding this torrent since whoever uploaded it is trying to look like axxo while they obviously aren't. "
,otthau,2008-01-11T19:59Z,What the fuck??? I get The Evil Below when I try to download this. You changed the file for the torrent or something axxo?
,connor_hot,2008-01-15T21:15Z,Worst quality Ever this isnt aXXo he would never do this to us but nice D/L speeds
,emandem,2008-01-16T16:40Z,"I don't know what other guys that downloaded this torrent were watching but this torrent works just fine for me. Has great quality, audio, video works great. Thanks to aXXo-torrents for this.
Hey everyone, let's give credit where credit is due and stop bitching."
,Abjuration,2008-02-02T21:59Z,"The ""aXXo-torrents"" account is used to upload axxo torrents as axxo himself is no longer uploading on TPB. Google it or something if you want to know more/why.  "
,scoobysnacks83,2008-02-27T18:09Z,"What a crap:/ Doesn't work in Media Player,All Player, Best Player, Power DVD and new codecs... "

,kevinmax101,2008-07-18T14:46Z,"Hey guys, Get yourself a subtitle and follow the steps in here:
http://hazexp.googlepages.com/avisubtitle

I used it on I Am legend from axx0 and it turned into a sweet 450 MB[700mb original size] vid w/ permanent subs and has the same quality, Imagine putting that into the PSP, it will be smaller, and still have great quality. Im putting on Perma-subs right now on this torrent"
,kevinmax101,2008-07-18T14:48Z,"I only downloaded this files required and got them to work:
VirtualDub
VirtualDub Subtitler Filter
Subtitle WorkShop"
,rssn6,2008-09-24T04:31Z,"fast download but it is not axxo
quality is so so !!"
,dj-test,2009-01-14T00:24Z,"Quality is lower than 11 and 12. Don't really know why, the same codec is used, film has approx the same lenght and same resolution. But there is no other rip (except full dvd image and handheld version), so... It's better than nothing."
,suede678,2010-02-23T00:00Z,Thanks!!
