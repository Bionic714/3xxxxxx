,meash,2007-11-21T00:32Z,is it just me or is there something strange about this torrent? I've been trying to download it for days and it's not moving at all.. 1kb download rate. or it appears that there's no one seeding when it says on the blurb above that there's heaps of seeders. sigh!
,ihateyou92,2007-11-21T15:41Z,"Axxo LEFT TPB BECAUSE
..........................................................................
Since the Piratebay staff doesn?t care for their VIP uploaders, then aXXo decided not to use TPB and he deleted his own torrents.

aXXo was constantly exposed to assaults and harassments from possible members of MPAA. Their strategy was to harass aXXo by posting absurd and accusing comments on aXXo?s torrents.

The latest assault incident was especially noticed on aXXo?s last torrent ?The Simpsons?.
Hunter1980 and aXXo were involved in direct argue with possible members from MPAA.



Since PirateBay did not take any action towards ?Organized attacks?, aXXo decided to delete his torrent on TPB. aXXo is continuing posting his torrents on mininova or other torrent sites since they care for their VIP uploaders.

2 - this movie sucked.  either you are anti-gay and hated it for the pro-gay moments, or you are pro-gay and hated it for the derogatory anti-gay stuff, either way, it missed the mark"

,Dan8145,2007-12-27T02:06Z,"I dont know if anyone else had this problem, but as soon as I downloaded this movie, I kept getting Windows Explorer errors everytime I opened the containing folder. Im certainly not blaming aXXo for this, but the only way to fix it was to delete the movie. As soon as it was gone, everything was fine."
,ticktock_man,2007-12-28T05:57Z,this is really a bad movie. the only good thing about it is Jessica Biel's ass making a brief appearance. the rest is shite. adam sandler stopped being funny back in the 90s.

are you using utorrent?

i have 10mb broadband, and i got very slow downloads with utorrent, especially after trying to tweak it. Im now using bitcomet 1.05 and im currently getting a speed of 400kb/s

i downloaded a film before and was getting 1mb/s.

Try bitcomet, it may improve your dl speed, it did for me

Hope this helps :)"

,LFGD1978,2009-07-22T17:54Z," Actually you don't even have to know how to seed...... just do nothing. After you add the torrent and it reach the seeding goal, It will start seeding automatically.

 If you don't remove the torrent it will continue the seeding process (unless to change the default preferences of course)

Cheers mate!!!"
,zickenlotto,2009-08-09T13:09Z,LFGD1978  Thanks for answering the seed question :) ihave wondered too but lol. Didn't know that it was that easy :P. Well thanks anyway know i know how to seed. About the movie. I don't know how it is but i have read the comments and thought i could check it out! Hope this is a good movie :)

Everyone is new to torrents at some point i feel that comment was unfair.
You must have started somewhere."
,waffleamos,2010-04-14T00:17Z,all you have to do is leave the torrent open after it is finished downloading and you will continue to seed ( share) with other people
