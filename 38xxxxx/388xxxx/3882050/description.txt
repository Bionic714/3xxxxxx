Synopsis: Frank Sinatra told the director to give the newcomer a break. John Sturges (The Great Escape) obliged, providing favorable camera angles for SinatraÂ´s young co-star. In his first big-budget film, Steve McQueen was ready to grab the movie worldÂ´s attention. McQueen plays Bill Ringa, one of the O.S.S. combatants harassing the enemy in World War II Burma. Sinatra is Capt. Tom Reynolds, leading the guerilla fighters and risking court martial while doing so. Also among Never So FewÂ´s many are Charles Bronson, Peter Lawford and in her first Hollywood film, Gina Lollobrigida. About McQueen, the New York Herald TribuneÂ´s reviewer wrote: "He possesses that combination of smooth-rough charm that suggests star possibilities." A star is born in Never So Few..
