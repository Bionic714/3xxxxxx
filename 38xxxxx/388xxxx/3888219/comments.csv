,Devils_Reject,2007-11-22T21:31Z,"uh humm..... mr potato head, all axxos original torrents were removed from this site by his/her/their own request. Axxo no longer resides at the pirate bay."
,Xxtr3m,2007-11-23T10:53Z,And i wounder why....
,Sleak,2007-11-26T03:36Z,"aXXo left due to TPB not taking care of his torrents and deleting the rude comments people posted on his torrents. aXXo-torrents re-uploads aXXo's torrents because aXXo no longer uploads movies on TPB. If you want to see what aXXo has uploaded, head to his/her website: http://axxo-release.blogspot.com/

For a low-budget Horror movie, this was actually pretty good. The story was laid down pretty good and I liked how they kept ""Satan"" mysterious."
