,123yes,2007-11-20T01:26Z,is there a crack for this one or is it just the cd?
,Truvbay,2007-12-09T15:44Z,"What kind of a stupid jackass would post a uif file? With all the methods available, why choose uif? Thanks for the up, but next time think a little about what you are doing first."
,robinhood77,2007-12-20T20:10Z,"To the provider: thanks for the CD.
To the critic: what is wrong with the uif file?
It is just a compression format.
To decompress just get magicdisk from
http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-history.htm
and you will get the iso to burn."
,lionking1,2008-01-01T04:00Z,I don't see crack for this cd. You can't download any online transaction without registration.
,PirateRick,2008-01-08T10:37Z,"wahoooo!! i got money!!i got money.....
Thankyou robinhood.....also kermacy ur a moneysaver"
,irgendwas,2008-01-12T10:22Z,"UIF sucks because it only works with MagicISO. It's annoying to have to install a bunch of different tools which all basically do the same thing, like Nero, Alcohol 120%, etc.

Stick to defacto standards like .iso or .cue/.bin please. :)"
,Newb787,2008-01-15T00:09Z,No crack?  What's the point. My bank justs told me to fuck off cuz I was using the 2002 version without issue but they've upgraded their system and now you have to buy the licensed version/register to download your finance stuff.  This app is useless without a crack. 
,brianxxx,2008-01-17T02:15Z,"I do agree with ramsink but that was very rude. 

Basically, 
I do appreciate the contribution, but I really wish people would get it right and post an image in the universal and easiest to work with format.... 

.ISO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No strange extra software needed. All programs will work with it. No stress, no headaches. 

Please people, use ISO."
,webShock,2008-01-21T04:24Z,"a lot of torrents I am coming across that are in uif and DAA format are riddled with people saying they are cloaked viruses that execute when you decompress. 

Is that the case for this file? Im guess traditional AV's cant scan inside this rarely used format. "
,ElCuco,2008-02-03T02:46Z,"Isn't it dangerous to use the online update feature to retrieve information from bank accounts? I know that the activation feature in this torrent is disabled (just install and go) but what type of activation does Intuit use anyway, can they still find out if it is a hacked version you are using? 

Blessings and Thank you (to whoever answers)!"
,covenant69,2008-04-01T18:11Z,"UIF is a pain in the butt. If you want compression, use RAR or ZIP! Stick with standards!"
,spystyle,2008-04-14T14:59Z,"UIF isn't so bad, it takes only a few minutes to get MagicISO and convert it to ISO. 

MagicISO claims that UIF has better compression - if that is true than it is like comparing RAR (standard) to 7zip. 7zip has better compression than RAR and should be considered the new standard because it saves bandwidth.

Don't be afraid to adopt a new, better standard. 

Quit your bitching and install the required apps. Bitching is for ladies. Men should appreciate better compression, quicker download time, and saved bandwidth."
,chimpakawanzelu,2008-04-17T07:52Z,"Don't waste your time with this piece of shit.  I have never bad-mouthed a torrent, but this deserves it.  Majic ISO is worth a bucket of dicks.  Hands down the worst software I've ever used.  I uninstalled this and I'm still removing reminants from this garbage as I write this.  

Download this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3865827/Quicken_Home_and_Business_2008

It's a rar-ed file and dl'ed in 19 minutes.  I'll be seeding the .rar and not that shit stain .uif file.  I've already removed and deleted it from my seeding column.  I don't want to spread this crap.  To the comment above: call me a lady, but to do something smarter and faster is definately a male trait (i.e. - winrar).

Sorry, but it had to be said."

,unixbocx,2008-06-03T18:34Z,"gee folks! whats the big deal,  I will admit it would be nice if all us bootleggers got together and used a standard compression method,  but I think what would be even nicer is if who ever is offering the torrent offered up something that they tested and knew worked, to many times i have come across bad torrents that where a waste of time.. this torrent on the other hand worked, PowerISO has no problem with it and this torrent will be added into me collecting.."
,eel64,2008-06-05T04:12Z,"I need an Australian version, can anyone point in right direction.
Thanks.

BTW

Guys don't b2 choosy about file type for download, but BE appreciative for the download.

Otherwise go out there and pay for it..

,sweaterpuppies1,2008-06-10T09:03Z,"Don't trust any torrents using .uif or other proprietary formats when we have perfectly usable ones which have become standard.

It just means the person who created the torrent is a complete fuckwit and has no idea wtf they are doing. ""Why can't we just install MagicISO its so easy"" ? Because there is no fucking need you moronic newfag. Why can't you just not be an imbecile and use a standard image archive format? Are you that stupid to go with ""but MagicISO says they are better"" ? Fucking hell compress the .ISO yourself with zip/rar/7z if you have to, and see the amazing NON-DIFFERENCE!

Why are you purposefully making it more difficult to use this image? The size difference is not THAT FUCKING INCREDIBLE.

In short boycott this shit, never download this crap and heckle these idiots till they understand."
,sweaterpuppies1,2008-06-10T09:10Z,"Perfect case in point, here is the EXACT SAME SOFTWARE but not using the shitty .uif proprietary format.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3865827/Quicken_Home_and_Business_2008

Using a normal image archive format compressed with RAR. And whats this?! Gasp!!! IT IS SMALLER?!

THERE GOES THE WHOLE FUCKING IDIOTIC ""FACT"" THAT MAGICISO MAKES IT SMALLER!

Please stop being idiots and thinking uif is some magical format that just makes things smaller when nothing else can. I know the application is named MagicISO but you don't have to be a complete fucking imbecile about it.

DivX says they encode 1000% faster (than the most basic of settings of generic brand X). It is marketing jargon, welcome to 21st century."
,Calab,2008-07-14T07:35Z,"""THERE GOES THE WHOLE FUCKING IDIOTIC ""FACT"" THAT MAGICISO MAKES IT SMALLER!""

Uhm... dumbass... Can you mount a RAR file?

We should all be pushing to make UIF a standard. It offers all the funtionality of an ISO and takes less space. You don't need to uncompress it to use it.

Instead of griping on how little support there is, you should be complaining to Nero, Roxio and Alcohol that their software DOESN'T support UIF. "
,oneon,2008-07-21T16:57Z,What kind of person downloads and uses pirated banking software? AHHHH must be the same person who downloads operating systems and virus software...Hey good luck with that...
,5krille5,2008-09-22T02:12Z,WOW.......! Thanks. You help me/fix that huge money-bag so I can buy the house i only dremt about....... Once again:::::::: Thank You so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,ck69,2010-03-15T22:32Z,you are all dumb cunts.
