,Musictrade,2007-11-24T23:18Z,"In this case FLAC would have been pointless as these originals were recorded in lossy formats. In the future we are likely to release also lossless field recording material up to 24bit/88.2 kHz quality - these we will naturally release encoded in FLAC in original quality.
