,skadonai,2009-11-11T05:09Z,"First of all, Thanks VERY much for the up. Volume 1 is missing page v1-020. It goes straight from v1-019 to v1-021. I'm not bitching, because I realize that a lot of work went into this so I could download it for free, but is there any way we can get page v1-020?? It looks like the page was used to make a cut out of Rin's character, and was mistakenly not put back in.. PLEASE fix this, I would SOOO appreciate it!"
