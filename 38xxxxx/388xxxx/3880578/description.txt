ESET Smart Security was designed to be complete solution in the field of computer protection against infiltrations and attacks. Eset Smart Security offers more than just a sum of its parts ? it is synergy that matters most. If all components are used simultaneously, the effectiveness of the whole program is multiplied. ESET Smart Security unifies all its functions to create a complex security solution.

ESET Smart Security is based on three basic pillars:

ESET NOD32 Antivirus + Antispyware
┬╖ This component is in fact an improved version of the award-winning scanning engine of NOD32 Antivirus v2.7. With respect to program's unprecedented scanning speed, the following improvements have been made:
┬╖ Improved system of cleaning and deleting infiltrations. The antivirus system now intelligently cleans and deletes infiltrations with no need for user interaction.
┬╖ Computer scan can be run in background in order to use only a part of system resources. Thus scanning will not affect the performance of your computer and you will be able to work on it as usual.
┬╖ The resident protection supports archive scanning.
┬╖ Update optimization, smaller update package size than in version 2.7, more effective management and protection of update files against damage.
┬╖ Email protection for users of Outlook Express.

ESET Personal Firewall
┬╖ Firewall monitors all traffic between a protected computer and other computers in the local network and in the Internet. High quality protection is provided by the following functions:
┬╖ Scanning of application protocols HTTP and POP3 (used for Internet browsing and for retrieving email from servers) for infiltrations.
┬╖ Checking low-level network communication which helps to avoid many of various remote attacks.
┬╖ Ability to recognize the character of network connections established by various types of infiltrations and ability to automatically terminate them.
┬╖ Filtering of incoming and outgoing communication based on user defined rules.
┬╖ Monitoring changes in executable files.
┬╖ Interactive and automatic mode. The former enables you to create your own filtering rules, the latter filters all communication automatically.
