[T],FaeGiN,2009-01-11T07:46Z,"SUPERB!
I heard a bit of 'Murder on the Orient Express' on BBC7 the other night and it was pretty good..so thought I'd come looking for it as I fell asleep and also don't know when the next episode is on.
This way I get to choose the time it is played  :)
Also I notice you have two versions of that story....interesting.
Thanks a lot, great seed!!"
