[T],Micke_11,2007-11-12T18:30Z,"Just one question;
when I burn a dvd I use DVD decrypter
does that work for PS2 as well??
or do I need another program to burn ISO files to a dvd inorder to work for PS2??"
,ps2world,2007-11-12T22:03Z,"Open DVD Decryptor and go to MODE>ISO>READ and copy the game. Make an ISO file on your PC. 

Then go to MODE>ISO>WRITE and select the ISO file that DVD Decryptor just made and burn the file on DVD. "
,jongari,2007-11-15T15:37Z,ps2world: That you are telling above - what program are you using too do that?
,ps2world,2007-11-15T17:00Z,"if you just need a copy from a ps2 game use a program like nero or alcohol 120% (and maybe anydvd). you can make a disc to disc copy or an ISO file. is this your question? if you want to know more about the programs please search on google, 'cause with the tools in this pack you can manipulate ps2 games (f.e. pes2008) or copy save games from your pc to your ps2 and back."

,RR92,2008-12-06T05:03Z,"Can't get Max Drive to run on PS2!

I've done (almost) everything on this page here: http://www.gamehoof.com/2006/06/06/copying-ps2-saved-games-to-pc/ -- got the USB stick, reformatted it to FAT, then burned the ""MAXDrive.mdf"" (folder 'Max Drive PS2') with Alcohol 120%, installed ""MAXDrive.mdf"" (folder 'Max Drive PC EU') on computer. Then I plug in my USB drive into PS2, insert the burned Max Drive CD and reboot. It eventually comes up with this message: ""Please insert a PlayStation or PlayStation 2 format disc.""

Did I miss something or am I doing this completely wrong? Please help."
,S3nd41,2011-10-07T19:18Z,Can anyone share a recent version of Max Drive? This torrent is dead.
