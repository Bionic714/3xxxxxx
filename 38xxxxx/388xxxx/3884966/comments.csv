,S-n-o-w,2007-11-15T02:11Z,"well, works for me"
,hyphens,2007-11-15T09:49Z,"It doesn't work...
I use the crack with retail version of Crysis I bought.

When I used it, it showed ""Failed to load the game DLL"".

Does this crack only meant to use with Razer1911's Crysis release only?"
,hyphens,2007-11-15T10:10Z,"Well, I think it's not a real crack, could be a trojan like others said.

Aside from the crack doesn't work, it also open 2 process of ""firefox.exe"" every time I use, trying to connect out."

,jyunker,2007-11-18T19:23Z,where do i extract this file in the crysis folder
,jyunker,2007-11-18T19:29Z,err where to i extract the crack into the crysis file i dont know which .dll to delete
,shadowmoose,2007-11-26T12:27Z,"If you downloaded the Razor1911 torrent here, http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3883491/Crysis-Razor1911 
Then you already have the crack.  Just extract the files into an iso, use daemon tools to mount the iso.  Then when it asks for a key during installation, go to my computer and right click on the crysis dvd and click explore.
Go to the Razor1911 folder and click the keygen and it should fill it out for you.
After installing the game simply copy the crysis.exe file from the Razor1911 folder into the directory you installed crysis to.  Make sure to overwrite the original crysis.exe file.
Then simply mount up the game in daemon and click play.  Avast Anti-virus doesn't say this is a trogan."
,koontz,2007-12-06T11:58Z,shadowmoose du kan kanske förklara hur man öppnar den filen för jag kan inte öppna iso filen.. när jag trycker öppna så ska den börja bränna skiten
