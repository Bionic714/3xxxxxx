,tsepash,2007-11-11T00:46Z,I deleted this and am re-uploading due to search problems
,tsepash,2007-11-11T01:21Z,"OK, since I have some dlers I am not going to delete this. I guess people will have to be a bit more creative when searching and use something other than ""karaoke"", as i did not put it in the torrent name."
,leatherface7778,2007-11-15T16:10Z,i've tried for 4 days and only 32% whats the deal?
,celemirima,2007-11-20T01:26Z,"yeah, great stuff, just seed it, and I can seed for a week atleast afterwords!"
,celemirima,2007-11-21T15:15Z,"I'm still stuck at 29.5%, whats the deal!"
,kelv1969,2007-11-27T00:49Z,I just wish you hadn't 'zipped' all the tracks together in one lump. People could have selected the tracks they wanted to download a few at a time and wouldn't have to wait so long before using them.
,kid_zeal7,2007-11-30T04:27Z,"ahh!!  i really want this one for the snow patrol song.  please seed, and thanks!!!"

,tsepash,2008-01-10T09:52Z,"Ok Dont try to DL this....due to a wretched virus I had to remove alot of stuff from my PC...therefore...I no longer have the original torrent that I created, guess I will have to remake it and upload.  I will post here when the new file has been re-released."
,bigdaddybass,2008-02-22T19:32Z,"hey tsepash - you wouldn't happen to have, or be able to find the backing track for ""Paralyzer"" by Finger Eleven..would you?  I know THM has it out now, its on this month's release (0802? I think?)..but I can't seem to find it anywhere. :("
,cowboyz,2008-02-24T22:08Z,please seed or if this has a virus put a link to one that works all i want is meant to live karaoke!!!!
