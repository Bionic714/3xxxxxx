1.0 is the first album of Orxata Sound System, until now we had been able to listen to a pair of beta versions and a demo.
This is the result of more than two years of work; an album in which different influences within electronic music and valencian folk music come together; electro, dub, drum&bass, ragga, rap, jazz, folk, tecno, dance... Four voices, a bass, a trumpet and a programmer, along with valuable collaborations like the one of Carles Belda to the accordion (Pomada), Marc Sempere to the shouts (Jalea Real and i), Marcos Ã?beda with trombone (Obrint Pas) and dj Chola and dj V(Sucios Por Norma) to plates.
The new sound of valÃ¨ncia, Post-Bacalao in pure state!
