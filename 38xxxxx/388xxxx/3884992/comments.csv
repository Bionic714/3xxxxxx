I purchased all these of course but sharing them with these guys cause they would never purchase them so I don't figure I am taking away any business from them but I want people to hear the truth and this is a good avenue for that. 

Cheers and upload your stuff !!

,goduke150,2008-07-11T08:05Z,"Hah! Let's not call it ""stealing"" let's just say we're spreading the gospel in different manners. :) I figure if someone wants to download this, at least it's better than anything else out there.

Yeah, I've got a pretty good movie collection. Give me your contact information and I'll see what I can do to get you some of it."
