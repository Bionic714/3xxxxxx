It's no secret. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir just keeps getting better. Now, some of the Choir's most requested music has been newly recorded for Then Sings My Soul. From the glorious, soul-stirring hymn "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning" to the soothing strains of "Lead, Kindly Light" and the sing-along melody of "There is Sunshine in My Soul Today," each song in this collection is a time-honored favorite. Then Sings My Soul includes associated conductor Mack Wilberg's magnificent new arrangements of such classics as "High on the Mountain Top." "How Firm a Foundation," "Redeemer of Israel," and "Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee." Also featured are updated versions of perennial favorites like "O Divine Redeemer," "The Lord's Prayer," "How Great Thou Art," "I Know That My Redeemer Lives," and "Abide with Me."
