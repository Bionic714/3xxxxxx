Almost all of these are Nan's cap of the show.  At least one I reencoded that I got from seCabra and at least one from somewhere else.  Thanks to all those that cap this and post it in various places for everyone to watch!

All files are similar so this is a good example of one of the shows:
608 x 368
23.976
43:28
990 kbps XviD
48000Hz  128 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo  MP3

Sorry it all don't fit one one DVD-R.  Quality is more important to me than size.
