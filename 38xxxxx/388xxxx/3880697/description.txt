About The Book
From the pen of P.G. Wodehouse, 'The Clicking of Cuthbert' is a collection of short stories on the subject of golf. One storyincludes the thoughts of Miss Forrester who thinks it is the silliest game ever invented.
Can anyone find new sources of humor in golf? Certainly, it takes a great humorist to do so. P.G. Wodehouse pulled off this feat by combining an obvious love for the game with sense of irony about the humiliations that golfers experience for their sport, a subtle mix of love and how golf can complicate that emotion, and a hilariously overbearing narrator who is obviously the biggest windbag in the golf club. 

About The Author
P.G. Wodehouse (1881-1975) To the envy of every writer, Sir Wodehouse invented a character whose name has entered our vocabulary. Jeeves, the generic name of any butler, came into being as the impeccable "gentleman's gentleman," whose employer was Bertie Wooster. Witty and prolific, Wodehouse wrote over 100 novels, as well as many short stories, sketches, librettos, and lyrics for Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Knighted shortly before his death, he was born and educated in England.
