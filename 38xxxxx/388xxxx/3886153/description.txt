Martin Freeman plays Chris, a frustrated TV producer who is forced to leave his unreliable flatmate Bob played by Velibor Topic in charge of showing a series of real estate agents around the house he is trying to sell. Worried by Bob's habit of spending all day working in the basement playing loud music, Chris asks his friend to listen out for the door bell and show anyone who comes calling inside. Bob promises to do exactly that and for once, not to let him down.
