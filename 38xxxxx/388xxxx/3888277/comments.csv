,roc_strongo,2008-05-03T17:06Z,do you have unabridged?
,greygelgoog,2008-10-09T22:19Z,I think the abridged version is the only version as an audio book.  If you want the unabridged version you're going to have to read it.

,TheBoxNinja,2009-01-07T02:26Z,"I'm just going on on a limb here SpeakEasy11 but since they're all mp3's just make a playlist in Windows Media Player or Itunes, then drag all the files over, then play them. Pretty simple."

,xtazee,2009-05-10T14:50Z,whats the difference between abridged and unabridged copy? 
,damunzy,2009-06-01T02:19Z,"Abridged means that it was shortened for the format. Normally this is done for time concerns and pacing. From Publishers Weekly review on Amazon ""The abridgment keeps the story tight but struggles with the interviewer's narration during interviews."""
,TraumaHound,2010-10-01T04:29Z,"Awesome, thanks!"
