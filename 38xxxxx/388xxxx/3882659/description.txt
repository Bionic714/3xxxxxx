This is one of the first demos from the band Demiricous.  It is simply titled Demo Anno and was released in 2003.  There are other demos out there but unfortunately I don't have them.  This is in MP3 format and 192kbps.  

Demiricous are a death/thrash metal band out of Indianapolis, Indiana. Within a couple of months of forming, guitarist Ben Parrish (formerly of Upheaval on Willowtip Records) joined the band and they began to take their project more seriously. In 2005, they self-released a demo which caught the attention of Metal Blade.

Their debut album, One (Hellbound) was recorded and mixed at Planet-Z Studios with Zeuss (Hatebreed, The Red Chord, Shadows Fall) in June 2005 and released later that year. Following this the band set out on a tour with Himsa in late 2006.

It has also been stated that the bands name, Demiricous, has no significant meaning at all and is just a made up word. The band have already gained a worldwide fanbase with their debut album, and have earned the respect and praise of metal icons Slayer.

Their follow-up album, Two (Poverty), was released in 2007.
