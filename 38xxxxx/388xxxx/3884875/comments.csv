@liquidmonkey

thanks for the tip!!"
,Skidpalace,2009-06-06T06:48Z,"Could not run the game with the cracked exe, but I was able to play with the original crysis64.exe.  I don't know how, but it just does.
Playing with the cracked .exe gives me a blank screeen for 10 seconds or so and then it kicks back to the desktop.
I tell you what, though... This game blows me friggin away.  Rockin an i7 920 stock speed with GTX 260 superclocked at 626mhz on Win 7 x64 RC.  1680x1050 @ very high settings.  THIS IS THE REASON I BUILT MY NEW COMPUTER.  Speifically for this game.  It was worth every penny.  Photorealistic graphics smooth as silk.   I am so happy I could shit myself.
I can't believe I am playing Crysis at very high settings and I don't even have to OC my i7.  Joy."
,Skidpalace,2009-06-06T15:26Z,"There's no joy in mudville.  Looks like this fix/crack does NOT work for Win7 x64.  It must have been some fluke that I ran it last night, because I cannot get it to restart.  I got one instance to start, and get through tne menu to load a game, and then B(lack)SOD.  This, once again, is with the original crysis64.exe.  The cracked 64.exe gives me a ""could not launch main application"" error."
,juxkobiak,2009-08-22T09:56Z,"I have got the Win7 x64 crash too...
My computer is a AMD X2 3800+, 3GB DDRII, XFX GTX260, Win7 64bit and canÂ´t get it to work either :(
Anyone knows a way to make it start working?!?!"

,tranqueirex,2009-12-21T00:22Z,It does NOT work at windows 7 x64. unfortunately. you should pray to mighty Razor to get that!

,OreoDragon,2011-03-27T22:37Z,"FOR W7 64-BIT USERS: Apply the crack, then start the 64-bit version of the game by running the Crysis.exe in the Bin64 folder. NOT Crysis64.exe. If you do this, it should run flawlessly.

It may be worth noting that before I did this I set both Crysis.exe and Crysis64.exe to Vista SP2 compatibility mode with admin privileges, but that may not be necessary."
,El__Jefe,2011-04-19T23:06Z,"Hey fuckers, I got it to work. Like someone else said:

Go to Bin64
Right-click on crysis.exe after replacing it
Go to compatibility  > Vista (service pack 2)
Also check run as administrator

Worked."
