              As a child I loved the book "Spacecraft 2000 to 2100AD",       
                      and years later I found it on amazon.com,              
              eventually purchasing the other three books in the series.     
                                                                             
            Because my torrent of the first book "Spacecraft" was so         
         well recieved even after only one day, also from the stories        
         of people finally being able to find this book from their           
         childhood like me (and by popular demand as well),                   
         I have decided to scan and torrent the other three books.

          - from "The Wisdom of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
