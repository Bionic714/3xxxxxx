NYP presents:
FR3QNAST3 in WHATEVER HAPPENED TO MTV?

We were at a bar, and I was really missing NY. I was missing the music scene to the point that I brought my ipod mini with me everywhere. I had it on that moment I realized that I was staring into a 60 inch plasma screen watching Alex Rodriguez round the bases over and over again.

So imagine being in a bar and they are playing some 80's crap song that never made it, while listening to your ipod in one ear, your friend in the other, while watching espn in 7 minute loops.

I remembered:

The Dark Side of the Moon and Wizard of Oz together.

It worked for me.
It inspired me to buy the dvd and album. I added TDSOTM as audio tracks on the disc. I left out the menus, so the disc played on insert.

With a little research one will find the connections between free silver and the Wizard of Oz. So in that composition we clearly understand the musical movements, and their connections to the original film.

WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO MTV? combines machismo on film with a sound track composed of underground electronic music of the moment. Or, what music television could be. More cinematic than tvish, this DVD will push the next VJ to release a mix to further push the envelope.
