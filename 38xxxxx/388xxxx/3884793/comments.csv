,sitri,2007-11-12T12:29Z,Seeding would be nice :)
,reisp,2007-11-12T21:49Z,"sitri: try it anyway!

I've got both seeders and leechers: I'm not sure why TPB shows 0/0.

Perhaps I did something wrong when I created the torrent, but it is actually working..."
,naboth,2007-11-13T04:14Z,very cool.  Thanks!
,Weesi,2007-12-04T19:32Z,Thankyou!!..
,sipat78,2008-08-07T12:54Z,Please  seed :)
,downlowder,2008-09-28T19:29Z,"Very Nice rar,  300+ decks and I cant choose which ones I want.  Thanks for the torrent, but no thanks for the lack of choice."
,Overage,2008-10-18T20:09Z,"Thanks for the torrent !!! 
btw, anyone got a key for the Orphalese?"
,JohnnyProblemsolver,2008-10-19T21:24Z,"Overage, please read the description thoroughly."
,snapbee,2008-11-22T03:13Z,"Johnny, the description says no part of the program is included; it seems to me that Overage understands that and still wants someone else to provide a key for the program.  You can have an opinion on that or not, but some people want free software and maybe someone will provide for him."
,adrian144,2008-12-12T02:09Z,"This is great! Or it would be if I could open it. Tugzip just hangs, possibly due to lack of memory. Anyone know of anything which can open big-ass rar files?"
,friendofthedevil2,2009-01-24T22:13Z,brilliant!
,holocausticity,2010-02-15T01:53Z,"divisions would be nice. next time, k?
