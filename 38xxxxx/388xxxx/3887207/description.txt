Enter Newstopia. Screening every Wednesday after Anton Enus' World News Australia, the half-hour satire will take aim at politicians and other bigwigs, and at the way we see ourselves on the world stage. Are we part of Asia? The 51st state of the US? Or do we still cling to the apron strings of Mother England?

"The conceit of the show is that Australia is the best possible place to judge the rest of the world because we have no control over it," Micallef says. "But we're desperately concerned about what the neighbours think of us."

Comparisons to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report are inevitable, but Newstopia is not a local version. There's no live audience, for a start, and it won't be as "unrelentingly parodic" as those popular US satires. Squint and you might even mistake it for a real news show - albeit one that honours the internationally focused, celebrity-free formula of SBS. Sport, weather and reports from "correspondents" are also part of the deal.
