Avg. Rating:  3.7 / 5 (based on 7 ratings). What did you think of it?  

Overview: Yuen Biao and Yuen Shun-Yi star in Dreadnaught. Known as the "White Tiger", the mean-spirited villain (Shun-Yee) is forced to hide out from the law. He joins a travelling circus troupe, where he makes life miserable for a meek laundryman named Mousey (Baio). When the White Tiger kills Mousy's best friend, the worm turns. The climax finds hero and heavy challenging one another while garbed in dragon costumes. Dreadnaught's pace seldom lags as it builds to its three-ring finale.
