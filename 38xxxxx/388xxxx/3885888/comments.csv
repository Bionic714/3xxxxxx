,LightTheRebellion,2010-09-01T18:36Z,"Might I ask why your videos are low-quality rips? I mean, the screen resolution for the average user has jumped up to 1024x768, and is most often much higher (as it is with my laptop). Trying to watch this movie with more than one person becomes rather difficult when the video is the size of a Myspace ad.

You have so many great movies - the extended versions, even - and it just seems like your efforts could be more appreciated with higher resolution rips."
,WeedPirate,2010-11-26T06:30Z,Props!! my favorite movie of all time!

uhhh jees, well ummm...
3 YEARS AGO things were different...
But I suppose people will still be critical of these in 3 more years. Testament to their usefulness.

Critics are never late to the party, but no matter how many years goes by, I still haven't figured out how to upload intelligence, just entertainment."
,vanillabullshit,2010-12-06T07:13Z,"Thanks for the share, top notch flick"
,traloth,2010-12-10T15:00Z,"lol WeeKnight: Recognise! (ah that's a Scrubs joke for those playing at home). 

The extended scenes are awesome just a shame they didn't bother getting the real actors back into the studio for the ADR, sounds like they've used voice actors to fill in the audio in the scenes and the difference is palatable. Lol palpable even. Stupid Mozilla spell-check!  

ANYWAY for repeat viewings I've had to go with the non-extended version because of the half-arse fashion they've tacked on the extended scenes though I spose back in 66 the idea of a 'director's cut' was but an embryonic concept. 

But many thanks WK! 

Cheers,
JK"

,jsktrogdor,2011-10-18T15:18Z,"@ Light the Rebellion:

Fullscreen:  ""A fullscreen image or video occupies the screen entirely""

Usually + or + on Mac.  

Your your worried about resolution?  It was made in the 1960s what do you want; Sergio Leone to go reshoot it with HD cameras?  Maybe you should go buy the ""BLUERAY TOTALLY AWESOME REMASTERED EDITION"" like all the other saps in the Best Buy.  That way you can see the poor quality film stock in VIVID detail.  "
