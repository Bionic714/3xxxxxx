,samuryan,2008-03-30T20:29Z,"this is japanese audio + english subs

anyone got the english audio version? i hate reading subtitles :D"
,loefgren,2008-04-07T01:13Z,this is the best anime EVER done.
,.wenis_,2008-04-08T01:59Z,"It only plays the first 10-20 seconds of each episode but everything else seems fine, file size etc. Anyone?"
,iain88,2008-05-07T18:19Z,NICE ONE!!! Thank god it's Japanese with subs. Too many great films have been spoiled by terrible American accent dubs
,cyberscythe,2008-05-23T03:24Z,believe it or not its actually pretty good with the american subs.
,h1m8,2008-06-07T22:59Z,"The english voice acting is pretty good in this show.  Actually, most modern anime has good overall eng dubs.  The ones that are bad are usually old stuff from 80s-90s that people in the US are just watching.  You can't base everything on that b/c US animation had horrible voice work then too.  Thundercats had three people doing every single voice (it seemed that way).

I will agree that you do hear the same eng voice actors in all the good eng anime dubs.  That does get old."
,Smoothie7745,2008-06-18T11:36Z,"I still say Trigun is the greatest anime series ever, but this one is fucking good."
,duckdistrick,2008-07-04T20:05Z,Hey cam someone please seed ep.18 that is all I need!!!!
,norm510,2008-07-10T09:33Z,"thanks man, great show"
,RaPLipS,2008-07-24T05:17Z,Please seed :)
,MisplacedFate1313,2008-07-31T06:32Z,"Japanese language, English subtitles. You anime purists can rant all you want about dubs - Shinichiro Watanabe's shows have been dubbed spectacularly."
,ad_astra_ink,2008-10-31T22:11Z,Subs over Dubs
,javier21,2008-11-27T12:48Z,HEY MAN TNKS FOR THE DOWNLOAD xD
,Aaris123,2008-12-13T15:04Z,"Stuck at 92,9% please seed :) thanks for the upload btw"
,Manster42002,2008-12-26T13:27Z,"Although appropriate for the story line and (I believe) the intent of the writers, I'd would love this series to continue but some things are best left the way they are -- I highly recommend this series to any anime fan. I've have seen both the english dubbed versions and the Japanese dialogue with subs. Though I don't speak Japanese, I felt the original dialogue was much stronger and brought a better sense of what the creators were after. In short, the show whooped ass. 

And as a side note --- Damn, ppl -- Most ppl don't seed ever because they feel their downloads go faster if they don't (which is NOT true) -- Pls stop asking for seeding and bear with it -- Take it from an old MSN tech -- The vast majority of ppl online are DUMBASSES -- It is a small price to pay compared than having to buy the damn episodes from some stupid store in the mall -- Count your blessings and enjoy this ability to download you have while it lasts

Also, try Ninja Scroll, Akira (of course), Cowboy Bebop and Trigun too if you enjoyed this"
