,jacksomeone,2008-05-14T02:59Z,"Just for the curious, this file ends in the middle of the Mount Robson Flyover. None of the stuff before that is cut in anyway."
,jacksomeone,2008-05-19T03:51Z,Now we're all stuck at ~90%. Seed please...
,jim256,2008-11-22T05:29Z,Hmm this is going pretty slow. Any seeders?
