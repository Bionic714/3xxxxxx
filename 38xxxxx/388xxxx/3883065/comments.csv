NO viruses,spyware, and etc.

i have tried on Windows XP Pro SP3 32-bit & Windows Vista Ultimate SP1 32-bit. WORKS!

EXCEPT! for one issue, and it seems im not the only one..... >.>

When i finish adding/previewing effects... Once i close the effects window. The program locks up, and i have to end the process via task manager.

Any one have a solution to that issue???"
,myname150,2008-07-30T16:22Z,"!!!!!!

i figured out a fix for the lock-ups. When you are adding effects.... Make sure you have a preview playing before you click OK or CANCEL or w/e.

I have been doing that while i was making a remix (over an hour now...hehhe multitasking) and it hasnt locked up one me once.

GO ahead give it a try, and tell us if my little trick works. ^_^"

This is clean people.  Clean as a whistle.  And NO, there isn't any DLL problem.  As it's already been stated several times, NUKE THE SHORTCUTS CREATED BY THE INITIAL TRIAL INSTALL and create new ones manually to the replacement exe file.  Don't wait and see if you get any errors, just do it."

* The editbox (where you write the filename) is in an odd position and stays in that fixed position no matter how you resize the window.

* Selecting any previous folders in the dropdown list doesn't do anything. If you have written anything in the editbox, it will return an error while you select a folder in the dropdown list, that goes on about Invalid Filename.

2. next uncheck run audition and check the open file location box. This opens up where the trial put your setup.exe.

3.  run this setup.exe  when you do you will be asked where you want to install audition.  leave it in the default folder.  I run Vista and it installed in programs(x86).

4.  click computer, c:, program files(x86), adobe, adobe audition.

5. THIS is the folder you install the Crack. It will ask if you want to replace. say yes.

In the CRACK folder is a cracked EXE file - all you need to do after you install it, is replace the EXE. file with the CRACKED EXE. file. 

Thats what cracks usually are kids - the EXE. file. You need to replace the one that gets installed with the one in the CRACK folder and yes dipshit, select REPLACE or OVERWRITE "

Best DAW on the Market IMO. Best, low letency engine out of all DAW's, dunno about Pro Tools. Blows Sonar out of the water. It has an internal wave editor which 9 of 10 other DAW's do not have.

Audition, again, is likely the best DAW incorporating far more features than anything else ive seen. I was making stellar mixes in one month ~ its rediculously easy to use."
,scott_ehm,2009-12-08T05:19Z,"This is far from being the best DAW on the market. I used to use it  back in the day before it became obsolete (when Adobe acquired it). Yes, the wave editor is cool, but as a DAW it fails. Into recording midi? Stay away from this as the latency is crazy stupid. Sonar is way more stable, more midi friendly, more VST compatible than this relic. I know you want to help but keep your piehole shut if you're out of your league.

You mentioned Sonar, but Sonar had native VST and VSTi support + ASIO support way long back before Audition did. Audition better than Cubase???. C'mon!, Steinberg INVENTED VST and VSTi. I'm not here to bash Audition when I'm about to download it, but let's be serious. Audition is a good editor and mp3 compressor, but besides that it can only be a starter for amateur project musicians recording their first multitrack projects. Other downsides of Audition to mention is that it's way heavier on CPU and RAM than Cubase or even Sonar, therefore less responsible, even when using ASIO. Adobe bought this software not to make the best DAW in the market (There are dedicated companies for that), but to add a sound editor and multitrack to their products. It's even funnier when you think that Audition was the LAST DAW to introduce ASIO support and VST support, so I guess buyers of this product back then should have felt scammed when they compared to Cubase or Sonar. By the way, Reaper also kicks Audition's ass. I'm just getting this cause it's a good editor and mp3 compressor, nothing more."

,05nath01,2010-05-21T17:16Z,"thats cos you are not supposed to use the installer after files are extracted, you just copy the crack into that folder and move it to programme files - at least thats what i understood.

i havnt finished the process yet so i cant say anything really..."
,05nath01,2010-05-21T17:20Z,"actually i think im wrong - ill try a diff aproach, hope it works!"
,bibo116,2010-07-18T13:04Z,"If you've got an issue with the sharedcontrols.dll file, download it here: http://www.down-dll.com/index.php?file-download=sharedcontrols.dll and extract it in the root folder of Audition."
,JCIce,2010-07-30T15:31Z,"Files are clean, and it works as it should."
,ctg867,2010-08-06T23:16Z,"i'm getting the sharedcontrols.dll error, and i have no idea what to do with this crack file. all these people giving a vague, condescending, one sentence response to this problem is helping absolutely no one. how about giving some actual help rather than being a snarky ass hole?"
,GodlyUploads,2010-08-20T00:17Z,"@ctg

google a download for the .dll download, the links even been posted in a few comments above yours. As for the crack,

1. Extract-Install
2. Copy crack into install dir      
3. Apply 

Enjoy and keep seeding everyone!"
,poorguy2,2010-08-21T22:49Z,"don't worry about shared controls. Just delete the short cuts and then go to the folder named crack, copy that file. Then go to my computer, C:, adobe, and then the adobe audition folder. Once your in there, paste the crack file in there. It will ask if you want to replace existing, click yes. once that is finished, double click the pasted file and you should be good to go. Yes i agree everyone has been pretty vague."
,poorguy2,2010-08-21T22:53Z,You don't need the shared controls file if you install it correctly. Run the installation file. Delete the shortcuts. then You have to copy and past the crack file into C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Audition 3.0. When it asks to replace existing click yes. Once it's finished than you just double click that icon you just pasted in there and you should be good to go. I was getting the same error message untill i did this.
,ashambler,2010-08-27T22:20Z,"I have installed it, and cracked. When i klick the icon, then it says that "" Adobe Audition could not find as supported audio device. Please check your device settings."" 
What to do?"

,freshtex,2010-10-11T18:04Z,"First Off, i'll like to thank you ""FiNsTeRc"" for a job well done, i have Cool Edit Pro & AA 1&2, this new version is really the bomb, installs fine cracks easy, & works great, you didn't have to put up this torrent but you did, so thank you again, this program costs $99 for an upgrade from 2 & $349 for the full version on Adobe's site. http://www.adobe.com/products/audition/"
,ukbull83,2010-12-17T02:58Z,"works 100%, just install like any other program, when thats done go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Audition 3.0, drag the crack app file into this folder and click move and replace option and its done.

you will only get the sharedcontrols.dll error if you try to start the program before you crack it.

thanks FiNsTeRc."

,Pepparkaksmuffins,2011-01-09T18:15Z,"First of all. Thanks fore the torrent, FiNsTeRc!

Although, I need help. :S

I did as told...

1. Ran ""Audition3_EFGJSI_Trial.exe"" and selected the Adobe-folder under c:\Program
2. Deselected ""Start Adobe Audition 3.0 Trial Installer"" from the ""udition3_EFGJSI_Trial.exe""-install window and selected ""Open the stated map"" (c:\Program\Adobe) instead... and clicked ""Finish""
I explore 12 files: 1031.mst, 1033.mst, 1034.mst, 1036.mst, 1040.mst, 1041.mst, Abcpy.ini,adbsetup.cfg,Audition 3.0 Setup.exe, components.msi, Data1.cab and instmsiw.exe. But NO Audition.exe-file that all says i should replace with the cracked in the ""Crack""-folder! (???)

3. Then i run ""Audition 3.0 Setup.exe"" (There is no else setup-file)! and have to select language. After clicking Ok an install window appers for a very short time and nothing els happens. 

There is still no ""Audition.exe""-file in the folder.

I even downloaded the SharedControls.dll from http://www.down-dll.com/index.php?file-download=sharedcontrols.dll and put it in the installed folder c:\Program\Adobe\Adobe Audition 3.0 as @bibo116 hinted. 

But then i get the errormessage: ""Unable to find procedure startadress ?GetItemRect@CToolbarCtrl@@QAE_NIPAUtagRECT@@@Z in DLL-file SharedControls.dll""


(I run WinXP Pro (x32) Sp3, with Admin rights)

Please help!

,djgyz,2011-03-23T18:49Z,This shared controls dll is shite it doesnt work ive spent the whole day installing and reinstalling ive downloaded 3 different versions of the crack all with no joy someone needs to listen to what were saying!!!!!!
,raiderette,2011-10-19T00:12Z,"Umm the link provided for the .dll file... there's nowhere to download it. Every time I click ""Download free of charge"" it takes me back to the same page. "
,adensdaddy2011,2011-11-10T00:51Z,i highly recommend putting the crack into a .rar or .zip. this way you always have the crack if needed. also you can extract it directly to the program file where it needs to be placed. But thanx for the awesome Torrent. not only does it work. It fixed a prob in my registry from a previous version that did not come with the uninstaller. NOPE really knows what they are doing THANX GUYS
,adensdaddy2011,2011-11-10T00:55Z,thanks For a great torrent guys. I highly recommend putting the crack into a .rar or .zip. this way you will always have it if needed. Not only does this torrent work perfectly it also fixed a prob in my registry from a previous install of the program that did not include the uninstaller. NOPE really knows what theyre doing. THANX GUYS. 
,Tyfer666,2011-11-14T06:57Z,"I can't help but wonder why the people that create these torrents don't make video tutorials to show users EXACTLY HOW to work the files. There are so many comments from people who have not the first idea of what they are doing with these torrents, and so many people thinking they are explaining the process with just 3 or 4 sentences. I'd imagine it would help a great deal, plus create more users downloading the uploader's torrent. Sheesh"
,edx500,2012-03-07T05:45Z,"Got it to work!-For those having problems just be sure to read thru the comments. There is a lot of chaff here.

Paste the audition.exe into the audition folder under programs-delete the desktop shortcut-create a new one from the cracked audition.exe.

You can now open the program. Seems to be working fine. I opened it 3 times and messed around with it a little bit.

I'm using this for editing and mp3 conversions"
