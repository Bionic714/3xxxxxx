This is a torrent that collects most of my music that I have released on the internet since I assumed the handle kjwise (1997).

I was originally active in the tracker scene (sub part of the demo scene).
I used to hang out on #trax and enjoy making music and listen to other peoples music all the time. Those were the days before mp3s.

Since then times have changed and music distribution has changed, and my life has changed. I am not as active in releasing new music, however I am still quite active in making it, I just never bother to finish anything at the same rate I did when I was younger.

Anyhow, it is time to try out the torrent way of distributing music legally, since I am its author by rights, and see how things go.
