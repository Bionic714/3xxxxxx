,mickmo,2009-04-14T22:30Z,"So what?s the point for the password?  It?s fucking stupid it works, but it?s still fucking stupid.  Unlike other people I will seed despite the stupid fucking password. "
,aksierrtyy,2009-04-17T23:20Z,The game  had virus on somewhere.
,Trailer,2009-04-18T00:01Z,"For those of you that get the virus-warning. If your virus-program is warning you about the file GMOD10[final].exe or something like that, just put it in the virus vault.

Next step is to create a shortcut to HL2.exe. Rightclick the shortcut and click properties. In the ""Target"" box it should say something like 
X:\games\Garrys Mod\hl2.exe
Add to the end of that:
-steam -console -appid 4000 -game ""garrysmod""...hl2.exe.open

The result should be
X:\games\Garrys Mod\hl2.exe -steam -console -appid 4000 -game ""garrysmod""...hl2.exe.open

You should be good to go now."
