It took me ages to program this disk and to get the cd key and the oembios files along with the drivers
So please seed even if its just for a few hours."
,leviticuz,2007-11-18T09:26Z,"Who gives a fuck if you seed it or not, IT DOESNT WORK anyway. Ohh and btw nice job trolling my torrents just to bitch about one having a ""Virus Trojan"". Seriously, which one is it, a virus or a trojan? and also where is your proof?"
,JannisB0y,2007-11-28T03:03Z,"Will this work on my HP Compaq NX6325 laptop?

I have problems when I'm trying to install from XP Pro OEM cd.  I have the serial branded under my laptop. The laptop came without XP cd... So I guess I have to buy a ned OEM license if this release you have not working :P"
,johnalddrama,2008-01-04T19:42Z,"So, i have a Compaq Presario 512MB RAM, 64mb graphic Card memory etc etc

And it's now installed with Xp Ultimate which was a bit heavy for that old computer.

So my question is, can i just format the computer witht this disk, erasing all other old stuff and replacing it with your XP pro Compaq Edition?!"
,xpsp3,2008-12-17T07:21Z,"how does this one compare to the newer HP-Compaq XP SP3?  I just downloaded the  other one, and will try it soon.  

Looking forward to the Acer XP edition.  Can u make a XP SP3 Pro version?  The Acer Aspire i use now is a 7520-5757 with Vista, runs real slow, but has a Dolby Digital Live speaker system, and I would need the correct audio driver for that."
,mrizzo2,2011-08-15T15:12Z,too bad there isnt a seeder on this for the past while - Ill find one to post if this isnt available in the next while. thanks TechJunkie for your efforts at previously making this available anyways.
,mrizzo2,2011-08-20T15:15Z,"Thanks for the download which completed last nite finally. I did share 150% along the way - all the way in fact. If the two peers that tried to complete are still around, I'll be happy to see you through - both reached approx 50% before seeming to have abandoned hope of a quick completion. I never leave behind a Dutch or British peer if I can help it and that's who they were. Cheers!
