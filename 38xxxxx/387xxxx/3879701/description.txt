Mattafix Living!

Mattafix will release their second album Rhythm & Hymns on November 12. Recorded between UK & Johannesburg, it will be the follow-up to Signs Of A Struggle, released in 2005. The duet will perform on October 17 in Paris.

Remember Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Big City LifeÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½, the first hit of the duet Mattafix, charted in France & everywhere in Europe. To keep sensitive public opinion & to be part of the worldwide campaign, the 2 Londonians Marlon Roudette & Preetesh Hirji recenlty recorded Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Living DarfurÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½, and the video was shot in July at the East of Chad. This video was the first to be shot there by an English-speaking artist. The single was welcomed by people (Will.I.Am, Mark Knopfler, Matt Damon & Don Cheadle) and will be released on October 22. Benefits will be reversed to NGO working in Darfur. source letssingit.com
