,Wiktorion,2007-11-03T23:49Z,"Works fine to install, but I get a error message when trying to start - something about the wrong disc inserted. Any help?"
,hanshardy,2007-11-04T10:57Z,"it seems that the crack is not working.
others have better luck?"
,Motta3,2007-11-19T20:56Z,What file is the crack file? cant find it. Pls help
,magpie2005,2008-01-27T21:36Z,"OK so here we go again, yet another fucking bunch of idiots who are not endearing themselves to the general public and newcomers in general with a torrent that had absolutely no fucking instructions whatsoever.

UNRAR - is that it???  For fucks man what happens when you unrar - you get a couple of files, .bin and .cue.... yippee now I can install... install what for fucks sake.... there's nothing there to install.....

Not everyone has a combination of masters degrees mind reading and computer technology... if you want good comments and good seeders.... leave some  fucking instructions man....

If you want people to seed then you have to rememebr the first thing they are going to do is download and try to use the torrent before seeding.  When they come across stuff like this with no fucking instructions they are going to delete and not seed which goes toatlly against what we are trying to do here."
,mercury38,2008-02-06T00:24Z,"For anyone whoe doesn't understand what to do
1 - unrar the files using winrar
2 - burn the image with imgburn or any other image burning program
3 - install from menu
4 - copy the file from Reloaded folder on disc to install directory, ir will ask if you want to replace file,click 'YES'
5 - et voila when you click on file the game WILL! load and play....i have done this and it DEFINATELY works  "
,sevenout,2008-02-12T09:17Z,"Don't approve of the tone or the language of magpie, but agree with the sentiment. Followed download path, but unable to extract game even with mercury's help. Something missing?
Only second time doing this, so a little prompting wouldn't go amiss."
,Gradis,2008-02-20T17:32Z,"soz but the instructions were confusing but this does work.

Heres my guide. idiot proof, i hope

1. Download
2. Unzip, rar etc one of the files. I dont know why their are loads of them but there you go.
3. You need to burn the file rld-cm08 onto a cd. If you have burning software just clicking it should do it.
4. Install the game.
5. On the CD there is a folder called RELOADED. Open and copy that CM.exe into the file you installed the game into. Click yes to overwrite.
6. Away you go.

7. And say thanks to He0n for doing it. Cheers Butt :)"
,superboer810,2008-03-27T16:01Z,thanks mercury38 and gradis for your explanation!!
,cybersausage,2008-04-10T17:50Z,"hey guys just unzipped the file but its just a bin file and a cue file how do i open them? and when burning it to a disc wot format should i make the disk i.e. data, dvd, wot? tanx"
,dswood1,2008-04-16T01:40Z,"top man heon, top instructions too Gradis"
,shadowclause,2008-04-29T13:06Z,You open the cue file extracted from the rar file using daemon tools or any other programs for mounting
,jonas1986,2008-06-02T18:04Z,"I unrared the files, with winrar. Then there was a folder named rld-cm08, I opened it up and found two files with that name. one bin-file, and one cue-file. I burned the binfile 'cause it was a big matter of size them between, but nothing happend, and wich file do you mean I am suppose to install. Cant find any?"
,AndreiCM,2008-07-05T23:51Z,"I'm new to this. First of all, how do you unzip the file? Secondly, how do you burn the file onto a CD? Just insert a CD and then paste the file onto the CD? "
,AndreiCM,2008-07-12T17:11Z,"Ok, so i copied the rld-cm08 file (file, not winrar archive that is) onto a CD. Now what? Nothing happens when I insert the CD."
,henrik4242,2008-08-02T15:43Z,"You need to burn it as an image-file (iso). If you burn it as data, the computer doesn't understand the info basically. Try again and it will work. "
,soynot,2008-08-06T20:01Z,It works superbly.  Installed without a hitch and runs very smoothly.  Thanks to the Upper :)
,Ac_blenda,2008-09-11T14:35Z,"Right. This crack works a treat but I can see how people may be confused as to how to set it up. Here's how i did it;

1. use daemon tools to mount the 'rld-cm08.cue' which is located in the downloaded Championship manager folder. Note: the correct file is in fact the only file that will show up in the daemon tools mount browser.

2. as soon as you mount the file, windows will ask you whether you want to run setup or explore the folder. Here you should run the setup.

3. Once setup has complete, go back into daemon tools and unmount the file. then, straight away remount it again, only this time instead of selecting 'run setup', you should select explore folder.

4. In this folder you will find a sub-directory called 'reloaded' which contains a file called 'CM2008.exe'. Copy this file.

5. Then go to the folder where you installed the game. I beleive the default address is something like C:\Program Files\Eidos\championshipmanager08 or whatever.

6. Paste the copied file (CM2008.exe) into this folder. You will then be asked if you want to replace the existing file of the same name which resides there already. click yes (replace).

And thats it. Game cracked.
Now all you have to do is double click the new CM2008.exe icon and Bob's your uncle.

Also; this is one of those nice cracks which once installed does not require a key to run so you can close down daemon tools to save CPU. Not that a game like Championship manager is going drain your CPU anyway but its nice to know.

Note: There are other ways to set this crack up involving different programs and the use of CD-R's. I have only chosen this way because i don't have any blank CD's but to be fair i think this way is just as good as any other.

Enjoy the game. And don't be Man Utd. Its as good as cheating"

,Grant81,2009-01-02T14:32Z,"Ac Blenda, thanks for going to the bother of writing out those instructions, makes it simple for noobs like me that don't have a clue what they are doing."
,greeny25,2009-04-16T15:05Z,hi this is my fisrt time downloading a game i have rite the 2 ways you have put to make the game work i have winrar will that be ok thanks.
