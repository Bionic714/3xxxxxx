"We Have Explosive", released in 1997, is a digitized thrash metal explosion of big beat drums, mono-tone basslines, aggressive guitar stabs, insane robotic voices and clinical electric beeps. The successful standout single from FSOL's Dead Cities LP got an extended remix treatment on this nine-part opus EP. It is a harder, more techno-orientated song, rare for FSOL.
