Thanks!"
,KingKongFetus,2009-01-31T18:28Z,Vai is amazing. He records and produces everything himself. One of the best guitar players to ever live. Amazing to watch him play. If you still think Jimi Hendrix is the best guitar player who ever lived... broaden your horizons and listen to Vai.... seriously.
