,NeoEndymnion,2007-11-14T20:16Z,"I got this and HL2 runs great, but Garry's Mod took more than 45 minutes to install, and it won't work. I get an error when I try it. Anyone know how to fix this? I'd love to try this thing out.

It shows the load screen, then it gives me an Application error. Says it can't read the HL2 exe as follows: 

 'The instruction at 0x0f883e2c referenced memory at 0x0d59a1a0. The memory could not be ""read""

Anyone know how to fix this?"

,swgeek10056,2008-12-12T19:13Z,"bendin and blakeboy shut up, i've tried just about every gmod torrent here, most dont work, but i heard this one had gmod 11.. anyway they dont have viruses, that's just your stupid oversensitive antivirus scanners cuz the program you're installing is ACTING like a virus, but it isnt one. actually its not even acting like one. it does things similar to a virus, so your scanner will say its a virus. ANYWAY here i am with most of em, and virus free. OK?"
,swgeek10056,2008-12-12T19:15Z,"sorry for double post, but i re-read bendkin's post and i would like to say i'm sorry i misread it. i thought he ONLY copied and pasted what blakeboy had written. (BTW SEEDERS PLZ)"

,Gamer_92,2009-02-20T18:53Z,Anyone knows where I can get Gmod 11 ? Please I really want Gmod 11
,Kushie,2009-06-09T01:18Z,"1) There's no such thing as Gmod 11. Don't look for it.

2) I really suggest you guys buy this game. I know some of you just want to 'try it out' and maybe buy it if you will play it a lot, but really, they're great games and Valve deserves the money you get for them. GMod is $10 and HL2 is (at this time) $15."
,emoluv189,2009-08-24T12:39Z,What do you do with the ISO file?
,HARD11,2009-12-11T15:36Z,"download daemon tools and mount image the iso file, my english=shit, sry:D"
