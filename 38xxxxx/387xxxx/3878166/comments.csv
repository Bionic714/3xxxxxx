,BangaliP,2010-01-25T01:57Z,"Move your fucking butts and seed this torrent god fucking dammit you dirty philippino scumbags!

How the hell i am supposed to download 8.2gigs with 11 seeders and 41 leechers?
I'm getting only 15kb/s.

I would buy this season,i'm not a cheap fucker like you,but guess what,this season is unavailable everywhere due to lack of stock!

FUCK!"

,RivieraDude,2010-05-21T04:12Z,"Someone who rants out like you BangaliP shouldnt deserve to be dl'ing anything anywhere.
Be greatful that you get it at all and give thanks to the humble few that shares this with you.
15kb/s , you should look at it as serenity coming your way at last, dont't stress yourself up dude, it's not worth it.
On some few occasion I waited a few months to get the much desired disc to download completely. Was it worth it, yes absolutely.
So many thanks to you who let us share the great uploadings that you do for us to download.
And mongrels like BangaliP is like a flies crap in the end, useless and utterly meaningles."
