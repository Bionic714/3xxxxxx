"Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?" In 1960, prosecutor Mervyn Griffith-Jones tried to persuade an Old Bailey jury to ban DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover.

All the details of the trial are on record. Except for what the jury said, thought... and did.

Andrew Davies' new drama offers a fictional account of the jurors' experience. It is seen through the eyes of Keith (Rafe Spall) and Helena (Louise Delamere), two of the jurors who fall in love under the influence of Lawrence's prose.
