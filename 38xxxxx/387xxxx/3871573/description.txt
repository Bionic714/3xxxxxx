Shorts Belfast

With a maximum takeoff weight of 230,000 lb, the Belfast was one of the largest turboprop aircraft ever built. Designed as a strategic freighter, its range and speed were however rather poor. The first Belfast was delivered to 53 Sqn. Transport Command in Jan. 1966. Ten served with the RAF, they were all withdrawn in 1976, with four continuing to operate with the HeavyLift Cargo Airlines, operating out of London-Stanstead. HeavyLift ceased trading in September 2002. All airframes were scrapped except for G-HLFT (sold to Australian company Jan 03) and one preserved at a UK museum.
