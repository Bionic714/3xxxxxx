,preacherraven,2007-12-04T20:34Z,The singer is Jon English (who plays Jonathan Garrett). I had the soundtrack once on vinyl...
,uffesnuffe,2008-10-21T00:46Z,The video quality is not very good. I had expected much better with 600 MB per 50 minutes episode. Perhaps this is not a DVD rip? Some artefacts at the picture boundaries suggest that it might be a VHS rip.
