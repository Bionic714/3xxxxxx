5 is the fifth studio album by Lenny Kravitz, released in May 1998.

In the production of the album, Lenny worked with digital technology sounds such as synthesizers and tape loops providing the album with better modern sound. The album contained more of his 70's inspired songs, funk and soul, mixed with his rock style.

"5", more than being named due to Lenny's fifth release, was for its religious significance and the meaning of a new beginning, after facing, for example, his mother's death, whom he dedicated the featured song, "Thinking Of You".
