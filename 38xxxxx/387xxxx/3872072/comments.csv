So all you veterans here - I appreciate your patience with the 'greenies' like me but I would love to contribute but lack the skills to crack and stuff like that. So if you have suggestions on how I can contribute - the obvious part so far seems to be to 'seed' but if there is anything else - please let me know. Thanks to all of you who put tons of content on here - I tip my hat to you dudes and appreciate your efforts and dedication.  "
