,gothambats,2008-01-04T10:48Z,"Hey Subzero! I got as far as downloading z7 and uncompressing your file! Awesome crazy stuff man! But this is where I'm suck. I read the note you adeed about moving the file to a place without you NIC. I decompressed the file to my desktop and I see the files, but I'm not quite sure what to do install. I dont see an exe file. I'm new to this style of playing games. This is my first time every even hearing of Z7. Could you help me out. I really, really want to play this game. Thanks Subzero."
