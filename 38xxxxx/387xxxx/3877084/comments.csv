,kingtiger2008,2008-07-09T09:06Z,hI GUYS IT HAS PASSWORD AND I FOUND IT ...PLZ WRITE BACK IF THIS WORKING : songcity.org
,ghostfish1975,2009-11-14T16:34Z,"Right, i have another way round this, and this has worked for me. Im posting this cos i fucking hate dickheads who password huge rar files.

Get yourself a old copy of winrar (im using 3.7 beta2). This might work on more modern versions of winrar, ive not tired it.

Winrar unzips your file to a temp directory in appdata in your users folder (in vista/win7, its C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Temp to a folder something like ""Rar$DR00.860"". 
While unraring, just look for the latest modified folder. As soon as the file finishes unraring, it checks the password, finds its wrong and deletes your iso right away. So do this:

1) Start Unrar with any password, and while its unraring (pause the unrar if necessary), go find this folder. You should see the file in there (""sr-mw2a.iso"" or b.iso). 
2) Wait till you unrar is near the end (98,99%), DONT LET IT END!!!, Pause it!!!
3) now go back to the folder and use explroer to COPY the file from there to any other folder (desktop for instance).
4) IMPORTANT : WHILE IT IS COPYING, UN-PAUSE the unrar and let it finish.
5) When unrar finishes you will get the usual wrong password error, but it CANT delete the file because its locked by windows while it copies to your desktop!!!!. 
6) when the copy to desktop finishes, just close (i had to kill it from taskmanager) winrar. 
7) Enjoy!!!

Like i said, this worked for me and i have an old version of winrar. This security flaw might be fixed in more recent versions though. If your unsure, try with the second disk rar first as its much smaller and wont take as long."
,ghostfish1975,2009-11-14T17:06Z,"Although now i have the files unrar'ed, ive discovered they are not Call of Duty ISO images, but a pile of crap :("
,Flanker101,2011-05-02T01:15Z,"Why can I not join Multiplayer and SinglePlayer?

Downloaded though, no passwords that I could find at least. But any info on this would be great."
