Synopsis:
Now, from the director of The Devil's Advocate comes Blood In Blood Out - a critically acclaimed modern-day epic. Within the rich and colorful Chicano culture of East Los Angeles, three cousins raised as brothers fiercely live by a generations-old tradition of family - power stronger than law.. a force deeper than friendship. In one life-shattering moment, the trio is torn apart, forcing them to follow three separate paths. One searching for truth in the law. One expressing his passion through art. And one finding power in prison. Yet, through it all, family and honor keep their lives intertwined as each strives for survival and power !
