Rock Against Howard is an Australian compilation CD released in 2004. The music on the release is politically orientated, with the style of music varying widely, with punk rock, alternative, hip-hop and even music most resembling show tunes.

It features musicians who are opposed to the Liberal-National coalition government.The bands contained in the compilation are considered by the Liberal-Nationals to be out of touch with "reality", despite their far-reaching influence on the youth of Australia.

Rock Against Howard was organised by Frenzal Rhomb guitarist Lindsay McDougall, when he realised every musician he knew felt the same way about John Howard. It was inspired by the American Rock Against Bush compilations and take a similar format.
