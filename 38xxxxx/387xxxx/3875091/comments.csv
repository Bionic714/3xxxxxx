- Good morning.

4
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,331
Give me some.

5
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,756
It's been three days.
Maybe he's mad at me.

6
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:11,089
But you called and said
you would stay here, no?

7
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:14,825
Yes, but I'm thinking maybe
it's time to tell him about us.

8
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,904
I think he will accept it fine.

9
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:20,769
You think?"
