""Are you a tool? Check yes or no"""
,scottiemafia,2007-11-05T03:00Z,"Meh, as if anyone watches this stuff for the dialogue anyway.

Although yes, I am still waiting for a decent English version."

,andro172,2007-11-07T18:55Z,"Stop saying that^^
French is nice, but hard to learn
Thnaks for this great movie, the quality could have been better
Cessez de dire cela^^
Français est agréable, mais dur d'apprendre :P
Merci pour le grand film, la qualité aurait pu être meilleure"
,anthoprotic,2007-11-09T03:36Z,"Tu crois que le français est difficile? C'est une question que je qualifierais d'ambigüe!

**You think french is difficult? I think this question is ambiguous!**

Well... not hard when it's your 1st language ;)

Thanks for this movie, haven't seen it yet but i'm hoping for good quality!"
,anthoprotic,2007-11-09T03:36Z,"P.S:

Download @ 400 Kbits/s, pretty well!"
,TokiWartooth,2007-11-15T21:06Z,"i like how this has been downloaded thousands of times with absolutely no one commenting as to quality, or offering screenshots.

,bolt2,2007-11-25T14:30Z,Is this dubbed French or just subtitles?
,fox20th,2007-11-29T14:40Z,"french or not for english people look for subtitles
français ou pas pour les anglophones cherché les sous-titres.
merci pour le film"
,iluvwhtchix,2007-12-07T14:21Z,This is pure SHIT! Don't waste your time with this. It's so dark and blurry you'll want to reach through the internet and break this idiot's face that uploaded this crap.
