Thanks"
,ravenheart1982,2007-11-11T14:57Z,"Why not just download it here like everyone else? The size makes no difference and it'll be quicker here.

Is this an audience recording or a pro one? What's the source?"
,sspasov,2007-11-11T21:40Z,It's an audience recording.
,xitach,2007-11-17T20:03Z,How is the quality? video and sound
,sspasov,2007-11-19T20:33Z,"The video is made with a Sony miniDV camera. Seems fine for a amateur video. :)
Do not expect perfect DVD quality and sound."
,costam_23,2008-02-02T02:21Z,"I have 100% of it, but my files on hard drive have 2.92 GB, not 3.73 GB, and that dvd have lot bugs when i tring play, is it fake or what ? U people dont have problems with this ? Maybe my download has failed :/  "
,sspasov,2008-04-03T12:22Z,"I suppose you have some failed fragments while downloading. The DVD should play perfect, but keep in mind that it was made with a personal cam, not professional record."
