How to convert AC3 to wav?"
,StrangeBones,2009-11-14T17:28Z,"Yeah, Honesteagle, I would do that if I had your habits (and your mother).  
My wife bought the special edition DVD version for me for my birthday, but it's impossible for me to get past the encryption so I can burn a CD to play in my CD players, even if I play it into Sound Forge, convert to mp3, then reconvert during the burn, and that's ridiculous.  So, I feel justified, at least a little, in downloading one album from my favorite band, 3 guys I was on stage with in the mid 1970s (Zembo Mosque Shrine Temple, Harrisburg, PA).  

And what the what are you doing here anyway (""Honest Eagle""!), other than harassing people?  Go mount an anti-downloading campaign and be part of your own ""solution"", not our ""problem"".  

If this message goes over your head, suffice it to say, ""Suck it!"" 

Now, to DeThPhase, THANK YOU!!!"
