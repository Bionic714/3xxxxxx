Okay. Here I go trying out the tracker here with the complete, revised translated, HQ version of Tsukino Jyougi's classic "Flat 37 Degrees C".

This is a revised version (I just said that) by Humpty and your's truly.


Humpty released a MQ version of Chapter 7 & 8 on another forum last weekend. I'm currently torrenting the HQ version of those chapters this weekend, along with the complete manga.

Please enjoy! And many thanks to those who help seed!
