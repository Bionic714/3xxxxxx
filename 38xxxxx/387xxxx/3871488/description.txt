Supermarine Swift FR.5

The Supermarine Swift was the first British production aircraft to have swept wings and tailplanes. Essentially a revision of the Supermarine Attacker, the type evolved through several marques, eventually arriving at the FR.5, which was the most numerous. Incorporating tricycle gear and an afterburning engine, this aircraft held the world speed record for a scant 24 hours, when it was again broken by the Douglas F4D Skyray. The FR.5 utilised a "sawtooth" leading edge on the main wing (adding stability at high angles of attack) and remained operational until the summer of 1961. A later development, the FR.7, was adapted to the reconnaissance role, with a dozen of these being produced.
