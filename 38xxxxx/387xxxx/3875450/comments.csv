,mrbb,2007-11-06T15:35Z,Er...shouldn't this be in porn?
,RubberTow,2007-11-06T17:19Z,"No, because it isn't porn. Should videos of shirtless men be labeled porn? If this should be labeled porn than every male who takes off his shit in public should be arrested for indecent exposure. They show stuff like this on French prime time tv, ferchipesakes. Mrbb, you are with little doubt a no-dick, reamed out asshole prude from the U.S. "
,RubberTow,2007-11-06T20:23Z,"NOTE TO DOWNLOADERs: you need the Divx Player installed to play this file in either Windows Media Player or the Divx Player (I'm opretty sure anyway, it is hard to tell because I have Divx installed and cannot test playability without it) because it had to have Divx-created menus in order to put the six .wmv files togther into a single file. If you have the Divx Player, then it will play in either the Divx player, the Windows Media Player. also, I think that it will play by itself in the VLC player because it was openable with the VLC and I didn't see any Divx programs open to assist like I did with Windows Media Player- RUBrTOE"
,TazzyUK,2007-12-27T03:04Z,"'mrbb'...lolol How can you call this porn.
Just by the description only (as i haven't seen the video yet) how on earth can you label this porm?

,ikilledsanta,2008-07-09T08:10Z,"By that logic, it should be acceptable for a young girl to show her tits...young boys can take off their shirts, can't they?

It does belong in porn. Porn is ""creative activity (writing or pictures or films etc.) of no literary or artistic value other than to stimulate sexual desire "". I doubt this movie is of artistic value. Now, stop jumping on Americans because your country makes less than a fifth of the GDP ours does.

What is it that makes you hate the US so much? I mean, you come on TPB and criticize an entire nation over something extremely trivial, without the slightest provocation. And yet, I have little doubt that you watch our movies, eat at our restaurants, and shop at our stores.

All this hate, and after we bailed you out in WW2. Maybe it's just left over hate from 1783 and 1815? Hell, if we're such a terrible country, come over here and let us kick your ass again!"
,Mat2001uk,2008-11-20T11:36Z,ikilledsanta you've got one Serious chip on your shoulder there pal! Maybe you should un-ruffle your pantyhose or something...
,Hoobajoob,2012-02-08T05:09Z,"Yes, ikilledsanta, this IS porn and you are going to burn forever in hellfire for watching it!  I'm not going to get into what awaits you for doing what we all know you're doing while you're watching it!

(Hey, RubberTow...where did you find this and do you have any more?  This was a fun one!  Thanks!)"
