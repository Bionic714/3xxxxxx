,Victorious69,2007-11-08T21:34Z,")-:)  I usually Check all tracks before,i upload them but for this one,Mr. Lazy took control..
      And Guess what.... song 6&7 Have a little (stub,blup,blob) in the begining,it's just a half       

      second long,but if you are maniac & listen to the music you love,this small bug will make
      a difference. I felt concerned to warn future downloaders, because there were so many
     times i've downloaded , crap,low quality & fakes,that i swear to my self  ""I will never 
     share bad quality stuff !!!,and now i failed! I'm angry with myself .
     I learned the lesson : ""Check before upload"" Thanks Mr. Lazy.
     Soooooorrrrrrryyyyyyy........ !This was the first & the last !  (:-(
