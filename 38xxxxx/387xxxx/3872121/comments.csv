,dttnbguy,2007-11-04T23:39Z,"any1 got a review of this?

cant find one and i dont just wanna DL this blindely"
,Pilaarbijter,2007-12-23T18:09Z,"I can't find the crack folder about which you talked in your readme file. I have checked all the rar's that were in this torrent and the only thing that were in all of them was an iso file...

Please help, I really would like to play this game :s"
,kaiguy57,2008-01-20T12:05Z,"The rar's essentially act as one giant compression file broken into bite-sized files for transfer. Open any one, extract the iso and mount it with daemon tools or whatnot. The crack directory is ON the iso, so it must be mounted (or burned) first."
,fallout11,2008-01-31T12:22Z,"Nice game, great rip.  Lotta' fun, and works fantastically.  Thanks!

For the crack, remember that there is always gamecopyworld.com and similar....."

,FFTL,2008-05-11T04:37Z,"IM SO CONFUSED!
Ive been trying to figure this out for hours! (im a real noob at all this) ok ive succesfuly downloaded it and i open one of the ISO files into winRAR, i double click it and it starts extracting. it then says preparing to instal, it emediatly then flicks to Sonic RecordNow! it tells me that ""the features you are trying to use is on a unavalible network, enter an allternat path to a folder containing the installation package RNENU.msi I have no idea where it is ive tried everything!
please can someone guide me through the extracting and installing process?
i realy wana play the freking game lol"
,Manesero,2008-05-14T04:45Z,"Dang noobs. ;)

You don't OPEN iso files. You MOUNT iso files. WinRAR opens isos, but they're CD images. Google DaemonTools and mount the .iso
I haven't downloaded it yet, but I'm going to assume it's a normal release.
That means that the virtual drive that Daemon Tools made will now have a DVD in it. (That is, Windows Explorer will think there's a DVD player with a DVD in it.)
That DVD will more or less be exactly the same as the retail DVD, except there will be an additional crack directory in it. That's the thing you're looking for."
,FFTL,2008-05-16T07:35Z,"YOU LEGEND!
thanx heaps Manesero
"
,FFTL,2008-05-16T10:35Z,"ok its me again haha 
ive monted it and everything and downlaoded the game, it just keeps telling me i need to insert the right disk?
i think it may have something to do with the crack directory?
if so how do i find it???

many thanx guys :)"
,FFTL,2008-05-16T11:19Z,"OK OK OK

i found the crack! woo!
now what?
haha i click it and it says

this application has faild to start because OpenAL32.dll was not found. re-instaling the application may fix this problem.

so i re-instaled it and it still says it...

FUCK IM A NOOB

any help guys?"
,sharkfoot,2008-06-04T16:12Z,"FFTL, first, rename the .exe file in the game directory or cut it and paste it into a different directory.  Next, copy the crack file and paste it into the game directory to replace the original file that you renamed or cut from the directory.  When you click the icon from the game directory, that should work for you."
,SmartSamurai,2008-06-16T20:56Z,Hi so i uploaded it and i did what the readme file reads but when i try to play it says Wrong disc intrested so can some1 help?
,Kelthazar,2008-07-28T22:38Z,"Awesome Awesome Awesome!

Thanks so much works like a charm, wonderFULL!!!!

OK GUYS IF YOUR GETTING THE WRONG DISC INSERTED ERROR THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO!

1. Take out the Aventcast.exe file from the game directory that the files are installed in. Either rename it or delete it. 

2. Open the crack folder, take the .exe file from inside, and move it to where the original aventcast.exe file was. 

3. Run the game from the new crack file you just moved, itll start up normally.

ENJOY AND THANKS AGAIN!!!!"
,yan338,2008-08-18T17:12Z,"Thanks, works great.
A crack is not needed; just install the latest retail patch 1.04, it removes the protection."
,damunzy,2009-11-05T15:10Z,Official 1.04 patch which removes DRM: http://avencast.com/downloads/Avencast_patch_v104.exe
,theRealKarmine,2010-11-03T09:47Z,the next person who rar's an iso is going to get dickslapped.  installs are already fucking compressed so what is the point other than making shit corrupted?
,rajeevrn,2011-01-31T19:08Z,"great game .....works fine...every game ive commented on...works...
