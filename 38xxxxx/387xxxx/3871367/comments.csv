,robrecht,2007-11-20T00:24Z,"Damn, man!
No Jeru da Damaja, no Common, no LL Cool J, no Krs-One?:D
Yeah, your TOP100 sucks!
But maybe it's better you don't put the real hiphop online,
because otherwise all hiphop-legends would go broke!"
,Alith,2007-11-20T15:15Z,When momma said knock you out .. she was talking about you. This is junk.
,matthew_65,2007-11-21T01:51Z,no sugarhill gang 94)? what about public enemy... nwa? your one idiot with bad taste for music.. if you like rap its bad enough.. but if your missing the best?

,Flixation,2007-11-27T21:08Z,"haha, this s not hip hop, 50 fuckin cent and game, etc? haha thats just mainstream gansta shit I tell you. get some knowledge man!
fool"
,zailith,2007-11-28T20:40Z,flixation was dead on....this shit isn't hip hop. 'Top 100 Songs for the Wannabe Gangsta' would have been a better title. Unless of course you could somehow defend a claim that T.I. and Lil Wayne have made 10 of the top 100 rap songs of all time. 
,McWaz,2007-11-29T12:53Z,"Are you serious man? If you put together top 100 rap songs OF ALL TIMES, at least put some thought in to it.. You're embarressing yourself. "

,skanman14,2007-12-16T04:07Z,"youre missing immmortal technique rass kass, krs-1, big pun and a gang of others...a top 100 would also not be a top 100 if it had anything by 50 cent. go ask your mom to buy you some real music and get rid of this trash. chuuch."
,PXT0R0,2007-12-26T15:03Z,"YOU WANT HIP HOP? DONT GET IT FROM TPB, ALL THIS SHIT IS WHACK.....TRY TAPEDOWN.COM FOR THE LATEST MIXTAPES AND UNDERGROUND SHIT...THIS SHIT WAS MISLABELED AND SHOULD OF SAID ""MY"" TOP 100 RAP SONGS OF ALL TIME. IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT, BUT YOU INSULT BY THE TITLE. THERE ARE TOO MANY OUTSTANDING RAPS OUT...IT SHOULDVE BEEN TOP 1000."
,UBERACE,2008-01-09T18:48Z,"i agree with most of you guys.. whats up with this list? call it ""My personal top 100 rap song list"".. way too much crap on this list to call it top 100 of all time.. alternatively you could call the list: ""the 100 best rap songs ive ever heard on MTV.."" "
,ExEvil,2008-01-12T11:14Z,"I want to thank the creator of this list, it was definatly worth a chuckle. It was a pleasant suprise to see some Immortal Technique, but then I saw which track it was and had to stop reading to catch my breath. But seriously now, you should cut back on the flames, you know that ""Fremad"" is in 7th grade and can't be blamed for it."
,PETONEHS,2008-01-14T23:21Z,I want to thank you for your time and effort but this should be labelled top 100 commercial songs of all time.....

There is good rap and bad rap. The Beastie Boys is an example of good rap. See this video from the Beastie Boys:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDS83yrM30Y.

AzzKicKeR52 is just a lame ass poser who talks shit about stuff he doesn't know about."

 I Could go on, but I'm sure REAL HIP HOP fans know what I'm talking about. There's no way you could call a list ""All Time"" without including some of the absolute best of ALL TIME. How in the HELL do you pick D12 over Biggie?!! You must be New JAck!!!"
,killacam2,2008-11-12T02:39Z,"Normally I only comment on the quality of a torrent but, this is just inaccurate to claim these are the top 100 rap songs of all time. Most Top 100's etc are according to a certain source, i.e. Rolling Stone's Top 500 songs of all time; not MY personal top 100. You're list is trash, some tracks are good but you are an awful judge of top 100 rap songs of all time, educate yourself in the field."

,skanman14,2009-03-25T03:02Z,"i too feel the need to comment... ok heres the deal. people ask who killed hip hop people will argue and whine about it depending on the region. i think theres an argument to be made about wayne being partially responsible, but theres a counter argument as well. his body of work is massive and i hate it when people who are only familiar with the singles knock weezy. next. only one immoral technique? no tech n9ne? no MF Doom or aesop rock? digable planets? black sheep?

,TRsquared,2009-05-01T06:52Z,I've never commented before but after reading through this I realized how many ignorant people there are out there.  Maybe you dont agree with the title of the list but why take it as anything more than more music to add to the collection.  If all these artist you say should be on here are sooooo amazing and your soooooo into hip hop and rap then why do you need to download it.  Shouldn't you have it already??? Fucken posers that have nothing better to do than to rip up a person who took his/her time to upload music to share with us. Thanks for the upload i appreciate the uploaders willing to give there time with no expectations of anything in return. I will definately seed this for ya!  I might not be into everything on the list but none the less there are plent of good tracks on here and thats all that matters.
