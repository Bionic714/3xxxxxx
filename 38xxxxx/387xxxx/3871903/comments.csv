This ebook doesn't tell you jack. It just tries to steer you toward downloading their software.

Let me ask you, would you rather spend weeks trying to manually fix errors, or just get a tool that does it for you, automatically and with no hassle? Yeah, that's what I thought.

Quit crying."
,aciD420,2007-11-10T12:19Z,lol don't you just these marketing trolls.. just like a god damn car salesman.. tricky bastards... my best advice for anyone trying to fix their computer is to download nod32 and registry mechanic from here and do a full sweep and optimization with them and it'll be better than new... :)
,Bob__Dole,2007-11-27T15:07Z,"Don't ever try to ""fix"" something with software.  Make a full backup of the windows partition, put your data on another partition, and restore the system to the offline backup you made prior to the onset of the problem.

It is comprehensive security that kills many birds with one stone.

Software to fix a problem is like a joke, you're far better off just googling for the symptions of the problem than to let software further change things, meaning you may end up with several new problems.

This damn upload is spam."
