The Desert Graves_ Between our Heaven and Hell

This strange guys are influenced by such bands as Reverend Horton Heat , The Mummies , The Bassholes , Esquivel , Nick Cave , The Monsters , Blacktop , Arthur Lyman , The Cramps , The Pagans and many others, their style is very unique and could be described as something between Beat , Exotica , Surf , Rock\'n\'Roll but a very dark side of that. The songs of this album are mostly Instrumentals and some songs with pretty evil vocals, they use some exotic instruments to make their sound more hypnotique.
