Great torrent by the way, wonderful speed, wonderful seeds."
,Tomeus,2009-02-09T16:16Z,"LinuxUser2, Arial or MS Sans Serif are like Helvetica give or take few minor details. Or if you are planning on using these fonts on some official work you're doing, I suggest getting official fonts for that too, even if the prices are ridiculous ;)

Jakobost, I'm just DLing this atm so I can't say nothing of the content yet, but naturally if the font is mentioned it should be included."
