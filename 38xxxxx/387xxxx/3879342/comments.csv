,Stuft,2008-02-04T18:29Z,how do i use blindwrite to install the game
,Stuft,2008-02-27T14:30Z,"This is how you install: download blindwrite 6 mount the gears of war blindwrite image in deamon.
install and then mount the image again if it does not do it for you.
if you don't like blindwrite and uninstall it then just mount: gearsofwar.b6t.
if it keeps crashing go to options EVERY time you start it and press F2 to restore to default.
if you lose saves then create a profile."

,TCIND,2008-09-21T20:47Z,"Solved the ""Insert DVD problem""!

All it needed was a no-CD crack. A quick trip to gamecopyworld.com and a bit of browsing got me the proper crack. Open folder, take the setup.exe, and overwrite the same file in the game's program data. You guys know the drill.

This site should take you to the crack. Hope this helps!

has anyone found a solution to any of the problems?

The steps i followed were
1.Mount image with daemon tools
2.install from iso (FAILED)

1. Download Blindwrite6
2. Mount with Daemon Tools
3. Install from iso (FAILED

I've tried all the steps suggested but when i try to install from the dvd, it tells me ""the installation package could not be opened, please contact your vendor"". 

And when i coped the game directly from the DVD i started to get somewhere but then i get the modifed code error when i run the Wargame-G4Wlive.exe ( msidcrl40.dll: 

And now when i run the Startup.Exe i get the same error message. 

I reverted my date back to 2006/7/8/9 but i receive the same error for all of them, and because i can't install the game from the DVD updating with patches doesn't help because it can't locate where GOW is to update.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."
