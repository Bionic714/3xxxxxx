Unpack the RAR files. Install the game. Find game on C: drive and replace the game main icon (.exe file) with the one from the crack file. Simple as that and you are good to go!

Thanx Loder!"
,kyliecoast,2008-02-23T11:50Z,"Crack works when you copy the exe from the crack folder over the exe of the game.

(Silly me clicked on the exe in the crack folder, thinking it was a keygen and it generated all sorts of errors. To fix it, it required reboot of Vista as well as installing the game again, followed by the exe copy.)"
,ashe021182,2008-03-30T11:48Z,Works Great. i did the same thing I opened the crack folder thinking it was a key gen and had all sorts of problems. I extracted the files from the crack folder then went to Local Disk C: Program files  Mystery Case Files and replaced the main .exe Icon with the Icon from the crack folder. Copy and Paste that easy. :) Have Fun

,Dracamus,2010-08-02T08:03Z,"I installed and unpacked the crack but I still can't play, what is the extra file about? o matter what I do I get an error messege. Will someone please help?"
,KrudeX,2012-03-04T22:19Z,"You need to do a rightclick the shortcut in program files and run a compatibility error fixing thing :) Worked great after doing that... I believe running it with windows xp compatibility mode it works.. I just did it with the automatic program built in windows 7. (sorry for the grammar, i'm currently so tired so i'm not at my sharpest.)"
