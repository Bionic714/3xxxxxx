,E___-._.-___3,2007-11-07T18:08Z,"Sure, I'll up this for a while, at least a couple or three gig at 5-600 kBs - not using the bandwidth anyway.  Glad to help."
,Tronblue,2007-11-07T18:42Z,"This & other torrent boards are driven by ads and how many hits one gets per day avg. 
If TPB wanted people to visit this site for the ad dollars I'd imagine they could & should protect an asset to this board. 

aXXo is an asset to any torrent board, people trust his uploads and his name. 

The volume of traffic to this site will screech to a halt once aXXo starts releasing rips on other sites and leaving this one out. 

Wake up TPB. Protect uploaders & contributers from fakes/viruses & slander when possible. 
If you do nothing you invite or even condone these attacks.

I will also be looking into Mininova for my future rips."
,shoeshoe,2007-11-07T21:22Z,I'm pretty sure this is already well seeded under aXXo's own account.
,KKELTIKK,2007-11-07T22:20Z,"I am sure you are right, but i am supporting the newbies who may not know aXXo's where abouts, plus I am trying to support the torrent community, TPB in particular, its been good to me."
,ninjatracks,2007-11-08T16:37Z,axxo doesnt run tpb... he/she is just 1 uploader among thousands....  
,KKELTIKK,2007-11-08T18:53Z,"I agree, but the contribution of one person, who equates to thousand by the sheer numbers he/she has posted plus the quality, this person stands among a select few."
,zeroseven,2007-11-08T23:51Z,"aXXo you are the man!

Can someone verify that this is aXXo-stuff?"
,FuseLightning,2007-11-10T12:21Z,U rock aXXo!! and nice of KKELTIKK to reseed.
