can someone please seed."
,lux036,2010-01-15T03:23Z,great movie
,CaeserSicarius,2010-01-20T20:23Z,"Yeah, there's no one seeding, but if you can get to 96.8% (like me and a couple others who leech/seed this torrent) then you can watch the movie with vlc. Every so often during the movie you'll skip about half a second, but this dosn't really matter. Download this, it's a great movie."
,dayravager,2010-06-27T22:05Z,seed please! sigh 96.8
,satis_,2010-10-26T19:00Z,"For correct download: search for ""princess mononoke"", The name is incorrect here and the download stops at 96% anyway (causing annoying stutters every few minutes, even with vlc)."
