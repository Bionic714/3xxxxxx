seeding is simple: just leave your fav. bit torrent client open after completing this torrent... seed 'till you hit a ratio around 2.0 ... it basically means you uploaded twice the amount you've downloaded... which is nice... i'm going for 10.0 though ;)

hey - seeding is caring ;D ;D"
,zodiggity,2008-03-15T18:03Z,"okayy its seems the seeding has haulted.. come on people.. i just finished season 3 i NEED ME SOME ONE TREE HILL!!!

,BigAndLazy2010,2008-03-16T05:21Z,"This torrent is in English, right?
I haven't quite mastered Swedish; therefor, downloading the Swedish version of One Tree Hill (or anything else for that matter) would be a pointless waste of bandwidth...."
,UniX333,2008-04-10T19:08Z,"Okay, I'm seeding again. And yes. This torrent is in English. There's two subtitle-files in this torrent to. And those are in English too. But please seed when you're done!"

,Ragnell,2008-08-27T18:50Z,"Hey, I'm having troubles in rendering some of the episodes (3 and 4 specifically), and I'm using k-lite mega codec pack version 4.1.7
Do you have any idea of how to solve this problem? I tried with the GSpot tool, and ep3 is an MPEG-4, and the tool doesn't offer any solution, and ep4 file type is ~unknown~ O.O
Were you using the same codec pack? Maybe you have a better one, and I have some codec missing T.T Or maybe, I have to enable something that's not enabled within the recommended settings..
Pleease, help me, I'm craving to watch the series :("
