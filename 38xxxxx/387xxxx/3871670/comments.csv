,MrX75,2007-12-13T14:21Z,"Can anyone reseed ""CONFLICT VIETNAM"" XBOX please!"
,terrisan,2007-12-23T19:30Z,"@djlethal

I made this as a standard ISO, not an Xbox ISO.  So just open it with your favorite standard ISO viewer (I usually mount it with Daemon Tools) and move the files over to your Xbox."
,hmmm08,2007-12-26T17:37Z,"Appreciate your postings, but please please take this one down. Noone plays games that old. It's only good to check how boring games were many many years back... but to play those games now... no way"
,antsareus,2008-01-07T06:01Z,"hmmm08; why on earth would you waste time writing that comment? Why are you searching for this? You baffle me.. many people enjoy these old games, so why on earth should the uploader take this down because YOU don't particularly enjoy the classic games? Amazing.. o_0;"

,intoxic8ed,2008-02-08T18:16Z,"Awesome Upload.  Some Old games do still rock.  I mounted this image, and then used QUIX to make an XBOX iso.  Then Used Nero to burn.  Played fine from DVD.  THANKS AGAIN!"
,Lathlas,2008-11-13T03:23Z,"This is awesome, thank you. I've been jonesing for these ever since Megaman 9 came out and my emulators aren't as easy to use as this."
