,baboonbob,2007-12-19T17:23Z,"If anyone out there has any recordings or video of Dr.Gene Scott, I would be very interested in having a copy of it. It can be audio tapes, VCR tapes, CD, DVD, anything at all. I will gladly pay for the shipping, plus a little something for your trouble. I want to post it on my site... http://www.genescottteachings.multiply.com

Please feel free to visit the site. If you have anything, please contact me here, or at the site. Sincere thanks."
,forward_ho,2008-03-06T01:10Z,"IMPORTANT NOTE - The MP3s in this torrent were all taken from the larger torrent called ""Gene Scott - Lectures Removed From His Website Immediately After His Death.""     Unless you are ONLY interested in getting these few talks on Mysteries, subject, I'd recommend you downloa that torrent instead.   You'll be getting all of these and more."

thanks for your comment.  I have converted many more as promised (now using a new username by mistake)...  and they are now posted.

And for the record... there are WAY more.  To be exact... about 9GB more.

:) enjoy"
