II. THE "PIMSLEUR" METHOD
===============================================================================
The Pimsleur Method

What is the Pimsleur difference?

The Pimsleur Method Provides the most effective language-learning program ever
developed.  The Pimsleur Method gives you quick command of a new language's
structure without tedious drills.  Because of this, learning to speak becomes
enjoyable and rewarding.

The Key reason most people struggle with new languages is that they aren't
given proper instruction - only bits and pieces of a language.  Other language
programs sell only pieces - dictionaries; grammar books and instructions; lists
of hundreds or even thousands of words and definitions; audios containing
useless drills.  They leave it to you to assemble these pieces as you try to
speak.  Pimsleur enables you to spend your time learning to speak the language
rather than just studying its parts.

When you were learning English, could you speak before you knew how to
conjugate verbs?  Of course you could!  That same learning process is what
Pimsleur replicates.  Pimsleur presents the whole language as one integrated
piece so you can succeed.

The Pimsleur Method

The unique method developed by Dr. Paul Pimsleur lets you learn a language the
way native speakers do - exposing you to vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation
all at once, in everyday conversations.  And by applying Dr. Pimsleur's two key
proven principles - the Principle of Graduated Interval Recall and the
Principle of Anticipation - this program delivers results faster and more
effectively than any other language learning method, whether classroom or
packaged.

"The Principle of Graduated Interval Recall"

In his research, Dr Pimlseur discovered how long students remembered new
information and at what intervals they needed to be reminded of it.  If
reminded too soon or too late, they failed to retain the information.  This
discovery enabled him to create a schedule of exactly when and how the
information should be reintroduced.

This program is designed to remind you of new information at the exact
intervals where maximum retention takes place.  Each time your memory begins to
fade, you will be asked to recall the word.  Through this powerful method, your
new language skills move from short-term to long-term memory.

"The Principle of Anticipation"

Before Dr. Pimsleur created his unique teaching method, language courses were
based on the principle of repetition.  Teachers drummed phrases into the
students' minds over and over, as if language were made up only of words to be
memorized.  On the contrary, however, neurophysiologists tell us that simple
and unchallenging repetition has a hypnotic, even dulling effect on the
learning process, completely counterproductive to actually learning a
language. Dr. Pimsleur discovered that learning accelerates when there is an
"input/output" system of interaction, in which students receive information
and then are later asked to retrieve and use it.

The Principle of Anticipation requires you to "anticipate" a correct answer.
Practically, what this means is that you retrieve the answer from your memory
based on information provided in earlier lessons.

Pimsleur Results

In short, Pimsleur reinvents natural language acquisition - the way you
learned your native tongue - and applies it to second-language acquisition.
As sufficient structures and vocabulary are acquired, early reading is
introduced in those languages that employ a sound-based alphabet.  Learners
can then progress to see how word-sounds become written language. 

You'll have a broad repertoire of words, phrases, and sentences to choose from
as you're able to build longer sentences and have real interactive
conversations with native speakers.  You'll find yourself subconsciously
thinking in your new language before you know it. You'll be amazed at how
quickly you begin to understand the words and begin to put sentences together
in real conversations.
