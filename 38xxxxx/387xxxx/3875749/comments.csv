,zattara,2007-12-29T12:58Z,"I don't know what crawled up halofubar's butt, the uif mounts just fine with MagicDisc."
,bakpotatisenz,2008-01-06T19:24Z,"Very nice torrent, everything works just the way it should. "
,halofubar,2008-04-30T06:16Z,"The official APJ torrents are at http://APJ-MP3-1.halofubar.com (Demonoid), http://APJ-MP3-2.halofubar.com (here) and http://APJ-FLAC.halofubar.com (here)."
,yulatheterror,2008-07-03T10:56Z,that jack ass  is trying to get us to use his torrent
,kimeo,2008-12-14T20:20Z,"Just downloaded this, listening to Japanese I now, works just fine. The extra notes work too.

Also, just started using a Mac, since this file comes in UIF file format, which you will need to convert to ISO before using:

http://vafer.org/projects/uif2iso4mac/
It's free, and it works - install this app, double click the ISO, it'll be mounted in Finder under your hard disk and user name. From there, drag and drop the folders you want to use to its destination."
,zion666,2009-01-24T13:57Z,"Can someone let me know how to change a UIF, in order to make it compatible with Windows.....I'm very uncomputer savy.  thanks in advance."
,yulatheterror,2009-02-27T08:59Z," noobs you dnt need to change to to iso, it is like iso but different. it should work on anything."
,halofubar,2009-03-10T18:46Z,"I've updated the real Absolute Pimsleur's Japanese to fix several of the MP3 files that had truncation issues at the end. Release 2 is available at http://APJ.halofubar.com, or you can get the mirror address at http://www.halofubar.com (which also gives instructions on how to get a free 7GB+ gmail-powered @halofubar.com account).

Again, this torrent right here wasn't posted by me, but says it's my material. Whether it is a copy of my old torrent or not, the new one fixes several problems.

I may (*may*) upload APJ R2 on TPB as well, since I already have it on Demonoid and MiniNova."
,halofubar,2009-03-11T23:48Z,"I put up a mirror to ""Absolute Pimsleur's Japanese"" Release 2 here on TPB as well: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4761360/Absolute_Pimsleur_s_Japanese_%5BRelease_2%5D. Enjoy!"
,Vaganza,2009-06-05T00:55Z,"Pay more attention to the woman?s pronunciations in Level II 2nd edition, as the man?s tend to slide / slur towards 
(ex.:) ?kyte kyrikaishte kydasai? rather than saying ?kiite kurikaishite kudasai? as just one example but often used.  (For English speakers; you can read ?y? here as the French pronunciation for their ?u?).

I hear no such faults in Level I 3rd or Level III 1st.
Have not checked Level III 2nd. 
Would this be dialectically, I couldn?t know. 

(Why my quotation marks end up being question marks I don?t know)

,halofubar,2010-07-13T06:01Z,Just released the FLAC (lossless) version of Absolute Pimsleur\'s Japanese here on TPB at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5688306/Absolute_Pimsleur_s_Japanese_FLAC for your listening pleasure. :)
,raydioaktivman,2011-05-28T07:27Z,"Halofubar's PB link doesn't work,his ""ajp..."" one does. Is this Language app good for playing in your car while commuting to work? I hope so! 

Thanks to Halo for making this and to kemacy2 for putting it on PB. I originally go the flac version but that doesn't work in iTunes, so this saves me all the work of converting to mp3."
