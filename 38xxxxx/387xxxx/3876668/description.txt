During the 1860s, Dave Powers, apprentice to a horse trainer, volunteers to ride Archer to the Melbourne Cup race. Their start is 600 miles from Melbourne, and the journey is anything but easy. Of course, the pair have numerous adventures along the way, and in the end Archer competes in the Melbourne Cup race.

The film features a young, pre-stardom Nicole Kidman as a flirtatious farmer's daughter and she makes the most of the fairly small part.
