SWiSHmax has everything you need to create stunning fully interactive Flash animations. You can create shapes, text, buttons, sprites, and motion paths. You can also include more than 230 ready-to-use animated effects including explode, vortex, 3D spin, and wave. You can create your own effects or make an interactive movie by adding actions to objects. A scripting language allows you to program sophisticated operations into your animations. You can preview your animation inside SWiSHmax without launching a browser or external player, and live editing lets you make changes while the animation is playing. SWiSHmax creates all the files you need to upload to your Web server, or you can generate the HTML code to paste into an existing Web page.
