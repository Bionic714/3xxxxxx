A calm has finely descended on a small eastern european town after suffering a series of grisly murders that plagued their women folk. Normality continued up until the day an abandoned frozen meat van was found on waste ground by the local police force. Inside the van was a mutilated women, stripped of both her clothes and her life. The killer has returned to stalk the local prostitutes and is finding easy pickings amongst the ladies of the night. Assigned to the case is women hating Detective Polanski who has as much disregard for women as the killer himself.
