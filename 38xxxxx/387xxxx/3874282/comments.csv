,Matomico,2008-09-20T13:18Z,"And By the way, the people that say stuff like:""NO TROJAN"", are probably friends that try to Fake us."
,kriss1,2008-10-26T11:23Z,"I downloaded this file, when I clicked the install my virus detector detected a Troyan, and it happened two times in a row.  So yeah, deffo don't dl this, and tbh it should be locked or something. :/"
,Wilhelm820,2008-11-18T19:10Z,"This works golden and there is no threat in downloading it.

I rate this torrent 9/10, and recently scanned with nod32, AVG, and Norton and found no threat."
[V],kentucky-kid,2009-05-14T18:12Z,"it's clean, checked"
,Gigatol,2009-06-17T08:36Z,"sweet, i was having trouble with image files for a game i got from another torrent, tried a bunch of image software, this is the only one that worked perfectly, thanks alot, gimme5"
,{Reingold},2009-07-16T00:45Z,THERE IS A TROYAN ON THIS!
,{Reingold},2009-07-16T01:34Z,You have done very good so far. I was able to install acording to the directions and it mounted my .iso. It is showing up in My Computer just fine. Be sure to extract the .rar file and then rar it again with a password under advanced setting inn winrar. If you don't do this the program is susceptible to virus scanners deleting it on you. This has happened to me on all the old Alcohols I had and liked and are now worthless. Do yourself a favor and pasword protect the files.
,Jim_Hazard,2009-08-29T18:43Z,i downloaded this and my anti virus registerd it as a  trojan as soon as download was complete
,hellmelon666,2010-04-03T18:42Z,"If ""Contains TROYAN"" isn't meme yet, it should be."
,DJsnypa,2010-05-03T03:31Z,"Cracks work in the same way that trojans do; they forcibly modify an application. Because of their coding most antivirus scanners will pick them up as trojans.

Please understand that cracks work the same way that viruses do, but they do something good instead of something bad."
,Mixalos7,2010-06-20T12:09Z,@MrJigsaw  you are NOOB YOU TELL ME THAT YOU SCAN IT WITH AVG

,Mixalos7,2010-06-20T14:29Z,its clean i sscan all the files on www.virusscan.jotti.org with 20 antivirus and they found nothing 100%clean guys!!!!!!
,gogo5455,2010-11-06T01:00Z,"Guys, it detects trojans because keygens are just detected as trojans. I've downloaded all kinds of things like this, and I've never had any problems. I'll check this out when its done though."
,gogo5455,2010-11-06T01:11Z,"You guys are retarded, this thing works fine! read the instructions dumbasses!"
