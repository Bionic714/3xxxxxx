,sblackman,2007-11-04T07:06Z,Maybe with an .avi file you would have less problem :)
,ChocolateJedi,2007-11-04T16:04Z,"Thankyou for this show.
I agree with sblackman.  Please use .avi"
,silence951,2007-11-05T03:24Z,"actually avi/mkv are container formats wich dont have a lot in common with codec problems ...

and mkv is (imho) superior to avi .."

,twoarmman,2007-11-12T00:44Z,go with avi!!!  at least try it.  It seems every one you do with the superior mkv has some glitch in it...
