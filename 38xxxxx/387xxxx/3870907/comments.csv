I don't seem to be able to play the musik in Media player. It says that it doesn't recognise the codec. Is there anything additional i should have to do?"

The .jpg files doesn't work either. Is there something wrong with the entire torrent? Allan Taylor is great but it would be nice to listen to the record before i buy it."

Don't download this torrent......the guy doesn't know that hte torrent doesn't work.....pity 'cause Taylor is a good singer.
