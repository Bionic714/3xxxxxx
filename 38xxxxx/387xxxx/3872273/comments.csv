,cdelaire,2007-11-05T10:15Z,Only video is in german. The patchs works for all languages. I tried with CS3 English and French and it's ok
,.danocoys,2007-11-08T00:22Z,"Please, do you have something for Indesign CS3?? I have Leopard and Indesign doesn't work .. I don't know why. Please help me. I need it, for work and school etc..
And of course thanks' for this anti-crash. "
,pharmschoolkids,2007-12-08T00:14Z,"I hope this one works.

We need more seeders please!"
,DJ_NRG,2007-12-14T02:20Z,"Download the Adobe software (individual components) off the Adobe website and the run the CS3 Design Crack for Leopard installer elsewhere on this site. 
Works on Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.
Do NOT allow the Adobe updater to update your software.
Works fine."
,efritz9,2007-12-17T04:50Z,"Everything works fine (as of now), but I do have one concern : On a few of the program's welcome screens, it offers to send me to the store to buy a key, saying 'turn your trial version into a full version'.  Should this happen normally?  Is it currently a trial version (which will expire)?  

Also, under 'help', the activate/deactivate/register options, each program has a different configuration.  Some have check-marks next to them, some of them are available and some are unavailable.  

I just wanted to know if this is normal, or if something failed in the patch.  "
,Antimoscas,2008-01-14T04:20Z,"Works great! Thanks a lot m8 =) well does anyone knows where can i find some anti-crash like these for Adobe indesign?? It seems none likes Indesign -.- i can't find it anywhere individual...the cracks dont work they allways get some error ""some files could do not be patched"" or ""this version cannot be patched"" somethin like this..and the serial # dont work so i have to ask for an e-license...i'd apreciate any sugestions... thanks =)"
