,SilverArrows,2007-12-16T18:02Z,Actually EA's official position on filesharing was given a long time ago. It's called The Exchange ;)

MissVixen, just chuck them into your game's downloads folder. There's a readme in the torrent, follow the link in that to my site for download instructions and troubleshooting."
