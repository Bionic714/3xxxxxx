Review from Amazon:
"The Scene Changes" is a classic jazz trio album by one of the great jazz pianists of all time. While Bud Powell's best recordings for Blue Note are from the late 40s and early 50s in my opinion (captured on the two volumes of "The Amazing Bud Powell"), this is one of three sessions he made for the label in 1957-58. (The other two are "Bud!" and "Time Waits," and while the former is hard to find as a single issue, all of the above sessions are available as part of "Bud Powell - The Complete Blue Note and Roost Recordings.") The hallmark of Bud's second stint at Blue Note for me is the wonderful sound of these recordings. It might just be the difference between the mono recordings of five and ten years earlier, and the distinct stereo sound of the late 50s, but it makes the music come to life. You can even pick out Bud's trademark moans during his solos (which sometimes get a little old, but they are endearing nonetheless). Sure, his playing wasn't quite what was back in the day, but they are terrific nonetheless. Anyone interested in great piano trio jazz should be thankful that "The Scene Changes" is back in print courtesy of the RVG Edition series.

Enjoy this wonderful release!
