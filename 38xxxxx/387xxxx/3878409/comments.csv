,inter009,2007-11-10T20:06Z,"Is this a good one?
Qualiti? Sound?"
,sharana,2007-11-11T08:56Z,"There are screenshots and sample.
Are you blind?"
,moviemessenger,2007-11-13T12:09Z,"I downloaded this as screenshots and sample were good, its got cd1 and cd2 avi files, I can't open cd1, keep getting ""file is corrupted"", or "" file is wrong format"" cd2 is perfect audio and video, so ""sharana"" you can't always rely on samples or screenshots. And before anyone else says ""go watch it in the cinema"". My nearest cinema is 30 miles away and I live in the country, I don't have transport, am disabled, and I rely on ""comments"" made as i have a monthly download limit with my ISP. If anyone can get or has gotten cd1 open please let us know in a ""comment"" also the program that opened it, Thank You"
,sharana,2007-11-13T21:55Z,"moviemessenger, Hash Check this torrent. cd1 is good."
,moviemessenger,2007-11-14T06:23Z,"Thanks ""sharana"" I use BitComet for downloading and thought I had Hash Check enabled just checked it and I haven't, also being at bit of a newbie at this, I'm not to sure how to do it once the download is complete,any help would be most appreciated,Thanks in advance."
,moviemessenger,2007-11-15T06:44Z,"I took most of the day, but figured it out, Hash Checked cd1, only 99% of it had downloaded,done that, tried it out and its working now, perfect audio & video on both cd1 & cd2, thanks ""sharana"" for the info, it pays to have Hash Check enabled, also thanks to ""changebg"
