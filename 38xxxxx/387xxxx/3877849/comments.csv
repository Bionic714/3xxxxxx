this does not makes sence at all!

Uploading in aac is just not wanted nor needed -
Aac may sounds better than MP3 does but it is not yet compatible with everything. 

Soundtrack albums by the best composers have to be in *Lossless* quality wave or Flac. THIS IS wanted AND needed so upload wave maybe in Flac format for soundtrack albums 


And do never ever put it in any archive !!!!
Let people deceide what to download by opening the torrent.
