Review	by Jason Ankeny
Beyond Rangoon remains composer Hans Zimmer's most effective and fully realized embrace of ethnic music tropes -- channeling the Southeast Asian traditions of the film's titular setting, Zimmer employs pipes, wood flutes, and native rhythms to vivid effect, deftly sidestepping the megawatt overkill that undermines his more conventional Hollywood efforts. Zimmer's colorful, luminous melodies boast a lyricism long absent from his work, evoking the mysteries of the former Burma in striking detail -- while synthesizers add clarity and depth to the music, Zimmer steadfastly avoids any pronounced Western motifs and themes, communicating the exotic otherness of his subject with aplomb.
