,Stendonk,2007-11-08T18:03Z,"File IS playable, atleast it works with realplayer on my mac. Quality is not great though, as you would expect from such a release"
,LesStrater,2007-11-17T22:05Z,"Besides missing the sex scenes, many of the English subtitles are cropped off the bottom of the screen in the first half of the movie.  So don't plan on following the plot unless you speak Chinese."
