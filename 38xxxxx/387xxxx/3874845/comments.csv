,seeis,2009-03-17T18:51Z,Nice.. atleast some games I like!! =)
,danijmay,2009-06-14T12:40Z,"I hear ya RO71... I'm at 1% after like 20 minutes... it's literally going at dial-up rates. I really tried to be as selective as possible, given the huge roster and slow speed, but I still selected around 60 games. That brings me to a question about the mention of duplicates. Before, I've just played it safe and downloaded all duplicates, but seeing as how that can hardly be afforded in this case, I'm wondering if it's necessary. What is the reason for these duplicates and their extensions?"
,OrangeMush,2010-09-04T20:38Z,Very nice doubles are not needed though if people download the newest project64 but sadly yoshi's story does not work on the emu neither of them work when you move the screen jumps around causing you to freeze in spot
