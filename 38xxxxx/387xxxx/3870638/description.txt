TOPCAT is an acronym for Take-Off and Landing Performance Calculation Tool. ItÃ¢??s a highly realistic, easy-to-use planning tool for all serious Flight Simulator enthusiasts. 

ItÃ¢??s a hot day in Frankfurt. You are leaving for a long-range flight New York. There is a light tailwind on runway 25R with light rain. How many passengers can you take today? How much cargo? Can you de-rate on Take-Off (reduce engine thrust)?
On landing in New York you have problems with your Flaps. How much runway do you need? Can you make it? 

TOPCAT will answer all these questions within a few mouse clicks. 

Features of TOPCAT 

- Microsoft Windows stand-alone application coming with installer and uninstaller 
- Easy to use, user friendly interface

This one is for my friend 537 :D come on man, you can do better than this! hiding in VIP..haha what a joke :D and actually mentioning me in your readmes..I feel flattered! LOL
