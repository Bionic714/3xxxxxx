,acridity,2008-01-11T21:18Z,it's dead
,MystikIncarnate,2008-01-16T12:20Z,"96.1%   ... same old story.

if anyone could seed, even just for a few hours, i'm sure someone else (of a typical 60 peers) would retrieve the rest of the torrent, with everyone being on this for so long, i'm sure there'd be some seeding going on from that... i know i'd be willing to seed for a few weeks to try and get 3 or 4 more seeds out there and revive this torrent... but first we need to get past 96.1%."
