,mkmacabre,2008-03-03T21:27Z,"I am also getting the exact same MSG when extracting: 

""Traktor.DJ.Studio.v2.5.Video.Manual.and.Tutorial..rar: CRC failed in Traktor.DJ.Studio.v2.5.Video.Manual.and.Tutorial..iso.The file is corrupt""

This file is corrupt? This file is useless? Are we all mistaken? Anyone else had any luck with this? 

Whats the deal abdalid? "
