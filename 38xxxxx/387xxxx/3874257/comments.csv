,robinhood1984,2007-11-07T11:31Z,"Everyone,

Some of these movies are out of print or otherwise hard to find both on and offline, so everybody please seed for at least a little while after you complete the download. I'll seed this for as long as possible, but I can't seed forever.

Peace!"

,robinhood1984,2007-12-07T10:14Z,"bkauf_23,

The torrent has been pretty popular so I think I'll keep it on for at least another month. But don't use the movie Panther for as a source, it's more fiction than fact. The others are better.

Check out Elaine Browne's A Taste of Power, David Hillard's This Side of Glory, Flores Forbes' Will You Die With Me?, Charles Jones' The Black Panther Party Reconsidered, or Huey P. Newton's To Die For The People if you want some more real info on what the original Black Panthers stood for. The wikipedia articles on them are pretty accurate too.

Peace!"
