Comrades,

    Due to the popularity of the black panther party films I've uploaded I've decided to put my Black Panther DVD online for download.


    This torrent is a single .iso file with four films about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. 

    #1: A Huey P. Newton Story
    #2: The Murder of Fred Hampton
    #3: Free Huey
    #4: Mario Van Peebles' 1995 movie Panther  


    -A Huey P. Newton Story is a one man play about the life of Huey P. Newton
    -The Murder of Fred Hampton is a documentary is about the activities and death of the slain Chicago Black Panther leader Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton
    -Free Huey is a documentary about the movement to release Huey P. Newton from Prison, includes speeches from Bobby Seale, H Rap Brown, and Stokely Carmichael
    -Panther is Mario Van Peebles 1995 movie about the rise and fall about the Black Panther Party. 

    The movies have already been ripped to DVD format so burn the image to a blank DVD and it'll work in your DVD player.


     Will seed for thrity days, later if enough people leech on, less than thirty days if there are no takers.

     Peace!
