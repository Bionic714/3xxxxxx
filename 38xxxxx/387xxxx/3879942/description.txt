Steinberg cubasis from 1994 is an older but very easy to use program for midifiles. It doesn\\\\\\\'t take much more space than a floppy disk. If you do not have need for exclusive high-end recording software, but just want to make easy midifiles or just edit a midifile this is the program for you. Just install and run - no patches or serial needed.
