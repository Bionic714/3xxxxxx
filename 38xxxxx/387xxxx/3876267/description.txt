:::PLOT:::
Young student finds himself being transformed to a vampire after a night with a quite attractive female vampire. First, he does not quite believe it himself, but with the help of a 300 year old teacher and the handbook \"vampirism - a guide to an alternative lifestyle\", he finds out that blood does not taste as bad as he expected. Of course, he does not bite women, as a good guy he sticks to pig blood which is offered by the local butcher as a special offer for vampires. Trouble rises when a vampire hunter tries to track him down with wooden sticks and silver bullets...

This is a TVRIP. I\'ve looked for the DVD everywhere, and as far as I can tell this hasen\'t been released on DVD. The quality is DVD like, there is no logo in the corner of the screen, this is the ENTIRE movie including all credits.

Enjoy and PLEASE SEED!!!
