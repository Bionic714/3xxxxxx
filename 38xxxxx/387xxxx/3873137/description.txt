Penance once again follows the disturbed exploits of the two nameless killers from the previous AU entries, a veritable Bonnie and Cycle for the sadist set. Unlike the other films in the series, there are actually moments of genuine clarity sandwiched in between the grue, some of which are actually quite suburban. In fact, there?s enough so-called ?down time? in Penance that some may think Vogel has gone a little soft on us. At first, anyway. Don?t let those coherent conversations and mature observations fool you; Vogel is just biding his time, lulling you into a false sense of security before getting down to some seriously depraved business
