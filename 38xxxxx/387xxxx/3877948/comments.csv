,ttrriicckkyy,2007-11-18T08:04Z,"kiwipal: did you update it up to 1.4 with the patches directories? after you do that, you need to copy the crack (the last directory) and move BOTH files to the game directory (I believe there's a crack in the ISOs, but it doesn't work)"

,cheezepuffly,2008-02-25T03:19Z,hate it when these people make these and people need help and they wont help us... unless someone knows how to fix this dont bother downloading this thing.
,cheezepuffly,2008-02-25T04:37Z,"sorry for double posting but what he said worked. Install all the patches THEN cut and paste the things in the crack folder. 

So update then crack. It will work then."
,secretagent004,2008-02-25T19:45Z,"Ok guys, I have 6 sub folders (1 Patch 1.01, 2 Patch 1.10, 3 Patch 1.20, 4 patch1.30, 5 patch 1.40, 6 CRACK) inside a PATCH folder
-------------------------------------------------------
1.) So, shud i FIRST apply all the patches and then the CRACK ?? 

OR

First, the crack then all the patches ??
------------------------------------------------
2.) Do, i have to copy the patches into the main game folder of Warhammer ?? or just double click them one-by-one ???"
,secretagent004,2008-02-27T07:41Z,"-=-=-=-=-=- Installation Info for Warhammer 40K-Dawn of War -=-=-=-=-=-

1.) Install the game into your desired drive (location on your HDD).
2.) Install all the PATCHES (found in the PATCH folder) from Patch 1.01, 1.10, 1.20, 1.30, 1.40
3.) Copy the ""Memory.dll"", from the CRACK folder (found in the PATCH folder) into the main game 

folder. (DO not copy the CRACK found on CD-1, as its non working, maybe).
4.) Copy and paste the ""W40k"" crack (found in the PATCH folder) into the main game directory 

(i.e the place/folder where you installed Warhammer 40K-Dawn of War.
5.) Play the Game.. !!

NOTE:  The basic idea is to INSTALL all the patches first(in ascending order i.e starting from 

1.01 upto 1.40) and then copy every file(2 files) from the CRACK folder (in the PATCH folder) 

into the main game directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game works perfectly gr8 on a P-4, 2Ghz machine with 1GB RAM and a 256 MB Graphics card (AGP) with WIN XP PRO SP2
--------------------------------------------------------

Hope u guys liked my installation info.. :)

PROS OF THE TORRENT:
Easy to get to work
Step by step instructions
Easy to find crack
EVERYTHING IN THE GAME WORKS
Anyone with the brain capacity of an autistic 8 year old could figure it out.
CONS OF THE TORRENT:
Lack of seeders, but that is no ones fault.

Thanks dude :)"

,diryde,2009-05-17T02:12Z,"God, what's wrong with you people? You really need instructions to know where the CD's are?? If you look at the 12 files in this torrent, there are files named:

Warhammer 40000 Dawn of War Cd1.iso
Warhammer 40000 Dawn of War Cd2.iso
Warhammer 40000 Dawn of War Cd3.iso

And you don't know where the CD is? I mean, Zarnec is calling tricky a ""fucking idiot"" because he doesn't know where to find it. Who's REALLY the idiot?"
,diryde,2009-05-17T02:13Z,"Read the directions!!!

INSTRUCTIONS ON TEXT FILE"
,diryde,2009-05-18T02:40Z,"Worked like a charm, by the way.

1. After downloading, mount the Cd1 file using daemontools, alcohol 120%, etc., & run the AUTORUN file to install the game (get to this via the My Computer icon on your desktop or Start menu)

3. During install, just double click on the Cd .iso file in My Computer that the install asks for, as it asks for it. At the end of install, you will need to mount the 1st Cd again.

4. After install, first run each patch IN ORDER.

5. After running each patch, copy the two files from the Crack folder into the game folder @ 'c:\program files\thq\dawnofwar', or whatever you named it during the install. 

6. When the popup asks about overwriting existing files, choose ""Yes to All"".

7. Play the game."

,toepler,2009-06-26T05:20Z,"ok i have figured it out. but this only works if u have a friend u want to play with. so for all that want to play this online then here u go.

first (like i said) u need a friend or as many friends u would like.

then have everyone find thier IP's

have the person with the best internet connection click MULTIPLAYER in the main menu. then click DIRECT HOST. that person will make a name for it and a password for it that he will tell u.

next everyone else that wants to join the game clicks MULTIPLAYER in the main menu. then click DIRECT JOIN. type in the IP ADDRESS of the person that is hosting the game and the password and connect.

That should connect u to the game and u should be able to play.

as far as playing with random people on a public server.......idk yet but when i fnd out i will let u know"

,sickduck2,2010-03-15T03:14Z,"1.)  First rule of pirating (well at least in my book)

DO NOT PLAY PIRATED GAMES ONLINE!!!!  Companies know if your CD key isn't legit.  The only reason you would put in a key for a pirated game is simply to bypass it and get to the game play.

2.) Downloaded this torrent on my laptop from my brother's network at his apartment and he got a letter from his ISP saying that they got a letter from the publisher saying that the game was DL'd from his network and if he repeats then they will shut him off.

I understand that this rarely happens, but just keep in mind that it CAN happen."

,igadoter,2011-02-12T09:03Z,"Hi guys,
I discovered that this torrent has already SP_Redux mod installed. But you won't be able to play this mod if you will patch the game.  BUT there  is a solution. After installation DO NOT patch the game. Instead of use a crack from CD1 iso image. Simple copy and paste that crack into your DoW directory ( where the executable is placed). At this moment you should be able to play SP_Redux mod. If don't know what SP_Redux mod is look at the internet."
,reepacheep523,2011-02-28T04:44Z,"Okay this is what I did and it works fine.

1.  Use PowerISO to extract ALL the content from Cd 1, 2, and 3 TO THE SAME FOLDER.  

2.  Click the autorun to install the game like you normally would

3.  Install the patches (if you want them, if they dont work, its okay they arent really necessary)

4.  If you didnt install the patches, mount the W40K application from the ""crack"" folder

5.  If you DID install the patches, do the same with the crack from the ""6 crack"" folder under ""patch""

6.  Copy the crack that you mounted.  Go to your hard drive (should be under ""computer"" somewhere)  I have windows 7, so if you do to, go to Program files x86, to down to THQ, go into Warhammer 40k, and paste the crack that you copied in the beginning."
