,-Mazza-,2008-06-14T15:23Z,"So how do I do this? I don't have five discs, all I've got is one .mdf and one .mds file. It installs fine, but after that it just tells me to insert the correct disc - But there's only one disc here.  Yes, I have tried using the crack, but the same problem still persists.

Please help me out here."
,yallsick,2008-06-19T00:12Z,"I'm also having problems. There are no files marked as discs 1-5, just one .mdf file, .r0-.r37 files with that same .mdf in them, and a rar file also containing the .mdf. I've tried both mounting and burning it and it's so far not worked in the slightest."
,csikcs,2008-06-23T00:34Z,So is this game has spanish or english language?
[T],ooStevo,2008-07-02T01:32Z,"Works perfect.Mount mds file with daemon tools,get crack from gamecopyworld and start playing.And for all the noobs,multi 5 means that there are multiple languages within the game.English is one of them!!!!"

,bastiens,2008-07-14T19:07Z,"Guys, additional help:

after you run the game and install it using daemon tools, powerIso, etc, you still need to download the crack:

hereÂ´s one link, replace the original sh3.exe from C:/ProgramFiles/KONAMI and use SH3.ece provided here:
