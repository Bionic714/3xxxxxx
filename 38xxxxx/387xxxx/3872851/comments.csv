It's a VERY old PC game, probably on Windws 2 or 3 anyways from what I remember it's a puzzle game and one scene u get 5 levers and 5 buttons and must press or pull the right one to let you though, all others release poison gas, and another scene (place i never got past) has a root growing from the roof of a mouth.. If ANYONE has any idea what I'm talking about PLEASE reply!!
