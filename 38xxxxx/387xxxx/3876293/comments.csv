In other words, you cannot burn this to a CD. Only Floppies."

Have you installed this with Virtual PC? I'm trying to do it myself, but it doesn't even get past the 'formatting drive' process and simply says there was an error doing it.

[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-25T05:31Z,Yes that is where I use it today. It went pretty smooth for me... Perhaps you are using the wrong Vhd settings?

Hur ska man göra?"
,greenelastic88,2008-02-01T12:46Z,"those who say you cant write it to a cd:
decompress the files to a folder and try burn it to a cd with nero(etc.). also works, if the bios supports cd-boot, and when the installer asks for the next floppy, browse to the cd.
hint: make a win boot floppy from an another windows, hit it and start the cd from that. its much easier than burn 14 floppies.
its tested, so it works!"

,tengeta,2008-03-01T07:42Z,"yeah PhXAnarchy, use Linux every fucking minute of every fucking day. you Linux obsessed kiddies are more of slaves than even Mactards, i listen to these people talk crap about windows all the time and all its problems, but all they know that from is heresay and the fact they used windows 3.1 once or twice back in the day and have refused to try a single version since.

i use Linux, i use Windows. they both have their reasons, they both have their place. Microsoft may have an ""unfair advantage"" in the market, but that means nothing about the quality of OS. i have had a clean installed XP that in my opinion is quite possibly the best OS ever made, period. it actually matches all of my Linux machines in uptime strength, and a well maintained XP install can boot faster than Linux and keep up with it in all performance aspects that a non-server user will ever need (the fact is, your typical home user will a. never have half a TB in ram, and b. don't care to due to the fact they aren't running servers that need that). and actually on the graphics end windows wins, you can't even try to argue that one. oh, and you mactards don't even have your place anymore, you're all just idiots that pay for a UNIX based system you could get for FREE and buy a MUCH cheaper set of hardware that is... the exact same as what they put in overpriced Macs.

overall, my opinion is that if you only use one operating system your a close minded slave. reguardless of what that single OS is. if Linux was truly better for home desktop users, thats what would be there. problem is the developers of Linux refuse to simplify any part of it and left it to Apple to make the user-friendly edition of UNIX for people that are clueless with computers (which is what 90% of PC users worldwide?) so if it does ever end up as the most popular OS in the home, Apple is gonna bank off it big time. Although when it comes to Ubuntu, i kinda have to take that back about the user-friendly part. My mom has no problem getting around that version of Linux whatsoever, and shes rather computer-illiterate by modern standards.

and the last part of my rant is a question: how may Windows kiddies run around Linux downloads on TPB and talk crap about the OS? yeah, i wasn't surprised by the whole zero myself."
,tengeta,2008-03-01T07:45Z,"jeez i forgot to thank for the upload... i'm not honestly downloading it because i already have it, but i figure a thanks is necessary if you post in the files page. so thanks!"

,Vulcan262,2008-03-17T23:15Z,"Thanks for the torrent, I needed it for the 10 laptops I got my hands on that needed to have the windows installed from floppies, yeah I know they are old but for nastalgia, they are fun to play with, I may sell them individually to collectors who want them, lmao.

I agree with tengeta, most Linux users now bash windows without really knowing the systems advantages, they mainly focus on its disadvantages, such as can't write programs with it and such, because of how the O/S is setup. But that is what software developement programs are for, with the right ones on a windows puter, you can bust out progs like you can in Linux, I have Linux, Solaris, and Windows puters, and like them all for their advantages, and their inherit weaknesses. I don't bash any O/S, cause they all have good qualities that people can use, it is up to the people to choose what works for them, as for me, I use them all. I am just as comfortable at command line execution as double click."
,Vulcan262,2008-03-17T23:17Z,"Forgot this, the reason I have more than one O/S is simple, to make sure the progs I write are completely compatibal with them."

,wbm56,2008-12-02T02:41Z,"The floppy files will indeed fit on standard 1.44MB floppies, because they are not formatted in the standard way.  They use a compressed format which allows for 1.63MB per floppy.  The program used to write the floppies should be able to take care of reformatting them as well."

I'm not sure if the install boot disk included in this package is really the original install boot disk or one from Windows 95B, because...

if you install it on an unformatted hard drive (virtual or otherwise) it will format a partition larger than 2048 MB (2 GB)... a bug in the setup disk format writes inconsistent ending cyl-head-sector-#sectors to the master boot record, hence causing scandisk to hang.  I verified this with PowerQuest Partition Table Editor.  Original Windows 95 uses the FAT16 file system which limits partitions to 2048 MB.

So the workaround is to make your virtual hard drive no larger than 2048 MB, or preformat your real hard drive to that size or smaller, before running the setup boot disk.

Thanks for the torrent, but I'm having trouble installing it with Virtual PC as downloaded from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3433533/Virtual_PC_7.0_for_MAC_incl_serials_(TOAST).rar. I have Toast Titanium 9 and a PPC G4. I have tried saving a disk image for each .IMA, booting up my Virtual PC, then mounting the Disk Images, I have tried mounting them before hand, but no matter what, I get a message saying ""OS not found                     
Install an OS on this hard drive"" then, when I press anything: ""Reboot and Select proper Boot device

BTW I've just found out how you can get a better video with VMware. Just change the hardware to Workstation 5 and you'll have it. Sound doesn't work in this version, only work in 95C.
And I've just read some of you guys are over-acting...all OSes are nearly the same...non is perfect...Windows has many viruses, OSX is too hardware intensive and too expensive, and Linux requires a lot of knowledge on CLI. I use Windows and will continue to use Windows for my entire life...there's nothing wrong about that, just install good AV and you'll be fine."
