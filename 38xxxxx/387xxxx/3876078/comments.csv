,Saabatron,2010-01-05T07:43Z,"So as in the description, this is basically all of Halford's work not including Judas Priest.

-Fight
  -War Of Words
  -A Small Deadly Space
  -Mutations

-Two/2wo
  -Voyeurs

-Halford
  -Resurrection
  -Crucible
  -Live Insurrection
  -Live At House Of Blues [Bootleg]"
,Saabatron,2010-01-05T08:08Z,"And from what wikipedia says (not so reliable)... 

It says the band FIGHT released 2 studio albums, and one EP (Extended Play), and those are them there (Mutations being the EP).

TWO/2WO released only one album, which is in here.

HALFORD created 3 studio albums, 2 of which are in here (Resurrection, and Crucible). And the other 2 albums by Halford in this discography Live Insurrection, and Live At House Of Blues, both of these are live albums if you haven't figured that out yet. And the other studio album not in this discography (beginning of 2010 anyways) is called ""Halford III: Winter Songs"".

Hope this helps anyone who was really confused about this at first like myself :D"

Thank you macthing :)"
