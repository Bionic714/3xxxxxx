,Archer_DRAW,2008-05-12T14:31Z,"Big Thanx ""bojan86"" !

Is there a ""PM"" function ? I don't know how to ""let you know"" my wish ?
I write it here :

1. Chicago - ""The Approaching Storm"" ( #22 on the platina album ""III"" from 1971 )
 > the problem is the end is CUT by some idiot. 
Do You have it un-cut ?

2. Boogie Kings - ""Open For Business"" whole album by swedish rock set of studio musicians :
simply unbelievable ! Some of the wildest hottest guitar licks I've heard in my life ! This UNEDITED Live(!) album from Engelen Pub is very rare, and challenges anything ever recorded in the genre ""Back-To-The-Roots-Rock'n-Roll"" raw drive POWER !
(Dave Nerge - lead vocals. Anything else with him ?)

3. O Fortuna - Carmina Burana ; Orff
Do You have it WITH the end un-cut ? 
(And maybe the whole concert without the endings CUT - what? is this a new trend? to cut the end of the piece and so RUIN the whole experience!? The reverbation of the last sound, the silence with the tune still lingering : OF COURSE it should all be included !
Even the audience response SHOULD BE INCLUDED ! They're part of the performance !)

Thanx in advance
