,BenderB.Rodriguez,2007-11-04T00:10Z,sorry about the whole Teh Pwnerer thing.  I have lots of Aliases.  This is my 1st torrent EVER. Tell me what you think.
,BenderB.Rodriguez,2007-11-04T01:46Z,"Sorry everyone, the m3u doesn't work. I left it pointing to the original .wav files Dohhh.  The tracks are fine though and if you want, you can just open the m3u in a text editor and fix it yourself. Or you can just add all of the tracks to a play list by hand.  "
,BenderB.Rodriguez,2007-11-04T02:21Z,Me Again!  There may be a problem with Track #5. Please respond if there is and I will re up just that track.
