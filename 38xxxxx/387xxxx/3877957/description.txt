United States Academic Decathlon presents The Music of China CD from the official USAD curriculum from last year. It's a collection of songs from throughout China's musical history. To be honest it's actually pretty good.

Includes folk songs, instrumentals, old Chinese opera music, "Two Butterflies" (a modern cantopop song), and others.

It's in 320 kb/s mp3. Oh yeah and I added scans of the cover/ song list too.
