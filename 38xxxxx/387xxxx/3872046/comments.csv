,Habichtshorst,2008-04-29T14:22Z,"How's the quality of this torrent? Downloaded the 31 CD Discography and that one wasn't good either, badly labeled if at all. Now I read here that there's bad rips? Anyone other opinions on this torrent?"

,zyxomaniac,2009-11-21T15:05Z,"The world is full of ungreatful bastards, and some of them are stupid enough to tell the world by shouting it out loud...

kire310, it would be very interesting if you could show any info supporting your claim that basically all albums were digitally recorded.

If not, please go and whine somewhere else.

domland, thanks for your effort!"
