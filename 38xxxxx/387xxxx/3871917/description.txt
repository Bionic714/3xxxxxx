Against Depression by Peter D. Kramer

A decade ago, with his breakaway bestseller, Listening to Prozac, Peter Kramer revolutionized the way we think about antidepressants and the culture in which they are used. Now, he returns with a profound look at the condition those medications treat ? depression. He asks: If we could eradicate depression so that no human being ever suffered it again, would we?

Against Depression is a groundbreaking assessment of the science of mood disorder. As the evidence mounts, there is no denying the obvious ? that depression now qualifies fully as a disease.

Kramer suggests that the pervasiveness of the illness has distorted our impression of what it is to be human. He shows how a head-on look at depression as we now know it will change our sense of self, our tastes in art and in love, and our account of what it is to live a good life.

Against Depression is both thought-provoking and timely, a book that will result in a bold revision of our understanding of mood disorder and give hope to the millions who suffer from it.
