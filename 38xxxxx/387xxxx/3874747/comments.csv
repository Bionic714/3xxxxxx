,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:18Z,"For all listeners of Alex Jones and Coast to Coast AM, check out the following torrent:

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

People, don't get the other Endgame 2007 NTSC because it will take a long time for you to finish downloading it; there are only a few users that are seeding.

eastern876, I think it is better not to go that further. If it hasn't been heard in many years then it sounds to me that Mr. Jenkins himself hasn't been willing to release these tapes, right?
Anyways, as Alan Watt said, ""Stay away from ""Conspiracy Theories"" books- as they might be written by CIA's etc.

If you want to know the truth, go straight in the source; ready the books of Bertrand Russel and these other scumbags- they like to boast anyways- this where they let the cat out of the bag.

Peace!"
