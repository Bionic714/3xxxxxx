Khronos is the sixth full length album from Greek black metal band Rotting Christ.

Following Sleep of the Angels, the record continued to show the band's 
experimentation with doom and gothic metal musical elements, but also a return
to their more extreme earlier years as well. Some traces of Industrial music can 
also be heard, particularly in the band's cover of Current 93's "Lucifer over London".

It was produced by Peter TÃ¤gtgren's (Hypocrisy) Abyss Studios, whose                previous credits also include releases from Dimmu Borgir and Immortal.
