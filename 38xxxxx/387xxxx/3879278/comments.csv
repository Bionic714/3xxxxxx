,Saveno,2007-12-07T06:01Z,How do i burn to dvd.?  (newbie)
,RaversUnite,2007-12-07T11:24Z,What program do i need to copy this file to my computer? i have tried quick time and windows media player but none of them seem to recognise the program. Please help me. Thanks.
,victorbluff,2007-12-08T06:23Z,Saveno...You will need a program like WinAVI Video Converter to convert your downloads first & I find Ashampoo Burning Studio 7 is an easy to use burner
,victorbluff,2007-12-08T06:29Z,RaversUnite...I've had no trouble with VLC Media Player. 
,PPKLP,2007-12-15T18:52Z,"@Saveno: I think 'VSO ConvertXtoDVD' is the best way to burn this kind of movies to DVD. It's very easy and if you download a subtitle file you can also burn that to your DVD. Even include a simple menu...

@RaversUnite: *...copy this file to my computer?* I serriously hope you know how to get this to your computer. Try Utorrent or Azureus.. LMAO"
