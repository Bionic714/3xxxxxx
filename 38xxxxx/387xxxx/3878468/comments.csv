,sgwarrior,2008-11-30T08:21Z,I'm confused about how the install instruction. What directory do i remove it from and what is the game directory.
,sgwarrior,2008-12-01T01:24Z,I'm sorry about the second comment but i forgot to ask if i need some other program to install it. Please someone help

Use DAEMON Tools... download it somewhere, load up the .iso and install...
Don't worry every1 is an idiot at something :)!

,tyciol,2010-12-16T01:19Z,"Hm, a friend recommended this but if there's problems like needing a key (also is it in English?) then maybe I'll wait..."
,RunninJin,2011-02-09T05:30Z,"Hey X-PLODE
For some reason when I tried to extract the game, it said the file was corrupted or some such thing. I would try again but my computer is kinda acting slow. Gots nothin on it and everything is on a portable hdd to run everything. Any idea why it said it was corrupted?"
,Elicoor13,2011-11-28T01:55Z,"Hey, can anyone seed this?"
