Repacked, CG savefile, Walktroughs
Text Patch(to correct some leftover engrish...altough i still saw some typos o_O;)

Frikking huge DVD iso filled with like 1.5 gig of extra stuff, while the game itself is 600mb...i hate filling

Nontheless fun game with 800x600 graphics and a catchy opening movie/song






ohh and btw dont ask "how do i dl this game?" or "it asks for a key" cos il just ignore...
