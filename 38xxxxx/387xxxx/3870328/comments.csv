,kyinsweden,2007-12-08T20:13Z,"YES this does work. found it on a blog and i have try it on two different games. i do not take credit for this either .Go into the last game that you used the ZWT keygen on and it worked. Open the game folder and then open the ReflexiveArcade folder. Find the files that read Arcade.dat (it may even simply say just Arcade and the file extension might not be showing for you) and also find the reflexivearcade.dll file extension. Copy BOTH files and go to the new game you downloaded which the keygens no longer work on. Open the game folder, and then open it's ReflexiveArcade folder. Now PASTE both files into this folder and click YES TO ALL. Once you have done this, relaunch the game and use the same method to crack with the ZWT as you did before."
,kyinsweden,2007-12-08T20:16Z,Sorry i forgot i do not have the new windows so im unsure if it works for you. but i do not see why really. so for you vista people .who ever try it let the other know if someone do not mind
