,OrgyGuy,2008-09-14T20:42Z,"So all you modern day meth smoking ecstasy hippies with no cause think you can steal ""Hardcore"" from punk rockers? No. Hardcore is a faster style of punk rock, it isn't your herpe spreading rave music."
,MaliciousReqviem,2008-10-01T15:00Z,"OrgyGuy you are a true moron of the internet, please only use it for masturbatory purposes.  You have the IQ of the simple child who bakes cookies in whatever highschool you attend(ed).  

And most people don't even think of punk's brand of hardcore when the term is used anymore, people just think of those stupid emos attempting to be metal and sounding like an abortion involving Matt Heafy

This has nothing to do with ""ravers"" other than common electronic instruments used.  Gabbers are generally violent Europeans who highly enjoy causing havoc.  And Dron7297 thanks this torrent is bomb!"
,Diskriminator,2008-10-23T18:57Z,"thanks, great torrent"
