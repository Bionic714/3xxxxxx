,SephirothLQ,2007-11-03T21:39Z,Can anyone confirm that it is working and that it is the japanese version? I really need it.
,FreakinGreen,2007-11-08T14:56Z,"PLEASE HELP!!!! I know that you're supposed to unplugg the wii when its updating and then run through brickblocker. BUT i accidentally did the whole update. So , how do I get it to update again ?! thx ( maybe it doesn't work on this one but on the other SMG uploads on PB)"
,ozke,2007-11-12T09:35Z,Why download a japanese version?.... Wait for the english version instead

The MP3 update trick only works with NTSC-U version of the disc on PAL consoles. There is no known workaround for region compatibility for this title yet aside from what I just told you.

@ozke
Read what I wrote above. For people who own NTSC-J consoles, they can only play a backup of the NTSC-J disc. And hello? Some people are Japanese, thus, they want the game in the Japanese language? Is that too hard to comprehend?

And you've also got your facts wrong: The US version was leaked WAY before the Japanese version was even released to retail. No one needed to ""wait"" for the US version. We've been playing it for several weeks now."
,geekdll,2007-12-16T20:23Z,Download this and my NSTC wii v3.1u with WiiKey 1.9g doesn't read any of the disc I burn with this ISO. at all. And yes I know how to burn the game.
