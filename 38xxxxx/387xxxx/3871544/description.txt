This is Nero 8, but it comes in a small package, it won't take up 900MB of your Hard Drive. But the downside is this is the bare minium version of the program. It is good for people who don't need all the Fancy Applications. This basically allows you to Make CDS in all formats, such as DATA,MP3,WAV,"JUKEBOX CDS", DVDS, and you can copy discs. 

ENJOY... THIS IS A GOOD COPY NO VIRUSES, NO DRAMA, MUCH LOVE TO EVERYONE OUT THERE.
