> About the files:
> The "Looping Radio Mix" is just ripped from the portal files. and i
> compressed it to mp3 format to save on space. The "Phone Ringer" is one i
> mixed up using the radio mix as a background and several turret voices for
> some humor. They are both 128kbs/44.1khz/mono. Also these files have ONLY
> been tested on a Motorola Razr V3M so i don't know (or care) if they will
> work on your phone. if they don't try converting them to your format. But ON
> the razr, asuming how your network is set up (mine is AT&T) the "Phone
> Ringer" one i made ends with "I don't hate you" before it goes to voice mail.
> so it (just like the fact that you are adopted) is funny.
>
> Also. since you are obviously downloading these from a similiar tracker that i
> use, you can get the game from the following locations:
