,tsepash,2007-11-04T01:02Z,"connection is up, not that it seems to matter, seeding is going well :)"
,Bonofan,2007-11-05T02:12Z,"Great work tsepash , but not to the 19 that have 100% without seeding"
,cnc45,2007-11-05T11:24Z,"Dear tsepash,
I absolutly appreciate this caraoke files.
I really enjoy!
I just download free software Kara Fun from
www.karafun.com and it is working.
Can you recommend some different software 
for play this karaoke files???? 
Also can you brink more songs?"
,tsepash,2007-11-05T22:05Z,"thank you both, sorry bout the seeds, i seeded for a great while and if needed i will seed more, just let me know..

cnc45: I use media monkey, it is winamp based and all you have to do is get the winamp cdg plugin to play mp3+g files. Media monkey has a great user interface and search utility also.

I am hoping this upload will spur more ""decent"" karaoke uploads as most the stuff out there is out dated.



SEED ON!!!"
,cnc45,2007-11-06T09:29Z,"Thank you for answer. I am using WinAmp also......last 10 years maybe.....and sort time Media Monkey too...
Also I have great experience with Wabasco karaoke player for play .midi and .kar files.
Very good software for editing and compose .midi is Midi Maestro.... "
,tsepash,2007-11-06T09:42Z,"cnc45: when I play out i use two instances of media monkey along with fade amp, I like media monkey better than winamp because of the search feature.
I dont edit many karaoke songs I just buy them rip them and play them, so i dont have much use for midi karaoke songs."
,tbone76,2007-11-09T04:02Z,why did you rip the tracks with the vocal track? almost all of these have the guide vocals. 
,cuznjohn,2007-11-09T04:12Z,Sure wish there was someone seeding. I have been trying to download for days.
,tbone76,2007-11-09T04:18Z,"I am seeding right now, but I do not know for how much longer because most are the guide vocal tracks and not the karaoke instrumental track."
,tsepash,2007-11-09T15:34Z,"They are multiplex if you dont know what that is or how to deal with it..well..google :0), Basically the guide vocals are on one side of the stereo track, if you use winamp to play the files (or Media money as i said in previous post) you can DL the winamp plugin defx (winamp has a ton of mp+g plugins)
on defx there is a pan button..hit that and the guide vocals are unheard."
,tbone76,2007-11-10T02:20Z,"why pan? the discs come with a non vocal track, that is what I rip. then you can run in stereo without panning to one side only. this panning is just rediculous and unprofessional. I am a karaoke dj and know how this stuff works."
,tbone76,2007-11-10T02:21Z,"I will try to seed some real stuff for people, then you can see the difference."
,tsepash,2007-11-10T23:40Z,"these discs did not come with the non-vocal tracks, i am a professional KJ I know the differance..
these where actually ripped from SCDG discs, ya know what they are?  Anyway they are still perfectly usable and sound great and are newer than any of the other karaoke on here. I guess if you dont like them then dont DL, but dont try discouraging others please,  By the way, when you pan with the defx you still have music from both sides."
,tsepash,2007-11-11T00:30Z,I have posted another karaoke torrent.seed.ty
,tbone76,2007-11-16T14:35Z,I have uploaded some pretty new karaoke. here is the link. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3894828/new_karaoke.rar
,_Dradu_,2007-11-24T13:53Z,"tsepash, may I ask how you ripped these tracks?

I am especially interested in the She Wants Revenge songs. I have their original CD, is there a way to rip all the songs on the album to have this ""karaoke"" effect on them? Because I love it.

Is there a program you used, or did you have special disks?

Please write back."

,r00ted,2011-04-17T05:06Z,"I'm new to this karaoke/CD+G stuff, how exactly do I burn these files to a CD-R?  Do you burn them the same as regular mp3/audio CD?"
