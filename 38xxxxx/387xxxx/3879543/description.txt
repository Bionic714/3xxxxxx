The purpose of this Project is to give supporters a tool for spreading the freedom message of Congressman Ron Paul. This video will be updated as events unfold. We happily receive suggestions and recommendations from our fellow Ron Paul supporters. The full-quality video is available for viewing and downloading in multiple formats, we ask only for a voluntary donation to help us purchase equipment to duplicate DVDs and distribute them. The goal is simple, introduce the world to the only candidate that speaks for us, Ron Paul!

If you believe in this cause, please donate and let\\\\\\\'s make history.
