I encourage every person that believes in freedom of speech, freedom of property, beliefs, and freedom of market to at least try to get informed a little about Ron Paul.  Especially fans of The Pirate Bay and sights like this.  RP defends online gambling, and the rights of unregulated internet activities to conduct sites like this. He would not allow the WTO, and lobbyists to force other countries, i.e. Sweden to knuckle under to the MPAA like they tried to do to the TPB. He wants to shut down WTO,WTF,NAFTA and all the Beuracrat agencies engaging in Corporatism and profiteering against the little guy. Get this DVD and spread it far and wide!"

I stand by my statement- if Ron Paul is elected president, I will move to Israel."

This is a great DVD about a great man who really understands the real issues facing this country."
