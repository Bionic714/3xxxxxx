,RoachDaddyMoneyBags,2007-11-13T08:07Z,whats the deal with VOB? Chapters and extras? what do you do with the file when download is complete? do i need a special program or will it play on my VLC player? I would prefer this version but i dont have a dvd burner or dvd authoring software.
,RedDelPaPa,2007-11-18T00:05Z,"Roach, you burn them to DVD5.  You don't need to author anything.  Just burn them to dvd exactly as they are."
,spanish_for_shark,2008-03-02T23:52Z,"Roach,

Actually, you don't have to burn it to DVD. If you'd rather just watch it on your computer without writing it, just open the directory that contains the VOBs in the DVD drive on your computer and it should play just like a DVD would.

example: open your DVD player. hit ctrl+o on PC, Apple+o on a mac, and then select the folder that contains the files."
