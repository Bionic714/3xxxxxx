,HÃ¥kan_LJ,2007-11-21T18:23Z,"The main feature doesn't seem to work, only the extras. I've tried the ""feature.evo""-files with vlc, powerdvd, windvd, mpc.. is it corrupted?"
,Neuromods,2008-01-29T13:58Z,Same happens with me when I was playing HDtops version of Die Hard 4. Only extras play and not the main movie. How can this be fixed. I even burned it as an ISO on a blu ray and would not work.
