,wanda_5,2007-11-09T06:34Z,"Yeah, why mp4?
Btw it's real. Poor quality but it works."
,schmolch,2007-11-09T19:20Z,"Gotta love those ipod codes.

3% smaller file, half the video-quality.

Good deal, get it NOW!!!!"
,simtelevision,2007-11-09T23:55Z,Weird but yes this is real. Dunno why it's mp4 format. But it is the correct ep - water heaters go boom. Why is Kari on crutches ??
