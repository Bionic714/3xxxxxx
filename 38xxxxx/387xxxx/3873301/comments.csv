,97036,2007-11-08T12:58Z,You are not a releasegroup so stop trying to name it in a cool way. And FYI aXXo is just some bitch stealing and re-naming real releases.

,cj_,2008-10-11T02:34Z,"Differences in runtime between PAL (european) and NTSC (american) movies tend to be because of the framerate (25 vs. 29.97).  One literally runs faster, but it's imperceptible to humans.  By the end of the movie it will have drifted a few minutes.

,mohiergauth,2011-04-12T17:28Z,"Would someone explain to me what ""THis movie is full screen, not flat screen"" means. lulz

Joo cannot haz cheezburger"
,laned130,2011-05-05T15:53Z,"@moheirgauth

""fullscreen not flatscreen"" means it has an aspect ratio closer to 4:3 (old-TV size) rather than 16:9 (cinema/flatscreen/widescreen).

The aspect ratio is the ratio of the film's width to height. It is normally listed in lowest-common-denominator form, or as a decimal.

To give an example - if your PC is relatively new, it may have a resolution of 1280x800, which is a ratio of 8:5, or more commonly referred to as 16:10 (1280/800=8/5=16/10). However, older PCs normally came with screen resolutions of 640x480 (VGA), 1024x768, or 1600x1200, which are ratios of 4:3 (1600/1200=1024/768=640/480=4/3).

Aspect ratios are also often given as decimals, because they are easier to compare if they're all to the same base:
16:9=1.78
1280x768=15:9=1.67 (another common widescreen-PC resolution)
16:10=1.6
6""x4""=15:10=1.5 (standard size for photographs)
4:3=1.33
1:1=1 (a square)

Solamande's link gives a lot of good information about Kubrick's feelings on aspect ratio.

As stated, if you have a copy of The Shining in widescreen, it has been cropped. However, nearly all films are cropped for the cinema, and all directors film with that in mind. Kubrick started as a still photographer, and always preferred the full frame. He also preferred that the hove video release of The Shining be in full frame (1.37). However, no-one can be sure that, had he been alive to witness the advent of DVD's and widescreen TV's, he wouldn't have opted to release in 16:9, or at least given people the choice.

In conclusion, there are two things to remember:
1 - Kubrick's surviving family and staff have decided (presumably feeling it most loyal to Kubrick's wishes) to release his back catalogue in full frame only, and not give people the choice.
2 - If you really have a preference, you can always crop it yourself. If your player doesn't have the option, you can always use VLC. Is it not better to have the complete film, even if only for posterity?

Many thanks for the up, ricbri!"
