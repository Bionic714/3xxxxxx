,Razorbladesoup,2007-11-04T05:19Z,"not true
i still have the file on a cd somewere
it was about this size
and it was road rash 3 for pc
but it wasnt all one file"
,Bob__Dole,2011-11-30T02:58Z,"The original Road Rash for PCs was about 27MB installed, it is very unlikely a subsequent Road Rash 3 would be only 1.7MB even as a compressed archive file.

It might be a ROM or something for a game emulator, not for PC/windows."
