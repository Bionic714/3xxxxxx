I've downloaded this torrent, installed it correctly, etc. 

But its not running as well as I would like it to. Do you know if the 256 MB NVidia Quadro NVS 140M graphics card is sufficient to run this game well without freezing or running slowly?

My system is as follows:

Intel Core 2 Duo T7300 2.00 GHz Processor
2 GB RAM
32-bit bus"

Just follow instructions the uploader wrote here on this web page, rather than the read me text file included in the download. The only problem i have is with the right joystick on my ps2 controller that i use on my pc. Every time i push up and down on the joystick, the screen looks to the sides.Every time i push to the sides on the joystick, the screen looks up and down.I dont know if i'm the only one with this problem.But on the keyboard all the buttons are right.But the main thing is that it works.Just follow instructions."
