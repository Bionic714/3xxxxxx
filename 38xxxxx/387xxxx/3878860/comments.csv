What exactly did you do to these? ;)"
,valtameri,2007-11-21T16:40Z,"Well, 

Ripped and encoded using CDex, and Flac from homesite.

I also have the problem with time, but i thought it be nice to share the flac version of TDS.

You can alway decode it to WAV and burn it.

Thanks for response

No EAC?
silly children"
,omicrondelta,2008-04-02T20:33Z,"Well that ""timing bug"" mentioned above for track 10 is inaccurate.  That is the way the track is on an actual CD, at least on the one I used to have back-in-the-day..

However there is a timing bug.  Every track seems to be 3 hours and 22 seconds long.  I've fixed the flacs downloaded in this torrent on my machine and anyone interested for quality flacs encoded at the encoders highest settings 'flac -8 *.wav' then send me a msg..."
