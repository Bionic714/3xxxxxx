,Staple,2007-11-09T00:31Z,There's two albums by The Who named Quadrophenia. Is this the older one or the soundtrack from the 1979 movie.
,oktan,2007-11-10T23:21Z,there is only ONE quadrophenia album by the who and its the 1979 rockopera soundtrack. 
,qualitylow,2007-11-25T19:49Z,"Quadrophenia was released in 1973. In 1979 The Who released a ""Soundtrack"" to coincide with the release of the film based on the original rock opera. That album also has music from other bands on it. 

Maybe if you actually bought a CD once in awhile you'd know a thing or two about music. "
,eddie864,2011-04-17T02:37Z,Ooh a bit unfair.  Most people are only aware of the movie songtrack.  The original album is much better with longer tracks that aren't fully featured in the songtrack of the movie.
