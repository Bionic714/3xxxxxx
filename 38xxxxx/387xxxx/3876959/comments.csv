,AIMBOT,2007-11-07T18:21Z,So are you selling it or what ?  I want a serial or crack or patch or keys so I can actually use it  ...
,froli,2007-11-07T18:30Z,Is it Cracked or just the trial copy...?
,ROCKnTIME,2007-11-07T19:26Z,A crack is not available at this time. You can either download the 30-day trial from Eset or use the following user name and password on this full version until they (user name/Password) expire.  (User name = essbeta)( Password = essbeta)
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2007-11-08T00:23Z,"The beta username and password works, but we need a crack/fix to extend the trial..  Hopefully someone is working on this.."
