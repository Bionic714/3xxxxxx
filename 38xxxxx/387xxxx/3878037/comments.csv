Temple of Doom is my most popular torrent, so I'm putting all my bandwidth towards it, in the hopes that once I get some seeders from there, I can then restart seeding the other two again.  Sorry guys, but I think this will work out being fastest for everyone."
[T],brycetheman1,2007-11-30T04:26Z,what program do you use for converting movies?
,mslovely101,2008-01-13T15:16Z,I use the WinAvi Converter. 
,AramisTG,2008-01-21T06:53Z,"Thanks for the torrents! I got your Temple torrent and the quality was great, well worth the download.

Any chance you can seed this one for a few days to help us all out? Last I checked there were 11 of us stuck at 90.1%. Can't speak for everyone, but I will leave it seeding to help you out if you can manage.

Thanks again!"

I've been searching for a torrent of the Rocket Robin Hood series for years. You wouldn't happen to have some or all, would you? 

    The title song rocks!"
