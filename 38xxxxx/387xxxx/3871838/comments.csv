Much appreciated "
,casperboo,2007-12-12T04:22Z,"The fact that you are asking how to get this to work tells me that this is the first time you have tried a warezed game for the PSP.

In order to use this, you MUST have custom firmware installed and not the firmware that came with your PSP.

In order to get custom firmware, you need a patched PSP Batter, also known as a Pandora Battery.  You can buy one on eBay or look for someone in your town that patches PSP's for a fee.

Once you have new firmware (I suggest M33-3 by Dark Angel) you can then run these ISO ripped images off of your memory card."
