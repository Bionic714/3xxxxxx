,THEADreaNaL,2007-11-07T15:25Z,"Search on google for ""Combined-Community-Codec-Pack-2007-07-22""... download and install it... this pack contains the required codecs...u`ll then b able to play MKV files on WMP!"
,drainbread,2007-11-12T14:10Z,"Don't forget to tell them that installing the CCCP pack can kill all your other codecs...

People that incode oddball formats/codecs suck."
