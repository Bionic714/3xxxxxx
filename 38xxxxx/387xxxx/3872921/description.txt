I mourn the loss of oink.cd by uploading everything I got from there that is not on TPB yet :)    Please do the same if you were a member.


from wikipedia:
Pedigree Chump is the debut album from the British ska punk band [spunge]. It was released following the success of the Kicking Pigeons EP pressed a year earlier that sold 5000 copies to early followers at pub gigs.

The first 3,000 copies of the album included a five track bonus CD of live recordings. The standard album was re-released in December 2000 as a limited edition digipak without the bonus tracks. In 2004, the album was again re-released as a limited edition in a slipcase. The bonus tracks were bundled back onto this version, plus a rare demo of \\\'Make Me Happy\\\' and an enhanced video of \\\'Kicking Pigeons\\\'.

No singles were ever released from Pedigree Chump. However, the song \\\'Kicking Pigeons\\\' can be found on the Kicking Pigeons EP and an updated version of the same song is the second A-side on Live Another Day/Kicking Pigeons 2001, a single from their next album Room For Abuse.

\\\'Intro\\\' and \\\'Have Another Go\\\' are short comedic tracks mainly comprising of people talking in strange accents. Also, at the end of \\\'Whinger\\\' there is a hidden comedy track about custard. It is speculated that the track \\\'Ode 2 Slimy Bassless\\\' is about former [spunge] bassist Simon Bayliss.
