[V],Kuthumi,2007-12-11T09:35Z,"Still stuck at 80%. This torrent has not been properly seeded for more than a month now. The tracker sometimes shows 1 seeder, but no-one gets anything from him. I have reported possible tracker problems to PB, but there's nothing they can do if the uploader doesn't seed."
