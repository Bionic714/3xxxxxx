Ogg Vorbis is a license free codec that offers superior quality per bitrate compared to mp3. For more information on playing/converting it visit:

,enduser,2007-12-22T18:46Z,Why would you upload in OGG form? Can anyone put up the discography in any normal format?
,K0RI,2008-01-24T04:42Z,"I don't have a fuckin' OGG PLAYER..

,gritswantd,2008-05-22T02:15Z,"OGG is a fucking joke.  It may be better than MP3, but no one uses it.  No one has posted/linked a freeware version of something that can decode this shit.  KNOCK IT OFF WITH THE OGG BULLSHIT!"
,gritswantd,2008-05-23T23:57Z,"This torrent is worthless... no one uses FLAC.  You can try this one instead... I am seeding right now, so let's team up and get the whole thing!

,.ToJa,2008-06-18T10:27Z,"OGG is great, if you don't like it, then go find another torrent! Or you can find a better music player like MediaMonkey http://mediamonkey.com/"
