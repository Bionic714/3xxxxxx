News, I mean.  Does it work correctly?"
,CheezuzKraist,2007-11-07T14:39Z,"Didn't install on my machine. I have other (older) pirate programs from adobe on my machine and I haven't been able to install any CS3 suite progs. They check registry or some other place to ensure legallity of install. I have tried to clean up registry, disconnect internet (of course) and uninstall all other pirate progs - but nothing will help me to install CS3 -suite... F*ck!!!"
,StretchUk,2007-11-14T11:36Z,"Get a file called CS3 clean. Uninstall everything. Ensure all folders have been deleted. Reboot. Use CS3 Clean. Wait forever for it to work.
Reboot. Install this. Do not run it!! Copy the crack over and voila. Most other CS3 products work the same. If you mess them up at all it's shit city."

,cangoalie,2007-12-09T02:19Z,"What if the uninstaller isn't working? Is it possible just to use CS3Clean by itself?
Also, is it necessary to back up the hard drive first?
