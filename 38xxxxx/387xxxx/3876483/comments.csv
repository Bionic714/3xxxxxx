,goofy_root,2007-11-13T01:44Z,The book of 2nd Corinthians is missing!
,Tamarind777,2008-05-10T05:37Z,"Thanks very much for this! By the way, it's NOT First Corinthians that's missing, but  First Thessalonians. 

Again, Thanks!"
[T],verifire,2008-05-11T12:53Z,"Great upload! Best dramatized Bible I've ever heard! And 2nd Corinthians is in there, it just got misplaced in the folder of the Colossians. After you've downloaded, just create a new folder with the name ""08 2 Corinthians"", open ""Colossians"", cut and paste. Voila!! :-)"
[T],verifire,2008-05-11T12:57Z,"..And by the way: 1st Thessalonians is in there, right where it's supposed to be.. :-)"
,Tamarind777,2008-05-11T15:43Z,"goofy_root, is right and I am wrong. I made a mistake with another Bible I have that's also missing something. Second Corinthians IS missing, as stated earlier."
