 MSDos setting,works everytime. 
However it only allows the option to connect by phone modem .
Dosen't matter howmany times i reload it and pick cable or lan.
Once its booted ...no connection and the only option is phone modem.
Anybody know how to fix this?
Everything else works fine.

,PROTEOUS271158,2009-03-19T02:42Z,"GOT IT ! 
USED  IlanF  link and followed instrns no probs getting online now. just follow the instructions ,but you have to load the sys then shut it down and replace the lines of code.
friggin sis board keeps me from sound though. ay any body? 
o ,and be sure once you boot up to shut off the screensaver and power saver and stuff.
after that use the rest of the instructions to go into bios and shut off the shit ya don't need.
Thanks again ,eh! little help with the sound thing ,would be abit o' FERENGI UMOX .
