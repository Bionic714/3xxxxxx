The show centres on Jimmy Reardon (Tracey), one of Vancouver's top organized
crime bosses, and Mary Spalding (Scott), the director of the Vancouver Organized
Crime Unit (OCU), who has offered Reardon immunity from prosecution in exchange
for his role as a police informant. The show also stars Matt Frewer as Ted
Altman, the scheming assistant director of the OCU who seeks to replace
Spalding, and John Cassini as Ronnie Delmonico, Reardon's business partner and
confidant.

The show's cast also includes Tom McBeath, John Mann, and David Green as CSIS
directors; Eugene Lipinski and Andrew Airlie as colleagues of Spalding; and
Bernie Coulson and Camille Sullivan as Reardon's brother and ex-wife.

Reardon and Spalding are parallel characters working together on opposite sides
of the law. Both have followed in the family footsteps, and both face threats
from others trying to derail their careers. Reardon represents the 3rd
generation of his west coast crime family, that began with his prohibition era
bootlegging grandfather. Conversely, Spalding has her roots as the daughter of
an ex-army intelligence officer. Spalding must constantly watch herself against
the conniving Assistant Director Altman who is after her position, and the old
school CSIS Regional Director Deakins, for whose job she is the leading
candidate. For Reardon, it is the Disciples (Outlaw Motorcycle Club), led by
Dante Ribiso (Fulvio Cecere), whose aim is to control the whole of Vancouver's
marijuana trade and ABM money laundering industry.
