I cant say that I agree with him but I understand what he means. It's radical thinking, but you can't say that he is wrong in my opinion.

I think though, that the democracy is the best form of ideology. No, let me refraise, it's the least bad ideology.

I also think, that if the majority of people voted that everybody should be allowed to shoot whoever they wanted, it should be allowed. It's radical I know. 

This raises the question: What if a country voted for a war against another country and it passed, is that then right and should it be allowed? And what is it that the USA is doing and has been doing since IIWW.

Does anybody have the video that was deleted from youtube??"
