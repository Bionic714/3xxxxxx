,TheKingfish,2007-11-12T04:01Z,1962 or 2004 version?
,Lythimus,2007-12-22T21:44Z,The IMDB link which seems to be manually assigned directs to the 2004 version.
,brandeded,2008-03-23T22:31Z,"Just to be clear, this is the 2004 version."
,brandeded,2008-03-23T22:33Z,"This is also poorly cropped (cuts off the bottom, and probably the top).  This is probably a nuked SCR, but for some reason it's got the most seeds.

Anyway... watchable."
,Savri,2008-04-25T22:06Z,This 1 has cuts on top and and bottom i suggest finding normal version

,Capn_Cunt,2010-01-08T01:44Z,"bullshit i downloaded it fine and no boogeyman got me, ass plug."
,lord_frik,2010-10-26T01:27Z,"For a file that is almost 1 gig, the quality is mediocre at best; the cropping is horribly done and cuts off a fair amount of the top and bottom of the screen. i guess it could be watchable if you dont care, but i couldnt make it five minutes without wanting to download a different torrent"
,sleepitoff,2010-10-31T13:04Z,I'd recommend downloading a different one since the top and bottom of the frame are cut off of this one.
,sleepitoff,2010-10-31T13:07Z,I'd recommend downloading a different one as this one has its top and bottom cut off.
