,Stretix,2007-12-04T05:24Z,"Alright - I'm having troubles running the game- I mounted and installed, I then ran YASU, cloaked what was already checked for me, minimized the window, and tried running the game. When I try running the game I get this error message: RendererOGL error: 

Card doesn't supporty EXT_Texture_Compression_s3tc. See console.log for details.
