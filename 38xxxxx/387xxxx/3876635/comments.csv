,j0hneb0y81,2007-11-12T23:32Z,"hmm, not uploaded by aXXo, but it is real.."
,Rompe Cabasito,2007-11-13T06:10Z,"Lord aXXo has left the building... 

He is not dead. 
He is not busted, nicked, or compromised in any way...

aXXo and the Bay are at an impasse... 

Before you jump to conclusions, remember this about BOTH aXXo and the Bay :
Both are Givers, 
Both have noble concerns (yes, pirates can be noble), 
Both separately earned a name for themselves by great efforts, risks, & sacrifices, 
Both deserves respect and protection.
Both are 'marked for death' by the greedy,
Both face daily attacks of desperate & sneaky measures.
Both have benefited from their allegiance.

The Bay has other uploaders, and aXXo has other sites.

Presently, the significant indicators are: 
He still has a Bay account, AND, he has not been banned, 
He has removed half, and, left half of his uploads, (why and what happened is not for me to 'ass-u-me'... he does not owe us an explanation, they were his to share when and where he chooses.

There is alot of 3rd party hearsay that points to: 
 He left the Bay to protect you (us), the Bay, and himself. 
By protecting you he protects himself and vica-versa. 
If you cannot understand that then sometimes you need to trust the judgment of the Robin Hood who has given so much, to so many, for so long... and asked so little in return: 'to seed equal to what you enjoy'... If he has fed you for years, would you not protect his plate when his back was turned ? 

 Too many creeps (like this suspect, 'ionutprocaci') were pretending to be him, and although some efforts were made by the Bay to delete disrespectful fakes and deliberate IP logging bait traps. (by using his name as a stamp of quality that they have not earned... and worse yet, who does it backfire on... aXXo... There is a real fleet of operatives (and competitors) trying to take down BOTH aXXo  AND the Bay from the inside... most are OBVIOUS, and many are not... USE YOUR BEST BULLSHIT FILTER !!!

Maybe he will come back, (maybe he won't, although, he is not known for holding a grudge, but he does not forget).
Maybe the Bay will increase Quality Assurance and Uploader Support. (maybe they won't).
Maybe this is what it takes to force changes. (maybe this is the best evolution can do).
Maybe both have gotten too big for their hats.(maybe it's just growing pains).
Maybe 'Censorship', 'Risk Assessment', and 'Free Speech' have formulas yet to be discovered... by those willing to deserve them.

'nuff said... Namaste.

,Sayril,2007-12-05T00:19Z,i hate ppl that fakes aXXo
