Temple of Doom is my most popular torrent, so I'm putting all my bandwidth towards it, in the hopes that once I get some seeders from there, I can then restart seeding the other two again.  Sorry guys, but I think this will work out being fastest for everyone."

,entightenment,2008-12-09T10:09Z,"Hey Rocket,

I've been searching for a torrent of the Rocket Robin Hood series for years. You wouldn't happen to have some or all, would you? 

    The title song rocks!"
