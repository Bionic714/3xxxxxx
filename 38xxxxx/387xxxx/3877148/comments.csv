,FrankTheTankLives,2007-12-06T18:44Z,It works just like it should.  There were website I could not eplore because USA connections were blocked and now I can view them.  The only thing is that when it is on every page that I go to loads so SLOW and as soon as I shut it off it goes back to being fast again.  I s that just how the software is?  Otherwise thanks for the upload.

,firecatcher,2007-12-17T15:30Z,"got it to work eventually but on reading FAQ's found out it doesn't work p2p which is what i wantd it for.

Anyone know of a proxy that does?"
,danzig-7766,2007-12-20T17:49Z,"@firecatcher you have to get the ip addy and port# that the program is using then enter it manually in your torrent client or in limeshit or what ever your using then it will work.

This is a good prg but sometimes if the server they give you is not english the sites you visit will be in that language which can be a pain in the ass."

,KOWOAOO,2008-01-24T23:53Z,"Thanks for the upload.. but I get a error message when i write in the serial for the application. the error

""3.5 is not a vaild floating point value"""
,SVOJ08,2008-01-29T22:54Z,Works great! Thanks.........!
,SVOJ08,2008-01-30T11:03Z,"To KOWOAOO: ""3.5 is not a vaild floating point value""

I found solution for you:
This problem typically only occurs in parts of Europe where the decimal separator is a comma rather than a period. Your system is expecting a ""3,5"", and gets upset when it sees a ""3.5"". 

To correct this problem, go to the Control Panel, click on Regional Settings and in the tab labeled ""Number"", change the Decimal symbol from a comma to a period. (""."" instead of "",""). 

This will make the problem go away, but might cause problems with other software that is working properly for European settings. "
