,menerd,2007-11-11T20:26Z,"When the hell are people going to realize that splitting movies into two for VCDs is fucking useless.  Go out and buy yourself a fucking DivX capable DVD player and you can put up to 5 movies on ONE blank dvd!!  Honestly, people have to stop splitting movies..."
,menerd,2007-11-11T20:26Z,Sorry about the swearing....i'm just sick of it.

I have an Xvid codec installed but still no luck. Any help?"

MCLOVIN is the man!"
,stupid m0nkey,2007-11-12T12:57Z,"OMG why do people always rar videos and iso's 

IT MAKES IT HARDER TO SEED"
,scientificz,2007-11-12T13:39Z,"Whats the matter with all you with all the fucking negative complaints from you pussy's,  this if perfect quality both video and sound. I got a fast download rate got no problems unpacking the files,  no sound problems what the fuck people respect to the uploader peace scientific"
,midimo,2007-11-12T15:27Z,imdb.com gives it a very good rating. Obivously this is a very popular movie. There must be a lot of very simple people out there. What a stupid movie. 
,rct999,2007-11-13T00:34Z,i hate rar :(
,niplah,2007-11-13T12:50Z,"@ midimo

imbd gives it a great rating, most other comments think this is very funny and just because YOU dont like it everyone else is simple,

Maybe you should download yourself a sense of fucking humour. ASSHOLE"
,BadB420,2007-11-14T05:53Z,"This movie is hilarious and calling everyone simple just makes you look like a big friendless nerd who has no sense of humor.  Go watch some Woody Allen movies and remember the ""good old day's"" when movies weren't funny."
,hpcd2,2007-11-14T10:20Z,"Video Quality:

,Monkehtron,2007-11-15T23:32Z,"People don't dislike rar because they don't know how to use it, people dislike rar because it means in order to seed they have to have both the extracted video files and the 40+ split files.

Plus, you don't gain anything because compressed video files can't be compressed again. And as for the 'downloading in parts means your isp can't tell your downloading hundreds of 700mb films' idea. Bittorrent transfer protocol splits files into parts anyway.

But still, cheers for the upload."
,dk-champ,2007-11-17T17:34Z,Hey Ty... Hmm... wich pogram are you using to se the film???
,y3n007,2007-11-23T07:56Z,"menerd knows better, get the DVD player with DivX I have one and it's great, why rar or iso files, rar files are hard to fuck with and if some thing is wrong all you have to do is redownload the rar file that got messed up, iso is for stupid people who don't know how to burn movies unless they convert them to I don't know what format they know how to use, it takes time to post stuff so be nice and just watch it or go pay the 10 bucks to see at the movies or wait the six months until the DVD comes out"
