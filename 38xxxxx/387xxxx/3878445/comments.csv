For the record tho, Temple of the Dog is it's own band, not Soundgarden... It's Stone Gossard and someone else from Pearl Jam, and Chris Cornell and someone else from Soundgarden. It was a tribute to one of their mutual friends..."
,Schanul,2007-12-04T13:33Z,"The mutual friend was Andrew Wood, who was the lead singer for Mother Love Bone. After he died they attracted a new singer, Eddie Vedder and started a new band, called Pearl Jam."
,photo4art,2007-12-06T19:43Z,Hey guys have you got Mother Love Bone and Tribute to Andrew Wood. If so PLEASE upload :))))
,ryankc414,2008-04-29T22:11Z,"This band is a combo of Eddie Veder (Pearl Jam), Layne Staley (Alice in Chains) and Chris Cornell (Soundgarden)"
,Nepacha,2008-05-18T22:00Z,"This so kewl! I wont be grabbing this but I had to comment anyways! This is the shit, for all you who dont know...Soundgarden and Mother Love Bone( becoming Pearl Jam...with Eddie Vedder on vox later) is kickin it on this album wich is an tribute or goodbye if you will to the singer in Mother Love Bone- Andrew Wood who died of a H O.D....So this is NOT Soundgarden but there on it! Download this...one of the best rock albums ever!! Wat to go uploader!!"
,The1Robb,2012-01-27T11:53Z,"OK. So, it is the ENTIRE Soundgarden band. The REMAINING MEMBERS of Mother Love Bone. That's it! Yes, Eddie Vedder is featured on Hunger, singing with Chris Cornell. Mike McCreedy is the solo guitarist on the 12 minute track. I don't believe Layne Staley is on it at all. So, recap. Soundgarden as a whole. Remaining Mother Love Bone Members Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, Bruce Fairweather, and Greg Gilmore. Plus, at least one track featuring Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder and Mike McCreedy. Got all of that?"

And Finally, yes it WAS a tribute to the late, could've been great if it wasn't for ODing on drugs, Andy Wood, who was the frontman for Malfunkshun before Mother Love Bone. Got all of that?"
,abernick00,2012-02-17T11:02Z,"Layne Staley was not in Temple of the Dog... the singers you would recognize would be Chris Cornell from Soundgarden, his Solo stuff, and Audioslave,,,, the other is Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam.... The rest The1Robb said is the truth.... Layne Staley???  ppl who don't know their music shouldn't even comment...."
,abernick00,2012-02-17T11:03Z,"thanks to the uploader though@!!! this is an album many ppl do not know about, and it's great@!"
