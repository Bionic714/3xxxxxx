,Vinodino,2007-11-15T14:40Z,i cant open the rar files why?
,FinalSword,2007-11-16T03:45Z,Because there are no rar files. They are .iso files. Open them with daemon tools or Alcohol 120%.
,catchaserguns,2007-11-26T06:48Z,This also can be opened bu Nero. Just right click the file and click open with... and click Nero rom
,BlazingFenix,2007-12-20T07:55Z,"Thanks so much!!! 
been looking for this since I played a demo in the 2000's"
,timzon,2008-02-04T15:14Z,".iso files can be mounted and viewed using Virtual Clone Drive from Slysoft. It is freeware made by the same company that makes CloneCD and CloneDVD. Works very well, is simple to use, and it even works on the piece of shit operating sytem, Vista. To find it, just Google it.     

P.S. Can't wait to play this game, the screen shots look amazing just by themselves."
,FinalSword,2008-02-14T05:26Z,"haha awesome! it's good to know that people are still keeping this torrent alive. 

...in all honesty, i completely forgot i even put that up here. sorry :(
ill seed some tonight.

sorry the demonoid .txt file is in there, i forgot to remove it from the torrent after put it up here. 

alcohol 120% has always worked the best for me. it's not that the rest of them don't work, it's that its layout and stuff fits me better haha

but yeah, i hope you all enjoy the game! i know i did which is why i beat it a few times. 

the total amount of people that play this game online in a week is about 5. don't worry, you aren't missing anything without online play. although i strongly encourage purchasing this game since it's a classic and possibly the online community could get a couple more people. who knows?"
