,Italian_Banker,2007-11-11T07:18Z,"great movie, some may find it boring. the whole thing takes place in one location. if you don't require exploding cars and helicopters crashing into buildings, you will probably be intrigued by this film.

,defaultchoice,2007-11-18T11:15Z,"A very logical movie. It kept me entertained for the entire movie, without explosions, sex, or profanity. This is a great movie that leaves you wondering till the very end. 

Movie Quality: 100%
Film Rating: 79%"

,doubleosix,2008-02-05T06:37Z,"My name is Richard Schenkman, and I directed ?Jerome Bixby?s The Man From Earth?, as well as co-producing it with Eric Wilkinson. We are flattered as well as humbled by the outpouring of affection our movie has received from the P2P community, which has shared the film amongst itself by the tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands). Were it not for these many, many people ? all across the globe ? downloading the movie and then posting about it at IMDB.com, RLSLog.net, and many other places, word would not have spread the way it has. However?.
Our feeling is this: while it?s lovely to be the subject of all sorts of online buzz, it sure didn?t do much to help the people who financed ?Snakes on a Plane?. The fact is that we put a lot of our own money into this movie, and convinced a number of friends and family to do the same. Despite a US domestic DVD deal, we are nowhere near breakeven on the movie. Below 50%, if you want to know the truth.
It seems that more than 200,000 people have downloaded the film, and the vast majority (I?d say 85-90%) seem to like or love the movie.
Most of these people live outside the US, and so the DVD is not officially for sale in their country. Frankly we have no idea when it will be. Same goes for any sort of TV sale.
So we had the idea (truth be told, my wife had the idea) to pull a Radiohead? to reach out to the online community and say, ?If you downloaded this movie and liked it, please buy the DVD; and if you can?t buy the DVD where you live, please send us some money.? Some people have sent the equivalent of a one-night rental, some the equivalent of purchasing a DVD, and some have made truly significant donations (which we appreciate more than we can say).
It seems only fair to pay for entertainment which was always meant to be sold, and I can tell you, as an independent filmmaker, the only way we can make MORE interesting, different, intelligent movies is if we don?t lose our shirts on this one!
Thanks very much? and here?s the email address if you feel like sending in your offering via PayPal: EWilkinson100@comcast.net. You can also link to the ?donate? button at our own web site, www.manfromearth.com.
Sincerely,
Richard Schenkman"
,atlantisisdead,2008-08-31T03:23Z,"The truth is that the majority of people who download movies, music, etc., are mostly people who wouldn't buy it retail anyway. So they aren't out the kind of profits they say they are. If I couldn't download Man From Earth, trust me, I wouldn't buy it. When I was a pre-teen, cassette tapes and dual cassette players were becoming real popular. Mostly to play a friend's tape to record it for yourself. Music Industry complained. Look at them .. they sure have suffered. By the way, Thanks for the torrent."
