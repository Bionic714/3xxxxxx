,hotfuzz3,2007-11-03T09:36Z,imdb says movie runs for 113minutes this says 91minutes
,hotfuzz3,2007-11-03T10:02Z,you also can't see vampire text
[T],Ltt_Fr1,2007-11-03T14:21Z,"For Information: (excuse me for bad English.)

1/ I always included the sample in my torrents so that you can juged yourself.

2/ I never compress the files of my torrents.
Useless zip or rar the avi file; this is probably fake if its requirring password !!!

3/ Quality in order of increasing: CAM, TELESYNC(TS), DVDSCR, R5, DVD(Rip).

You always have the runtime of NTSC's encoded (23.976 Pics/s) is longer than the PAL's encoded (25 Pics/s).
In more this is the cam, the cameraman cuts the text at the end of the movie !!!.

Thank and Enjoy."

FYI,
A second is a second whether you view 30 frames in that second or 25 frames.  The file size may be bigger or smaller but the time doesn't change.  And NTSC is 29.9 not 23.9.  Nice try."

,DolphWulff,2007-11-10T22:12Z,"Oh, btw, grash54: you're ignorant in saying that a second is a second regardless of being 30fps or 25fps. Theoretically, it's true, except that when telecining 24fps film to NTSC (30fps) you can do that with some mixed frames and stuff, while doing telecining to PAL (25fps), the most used method is actually to speed up the 24fps to 25fps which means that the runtime is shorter. Don't believe this, just use Google. Cheers, and fuck off. :)"

,adamduh,2007-11-15T04:00Z,you people are assholes for pushing away axxo. if you google him you can still find his new torrents. but fuck off to the people that hated him
,Fysle,2007-11-15T19:39Z,I totally agree with Beyondish. Why do people download TS movies? It's so important for the total movieexperience that the quality is good.. It has to be real good actually. Why not just wait till dvd-rip release? There are som amny good rips out there. Or are there people here that has actually seen all the movies available on the net?
,MEvsEVERYBODY,2007-11-16T16:19Z,Some people like to sample a movie before they actually blow money on seeing it in the theater or buy the DVD. Damn we're crazy!

,DogNo7,2007-11-17T08:08Z,"From what I could tell from the blurbs on Axxo, he let the MPAA get the better of him, at least psychologically, and he lost.

He let petty things affect his judgment, and he deleted all of his torrents in a fit of prepubescent rage.

Too F'ing Bad.

Other people will take his place.

This is the way it works in the real world, and to some extent, it is the way things work on the internet, at least while people are the primary users.

When computers become more intelligent than humans, they will get tired of us in a few picoseconds, and kill us all a few picoseconds later.

So it goes.

,grash54,2007-11-17T22:04Z,"DolphWulff - FYI -> A telesync is a video copy of the movie which was shot in a cinema, often with a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth, with a direct connection to the sound source (often FM audio provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theatre). A telesync is a special type of cam that has the potential of better-quality audio and video. If the telesync is shot from within the projection booth there will be no keystone distortion (there will be keystone correction) of the video.  The movie is missing about 20 minutes and you can't read the vampire captions so perhaps you should Google it you moron.
Oh and by the way, suck my dick you gay fuck moron.  Have a nice day."

,wolvy23,2007-11-23T03:23Z,"Graph54.  Actually you made a fool of yourself, a Telesync is a cam simply plugged into the place for deaf people.  So the sound is ok, but the picture is totally CAM quality.

What you described, however is a TC or TeleCine. Not a TeleSync (TS).  TC is plugging direct into the projector to record your copy and its as good as any screener.  Your as bad as anyone else, not learning your formats, thus mislabeling the films constantly.  I really hate it when people confuse TC and TS and after all this time, Im amazed people are still confused about the obvious differences between the two."
