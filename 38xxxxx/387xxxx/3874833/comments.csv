,zapoide007,2007-11-06T23:32Z,ill give it a try and post back if it works or not 
,abktw2,2007-11-07T03:25Z,The quality on this one is poor.  It looks very digitized and the audio seems to be out of sync.  Tried it with Media Player and VLC.  I would look elsewhere

,jetten,2010-09-24T13:37Z,"Yes. the audio is slightly out of sync, maybe 0,5s as most. Not too bad.
and in the metadata it reads Created with SUPER(C) so one can understand why it's not perfect quailty."
