In this comedy we meet 30 year old BjÃ?Â¶rn. He lives in a house in Stockholm with his wife Sanna and has a job at a commercial bureau in town. Sanna is on a long-term sick leave because she is stressed out. At least that is what she says.. Henrik, BjÃ?Â¶rns brother, is a frequent guest at their house. He visits every time he has a problem at home with his wife or children and that happens a lot.
