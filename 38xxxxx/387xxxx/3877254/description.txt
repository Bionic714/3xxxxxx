Susumu Yokota - Love Or Die (LCD66)
320 kbps

Susumu Yokota is one of the very few consistently engag-
ing electronic artists to emerge in the last 10 years. Always
restless, always changing and yet always himself.
Love Or Die sees him return to a more distinctly ?ambient?
sound as found on his classic albums like ? Sakura? and
?Grinning Cat? and yet as ever there are new variations
and surprising juxtapositions, such as the drum and bass
meets Windham Hill textures of ? The Scream of a Sage...?
or the Joe Meek breakbeat of ?The Loneliness of Anarchic
Beauty...?.
