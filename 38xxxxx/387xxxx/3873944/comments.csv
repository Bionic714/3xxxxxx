,Apple_freak,2007-11-05T20:14Z,"Again: Doesn't work with Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator or Adobe Indesign.

""You can't apply patch on this file""

To bad 'the solution' hasn't been found yet. I'm still stuck with Tiger."
,Wabb,2007-11-05T21:10Z,"It sounds like you're using this with older builds. This is for the latest builds only.

I'm downloading PS to check now.

If you are using older builds, give me your build numbers and I'll try and make a custom patcher for you."

But how can I find out which build I'm using/I've got??

Thx in advance.
"
,Wabb,2007-11-05T21:45Z,"Confirmed working with Photoshop Build (20070321) on Leopard

Punks_4_Live:

Navigate to your applications folder

Open the folder for the app e.g. Adobe Photoshop CS3

Right click on the app itself and choose Get Info

Next to Version should be the version followed by build, on Photoshop it looks a bit like this: 10.0 (10.0x20070321). Where the build is 20070321. 

For Dreamweaver it looks like this: 9.0.0.3481"
,dimaiovu,2007-11-05T21:58Z,"Guys, there are a lot of cracks, all of them are working (you only need to find the right DMG install file) but WHAT DO WE DO WITH INDESIGN?

Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

How can I get an updated version?"

,TomKnock,2007-11-06T15:44Z,"I'm sorry to be a bit dense, but you write ""You need to download the latest build from Adobe and then use this patch.""

Does that mean that one can just grab a 30-day demo from Adobe and apply these patches, or does it mean one should install from a disk-image of the full versions, then update using Adobe Updater"" and then apply these patches?

Again, sorry if this is a stupid question :)

Thanks for posting! :-)"
,Wabb,2007-11-06T16:35Z,"Yep you can just download the trials from adobe and crack them with this patch

I'm not sure about updating, but it may work if you were able to update to the latest version/build and then apply this patch

If you can, the easiest thing is to download the trials from adobe, then patch :)

It has been reported working successfully with InDesign CS3, by me and others.

I'm sorry, for some reason it doesn't work for you.

Check to make sure you're not running it using rosetta. 

Try running InDesign installer, then choose to uninstall all components, then re-install and try again.

Hope this helps :D

,Enzo-rus,2007-11-08T09:34Z,"The problem with this crack is version numbers of programs in CS3. If you apply crack before update you will not be able to install updates, if after update=>crack will not work.

The way out is:
1. Download this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3844874/All_Adobe_Keygens

2. Use serials:
1326-0110-5569-6121-4741-2255
1326-0651-7402-0424-4066-8309

3. Unrar Adobe Keygens in windows, find the folder naimed AGAiN and DesignPremiumCS3KYGEN+ACTIVATION.EXE and run it in windows

4. Run Illustrator, insert s/n listed in #2 and chose at activate options Activate by telephone.

5. Insert Activation number and serial to keygen in windows and generate Authorization code

6. Insert Authorization code to Illustrator window and press Activate

After all that things I've updated my Illustrator to 13.0.2 :)

Hope this will help to activate design premium

Sorry for terrible English"

The keygen for CS3DesignPremium will not let me enter the serial in his #2. I can only generate random ones.

I don't have a separate PC, I have to use Boot Camp to reboot into Windows.

Any of you heros have a fix or maybe I'm just missing something.

You can't put a serial no. in KeyGen, you leave that blank and put the activation code and the authorization code worked. I installed most components (I don't use flash) and updated everything perfectly. Shame to go to all this work, I'd buy this if it was priced 5x what it should be. Thanks everyone."

also, can you do updates if you install via the Enzo method? with the cracks, you can not apply updates, so I wanted to know if the Enzo method fixes that.

thanks!
"
,sten007,2007-12-01T19:29Z,"One more thing.

What I did
I updated localdb (sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb)
Then located everything that had ""Adobe"" and ""CS3"" in file name and I deleted every single bit of those.

And still there is one nasty secret place where it writes some kind of information about registration, activation etc.

Does anyone know, where this bloody secret place is so I could delete everything that is related to CS3, incl. every detail of registration, activation etc?"
,Enzo-rus,2007-12-01T19:37Z,"turk.o there is no need to find newer bilds because all updates you can dowload and install easily via adobe updater. I mean that no problems with further updates with my method. I've tested several times.
More: if you download trials from Adobe, you wil not have newer builds this way. At least I dod not.
Everything is checked and 100% fine ONLY WITH RETAIL VERSION OF DESIGN PREMIUM.

sten2007 activation information could be stored in some file, which name consist no adobe or CS3. In your case suggested to call to Adobe support for further instructions on deactivation (manual for CS3 cleaner script)."
,walkindanger,2007-12-01T22:05Z,"enzo you're a fuck head, i have 10.0.02 for photoshop. not your version. the fucking updater was turned on smartass, that's WHY i needed a crack/serial for it. how thick are you? i think it's kinda obvious and self explanatory that the previous version works fine BUT i'm asking for a crack/serial for the newer version. go fuck yourself enzo and learn some good english.
""don't tell bullshit""
damn right.
so let's just wait till some smartass comes out with a way around this.
PS: once again, you're using the design suite version of photoshop, wake the fuck up and read what i said, ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS3 EXTENDED :) good day."
,walkindanger,2007-12-01T22:06Z,"sten,
you might wanna use the application ""AppZapper"".
it basically erases every single trace of an application installed on your mac including preferance panes, registration info, update info, useless system files related to that applicaton etc etc.
it's simple to use, see if you can find a torrent for it. hope that helped, cheers."

well, I see that you are stupid enough to write such things...
You are looking the way how to crack another program and complain about this crack don`t work for you. Why not to try crack MS Office with this Design Suite Premium CS3 [k] Crack?

So, go fuck yourself please, nobody will help you if you do not want to download normal RETAIL version of product. Many people did what I say and they happy now, BUT NOT THE LOOSER WALKINDANGER:))))

Try to understand this: nobody promised to you that my way will work for your loosers kit - PS Ext. If you still unable to understand that, so...

Then Enzo told him about that this serials are only for Design Premium Suite. Response from walkindanger was ""fucking help"". What surprise!
Then walkindanger said that 1326-xxx-xxx do not work in MAC (not only in PS3 extended). But hi didnt read all thanks from many peoples who already activated their software by the method with serials. Then he realized that hi was wrong in general and started to write crazy things.

I agree with Mark that walkindanger needs to be viewed by doctor as soon as possible.

To tell about english and language in general - is not the thing serious people would do.

Enzo-rus point to a specific torrent for creative suite premium on page two.  Is this still the preferred version?  

Ringdlng gives steps to install the suite without needing serial numbers (also on page two).  Is that still the best way to go?  

I have old versions of Adobe software on my computer (Photoshop CS inDesignCS and Illustrator 10)  do I need to remove them before installing the new ones?

,jtgtorralba,2008-07-07T19:35Z,"Hi, don't waste your time waiting for seeds. Go to adobe site and download the trial version. this works for all the CS3 Design Premium Apps. But install all them before run the crack.

Install it as usual, during the installation its possible that the app show you an error message, easy, cancel it and go to apple site and check updates for your MAC OS X, install it and tray again.Once you finish the installation process it's not necessary to start PS CS3 to enter any serial, just follow the steps on No. 88 comment starting on step 3.

Enjoy your CS3 DPS!!!"
,elixir101,2008-07-16T20:38Z,"I downloaded the 30 day trials of most of the CS3 design premium files from adobe the other day. 

I used the Adobe Updater to update the programs 

Though this crack worked on most of the programs  I recieved a 'crack will not work on this application message' for photoshop, illustrator and indesign.

I found this link http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4030159/

Managed to get photoshop and illustrator to work perfectly. No luck with indesign but you cant have it all can you?
Can you?  "
