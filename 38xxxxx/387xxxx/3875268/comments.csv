Works fine to download"
,arkhanien,2007-11-20T20:03Z,does anyone know if any if the subs currently out (e.g. subscene) for season 4 is in sync with this release? 
,kikyerhedin,2007-11-21T01:07Z,"I am not getting any sound via quicktime, the video looks excellent though. Any help?"
,doesthissmellright,2007-12-02T23:50Z,Hello kikyerhedin. Try downloading VLC media player. It's played all my shit perfectly so far.
,Troutking,2007-12-05T20:49Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3922399 In sync, I belive."
,Troutking,2007-12-06T22:40Z,"Sry. The above link is wrong. This one is correct; http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3924168 Episodes 2 and 4 missing. The rest are in sync, also the long epsode 13."
,Leif1965,2008-01-07T17:49Z,thanks for all sesons off The Wire
,trueevil,2008-02-11T19:05Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS! Only ep 1 is good quality, the rest are not. Surprisingly, the sample .jpg is taken from ep 1...

Rest of the episodes have no contrast and a lot of artifacts. Way to f*** up your rip, a**hole."
,Jonesing,2008-02-22T00:40Z,"DO DOWNLOAD THIS! Ep 1 is great quality and the rest are absolutely fine (350MB for an hour's television), they're as good as all the other season torrents on TPB at the moment. If trueevil's quality was as bad as he said it was he probably needs to get a new media player and some codecs."
,itoccurs2me,2008-05-10T16:15Z,"Check out the writer, director, actor, audio commentaries from seasons 1-4 DVDs @ http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4165385  Nice."
,Granchy,2008-05-23T17:24Z,"In both WMP and VLC the audio gets slightly out of synch through major chunks of the later episodes.  This is the same with the other Season 4 file that's up on this site.  

It's a shame, but at least it's watchable.  Not the best quality around though, that's for sure.  "
