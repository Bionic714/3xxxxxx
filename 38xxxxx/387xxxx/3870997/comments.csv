,Noob-Saibot,2008-07-20T06:02Z,Mission to Mars is a solid movie. Even if the rating on imdb is just 5/10. I would give this Movie 7/10. This movie is good for people who liked movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Dune or the game mass effect ;D

,DarkAnark,2011-03-31T08:23Z,"Morley man...i would have to agree. this movie is alittle gay at the end..kinda like a wizzard of oz ending...GAY===>
but the concept of another entity like the face, you have to admit it strikes some interests.
And freakybaby and spotwood.  red planet is one of my favorite sci fi"
