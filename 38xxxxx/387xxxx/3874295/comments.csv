,Majty,2007-11-11T18:36Z,"Looks like a uncut version. The longest version available though was only released in New Zealand and it was 1h44min. 1h40min is considered the Uncut version and this is most likely that one even if it says 99min. They could have rounded 99min 37sec to 100min or something similar. One of my favorite movies, I have seen it 11 or 12 times."
