Review From AMG:
Guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel's Deep Song is an intimately atmospheric album that finds the ever-reaching jazz musician in the company of a stellar ensemble. Rosenwinkel has always displayed the strong influences of such expansive players as Pat Metheny, John Scofield, and Pat Martino, and tracks such as the continually overlapping "The Cloister" do nothing if not reinforce such high comparative praise. In fact, Rosenwinkel's moody take on "If I Should Lose You" brings to mind such cerebrally mellow Martino classics as We'll Be Together Again and Cream. Joining him here are the deep-color talents of saxophonist Joshua Redman, pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Larry Grenadier, and drummers Jeff Ballard and Ali Jackson.


Enjoy!
