[T],passionettez,2007-11-12T20:59Z,"Well, to be honest, I prefer a Mac, I had it at my old job and it was awesome..unfortunately we have 2 laptops one with XP and the other has Vista, and 3 pcs with XP on it."

,Tonkmor,2008-05-11T22:27Z,"To be truely honest.......,I got two laptops.One is A fujitsu,Vista was allowing viruses to come through like it was collecting them,5 times I had to get it sorted.It still aint right.I went and got the Sony Vaio for the business.The sony is shit hot for ÂŁ650.But vista gives it problems.My knowledge is less than good with pc's laptop's,But I do know Vista is ONE BIG rip off.Iam debating wiping my laptops and installing Xp.I cant operate a business with Vista,I lose money,But Microsoft keep GAINING profits from Shitsta.If I could get my hands on the guys who did Vista I surely would bang him out un consiece and Tattoo Fuckin Cock Sucking Cunt on his Rah Cloth head"
,Lonepup,2009-03-29T20:07Z,"Nice torrent, thanks. I went with VISTA because it has a 64-bit version, and it makes sense to have a 64-bit OS to run with my processor. XP is rock solid however for 32 bit OS & apps. VISTA was a shock to use for the first time... the security was overkill. But I got used to that & the Ultimate version is very nice. There are many things (sys admin level) functions that I perfer to do in VISTA than XP. Also the graphics GUI is awesome in VISTA ultimate & this OS has built in picture viewers & DVD creation which is intuitive to use (unlike NERO)."
