Nederlandsche neofolk. (Dutch)

From Last.fm:

Dutch martial Neo-folk. Strong associations with the fifties. Although often associated with fascism and even the nazis, there is nothing racist about their music. It has more to do with moral values in general. Musically, they are actually quite experimental. Suprising rhythms and tempo changes, very correct diction for the spoken texts and harsh and exciting drums.


This is their first release, from 2002. Remember, if you like this, buy Vinyl or t-shirts at http://www.volksweerbaarheid.nl
