,Roblee,2008-08-24T17:37Z,alright fellas! just burn it out on cd's no prob.. 
,Chance Sundance,2008-09-01T16:39Z,"Nah , don""T burn the game to cd""s ...

Just do like i did....

Do a full-install (mount with Alcohol) and when you get a message ""not enough disc-space"" just ignore it ...IF YOU""RE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH FREE-SPACE ....

Okay , next ......when asked for the second disc , just press ctrl-alt-delete , unmount disc 1 , and mount disc 2 ....

the same for all the 7 discs....

when everything is completed.

Go to start-programms and make a quickstart-icon on your desktop.

Oh yeah , don""t forget to unmount all the 7 cd""S ...

you don""t need it anymore, cuz you just did a full-install and the game doesn""t require a no-cd patch.....

damn , i forgot another imporatnt thing ...

if you play the game and get prompted that you need quick-time 3 ...just look and install it from disc 1 (again ...i did all this with Alcohol 120% ).


only problem i have is that the audio is not very nice ...sssso if anyone can help me out here i appreciate it....

btw. i installed this game on my xp-desktop , next....

i""ll try it to install it on my vista-premium laptop....
"
,Chance Sundance,2008-09-01T17:00Z,"I solved the audio-problem allready ...

just install quicktime 7 AFTER you""ve installed Qt 3...

Works perfect now :)"
