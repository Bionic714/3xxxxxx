Synopsis

Domestic bliss was never like this! Get ready for those outrageous Bundys in MARRIEDâ?¦WITH CHILDREN: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, featuring all 13 hilarious episodes from the showâ??s groundbreaking debut season, introducing everybodyâ??s favorite dysfunctional household. This taboo-shattering hit series was often deemed too hot for TV, bringing a blue-collar brand of raunchy humor to Americaâ??s idyllic â??80s TV family, where father definitely doesnâ??t know best! Remastered and available on DVD for the first time ever, this collectorâ??s favorite lets you get reacquainted with this middle-class clan of lovable losers â?? hard-working lug Al (Ed Oâ??Neill), his couch-potato wife Peg (Katey Sagal), sexy teen daughter Kelly (Christina Applegate), hopelessly horny son Bud (David Faustino), and prudish neighbors Marcy and Steve (Amanda Bearse, David Garrison) â?? as they try to get along without getting on each otherâ??s nerves! For better or worse, the Bundys may be broke, but this is one family thatâ??s rich in delightfully demented attitude, wild characters, and racy humor!..
