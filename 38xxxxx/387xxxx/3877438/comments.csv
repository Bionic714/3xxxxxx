ME ME ME please"
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-08T04:11Z,"Well if someone wants it; then here it is for them.

For as long as Ive been using it on some of my older machines it runs nice and smooth."
,LadyAbagail,2007-11-24T03:15Z,"Sometimes people would like to get unauthorized verbatim reproductions of bad software for debugging, testing, and other forms of research.  Not everyone wants the same things for the same reasons.  Besides which, ANY Microsoft software is in its best form nothing more then a chocolate covered turd, so criticizing the quality of the chocolate in the coating while ignoring the turd in the center is sheer stupidity.  Cheers!"
,mugwump770,2007-12-07T02:13Z,"Actually,  Windows ME runs rings around XP.  I've tried,  in the 18 months since I switched to XP,  to rationalize the change.  There is no real reason.  Except,  of course,  that Microsoft and the software people need more money.  

ME got a bad rap because it was released as a stopgap until XP was made workable enough to begin selling.   I used it for six years.  I had 1/10th the problems with it as XP,  and 1/50th the updates.  

With every generation of this crap,  Microsoft reduces machine efficiency by a factor of five or more.  And what are we REALLY gaining out of all that?   Oh.  Yeah.  The gameboys can zap things faster because they don't have a life outside their bedrooms.  And the Home Theaterists can tie up a $2000 machine to do what a $129 DVD burner or DVR does much more effectively.  And Sportsists can watch fantasy WWE with figures that rival Pixar for reality.  Whoopee.

Now,  any given PC or laptop has more storage and memory space and computing power than existed on this planet the day we landed on the Moon.   And all of it grinds almost to a halt when it passes through Windows.  And Intel builds them bigger and faster,  and the cycle repeats.

Want to try something interesting?  I didn't think so... but if anyone does,  download and install this on an old,  small HD.  Put it in a machine,  alone.  With 64 meg of memory.  No RAID,  no nothing.  Boot it up.  Update it to IE 6.   Use it awhile and then re-boot into XP.   The speed difference,  and the HORRIBLE action of the XP cursor focus (once one is used to ME) will depress you for a long,  long time.

Wonder how much worse it can get?  Fortunately,  none of my dozen or so machines will boot Vista.  So,  by the time I inherit one that will,  Vista for iPhone should be the OS of choice.  

Comparing Windows to a chocolate-covered turd is being very unkind to the turd.  At least shit and chocolate serve real-world purposes.  To paraphrase Churchill concerning Microsoft,  Intel and the software people...  Never in Human History have so many spent so much on so little."

,HelloKiddy,2008-08-08T23:20Z,"Could someone please tell me how to burn this ISO? I've burnt it several times with PowerISO, and it says please reinsert disk every time! It does the same thing in Virtual drive also. Thanks for any help!"

,zvargast,2008-12-02T18:22Z,"Since ME is out of date;I can go back to legality,I'm tired of XP, runs worse on my pentium VI than did ME on my Pentium III.
I tried UBUNTU as well to see how buggy is it too.
Besides,I like ME;I would buy it."

,cybrmutt,2009-07-03T03:59Z,"i've inherited some old desktops without an OS.  I have installd ME and given them to un-employed friends who are going back to school; who can't afford a computer of any kind, and family responsibilities prevent them from using the computer lab or library computers.

THANKS FOR UPPING THIS... it has made a *real* difference in the lives of people you will never know..

peace...

,HJH10,2011-08-23T19:34Z,Have to agree with da HELLRAISER.  There is folks out there that love to live with what their comfortable with.  I'm glad that we can still remember the old school.
,Saki33,2011-12-14T00:00Z,"I just wiped an old hard drive and then couldn't find my installation CD to put it back on. I agree with the commenters. I had fewer problems with Me than I did with XP.

Thanks very much for providing this for those who want it. For someone to come in here and comment that it's stupid to upload is even more stupid. If it's not what you want why even open the page? Stay away and keep your comments to yourself and don't knock people who share."
,zubran,2012-04-06T14:57Z,"awesome! I need this to make sure a program I am developing works everywhere, and maybe regain some memories."
,AfritxAlchemy,2012-04-14T08:24Z,"I really wish people would stop insulting this wonderful little OS. Maybe it's the sentiment talking and the first OS I ever owned (not used, the first would be Win '95)... maybe it's the fact that after almost 10+ years I was finally able to play DOOM again... or maybe the fact that Me is what it is, is what makes me love it so. I don't know. But reading all the supportive comments outweighing the unsupportive will strengthen my resolve that Me is a great OS. Even with all her faults, she still wins in my book. ^.^"

,serdal22,2012-05-27T23:53Z,"I used to use ME years ago, and as many commenters said, it is a good solid version. 

Some of my important softwares do not run on NT based windows versions which are other than ME. So, I need this version a lot.

Thanks a lot uploader!"
,doubled-revolutions,2012-07-09T15:56Z,"Windows ME stands for Windows Millennium Edition.

It is the home counterpart to Windows 2000."
,doubled-revolutions,2012-07-09T16:03Z,Let the Windows nostalgia begin...
