,OwlPox,2010-04-28T13:04Z,"The properly encoded version of this can be found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5173949/Deep_Tissue_Massage_and_Myofascial_Release.AVI

The content is the same, but the older one had a improper aspect ratio, no joining of the video segments from the original DVD, etc.  I made both original torrents, and this one is a rip of the original before I knew what I was doing. 

Sorry so many people picked up on it."
