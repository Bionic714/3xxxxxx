,solidfan,2007-12-09T20:09Z,"how crappy to see all the sponsored links... Florida Vacation Homes my a**... But with that said, better have the best free css templates in the world with a few stupid sponsored links, than having completely hopeless templates like those template monster thingys... go remove the sponsored link, that's me advice to ya'll!! btw, there are newer versions of the andreas-templates on http://andreasviklund.com/templates/ for those who wants newer stuff. They are still free. And there is opendesigns.org and oswd.org for ppl who want more free css templates."

,chuyskywalker,2007-12-23T11:46Z,"There are, maybe, 3 good templates in this download. The rest are pretty aweful."

,Ipshwitz,2010-01-02T04:23Z,"As a designer for many years, I though this would be a great start for some friends who are just getting into using CSS - However, after I actually looked at them, not only do the promote shitty CSS naming conventions (and all around usage), they layouts are horrible and the color schemes are well below par.  If these truly are the top 100 CSS websites then the designing world is in serious trouble...

My recommendation:  Forget this, don't seed it, don't download it.  "
,Ipshwitz,2010-01-02T04:31Z,"@solidfan

- Seriously?  I mean really... these are templates, if you use these as live sites as they are, you deserve to have the shitty sponsored links at the bottom.  After all, who would ever think that when they are editing the content, to actually remove the footer information and replace it with their own."
,kneblock,2010-09-14T23:59Z,"The templates that solidfan refers to can be downloaded directly here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5830986/

All css templates and add-ons from http://andreasviklund.com/templates/ in one package. Also a legal torrent since the material is free and available from the designers' website, but with the convenience of a quick torrent download. (:"
