Jenna was born and raised in Las Vegas by her father, and by the time she was 18, the bright lights were already drawing her in. She studied ballet as a student, but it was stripping that started Jenna on her road to superstardom. Dancing led to nude modeling, and by her 20th birthday Jenna had appeared in dozens of top men's mags, including Penthouse, Hustler, High Society and Cheri. A visit to a porn set piqued Jenna's interest in a hardcore career, and Wicked Pictures signed her to an exclusive contract after a bidding war. It took only a few releases for Jenna to become the most popular young starlet around. She catapulted to the top of the porn heap, and in 1996 she scored an unprecedented triple crown by taking home the XRCO Best New Starlet, the F.O.X.E. Video Vixen and the AVN Best New Starlet awards. Jenna has been branching out into more mainstream projects lately, including a featured role in Howard Stern's Private Parts (1997) film. She remains one of the most popular pornstresses in the industry today.
