,lwaa,2007-12-18T19:46Z,"great, but need it in English not bloody french - "

You know the way sooo many anglophones cry about ""languages other than english.""  I'm convinced that culturally you're a buch of mentally handicapped morons.  
It's a good film.  Either suffer through the french parts quietly or don't download it.  Regardless, shut up ! Because no one needs to read your bullshit.

Merci beaucoup pour ce film.  C'était très gentil !"

That said, it never ceases to puzzle me why most commenters choose to use this space as a blog to expose their ignorance and lack of social grace. I don't know, I guess that's what it's coming to these days.

Anyway, thanks again for the rip.  I haven't watched it yet so I can't comment on the quality.  However, I expect it to be good and will jump back on to let you know if it isn't.

Happy pirating all."
