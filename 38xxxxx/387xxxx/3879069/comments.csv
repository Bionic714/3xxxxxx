,MagneticNorth,2008-08-04T06:10Z,"Jesus, you'd think that someone uploading a game would have more common sense. This is absolute garbage, it's in Spanish, and doesn't install once you start it up.

Thanks for shit, you idiot.

I recommend anyone looking to download this to stop here, this torrent fails. -_-'"
,Nahirab,2008-12-09T22:13Z,"I got it to work... on my 12years old com  ^^
It was a shitful of work and yes i can confirm it is in spanish. Not only the installing menu but also the game menu :(


This is how i installed it:
1.I downloaded the oldest Daemon tools and instaled on the computer.

2.I mounted Corsairs upp with daemon tools and installed.

3.Everything went flawlessly (exept from being inn spanish)


Any1 so knows where there are an ENGLISH version?

,Nahirab,2008-12-09T22:16Z,"BTW; I had to burn the shit on CD's to 'transfer' the info from the new computer to the old one.

It requires Windows 98 to get installed. Newer won't work. Dunno why."
,Nahirab,2008-12-12T15:24Z,"It's not Spanish it's Italian.

Use the Google translator: http://translate.google.com/


Try to first get a demo. Install that and if that should work use install the game at the same way."
,scooter111,2009-08-05T23:39Z,q-77 - I did that.Start the game ang go to the main menu.I choose adventure mode/missions and then give error of something in folder missions ... Concluding: no shit.The game is not playable.
,scooter111,2009-08-05T23:41Z,"When it starts loading (after go out of menus) it give that error in folder ""mis"" something."
,scooter111,2009-08-05T23:56Z,"Appear this whan is loading the game:

,killerbob869,2010-06-12T14:29Z,"!!INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING THIS GAME ENGLISH/FRENCH/SPANISH/PORTUGESE/GERMAN!!

All text in the game files is available in these languages, but the game has to be set to use it.
With some help of the English demo version (see link further down - still works now - june 2010), it's possible to make the entire game English.
For other languages, some elements will remain Italian if there's no demo version in these languages.

For English:

Step 1: change text ""LANGUAGE=ITALIAN"" into ""LANGUAGE=ENGLISH"" in the file ""Corsairs.ini"";

Step 2: the four folders ""Sound"", ""Data\Board"", ""Data\Ecrans"", and ""Data\Menu0"" all need an ""Eng"" called subfolder.

Now, there are two ways of getting this done, the easy or the hard way:)))

1 - EASY WAY - just rename the ""Ita"" folders in these locations into ""Eng"". In this case, the first menu in the game will
remain Italian, as will the ingame speech and some pictures of onboard items, like sugar, coffee, etc. The rest of the game
will be completely in English.

2 - HARD WAY - download the English demo version at
http://downloads.ugo.com/downloads/game_demos/strategy/Corsairs_delivery.shtml
then copy ""Eng"" in the mentioned folders from the demo to the original game. !!ATTENTION: after this, copy ""start.tga"" from ""Data\Ecrans\Ita"" into ""Data\Ecrans\Eng"" or the game won't work!!
This is a start screen that says Corsairs Gold. By the way all .TGA files are images that you can open for instance with open-source program Gimp.

In case you do it this way, the whole game will be in English, but it doesn't say ""Corsairs Gold"" in the background
of the first menu, just ""Corsairs"", because the English background was taken from the demo version, which isn't the Gold edition.

For the other languages:

Step 1 is the same, just change the text into your language.

I don't know what the subfolders of step 2 should be named into, I assume
""Fre"" for French, ""Spa"" for Spanish, ""Ger"" for German, and ""Por"" for Potuguese, but I haven't tested this,
and I don't know whether there are any demo versions for these languages, so if not you have to stick to the mentioned EASY way.

In the ""Missions"" folder, there are .DUT and .POL files in some locations for Dutch or Polish, but not everywhere. I assume they've
decided not to release the game in these languages after all. Some .DUT files don't contain Dutch text, but English.

I play games like this in Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, in which I installed a Windows 98SE copy. No compatibility problems this way at all.
Make sure you give enough memory to the Vitual PC environment though."
,dimit11,2011-12-25T12:33Z,so i have an english version of this. It's work on Windows 7 and XP. Does anyone need it?
,koshdim,2012-01-09T21:06Z,"dimit11, can you share link for installation that works under XP and 7?"
