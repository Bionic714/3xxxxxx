,xXsplinterheadXx,2008-03-28T04:24Z,"is the song mean mr mustard the full song, or just the shitty cut in half 1:06 version"
,cricketbones,2008-06-23T13:36Z,"mr mustard is part of a 16 minute medley, numbnuts.

try using google or wikipedia.  i will never understand people like you asking questions like that in the comments section of a torrent site when the WHOLE FUCKING INTERNET is at your disposal.

of course, i may as well be screaming this into a rip in space and time for all the good it will do."
