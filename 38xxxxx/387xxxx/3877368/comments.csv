,d.alexandr,2008-03-15T22:30Z,totalne functionless. without cd kei.
,d.alexandr,2008-03-21T00:43Z,would be original cd key.
,-olanorman-,2008-03-24T11:50Z,"You can do it like this, if you don`t have serial.
Go into the I386 directory and open the file: setupp.ini
It looks like this:

[Pid]
ExtraData=6166656C736263737373B2574A0581
Pid=51873XXX

Replace the 3 X`s with 270.
That?s it! You can now install Windows 2000 without a serial number! "

,Triadbeast,2009-03-11T06:26Z,"@olanorman:

I tried that hack already, but when it installs, and goes to setup, on the computer, it puts up and error saying that the CD key is wrong.

On another note, where would one find the file on the ISO that contains the cd key?"
,Triadbeast,2009-03-12T05:37Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4765083
Has this ISO recompiled with SP4 and CD keys, also Daemon Tools."
