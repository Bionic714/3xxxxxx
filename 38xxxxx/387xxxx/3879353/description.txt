DR. GENE SCOTT'S LECTURES

     -Demonology


This torrent is a CD RIP of a Dr. Gene Scott's lectures on Demonology.  But if you like his stuff, his case study on the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is one that all should hear. Enjoy!


Some History:

In 1975, Scott began a series of broadcasts, which resulted in the creation of the University Network. By 1983, the University Network was broadcasting his sermons twenty-four hours a day via satellite to the United States and Canada, as well as to much of Mexico and the Caribbean.

By 1990, his network was available to 180 countries, and by 1992 his sermons were being broadcast in several languages on AM, FM, and short-wave radio. His programming consisted of his trademark informal style of Bible teaching mixed with provocative commentary, music, and personal interests in such diverse subjects as his paintings, scientific interpretations of the great wonders of the world, and his American saddle-bred horses.

Before Gene Scott died, many of his lectures were freely available at his website DrGeneScott.com. Immediately after his death, his wife Melissa took over all the operations of the church and removed all recordings of Gene Scott's lectures from public availability. Not only were the free online lectures were removed, but Melissa also ordered thousands of cassette tape recordings of Dr. Scott's teachings to be permanently removed from circulation so that no one would ever hear them again (written by another seeder).

Gene Scott himself warned that once he died, those who took over the church would destroy his entire life work. This was because his teachings frequently went into territory far beyond what one would normally expect from an ostensibly "Christian" preacher. Indeed, he spent much time educating his listeners on subjects which were highly politically sensitive even to this day, and he knew that only he himself could guarantee the continued availability of his teachings (written by another seeder).
