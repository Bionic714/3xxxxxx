,diddyman4real,2009-02-02T07:46Z,"thank you dude, i'll help them out cuz these dudes seem lost. lol

1) Un-rar everything to a folder

2) un-rar the second folder with pass godloveu

3) Use The SETUP exe to install the original version of the program.

4) Use The Tube-Setup to crack it. Right Click on it, Click-on install. let it run. Hit finish when it says install complete. 

I can't believe nobody figured that out! It doesn't take a read me file to figure that out! lol"
,jehurey,2009-02-07T03:29Z,it's still asking me to register.. grrr... help again!
,TreeHacker,2009-03-02T05:21Z,WTF ok first off the website that you gave in the READ ME first is now invalid so I tried to follow diddymans4real's instructions but idk what he is talking about i can get up to the part where he says click install... please help me out WTF is the paypal email!!!  email me if you can help austinzeller@rocketmail.com
,diddyman4real,2009-03-07T07:18Z,"here is way number 2! This is the hard and most likely, scam way to get it. This are the directions off the site his readme links to: 

1. Click on a survey link.

2. Fill out the whole survey using real information.

3. Check to see if the page is unlocked.

4. If page is not unlocked, please complete a different survey.

5. If you still have not been able to unlock the page, clear your cookies and try again

I'm sure that this is a good way to lose your identity. but hey, if you want it that badly, go for it! lol"
,roxs_download,2009-03-09T15:14Z,Yeah Whats the EMAIL. If no one has the email this torrent is WORTHLESS!!!
