A year or more back some Rense files were being seeded via another tracker and Jeff R's webmaster came onto the forum of that tracker and asked we stop. I posted some comments and emailed JR saying that if anything it would help get more people subscribing in the long term... it did me for a year!

Anyway - Jeff addressed it in a show and basically said it was OK to share them. After all:

 1. you could get it off radio 
2. Subscribing is easier and you get the archives

..so I don't think there is a problem sharing these shows. Rense has a lot of subscribers.

Please seed at least the same when your torrent is complete... grabbing and running earns you nothing but bad digi-karma.
