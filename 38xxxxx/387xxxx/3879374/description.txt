About
pfSense is a open source standalone firewall derived from the m0n0wall operating system platform with radically different goals such as using OpenBSD\\\'s ported Packet Filter, FreeBSD 6.1 ALTQ (HFSC) for excellent packet queueing and finally an integrated package management system for extending the environment with new features.

This is the LiveCD version, but also functions as install cd.
