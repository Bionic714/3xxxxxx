,zazafromjohor,2007-11-09T14:06Z,is the key working??? I have tried unsucccessfully...
,{TheMax},2007-11-09T14:53Z,"OK i'm a noob!
what i said was wrong! This is what the Key - Read Me!!!! says

Burn The ISO Directly or it will not be bootable.

Key: FCKGW-RHQQ2-YXRKT-8TG6W-2B7Q8. Copy this key down on paper youll need it.

This is the famous Windows XP Professional that does not require activation. 
I have streamlined service pack 2 witch makes for a fresh clean and smooth install. 
Never again will you have to install windows XP and then have to download sp2. After 
you install this windows on your computer, You can make this copy 100% legit by 
following the instructions in the ""Windows WGA Patcher Permanent Kit"" folder.

REMEBER IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD FUTURE WINDOWS UPDATES AND SOFTWARE LIKE DIRECT X, YOU WILL NEED TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ""Windows WGA Patcher Permanent Kit"" Folder.

IF THE key doesn't work go to this site: www.keygen.ws then look for Windows XP Pro SP2 !!"

Works Great!"
