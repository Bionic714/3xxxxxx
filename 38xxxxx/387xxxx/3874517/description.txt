THE HOCKEY SONG--------

This song is played at Hockey games 
all over Canada and the U.S.A-

Big Joe Mufferaw is a Canadian version of Paul Bunyan.


HOW THE MOUNTAIN CAME DOWN---------

This is a true story.


SUDBURY SATURDAY NIGHT----------

Stompin' Tom wrote this song about 
the city of Sudbury, Ontario
where every Saturday night- 
all the miners would get together in the pub
and drink themselves silly.

- The line-  "We think no more of Inco 
on a Sudbury Saturday Night"

refers to the big Inco Mine in Sudbury,  
where all the miners worked.

 
MARGO'S CARGO-----------

This song was written about a man and woman 
from Newfoundland, Canada- 
where boys and girls commonly 
call each other "BIE & GAL"

which is why the lyrics to this song go- 

"Margo's got the cargo, BIE- and Reggie's got the rig."
