,breaper,2008-04-23T21:05Z,"If this is what I hope it is, Ill keep this torrent running for a while with a outsourced torrent provider. Although with it being so big I might have to cut it down into smaller pieces later, if thats alright with the uploader.

Otherwise a brilliant collection of movies, definatly ones that veryone should see whether they are anime fans or not."
,Zipang,2008-07-16T16:15Z,great up! so what happened to breaking this torrent into smaller pieces? would be useful and easier to keep alive.....
,acertainfogz,2008-07-20T16:11Z,"Can we get a couple more seeders for this? I'm only missing a few pieces. Don't make me cry, eh?"
,livdragoon,2008-07-21T08:52Z,"Good torrent, gooing to seed this for awhile. Only at 59 % atm, but it will get there :)"
,Gmanji,2008-08-17T19:09Z,"I will seed this forever. I don't care how my other downloads go, people /need/ these anime."
,ariwen,2008-09-02T23:44Z,"Nice films but sometimes hard to read the subs since the text blend into the background. Also I've noticed that the text is out of sync on cd2 of Omohide Poro Poro. Otherwise nice work, thanks."
,LuciF0rm,2008-09-21T22:51Z,"Great collection, i'm going to download this and remain seeding ASAP."
,Nairb2,2008-10-11T07:33Z,"The sound did not work in Media Player Classic, but it did in other programs.  "
,LezDawson,2008-11-15T12:02Z,"Wow, you people have more faith than me.  Downloading this big collection without knowing the format, the audio bitrate, the audio format, the resolution...
I guess to tell us these details would just be too much trouble."
,LuciF0rm,2008-12-01T14:30Z,"Well, I've completely downloaded only ""Memories of Teardrops"" so far, but if this will come useful:
VIDEO: 640x352  23.976 fps  1123.5 kbps DivX ;-)
AUDIO: 48000 Hz, 2 ch, 448.0 kbit, AC3"
