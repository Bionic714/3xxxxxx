Great job, keep them coming and keep your ship afloat :)
Jingles in J don't match with your list in the post, seems like the rar has quite a few missing :(
Thanks anyway for all the work you put into this, much appreciated.

,fivalo,2009-02-04T23:56Z,"thanks, had some specific tracks I was looking for :) problem is via .rar can't pick out jsut the oens i want and have to downlaod the full 3.6gb instead of 100mb that I want... will seed for a day or two but then gotta rid up space of the stuff I don't need.

much thanks for the alphabet series for certain, 
if possible in the future please allow selection of tracks so as to not tie up so much space thx"
