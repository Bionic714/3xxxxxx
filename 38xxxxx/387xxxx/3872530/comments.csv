,azper,2012-02-08T22:10Z,"Get with the HDtimes. People want FlACs or 320s
If you can't get that, I assume you're just reposting the same lowbitcraprips everyone else does.

THIS DOES NOT BANG. no OMMMFH in the music, no dynamics. ITS FLAT! 

If you have a stereo that isn't a boombox and you don't use shitty mp3players with shitty earplugs;
This is gonna be a major letdown.

Just saying this torrent is quantity over quality in extremo. For the hifi heads who also like to download this sort of music music."
