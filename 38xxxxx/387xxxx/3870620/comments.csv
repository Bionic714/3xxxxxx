,tempflux,2007-11-03T04:13Z,These are not the same song titles as on iTunes. It's fake u dumbasses.
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-11-03T06:32Z,iTunes? Your an idiot! This is the CD. 
,chapt_90,2007-11-03T11:54Z,Just check with wikipedia...U'll see these r the real songs coming out on the 6th
,ChuckmasterFlex,2007-11-04T05:55Z,"I picked up a promotional ad for the album today in DC, I'm literally looking at it right now, the tracks are all correct.  Get your facts straight before you run your fuckin mouths people."
,HOODLUMpirate,2007-11-04T08:08Z,So is this real or what? A simple yes or no will do. There is no need for you guys to come on here and let out your anger.
,La tierra de los Muertos,2007-11-04T10:49Z,Just get the music and shute the fuck up..
,Pheonixstyle,2007-11-05T04:14Z,perfect copy.  great album that i will buy regardless just to own the hard copy.
,blakp,2007-11-05T06:20Z,"don't say this very often but this is actually a really good album. i was a little (actually a lot) disappointed with jay's last album ""kingdom come."" this album is hot. and i'll be the first to admit that i don't buy too many cds but i might buy this one. jay's best product since the black album (which was cool). so download the fuck out of this album but you might want to go pick up a hard copy of this one. what's next jay?

p.s. i thought the nas verse on this album was eeenhhh. come back to us nas!"
,tempflux,2007-11-05T15:51Z,"Correct song list is: 

1.Amen		
2.Blue Magic	
3.Untitled			
4.Alright, Alright		
5.You Don't Know			
6.And The Winner Is		
7.American Gangster		
8.Welcome		
9.Ignorant Shit			
10.The Demise		
11.I Get Money (Remix)		

This = fake"

Now STFU you stupid uneducated f*ck and GTFO from the internet, you are hereby not liked by anyone you stupid f*ck. Go eat shit."
,Real_Stuff,2007-11-06T04:51Z,This torrent is real. I played all 15 songs from this download. no problem....
,doc_verde,2007-11-06T07:32Z,Official shit good looks on the cd.
,Gatbusta,2007-11-06T13:31Z,Nice share. I believe its legit. Yall other fuckups do some more research!
,shemesath,2007-11-06T23:19Z,"how ignorant do you have to be to think that 1.) there is a track called ""untitled"" on the official album and 2.) the ""i get money"" remix would be on this album.

if you truly have no idea what you are talking about when you post comments please DO NOT POST. this is the correct listing as you would find in ANY credible source."
,seriousluboy83,2007-11-06T23:34Z,how bout u just download tha shit if u want and if u dont fuck it ya know
,stanmimix,2007-11-07T01:12Z,"Ok, listen (or read)!! Jay-Z just pulled his songs from iTunes! He doesn't want them to be sold seperatly because; quote:""As movies are not sold scene by scene, this collection will not be sold as individual singles""! Since iTunes let users download individual songs, it might mean that the tracklist on iTunes isn't the official one! While the album is currently still listed on iTunes, customers will receive an error message if they attempt to purchase it. 
I hope that settles the tracklist dispute! Peace!!"
,sadox,2007-11-07T01:41Z,is this explicit version?
,CesareBorgia,2007-11-07T02:43Z,This is a transcode. Look at the spectrals. Fuck this and fuck FiNsTeRc.
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-11-07T04:39Z,"Of course there is transcoding. How do you think the music gets from the CDDA format on the CD to MP3. It's direct digital-to-digital conversion. CD music is stored @ 1411.2 kbps on the CD and is down sampled to 320kbps when ripped to MP3.
 By the way most people who are downloading this have no idea what transcode or spectrals mean. They just know it's a good quality rip."
,rippthejacker,2007-11-07T04:45Z,this is far from the [FullCD] you fail @ hip-hop.
,blakp,2007-11-07T05:15Z,to all concerned. and i'm seeding it for awhile. it's real. shit is banging in my ipod right now. no problems with this at all. 
,deus_vult,2007-11-07T13:05Z,thanks for the nerdy discussion btw :)
,T2G,2007-11-07T15:34Z,This is not a retail rip. Just to let the leechers know...
,CesareBorgia,2007-11-08T01:02Z,"A transcode goes the other way (from low quality to ""high quality""). It was probably 128 or 192 before, and it's ""320"" now."
,nasium,2007-11-08T01:59Z,"aXXo, BitTorrent's reigning king of DvDrips, has apparently decided to no longer upload content to The Pirate Bay."
,adonis1976,2007-11-08T13:32Z,tempflux you are an idiot !! THIS IS THE CD !!
,faelpsanfeel,2007-11-08T18:20Z,"If this really is a transcode, then please never upload anything ever again.

I'm glad I'm now downloading it; thanks for the warning.  Shit like this is why the peons of the internet will never understand why some of us are so sour over oink."
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-11-08T22:59Z,"OK lets engage in some more geeky tech talk to bore the people who simply want to download some good music. Again you are apparently a novice judging from your understanding of what transcode truly is.  As I mentioned before transcode is simply the process of converting one codec to another. By this definition ALL MP3 files from CD rips are transcode. The only time transcode would be used to describe merely converting bit rates is for video, not audio.  You can learn all about this stuff in college, really I did. What you are alluding to is upsampling. Of course this rip is not. Kind of pointless to rip a CD to a low bit rate then upsample to 320 kbps. Now if the spectral frequencies are confusing you, that would probably be because you are used to seeing MP3s ripped with WMP or some other lame PC software. My CD?s are ripped on a professional mixing system using WaveLab.  Now that you have been educated I?ll just second seriousluboy83?s comment above."
,faelpsanfeel,2007-11-08T23:26Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcode

Maybe you should go to college and learn about how words can have multiple definitions, stupidass."
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-11-09T03:53Z,"Wow! Wikipedia. Nice article, reinforced everything I have said.
Quote:""Transcoding can also refer to the encoding of files to a lower bitrate without changing video formats, a process that is also known as transrating.""
Keyword there, video! You are a poor EuGoogleizer. Try again and get back to me I rather enjoy this trivial distraction. BTW, stupidass? What are you 12?

,jaewon223,2007-11-09T10:44Z,FiNsTeRc just totally served you faelpsanfeel.  You may now shut up and go to your cave you stupid troll
,russer47,2007-11-09T23:23Z,"faelpsanfeel !!!

What about you did start to upload something usefull instead of complaining all the time i feel sorry for personalities like you , you´ll sid and wine all day like you had nothing better to do.

RUSSER = RUSSIA 
"
,ThreeDee,2007-11-10T02:52Z,Everyone (should) know that re-encoding a low quality 128 or 192 kbps album and releasing it again is a big no-no.
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-11-10T05:31Z,Just to clarify incase the previous comments have confused anyone. These tracks have not been upsampled!
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-11-11T02:11Z,"@ catgofire

Constructive criticism noted. I will include metadata from now on with my torrents."
,Hei_på-deg,2007-11-11T23:49Z,"Actually my father that recommended me this album^^
will give it a try."
,CesareBorgia,2007-11-12T17:37Z,"Just because the source is a CD means nothing because of the loudness wars. These days, usually a vinyl or DVD source is much better."
,aaron123d,2007-11-15T10:22Z,great quality but shit album thought it was gonna be better
,Assproking,2007-11-16T21:49Z,His Music is shit !
,thorfrias,2007-11-19T05:55Z,mga gago pala tao kaya puro lang pagyayabang ang ginagawa nyo....mag shashare lang kayo ng album dami nyo pa dakdak mga ulol.........! well i gues you dont know what the fuck im saying here..........!
,andytzu,2007-11-23T04:34Z,"http://odeo.com/audio/633407/view

Jay-Z = pure biter

Just like Kanye bites Rhymefests flow. All these mainstream faggets steal from real artists ... Happy pirating. "
,trippin7464,2007-11-25T08:36Z,"@andytzu You DO realize that the article you posted pretty much takes the blame off Jay Z and says that all rappers do it right? So i don't know why you are such a hater. I'm not a big fan of Jay Z but i don't go around HATING. It's ridiculous. If you don't like him, don't listen to him. I haven't listened to this album yet, but I hope it's good.
Anyways thanks FiNsTeRc for the upload."
,HomeHacker2,2007-11-26T13:04Z,"Nice Torrent. Clearly Explained and fast download, Thanks FiNsTeRc"
,nonameimd1,2008-01-17T00:51Z,Stop the arguing and enjoy the music ;D
,thrufirenback,2008-01-20T18:52Z,Thanks FiNsTeRc. My I-Tunes library is LuvN Ur WorK. Keep Up Da GudNess! 
,twhite50,2008-01-29T10:20Z,"can anyone tell me how to change the files from read-only so that i can add the artist, album, and remove the track # from the songs? i'm using iTunes to play them and it won't let me edit the tracks."
,twhite50,2008-01-29T10:26Z,"nvm, i got it... i kno u were all rushing to my rescue... lol."
,Granchy,2008-06-20T14:20Z,"I appreciate people uploading stuff, but to be honest the sound quality is horrible.  If you have a decent sound system you can hear how bad it is.  I don't get what happened with this, but thanks anyway."
,Neto420,2010-03-09T04:19Z,Thanks man!!
,MadHatter93,2011-08-10T09:45Z,"Aight guys, here's what it is. 

First up, for all you guys saying Jay-Z isn't shit, or is shit, or hating in any way, let me ask you this: If you don't like Jay-Z, why are you browsing for a torrent with his music? Save yourself the time and us the annoyance of reading through useless comments when deciding whether a torrent is legit or not. Thanks

Second, this track listing is completely correct, features, producers and everything. I grabbed a hard copy of this album, but have since lost it. However, this matches that album perfectly. iTunes removed it, so don't quote that please.

Third, transcoding can mean any number of things pertaining to code, so @FINsTeRc is completely correct in saying that while this is a transcode, it is a full quality rip. Please educate yourselves on things before you go making fools of yourselves. Unless you have a professional rig and quite a bit of hard drive space, nobody actually rips in CDDA format. It's impractical. If you really want fantastic quality, go buy the CD yourselves and rip into an OGG Vorbis or FLAC container, and quit complaining about things you get for FREE. 

Thank you, and remember, be kind to the internet, and it will be kind back =)"
