 If you want to play with other people, you have to decide how first:

a) You start a game and others join you

    Click on the OPTIONS menu. In the NETWORK options select connection type (Connection - LAN /Internet). Set the online players limit (Max Players - should be small if you have a slow internet connection). The game can be registered in the lobby server in internet games (REGISTER IN LOBBY SERVERS), so other players can find your game in the JOIN GAME servers search. Now select a game mode, some maps from the list and press START GAME in the first menu. If your game has been successfully registered in the lobby server you will get a message in the game.

b) You join a game

    Click on the JOIN GAME menu. If you know the IP address of the server you want to join then type it in the REMOTE HOST IP field. If you want to search for active servers in the internet or LAN, click REQUEST SERVERS. Double click or select a game from the list with the lowest PING time and with players on, then press JOIN GAME.
