,Montyskew,2007-11-03T02:48Z,"""How long will it be seeded?
A very short time by me.""

Must have been extremely short!!"
,Popocapetl,2007-11-03T10:05Z,"I didn't quite understand the comment by Monteskew. This is my first torrent and I may have done something wrong. It has been available without interruption from the moment it was uploaded. That's what I believe in any case. I can see that someone is downloading it right now, but slowly. I'd be glad for any advice or tips to make this work better."
,Popocapetl,2007-11-04T11:31Z,"Yes, that's odd. It says 0 seeders and 0 leechers here too, but someone is downloading it. If it doesn't work for you try contacting me at this address:
thickdick[at]bigfoot.com
And we'll try some other solution.

Everything on the ISO that isn't part of the normal Mac OS 8.6 CD has been placed in a folder named XTRAS, to avoid messing up the structure of the OS and the CD.
"
,Popocapetl,2007-11-05T11:35Z,"You can find the Mac OS compatibility chart by seaching for ""Mac OS 8.6 chart"" in Google. If you're somewhere at Apple's messy web pages search for article number 25114.

,zealotzuo,2008-01-19T06:04Z,Thanks for this brilliant file... I originally thought I wouldn't find it anywhere online.
,notoriousmdc,2008-01-28T06:15Z,"Thanks for posting, I'll gladly seed!"
,partyboy911,2008-03-01T21:10Z,"Is it possible to download this problem and just take ""Mariner Write + Calc"" from it? I am looking for that program.."
,photonut13,2008-03-06T23:56Z,"OMFG, you are a savior, I thought i would never find this. Thanks!!!!!"

,ProjektEva,2008-03-18T16:50Z,"@ Popocapetl and all those who seeded;

Done in 8 hours, will be seeding for the next couple of weeks. Fantastic upload and very very helpful for running my project 1400cs/133 running CF drives and wireless internet. Fun!

THANKS A MILLION!"
,srobot,2008-03-22T22:18Z,FAKE!!!!!
,srobot,2008-03-22T22:19Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!
,theGoodSeeder,2008-03-24T12:17Z,Can you only use this OS on a Mac computer?
,TokyoElbow,2008-04-23T14:11Z,"Nice one,
Just burnt it and popped it into my old Japanese OS'd iMac 333. Pressed C and it booted it all into English for me.

Cheers"

,killalot57,2008-05-14T20:35Z,"Hello, I downloaded it but I cant extract or mount the file with ""magic iso"" and when I try to extract it with winrar it says no archives found."
,killalot57,2008-05-14T20:37Z,"I'm talking about the iso image, I can extract the rar file fine but the iso image says ""The archive is either in unknown format or damaged"""
,Popocapetl,2008-05-21T17:51Z,"There's no point in mounting the ISO image if you're on anything other than a Mac OS Classic system. Power ISO can mount these ISOs, even under Windows. It can also extract files from the ISO. Which is pretty much pointless.

This ISO isn't meant to be mounted, it is meant to be burned to a CD. Like when Goldfinger says to 007, ""No Mr Bond. I don't want you to talk, I want you to die!"". Not the same thing, talking and dying, or mounting and burning...

So go forth and burn the image. In your burning application there should be a menue that says ""Burn image"" or something along that line.

"
,Popocapetl,2008-05-21T17:54Z,"I'd like to stop the seed of this one and upload another one, same as this, but with some small additions and corrections. There's a serial number missing for instance. How do I stop this torrent?"
,Miobamiubamiub,2008-08-12T13:15Z,"Well It don't mount. So what? Using os 7 i remember rare file system issue for cd stuff. That's probably it, this image MIGHT was cloned from a rare cd with os 7 compartble file system.
Anyway i just burned image as it is with whatewer, instaled the os and hey, i'm happy it runes well.
Thanks a lot!"
,jorllox,2008-08-12T23:44Z,"password?

please help! i need this for my old Mac"
,Popocapetl,2008-08-14T00:00Z,"@ jorllox

There's no password. "
,vans007,2009-05-05T11:46Z,thanks man.very good!!
,bluecrxnc,2009-06-18T12:58Z,"I've downloaded this twice on two different PC's, un-RAR'd which gives me the .ISO but none of my burning software likes it. All of them say invalid CD image. I've checked the hash several times which is why i downloaded it again to make sure nothing was wrong. 

What program did you guys use to burn with?"
,bluecrxnc,2009-06-18T13:03Z,Anyone care to share the MD5 Sum of the resulting .ISO? Thanks!
,misanthropic_pony,2009-06-19T22:24Z,"@bluecrxnc
I get the following MD5 checksum from the resulting ISO (named MacOS86.iso):
f300ea8ab0fe9f182d3341bd25f24bd8"
,bluecrxnc,2009-06-20T02:00Z,Gah! I've downloaded it several times and used various methods/programs to extract the .ISO and still only get an .ISO that I can't burn with a MD5 of 6d4c97c17e8b0a921eb5c063ed36eb6e  
,Axasus,2012-02-28T20:00Z,Hello. Works this on a Virtual Machine ?
