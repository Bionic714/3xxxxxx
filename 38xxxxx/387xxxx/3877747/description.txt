One of the few examples of the sub-genre of kung-fu westerns which appeared in the early 70s after "Red Sun" (1971, with Mifune and Bronson) and "Kung Fu" (the 1972 David Carradine TV show), the variously named "The Stranger and the Gunfighter" is short on the kung fu and long on the western...which is probably for the best, since Lo Lieh (who bears no relation to the poster art!) can't act his way out of a paper bag; and, as Jackie Chan once observed, it's hard to get off a decent kick when you're standing in sand.

The plot: Lieh's wealthy uncle has died, and the location of his treasure is in the form of a four-part code tattooed in Chinese characters on the bottoms of four ladies.
