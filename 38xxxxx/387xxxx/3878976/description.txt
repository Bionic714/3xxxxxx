OK, and why is there a .txt file the same as this nfo?
Well believe it or not I"M learning there are MANY n00bs out there that actually dont know to read the nfo

RIGHT CLICK ALL NFO'S AND OPEN WITH NOTEPAD.
RIGHT CLICK ALL NFO'S AND OPEN WITH NOTEPAD.
RIGHT CLICK ALL NFO'S AND OPEN WITH NOTEPAD.

So i've included this .txt only ONE time to try help them learn.
Amazing, but I guess we were all there at some point.
                                                                                         








-Crime Life Gang Wars-[RIP]  Konami(c)


The Game:

   Physically beat the shit out of people. Gang style.
   Gamespot trashed this game, I love it, so here ya go.
   Decide for yourself if you have'nt already.
   Graphics are less then good. But I'm all about the
   beat your ass type boxing gameplay. You just don't see that on PC.


more info:



ripped----> only movies



PERSONAL NOTE:

TO THE HATERS and those whom dis rips.
I rip games first and foremost as a hobby.
There's nothing like tearing a game down and rebuilding it to work only with what you need.
I fucking hate installing games, fuck install, unrar and play that's my fucking motto bitches.
Takes a skill that most will never understand. 

SEcond: I have MANY friends WORLDWIDE that do not have have high-speed bandwith.
Actually they don't even have the right to it that most of us take for granted.
I do this for me and I do this for them.
So FUCK YOU if you don't like rips and you most certainly should not be reading this if you do.
You downloaded it did'nt you?



eNOUGH SAID.
GO BEAT SOME ASS NOW.

Enjoy.
