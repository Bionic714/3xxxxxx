Once you have installed steam put the GCF (Game Cache Files) in the 'steamapps' folder, dlldman is rite though, unless you have paid for the game, a legit version of steam will not allow you to run it, your best bet would be to download either 'steambuster' and point it to the folder 'steamapps' or you could use a completly cracked version of steam called 'PacSteam'. Their are various other cracked steams also. Search Around."
,Toikkeli,2008-03-13T18:49Z,"SEED, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,shencereys,2008-04-27T03:31Z,"Okay I cant seed right now but heres my contribution.

To make this work, Zharld is right, you need to get PacSteam.  Theres a working copy here on TPB.  Install it and then copy all your The Ship extracted files to your SteamApps directory.  (Default: C:\program files\steam\steamapps)

Next run PacSteam. It might update correctly it might not, it doesn't matter don't worry if the update dosen't seem like its working it'll be fine.

Now open PacSteam inventory from your start menu and double click Steam Buster.  Then go to File > Settings > General tab.  Set the GCF files directory to where you copied your ""The Ship"" files to. (Default: C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps)  accept and shut down Pacsteam and Steambuster.  Start it up again and gratz you can install/play.

NEVER RUN PACSTEAM ONLINE UNLESS YOU WANT UR IP BANNED FROM STEAM"
,shencereys,2008-04-28T05:46Z,"Actually now that I posted that I'm fairly sure the copy of PACSTEAM that's on TPB right now has a trojan.  Don't get it, stay on the safe side and get it from the pacsteam main page - register for the forums if you want to get a working version otherwise you can't see the appropriate forums."
,Coolcitte,2008-08-06T17:49Z,"I have done everything Shencereys wrote down, but when IÂ´m trying to start The Ship ""Pacsteams cracked client"" says: ""You cannot download this game with Pacsteam"". What am I supposed to do, to make it work?"
,Coolcitte,2008-08-06T17:54Z,"I also tried to install The Ship in Steambuster, and a box with a message comes up: ""Installing"", this box disappears after a few seconds, and nothing happends... :("
,aand,2010-07-20T01:29Z,"Very nice gameplay in multilplayer. I'll upload an updated version.

PS: PacSteam is made by PacMan, a fagzor who steals other people's work. "
,aand,2010-07-21T03:07Z,"Done! Get it here:
