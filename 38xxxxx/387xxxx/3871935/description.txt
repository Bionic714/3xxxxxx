The mile high city is rocked when an ancient Egyptian menace comes to town, and the Denver Ghostbusters must return to save the universe once more.  In this sequel to the internet cult hit Freddy VS Ghostbusters, the boys in gray find themselves up to their eyeballs in spooks, as a greater threat looms on the horizon...

A talented cast and crew made up entirely of volunteers (see also: fanatics) worked over the internet and across borders for over two years.  Featuring dazzling special effects, an original score, and an engaging story inhabited by quirky characters, this feature length film is a truly one of a kind fan made experience.
