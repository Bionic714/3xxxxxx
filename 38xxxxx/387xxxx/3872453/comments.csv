,CaptainKirkard,2007-11-04T13:47Z,"To answer a question from the previous torrent:

""CaptainKirkard, If you or someone that actually bought this could look and see if in fact you do have this in your registry?""

Old registry entries:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows USB Host\eds bridge\lv994r2]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows USB Host\Din Controller\cssb2v6]


Entry i found using the PMDG744_Validation_Bypasser:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Abraxis\TheftTracking\MBX\htvx1]



I DO NOT have any entries for Abraxis, but I also have not installed the FSX version, so that may very well be why.


This is the updated version, released NOV3, and includes the FS9 updates as a separate installer."
,FUCKWOS,2007-11-04T14:37Z,"THANKS MAN!!

okie, well I think i have sorted this out, The new installer does make this entry into the reg,

abraxis is a ecommerce/internet solutions dealer so indeed pmdg went through them to distribute there product, so no harm no foul all is good and the PMDG is flying HIGH,

hope this installer fixes the livery issue im having, trying to figure out why i keep crashing to desktop after selecting a addon livery from there site? default livs work fine :-/

hard to believe they charge so much for this jet yet there are so many issues after how long in beta testing? lol

You must remember that SOMETIME a crack (of any sort) can have a signature that resemble a virus; you should check your AV settings for ""anti-hack tools"" or ""Anti-Piracy tools"" and uncheck those.

But in the end, it's your choice to make, you run the risk (and get a great piece of software) or you Buy it!!!
