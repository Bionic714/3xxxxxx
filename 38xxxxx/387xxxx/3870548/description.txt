This is version 2. the updates include:

1. new chapter menu with 12 extra chapters for the whole movie
2. subtitles for 2.0 pink floyd track
4. 4.1 pink floyd track made from master tape (thank you whoever made it)
5. tigher chapters
6. now chapter select doesnt start with pink floyd, you have to choose it in the audio menu

known issues are:
since the master tape ran an extra 13 seconds they both arent sync with each other, i personally like the Master track over the 20th anniversary edition. its a give or take, you lose the money "ching" as you enter the color but you gain a tight sync up on alot of other Qs. so you choose. your vote will be what makes version 3 complete.

Coming soon: (dont hold out on version 2, its gonna be a while before v3)
1. transision videos and music in menus
2. another rework of the chapters with a picture to go along with it.
3. DTS track (if encore wasnt so dumb)
4. better Q sync and subtitles
