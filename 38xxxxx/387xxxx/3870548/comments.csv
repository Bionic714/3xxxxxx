I have a few questions if you don't mind ansering:
1. I heard that the dvd releases of Wiz of Oz have cut out a part of the movie in which a man is supposed to have hanged himself in the background of the scarecrow scene, is this part included in the dvd? (i heardonly vhs has it)
2. What is the difference between the two versions sync wise, i would love to help you determine what to do in version 3, i couldn't really understand from your notes
I am dl v2 now but i have crappy dsl so it takes4ever to dl dvdr should i also dl v1 is there a big difference b/c i will get both if i need to
again ty for this, i always wanted to do this with the vhs tape and my dark side cd but the vhs of this are always in bad shape, but i must say i did see the guy hanging in the background on the vhs tape when i watched it, syncing the video with the cd is tough but when you r trippin balls anything looks like it is syncing :)"
