,TehZorroness,2007-11-12T00:28Z,"Seriously.  Winzip?  Haven't we grown up.  Use a free software archiver man.  Not all of us are using Windows.

Fortunately, it seems that WINE was able to handle it properly, but I cant convince myself to seed something packaged so wrongly."
,TehZorroness,2007-11-12T00:32Z,"nope, this is useless on GNU/Linux.  -_-"
,sramberg,2007-11-12T04:12Z,"Then fuck off an find it somewhere else. Quit bitchin about it.    


Thanks for the up man"
,Esset88,2007-11-15T21:21Z,"Till er som använder Linux/GNU så funkar programmet 7zip utmärkt till winzipfiler. Jag vet att 7zip finns i Debian-, SUsE-, och Ubuntureleaserna och säkert till många fler."

,itix,2008-06-05T02:11Z,"Seconded on linux....

We linux ppl don't want useless formats like .zip which don't compress more than 2 % anyway.

Try tar.gz which usually compress up to 60 %"
,mistajack88,2008-08-13T16:12Z,"Works great. Works online sometimes, but it has always done that, if you want to play I suggest you write down the IP addresses to your favorite servers that way you can play 24/7. :)
So there you go, it works like its out of the box, meaning it is a very good download. All support in seeding!"

,mac_GR,2011-03-23T12:41Z,"just started downloading. will seed too for at least 3-4 days.

@EveryOne : please note that sometimes a torrent might be good but for some reasons it might not work on several machines. you can't just say that this works fine or not. All of us ,we don't use same OS , same GPU , or drivers... (yes in the past ,I had some issues and fixed them by updating my graphics card drivers or directX or GL blah blah blah.)

You want to play for free ? Just try installing and then you will see. Google if any issues comes up.

SEED SEED SEED
otherwise the whole thing with torrents client will not work."
,dmpq3a,2011-04-01T21:46Z,"Just downloaded, really fast ~3minutes ;) But maybe someone can help me? I need some working servers, to play online ;)
