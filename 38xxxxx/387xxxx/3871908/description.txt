OK, I guess the name doesn't say it all.  This is not a program about putting up subtitles on a movie.  It's a man in drag singing rather poignant songs (well and some not so very poignant). And he looks remarkably like the vegetarian aryan named Adolf.

I thought this was one of my more interesting offerings.

From VHS, and unfortunately a slightly eaten one.
