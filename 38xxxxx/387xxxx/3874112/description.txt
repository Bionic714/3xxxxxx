TerraBuilder Moon is a comprehensive expansion package that turns Flight Simulator's entire Earth scenery into a highly detailed world of craters, lava channels, rilles and dusty regolith (lunar soil). This is not just a localised scenery that you can "fly out" of, or an enclosed arena with a roof  for a sky that will simulate the lunar enviroment on a scale of a few square kilometers... Entire Flight Simulator environment, the whole Earth, is completely transformed, from a diverse rainbow of landscape variations that our planet offers, to one of the "Magnificent Desolation"
