""A Required Component is inaccessible.Please make sure none of the Flight Simulator`s files or folders are in use or are being shared.""

,Panodilo,2007-12-31T22:17Z,"The config program does indeed not work, but you can still enjoy this addon, bitch asses. What you do is go into your FS9 folder, observe that a number of folders are named TB at the end. MOVE your original folders (scenery, UIRES, etc) to a different location. When the original folders have been removed from FS9, simply change the names of the Terrabuilder folders, in essence, remove the TB from the names. Don't forget to do the same for suneffect.cg and scenery.cfg. Otherwise your computer is going to struggle finding a spot for KLAX on the moon. Also, before I forget. Suck my fat dirty pecker and swallow my love juice."
,far_isle,2008-01-13T21:54Z,we need a few seeders.  I just can't wait to see how this torrent trashes my fs9 setup!! I love to spend 3 months reinstalling everything to the way it was! yipee!  ouch.  Is it true that this one is going make my bulimia come back? :)
,AdmiralSirJohn,2008-01-27T14:53Z,"Could we have some more seeds for this, or maybe a working serial for the newest version?
