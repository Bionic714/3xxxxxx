,thesearchery,2008-09-07T12:37Z,the file extension is .nrg which is not supported by real player or media player.  What player do I need as I cannot open file.
,noid_noid,2009-01-15T02:02Z,.nrg is used by Nero (their version of .iso)
,old-dominion,2011-03-11T20:06Z,nrg is proprietary.  Even VLC doesn't have it.  Who would want that?
