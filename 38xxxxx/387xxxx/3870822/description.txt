Mia was born in 1947 in Bagnara Calabra (province of Reggio Calabria, southern Italy), but soon she moved to Rome with her sister (Loredana BertÃ¨) and her friend Renato Zero. Both of them would eventually become successful singers too.

She recorded her first records as MimÃ¬ BertÃ¨, but she soon decided to change her name to the more appealing Mia Martini.

Her biggest hits were "Piccolo Uomo", which was recorded in several languages, "Almeno tu nell'universo", which is considered her masterpiece and has been covered by several famous Italian singers including Mina and Elisa, and "Minuetto" among many others.

She represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest twice: in 1977 with "Libera" (13th out of 18), and in 1992 with "Rapsodia" (4th out of 23).

Her career ended tragically in 1995 when she was found dead under mysterious circumstances in her apartment at Cardano al Campo, near Milan. She most likely committed suicide.
