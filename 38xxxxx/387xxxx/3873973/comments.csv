,Hazode,2008-09-28T18:59Z,"Well, I'm gonna trust some people here and download. If it doesn't work or has a virus I will be very upset. On the other hand, if it works I will be VERY happy, as I've seen the things that this can do, and you would have saved me the best part of ÂŁ90"
,Hazode,2008-09-29T08:18Z,OK torrent is done. No viruses. But it's an old version and downloading the new version would need the uploaders account info. FYI The version that is downloaded here doesn't have the lasers from the newer one on the FXHome website.
