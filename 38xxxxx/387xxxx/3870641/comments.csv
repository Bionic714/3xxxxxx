,ScorpDan,2007-11-03T02:49Z,re uploaded this per instructions using the vip tracker from velvetfog.  Previous torrent was..http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3870579 which apparantly wasn't working right.
,ScorpDan,2007-11-03T03:12Z,"I hope I'm not doing anything wrong.  Azuerus says 0/2 peers connected, and I'm at 0kbs up, but TPB says 2 downloaders...  I followed TPB tutorial on uploading through Az.  Ratio- OK,  Nat- OK..  am I doing something wrong?  When I download torrents I can upload them fine when they are done, or does this mean the other people on here haven't actually opened the torrent file yet? Oh well.. hopefully it works out."
[V],velvetfog,2007-11-03T03:46Z,"You haven't started seeding yet, as far as I can tell. I have had my Azureus client running your torrent  for 2 1/2 hours now. Still nothing."
[V],velvetfog,2007-11-03T03:52Z,"Ooopps!  Ignore previous.

I am on this revised torrent now.
It is running."
,ScorpDan,2007-11-03T03:57Z,"yeah the other tracker didn't work.  the vip one you told me about does.. thank you.

although, a 30mpbs/15mpbs connection...and it's only upping at 3-12kbs...what's up with that? LOL  Is it because of the people down limit that i'm upping to?  I'm not using any of my bandwith anywhere else expect typing this."
,ScorpDan,2007-11-03T13:23Z,"Please let me know how the quality is, and if I need to up the bitrate for future rips.. etc.."
,pody,2007-11-03T15:53Z,"well, i see that there is alot os seeders and liechers..
