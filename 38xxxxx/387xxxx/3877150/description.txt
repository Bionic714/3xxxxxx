PLOT:
An adaptation of the hit Broadway play, which was in turn inspired by
the 1988 John Waters classic, chubby teenager Tracy Turnblad (Nicole Blonsky)
will do anything to get on Corny Collins' (James Marsden) local Baltimore dance show,
even if it means defying her parents Edna (John Travolta in drag) and Wilbur
(Christopher Walken). And when she eventually makes it on the rock 'n' roll progam,
she surprisingly becomes the hit of the city, much to the consternation of the previous dancing queen,
Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), who will do anything to dethrone her competition.
