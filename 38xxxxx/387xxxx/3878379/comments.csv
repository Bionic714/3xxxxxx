,damndoper,2012-08-10T11:08Z,"I 2nd rarson... what's the bitrate? 62mb seems awfully small for a full-length album. I appreciate the upload, but if you have a hard copy of this album, can you rip & upload at least 320kbps. I'm not asking for FLACs, but come on my friend.  This album can't be any higher than 128kbps. 128 was acceptable back in the days of Kazaa, limewire, and dial-up internet. But it no longer takes 30 minutes to download one song. It takes 30 minutes to download discographies LOL. "
,damndoper,2012-08-10T11:28Z,"My apologies bojan. These tunes at 192 is acceptable. I apologize that I assumed it was 128. I'm still reeling from picking up a 3-disc compilation that took days to procure because of lack of seeders, just to find out the whole thing was ripped at 64kbps. It sounds worse than AM radio LOL. Anyway, I apologize again for the lengthy post complaining that this album must've been ripped at 128. 192 is fine. And THANK you for uploading this gem :)"
