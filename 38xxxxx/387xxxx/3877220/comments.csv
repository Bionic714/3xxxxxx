,alanwatts,2007-12-03T11:36Z,"Can someone tell me if this REALLY is the 2nd ED? Ive been trying to download this over and over again from different torrentsites. And usually its just the ""symposium edition"" or something else. It has never ever been the REAL 2nd ED of Terrorstorm. Please confirm!"
,alanwatts,2007-12-04T13:38Z,THIS IS NOT THE 2ND EDITION. IN THE SECOND EDITION ALEX IS STANDING ON THE STREET TALKING IN THE BEGINNING. THIS IS SOME SORT OF SYMPOSIUM EDITION. WHY DO YOU UPLOAD STUFF AND GIVE IT FALSE NAMES?
,alanwatts,2007-12-04T13:54Z,"Where can I find a TRUE 2ND edition of Terrorstorm? Please direct me, I would be very glad. "
,alanwatts,2007-12-23T16:35Z,Please can someone comment my questions. I might be totally wrong in the question about if this truley is a correct 2ND edition. In the google version alex is standing in the street talking in the begininng and this one does not have that. Several versions of the 2nd?
,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:16Z,"For all listeners of Alex Jones and Coast to Coast AM, check out the following torrent:

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

Alex speaking before the movie started was ONLY on the web stream version. thats why he advertised where to get the dvd in that intro...

i'm downloading this now, based on the root menu THIS IS THE 2ND EDITION (or final cut or what ever is the latest). you can tell by downloading that first 61mb vob and comparing the menu's like this (symposium one not included because it says symposium what ever in big letter on that dvd but not this one)
1st retail release: http://snipr.com/30zjr
2nd edition (this torrent): http://snipr.com/30zk5"
,death734,2008-07-19T06:28Z,"also does anyone know if this is recompressed or not?
i'm quite sure alex has been making the DVD's at dvd5 size since at least endgame but i dont know how long they have been doing that and mean while this came out a few months before endgame..."
,death734,2008-07-21T22:39Z,"triple comment, whatever...

as claimed before and now verified this is the 2nd edition so dont listen to alanwatts.
quality is quite good so if not just done at dvd5 size by infowars (most likely they did it) then it was a good recompression (as apposed to dvdshrink junk)."
,ericcmi,2008-11-15T04:31Z,Thanks for the suggestion level1online. I've been waiting to see this one.
,spartos,2009-01-03T00:11Z,"Thanks for uploading this vital truth DVD RedDelPaPa and thanks to all the seeders.
