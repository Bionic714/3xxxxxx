Episode 018: Selecting Selections (Part 2)

Selections are widely used in Gimp. Select something to work only on that, to cut or copy it, to move it aroundâ?¦..

In this show I cover the â??fuzzy select toolâ??, the â??select by colour toolâ??, the â??intelligent scissorsâ?? and the â??foreground select toolâ??.
