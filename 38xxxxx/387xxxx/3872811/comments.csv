Please with butter and jam etc etc can someone who has the complete avi file seed this? I will be eternally grateful. A very Happy Christmas to the whole bunch of you!!! Thanks a million!"

It seems to have two missing pieces at the very beginning of the torrent. I was so happy when I ran across this torrent because I had been looking for this for a long time. It only came out on VHS but was never released on DVD. It is a fairly large resolution, with sharp sound. If only it was complete. Better than nothing."
