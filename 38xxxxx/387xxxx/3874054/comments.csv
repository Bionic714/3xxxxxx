,Halbermunken,2007-11-05T20:22Z,I hope they won't release this with the game..how mediocre.

Finns något som heter kopieringsskydd ^^ En clone borde nog komma snart, men en fullt crackad variant dröjer med all största sannolikhet lite.

,neverwinternight,2007-11-11T05:57Z,"God, people find something to complain about everything! these guys just spent their time to get us something for free and yet we are complaining about this being the bonus content only! 

What else do you expect from the bonus DVD? A crysis expansion??"
,lechampion,2007-11-21T05:41Z,"Yes neverwinternight,that's thrue!!! The contend is write in the description...Zamorak1,next time, read before download..."
,JoeKool,2008-01-19T21:05Z,"Noob question of the day.  How do I get the 001, 002, etc archive files together?  I tried using HJSplit but it made a file without an extension and I don't know what it's supposed to be.  "
,xiIix,2008-04-17T22:05Z,"This isn't just trailers, it's an HD video interview of the Crysis team talking about development. There is also a few other interesting videos as well. Though I think the size is a little overkill on the WMVHD vid, I found it to be worth the download."
