,pigman_1,2008-06-30T21:00Z,fuck my ass.  .tar?  did somebody just make this format up? i'll figure it out. FUCK SALT!
[T],my_name_is_bob,2008-11-04T01:04Z,"yea i coulda, people didnt used to sneak bad things into archives and there wasnt used to be fakes going around so i didnt think it mattered at the time, this ones already seeded and years old now i prolly wont redo it"
,RMo9,2009-07-03T09:31Z,"Okay, for those wondering about .tar, no this is not a fake archive file, this is an old file compression method, so tus making this movie needing an older version of WinRAR.

This file is in fact a good copy of an old movie, if you do not have WinRAR, my 7Z extracted it greatly.

Cheers to the uploader for a great hit!"
