[V],He0n,2007-11-07T20:31Z,"RELOADED who previously released Gears of War decided that there release was rubbish and nuked their own release (Nuke: grp.req). This is probably down the fact that the installer is in the wrong language (can be easily fixed) and maybe a bad crack. Dont worry though because Razor1911 are back again for the second time in a few hours to bring us a (fingers crossed) fully working crack for this awesome game. If you in the process of have downloaded any of the older releases all you need is this crack which some nice person in the comments can help you out with. Hopefully Razor have learned from there mistakes and this should be the fully working, 100% working, bona fide, final crack for this game."

,EzRaEl,2007-11-12T04:42Z,"problems resolved. works great. do not use winzip or 7-zip to extract, use WINRAR to get a proper .ISO, manually mount with daemon,install (takes a while to decompress all the files),copy the crack over, make sure you have the latest video drivers, run the game(you may have to install an AMD driver), create a LOCAL profile, play the game. This game works excellent with a 360 controller. AWESOME."

other than that, hoping this works on my gaming machine =) also thanks for the alternate download, the 100:2000 seeder leecher ratio on the other one was a little overwhelming."

,smiledskateboarding,2008-01-05T19:17Z,lol i been played this game on xbox 360 and it isnt a intro movie. it realy starts with 14 days after e-day..
,rich8606,2008-01-06T09:02Z,"o.O

No intro? whatsoever? How about the origin of of the Locusts? What about the story on how Marcus ended up in prison? also some of the level jumps seems disjointed, it's like some cutscenes are missing. Also, the prerendered cutscenes jumps and skips, is this a problem with the game or with my comp?"
,rich8606,2008-01-07T01:17Z,"I did a bit of research. Here's what I found: There are ONLY 3 pre-rendered cutscenes in the game. They can all be found in Microsoft Games/Gear sof War/Wargame/movies: the files are: Attractmode.bik, the intro movie I was looking for, HOSoutro.bik, the ambush after the tomb level and Cave.bik, the cutscene where the resonator explodes. The intro movie (Attractmode.bik) only plays if you stay at the ""press start"" screen looooong enough (I kid you not, they go on forever!!)

Now, in the folder, you'll also find: ESRB.bik (sometimes ESRB_chin.bik, ESRB,kor.bik, etc), Epiclogo.bik, MSLogo.bik, if you remove these files (or delete them altogheter) the game will skip the unskipable ESRB warning, Epic logo and Microsoft Game studios logo on startup. "

Download into a folder - 2 files : .iso and .nfo
Used Deamon Tools and mouted .iso file and installed the game into a directory. - had to close down torrent program.
after installation go to RAZOR folder in the mounted image disk and copy/paste it into the installation folder.

Run and play.

if game crashes like it did to me just install direct X from the virtual disk and download latest VGA drivers!

it did work for me and im playing it.

One question though and hope someone answers. yesterday the game liked crashed and my pc made an auto-restart. Is it from the cooling system? cause of overheating? or?"

,A123Z,2008-03-22T17:26Z,"@korak031:
You might want to check how you formatted your hard disk. You probably have a FAT32 disk, which means you can't write files bigger than 4G to it. Maybe you can make a partition on your disk and format it to NTFS, that will solve your problem.

@ Everyone that has problems installing:
1. Unrar the files with winrar or 7-zip
2. Mount the .iso file with Daemon Tools (http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5)
3. Let the autoplay do its magic and start installing (takes ages btw :S). Also disable the option to start the game after installing.
4. Copy the Startup.exe from the mounted disc (GEARSOFWAR/Razor1911/Startup.exe) to the install folder ""Binaries"" in your GoW folder (it should ask you to overwrite the normal Startup.exe file, if this doesn't happen you're in the wrong folder).
5. Start the game through the Startup.exe file you just copied, make a shortcut to your desktop if you prefer that.

@ The people having problems saving:
Did you make a profile? I think that you need a profile to save the game, which is done automatically I think."
,Atlas305,2008-03-22T18:11Z,"Ok I downloaded a couple days ago and got around to installing and cracking it yesterday. Works perfect! I needed to update my dual processor driver (which was a prompt by the game, so it was as easy as clicking a button) and OMG!!!!@! NO WONDER THIS GAME WON SOOOO MANY AWARDS!!!!! it Looooooks Drop Dead   Gorgeous!~ and the play is out of this world!!! So, sorry for not commenting yesterday after install to say the torrent works fine, no viruses/trojans, and Easy install. Thanks Razor.    

What I recommend to people that cant get this going right... 
*Get MAjic .ISo  ~ its a free program~ and           extract the Razor1911 file.
* mount the disk to a virtual drive using ISO
*install ( i had no need for a registration key)
*go to c: , then windows folder, then programs folder, then microsoft games folder, then Gears of War folder, then Binary Folder.
*copy the Start-up.exe from the Razor folder to a blank space in the binary folder, then choose 'replace' when prompted
*start game by double clicking the desktop icon
*create profile in the game but do not sign up for windows live or register online (after creating profile just exit out via the top right box
*click play in the bottom right hand corner and fuckin ENJOY!! i know I HAVE so far.. 9 hrs i played yesterday and am thirsty for more! WooT!"

Check your firewall.

Download the patch with a crack located in a comment above mine and install that, it includes an original startup.exe in it so you don't have to worry about that.

,The_Abbott_77,2009-04-14T02:20Z,TO PEOPLE HAVING PROBLEMS SAVING GAME: I had the same problem...loaded crack correctly went to continue game and it asks you to sign in. People have been saying to create offline account from within game. Most fail to mention to press the HOME button after you start the new campaign. So start the new campaign and press HOME to create offline account and it will work. That is important because you can't create offline account from the main menu.  The only thing I noticed is that I can no longer quicksave after doing that but it does save the checkpoints and allow you to continue from where you left off. Whomever posted that thanks alot you solved it for me because it doesn't prompt you to press HOME at all and it's the only way to create offline account....good luck and thanks

When I install the game and after copying the crack it says I need to put in the correct DVD. What gives, this torrent only creates one. Do I really need to search through the whole file system on the cd and follow the directions above, cause I can't find that second file it says too install. I'm seeding like a big bitch so please someone help me out. "
