,Zerom,2007-11-19T04:22Z,"Details for file extension: UIF - Magic ISO Universal Image Format File (MagicISO Inc.) 

u need to download MagicISO to use it :("
,daz87uk,2007-12-22T13:59Z,"come of guys its just compressed image file, get iso magic extract and you will have all the songs in mp3. its not rocket science most torrent files are compressed in some form to save space quicker to download. now im gonna try this torrent and see what you all moaning about.. xD"
,daz87uk,2007-12-22T14:15Z,"if you guys were keen downloaders you would have all the correct programs heres a list that will keep you all good for any file extensions: Vlc Media player  , Divx codecs, power iso, magic iso, xilisoft video converter, nero start smart, daemon tools, winrar and dvd shrink that should be all you need each program as some different file extension it supports so you will need them all for the odd strange format. you can get all those programs here or the free ones on google now you have no reason to complain coz the answer to your problems is right here xD"
,kelv1969,2008-07-07T00:37Z,"would have been a lot easier to upload this as a folder of separate songs, in mp3 format. downloaders can choose just the songs they want then. let's make life easier for the world hey?"
