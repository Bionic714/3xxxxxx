Elders of Brood, a WoW guild that has been active for almost 2.5 years has ended it's raiding days. To "celebrate" this event we did one final raid in the same place it all began: Molten Core.

I would like to thank all people who made this possible, especially "Wildfire" the heart and soul of the guild.


Again, i uploaded this torrent mainly for the people in the guild, but if you're interested please feel free to download it.

Signed,
RonnieW (proud member since the start)
