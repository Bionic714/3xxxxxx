,sicjedi,2010-09-11T18:36Z,"yah, it's 2010 and i'm getting no seeders but sitting at 99.3% done.... I think that's as good as it might ever get. I did check; you can listen to all the songs at this level of completeness--might have been a download error of some sort.

I would love to find the Sepia song Collapsing somewhere... that song rocks!!!"
