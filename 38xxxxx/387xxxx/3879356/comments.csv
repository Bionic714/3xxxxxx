,baboonbob,2007-12-19T17:20Z,"If anyone out there has any recordings or video of Dr.Gene Scott, I would be very interested in having a copy of it. It can be audio tapes, VCR tapes, CD, DVD, anything at all. I will gladly pay for the shipping, plus a little something for your trouble. I want to post it on my site... http://www.genescottteachings.multiply.com

Please feel free to visit the site. If you have anything, please contact me here, or at the site. Sincere thanks."
,baboonbob,2007-12-23T04:48Z,"I am anxiously awaiting the upload of any and all future Gene Scott lectures. I'm doing my part to see that the world beyond the Bay has an opportunity to hear them. Keep up the GOOD work!

,baboonbob,2007-12-23T05:48Z,"PS - I also intend to keep seeding these current Gene Scott torrents for as long as I'm able to run torrents, so help me God"
,baboonbob,2007-12-29T17:13Z,"Hey aaron, if you'd like some help, I'd be delighted to rip some of those tapes for you. Let me know."
,forward_ho,2008-03-06T01:09Z,"IMPORTANT NOTE - The MP3s in this torrent were all taken from the larger torrent called ""Gene Scott - Lectures Removed From His Website Immediately After His Death.""     Unless you are ONLY interested in the UFO subject, I'd recommend you downloa that torrent instead.   You'll be getting all of these and more."
,Nsngwii2283,2008-11-16T01:05Z,"No offense to aaronhahn777, or even Mr. Scott, but unfortunately Mr. Scott was won into the illusion of getting rich.  Gene Scott allowed himself to fall into a life that worshiped money. I'd recommend William Cooper if you want to hear a well informed, well educated man. Mr. Cooper also told his audience to research every thing. Take nothing at face value."
