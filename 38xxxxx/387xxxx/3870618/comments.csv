 Or ...just try and see.

 Do you believe that you keep more seeders this way ? Who would wait 6 months for 1 Gb ? When download stops, probably most ppl will delete the torrent. ...It's just Stupid !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,bogdanlucian,2007-11-24T23:26Z,"there are many many seeders on this torrent !!!1 but you'll see how..after you download like 25 % ..suddenly download will stop , or go to 2kb/s and upload will be like 300 or even 600 kb/s - don't mind the upload- i keep a torrent that is good even when it reaches to 30 to 1 ratio, but somebody is playing with the downloads...!!!!

Just keep the torrent at 25 % for 1 week and see ...how it does not go any farther ( with so many seeder !!!) 

Shame on some ppl - shame !"

He was and will always be remembered as a superstar an a kiddie fiddler. Wonder if Garry Glitter will get the same loving send off?

oh well read this too lol Gary Glitter has filed a lawsuit on the heels of pop star Michael Jackson's death. The lawsuit contends that the contents of Jackson's Little Black Address Book has an equal amount of names contributed by Glitter over the years.

The book supposedly contains the names of over 7,000 young boys in the LA area and was only recently discovered by a maid working for Jackson. "
