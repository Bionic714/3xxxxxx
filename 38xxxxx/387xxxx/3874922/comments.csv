,Snarkyispirate,2008-01-07T18:58Z,"This has no singleplayer? 

crap id say"
,TheSilverDragon,2008-01-19T01:06Z,"No singleplayer and multiplayer update says ""One moment please"" forever; can only join games. Pretty much useless."
,c93,2008-01-24T05:00Z,"yeah i forgot to mention that there is no single player..

but you can host games. your ports need to be open to host so others can join your game.
but it's mainly for multiplayer.

thats halo CE
cause players can edit maps and play them online. "
