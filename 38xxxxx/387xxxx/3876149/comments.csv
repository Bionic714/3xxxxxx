*NOT SAYING ITS FAKE*"
,JimLayhey,2007-11-10T02:21Z,Anyone know if this is SP1 or Sp2?
,roer4227,2007-11-12T00:57Z,"What program to use for burning CD?
Newer seen .uif files before ?"
,JimLayhey,2007-11-12T02:08Z,"I just downloaded it and the compaq.txt file says it is only for compaqs's. And this torrent says it's ""Windows Xp Pro Universal Installation Cd"". What the fuck is it really for?"
,TheTechJunkie,2007-11-12T23:56Z,"Stop moaning. This is the universal cd i forgot to remove that compaq text file.
Not sure what Sp it is but you can download and install sp2 if its not on there. The cd key works on sp1 & sp2.

As for saying fucking British well fuck you ,you stupid Canadian dipshit. You couldnt program to save your life. Even the americans could beat you at that."
,leviticuz,2007-11-13T17:31Z,"Okay first of all this torrent blows cock. I sit there thru the installation, format one of my drives, have the disc toss all the files on the drive and reboot. And then I get the error ""Missing file /system32/ntoskrnl32.exe""

so for all you wonderful people downloading this gay ass torrent, enjoy having your hard drive fucked up!"
,007ace,2007-11-16T03:44Z,"Seriously, how can you not know if an OS you uploaded is SP 1 or SP2 ?
and to flame the potential downloaders doesn't say anything for your case either.
To call it a universal installation CD and then have it strictly set up for UK English and time, is a flat out lie.
I havent downloaded this and don't plan on downloading it, but come on. 
Post the best work you can and don't lie when describing it to the public"
,hydro4life,2007-11-16T04:24Z,ya not just that its only for compaq computers
,repka1,2008-04-12T12:00Z,"hi!

thats a funny custom install within, with a nice girl on the right side, unattended mostly.

anyway, i DO NOT RECOMMEND to use it.
its probably full of dangerous malware.

so its suitable for joking your buds, but not for normal use."
,mike18xx,2008-09-08T00:07Z,"What I'm ****REALLY LOOKING FOR**** is a means to edit XP such that an already installed Windows volume can be copied ad-infinitum to other drives, and those drives will boot any PC. (You may have to scrounge drivers, but that's not a concern compared to the ease of OS installation.)"
