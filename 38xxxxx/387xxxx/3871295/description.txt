Windows XP Professional CD-Key



This version of Windows XP Pro with Service Pack 2 will not ask you to activate. It is a copy used in many colleges to teach students the installtion process of Windows XP. It is, however, a full version of XP, and it has all the extras Windows XP is known to have. This release will also allow you to log on to Microsoft.com and use Windows Update with no problem. The CD is expected to be copied multiple times. I hope you all enjoy this release and hopefully its the last release you will ever have to download.
