,limpezkit,2008-06-29T01:53Z,"hey, been trying to do this all night and still not got it working.  Trying to copy the extracted .nrg file using another ISO burning software, it's burning it onto disc as 'WINXPPROITT.nrg'  is this correct? or do i need to convert it somehow?  I'm using 'Free create-Burn ISO image'.   Also tried putting it in comp and it's just saying 'insert bootable media in selected drive'   

Thanks for help in advance. 

Oh and this is a new build comp (my first) and am not too good wit bios etc. Was just hoping to stick windows disc in and thats it. lol.  

Thanks again."

[T],all_american_anti_virus,2008-08-05T05:10Z,"OK a friend of mine totally destroyed his puter. Last time I helped a friend out by reinstalling I had to install PowerIso first so it could read the disk. In this case the computer wont go past the Bios screen, so I cant install PowerIso. Will the disk still be readable? What do I burn it as to make it readable in Bios? Normally I would try again and again until I got it right. In this case, the friend is a co-worker and I dont have full access to their puter with my laptop. Also, I dont want word spread about my various software disks. So, I need to get this right in the first attempt. Any help?"

,budman316,2008-11-20T17:54Z,"If you are getting the fatal error when installing, unhook cd rom and hook up another one, 9 out of 10 times it will work then.  I have used this version for years with original serial included and it works great.  Im installing it now on a machine and the machine is brand new.  The DVD does not like these cd's i made ( 6 total of this Windows XP ) and it hates all of them.  Swapped the drive out just to get a complete install and it works just fine.
"
,ramartinez63,2009-01-20T06:30Z,"okay, crap, I installed everything perfectly and it is running fine.  BUT, WGA recognized it as a counterfeit copy of windows.  How in the phuck to I fix this?"
,Conor0909090909,2009-02-13T22:41Z,"Same!
