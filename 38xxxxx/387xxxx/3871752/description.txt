On this little oddball concept album, Sheryl Crow invites you into her living room so she can play the records from her collection that have most influenced and inspired her. When compiled onto one disc, the collection makes total sense. Bob Dylan is represented, as are Carole King, James Taylor, the Pretenders and Squeeze. From Elton John's "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" to The Band's "The Weight," it is apparent that Crow didn't rattle off tunes that she thought would make her sound cool and informed. Instead, she took the project seriously and, with thoughtfulness, stitched together a musical quilt that she feels has warmed her sound. This is a must-have for anyone interested in songwriting and songwriters, or Sheryl Crow.
