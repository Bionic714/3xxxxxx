,#ZeuS//,2007-11-07T14:34Z,not a real aXXo
,the_crazy_swede,2007-11-07T14:43Z,"not from axxo's account so i reccomend that you get his...he want's you to download from HIS personal account. axxo, you pwn3"
,sourgrapes,2007-11-07T14:56Z,There go the lammers again now trying to piss moviebobo off. Believe that this is a reseed to keep aXXo's stuff up and running on pirates bay. everyone that has a aXXo file should do the same.
,Mahs,2007-11-07T15:06Z,Very fucking agreed..
,Stefanzon,2007-11-07T16:09Z,"Who the F**k cares if this is aXXos rip or not? As long as the quality is good I see no problem.

Btw, DiAMOND, FLAiTE, mVs, iMBT and DoNE kicks aXXos ass Big Time !"
[T],moviebobo,2007-11-07T16:23Z,I uploaded this torrent so that people still can enjoy aXXo files at TPB.
,Amerialb,2007-11-07T16:55Z,extremely stupid movie
,KKELTIKK,2007-11-07T17:37Z,"Excellent idea sourgrapes, if we all got off our asses we could have all of aXXos movies back on as reseeds! Great moviebobo! I am off to do my part."
,emiiil,2007-11-07T18:28Z,Great movie. Where has axxo gone? Keep seeding and giving out his old stuff!
,KILLGORE666,2007-11-07T18:40Z,I agree a good movie is is good regardless of who puts it up.Still AXXO has brought lots of good shit and is a name that can be trusted.Thanx Moviebobo
,Tronblue,2007-11-07T18:47Z,"This & other torrent boards are driven by ads and how many hits one gets per day avg. If they want people to visit this site for the ad dollars I'd imagine they could & should protect an asset to this board. aXXo is an asset to any torrent board, people trust his uploads and his name. 

The volume of traffic to this site will screech to a halt once aXXo starts releasing rips on other sites and leaving this one out. 

Wake up TPB. Protect uploaders & contributers from fakes/viruses & slander when possible. If you do nothing you invite or even condone these attacks.

I will also be looking into Mininova for my future rips."
,BigDickBubba,2007-11-07T19:00Z,"This movie is not funny. It's a poor rip off of Napolean Dynamite basically.  

Good quality though. "
,metroplex02,2007-11-07T19:38Z,"axxo took his list off because of constant fakers posting bunk shit under his name. i'd be pissed too. go to torrentbox to find his list of uploaded files, that is the site he mostly releases to anyways. so stop fucking faking and maybe we'll have something decent to download off PirateBay"
,hipaku,2007-11-07T20:32Z,Is ther any other site that have an top 100 movies list? Only tpb have it what I have seen.
,Zjohn,2007-11-07T20:41Z,"Well all the honours to moviebobo! Still though he could add in teh name or somewhere on this board thats its a re-seed from an aXXo file.. ~ Sorry for bad grammar notan native English ""speaker"" :)"
,bama19642,2007-11-07T21:37Z,"I dont know how to post original seeds, but I've reset my uTorrent preferences to seed aXXos movies that I still have to 1000%. So I'll give back 10 to 1 to keep those that I still have alive. 

Come back aXXo......

Those others that were mentioned are not the same, i.e., 700mb dl for great quality.

 Did someone say Minova is where to look for his latest releases? I'm off to see the wizard..."
,metroplex02,2007-11-07T23:06Z,"http://axxo-release.blogspot.com/

thats where you can find them all"
,Stefanzon,2007-11-07T23:26Z,"Forza DiAMOND, FLAiTE, mVs, iMBT and DoNE !!!"
,HOODLUMpirate,2007-11-07T23:26Z,"Axxo finely got smart with his uploads. I have been telling who ever he is to move his uploads all to his own site, that way we can access his movies and such all at one site with out having to hunt them dow. I think its an excellent idea just go to the link on the above post, there you can find all of  Axxo's movies."
,Hei_på-deg,2007-11-08T01:27Z,"Alleged MPAA Harrassment Causes aXXo / Pirate Bay Rift:
http://torrentfreak.com/axxo-pirate-bay-rift-071107/

There's many other and better release groups than axxo, so it probably won't affect this site.

I personally download DVDR movies and 720p series, so axxo-torrents is way to low quality for me."
,randomguy12,2007-11-08T03:51Z,"where is the real axxo?? 

I really appreciated his small file sizes and great quality."
,danjmarsden,2007-11-08T11:31Z,Where is the sound???
,Bosskelso,2007-11-08T15:14Z,"This movie is soooooo funny!!!
its kinda retarded movie, but its so bad so u cant hold your self from not lol."
,sdsunjay,2007-11-08T23:25Z,idiot! axxo left cuz the mpaa harassed him and then the fucking pirate bay wudnt do anything. the riaa and the mpaa and shit. go die. 
,swollen-nose,2007-11-09T00:54Z,if you want aXXO - come to www.darksiderg.com
,dont_belive_the_hype,2007-11-09T05:57Z,"you stupid people wrighting about axxo this axxo that oh no have a fucking cry!
understand that in the end you are all getting these movies.games.porn,pics and more all for free! there is a saying that you don't know what you have till its gone so be very happy that axxo is bringing these movies...sooo...SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACES YOU GEEKS!!!!!!! p.s axxo you rock"

please help me. thanks"
,J33SEJ,2007-11-11T09:32Z,i can answer that one! you have to pay once for it though and it cost me about 23 english pounds but works perfect every time! its called 1clickdvd and when you buy it it tells you to unofficially download another item (which is totally free) that works in conjunction with it! it puts a little smiley face on your tool bar and when you put a dvd with macrovision in the smile goes from normal to a menacing grin with red horns then to green telling you the macrovision has been removed!!! good look hope that helps!
,DolphWulff,2007-11-11T10:36Z,"euge, go to http://www.doom9.net
