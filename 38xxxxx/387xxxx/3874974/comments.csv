,nautika,2007-12-04T23:50Z,i've been stuck at 96.4 percent for over a week.. is this torrent dead? can someone seed the end of it..
,marksowd,2007-12-07T13:59Z,"I still have it so I will re-seed.  No good though because it needs a password.  I've been hanging onto it for the last month hoping vegetazero0 would give us the password, but so far nothing !!"
,Pimpernell001,2008-02-21T07:26Z,"I'm currently using a program to try and retrieve the password. It might take days, or even a couple weeks, but I will post it as soon as I have it. 
If anyone already has it though, please save us the trouble!"
