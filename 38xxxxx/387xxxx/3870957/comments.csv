,Lanfear,2007-11-03T14:34Z,"Great upload Kerr0r, but why are all your uploads without seeders and leechers? Four uploads, all zeros. I'm trying to dl this one, but it doesn't work. Maybe you are doing something wrong at your end? Please make sure one upload is working before considering upping another one."
,Kerr0r,2007-11-03T18:43Z,"I've been wondering about this myself. I'm seeding, port is forwarded and everything. I even tried with both Azureus and Transmission! I think I'll ask on suprbay and see if I can find a solution..."

Looks like other people have the same problem..."
,Kerr0r,2007-11-03T18:53Z,More poking around reveals what I thought: TPB is having trouble with their tracker. Let's just hope they fix it soon...
