'Amaranth' from Dark Passion Play and 'Reach' the Amaranth Demo song from the Amaranth album mixed together!

If you did not like Marco's version of Amaranth, listen to it together with Anette, it sounds great!

I've mixed both songs at 256-320 kbit vbr to 256 kbit. Reach is at 90% volume, because Marco sings a lot louder then Anette does, so you could not hear her clear. Reach is 0.107 Seconds capped, so both songs fit together. 

I've got this Idea from this youtube video:

Note: I did not make this video or mixed the song in this youtube video, the song I am seeding here is my own doing. I just borrowed the title this guy gave the song.
And please seed it when you are done, I only got 128kbit upstream.

So have fun with it!
