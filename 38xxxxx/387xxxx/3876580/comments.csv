After taking an age to download, I found that the 'flac' mentioned in the writeup is a file extension that I had never heard of. So after a search on Google to find a suitable file converter program and another trawl on PirateBay for it, I finally was able to play the files.
For me, it turned out a total waste of time as the quality of these tracks is abysmal. I should have been warned by the bit that said 'Recorded With:Olympus Digital Voice Recorder VN-1100PC, in the 4th Row in the audience'!! These machines are OK for voice but useless for concerts."
