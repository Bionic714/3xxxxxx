THERE IS NO NEED TO INSTALL DAEMONS TOOLS TO PLAY THE WITCHER TO GET AROUND THE TAGES PROTECTION SYSTEM.

The story goes like this I've played about a quarter of the way through The Witcher on an older computer using Daemon Tools Advanced and decided it was time to get a more powerful games system. 

The problem was my new computer (probably the OEM installed drivers) refuses to play with the latest DTA. My system hangs when it is installed (the STPD problem) and I can't even get to the desktop unless I uninstall DTA in safemode.

Woe me ...woe me I will never get to finish the Witcher. Damn, and it was good too. I tried everything to try and get DTA to work but to no avail (and I know my situation is not unique- just google Daemon tools+system hangs, among other problems). Soon the Witcher was becoming a distant memory...a happy memory.

That was until I updated my copy of UltraISO to ""UltraISO Premium Edition version 9.3.0.2600"". I know for a fact that my older 9.1 version could not play it in its one virtual drive (I think it was more designed for playing DVD.iso's than getting around games protections).

I was able to install The Witcher to my hard drive (load the .iso into the virtual drive and press the magnifying glass symbol by the side to autoplay The Witcher.iso). I then updated it to v1.2 patch and replaced the witcher.exe with a no-cd crack.  

I have no idea why it was able to work as UltraISO is not a dedicated games .iso emulator like DTA. BUT IT WORKS...DAMN IT...IT WORKS.

No more DTA for me. In contrast UltraISO is non-invasive on your system and I've had no incompatibility problems or issues with it at all.

NOTE: I'm not sure if Witcher.mdf format works with this program so play it safe and use a rip that is a Witcher.iso. I downloaded this copy of UltraISO with a serial no. You can get it anywhere on the web: most torrents. 

I won't divulge the exact site simply because there are some silly fuckers out there who think it's a great idea to start forum threads with good sites names posted all over it. Over exposing good non-torrent sites and getting them shut down in the process. 

Hail me for I am the new King...long live the KING...long live the King!.

BTW I got my version of The Witcher from

(just for reference)

I will spam the other Witcher torrents here to spread the good news."
