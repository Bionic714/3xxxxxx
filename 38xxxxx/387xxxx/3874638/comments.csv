,oblachubs,2007-11-06T01:49Z,Wow thanks!  I hope the quality is good and I can convert with ConvertXtoDVD this time.  The last ones wouldn't let me because of some odd ball codec.  Is this complete or are episodes missing?  I'm not complaining just asking ;)
,oblachubs,2007-11-09T04:35Z,Can you guys please seed? This download rate is slow slow.  Thanks.
,svargrond,2007-11-09T23:39Z,seed :(
,oblachubs,2007-11-12T06:12Z,holyservant any chance you can speed up the seed process?  Nobody has more than 15% of it at this point.  How about throwing us a bone guy?  Thanks for what you can do here.  
,KrisReilly,2007-11-14T19:14Z,Seed please? 2w and left -.-
,oblachubs,2007-11-17T00:13Z,holyservant why did you even bother if you didn't intend on seeding it?  25% is only a few ep.  Please seed to completion so we can return the favor.
,emnog,2007-11-19T03:36Z,We need seeds! Can anybody please seed this one?
,lundberg_007,2007-11-23T02:13Z,"snälla, kan ni snälla seeda, ligger på max 10kb/s...

,adriansignell,2007-11-25T12:52Z,SEED!!!!!
,oblachubs,2007-11-27T05:47Z,You assh___s don't understand.  This torrent is so large he has not even seeded it once.  Be F'en patient.  He still jumps in from time to time and uploads which is more than you do you scags.  The more you make demands the less he seeds for us.  Get it?  No?  Then move to Pukesburg like the rest of the losers.
,oblachubs,2007-12-07T02:16Z,"Not that some of you deserve it, but it peeved me to see how many jackasses got 100% of this after waiting for weeks and didn't bother even seeding for 1 F'en day.  I'll help out for a couple days.  Come and get it while it's 100%.  "
,oblachubs,2007-12-11T05:07Z,No more seeds for you jackasses.  I have witnessed time and time again with this torrent people dropping off the face of the earch as soon as they reach 100%.  Very selfish of you!  I have warned you 3 times.  Your out.
,frauleinannika,2007-12-13T18:03Z,"As soon as I reach 100%, I'm seeding this for at least a month. Too many people complain about no seeds and if we all held on to something for a week or so, we'd all have what we want when we need it. "
,oblachubs,2007-12-17T05:53Z,frauleinannika I see what you are saying but the f'ers don't deserve it.  I have warned folks multiple times here.  Yet when they are done they put their clothes on and leave.  Sorry but I'm not pleased.
,seedingisthepoint,2007-12-19T00:42Z,"FYI: I've set up a dedicated server for this now. I'll let it stay up until january 20th, at least. At the moment, I'm no where near 100%, but I hope you guys stay generous for a while."

,HIyaalll,2008-01-24T20:40Z,"oblachubs.. I believe you are to swift to judge... I am not downloading this, nor will I, I decided that it was too big for me(Got a really slow and annoying connection), HOWEVER If I were to download, I _would_ kill the seed right after downloading it.. Simply because I'm Trying to seed OTHER things.. big things that I want to have as much bandwith as possible for just to make sure that I eventually reach 100%.... If I were to not download something just because of my inability to keep seeding it I would never be able to download anything at all(as I didn't download the stuff that I am seeding, I am the original provider)."
,Amicera,2008-01-30T03:41Z,"ok, so im downloading this now, and when it's finished, i'll continue to seed
my computer stays on 24/7, only restarting every now and again to cool down and refresh
i've been seeding family guy, south park, invader zim, xmen, and tons of discographies that ive downloaded since theyve been completed. its such a pain in the ass how selfish people wanna download and dip out.... SEED YOU MOTHERFUCKERS"
,paradigmc,2008-02-07T01:53Z,"What happened to the tracker?  Is it working for everyone else?  I've been slowly slowly downloading this for quite a while, my share ratio is even over 1!  I hope this didnt crap out, I've spent alot of time on this.  For some reason this is a very slow download.  Its not my connect either, because I get good speeds on other torrents.  Anyone know whats up?"

Nice upload though, good work :)"
,leodime,2008-03-30T12:26Z,This whole thing just isn't worth it. You'll all be waiting half a year for this thing to finish. My advice is to just download each season individually. Or download them all and then upload them to megaupload or something and post download links.
,danlew1,2008-04-04T12:27Z,Dont BOTHER PEOPLE!!! took me nearly a month to download and most of them didnt even fucking play. pill of SHIT!!!!!!!!!!
