,kimjooeul,2007-11-13T03:35Z,You must copy the sim2sp6.exe file in the crack folder to c:\Program Files\EA GAMES\The Sims 2 Teen Style Stuff\TSBin.
,amobe2xp,2007-11-13T22:03Z,"does anyone know where I can find the no-cd crack file to this game ? is there a internet-page or something, pleas tell!:)"

,amobe2xp,2007-11-13T23:19Z,"I found out there was no need for crack, since I had cracked the last game x) thax for the game, it worked 100% and it didn't take much time to download! ps, my english isn't so good, but I hope you understand me"
,ciab,2007-11-15T04:32Z,"This works, the only problem is that the langauge used in my game has change.  And I haven't a clue how to change it back to english-us.  

Can anyone help me with this?"
,ciab,2007-11-15T05:00Z,"Found the answer to my langauge problem.  Thought I'd share it here in case others were having a similar problem and didn't know what to do about it.

,devylzangyl,2007-11-15T16:36Z,"I'm confused. I already have the Sims 2 installed on the computer. Why would I have to install it again and then install this? Does this mean I have to uninstall?

Do I need to download a No CD crack to play this game or do I just use one of the serial numbers at the bottom?

Also what Crack directory? I don't see one. Am I supposed to make it?"
[M],Lollash,2007-11-23T15:18Z,Nice upload :)  Works flawless
,yellowcardcp,2007-11-24T05:47Z,"I'm having the same problem Kroox did...

When you say copy 'sim2sp6.exe' where is that in the crack? I tried to unrar all files, but it says they all contain the same thing and half won't unrar."
,devylzangyl,2007-12-13T09:17Z,"Do I have to add Bon Voyage to play this. Can I just add this after Seasons, or do I need the Seasons CD to play this after I add this SP?"
,metal_girl,2008-01-28T08:22Z,"can anyone tell me how to unrar it? pls? maybe it is really stupid question, but i dont know how to..."

,mrsUSMC,2008-06-27T00:06Z,"so... I downloaded this game, and now when I try to play it says I need to put in the Sims 2 Pets CD, I don't have the CD becuase I downloaded that too. But I've never needed the CD until now. Can anyone tell me what to do now? :/"
,lilithvixen,2008-06-28T02:09Z,"HELP Please! So I followed the instructions got the game to boot up but then it pops up a blank error message then the Sims shuts off. I also get the wrong disc inserted message other times. 

I think its because I cant paste in the crack file for some reason it tells me the file has no more memory so I cant paste it. Ive tried deleting the file that gets replaced first but it wont let me delete it, any suggestions.What am I doing wrong???"
,lilithvixen,2008-06-28T02:17Z,"OOPS sorry nevermind, figured it out!! Apparently I was pasting it in the documents  section instead of the program files section."
,sh_kyra,2009-05-29T20:20Z,Where is the crack directory?
,sh_kyra,2009-05-29T20:30Z,"Oh! I see!

Okai, for those who dont know...

Once you have downloaded and installed the game, Get to the ISO file, (or the image, in this case, the CUE file) and right click, open with, WinRAR, then once it comes up, open ""Crack"" And extract the file called ""Sims2EP8.exe"" (i think its "".exe"" . . . ).

Copy / cut this file in to .. by default..

c:\\program files\EA games\ Sims 2 teen style stuff\ TSBin

Replace the current file of the same name..."
,gabbybryant,2009-07-10T19:49Z,"i need help. ive downloaded two torrents that work fine. but i open this one and its a bin file and i file that opens with my roxio. i have no idea wat to do cuz its not like the others. can sumone plz help me, im new at this."

,TProdigy,2010-12-31T14:16Z,"FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET THIS TO WORK:

After installation of Sims 2, extract the file contents to ANY location. THEN, mount the .cue file in Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120% (52% works too)
THEN, go to ""My Computer"" and double click on the virtual drive. From there, select your language, then enter one of the keys in the description, and install.

Hope I helped!!"
