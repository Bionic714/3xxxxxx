PHOTO-REALISTIC OR SURREALISTIC RESULTS
Mystical Lighting allows you to use light and shading in either a photo-realistic manner or as a visual effect for surrealistic results.

In the Sky Fairy example to the left Mystical Lighting effects were used to generate the mist, rainbows, fairy dust, streaming light, highlights and shading in this scene.

Mystical Lighting SmartLayers (tm) allow you to combine different effects together in the same work session. 
Light and shading blend and interact with each other to generate incredible results.

shading with infinite degrees of control over opacity, tonal range, size and blending.
