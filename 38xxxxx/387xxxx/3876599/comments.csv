,iasthai,2008-07-17T00:08Z,"I just installed the program and began using it in Ps CS3 and my anti-virus, Avira Antivir, detected the following backdoor server virus: BDS/Graybird.dz. This type of virus allows the owner of the virus to remotely access and control your computer. Could be a false positive detection, but I'm deleting just in case."

Maybe someone should change the title of the torrent cos its hard to find if you are searching for Mystical Lighting."
