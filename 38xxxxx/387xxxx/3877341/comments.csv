,neosonic2k,2008-03-27T21:40Z,"I can confirm that this works with a Sony laptop with a previous Vista Business installation.

My hard drive in my FE890 croaked so I got a new shiny, faster 320GB WD. :D But, I didn't make recovery dvds for  the preinstalled Vista, so I was forced to install XP. Driver hell ensued, but I got it working in a week.

I read that Vista SP1 ""fixes"" performance issues. Being the pc breaker that I am (lol), I wanted Vista back, but Sony was being quite the bastard for the recovery dvds. So I saw this torrent, and d/led it. (had to d/l magiciso 5.4 from this website as well in order to burn the damn uif image). Used MagicISO to burn the image to a DVD (burned 2x speed on a CompUSA DVD-R medium). Backed everything up and booted off the dvd. I selected the Sony installation (weird, it said simplified chinese instead of english). I erased the whole HD, then installed. System rebooted like 3 or 5 times after installing. lol. The system was activated, and it is genuine. I managed to update completely via Windows Update.

I d/led the standalone SP1. It didn't want to install at first because it complained about having an unsupported language. I remembered the installation quirk where it said simplified chinese, so I checked and saw that both english AND chinese languages were installed. It was just a matter of removing the chinese pack (control panel-> regional and language options->keyboards and languages->install/remove languages) and voila, SP1 installed. Took an hour.

Windows is still genuine, still activated, and everything is running smoothly. So far, I HAVE noticed a considerable performance boost when opening menus or windows.

Now to reverse-integrate it! :D ...whatever that is."
,doofus88,2008-03-29T22:28Z,"LOL! I put  XP on my computer after nuking off Vista thinking I could back door into Vista recovery but didn't know I couldn't dual boot XP & Vista!  Ran into driver hell myself. Would not recognize my DVD drive and would not let me connect to the internet so I could download new drivers!  So this really did save my but!
P.S. Sorry about the double post-spastic finger!"
,moal,2008-04-05T04:10Z,"I am a bit curious, if I have a normal desktop. Can I just then install the nr 2? Or do I have to install nr 12, as that is my motherboard manufachter?

Anyway, nice upload, I will seed for a while!"
,sazismail,2008-04-05T16:18Z,"I have used this on my sony laptop, after stupidly deleting my recovery partition that had vista installed. I had vista basic though, and this version worked with no problems. I had all my drivers too, which is rare as sony laptops are known to have driver issues with vista. 
Also, to check for genuine status of this, i downloaded and installed every single update through windows update. This vista is still working fine, and still activated.
Around an hour ago, i ran the SP1 Update through windows update, and this ran smoothly and vista is still activated with no problems at all.

This is certainly the best format of vista i have come across, and for those of you with XP looking to upgrade, you should find no problems at all with this.

The only main problem i came across with this was the file format itself, but using magiciso, as mentioned earlier, you can burn through magic iso, however i found it easier to just open up the file in magiciso, then drag the files onto your desktop, and burn onto dvd using nero or something similar.

When they say ""Clean Install"" they mean that the Hard Drive is CLEANED(Formatted), you lose all information on the Hard Drive.

As to the compatibility of your computer...go to website of the maker of your M/B and they shall be able to tell you if it is compatible."
