,DoomedAl,2007-11-21T14:07Z,"Well, just a temp downtime at appzpoint.net

New forumsoftware installed, you might need to get an new pw, if you are a registered user.

And RON is still there :)"
,spikeburton,2007-11-21T14:36Z,"@ anyone who is having trouble logging in at Appzpoint:

They moved to different board software, and the member passwords were not able to be migrated. You have to clear your cookies and go there. Then you will see a link to reset your password. Follow the directions, and you should be back in and catching up on the LastXP news!


And, not to knock version 17.1.1 - because I haven't tried it yet - but version 16.2.3 is uploaded here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3820163/LastXP__v16.2.3_DVD-ISO

I've been running that version on a PC since September.  It's been nothing short of a dream!       I even redownloaded my own upload and made a new DVD and reinstalled LastXP from that DVD, so I know it works!  So, if you are having troubles with this version and you want a ""sure thing"", you might want to try that version. 


- Spikey"

Works much better, and isn't bloated :p"
,crawlgsx,2008-01-16T15:35Z,"Jon you are an a$$h@t. We don't care about ultimate, LastXP is far better. I have been using LastXP since version 14 so far, and I have yet to be dissapointed. "
