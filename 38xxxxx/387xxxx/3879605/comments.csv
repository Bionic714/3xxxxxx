http://imdb.com/title/tt0790706/
A nice surprise!"

It can be both true and false. I'm afraid these figures have got nothing to do with reality recently. That's too bad.

Thank you so much for your numerous uploads!
Some very interesting and rare movies. Just give us a break after your 100th torrent:)"
[T],oddeven,2007-11-10T02:39Z,"Well, I am trying to seed as much as possible.  I haven't gotten rid of any of the files yet, but I will sometime soon.  They are taking up a lot of space.  I can see a bunch of seeders on some (not here on the bay, but on my client).  Some of my uploads are getting a lot of leechers, then I see 50 seeders, then suddenly none.  I try to trickle some to the ones that have no seeders, but I won't do that forever.  Maybe a month, tops.  I'm new at this, so I'm trying to figure out a routine."
,titestef,2007-11-11T23:23Z,"hey oddeven ! your answer is welcome! thanks!
I appreciate that, and in my opinion , you're the ""CRITERION"" Seeder ! the best one
Big kisses
(and continue to seed as soon as you can)"
,titestef,2007-11-11T23:34Z,"hum... do you have ""LA MAMAN ET LA PUTAIN"" (THE MOMMY AND THE WHORE) on japanese dvd ?
thanks
stef"
[T],oddeven,2007-11-12T05:34Z,"""Criterion"", eh? I'll take that as a compliment, but I hope I'm not overpriced.
About ""LA MAMAN ET LA PUTAIN"",  I only have a copy I made from a download - 215 minutes, and I haven't watched it yet.  Watch out for searching out elusive Japanese extra minutes - I see on IMDB that there are 220 minutes on the Japanese version.  Any nudity will be obscured in various ways.  I also would doubt if it had any subtitles other Japanese. So, if you are looking to watch it with a Japanese friend, that might be the only reason to look for it."
,mistyblue,2008-07-17T14:51Z,"Thankyou for the upload...

Can anyone plz upload a less than 1GB version."
,-roAch-,2008-07-23T16:18Z,"@oddeven:

could you please reseed GOD'S COUNTRY??
that would just make my day!
i have been desperate for that movie for a while,
it's hard to come by: can't even find it on the eMule network...

I would really appreciate your effort!
