The other great Charles Bukowski Film.

This time, set in 1950s Flanders.  

Based on "The copulating Mermaid of Venice, CA" (as is Lune Froide, which I have also upped here) for the third part, and supposedly some writings by John Fante in the first, I think this covers Bukowski the way we have seen him in quite a few of his books, so don't look at it as a direct interpretation of any one book.

A good antidote to some other disastrous and unnamed contributions to Bukowski on screen.

I saw this back when it first hit the screen in 1987 in the U.S., under the name of "Love is a Dog From Hell", a few years after I had devoured all I could find of Bukowski in print.  It would be a few years until I saw "Lune Froide" in 1992, that anyone would be able to do justice to his work again.  There's plenty more material where that came from.

Enjoy!
