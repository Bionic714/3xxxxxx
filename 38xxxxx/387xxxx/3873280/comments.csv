,DJPROTOJ,2007-11-05T04:34Z,also after this is fully seeded i plan to put on the 3.7 gig straight captured video in hopes someone more experienced could make a nice 700 meg .avi 
,DJPROTOJ,2007-11-06T03:59Z,please seed it after you download it my group is seeding to alot of people who arent returning the favorof this pre release
,Drivont,2007-12-12T17:08Z,Quality is very sub-par.  Seems to be taken from a VHS recording.  Audio goes out of sync for most of the 2nd half.
,melon123,2008-02-01T19:38Z,seed if love the whooooooo
,TrshDept,2008-06-03T13:33Z,"A couple of things:
1. yes, I love The Who
2. seeding was good on this torrent
3. as 'Drivont' stated above, quality is not very good. Closer to a YouTube video. 
4. audio IS out of sync for most of the second half
--Thanks anyway for the upload DJPROTOJ. For those out there who really want to see this documentary regardless of the flaws it is watchable. I am also leeching the full DVD rip (also posted here on PB) of 8.8GB. I'm thinking of making a high quality DivX rip soon. Stay tuned and thanks again for the upload. I really appreciate your time. I just think downloaders should know about the quality of this torrent.  "
