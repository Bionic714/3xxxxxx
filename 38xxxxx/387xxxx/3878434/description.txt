The multiple award winning soundtrack from Michel Legrand to Robert Mulligan's touching 1971 drama Summer of '42.

Legrand's haunting soundtrack to Summer of '42 evokes all the bitter sweet memories of Hermie's summer of '42 - all the tender pain and joy of his impossible love. The music gives texture to memory and colour to tears. There's also a great groovy number on here too ("High I.Q.") and as you all know, we here at Movie Grooves love our groovy numbers.

The Summer of '42 soundtrack won the Oscar for "Best Music, Original Dramatic Score" in 1972 and also the BAFTA "Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music".
