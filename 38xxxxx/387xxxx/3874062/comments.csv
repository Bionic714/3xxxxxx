Not only does he dispense with the philosophical ideas which raised the original book above the level of titillating erotica to something of genuine interest, he adds in his own ridiculous moralistic tale and turns the 'woman of pleasure' into a common whore. Seemingly Davies was so busy reading with 'only one hand' (as Rousseau put it) that he failed to take in much of what was happening in the book, or the fact that it was written 260 years ago.

Rebecca Night is terrible in the role of Fanny.  I cannot see why anyone would fall under her charms.  If she has any, she deploys them with as much deft skill as she employs her acting abilities - which is to say, not at all. And WTF is that accent she affects so badly?

All in all, bad acting, poor direction and a lousy script. I wouldn't bother with it.

Good quality capture though. Thanks for upping."
