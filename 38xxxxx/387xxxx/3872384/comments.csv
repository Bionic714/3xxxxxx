If it's not I might be too butt-hurt to seed right away. In that case I'd have to get whatever I need to play it, and then seed it forever after I'm finished grumbling about it.

Seriously a fricking fantastic movie."
,YabberDabberDoop,2008-02-27T03:04Z,"By the way, does anyone know how I can make big ""/N""s stop appearing in the subtitles?"
,barton_fink,2008-12-01T15:53Z,"To get rid of the /N problem download txtpad from 
http://www.textpad.com/download/
browse to folder and select see ""all files""
use replace function F8 and replace /N with space
works fine 
thx for the movie"
,uldis375,2009-03-29T21:57Z,"good film for good film lovers. good quality. the big N was of some nuisance, but I followed instructions of MR Barton Fink and got rid of it. Big, big thanks to the uploader!"
,palefire78,2009-08-04T01:06Z,"A totally gripping and powerful film, thanks for the upload. 

Annoying about those subtitles of course - I followed Barton Fink's instructions as well to fix that \N thing, which was surprisingly easy. People might also want to do the same thing to get rid of those capital P's. Although I was wondering - does altering the file like this prevent you from seeding?"
,feraledge,2010-08-19T01:14Z,"watching with VLC, i cant see this problem with the subtitles people are talking about. they seem fine."
