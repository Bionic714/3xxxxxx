,Mangachaos,2010-06-09T07:42Z,"Thanks for uploading this one. I´m an old Tintin fan and well, I even was a member of the bookclub that distrubuted the books. Still, that was on swedish and I´d always wanted to see the show on english. 

As for the leachers... well, you guys can´t go any faster unless you doon´t have a great connection... so stop whining and get one! I myself have a high-end comp with a great connection. Ah... it feels good to be able to ""ride the waves"" of the net. =) I´ll seed some of course but don´t WHINE alright?"
,krita23,2010-06-09T09:32Z,"(@Mangachaos) I was a fan of his, too... My brother and mom almost searching along the town only to find the dvd was old and badly damaged!! Too bad, but I was glad I found this...

(@b33znutz) Thanks a lot for uploading this...

(@sedders) Thanks! keep up the good work, 'cause I'll seed some, too

English Subtitles http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3135831/the-adventures-of-tintin-en 
If you want it in another language do use Google translator. I had to re sync these srt files. You can do the same thing by using http://subshifter.comli.eu/ There are plenty of online re sync sites"

,corrimalau,2011-08-09T09:31Z,"These are not complete stories! the size of ""The Blue Lotus"" (complete) is 779 MB, while this version is only 367 MB ...

It looks like there has been a lot of editing on some of these and the beginnings of the films are missing.
Also the quality of the video is very fuzzy.

Good for something, I suppose"
,timTech,2011-10-30T06:39Z,"This is only 21 of the 39 episodes (in no particular order). see here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin_%28TV_series%29#Episodes for details

good quality - but I wish the remaining 18 episodes were included."
,timTech,2011-10-30T06:44Z,"**UPDATE**

I goofed - all the 2 part episodes have been combined into 45minute episodes. This is in fact the complete series (it's just out of order).

thanks b33znutz this is awesome!"
,timTech,2011-10-30T11:14Z,"**UPDATE#2**

All episodes are listed in production order, not order or broadcast."
