Totally awesome concert from the Revolution era 1982-1986, Prince & The Revolution at their best.  I have this release on Laser disc and it should be released on DVD for the simple fact that this concert is one of the best concert films of the 80\'s.  Totally captures the magic of Prince\' stage show and musical brilliance.  All songs are excellent but the closing track, Purple Rain is most exciting, clocking in at just over 19 minutes.

Songs include - Let\'s Go Crazy, Delirious, 1999, Little Red Corvette, Take Me With U, Do Me Baby, Possessed, How Come U Don\'t Call Me Anymore, Let\'s Pretend We\'re Married, God, Computer Blue, Darling Nikki, The Beautiful Ones, When Doves Cry, I Would Die 4 U, Baby I\'m A Star and Purple Rain. - Running Time 117 minutes
