but it didn't work! How do I make it work?"
,Kev3704,2007-11-06T16:13Z,"These are standard mp3 files.  I have this collection on CD and ipod with no problems.  Remember that due to the length of this concert, it will have to be burned to more than 1 disc.  Also be sure to check your burn settings."
,MrMoony,2007-11-08T13:28Z,"Hi Kev! I tried again but it says; either the files are corrupt or it's not a true MPEG 3 Layer. Very strange! First time that I couldn't burn to CD! No
worries: Got great speakers + sound on my PC.
Anyway:Thanxx for a great show!"
