,Libertius,2007-11-08T07:41Z,"To get the cracks/patches working on leopard (same procedure on both patches):

Copy the patch from the .dmg to your harddrive so they can be modified

Download the latest iPatch (3.7.1) from ipatch.org

Rightclick on patch, choose ""Show package contents"", locate the file ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (208 K)

In that folder are two folders called updat 1 and 2. IN update 1 there is an installer, but when I type in my name and password it says wrong password.... I used the right password... believe me :p Ive been trying to enter it for a long time now.

am I doing something wrong?"

to those who are getting an error message when trying to apply patch, it seems that the patcher might have a problem setting permissions correctly. Try ""Show Package Contents"" on the Civilization executable and setting permissions to Read & Write for all enclosed items. that worked for me, after getting an error message.

I did change permissions on the Civilization IV install folder using the Info pane making sure to ""Apply to enclosed items"". I am not sure if it had any impact.

Here is the complete list of things I did:
1. Mount CIV.iv.cdr and drag CIV4 folder to harddisk.
2. Unpack CIV IV updates.zip
3. Right click CIV IV updates/Update 1/Civilization IV Installer and choose 'Show Package Contents'
  3a. Drag Contents/Resources/Civ4.pkg to desktop and run it.

  4a.Right click Civilization IV Installer and choose 'Show Package Contents'
  4b. Drag Contents/Resources/Civ4.pkg to desktop and run it.

Civilization 4 is now fully patched and we move onto installing Warlords:

5. Mount Civilization IV Warlords.dmg and run installer
  5a. Mount Civ4.Warlords.Crack.dmg and drag Civilization IV Warlords UBCrack to your Civ4 install folder and run it. Remember to 'Select Civilization_App' to make sure it patches the right file.

2) right click the ""Civilization IV"" file or ""Civilization IV Warlords"" inside Warlords folder and get info.
3) Make sure you have read and write permissions, even you have only one account and you are admin do not mean that you should have that permission right.
4) try to apply the patch, you may still possible to get error messages, look at the error message that is showing the path of location that fail, use show package method to select that exact location and change the permission.
5) after you change all permission, the patch should successfully apply!!!

,itsahotdog,2007-12-20T15:05Z,"yep, figured it out no problem after about a week....first do what liberitus does to tell ya before ya do anything else....go ahead and install the files, stopping at whatever version you want to run the game with.  then run the crack...make sure you are running the correct crack version (check your civ app info to make sure the correct version of the app coincides with your crack version [and if you have any problems opening the crack make sure to open it usin rosetta {found in the info panel}]).  

now it's really all about your read write permissions.  that's the one glitch most people seem to be having.  as lazlazlaz stated, you MUST enable read write for everyone for each file (can't just do it for the folder).  so when ou get that error when you're patching giving you the lists previously stated in this post, follow those paths to the correct files.  yes, do them one by one.  get info on the file, change permissions and set each one to read and write and presto!

if you keep getting errors follow the path that the error tells you to.

You must install it first (and only) if you want to use it, and there is no installer trick. Can be installed from diskimage. You must however change game permission as described.

If you shall install warlords. Just install from disk image. Change the iPacher file in the warlords crack as described. Change permission for Civilization IV Warlords.app/Contents/MacOS
Civilization IV Warlords.app/Contents/Info.plist

,Solistus,2008-01-17T00:14Z,"This torrent DOES work with Leopard, with just a few minutes of work required to get the no dvd crack working properly.  Yes, Warlords works too!

Big thanks to polyglot and libertius.  I almost skipped this one based on peoples' troubles with installing on Leopard, but combining their advice worked perfectly.  I wrote up my own version of Leopard install instructions, drawing heavily on these two and their excellent advice.  I hope this clears things up a bit for people.  Without further ado, my step-by-step guide:

Installing Civ IV + Warlords on Leopard:

1. Mount CIV.iv.cdr and drag the Civ IV folder to Applications (or wherever) to install.

2. Unzip CIV IV updates.zip.

3. Right click CIV IV updates/Update 1/Civilization IV Installer and choose 'Show Package Contents.'  This will open a new Finder window for the package contents.

4. In this new window, go to Contents/Resources/ and find Civ4.pkg.  Drag it to the desktop (or anywhere else that you'd prefer) and run it.

5. Mount Civ IV updates/Update 2/ Civilization_IV_1-2.61.dmg and drag Civilization IV Installer to the desktop.

6. Show package contents on the Civilization IV Installer (see step 3 if you don't know how).

7. Drag Contents/Resources/Civ4.pkg to the desktop and run it.  It's fine if you overwrite the old Civ4.pkg; we're done with it.

8. Mount Civilization IV Warlords.dmg and run the installer.

9. Mount Civ4.Warlords.Crack.dmg and drag Civilization IV Warlords UBCrack to your Civilization IV folder.

10. Download the latest iPatcher from www.ipatch.org (3.7.1?).  It comes on a .dmg; mount it and copy the app to the desktop to install it.

11. Show package contents for both UBCrack and iPatcher.  Make sure to keep these package content windows straight!  If you forget which is which, you can use the back button on the Finder window to figure it out.

12. Find the file ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" in the UBCrack package contents (it should be 208kb).  This is the 'problem' file that doesn't work in Leopard.  We're about to replace it with the newest version, which does work in Leopard

13. Find the file ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" in iPatcher's package contents.  Show package contents again for this file (should be 448 K).  You can close the original iPatcher package contents if you want to avoid confusion.

14. In this new package contents window, find ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (should be 212 K).  Drag it over to the crack's package contents to overwrite the outdated 208 K version.

15.  Get Info on the Civilization IV directory.  Open the bottom tab (Sharing & Permissions).  You should have to click the lock in the bottom right and enter your system password to be able to change these.  Once you've done this, change the Privilege entry for each group to Read & Write.  Then, click the icon that looks like a gear (left of the lock icon) and choose ""Apply to enclosed items.""  This should resolve any permissions issues.

16. Run the UBCrack.  Make sure that you select the right app (it's in Civilization IV/Warlords).  If you get an error message about permissions, it should tell you the files it's having trouble with.  Find these files in the Finder (they may be within the package contents for another file) and repeat step 15 for each one.

17. Enjoy!  If you've done everything correctly and didn't run into some problem that I didn't have, you should be able to play Warlords without a disc now.  If you do have problems, even if you manage to solve them, please post a comment here so that others can benefit from your knowledge or help you solve the problem."
,spideru,2008-01-18T00:02Z,It worked perfectly. I'll try to do that again and then seed the cracks working. Many didn't explain the problem correctly and I didn't manage to succed but now it's really ok. Thank you Solistus.
,TheAmazingRando,2008-01-18T04:28Z,"I'm using dusty old OSX3.9 and every time I try to run either of these cracks on the appropriate application file, it tells me ""You can't apply the Patch on this file!"", with no further explanation of any kind.  Wtf mates?"

I reasoned that the Warlords update had messed up the copy-protection circumvention from the update 2 crack, so I decided to run the update 2 crack again and it worked!

,gregthesquare,2008-02-03T19:30Z,"Hi, I've downloaded it okay, but when I try to copy the civ IV folder from the CDR, i get a ""the alias .BC.ho3sWN cannot be copied to the destination, perhaps becuase the destination does not support this type of alias"".  This occurs no matter where I move it.  I have verified and repaired all my permissions and made sure the destination is unlocked.

After copying all the folders individually, I have discovered that this alias is in the Civ IV application.  I looked up the problem, and found a way around it through stuffing the file from the mounted image onto my HD, then unstuffing it.  This allowed me to move it to the appropriate folder.  However, when I try to install the first patch, it says my copy of CIV IV has been installed incorrectly and that I should reinstall.

Thoughts?   Thanks for any help people may be able to offer.

,[[[[djinn]]]],2008-03-12T20:10Z,"USE THIS IF YOUR ARE RUNNING LEOPARD, TIGER SOULD BE OK....if tiger is having the same admin privileges goto step 14.

Here is how you fix patches that are version 3.7!!!!! I found this instructions on the web under doom 3, but it worked for The Sims 2 and Civ IV. It worked for all the ipatches for leopard so far. 


1) Download the latest iPatch (3.7.1) from ipatch.org, macupdate, or where ever...

2) Mount iPatch.dmg, copy the ipatch app to your desktop.

3) rightclick iPatch app, choose ""Show package contents""

4) Locate ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" (448 kb), rightclick it and choose ""Show 
    package contents""

5) Locate ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (212 kb)

6) Drag-drop onto desktop - iPatcher (212 kb)

7) Now Mount the ""ipatch NODVD crack"" or any ipatch that is v.3.7.

8) Copy the ipatch v.3.7 file to desktop

9) Right click -> Show package contents

10) Go from Contents > MacOS you have found the old ipatcher file (208kb)

11) Replace the ipatcher file (208k) with the ipatcher file (212k) from your desktop
     close all windows.

12) right-click the modified ipatch v.3.7, and make sure the ""run in rosetta"" is   
     unchecked.

13) run ipatch and enjoy!


THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!!!

14) If you are running into problems (you will in sim 2 and civ IV, you must download this to    
     work!) with admin privileges download Pseudo 1.2.3 at
http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/9608

or any where you can find it. 

Drag-Drop the modified ipatch v.3.7 onto Pseudo(these are the cracks). Pseudo will ask for you password

Press OK and the modified ipatch will self-open.

FYI- The reason we are going thru these steps because the ipatch is v3.7 and is not leopard ready and will require privileges that rosetta will not allow!


HINT: if you make a copy of the pulled ipatcher (212 kb). You will always have a quick fix for this problem...

Thanks Blade and villiagejoker and everyone I forgot for this workaround!

This is normally caused by using a case sensitive file system.  Most games are just ports of the Windows version and fall over on a decent file system.  The game makes a call to Python but does not get the case right in the call, in windows there is no problem but if you have formatted your file system in the case sensitive version the call cannot be recognised.  

There is an error with Warlords where it cannot get the XML file for the same reason.  The only anser is to re-install Leopard with the standard file system."

,Andyr005,2008-04-20T21:05Z,"This is a repost that works for leopard. Steps 10-16 work for any problem on the CIV package set as well. Make sure You copy and not drag though.
This torrent DOES work with Leopard, with just a few minutes of work required to get the no dvd crack working properly. Yes, Warlords works too!

Big thanks to polyglot and libertius. I almost skipped this one based on peoples' troubles with installing on Leopard, but combining their advice worked perfectly. I wrote up my own version of Leopard install instructions, drawing heavily on these two and their excellent advice. I hope this clears things up a bit for people. Without further ado, my step-by-step guide:

Installing Civ IV + Warlords on Leopard:

1. Mount CIV.iv.cdr and drag the Civ IV folder to Applications (or wherever) to install.

2. Unzip CIV IV updates.zip.

3. Right click CIV IV updates/Update 1/Civilization IV Installer and choose 'Show Package Contents.' This will open a new Finder window for the package contents.

4. In this new window, go to Contents/Resources/ and find Civ4.pkg. Drag it to the desktop (or anywhere else that you'd prefer) and run it.

5. Mount Civ IV updates/Update 2/ Civilization_IV_1-2.61.dmg and drag Civilization IV Installer to the desktop.

6. Show package contents on the Civilization IV Installer (see step 3 if you don't know how).

7. Drag Contents/Resources/Civ4.pkg to the desktop and run it. It's fine if you overwrite the old Civ4.pkg; we're done with it.

8. Mount Civilization IV Warlords.dmg and run the installer.

9. Mount Civ4.Warlords.Crack.dmg and drag Civilization IV Warlords UBCrack to your Civilization IV folder.

10. Download the latest iPatcher from www.ipatch.org (3.7.1?). It comes on a .dmg; mount it and copy the app to the desktop to install it.

11. Show package contents for both UBCrack and iPatcher. Make sure to keep these package content windows straight! If you forget which is which, you can use the back button on the Finder window to figure it out.

12. Find the file ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" in the UBCrack package contents (it should be 208kb). This is the 'problem' file that doesn't work in Leopard. We're about to replace it with the newest version, which does work in Leopard

13. Find the file ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" in iPatcher's package contents. Show package contents again for this file (should be 448 K). You can close the original iPatcher package contents if you want to avoid confusion.

14. In this new package contents window, find ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (should be 212 K). Drag it over to the crack's package contents to overwrite the outdated 208 K version.

15. Get Info on the Civilization IV directory. Open the bottom tab (Sharing & Permissions). You should have to click the lock in the bottom right and enter your system password to be able to change these. Once you've done this, change the Privilege entry for each group to Read & Write. Then, click the icon that looks like a gear (left of the lock icon) and choose ""Apply to enclosed items."" This should resolve any permissions issues.

16. Run the UBCrack. Make sure that you select the right app (it's in Civilization IV/Warlords). If you get an error message about permissions, it should tell you the files it's having trouble with. Find these files in the Finder (they may be within the package contents for another file) and repeat step 15 for each one.

17. Enjoy! If you've done everything correctly and didn't run into some problem that I didn't have, you should be able to play Warlords without a disc now. If you do have problems, even if you manage to solve them, please post a comment here so that others can benefit from your knowledge or help you solve the problem."

These are applications that ""patch"" the existing executable files. So in order that these ""patches"" can work, you need to give them permission to fuck around:
-right click on the civ4 executable and choose show package contents
-right click on contents and choose get info
-at the bottom of the panel should be a lock. click the lock, type in the password, and then change all of the options to read and write

Now, the patches themselves need to be edited to properly execute. We need to update their iPatcher to fix them. To fix the crack patchers so they work on Leopard (same procedure on both patches):

1. Download the latest iPatch from ipatch.org.
2. Mount the downloaded iPatch dmg, right-click the iPatch app, choose ""SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS"".
3. Locate ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" (448 K), right-click it and choose ""SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS"".
4. Locate ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (212 K).
5. COPY it.

6. Copy the patches from the .dmg to your harddrive so they can be modified. I keep them with the executables they are going to patch.
7. Right-click on a patch, choose ""Show package contents"", locate the file ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (208 K)
8. Replace (PASTE) the file from the iPatch download ""iPatcher"" (212 K) over the ""iPatcher"" (208 K) in the crack patch.
9. Launch the crack, it should not crash if you did it right (obviously).
10. Run the crack and drag the warlords game executable into the crack to patch it.
11. Run the game

,jrodas753,2008-09-21T11:00Z,"This is a repost of what worked for me. It took me FOREVER to do but you have to do EXACTLY what it says here...I know it sucks but there is no other way around it. You gotta have alotta patience with this one cause its a BITCH!!!

REPOST:

Installing Civ IV + Warlords on Leopard:

1. Mount CIV.iv.cdr and drag the Civ IV folder to Applications (or wherever) to install.

2. Unzip CIV IV updates.zip.

3. Right click CIV IV updates/Update 1/Civilization IV Installer and choose 'Show Package Contents.' This will open a new Finder window for the package contents.

4. In this new window, go to Contents/Resources/ and find Civ4.pkg. Drag it to the desktop (or anywhere else that you'd prefer) and run it.

5. Mount Civ IV updates/Update 2/ Civilization_IV_1-2.61.dmg and drag Civilization IV Installer to the desktop.

6. Show package contents on the Civilization IV Installer (see step 3 if you don't know how).

7. Drag Contents/Resources/Civ4.pkg to the desktop and run it. It's fine if you overwrite the old Civ4.pkg; we're done with it.

8. Mount Civilization IV Warlords.dmg and run the installer.

9. Mount Civ4.Warlords.Crack.dmg and drag Civilization IV Warlords UBCrack to your Civilization IV folder.

10. Download the latest iPatcher from www.ipatch.org (3.7.1?). It comes on a .dmg; mount it and copy the app to the desktop to install it.

11. Show package contents for both UBCrack and iPatcher. Make sure to keep these package content windows straight! If you forget which is which, you can use the back button on the Finder window to figure it out.

12. Find the file ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" in the UBCrack package contents (it should be 208kb). This is the 'problem' file that doesn't work in Leopard. We're about to replace it with the newest version, which does work in Leopard

13. Find the file ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" in iPatcher's package contents. Show package contents again for this file (should be 448 K). You can close the original iPatcher package contents if you want to avoid confusion.

14. In this new package contents window, find ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (should be 212 K). Drag it over to the crack's package contents to overwrite the outdated 208 K version.

15. Get Info on the Civilization IV directory. Open the bottom tab (Sharing & Permissions). You should have to click the lock in the bottom right and enter your system password to be able to change these. Once you've done this, change the Privilege entry for each group to Read & Write. Then, click the icon that looks like a gear (left of the lock icon) and choose ""Apply to enclosed items."" This should resolve any permissions issues.

16. Run the UBCrack. Make sure that you select the right app (it's in Civilization IV/Warlords). If you get an error message about permissions, it should tell you the files it's having trouble with. Find these files in the Finder (they may be within the package contents for another file) and repeat step 15 for each one.

17. Enjoy! If you've done everything correctly and didn't run into some problem that I didn't have, you should be able to play Warlords without a disc now. If you do have problems, even if you manage to solve them, please post a comment here so that others can benefit from your knowledge or help you solve the problem."

You'll have to delete all the installed files, including the ones in your User directories.  Then restart, remount the images and install again.

Not sure if you really have to take all these steps (restart, etc.) but I wanted to be on the safe side.  When I did all of this, it worked again.  It has something to do with trying to reinstall it on the same drive without cleaning the original off.

Two things that might be confusing (since I'm a bit of a mac-idiot I comprehend this kind of confusion!)

Referring to point 15 of jrodas753 instructions on page 6. Change the permissions of the whole civilization IV folder. It's the folder you find under applications (~/applications/civilization IV). In fact, if you go to information (apple + I) you'll know that you're on the right track if in the information window it says Kind: Folder. And the rest is like jrodas753 explains.

the other hard part was changing the permissions (step 14-ish). when you run the patch (last step), it will ask if you want to change them. you can say yes, enter your passoword and THIS DOES NOT WORK.  you'll get an error, and you have to change the permissions for the files that it points out. tricky.

Original post by 
leechoid at 2008-09-15 23:56 CET:

To make things easier, a compiled list of how to make this work on Leopard:

After you mount the main game files, now what is left to do is to apply the updates and warlords patches. The cracks that are included with them arent the ones that are the drag, drop and replace. These are applications that ""patch"" the existing executable files. So in order that these ""patches"" can work, you need to give them permission to fuck around:

1. Right click on the civ4 warlords executable and choose SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS
2. Right click on CONTENTS and choose GET INTO
3. At the bottom of the panel should be a lock. click the lock, type in the password, and then change ALL of the options to READ AND WRITE
4. Then click the gear-like tool on the very bottom and choose apply to enclosed, then click OK in the confirmation dialog.

Now, the patches themselves need to be edited to properly execute. We need to update their iPatcher to fix them. To fix the crack patchers so they work on Leopard (same procedure on both patches):

1. Download the latest iPatch from ipatch.org.
2. Mount the downloaded iPatch dmg, right-click the iPatch app, choose ""SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS"".
3. Locate ""Contents/Resources/iPatcher"" (448 K), right-click it and choose ""SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS"".
4. Locate ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (212 K).
5. COPY it.

6. Copy the patches from the .dmg to your harddrive so they can be modified. I keep them with the executables they are going to patch.
7. Right-click on a patch, choose ""Show package contents"", locate the file ""Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"" (208 K)
8. Replace (PASTE) the file from the iPatch download ""iPatcher"" (212 K) over the ""iPatcher"" (208 K) in the crack patch.
9. Launch the crack, it should not crash if you did it right (obviously).
10. Run the crack and drag the warlords game executable into the crack to patch it.
11. Run the game"

I came here to rant about how useless the torrent was because it was full of un-working patches...but then I read the comments and znoop 07 (page 9) saved me.

Thanks for re-posting leechold's post.  It's 100% accurate for leopard users.  Worked perfectly, if quite time-consuming.

Basically, re-patch the patches.  Install Civ IV, install the first official patch, then use the Blade patch you just fixed, install the second official patch, and repeat with the matching Blade patch, then install Warlords, and repeat with the fixed Blade Warlord patch.  Perfect.

Thank you."
,vyassaran,2009-08-23T02:31Z,"I followed jrodas' steps and managed to get WARLORDS to work,
but how do i get CIV itself to work? as in, not this expansion game, but the regular version??
(as you can tell i'm new to this)"

,splatt_,2009-09-09T13:19Z,"I'm on Mac OS X 10.6

Should I be aware of anything else to do aside from the instructions listed in the comments?

Also, I saw that when I try copying iPatch (from the Website), it's around 601KB. "
,splatt_,2009-09-09T15:44Z,"PS

and the package contents of the latest iPatch (3.7.1) in the Contenst/MacOS/ folder, the filename is ""iPatch"" not ""iPatcher""

should i just rename it so that it replaces the :problematic: file?"
,aceofthesky,2009-09-14T11:32Z,"OK PEOPLE, for those who use OSX 10.5 and have NO IDEA HOW TO INSTALL, GO TO page 2 of the comments page, READ AND DO what ""Solistus"" wrote. 

A special thanks to Solistus works like a charm on my macbook"

I got a call from my ISP claiming that a company called them accusing me of downloading illegally and distributing a product ( CIV IV ), Copyright infringement. The thing is. . . did they find out about this because I seeded the game for too long? Or what? I'm kinda confused about what to do, do I delete the entire game from my computer or just remove from torrent program? Thanks! Great upload!"
,hotspur0,2009-10-08T01:54Z,"finally, thanks for the up! took a while had to update and replace ipatcher, then change permission settings for all the error codes, just as leechold, libertius, gameman 15 and jrodas753 have all mentioned in this thread! works perfectly after that.

I keep running into the same issues as others have had and I'm new to torrents. When I try installing the first part on the list, it says please try again. So please, could someone help me make this work?"

I couldn't seem to find it here but came across it over @ picktorrent dot com "
,cosmicbdog,2010-04-11T17:37Z,i think you need the current updated version to play with randoms online..
,jaycoyoyo,2010-10-21T05:46Z,Great torrent! I followed the instructions on page 6 written by jrodas753 and it worked perfectly! I am running Snow Leopard. Cheers kijulama!

,spaz92693,2012-02-13T23:42Z,Cannot install updates on Lion because you cannot open PowerPC programs.
,guyver145,2012-05-21T20:11Z,"Works fine Lion, really smooth on my macbook pro mid 2009, all you need is to copy the everything out to a folder, preferably applications, find a no-cd crack for 1.74, and voila."
