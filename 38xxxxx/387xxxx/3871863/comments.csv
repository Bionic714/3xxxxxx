,dushyantindian83,2007-11-12T09:27Z,i m not able to control the flow of rubbish data.i selected files of 1.36 gb and the rubbish data is already224mb. i have installed peerguardian 2 but still no help.does anybody have any suggestions?
,sucifer,2007-11-13T17:37Z,"winrar reports many files as corrupt, affecting several movies.  not sure if this is a result of the 12 hours i spent without peerguardian running or a more common problem.   

big pack to have to re-DL... ah well."
,sucifer,2007-11-14T04:22Z,"misery-r36

,skabbkuk,2007-11-25T03:33Z,"use winrar to repair the corrupted files, worked like a charm on the misery files 36 and 48, then just replace the original files with the fixed files"
,Ronin76,2007-11-27T19:05Z,"Thnks for the upload :)

Just to note Rose Red CD1 and CD2 are the wrong way around, start with CD2."

,lucserp,2008-04-01T09:21Z,"Rose Red CD1 and CD2 are the wrong way around, start with CD2!
Creepshow is slitely out of synch!
Misery archives 36 and 48 have errors which can be fixed with Winrar...but the movie is way out of sync!
How do we fix audio out of sync for those 2 movies?!"
,westlock420,2008-04-05T07:23Z,"its better to just go with the individual rips you get more seeds and no corrupt files

,SirPorkloin,2008-10-17T06:35Z,Nice up Malekay....Looks like a really good list.... I only pulled out Maximum Overdrive.... Very nice quality....V=9 (For 80's quality)....A=10.....Thanks to the seeders too....And yes I seeded it for 3 gigs and counting....:P
,truthy,2008-11-25T18:10Z,"first of all thanks for the effort/upload

as some people mentioned above some movies are slightly out of sync.

tommyknockers for example CD1 by +200 ms, CD2 ok. (can be corrected by using vdubmod --> audio interleaving --> audio skew corection --> new file)
vlc now also supports audio skew correction during playback (adv. options --> Synchronisation) but to fix this permanently use eg. vdubmod."
,truthy,2008-11-25T21:02Z,"mhm it seems CD2 of the tommyknockers is also out of sync (+200 ms too) but only after about half an hour.

fixing that is little bit more complicated ... you can convert the mp3 audio to a wav-file in vdubmod, open it in wavelab and add 200ms after about 30 minutes then convert it back to mp3 and add it in vdubmod and disable the old audio and save it a a new file.

IT and Needul Things are in sync btw.
thx again for sharing this very nice collection!"
,budthespud,2009-03-13T19:26Z,AMAZING THANK YOU SO MUCH!
,budthespud,2009-03-13T19:32Z,i usc VLC media player and it has menus where you can resync audio and subs and also change colour and sharpness and lots of other settings
,budthespud,2009-05-24T14:04Z,how do i watch these?
,Shellfire-Defense,2010-04-11T10:24Z,Creepshow is out of synchrony
,Shellfire-Defense,2010-04-11T20:57Z,"Creepshow is out of sync +200 too.

I solved it

With virtualdub, open the movie, go to audio>interleaving, add 200ms, go back to audio, and mark the option ""full processing mode"". Now go to video, and mark the option, ""direct stream copy"". Click on file>Save as AVI,
and wait the ending of process."
