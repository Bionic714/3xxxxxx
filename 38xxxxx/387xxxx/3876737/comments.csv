,Tronblue,2007-11-07T13:19Z,So how did TPB manage to piss of aXXo and have him pull all his rips from the past year?
,amyjames,2007-11-07T14:43Z,can someone please tell me how to get the sound please
,sourgrapes,2007-11-07T14:59Z,Thanks to moviebobo :) To get the sound just download vlc media player it is free and plays most files.
,Mahs,2007-11-07T15:03Z,"It's because of the attacks against aXXo.. If you saw the Axxole and axxo fight yesterday..
that's probably why aXXo did it.. So, I've got 100 movies added by aXXo, tell me a movie you want me to upload =)"
,Mahs,2007-11-07T15:39Z,"As is said. We don't know if aXXo pulled out of TPB! 
Maybe the admins Deleted all he's movies?
There is still alot of time, I think he's coming back..
I'll probably leave to..
Did you read the argue yesterday? 
this guy aXXole started to whine and was threatning to call the FBI and shit.. Dunno if that's the reason though.."
,zemins,2007-11-07T15:47Z,FFS Axxo puld back from TPB becouse he was sow pistoff of some peapol accusing him of ripoffs I HOPE THAY BURN IN HELL !!!! axxo was the only reason vor me to be at TPB 
,JoakimLj,2007-11-07T16:50Z,"Why have Axxo's name in your torrent, Remove it. Just have DvDrip.

But if you must have it, please write so we can see that this is you that have uploaded it. "
,dlux724,2007-11-07T16:54Z,axxo moved to mininova .... he left tpb because tpb doesnt protect against organized attacks. alot of pukka supporters did the attack and axxo had network problems. axxo asked for something to be done. the tpb admins did nothing so he deleted all his torrents. 
,HomerJ12345,2007-11-07T18:11Z,it aint axxo
,HomerJ12345,2007-11-07T18:27Z,were are the real aXXo???
,aMaR_,2007-11-07T18:47Z,moviebobo? who the hell are you?
,E___-._.-___3,2007-11-07T18:51Z,"Maybe it's appropriate to ask, under the circumstances, 'who the hell is anyone around here?'."
,Tronblue,2007-11-07T18:53Z,"This & other torrent boards are driven by ads and how many hits one gets per day avg. If they want people to visit this site for the ad dollars I'd imagine they could & should protect an asset to this board. aXXo is an asset to any torrent board, people trust his uploads and his name. 

The volume of traffic to this site will screech to a halt once aXXo starts releasing rips on other sites and leaving this one out. 

Wake up TPB. Protect uploaders & contributers from fakes/viruses & slander when possible. If you do nothing you invite or even condone these attacks.

Personally I will also be looking into Mininova for my future rips."

,igibuu,2007-11-07T22:37Z,"u guys dont get it, without axxo as the main upload of his rips there will be no certenty (assurance,confirmation,security) about what is fake and real at the releases, this will mean that thousands of people will download fakes now and get busted by the fuckers that made this happen....

gues how many people downloading the fakes that also will install the shitty programs that follow or get some virus or spyware...

even worse, if the virus/spyware actually tracks/traces/records the ip`s of all the other people downloadin the movies... there might not be any way of stopping it if it gets out of our hands rigth now!!!

Many thanks, for everything.  My hats off to you, and bottoms up.  I understand about frustration with silliness, so I don't fault you a bit.  Should you ever pass through Tennessee, in the US, you are more than entitled and welcome to the unlimited beverage of your choice.  Thanks once again, I hope you return to PB because it's one of the few sites that doesn't block US users (yet).

And axxo was one out of a few rippers out there. and yeah as hydro4life stated, he was always late. The scene is about getting the biggest titles out as fast as possible, not about mass uploading half good movies...

I liked axxo-releases, but his copies was just as good as any other dvdrips out there...

Now I'm a true tpb fan, and as long as tpb keep above water, I'll come here daily to see what new great stuff they have for me :D

We all love computers, but it was hard to manage, and only for the pros before microsoft came with windows..and suddenly everyone could use it, it wasn't optimal, but userfriendly...Same with axxo...everybody loved filesharing, but it was hard to trust wether it was good or bad quality, before axxo came and made 100% quality everytime..

This rip from aXXo is a HUGE improvement from previous 1CD rips of The Simpsons Movie. Thanks god aXXo will continue to release quality rips on mininova and other torrent sites. Since the SCENE releases can be found directly on moviex or rlslog, PirateGay will remain a second hand torrent site full of fakes, decoys from MPAA, AutoGK made rips by complete nOObs and re-ups of torrents published initially on sites that know how to treat uploaders that bring BIG traffic and BIG  money demanding NOTHING more than little RESPECT.

 how obvious is that? an axxo movie uploaded by moviebobo, the exact same movie axxo ripped. Not like moviebobo is claiming it as his own.

And your MPAA conspiracy theory - laughable. How could they use the SAME hash checksum? 

Or is axxo with the MPAA? All makes sense now. Entrapment of millions of downloaders around the world that have an axxo file on their PC. In fact it's all those downloaders around the world that are more likely to get caught out rather than the original uploader.

Every few months it seems the FBI manages to come up with yet more people to charge in connection with Operation D-Elite - the joint ICE and FBI raids against the US-based BitTorrent tracker, EliteTorrents, in 2005.


Everyone charged so far has been accused of being involved in the uploading of Star Wars Episode III which, at the time, was a pre-release movie, carrying criminal implications for the uploaders under the Family Entertainment Copyright Act.


According to an announcement by Assistant Attorney General Alice S. Fisher of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Patrick L. Meehan for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a seventh defendant has pleaded guilty.
AXXO ADSO

An Duc Do, aged 25, of Orlando, Florida, has pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Legrome D. Davis of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on a two-count felony. He?s charged with conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and criminal copyright infringement.


Do is the latest in a line of people pleading guilty in this operation against EliteTorrents. Previous guilty pleas and convictions include those of Scott McCausland, Grant Stanley, Sam Kuonen and Scott D. Harvanek.


In this copyright case tried in the criminal (rather than civil) legal domain, potential punishments are harsh. Do is facing up to 10 years in prison coupled with a fine of $500,000.


He will be sentenced on February 27th, 2008.

if you have problems with watching ANY movie either get VLC media player, GOM Player, or XBMC.
All of them are free and play everything. You can also fix sync problems. ;)"

you will need to download a codec pack i use K-Lite Codec Pack (Its free) it will fix problems with audio and video."

,Oxyntas-Kovacs,2010-04-03T00:55Z,"Great Thanks to moviebobo & aXXo .
If you are getting problems with Sound or Video ,then try this combination .
http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm
http://kmplayer.en.softonic.com/        *Download and Install*
KMPlayer Provides you the best quality image and sound :color balance ,contrast ,and other options ,so use it as your Default Player for music and videos 
1 weakness :Subtitles aren't placed properly ,needs manual config. the solution Use this
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html ,VLC media player is the best for Soft subtitled movies,anime manga ..etc MKV files (matroska video)
The sub (text) are properly placed ,Comparing to KMPlayer .
About :K-Lite Mega Codec Pack ,it updates your players (WindowsMediaPlayer,MPC,KMP..)with new codecs .VLCplayer not included
P.S: RealPlayer ,GOM media player Provides you only error Shit Registry and bugs (Tested) But it's cool if you like that kind of Shit.
Check for newer Codecs here  http://www.codecguide.com/

PEACE & LOVE Brothers :) ."
