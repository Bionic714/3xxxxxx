I haven't had any issues with the avi's you've been uploading.  Thanks for doing that.

By the way, in case you care - its spelled 'certified'..."

my only request is can you upload the entire season2 of dexter?.....the only torrents i can find of the first half of this season are in rar :(

You would really be my hero if you could upload season2 as a whole (all twelve episodes in one torrent).Again, much thanks for your effort!
~Sorry for all the requests~
