I've tried to convert them to wave for burning, but when I do, they are empty.

,norsee,2007-11-05T19:43Z,"To play, burn and convert, use http://www.mediamonkey.com/product.htm"
,norsee,2007-11-05T19:46Z,PS: There is nothing wrong with the files.
,chrenos,2007-11-22T22:35Z,"I too had problems with buring these flacs on a CD-R with regular Nero and Easy CD-DA Extractor 10. Then I tried a more powerful/flexible RiverPast Audio Converter 7.2, and converted all flacs to wavs successfully and then burnt the set on a disk alright. Sounds perfect. There you go."

Thanks alot dude, you really helped me out, also, thanks for the torrent, i really appreciated it. :)"
,CAPITALISTPIG,2008-02-08T21:38Z,Thank you.....
,CAPITALISTPIG,2008-02-08T21:40Z,Pig man pig charade you are
,mad_swan,2008-04-09T06:33Z,"Thanx a lot!
Btw, you can convert (and create) flac files to (from) wav with these:
http://flac.sourceforge.net/
http://mediacoder.sourceforge.net/
To Nevodaniel: winamp can play flacs natively."
,mad_swan,2008-05-07T16:34Z,"Hi!
I tried to convert the files with flac 1.2.1 (command line and frontend) and did not work. Seem to be some problems with the headers. Maybe media mokey did something that the others codecs do not understand."
