Music from the Succubus Club is a music CD released as an accompaniment to the White Wolf, Inc. roleplaying game Vampire: The Masquerade. Its name is derived from the "Succubus Club", a fictional location (and popular nightclub) in the World of Darkness, the setting for the game and others like it.

A fictionalized quote, included in the compilations cover notes, and attributed to the fictional DJ Damascus (a DJ from The Succubus Club) states that 'Iâ??Ã?Ã´ve noticed that each of these songs seems to strike a chord with a particular clan.' [1] In this sense, therefore, each track featured on the compilation may be linked to one of the fictional clans within the roleplaying world of Vampire: The Masquerade. In the track listing, below, each name in parentheses denotes the clan which each track represents.
