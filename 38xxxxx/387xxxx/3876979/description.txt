P L O T     S U M M A R Y
A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great
French chef despite his family's wishes and the
obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly
rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in
the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated
beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary
hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent
dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly
unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French
restaurant, Remy's passion for cooking soon sets
into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that
turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.
