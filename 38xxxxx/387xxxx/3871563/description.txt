Handley-Page Victor K.2 & K.1

As one third of Britain's V-Bomber Force, the role of the Victor was clear- fly high and fast and so avoid Soviet SAMs whilst delivering its nuclear payload. The B.1 was unable to fulfil this role due to Soviet advances in technology, so the more powerful B.2 was introduced in 1962. However, by 1964 it still had to be consigned to the low-level and K.1 and later K.2 tanker roles. The Victor soldiered on as a tanker into the '90s, when it was used in the Gulf War.
