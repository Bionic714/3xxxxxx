,Blackwing Dragon,2007-11-08T23:52Z,"Hahaha, finally that stupid ass noob left the scene XD.
Guess our ""message"" went through then. Immature little idiot took shit out of games and reposted them thinkin he was the shit :-D.
Ahhh..god it feels nice. DIE."
[V],Subzero!,2007-11-09T15:47Z,"@ReaperManT

heya freak , IF you claim its so easy, so why dont you ""rip"" the games by yourself and upload them?... BECAUSE its just slipslop from yourside,
guess here's None but fools! and youre the leader of them.

i would like to see a gears of war rip, its so damn easy as you say... and please i would see it compressed with UHA and a completly Batch install included, youre a wanna be and nothing else... otherwise you could ""easy"" prove that black is white... but then you cant!."
[V],Subzero!,2007-11-09T15:49Z,"still waiting bonehead, and btw,. ive crunched it to 2.4 gigs. (/gears of...that is)   ... we'll wait for your exciting version....

i coming after you when i done fucking your mother, prepare your ass, smell my cum..."
[V],Subzero!,2007-11-09T22:00Z,"@ReaperManT

the way you have described rippin' a game would not work.... bcoz, the  most important thing you have totally forgotten about, (people who know what ""rip"" means, may know what i mean....)
and you reaperdeeperteen tell me what this is.
you have to unearth new evidence that you really can do better than dope, but you wont!...dope is cult... and youre nuthing!... simple like this outta here waste of time with morons like him.... he's ONLY 	jealous"

[T],splattergod,2007-11-13T11:45Z,"ReaperManT:
It always cracks me up when stupid little gits, such as yourself, attempt to act like they know what they are blathering on about-
It's obvious that you are a frustrated virgin who couldn't get laid in a women's prison, with a fist full of pardons-
You have never uploaded a thing-
Yet you run your mouth about other people's work-
My guess is that you kept sending gay love poems to dopman, and when he told you to piss off, you got your panties in a bunch-
Oh, and the sad attempt, by you, to pretend that you were/are dopeman is pathetic-
He is actually capable of writing in complete, articulate sentences-
You, on the other hand, write like a retarded chimp jerking off to gerbil porn-
Loser!"

Perhaps manners failed to reach you and your family of inbreds. But generally you only download stuff you like, if you don't like it then don't click on it. I can see you have such a vast knowledge of computers ""(thats why graphic cards are becoming monsters at crunching textures and polygons and all that shit)"" WOW yes I have finally figured it out!.. the bigger the game the more graphics. What are you? a f*cking idiot. I have a degree in programming games, nt to mention my microsoft engineers licence and programming one. What do you have? Sorry to post this but I hate useless bastards who think because they can press the power button their an expert"
,mikemn,2007-11-22T18:29Z,ty for all the games i have a huge collection of games almost all of them so i will be set for about the next ten years i will be looking for you in 10 yrs hopefully you come out of retirement by then.
