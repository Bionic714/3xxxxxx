,allwyn2,2008-07-15T15:22Z,"I used this and after installing it, it eliminated the remaining days I had to validate windows, and now I can't log into windows because it is asking me to validate my windows before I can log in. So now I can't access anything on my laptop.  Any help to get this windows validated would be appreciated so I can access the data on my laptop, without losing it by reinstalling windows.  Thanks."
