,alienhands.org,2007-11-10T03:56Z,"Great! I will promptly begin downloading this great show. 

However I just a small question which I hope that an TPB/torrent oracle can help a TPB/torrent noob with: Why is this torrent so much smaller in (Gig) size than other Heroes season 1 torrents? Is it a video-quality issue (TV- or DVDrip) or how can it be explained?

Thanks 
Alienhands.org"
,Inter4ction,2007-11-10T18:49Z,i think that this quality sucks more so i'm DL that 8 G big File
,ossz,2007-11-15T05:30Z,"Its smaller file size because its XviD, which is still pretty damn good compared to the DVD rip which is twice the filesize"
,analkal,2007-11-15T11:39Z,seed plz
,Obveron,2007-11-21T14:47Z,"actually dude, even for xvid, these are low quality. most xvids are twice this quality/file size"

,roso91,2008-07-16T15:16Z,Could anyone upload the webepisode? Can't watch it from Norway! :(
,McF,2008-07-28T19:10Z,"quality download, audio and video are great for the size of the file. Been playing them on my xbox 360 no problem at all. Keep it up"
,rapion125,2008-07-29T02:39Z,"Very good torrent. The quality is watchable. I really don't feel like downloading an extra 4 GB for some better quality. It's ""high quality"" on a portable media player."
,Bladt,2008-08-03T19:05Z,"Please seed, there are 100 more seeders than lechers but iÂ´m stil downloading with only 1,4kB/s.

VERY nice up by the way!"

,crazyskier51,2008-08-26T21:31Z,"please seed, i need this!"
,johooh,2008-08-27T19:02Z,"Ok, I just have to make this clear: If you download these codecs you will be able to watch pretty much anything from the net:

First download DivX from divx.com (duh?)
then download Xvid from xvid.org (duh again?)
then some videos needs some kind of ac3 filter or something, the player (in my case windows media player) usually tells you what sort of codec is missing."
,captainkb,2008-08-27T23:06Z,i have high speed internet but my downloads only range from 20-50kb/s any reason why?
,solidsnake2730,2008-08-29T04:55Z,@captainkb it also matters how many seeders
,Spyke88,2008-09-01T03:48Z,"Problem watching videos?

Download:
K-Lite Codec Pack Full, it contains probably all decoders you might need to watch videos on you comp, as well as Media Player Classic, a very good basic media player that plays just about everything!
Or you could download VLC, ZoomPlayer, Divx Player..."
,fxjdns,2008-09-05T16:15Z,"Argh, wont work in VLC (on mac). All other AVI file work, just no these.

It ""plays"" but goes through in 5-10 seconds, no audio or video. Also Quicktime says, ""The file is not a movie file.""

Help!?"
,guitarkid,2008-09-25T00:14Z,"fxjdns, i use visual hub to re-code everything that is not native to my system. It re-codes everything fairly quickly on my mac then i just delete the originals. You can turn it into any format you want pretty much. i actually paid for it ($23) but i seen a torrent for it too. "
,ScarySquirrel,2008-09-27T10:44Z,"I offer the user whose alias is burgersandchips my thanks. This torrent is a manageable size, and the VLC media player plays it will in Linux and Windows.
If I had disk space for it, I would seed this.  If anyone needs a temporary seed, let me know."
,Impulze105,2008-09-29T03:17Z,thanks....i will seed by 4....
,biketobe,2008-10-01T13:54Z,Have you downloaded the VLC media player?
,DocSpade40,2008-10-04T10:27Z,Is there a way to convert this and burn it to a DVD that will play in any DVD player?
,MoOnLoRd420,2008-10-09T07:53Z,yes there is a way to play these on a dvd player get nero and use make your own dvd option and just add 3 episodes per dvd for good quality hope that helps
,ScarySquirrel,2008-10-22T03:13Z,"I downloaded this episode with the Transmission Bittorrent client.
It played well, but with some skipping on Ubuntu 7.10 Hardy with the xine codec set.  It had no skipping on Windows.
I found the premise and storyline required not only suspension of disbelief and the expectation of a coherent storyline.  Still, I liked it."
,rattleandhum9,2008-12-05T00:07Z,please seed. 2kb/s max.
,rattleandhum9,2008-12-05T00:08Z,please seed. only 2 kb/s.

,Rogerick,2009-02-07T21:55Z,"Deucalion2008 - Mac MiniINTEL here.
I am hearing impaired.  One of the most beneficial features for me on TPB is getting seasons with subs.  If you edit, you won't be able match any sub sources out there (be out of sync), or include the ASTC CCaptioning as subs....or will you?  Do you use EYE by Elgato v3.n?  They say it will automatically generate a sub for avi.   Just got it this morning, but havn't yet figured that part out yet... possible.
 Anyway, if you don't care about subs, go for it. But what you are suggesting... Pure Content, but WITH subs!...I'd pay for that!  (Life is time, and time is money(when sold for wages/salary, or bought as life extension procedures)"
,xXClaireXx,2009-02-09T15:15Z,"Hey burgersnchips i wonder how fast is your connection?

,LazyTown,2009-02-18T01:34Z,Seeders for this torrent suck....
,feardisXx,2009-03-27T19:01Z,Why am I only getting audio. I have Divx and all that stuff... Any Ideas? Windows Media Player just gives me the audio and their little ambiance settings.
,Robinhoody,2009-03-29T21:29Z,"MOAR SEEDERS

14 seeds 8 peers and im getting nothing higher than 3kB/s"
,Robinhoody,2009-03-29T21:33Z,"If you're only getting audio when using Windows Media Player try downloading VLC Media Player, it comes with most codecs already installed."
,Robinhoody,2009-03-31T22:05Z,"Finally finished watching this addicting series, quality is great no problems at all
I recommend downloading VLC media player (freeware) which has never failed to play any video for me as it seems some people had trouble viewing these

Great torrent, interesting show."
,Marcus101RR,2009-05-01T04:04Z,What codec does this need? It does not work.
,Bebbex,2009-07-13T23:13Z,"Thanks! My dl is steady at 3-500 kB/s :D

Can't rate the quality yet though."
,rustplay,2010-07-03T02:34Z,"Both audio and video are low quality, low resolution
and the audio is at 32000 hz"
,ZaClR,2010-07-29T20:40Z,"@feardisXx

Try using VLC Media Player instead. That's the best player for video, and it has all codecs needed pre-installed.
It's free as well =) Windows media player... sux in my opinion :P Try VLC."
