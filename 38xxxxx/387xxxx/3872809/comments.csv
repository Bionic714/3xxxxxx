2. install 
3. register with the serial
4. enjoy"
,likefireflies,2008-10-04T19:54Z,"Well, changing the date does work! If you've already installed the screen saver before changing it, you'll have to uninstall it. Change the date, then reinstall. Save yourself some time and just change the date 1st! Thank you"
,Torrentbuyer5,2008-10-04T20:42Z,"Here's an idea why doesn't someone go to http://www.laconicsoftware.com get the new version of the Fantastic Flame Screen Saver, register it, make a torrent, upload it, and give the registration name and registration key on the info page of the torrent on TBP and that's that. Come on people use your heads. "
