This part can be seen in the chapter selection, but you can`t select it because it has been deleted. For your information its the preview for another movie: ""Machete"", and it is hilarious. I can understand when people delete extra stuff, but this is really part of the movie. 

If you want the entire movie, look someplace else... "

If it is the trailer, how in ANY way does this affect the FILM!  People remove trailers so the actual film itself is at its best quality.  It would be good if you could clarify what you mean"
,MISELIINI,2008-04-03T15:54Z,"Machete's trailer used to be fake trailer made by Robert Rodriguez but then Rodriguez decided to use the idea and is now really making this movie: http://imdb.com/title/tt0985694/
Grindhouse theatres used to show 2 movies in a row and some trailers of other exploitation movies before them and between them. Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino wanted to make it as realistic as it could be and decided to put some trailers there. Rodriguez didn't want to waste this Machete idea he had had for a long time and used it as a trailer. Now Machete is really being filmed."
