,Leib,2007-11-09T18:07Z,"Thanks Pirate Bay for putting this in the right category.

I see there's been a number of ppl who've reached 100% in their download and are now seeding.

So? Tell me how my first torrent/seed job is working folks!

Enjoy!"
,Leib,2007-11-09T18:29Z,Thanks winydink. You're right! I've been uploading some Chinese vids to VEOH also today and my brain was fixed mostly on those. I knew this was Japanese. When I see there are no peers I'll take this down and re-up it with your correction.
,wonderaj,2007-11-17T05:47Z,leib do you any other kurosawa movies

Note: I've renamed some of the files from the original torrents' name, but I don't remember which is which.

Let me know if you can't find them either here on PirateBay or on www (dot) mininova (dot) org and I'll start new torrents and seed them

,raheesen,2008-09-17T05:04Z,excellent quality...nice movie...thanks.
,LezDawson,2008-12-01T19:18Z,"Damn, just can't find a decent rip of this film! I got another version through R@p!dsh@re, and the picture quality is quite bad, and also it's in two halves that can't be joined because they're at different data rates!  Amateur rippers!  Oh well, my search goes on. :) "
,LezDawson,2008-12-03T08:14Z,"Thanks man - the quality's not too bad at all! :)  I got another version that was larger than this and worse quality, so I'm keeping this one.  Thanks again. :)"
,xas210,2009-06-02T05:20Z,"http://asiandvdclub.org/ is really good for kurosawa.. dont wanna rain on piratebays parade - we all love TPB - but for asian movies, like kurosawa, it's much better. they have serious film formats (like a 3CD, 22GB version of kurosawa's seven samurai.)  "
,shiningwiz,2011-02-22T19:21Z,"Oh man, I had no idea this film was gonna be 3 hours long... if I'd known, I would never have downloaded this one. 1.12 GB is just not enough for a 185 minute film... I'd rate the A/V - 7/7. It's decent, and watchable, for what it is. Resolution is really low - 528x240, so you can see a lot of compression artifacts and such. I'd recommend looking for at least a 1.4+ GB version if you really want this in good quality, because at that size it SHOULD have the proper resolution and bitrate etc."
,Leib,2011-03-21T04:44Z,"@shiningwiz

Like they say, those who don't do - play critic. Lemme see.... you've uploaded HOW many videos ? - Oh right... NONE. In spite of all your techno-whining the bottom line AS YOU YOURSELF said:

""It's decent, and watchable...""

So what's all the complaining about ?

I'd be happy if someone upped a better version with English subs included. I'd then be happy to delete this. I've been seeding this for 3 1/2 years with only 400 or so uploads grabbed from me with another 12-13 seeders on average joining me. If these other seeders averaged a similar amount then I'd say we provided a good bit of pleasure to quite a number of people, I can't ask for more than that."
,shasham,2011-04-02T18:29Z,"I really can't thank you enough for your generosity and efforts in sharing this treasure with us. On behalf of all who appreciate you, my apologies for those who have the incredibly bad manners to actually complain about a gift freely given. I'll seed this at least 1/1. Cheers and thanks to seeders too!"
,Leib,2011-04-03T09:50Z,"@Shasham - Thanks for the nice words, I just now realized I answered ""shiningwiz""  a month after his ridiculous post and he will probably never even see my rejoinder - well, let it stand anyway. Maybe others will read it and act more maturely before commenting uselessly."
,bragazar1710,2011-05-17T08:15Z,thanks.
