Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Packard Bell (PfP)
Windows Entertainment Pack for Packard Bell (WEPPB)
A Preserved for Posterity Release
November 5, 2007

As the name implies, Preserved for Posterity exists for the sole
purpose of preserving the past, well into the future. When PfP began,
we weren't too certain as to the best method of achieving this goal.
As a result, there are a few PfP releases floating around out there in
cyberspace that should probably be deleted and forgotten due to their
extreme inelegance and awful design. In fact, any PfP release prior to
October 1, 2007 should be considered Recycle Bin fodder! Uninstall and
delete those old releases and keep an eye out for much improved
replacements - You will not be disappointed!

Our intent is to locate old software, which is no longer available for
sale (this is typically referred to as Abandonware, Orphanware, or
some other such moniker) and create new setups (installers) which
allow these blasts from the past to function correctly on modern PC's.
To achieve this, we make the best possible use of tools such as
DOSBox, VDMSound and the ever present Windows Command Interpreter
(when working with MS-DOS applications). Improved installers are
created for older Windows based applications.

This release contains the original Entertainment Pack for Packard Bell.
The original setup (installer) for WEPPB, unlike the earliest
Entertainment Packs for Windows, actually installs perfectly on later
versions of Windows. We have, however, created a 32-bit installer for
WEPPB, just as we have with Entertainment Packs 1-4. This installer
should be compatible with most 32-bit versions of Windows (untested on
Vista). Remember, this is 16-bit software, even though our installer is
32-bit. This may prevent the software from being compatible with Vista,
as we have heard that Vista doesn't support legacy 16-bit sofware,
however, we are at present unsure of this. We don't currently use
Vista, and have no immediate plans to migrate to it. This software
should function with Windows 9x, ME, NT and XP without problems.
Eventually, we will support Vista. In fact, we could launch DOSBox
within Vista, Install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (or other 3.x
Windows) into DOSBox and install the original Windows Entertainment
Pack for Packard Bell into that environment and it would work. We have
tested this method with DOSBox on Windows XP and it works well and
should also work with Vista as DOSBox is a 32-bit application (this
method is also possible within Linux using the Linux version of
DOSBox). Just thought we would give you a few hints on using legacy
16-bit Windows software with Vista and Linux, in case the use of
DOSBox to run Windows 3.1 had not occurred to you.

This setup creates the following DIRectories (folders):
My Documents\Inno Setup scripts
My Documents\Disk Images\Floppy\1.44M
Program Files\Microsoft Games\WEPPB

The WEPPB folder is the folder where the Windows Entertainment Pack for
Packard Bell is installed. The 1.44M folder exists as part of our goal
of preserving the original software for posterity. Within the 1.44M
folder is a floppy diskette image of the original Windows Entertainment
Pack for Packard Bell that we have. It was created using WinImage
8.10.8100 directly from the original floppy diskette, and requires
WinImage or other diskette image tool for manipulation. The diskette
image is named WEPPB.imz. The Inno Setup scripts folder will contain
the script used to generate this installer via Jordan Russell's
Inno Setup software. This installer has been designed to completely
remove itself when uninstalled, with the exception of the Disk Images
and Inno Setup scripts folders. These folders may be safely deleted at
any time, should you have no need or desire for the diskette images of
the original 16-bit installer and/or setup scripts.


The following program group will be created:
START>PROGRAMS>MICROSOFT GAMES>WINDOWS ENTERTAINMENT PACK>PB
which will contain the following icons (games):
Chess
Dr. Black Jack
Fuji Golf
JigSawed
Life Genesis
Rattler Race
Rodent's Revenge
SkiFree

We are certain that it will probably annoy some people that we are
including original disk images with these distributions. Other people
will be ecstatic. We would just like to say that in order to fulfill
our goal, the diskette images MUST be included. Certainly, some may be
annoyed that we are including the Paint and Reversi applications from
Windows 1.01, Windows 2.03, Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1. ToastyTech.com
succeeded in patching the Windows 1.01 and 2.03 applications so that
they would function with later versions of Windows. The Windows 3.x
applications work with all later versions of Windows out of the box. We
decided it would be cool to include the Paint 1.01 and Reversi 1.01
with Entertainment Pack 1, Paint 2.03 and Reversi 2.03 with
Entertainment Pack 2, Paint and Reversi from Windows 3.0 with
Entertainment Pack 3 and Paint and Reversi from Windows 3.11 with
Entertainment Pack 4 (Note: Reversi 3.11 was NOT included with Windows
3.11, but was offered as a download from Microsoft, which is where we
got it). We have decided to include Solitaire from Windows 3.0 with
Windows Entertainment Pack : Volume Three.

Install and Enjoy these classic games on your modern PC! Look for more
PfP releases, with Entertainment Pack #4 following next.
(Entertainment Packs 1-3 are already available, 4 is in the works.)

The original Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP) was a
collection of simply-designed computer games for Windows. These games
were somewhat unusual for the time, in that they would not run under
MS-DOS. Many of the games were later released in the Best of Windows
Entertainment Pack. There were four Entertainment Packs in the original
series.

GameSampler
A version of the Entertainment Pack called the Gamesampler, small
enough to fit on a single high-density disk, was shipped as the 11th
disk in a ten-pack by Verbatim for much of the early 1990s, allowing
many users to acquire them as a freebie. Games on the sampler included
Jezzball, Rodent's Revenge, Tetris, and Skifree. A "Best of" disk of
several of the games was also available at times as a mail-in premium
from Kellogg's cereals.
