Indeed, when you think about it the participants of the Boston Tea Party must be rolling in their graves right now given the extreemly high taxes we pay.

But then again when you ponder the fact that not only is our standard of living higher than it's ever been but higher then ANYONE's has ever been in the history of mankind, one must wonder if these high taxes are such a bad thing."
,todu,2007-12-22T16:04Z,This documentary made me afraid of our government. Where does money come from? Who decides how much money we should create? This doc makes you think. Too bad there are no subtitles though. I would have enjoyed it even more if it had.
