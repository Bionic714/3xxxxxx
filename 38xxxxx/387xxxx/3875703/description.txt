The Tupolev Tu-154 (NATO reporting name: Careless) is a Soviet medium-range trijet airliner, equivalent to the Boeing 727. It remains the standard airliner for domestic routes in Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union and to a lesser extent in eastern Europe and Iran. The mainstay of Russian airlines for several decades, the Tu-154 has carried about half of all passengers flown by Aeroflot and its subsidiaries, approx. 137 mill passengers/year. It has also been exported and operated by at least 17 foreign airlines.
