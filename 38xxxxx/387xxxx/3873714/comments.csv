many tnx

I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day. ::)

You are welcome imback and everyone else. Initially we made a torrent for LAMEWIN32.EXE which was the mp3-tech.org version 3.94 and we included the updated binaries in .zip files, plus the CD WAVE app. Some users PM'ed that this was a bit of a hassle to put all together, so we made a new torrent that just installed LAME 3.97 and RAZORLAME in the same fashion as mp3-tech.org's LAMEWIN32 and again we threw in CD WAVE. It worked great, but some users just wanted the basics - a LAMEWIN32.EXE that functioned just like the one previously available from mp3-tech.org, but with the current binaries, so we made that too, which is what you see here. We aim to please PfP"
