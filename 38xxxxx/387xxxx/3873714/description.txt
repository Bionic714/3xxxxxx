NOVEMBER 5, 2007

A Preserved for Posterity Release
November 5, 2007

This is simply an installer for the compiled binaries of the current
versions of L.A.M.E. and RazorLame. LAMEWIN32.EXE was a distribution of
mp3-tech.org, at least as far as L.A.M.E. 3.94 and RazorLame 1.1.5.
However, for reasons unknown to the PfP team, pre-compiled binary
installers of LAMEWIN32.EXE are no longer available for download from
mp3-tech.org. We assume that this has something to do with the IP
holders of the .mp3 technology, but that\'s only a guess. In any event,
your friendly PfP team has decided to make available a current version
of LAMEWIN32.EXE. Install and Enjoy! This REALLY IS THE BEST MP3
ENCODER and GUI (FRONT-END)
