Please seed!

Thanks."
,JacquesMerde,2008-06-18T11:31Z,"Why make a torrent and then not seed?
Seed for f**k sake"
,greatgoogly,2008-08-28T04:48Z,Please seed. I've been at 93.7% for 3 weeks.  It would really be appreciated.
,CoolRunninHMS139,2008-09-07T16:38Z,"Same problem, stuck at 93.7. How do I find someone else with a file to share?

PS I'm still seeding!"
,chakalak,2008-12-29T21:13Z,please seed
,FOGARELLA,2009-04-06T09:35Z,Is the uploader dead ? If I'd gone to the trouble of uploading something I'd check every now and then to see if a bit of help was necessary to keep the torrent alive. Sad to be so near watching Kay Lenz in this particularly desirable film.
,HannibalCrossesTheAlps,2009-07-02T22:27Z,Please seed. Is this the Eastwood film...?
