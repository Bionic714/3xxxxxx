Bob's intro quote: "Now that's what I'm talkin' about!"

Cinegroup's episode summary: Down on planet Pyritia, Chode and Gus obtain a medallion that will supposedly lead them to a treasure beyond their wildest dreams. But it's all a hoax fabricated by the villainous Pyritians who enslave them and force them to search for the actual key to said treasure. It's up to Chode's cunning and Gus' metal to get them out of another tight spot.

My additional comments: Good episode, lots of laughs in it. The whole thing starts because Six is mad at Chode and cut him off from sex, so they hit what appears to be a strip club, where they meet the person that gives them the medallion (listed above). Really nice twist at the end of it. The writing is really spectacular this season.
