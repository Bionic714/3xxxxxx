If you actually looked at the torrent you would've seen that the files are in AVI format, the description was a typo on my part.

Also no need to be a dick! If you don't like the way the files are ripped either download them or shut the fuck up and go somewhere else or better yet buy the damn DVD. "

google this:
media player classic codec pack

install it and everything will work.

if you can't work that out then you should not be downloading torrents.
