In the late 1970s, it was unheard - of to merge punk with heavy metal. But then came Motorhead up on stage blasting out high-energy three-chord punk rock with a metallic edge, all the while looking like longhaired bikers from hell... 
--------------------------------------------------------------
When Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister was arrested and exiled from his old band, Hawkwind, he wasn't about ready to stop making music. After getting back on track, he formed a new trio called Motorhead, named for a song he originally performed back in his Hawkwind days. Over the years they would rise to fame as the founding fathers of thrash/speed metal, but in their early days the band was pretty much unrecognized. The band's early recording sessions didn't gain any attention. But once Kilmister had recruited classic band members "Fast" Eddie Clark and Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor, he got the opportunity to record an album. In just two days, the band recorded what got released as their debut album...
-----------------------------------------------------------
Motohead's 1977 self-titled debut includes the same buzz-saw punk metal that the trio would soon take to the top of the U.K. charts, and which would make them one of rock's most influential outfits. Included are such classic cuts as the title track, "Iron Horse/Born To Lose", "Lost Johnny", and "The Watcher".
