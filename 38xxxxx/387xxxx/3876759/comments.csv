,BacardiRazz7,2009-05-04T10:27Z,Download the K-lite codec pack if the sound does not work.

Download the standard edition, then you can play every type of sound."

,ljs9108,2009-09-10T11:12Z,"1st Piratebay Rocks.

I think deanocunniffe is right.  This is not an axxo torrent.  I've only seen real axxo torrents on mininova.  Stop using a famous name to get downloaders.  If you upload good stuff you will become trusted and well liked.  What's the big deal anyway who's torrent gets the most hits?  Is this some form of dorky dweeb combat?  If you don't like what I say, then kiss my ass."
,ljs9108,2009-09-10T11:16Z,"oh yeah, SOUND?  get the ac3 codec."
