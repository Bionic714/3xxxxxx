SMAC is a powerful, yet an easy-to-use and intuitive Windows MAC Address Modifying Utility (MAC Address spoofing) which allows users to change MAC address for almost any Network Interface Cards (NIC) on the Windows VISTA, XP, 2003, and 2000 systems, regardless of whether the manufacturers allow this option or not.

SMAC does not change the hardware burned-in MAC addresses.  SMAC changes the "software based" MAC addresses, and the new MAC addresses you change will sustain from reboots.

SMAC helps people to protect their privacy by hiding their real MAC Addresses in the widely available wifi Wireless Network.  SMAC also helps Network and IT Security professionals to troubleshoot network problems, test Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS,) test Incident Response plans, build high-availability solutions, recover (MAC Address based) software licenses, and etc... 

SMAC is the first Windows MAC Address Modifying Utility (since 2002), and it is developed base on the extensive research of KLC Consulting, Inc.  SMAC is continuous updated with the latest trend in the networking and security, as well as valuable customers' wishes and feedbacks.
