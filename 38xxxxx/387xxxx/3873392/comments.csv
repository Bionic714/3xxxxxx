,snowshifter,2007-11-16T17:53Z,Thank you! It has taken me 20 years to find this. I'll  seed while I can- poor connection. Any English users find a copy of Liquid Sky and have a Scala nostalgia special!
[T],oddeven,2007-11-17T03:13Z,I'll try to put up Liquid Sky sometime soon.
[T],oddeven,2007-11-20T05:46Z,What's Scala anyway?
,titestef,2007-11-22T01:52Z,do you have DEEP THROAT with Linda Lovelace on DVD ? 
[T],oddeven,2007-11-22T13:07Z,"a really awful copy - titestef - my copy of Inside Deep Throat has a much sharper picture in the clips that it shows.
I haven't figured out how to do a proper search in the porn section of the bay, but I would think it must be here somewhere."
,titestef,2007-11-24T04:30Z,"if you can upload your dvd copy of DEEP THROAT, you are welcome !!!  thanks
kisses
stef"
,titestef,2007-11-24T04:33Z,"DOWNLOADED !
Full Screen / Dolby Digital 2.0 (English / no subtitles)
Special Features : Photo Gallery
Audio/Video Quality : sound is fine for a production of its type and for its year (1982), picture has not been remastered, a little bit better than VHS, but from the same tape source. Colours are washed out, lacks of definition. But it's acceptable. "
[T],oddeven,2007-11-24T06:34Z,"titestef - What I have is just a divx converted to DVD.  You can probably do better. 
I do have, however, ""Flesh Gordon"" and its sequal ""Flesh Gordon Meets the Cosmic Cheerleaders""
I was tripping the first time I saw it and boy were those penisaurises scary."

,marthafar,2011-07-01T22:30Z,"The Scala was a repetory cinema in London, adjacent to Kings Cross Station, that showed fabulous films: double bills, schlock fests, all nighters ... it was wonderful, even the the feel of trains rumbling below while sitting on the bad seating was something to relish. The Scala sadly closed after a court case following a screening of A Clockwork Orange in the early 1990s (billed, if I recall correctly as Adventures of Alex) when the film had been withdrawn from circulation by Stanley Kubrick. Bands played there from time to time, most notably Iggy and the Stooges in 1973. The venue opened again a few years ago, as a night club/disco/place to see bands, but it is not even a shadow of its former self. A moment in cinema history passed when it closed in the early 1990s.
