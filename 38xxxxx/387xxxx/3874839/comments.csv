you should stick with wmv... the only reason i download high def is so i can watch it on my xbox360... come on...
takes like an extra 4 hours to convert it to wmv, any chance youll change your ways?"
,hata,2007-11-06T07:03Z,Just watch it on your PC. Really good resolution!
,andresv,2007-11-06T07:31Z,Matroska rules. WMV sucks.
,goonfan212,2007-11-06T07:57Z,007ace - try opening the file with Media Player and then saving it as an avi file. Takes just a few minutes.  Works great for me.

You won't regret, mates, it's over 1G, but the episodes get more interesting with excelent quality, and they come only once a week. It's worth.
Peace."
