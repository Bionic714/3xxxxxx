In configuration select configuration and this will get you to configure include a tutorials, standards etc? then when all said and done?. And provided you have selected the MECHANICAL OPTION,  it will ask you for disk 2 which has the mech, you need to un mount the first disk and mount the second disk ,,,,,IN THE SAME DRIVE, this is important?. And then when it finish from disk 2 ..will ask you for disk 1 again to finalise the installation??.. finally when you come to run for the first time that?s when you need to go into the CRACK dir into the this virtual disk that mounted disk 1 ???.

,aljanabi,2008-04-17T22:44Z,"av read somwhere:
You can make up your own sn BUT with the following constraint for the 8 digit
either:

1) use 2 digit and repeat 4 times
e.g. 62626262 or 54545454 etc
or
2) use symetric 3 digit either side of two digit
eg  12345321  or  you see the one 12354321 the symetry about the 45 or 54

I think this work with any of the initial 3 digit
provided if use repatitive 2 digit string then the 3 digit must add up to EVEN Number the symetry string the 3 digit must add up to ODD number.

hope this gives food for thoughts...............

Windows 7 32bit: successfully installed

As many commented here I also got the 'please insert: AIP_2008_1 disk', or something like this, just before installation started (after disk 1 had been mounted, setup run, and configuration completed)

The solution is simple and found it in this spanish forum: http://www.vagos.es/showthread.php?t=204117&page=15

All you have to do is copy the contents of the mounted DVD1 to your hard-drive, rename aip_2008_1.mid to AIP_2008_1.mid and run setup.exe from that folder.
Yes, that simple.
