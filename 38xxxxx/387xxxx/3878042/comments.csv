,RocketRobinHood,2007-11-08T09:20Z,"Yeah, I probably over stretched myself by releasing three torrents right out the gate, considering I have basic DSL.

Don't worry though, the quality is top notch, and I'm sure that it'll be worth the wait."
,RocketRobinHood,2007-11-09T21:11Z,"Ok, so, as I mentioned before, I think I stretched myself a little thin with three releases right of the bat, so, I'm temporarily pausing Last Crusade and Raiders of the Lost Arc.
Temple of Doom is my most popular torrent, so I'm putting all my bandwidth towards it, in the hopes that once I get some seeders from there, I can then restart seeding the other two again.  Sorry guys, but I think this will work out being fastest for everyone."

,Raothi,2008-03-18T06:25Z,Ill seed as soon as I get it downloaded! I'm at 73.9% thus far. Keep me to the end and I can take over.
,entightenment,2008-12-09T10:09Z,"Hey Rocket,

I've been searching for a torrent of the Rocket Robin Hood series for years. You wouldn't happen to have some or all, would you? 

    The title song rocks!"
