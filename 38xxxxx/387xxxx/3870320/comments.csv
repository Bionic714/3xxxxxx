,finka-05,2007-11-03T12:23Z,fuck you as Reactor
,Frodge,2007-11-03T13:40Z,"It is seeding, but i think the connection/peer whatsoever isn't  very well."
[T],stevekasian,2007-11-03T21:20Z,"No, it's not seeding... the ReactoR691 dumbass hasn't a clue how torrents work."
,BlackBug,2007-11-04T13:43Z,"Weird, guys. I have downloaded this baby. (Not installed it though). It completed downloading in 45 mins flat. And I am seeding it too. I think we gotta give ReactoR691 his/her due. Thanx mate. However, I wish you would have uploaded the FS9 & FSX files seperately, and not as a single archive. So I suggest we all be patient - If anything, I am seeding this for sure. Take care. "
,ReactoR691,2007-11-08T12:24Z,"I was not, I not seeding, now I seed."
,ReactoR691,2007-11-09T16:07Z,"BlackBug,thnx,Installer it is intended both for fs9 and for fsx.in installer you may choose fs9 or X"
