Justice Hentai is a pin-up book. Each page has full color, full backgrounds, and is totally uncensored. This book was deliberately done by two different artists at Pal Comix, one specializing in the comic book style, and one in the TV animation style, so both of the common looks for all the superhero babes could be explored in great detail.

Justice Hentai is 50 pages long, 38 high quality pin-ups and the rest a mix of other related art. All art for this book is by the Pal Comix group. Conceptual design by: Deep Star & SHADE.
