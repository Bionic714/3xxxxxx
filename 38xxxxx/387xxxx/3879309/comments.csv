,dog george,2007-11-09T09:55Z,"Thanks, I will seed this torrent until my computer dies. I am totally fed up with all climate jerks that thinks the world is gonna end tomorrow cause we drive our cars. Would be nice though, if we could find an alternative to oil but only because I dont want to be depending on some muslim arab terrorists controlling it. "

,El Jafar,2007-11-18T01:19Z,"The last 150 years the CO2 in athmosphere has risen 0.008% to 0.038%. When plants set their foot on land, it was over 1%. That 0.008% is claimed to cause at least 1 degree warming. Hmmm...

Do anyone know where all the other 1% carbon(dioxide) have gone? Must be a lot of coal left to burn!"

,grooverf,2008-01-13T22:00Z,"90% of the world's scientists agree it's
happening and we are responsible.
Check out IPCC
(International Panel on Climate Change) "
,Baldrik1,2008-02-13T03:28Z,"Grooverf.

You are DEAD wrong.
It's more like 99.9% that DOES NOT agree with Al  Gore and   the UN.

They first claimed 2500 scientists have signed  the document supporting the ICPP.
But that  turned out to be a  huge lie.
Now it's only 600 left and most of them  doesn 't  even agree with icpp.
But  they  got  no  say on  the  matter and they  get  paid  ALOT by the  UN  to  just put their  name on the  paper.

 Wonder  what  people  like  you will  say when  the  next  iceage comes and  scientists  around the  world  says  it's  very close   now.

The  UN  is a  big  fraud and there is alot of corruptnes in the  UN."
,Baldrik1,2008-02-13T03:29Z,I  meant  IPCC not  icpp.
,Nailbanger,2008-03-22T13:27Z," Billions of fucking human roaches have no effect on the planet,right...
You fools are living in disneyland, I live close enough to the planet to SEE FOR MYSELF assholes. Plants bud too early every spring and then get killed by a late frost, you obviously live in a fucked up city if you rely on a stupid documentary for your info,lol.

Why did agriculture start at the same time in Mesopotamia and the Yellow river valley SIMULTANEOUSLY genius? Because the climate would not support it before that, this has been proved!!! So we are simply going back to that pattern, the ice core samples in Greenland prove this FACT. Only idiots remain in denial."

To Samscad66 : I find it very interesting that the
response is never about the science just personal attacks.
For your information I am a retired College/Engineering Instructor and have never worked for any Petrol firms. "

,markennz,2009-04-01T05:15Z,"grooverf may I remind you that there have been many scientific ""consensus"" that claimed to be correct in the past that were later proven to be incorrect. And beside since when has ""majority opinion"" ever been an indicator of scientific facts? The fallacy in this type of argumentation is laughable. Also your statement that 90% of the World's scientists believe that global warming is ""man made"" is false. Simple put the scientist in favor of this scientific opinion of global warming encompass  nowhere near 90% of the World's scientist, absolutely ridiculous. I'm sorry if I'm incommoding your propaganda blabbering but someone had to do it. Oh there is some other obviously uniformed individuals here as well that would do well to do some good unbiased scientific research on this subject. It's OK though I too was once uninformed on the subject but as questions began to merge my interest and research began to delve deeper and thus bringing me to a more scientifically sound opinion on the cause of global warming.
