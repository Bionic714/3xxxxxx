These are the files needed to run the game Curse of Monkey Island with ScummVM.

You also need some cutscene sound files (~6.6MBbs):

For those of you who don't know what ScummVM is (I was one of them!), It's a free program to run the game using it's data files.

Here's an extract from their website:

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical
point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data
files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the
executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on
systems for which they were never designed!

Some of the adventures ScummVM supports include Adventure Soft's Simon
the Sorcerer 1 and 2; Revolution's Beneath A Steel Sky, Broken Sword 1
and Broken Sword 2; Flight of the Amazon Queen; Wyrmkeep's Inherit the
Earth; Coktel Vision's Gobliiins; Westwood Studios' The Legend of
Kyrandia and games based on LucasArts' SCUMM (Script Creation Utility
for Maniac Mansion) system such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle,
Sam and Max and more. You can find a thorough list with details on
which games are supported and how well on the compatibility
page. ScummVM is continually improving, so check back often.

Among the systems on which you can play those games are Windows,
Linux, Mac OS X, Dreamcast, PocketPC, PalmOS, AmigaOS, BeOS, OS/2,
PSP, PS2, SymbianOS/EPOC and many more.


...so this zip file has all the files required. I also compressed the *.bun and *.san files using scumm-tools; this version is a fraction of the original size.
