,imarugbyball,2008-01-16T17:10Z,"Works great, followed the instructions as given in the description. Just download the scummvm thing, and then run the folder - i had to move the folder into program files so it would show up for some reason.

Thanks so much to the uploader, i loved this game as a kid and am very grateful for thwe great job you did."
