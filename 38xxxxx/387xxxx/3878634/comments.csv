Do you have 56-58?"
,k3ik0,2007-11-08T21:47Z,"issues 56 - 58 can be found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3756473/Y_-_The_Last_Man__1-57

To avoid duplicate torrents and spread of seeds, I'd recommend you to join that torrent. I'll be sure to check up on comments here, just let me know if that torrent is dead, and I'll upload another torrent for 54 - 58, since there's another torrent for 1 - 53 ; )"
,k3ik0,2007-11-08T21:52Z,"Doh, just realized 58 isn't covered by that one... Here you go:

,prol-1,2007-11-19T04:12Z,thanks k3iko.
,Masklin,2007-11-20T15:19Z,Sweet:)
,k3ik0,2007-11-22T12:48Z,"The sad thing is, I can't really see how they're going to wrap this story up in a decent way...

Minor spoiler:
this issue ends on kind of a down note, and I just don't feel there'll be enough pages to tie all the loose ends together in one last issue.

Brace yourself, people! It's been a wonderful ride, but IMO this baby's coming in for a crash landing ; )"
