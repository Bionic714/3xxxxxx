CleanStart is one of my first tools, but by god does it work great. Satisfaction is literally guaranteed. What it does is close down unneeded services before you launch game so you have every possible resource available to you while gaming. The Frame Rate increase is on average 40-50. Many people have told me this should be sold, but I like to give back to the gaming community I loved and miss.

 

This version is specifically configured to handle and optimize Activision's latest release, Call of Duty 4. From my beta testers, I have had only compliments about it, so I hope you will feel the same way.
