,ANDY123ZZZZZ,2007-11-08T01:30Z,I FIND that hard to believe when i have over 20 people that used it and all say it worked like a charm so plz dont ruin it for everyone else just because u dont know how to run your pc
,Drac0nis,2007-11-08T01:52Z,Sounds like a key-stealing program  to me. Use at your own risk.
,dazer44,2007-11-08T02:05Z,Sounds a bit dodgey to me. Learn about how the game works and configure it yourself. Its better in the long run + u learn a whole lot more about the game
,painful_rectal_itch,2007-11-08T04:22Z,I don't think so.
,Patchorus,2007-11-08T07:25Z,"like people said. this does look very dodgy. and the fact that this is your very first upload does not help much unfortunally. ive neither scanned not tried the program so i couldnt tell it is infact a virus. but people should know by now to be careful with that they run on their computers.
If this really does work as poster told, then its a great addition to the community!"
,Blackwing Dragon,2007-11-08T07:42Z,"I'm glad most people aren't as retarded as the uploader.
200 KB. Enough for a little program like that, and also enough for a ""Remove me not"" packacge :-D.

Besides, why would anyone risk himself if he can just fucking turn down the video options himself?! It takes a minimal PC to even run the game, so. EPIC PHAIL RIGHT HERE."
,_-klempo-_,2007-11-08T11:02Z,"""The Frame Rate increase is on average 40-50."" Interesting.

Stay away from this."
,ANDY123ZZZZZ,2007-11-08T12:49Z,"you know scan it with every program you have. Macafee, Norton, Whatever suits you. But to patronize me calling me a retard for uploading a file thats completly clean but your just so busy having your head stuck up on your own ass is beyond me. Dont download it if you dont want it. If you want help with your fps then take it. There has been no proof that this is a cd key stealer. You just assume it is due to its size. So really... um..... ur an idiot"
,wavecutter,2007-11-08T15:00Z,"He's right. It's clean.

,chrisse002,2007-11-10T19:08Z,"retards, I had to try this so i used virtual PC. result:

Computer fuckup :)"
,B1zzar0,2007-11-23T12:52Z,"CleanStart is one of my leeched viruses, but by god does it not work and is an obvious trap. Satisfaction is definitely not guaranteed. What it does is insert bullshit lies here which I have no fucking idea what I am talking about. The Frame Rate increase is on average 999000-100000 But that's average! Many people have told me this virus should be sold, but I like to shovel shit in the face of TPB and take up disk space that could be used for useful things. I hate myself. This version is specially configured to fuck your computer up good for the retard that downloads it. From my fake beta testers, they didn't give me compliments.

Instructions to fuck up your PC included.


By the way, This fucking shit makes me want to slam my head as hard as possible in the wall until it bleeds."
,MorpheusRO,2008-02-23T21:37Z,"The reaction that some users had is least to say annoying. I doubdt this tool is a virus but in any case , as a self-respecting gamer i would never use it. I know all i should know about PC configurations , in game FPS etc... as most users here. Therefore i suggest you stop posting such lame comments and leave the guy alone. It is also true that we cannot verify his claims , and the number of people that posted it does not work properly is pretty large. In any case USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND STFU .

Your's Sincerely
