Read your blog, and I too am constantly repairing the mess my friends and relatives make out of their computers, or stuck for hours somewhere with a computer with limited apps. My phone works as a memory key and i can't wait to download it to see if it all functions as described running off my cell. Thanks for sharing this."

,Xeokym,2008-12-15T06:14Z,"WOW...lotta stuff in this package. It'll take me awhile to check everything out!

In EVERY application thread, there's always at least ONE fartknocker screaming about a trojan virus. And 99% of the time it's just their jackass virus detector going off over every .exe file in existence that doesn't have a certification stamp from Bill Gates himself. These fucking ""virus detectors"" think everything being installed is OH NOES A VIRUZZ!!!1one!! Quit being fucking n00bs and panicking because your gayass virus alarm is going off! If you REALLY detect a virus or trojan among the files, then KINDLY POST THE NAME OF THE VIRUS and THE PATHNAME so the rest of us can located and eradicate it. Otherwise, STFU!!!!!!!"
