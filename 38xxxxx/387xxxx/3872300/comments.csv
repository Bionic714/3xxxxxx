,subnet_mask,2007-11-04T15:38Z,it has been seeding all the time and has uploaded over 150Mib. number of beers connected. perhaps you have to wait until more seeds become available. 
,subnet_mask,2007-11-05T10:53Z,"probably there is some tech problem, because it still seeds and has uploaded over 300 Mib. you can check the same torrent at http://isohunt.com/torrents/%22serial%20box%22
i've used BitTorrent client 4.4.1 to generate and seed the torrent. people are suggesting Azureus. i'll try it next time. "
