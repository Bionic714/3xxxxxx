,sindrige,2008-03-12T18:23Z,"how do you get past ""Starforce""?????????????????????"
,pet1100,2008-04-20T20:28Z,"please seed
13 kb/s and I am at 34%"
,Deputy276,2008-05-19T17:00Z,"No sense in seeding. It has Starforce protection. If someone has a crack location to bypass Starforce on this game please post it. Otherwise, downloading this is a waste of time."
,Deputy276,2008-05-19T20:15Z,"I found a possible no-cd crack that may get around the Starforce protection. You can try it here:
http://gbw.naxphost.com/dl.php?file=AgeOfPiratesCaribbeanTalesv1.41NoDVDFixedexeEng.rar

You will need a program to unzip rar files. Not sure this will work, but worth a try. At any rate, you DON'T want to install Starforce crap on your computer. I am going to see if I can rip this game from the CD and elminate the Starforce protection. If I can, I will post here and put up the game for download.

,Deputy276,2008-05-19T20:44Z,The crack I posted about and the one included wtith the Torrent DON'T work. Maybe I can rip the game without the Starforce garbage...not sure yet.
,lucker,2008-06-24T20:37Z,"Dont bother with the crack!
Here is what you got to do if you want it to work:
-mount rld-aop
-double click on the icon to play
-then you will see this ""checking disc"" naturaly it will fail then click retry and use option enter disc key then enter the following: sj2QeSs4JbBx5390
-Enjoy and don't forget to seed!


(if this doesn't work then I don't know what else to do)"
