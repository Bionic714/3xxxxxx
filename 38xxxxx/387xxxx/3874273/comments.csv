,fairytales,2009-07-07T15:39Z,"thx for not answering ( as I know the answer ) and thx for not uploading other religion material , we have a lot of Islamic sites , we dont need to upload hear , also if any body interrested , he can find it , let this site stay for science and fun we use this site for that dont spoil it as we spoiled mahy other things including Islam ."
,eternalquestion,2009-08-08T12:40Z,"Why in the world not post any religious material?  As a Muslim, I personally could not care less if there are Christian or other faith uploads here; enjoy in right good cheer.  I encourage sharing and learning as much as possible.

If the goal is science, well, TPB has plenty of documentaries on Islam and other relilgions, from all sorts of slants; if they are in the ""scientific"" group, then they are secondary in nature, so why not also have primary material available on hand.  As a point of balance: Satanism has a wide audience on tpb.  Any bans on them, or are they just fun-loving, harmless misrepresented anarchists?

And as far as fun, well --- a bit relative of a theme, isn't it?  "

Nice rply. We are free to post any thing which is worth sharing and its not hurting anyone to share Islamic materials here. I raelly agree with you and appreciate ur efforts. May Allah bless you. 
Alhamdolillah..!!"
