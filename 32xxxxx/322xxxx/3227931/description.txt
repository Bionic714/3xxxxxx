The jazz counterpart of Pablo Picasso, Miles changed the face of music forever in 1970 when he released Bitches Brew, his most adventurous, most controversial and ironically one of his best-selling recordings. It scored him his first gold record and his second Grammy award. The double-LP proved to be the shot heard 'round the jazz world, a revolutionary and influential release that signaled the advent of fusion. The Penguin Guide to Jazz calls Bitches Brew 'one of the most remarkable creative statements of the last 50 years, in any form.'
