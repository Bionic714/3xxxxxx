Doe Maar was in de early 80's the most popular band in Holland. They made music in the dutch language. Mid 80's they decided very unexpected to stop the band.
This album is recorded in 2000. They came together for a last album and a last definitive concert. ( witch i will seed soon ) They tought only one concert, but there were so much people who wants to visit it........
The result was more then 10 concerts in Ahoy Rotterdam. I was there, it was great!!
