Recorded in Australia at the Telstra Dome on February 28th, 2003. See the mighty KISS, backed up by a full symphony orchestra! Celebrating 30 years together as a band, the group spent months planning and rehearsing the spectacle, making sure they delivered an explosive anniversary present for their fans. Three sets are included in total, a standard rock set, an acoustic set with strings, and a powerhouse finale with full symphony backing.
