I had a copy a while back that worked fine with any mod I put in, but this one just doesn't seem quite right."

some one help plzz"
,VueChangZ,2009-07-18T06:15Z,"I know how to download this and play Here it is


1.  Mount the Cue or Bin file
2.  Download the game
3.  After your finished download go explore the disk.
  a.  Go to My Computer
  b.  Go to the CD ROM or Whatever you mounted on
  c.  Right-Click on it and go to Explore
4.  When your in the File or Folder go to Razor1911.
5.  Just leave that Folder/File there, Dont worry about it.
6.  Next Get another My Computer up and go to your file directory or where you downloaded the game into, It should look like this

C:\Program Files\Sierra\Homeworld2\Bin\Release

7.  When your in that file you should have 2 programs running.  The Razor1911 and the Release.
8.  NOW this is easy, Copy the Crack from Razor1911 into Release and Walla your in. ^^ 

Thanks for reading"
