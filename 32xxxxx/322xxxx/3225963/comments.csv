,Fladderman,2008-05-29T12:56Z,Hur fan ska man komma förbi att man ska stoppa i orginal-skivan?
,kiko-boss,2008-06-23T01:44Z,Man if you want to install the game to 100% you should rename the text file in the cd from leeme to l?eme.By the way the second disk does not exist.
,steadman2005,2008-11-11T01:57Z,how can i istall the game???????????
,saulys512,2008-11-11T16:27Z,this is work?
,user0a1,2009-07-16T14:06Z,"For those who are asked for CD 2 with the file Léeme.txt during installation (the second letter of the file name may be different. It's the cause of the problem):

Copy this file to your hard drive and rename it the way the installation program calls it (for Russian Windows it was called L?eme.txt) then specify the file location for the program. After that the program will ask for another file for which you must specify the CD (or other location) you install from. That should do the trick."
,grassflow,2012-05-23T15:52Z,"Game works perfect. I had no problem with installation and running. :)

Yes, This game is in ENGLISH. :)

But there is something that makes me wonder:
No.1. The oryginal exe file is detected by Comodo Internet Security as malware.
No.2. The crack exe file is not detected like a malware, but it needs CD image mounted.

Why does that happen? :|"
