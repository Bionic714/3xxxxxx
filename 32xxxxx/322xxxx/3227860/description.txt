Anyone who likes the Eagles, the Mavericks, or country rock in general should really listen to this.

The original Pure Prairie League were:  
John Call - Pedal steel guitar.  
George Powell - Lead guitar.  
Jim Caughlan - Drums.  
Jim Lanham - Bass.  
Craig Fuller - Vocals, guitar.

Larry Goshorn replaced Fuller in 1975.

This anthology covers much of the excellent music they produced between 1971 - 1976.
