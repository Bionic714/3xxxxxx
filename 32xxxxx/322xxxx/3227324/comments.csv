,vanjis_,2004-12-27T19:41Z,snälla kan någon seeda? Jag har letat efter det här spelet i evigheter! Nostalgi!
,klodrine,2005-02-01T08:12Z,Har noen prøvd spillet om det virker?? :D :)
,Trypp,2005-06-12T10:47Z,"Snälla, ni kan väl seeda lite till. Ligger på 99.2 % precis som de flesta vid det här laget och ingen verkar ha hela filen..."

,Geezter,2006-01-26T15:53Z,"How to get this game work under XP?
I tried DosBox ( http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/news.php?show_news=1 ), but the game requires Windows. Not XP, though. =)

Anyone has solution, mail me or post here."
,TetteAnnette,2007-07-04T17:37Z,"This works perfectly!
I just burned the image onto a cd with Nero, installed the game, and played. I have dosbox installed as well..

Thank you sooo much, I had this game when I was a kid, never figured it out, and I've been wanting to play it for years now^^"
,Ircha,2008-03-09T18:25Z,"This was my favorite game when I was like 5 years old. I wanna play it so badly, but I don't know how to open it or whatever. It's completed in my uTorrent, but how do I open it? 
help me out, add msn; fairyrock.x@hotmail.com

,scienquist,2008-05-31T17:11Z,"works well on vista! cool!  can't get the cut scenes to work though, anyone figure that out?"
,Pseudoxia,2008-06-07T16:07Z,"Can someone please seed this? I'm on 98% O_O

Thanks =]"
,transitvan,2008-11-16T08:29Z,Help  i can't get this to work. I've installed dosbox and followed the instructions from their site no luck. I'm re-downloading to start from scratch. Step by step info would be good as i'm new. Also is there a good deamon tools out there thats not corrupt? Any help would be great thanks.
,transitvan,2008-11-16T20:59Z,"Solved the problem. I mounted kq7 with deamon tools light, opened the drive it was mounted to and installed. Right click on shortcut make compatable with win95 tick 256 colours, 640+480 res, disable visual themes.
Set computer res to 800+600. Click on shortcut and play. No need for dosbox. I'm running vista."
,Zmagool,2009-02-10T17:57Z,"Hmm, i DL the torrent, installed it and everything but when im starting it up it said Windows Title was not found, What am i doing wrong anyone know?"
,inflikkt,2010-01-14T09:17Z,"just like the above guy, i get the same error... i tried editing the .win file to make it the correct mounted cd drive (G: in my case)  but it still says WINDOWS TITLE NOT FOUND... and then CAN'T FIND SIERRA.ERR -  what do i do??"
,irishwristwatch73689,2010-03-03T03:29Z,"thanks for the UL, but can someone help me get this to work with windows 7 64bit?"
,mrredhatter,2011-07-30T05:28Z,If anyone was wondering this is version 1.65c

,pixet,2012-05-26T00:55Z,"Here is how you can make this game work:

1. Download Game 
2. Burn the file on a ""CD"", don't know if it works on a dvd. Use programs like MagicIso, it works fine. 
3. Go inside the CD on my computer, select the file install and click on it. 
4. Follow the install instructions. 
5. When installed right click on the game's shortcut, select properties and compatibility
6. In this window you choose run the game in either win95 or win98. Choose 256 colors, choose resolution, inactivate visual themes.
7. Remember that the game can only be run with the cd opt in, otherwise the startup of game gets error.
8. Done, enjoy your long missing game! "
,pixet,2012-05-26T00:56Z,"Forgot to mention one thing: I did this on Win XP, can't really make sure it will work in newer windows versions. "
