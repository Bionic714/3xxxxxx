Players Run, a seven day, non-stop rally starting in Los Angeles and finishing in Miami.
Danger Ehrin from Jackass was on the rally along with the Teckademics crew and their new Teck/DTMpower M3. This time the cops weren’t so easy on them, but the rally was insane, with stops at racetracks for cart racing, a pitstop at Mardi Gras for some hot girly/party action, helicopter/speed boats rides, and some crazy flat out road racing in some sick import and exotic cars. Destroy also takes you to the Nopi Show, the SEMA Show, the streets of Japan, feature cars, snow mayhem, funny skits, street racing and the stupidly dangerous destruction of import cars all set to another kickass soundtrack.
