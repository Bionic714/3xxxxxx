,kenitic,2008-10-11T07:45Z,"I see why everyone is getting stuck.  We need someone to seed for a little while so that we can finish.  I only have .6% left.  So if anyone that has the portion that I am missing (row 4 columns 66 and 71) plz get on.  And if there are any seeders, also plz get on.  I will seed for about a week after I am finished.  But one step at a time.  Ari- Arigato."

,Calamitous_Avatar,2012-01-07T10:36Z,"Really, it's not that I'm missing much... I just need the last half a percent, then it's done. I can't express how infuriating this is. Zero seeders, 7 leechers. I'm going to assume that all 7 are stuck at 99.49%, so if anybody actually has this completed, seeding would be appreciated."
