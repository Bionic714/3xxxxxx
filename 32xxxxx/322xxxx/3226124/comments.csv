how can i install this programm?"
,hjelme83,2007-04-21T04:18Z,"Look ppl,  If you wanna steal software off the net then learn how to open .Bin files FIRST. 

And for you who diddnt know, When you download this you have to leave it in your torrent program for some time to Seed it to others.  if you just download then remove it from your torrent program ppl after you will get SUCKY download speed.  Like me!  So after stealing proffit from Magix, pay back by seeding it to ppl after you so someone profit on it.

PEACE."
,colorsit,2007-06-04T23:39Z,"Stop say "" SEED "" all the fucking time ... "

,Arukina,2007-06-19T22:35Z,"Okay, so I downloaded it, and I'm a noob I installed it and its mounted on alcohol but when I run the program its saying I need to insert the cd -_o, is there something im not doing?"
,c0mplex,2007-07-09T01:40Z,"To open a BIN file search this site for ""daemon tools"" and install it. Just follow the prompts and make sure to uncheck that search bar thing. After you install you'll need to restart. When you do you will see a red icon in your task bar along with utorrent, team speak, aim, itunes and all your other junk. Click on your red lightning bolt and it should say ""Device 0:[I:] No Media"". Don't panic if you don't have an 'I' you might have a 'E' or 'F' or something... but thats not the point. The point is you need to click on it. A nice file select window will pop up and you can then browse through all your porn and find the CD1 bin file. If the CD doesn't auto run then go to ""My Computer"" and double click on ""DVD Drive (I:)"" or E or F. When it asks you for the next CD, simply click on the icon again and click ""Device 0:[I:]"" again and select CD2 bin. 

If you need any more help I doubt you will find it on this site. You need to go to zeropaid.com and read the entire website. They have some good information on that site, but stay off the sloppyjoe or manwich poll.

,sitho,2008-05-28T20:51Z,"Well, I too get the message ""Please insert the magix music maker installation cd rom and start the program once again. "" This happens after i've installed it and try to run the program, even though i've mounted cd1 into daemon tools. I guess the problem is that magix searches for the cd in my physical cd rom device, and not in daemon tools. I've tried various settings in daemon tools, but nothing seems to work. This error have occured to me with other programs as well. Does anyone know how to get through this problem?"
