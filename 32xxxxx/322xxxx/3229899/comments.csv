Vill inte ha FBI knackandes på dörren för att microsoft loggade ens ip när man uppdaterade :-)

nej men seriöst funkar det?"
[T],swebarb,2004-08-07T16:44Z,tror SÄPO loggar ens IP.
,blaggewag,2004-08-07T18:22Z,"Does this really work ? I can't understand Swedish, so if someone would be so kind to answer me, thanks a lot :)"
,muddy,2004-08-07T18:58Z,It works but i don't know if you need it ... :)
,GRANDpapas,2004-08-07T20:57Z,"ok! hello!

I have windows xp pro life is great blabla....
Now I see this...should I take it? what s new? any differences? if I install this do I love all that s in my computer?

tx"
,muddy,2004-08-07T23:09Z,"""if I install this do I love all that s in my computer?""

If you're talking about the keygen ... I doubt!
If you're aiming at SP2 ... yeah. At any rate your comp will love it!"
,GRANDpapas,2004-08-08T06:20Z,"tx! lol I meant do I """" lose """" ...heehe...
I was wandering if installing the xp integrated sp2 would make me loose all my setting and files."
,muddy,2004-08-08T09:38Z,"If you want to keep your settings, install sp2 only! Don't use 'xp integrated sp2' as a system update!

If you do have ""xp integrated sp2"", go for a clean install [you'll loose your settings] in that case you'll don't need this keygen.

,harry123,2004-08-09T01:28Z,"Yes it really works, but:

Use the Windows XP PRO VLK option, and,

Fill in the product key range fields:
640-640
640-640

This way your product key (as seen in 'my computer' -> 'properties') will have the xxxx-640-xxxx-xxxx format, which is the only range i know of that works with the new Windows Update 5 (www.microsoft.com -> windows update).

Have fun :)

,jemtec,2005-08-05T23:04Z,"This is seriously outdated.
Microsoft has been initializing new Validity checks.
This no longer functions.
I went to microsofts site today and it downloaded some new software for updates, and my key failed using the same system.
It worked when I first made the key 6 months ago however.
Anybody have any ideas where an updated version maybe?
Bills changing the key system yet again.

,92oscbra,2006-05-26T13:52Z,"I have tried many keygens for Windows XP sp2, but none of them works:S. When I go in to: C:/windows/system32/oobe.exe the internet comes up. I have tried auto keychanger, but when i'm going to update it comes valid key. Can someone help me?! I can't install anything beacause it says that I don't have sp1 or better version but i got sp2."

,eL_giMikErO,2008-06-13T10:55Z,is these keys are orig or what?i can use windows update then..
,ladycroft,2008-10-13T09:02Z,This must have some kina virus or trojan. AVG notices it right off the bat.
,stupidishere,2009-03-07T11:26Z,"NOD 32 detects it as a trojan downloader.........

I also read somewhere that most XP keyens are trojan infested..........

I also have one keygen and that is trojan infected too....though it has never given me problems except once....."
