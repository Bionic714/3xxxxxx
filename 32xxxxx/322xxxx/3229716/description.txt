Jacki (Gina Gershon), sexy punk rocker and lead singer of the all-girl band Clamdandy, is at a crossroads. With her birthday fast approaching, she must decide whether or not to keep the promise she made to herself over a decade earlier: Quit the music business at 40 if she hasn't made it by then. The decision gets complicated when old secrets, false hope, and personal tragedies threaten to break up the band.
