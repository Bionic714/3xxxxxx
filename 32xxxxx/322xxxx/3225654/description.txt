 |  Lotus Challenge is truly the most complete racing game to date.     | 
 |  By mixing different gaming styles, camera angles, story lines and   |
 |  even a hint of role playing, players can choose multiple paths      |
 |  through the game. Five huge modes offer players a complete tour     |
 |  of the world of Lotus. Stunt mode takes you to the set of a         |
 |  Hollywood blockbuster run by a hotshot director who gives you the   |
 |  play-by-play of the scene he wants you to execute. A multi-player   |
 |  option is available for those who want to challenge others through  |
 |  a championship or single race. Upon winning specific challenges,    |
 |  hidden tracks and cars are unlocked, so if you have already won a   |
 |  race you can go back and test your skills in a faster car. 	        |
