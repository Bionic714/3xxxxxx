The premise of a cello-playing four piece (from Finland, no less) performing the music of Metallica may seem outrageous at first, but much of the metal gods' repertoire translates surprisingly well into this "classical" reading. And while Apocalyptica chooses to concentrate on more recent hits like "Enter Sandman," "Sad But True" and "Wherever I May Roam" for obvious commercial purposes, it is Metallica's earlier, more complex compositions, like "Master of Puppets," "Creeping Death," and "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)," which actually work best in this scenario. The quartet's love and understanding of the music is the real key here, and their attention to detail and technically flawless performance will no doubt satisfy even the most skeptical of fans. And while it is unlikely that this album will interest non-Metallica fans, it obviously inspired the band themselves to explore the classical direction on their own terms with 1999's S&M album.
