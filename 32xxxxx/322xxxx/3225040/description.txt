summary:
Reodor Fälgen lives on a mountain (Flåklypatoppen) at whose foot lies the small village of Flåklypa. He lives there with a bird (Solan Gundersen) and a furry animal (Ludvig), managing by repairing bikes and inventing things. When the three hear about a certain Rudolf Blodstrupmoen, who is going to enter the Flåklypa Grand Prix, and they discover that he's stolen one of Reodor's inventions, they decide to enter themselves, with their impressive race car, Il Tempo Gigante. The only trouble is to raise the money to build the car. Solan manages this by getting a sponsor, an Arabian oil sheik. Finally, it's time for the race of the century, Flåklypa Grand Prix. Who will win this thrilling and fantastic race?
