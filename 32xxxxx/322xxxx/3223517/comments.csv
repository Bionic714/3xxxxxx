Like, for instance, go to google.com, then type in "".bin file"". Shit, you could even type ""what the fuck do I do with a .bin file"" into google and you will most likely find the information you need a lot quicker than posting here and waiting days to get an answer. How do you think we now how to do this stuff? Magic? Genes? 

No, we search. And then search some more. And then after we search, we read, and then read some more, and then we read EVEN more. Yes, there is actual reading and learning involved with certain aspects of pirating."

Alcohol 120 (and probably all the other mounting software) need a cue file. Just pull open notepad and make a file called dev-pop1 and change the extension from .txt to .cue. Copy and past this into the text document:

FILE ""dev-pop1.bin"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE1/2352

Anyway, the torrent works. When you mount dev pop 1 I think, during the install it will ask you to insert CD 2. Just alt tab out of it, and mount dev pop 2. And that?s it. It?s easy and the game works fine, no crashes, I can save, and all the audio is here. Download and seed. "

Thank you very much for this! The torrent works fine, the download didn't take long, and it's a great game (great series actually).  Great everything :D

You, yes you right there flailing bad comments like a moron. obviously you haven't been pirating very long so let me tell you this, people that rather post a question that has been posted billions of different time, instead of google, are morons. Kinda like you!

I mean these people could even read comments from other game torrents to figure out wtf to do, because morons (like you) spoil them by giving them an ANSWER.

,gurudev1000,2010-12-17T14:56Z,"To everyone who faces the error after starting the game...

- Download and install something like GIZMO DRIVE.
- Right click on each of the '.bin' files in the downloaded game and mount them.
- Open the first mounted folder and run SETUP.EXE
- When the installation asks for location of the second CD then show it the drive where the second BIN file was mounted.
- Once installation finishes EXIT the registration windows and FINISH the installation by making sure the game is NOT run.
- COPY the POP.EXE from the crack folder and paste it into the ""UBISOFT | Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" folder by replacing the original file there.
NOW run it... 
If this doesn't work, then I don't know what will. I could run this game smoothly in Windows 7 without having to screw around with any compatibility issues. Let me mention, I had the same error when I simply tried installing the game out of a folder which was extracted from the .bin files. MOUNTING the .bin files solved it instead of extracting them.
