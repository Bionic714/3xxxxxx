Date: 9 August 1999
Summary: A poorly made surreal type of copy of ""New York Stories"".

    This film is set in the same hotel room spanning about 60 years. It is divided into three separate stories, with only the first one being worthy of a viewer's time. Of course, in typical David Lynch fashion, the best story fails to make any type of sense whatsoever. It is about a man (played brilliantly by Harry Dean Stanton) who brings a hooker into room 603 and just before having sex with her, is interrupted by an ominous gentlemen who eventually takes part in what the original man payed for, with lots of bizarre twists along the way. The second story is a standard sitcom-esque narrative with a twist of irony at the end, and the third story has something to do with a mentally unstable women and her husband, but it was so tedious I can barely remember any details from it. This takes the same approach that the 1989 film NEW YORK STORIES delivered. The hotel is set in New York and like the aforementioned film, it deals with three totally different stories all in the same setting. One element that I did strongly enjoy about ""Hotel Room"" was the bell hop who appeared in all three stories and never appeared to age. That was pretty creative; the rest of the movie wasn't.
