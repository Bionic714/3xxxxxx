,plumser,2004-08-02T09:45Z,"Hey, thanks again m8! but since you say there is only the maps... is this eyemaker or whatever they call it not included?"
,marcin_ps2,2004-08-02T09:49Z,eye maker is included :)
,marcin_ps2,2004-08-02T10:01Z,Keep your torrent downloads open after you've finished downloading!
,plumser,2004-08-02T11:29Z,great! I just have one little question.. do you think you can upload the html file so you can navigate through all the maps? I mean it's no big deal just for fun.. I think its called index.htm and lies in the root of the cd or something like that....
,marcin_ps2,2004-08-02T11:34Z,index.html is just a small % of navigate menu rest are little brothers this Hires maps about 250mb-350mb  
,muddy,2004-08-02T15:46Z,Oh this is so good ... almost better than sex ...  :lol:
,plumser,2004-08-02T19:25Z,ok.. well you don't think you can upload the interfacefolder along with the indexfile? just zip it and make a little torrent for me (I mean your allready a God in my eyes but now your a twoheaded god)? ;) ;p
,plumser,2004-08-03T07:16Z,hihi! ah well do what ever you want to.
