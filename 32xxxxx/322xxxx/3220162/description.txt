MS Press - Inside C Sharp 2nd Edition
OReilly - Programming C Sharp 2nd Edition

The O'Reilly book is a great one, just thought this could be appreciated as there are no C# books in the .NET book package :)

Edit:
It seems the MS book somehow got corrupted. I'm sure I've been reading it before, but I just checked and it's not working on my PC either atm.
