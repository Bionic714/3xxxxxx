,mason_zen,2006-01-13T20:12Z,"Despite argghh's comments, I would still like to give this download a chance. I'm stuck at 86.5%.  If you have 100%, please seed!  Been waiting for months now it seems. Thanks again!"
,tompelli,2006-04-07T09:29Z,If this has been D/L 476 times there should be more complaints? Like mason_zen stuck at 86.5 Belder (or any of the other 474) please re-seed!
,tompelli,2006-05-30T07:38Z,After waiting 2 months managed to get CD. Will upload & let everyone know torrent ID
