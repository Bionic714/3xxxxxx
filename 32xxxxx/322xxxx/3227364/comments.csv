,riplikethat,2008-07-07T01:56Z,"Every fucking song is lower than 192 kbps (mostly above 128). But seriously, why the fuck isn't there a better torrent for this movie's soundtrack?

Music is excellent, too bad there are no high quality torrents (you can't enjoy soundtrack like this in anything lower than 320 kbps.. an yes, I am bitching about it)."
