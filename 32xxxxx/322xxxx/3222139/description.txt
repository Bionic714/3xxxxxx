These two shows are ripped off a Tommy Cooper dvd I bought named 'Just Like That'. Hence the name. Quite obvious, isn't it?

The episodes are as follows:

The Magic Touch - Compiled from rare and classic footage. Tommy takes us through some riotous sketches in his own off-the-cuff style. Join him and guests Eric Sykes and Henry Cooper as they encounter Nautical Cooper, Accountant Cooper, Courting Cooper, Troubadour Tommy and the grand finale - the Amazing Shirt Trick. 

Tribute to a Comic Genius - It’s all here: the bizarre conjuring tricks, the comic antics and Tommy’s unique brand of humour, exactly as you remember him. Also included are heartfelt tributes from many of Tommy’s friends and colleagues, including Benny Hill, Jim Davidson, Ronnie Barker, Mike Yarwood, Eric Sykes, Max Bygraves, and Eammon Andrews.
