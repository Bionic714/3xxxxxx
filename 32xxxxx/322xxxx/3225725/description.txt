

 A crazy collection of DJs are waiting inside for their chance to become 

 the ultimate popper. You are given the chance to pick from one of up to 

 five characters each with their own unique Super Special Attack. 

 

 You are given a sequence of bubbles, which can be fired down the grid 

 to make lines of bubbles of the same color that will then pop. Bubbles 

 can be burst along the horizontal or vertical by creating any lines of 

 three or more adjacent bubbles of the same color. Special Attacks and 

 Bubbles keep the game play fast and furious.
