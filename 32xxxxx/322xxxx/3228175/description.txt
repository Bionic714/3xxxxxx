Set on the island of Mykonos. A young couple (Christopher and Celia) arrive on this quaint Greek Island for a winter break. They rent a house, and initially seem like ordinary, swinging thrill seekers, who enjoy having sex in a phone booth. But all of these rather innocent, initial impressions are shattered when Chris wanders outside one sunny morning, stumbles across a lost lamb, has sex with it, and then slaughters the poor creature with a handy knife! Celia seduces a local house painter, and screws him in a field as Christopher captures a few Kodak moments from afar. And together, they torture the poor guy by nailing his hands to the ground, urinate on him and force feeding him a bucket of paint. Then they invade the home of a gay shop keeper (a "filthy creature"), while a middle-aged lesbian slut gets torched from Chris and winds up decapitated by a bulldozer! There's also a black private eye on their trail, a creepy crime novelist, and a pair of degenerate hippies who rape Celia in her bathtub. One amusing scene is where Chris invades a gay party wielding a sword. Chris chases one of the guys through the middle of town with a sword and no one else in the town seems to notice. These two don't simply kill somebody--they also have to burn their faces off by lighting a handy aerosol bottle. The couple believe they are helping God punish the perverse by torturing and killing visiting (and local) sexual deviants. Or as Christopher puts it, "I am his angel, with a flaming sword, sent to kill dirty worms".
