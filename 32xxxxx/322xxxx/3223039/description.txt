  It's the Stone Age - and sheer chaos has erupted!
  A horrible virus has spread all over the world - flying dinosaurs get a
  dose of the endless shits, Heterosaurus develops homosexual instincts and,
  worst of all - all those thick-dicked cavemen have become impotent!
  Well...not ALL of them... the intrepid CAVEMAN ZAC somehow slept through
  the virus attack - so now it's up to him to save humanity! With 'club'
  power, he has to screw his way through 5 different game worlds, satisfying
  the cavewomen and fathering as many cave brats as he can. A crazy,
  hilarious Jump'n'Run that won't just stretch your cheek muscles!
