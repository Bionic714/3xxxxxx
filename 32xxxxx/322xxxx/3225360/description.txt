Picking up where 1962-1966 left off, the double-album compilation 1967-1970, commonly called the "Blue Album," covers the Beatles' later records, from Sgt. Pepper through Let It Be. Like the Red Album, the Blue Album contains a mixture of hits, including singles like "Lady Madonna," "Hey Jude," and "Revolution" that were never included on an LP, plus important album tracks like "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," "A Day in the Life," "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," and "Come Together." Like its predecessor, 1967-1970 misses several great songs, but the compilation nevertheless does capture the essence of the Beatles' later recordings.
