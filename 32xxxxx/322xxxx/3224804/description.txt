Instructions
An ISO-9660 image file is an exact representation of a CD, including the content and the logical format. The most common use of an image file is to write it to a blank CD-R resulting in an identical copy of the original CD including file name and volume label information. ISO Images can also be extracted directly to a file location by many CD-R utilities. For more information about image files, please visit the MSDN FAQ.
