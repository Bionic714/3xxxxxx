Alright Here is a 2xcd Ramones post, these shows are 10 years apart and are both great. The Provinissi show comes from a uncut live TV broadcast in 88 and the quality is great. The other show comes from German TV in 78 but was re-broadcast so this is from a perfect copy of the full show and both are in SVCD. I have cut the 88 show so you can burn them to CD's or join them back up if you are going to put them on DVD. Enjoy!
