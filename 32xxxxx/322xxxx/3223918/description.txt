Ripper's notes:
Here is the uncut version of Ichi the Killer. Sky released the int. cut version earlier. The runtime of the movie is 123mins in PAL. This equals to 129mins NTSC (imdb stat)(185143frames/23.976fps)/60 In other words, pure uncut. We kept the original AC3 5.1 Japanese track and added English subtitles.This is NOT your regular Harry Potter flick. Ichi the Killer is probably the most violent movie around. For a "splat" list of what the uncut version contains goto: http://us.imdb.com/AlternateVersions?0296042 You have been warned....

Plot:
Yakuza boss Anjo disappears with 100 million yens. His loyal gang members, lead by the masochist Kakihara, start a search, but their aggressive and gory methods worry the other yakuza gangs. Kakiharas most scary counterpart is the mysterious Ichi, a psychopathic killer with a dark childhood secret, who is controlled by a retired yakuza boss.
