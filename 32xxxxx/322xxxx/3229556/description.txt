This 1960 recording was a landmark album in John Coltrane's career, the first to introduce his quartet with pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones and the first release on which he played soprano saxophone. It also provided him with a signature hit, as his new group conception came together wonderfully on the title track. It's an extended modal reworking in 6/4 time that brought the hypnotic pulsating quality of Indian music into jazz for the first time, with Coltrane's soprano wailing over the oscillating piano chords and pulsing drums. The unusual up-tempo version of Gershwin's 'Summertime' is a heated example of Coltrane's 'sheets of sound' approach to conventional changes, while 'But Not for Me' receives a radical harmonic makeover. This is an excellent introduction to Coltrane's work. --Stuart Broomer
