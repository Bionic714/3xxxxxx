War in the Pacific: The Struggle Against Japan 1941-1945 is a completely
new strategy game, based on the award winning Uncommon Valor game engine.
The scale is 60 miles per hex and losses are individual vehicles, aircraft,
guns and squads. Since half the planet Earth is covered by the titanic
Pacific struggle, the game is massive in scope, covering thousands of ships
tens of thousands of aircraft. Virtually every ship, air group and
battalion sized or larger troop formation is covered in exacting detail.
Massive, yet simple to play, as the computer tracks all the factors and the
interface allows the player to concern himself with only the degree of
detail he prefers. Phases are one day, composed of two 12-hour impulses.
A turn is composed of 1 to 7 phases, at the players discretion.
He may also choose continuous play and may interrupt that by pressing
a key.
