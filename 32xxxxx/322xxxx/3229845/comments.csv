,toper121,2009-10-11T09:28Z,"Thanks for the game, but 3727-4873-7639-7466 is not working for me at all. 

Could this be because I'm using the dreaded Windows Vista? Do I need to download a patch first or something? Of course, how can I install a patch when I can't even properly install the game?

HELP!"

,IndarkShadowz,2011-05-10T03:53Z,You can pick up the fixed patches for this title at Game Fix. Scroll down till you reach War in the Pacific. Take all the v1.8x patches available (four). This will allow you to successfully patch the game from v1.0 to v1.8.0.6.
,waging_war,2012-05-29T02:05Z,This is no good. There's no way to install. Not that I can find anyway.
