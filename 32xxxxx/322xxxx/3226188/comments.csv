,Jinx_Dojo,2009-08-04T21:53Z,"After 48 hours of monitoring this torrent, I think it's safe to say that, as of 2009/08/04, there are no seeders. Everyone is stuck at 67.2%. If there are any seeders out there, please do come forward.

The alternate torrent URL posted by CrazyJocke seems to have a seed, however it is 1 large DivX file rather than 2 disc-size XviD files, and while I personally don't mind, it's my opinion that this group release is better named/tagged than the other torrent, and therefore possibly of higher standards. We will see when I complete the alternate torrent:
