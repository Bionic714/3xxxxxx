,ct!,2007-01-13T06:42Z,"The reviewer is completely wrong: Mike Patton got the FNM gig /because/ of Mr. Bungle, Mr. Bungle was not a side project to appease his creativity. However, this album is very important to Patton's career, and is a must have for any lover of modern music. And, having now read this person's reviews of the songs, just don't listen to him. Download Mr. Bungle, and listen and judge for yourself. The band has created some of our time's most important and challenging work, and it needs to be heard."
