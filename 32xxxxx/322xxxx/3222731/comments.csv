,killeen21,2006-12-26T03:00Z,"I can't get this rip working on my windows XP SP2 system.
The screen stays black after launching the app - I have tried compatibility modes, but it does not help - the strange thing is, the RC 2000 demo runs flawless on my system - what's up with this rip?

I have decompressed all necessary files and set up the registry.
I have found out that if you delete the VAR folder inside the game folder and update to version 5.3 the game launches, but there are no textures in the game and absoltely NO sound or music!

has anyone else had this problem?
I appreciate any help - this is a GREAT Rally game!"

,SachBro,2009-08-23T02:09Z,"Hey man, this is not working. I unzipped it, unaced it. Run the setup.bat which placed all files in MP3 and Speech folder but it still doesn't work. Game launches, however first of all all animated icon such as play, setting etc appear white and blurry and then game crashes as you start the race, does anyone else have the same problem. Pls, any suggestions would help "
