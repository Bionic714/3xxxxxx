,cforger,2004-11-18T17:01Z,"Ugh!! I'm still at 12%, and I've uploaded that 12% about 15 times to other people over the last few days. I guess we're all stuck at the same amount. Whoever gets a full copy should stay online with it for a few days to let the rest of us catch up. 

If someone has a full copy, they can msn me at christopher1976_2@hotmail.com, and I'll seed it for everyone else. "
