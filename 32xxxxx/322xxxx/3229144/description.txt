  ::: Summary :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     It sounded like a HK Cinema fan's ultimate wet dream... Zhang Yimou to direct 
     a martial arts epic with Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Leung Chiu Wai, Zhang Ziyi and 
     Donnie Yen in the cast, Ching Siu-Tung doing the action, Christopher Doyle the 
     cinematography and Emil Wada the costumes. What more could you ask for? 
     (Well, Brigitte Lin coming out of retirement and Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung 
     sharing the action director credits, perhaps).

     I guess we have CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON to thank for making the wu xia 
     world bankable again, and generating the interest and investment required to 
     bring a project of this stature together. There's no doubt that the US Market
     was a major target, and US$ went into the funding. Given this it's a tragedy 
     that Yimou let Miramax get their paws on it and effectively ruin any chances 
     it had of major US success

     Apart from Zhang Ziyi and the Tan Dun soundtrack (a terrible choice no doubt 
     enforced by US investors), CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is not a good reference 
     point by which to evaluate HERO. Much more appropriate is Wong Kar Wai's ASHES 
     OF TIME, with which it shares two lead actors and a cinematographer. HERO is 
     definitely more commercially oriented, but shares a beauty and philosophical 
     richness with AOT, and a certain melancholy mood.

     The story of HERO starts off quite simply, as Jet Li begins to recount his 
     martial triumphs to the Emperor of Qin. The tale is told in flashbacks which 
     revisit and re-evaluate the same events, elaborating on and changing the story 
     as we learn more. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great 
     ay of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale 
     expertly, as one would expect from such a master film maker.

     Zhang Yimou himself is such an accomplished cinematographer he hardly needed to 
     hire somebody else for the job - but if there's anybody better than Yimou it's 
     Christopher Doyle. I wonder how much conflict there was on set though, as I am 
     sure each had very strong visions of how they wanted scenes to look. The result 
     doesn't show any signs of it if such a conflict occured though, as the visual 
     style seems exceptionally strong and focussed throughout. A large part of this is 
     Yimou's use of bold colours to delineate the different sections of the story (The 
     green, the red, the yellow, the blue, the white). With Emil Wada's stunning costumes 
     and the great choice of locations, HERO is almost as rich in stunning imagery as 
     SHES OF TIME. It's a true work of art, harking back to Yimou's older films like 
     HANGHAI TRIAD and RAISE THE RED LANTERN - I'm really pleased to see him making such 
     visual films again. The visuals are sometimes let down by some unconvincing CGI 
     effects, unfortunately.

     Zhang Yimou has never directed an action movie before, so people were clearly worried 
     he wouldn't know what to do with the fight scenes that a wu xia movie needs more than 
     anything else. It's been quite a few years since Ching Siu Tung has produced any really 
     impressive work too, so I was rather worried - especially when I heard (from good authority) 
     that Yimou had Ching had clashed on set. Apparently Zhang wanted more grounded, realistic 
     kung fu, which really isn't Ching Siu Tung's thing (should have got Sammo or Yuen Wo Ping!). 
     I guess Ching got the upper hand in the end, as the fight scenes are certainly not grounded 
     or realistic - they're very much about the twirling and whirling and the graceful flying 
     that Ching Siu Tung virtually defined. They're not as manic as he usually makes the action 
     when he directs himself, though - a fact that sometimes makes the wirework look a bit awkward.

     A real surprise is that the weakest fight scene of the film is that one that pits the 
     two best martial artists together. Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen opens the film with some sword vs. 
     pear action. There's some beautiful moments, but I felt the scene lacked impact and featured 
     some awkward moves too. Oddly enough, the fight I enjoyed the most featured no real martial 
     artistry at all - Maggie Cheung vs (well, you'll see) in a beautiful autumnal scene of 
     falling leaves. I guess that's because Ching Siu Tung is really not working to his 
     trengths when he tries to do "real" martial arts.

     I had held off watching HERO for months, because as soon as I got the first released DVD 
     (the DVD-5 from Guang Dong Face Ah) it was announced that the extended version of the 
     film would be released in a few weeks. It's generally well known now that Zhang Yimou 
     was persuaded to cut about 20 minutes from the film by the hatchet men at MiramAXE, who 
     really must die first when the revolution comes. I figured the first time I see it 
     I should see the best possible version, for maximum impact, so I was willing to wait. 
     Well it's been 2 months now and the extended version is now indefinitely delayed due to 
     legal issues, so I finally gave in and watched the DVD I'd had lying around for so long. 
     Now that I've seen it I have to say I don't really see what another 20 minutes would add 
     to the film - it seems quite complete and well paced at about 95 minutes. A little more 
     development of Donnie Yen's character would be nice, but other than that it's hard to 
     imagine what is missing. Longer action scenes maybe? Or perhaps just 20 minutes of Christopher 
     Doyle's beautifully composed landscape shots, or close ups of Maggie Cheung dying.

     I'm glad I waited to see the film anyway though, as it allowed all the hype and anticipation 
     to die down. Unfortunately, when a film is as highly anticipated as this it's inevitable 
     that there will be "backlash syndrome" as people feel let down that it wasn't the ultimate 
     movie of all time they heard/hoped it would be (it was amusing to watch the reviews on 
     CROUCHING TIGER swing between "incredible" and "awful" as hype waves ruined the experience 
     for many, and I'm sure the same will happen with HERO).

     Zhang Yimou is an extremely talented director in many respects, but perhaps the greatest 
     is his ability to get incredible performances out of his cast. With such an illustrious 
     cast on board he perhaps felt he didn't need to try as much though (or they weren't willing 
     to listen), as the acting isn't as powerful as I had expected. It's still of a very high 
     quality, but doesn't evoke the same strong emotions as some of the performances in ASHES OF 
     TIME. Leung Chiu-Wai gets the top award for acting though, which will surprise few people. 
     Zhang Ziyi only has a small part, but shows a lot of talent too - nice to see such skill 
     in somebody that still has most of her career ahead of her. Of course, it was Zhang Yimou 
     that discovered and nurtured her talent in THE ROAD HOME.

     There are only two disappointments in HERO, for me. One is the special effects, which aren't 
     up to the very latest standards. A little less use of CGI would have made it go a lot further 
     (like in CTHD). The other is the soundtrack, which is really just much too similar to the 
     rouching Tiger soundtrack. It doesn't fit HERO as well, but it is still pretty evocative 
     and effective - just too similar to CTHD.

     I still intend to pick up the extended version of HERO when it's released, to see what Zhang 
     Yimou's ideal vision for the film was. Even running shorter than he really wanted it's a 
     mighty fine film though, and one I have no hesitation in recommending if anybody hasn't seen 
     it yet. If MiramAXE ever do get round to releasing it in the US, I hope it does well.
