Thank you very much for uploading an old favourite of mine, Daylight Again with Crosby, Stills & Nash.
I have the record on vinyl and I have convert it to wav-files and then to mp3 but I did not like the result, it was not so good and it will take some time to do it again for better quality.
But now I dont have to, thanks to you.
Thanks again."
