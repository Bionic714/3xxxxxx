,mrvoor,2009-12-06T15:27Z,"dudes, subtitle is in English or not?"
,penisfuck,2010-03-22T02:52Z,"The subtitles are hard to read, they are in a small white font, looking washed out. However, you can set the player to use a background box and cover the hardcoded subs with external ones. Just use these softsubs, they are fitting for this release:

Btw, I use KMplayer to do the job."
,laned130,2011-05-28T11:31Z,"Many thanks for the up!

S/L currently 30/12.

Thanks for the soft subs link. I personally found the hard subs fine, though. Hard subs are in English and something else.

It looks like it was taken from video, and the encoding/compression's not as good as I would expect for the file size - I think algorithms have improved since 2004. However, it was still very watchable.

This is currently voted number 29 on IMDb's list of top 90's films. I have absolutely no idea how - I personally thought it was awful!

Overall:
A/V/S/M: 9?/6/7/3
(S=subs)"
