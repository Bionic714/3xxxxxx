Illegal street racing...

Mischief Invasion the fourth chapter of the notorious Mischief series comes at you like a Blitzkrieg. This time the boys go off to Europe for the Cannonball Europe Run. The race was the fastest and sickest of all the runs so far. It started in the UK and went on through Spain, France, Africa and back to the UK in only 5 days. They made it alive but some cars were lost during the raging road war, also again we were not taken to jail, but some were not so lucky. The rally was filmed using hi-teck Autoxcam system to better put you right in the driving seat and in the middle of the chaos and fun. Mischief Invasion also takes you street racing in Philly with pro skater Josh Kalis, Drift USA, HyperFest 2, Mega auto abuse, Jaguar demolition, PortaPotty hunting, Reckless 4, Frog Killer, Feature Cars Dado's dtmpower.net turbo M3, Pro skater Kerry Getz M3, Ultima GTR, JapVillage Supra/RX7 and more all set to the insane driving music from Herrera Productions.
