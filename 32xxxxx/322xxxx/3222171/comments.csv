,greylion,2005-02-27T14:47Z,"Warning, this is a recording from a movie theater, not a DVDRip.
Barely acceptable quality for fullscreen viewing."
,The Duck,2006-07-09T13:07Z,"Nice that someonenhas taking there time to seed a bit.. but please turn on superseed so that you doesn't send the same traffic to all of us.

thx anyway.."

,Drunken Munkey,2007-01-05T22:27Z,"Hmm. I won't be downloading this if it's a theatre recording...

Oh and can I just ask, why the fuck are Swedish people complaining about the lack of seeds for an ENGLISH video?

What the crap?!"
,sandasandasanda,2007-08-05T22:40Z,"Drunken Munkey: Because swedish people also watch english films cause the seeding is even crappier on other torrents, of course. Not every swedish are so retarded that they can't watch english films without subs."
