You yanks love to take credit for others inventions and culture.  4% of media in America is foreign,  no wonder the majority no nothing of other cultures.

,proudamerican,2007-04-22T16:39Z,"Good quality.

I personally didn't like the movie but apparently most people do. I found it to be way too slow. 
Anyways, I'm seeding..."
,GeeBangkok,2007-07-13T02:25Z,"The quality is good but i have to say that this is by far the most boring film i have ever had the missfortune to see! I have never posted a comment on any site about a torrent download but after seeing this i signed up just to air my opinion! It was recomended to me by an American friend living here in Bangkok and i can only assume that it was a joke or something. Sorry to be so harsh, i can see that this film seems to be popular but have no idea why. It's slow, Boring, Slow, Slow oh and nothing happens! Apart from it being a load of shit it's ok.......Not. If you value your time and like to be entertained i strongly advise against this download, I'm sure this will upset some people but frankly i am upset that i sat through nearly 3 hours of the biggest load of soul destroying crap in the world.

,xhizors,2007-12-10T22:25Z,Which version is this? Is it in a chronological order without flashbacks?
,xhizors,2007-12-10T22:27Z,@GeeBangkok: If you didn't enjoy it... why didn't you just stop watching it? I'm sorry all movies can't have Godzilla's and Transformer's.
,gagga12345,2007-12-12T21:11Z,"To Blaze7:
What Hell are you talking about?
When this movie was made, China barely had a film industry or an economy at all. Second, stop trying to sell your conspiracies, it's all BS.
By the way this is a great movie, long but great"
,ManonaMission,2007-12-28T08:22Z,Much Appreciated.
,vascoa,2008-02-25T05:45Z,"@Blaze7: 
Director:Sergio Leone
Release Date:1 June 1984
1st leone is italian, and never spoke a word of english
2nd, IN THIS ONE, IF SOMEONE IS COPPYING SOMEONE ARE THE CHINESE, LOL
If you don't know how Sergio Leone is, then just shut up... 
I know hollywood usually does bad remakes of bad movies like ""Vanilla sky"" or ""Solaris"" or an endless list. But please at least know what you are talking about before you fart your opinions out!.. "

Your a fuckin idiot.

""Learn about the reserve bank, then you will have an idea who really runs your county. ""

What you mean how all our shit is made/assembled in china? That's what makes you guys run our economy? Not to be racist or offensive to the Chinese people but... No, its because you guys are retarded enough to make our shirts for 15cents a piece so we can sell them for $15, that's why we do better than you, that's why china is a 3rd world country, that's why we can develop such high end quality movies such as this and we get you guys develop kung-fu movies with voice dubbed just for us.

@jkchwf327fjkshsa

Ahahaha, yeah dude that's exactly why its a rip-off. Actually I think both of those movies are rip-offs of Once Upon a Time in Mexico!"
,Tragonn,2009-06-07T11:30Z,"Lucky13s
damn you are dumb. :)
China is the biggest moneylender to the US. Your country and everything in it is financed by loaned money. You are actually buying stuff from China with money you borrowed from them. :)
So not only are you creating a large debt, you are also helping the Chinese business to grow. :)

Thats what the other guy meant. Heres a tip: If you do not want to strengthen the cliche that every american got an IQ of 50. Maybe you should actually get your head out of your ass and educate yourself a little. Before you spew out moronic things like that. :)

PS
China is the most populated country in the world. And its area is large too. Large parts of that country is no longer a ""third world"". Its rich."
,Faraday90,2009-06-18T00:10Z,To blaze - Yanks? This film was made by an Italian director. You're a jackass.

,ibr4him,2010-04-29T20:07Z,"spoiler alert!

before reading watch the film..

i think many people miss the point of the ending. here is the thing: noodles (not the old noodles) comes chinese theater with the newspaper in his pocket. the final smile tells us all we watched is in noodles's mind. at the end, every thing is cleared up..

watch carefully every where, every time.."

Well, I think Russai is the 1st country in the world. Any objection?? the Arabic emiretes is the second. The Quatar is the third. You see, no the US neither China with this wonderful prefix super! Besides, I hate kung-fu movies. And never gonna buy Chinese of 15 Ñ or bucks sirts!!
Still, it's a really good movie! :lol:
Be nice to one another, guys.and happy watching.
And, just Meerry Christmas!!!! "
